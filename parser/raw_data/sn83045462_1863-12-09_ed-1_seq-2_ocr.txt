j The proper offUers of the treasury have
t-^ J0*?**1*?**! ves required, by the liw of the
l nlted Sta'e* upon the subject, to demand a
| tax i.pen the incomes of foreign consuls in this
country. While an ch a demand may not, in
, s'rictness, ty lu derogation of public law. or
p' jhaps ef any existinz treaty between theUni.
t?'d States and a foreign country, the exne
diency of e?. far modifying the act as to exempt
from tax the income of such consuls m are not
l . itizeris of the United States, derived from the
emoluments of thrir ofilco, or from property
not situated in the T'nited State?, is submitted
to your Prions consideration. 1 make this
suc^eetion upou the ground that a comity
which ought to be retiprofited exempts our
cor.nils, in all oth< r countries, from taxation
to the extent thus Indicated. The t?nited state*
I think, ought not to be exception.-)bly illiberal
to international trade and commere*.
j The operation^ of the treasury during the
last >?-.ir have been t~ucce?=rullv conducted.
The enactment b}'Congress of a national bank
ing law has proved a valuable support of the
public credit; and the general legislation in re.
1 at ion to loans has fully answered theexiu?r
'ations of its favorers. Some amendments
may !*? required to perfect existing laws, but
no change in their principles or general none
is believed to l<e nerd.
Since these measures ha\e b.-en in operation.
?i, d'^ands on the treasury, including the
pay of .he array and navy, have b -en prompt
; IT met and fully satisfied. No conslderabl.
body or troops, it is believed, were ever more
amply provid? d, and more liberally and i?unc
; tnally paid; and it may be added that by no
people were the burdens incident to ant?
war ever more cheerlullv borne.

Our country has advantages superior to anv
other uation in our resources or iron and tiin

the immediate vicinity of both, and all avail
able and in close proximity to navigable waters.
>v l'bout the advantage of public works, th*
resources of the nation have been developed
and ite power displayed in the construction or
a navy of snch magnitude which has, at the
tery period of its creation, rendered signal l
service to the Union.
The tncreaso ot the number or seamen in the
public, service, ftom seven thousand Ave hun
dred iuen, in the spring of 1*61, to about thirty- !
four thousand at the present time, ha? been ac
complished without special legislation, or ex
traordinary bounties to promote that increase, j
It has been found, hjwever, that the operation
ol the draft, with the high bounties paid for
army recruits, is beginning to affect, injurious
ly the naval servioe, aud will, if not corrected,
be likely to impair iu efficiency, by detaching
feamen from their proper vocation and Induc
ing them to enter the army. I therefore re,,
pectfully snggesHhat Cougreet. might aid both

I refer you to thereprrtof tbe Secretary of t'h^

useful and varied iMbrmatien in relation to
the public lands, Indian affairs, patents, n?n

tain ;ng to his department.
The quantity of land disposed of during the
las>t and the first quarter or th-< present fiscal
jear was three million eight hundred and for
ty-one tbonsand Ave hundred and forty-nine
hctpp, of which one hundred an1 sixty.one
thousand nine hundred and eleven acres'were
h>M for cash, one million four hundred and
nfty-rix thousand five hundred and f3urt?en
acres were taken up und-r the homestead la w
and the residue disposed ef under lawi grant
ing lands for military bounties, for railro* d
and other purpose*. It also appears that the
?alr of the public lands is largely on the in
crease. "
It has lor.g been a cherished opinion of
ofonr wisest statesmen that the people of th*
T nlted States bad a higher and more endurln z
interest m the early settlement and sub?tnntia7
< ult.vation of the public lands than in the
amount of direct revenue to be derived from
the sale of them. This opinion has had a con.
trolling influence in shaping legislation upon
the subject of onr national domain. I utav cite,
as evidence of this, the liberal measures a lopt
ed in reference to actual settlers : the grant to
the States of the overflowed lands within the r
?irait-in order to th^ir being reclaimed and
rendered fit for cultivation; tiie grants to rail
way companies of alternate sections of land
upon the contemplated lines of th-Jr reads i
which, when completed, will so largely muiti.
ply :he facilities lor reaching our distant pos
feetfcions. This policy has r? ceived its most '
?ig. al and beneficent illustration in the reel ut i

A mouth later the tloal proclamation came, in- '

It is also proffered that if, in any of the
States namrd. a State government shall t>e, in
the mod* prescribed, set up, such government
shall be recognise1! and guarantied by the
United Stat*-., and that under it the Stateshall,
on the constitutional conditions, bo protected
against in vtuluu and domestic violence. Tae
constitutional obligation of the United States*
to guaranty to e very State in the Union a re
publican form of government, and to protect
the State, in ?he cases stated, is explicit and
full. But why tender the bene (Jo of this pro
vision only foa State government set up in this
particular waj 7
This n-ction of the Constitution contemplates
a case wherein the element witnlu a State,
favorable to republican government, In tie
Union, may be too feeble for an opposite and
hostile element external to, or even within the
State; and such are precisely the cases with
which we are now dealing.
An atumpt to guaranty and protect a re
vived State government, constructed in whole
or in preponderate r part, from the very ele
ment against whose hostility and violence it is
to be protected: is simply absurd. There mast
be a test by which to separate the opposing
elements, so as to build only from the souud
ard that test is a ?ufflci~ntly liberal one,which
accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn
recantation of his former unsoundness
But If it be proper to require, as a test of ad
mission to the political body, an oath of alle
giance to the Constitution of the United State*
and to the Union under it, why also to the laws
and proclamations in regard to slavery? Tho^e
lawB and proclamations were enacted and put
forth lor the purpose of aiding in the suppie*.
slon ol the rebellion. To give them their fullest
efiect. there had to bea pledge for their miin
tennnce. In my judgment they have aid -d, and
will further aid, the cause for which they were
intended. To now abandon thr>m would be no'
omy to relinquish a lever of p.jwer, but wou d

or by any of the acts of Congress. For the*e
and other reasons it is thought best thit sup

lawfully claim it in r. turn for pardon and
restoration vf forfeited rights, which h.> ha*
clear constitutional power to withhold alto

deem wisest for tt.e public interest. It should
be observed, also, that this part of the oath is

Of legislation and supreme judicial decision

arrangement for the freed people is mad.* wita

deeply afflicted peopl? in those Stales may b><
somew.bai more ready to give up the cause of
their affliction, if, to this extent, thie vital mat
ter be lelt to thetnseyes; while no power of the
national Executive tc prevent an aouse is
abridged by tlie proposition.
The suggestion in the proclamation as to
xraintaining the political framework of the
States on w.hat is called reconstruction, is
made m the hope that it mav do gojd withou'
danger of haim. It will save labor, and avoid
great confusion.
But why ar.v proclamation now upon this

too long or be taken too soon. In some Sta*es
the elements lor resumption seem ready for

lnrctive, apparently for want of a rallying

the plan of B, rather than B that of A 1 And
if A and B should agree, how can they know
but that the general Government hrre wi;l re

Care has been taken to shape the document as to

yews and feelings remain unchanged : and I
trust that Congress will omit no fair opportu

1 n the midst of other cares, however import
ant, we must not lose sight of the fact tnat the
war power is still our mala reliance. To that

Gen. Butler, who seems to be moving with
characteristic vim in his new department, ha
just ieenrd an important order in relation to
negroes and nepro troops, dated Fortress Mon
roe. Dec. Sth. In thi% he says that the recruit
ment of colored troops has become the settled
pnrpote of :he Oovei ument, and it i= tnerefore
the duty ot e-v?ry tfflctr snd soldier to aid In
carrying oct that pnrpo-p, irrespective of per
sonal prfdilection. He therefore offers a bounty
of ?= 10 for every able-bodied colaredman who
shall enlist, to sappjy his immediate wants:
with a certificate of tnbtistence for his family
as scon as he is mastered.
The pay nsnal for colored troops is offered
with the prospect held out that Congress will
increase their pay uniform with that of white
troops. In order that such enlistments shall
not be discouraged, it is ordered that extra in
ducements of pay higher than for the-soldier
shall not be held out by officers for pay of
colored employees In the several Staff De
rarimente. No colored man competent for
military service will be employed by any
person in behalf of Government, mechanics
and i-kiiled laborers excepted.
<ien. Bdtier says that "political freedom
rightly defined Is libtriy to uarile and to he pro
tected in the full enjoyment of the fruits of
labor, and no one should enjoy thf? fruit* of
another'* labor," therefor* he orders that no
subsistence shall be permitted to any negro or
hLs family who ia able to work and doe* not
work.
Officers and soldiers are prohibited from Im
pressing negro labor for private purposes. Aj
every aegro who leaves the rebel lines and en
ters oura diminishes by so much the food and
labor-supplying power of the rebellion, it Is
ordered that officer* and soldiers aid by every
means in ihelr power the coming of all colored
people wlihin our lines; and any officer or sol
dier hindering colored men from eullatiag are
to be punished under the law "for obstructing

of Pennsylvania avenue and 11th street, was
discovered to be on lire, and the alarm beiug
raited, the fire companies were quickly on t&e

from an axe quickly caused it to be extin
guished. But lor the timely discovery it might
have been a most disastrous fire.
The fire caught from the range in the restau

to the wood work of the ceiling that the board*
