Secretary Fran ia reported to havecx-
pressed, the other day, a warm "sympathy
for the Cubans, but said there was no way
for aiding them without a violation of
law. ' j
Dos Piatt, in one of his recent letters,
very pointedly rcniindsi somebody; that
" ibe blicaf)0t iiilandirupy is that which
frees somlody else's nigger." '
The internal revenue"" oflicials are
having a good deal of trouble with the
illicit disljlkirs jn various parts of the
country, as will Ih- wrn from our dispatches.
The Radicals cling to the Frcedmen's
Bureau'with a desperation. It is reported
that a bill will introduced in Congress at
anicarly.da', providing for the consolida
tion of this institution with the" Indian
Bureau, placing both under the control of
the Department of the Interior.
TnE telegraph reports that tho excite
ment in the gold room in New York yes
terday approached nearer to that of Sep
tcnibcrthan any thing witnessed in Wall
street since the culmination of the gold
speculation ot that month. The " bull"
fraternity are greatly disgusted with Sec
retary Boutwell for accepting bids below
122. Some of the "bulls'" lose heavily
by the fall.
Tni: pressure was so great that Grant
could stand it no longer, and yesterday lie
withdrew the name of Ycainan, and ap
pointed S. L. "Whitley, of Michigan,
United States Judge ,of the sixth circuit.
TJie1Cincinn&ti Commercial says "a Kcn
tuekian of distinction" declared, "Wednes
day, that "there is not a more lojal and
high-toned gentleman, or a better lawyer
in Kentucky, than George II. Ycaman."
But this did not save him.
The woman's rights bill which ha
passed the Territorial Legislature of
"Wyoming, and been approved by the
Governorof that Territory, provides "that
every woman of the age of twenty-one
years, residing in this Territory, may, at
every election to be holden under tiie laws
thereof, cast her vote. And her rights to
the elective franchise and to hold office
shall be the same under the election law3
of tho Territory &3 those of electors."
Congress can amend this law, but it is not
likely that it will do so.
TnEjJadicals in Congress arc prepar
ing tofuniisli offices for a legion of their
IKiriisans.'' It Is noted that every effort
of economical members of thn House of
Representatives to put the work of tak
ing the census en the United State Mar
shals, or the internal revenue agents, has
been voted down, the object being to
create a new army of federal leeches fur
Hie purpose of making places for political
favorites of Congressmen, and doing
eomelhing to insure the re-election of
members.
Tmxos look squally in Ireland. Five
thousand additional troops of the line are
to lie immediately dispatched to the is
land, portions of Munster and of Ulster
ore to be "proclaimed" in a state of in
surrection, Ed "Membm of Parliament
will at once ask for power to suspend the
habeas corpus and to do all other exe
cutive acts in order to preserve the au
thority of law. How much easier,
cheaper and better it would be for the
English government to do full justice to
Ireland. They will have to do so in the
end, and they might as well anticipate the
inevitable, and obtain some degree of
credit for the result.
The Indianapolis Journal, the Radical
organ at the capital of Indiana, says of
Senator Trumbull's bill prohibiting re
commendations for office by members of
Congress, that he "voted against impeach
ment because he did not think he could
get any ajipointmrnts from Ben. Wade,'
and that now "he has no better luck with
Gen. Grant." The friends of the Illinois
Sfiiotor declare that it is well kuown that
be IiaS-net asked Grant for appointments;
that be has pursued go far during the
present administration, a course consist
cnt with his bill; and that he was so
thoroughly disgusted with the proceedings
around the White House, at the opening
of GrantVatlmlnislration, that he did not
make " single movement to even secure
the positions to bis friends who were
already in office, and if any of them are
feeding at the public crib now, it is not
Itccause Trumbull is keeping them there.
The Radicals will never forget Trumbull
for bis honesty in the impeachment trial,
and he must go by the board when the
proper time arrives. Honesty is not the
best jwliqy in the Radical party.
Tns "Columbus (Ga.) Enquirer colls
attention to two bills pending leforc Con
gress, which were introduced by promin
ent Radicalb : one to admit Georgia as a
Suite fully restored, when the Legislature
eh all ratify the proposed fifteenth amend
ment 1o the constitution of the United
Stales, and the other is to grant a general
amnesty when the fifteenth amendment
shall have been male a part of the consti
tution, and adds : The first of these is
virtually a bill to ymip f a State to adopt
that atnaffdiaiml.; the second is a hrihe
offured to leading and intluontij.1 politici
ans of the South to procure their support
of the amendment. . At any period of our
history prior to the acquirement of
altsolute power by the Radical
party, such weans of procuring an
amafiflment of' the fodsral constitu
tion would have been generally regarded
as infamous and revolutionary. They are
subversive of the great principle upon
which jiHeirjsevqJTmiPnl was based the
right of Hie people to form or change
their systm of government, without com
pulsion or restraint. The fact that such
monstrous Innovatjojis hs" those cmtem
platcdby these two bills can be proposed
in Congress without arousing the instant
and burning indignation of the whole
country, is a sad proof of the degeneracy

1 WAXIOWAE UANKS.
k We have again and again spoken of the
injurious, cffccuTpf ' the ' National Bank
system upon - tlio various industrial nur
suits.of tho country. Wohave spoken of
the imperative demand for a greater vol
utne ot currency We see", that time '6?
our jmanciers.proppsc to supply this de
mand by an increase, of .the number of
Rational Banks. Against this, we enter
our omphalic protest Already we are In
t ie. hands of the Philistines. The power
of -,theCNatiQnal Banks throughout the
country, In all the various departments of
government, State and national, i almost
irresistible. Directors -anil stockholders
in those institutions arc to be found in
every legislative assemblage. But a' few-
days since the Washington correspondent
of the Cincinnati Enquirer in comment
ing upon tho growing influence of. these
"banks upon the legislation of Congress,
raid :
"Die banks are stronger ia this Con
gross than in the last, winch, according to
Ben. Butler's count, contained sixty-fire
directors, i nave not been able to get at
the exact statistics of this matter for the
present Congress, but I am very positive
that there arc at least seventy-five nation
al bank directors now in the House. And
it is worthy of note that nearly every di
rector who was a member of the last
House has been re-elected, and is hcie
again. This shows the power of the na
itional banks in moving the political ma
chinery of the country, and it shows, too,
what we may expect when any struggle
involving their rights and privileges comes
up in Congress.
As another evidence of the influence
which National Banks have, we give the
following extract from the Cincinnati
Enquirer :
"The reader of Congressional proceed
mgs will have noticed that Mr. John A
Garfield, of Ihc Western Rescrveof Ohio,
the successor of Joshua R. Giddings, ap
pears to be tho leader of the bondholding
and National Bank forces in that body.
Who and what is Garfield ? He arose to
be a Brigadier General during the early
part of the late civil war. We have
heard that previous to it he was a pro
fesscd minister of the Gospel. At any rate
he was worth nothing pecuniarily, speak
ing after the fashion and manner of this
world. But in 18C2 he was elected to
Congress, and since then, during the past
seven years, lie has managed, on $-5,000
per year, to acquire a large fortune. His
estate and his monetary resources are said
to bo worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars. This increase in property was
simultaneous with his advocacy of the
monetary monopoly interests in the
House. Of course we make no charges.
But at the late election it was so well un
derstood among his Radical friends of the
Western Reserve that he was intimate
with New York capitalists, that if there
had been a reasonable chance they would
have brought out an independent candi
date and defeated him. Even in the Rad
ical district which he represents, his un
disguised employ by the bondholders has
created unusual disgust and dissatisfac
tion.
Even the President of the United States
is well understood to favor the Bank in
terest. In his message he recommends
the buying up of grecnbaclcs with the gold
in the Treasury, and thus withdraw them
from competition with the National Bank
notes. Would it not have been more in
accordance with the interests of the peo
ple, if he had recommended an increase of
greenbacks, and the redemption of bonds
bearing interest payable in gold. Green
backs are nothing more nor less tlian Gov
emmcnt bonds, and their excellence con
sists in their being used as a circulating
medium and they bear no interest. Upon
the contrary, the bonds, so-called, cannot
be used as a circulating medium, and bear
interest, a very large amount of which
is payable in gold. We suggest that
President Grant change his policy.
Let him recommend an incrcasi of
the little bonds, called greenbacks,
which bear no interest, and reduce the
amount of large bonds which do bear in
terest. If he will not do that, we beg
of him at least to recommend the repeal
of the ten per cent tax on the notes of
banks chartered by the State, thus
opening the way to competition with the
National Banks. If this were done .banks
would soon bo organized throughout the
South and the West which would com
mand the confidence of the people and
afford us the circulation that is abso
lutely essential to our prosperity.

The French paper in New York, the
Churricr des Etatt Unis, whose editor
wields a ready and trenchant pen, does
not suffer to pass unrcbuked the frequent
and bitter asssults of the New York
papers upon the alleged moral depravity
and political despotism of France. Re
cently the New York Times made the
return of Jeff. Davis to this country the
text of a " trooly loil" outburst against
the South, aud of superlative eulogy of
the magnanimity of the authorities of the
United States government, as contrasted
with the alleged political vindictivencss of
the Emperor of France. In the course of
its dissertation the Times observed :
"Jefferson Davis is henceforth free of
all public prosecution and private moles
tation. The fact is especially noteworthy,
as it happens just at the moment when
the revolutionarv chiefs of Western Eu
rope meaning France are encountering
new obstacles to political rehabilitation,
and arc subjected to fresh persecutions of
almost every kind. Tins difference docs
honor to our people and to our institutions
to our people, m that it shows that their
sentiments are guided by the elevated
principle of Christianity rather than by
the vile and vindictive instincts of the
savage; to our institutions, in that it shows
tliat they repose so largely on the moral
foundations which uphold them, without
the aid of the harsh penalties and intimi
dations which alone sustain the thrones of
the Old World."
The opening which the Times unguard
edly left for tho wide-awake Frenchman
to come in at, was promptly availed of.
The Courrier thus replies to the Times :
'Of such declamations, we say frankly
and firmly that they arc purely and sim
ply calumnies on the French people and
their institutions. To sav that the revo

Upon "the rc-oisembunsf of the joint con
vention in the afternoon, Representative
3IcCreery withdrew the name of Hon.
TJioi. C. McCreery'in the following; ap
p'ropriate remarks :
, Mb Speakee: One of the time-honored
principles of the Democratic party is that
ihc majority .shall control.. A gentleman
distinguished for his intellect, and known
all over -this; country for his purity of
character, received this morning at the
liands of this body, a majority of the vote
, cast by the Democracy for a United States
Senator to succeed the Hon. Thomas. C.
McCrccry. I am here, sir, the represen
tative x the Hon. T. C. MeCreery, and
desiring, as he. docs, harmony iii tho
Democratic party, and looking upon the
Vote of this morning as pointing to the
distinguished Governor of h-cntucuy, ne
has requested me to. wituuraw ma name
from before your body as a candidate for
tjio United States Senate, f Applause. In
doing this, I present to all those who
have supported him so kindly anti ' cor
dially, his profoundest thanks. Renewed
applause.
The report which we liave infoilits lis
that Messrs., Adams and Beck were then
also withdrawn, and John W. Stevenson
being tho only Democrat remaining in
nomination, a ballot wa3 had with the
following result: Stevenson, 117; Finley,
(Rail.) 10; L A. Spalding, 5 ; J. C. Breck
inridge, 1. Necessary to a choice, G7.
John W. Stevenson was. then declared
duly elected Senator elect.
Gov. Stevenson is a mau of ability and
will make a Senator worthy of his State
While we have no choice between him
and his most prominent competitor, wo
say: "All honor to Senator McCrccry."
The part that he acted was manly and
Democratic. He is glorious in defeat. Ilig
conduct is in striking contrast with those
Conservatives in tho Tennessee Legisla
ture, who went into caucus with the
Stokes Radicals to defeat the choice of a
majority of the Conservatives of the Gen
eral Assembly.
STOKES OX THE COXSTXTUTIOX
Recently Buck Lewis and some other
of our colored politicians addressed a let
ter to the Hon. Wm. B. Stokes, relative
to the election which is to bo held to-day.
The Honorable Representative favors his
friends with a reply, which we are sure
will prove entertaining, if not instructive,
to our readers :
AVasihsqton, Dec. 14, 16C!). To
Messrs. Sumner, Lewis aud others Gen
tlcmcn: Your letter in relation to tho
coming election ordered by the Legisla
turc has been received. In roy judgment
the whole movement in the wav of a con
vention is illegal, unconstitutional, void
and revolutionary ; the constitution and
laws having been wholly disregarded in
the late election, necesarilv making void
all laws passed by that illegal and uncon
stitutional body. The act calling a con
vention is an open violation of the Con
stitution of the State, for the reason that
it permits every male citizen, who is
twenty-one years of age, to vote, thereby
ignoring the State Constitution, and allow
ing every man to be a delegate in said
convention, regardless of the provisions
of the fourteenth article of the amend
ments to the Constitution. I refer you to
the Presidents message in relation to
Georgia and the course pursued
by Congress. Tennessee is m
like condition. If Congress can enter
any one of the States lately in rebellion
thev can safelv go into all of thoe lately
reconstructed. I have no hesitation in
saying that Congress possesses full power
to re-enter the late rebel btates and re
construct them again, and as often as the
constitution 13 trampled under foot and
the laws of Congress are set at nought.
What Congress will do I am unable to say
at this time, but one thing is certain, an
investication will be had concerning the
frauds and violations of the constitution
of the State. Congress cannot refuse to
investigate, as this is a national question,
which saps the foundation of republican
government. If J were at home 1 would
not go near the polls on the day of elec
tion. In a word, I would treat the whole
thing as revolutionary nnd in violation of
the Constitution and laws of the State and
the reconstruction actsof Congress. I am
truly sorry that our friends are running
candidates and thereby seeminnly makin,
themselves a party to this outraire. They
should have stood aloof and took no part,
and then those who claim to have control of
the State government could not have com
plained. I am truly yours,
Wm. B. Stoks.

The Chicago Tribune, the abbst and
most widely circulated Radical journal in
the Northwest, Bays that Senator Drake's
bill to virtually abolish the Supreme
Court, ought to ho entitled "A bill to
abolish the constitution, and a.Ms:
"The result would bo that no law of
Congress could be annulled for unconsti
tutionality, even though it might abolish
the State Governments, or provide for the
establishment of a hereditary monnrchy
We should have no constitution of the
United States, and each State Legislature
might, by a similar act of its own, abol
ish its constitution. It is not too much
to say that the member of cither houe
who is intellectually capable of introduc
ing such a bill deserves expulsion on the
exound of mental imbecilitv. He is nan
compos mentis."
The Albany Journal, the organ of the
Radical party at the capital of New
York, also denounces the proposed law as
"a scheme which would be fatal to the
liberties of the people." This bill, it snys
'might be appropriately denominated 'an
act to abrogate the constitution.' For if
Congress is to be the interpreter of the in
strument, we would some day find that a
reckless body would construe it to the de
struction of popular rights."

The correspondent of the New York
World writes from Washington under
date of Dec. 14:
"From Tennessee recent advices have
been received here to the effect that An
drew Johnson is in nowise dismayed or
cast down by the late election. He issaid,
on the contrary, to be in the most buoyant
and rosy frame of mind McGregor on his
native heath. The result of the election
has caused a very decided manifestation of
popular good will for the cx-President,
and a equal exhibition of displeasure for
the leaders by whose jealousy and ambi-
lon his defeat was secured. That he will
come up ngain is not doubted, or that he
will steadily increase his hold on the peo
ple. If Brownlow should die, it is said
the present Legislature would elect An

sulijrriitl to fri'sh persociitionp," at the

ever proclaimed effaces with one scratch i
of the pen all political condemnation?,
and opens the frontiers to all exiles, is aa
abuse of tho nirlit winch curtain writers
arrogate lo themselves of trifling with the
truth. As 'to the vile and vindictive in
stincts of the savage,' which are put by
this writer in contrast with the sentiments
of the American people and 'Hie elevated
principle of Christianity' which guide
them, wc can scarce believe that Mich ex
pressions, even from n pen so thoughtless,
could be applied to the French people.
Thank God we have not. as a people, to
lako lessons of generosity from the Amori-'
ran nconlo; and wc limit ourselves at
present to reminding the limes that the
manner in which, alter live years pacinca
lion, the vanquished of the South are still
treated, has no example in contemporary
history, except in the case of the subju
gation of Poland."
Thai is terribly severe coming 'from the
ri preaeutative of a government like that
of Francc.
cxpress great anxiety and fear regarding
the measures before Congress affecting
Georgia reconstruction. Besides the regu
lar Slate bonds, a large amount have been
issued, granting State aid to railroads, all
of which, tbey feel, will be seriously
and dangerously affected by Gov. Bul
lock's plan of Congressional interference.
Since the close of the war between three
and four millions of State bonds have
been issued, nearly all of which arc in
the hands of capitalists, who certainly
have a deep interest in seeing that no in
