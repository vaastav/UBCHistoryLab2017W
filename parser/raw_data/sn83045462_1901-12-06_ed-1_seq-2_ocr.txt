TOO Al IUlk IS Rs 3
Dr. Carr Tells About Experiments
With Powder and Bullets.
SHE WILL NOT TESTIFY
A scene which was positively disgusting
to persons of finer sensibilities occurred this
afternoon just outside the main entrance
to Criminal Court room No. 1, where the
Bonine murder trial is being held. A crowd
of fully two hundred persons crowded. about
the door after the court room was filled.
Men and women who were unable to gain
admittance stood there in the cold and their
laughter and boisterous actions could be
heard a block away. One might have
thought that they were bound for a river
excursion rather than a court room where,
with all the solemn dignity of such a place.
a woman -was being tried for her life.
The crowd within was composed in the
main of women. They forced themselves
forward when possible and occupied seats
of vantage. -
The probability of a continuance of the
offensive testimony brought out on yester
day. and which was totally unfit for print
ing. was what attracted such a morbid
rlement. Every question and answer was
watched with breathless interest.
The forenoon session was brief. Court
adjourned at 11 o'clock because of the ab
sence of former Coroner W. P. Carr. who
sent word that he had been called hurriedly
to the Emergency Hospital to perform an
operation. Dr. Carr was present when
court reconvened at 1:15 p.m., and he gave
testimony as to the condition, extent and
general effect of the wounds found in
Ayres" body.
Dr. Carroll. who was recalled at the be
ginning of the forenoon session, is con
nected with the Army and Navy Medical
Museum. and has a reputation as an ex
pert on blood that extends throughout the
country. In Cuba, several months ago, he
received considerable notoriety by inocu
lating himself with yellow fever through
mosquitoes in the interest of medical
science.
The bulk of his testimony was identical
with that of Dr. Ruffin regarding the find
ing of blood on parts of the wrapper worn
by Mrs. Bonine on the night of the tragedy.
The garment was again shown to the jury.
The testimony throughout both sessions
was of an expert nature. District Attorney
;ould interposed frequent objections and
the arguments that followed took up much
time.
Nirs. Bonine evinced less Interest in to
day's proceedings than on any day since
she was placed on trial. At one time, when
there was a brief delay waiting for dia
grams of the several floors of the Kenmore
Hotel. which were later placed in evidence,
the defendant turned to Mr. Keene of her
counsel and entered into earnest conversa
tion.
As on other days. members of Congress
and other distinguished persons were among
the spectators, several of whom at different
times occupied seats on the bench beside
Justice Anderson. There is a possibility
that the examination of witnesses may be
closed by temorrow afternoon.
Will Not Testify.
Mrs. Bonine will not go on the stand in
her own elehalf. In an argument late this
afternoon as to the admission of certain
testimony objected to by the district attor
ney Mr. Douglass. with emphasis and some
suggestion of passion, made this dramatic
statement: "Let me say that she," refer
ring to Mrs. Bonine. "has a legal and moral
right to go or to forego the privilege of go
ing on the stand, but I waht to say one
other word. My friend, .the district attor
ney, aiverts to there being but one person
in the world able to tell where she stood
when Ayres was shot.
"And It is not for counsel to criticise
now any more than to criticise when the
evidence is closed. I shall challenge his
right to do it, and have the q estion set
tied once for all. Let me say tt accord
ing to the testimony before this court and
jury this defendant has told an oft-ie
peated story about this matter-first, to
Detective Horne and, second, to the dis
trict attorney himself, having the right,
skill and experience to elicit from her all
that he possibly could if she were upon the
stand now."
Dr. Carroll Continues.
Immediately after the court was opened
this morning Dr. Carroll, one of the ex
perts for the defense, who was on the
stand when the adjournment was taken
yesterday, was called for additional exam
tnation. He declared that he found evi
dences of blood on a piece of velvet taken
from the now famous wrapper, claimed by
the defendant to have been worn by her at
the time of the shooting of Ayres.
I'nited States Attorney Gould inquired of
th'e witness if the latter had been informed
of the history and experiences of the wrap
per, and that the person who was alleged
to have worr. the gown had blood-drenched
hands at the time, and had fallen into a
pool of blood. Dr. Carroll replied in the af
tirmative.
In connection with the examination of Dr.
Carroll Attorney Fulton remarked that Mr.
Gould was always brief when the issue was
the presence of blood on Mrs. Bonine's
wrapper.
"Not at all." declared the United States
attorney. "The defense has had every op
portunity during the past six months to
discover blood on that wrapper. The gov
ernment is entirely satisfied with the re
suits."
A Reeess.
At this point Attorney Douglass an
nounced that unfortunately the defense
was in the position that made it necessary
to ask that a recess be taken. The situa
tion was wholly beyond the control of coun
sel. so stated Attorney Douglass. Dr. W.
P'. t'arr. one of the experts, it was ex
plained, had been notified to be In court at
10e ''clock this morning. The surgeon, how
ever. had unexpectedly been called to the
Emergency Hospital to perform an opera
tion in the hope of saving the life of one
of the men shot by Herbert Marx, near
Oak Grove. Va.. several days ago. Dr.
Boree was similarly engaged, while Dr.
Ruffin was in attendance on a patient who
was In a critical condition.
"Regretting the necessity for suggesting
the action." concluded Attorney Douglass,
"we must ask the court to take a recess
until our witnesses can come into court."
U'nited States Attorney Gould not object
ing Justice Anderson, at 10:.45 o'clock, di
rected a reces until 1 :15~ o'clock.
The large throng of spectators, many of
them women who had journey to the city
hail very early In the morning in order to
secure good seats, slowly and Alisapponted-.
Iy filed out of the room. The interim be
tween the adjournment and the resump
tion of proceeding.a this afternoon was
spent by Mirs. Bonine in the company of
her husband, her two sons, two sisters and
brother, in a comfortable room within the
caged inclosure in the basement directly
beneath the court room.
Dr. Car.' en the Stand.
In'.mediately after the opening of the at
ternoon session the defense called Dr. W.
P. Carr as a witness. He stated that he
has made a specialty of surgery, is a pro
fessor at Columbia University and is con
nected as surgeon with the Emergency
Mitland the Columbiaa University
Hospital. The witness stated that he has
had a large experience with gunshot
w'ounds, especiall while he held office, for
three years as coroner ef the District of
Columbia

lively AWgwinen.
Attorney Douglass inquired If a- perMe
located on the fire escape. otside the Win
dow, could fire into Ayres' room, and tak
ing into consideration the range jad the
bullet, infset' Sucn - wwoam no Awses re
ceived In the. bi, on a- person - noer the
entrance doorway of the room, btt ap
proaching the window..
Mr. Gould objected to the question on
the ground that Dr. Carr %d not prsn
ally examined the wound on Ayres' hip, and
should not be permitted to answer hypo
thetical questions relating to the Wound.
- Attotney Douglass argued that Dr. Glass
,brook for the government had testified
along the same line. He opposed the de
fense being cut of from this line of expert
testimony "for which the government has
set the pace."
"Mr. Gould now grow. weary of expert
testimony," remarked Attorney Douglass.
"Counsel accuses me of what is true of
the majority of the courts and the authori
ties.," replied Mr. Gould. "They are grow
ing weary of expert testimony. The ques
tion now before the court is one of com
,ion-sense, and of common experience. Any
member of the jury is as wel qualified to
answer it as is the witness. There is a
proper field for expert testimony In this
case-as to the distance an object fired at
would show smoke stains, the distance at
which it would be penetrated by powder,
and the distance at which there would be
Ignition."
Mr. Gould went on to say that the de
fense had no right to infer from the open
ing address to the jury In behalf of the
government that the person who fired the
shots was In the window and Ayres was in
the room.
In the course of a long argument Attor
ney Douglass declared that the govern
ment's representative had been wise enough
not to say in his opening that the shots at
Ayres had been fired from the window. In
conclusion Attorney Douglass said:
"If the United States attorney will agree
not to argue that Mrs. Bonine shot Ayres
from the fire escape we will withdraw the
question and meet the government in the
new position it may adopt."
United States Attorney Gould thereupon
waxed unusually earneaL and spoke in a
tone never befoee used during the trial.
"One person, and only one person now
alive, can tell where Mrs. Bonine was on
the occasion in question. I do not know
whether we shall hear from her lips where
she was, but It Is not for us to locate her
at any given time, at any given spot.
"When it comes to a question of frank
ness, I will ask the counsel if he was
frank when he placed the construction
he just did on our opening address.
"It is not for the United States attorney
or his associate to pass upon the facts of
this case," declared Mr. Gould, warmly.
"Our duty ends when we put all the facts
in our possession before the jury In a fair
way. Now I am getting just a little tired
of hearing -from counsel what the gov
ernment is claiming in this point or that
point. It Is for the jury to say what the
government has proven."
Attorney Douglass next spoke, and with
spirit. "Whether Mrs. Bonine goes on the
stand or not," he said. "it is not for coun
sel to criticise her action in that regard,
now or later. If he again adverts to the
matter I shall challenge his right to do so.
We say right now and here that we stand
upon the statement made by Mrs. Bonine
to Detective Horne. Mr. Gould and Major
Sylvester. If they think it false they have
had six months in which to prove it false."
The court sustained Mr. Gould's objection
to the question that caused the discussion,
and an exception was noted.
Other Questions.
"Would the position of the body of the
person receiving the wound have any ef
fect upon the distance the muzzle of the
pistol would- be?" Attorney Douglass then
asked.
"I imagine-" began Dr. Carr.
"Don't let your Imagination run away
with you, doctor," interrupted Mr. Gould.
"The doctor is not going to run away,"
declared Attorney Douglass.
"I'm au.ce the doctor would not run
away," added Mr. Gould. "I suggested
that he not let his imagination run away
with him."
"Well," said Attorney Douglass. smiling,
"if his imagination ran away with him he
would of necessity go with it."
"Figuratively only," remarkedlr. Gould.
The witness answered the question in the
affirmative.
The deifense next asked as to the probable
height of the muzzle of the pistol from the
floor in order to inflict the wound on Ayres'
hip, he standing at the time, and the pistol
being at a distance of twenty-four inches
from him.
Mr. Gould objected, quoting a decision
that physicians could not testify regarding
the position of the weapon by which a
wound has been inflicted.
The court adjourned at 3:05 o'clock until
tomorrow at 10 o'clock without disposing
of the question under consideration.
PHILIPPINE TARIFF.
Meeting of Republican Members of
Ways and Means Committee.
The republican members of the ways and
means' eoninittee had an informal meeting
after the House adjourned today.
It is understood that the firt work of the
committee will be on a bill to provide a
-Philippines tariff. It is probable the chair
man and several of his colleagues will go
over the subject carefully between now and
Monday and a meeting of the republican
members of the committee is expected Mon
day or Tuesday.
Messrs. Grosvenor, Hopkins and Steele
are unavoidably absent from the city to
day, but Mr. Grosvenor and Mr. Hopkins
are expected to return by Monday, in which
case a meeting wilt assuredly be held that
day or the next.
The outlook Is that a Philippines tariff
bill in tentative form will be ready to re
port to the full committee early next week.
The bill which the republican members
agree on among themselves in the mean
time will be presented to the full com
mittee and will be the measure reported to
the House. Just for form's sake, the per
fected measure may be first introduced In
the House and referred to the committee.
but at all events the probability is that
some kind of a Philippines tariff bill will
be on the calendar of the House before the
clcse of next week.
The republican members of the committee
are now considering the questIon of
whether the bill thesy report shall be a tem
porary expedient, to bridge over present
necessities, or whether they shall perfect a
more elaborate measure, treating with all
economical needs of the archipelago.,
ALL FOR CONFIRMATION.
Favorable Report to Be Made on At
torney General's Nomination.
The Senate committee on the judiciary
today authorized a favorable report upon
the nomination of P. C. Knox to be At
torney General. Opposition~to confirmation
is made by the Anti-Trust League, which
has filed a protest with the committee in
which especial complaint is made that Mr.
Knox failed to bring certain suits against
organizations said to he trusts which he
was urged by the league to institute. The
committee considered this document at
some length, but concluded that the Presi
dent should he afleed to choose his own
advisers, he being responsible for them.
The vote for a favorable report was unan
imous.
