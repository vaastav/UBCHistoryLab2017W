MISS ANNIE P. ALLEN, A. N. C.
some one I knew I never expected to
see him, 'traced him through a pa
tient of mine who said he was from
Camp Devens in the Signal Corps.
Right away I asked if he knew Tom
and he said there was a Pfeiffer in
his company so I told -nim to send
word by the first visitor he had for
Tom to come and see me, so tonight
he came, he is looking well and look
ed every inch a soldier. He is com
ing again when we can talk of our
experiences ai far as we have gone.
He said he had not heard from you
but I do not wonder, the way we get
mail here. I beat him over, for I
started in June.
We are very busy as we are so short
of nurses and no prospects of getting
any more. We have been having a
great deal of rain but I understand
nothing to what we will have. I dread
the cold weather. The Red Cross was
very kind to us gave us some good
warm clothing. How is Aunt Lucy?
Give her my love. We are hoping we
will see you before long and it seems
as though we would if things con
tinue the way they are at present.
It is amusing to hear what every
one is going to do when the war is
over, we will be about the last to
return. The Y. M. C. A. furnish mu
sic and entertainments for us and we
have plenty of dancing. Our food
is fairly good considering, although it
all tastes the same and corn, if I ever
get away from canned corn. I'll never
eat it again. I do not know what we
would do without rice, prunes, corn
or corn Willy. When traveling we
get hard bread that comes in pack
ages.
AVell we are in the army now and
must take everything as it comes un
tjj it is over.
Hoping to hear from you soon, as
ever.

Now. that the war is won, manv
Norwich citizens are asking why the
Red Cross is planning to moll the en
tire population of the di-srrict as mem
bers the week before Christmas.
Chairman Elien Learned of the lo
cal . evecutive committee of the Red
Cross Christmas Roll Ca'l organiza
tion makes the followinj; reply:
"Starvation, sickness and sorrow
did not vanish in Europe when the
fignting ceased. On the contrary, the
new conditions have revealed greater
opportunities for the American people,
through the Red Cross, to exted re
lief. This work is just as imperative
in peace as in war, though not . so
dramtic.
"Besides, Korwieh boyr, and boys of
the- other towns In this district, In
France or in home camps, with mil
lions of other Amesican soldiers, arid
sailors have a right to expect that
Red Cross service will be continued
for them in full measure until demo
bilization is completed. This means
the Red Cross must carry on for many
months, and the money raised through
menbership dues will help finance the
service."
All that is asked of anv adult! in the
Red, Cross Christmas Roll Call is that
he or she rhail have "a heart and a
dollar." ,Wnen you multiply these
hearts and dollars by th miilions of
adults in the United States, it is evi
dent that a substantial total will be
raised if the response to the Roll Call
is general.
Children will not be tniicited. as
they already are represented in the
school auxiliary, or w:ll enroll
through the auxiliaries at twenty-five
cents a year, but they will be valuable
aids in the Roll Call by reminding
their parents of the opportunity to
r-Kister approval of tho. greatest re
lief work in the history of the world
"The question has been asked,'.' said
Chairman Learned, "if thv National
Tuberculosis Association will conduct
its annual sale of Red Cross Christ
mas Seals this year. To that I would
answer that there will be no sale this
year. It se-mied - best "to both the
National Tuberculosis Asscciation and
to tho Red Cross War Council' to
abandon the Christmas Sial Campaign
this year and to unite in the Red
Cross Christmas Roll CalL Such a
combination of effort is extended in
no way to interfere with the vital
worlc ol the National Tuberculosis
Association, but merely to reduce the
number of national appeals' for con
tributions. To insure support of this
work during the , coming year the Red
Cross War Council has appropriated
l 500,000 for the work. No Christmas
Seals are to be sold this year and the
National Tuberculosis Association 'and
its state branches are calling on all
representatives who formerly sotu
Christmas. S'.als to co-operate with the
Red Cross chapters in conducting the
Red Cross Christmas Koll Call,
In an announcement of the opening
6f the Red Cross Christmas roll call,
Henry .P. Davison, chairman of the
,war council of .the American. Re&
Cross issued tp the 3,854 chapters and
the 22,090,000 Members of the Ameri
can Red Cross the following state
ment outlining the future policy of
the American Red Cross: .
"The whole American people will be
invited in the week preceding Chrjt
mas to enroll as members of the Red
Cross. It is confidently believed that
there need be no further campaigns j
for Red Cross funs, but instead, the
annual roll call will constitute the
foundation of the Red Cross. The peo
ple should, therefore, know as definite
ly as possible the plans of this, their
national humanitarian society.
"Since the arm;tice was signed I
have had an opportunity confer in
Paris with the heads of all American
Red Cross commissions in Europe and
later in Washington with the president
of the United States, the war council
of the Red Cross, the managers of the
fourteen Red Cro--i divisions of the
United States and with the heads of
our dartments at national head
quarteTs. i -1 am, therefore, able . to
speak now with knowledge and assur
ance in saying that the benefit work
of the American Red Cr.oss is to go
forward on a great scaled not alone,
as heretofore, for purposes of relief in
war, but as an agency of peace and
permanent humane se 'ce. , ' ,
"Since American entry into the war,
the purpose of our Red Crols has been
primarily to aid our army and navy
in the care of our own men ender arms
and, secondly, to extend relief to sol
diers, sailors and civilians of thee
nations which were fighting our bi-
tles along with their own. With the
funds which have been so generously
contributed by the American people.
this war work of the Red Cross will
continue and be complete with all
possible sympathy and enenf.
w nerever our soldiers and sailors
may be, the Red Cross will stay with
them xuntil they are demobilized.
Nothing which We may do will be lei?
undone, either for the men in the waf
zone, for those returning, for those in
the camps and hospitals, or for their
families at home, to whom will con
tinue to be devoted the ministrations
of the Red Cross home service. In
this latter effort 50,000 trained Red
Cross workers are now engaged at
2,500 different places throughout the
land.
"The problems of reconstruction, in
volving the feeding and caring for the
distressed civilian pop ilation of Eu
rope are of such magnitude that
necessarily they must be met very
largely by the governments of our
aHies with whom our own government
will co-operate.
"The great task of fighting tubercu
losis, promoting child welfare and
caring for refugees, with . which the
American Red Cross has concerned it
self so effectively in France, Italy and
Belgium, will at an early date be as
sumed by the governments, the ' Red
Cross organizations and the relief so
cieties of those countries which, nejw
that they are released from the ter
rific burden of waging war, naturally
desire to take care, as far as they can,
of their own people.
"The war program of the American
Red Cross will thus steadily and rap
idly merge itself into a peace program.
The wake of the war will, however,
reveal the prevalence of disease and
give rise to epidemics and emergencies
which in all parts of the world will
cal for unlimited, voluntary effort.
The cuttins of red tape and the mani
festation of those qualities of human
sympahy which government action
cannot display.
"Here will be the opportunity for the
American Red Cross. But even our
Red Cross, must not act and cannot
act most effectively alone; we must
labor in co-operation with the Inter
national Red Cross and relief societies
of other nations to the end that not
alone the heart of America but the
heart of all Vk'nd may be mobilized
on behalf of suffering humanity.
"The war has developed the striking
and important fact that r:iany men
and women, some of whom have with
great success devoted their lives en
tirely to business, came into the Red
Cross organization at the outset of the
war simply that they might serve
their country, but have realized such
a satisfaction to themselves in the
opportunity to serve mankind that
they now desire to become a part ot
the permanent peace organization of
the American Red Cross. There 'may,
therefore, be perfect confidence that
the peace activities of the Red Cross
will be conducted under able and in
spiring leadership.
"Study is being given by the nation
al organization not alone to problems
of international relief but to plans in
this country for enlarged home ser
vice, the promotion of public health
education, development of nursing, the
care and prevention of accidents and
other corelated lines, which may con
tribute to the healta and happiness of
men, women and children. Such plans
when- developed will it is believed,
provide both for world relief and for
home commcnity serVice, and thus
constitute a channel for the" continued
and useful expression by Red Cross
workers and members of those quali
ties of sympathy and aove which our
whole people have poured out so un
stintedly during this war.
What the American Red Cross
needs now is not so much contribu
tions of money as the continued de
votion and loyalty of its members.
This is peculiarly true at this moment
of transition from war to peace. An
nual membership involves the payment
of only one dollar. The moneys thus
received not only defray all the. ad
ministrative expenses of the organiza
tion but leave a substantial balance
which, together with all funds sub
scribed directly for relief, are devoted
solely to that purpose.
"The roll call of the nation is thus
to be called at Christmas time, that
through enrollment inv their Red
Cross the American people may send
a message to our soldiers still over
seas and to the peoples of the world
that we are not merely content with
seeing our arms united with our allies
in victory, but that our raiding pur
pose is that the love, the sympathy
and the intelligence , of -all America
Shall be rededicated to the permanent
service of mankind." . i ,
