WHICH?
As you go by train westward from
&he city of St. Louis you note a long
pne of tall towers leading off to the
morthwest.
The towers are built to bold the big
gables that are to convey electric pow
W from the Keokuk dam to the city.
The big dam is nearly 200 miles
away, and the power will be conveyed
long seven copper cables running over
$he towers.
Sixty thousand horsepower will be
transmitted from the power house at
Keokuk to turn the wheels of hun
dreds of St. Louis factories and pro
vide light for the city.
St. Louis has contracted for this 60,
000 horsepower, which will leave 140,
000 to be distributed to other cities.
And
, If the demand exceeds this supply
other turbines will be put in sufficient
to double the capacity and make it
400.000 horsepower.
t There was no especial problem In
getting this power to St. Louis.
; Here was the need; there was the
power. All that was required was
proper connection between the need
and the power.
However
One never ceases to wonder not only
at the mysterious phenomena of the
hidden power in electricity, but at the
possibility of conveying this tremen
dous power hundreds of miles by wire.
But why wonder?
Here is a man of wonderful power.
."Where does he get it? Where is the
great dynamo with which he Is con
nected? What Is the connection?
I The power is not wholly In the man
himself.
' Every man who has studied himself
well knows there is a power outside
of himself, that somewhere in the uni
verse is a dynamo with which he is
more or less connected.
What is that power?
He does not know any more than he
knows what electricity is. He can
name It, but he does not know it.
. But-
1 He does know there Is an infinite
power house through which power is
diffused. ,
And
' Which is the more wonderful, the
distribution through visible connection
of a physical power or the invisible
connection with an Invisible power?

HUMAN ALBINOS.
Even Their Interior Organs, Brain In
eluded. Lack Color. -
There Is no race of human albtnos,
end the albino appears in nearly all
races. Latin albus means white in
KngMgT The word albhao is applied
to white plants and white animals.
Specifically when we hear the word
we think of white humans men or
women without color. In a full or
complete albino (human) all pigment
or color Is absent In the skin, in the in
terlor organs and even In the brain
White negroes and Indians exist, as
well as in Caucasian or "white races,
some of these being quite dark.
A total albino has a white epi
dermis or skin and also white hair ami
red eyes, due to the absence of pig
ment In the membranes of the eye,
which Is for the purpose of screening
light that is too bright for the retina
that is,' in albinos; others can see thu
retina in the rear of the eye, and thin
appears to be red.
Albinism Is not a disease, nor are th
minds of albinos weaker than thosu
of others. White blackbirds, mice
hares and birds are albinos. And ther.
.white elephants are sacred and wor
shiped by some races in Asia. Ex

Only a Week 's Vacation.
Richmond public school children are to have only one week's vaca
tion during the Christmas holiday season. The time honored custom of
giving two weeks' parole from those exacting masters. Reading. 'Riting
and 'Rithmetic, during the happy Yuletide has been rudely violated and
there is many a cheerless young heart in Richmond today.
The explanation for the shaving down of the Christmas vacation to
one brief week Is that the school authorities desire to dismiss school one
week earlier in the summer.
Can it be some of our teachers desire to spend a week longer in Eu
rope next summer?
However, be that as it may, a loud juvenile protest has arisen over
the school authorities' appropriation of five school days from one of the
happiest periods of the year.
Really the action of the powers-that-be in our schools does not ap
pear to be a wise move. The children have been in school now for three
months and after the first of the year they must be in school five and a
half months' more. Two weeks of rest and holiday fun, it seems to us,
would be beneficial to the youngsters and make them brighter and fresher
for the almost half year of toil with their studies which lies ahead of
them. Also, it seems to us, the summer vacation is long enough now
without adding one more week to it.
Will all the children in favor of two weeks' vacation during the
Christmas holidays kindly raise their hands.
Promotion to Goethals.
President Taft has had a happy thought.
He has suggested to congress that a certain soldier, Colonel Goe
thals of the Engineering Corps, be promoted to the rank of major-general.
Undoubtedly congress has been so busy of late playing politics and
tapping pork barrels that it has merely overlooked recognizing the ser
vices this modest soldier has performed for the benefit and glory of his
country, and now that the president has called its attention to this over
sight we anticipate congress will pause in its trials of alleged judicial
crooks and cease debating over the Squedunk post office appropriation
long enough to. bestow upon Col. Goethals a rank which carries with it
enough salary that the distinguished builder of the Panama Canal, the
greatest engineering feat In the history of the world, can have enough
funds to return to the states occasionally.
What a disgrace it would be if Col. Goethals was added to the al
ready long list of victims of the "ingratitude" of this republic.
This officer of the engineering branch of the regular army has per
formed a task which was abandoned by some of the most distinguished
engineers In the world. After the repeated failure of these experts to ac
complish results and "stick on the job" President Roosevelt, disgusted,
turned to the army and crisply ordered that efficient service to take over
the work of constructing the "Big Ditch." Without blare of trumpeets or
the rantings of press agents Col. Goethals went to Panama and with
military precision and affectiveness took over the work and the dirt has
been flying like a Sahara sand storm ever since, and the canal will be
Inished at least a year ahead of the time scheduled. Practically all of the
excavation has been completed and the locks which have been constructed
are masterpieces; also the Panama Canal Zone is the most healthy strip of
territory to be found In the tropics, and Is being fortified like a Gibraltar.
Goethals would be the highest salaried engineer in the world if he
could be tempted to leave the army. But he is a soldier and the blandish
ments of civil life do not appeal to him. He has not even asked for promo
tion in the service he has brought so much honor to, but that is no reason
why Colonel Goethals should not be made a major-general and placed In
command of the army engineering corps.
We respectfully submit to Congressman Gray for his careful consider
ation the following parapraph culled from President Taft's latest message
to congress:
"As the completion of the canal grows nearer and as the wonderful
executive work of Colonel Goethals becomes more conspicuous in the eyes
of the country and of the world It seems to me wise and proper to make
provision by law for such reward to him as may be commensurate with the
service that he has rendered to his country. I suggest that this reward
take the form of an appointment of Colonel Goethans as a major general
In the army of the United States and that the law authorizing such ap
pointment be accompanied with a provision permitting his designation as
chief of engineers upon the retirement of the present incumbent of that
office."

Benjamin Franklin once wore his
wig in his pocket at the court of Ver
sailles. When he was about to present
himself at the court for the first time
he was informed that a wig was essen

no ordinary wig would begin to fit it.
However, one was found sufficiently
large to pass him through the ante

Origin of Croquet.
The origin of croquet is certainly In
volved in mystery. Some authorities
are of the opinion that it is founded on
the old game of "pale maille," or pell
mell, from which we have the street
Pall Mall. This is described by Cot
grave in his dictionary as "a game
wherein a round box bowle is with a
mallet struck through a high arch of
yron," and a picture of this in Strutfs
"Sports and Pastimes" shows that
these had a strong resemblance to the
croquet implements of today.

Dr. Hartman Speaks About
Catarrh of the Lungs
Quite a stir in
medical circles
was produced by
Dr. Hartma n's
last article in
which he refers
to the remarkable
cure of Mrs. Eb
erlein, of Pitts
burg. The impres
sion prevails that
Dr. Hartman
claims to be able
to cure incurable
diseases. A report
of these state-
S.B.H ARTM AN.M.D. ments reached
Columbus, Ohio the doctor's ears.
As soon as he heard what people were
saying he was very quick and em
phatic in his denial of any Intent on
his part to creat such an impression.
No. said the Doctor, I do not claim to
have any magical cures. I do not
claim to have a cure for anything.
Judging from the number of letters I
receive, however, concerning Mrs. Eb
erlein's case, from people who have
similar complaints, I should judge that
catarrh of the lungs is very prevalent.
The number of people afflicted are in
creasing. In spite of the strenuous ef
forts of health boards catarrh prevails
more and more every year.
No, I do not claim to have a mir
aculous cure. I only recite some of
the things the people tell me who take
Pe-ru-na. The case of Mrs. Eberleln,
for instance. She was apparently dy
ing of catarrh of the lungs. Her phy
sician had told her so. Many people
who had seen others die under similar
conditions thought her to be dying.
She commenced taking Pe-ru-na and
recovered.
Now, I do not undertake to explain
her recovery. I certainly do not un
dertake to say that Pe-ru-na will cure
anybody in the last stages of catarrh
of the lungs. I make no such claim.
But I do undertake to say this. As
long as there Is life there Is hope. The
doctors are liable to be mistaken. They
often condemn people to die when they
do not die. They say, "Mrs. So- and
So cannot live twenty-four hours," and
then Mrs. So-and-So gets well. They
say, "Mr. So-and-So has not a ghost of
a show of living," but Mr. So-and-So
gets well. Now, what Is It that cures
such cases?
Every doctor knows that it is the
vitality of the patient. The last grain
of vitality was not exhausted, just
enough vitality left to make one more
struggle, and the disease was over
come. Now, it may happen that Pe-ru-na
is taken at the critical moment in the
patient's struggle against disease. The
patient may have been losing ground

Smokeless Gunpowder.
Smokeless gunpowder as now made
is not a powder, but a hard, hornlike
material made into grains of consid
erable size. Our American smokeless
powder, which is made in the form of
mnltiperforated cylinders, burns in a
cannon at the rate of about the six
teenth of an inch in the sixtieth of a
second, or at the rate of altout four
inches a seooud.
every day. At last the fight seems '
'hopeless; death inevitable. Someone:
I suggests Pe-ru-na. The patwient takes ;
. it without any hope. The medicine ac-
i tually does infuse new life into the
j circulation. They feel its genial in-
i fluence as soon as it is swallowed,
j This constitutes the turning point in
; their disease. The little assistance
which Pe-ru-na gives Nature at this im
! portant point turns the tide of affairs
l in favor of the patient.
j Not that Pe-ru-na cures incurable
diseases. No, not at all. But Pe-ru-na
does lend a little much-needed assist
ance at a time when a feather weight
ou one side or the other of the balanc
es turns the scales in favor of or
against the patient. Scores and scores
of times Pe-ru-na has come In at these
critical moments and saved patients
from imminent death. At least it !
seems so. I have bushels of letters I
reciting such things.
Pe-ru-na is a diffuse stimulant. It
stimulates the circulation. It causes
a warm glow of health to pervade the
mucous membranes of the body. The
alimentary canal, kidneys, bladder,
lungs, all the mucous membranes are
apparently revivified, rejuvenated, re-
endowed with the glow of health. That
is what Pe-ru-na will do. And this oft
en saves life. There can be no doubt
of it.
Whether the case be one of catarrh
of the lungs or any other chronic pros
trating illness, the right stimulant at
the right time. In the right doses, does
the work. Explain it as you may, such
things are happening every day.
I prefer not to use the word cure.
I do not like the sound of it. I do not
like the idea that people generally at
tach to the word. But that Pe-ju-na
helps Naturesometimes when she is
sadly In need of help, that I know to be
the truth. That is exactly what occur
red In the case of Mrs. Eberlein, the
account of which has caused so much
comment. i
If I or any of my immediate rela
tives had catarrh of the lungs, Pe-ru-na
would be given a thorough trial, I
assure you. That being the case, I
can conscientiously advise any one
else to do the same.
