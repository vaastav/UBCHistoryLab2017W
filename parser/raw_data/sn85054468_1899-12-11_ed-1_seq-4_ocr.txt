1 It b i most pleasing evidence of the
ivwrtu of a change in the Democratic lead
ership of tbe House of Representatives that
at the first clash between the parties on
tne floor. Mr. Richardson has succeeded
to patting the Republicans In an attitude
sttrieb ther are practically compelled to
admit i Indefensible
Demoralised by popular waves of ex
ehesnent and hysteria, and with timid eyes
looking back over their shoulders at clam
erous home constituencies, they have been
cared and prodded into the political blun
ter of denying to a legally-elected mem
ber his seat, and to one of the States of
the Union its constitutional representation
Whatever hereafter may be proven as to
Srtghsm H. Roberts' unfitness to remain m
the House is not pertinent to the present
aitaatton. He was regularly elected to
Congress, and, by virtue of that election,
app oared to bte nmee as the sole repre
sentative of a sovereign State He was as
i en entitled t be sworn in oa his .ap
pearance as was Speaker Henderson, Mr
Xadmrdsoa, Mr. Tayler, or any one of the
other three honored and fifty-three mem
bers to whase seating as ebyeeiien was of
iftrafi, There is not a lawyer en either side of
Use House who doss not know that the
vote denying a seat to Mr. Robert, who,
est the strength of his credentials, and. in
the utter aim cute of proof that he was not
legally elected, and was at the time of such
election not & citizen of the United
'Slates of proper age, was an inex
euweble and dangerous mistake, and not
that alone, but -a. Ytetatkm of at least -the
spirit of the Constitution There is not a
KfpabUran lawyer in the body today who
ones' not realtae this fatty, aad who would
not, if be could or dared, recall the hasty
action to ouesttar The best Indication
ot this is found in the evident floundering
M. the Tayler committee aad its obvious
desire to find some way to avoid the final
of a precedent In principle
too subversive of one of the chief sate-
aroa thrown around our scheme of rep-1
reneatatlre government to be tolerated
-jrtthout menace to the whole fabric
We are not arguing the case of Roberts,
except as tt happens to be incidental to
the greater one of institutional integrity
aaainst pontic outcry. If the evidence that
the present claimant is in fact a polyg
amirt, and es such is a criminal in the eye
at Aaglo-8axon civilisation and American
hrw. there should be no trouble whatever
fa aecuriag the tnajont necessary u expel
Mas from Congress. But, assuming hie
criminality, be still has initial rights, and
so has the State which has commissioned
hhn its representative St is no answer to
4hh proposttkHt to say that polygamy is
a Moral atrocity that one guilt of it
not be allowed to take a seat in
Castgreas no matter bow legitimate his
casta to one may appear under the forms
of few and procedure adopted and designed
to cover the cases of all members-elect
alike- U Roberta or any other recognised
member-elect were chargeable with crimes
or subject so dasahtlirJes the law and the
rales provide means for their judicial as
certainment and power to expel one found
unfit for membership But, in the mean
ttaae that respect which is due to a coc
stftueat American State demands that its
ants and credentials when regular .on teeir
Aaoe, shall have credit and acceptance.
la abort, while there is apparent ground
Jfcr the belief that Brigham H. Roberts
jfijanlft not be allowed to hold his seat in
she House of Representatives for a single
any alter talcing it, there is no doubt
viMtever that be is entitled to be sworn
in as a member, and to be beard in his
atra defence from his seat oa the floor on
a motion to expel him. la any event, it is
parhaps not Improper to warn the House of
XapreseaUtives that it needs to be careful,

4hat it does not at the same time violate
the Constitution of the United States.
The Ulterior Motive
although the continuous performance of
wsrtous self-appointed agitators in Cuba is
apt aUiaatag. H is indicative of pernicious
natives aad rank ingratitude. The eifer
aBoent heroics of these men. who by
Hlf lUsn occupataon are prevented from
maaipoUting the affairs of the island in
gheir own way smack of a vicious senti
shant. which they hope to conceal beneath
'the mask, of professed patriotism

'Sam which ambitious idlers ta most Latin
jhouatries get their livings.
The pr plc of Cuba, the people who are

change la the hereditary temperament of
the masses It is inimical to their enda
and ambitions People who learn to think
are not greatlv impressed by emptj words
and idle professions especially from thobe
who seem to have nothing to do but de
claim about imaginary wrongs
The bitter impatience of the treacherous
element in Cuban affairs is easilv under
stood But no amount of barking and
growling will hasten the departure of the
Americans from an island that was never
in greater need of a sturdj opposition to
influences that are a menace to the public

inflexible determination that characterized
her operations in the war with Spain
Iliidinr the President' Business.
It appears that some Methoaisls. in Har
risbnrg. Fa, for whom Mr S C Swallow
is spokesman, are considetablj wrought up
ocr the fact that President McKinle i
not a strict teetotaller and rampant pro
hibftioaiet Their minds have been freed
in a document intended for general distri
bution, which is, to say the least, abusne
and undignified in tone, and eincet. an
utter lack of decent respect for the resi
dent of the United States
With an air of intense surprise and dis
gust, Mr Swallow announces that Mr Mc
Kialey "admits that he supplies liquors to
his guests," and that certain estimable
gentlemen "allese" that the saw him drink
things which might intoxicate, on the oc
casion ofa. certain banquet It is alco re
marked that Mrs McKinle told tte ladies
of the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union that she would manage her own
table in her own way All this Is inter
esting, and suggests that, despite his oflice,
the President is Aerj much like anj other
American gentleman in conforming in a
general wa, to the harmless and time-
honored conentions of ordinarj society.
Sensible people will certainU see no rea
son whj Mrs McKinlej should not "manage
her own table in her own wav" as other
ladies do, aad they will regard it as im
pertinent, to put the matter mildlj, that
anyone should attempt to dictate to her on
that subject If the wife of the Piesident
chose to regale her guests on peacock
served ta the skin, or on an old-fasnioned
boiled dish, it would be the business of no
body in the land sae her own famil and
guests "When people who will neer, by
an chance, be mited to a dinner at the
White House, or come within miles of
knowing the conditions under which the so
cial life of official societj is carried on.
undertake to dictate to the President what
shall be his bill of fare at his own table,
the spectacle is absurd to the last degree
Whatever the feelings of any President may
be on the subject of teetotallism or anj
other matter which is hkelv to come up in
social intercourse, it is he, and not the in
habitants of Harrishurg, or Topeka, or Tuba
Dam, who must be held responsible for
what goes on his o.n house, and nat
urally he may be supposed to understand
what his guests need for their entertain
ment rather better than, the people in the
backwoods of Arkansas are likely to under
stand it. In short, he has been placed in
the While House to entertain guests of the
nation, as well as to execute its las, and
he is supposed to know how to gie a
dinner without adilce from Mr Swallow or
any other worth citizen of the United
States.
The remarks of Mr Swallow, as has
been hinted, are more 11 el than cour
teous He finds fault with the President
for "touching his lips" to the wine lass
when at a formal dinner, and declares that
1 this is, more reprehensible than becoming
intoxicated himself, feince he
tlfus in
duces young men to drink oung men
laugh t' o reverence their pledge made at
God's altars." We have here the srec
facie of Mr. McKinley as a wily Judas,
dragging into the primrose paths of temp
tation the youths of the Diplomatic Corps,
despite the, blue ribbons which the wear
in their buttonholes and the pledges which
they took in their innocent childhood It
is rather funny, when one considers 11 its
bearings
It ma be stated in a general waj that
Mr Swallow and others of his ilk suffer
from having no sense of proportion Else
where In his article this Daniel come to
judgment remarks that a Methodist Bishop
committed the heinous ofience of going
to church in the street cars when he might
hate walked Evident! J he thinks that
that is next door to chicken stealing Mr
McKiniey undoubtedly shares in this error,
driving to church on Sundaj now and then
But the country at large is not quite ready
to condemn him to everlasting disgrace on
that account. The fact is that provincial
people really have no right to expect that
their ideas shall be imposed on the whole
nation Perhaps, at "iuba Dam it is Cus
tomary to proe one's -valor and good
feeling by shooting suspicious strangers
on sight; but if Mr McKInle conformed
to that standard in Washington he would
be arrested.
The South African Situation.
The English howitzers with a suppl of
lyddite ammunition for them are in South
Africa at lasL Six have been sent to Lord
Methuen and Sir Redvers Buller has re
ceived the other twelve The bridges at
Modder and Trerc are in condition for use
Xo reason appears why active operations
should not be begun at once The world
is waiting anxiousl for the impending
battles, which promise to be decisive and
bloody.
The situation south of Kimberley grows
in interest Yesterday some of the London
militar writers adopted a theory advanc
ed In these columns two weeks ago, name
ly, that Methuen will not attempt to carry
the fortified heights at Sptfontein, but
will make a turning movement by Jarobt
dal, thus threatening Bloemfontein as well
as giving him the advantage of open coun
try and a route to Kimberle but a trifle
longer than that by the railwa line It
would seem, a natural course to take on the
evidence of the military maps.
Just what the actual conditions In Meth
uen's rear and on his lines of communica
tion may be. it is hard to conceive Re
ports from the scenes of Gatatre s and
French's operations are very general in
character, and do not convey much infor
mation. The do however, indicate a
serious state of affairs in Northern Cape
Colony Rebellious ajmptoms among tho
Afrikanders continue to spread and this
fact has much to do with the delaj in get
ting to -ork But piobably an advance
from Modder will not be longer postponed
The reported movement of General Trench
from Kaaaw Poort on Colesberg no doubt
is timed to coincide with one Intended by
Methuen, and to prevent the Boers in the
northwest of the colon from goingto
Cronje's assistance or attacking the com
munications south of the Orange River.
British prospects look slightl) brighter
in Natal. A successful bortie from Lady
smith, resulting iu the destruction of two
, Botr guns and the capture o a Maj.tmr
shows that the garrison is still in fighting
condition, and seems to increase the prob
ability that it will be able to co-operate
eftecthol with the relielng column when
the latter has crossed the Tugel i Kier
There seems to be some ground for believ
ing that Bullers forward moement was
designed to begin esterday or toda There
should be news of fighting on one of the
flanks of Colenso immediateU But the
press censor is sitting so firmlv on the
cable that wc bhall get details onl as
and when Sir Redters chooses to turn them
loose There is one admirable quallt
though m the Buller censorship What he
does allow to leak is news He does not
conceal himself in n distant palice and
keep the wire hot Ijing about what may
be going on in a field of distant and un
known proportions
Members of Congress and others are
continually propositig special medals of
honor for officers and soldiers who hae
performed sonic specified service or nave
distinguished themselves at some desig
nated place or in peculiar circumstances
All this is well enough, but it would be
much better for the Government to adopt
a regular medal sjstem as all of the other
leading States have done long ago In the
British ami for instance ever officer
and man who goes through a campaign I
:
Knows that if he survives, he will lecelve
a silver medal for that campaign, and it
it incudes a number of battles in ench of
hich his regiment or command has been
engaged each of these events will be rep
resented b a clasp duly engraved Our
Congressional medal of honor serves a
good purpose and should be retained, but
it does not cover enough ground We
should have at least three distinct military
medals, with authont to the President to
confer them on proper occasion There
should be one onl to be conferred for
actual and unusual heroism in battle, an
other for distinguished individual service
in war, and still another for general war
service We have plenty of silver in the
Treasur, and engravers and die elnkers
over in the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing The militar committees of the
two houses ought to get together and pre
pare a measure to sstematize the medal
business
The wave of un-Americanism that was
reported some time ago as sweeping over
the South eithci has spent its force oi
never eisted The action of the Southern
Cotton Spinners Convention, heartily en
dorsing expansion, a big niv and force,
if need be, to keep China's door open, was
fairl good proof that the teachings of
Most, Hoar, and Schurz had not taken
deep root iu the section We have addi
tional evidence in the same direction, in
reports from Alabama, which state that
members of the Legislature favorable to
the re-election of Senator Morgan are be
ing nominated generall in the Democratic
districts of the Commonwealth Honest
Democrats ever where are Americans to
the core, and no man can be that and not
support the true Jeffersonian and Jack
sonian doctrine ot national expansion.
The killing of the Tagal commander of
Agumaldo's bodyguard by Major March's
battalion of the Thirty-third Infantry is
likely to produce confusion as to the iden
tlt of the person killed We notice that
some of the newspapers seem to think he
was the so-called General del Pilar who has
been the principal Filipino commander In
the field. This is a mistake The dead
rebel was Gregorio del Pilar, and the other
and important native Is his brother or
cousin, Pio del Pilar.
There reall docs seem to be some re
mote chance that Agulnaldo will be, cap
tured although we still think it is not a
brilliant one The force with which he is
supposed to be present in the northern
mountains has been headed off, and is re
ported as safel trapped between various
living columns of our troops But Agulnal
do personal! ought to be able to slip out
and reach the coast, unless he is afraid of
the natives, who, if the recogni7ed him
would either kill or hold him for ransom
As It is not probable that our authorities
want him badl enough to bu him his
head might deLorate a Negrito shack pole
before long Perhaps under those consid
erations Aguinaldo might think it wise to
surrender If he onl knew it, he might
find a warm welcome in Boston, should he
manage to reach that cit of refuge No
doubt he could earn a handsome income in
New England in peddling anti-imperialist
tracts and Atkinson s Aladdin lamps
The story is rather a wild one, but
Aguinaldo s friend Pulitzer gives currenc
to a report that Macrum, latel our Consul
at Pretoria, is coming home with a confi
dential message from President Kruger to
President McKinlev, asking the latter to
propose the intervention of the United
States in South Africa on the ground that
such action would immediate! operate to
unite the European Governments in a
movement of active interference It is
ver appardnt that President Sten is not
the only man In the world who ought to be
in St Elizabeth's Obviousl, either Pu
litzer or Macrum has a very violent attack
of wheels
It is expected that when the Reichstag
meets on Tuesda Count von Buelow the
German Toreign Minister, will present the
condition of the imperial foreign rela
tions' in a wa that will demonstrate to
Europe the complete entente which now
exists between Germ in. Great Britain, and
the United States The Berlin press has
adopted a tone distlnctlj friendly to
America, and the German people generall
appear to be waking up to the advantage
of a firm understanding with the two great
Anglo-Saxon powers

POLITICAL NOTES AND GOSSIP.
Republican Jflulns nnl Losses. "It Is
a curious thing," said, a Republican Sen
ator to a Times reporter esterday. "that
while the last flection increased the Re
publican membership of the Senate it de
creased the Republican membership in the
House The snmfaalloUng last November
appears to hav effused Republican strength
at one end of tile Capitol while lowering it
at the other. How this happened is an old
stor A party gains or loses in the Senate
at an election b comparison with what
it did six ears before In the House bv
comparison with two ears before The
year 189S was a great Republican year by
comparison with 1S92, but a slightl less
Republican year than 189b "
llit Librarian of CoiiRrrest There
is some speculation at the north end of the
Capitol as to whether the Senate will
promptly confirm the nomination of Her
bert Putnam as Librarian of Congress
The stronger opinion is that if there is any
opposition to Mr Putnam it will be very
slight Should he bo confirmed an effort
will be at once made by his friends to have
his salar increased

of the Republican National Committee.
Ilepiil'licnii ZVutlomil Committee
Meeting: Whether Mr Hanna decides to
tender his resignation when the Republican
National Committee assembles at the Ar
lington on Thursday tho gathering is
bound to be, an, interesting one in any
eent. It will mark the opening of the
Presidential campaign of 1900 Ordinaril
the onl important business to be trans
acted b the national committee at this
time would be the fixing of the time and
place for holding the next Republican Na
tional Convention, but a matter of almost
equal interest will, it is understood, be
brought up at the forthcoming meeting
Mr. Pane, of Wisconsin, has prepared a
resolution recommending changing the
basis of the representation in future Re
publican national conventions and will ask
the committee to vote on it Mr Pavne'a
idea is to have the delegates to future Re
publican national conventions apportioned
among the several States In proportion to
the number of Republican voters in each
The purpose is to give the rock-ribbed Re
publican States of the North and West a
preponderating influence in the delibera
tions of the national conventions Serious
opposition to the passage of the Pane
resolution Is anticipated, but it comes
chiefly from the lepresentatives of the
States whose numerical strength in the na
tional councils of tho party would be cut
down if the proposed change should be
made The mere passage of the Payne
resolution next Thursday will not material
1 affect the situation as it will onl be
an expression of opinion and have no bind
ing force It is not proposed to change the
basis of the Republican representation at
the next national convention and even if
next ear's Republican National Conven
tion should adopt a new sstem ot repre
sentation at future national conventions it
would not of necessit be binding on them
Each national convention it is asserted is
a law unto itself and can do as it pleases
in the matter of seating and unseating
delegates However the Southern Repub
licans are bitterly opposed to the passage
of the Pajne resolution as the regard
it as an entering wedge m a movement to
deprive them of their rights
Hiih New orU n Chnnee It was
said last night that there was really a
chance of New York securing the Re
publican National Convention next ear
New "iork's claims will be presented by
Senator Depew, and, under certain contin
gencies, a majorit of the committeemen
ma vote to send the convention to the
American metropolis There will be an
opportunlt for the supporters of New York
to pla a little politics if the are se
riously in earnest in asking for the con
vention They can capture practically the
solid vote of the Southern committeemen.
It is believed, if the will agree to help
kill the Payne resolution
Hetitemint Olllmore's Vllot ment.
It is a fact that is not very well known
outside of Navy circles, ' said a naval officer
esterday, "that the family of Lieutenant
Gillmore, of the "iorktowu .who was cap
tured b the rilipinos a few months ago
had some trouble in persuading the disburs
ing officer of the Nav Department to con
tinue to pa the proportion of his salar
that had been assigned to them after Gill
more's capture As a rule, ever offjeer,
when he goes to sea in the regular course
of his dut leaves instructions regarding
the pavment of certain portions of his sal
ar during his absence He fills out a blank
stating to whom he desires the mone paid
whether wife, mother, sister or brother,
as the case may be and naming the amount
These blanks are known as allotments and
are under the immediate supervision of
trusted clerks who have reputation's for ac
curac Shortly aftei the report of Lieuten
ant Gillmore's capture reached this coun
tr his wife called it the Nav Department
to draw her monthly allotment, which her
husband had executed in her favor before
he started for the Philippines Much to her
burprise she was informed that the money
could not bo paid as the department or,
rathei the disbursing officer had no evi
dence that Lieuten mt Gillmore was still
alive I presume th it technicall speaking
the disbursing officer in question was onl
following the strict letter of the regula
tions governing such matters Disbursing
oflicers are of course bonded officials and
the and their bondsmen are responsible for
all mone of Uncle Sam that passes through
their hands Ibe pa of a Government of
licial, from the President down, stops m
stantl upon his death If Mi McKiniey
should die tomoirow, Mis McKiniey could
be legall paid onl the amount of salar
due him up to December 11 That is the
law but it seems to me not to be founded
either on eqult or justice In the case of
Arm and Nav officers who are ordered
to the firing line, it would seem to put a
premium on cowardice and skulking He
ma be tho sole support of his fatnil and
et he knows that the moment he is cut
down their income ceases It is bad enough
when a disbursing officer is compelled to
refuse to pay an allotment after receiving
proof ot death, but It strikes mo that it
Is straining a point for him to hold it up

VICTORIA, B C, Dec 10 Lieutenant
Governor Mclnniss, of British Columbia,
whose di&regard for diplomatic practice and
precedent secured him some notoriety a
vear ago, made another bid for public
notice last night, by entering into a dis
pute with United States Consul Abraham
E Smith, at the annual banquet of a Brit
ish Columbia pioneer society The lieu
tenant governor, in his acknowledgment of
the toast to his oflice, made reference to
his recent visit to the North, and touched
upon the Alaskan boundar question, hop
ing for its earl settlement upon the basis
of the British contention Great Britain,
he said, asked no more than possession of

United States as she had contmuall given
evidence since 18G4, when had it not been
for her friend! offices preventing the In
terference of other nations the disintegra

Consul Smith, In hi3 turn challenged
this sweeping statement and remarked that
he had distinct recollection of the opera
tions of a certain "Alabama' which did
not show the eulogistic reference to Brit
ish friendship in lSbl to be timel or justi
fied while he cmphaticall denied that
the existence of the United States at that
or any other date had been saved by grace
of Great Britain or any other power He
was interrupted by the excited lieutenant
governor who said he should have tnought
that a representative of the United States
would not have cared to refer to the Ala
bama claims In such a connection Great
Britain had been ordered to pa $15,000 000
on that claim and had paid it promptly and
without attempted evasion, in ver sharp
contrast to the polic of the United States,
which had t 000,000 in its Treasury toda

GOLD AND SILVER COINAGE.
Keport
of Mint Dlreetor Itolierts
Given to the Public.
The coinage executed by the mints of the
United States in the fiscal year ended Jnne 1
30 last says Director Roberts in his an-
nual report was greater than In any pre
vious year of their history, the totals be
ing $10S,177,1S0 of gold, and $14SS5S4 of
silv er. These show increases ot $43,642,315.
and $11,236 002 respectively, compared with
the coinage of the previous years, and ta?
coinage might have been conalderably
larger, sas the Director if the capacity ot
the mints had been greater
These institutions have been hard prescel
throughout the year to meet the demands
upon them, the New Orleans and Philadel
phia mints running overtime for the
greater part ot the twelve months The
seigniorage for the year footed up $8,305,
111, of which $5,520,145 was on the 1S.2W.-
709 silver dollars coined from bullion pur
chased under the Sherman act. 538.388 was
on subsidiary silver, and $&9S,S30 was on
nickels and pennies.
The stock of bullion on band at the close
ot the ear was gold. 5119.SS2 772, an in
crease of $23 294.190 for the year, and of
silver bullion (cost) $S 575 S96.
Director Roberts calls attention to the
fact that the Government has now pirati
cally no silver bullion available for the
coinage of subsidiary currency the entire
stock except that purchased for the specific
coinage of silver dollars, and which cannot
be deviated from that use without authority
from Congress, having been exhausted
Legislative action he say, is imperatively
demanded to meet the increasing demands
of the countr for fractional coins
The imports of gold for the year amount
ed to $SS,07S,882, and the exports $37 550 -
783 The silver imports were $31,12,5i8.
and the exports $50,555,336
Tho Director recommends the repeal of
the law placing an "export charge" of
one-tenth of 1 per cent on gold bars for
the reason that it operate to the disad
vantage of the Government The law had
failed of Its object to discourage gold
shipments, and it had been found less ex
pensive to the Government, as well as
the exporters, if the bars were used
"In tne report of this bureau a year
ago," says the report, "an effort was made
to tabulate the principal stocks of gold
held for monetary use in the world at
the close of the years 1S92 and 1S97 This
table, corrected by returns from addi
tional banks and the elimination of some
errors shows the stocks of gold in sight
in Europe to have increased by about 30
per cent from December 31, 1892, to De
cember 31 1897 From the latter date to
December 31, 1S9S, the stocks. Instead of
continuing to Increase, showed a diminu
tion At first thought the reduction is
likely to cause surprise, for with the
enormous gold production for the year.
amounting to $237,000,000, the stacks of
that metal might be expected to every-
vvnere augment
"When it is considered, however, that
the United States took above $200,400,000
of gold in 1S9S, that India's net imports
were over $20,000.KW, and that the indus
trial consumption of the world was
365.000.000, It will be understood that no
general increase in European stocks could
occur last year But it still remains to
explain where the disappearing gold of
Europe went to
"The total reduction shown by th above
table Is 5190,000,000, and the Russian stock
slaaws a reduction of $16S,0W,tWO But M
de "Witte, the Russian Minister of Finance,
states in his annual report upon the
budget, that 'during the ear 1SS there
has been an increase in the general amount
of god in the countr The reduction
shown in the stock of the Imperial Bank
has been brought about by the monetary
reform The enormous stock m the bank
at the close of 1S97 was provided for the
purpose of bringing the paper currency of
the country to a par with gold and estab
lishing its mterchangeabilit During the
past year the bank has been paying out
gold freely, and gold coin, long absent from
the circulation of the Empire, has again
entered into common use.
The Bank of England and the Imperial
Bank of Germany both show a loss of gold
during the ear, but the record of the
exports and imports of Great Britain and
Germany show that each of those countries
received mora gold than they parted with
Trade was very active in both countries and
apparently drew on the stocks of the two
leading banking institutions Tne money
stock of those countries was in larger
degree than the year previous in move
ment among the people and In the local
banks
"It is of special interest that the stock of
uncovered bank notes in Germany was
$14 000,000 greater on December 31. 1S95,
than on December 31, 1S97, and was $4fc -000,000
greater in Trance That illustrates
the elasticit which enables the monetary
systems of these countries to case off such
an extraordinary demand for gold as the
United States made on the world last year
The Austro-Hunganan Bank had ?17 000 -000
more of uncovered paper out at the end
of the year than at tne beginning; The
three had out about $78,000 0C0 more of un
covered bank notes than the year before
a fact which doubtless contributed much
to ease the financial situation The ability
to thus enlarge the stock of paper currency
Is valuable to a countr in event of an
sudden call upon t for heavy payments in
gold The isaue acts as a buffer between
such demands and the commercial inter
ests of the countr. protecting the latter
from sudden and sharp pressure It is a
legitimate use of the credit of the countr
through the agenc of banks of issue, to
meet a pasoing demand
' The most notable change In gold stocks
during the ear was in the United States
The stock of coin in the country, including
bullion in the mints on January 1. 1S9S,
was estimated at ?7-45,2 15,953, and oa Jan
uar 1. 1893, at 3915.79S.7SS, a gain of $200,
53J.S35 ' The production of go'd In all the impor
tant gold fields of the world Is increa ing
rapidly and with prospects of ga'ns for
ears to come The ield in the world in
the calendar ear 189S was $3S7,0Ofl 000
against $33S 000 000 in 1S97
' The production of Australia to date in
1S"0 has shown a gam of 25 per cent over
the corresponding months of 1S9S which in
dicates a probable gain for the ear of
$lt OOO.OCO The Unted States Canada, and
Mexico will probably increase their product
sis 000 000 In South frica the product on
of the first half of the ear was 35 per cent
above the ield of 1898, and If the industry
had been undisturbed the gain would have
been probabl above $20 000,000 As all
these principal districts are now in con
dition to produce at a higher rate than at
the opening of the present year and a I ate
preparing for larger yield it is not improb
able thit when operations are fully re-
sumed In South Africa the world's output
w ill quickly pass $400 000 000 per annum.
The worlds stock of coin is now being
increased more rapldl and by a higher an
nual percentage to the existing stoek than
during the period from 1S50 to 1860 when
the great output of gold from California
and Vustralla startled the economists of
all countries and gave the world a depre
ciated standard ot value The effect of this
new flood of standard money upon the mar
