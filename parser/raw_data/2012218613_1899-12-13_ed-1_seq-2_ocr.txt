THE PRESIDENT s
Mr. McKinley's message to Congress
has nothing particularly interesting in
it. Hi* strongest p ?i*.t is in the rerv
first part of t'ao mes-a^e. He alludes
to the "condition of unusual prosperity,"
and bis administration i* fortunate
that this is the true condition
of the country. Individuals may not
feel that there is a oy unusual pros- I
perity, 'oat taking tbe country as a
whole it is .true that we have struck a
tidal wave of prosperity. Bat tbe
President does not even undertake to I
show that the Republican party has
had anything to do with the present
condition.
The receipts of the Government
from all source* for the fiscal year
ending Jane 30, 1S99, iuclndlng $11,
798,314.14, part payment of the Central
Pacific railroad indebtedness,
amounted to $610,982,004.35, ami the
expenditures to $700,093,56 i.Q2 This
is really noi a bad showing when tbe
?ora iol-on in I
Yi Ckl CAJ/C1JOVO HIV luav ? ,
bat it must not be forgotteu that the
people are sii'l paying war taxes, and
it is pretty certain that they will have
to pay for revenuo stamps for a good
while longer, and besides pensions on
account of the Spanish war and the
war in the Philippines will begin at a
lively rate in a shert while.
The treasury has pleuty of gold,
but the President thinks this a good j
time, when "the conditions ot confi- j
deace which prevail throughout the
haTro Viprmuht crnlr? infn more I
Wuuu; v.
general use and customs are now almost
entirely paid in tbat coin," to
giro "the secretary of the treasury ad- j
ditional power to sell United States
bonds" for the purpose of maintaining
tbe gold standard.
g|^_l Tne President admits thai the national
banking act i3 inadequate to supply
needful additions to the circulation.
but he really suggests no remedy.
He ?throw3 it all on Congress. We
hope that Congress will conclude that
a repeal of the tar oa State banks of
issue will aff>rd a relief. Mr. McKinley
had a goad chance to say so,
bat ho didn't.
Like a'l Republicans, the President
favors boantie*, aad Ra/gjsts that
Congress adopt the policy of aid to
our merchant marine.
He touches on trusts in a general
way. Trusts "to control the conditions
of trade among oar oitjzenSj^to
w*-*--? and determine tVe prices of products
used an 3 onsumed by the people, are
justly provoking puouc discussion,
and should early claim the attention
of Congress." All of which is very
I? true, bat the people may expect noth|
. ing from a Republican Congress to
coirect this evil. JL large part of the
Republican campaign fand is furnished i
by the' trusts. It is not surprising,
? therefore, that th9 President is very
general in what he says about trusts.
The President states that our rcia* I
t.ion? with foreign governments ere '
satisfactory, though in this very message
it appear* that we have over 60,900
troopsj engaged in a foreign war.
4tTbi? nation has assumed before tbe
world a grave responsibility for the
jSnrf future good of the government of
Cuba" and tbe President recognizes
that the United States must in honor
give these people self-government.
II Tbe President takes it as settled that
the Philippine* are our9.

Consul Charles E. Macrum, United
States consn! at Pretoria, has disgraced
K? . his country. Mr. McKtnley is especially
responsible for his appoint?
meet to this post of duty. The consul
is a glass manufacturer from Ei6t
Liverpoel, Ohio, tfhich we believe is
in ths Presidents old congressional
district, and tha appointment was
rna.le upon the recommendation of
Senators Hauna and Foraker and
B Representative Taylor.
During the Spanish war, the inte
e - !? _< (Jiofoo
I rests oi cuizeus ui iuc uui^u
in Cuha>nd Manilla were entrusted
to British consuls, and this country
sounded the praise* of the British for
their care and this evidence of good
faith and kindly feeling. When Great
Bri'ain becama engaged in war in
South Africa, it was natural that the
Ucited States would seek to reciprocate
tbe kind office* of Gre*t Britain.

has actoaiiy deserted hie post, and it
is said that ho deserted because he

United States and those ol British
residents, and he has deserted He
Imade several applications for leave of
absence, at least two, since the war
begau,&nd bis applications were flatly
refused. Taking matters in bis own
bauds, bo skipped, leaving his office in
the hands of a minor. Uow unlike

Macrum home. He ooght to be given
?everal good dackines on Lis way -c
home to tone up his nerves. j
This disgrace to our Government i3
doubtless due to our .miserable system t(
of political rewards for services. No Cj
doubt the President or some of his
friends owed this glass man a politi- ^
cal debt, and he sought to pay it by
sending him to Soath Africa to fill a a
place ordinarily involving no greit
ability to discharge its denies and re- j $
eponsibilitv, but the war in South j
Africa comes along acd a man is j
- onnnArfpi*. and I u

the man is not there. Sach is the (
logical result of the ioiquitou3 practice

message "aid to our merchant marine" u

prc-!"Ot]y introdaced in Congress, r
Not fcatisf 1 with having enriched a z
few manufacturer? by levying h?avy j
tribute on the people, Senaf r Hanna J
has prepared a bil! which has been j i
introduced into the llou^e f Re pro- {
sentatives <o aid the ship builders and r
owners O'^hips. A bounty will be: r
paid tbe owners of American tbips,
and it is provided toat tne ooauucs
shall not exceed $9,000,000, that is, an {
amount eqaal to about $1 pr r bale for : 1
tbe average cotton crop, and the peo- j ,
p'.e of course, will bavr- :he bounty t-:s ! <
pay. Afire g'ft, miscalled in the 1 i
bill "a compensation," of one ar.d a 1
half cent* oer grofs ton per 100 miles ! ?
covered by vessels going a: (1 oming j
up to 1,500 miles each way will be j <
allowed, and one percent per jiross;
ton for t sch ICO additional mi!e=. j
Extra bonaly will be given faf-t ships,! \
regulaitd according to speed. Why j
should tbi? bill pass? What right has i 1
Congress to tax the people of this j j
country bv tsking their mor.ey from 11
the Dublic treasury and givir-g it to j1
the owners of ships? Why should i'
Congress not, with jusr as muchaa-jj
thority, give a bounty to farmers for I!
every mule they raise, or erory hog, i
or every iSpound of tobacco, or every .
bale of cotton? In the case of the
farmer, it would be wirh more justice, j:
for he ha?' been taxed many weary {
years "to protect and foster the infant j
industries" ol the North until the j
manufactn-er has grown rich ar^tbe '
farmer's ard all consumer's cipense. :
The bill will very probably p^s and j
become a iaw, and the question i^ will I
the people allow it to stand. We say
the bill will pa^s, because both houses
of Congress ar9 Republican aid a Republican
President is in the White
House, who has been the great apostle
of doctrinc of taxing one c'uss at the
expense of 3notbr.r, The bill does not
differ in principle from ihe tariff iawe,
and if the people shall allow tbis bill
to stand, it will be a repetition of the j
unjust tariflVlaws over again?heavier j
aiid heavier tribute eaen year 10 aia i

The Chester Reporter is mistaken
ibout Mr H F McLane, who died
ecently in Chester, being a brother
>f the late J Hendrix McLane, who
ivas once a candidate for Governor of
South Carolina. H F McLane was a
irst cousin of J Hendrix McLane.
J Hendrix McLane was, perhaps the
list man in South Carolina, and prob hiv
one of the first in the Southern
States, to advocate the free coinage of
:-olh gold and silver and the issue of a
:reen back currcncy redeemable in
both coins. I think subsequent events
ind present conditions justifies the
>->urss persued by Mr McLane.
Many of our people believed at that
lime ihat the principles advocated by
bim would prove detrimental to the
best interest of our people. Many of
those who thongbt the principles ad
rotated by Mr McLane were too
risionary and impractical to he-made

advocates of the practical application
Df those principles. The truth about
the tauiter was, that we had men in
high official positions to whom we
?ave credit for bei-ig leaders of public
opinion that did not merit the
bOLOr. Hendrin McLaue was misunderstood
by the people. At the
time? he commenced the agitation tor
financial reform the people of our j
Sra'e aud many other States were not
ready for a chaoge. It is sometimes !
very difficult lor anyone to make a;? j
event. It more oftou happens tiat

Br\?n it would !;ave been some consolation
to him to have realized that
the issues :hat he JieJped 10 agitate had
be,j!J crvitalized in a platform with a
Cindida'e running thereon that received
*>5: millions ot votes. That
was ttie mo.-t remir^aoie cwyass hi
the his:ory of American politics, and
tiie :?;an pat forth as the exponent of
the i rifie'ples embodied iu that platform
will ever shine as a star of the
first magnitude in that brilliant galaxy
great speech in^l893 on the money
question I read it and remarked that
it was but a rei'Ci ation of ibe principles
advocated by Weaver, of Iowa,
j Hendrix McLane, of South Carolina,
and other leaders of the greenback
movement. I also remarked that that
speech and others that Bryan might
make would pave i ij. way to the presidency
of the United State*. Whilst I
d-> not m^an to be egotistical I hazard
little in saying that I believe my
prophecy will yet be verified. But it
will take the combined efforts of the
o 1:~? ? - :t t>?.s,,k': ? n/4
i. iicv; &uvsi nc^uun^nr auu i
the Democrats to elect a Democratic '
President. In rav opinion it is the
only plan to be adopted by which we
can succeed in the approaching contest.
Bat I am a Democrat and I always
write the word witb a capital
letter for I believe in its principles
and would rather be a Democrat in
defeat than to be a Republican in
ci<-tory. I will go farther than some
\A our strong free silver advocates. I (
will vote for any Democrat who will
u-e the |inflnence of the President's ;
office to impede the progress of the
r?t,?r?rr? msrph Af (Viio imnorisvliHm. /
uDilltaryism, republicanism, and last {
and worst of all, Hannaism, with all
jf its monopolistic tendencies. I ;
think there are too many isms in the 1
Republican party for any good Demo- ;
;rat. Genuine democracy is pure and ]
unadulterated and there is no isms in
it. The Catholics poll about twelve j
md a half per cent of the vote of the
United States and it will be polled i
argely for Bryan on account of his
opposition to imperialism. The in- <
labitaats of the Phillipine Islaads I
mostly belong to the Catholic church
ind it is not reasonable to s*ppose tbat
rtany of that denomination ia America
;vould vote for a party that is engaged
n a relentless war with the members

emt^e from our country. ,
Witb best wishes for all aDd success
for democracy, I am yours truly,
