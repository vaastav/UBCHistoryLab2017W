Patrick Joseph McKenna
rpHE EARTH that closed over the
cosed
THE I remains of Dr Patrick J
McKenna on Sunday afternoon
cannot veil his memory So long as
men have hearts that respond to af
fliction and souls that ascend to the
I borders of the Spirit Land so long will
fancy see our old friend coming to I
bid us good morning Those who
knew him in life will strive to banish
fron their minds the almost tragical
manner of his death so that more
easily may they dwell in the conceit
that Patrick McKenna is still among
them that it is his foqjtstep they hear
at the door and his voice which lifts
the gloom from despondency and lets
in the sunshine of hope
Who in Salt Lake City did not know
Patrick McKennaDoc McKenna See
those magnificent floral tributes whose
odor yet lingeiv about his grave their I
beauty not more lovely than the char
acter of the dead man lying beneath
their lavish abundance testifying in
silent language the affection of his fel
lowmen See that throng of mourn
ers representing every feature of
clear social life in Salt Lake religious
professional the common people and
the poor to whom he was a benefactor
Not to know Patrick McKenna was to
live in the world of selfishness with
out an example of quiet benevolence
to read a novel without a character
that appealed to the finer traits of
man All these emotions were aroused
at one glimpse of that noble yet youth
ful face that massive beaU crowned
with white hair upon whose brow
anger never found place and from
whose lips no insult could escape
What else the world around us may
say of Dr McKenna these outlined
thoughts will always be fixed in the
minds and hearts of his friends The
world may say he was clever but not
profound because his personal magne
tism attracted humanity rather than
greatness Be it so Tis in such re
flections we indulge the strongest and
longest To those who loved him as a
friend the friendship of McKenna was
greater than the glory of Jenner
Those who knew him best in his pro
fession say he was above the average
in knowledge and
practice and as a
scholar and linguist he had but few
peers Had he not been suddenly cut
down on the threshold of vigorous
manhood the opportunity was his by
simply reaching for it
The large turnout o the Catholic
and other benevolent societies on Sun
day last the crowd in the church and
the great number outside who pa
tiently awaited the end of the services
and followed the funeral to the
ceme
tery all this must have imnrcssprl the
u
stranger in our midst with the uni
versal sadness of the city and carried
the name of Patrick McKenna abroad
The annual memorial services of the
Elks on the same evening always
Beautiful were rendered more touch
ng by the sad calamity which had
just deprived them of an endeared
brother
The state has lost a useful citizenthe
church militant a beloved and char
table child his afflicted widow a de
voted helpmate But his chosen friends
they who listen for his footstep every
day will clasp his hand in spirit and
embrace the illusion that Patrick Mc

I Mormon Slander of Catholics
ATTENTION has been called
OUR an editorial caled
appearing in the
Deseret News of a November is
sue under the head New Mexicos
Demand I is so seldom anything
appears on that page of the News
which might add to the worlds knowl
I edge that the habit of skipping i
comes natural Least of all
al was it to
be expected that the editor of the
News who has his hands full
ful fighting
attacks upon the Mormon church and
its missionaries and every day is deep
ly engrossed in fortifying its position
as a religious body would
relgious go out of
his way to slander the Church which
has exhibited more tolerance of Mor
mon creed and practice and less bitter
ness tpward i them asa1 people than all
other professed Christians But this
has been done in his treatment of New
lexicos Demand which follows
New Mexico
as heretofore explained
plained in the Deseret News will this
w1
time demand admission to the Union
The territory has repeatedly asked for
such admission but its claims have
for some reason or other always been
set aside Jn 1S79 for InKtancp it was
shown that New Mexico was so com
letely under the domlnatibn of den I
cal influence that the legislature
passed over the governors veto a bill
i incorporating the Jesuits and confer
I ring on them extraordinary powers
I and exemptions in the matter of taxa
tion Congress annulled the law but
this action made congress wary of ad
I mitting the territory to the Union
The population of New Mexico now
lIs I 250000 I has a good public school
system The influx of the AngloSax
on element has been so great in late
years that there can be no well found
ed fears of turning the state if it
should obtain statehood over to an
order that has a bad reputation The
claims made to recognition are good
and they will no doubt be carefully
I considered More than half a century
of schooling for the duties of statehood
should be sufficient and New Mexico
has been an integral part of the coun j I
try for that length of time i
In the history of the Church in
America there never was a time when
the Catholic people were dominated by
clerical influence and this apples
to New Mexico as well as to all other
parts of the republic There never was
a time when the Catholic citizen could
I not exercise his free will and right and
be at peace with his conscience never
I
a time that he did not exercise that
I right unadvised by priest or bishop
and never a time that he could not re
sent any interference tme from cleric on
I
that score by simply telling him to
mind his own business
Can the Mormon say as much
te
In the J history of the Catholic
Church in America there is no instance
recorded where Catholic clergymen
were banded together political so
cieties with a church name for the
purpose of casting their anchor to
windward in political campaigns never
an instance of a Catholic clergyman
running for office or leading his parish
ioners to the polls
Can the Mormon priesthood say as
much
What does the Deseret News mean
by alluding to a bill incorporating the
Jesuits and conferring on them extra
ordinary powers Religious societies
like the Jesuit order are not incorpor
ated by the state nor can the state
confer on them any power except the
title to property and this is the effect
of statute everywhere I in 1873 the
people of New Mexico through their
legislators recognizing the benefits
conferred upon their children through
education enacted a bill absolving the
Jesuit schools from taxation could
such act be regarded less equitable
than its effect upon public property
ancl public schools elsewhere in the
states
Who are these Jesuits this order with
a reputation so had that congress
refused any overtures from New Mex
ico until the demand came from Anglo
Saxons They belong to the order that
pent a Father Marquette and a Father
De Smet to explore the wilderness of
the Far West and teach Christ and
Him crucified long before the Anglo
Saxon demoralized the Indian long
before even the Catholic Pathfinder
General Freemont crossed the plains
or BrIgham Young set foot In Zion
The memories of these Jesuits are en
shrined in the hearts of all Americans
where tolerance supplies the place of
bigotry and true history defies sec
tarian inaccuracy
This Jesuit influence which has
wrought so many failures In the past
for recognition of New Mexicos claims I
to statehood must have been as po
tent as that of the Mormon priesthood
of Utah albeit the endeavor lay in a
contrary display of American patriot
Ism to that incited by the hierarchy
of this state At the time when de
fiance to law and government in Utah
and for some time thereafter was
so grave that the presence of a fed
eral army and garrison were necessary
to enforce obedience and protect loyal I
citizens clerical influence in New
Mexico was aroused to the peril of I
the nation through civil war Early
in 1862 a Confederate army from Texas
invaded the territory and occupied
Santa Fe but at length was defeated
jy the volunteers of New Mexico at
Glorieta and driven from the country
The record of New Mexico > dominated
by Jesuitical Influences is one of the
brightest of that period for in a popu
ation of not more than 70000 at this
time 6000 New Mexicans took up arms
tme I
I In defense of the Union of states
How many Mormons were enrolled in
he Union army at this time
I I will be found upon investigation
that the real reason for rejecting New
lexicos claims for statehood was not
based upon the idea that its people
I
were dominated by clerical influence
or through any alarm of Jesuits or
through any other reason given by the
editor of the Deseret News The real
capon was a political one and took
rise because of the silver sentiment I
prevailing at the time ana wnicn the
I dominant party in congress feared
wculd disturb its control of the senate
In fact i was coldly given out that
no more silver states would be admit
ted I New Mexico Is admitted now
it will not be because of the presence
of the AngloSaxon I will be because
of the recent decision of the United
States supreme court fixing the status
I
of the territories I will be because
New Mexico spends more money per
capita for education has more news
papers per capita and more churches
according to population than any
state

slander of Catholics of New Mexico
arouses the ire of liberal nonCatholics

i As to the books which constitute the
canon of Scriptures It is a serious
question and one which our corre
spondent will not himself undertake to
i decide yet until that is decided there
t can be no authentic record or Bible to
quote from Why Because if the
Bible contains books which are not
authentic or omits books that are au
thentic no appeal can be made to I
for In the former case he may take
I for revelation hat is not a truly re
vealed book and in the latter leave
I out what is true revelation That is
I so selfevident that unless some court
decides the canon of Scriptures any
appeal to the Bible can not be admit
ted in evidence for the answer given
once by a divine who was not over
burdened with Scriptural lore it may
be in your Bible but I is not in mine I
could be always given
The supreme court which decide
the canon must be independent of the
Bible and secondly it must be in
fallible Our correspondent has no in
fallible authority and will admit none
except that of the Bible itself which
is net sufficient Neither our Lord nor
his Apostles tell what books of the
Old Testament were inspired St Paul
in i his second epistle to Timothy does
say All Scripture divinely inspired is
profitable etc but he does not say
what Scriptures are divinely inspired
On what authority then is the canon
of Scriptures to be settled Only on
that of the Church Eut our corre
spondent denies that authority and its
infallible teaching regarding the canon
of the I Church For him then there
is no certainty as to what books either
in the Old or New Testament are In
spired and consequently is not com
petent to tell what books in the Old
Testament or the New Testament are

as defined by the Council of Trent

At the outset the promoters of the

I President and the Congress
THE WHEELS of national legislation
I J began moving on Tuesday simul
taneously with the presentation
of the
presidents message to the
con
gress From now until some time next
summer the city of Washington will
be the center of national interest
No message of his predecessors was
awaited with greater Interest mingled
with uneasiness than Roosevelts first
communication to the congress Now
that it has come and the presidents
views are stated with the directness
characteristic of the man I remains
to be seen whether the Fiftyseventh
congress will bow to the will of a
president of whom his party as yet
knows little or become a turbulent
organized opposition to the plans of
the administration At the outset i
IS known that the president Is in op
position to the party leaders who con
trol things on to great questions
the curbing of trusts and the Inaugu
raton of a policy of reciprocity in our
dealings with other nations His pub
icity cure for trusts will be antagon
Ized on the jump for those in control
I in both houses are identified with the
great trusts of the country and legis
j I lation on this subject is impossible A
I I strong antitrust bill has been for the
past two years shelved in the senate i
committee on judiciary and i has
been impossible to get a report on it
There are a number of great
ques
tions that will be disposed of by this
congress which will make history for
the Americans of the future Fore
most will be the ratification of the
HayPauncefote treaty and the enact
ment of legislation providing for the
construction of the Nicaragua canal
As an Incident to this international
work will be the authorization of the
laying of a Pacific cable between San
Francisco and Manila by way of Ha
Janan waii with an extension from Manila to
The Geary Chinese exclusion act
will be reenacted with strong amend
I ments A law for the protection of the
i president and for the prevention of
preventon the
I entrance into this country of men of
known anarchistic tendencies will be
put through at an early day Other
legislation will relate to general im
I migration The increase in the naval
i < establishment will be continued The
purchase of the Danish West Indies
will be negotiated for at this session
II The western members have finally
succeeded in arousing general interest
in the subject of irrigation and the
IIIaton re
clamation of the semiarid lands that
constitute hundreds of thousands of
acres that can by a system of irriga
tion be opened for cultivation The
westerners have formed a combination
which will compel congress to give
them aid
A river and harbor bill will also be
passed Ship subsidy will come up
but in the West there is a determined
opposition tQ granting aid to the mer
chant marine in the shape of bounties
Some legislation regarding the col
onies will be required but the plan
of the leaders is that no general
scheme for the control of the new pos
sessions shall be considered during this
session

are knocking at the door for state

DESERET NEWS SLANDERS
NEW MEXICO CATHOLICS
Editor Intermountain Catholic
In a recent number of the Deseret
Evening News which is the acknowl
edge organ of the Mormon church
there appeared an editorial respecting
J the demand of New Mexico for admis I
sion to statehood in the Union and I
am surprised that it has been Ignored In
i the Intermountain Catholic There are
unveiled and unfriendly Intimations to
Catholicism in the article in question
which to one familiar with the history
of Utah before and since her admission
o the Union are in extremely bad I
taste
The charge that in 1879 admission
was denied New Mexico because of the
domination of that territory by a
Catholic organization Is mystifying as
emanating from an authentic Mormon
source when It is recalled that Utah
was kept from statehood for over a
quarter of a century on the ground
I that her people were In such abject
i submission to a domineering priesthood
that a free suffrage was impossible
This charge was denied with a vehe
mence and persistence almost unpa I I
ralleled and qo more bitter denuncia
tion of it was made than appeared in
this same church organ In view of
the experience of this state it would
have not only been good taste on the
part of the Mormon church organ to
have assumed that Catholics in New
Mexico had been maligned but It
would have been more consistent with
that spirit of Christian charity which
Mormons profess and which the News
as the mouthpiece of a church accept
ing Immediate and direct revelation
revelaton
claims to be guided by
The article also refers to the bad
reputation of the Catholic organiza
tion in New Mexico The press of the
country united in charging the Mor
mon church with all manner of in
iquities blacker than which were
never laid at the door of any ecclesi
astical organization These charges are
made today In view of this well I
kncwn and undeniable fact what shall
be thought of the readiness of the in
spired organ of the Mormon church
when it so eagerly and unnecessarily
and unwarrantably refers to another or
ganization in such terms of revilement
as are applied to the body it repre
sents I such utterances are inspired
it cannot be claimed for them that
theirsource is the same as that which
warned men to judge not lest they be
judged and to turn the left cheek and i
to suffer rather than give reviling and
persecution
An1 as a Justification for now giving
to New Mexico a statehood long denied
the News says that the infiux of the
AngloSaxon element has been so great
in late years that there can be no well
founded fears of turning the state if it
should obtain statehood over to an or
der that has a bad reputation How
familiar all this sounds Exactly as
if the Tribune in its fighting
Trbune fghtng years
were referring to the church of which
the News is the authorized mouth
piece Again More than half a cen
tury of schooling for the duties of
statehood should be sufficient This
was the excuse given when those who
had so bitterly opposed the admission
of Utah found It would be to their per
sonal advantage and to the advantage
of the political parties whose welfare
they were trying to promote when they I
finally commended and supported the
movement to secure statehood for
Utah
Every charge which the News so
freely brings against Catholics in New
Mexico has been iterated and reiterated
against Mormons in Utah together
with other charges beyond comparison
in number and in iniquity Unfailingly
these were denied hv thE TUnimrinc
anJ the News their organ n That paper
and the people behind it asked to be
believed and branded the charges as
Infamous and it took long years be
fore the public temper so altered that
It would tolerate even the suggestion
suggeston
of the admission of Utah to statehood
I would seem that the lesson of ad
versity tp the Mormon people has been
of little profit since their is
proft organ so
ready to accept and repeat charges
against a Catholic organization in an I
other state I must also be apparent
that the merciful and tolerant teach
Ings of Christ do not appeal to the in
spired gentleman who wields the pen
on the organ of the Mormon church
r am frank to say the article dis
gusted me I am neither a Catholic
Catholc
nor Mormon but the readiness of the
News to pounce upon another religion
that so far as this country is
con
cerned has lived in amity with all other
ecclesiastical organizations is both
nauseating and disheartening I have
yet to hear that Catholics anywhere
have promulgated preached and prac
Iced doctrines in violation of the plain
law of the land but that the Mor
1101
mon church has done this and the
I Deseret News also even its editor can
not deny Not only this but the Mom
1101
mon priesthood in contradiction to
contradicton
Catholic policy has compelled its people
to a violation pf laws and gloried in
their defiance
The Mormon
priesthood in view of
all the past could well afford to repu
diate the utterances of the writer in
wrter
the News who volunteered an assault
Mexico upon the Catholic organization in New

raised by popular subscription The bri

THAT REMINDS ME
NOT HIS EEAD
From over the hills far away comes a
story concerning Uncle Joe Cannon
and what happened when hp went to
church one day recently The tale Is
not well authenticated but it Is so prob
able that the story will bear telling It
Is solemnly alleged that on the day in
question the man who used to delight in
having himself called the hayseed Con
gressman went to a prayer meeting
The night before it appears he had
been out with a number of congenial
spirits who whiled away the time by
playing cards at a penny a heart They
tarried long at the game Therefore It
was quite natural that on the next even
ing Mr Cannan yielded to the somno
lent influences of the meetinghouse
They allege that the Hon Joseph fell
sound asleep and further that ne
emitted a stentorian snore This shocked
the good brother who was leading the
meeting He determined to awaken the
sleeper
Will Brother Cannon lead us In
prayer he asked in a loud voice The
sleeping statesman half awoke rubbed
his eyes and sleepily moved his lips to
form lows a sentence declared to be as fol
Taint my lead I dealt last
THEN THE COURT LAUGHED

ducting the crossexamination will you

answer to the question I have put
The witness will please answer the
question said the court In impressive
tones
tonesCant
Cant said the lady
