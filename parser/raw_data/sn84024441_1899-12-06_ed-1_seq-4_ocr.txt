WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 0, 1899.
The publication In The Evening Times of
yesterday of a synopsis of the annual re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury
which was not formally laid before
Congress until today) as in direct con
trarentlon of the understanding that the
document (advance sheets of which bad
been prepared for the conenience of the
press) should not actually be printed unfl
the report itself had been received by the
Speaker of the House. It is customary
in such cases to put the matter in type,
and await notification from the Capitol
that the report In question has been-
actually presented in Congress. Through
a mistaken bulletin that Mr. Gage's re
port had been sent to the House simul
taneously with the President's Message,
order was given to print the synopsis pre
pared (and in type) In The .Evening Times,
and this was done.
The mistake was a grievous one, and tho
apparent breach of faith so serious that-
The Times cannot sufficiently apologize to
Secretary Gage or to Mr. David S. Barry,-
the Washington correspondent of the "New
York Sun," through whose courtesy (albeit
in the way of business) the original copy
of the report was received subject to the
conditions mentioned.
Jufltice to 1'orto Illco.
Among the many good things In the
President's message which are in danger of
being lost In that vast ha rick of words.
Ihe attention of the" country should be dl
rected to one recommendation which does
him infinite credit as an honest and mer
ciful man and a wise ruler, and which
ought to be acted upon by Congress with
out any delay.
In the course of his remarks on the sub
ject of our colonial possessions Mr. Mc
Klnley says: "Our plain duty Is to abolish
all customs tariffs between the United
States and Porto Rico, and give her prod
ucts free access to our markets." This
declaration Is all the more admirable, be
cause it will Inevitably excite the opposi
tion of certain defined interests which
hitherto have wielded a great deal of in
fluence in the financial counsels of the Re
publican party. In order to be straightfor
ward, and true to his duty to help and
protect a population which has gladly ac
cepted our flag and sovereignty, and whose
Island home Is as much an Integral part
of the United States as Massachusetts or
Utah, it may be said that Mr. McKinley
could not have taken any other position.
But we must remember that, in openly
recommending free trade with Porto Rico,
although legally it Is a necessary and man
datory consequence of our changed politi
cal relations to the colony, he brings
himself into conflict with elements that he
might perhaps have been partially excused
for trying to placate until after the next
Presidential election. t
Some of Mr. McKInley's friends have
been seriously afraid that the objections
of Connecticut Valley tobacco growers, and
the sugar Interest, to the commercial in
corporation of new tobacco and sugar ter
ritory within our free trade boundaries,
would be potent enough to delay justice to
Porto Rico and other American colonies,
for another year at least. It is, therefore,
with sincere pleasure that we note the
President's determination to do the right
rather than the personally expedient thing,
in speaking out for justice to Porto Rico.
We are the more glad, because In present
circumstances he is In a position of such
strong influence that he can secure com
pliance with his excellent recommenda
tion, against any antagonism or obstruc
tion, beyond a peradventurc. Having ac
complished this, his memory will live for
ever as that of a benefactor in the hearts
of the rescued Porto Rlcans.
Parrot Rellston.
Thcro is a very religious elevator man la
a Kansas town, and he has hit upon a
novel device for making his faith manifest
He has decorated his moving apartment
with red lettered signs, reading: "Pear
God and Keep His Comraandments,""Eter
nity In Hell," "He Lifted Up His Eyes, and
Behold He Was in Torment," and so on.
Evidently this gentleman expects to bring
casual observers Into the fold by this
very original means.
But there 2s a psychological fact which
cpme3 in here, and it is perhaps best ex
plained by a little story. Ono day two
advertising agents were conversing to
gether on the usefulness ot various methods
of carrying on their work. One maintained
Etoutly that large signs, painted In white
on the sides of buildings, were the most
effective signs painted so that ht who
runs may read. The other as stoutly de
clared that such' inscriptions made no im
pression on the public mind, and rUIng,
he pulled down the window curtain, and
offered to wager a small sum that his com
panion could not tell what was painted
on the side of a large brick building just
across the street. And his friend lost.
Though he had occupied that office for
more than one year, and passed that sign
every day In his life, he could not tell
what it was. He had probably known, the
first time he saw It. what the advertise
ment was, but with the repetition of the im
pression it had had less and less effect
on his mind, till It had become of no more
moment than the particular shape of a
wayside tree. The moral of this is that
familiarity breeds indifference and obliv
ion. There used to be an Idea In some people's
minds and It has not jet entirely vanished
from the world that religion was best
taught by what might be called the hammer
method; that the way to make a child
obey thi Ten Commandments was to talk
to him about them day and night, and make
him go to all the religious services which
he could be forced to attend, and read noth
ing but religious books on, Sundays. Two
things were overlooked by the worthy peo
ple who promulgated! these Ideas; one was
the power of reaction inherent in the hu
man constitution, and the other was the
indifference bred by continual repetition of
abstractions. This regime bred up a child
with no sense of proportion; small pecca
dilloes were magnifled into deadly sins, and'
when the boy went out into the world, like
a young bear, with nil his troubles before
him, he had no standards except such as
he could evolve out of his own unassisted
Intellect. Then the reaction came, and
sometimes It was a woeful one, if the boy
happened to have strong passions and not
much self-control. There was a danger
in such training for other temperaments,
also. Most of us have seen the type of
person who talks very glibly on religious
subjects, and uses Scriptural and theologi
cal phrases continually. Such a person Is
quite destitute of any sense of the fitness
of things. He will sometimes talk about
"taking up the cross" the duty referred to
being attendance upon a religious meeting
when he would rather stay at home and toast
his feet and eat apples. He will talk about
"resisting temptation" and "denying him
self pleasure" when discussing the ques
tion whether or cot he shall eat a piece ot
mince pie. On the other hand, he some
times fails to see that an irresistible storm
of temptation is sweeping some soul into
perilous depths, before his very eyes, and
what is really the result of deep conviction
in another person he will ascribe to mere
caprice. Of course, a part of this general
misconception of the duties and privileges
of human life is temperamental, and cannot
be hefped. No human power will make
a congenital fool into a wise man. But
there 'are some very sensible people who
might be more useful and less ridiculous
to their neighbors than they are at present
"but for the effect of wrong training. It
should be understood by all Intelligent peo
ple, in or out of the Church, that the era
of parrot Christianity is waning, and that
the sooner it goes the better it will be for
all concerned.
The Desertion of Long.
There is so much meat In the Presiden
tial message, of the-kind which is good for
thought food, that probably we shall not
get through eating of It for what may
loosely be termed a month of Sundays. It
is not alone in connection with its good
sense and statesmanship that the message
is admirable. Mr. McKinley has the true
diplomatic instlpct to tell him when a wink
is as good as a nbd In the case of a dead
'Matanzas mule, and in the great state
paper to which" we allude he allows us to
deduce some things from a silence as loud
as the clarion notes of the trump of Fame.
Particular attention is called to the
President's remarks on the splendid serv
ice rendered the country by our nay. It
will be observed that no endorsement is
Included ot Long's demand that Congress
shall pass a vote of thanks to Sampson for
his "operations" around Santiago. The
President Is not the kind of man to lend
himself to anything as supremely ridicu
lous as urging battle laurels for one
whose most mendacious backers have failed
to bring him nearer than seven miles to
the Santiago sea fight, forty minutes after
Cervera had surrendered to Commodore
Schley, who commanded In the engagement
and won the victory.
Mr. McKinley did not omit to mention
or approve this cool proposition to the Na
tional Legislature on the part of his Naval
Secretary, without first-class reasons for
avoiding such a mistake. He knows Long
a great deal better than Congress can, and
he is much more responsible for him a
fact which he should be the first to deplore.
But Congress will know Long as does his
superior, in due course of time, and then
Senators and members will be without oc
casion to wonder that the message was
without evidence ot Presidential tolera
tion for a contemptible conspiracy, the full
extent and turpitude of which will be un
folded when the Inevitable Congressional
investigation of the Navy Department has
been completed.
Pharmacy and Photoa-raphy.
To the Editor of The Times:
I should like to know under what act ot Con
greso, or by whose authority, the photographic
supply firms of the District ot Columbia are per
mitted to handle and sell chemicals such aa cya
nide of potassium, which la used extensively for
mining and metallurgical procef&es, and in the
arts, and is one of the most deadly poisons. A
lloboken, N. J., chemical company issues a price
list ot standard "chemical specialties for photo
graphic supply Iiouses. The list includes: Acid
muriatic, acid nitric, acid sulphuric, acid pyro
gallic ammonia concentrated, chloroform, ether,
silver nitrate, cyanide ot potassium, and others
too numerous to mention. Arc the men who sell
thee goods chemists? Are they pharmacists? Do
they have a poison register? Do they register
every poison? Are they informed well enough to
give advice to the novice, who makes a purchase
because a friend told him what to buy, or have
they a printed formula in some book or pam
phlet to guide them? Do they know the reaction
tliat takes place between chemicals? Which are
deliquescent and which are efflorescent salts? Do
they know what deliquescent and efflorescent
mean?
Is the law made to apply to the man who has
studied chemistry at great cost, because he is a
pharmacist or chemist? Naturally . people look
upon the druggist as the man who dispenses
poions; true, he does, and In most cases, to
conform with the law; but docs he sell them
in such quantities as the puotozranhic sunolr
firms? Is this justice?
j. waltek Mcdonald.
The law regulating the handling of pois
ons at retail Is to be found in the re
port of the Health Officer of the District.
It prohibits any person who Is not a reg
istered pharmacist from conducting an es
tablishment where, poisons are retailed,
compounded, or dispensed for medicinal
purposes. The dealers in photographic
supplies, it Is claimed, are exempt from
the operations of the law, for the reasons
that they do not retail poisonous acids or
salts and do not sell them as -medicines.
These merchants dispose ot their goods
principally in original packages, or In
sufficient balk to admit of the claim that
their business is wholesale.
The acids and chemicals most frequently
employed In photographic processes today
are either comparatively harmless-or only
of a mildly poisonous nature. The prin
cipal developlng-flulds are' of this charac
ter. Since the wet-plate has become prac
tically obsolete and the dry-plate baa ta
ken its place, both with professionals and
amateurs, the use of -Cyanide ofpotasslum
in the dark-room has' been abandoned.
Rarely, it at all, does one hear of per
sons being poisoned by the salts and fluids
used In the photographic art. Few or the
specialties ot the stock-house being dan
gerous to handle,, and the poisonous nature
of these being well understood by the pur
chaser and the seller, there seems to be
no good reason for extending- the law so
as to comprehend such establishments.
It Is now understood that Great Britain
and Germany have given verbal assurances
to Secretary Hay that, as far as they ere
concerned, the "open door" in China will
be strictly protected, and that tbey are
willing to give written guarantees to that
effect. This prompt compliance with the
request contained In the Chluess note Is
sued by our State Department, on the Fart
of the two powers mentions!, is taken la
Europe - mean that Ine United States,
Great Britain, and Germany Jiave n com
mon and firm understanding as to the Chi
nese question, and that, in effect, it
amounts to a triple alliance.
New York city may well congratulate
Itself that there Is somebody with a rigid
backbone in a position ot authority where
matters of health are involved. The bu
bonic plague has Invaded Kobe, Japan, and
the germs have been traced to cotton Im
ported from China. Yet Dr. Doty, health
officer of the port of New York, persists In
reiterating his opinion- that the plague ship
Taylor and the several suspected vessels
which have arrived at Quarantine from
Brazil should be permitted to discharge
their coffee. Dr. Doty is apparently indif
ferent to the possible danger of such a
procedure and willing to stake a whole
population on his theory concerning the bu
bonlc germ. However, there Is a well
founded opinion that the people of New
York, aided by President Murphy, ot the
Health Board, will see to It that the coffee
they drink Is free from even n suspicion of
contamination. If the health officer of the
port considers himself an abused function
ary, there Is always refuge in a resignation.
For a long period crime has been ram
pant In Chicago and its suburbs. The
Windy City police are apparently too busy
with holiday plans- or other things to give
the matter proper attention. The people
of the East will not be surprised, there
fore. If during the ensuing two weeks
Christmas shoppers are beaten and robbed
In the departhrent stores, street cars looted
by shooting highwaymen, and the good
cheer of the season destroyed by the crim
inal diversions which have become so fre
quent that lhey ar. tiarajterlitjcs Pf tbe
pork metropolis, , . ,
The army transportsystem upon which
so much criticism has fallen of late may
be simply unfortunate In Its workings. Tho
Manauense may have been a victim of un
toward circumstances. There may have
been no official fault, or delinquency in the
horror of the Tartar. Oversight or condi
tions beyond human control may have been
responsible for the curious and unsatisfac
tory incldents-that have-attracted -the at
tention and condemnation of the public.
But there is a good, and sufficient reason
for a thorough investigation, of these mat
ters. If everybody has been conscientious
In the performance of duty, everybody will
emerge unscathed from an enqulrty. If
somebody is to blame for "the distresses
thrust upon the -American -volunteer and
the Ill-repute which has fallen upon the
transport service, somebody should bo
court-martialed and punished.
Being intimately familiar with the tor
tuous highways and byways of Luzon,
Aguinaldo may further elude his determin
ed pursuers for a few days, but there is
some reason to expect that he will be
brought into camp in sufficient season to
be considered a Christmas present.
An Excellent Move.
(From the Philadelphia Ledger.)
-Democracy took one step out of the ditch at
the side of the road in selecting Congressman
Richardson tt Tennessee-, to do the leading in
the House of Representatives. lie is an able
parliamentarian and a cool-headed and competent
man who may be depended upon to give dignity
and decency to the tactical movements of the
opposition. In his nomination for the Speaker
ship the party put itsTiest foot- foremost.
Convert Expected In Soochon,
(From the North China, News.) .
In consequence ot the obstructions caused in ihe
narrow streets ot Soochow by-tber large number ot
well-to-do young Chinese anxious to learn to be
come wheelmen, and actimr upon" the representa
tions made by the more sober and sedate citizens,
the three dWrict msgistratw-of Soochow City
have issued a joint proclamation forbidding the
riding of cycles by-sny one except foreigners,
missionariees. and converts. This ought to give an
impulse to conversion. " .
Under Which Tribe?
(From the Philadelphia Record.)
General Otis' version ot the Chinese exclusion
story is that lie. tried to preserve the rights of
tbe Chinese-.already in the. Philippines-, but he
.simply had to enforce -the American exclusion laws
against any farther influx ot their countrymen,
because of the race hatred between the Chinese
and the natives. That is a good explanation, if
correct but the Chinese have been invading the
Philippines for a tery long time, and It is singular
that this race hatred was never reported before.
It would be more satisfactory it General Otis
had specified i. which of the mutually warring
tribes in the islands were hostile and which
friendly to the Chinamen
The Triple Alliance.
(From the St- Paul Pioneer Press.)
All these utterances by the representative men
ot the three countries are significant at-least that
they -are drawing closer together in recognition of
the ties of blood and the community of interests
which unite them. If thia friendly understanding
shall become the permanent policy of this great
Teutonic trinity, it will be a happy augury It
will be more than an augury it will be a sub
stantial guarantee of the peace of all the world.
The Name of Redrersu
(From tbe London Chronicle.)
The uncommon name of Redvers, now- so fa
miliar in this country, was given to Sir Redvers
Buller by reason of his descent from the Courtc
nay fsmUy. whose ancestry was Earl Redvers. In
Nelson's day every other boy for. two or three
years was christened Horatio Nelson, and Arthurs
multiplied amazingly during the triumphant days
of Wellington. Probably five years hence there
will be many more bearers of the name of Red
ers than there are toady.
Canning's Wedding-.
(From the Letters of John liookham Frere.)
I was to be best man, and Pitt, Canning, and
Mr. Leigh, who was to read the Bcrvice, dined
with me before the marriage, which was to take
place in Brook Street. AVe had a coach to drive
there, and aa we went through that narrow part,
near what was-then Swallow Street, a fellow drew
up against the wall to avcld.being run over, and,
Gttring into the coach, recognized Pitt and saw
r. Leigh, who was in full canonicals, sitting op
posite him. "The fellow exclaimed: "What, Billy
Pitt! and with a parson, too!" I said: "lie
thinks you are going to Tyburn, to be hanged
privately." which was rather impudent of me, but
Pitt was too much absorbed, I believe, in thinking
of the marriage to be angry. After the ceremony
he was so nervous that he could not sign as wit
ness, and Canning whispered to me to sign with
out waiting- for Mm. lie. regarded the marriage
as tht one thing needed to give Canning the po
sition necessary to lead a party, and this waj the
cause of his anxiety about it, which Irould not
have believed had I not witnessed it, though I
knew how warm was the regard he had for Can
ning. Bad Cannlnar been Pitt's. own -aon, I do
cot think he could have been mora Interested la
til that related t hi marriage.
TBE INCOME OF RAILROADS.
Flsrurea CqtnjaJIed by the Interstate
Commerce Commission,
From the preliminary report on the In
come account of railways in the United
States for tie year ended June SO, 1899,
compiled brittle statistician to the Inter
state Commerce Commission from the re
turns of operating railway companies, rep
resenting 185,2tirS0 miles ot line, received
prior to November 24, tbe following facts
are. taken:
The gross earnings ot the railways em
braced in this advance" report were, for the
year ended June 30, 1899, 1,307,253,484, or
,7,037 per mile of line. These earnings
were assigned as passenger earnings, SS60,
227,319; freight earnings, S913.358.4S8: and
other earnings from operation, J33.6C7.677.
The gross earnings shown In the final
report for 1898 were nearly $60,000,000 less
than this amount- The operating expenses
for the last-fiscal year were J852.428.105. or
J4.602 per mile ot line. The.net earnings,
or income from operation, were $454,825,
379, an increase ot $31,073,304 being shown
in this item for the year. Income from
sources other than -operation amounting to
$49,176,168 was received by tbe railways
included in the report. This amount, how
ever, should not be .accepted as clear In
come from investments to the railways as
a whole, for the reason that a large portion
of It was received as Interest on railway
bonds and dividends on railway stocks
owned, and it is, therefore, largely offset
in the aggregate deductions from income
given below In the 'form of interest and
dividend payments.
The report shows that the total income
of the operating railways Included therein
was $504,001,547. The total deductions
from income, embracing by the term, in
terest on funded debt, rents for leased
lines, taxes ($44,165,714), and various other
charges against income, but not including
dividends, were $371,018,518. This amount
Is $11,327,847 greater than the correspond
ing figures from the complete statistical
report tor 1898. The aggregate amount of
dividends declared by the operating rail
ways under consideration was $82,214,820.
Tho comparative amount of dividends re
ported for the previous year was 866,039,
465. The- combination of the foregoing
Items results in showing a surplus ot $0,
768.209 from the operations of railways
during the year ending June 30, 1899, on
about 98 per cent ot the mileage In the
United States. The corresponding prelimi
nary report for the- previous year, cover
ing 181,333 miles ot line, shewed a sur
plus of $42,604,999.
It should be understood that the present
report, being restricted to the Income ac
counts of operating roads, does not include
tbe fixed charges and dividends of subsi
diary roads operated under lease, since the
income from which they are paid is de
rived from the rents included in the
charges against the Income of the operating
roads.
HONORS FOB HICHBOBN.
The Rear Admiral to Head Three Na
val Bareama.
Rear Admiral iPhlllp Hicbborn is to be
made one of 'the most Important factors In
the future greater navy of the United
States. He is to become the head of a bu
reau which will have exclusive control of
construction ansT "repair, equipping, and en-J
glneerlng. A fill to this effect will be send
to Congress at "an early day by Secretary
Long. . j.
This bill will, practically, abolish the
bureaus of steaA engineering and equip
ment as Independent bureaus, and will give
over 'their -eontrol to Admiral Htchborn,
who Is cow chief of construction and repair.
The cresent heads of the bureaus of equip
ment and engineering will either go back
to the line or will have, other 'Bury till
their retirement occurs.
This resolution of the Secretary of the
Navy will put an end to the disagreements
among chiefs, the only effect ot which has
been delay and a lack ot coherence In tbe
construction of some of the vessels of the
navy. Admiral Hlchbora Is regarded as
the foremost naval constructor in tbe Unit
ed States; he has been tha vital force in
the plans for new ships and modification
of old types, and has also been a factor In
the suggestion ot the three armored cruis
ers lately asked for by Secretary Long and
which ships are to be tbe most powerful
cruisers In the world.
The bill for tbe consolidation of the
bureau will undoubtedly be fought vigor
ously by the old line element, but it is
equally without doubt, considering the
recommendation- of Secretary Long, that
the bill will go through.
If the opponents of tbe bill cannot defeat
the bill they will endeavor to have a line
officer designated as the head of the con
solidated bureaus.
ENQINEKBINff IN THE NAVY.
The Vlrrra of Rear Admiral Melville
I'pon Progress Made.
NEW TORK, Dec. 6. Rear Admiral
George D. Melville, Engineer-ln-Chlef of
the Navy, delivered; an address last even
ing on "Engineering in the United States
Navy; Its Personnel and Material," at the
opening session of the Twentieth Annual
Convention ot the American Society ot Me
chanical Engineers, at the society's rooms,
12 West Thirty-first, Street- Admiral Mel
ville said that it is generally admitted, that
the machinery of our navy has been in all
respects fully abreast ot the latest de
velopments, and sometimes we have taken
the lead.
The Innovation of- triple screws such as
propel the commerce destroyer Columbia
had proved a success, he said, and justi
fied Itself in-the obtaining of greater pro
pulsive efflcitney with, economy, and he
then announced that It Is probable that
three screws would be provided for the
larger ships of the new programme.
Reference was- made to the development
and utilization of two engineering schemes
In the late war, namely, the repair ship
Vulcan and the" distilling ship Iris. The
Vulcan, the admiral said, was fully equal
to any thing, needed for the rehabilitation
of a. jleet short ot a. shipyard and was a
development ot the Idea of taking tools to
the 'work rather than the work to the
tools. He emphasized the assertion that
not only doesrttre creation, but the opera
tion or, maintenance .of f the modern ship
ot war depond'upoa the mechanical engin
eer. The brnilan'cy of the victory oft San
tiago, he said, was due to "the care and
foresight of1 Chief Engineer MUligan, of

A morning paper which is notoriously favoring
the cause of the Boers 'Is so bitter against the
English that it won't even -use the language cor
rectly. Naive Rusticity.
(From thff Saturday Evening Post)
Jessie Bartlett-Davis, who has been prominently
before the music-loving public since the days ot
the Church Choir Pinafore Company, has made
it a practice to attend church services on Sun
day whenever possible. Once she went to a
local revival meeting. The music wa9 led by an
angular young woman, astonishingly clad, and
gifted with one of the most stridently discordant
voices Mrs. Davis bad ever heard. Her singing
was so bad that it fascinated her, but, neverthe
less, it seemed to delight others in the congre
gation.
Immediately after the sermon an old man who
shared her pew showed great interest in her, and
turned witn a saiisnea smtie ana esia:
'I knowed you at-once. You are one of them
opery singers that gave that show last night in

Llent. II. P. Norton Rcfaaed Informa
tion Abont ilie Sew Dentroyers.
Lieut- Harold P. Norton, United States
Navy, Inspector of Machinery for the United
States cruiser Albany, at the Armstrong
shipyards, Newcaetle-on-Tyne, England,
has been having a bard time Of It trying
to get some detailed information about the
tcrpedo boat destroyers Turblnla and Vi
per, which have been advertised as the
most wonderful vessels ever designed In
regard to speed. He was permitted to
Inspect the engine and 'the boiler rooms
ot the Turblnla, but not to see them while
.the vessel was running and he had to be
satisfied with walking around the outside
ot the building where the turbines for the.
destroyers were being built. He was not
even allowed to' look through the doors.
Lieutenant Norton was promised by Mr.
Parsons, the Inventor of the turbines, .that
he should have a chance to witness a run
of the Turblnla or one of the large boats,
but the promise was subsequently with
drawn. Lieutenant Norton managed to get con
siderable information, however; which is
contained In a report to the engineer
chief of the Navy. The turbines, he says, are
placed very-low down In the Turblnla, and
all the platforms arc, above them and very
much cramped. The heat being all. below
the platforms makes tbe engine room very
uncomfortable. He was Informed that It
was almost unbearable. The air pump Is
driven by an ordinary steam engine wblch
is not of good design, and whenever the
boat has been In use it has caused a
great amount of trouble. The thrust Is tak
en up in collars inside of the turbine case.
working In an oil bath with forced lubri
cation. There Is a small Worthington
pump, the same as used In tbe United
States service launch, for circulating the
oil and keeping it cool. The turbines will
sot reverse and this difficulty has caused
some accidents In the case ot tbe Turblnla,
as It is impossible for her to go astern
Lieutenant Norton had a chance to ex
amine the boiler very carefully and he ex
presses the opinion that a large part of the
success; of the Turblnla Is due to her having
a boiler that could furnish ail the steam
that tbe turbines could use and considers
that nearly as good. If not quite as good,
results could have beers obtained with the
same boiler and a well balanced recipro
cating engine.
Mr. Parsons furnished some figures about
the Turblnla, In part as follows: "Total
weight ot main engines, 3 tons 13 hundred
weight; total weight machinery and Don
ers, screws, shafting, tanks, etc., 2J tons;
weight of bull, 15 tons; coal and water,
7 1-2 tons; total displacement, 44 1-2 tons;
maximum mean speed on tbe measured
mile, 37.76 knots: maximum speed reached
34 1-2 knots, maintained for four onsecutlv
hours; calculated propulsion horse power at
32 knots, 980.'
Lieutenant Norton includes In his report
a letter from Mr. Parsons containing a
comparison of the United States destroyers
cow building and the two British turbine
destroyers. "I notice that in the United
States destroyers." says Mr. Parsons, "a
horse power ot 8,000 is specified with a to
tal weight of heading of 190 tons. In our
destroyers we hare guaranteed 9,500 and
expect to reach 12,000 and total weight of
heading of 160tons. Our boilers are about
10 .per, cent.net. Jess both In heating and

Policemen Furulah-Siew Skin for aa
Injured Child.
BUFFALO, Dec. 6. In- an operation that
was performed at the Buffalo general hos
pital this morning it developed that nearly
the entire police department of this city
had volunteered to undergo physical pain
to make perfect the badly burned body ot
the little daughter of one of their fellow
patrolmen, Louts Leaverens, ot the Frank
lin Street station-.
The child, Geraldlne, nine years old, waa
burned from head to foot by a explosion of
fire works on the last Fourth of July and
has since then been in the hospital. All
the burns healed with the exception of a
spot on the back, about three inches square.
When the surgeon announced that a skin
grafting operation would be necessary
offers began to pour in from members of
the police force.
Patrolman Leaverens accepted the offers
from the thirty members of his own pla
toon and they submitted to the operation
today.
One Democrat's Opinion.
To the Editor of The Times: -
Your view of the rapid and sure absorption of
the legislative power by the Executive is forcible
and true. But you are heavily responsible for the
success of tho most daring and dangerous of. ail
the Executive moves in our history the Philippine
treaty. That was originally wholly Presidential,
and was put through the Senate against the free
will of that body. Besides, Its consummation
goes farther to increase and strengthen Executive
influence and power than all the Reed rulesercr
dreamed of. Jfot a doubt oi this.

BALTIMORE. Dec. 6.--AI a meeting ot
the stockholders of the United Telephone
tid Telegraph Company, held yesterday,
tbe Maryland Telephone and Telegraph
Company, of Baltimore, and the Pittsburg
and Allegheny Telephone and Telegraph
Company, of Pittsburg, were absorbed.
Both companies have been controlled by
Interests acting In harmony with tbe Unl
t;d Company, which was chartered under
the laws of New Jersey with a capital stock
ot $5,000,000, to absorb telephone exchanges
Independent of the Bell Company, and to

the Delmarvla Telephone Company, which
operates on the Delaware and Maryland
peninsula. In taking over the Baltimore
and Pittsburg companies it is not contem
plated to make any change; In the plans
now being followed to develop the business
of both companles, and the work now in
progress will be pushed with vigor.
The Washington Telephone and Tele
graph Company, which was recently char
tered, will apply to Congress for a fran
chise to establish an Independent exchange
in Washington. This will also become a
part of the system being built up by the
United Company, and a long-distance line
between Baltimore and Washington will
be built. Henry A. Parr Is president of
the United Company and one of the direc

DADY'S CONTBACT REJECTED.
The llaiaun. Municipality Thinks the
City Should Walt.
HAVANA. Dec 6. The municipality
has. by 12 votes to 3, rejected Michael
J. Dady's contract for sewering and pav
ing Havana. It was argued against ac
ceptance that any such contract should be
approved by an elected municipal council
and not by one nominated. It was also
pointed out that Mr. Dady's scheme did
not include the suburbs ot Vedado. Jesus
del Monte, and Cerro, and was not in other
respects complete
The opponents ot acceptance contended
that Havana, although badly needing a
good system of paving and sewerage,
should wait until some thoroughly satis
factory scheme had been propounded, in
stead of accepting Mr. Dady's contract,
which, aside from alleged imperfections,
would prove far too costly. Mayor La-
coste's special report against acceptance
was very strong.

of Inhuman treatment at the hands of her
stepmother; who at times had beaten her
with a rope and a cat-o -mne-iaus. asu
that on one occasion red pepper had been
thrown Jn the child's eyes. It was said
that Easily was ignorant of the cruel treat
ment ot his child.
