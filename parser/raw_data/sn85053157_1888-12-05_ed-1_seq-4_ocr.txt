T'..E next legislative assembly of Mon

hi- questionr . "Is n:a:ria4e a failure':"
v-.. settled to the satisfaction of a Texas
: .. wvilh.se wife recently presented him
h h six bouncing babies.

dehm;nocratic candidate for governor and
anothier democratic congressman.
L.A,,-rTON.: is SI years old and is still
hae. hearty and vigorous. The "grand
,id man" has lived to some purpose and
is likely to live to accomplish the greatest
work of the age -the restoration of full
c.vil rights to Ireland.
3M.',-N.. As will be favored with view
ing another total eclipse of the sun. The
great event will come off on the afternoon
of the first of next month. It is not often
te new year is ushered in with such a
m:n;,aitient celestial exhibition.
S.:: inspection law will doubless be
c r'at.,l by the next legislative assembly

ramning accidents which has occurred in
býutte during the past year furnish abun
iant evidence that one is needed.
I..F Butte Mining Journal is waging a
re.entless war against the sure-thing men
of that city. If what it says of their op
erations be true that great mining camp
nmust be an earthly paradise for cappers,
card swindlers and thieves. The stranger
,-siting the smoke? city should hold his
rose with one hand and his pocket book
w tih the other.
TiE. Great Falls Tribune suggests that
ckmasters procure spiked straps with a
bell attached to each to put around the
x.ecks of their lambs to keep wolves from t
k.iling the little innocents. The thing t
:miay work like a charm but we have a
mach cheaper and we believe a more ef
fective remedy-catch the wolves and
pull out their teeth.
DELEGATE TOOLE will have his hands
fult: if he accomplishes one-half of what
he is asked to do this winter by his con
s;.tuents. Bozeman wants the Fort Ellis
reservation thrown open to settlement.
M ssoula wants a land office. This north
ern country wants an appropriation for
s.urveys, a land district and a land office.

'iHi F: new 'law in Ž!w Yor provides that
a;fter the first of next "January criminals
sente aced to capital punishment shall suf
fer death through the agency of electric
ity. But it appears the scientists who
have been entrusted with devising the
;particular process by which the victim
will be sent to eternity have not yet re
I,crted success. But the gallows must go
in New York and the fellow that can't
stand lightning must go too.
iDeLrTE certainly has cause to complain.
Ever since the election great clouds of
smoke have hung over the city like a pall,
enveloping it in semi-darkness and im
pregnating the air with a combination of
villiainously smelling gasses. The new ar
rival at the great mining camp would
fancy that Sa ,an was discharging the
smoke and fumes of hades within the pre
cincts of that prosperous city. The smel
ter and mill men should employ means
whereby the smoke will be consumed
where it is generated, and not compel in
offensive people to consume it. It is
horrible.
'i':: RivER PREss may use the
fo.iowing facts in its next editorial
on ' "Benton's Mail Service:" Ten
ieiters mailed at Benton one week before
eleetion arrived at Choteau on the 10th
inst. One of the letters contained impor
tart information regarding an election
oet. and its delay caused the owner a loss
of several hundred dollars. A few days
ago our postmaster received a package of
letters from the Piegan agency addressed
to Benton residents. The package was
originally mailed at Helena and had been
wandering around long enough to make
the, circle of the globe.--Choteau Calu
meTl.
WHEN the post mortem dissectors get
arougtnd to it, they will find opportunity
fcr their exercise in the fact that the dem
ocrats elected everybody on the general
ticket in New York state except the presi
dential candidates, by pluralities ranging
from 2,500 to 18,000. The candidates for
the state judiciary no doubt polled the
straight party vote, without scratching,
and the democrats had about 2,500 plural
ity. Gen. Harrison and Mr. Morton were
the only republicans who carried the
state. The explanations are numerous
enough, but not quite satisfactory. A
good many democrats evidently cut the
heaid of the.icket for reasons, probably
t;he most of them personal.-St. Paul

VOTE FOR DELEGATE.
The following is the vote by counties
r for delegate to congress. It will be seen
that Carter carried every county with the
exception of Choteau and Gallatin coun
ties:
Rep Dem
County Carter Clark Maij Maj
Beaverhead..... .... 909 725 184 ....
Cascade ............. 939 913 26
Choteau ............. 510 732 .... 222
Custer ........... 650 626 24 ....
I)awson ............. 230 213 17 ....
Deer Lodge..........3284 2175 110 ...
Fergus .............. 780 548 232
Gallatin ............ 761 855 .... 94

Lewis and Clarke ...3290 2675 615
Madison ............ 763 655 108 ....
Meagher ............. 848 677 171
Missoula...........2182 1504 678 ....
Park .................1067 677 390 ....
Silver Bow..... .....4381 2841 1537 ....
Yellowstone ........ 556 369 187
Totals.......... 2:3,49 17,358 5.447 316
As may be seen there were 40,847 votes
cast for Messrs. Clark and Carter. As we
have not the full vote for Willson, prohi
bition candidate, it does not appear in the
above. He received 144 in Gallatin coun
ty and probably enough elsewhere to
bring the total vote of the territory over
41,000. At the ratio of 4 for 1 the last
election would indicate a population of
164,000 in the territory. Under the last
apportionment of representatives in con
gress the ratio of representation is 1 for
every 154,325 of population. Hence it
will be seen that Montana answers the re
quirements with about 10,000 to spare.
ONLY A SIMPLE FACT.
The following from the Avant Courier
leaves the impression on the minds of
readers that President Hill did not adhere
strictly to the truth in his conversation
with the Independent writer:
President Hill gave the editor of the
Independent a good one recently. He
told of seeing a second crop of oats on the
Milk river which had ripened this year.
No second seeding was made, but the
oats that had fallen to the ground when
the first crop was harvested, had sprung
up, matured and were ready to be gar
nered.
President Hill gave no "good one" but
only a simple fact. There is nothing re
markable in it, at least in this northern
country. Two crops of oats are frequent
ly raised upon the same ground during a
season. In the court house yard in this
city the third crop of oats has been grown
this year and is now ready for the sickle.
We admit this is a remarkable yield but
the fact can be substantiated .by the affi
davit of the janitor of the court house,
and citizens of the place.
The possibilities of the soil in this por
tion of Montana have not yet been meas
ured. It is prolific in the extreme and
will raise most excellent crops of cereals
without irrigation. An experienced mil
ler from the Red river valley in Dakota
recently visited Benton and stated to sev
eral of our citizens that he never saw finer
Scotch Fife wheat in any country than
was raised in the vicinity of this city.
And the wheat he saw was raised in fields
guiltless of an irrigating ditch.
The soil here is a rich loam resting up
on a clay subsoil and holds moisture when
the lands of central and western Montana
are as d4ry as a s~eGrching sun can make
them. Splendid 'irops . of grain
are raised upon what is catled "adobe"
land and raised without artificial moist
ure. The assertion may not be credited
but we make it nevertheless, that within I
the next ten years there will be more
wheat raised upon the 18,000,000 acres of
reservation lands recently thrown open to
settlement than isnow or will be raised
upon an equal area in any country in the
world. And this grain will be raised
without irrigation.
If the doubtful Thomases could or
would examine the grain produced upon
these lands there would be no two opin
ions as to the fulfillment of our predic
tion. One matter, however, is susceptible
of proof, and that is that Benton can
show a better quality of Scotch Fife
wheat raised in this vicinity without irri
gation than Gallatin or any other valley
in the territory can show where grain is
irrigated. We challenge the territory to
beat it.
_______________________ 4
ABORN'S LOTTERY SCHEME.
The RIVER PRESS is in receipt. of a
marked copy of the Des Moines Leader
in which attention is directed to an arti
cle therein bolstering up Dr. Aborn's lot
tery scheme by which he proposes to dis
pose of a hotel in Iowa's capital. We
know nothing about Dr. Aborn or his ho
tel. He may be conducting a fair, square
lottery scheme. We know nothing to the
contrary. If we did we would not hesi
tate to speak of it. The hotel is valued
at $300,000. From what we can learn it
is not worth one-fourth of that sum.
There is one thing in connection with the
matter that has a bad look. Several gen
tlemen who were at first connected with it
have since withdrawn and publicly an
nounced the fact. Yet the names of two
or three of them are still used in adver
tising the lottery.
Another thing that strikes us unfavora
blyi s the fact that if the scheme is as good
as it is represented to be the millions of
people in the'great state of Iowa, who are
supposed to know something about the
property and the standing of Dr. Aborn,
would gobble up every ticket. But they
seem to let them severely alone an exam
ple which we would advise our readers to
follow.
A MEETING will be held at Jamestown,
Dakota, next Wednesday, the 5th inst.,
to take preliminary steps looking to the
admission of'North Dakota as a state.
Nothing short of two state ftor that terri
tory will now be considered by the people
of Dakota.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Cleveland delivered his an
nual message to congress yesterday. It is
a very lengthy document, containing over
25,000 words. Mr. Cleveland reiterates
his fidelity to the cause of tariff reform
and devotes a large part of his message to
a discussion of that great issue. In mak
ing his last appeal to congress for free
raw material he holds that no compro
mise should be entered into that will de
feat that object. The cause he says is
the cause of the people and for them he
speaks.
Notwithstanding the fact that a major
ity of the electoral vote of the country
will be cast against him, and that Mr.
Harrison will succeed him as the chief
executive of the nation, the other fact
that Mr. Cleveland received a majority of
the popular vote over his opponent sus
tains him in his position that the cause
of tariff reform is the cause of the people.
No one will gainsay that proposition.
The president contends that the public
lands should not be given up to monopo
lies or foreign non-residents, but should
be reserved exclusively to American citi
zens and those who have declared their
intention to become such. Mr. Cleveland
reflects the opinion of all parties in tL,i,
declaration.
The vesting of the title to large bodies
of the public domain in foreign non-resi
dents is extremely repugnant to the aver
age citizen and if such ownership be per
mitted a serious evil will be worked to
the hundreds of thousands who are pa
tiently awaiting the time when they will
be able to make a home upon the broad
prairies of the west. Senator Plumb's
bill, which became a law about three
years ago protected the public lands, in a
great measure, from this evil. An excep
tion, however, can be profitably made, in
permitting the investment of foreign cap
ital in mining properties. The president
doubtless has no reference to this class of
the public lands.
The president's experience in fraudu
lent pension claims leads him to recom
mend the revision of the pension laws in
the interests of meritorious claimants.
The suggestion is a wise one and deserves
the immediate consideration of congress.
No one objects to pensioning the deserv
ing survivors of the Union army but
there can be no two opinious concerning
the advisability of closing the national
treasury to the army of fradulent claim
ants who would rob it of its last dollar if
the opportuniey were offered them.
It is questionable whether the present
congress will be able to carry out any of
the president's suggestions above noted.
There are potent reasons why the senate
will oppose any measure originated by the
house which will add to the popularity of
the present administration. They are ex
tremely selfish reasons but partizans are
eminently selfish and are loth to yield
vantage ground to political opponents.
But in making'his recommendations the
president has placed himself right upon
the record as he understands the right,
leaving it to congress to act as it sees fit.
THE REMEDY.
The Missoula Item, which, by the way,
appears again as though nothing had hap
pened to mar its continued existence,
says: "The mail service hereabouts is
the cause of many complaints, but all be
lieve a remedy will be found by a repub
lican administration."
We have heard something like this be
fore, but take very little stock in the
"remedy." No administration, republican
or democratic, will or can remedy the
short-comings of the present mail service
until more ample provision be made
to carry it on. The population of Mon
tana is daily increasing and all mail mat
ter is correspondingly increasing. During
the past two years over 30,000 souls have
been added to the population of the terri
tory, but if we are rightly informed no
additions have been made in the mean
time by the government to the force em
ployed in the principal offices of the terri
tory. The result is these offices have
been unable to handle promptly the im
mense amount of mail matter forced up
on them, and delays in its transmission
have followed.
Many complaints have been traced to
this cause alone. But we are free to con
fess we believe that in too many instances
the non delivery or irregular transmission
of mails may be directly traced to the neg
ligence, laziness, or pure cussedness of
those entrusted with those duties. The
incoming administration may remedy all
these abuses, but we will be pardoned if
we refuse to believe it at present.
THE fire fiend is picking up Helena's
board structures one by one, and
seems determined to continue his visits
as long as he finds material to feed upon.
We believe Helena has had more fires and
recovers from them quicker than any oth
er city in the world.

house, Campbellsburg, Ind., on learning
that a lady in the village was suffering
terribly with cramp colic, gave the land
lady a bottle of medicine, which he had
with him and requested her to take it to
the sick woman. The medicine relieved
her promptly and she believes saved her
life. It was Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera
and Diarrhoea Remedy, the promptest
and most reliable medicine in use for
bqwel complaints.--Sold by M. A. Flana
