The Xcw York Press on tho
deal's Message.
Presl-
New Yohk, December 7. The
Herald says Grant's Message h that
' of an honest, clear-headed, practical
man. In the reconstruction ' business
he simply looks to the execution of
the laws. His plea for the funding of
the national debt and a gradual re
turn to specie payments will meet
the general approbation of the. coun
try. It coDaiders the Message a3 non
committal on L'unan auairs. it is a
eood business message.
The Times says the Message is one
of erood news throughout.
The World.eays this is the weakest
Message ever sent ta Congress by an
American resident, lt considers
that the Message settles the Cuban
insurrection asrainst the patriots, and
on financial affairs it is Quixotic and
chimerical.
For serious consideration, the Trl-
lune regards the Message as one of
tire wisest and most judicious ever,
transmitted to Congress, and predicts
its hearty approval by the American
people. -

Schenek saidii any member desired
to discuss them, he would yield tha
floor, but would prefer to have all tha
resolutions reported to the Ilousa
and agreed .to withou a general de-j
oatc t
Cox inquired whether the Commit
tee of Ways and Means' was to tako
charge of matters connected with the
resumption of epecie payment, ' or
whether the Comiuittee xtt liankiug
was to take charge of it.
Schenek replied there was no epc
cial reference made to that subject in
the resolutions, lt Eeemed to occupy
a sort of I debatable group d : between
the two committees. Legislation iq
relation to the public credit, to bonds;
to securities, might or might not in-i
volve with it a probable referenca
to the means by which specie pay

gree, to the same thing, lie had sup
posed without entering on-' debatable
ground1 bi' that kind, it wotild be
better to leave the two committees to
endeavor, by communication with
ach other, to dispose of it wi.th somij
tieiree-of "unanimity in action between
themselves. It might be the House
mightjthink proper to raise: another
committeo on the subject, Dut lie
hoped that would not be considered
necessary. TheTsubject connected itf
self with the operations, the business
and tharuutios ir both oomnattees. , ,
': At the'desire of Mr' VTood the res.
olutidn' referring to the Ihter-Oeeanie
Canal was read. It reftrs' to that
portion of themesaagq .to the Com
mittee on Commerce. Mr. Wool
suffsre-sted that it should be referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
as it involved the question of a treaty.
Schenek. said - that as the matter of
a, canal across the Isthmus of Darien
was purely a matter of greatoonimer-
cial interest, it had been thouaht
better to refer it to the Committee on
Commerce.
Lynch suggested that that part of
the mesage relcrring to -navigation
interests belonged to a select com
niittoe'on the subject, j
Schenek said he had two reasons
for preferring reference to the
Committee on Commerce. First, be
cause that was a standing committee,
and was usually given to such com
mittees; and second, because ho un
derstood a select committee had been
created for the purpose of looking
into tho causes of the decline in ship
building, and navigation.
Wood inquired whether the House
could begin to consider the question
cfthe Inter-Oceanic Canal until it
was 'referred to the Committee, and
whether the Committee on Foreign
Afiairswas not the proper committee
for the consideration of questions of
that character.
Schenek supposed Congress might
consider the subject before any addi
tional treaty stipulations were entered
into than , those existing, and that
there was a suSicient understanding
and agreement between the Govern
ment of the United States and the
countries on the Isthmus . to author
ize this Government to eend out the
surveying party which had already
sailed, or was about to sail.
Wood understood there waa an
agreement, so far as the survey was
concerned, but there was no conces
sion of right of way.
:u O'Neil expressed the opinion that
all subjects embraced in the resolu
tion came within the jurisdiction of
the Committee on. Commerce; that,
ia fact, the functions of the Special
Committee ' on Navigation Interests
were ended, or should be. There had
been uo necessity for the creation of
that Committee in the first instance,
the Committee, on .Commerce being
ready and anxious at all times to per
form, jts duties. ...
. Lynch replied that the Special Com
mittee bad been created with the con
sent of most of ; the members of the
Committee on Commerce, and by the
lirma of the resolution it wa3 not re-
3uired before the second Monday in
anuary. lie moved that the por
tion of the President's Message rela
tive to navigation be referred to the
Special Committee. The motion was
rejected.:
Jones,1 of Kentucky; inquired of
Schenek whether Tthe subject of the
recognition of the belligerent rights
of,' the Cuban ' patriots had been
specially referred.
, , Schenek replied that it went to the
Committee rofI Foreign Affairs. He
knew of no-Other Committee that it
could ba properly referred to.
. The resolutions were then reported
to the House and adopted.
