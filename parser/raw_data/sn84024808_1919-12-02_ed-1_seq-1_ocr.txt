(Irani] Rapids, Mich., Der. 1.—L'ne-x
pccted progress was made today by fed
eral officers in preparing the way for an
early trial of the 135 men. including
1'nited States Senator Truman F. New
berry, who were indicted by a federal
grandy jury here, lute Saturday, on
charges of corruption, fraud, and con
spiracy in connection with the Newberry
election campaign in 101K. Service was
secured on a number of those indicted
and first arraignments were held before
Federal Judge C. \V. Sessions, half a
dozen of the defendants appearing in
court.
Two Aknowledge Guilt.
Something of a sensation was caused
when two of those cited in the true bills,
but whose names did not appear in the
list anouncfd Saturday. <-ame before
Judge Sessions and pleaded guily to
counts contained in indictments. There
were William Erick, a Grand Rapids
printer, who pleaded quilty to conspiracy
and was released under bond of SI,000.
and Alek More, formerly a Grand Rapids
editor and later a publisher at Marquette,
Mich., who pleaded guilty to four of six
counts.
Others Scent Indictment.
Several others of the 121 whose names
had been withheld pending receipt of the
warrant, correctly suspected they had
Keen named in the indictment and ap
peared voluntarily in court. The include
George E. Rogers, formerly Grand Rap
ids alderman; George K. Welsh, Kent
county manager of the Newberry cora
paign; Charles Carpenter, a former
member of the (irand Rapids health
Iwiard; and Roman F. Glocheski, said to
have been employed at a salary of $150
a month to work during the Newberry
campaign among the Polish residents of
(irand Rapids.
All pleaded not guilty, Glocheski being
held in $2.500 bail and others in $1.000
each.
Warrant for Newberry.
That a federal warrant had been is
sued for Senator Newberry was indicat
ed when it was anounced that Clerk
Charles Potter, of the federal court had
furnished United States Marshal < »'Con
nor. with one for each of the 135 per
sons indicted.
Speculation as to whether Newberry
will attempt to resist service of a war
rant against him was disposed of when
former Circuit Judge James < ». Murfino,
of Detroit, head of the Newberry coun
sel, announced that the senator will ap
pear in court here next Monday to ans
wer the indictment. In some quarters
it bad been believed that Senator New
berry could resist, service, if he desired,
on tiie ground of senatorial immunity. It
was pointed out, however, that he was
liable to service because the offense
charged against him constitutes a felony.
Arraignment of the remainder of the
defendants is expected to spread over the
entire week, but all of those named in
the indictment. Judge Sessions has an
nounced, must appear in court on or
before next Monday, December 8.

When a Drink Isn't a
Drink Puts Big Kink
* in Prohibition Law
New York. Dec. I.—"When is a
drink not a drink?"
Another conundrum bred of pro
hibition was sprung in supreme court
here. The answer is: "When it is
taken at meals for food or ailment
purposes at home, hotels and restau
ants."
This contention was made by coun
sel for Howard Major as stockholder
in the American Malt and Grain com
pany. a $13.000,000 concern, In a suit
brought against erstwhile directors,
combatting their action in selling out
at a loss to another corporation. The
plaintiff asserted that if they had
äbtained "competent legal advice ' they
would have "known" that the words
"beverago purposes" in the federal
prohibition amendment did not mean
"total prohibition".
Major's counsel declared that "by
legal, economic and phychological de
finition, 'beverage purposes' as used
in the amendment, means drinking
between meals for tippling purposes
and for pleasure only, as at bars and
in saloons" and that restaurants will
"in a very short time be enabled to
sell liquor".
Justice Lazansky remarked that, if
the definition of the term "beverage
purposes" must be gone into, he de
sired time to do it and asked for
briefs.
RAILROADS CLEARED 11
MILLIONS IN OCTOBER;
TIDE TURNED IN JULY]
Washington, Dec. 1.—Railroads under federal control made a net profit of $11,000,000 in
October, although estimated figures showed only $2,000,000, the railroad administration an
nounces in a preliminary report. This $9,000,000 discrepancy, the report explains, is due to re
instatement of per diem charges on freight cars and the coal strike which caused coal traffic
j n t rans jt, and earnings from these sources will be included in the November totals.
The net operating income for the month was about $86,000,000, but due to the causes men
tioned in the report, the income amounted to only $77,000,000. Operating expenses were abnor
mally large, because of the extraordinary shifting of open top equipment in order to furnish the
j max j mum number of coal cars and to large expenditures for maintenance of equipment which was
in need of repair on account of the strikes of shopmen.
For the ten months of this vear the railroads have shown a net loss of $269,<(i8,l >8, but
...
since July net gains have been reported.

WARTIME COAL
RATIONING IS
AGAIN IN FORCE
Washington. Dec. I.— War-time re
strictions on the consumption of coal
have been ordered into effect for the
period of the present strike emerg
ency.
Fuel Administrator Garfield, acting
in conjunction with the railroad ad
ministration, announced that only in
dustries included in the first five
classes of the priority list established
during the war will be furnished coal,
and that public utilities will be asked
to discontinue furnishing power, heat
and light to non-essontial industries
The industries to which coal will
be furnished will bo railroads, coast
wise and inland shipping, army and
navy and other government depart
ments, state and county departments
and institutions, public utilities in
cluding newspapers, and retail dealers
supplying household consumers.
State and local authorities. Dr.
Garfield said, will be asked to co
operate, though tho rationing of coal
will be done through tho regional coal
committees set up by the railroad
administration.
Railroad administration officials
conceded that the application of the
order would mean an industrial shut
down of considerable magnitude, but
declined to undertake a definite esti
mate. Industrial establishments op
erating from their own power plants,
it was said, probably would have to
stop when their present, coal supply
bocame exhausted.
Industries operating on powor sup
plied by public utilities companies
may continue operation unless the
management of the public utility com
panies supplying them and the local
authorities rule that they were non
essential. For the present the rail
road administration will not attempt
to lay down a rule as to what is an
essential industry.

Wilson Merely to Send
Brief Com munication
Today, and Special
With Resubmission;

Peace Resolution In
stead; R. R. Bill Is to
Head Program.
Washington. Dec. 1.—Most of the
features usually attending the opening
were lacking at the convening of the
second— but regular—session of the
Sixty-sixth congress.
After perfunctory sessions, at which
the annua! appropriation estimates, ag
gregating $-1,865,000,000 were present
ed. both senate and house adjourned
until Tuesday, when President Wilson's
message will he read and legislative work
started in earnest.
The senate was in session 23 minutes
and the house remained technically at
work for four hours, but considered only
minor bills requiring unanimous consent.
Can't Deliver This Message.
The president's message, which is to
be read separately in the senate and
house, went to the printer and is ex
pected to be brief. Mr. Wilson's illness
prevents its delivery in person and also
caused a slight change in the opening
program. Instead of appointing com
mittees to "wait" f>u the president, thi
senate and house sent their committees
to Mr. Wilson "notifying" him of the
new session. The note was delivered to
Secretary Tumulty, who replied that the
president would transmit his message
Tuesday.
There were no outward developments
re-carding future disposition of the Ger
man pi .;ce treaty, and leaders were'in
formed that the president probably will
not discuss it in his message. It was
understood that, upon re-submitting the
treaty, the president will send a special
message to the senate.
Take Up Anti-Strike Bill.
Senator 1/odge. the republican leader
and chairman of the senate foreign
relations committee, said lie hoped soon
to press his resolution to declare the .
war with Germany at an end, but in
dicated no immediate action was prob
able.
The senate will begin consideration of !
important legislation Tuesday, when it
takes up the Cummins railroad bill;
with its anti-strike provisions.
Fifty-five senators answered to their
names, while approximately '>00 mem- ;
hers of the house were present. The
crowds in senate and house galleries:
however, were smaller than usual at the i
opening session.

GLASS ASKS FIVEFOLD
BILLION IT COST TO RUN
U. S. YEAR BEFORE WAR
Washington, Dec. 1.—The record bil
lion dollars congresses or ordinary peace
times faded into the past when Secretary
Class, presenting the annual estimates,
proposed appropriations of practically
five billion dollars for condnctingg the
peace-time activities of the government
during the fiscal year 1012.
According to these figures, it will cost
more than five times as much to con
duct the peace-time affairs of govern
ment as it did in the year immediately
preceding the world war.
The greatest individual estimates for
expenditures, of course, go to the army
and the navy. The yearly interest on
the war debt, however, is $1,017,500.000,
which sum alone is greater than all the
appropriations for all purposes whatso
ever of any peace-time congress.
The estimated appropriations for the
principal government departments were
presented as follows:

Pierre, S. D., Dec. 1.—United States Senator Miles Poindex*
ter, of Washington, delivered a short address at a mass meeting
today, as a candidate for the republican presidential nomination
and "challenged Major General Leonard Wood to either debate
with him on national issues or to answer a series of prepared
questions which Poindexter read to his audience.
Senator Poindexter' s address brought
to a rather spectacular close a day of
: conferences and public activities of dele
! gates to their state conventions which
will be held here Tuesday to indorse
party candidates for president and to
j nominate candidates for federal and

The Washington senator, at the out

South Dakota republicans had told him
"it was useless" for him to attempt to

PACT TO SLEEP
Washington. Dec. 1.—Xegitiations for
a compromise ratification of the peact*
treaty have born renewed with the re
rssembling of congress, but the general
feeling of senators on both sides is that
it may be some weeks before the move
ment reaches the stage of format
action.
Republican and democratic leaders
found themselves in agreement that th>>
legislative program be rot the longer de
layed, and that the treaty should not he
brought again before the senate for
mally until a way to dispose of it finally
had been opened by private discussion.
There were indications that the resolu
tion to declare a state of peace might
also -be delayed until important legisla
tion had been cleared away.
The disposition to leave the treaty
side-tracked for the present is expected
by senators generally to be reflected in
the message which President Wilson will
send to congress Tuesday.
In the short sessiou, neither th*
treaty nor the peace resolution was
mentioned, hut there was much private
talk. Democratic senators who ap
proached republicans on the subject wer*
