Increaie of Nearly $9,000,000
Orer Preriou Year.
Establishment of an annual. Instead of
a triennial assessment of real estate
again U advocated by W. P. Richards,
assessor for the District, In hit annual
report made public jesterday. He also
recommends to the Commissioners that
an Increase In the Held force of the
office be asked for, that the personal tax
on automobiles be repealed, that an an
nual license fee based on horsepower be
levied on motor vehicles, and that per
sonal property below the value ef Jl.OOO
be exempt from taxation.
The report shows a total assessment
valuation of l333,JW,9Mv an Increase of
nearly J9.0M.000 In the total assessed
valuation of real eitate In the District
over that of the preceding year. The
real estate tax for the past fiscal year
was J3.0S7.9S1 S3, while for the preceding
year It was JI.9M.3CTJ1. being an Increase
of revenue for last ear or S1S.937M.
It Is stated In the report that the board
of assistant assessors Is nearly through
with the work of the assessment for the
three years beginning July 1. 1914. and
the announcement Is made that appeals
from these new assessments will be heard
by the board of equalisation and review
during Januan. February. March, April,
and May. Mr Richards records that the
work has been done under legislation re'
quiring that the assessor! view every
piece of property In the District, and he
says the force Is entirely Inadequate for
the task.
Personal Tax Falls Off.
The amount of the personal tax levy
fell off about S5.000, according to the
report In speaking of this class of
property, Mr Richards condemns the
present method of taxing motor vehicles
as cumbersome, difficult, and unjust. He
recommends a method based upon the
horsepower of the vehicle, that would
make the tax on an automobile the same
each j ear as long as the machine re
malned In use.
The report shows the gross earnings
of national banks, savings and trust
companies, electric lighting and tele
phone companies, building associations.
