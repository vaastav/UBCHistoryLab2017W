Washington, Sunday December 13, 1S91
The fact tbnt many bills have to l)o intro
duced afresh to Congress nt Iho beginning of
each biennial term, would seem to indicate
that Congress and the people do not cousider
these bills desirable acquaintances.
The reports from Indiana regarding the
Blaino men in that State recall the course of
the Illinois delegation in the late Speakership
contest. The Illinois men met nightly and
passed resolutions pledging fidelity to Mr.
Springer. In Indiana the Blaine men seem to
meet daily and do a little pro forma enthus
ing for Mr. Blaine.
Before giving its unqualified Indoisement
to Senator Gibson's bill for the establishment
of a national conservatory of music in "Wash
ington, The IIeiuld would like to ascertain
whether the handsome junior Senator from
Maryland i6 engineering this schema in the
interest of the Wagner school or the Italian
Echool. The musical public will require an
explicit understanding on this point before
they will tune up in invocation to Congress to
pass the bill.
The enterprise of some newspapers is sim
ply paralyzing. They are not content with
describing an event as it happens, and giving
cuts of it made from instantaneous photo
graphs. To give the news of the present no
longer contents them. They do not feel satis
fied with themselves unless they give the news
of the future. For Instance, one would think
that the assembling of Congress, the election
of a Speaker, the assignment of committees,
and the President's message would give them
all they wanted to fill their columns. But
no. Although the session has not yet really
begun, they aro already talking about ad
journment. This would really seem to be
carrying previousness altogether too far.
President Harrison seems to have caught
the popular fancy with bis message as much
as he did by his speecbes on hi6 celebrated
swing around the circle. There is a general
chorus of approval of the tone, the literary
style, and the arrangement of the document in
which Democratic journals are not 6low to
join. While Democrats differ with the Presi
dent on all the great questions of Government
policy with which he deals in his message, it
must be recognized that he advances bis ideas
with judicial calmness and moderation, and im
parts to the entire document a tone that be
speaks the broad-minded patriot and states
man instead of the politician. The message
is unmistakably 'one of the most admirable
documents issued from the White House in a
long time.
The extraordinary compliment paid by the
House to ex-Representative James Kerr, of
Pennsylvania, in electing him unanimously
and by acclamation its Clerk, was well de
served. Mr. Kerr has devoted himself with
untiring energy and conspicuous success to
the advancement of the cause of Democracy
In his native State, and during his 6ervlee in
the la6t Congress he formulated a plan for the
more thorough organization of the party
throughout the country which met with the
warm approval of members of the Congres
sional Campaign Committee and the National
Committee. Although one of the youngest
members of the Fifty-first Congress, Mr. Kerr
showed marked aptitude and ability iu the
discharge of his Congressional duties and
won the friendship of his colleagues as well
by his genial manners as by bis industry and
enthusiasm in bis work. His couspicuous
fitness for the position of Clerk of the House
was generally recognised and in his election a
good thing haB been done for the party. Ho
will discharge the important duties of his
position with fidelity and intelligence.
In Mr. Crisp the HouEe of Representatives
has selected an able, experienced, and con
servative gentleman to preside over Its delib
erations. No fair-minded mau wJll say that
Mr. Crisp is not entitled on bis record to be
classed as a good Democrat, thoroughly in
accord with the politics of the remocratic
party. No good Democrat, who holds the
Interests of the party above the interests of
any individual or clique in the party, ought
to say that Mr. Crisp will work for the ad
vancement of this or that possible candidate
for the Presidential nomination. There may
be men wjao labored for Mr. Crisp's success
with the expectation that his influence as
Speaker would be exerted airainst this or that
possible Presidential candidate; but it is un
fair to bold Mr, Crisp responsible for the
hopes of these men. Mr. Cri6p should be
credited with sincerity in the professions he
ha6 made of only desiring and seeking to
subserve the bebtfcinterests of the country and
of the whole party until lie shall have done
something to prove the contrary. H&, de
serves the cordial good will and support of
all Democrats, and he will have It.

NEW BOOKS.
Messrs. 0. K McClung & Company, of
Chtcngo, havo performed nn act which musi
cal enthusiasts will thnuk them for In repub
lishing Elizabeth Shoppnrd's romance of
"Charles Auchestcr," by Elizabeth Upton.
This story, which has had a curious historv
audwaswilttenas amcmorial to Mendelssohn,
was first published in England in 1S53. It
was dedicated to Disraeli, who in thanking
the author for the compliment said of thu
work: "No greater book will over bo written
upon music, and It will one day bo recognized
ns the imaginative classic of that divine art."
It was not'a success in England, howover, and
only after America had welcomed it with high
favor did the author's native country give it at
tention and approval. The present edition is
iu two handsome volumes with an introduction
ami notes by Georgo P. Upton, author of
"The Standard Operas" "Woman in Music,"
and other works. Tho book Is on sale nt
Brentano's.
Tho fifth and concluding volume of Chou
ler's "History of tho Uultod States of Amer
ica Under the Constitution" has been issued
by Dodd, Mead & Co. nnd received from J. J.
Decker, of F street. Tho period covered by
this volume begins with the administration
of Polk and tho Mexican war, and closes with
the inauguration of Lincoln. In a note pre
fixed to the volume tho author says: "Wheth
er tho pleasant labor or these mauy years bu
well or 111 performed, 1 may claim without in
ordinate vanity that tho lirst era of our na
tional and independent existence has been
traced out for the first time, and the lonir in
tervening chasm bridged from tho revolution
to the civil war, with historical painstaking,
in tho five volumes of tho present work.
Others may have undertaken the task, but
they have not (so far as I am aware) per
formed it; nor have I profited in any way by
their investigations, whether conducted be
foro or after mo." The author says ho would
like to add one more volume so as to biing
the narrative down to 1S65; "but the literature
of tho civil war Is already very great, nnd I
am admonished at my time of life not to at
tempt to add to it."

In Memory of Suneot Cox,
The beautiful memorial vase contributed,
for by the officers and men of the life saving
Eervice, in grateful recognition of the unceasing
efforts in their behalf by the late Hon. Samuel
Sullivan Cox, was presented to his w'dow at
her home on New Hampshire avenue, this
city, yesterday afternoon. The vase is twenty
four inches in height, of solid silver, and is
rich in the gracefulness and delicacy of its
design. On the face is drawn a realistic res
cue scene by a life saving crew, an excellent
medallion portrait of Mr. Cox being shown
just above. On the reverse of the vase, below
the emblem of tho service, a life preserver
and crossed boat hook and oar, is carved an
eloquent inscription. The ceremonies of pre
sentation were in charge of a committee rep
resenting all grades of the service. The pre
sentation was made by Mr. Kimball, Mr. W.
V. Cox, a nephew of Mr. Cox, acceptinc it on
behalf of his aunt. Senators Frye and Kenna
also spoke briefly.
Bobbing Christmas Shoppers.
The police of the First Precinct are hitving
a lively time In collaring youthful pick
pockets. Yesterday afternoon as Mrs. James
F. Meline, of 1343 Corcoran street, was gazing
into tho Boston Variety store windows she
felt a hand slip into her pocket. Sbe grabbed
the hand and called for help. Officer Nelson
who was near by ran and caught the thief who
turned out to be a colored boy. At the First
Precinct he gave his name as Lewis West, and
in his pockets were found two pocketbooks,
one containing six dollars and the other three
dollars. He was locked up and later his two
pals, Fred West and John Lewis, were ar
rested by Officer Nelson. They also had
several pocketbooks each. Tho boys are
locked up at the First Precinct, where the
purses can be seen for identification.
Injured In a Runaway.
A runaway lumber team on Bennlng's
Bridge Injured three men yesterday morning.
One of them, the driver of the wagon, lies in
Freedman's Hospital in a critical condition.
The team, while crossing the bridge, was
frightened by the shrill blast of a pile driver
enirlne. The driver is named James Coomes,
and he was thrown off and fell on his head, a
portion of tho lumber falling on him. He Is
badly injured, and it is feared he will be a
cripple for life. James Skidman, who was on
the wagon, was also thrown off and Injured.
An Italian named Andrew Carrulppi, who
tried to stop the team, was also hurt. Coomes
and Carrulppi were carried to Freedman's
Hospital, while Skidman was caken to his
home In Twining City.
Presidential Appointments.
It is not likely that the President will make
any new appointments before tho end of this
week. This Is duo to bis desire to first sub
mit to tho Senate action, the large number of
appointments he has made since the 4th of
March last. Their notification to tho Senate
will occupy two or three days of next week.
