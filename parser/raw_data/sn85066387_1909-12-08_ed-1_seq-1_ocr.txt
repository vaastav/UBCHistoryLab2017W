Reports Concerning Daugh*

Quiet Wedding Before Holidays

Future Homes of Portola Queen
Will Be in Rome and
New York
[Special Dispatch lo The Call]
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.— Mrs. Virgil
Bogue. wife of the engineer, has
been greatly annoyed over some
erroneous statements printed con
cerning the engagement of her daugh
ter. Miss Vergilia. Bogue. Tonight she
gave to The Call the following formal
statement:
•Mr. and Mrs. V. G. Bogue of New
York and San Francisco announce the
engagement of their daughter. Vergilia,
queen of the Portola carnival, to Carlo
Lucien Baron, only son of Virginio
Baron, former lieutenant of Italian cav
alary and a great friend of the late
Pope l*eo and the Countess Terdalinda
da Cesarey Bron of Rome and Perugia.
Liberally Educated
"Mr. Baron was educated in Rome.
at the University of Turin and at
Heidelberg, and immediately after his
education left to explore the head
waters of the Amazon, and brought
back to the queen a magnificent col- j
I«vt*«r» -of -orchid*. , He was -then en
g;<^^d in the diplomatic service* and had
a vonspkuous position in the Italian
iegation at Constantinople, where hi
'ived for several years. His father is
of Savoy and balongs to a family which
several times refused a title. He in
lierits has mother's title, and is closely
related to the Baglioni house of Pe
rugia, the Borgias and other well
known Italian families. ,
•He has always had a talent for
painting, and three years ago. when he
came to New York, put it to' use by
doing the interior decoration of several
of the houses of his friends — the Gui
ness house in Washington square, the
Astor house in Fifth avenue, the
Bourke Cocnran house on Long island
and others.
Occasion of Meeting
"He was on a visit- to Lord Grey's
cousin Robin in California when he
met Miss Bogue and remained there
for six months, when he left for Italy,
•whence he haus returned, bringing Mies
Bogue the old family jewels of the
ienaissance for an engagement pres
ent. Several fifteenth century rings
are in the group.
'Owing to illness in the Cesarey
family and the fact that his presence
at home is desired, they have decided
to have a quiet wedding toward the
holidays at the Bogue's new home,
43 Fifth avenue, and sail at once for
' Europe. Members of the Bogue fam
ily only, and four witnesses will be
present. The first plan was a large
\u25a0wedding at St. Patrick's cathedral Eas
ter week, when sex'eral members of
Baron's family could have been pres
ent. But illness has changed this. The
witnesses have not yet been decided on.
They are awaiting the arrival of Mr.'
Bogu«»."
Will Be Countess
Miss Bogue's title at the death of her
mother in law will be Countess Vergilia
da Cesare.y-Baron. r. Baron inherits a
palace in Perugia, a place in Rome and
a country estate. He has an income of
his own that is quite large, but greatly
depleted hi* fortune in his explorations
! and the diplomatic service.
"Th*y expect to live in Rome and
New York,' and in the latter city Mr.
V Baron will probably continoe Iris -worlc
of interior decoration. He is.weU k^u>w;n
in the best circles in New York and
lives at the Brevoort housV with the
duke of Villarosa and another- conn
tryman. He. is six feet one, .h.a.s. th.c ap
pearance of an old Roman and has al
ways been an athlete." -
The Call's correspondent asked Mrs.
Bogue if there is any truth in a San
Francisco report that her husband i«
not heartily in. favor of the daughter's
marriage to a foreigner. She replied:
"None whatever. This report doubtless
arose over correspondence that has
passed between Mr. Bogue and myself
as to the date of the wedding.".

BY a' rising vote that carried not
a single murmur of dissent, fol
> lowed by an outburst of pro
longed cheering and the wildest dem
onstration, half a thousand of San,
Francisco's leading businessmen
pledged .the city; yesterday to hold a great world's exposition in celebration
of^the "opening, of the Panama canal.
/.Just when and tinder what auspices and direction the fair will be held
were subjects left :open T for future discussion, but that San Francisco will
commemorate', the wedding of the two oceans with an exposition that will
rival any, the world has ever known is finally assured. San Francisco's prior
rightrof all cities to become the -world's host on the occasion of the com
pletion-of- 1 the great- waterway was asserted by half a dozen speakers, and
then with ;vociferous acclaim the representative men of San Francisco de
clared- that such right should not -be relinquished.
WILL ECLIPSE ANY FORMER WORLD'S EXPOSITION
San Francisco tis to •be the city of -the Pacific-Panama exposition—
destined even in its, inception to, be more:vast in scope and more magnificent
in ./detail; than? even the Chicago -Columbian exposition of 1593, or any world' 3
fair before/or since-— and'Nvhether/that fair be ; held s in ; l9l3 0r *1916, the actual *
execution of -plans . f,or ; its 1 building already is under way.
, The- sanction'^ of San Francisco' of the plans of those men who years
ago conceived the idea' of; a world , exposition to mark the opening of the
Panama canal was given yesterday afternoon at the big mass meeting on the
floor r< of the Merchants'" exchange." The room was crowded with not less
than 500. men interested in the exposition project, and no more enthusiastic
meeting was; ever, held in^the hall.
PACIFIC-PANAMA EXPOSITION IS LAUNCHED
> s The volume of sound carried in the thunderous "aye" that greeted the
question of indorsement finally put by Chairman C. C. Moore was. in itself
Wv gauge -.of.' the intense enthusiasm of the meeting. "All opposed — " con
tinued the chairman, but there-was not a sound in answer. .Then the crowd
broke every, bound of restraint,! and for several minutes the chamber rang
with cheers, while the whole assemblage stood, shouting, waving hands and
tossinghats. into _the, air. It was at that moment that the Pacific-Panama
exposition. was \ really bbrnJ. . .
! "I niove that raise, a; million dollars on this floor today. I'll start
it;, with ;$5,b00,"; 55,b00," shouted -O.^D. Baldwin, as the tumult subsided.
1 ...*'\u25a0 'Thejsuggestion- was received; with cheers, but others were clamoring to
bY heard and the actual subscription of funds was oostponed for later action.
At, the suggestion 1 of -Milton Esberg, however, a temporary committee of six
was 'named to suggestions and nominate from 100 to ISO citizens
of San Francisco to constitute a committee' of ways and means to take
immediate hold of* the preliminary organization. \u25a0» This committee, as named
by^the/ unanimous .'vote jof^'the meeting, consists of Homer S. King, James
McNab; James Rolph Jr.,, Andrew M. Davis,. R.B. Hale and C. C. Moore.
TI ME) FOR .HOLDING BiCTFAI R NOT DISCUSSED
-.The/time of' holding' the 'exposition was not discussed- by the speakers
wlioTparticipat'ed in .therneetirigi nor was ; the 4 p° ss iblc conflict, of dates with
San- Diego:mentioned.?but-the'tacit understanding conveyed by the whole
sentiment ,of 'the gathering* was; that the time of "holding the fair should
correspond with- -the.-, actual -opening of the Panama canal, whether that
'event 'occur in \u25a0 1913r*1914;- 1915 or even 1916. Director General D. C. Collier
andj. ,\V. .Sefton; jf_.of the San. Diego Panama California exposition com
pany,«representing the interests of the proposed fair. in the southern city, were .
present at: tlie:'niass ''meeting, ;but took no active part in the discussion.
. •• Following the mass 1 meeting, however, .Collier. Sef ton and R. E. Connolly,
press' representative'; of f 'th'e?San v Diego company, were invited to a conference
,withV: representatives--, of^^^the Panama- Pacific exposition in the committee
robnisVof' the": chamber' of*' commerce, where the possible conflict with the
San/ij Diegplplansf was<srjeflyVdi?cussed." No agreement of any kind was
reached," but> it iwas'- finally -determined that committees representing both
Sa^Fra'ncisco^andJSan/D^i^go^should ,meet"at-'a date in the near future in
Los -r'Angeles 'and !; there' attempt to amicably adjust. the situation, so that in
the 'end' each city] might 'have" the benefit of the co-operation of the other in
carrying, outjits plans, i; . T "
SAN pjEGOjJWLL CONTIN UE WITH PLANS,
-. r The discussion insthe-cbrrimitteeroom was a pointed one and at times
b'dfdered\u0001rf^ committee pointed
out^that .San ".Francisco's.; plan ?of; holding an exposition to commemorate
the opening' qf 'the fV Panama^canal'. was inaugurated six-years -ago; that fair
notice'; of .this -intention had been given repeatedly, and; that all the acts oi
the ' Pacific tOcean'exposition-'cornpany, formed" two years ago to promote the

bV^basedfbn. the. opening" of r the 'canal,*: regardless of the year in" which that

* t '* v i? >* ear ? ater - c
refused* to' recede v ,from l the position that San Diego would go ahead with
