AN ATTACK ON COERCION.
TEE IRI?H SECRETARY UNDER FIRE
HIS ADMINISTRATION DKN01NCI1) BY MR. GLAD
STONE-MR, BALFOUR REPLIES WITH
tPIRIT TO THK ASSAULTS UPON
HIM
London. Thc, 3.?The House of Common* went
Into committ".' tonight on the Iti?h estimates.
An appropr ation ol' ri. TOT poonda was laked in
order lo complete th" ian ol 10.707 pounds for
expenses of the Irish Som tn ry's office. Mr. John
K. Kills Liheral moM'd that tho amount toked
he reduced hy 425 pouiuh, his purpose being to
raise a fHKfa] debate on Mr. Ilaif( in's a Imini-tra
tion. Ile charged that tbe Govornni"tit mil u-inij
coercion to such an cx'etit that 1.500 persons had
bren imprisoned since tlu Crimes Act w nt into
operai on. Mr. Balfour, he said, was seeking to
conceal from the people of England th neil of
eruelty i>er|>etrtited in Ireland. He ha I adopted a
system of evasion and ot inarcuraev of sftt mont
with n and without Parliament. The inaccuracy
might arise from ignorance, for Mr. Balfour was
generally absent from his post at Dublin. In this
he was unlike any of his pwdt?H0T_? Seldom or
never had the Chief Secretary for Ireland left his
duties to subordinates. Mr. Balfour's entire ad?
ministration had been cluvact riz< d t>v petty ma?
lignity and calculated brutally, i" Hear, hear!'')

Mr. Balfour replied that. Mr Ellis bad come to a
derk condun.on regarding his iBalfours; moral
character. (Laughter.) He hnd Meased tho Irish
Secretary ot r\?ision and inucci'moy, and of nu
lit uni brutality in his condini.
Mr. Ellis interposed with a correction : ? What I
said was that your administration was character?
ized by those qualities."
Mr. Balfour rejoined: " That does not make
much difference. Mr statements regarding the
situation in Ireland have Invariably been based
upon official reports these beln| luipi h sta i e
that cork! not reasonably be impugned. Men like
Mr. Ellis go about England talking of three
thousand and ether fictitious numbers ol eviction
n< fices, which had been served upon t n int.s,
thereby turning them out of doers and depriving
them of tho right of a free salo and a just com?
pensation for their improvements. He past rbi fl
also that I had suppressed or wantonly prosecuted
the newspapers, nnd that I had imprisoned little
boys for selling these jcuinals. with other similar
nonsense. The Government most earnestly d sires
to enable the people to know the whole truth
about Ireland. If the country OOO- understood
the criminal method- by which pohtleal oijee'.s
were advocated In Iteh'ud. if the character of tho
alliance binding the Opposition were revealed, thc
verdict would not bo with Mr Gladstone." iC-eeia.)
THRUST* ntOM Till. URAND OLD MAN
Mr. Gladstone -who had tome limn Hawarden
in order to ass.st in thc attack upon the Govern?
ment, twitted Mr. Balfour and otiier I.'.. n-er\ a
tives with having sought a siini.ar all.ance on the
eve of the last election. Tho ex-Premier denied
that the Liberals had tonghi a party advantage In
an alhance which arose ti 'in ? c ncurrcme of

MR. BALFOUR aCKHOWXKDGEfl AN FUROR.
Mr. Balfour said that Mr. Gladstone while pro?
testing against strong language, Indulged in criti?
cisms the chief feature of which waa strength of
epithet He i Balfour admitted that ho had fallen
into an error R-gafdiny Earl Sp-mer's treatment
of a member for Dublin Harbor, but thi- mistake
aro>o from defective Information supplied him.
Regarding the case of Kinsella, how was the Gov?
ert men t to blame. 'Hie man who was supposed
to have shot Kinsella wa- air sled, bul tie G and
Jury failed to Indict him and the Jude declared
that there, was no evidence on which t i hold bim.
Mr. Gladstone had refrained inm repeating tho
old story abool Mr. Mandeville being tortured to
death in prison, and he had done so because the
facts in toe ease pioved that Mr Mandeville'- im?
prisonment had DC-thing to Bo with his death.
Similarly, Mr. G.ndstcnc, in his account ol Ihe

THE MURDERER STILL UNKNOWN.
NOTHING BOT* PPKCtn.ATION AP TO WHO KILLKD
PATRICK KELLY AT PARKVILLE
Rut little progress was made yesterday toward the
clearing up of the mystery surrounding the murder
of Patrick Kelly last Saturday night at Parkville,
L. I., although the whole town was excited over the
crime and any number of detectives were working on
'he case. A large BB albee of people visited the place
where the body was found, on the track of Culver's
Railroad, and there was a good deal of talk about ihe
propriety of lynching the murderer, but as yet there
aro not even any positive suspicions as to who he
ls. A great many the >ri"s of the crime were broached
and th" detectives tailed In a mysterious way about
SITCetS that would soon be mad", but lt w-as no*
generally believed that they had discovered any (lew
whatever.
Matthew Ryan, who rode to Parkville from Hrook
Ivn with Kelly early In th" evening, was the last
man known to have seen him alive, ne says that
a man who seemed to he a Mranger asked Kellv fm tno
lime of night Just after thev had cot off the train.
hut he ls doubtful If he could recogelM the man again.
Mr. Lott, Kelly's employer, does not believe that any
of the people of the town were OOBCOCBBd In the
crime, a* Ke'ly had always been on the best of
terms with everybody.
Yesterday afternoon a man wearing a heavy cheeked
ulst-r at:<l an English shooting cap drove up to
Vanderbilt's Hotel. With him were tws> town police?
men. The officers had ball"d 'he man* as hu was
drMng -long the rosd and asked for a ri'o Th*y
said that they did not know their accorrinoda'ln_
fri nd. The stranaer said that lie caine from the West,
inn was a' proeeml employed In one of the stables
at Sheepshead Lay. Me was eastons lo learn the
particular* nf the -larder of Kelly.
The reoe traci stables homed a pool many touch
rhare-tera that wow employed off and on a''ou' the
truck and "uMp;,, Many of ihe crimes that have
teen committed in Gravesend and Coney Island have
been directly traced to the employes of these stables.
The favorite theory ls thal Kelly was followed from
ltro'Hvn bv- tim.- jnc" attn knew ol h's hav'nc
soni'-thlne like ?1,000 In tba booh and supposed tha'
he WOUH h'lve a considerable sum about his person.
Dr -"hench, of Parkville, wh-> examined th" body,
thinks that th" first blow was delivered from In hunt
and that lt killed Kelly Instantly.

DEPORTS TN THE TRADERS' BANK RETRRRED.

for restitution In ca^es Wherein Ibo cheeks were

before collection; but wherein ihe collections wera
made by the receiver after the bank hail Oloaed Ita

least In th" courts ol this Slate. Tho ruling. In
effect, ls that a bank is not a trustee for thc depoaltor
for the collection of checks, and that transactions
of Ibis character which remain uncompleted al the
time ol th" acfcof Insolvency cannot be completed
for the benefit of ihe defunct corporation.
An order will be entered piovdlng fur the re tum by

Judge Shepard's opinion was expected to cover the
question of tin- alleged frauds ol Ihe bank's otllcers In

An alt mpt lo rob Philip Daly, the well-known
sporting mun, in the fiat-house No. 406 Fourth
:ive. yesterday afternoon nearly rrsii'tcd in mur?
der. Daly vvns shot in the left temple, ami ho
li.nl ii narrow escape from instant death. If he
hud hen killed the murd, r would h.ive been ft
mystery that the polie- mitrlit never have been
able to solve. F.ven thouirh he was not hurt
seriously and did not, los.'' his st lf-couiinsnd au
instant, thc robber who tried to kill him escaped,
and the police f.und the case a puzzling one at
best.
Philip Daly has been the most noted immblcr
in this conni rv staoc the death of John Mor?
rissey. His * Philadelphia Clal>Hosae" kt Long
Braaab is frequented every Miram.t by men who
piny for large stakes. If is Hued up in extrava?
gant style ns a restaurant and pram bli rg-rootn
He also ha* had a costly gambling place in Pliiliw
delphia for years. At Hm horse seats g| all of
the lendini: tracks in the country he hss bega a
familiar lip-iire. Ile is fifty-three years of age
and ?ell preserved, somevvll.it below the medium
height, but heayily built, with a square, hard
looking face, pray bair and thick gray mustache.
Ile s wilds part of his time in this city, and is
slid to be Interested in a gaming resort in tho
Nineteenth Precinct. Lately lie has been stay?
ing at the Coleman Mouse. On Sat?
urday he received a letter from " Ad?
die" Stanton, a yoong woman with whom
had some chance aci mai uta nee. Slio wrote t'.iat
she was staling With a friend at the flat-liotise No.
tort Fourtli-ave., ap two (lights of stairs, and
would like to see h m after noon ycxt rday. Ile
determined to keep the appointment, and shortly
before A p. ni. yesterday he started in search of
the vouni: woman Ile was will dressed in a
black ciituwav, and ni his shirt-front blazed li s
big diamond pin, said to be worth Sj.ooo. Ho
found the Stanton wi man In the front parlor
on the third floor of the Hat-house.
The door was let about six months ago to
Mis. I Ila Hammond, a wi man of apparent re?
spectability and thirty penn old. Her husband,
Henry ll ilumond, is said to have been employed
a- steward al the Grand Union Hotel at Betatege.
The connie lived together qa orly m the Hat. and
did not attract ene unfavorable notice. Three
weela ago tlc Stanton woman, said to be a Mend
of Mrs. Hammond, went to live in the Hat.
Otiier occupants. _i tlc house knew nothing more
about ? net. The Oat rn which the
Hammonds lived consisted of a large
flout i-iiii'i', two dar!; bedrooms and a kitcii.ti
in the rear. All the rooms are connected by
doors, and fmni the hall are doors opening into
the parlor and the kit eli n.
TWO MASKED MEN ATTACKED HIM.
Haly had been fri Iring in the parlor with the
Manion woman abott! twenty minutes, when the
double doon leading to the back room were ilunq
open, Two men appeared in the doorway. Both
wore OTorooata and hat*. One of th?r_ raised his
bal (es the doors opened and a thin white hand brr
chu I tell across his fae like a mask. The linen
was i.isi-ned to tin- hatband ia such a manner
thal after the uinn i .1 his hat back on his
In ;id, his fe;.t up's wei-, con .'I'd a- by a thick
veil. Aa he settled his hat on his lund with his
left bend he rained bis mot band, and a revolver
Bashed in Hilly's face. Il bind the hapdkerchiaf
a gruff but unsteady roioe was heard by the
Marl led gnnililer, apd he under,! ood the wm
I .?: " Hold np your hands'"
i'.'. showed noir, instantly.
lb-- Interruption had been as dramatic as a
sc ne iii a Stage tragedy, and it almost took Daly's
bnath away. His eves hud been fastened on the
man with the mask, and he had scarcely noticed
the other man, who Stood a little in the rear, just
within the darkened bedroom. He instantly di*
vu .il that robbery was Intended, and the thought
maddened lum. In his pocket- he had nearly
30.000 in Governmenl bouda and 13,000 In saab,
a much larger sum <>1 money than be u.sua.l, car?
nell un his j* rsoB, With the .'ju i"--dc of tue re?
volver pointing directly at Ins head, the situation
was enough :o frith t n a weaker man, but 1 Ja ly
madi :?? rush across the n-fin at the masked robber.
Ile was aimosi mar enough to strike when there
tnt a Bash and tm' bullet f.om th?
revolver struck his temple. The shot
staggered lum. bul he did not tail. Before ne
could renew the attack bo'li robbers had run
through the rear rn ma and had escaped down the
-lairs to the avenue. 1 'nlv followed them down,
lint they were oui ut light ami sab- from pursuit
when be reached the sidewalk. He shouted tor
a pub.em-ii. and pit rn.man Iien/.e, of the Nine?
teenth Precinct, soon answered tin- call. Herne
aa.I not -cen th" esc ipmu robbers. Haly walked
with the polie. it an Into the drug store of Kub?
alli Pingerhut, neal door to the Bat-houae. ami
1 ihal a physician be sent fur nt once. Mood
Bowing over his I.ic- from tb'' wound iii
bli temple, hut be was in a lowering rage and did
did not seem lo mind the pain. He gave
the policeman a brief account of the
attempt ai robbery and uracil him to take mena*
urea to capture the robbi rs. Hen_e sent, word
?,, thc Puru th Streel Police Station, and Captain
Reillj and Detective hayes Mam weal to the Hat
house.
Till. BALL STIUTK AHOVE THE ETEB80W.
Dr. 11 uss,,ii, nt No. :;i Bael Twenty-tifth-st., waa
ealh il io the dm 601 t I look at Daly's wound.
Ile found that a bullet had struck the gambler's
forehead about two inebte above th" left eyebrow,
and had torn a ragged lurrow in the ?calp, nearly
lo ir laches long, glancing on the skull and leaving
ile- bone hare at ile bottom of th- furrow. It
was an _g|r hm pot dangerous wound. Powder
marks on the forehead ch,se to the wound showed
that ihe revolver mist have been within two
t"i ol Delve bead when the shot waa Bred.
Hr. Buaaon Judged that the barrel of the weapon
must have been inclined upward at au angil tn
Halys foreh ad. or the ballet mu*! have penetrated
Hie brain. Probabl] the robber waa nervous and
hi- band shook when h<? aimed the shot.
When h s wiiund had 1.n dressed. Daly pulled
out a big roll nf l. IK from |, ? p.,rket and pa d the
druggist and physician for their gerrieea, Then
he wi it tn the pol ce station with Hence to mak'

TH" woman was MtftJ-STBO.
It waa believed 'bat the Stanton woman was
an accomplice of the robbers, and ihe was locked

to piles of ruins. Three men ants Billed, and three
perhaps fatally hurt. Tho killed aro : Richard Pearce,
I aaglaoer; Jacob Voigart, fireman; winiam Eider, _re

Bokarl Rhode, brakeman; Jamos Hoisider, brakeman.
The conductor and the other brakemen escaped w,th
1 slight Injuiles. Tho fast freight trill) for Easton
and .Vew-y.irk pas.cd here at _:0M, one hour and forty
minutes behind time. Its orders were to mn to Solo

hound fast freight triln from New York was also late
aud at Pcnohscot received orders to run to iglomOB's
cap and thece receive further onie rs. Engineer Ilaire
slackened speed at the flap and sever.l mea got on
board. A red light was displayed, but tho men
told him, as U alleged, that there were no orders, and
that everything was all righi and he pulled open the
throttle. A mlle and a half down the road, and while
running at tho rato of twenty miles an hour, he saw
the head light of tbe south-hound train approarhlnR on
the single track. It was only a hundied yards away.
There were two shrill, piercing whistles blown slmul
taneuusly, then a terrlb.e crash, a grating of car tim?
bers), cries of pain and agony, tho hissing of steam, the
Iasblllg around of men with lanterns, the appeals of
the injured for help, all followed hy a so.emn stillness
and a fooling of anxiety and sadness to those whu
escaped with their lives. It was dark and the work
of o.-mlnatlon hy thc few whoso bones w?.-re sol
i broken w*> painfully slow. The headlights had been
extinguished, tho engines were BBMUbSd tj plecos, the
lc av j- Irons twisted like twl(p Into every ounce vable
sliM"', and there was nothing to guide th-; woiUers
CXOept two common car lat.terns. A mountain of
ruins confronted them. Cars were splinteied to
atoms, and their contents piled all mund. There
was no semh'aneo left of either tr-in and but little
remaned of the huge locomotives that a few minutes
before were pintlng and puflliiR at the command of
th?lr masters. Word was sent t" (solomon's (lap. and
to Penotiscot, aud a large number of section hands,
rallroid.r. and others soon gathered on tho spot.
The work of _etting at tho dead and Injured men
hidden under Ce vast pile ot debris was a slow and
laborious undertaking. Tho tlrst mai reallied wa-,
Engineer Howorth. Conductor Campbell found him
WS ged between tho Irons In the cab, which was
coveted with wreckage and lying upon Its side. His
h:.nd wai still on the lever and his left side was
badly scalded by the escaping steam.. Tho next man
who was rescued was Enciti er Richard Peirce. He
was fu..nd beneath the r ma ns of his engine, with
h.t. .efl leg broLou and hu body braked. He d ed
later In tbe day. The two Bremen, Volgari and Eli er.
weie not found for sever?! hours, when their boll's

them must have been Instantly Uilied.

reed, Mckinley, cannon and burrows are
the favorites so far.
Wa-hl-gton, Dec. 3 (Special..?At least four avowed
candidates for tho Speakership of tho List < -ingress

who received the caucus nomination at the beginning
of this Congress; Major McKinley, of 'duo; Mr. Can?
non, ol Illinois, and Dr. Burrows, of Michigan. All
of these aro good men, strong men. and any ono nf

Wa?hlngton, Dec. 3.?The second and last tension el
tho I.th Congress opened to-dav amid the old fsmllfar
surroundings, but under circumstances far different
_MB those which attend d the opening of tho first ses?
sion. Tho same well-known faces greeted you. hut
somehow they wore a different look. The Democrats,
triumphant and patronizing a year ago, looked very
meek to-day. Tlie countenances of tho Re, ubilcans,
on thc other hand, were wreathed in smile*, and they
scted Uko men who might forgive much, and perhaps
even forget some thing.
Tho waaiher was such m to make everybody feel
contented. Tho air was bracing. A light brees*
stirred tho leafless branchs.; of the frees, and aa the
hour approached for the assembling of i.'ongrc?i the
sun broke through the clouds. Capitol Hill, of
course, waa tbe centre toward which everybody in
Washington made bis or her way In tho morning
hours.
What Is true of every other opening session h)
true also of this. The galleries w;re crowded ISSbf
before tho hour of meeting at noon. .hey were oc?
cupied mainly by la-lb-., si rangers and VMtOSB lo
town. The gay colors of t.'eir altin, were tn strlklne
contrast to tbe sombre dress atfected bv th^ average
legislator. Tho lute |?.* tn knickerbockers, and

HOW THE VARIOL? SENATORS APPEARED.
Punctually at noon Mr. IngalLs, tho piesident of thi
Senate, passed from the rear door of the chamber,
preceded by tho chaplain. Ht wore a white rose In his
buttonhole, and looked ten years younger a' least
than on tho day when be adjourned the senate in oe
tober last. There wore nearly tory five senator*
present when tho chaplain opened th-' poceedlngs wltb
prayer. That part of tho ccteinnny finished, greet?
ings and handshaklnirs became the order "f Hie day to
the exclusion of all other business. Mr. Edmunds had
nothing but cordial greetings for everybody that crossed
his path and made Himself thoroughly agreeable even
to Democrats. Ills colleague from Vermont. Mr Mor?
rill, who was compelled to leave Washington early lo
the summer on account of his health, ls fully resinn-d
again and seems to bear tho weight of bis y -ars lightly.
"t)ld Man" Saulsbury looked nniy as a man who has
pulled Ids awn house about his ears can look?morose,
sullen, unhappy. Ho met tho reproaches of bis friend!
by saying: "Eather than have that young rooster,
who has studh'd law In my office, get ihe seat I now
occupy, I would see a Republican .-senator from Del?
aware. ?
?' Pan-Electric Harris, of Tennessee, wore an un?
usually wise mien and looked more than ever Ilks
a mandarin on a t.-a chest, with his head ?-hilling like
a billiard ball and his drooping white mustache.
Sawyer, rollicking, kindly, shrewd, old gentleman that
he |6, loved and esteemed by all his friends-aad ho
counts thom by the thousands?s?emed to have balea
a now lease of life, and moved about the Senate
Chamber with the agility of a youth of twentv.
Blackburn wes the epneanre of ali eyes, but he had
a v.-ry peaceful and bland look on his countenance,
nothing whatever suggestive of pistols and gore. Ho
strolled about, with frvi.1 dignity and self posses?
sion, but no one, as far as is known, mentioned the
name of Rucker to him. sherman looked thoroughly
happy and contented. Allison had a diplomatic smile
and a few voids for everybody. Eiistls seemed to
view the proceedings as through a ula*- darkly with
tho disinterested Indifference of a spirit from another
world. For all practical patpOSSS he ls a political
corpse. Hawley boro himself with the proud air of
a twenty-four hour old father, but received the con?
gratulations of his colleagues and admirer* with
characteristic modesty. Vest seemed a trifle de?
moralized as If he had como out of that " struggle to
tho death'' somewhat damaged, hut he tried his b-'sl
to look pleasant?which ls saving a good deal for Vest.
NEW-YORK'S SENATORS WERE, MIS-INK.
Those conspicuous for their absence ams ino two
Now-York Senators, Messrs. Evarts and Rlaeeek, and
Mr. Quay, of Pennsylvania, on tho Kepi! luau side.

much to the di appoiii'ment of tho crowd nf Virginia
