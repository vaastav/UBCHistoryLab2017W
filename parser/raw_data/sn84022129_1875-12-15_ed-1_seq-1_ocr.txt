WASHINGTON, De 8.—The President's
message was read in Congress yesterday
afternoon.
The message opens with a brief review
of the advance made by the coantry in
tbe first century of oofr nation's Inde­
pendence in industrial progress. He
then presents the opening of the Second
Century as an appropriate time to study
what is most needed for the good of the
nation, and urges the necessity of
POP0LAB EDUCATION,
and recommends a constitutional amend­
ment requiring each State to afford op­
portunities for a good common school
education fo*' every child, prohibiting
sectarian teaching in any school sup
ported or partly supported from the
public funds, and making education so
far
COMPULSOBT
as to*prohibit persons who cannot read
and write from voting* or becoming
voters after 1890,
DISFRANCHISING NONB,
however, wno are already voters when
the ametidinent, takes effect.
TAXATION OP CaUBCHES.
Next he considers tbe large amount
of property accumulating by churches,
and untaxed, and recommends a consti­
tutional declaration that
CHUBCH AND 8TATB
are. forever separate, each free within
its proper sphere, and all church proper­
ty to bear its proportion, of taxation,
cemeteries only to be exempt, and sug­
gests action toward limiting the vaiue
of cbuich edifices if remaining exempt.
CUBA, I
The Cuban situatoin is discussed at
length with reference to recognition ol
the independence or belligerency of the
Cuban insurgents, the conclusion being
that recognition of either would not be
justified by existing facts, but the
PROLONGED CONTEST,
injurious ty other natiuus and revolting
to the civilized world, must sooner or
later
LEAD TO INTERVENTION
by this or some other government un­
less mediation is accepted by both par
ties, to the strife. While he does not
recommend intervention, he is ready as
the
EQUAL FRIEND
of both parties to respond to tUe sug­
gestion to the end that through the good
offices of the United States an honora­
ble peace may be brought about. The
bpanish Government has submitted pro­
posals which may iorin a
BASIS OF AGREEMENT
for tbe reutoval of all causes of com­
plaint by this conntry.
BUT
should our hopes for a satisfactory ad­
justment of our affairs and the early
restoration of peace in Cuba be disap
pointed, the President will make a fur­
ther communication to Congress, with
recommendations, during tUe present
session.
MEXICAN AFFAIRS.
Regarding Mexican free traders en­
couraging smuggling and border depre
datious, representations have been ad­
dressed to the Mexican Government,
but
WITHOUT APPARENT EFFECT,
.and th« experiment of naval patrol of
the Rio Grande is being tried, the mili
eary force being inadequate to guard
itie line even at the few points where
the
INCURSION OF THIEVES'
and crossing of smugglers is usually
made.
OTHER RELATONS.
'With other'powers the relations of
the Government are eminently satis­
factory.
Vj .FRAUDS
ijri naturalization and exportation are
treated at length, cases of which are fre­
quently brought to the attention of'the
lioveriiment through our consular and
.iipiomatic representatives, and legisla
tton guarding against such frauds is re­
commended.
SPECIE PAYMENTS.
The better to reach the objects sought
so be accomplished by the ac- pre iMg
uig speeie payments in 1879, repa il o!
-o much of the legal tender acts as make
those .notes tender for debts c«.ntrauteu
ifler January 1st, 1877, is recommended,
.Hid that the Treasury be authorized
redeem two million dollars legal ten
iers monthly by issuing long bonds,
tearing interest at the r»te of 3.55 pei
innum. It is also recommended that
che Treasury be given the power to ac
oumnlate gold lor final resumption b^
urtailing expenses and increasing thi
revenue. The restoration of the
TARIRR ON TEA AND COJTPEB
is recommended, and the addition o'
ither article to the free list which art
materials for manufacturers.
VERIFYING CLAIMS.
A better method for vending elaim
in
against the Government is needed, es­
pecially for claims arising from the late
war. Claims allowed, teing proven
b«r testimony according to present laws,
are
GENERALLY FRAUDULENT,
being in amount more than the indi­
viduals making the claims ever had to
lose.
The President indorses the following
WAR DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDA1 IONS
That $300,000 subsidized appropria­
tions be made available for supplying
distant posts prior to the beginning of
the next fiscal year.
The emolument system of annuities
for families of deceased officers to be
succeeded by voluntary deduction from
monthly pay.
Repeal tbe law abolishing milage,
and retarn to tbe old system.'
Appropriation for trial of torpedoes
by engineer corps.
Permanent organization of tbe signal
service corps.
Renewal of appropriation for compil­
ing official records of the war.
THE SATY.
This branch of the public service is
described as being in a generally im­
proved condition, but in the opinion of
tbe President it would at .this time be
wise at once to afford means for the im­
mediate completion of the five double
turreted monitors now undergoing re­
pairs slowly, from the savings of the
Department. Over fifty effective war
ships, including fifteen monitors, are
now on hand on tbe Atl tntic coast.
BLACK HILLS.
The President says the discovery of
gold in the Black Hills has had the
effect to induce a large immigration of
miners to that point. Thus far the ef­
forts to protect the rights of the Indians
of that section has been successful, but
NEXT YEAR
will certainly witness a large increase
of such immigration. Negotiations for
the relinquishment of the gold fields
having failed, it will be necessary for
Congress to adopt some measures to re
lieve the embarrassments wbich have
grown but of the situation. The
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR
suggtsts that the supplies now neces­
sary for the sustenance of that people
being no longer obligatory under the
treaty of 1868, but simply a gratuity,
they may be issued or withheld at his
discretion. In
CONCLUSION
the President notes the evidence cf good
will on the part of foreign powers, as
shown in. their preparations for the
Centennial celebration. He briefly re­
fers to polygamy in Utah, and importa­
tion of
CHINESE WOMEN",
with vigorous recommendations of leg­
islative measures against both, and
closes with a re-capitulation of his re
commerdations ending with tfie recom­
mended enactment of such laws a« will
ensure a speedy return to a
SOUND CURRENCY,
such as will command the respect of the
world.

MOLLYTMAGU1KB MURDERS.
POTTSVILLE, PA, Dec. 11.—Three
Molly Maguire, murders near Mahony
City were reported yesterday. The vic­
tims
were two men and one woman.
They were shot by masked men, it is
supposed, to prevent their giving evi­
dence concerning former murders. The
killed are Chas. O'Donnell and a Mr.
McAllister and sister. Frank Ulricb, a
merchant in good standing at Mahoney
City, was arrested as one of the mur­
derers.
