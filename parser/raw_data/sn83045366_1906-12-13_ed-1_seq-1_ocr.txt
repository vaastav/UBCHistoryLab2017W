Advocates Inheritance and

IVIEWS MORE RADICAL
THAN THE PRESIDENT'S
Tariff, Rebates and Franchises
as Chief Basis of Colossal
Incomes.
CARNEGIE IN LINE.
New York, Dec. 13.Andrew Car
negie, in an address before the Na
tional Civic federation today, said that
he believed the major portion of the
estates of enormously wealthy men
should go to the state upon the death
of the possessor f the fortune. Mr.
Carnegie opposed a graduated income
tax.
New York, Dec. 13.Advocacy of
the president's views of inheritance
and income taxationsupplemented
by even more radical suggestionsby a
rich railroad man, famous from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, was the feature
of today's session of the National Civ
ic federation. The speaker was Mel
ville E. Ingalls, chairman of the board
of the Big Four railway and high in
the offices of other important corpora
tions.
Mr. Ingalls spoke in part as follows:
"The real thought, I think, running
in the minds of the people is: Are the
large individual fortunes which have
been and are being made today, a men
ace to the prosperity of our country,
and if so,'how can they be limited?
There have been in the last few years
three prolific sources of multi-million
aires which are open to criticism.
Sees Two Remedies.
"The first, in the minds of some of
us, is the tariff, which should be modi
fied. The second cause of the growth
of those largo fortunes has been ille
gal favors and contracts given to ship
pers by the railroads. I trust this is
happilv ended. The third cause of the
production of large fortunes has been
the securing by means which were
questionable, of contracts at nominal
prices for the use of the streets of va
rious cities for the purpose of trans
portation and lighting. There are two
remedies for this. One is to make
contracts such as a private individual
would make, for the use of the streets,
reserving proper rentals and a proper
division of the profits for the future
and the other is for the municipali
ties to take possession of the light
ing and street transportation.
Approves Income Tax.
"With reference to limiting these
fortunes by an income tax, I have
come to the conclusion that it is the
best and fairest tax that can be lev
iedbut as a tax, like other taxes, for
the support of this governmentnot
for the purpose of destroying proper-
tios-*-that would be socialistic. I
don't believe in a graduated income
tax, for I think that would be putting
a tax on thrift and energy. I would
tax all incomes of $1,000 or over.
I am in favor of the inheritance
tax as a tax for paying the expenses
of the state, like other taxes. It is a
question whether this is not more of
a matter for each state to take up by
itself. If it cannot be managed in
that way, then the national govern
ment should take it up.
Wills to Be Limited.
I would also enact legislation,
either by the national government or
by the states, that no man should have
the right to dispose of the bulk of his
property by will. I would take away
from any citizen the right to tie up his

of the presidents for, two purposes:
one to indicate the views of our' for

contrast between them- and the~present
occupant of the White House. Mormon
ism is more insidious, more dangerous
and a greater menace to our govern
ment and civilization today than it
was at any particular period when
these messages were addressed to con
gress. Yet President Roosevelt does
not deem the subject worthy of men
tion in a message filled with sugges
tions.
The non-Mormon citizenship of Utah
and of Idaho think they are entitled
to the support of law-abiding citizens
everywhere in their efforts to main
tain American citizenship in these Mor
mon states^ and if they cannot receive
that, they have the right to demand

FOMEWLAWS ON
Leaders Agree on Legislation That
They Will Strive to Have
Passed.
Journal Special Service.
Washington, Dee. 13.President
Eoosevelt and leaders in congress have
a tentative program of legis
for the present session. This
program contemplates consideration
and passage if possible of the follow
ing measures:
Prohibiting corporations from mak
ing campaign contributions.
Granting the government the right
of appeal in criminal cases.
Reduction and finally removal of the
tariff on all Philippine products enter
ing the United States.
Authorizing ship subsidies for par
ticular lines.
There are other measures President
Roosevelt would like enaeted, notably
those restricting immigration and re
forming the currency, the latter along
the lines suggested in his recent mes
sage and not in accordance with the
bankers' plan, which he recognizes
has absolutely no chance of favorable
action.
Other Pleas "Feelers."
When President Roosevelt wrote the
section of bis message relating to in
heritance and income taxes he did so
for the purpose of creating discussion
and not in expectation that congress
would adopt this proposal. Indeed, the
president stated in his message that a
bill to this effect, should be passed only
when the general system of taxation
of the government was revised.
The president recommended also the
enactment of a law for the naturaliza
tion of Japanese, but he recognizes it
is impossible in the present state of the
temper of the two houses to secure such
legislation, nor does the Japanese gov
ernment want it.
REICHSTAG DISSOLVED
House Rejects African Budget and
Kaiser's Message Is Read.
Berlin, Dec. 13.The reiehstag to
day by 178 to 168 votes rejected the
supplementary budget for German
Southwest Africa and Chancellor von
Buelow read an imperial message dis
solving parliament.
Herr Spahn, the clerical leader, re
ported on behalf of the majority of
the appropriations committee that it
was their conviction that the number
of troops in that colony could be re
duced to 2,500 men, altho the govern
ment affirmed that the present gar
rison of 12,000 could not be reduced
below 8,00ft men. The chancellor re
plied that to reduce the garrison to
2,500 men would mean the loss of the
southern part of theeeolony and would
greatly endanger the central and the
northern parts,, while German rule in
Africa would be imperilled ,by a re
newal of the, insurrection in German
Southwest Africa.,

Indictments Brought in Min
neapolis Declared Void
Lacking Legal Basis.
Arguments on the demurrers inter
posed by the railways and grain firms
charged with giving and receiving re
bates in the indictments returned by
the recent special federal grand jury
were begun today before Judge Wil
liam Lochren and Page Morris of the
United States circuit court, in the Min
neapolis federal building. Counsel for
the Omaha and Great Northern rail
ways and for the Ames-Brooks and Mc
Caull-Dinsmore Elevator companies
and the Duluth Milling company were
heard. Their main contention was
that the Hepburn bill had repealed the
provisions of the Elkins act under
which the indictments had been found
and that its peculiar phraseology was
a complete bar to the present action,
even tho-the offenses had been commit
ted as' alleged.
The United' States is represented by
District Attorney Charles C. Houpt
arid his assistants, J. M. Dickey and
Paul Ewart.
Attacked Indictments.
".Judge, Thomas Wilson, general
counsel for the Omaha, began the at
tack on the indictments. He called
attention to the fact that the United
States- statutes recognized the legality
of terminal charges by providing that
they be included in the published rates
in order that there might be nothing
underhanded about them. He pointed
out that "icing, terminal and stor
ag e" charges were specifically men
tioned.
"The Soo has its own elevators at
Gladstone, on Green Bay," said Judge
Wilson. "If we wish to build up our
line to the great lakes so that it can
compete* with the Soo, we must give our
patrons the same advantage. What law
says that we may not say to them that
we have no elevator, but we will put
tbeir wheat in an elevator for them?
If we did not, it would give all the
traffic \f6 the Soo and kill competition,
the very thing the law seeks to foster.
'I believe in and commend all legis
lation to make the railways obey the
law and prevent discrimination. It is
wjse. If the government would only
use its power to punish the guilty, it
.would bb well. I hope this court'will
T!O rnle in'this case as to put an end
to- these prosecutions, which tend to
bring" this law into- disrepute.
Law Not in Effect.
/'The law under which this in
dictment has been returned is not in
effect since the passage of the Hepburn
law. This is common statutory con
struction. In its repealing clause the
Hepburn act states expressly that it
shall not affect 'causes now pending.*
This does away with the general rule
that a new law does not cancel of
fenses against the old law. I am con
vinced by the dissimilarity of the lan
guage of this clause and a similar
clause in the Elkins law, that it was
the deliberate intention of congresS'"to
cancel all such previous offenses except
those already before the courts."
W. R. Begg, for the Great Northern
railway, followed closely the argument
of Judge Wilson. He pointed out that
the indictments must lie under the El
kins law and District Attorney Haupt
admitted this.
He then took up the great point of
dissimilarity between the two acts.
The Elkins law, he said, made all re
bates, whether intentional or not,
crimes. The Hepburn low, by the use
of the word "knowingly," introduced
the question of intent.

Kellogg &
Severance appeared for the three ele
vator companies. Judge Wilson made
some objection to his speaking at that
time, but upon Mr. Severance explain
ing that he wished only to add to the
argument on the repeal of the Elkin
law, he withdrew his objection.,
Mr. Severance further elaborated the
preceding arguments and then said:
"Up to 1906 every person accepting
or giving a rebate was guilty of a
crime, regardless of the question of
criminal intent. This was manifestly
unfair as only an expert rate clerk
could know if a rebate were given and
there were thousands of innocent per
sons who technically violated the law.
It is the evident intention of congress
in the Hepburn bill to wipe the slate
clean and start afresh on a more equit
able basis."
The federal counsel did not reply un
til after all the counsel for the defend
ants had been heard.

YOUNG SEEKS TO
StH HILL'S HAND
Attorney General Would Prevent
New $60,000,000 Stock Issue
by Great Northern.
Edward T. Young, attorney general,
will take legal steps in an endeavor
to prevent the proposed issue of
$60,000,000 of new stock by the Great
Northern road, unless that company
can show to the Minnesota railroad
commission the need for the additional
$60,000,000, and at the same time ex
plain what has become of the $25,000,-
000 realized from the sale of new stock
last February.
Mr. Young has issued a formal state
ment of his position. He says he has
been asked whether, under the state
law, a domestic company can go on
indefinitely increasing its capital
stock, thereby increasing the burdens
of the public by reason of the divi
dends they must pay."
Thp Mr. Young admits there is some
conflict between certain sections of
the law on the subject, he believes
there is no doubt that, as the statutes
now stand, "no new stock can be is
sued by a domestic railroad company
without obtaining the consent of the
state thru the railroad commission."
Mr. Young continues:
This proposed issue would increase
the stock of the Great Northern com
pany to $210,000,000. With the bonds,
this would make the capitalization of
the 6,000 miles of road $425,000,000,
which exceeds $70,000 a mile for both
mam line and branches, where mueh of
the road, especially the branch lines,
cost not exceed $20 $$0 a mile.
The dividends oh this excess capi
talization is an unwarranted tax on the
patrons of the road, and instead of in
creasing its stock, which is now about
$60,000 a .mile, the company ought to
show some justification for its present
capitalization. Railroad regulation and
rate regulation would be but a farce if
our law should be so construed as to
permit a domestic railway company to
increase its capital stock at will to an
unlimited amount, especially as in this
case, for the alleged purpose of buy
ing the stock of other subsidiary com
panies composed of the same stock
holders, where the stock to be pur
chased was issued under other jurisdic
tions and sold at arbitrary prices to be
fixed by the buyer, who is also the
seller. If there is any vitality in our
law on the subject the proposed stock
will not be issued unless the necessity
therefor is shown and unless the eon
Sent of the proper officers of this state
is legally secured."
Great Northern was panicky in spec
ulative circles in Wall street' today and
sold down by big losses. Yesterday's
closing figure was 223%. Today the
stock fell to 220, then to 215, to 213
and as the market closed was down to
209. All'stocks were affected in sym
pathy, but none were off more than a
few points, while Great Northern lost
14Va points.
FREIGHT RATE GDT
BENEFITS CHICAGO
Milwaukee Announces 10 Per
Cent Reduction as Thrust
at Hill Lines.
Special to The Journal.
Chicago, Dec. 13.In response to the
urgent request of business men of this
city, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St.
Paul railway will make a reduction of
about 10 per cent in the freight rates
to all points in the northwest which are
affected by the recent cut in rates
made by the Hill roads.
The reduction, in rates made by the
Great Northern and Northern Pacific
roads upset the basis of rates which
has been in effect for many years, the
new rates giving Minneapolis, Duluth
and St. Paul undue advantage over
Chicago, the local men say. Appeals
to the Hill roads to restore the old
rates were unavailing. Then the mer
chants and manufacturers of this city
held conferences with traffic officials
of the lines competitive with the Hill
roads in the northwest.
It is possible that all the other roads
from here to the northwest, including
the Burlington, will follow the exam
ple of the Milwaukee in making reduc
tions in rates to benefit Chicago.

in
Fannie Sussman's character is to bej
attacked by the defense in the Suss
man murder trial, now in progress be-l
fore Judge Simpson. This was made!
plain today by the appearance on the!
witness stand of Charles NemorowskiJ
a dealer in shirtwaists with headquar
ters in St. Paul. His evidence was toI
the effect that the woman who was!
murdered at the Glenwood "hotel last!
September had been an inmate of no!
less than three houses of evil repute in|
St. Paul and had consorted under as
sumed names with persons of bad char
acter.
Other witnesses who will give similarJ
testimony were in the courtroom today.
One is a woman who goes by the name!
of "Effie." She will not only
testifci^rin as to the character of the houses
which Fannie Sussman is alleged W
have lived in St. Paul, but the defense
will maintain that she is the same worn-*
an who accompanied Fannie to thej
home of her parents on the evening of*
Sept. 11, just two weeks before the
tragedy at the Glenwood hotel.
The principal purpose of this-is
secure a witness to refute the te,-
mony of several members of the M^s*,
mger family relative to the terrible1
threat made by Henry Sussman to
Fannie after reading the gory head-",
lines over the newspaper account ofjk^
the Biggs murder case at the National^
hotel. Qf|
Several women from St. Paul were in?
the courtroom today.
County Attorney Smith went after^l
Charles Nemorowski of St. Paul, the
witness who attacked Fannie Suss
man's character.
Mr. Smith nex tried to establish the
witness7
relationts to one Brook who
was convicted of stealing brass. Nemo
rowski admitted that he was a witness
the case, later on he had worked for
Brooks and still later admitted that he
was a relative of Brooks. Nemorowski
was beginning to perspire rather freely i
when the court adjourned for the noon
luncheon.
He Carried a Revolver. 1
Hester Sussman, wife of Joseph L"
Sussman, a brother of Henry Sussman,
now on trial for his life, was called as
the first witness. She was dressed in
deep mourning.
She said that Henry lived at her
homes, I was his. constant habit-to
have a, revolver in his possession, inv'S
variably carrying it in his pocket. Mrs.
Sussman said that she knew Clara
Singer, whose name Henry Sussman
was accused of having forged to a
money order.
After the marriage of Henry Suss
man and Fannie Masinger, and the
former's departure, the young wife
came to live at the Sussman home.
While there Fannie received a letter
from Henry Sussman. ,*j
Fannie remained at the house ten*'!
or twelve days. About two days after -f
she left a letter came for her from
Henry. Witness sent for Fannie, who
came with her sister, .Rose.
Mrs. Sussman, the witness, identified^*
the letter as the same one testified "to
by Mr. and Mrs. Masinger and Rose
Masmger. This 'letter had a piece of -J
the top torn off. *sf
County Attorney Smith objected to
permitting the witness to testify as to
the contents of the letter, as she had
not read the letter herself and had
only heard it read hence witness had
no information as to its contents. faf
Judge Simpson sustained the obiec-^
tion of the state. ,M|
"Wat conversation did have^"s
Sh
regarding a
homyou
for hi
wife?" inquired Mr. McGhee.
**He asked me if I had any objection^
to Fannie staying at our house and if.
Joe and I would look after her. I said M.
that we would. This was the night be-Ill
fore he left." 3
On cross-examination by Mr. Smith,
the witness said that she had seen
Henry Sussman with a revolver on sev-^-l-
eral occasions, but could not remember
when the last time was.
!y'*'
VAi
Prisoner's Brother on Stand.
Joseph Sussman, a photographer,
brother of the prisoner and husband
oi the preceding witness, was next
called to the stand. He traced the
migrations of the Sussman family front-^r
Russia to Chicago, Iowa and Minne
apolis. He taught Henry photography
and employed him as his assistant and
solicitor.
Witness remembered that Henry wag
away about two weeks in March, 1905." II
Henry made his appearance one day at
the studio and said that he had married
Fannie Masinger. The next day Fan- '3
nie.appeared at the studio and that?'
evening Henry went to the Masinge*
homeland remained there three days^
Then Henry announced that he was go-'
ing away to join the army. Before go
ing, he asked that the witness and his
wife give Fannie a home. In accord
ance with this request Fannie was in
vited to live with the Joe Sussmans,
but remained only ten-or twelve days?
Witness was not allowed to tell why
Fannie left his house except to say
that it was of her own accord.
A-few days after Henry's departure
a letter for Fannie was received: at his
home, and about ten days later another
came. The latter was the letter testi
fied to by Mr. and' Mrs. Masinger and
their daughter Rose. It was a letter
from which a part of the top was torn.
Before he was allowed tb testify as'
to the contents, County Attorney Smith
asked: i
"At that time you had read the let-^
ter?" |J
"Well, yes, I had," said Joe Suss%
man.
"Who was the letter for?"
"For Fannie,"
"To who wis the letter ad-i
dressed,l?t-*VJm
a
:-ti
^,1 5
"To^Fannie." --J$k
**And yet you opened it and' readb
it!"
"The outside envelope was addressed\
to me." i
"Why didn't you'send the letter to
Fanne instead of sending for Fajanie'*
to come and get her letter
Objection was made to the question
ana' sustained by the eourt.
There was nothing threatening in this
letter which the witness said he had
