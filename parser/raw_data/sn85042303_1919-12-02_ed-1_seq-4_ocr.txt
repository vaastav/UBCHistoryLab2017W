As to the conimantK'erin"; of coal, somehow
it strikes us that Ardmore possibly mijfht let
the coal cars po right along southward, to i
supply those asless and woodless areas of the
pampas plains of Titanic .Texas, for instance,
where no other In el is available. Up here we
are surrounded by a considerable supply of
the raw material for fuel trees. Why not
take the axe to the tree and chop the tree up
into stovewood lengths and feed the lengths to
the wood-stove? If you are not reasonably
sure that the gas supply is going to hold out,
the purchase of a wood-burning, stove might
be a wi.e action. '

Unfortunately, President Wilson for this
once has found it necessary to break a prece
dent set up by himself. For the first time since j
he assumed the presidency he is unable to!
deliver in person his message to congress. The
country has become accustomed to having Mr.
Wilson tell his views to the joint session by I
word of mouth. This time his illness made
that impossible. l!ut no doubt the members of
each body under the gilded dome will masti
cate this message as thoroughly as thev have
masticated former Wilsonian utterances, for
surely it has the substantial meat this time.

TO, THAT AT AU'J
i in it
On the eve of adjourning the special session
of congress there was much haste in the house
of representatives to pass bills which had been
before that branch for five or six months,
though there was no prospect, even if there
had been the wish, to have them adopted by the
ih.,i i, .,.. o I,, tiw. n.iiu us senate. It was a trick to give the people the
itten 'goes to the kitchen at meal- j impression that the republican legislators are
ousy wnn me puniic n-cas.
The republican marlagers are said to fear
the introduction of the League of Nations as
an issue in the presidential campaign. They
may well fear. The voters can be expected to
The votes against the i remember for at least ten months.
WILL A WOMAN VOTE?
WILL A KITTKX drink pure rich cream?
It will. Also, a woman will vote. The
special election in Ardmore last .Saturday for
the voting of bonds to build a junior high high
chool and an additional ward school proved
most conclusively that in Ardmore, Carter
county. Oklahoma. U. S. A., at any rate, a
woman w
a hungry
time, and that she swallows the ballot with a
relish and an eagerness no less keen than those
with which the kitten laps the cream.
Forty per cent, approximately, of the vote
last Saturday was cast by women. And did the
women vote for the building bonds? They did.
The total vote was ll:
bond issue were only 18. The figures tell the
tale.
And a happy tale it is. The mothers of Ard
more intend that the children of Ardmore shall
have room and realm for mental expansion,
with physical security and comfort along with
the room and the realm.
Now, let us presume to forecast a bit. Will
the women vote in the next municipal election?
They will. If the next municipal election shall

tie a special one, tor a very special purpose, win . (0 jj-e
the women vote? They will.
Yes, messieurs, a woman will vote in Ard
more; and not only a woman, but a great num
ber of women.
The woman is the new element in local civic
affairs as in national politics. And you may
count upon the woman, as a general rule, to
vote right. She won the ballot by hard work,
tind because she deserved it, and she knows
just exactly what to do with it.
Woman now don't you fail to make good
and thus show us up as a phony forecaster! Il.it
we know you won't fail to make good.
Now comes Dr. Lewis, state health commis
sioner, with a ukase against the silk slocking
anil Ihe low neck for 1he working girl. Also,
Dr. Lewis takes a punch at the high heel. The
doctors seem to bo invading the domain of so-j
cioloL'v bv way of the nhvsioloev route. They
will do well if tlu-y prescribe sensible, sane,
safe and sanitary garb for all women.
