Mr. Carlisle's Speech on Assuming ; th
Speaker's Chair In the House -Kelley
Cox and Randall. Get Their Old Seati
by Courtesy.
Washington, Dec. 6. The Fiftieth con
gress was opened yesterday morning Ii
the presence of an immense throng of peo
pie. '
The galleries at both ends of the buildinf
were crowded with visitors long before noon.
Even the diplomatic gallery of the senate
'was fall to overflowing. , Mrs. Cleveland, ao
panied by her mother and several ladies, ar
rived early and took reserved seats in i thi
senate gallery. ;
Old Capt. Bassett has been the guardian ol
the dignity and secrecy of the senate ; f 01
fifty-six years, but he says that he nevei
saw such a display of flowers as that in tb
senate yesterday morning. Baskets of reset
nd designs of every conceivable shape wen
'Scattered about on the desks of senators, anc
but very few were forgotten. ' . j.
Ju3t as the ponderous hands of the senate
clock met at the hour of noon President la
galls stepped to the hair and his gavel, de
scended. The babel of voices and con f us 3d
noises ceased instantly, and every senatoi
rose to his feet. The senate of the Fiftieth
congress was. in session, and with bowed
heads the senators listened to prayer by the
chaplain, Rev. Dr. Butler. President Ingalls
thon arose and directed the clerk to read the
certificates of election, appointments and
other papers received by the president pro
tempore since the adjournment of the last
session. ' :
The following papers were submitted and
read: Certificate of the governor of Florida
making temporary appointment of J. J.
Finlay as senator, from .March 4, 1887, until
the legislature should fill the vacancy caused
by the expiration of the term of Senator
Jones; certificate of the governor of Florida
of the election by the legislature of Samuel
Pasco; certificate of the governcsf New
Jersey of the election of Bufus iflodgett;
certificate of the governor of West Virginia
of the appointment by him of Daniel B.
Lucas to fill the vacancy caused by the ex
piration of the term of Senator Camden;
certificate of the governor of West Virginia
of a summary of the proceedings' by which
the legislature, in special session, elected
Charles J. Faulkner as senator to fill the
vacancy; credentials of William E. Chand
ler as senator from the state of New Hamp
shire. The protest of Daniel B. Lucas against the
administration of the oath of office to Daniel
J. Faulkner was ordered printed in The
Record. The privileges of the floor were
given to Mr. Faulkner pending the decision
of the contest. Mr. Hoar presented a me
morial of B. Winter and others in respect to
the seat of Senator Turpie, of Indiana,
which was referred to th-j oommittee on
privileges and elections. Mr. Turpie was
sworn in, however, and Mr. Faulkner is the
only senator who is not as yet qualified to
vote upon any question coming before the
senate. It is probable that Mr. Faulkner
will take his seat before the holiday recess.
It was interesting to study the new and
old senators as they strolled into the cham
ber just before 12 o'clock. Each had already
chosen a seat, and went to it at once the
old senators with an air of easy indifference,
and the new ones with more stiffness and
dignity. The new senator from Indiana, Mr.
Turpie, attracted as much attention as any.
He came in early, and took a seat beside Mr.
Voorhees. Both had baskets of flowers sent
them. Voorhees handled his, inhaled their
fragrance, and seemed pleased when he saw
the name of the donor. Mr. Turpie studi
ously avoided - looking at his flowers at
all. He is a good looking man,
large, strongly built, with a well
shaped head. His sandy gray beard, which
covers all his face, is clipped short, ajjd he
has a good crop of hair of the same color.
Were he thinner and a few years older he
would look not unlike John Sherman. Faulk
ner, of West Virginia, a good looking, stal
wart young man, sat on the outer row of the
Democratic side, nervously toying with his
watch chain. Behind him, almost hidden in
a big armchair, was a little square built
man, with large mustache, thick iron-gray
hair, and serious face. He wore a light
overcoat, and carried a summer style derby
hat. This was Mr. Lucas, whom the gov
ernor of West Virginia appointed as senator,
but who will probably not be seated.
The new senator from Pennsylvania, M. S.
Quay, is a handsome man. He has curly
black hair, carefully kept mustache to
match, correct features, and & compact
body, weighing about 200 pounds. He wore
a Loyal league badge in his buttonhole yes
terday, and kept very quiet, only occasion
ally whispering a word to his neighbor, A.
S. Paddock, the successor of the peculiar
Van Wyck. Paddock looks very much as he
did when a senator before, the only change
being that he has cut short his iron gray hair.
Pasco, of Florida, the successor of Jones,
of Detroit, looks like a country preacher.
He sat waiting his turn to be sworn without
moving even his eyelids. He is a small man,
with a sallow complexion and jet black hair
and chin whiskers. He wore a suit of old
time shiny broadcloth, and looked very
solemn.
The biggest men physically who stood up
to ba sworn were Reagan and Coke,- of
Texaas, Hiscock, of New York, and the new
Mictiigan senator, Stockbridge. The latter
is large in every way, has a general Fal
staffian air, a huge gray beard, thick, bushy
hair of the same color, and when he laughs
he shakes all over.
When all the senators had been sworn in
Mr. Ingalls, the presiding officer, shook
hands gravely-with each, as though he had
never met them before. . .
The scenes in the house were a repetition
of those in the senate. There are four times
as many representatives as senators, and the
confusion, handshaking, noises, and flowers
were in a fourfold ratio. Dense crowds of
jostling people elbowed one another in the
corridors and on the stairways, and choked
up the doorways to all the galleries for an
. hour before the gavel fell. Within the hail
of the house the members who had not yet
been sworn in, and were not entitled to seats,
wandered about, new members in tow of old
ones undergoing the ordeal of introduction
. and handshaking, or strolling off into the
cloak room to join the smoking and laughing
groups. There were flowers every wh. e on
the desks of old members.
William W. Morrison is conspicuous by
his absence from this congress, but his place
Is filled by an able , old Republican named
Baker, whose first name is Jehu, and who is
a bad man to handle. He is a tall, large
framed man, with features much like those
of Andrew G. Curtin, of Pennsylvania, and
he wears a big, black stock altout his high
collar. - He looks quite the gentleman of the
old school, and he has a record. He has for
years been minister to Venezuela and other
. South American countries. He has been in
congress before, and he is as much , for pro
taction as Morrison was for free trade.
Holman. the great objector, took a seat at
near as be could get to the one .he held last
session. Holman does not change a bit from
year to year. He has the same rough, angu
lar face, the same rasping voice, and anothei
edition of the same suit of clothes witl
which he came to congress. He alwayi
wears a slouch hat and a black string neck
tie, and his suit is a business one.
After the roll call, to which 313 member!
answered to their names, the house proceeded
to elect a speaker. Hon. J. G. Carlisle wai
nominated by Mr. Cox (N. Y.), and Mr. Can
non (His.) nominated Mr. Thomas B. Reed,
of Maine.
Messrs. Randall, Mills, Long and McKinley
were selected as tally keepers by the cleric,
and the vote resulted as follows: Carlisle,
163; Reed, 148; Brumm, 2. The last twe
votes were cast by the Independent members,
Nicholls (N. C.) and Smith (Wis.) ,
Mr. Carlifte was then escorted to his desk
by Messrs. Cox and Reed amid hearty ap
plause. Mr. Kelly (Pa.) having administered
the oath, the speaker brought the house to
order with a tap of the gavel, and made a
brief speech. He thanked the gentlemen for
the honor they had conferred upon him, and
dwelt upon the apprehension be felt in assum
ing the duties of speaker for the third time.
He asked for their consideration and forbear
ance in his efforts to do his duty. Continuing,
he said: .-..----- -
"There ha3 scarcely ever been a time in our his
tory when the continued prosperity of our coun
try depended so largely upon legislation in con
gress as now, for the reason that the dangers
which at thisjjme thteatehth commercial anil
industrial Interests of the people are the direct
results of laws which congress alone can modify
of repeal.
It must be evident to every one who has taken
even a partial survey of public affairs that the
time has come when a revision of our revenue
laws and a reduction of taxation are absolutely
necessary in order to prevent a large and danger
ous accumulation of money in the treasury.
Whether this ought or ought not to have be.n
done before Is a question which it would be use
less now to discuss. It is sufficient for us to know
that the financial condition of be government
and the private business of the people alike de
mand the prompt consideration of the subjects,
and the speedy enactment of some substantial
measure of relief. Unfortunately, wo are men
aced by dangers from opposite directions. While
a policy of non-action must inevitably result
sooner or later in serious injury to the country,
we cannot be unmindful of the fact that haty
and inconsiderate legislation on subjects more
or less affecting large financial and industrial in
terests might produce, temporarily at least, dis
turbances and embarrassments which a more
prudent course would entirely avoid.
Investments made and labor employed in the
numerous and valuable industries which have
grown up under our present system of taxation
ought not to be rudely disturbed by sudden and
radical changes in the policy to which they have
adjusted themselves; but the just demand of an
overtaxed people and the obvious requirements
of -the financial situation cannot be entirely
ignored without seriously imperilling much
greater and more widely extended interests than
any, that could possibly be injuriously affected
by a moderate and a reasonable reduction of
duties. No part of our people are more imme
diately or .vitally interested in the continuance
of financial prosperity than those who labor for
wazes. Upon them and their families must
always fall the most disastrous consequences of
a monetary crisis, and they, too, are always the
last to realize the benefit of a return to pros
perous - times. Their wages are always the
first to fall when the crisis comes, and the last to
rise when it passes away. Our effort should be
to afford the necessary relief to all without in
jury to the interests of any, and therefore that
course of legislation should be pursued which
wi.l guarantee the laboring people of the country
against the paralyzing effects of a general and
prolonged financial depression, and atthe same
time not interfere with their steady employment
or deprive them of any part of the just reward
of their toil. If this can be done and I believe
it can, if our deliberations are conducted with the
wisdom and patriotism which the gravity of the
situation demands this congress will have cause
to congratulate itself on an achievement which
promises peace and prosperity to the country for
many years to come. .
These remarks may be considered somewhat
out of the usual course, and perhaps, not entirely
pertinent to the occasion, but I believe you will
excuse them, gentlemen, because they relate to
subjects which, as we assemble here to-day, are
uppermost in the minds of all the people. On the
correct solution of the questions which these sub
jects necessarily involve may depend the fate
not only of political parties, but what is far more
important, the permanent welfare of the greatest
and most enlightened constituencies in the world.
Again I thank you, gentlemen, for the conspic
uous and honorable place to which you have
assigned me.
The speaker was loudly applauded, and
the new members were summoned to his
desk in bodies of twelve and, having quali
fied, took the oath of office. ,
The house was thenvcalled by states, and
the oath of office administered. The Illinois
men occupied the floor by themslves, as did
the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio dele
gations. The other states were -sworn in
groups of four or five each. Michigan and
Minnesota were sworn together.
The process of electing, officers of the
house was much as' usual, Mr. Cox offering
the resolution embodying the names adopted
by the Democratic caucus, and Mr. Cannon
offering A" amendment to substitute the
names selected by the Republican caucus.
Brumm, who was elected as a Republican,
created some surprise by offering a resolu
tion to substitute a list of officers headed by
Robert Schilling, of Milwaukee, for clerk.
The amendments were voted down without
division and the Democratic officers elected.
They came forward and the oath of office
was administered. Donelson, the defeated
doorkeeper, was the first to take his suc
cessor, Mr. Hurt, by the hand and congrat
ulate him. - -
In the drawing of seats in the house the
first chosen was that occupied by Gen. Gar
field during his last term in the house. It
is fourth in the second aisle on the Repub
lican side, just behind that always reserved
for Judge Kelley, the father of the house.
It was chosen by Mj. Davis, of Massachu
setts, who was lucky enough to get the first
choice. The scenes were amusing, as is
usual at these biennial violations of the dis
trict gambling laws. For three days the
reading clerks have been busy counting and
arranging the little ivory marbles with
which this game of chance is played. Some
have been lost, and from some the numbers
have become defaced. Some were dupli
cates and some were blanks. When they
were all cleaned, counted and proved they
were put into the little mahogany box, from
which the little blindfolded page draws them
one by one.
Just at 3 o'clock the battle of the marbles
in the box awakened anxiety in the breasts
of the new members, who were anxious to
get as well placed on the start as possible.
All tho desks were obliged to be vacated, and
the members stood crowded together in a
semicircle back of the lobby. By unanimous
consent Judge Kelley and Mr. Cox were
permitted to retain their old seats. These
were the only ones so favored, but an inti
mation from some one sitting near was all
that was necessary to prevent Mr. Randall's
seat from being taken, though it was the
only desirable seat left on the Democratic
side before his name was called. Mr. Breck
enridge, of Arkansas, one of the most active
kickers against the "Randall tyranny" was
among those called early, and he started for
the Pennsylvania seat, but on learning
whoso it was he turned aside and took a back
seat.'''';' v -';.:' v.",.

THE RECENT DISAFFECTION AMONG
THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR.
An Interview with General. Secretary
IJtchman His Opinion of the Malcon
tents The Revolt Insignificant Large
Accessions to the Order. 1
Philadelphia, Dec. 6. General Master
Workman Powderly was not at the head
quarters of the Knights of Labor yesterday.
A reporter who searched for him to ask his
views on the circular issued by the "Pro
visional committee" of the malcontents of
the order, laid the matter before General
Secretary Litchman and Secretary of the
Executive Board Hayes. Mr. Litchman,
after reading the circular, talked freely on
the subject of its effect on the order and its
prospects. :
"There is no longer any necessity," said
he, "for a member of the Knights to keep
the fact of his membership iu the order a
secret. Nor is there any necessity for these
men who pretend to have great strength in
this city to keep their identity a secret. No
names are attached to this circular, and
the public is not ready Ufegcepb the un
qualified statement of persons who decline
to ' let their identity be known. If the
men who are at the head of this movement
were delegates to the "general assembly
they know that the general executive
board was in no way responsible for the
large expenditure of money last year. They
must know that the expenditure was made
by order of the general assembly itself. ' The
payment of over $300,000 for settling bad
strikes was ordered by the general assem
bly, and the general executive board was
not consulted in the matter at all. Not only
was the fund set apart for such purposes
thus expended, but $150,000 of the general
fund went in the same direction."
Mr. Litchman characterized the reports that
the order was goingto pieces as ridiculous
and untrue. "We are3 getting hundreds of
letters daily from all sections of the country
assuring us that the movement against the
administration is getting no foothold in other
districts. Chicago and Philadelphia are the
circles in which the movement is strongest,
and if the order was to go all to pieces
in thosa two places the Knights of
Labor would scarcely feel it. ... It is
but a drop in the bucket." He then
produced records up to July 1, showing that
on that date there were 500,982 members in
good standing in the order. . The number'
now he estimated at not less than 550,000, in
round figures. Since July 683 new local
assemblies have been organized, 11 lapsed
locals have bwa reorganized, and over 1,000
have been reinstated, they having been sus
pended for various causes.
In conclusion Secretary Litchman said:
"They say they will not pay the per capita
tax, and yet they declare the work against
us shall be done within the order. Jan. 1
the usual notice of taxes due will be sent to
every assemby in the order. As was done
last year, this will be accompanied by a
notice that unless the money is paid within
forty days the assembly will be suspended.
I give them ten days over the tima given by
the constitution. Therefore, if-tUey don't
pay up the war upon us w $11 have to be made
outside of the order, and it will not take the
members long to recognize this fact."

previous record. He secured 83 bull's-eyes.

Wabash, Ind., Dec. 6,-k-John Snyder, the
famous walking man of Blackford county,
died at his-home at Mill Grove Sunday night.
Snyder had been afflicted with a nervous
disease, which rendered it impossible for
him to remain quiet,, save when he slept.
For nearly four years he ate, and sometimes
6lept, while on his ceaseless tramp, and he
literally walked himself to death. It is said
that he walked 20,000 miles on his long tramp.
His case utterly baffled the physicians, who

THE KANSAS LIQUOR CASES BEFORE
THE SUPREME COURT.
Selling Intoxicating Uqaors is Jfot On
of the Inalienable Rights of an Ameri
can Citizen Society May Protect IUelf
from the Influences of the Bam Traffic.
Washington, Dec. 6. Justice Harlan de
livered the opinion of the court yesterday
in the two so called prohibition cases of
Joseph Mugler, plaintiff in error, vs. The
State of Kansas, and in the case of the State
of Kansas vs. Herman Ziebold and others,
affirming the judgment of the lower court In
the two Mugler caws and reversing the judg
ment in the Ziebold case. The effect of this
opinion is to declare valid the prohibition
laws of the state of Kansas, and is, of course,
a victory for the Prohibitionists.
The court said that the case came up under
the laws of Kansas declaring the main
tenance of a building for the manufacture
and sale of intoxicants a misdemeanor. It
was contended that this law was unconstitu
tional, because it abridged the rights of
citizens of property without due process of
law, the building used as a brewery being of
little value for any other purpose.. . . .
. Justice Harlan said . it had been held re
peatedly that the right of a state to regulate
the sale of liquor did not invade the consti
tutional rights of the citizen. It was con
tended, however, he said, that no state legis
lature had a right to prohibit any person
from manufacturing liquor for his own use
or for -export, for the reason that it was an
Invasion of the personal liberty inherent in
citizens. It must be observed, however, ha
said, that the right -to manufacture drink
for one's own use is subject to the restriction
that it shall not injuriously affect the pub
lic. The right to determine what was in
jurious had to exisu somewhere, an4-the
right of , determining what measures are
necessary for the preservation of the public
morals, health and safety bad, therefore,
been vested in the states by the constitutional
right given them under the police power to
regulate their own internal concerns. While
this police power could not be abused, and
must only be exercised for objects of real
merit, this court would certainly not say
that the liquor traffic was not one which the
3tate could lawfully prohibit, because it was
well known that the abuse of intoxicants was
productive of pauperism and crime. The
next ground of contention was that as
the breweries had been erected prior to
the passage of the prohibition law, and
as they were of little use except for
breweries, their property was taken with
out due process of law, in violation
of the constitution. ' But all property undur
our form of government, .he held, is subject
to the obligation that it shall not be used so
as to injuriously effect the rights of the
community, and thereby becorae a nuisance.
The state of Kansas had a right to prohibit
the liquor traffic. It did not thereby take
away the property of breweries; it simply
abated a nuisance. The property is not
taken away from its owners; they are only
prohibited from using it for a specific pur
pose, which the legislature declared to be
injurious to the community. '

Special to the Eraree Duocbat.
The Preeldeat's M
WAKHnraroir,Tec 6. Great excitement
at the Capitol to-day. Hardly ever before
has their been audi assemblage in the
House. It bad been generally understood
that the President's message would be con
fined solely to discussion and recommend- .
tion of the Tariff question; but still people
believed that other and more important
topics would be considered. . STJurpenee Is
not, however, at an end.- The message is
mainly indeed, entirely devoted to la
questions of Surplus and Tariff. The doc
ument favors a retention of the Internal
revenue tax, but urges amendment in
import duties.
As to tariff, the president asrs : The vi
cious inequitable and illogical source of
unnecessary taxation ought at once to be
revised and amended. Many important ar
ticles are produced in our own country and
duties now levied upon them are called
protections to these manufacturers. Those
who buy imported articles, pay duty into
the public treasury but a great majority
pay a sum approximately equal to this du
ty to the home manufacturer. This refer
ence to operation of tariff is made that the
treasury oe reminded of the manner in
which Durden is imposed on those who
consume imported article. He suggests
that duty on wool should be greatly reduc
ed or entirely removed ; and recommends
that iron ore, tin plate, salt, lumber vand
coal be put on the free list,but does not ad
vocate placing of copper ore on that list.
In conclusion he says': Our progress to
wards wise ' conclusion on these subjects
will not be improved by, dwelling upon
theories of protection and free -trade. It
is a condition not a theory which confronts
us. - The simple and plain duty which we
owe to the people is, to reduce taxation to
necessary expenses of operation of govern
ment and restore to the business of the
country the money which we hold in treas
ury through perversion of governmental
powers. .. ,
