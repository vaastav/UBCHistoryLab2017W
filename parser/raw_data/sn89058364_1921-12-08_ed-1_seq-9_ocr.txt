"What's the matter?" A sharp thrill
of pleasure went through her. Per
haps he had speculated, lost his money

Suggestions For Feeding Poultry.
Mrs. Kate M. Wells, poultry spec
ialist. Division of Extension, makes
the following suggestions for feeding
poultry for. egg production:
"The average hen will eat from
five to eight pounds of food per
month. She will, drink about six
pounds of milk Ter month. On lim
ited range she will eat two pounds of
grit and three pounds of oyster shell
a" year. This will vary with differ
ent hens, but it is a fair average.
Here is a simple and cheap ration:
"Scratch Fted Four hundred
pounds cracked corn.
"Dry Mash Hundred and fifty
pounds bran, 150 pounds shorts or
middlings, 50 pounds meat scraps, 4
pounds fine charcoal, 3 pounds fine
salt.
'Forty pounds of tankage may be
used in place of the meat scraps, or
40 pounds of meat scraps and 10
oounds of O. P. oil meal may take
the place of the 50 pounds meat
scraps. Feed so that hens will eat as
man? pounds of dry mash as of corn
scratch feed."

"Conditions are now ideal for build
ing a real livestock industry in Ten
nessee," say livestock specialists ,of
the Division of Extension, Univers
ity of Tennessee.
"Good purebred, registered dairy
cattle, beef cattle ' and hogs." say
Lthese specialists, "can now be bought
at prices in keepang with conditions
and with the market prices for dairy
products and meat animals."
To succeed at livestock raising we
must improve our old pastures and
prepare new ones. We must raise
more leguminous feeds. Proper crop
rotation with livestock will build up
the fertility of our exhausted soils
and will also help greatly in improv
ing farm labor conditions by better
distributing the farm work.
The Division of Extension desires
to aid farmers in starting right with
livestock, will send its livestock bul
letins on request and offers the ser
vices of its trained workers to farm
ers wishing advice and assistance in
feed productions care of animals and
the locating and selecting of animals
for breeding purposes, stockers or
feeders.
Old Bony Scrub.
Goodbye, old brindle, bony scrub,
The time demands a better breed.
You eat enough, but there's the rub,
You never pay for half your feed.
So, after all these years, we part,
But pray remember as you go,
If this should break' your bovine
heart.
You broke my purse long, long
ago.

Pots and Pans Are Household Prob

A weak soda solution will remove

may be polished with rotten stone
and sweet oil and dried with a soft

Kerosene will remove rust and

Senator Kenneth McKellar declared
that the statement of Senator Wat
son, or Indiana, early this .week to
the effect that the message of the
president to the next Congress prob
ably wilj suggest use of the money
owinc to the United States by the
allied govcrnments-as war debts for
the payment of cash bonjs to vet
erans of the world war. is not at all
new to the Democrats.
The Tennessee senator is just a
little peeved that the gentleman from
Indir.na should, Li effect, "steal his
thunder."
"The idea of paying our men a
bonus with the war debt originated
in the Democratic party," said the
senator. "I introduced a bill in the
Senate over a year ago providing for
payment of the bonus with this
money, or a part of it. Senator Wat
son and every other Republican in the
upper chamber voted against my bill.
One Democrat, Senator Watson, of
Georgia, voted with the Republican
majority.
"Again in April of this year, I
tried to get this proposition through
the Senate. This time I offered an
amendment to the tax bill, providing
for payment; of the bonus with the
monies received from the war debts
of our allies. Again the Republicans
voted us down.
"But now Jim Watson, of Indiana,
has recommended the plan to the
president, and the Republican party
is trying to leave the impression that
the idea is original with its mem
bers and especially Senator Watson'.
But the Democrats know better. They
know that Watson voted against my
first bill and later against the amend
ment to the tax bill.
"As I see it, the statement made
by Senator Watson, following his
conference with the president Mon
day, is but another 'wobble' of the
present 'wobbly' Republican adminis
tration. It is in line with the record
the party has made during the past
year."
Senator McKellar said he did not
know about Senator Watson's state
ment until it was called to his atten
tion bv a friend since the senator has
been in Memphis The Junior sena
tor left Memphis for Nashville and
wiil go from there to Washington.
