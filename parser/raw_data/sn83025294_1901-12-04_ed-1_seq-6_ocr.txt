GOSSIP ABOUT COPPER
A Boston dispatch to the Salt Lake
Tribune of the 2d instant states that
the Amalgamated people have just sold
100.000,000 pounds of copper to German
manufacturers at the market price. The
report is doubtless premature, because
if it were true every idle man in Butte
would be put to work in such mines as
the courts permit to be operated, and
every steam hoist in Butte would be in
active operation.
There has been no confirmation of a
reduction in the price of copper of 3
cents per pound, and*it is hoped on be
half of the prospectors, leasers and
smelter operators of Butte that prices
will remain where they are. They will
do so unless the holders of the surplus
are compelled to make a reduction on
account of the continued refusal of other
concerns to bear their proportion of the
loss involved in curtailment.
What seems to be well grounded in
formation from Boston today is to the
effect that the decline in Amalgamated
was not caused by any of the hostile in
fluences to which it was attributed, but
by the sale of Mrs. Daly's holdings on
account of that lady's desire to rid her
self of 'business cares which occupied so
much of her time and threatened the im
pairment of her health. It is stated that
her shares were sold without reference
!to market conditions, mine reserves, liti
gation, foreign business depression or
other consideration. The value of the
shares approximated $6,000,000 according
to the Boston report.
THE BAD LANDS DISTRICT.
As long ago as last spring one of the
most influential of Butte's secret so
cieties began an agitation for the re
moval of the fallen women of Butte
"from their present quarters to a more
remote locality. The business men of
•Butte lent prompt encouragement to the
project, but the city council did not take
favorable action, so the matter was tem
porarily held in abeyance. Within the
past few weeks, prominent ladies of
Butte connected with the reform asso
ciations have revived the discussion on
the public behalf. Yesterday a commit
tee of them called upon the Inter Moun
tain to solicit its aid in bringing the sub
ject before the people and their repre
sentatives in the city government. The
ladies were promptly informed that the
Inter Mountain had never entertained
but one view on the advisability of re
moval, and that it would again aid in
palling attention of the civil authorities
to the urgency of the issue. There is no
need of an argument in submitting t!he
proposition of removal to the aldermen.
There is only one side to such a question
and it must be patent to every good citi
zen. The removal should be ordered -'n
the interest of public morality and with
due regard to the rights of all parties.
After it shall be an accomplished fact,
the succeeding reform should be the
abolition of the monthly fine or tax of
to imposed on each unfortunate, or else
an order from the mayor directing that
such fines, when collected, be converted
Into the treasury. The present system
Is a compromise with vice and is a dis
grace to the city. If the fine is collected
from all women in the red light district,
the records of the city treasurer do not
Show adequate returns; if it is not col
lected from all, then there must be
favoritism displayed or laxity of official
duty, which are still worse. The fine
has had no repressive effect—it has
simply encouraged a system of official
protection to vice, and it has not in
creased the public revenues.
When the council shall remove the un
fortunate women, let it also abolish the
fax imposed upon them without result
ant benefit to the city.
FRIENDS OE IRRIGATION PLEASED.
The views announced by President
Ttocsevelt in his message upon the sub
ject of irrigation are of immense satis
faction to i'he West. Every good friend
of irrigation is pleased at the prospect
that is opened for the reclamation of the
Oi'id lands. Prom no quarter is a note
of discord sounded. George H. Maxwell,
executive chairman of the National Irri
gation association, who has done as
much as any man in the country to
arouse public interest in the plan for
Ibuiiding storage reservoirs in the West,
Is entirely pleased at what the president
Stas said to congress on the subject.
'"Phe president's message will electrify
the West, because it opens up such
gigantic possibilities for increasing pop
ulation and prosperity in that region."
■at 1 Mr. Maxwell, speaking of the na
tional policy outlined by the president.
"It will have the support of every think
ing man and the business men of the
country who have loyally supported the
aationa! irrigation movement will be
more than gratified that It 'has received
this indorsement. The president has an
swered every objection to the policy and
demonstrated that its inauguration would
benefit every section of the country and
every class of the American people. He
shows that it is one of the greatest ques
tions before the country today."
So throughout the country friends of
ttlie West and champions of Us industrial
welfare are encouraged to make greater
efforts in behalf of projects to benefit the
section of the country In which they
have an interest. The president is the
best friend the West has ever had in the
official circles of the country.
GOVERNOR TOOLE'S POSITION.
With entire respect to the governor and
attorney general of Montana, the Inter
Mountain would again call their atten
tion to the fact of the great railroad
merger proposition of James J. Hill, and
inquire what they are going to do about
it. Governor Toole said, in his answer to
the request of Governor Van Sant, that
there is law enough in this state to pro
tect its people from all harmful com
bines and trusts, and that if the
proposed merger contemplates the vio
lation of the statutes or involves dis
advantage to the state, its promoters will
be (held to a strict accountability. That
was the sense if not the language of the
governor's reply. His excellency inti
mated that he would look into the char
acter of the deal to determine whether
it was likely to be harmful to Montana
or not. That was a week ago. He has
not yet found out, for which reason,
perhaps, tihe attorney general has not
been heard from on the subject.
The Inter Mountain begs to submit
that if the state officials above named
intend to prevent the merger, or oppose
it, every consideration of fairness de
mands that proceedings be begun, at
once, or else that Mr. Hill be notified as
to the intention of the officials before
lie incurs the expense of consolidation or
gives his shareholders and the public as
surance of a successful deal. The gover
nor owes to to himself as well as the
railroad people, and to them no less than
to the thousands of citizens who elected
him to office to come to a definite conclu
sion as soon as possible, so that all par
ties may know what to expect. There
are two sides to the question. On behalf
of the merger, it is held that it will stop
rate cutting, eliminate rebates to large
shippers and give stability to transporta
tion and passenger charges. On the
other hand, there is danger of absolute
power -which may reduce the public ac
commodation, raise the rates and side
track entire communities. When his ex
cellency decides whether the merger will
be a detriment or a blessing, he may
declare his purpose. There are promi
nent politicians within the fusion ranks,
however, who contend that Governor
Toole has no alternative and that under
the pledges of the parties which elected
him to office, his duty on the merger
issue is imperative.
These are matters, however, which
Governor Toole will decide for himself.
The only suggestion of the Inter Moun
tain is that he declare his intentions as
soon as possible, first in order that the
railroads may not be deceived as to their
treatment In this state, and secondly, in
order that the governor's constituency
may know what to expect from their
chosen servants.
HE WILL LOOK OUT TOR WOOL
Concerning the little talk between
Senator Paris Gibson and a Washington
newspaper reporter, Montana residents
have made extended comment. The
question of a wool tariff came up in the
course of the interview and Montana's
junior senator sandwiched in between
statements favorable to free trade, a
declaration to the effect that a tariff on
wool suited residents of his home state
first-rate. Up and down the state since
the interview has been made public men
have asked what Senator Gibson's real
attitude toward wool was. Does he
favor the tariff which is so acceptable
to his neighbors at home, or is he at
Washington to represent only his own
views? This was the question brought
prominently up by the senator's Wash
ington talk.
There is but one way by which Sen
ator Gibson can indicate concern for the
-wool-growers of Montana, and that is' to
announce his abandonment of the demo
cratic fallacies of free trade and his con
version to the republican theory of pro
tection. No man who believes in free
wool can intelligently pretend to cham
pion the interests of the woolgrowers.
If he believes in a protective tariff on
wool and will agree always to uphold
such a tariff, he may consistently claim
to be a friend of the sheep interests of
Montana, but not otherwise. He occu
pies the anomalous position of a free
trade senator, pledged to protect an in
dustry which free trade would kill. He
is a democratic senator of a state whose
every industrial interest demands repub
lican statesmanship for its advancement.
He must, therefore, either cease to be a
free trader or no longer claim to be a
friend of the Montana woolgrower.
Notice has been given that the Weekly
Yellowstone Journal and the Stock
Growers' Journal will henceforth be pub
lished from the same office. This merger
leaves Col. Sam Gordon wiJh only the
Daily Journal with which to mould
public opinion In Miles City. It is under
stood that business reasons prompted
the community of interests plan, and
that separate and distinct organizations
will be maintained. Both papers are ex
cellent publications, t'he editors are gen
tlemen of sterling qualities, and the con
solidation of the weekly publications is
an example of journalistic amity beau
tiful to see.
TRADE IN THE PHILIPPINES.
--
The democratic organs in this country
which are carping at the policy of the
administration in the Philippines and
enjoying every embarrassment that to
Involved 1n the process of pacification
should experience a sense of shame as
they observe that even Germany volun
tarily confesses what the mugwump
faultfinders in our. own country insis-!
on denying regardless of t!he facts of
: history. A commercial bureau connected
with the German government has Just!
issued a circular on the subject Ger
man trade expansion, in which the fol
lowing statements are made:
Although the pacification of the! Phll-t
established, the accounts of its economic
development are so favorable that It can
not be too strongly urged upon German
exporters to give particular attention to
this group of islands. The testimony
cannot be withheld that the American
administration of affairs in the Philip
pines has, as far as economic betterment
of the country is concerned, already
aehieved extraordinary success. In 1S9!.
Ippine archipelago has not yet been funs'«
which was the last year of peaceful con
ditions under Spanish rule, the Philip
pines imports reached $28,500.000. Under
American riüe the imports increased in
1S99 to $40,900,000, and in 1900 to $55,500,
000 Mexican.
Praise from Sir Hubert is commenda
tion indeed. If Germany, a rival nation,
is forced to confess the triumphs of
American policy, surely the democratic
anti - expansionist mugwumps of the
United States should keep quiet, even
though they be not honest enough to
confess their error.
PRINTED BY THE BLIND.
The first number of a publication
called the Rocky Mountain Leader has
been issued from the state school for
the deaf and dumb at Boulder. The pub
lication is designed to teach printing to
the pupils of the school, to aid in their
literary work and act as a medium
through which the public can be informed
concerning the work done and the meth
ods employed at the institution. It will
be issued semi-monthly. The paper has a*
neat typographical appearance, is bright
ly written and contains much that is of
interest to the casual reader, as well as
to those interested In the work of teach
ing pupils who lack the sense of sight.
On Its merits the paper deserves success
and by reason of the circumstances un
der which It is^ published and its laud
able mission In the field of school jour
nals there is reason to believe that it will
receive excellent patronage.
Yesterday's edition of the Inter Moun
tain gave the Montana public the mes
sage of President Roosevelt a few hours
after its delivery in congress. The after
noon paper is sure to provide the best
possible news service during the session
of congress. Whatever of importance
takes place in Washington during'
sessions of the house and senate will
occur in time to be printed in afternoon
papers in Montana. The difference in
time between the capital and the Rocky
mountain region enables the evening
publication to be first in telling the im
portant happenings of the congressional
day. There will be no matter of public
concern which will not be chronicled in
the Inter Mountain the day it comes up
in congress.
It is estimated that by the year 1911
New York will equal London in popula
tion. The population of the English
metropolis is now 4,803,342. The Increase
in the past 10 years has been 370,122.
New York's population has increased
944,012 within the same period, bringing
the total up to 3,430,202. The percentage
of annual growth In New York is on
the increase while that of London 13
waning. Should no disappointing re

The Great Falls Tribune 'indulges in
gloomy forebodings concerning the con
struction of the isthmian canal. It is
the belief of the Tribune that the devel
opment of Cascade county iron mines
will be retarded by the proposed im
provement. The Great Falls paper urges
citizens to desist from jubilations over
the prospect of an isthmian waterway
until it can be determined just how far
the prospects of the Falls City will suffer
from the change. Really Ute Tribune
should have spoken sooner. The matter
has gone so far now that, it may not be
possible to call the deal off.
The receipts of the Yale football team
for the season were $75,000. In the game
with Harvard $35,000 were taken in, and
at the Princeton game $15,000 more were
secured. Reference to -interest figures
shows that an endowment of $1,875.000
would be required to contribute to Yale's
treasury a sum equal to that which the
football eleven brought home. It is pos
sible that the college of the future will
lean for financial support, mainly upon
the strong arms of their athletic and in
dustrious young men.

only a trifle in excess of what they were
for a corresponding period last year
and the condition of our gold supply is
entirely satisfactory.

EUGENIE BLAIR WELL RECEIVED.
"Camille" Greeted Witn Applause at
Sutton's New Theater.
Sutton's new theater was well filled
last evening when Eugenie Blair and her
company appeared In "Camille," Dumas'
noted drama. The audience was an ap
preciative one and the players were fre
quently encored. Miss Blair has sur
rounded herself with a capable com
pany, as was evidenced by the perform
ance last evening, and the performanco
of "Peg Woffington" tonight will In all
probability be well attended. "Camille"
was repeated at the matinee this after
noon.

Thought
If it's Painting, Paper-hang
ing or Decorating that's to be
done, have us do it. We have
been doing these things in a sat
isfactory manner so long that
-we would hardly care to change
our methods now. Then again
we charge only a reasonable
price and use only the best ma
terials.
