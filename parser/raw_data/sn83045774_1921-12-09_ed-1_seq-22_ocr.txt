FOR HUDSON BRIDGE
Favors One Privately Owned
as Part of Highway
Development.

Revenue Enough to Make
Plan Possible.
The Port of New York Authority
fttvors a Hudson River bridge, privately
owned, as part of a system of highway
development, but not in connection with
Its plan for the solution of the railroad
freight problem, according to a statement
by Chairman fiugenius H. Outerbridge
sent yesterday to the organizations
cooperating with the Port
Authority.
Referring to the plans prepared by the
Hudson River Bridge and Terminal Association,
Inc., for a bridge to cross the
Hudson in the neighborhood of Fiftyseventh
street. Mr. Outerbridgc said,
"No bridge structure has ever been designed
before of such magnificent proportions
as the proposed Hudson River
Bridge. Its accomplishment would be a
monument to the genius of Mr. Lindcntlial,
the celebrated bridge engineer, its
designer, and would furnish a convenience
to the public for which there seems
a popular appeal."
Grave objections were found, however,
to the inclusion of such a project in
the authority's comprehensive plan for
bi-State development of the port. These
objections Include:
1. The building of the bridge will depend
upon the provision of capital and
the procurement of revenue to make it
possible, which must come from sources
beyond the scope of and indeterminable
at this time by the Port Authority. To
have adopted it as part of the hl-State
plan and as a connecting link between
New Jersey and Manhattan fcr a;l of
the Jatter's freight service, would have
been, in effect, to count upon and recommend
a right of way on a structure designed
to be a private enterprise and
that right of way being dependent upon
the enterprise being carried to fruition.
2. The time estimated for tna construction
of the bridge was state.1 .(, be
five years of working days, or the cjuiv
alent of about seven years, making due
allowance for seasonal and other interruptions
to the work.
3. The freight terminal facilities suggested
for Manhattan established them
on elevated grades. The commission, as
stated In the preliminary report of the
chairman, unanimously determined they
should be under ground.
4. Any extension of these facilities in
the future to the lower East Side of
Manhattan would necessitate an elevated
railroad through Battery Park a id up
the East Side, and the commission believes
public opinion would be irrevocably
against such a structure, and that it
is improbable that such an extension
could support the expense of similar
terminal buildings on the Kast Side to
enclose and conceal an elevated structure.
Public opinion seems to have expressed
itself definitely against further
elevated structures on Manhattan. The
Mayor has recently expressed the opinion
of the city authorities that existing
elevated rapid transit structures should
be removed.
5. The only other possible extension
to the eastward would be by tunnel tm?i>T
and across Fifty-seventh street,
which would establish a different level
if connecting service to the easterly side
of Manhattan was ultimately required.
fi. Unless the terminal buildings on
the west side of Manhattan were built
for the entire distance, as planned, the
two levels of elevated tracks would not
he concealed and the railroads could not
he served with adequate platform and
storage space.
7 The enrnniete destruction of all ex
tstlng Improvements on the continuous
line of property from Forty-second street
to Cortlandt etreet necessitated by the
railroad and terminal buildings, as projected
In this plan, would Involve the
destruction of very large amounts of
Invested capital, which the Port AuthorInvested
capital, which the port authority
would desire to avoid, and whether
required condemnation or negotiation,
would unquestionably Involve costs
which cannot be predicated merely upon
assessed values or upon any definite determination
at this time.
8. When In the progress of time any
<omiplete and radical change is made In
the present methods of serving Manhattan
present appliances and facilities will
have become supplanted and have dlseppeared.
Therefore, to hasard New
York's sole dependence in the future for
the necessaries of life upon a bridge
which, either by an act of war or by a
miscreant, might be totally destroyed
by the placing or the dropping of a
bomh. seemed, a point that must not be
lightly disregarded.
0. Such a concentration of traffic at
one point as the bridge would Involve
has very obvious disadvantages to offset
the advantages that were urged for it.
Turning to the subject of highway
communication between the States, the
statement continues:
A policy has already been adopted by
them for the construction of vehicular
tunnels: construction work upon two
tunnels has already begun. It seems to
be generally believed that by the time
they are completed their capacity Is
Hkely to he at once absorneq. it I*
stated by the projector* of the Hudson
Ttiver RrldRe that Its capacity for vehlctilar
traftlc would equal that of many
tunnel* and that It* coat would be much
le*? than a sufficient number of tunnel?
to equal IU capacity.
Those question* ouRht to be possible
of determination by the proper authorities
and If found to be correct, the State*
might change their future policy and undertake
the. bulldlny of a brldRo a* a
public en'erprlse. The State* of New
Jersey and Pennsylvania have recently
irlven an example of this In the Joint
bulldlnR of the Delaware Ttiver Prldse
between Philadelphia and Camden.
Should New York and New Jersey dc
likewise a* to a Hudson River BrldRc.
the objection to dependlnR upon a rlRht
of way over a privately owned hltrhwav
for a public port plan mlRht disappear.
A Hudson River brldRe will appear on
the hlRhway map prepared by the authority,
Mr. OuterbrldRe stAted.

STEAMSHIP OWNERS'
FAVOR A SUBSIDY
I
Call It the Only Sure Means of
Meeting Foreign Competition.
TO ENFORCE JONES ACT
Section Providing for Abrogation
of Treaties Likely to
Re Approved.
The sub-committee on merchant marine
policy of the American Steamship
Owners Association is expected to have
j ready next week its recommendations
J for legislation necessary to the support
I and development of American shipping.
| It has not yet been decided whether
j these proposals will be published in ad|
vance of President Harding's soecial
| message on shipping questions, which he
j is said to be prepared to deliver early
in January.
The sdb-eommittee's report will ne
I based upon replies to a questionnaire sent
i to all the members of the association.
] Although nothing official has been given
out regarding the attitude of the members
it is known that practical unanimity
was shown on most of the e ssential
points in shipping policy. It already
is reasonably certain what form the
recommendations will take.
A direct subsidy will be favored as
) the only sure means of enabling AnieriI
can ships to meet foreign competition
where lower costs of operation and capi
ital charges are encountered. Proper
J safeguards will be advocated, however,
to prevent abuse of the Government's
bounty.
Enforcement of most of the provisions
of the Jones act also will be asked. Section
28, restricting preferential rail
rates to shipments destined for export in
American vessels, will probably be given
special approval. Out of deference to
the views of President Harding and Secretary
Hughes, section 34, providing for
the abrogation of commercial treaties
which prevent the application of preferential
duties, either will be ignored or
disapproved, although many of the shipowners
would like to have it enforced.
Approval will be given to the proposal
to extend the coastwise shipping laws to
the Philippines. This would have the
effect of barring foreign vessels from
the trade. It is pointed out that opposition
to the project has come mainly from
sugar planters who are themselves protected
by the emergency tariff actSHIP
OWNERS APPROVE
MARINE LIBRARY WORK
' Crews to Be Supplied With
Boxes of Books.
The purpose of the American Merchant
Marine Library Association in organizing
to continue the placing of useful
books on board American ships has been
unanimously approved by the executive
committee of the American Steamship
Owners Association, and the project has
been commended to the friendly aid and
support of the American public and the
shipownlng community.
During the war the American Library
Association was enabled to place 2-50,000
books on American merchant, ships.
J These books are made up In libraries that
j can be shifted from one ship to another.
The American Merchant Marine Library
I Association, with offices at 82 Beaver
i street. New York, has an organization
| which can do this work of distribution,
and has been promised the support of the
| Carnegie Foundation if adequate sub[
scriptlons are also forthcoming from
American shipowners and others interested.
The association has taken over the
marine work of the American Library
Association, and it is planned to supply
the crews of ships under the American
flag with boxes of reading matter, both
miscellaneous ond technical, with which
their otherwise unoccupied time may be
! usefully taken up.
