Speaker of Ibe Home.
We observe that Hon. S H. Buskirk.of Mon
roe county, is favorably spoken of for Speaker of
the Indiana House of Representatives. Fur this
position he is most eminently qualified, and his
choice to that place would reflect credit upon the
members of that body. But while we are ready
to acknowledge his excellent qualification for
the S' e ker's chair, we would not forget that
the claims of Northern Indiana deserve to be
remembered. It is a fact, that in the choice of
men for prominent positions in the Legislature
and other places, Northern Indiana is entirely
overlooked. We claim a fair share, not only in
the division ol the honorable places, but also of
the profitable and pay in? ones. In this Congres

December 13, 9 A. M
After occupying the river in front of the city
last night, we lot about 100 men in killed and
wounded while driving the rebels through the
city. They fired on our men as they advanced
through the streets, while secreted in and behind
houses. Not much mercy was shown to those
who were caught.
This morning :i dense fog hid everything from
view, but now it is practically cleared away.
The troops commenced moving at an euly
hour, Maj Gen. Sumn;r's grand division leatling
the way over in front of the city, to be followed
by M ij. Gen Hooker's grand division. General
Franklin's grand division, which crosses nearly
three miles below the city, is nearly over.
At squatter as 9 the first gun is tired. The
engagement lasted abetM half an hour, the tcte!s
not inaking it very spirited reply. It is thought
the troops will all be over at noon.
Information received during the night and this
morning from deserters uLd prisoners shows that
the rebels have two strong lines of batteries in
the rear of the city, the first one being one mile
back, and the second a mile from the first.
The whole army is in rnpid motion. Themen
are in excellent spirits and anxious to lie led on
the enemy's works. The enemy has concen
trated his foices mid it is believed will give bat
tie Much will depend on the result of today.
All feel sanguine of success.
T! o'clock, P. M This morning the fog
begau to clear away, but before 11 o'clock the
air was again thick, which continued until 2
o'clock, when it entirely disappeared. At o,uar
ter past two the rebels opened with nil their guns
posted on the first ridu'e of hills Their main
fire was directed upon the city, w;ich was filled
with our troops. Those guns which were posted
on the left of the ridge were opened on the large
body of troops which crossed on the lower bridges
mid had formed in liueof battle and were inoting
obliquely down the river.
Although several of their shells exploded over
our troops, none were injured. Gen. Bayard's
cavalry, which crossed on the lower bridge, had
five mtn killcJ while endeavoiiug to ascertain
the enemy's position. The troops which crossed
below are sleeping on their arms to night the
advance being within three quarters of a mile of
the Aiassapaina Creek, their left resting on the
Rapahanoik. The army occupies the opposite
tide of the creek in force. The guns posted on
the bank this side of the river silenced the ene
my 's alier an artillery dnell of half an hour.
This ended the firing for the day.
The only damage done by the rebel shelW
thrown into the city was to mid so much to its
lie-truction. Tentvheof our men were killed
last night on the streets while driving the it-hels
out. Nearly every houe in the city has been
damaged more or less by the tiling of the past
few days. Several splendid residences hcvebeen
completely riddled, as also all the churches. The
fiie seemed to be directed on the most prominent
of the edifices Several cases of wanton destruc
tion id probi ty occurred by our troops, where
they entered bouses which could have been of no
n-e to the enemy. In many houses the furniture
all remained.
Some of our troops mistook the British ling
for a secesh H ig and tore it from the residence
of the bVilish Consul. This morning the owner
cime awrer to recover it, and it was restored to
him.
The main body of the army is now over the
river, the lain nee being in a position to cross at
any time. There is no indication of the enemv
evacuating. If they remain a battle must im
mediately ensue.

M It is it-u ertained heyond doubt that the rebel
force is nearly 2011,000. Jackson coinin mils the
rebel right, extending from Gerris Station to
Front Royal. Lonpstreet has the center, extend
ing from üerris Station U the telegraph road,
Lee an. I Smart have the left.
The Herdd's BSMsWl. dated Headquarters, laut
night, Hfl Gen Franklin moved forward at sun
ri.-e, wiih his riyht re-ting on the river three
miles below. Skirmishing commenced on the
left about daylight, nnd soon altera rebel bat
terg opened on our lines The Ulli New Yor k
Militia was ordered lo charge, but. after a tierce
struggle, was comielled to retire.
The remainder of the brigade, under General
Tyler, then charged the enemy's guns, when the
fiht bei- nne geiici .l on the extreme left. Gen
erals Mead-' and Gibbons' division? encountered
the right of General O P. Hill's command The
connonading was terrific, though our troops suf
fered but little from the enemy 's artillery. Grad
ually the fiht extended nround the right. Gen.
Harris' divi-ion then went in and then Brooks'
division. About 10 o'clock General Sumner's
troops engaged the enemy back of the city, since
which the battle has raged furiously along the
whole lint'.
The enemy, occupying woods nnd hills, hud
much more advantageous positions, but were
driven back on their right a mile and a h ilf, early
in the day. About noon Gen Gibbons was re
lieved by Doubleday, and Gen. Mead by Stone
Wall Afterwards Gen. Newton's divi.Mon moved
to the support of the left, when the firing cease J
for a short time, and broke out with greater
fierceness in the center, where our troops were
exKiscd to a plungiii: fire from the enemy's
earthworks on the kHL Along the whole line
the battle has been fierce all day, with great loss
to b nh sides. To night each army holds its first
portion, except slight advance of our left.
Cannonading is still going on, end musketry
breaks out at intervals quite furiously.
Gen. Bayard was hit in the hip by a solid shot
while conversing with (Jen. Franklin.
Several hundred prisoners ere taken, who re
port Lie's hole army is in the vicinity. Hill's
troops started down the river this moruing, but
returned
Gen. Franklin to-night is opposed to Stonewall
Jackson.
It is impossible to form an accurate idea of the
loss on either fide. The city suffered terribly
from the enemy's artillery, and is crowded with
our troops, the front extending but a short dis
tance beyond.
The fight will probably be renewed to morrow.
A balloon has been up nil day. About dark our
forces carried the right crest of the hill occupied
by the rebels, driving them from the position
will great slaughter.
This evening the rebels have been shelling
Fredericksburg, endeavoring to drive our troops
out, but without success. Gen. Bunmide is in
the city, personally directing operations.
Adviie from the army sta'e that Gen. Mete
dith commands a divi.-ion, and Col. Cutter, of
Michigan, his late brigade.
Adjutant Dodd, reported killed, is uninjured.
DecEMBxa. 1411:00 A M There is no fog
to day. The sun is shining brightly with a
strong breeze.
At daylight this morning there was a heavy
fire of artillery nnd infantry in front of the first
line of works where Gens. Sumner and Hooker
were engaged yesterday. The lire slackened
about an hour afterward and was heard only at
intervals. Franklin's division is down the river.
The object of both parties was evidently to feel
the other during last night nnd this forenoon.
The rebels have considerably extended their
works and strengthened their position. Large
bodies of troops are now to be seen where but few
were to be found yesterday. Those killed yester
day while charging the enemy's works remain
where they fell. While attempting their re
moval, last night, the rebels opened fire with in
fantry, but the wounded have all been removed
from ihe field, and all the dead obtained are now
being buried.
The indications are that no battle will be fought
to-day, utile the enemy brings on the engage
ment, which they will not probably do.
From Fortress itlinroc.
Poetress Monroe, December 13 The Rich
mond Enquirer of the 12th has the following:
Heavy firing is going on at Fredericksburg.
Longstreei's troops are engaged. The cannon -a.
ling is severe. On Thursday last our bet t fries
stationed above and below the town opened fire
upon the gunboats anchored in the stream, con
sifting of the Freeborn. Anacosta, Live Yankee
and Resolute The firing lasted an hour and a
half, and was very heavy aud rapid. Eleven
houses were struck, and four, the best in tbe vil
lage, completely riddled.
Notice was given of an intention to shell.
The gunboats dropped down tbe river some
miles. The people of the town, like those of
Fredericksburg, are now scattered in the farm
houses and cabins of the adjacent country. Truly
the Yankees are waging a war of extermination.
Abraham Lincoln is a fit compeer of Nena Sahib.
Col Lucius M. Linen- will visit Europe, ac
companied by Col. C. C Lamar, of Miss., who
goes with instructions to Slidell and Mason.
Important movements are on foot in Eastern
North Carolina. Twelve regiments left New
b'irn on Saturday. Some think their destination
is Wilmington; the more general belief isthat
they design au attack ou Weldon and Peters
burg.
On Saturday two transports and five gunboats
ascended the Chowan river, and a land force of
10,000 was seen in motion for Suffolk, indicating
a movement on Weido.

A communication was nlsn received from the
President nn-wering a resolution of the Senate
calling for information and evidence relative lo
the Indian barbarities in Minnesota. Ordered to
be printed.
The resolution relative to the arbitrary arrests
of certain citizens of Delaware was taken up.
Mr. Morrill contended that the resolution, as it
now stood, was not a resolution of inquiry, but a
charge against the Government and an indictment
against the President, and he should vote for no
such resolution. He claimed that in this state of
war and rebellion, with the land full of traitors
and spies, the Commander-in-Chief has the right
to arrest such men.
No one, not even the Senator from Delaware,
(Saulsbury) has claimed that these men were
loval. That Senator (Powell) hid denounced
the Government from the beginning, the same as
his colleague, who followed the logical result of
his reasoning nnd went into the rebel army . but
not a single word does the Senator (Powell)
offer against the rebels, and rejoices over the re
cent elections, and says the lion hearted Democ
racy are rebuking this Administration. Well,
every rebel throughout rebeldum rejoices in the
same way. It is supposed there will be a peace
party at the North tli.it will force this Gover nment
into an inglorious peace, and that party encour
aged Jeff Davis and foreigu countries iu their
schemes of intervention.
There ought to be some proof that these men
were loyal.
Mr Morrill contended that there was no ground
ftircomplainr that merr were arrested on suspicion.
Men were ulways arrested upon suspicion of
crime.
Mr. Wright moved to amend the resolution so
as to in ike the call upon the President instead of
the Se tei arv nt War.
Mr. Wright said he knew no man who was per
mitred to live irr tire S luth win has any sympathy
with the North. He would love to see some of
the spirit shown by Stonewtll Jackson when he
found forty seven of his men skedaddling from
the battle He marched them in front of the
regiment and had ever v man of them shot. In
stead ot this, we have propositions for conven
tions, Ac. He woi.ld stand by the Government
and the President He would have the power of
the Government felt by every traitor North and
South.
Mr Bayard argued at length to show the affairs
ot the State of Delaware, and that true loyaltv
to the country did not imply loyalty to a single
individual.
Mr. Powell said the President had violated the
Constitution, arid he was reidv to prove it. He
did not believe this Union could ever be restored
by lorce of arm. He contended that President
Lincoln had violated the Constitution in enlarg
in the regular urniy, in the MMspflsMSM of the
writ of habeas corpus, in arresting citizens, iu
interleting with the freedom of the press, and in
bis recent proclamation.
Mr. Fessenden was willing to admit that potne
thing liaJ been rinne apparently without law; but
does any one doubt the p itriotUin of the Presi
dent? does any one pretend that he has not done
what he thought best to suppress this rebellion
and preserve the country, or that he has wilfully
violated the rights of any citir.en?

port a bill to establish a uniform system of bauk

Mr. Yeatmen offered the following, to be laid
over for future consideration:
Rr&olcfil by the House of Representatives, the
Senate concurring. That tbe proclamation ol' the
President, of the 22d of September, 1662, is not
warranted by the Constitution
Rrsolrtd. That notice of emancipation, as in
dicated in the proclamation as well calculated to
hasten the re-tor.rtion of peace, is not well chosen
as a measure, and is air assumption of power dan
gerous to the rights of citizens and the perpetuity
of a free Government.
Mr. Lovejov mo veil to lay the resolution on
the table Carried, by 94 against 45.
The House then went into Committee of the
Whole on the President s message.
Mr. Hurt bins spoke at lengrh, taking f)r n text
that freedom and slavery were incompatible be
yond hope of reconsideration or compromise.
Mr Menzies. replying, said he was in the habit
of regarding the enemies of the proclamation as
the friends of the Constitution. He understood
the gentleman Irom Ohio (Mr. Hutchin) to be
opposed to the Union as it was. No doubt the
reasons assigned by him for the recent defeat of
tha Republicans were satisfactory to the gentle
man himself, but he merely would tell them thai
the disasters to that parly were attributable to the
Abolition programme of the President and his
Party.
From "Sew York,
New Yobe, December 14 A special to the
Tribune from Nashville, dated 12th, says, Brig
adier General St mley returned this evening from
a darling enterprise into Dixie. He left our
front ye.-terdav by Franklin Pike, with a strong
force of cavalry, and disturbed the enemy early
in the day. fighting a considerable cavalry force
and driving them across the countiy. He made
a da?h at Franklin this morning, but was sharply
resisted by the enemy shooting from houses.
Major General Wytikoop, commanding the 7th
Pennsylvania cavalry, charged btilliantly through
the town and drove the rebels. After destroying
flouring mills and other property useful to the
rebel, the expedition returned, losing only one

were killed, ten wounded, twelve taken prisoners,
and a large lot of horses captured.
It was discovered that there is no large force of
rebels ns far west as Franklin.
There is a heavy force ol rebels near Nolans

There bas been an active demand for money,
but uone of that stringency which has prevailed
during the pork season in other years exists io
the market, and all acceptable paper offered has
been taken at 10 per cent ; but in some coses 12
per ceut. had to be paid. The week closed with
a slight falliui; off in the demand, however, aud
an easier market.
The minds of those who deal in money and
publ-c securities hae been a good deal agitated
by the President's message aud the reports of the
Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of
War, anil the price of gold and public securities
has fluctuated, to a considerable extent; and gold
closes higher. The truth is, matters do not look
so well either iu the field or the Cabinet. The
revelations made in the report of the Secretary of
W ir are discouraging in the extreme; for it it is
true that in Union there is strength, then the
converge of this expresses the poaiüon of the at
fairs of the nation. It seems to oe an admitted
tact that competition and jealousies, personal dis
likes nnd personrl malignity, hud culminated iu
positive mutiny on the part of some, if uol all the
leaders of the army in Virginia, and disobedience
of orders of superior officers had become the
rule, almost; and such conduct passed unnoticed,
in many places. A change has taken place, it is
true, but this change finds us in mid winter, when
a successful campaign seems extremely difficult,
if not impossible It is these things which are
making gold go up, aud producing agitation iu
financial matters in the leading markets.
Exchange on New York and the other Eastern
cities was a shade firmer at the close, and dealers
generally bought it nt L' discount and sold at par.

The weather has been cold and frosty, and as
favorable for pork packing as could have been
deaired. The receipts of hogs have been large,
but the demand has been fully equal to them, and
prices gradually improved the receipts now are
greater, up lo this dale, than iu any previous sen
son; but the impression is, that, owing to the
high price of corn, farmers uie hurrying their
lios to market, an J that the season will close
earlier than usual The fact that hogs are not
as well fatted as they might be, seems to corrob
orate this theory. It seems quite probable, how
ever, that the number of hogs which will be
packed here the present season will exceel the
number packed here last season, very conider
abiy. There caii lie no doubt (hat the number of
hogs in the country is large, and that the average
weight will be up to the usual average ot other
r easons, not making that of last season as the
standard
Yesterday (Tuesday) packers were well sup
plied. Generally speaking, they were cot in the
market, which gave it rather a quiet aspect; but
it was nonetheless farm, and prices were fully
maintained, the range being $4 25 to $4 t'5 for

A Shixplastkk Stort A shinplaster story
has been localized here and applied to a popular
dry goods dealer. The story may have been in
print, perhaps, but a repetition will do no harm
As the story goes, a farmer purchased a few
cents' worth of goods, from this trader, and gave
him a bill to mike change from. The latter re
turned him eigtty five cents in his engraved
promises to pay, genteelly known as checks, but
vulgarly as shiuplastets. What's them?" in
quired countryman, inspecting them with great
curiosity. "Öh," said the merchant, "those
are a sort of currency we dry goods dealers
have," and went off to attend to ano'her cus
tomer. The countryman went off. not exactly
satisfied, but soon alter returned and bought
nearly a dollar's worth of goods. After receiv
ing the neitly tied up package, and being told
the price, he depositeda number of pumpkin -seeds
on tbecouuter. "What are those?" inquired the
astonished merchant. "Oh," replied the country
man, coolly, "them's a sort of currency we farm
ers have," and thereupon left the store. The
story has it that the dry goods dealer, who appre
ciates good jokes was so amused that he am not
civil his unprofitable customer back. Boston
