TO CONGRESS.
The President Sends in His Regular
December Message-
Work and Recommendation Appertaining
to the Departments Necessity of Re.
trenchment Treasury Condi
tion and Tariff Changes.
Washta-gton, Dec 4. The president's
message to congTess was not so long as
expected. The Hawaiian matter was
not extensively referred to, advices
being awaited. The views of the presi
dent on foreign and domestic affairs
are as follows:
Message to the congress of the United States:
The constitutional duty which requires the
president from time to time to give to the con
gress information of the state of the union and
recommend to their consideration such meas
ures as he shall judge necessary and expedient,
is fittingly entered upon by commending to the
congress a careful examination of the detailed
statement and well supported recommenda
tions contained in the reports of the beads of
departments who are chiefly charged with the
executive work of the government. In an ef
fort to abridge this communication as much
as is consistent with its purpose, I shall
supplement a brief reference to the contents of
these departmental reports by the mention of
such executive business and incidents as are not
embraced th-re and by such recommendations
as appear to be at this particular time appro
priate. While our foreign relations have not at
all times during the past year been entirely
free from perplexity no embarrassing situation
remains that will not vield to the spirit of fair
ness and love of justice, which joined with con
sistent fairness characterizes a truly American
foreign policy.
Foreign Affair.
My predecessor having accepted the office
oj"hrbitraior of the long standing bound
a'ry disputes, tendered to tae president
by the Argentine republic and Brazil, it has
been icy agreeable duty to receive the special
envoys commissioned by those states to lay be
fore me evidence and arguments in behalf of
their respective governments. The outbreak
of domestic hostilities in the republic of
Brazil found th United States alert to watch
the interest of our citizens in thatcountr. with
which we carry on important commerce Sev
eral vessels of our new navy are now. and for
some time have been stationed at Rio de
Janeiro. The struggle being between the es
tabUshed government, which controls the
machinery of administration, and with
which we maintain friendly relations and
certain officers of the navv employing
the vessels of their command in an attack
upon the national capital and chief seaport,
and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided
administration. I have failed to see that the
insurgents can reasonably claim recognition as
bclllgerants. This far the position of our gov
ernment has been that of an attentive but an
impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict
In passing.our fixed policy of impartial neutral
ity in such a condition of affairs as now exists,
I deem it necessar.' to disallow in a
manner not to be misunderstood, the unau
thorized action of our late naval commander in
those waters in saluting the revolutionist Bra
zilian admiral, being Indisposed to countenance
an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction
to the local insurrections
The convention between our governmen t
and Chili, having for its object the
settlement and adju tment of the de
mands of the two count ies against each
other has been made effective b7 the organizi
tion of the claims commission provided for
The two governments failing to agree
upon the third member of th s commission
the good offices of the president of the Swiss
repub is were invoked as provided In the.
treaty, and the selection of the Swiss repre
sentative to this country was gratifying alike
to the United States and Chili and the vexa
tious question of so-called legation asylum for
offenders against the state and its laws was
presented anew in Chili by the unauthorized
action of the late United States minister in
receiving into his officii! residence two persons
who had ust failed in an attempt at
, revolution and against whom criminal
charge were pend ng, growing out of
a former abortive disturbance. and
the doctrine of asrlum as applied to this
case is not sanctioned b.- the best .precedents,
and, when a. lowed, ends to encourage sedition
and strife Under no circumstances cj.ii the
representative of this government be per
mitted under the ill-dettnca tlction of extra-territorial
juris iiction to attempt the administra
tion of criminal jast ce in the countries to
which they are accredited A temperate de
mand hivint been made bv the Chilian govern
ment for the correction of this conduct in the
instance mentioned, the minister wa-. instruct
ed no longer to harbor the offenders
The legislation of las t year known as the Geary
law, requiring the registration of all Chinese
laborers entitled to residence in the United
Sta.es and the deportation of all not comply
ing with the provisions of the act within the
time prescribed, met with much opposition
from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon
the ad ice of eminent counsel that the law was
unconstitutional, the great mass of the Chinese
laborers pendinc j idicial inquiry as to its va
lidltv, in goad faith declined to apply for the
certineates required by its provisions. A test i
case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was
brought before the supreme court and on May
13, lt9i a decision was made by that tribunal
sustaining the law.
It is bf lieved thit under the recent amend
ment of the act extending the time of registra
tion, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who j
uesire io reaiue in ims vouniry wm not avail
themselves of the renewed privilege thus af
forded of establishing by lawful procedure
their right to remain and that thereby the ne
cessltv of enforced deportation may be to a
great degree avoided
It is devolved upon the United States min
ister at Pekin as dean of the diplomatic body
and in the absence of a representative of
Sweden and Norway to press upon the Chinese
government reparation for the recent murder of
Swedish raissionaires at Tong, but this ques
tion is of vital interest to all countries whose
citizens engage in missionary work in the in
terior Our relations with the French republic con
tinue to be intimate and cordial. I sincerely
hope that the extra ition treaty with that
country, as amended by the senate, will scon be
operati e.
While occasional questions affecting our
naturalized citizens returning to the land
of their birth have arisen in our inter
course with Germany our relations with that
co ntry continue satisfactory.
The questions affectin? our relations with
Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of
inencimess. "sc otiations are m progress be
tween the two governments with a view to
such concurrent action as will make the award
and regulations agreed upon bv the Behring
sea tribu al of arbitration practically effective,
and it is not doubted that Great Britain will
co-operate freely with this country lor the ac
complishment of that purpose. The dispute
growing out of the discrimination tolls imnosed
In the Welland canal upon cargoes
of cereals bound to and from the
Jake ports of the United Stays, was adjusted
by the substitution of a more equitable sched
ule of charges and my predecessor thereupon
suspende his proclamation imposing . iscrimi
eating lolls upon British transit th ough our
canals. A q:estfor additions to the list of
extraditable offenses covered by the existing
treaty between the two countries is under con
sideration During the past year an American citi
zen employed in a subordinate commercial
position in Hay ti, after suffering a protractei
imprisonment on an unfounded charge of smug

the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the
111 conduct of its offic rs.
The extradition treaty with Russia signed in
March 1687 and amended and confirmed by the
senate In February last was duly proclaimed

It is hardly necessary for me to state that
the questions arising from our relati ns with
Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment.
Just prior to the installation of the pres
ent administration the existing govern
ment of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown
and a treaty of annexation bad been negotiated
between the provisional government the
island and the United States and submitted to
the senate for ratification. This treaty I with
drew for examination and dispatched Hon.
James A Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a
special commission to make an impartial in
vestigation of the circumstances attending the
change of government and of all the conditions
bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After
a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr.
Blount submit t-d to me his report
showing beyond all question that the
constitutional government of Hawaii had
been subverted with the active aid of
our representatives to that g vernment and
through the intimidation caused by the pres
ence of an armed naval force of the United
Seates which was landed for that purpose at
the instance of our minister. Upon the facts

The Treasury.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the government from all sources
during the fiscal year ended June 3J. IS33,
amounted to J46I 71&-Vl.9l and its expenditures
to 5159-74.S74 29. There was collected from

the vear amounting to $847.tf4. 191. a decrease
of 13i.612.934 from the preceding year. The
amount of gold exported was larger than any
previous year in the history of the government,
amounting to Jloaosi,3J4. and exceeding the
amount exported during the precellng year by
fV5.4S3.5i7. The bum paid from the treasury
for sugar bounty was ?, J73. 13 1 8i an increase
over the preceding year of S ".03 1,053 09.
It is estimated upon the basis of present
revenue laws that the receipts of the gove n
ment for the year ending June 3), 133J. will be
$43,121,363.0 and its expenditures $153 121,

mentioned, the per capita circulation was i49
On the same date there was in the treasury
gold bullion amounting to 33 5,637,. 73, and silver
bullion w hich was purchased at a cost of $126,-251.-M3.
The purchase of silver under the law of July

It is estimated that on the first day of July
1 91 the metallic stock of money in the United
States, consisting of coin and bullion amounted
to "l,-'lS..V.9,lt9 of which "-)S7.e97,63o was gold
and -6I5.S61.4S4 was silver.
One hundred and nineteen national banks
were orgmlzed during the year ending October
31, 1S31, with a capital of "11,230,'WJ, fort.--six
went into voluntary liquidation and 133 sus
pended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks
were insolvent, eighty-six resumed business,
and seven remain is the bands of bank x
atniners with prospects of speedy resumption
Of the new banks organized 44 wen; located
in the eastern states 41 west of the Mississippi
river and 31 in the central and southern states.
The tital number of banks in existence on the
Mstdayof October. 1:9', was 3.791, having an
aggregate capital of i693.55-.12J. The net in
crease in the circulation of these banks during
the year was i3.ts".S"2. The recent repeal of
the provision of law requiring the purchase of
ti.ver bullion by the Government as a feature
ot our monetary scheme has made an entire
change m the complexion of our currency af
fairs I do Lot doubt that the ul imate result
of this action will be most salutary and far
reaching.
In the nature of things, however, it is impos
sible to know at this time precisely what condi
tions will be brought about by the change, or'
what. If any, supplementary legislation may
in the light of such conditions, appear to be es
sential or expedi nt Of course, after the re
cent financial perturbation tim is necessary
for the re-establishment of business confidence.
When, however, through this restored confi
d-nce, the money which has been frightened
into hoarding laces is returned to trade and
enterprise, a surve of the situation will
probably dise'ese a safe path leading to
a perminentl? sound currency abundantly
sufficient to meet every requirement of cu in
creasing population an 1 business. In the pur
suit of this object we should resolutely turn
awav from alluring and temporar ex
pedients, determined to be contented with
nothing less than a lasting and com
prehensive financial plan. In these cir
cumstances I am convinced that a reasonable
delay in dealing with the su ject, instead of
being injurious, will increase the probability of
wise action.
I desire to earnestly suggest the wisdom ' f
amending the existinsr statutes iu r gard to
the issuance of government bonds.
The authority now vested in the secretary of
the trea-ury to issue bonds is not as clear as it
should be and the bonds authorized are disad
vantageous to the gov mm n both as to the
time of maturi and rate of interest.
The superintendent of immigration through
the secretary of the treasury report that dur

Department of Jastlce.
The report ot the attorney-general contains
the usual summary ot the affairs and proceed
ings of the department of Justice tor the past
year, together with certain recommendations
as to aeeded legislation on Tarious subjects. I
it toe heartUr indorse the propaaltion
that the fee system as applicable to the com
pensation of United States attorney, marshals,
clerks of federal courts and United States com
missioners should be abolished with as little
delay as possible. It is clearly in the interest
of the commnnit.- that the business of the
courts both civil and criminal, shall be as small
and as inexpensively conducted as the ends of
justice will allow.
The system is, therefore, thoroughly vicious
which makes the compensation of court offl-
cials depend upon the volume of such business
. and thus create a conflict between a proper ex-
ecution of the law and private gain, which can-

however, to more than 3,;o.',O.S). At the same

making a total or wj. ana ten cities and to-.vr.s
provided with free delivery on June 3. J-33,
ninety-ihre other cities and towns are now
entitled to this service under the law, but it
has not been accorded them on account of in
sufficient funds to meet the expense of its es
tablishment. I am decidedly of the opin-on
that the provisions f the present law permits
as general iatroduction of this feature of mail
service as is necessary and justifiable and that
it ought not to be extended to smaller com
munitios than ar now designated.
The expense of free delivery for the fiscal
year ending June 20, 1S91, will be more than
511, OJ.OoOand under the administration now
existing thre must be a constant increase in
the item of expenditures. There were C,4 1 ad
ditions to the domestic money order office?
during the last fiscal year, being the largest in-crea-e
in any year since the inauguration -l
the system. The total number of these ofllce
at the close of th vear was 13.531. There uer

The number of letters and packages mallec
during the year for special delivery was 3.373,

nearly 22 per cent The special delivery stamp
ustd upon these letters and packages amounted
to "337,559 20 and the mes3en:rers" fees paid fot
their delivery amounted to 1256,59 J.7I, leaving a
profit to the government of t 9 9."6 19. The rail
wav mail service not only adds to the prompt
ness of mail delivery at all offices, but it is the
especial instrumentality which puts thesmallei
and way places in the service on an equality in
that regard with the larger and terminal offices.
This branch of the postil service h & there
fore, received much attention from the postmaster-general,
and though it is gratifying to
know that it is in a condition of high efficiency
and great usefulness. I am led to agree with
the postmaster-general that there
is room for i
its further improvement. There are now con
nected with the post office establishment 2;.32l
employes who are in the classided service, and
the head of this great depart rent gives con
clusive evidence "of the value of civil service
reform when, after an experience that render?
his judgment absolutely reliable, he expresses
the opinion that without the benefit of this
system it would be impossible to conduct the
vast business Intrusted to him.
Tbe Interior Department.
The secretary of the interior has the super
vision of so many important subjects that his
reports are of special value and interest. On
the 30:h day of June, IS33, there were on the
pension rolls 9J5.012 names, an increase of 83.
91 over the number on the rolls June 3), 1591

in the Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of
6.30-,00 acres, notwithstanding the utmost care
in framing the regulations governing the selec

hibition, though, perhaps in a modified degree,
of the mad scramble, the violence and the
fraudulent occupation which hive accompanied
previous openings of public lands. I concur
with the secretary in the belief that these out
rageous incidents cannot be entirely prevented
without a change in the laws on the subject,
and I hope the reeommenditions in that direc

The work of the statistical division of the
department of agriculture deals with all that
relates to the economics of farming. The main
purpose of its monthly reports are to keep the
farmers informed as fully as possible of all
matters having any influence upon the world's
markets in which their products found
sale Its publications relate espe. ially
to the commercial side of farming.
It is therefore of profound importance and
vital concern to the farmers of the United
States who represent nearly one-ha f of our
Donalatioa, and also of direct interest to the
whole country, ihuthe work of this division)
be efficiently performed and that the informa- t
tion it has gathered be promptly diffused. It (
is a matter for congratulation to know that i
the secretary will not spire any effor to make,
this part of his work thoroughly useful
In the vear 1539 the congress appropriated
51.1C0 to be taken from the patent office funds
for the purpose of collecting and dis
tributing rare and improved variet es
of seeds and for prosecutinz agri
cultural investigations and procuring agri
cultural statisti-cs.and from this small beginning
the seed divt-lon of the department of agricult
ure has grown to its present unwieldy and un
justifiably extravarant proportions.
During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds
purchased ttas 5"6,543 61. The remainder of an
arp-opriation of Uo.i30 was expended in put
ting them up and d.stributing them. It sure y
never could have ente ed t e minds of
those who first sanctioned appropria
tions of public money for the pur
chase of new and improved varieties of
seeds for distribution that from this would
grow large appropriations for the purchase
and distribution by members of congress of or
dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings whi hare com
mon in all tha states and territories and every
where easily obtainable at low nr.ces In each
state and territory an agricultur il experiment
station has been established. These stations,
by their very character and name, are the
proper agencies to experiment with and ie-t
new varieties of seeds- and yet this indlscrim
inate and wasteful distribution by legislation
and legislators contlnues.answerinr no purpose
unless it be to remind constituents that their
representatives are willing to remember them
with gratuitous seeds at public cost.
Under the anction of exUtin? legislation
there was sent out from the agricultural de
partment during the last fiscal vear e-.ough of
cabbage seed to plant 19.".0 acres of land a
sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4.000 acres,
beet seed enough to plant 2.50" acres sweet
corn enough to plant 7.SJ3 acres, sufficient
cucumber seed to cover 2,023 acres w i h vines
and enough muskmelon and watemeloa seeds
to plant 2.C75 acres The total quantity or
flower and vegetable seeds thusdistributed was
contained m more than nine million packages
and they were sufficient if planted to cover
9 91 acres of land
In view of these facts this enormous expendi
ture without legitimate returns of benefit
ought to be abolished. Anticipat ng a com
munication so manifestly in the interest of
good legis'.ati n more than "100,0 a) has been
stricken from the estimate made to cover this
object for the year ending June 3.', 1S33. and
the secretary recommends that the remaining
"33.001 of estimate be confined strictly to tbi
purchas" of new and improved varieties of
seed and that these be distributed through ex
periment stations Thus the eed wilt be
tested and after the test has been comoleted
by the experiment station the propagation of
the useful varieties and the rcj-ction of the
valueless may safely be left to the common
sense of the people

The operation of wise laws and the influence
of civilization constantly tending to relieve the
country from the dangers of Indian hostilities,
tozether with the increasing '-ability of the
states through the efficiency of the nationil

that the time is fast approaching when there
should be a reorganization of our army on the
lines of the present necessities of the country.
This change contemplates neither Increase in

of the force and an encouragement of measures
tendin; to greater efficiency among the men

Is an immensely important advance in the use-

than ever convinced of the incalculable benefi's

its efftct upon the public service, but also hu
is even more important In its effect in elevating
the tone of political life generally.
The law embodyiasr civil rvice reform
found its way to our statute book more from
fear of the popular sentiment txUtlng In its fa
vor than from any love for the reform Itself on
the part oi legislators, ana it has lived and
grown and flourished in spite of the
covert as well as open hostility
of spoilsmen und notwithstanding the
que"ul0US impracticability of m ny self-coa-
stituted guardians. B neilh all the va aries

mon sense principle not only suited :to this
mundme sphere, but whose application our
people are more and more recognizing to be ab-
' sclu'cly p ssentiat to ihe inst successful opera
tions of their government. If not to lt.- per
petuity -
It seems tome to be entirely inconsistent
with the character of this reform as well as
ith its best enforcement, to oblige the com
mission to rely for clerical assistance upon
clerks detailed fro-n othe departments.
There ought not to be such a condition in any
department that clerks hired to do work there
can be spared to habitually work -at another
place, and it does not accord with a sensible
view r f civil servic reform that persons should
! be employed on the theory that their labor in
necessary in one depirtment when in point of
fact iheir services are devofd to entirely dif
ferent work in another department I earn
estly urge that the clerks ttecess ry to carry on
the work of the commission be regularly put
upon Its roster, and that the system of oblig
ing the commissioners to rel upon the services
of clerks belonging to other departments be
discontinued. ,
This oucht not to Increase the expense to the
government, while it would certain! , be more
consistent and adds greatly to the efficiency of
the commission. Economy In a public expend
iture is a duty that cannot innocently be ne
glected by tho-.e intrusted with the control of
money drawn from the popl for public uses.
I mut be confessed that our apparently end-
less resources the familiarity of our people
' with immense accumulations of wealth, tha
growing sentiment among them that the ex
penditure of public money should in some man

in which a larger pirt of odr taxe are exacted,
and a degenerated aene of official accountabil

After a hard strug-le. tariff reform Is di

our attention and nothing so clearly presents
itself as both an opportunity and a duty an
opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow-

oft repeated pro'esslons and by the emphatic

a measure has been prepared by the appropri

reform on the lines herein suggested, which
will be promptly submitted for legislative
action. It is the result of much patriotic and
unseltlsh work and I believe It deals with iti
subject consistently and as thoroughly as ex
isting conditions permit. I am satiitied that
the reduced tariff duties provide 1 for in the
proposed legislation, added to existing internal
revenue taxation will, in the near future,
though perhaps not immediately produce suf
ficient reenue to meet the needs of the gov
ernment. The committee, a ier full consideration and
to provide against a temporary deficiency
which mar exist before the business of the
country adjusts itself to the new taril sched
ules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few
additional internal revenue taxe3. including a
small tax upon incomes derived from certain
corporate investments. These new assess
ments are not only absolutely just and easily
borne, but they have the further merit of being
such as can be remitted without unfavorable
business disturbance whenever the necessity
of their imposition no longer exists.
la my great desire for the success of thi
measure I cannot restrain ihe suzgestion that
its success can only be attained by means oi
unselfish counsel of the part of the friends ol
