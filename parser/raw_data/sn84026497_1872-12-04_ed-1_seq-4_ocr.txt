An attempt was made on Sunday
evening last to fire the buildings of
the Titusville Manufacturing Co., iu
Titusville. The iuceudiary was ob
served, and chase given, hut was too
fleet for his pursuers. The fire had
just been started, and was easily put
out. The police have a description of
the individual, and will undoubtedly
bring him to time.
Messrs. Grove it Wolcott have
put up a rig on the Kepler farm, near
Kepler s well, and aro going to work
immediately to put down a well, and
get oil. Iheir last well, opposite
Trunkeyville, was recently tested and
proved of no account. They have in
this venture, as they have had in all
others, our virtuous hopes for a com
f lete success.
Brown, of tho Clarion Democrat,
recently called Young, of tho East
Brady Independent, "a land pirate,"
whereat Samuel waltzes off on his
largest ear, and calls Brown "a poor,
God-forsaken, whitewashed sucker,
who will not know his place, save
when his belters teach him what it is,
by giving him the most terrible whip
ping ever bestowed upon a candidate."
We wait patiently for the next Demo
crat to see what Young is now.
A man giving his uame as Ed
ward Wilson, was arrested the latter
part of last week, atTruukeyville, and
lodged in the jail at this place on a
charge of filching currency from C. S.
Richardson. Yesterday morning he
had a hearing before Eii. Mercilliott,
who bound him over in 8500 for his
appearance ut court. The requisite
bonds not being procurable by the
prisoner, he wus remanded to jail,
there to await tho action of the next
court. Judging by what wo heard of
the case, the prisoner stands a chance
of oqpiuting his err rs and learning a
profession in the Western Penitentiary.
. . . 1 1 , j i.-l hlovc the bridge, by
Win. Pollock. It was started up on
the hill just east of town, and run
down between Tate's office and the
school house, und through the vacant
lots north of Sloan A Van Giesen's
blacksmith shop, thence into the river,
where it came to grief. We are not
exactly prepared to say that it "bit
the dust j" but that it chewed up large
quanties of ice in its death struggles
is told for a fact.
A. C. Porter, formerly of tho
Independent Democrat, of this place,
was in town last week, and in reply
to our inquiries, informed us that the
paper he is to publish in Clarion will
shortly appear to tbe eyes of the
world. The reason for its non-appearance
before, is, that ho is making It
an 8-column paper instead of 6-col-
umn, as contemplated. Mr. Porter
will undoubtedly cause some shaking
among the dry bones of the old poli
ticians of Clarion county, and now,
that his paper is to be as largo as any
of them, he will have a fair chance.
On Sunday morning last the kitch
en and dining room of the Solders'
Orphan School, in Titusville, was de
stroyed by fire, and the remainder of
the buildings came near ehnring the
same fate. The building destroyed
was 100 feet long, by 20 wide, and
was valued at $1,000. The provisions,
furniture and cooking apparatus was
valued at $1,500, all of which is a to
tal loss. Gurdou S. Berry, principal
of the school, solicits aid from the
public to rebuild, and furnish the
building.
'.Ve learn from the Tidioute 7oir
nal that a Dr. Brownell, who is in the
employ of E. L. Jones of Tidioute,
was robbed near Babylon, on Thurs
day evening last, under tho following
circumstances. He was driving a light
wagon, and just outside the village he
was accosted by two men, who said.
give us a ride, Uncle." He told
them to jump in, which they did.
They remarked about tho roughness
of the roads, and for fear of falling
out passed their arms about the Dr.
One of them suddenly threw a horse
blanket over the Dr.'s head aud bent
him backward over tho seat. They
then robbed him of his pocket-book,
containing 8250 and a revolver.
Brownell yelled aud kicked while
they were going through his pockets,
but did not rouse anybody. They ran
off over the hill. The polico are on
the watch for the robbers.

HOW TO GO WEST.
This is an enquiry which every one
should have truthfully answered-before
he starts on hit) journey, and a little
care taken iu examination of Routes
will in many cases save much trouble,
time aiid money.
The "C. B. A Q. RR.," running from
Chicago, thiough Galesburg to Bur
lington, and tho "I. B. A W. Route,"
rii.,ning from Indianapolis, through
Bloomington to Burlington, have
achieved a splendid reputation in the
last two years us tho leading Passen
ger Routes to the West. At Burling
tou they connect with the B. A M. R.
R. and form the great Burlington
Routo, which runs direct through
Southern Iowa to Nebraska anil Kan
sas, with close connections to Califor
nia aud the Territories; and passen
gers starting from Tionesta, on their
way westward, cannot do better than
to take tho Burlington Route.
This Line has published a pamphlet
called "How to go West," which con
tains much valuable information ; a
large correct map of the Grcut West,
which can be obtained free of charge
by addressing the General Passenger
