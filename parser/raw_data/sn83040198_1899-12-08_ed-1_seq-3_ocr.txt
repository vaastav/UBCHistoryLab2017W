' Ad j earned Early.
Washington, Dec. 5. The opening of
the Fifty-sixth congress at noon yester
day attracted that widespread atten
tion which always attaches to the an
nual assembling- of the national law
makers. There was added interest in
the event this year, for the many far
reaching questions awaiting- consider
ation gave unusual importance to the
SPEAKER DAVID B. HENDERSON.
return of congress. Aside from this,
the Eoberts case introduced a phase
which promised something outside of
the ordinary developments of an open
ing day.
Early in the day, the throngs began
converging at the the capitol. The
day was bright and propitious and the
thoroughfares leading to the building
presented a gay and animated appear
ance. As early as 10:30 o'clock the
conspicuous figures of congress began
to arrive, and this served to give the
waiting throngs a temporary diversion.
Gen. Henderson went direct to the
speaker's private office, where he
shared his time with the house leaders
and with those pleading for admis
sion cards.
Representative Richardson, of Ten
nessee, the democratic house leader,
was also early on the scene, conferring
with his lieutenants. Shortly before
11 o'clock Mr. Roberts, of Utah, in silk
hat and black frock suit, made his way
through the crowd to the members'
private lobby. Here he chanced to
meet Mr. Richardson and the two held
a short conference as to whether Mr.
Roberts would seek to address the
house. A buzz of comment followed
the gentlemen from Utah wherever he.
went, but there was no disrespectful
demonstration.
Henderson, of Iowa; Richardson, of
Tennessee; John C. Bell, of Colorado,
and Francis G. Newlands, of Nevada,
were named for speaker. Morris, of
Minnesota; Overstreet, of Indiana, and
Carmack, of Tennessee, were appointed
tellers. Mr. Newlands, himself a can
didate, voted for Mr. Richardson. The
roll clerk said: "Henderson. 177; Rich
ardson, 15S; Bell, 4, and Newlands, 2."
The clerk thereupon announced the
election of Mr. Henderson amid great
republican applause. He designated
Mr. Richardson, Mr. Bell and Mr.
Newlands as a committee to escort the
speaker to the chair.
In accordance with the time-honored
custom, the oldest member of thf
house in point of service, Mr. Harmer.
of Pennsylvania, administered the oatr
to the speaker. The speaker then an
nounced that the oath would be ad
ministered to the members by states.
As the names of members were callec
they appeared at the bar in groups oJ
about a dozen and there, with raised
bands, were sworn .in by the speaker.
When the name of Brigham H. Rob
erts was reached in the house roll-call,
the Utah member-elect proceded alonf
to the arena in front of the speaker'
BRIO HAM H. ROBERTS.
(Whose Seat Is Being Contested)
4esk and awaited the administration
of the oath. At the same time Repre
sentative Taylor, of Ohio, secured rec
ognition aud amid breathless interest
protested against " the swearing-in of
Roberts, on the ground of his being a
polygamist and not a properly natur
alized American citizen. Mr. Taylor
spoke calmly and dispassionately. Mr.
Roberts stood gazing intently at him
- and not once -moved a muscle through
out the protest.
, Representative- McRae, of Arkansas,
followed with a protest from the dem
ocratic side, saying this issue was. one
involving the sacredness of the Amer
ican home, a sentiment that brought
an outburst of applause.
Speaker Henderson then addressed
Roberts, saying: "Will the gentleman
stand aside until the roll -call is com
pleted?" Mr. Eoberts assented with
'be statement-that in -so loing h
waived none of his rights. can as
sure the' gentleman," answered the
speaker, that he waives none of his
rights by this course."
It was agreed by unanimous consent
that the consideration of the resolu
tion should go over until to-morrow
after the reading of the president's
message. The swearing in of the re
maining members was then concluded.
The officers of the house. Clerk Mc
Dowell of Pennsylvania; Sergeant-at-Arms
Casen, of Wisconsin; Doorkeeper
Gleen, of New York, and Postmaster
McElroy, of Ohio, were elected.
The following is the text of Repre
sentative Taylor's resolution for the
appointment of a special ' committee to
investigate the Roberts case:
Whereas, It is charged that Brigham H. Rob
erts, a representative-elect to the Fifty-sixth
congress from the state of Utah, is ineligible
to a seat in the house of representatives, and
Whereas, Such a charge is made through a
a member of the house on his responsibility as
such tn ember, and on the basis, as he asserts,
of public records, affidavits and papers evidenc
ing such ineligibility.
Resolved, That the question of the prima
facie right of Brixham H. Roberts to be sworn
in as a representative be referred to a special
committee of nine members of the house to be
appointed by the speaker and until such com
mittee shall report upon the house and decide
such question and right, the said Brigham H.
Roberts shall not be sworn in or be- permitted
t occupy a seat in this house: and said com
mittee shall have power to send for persons and
papers and examine witnesses on oath in rela
tun to the subject matter of this.

The Senate Session Brief.
Washington, Dec 5. In the shadow
of the recent death, the senate convened
at noon yesterday in its first session
of the Fifty-sixth congress. The death
of Vice President Hobart cast a pall
over the preliminary proceedings at
the north end of the great marble capi
tol. As usual, on the opening day's
session of congress, the chamber was a
veritable conservatory. The odor of the
rarest and loveliest of blooming plants
were heavy on the air. Scarcely a sen
ator was forgotten in the lavish floral
display, and particularly notable was
the offering of flowers to the new mem
bers of the body. The desks to which
they had been assigned were loaded
with the choicest selections from the
public and private conservatories of
the city.
Promptly at 13 o'clock noon Mr,
Frye, of Maine, president pro tern..
called the senate to order. The bliny

Senator Quay be admitted as a senator
from Pennsylvania. This resolution

leges and elections. The senate, aftei
brief preliminaries, adjourned until

NO CANAL ACTION NOW.
Congressman Hepbarn, an Advocate of the
Nicaragua Proposition, Admit That the
Bill's Passage Will Be Prevented.
Washington, Dec 5. No action in
the matter of pledging of government
al aid for the construction of the Nica
raguan canal will be taken by congress
during the coming session. It is pro
posed by Representative Hepburn,
prospective chairman of the committee
on interstate and foreign commerce, to
introduce his bill for the construction
of the canal, but he admits that the
opponents of the measure, as" well as
the disinclination of certain members
favorable to the canal to await the
submission of the report of the Isth
mian canal commission, will prevent
its passage.

finding the Struggle at Modder
River a Hopeless One, Gen.Cron
je Evacuated His Position.
DESPERATE COURAGE ON BOTH SIDES,
rwlllght Pell Upon an Undecided BatUe,
aod the Boer, Porce of .11,000 'Retired
Without Any Disorder, Carrying OS
Their Gans and Equipments British
"Were Too Exhausted to Pursue Them.
London, Dec 5. The latest details
eceived from Modder river seem to
:how that even the desperate courage
.he attacking force displayed all day
ong (November 28) failed to drive the
Boers from their stong entrenchments,
ihd night fell on an undecided battle
But, apparently, during the course of
;he night Gen. Cronje, commanding
;he Boers, who are said to have num
bered 11,000 men, decided that the
itruggle was hopeless, for the British
found the town and surrounding posi
;ions evacuated when daylight broke.
tnd the whole British army crossed the
river and encamped on the Boer posi
tions. The experts here are unanimous in
sxpressing the opinion that Kimber
ley'a needs must be very pressing to
induce Gen. Methuen to expose the
whole of his command to the Boer
xiarksmen, snugly entrenched in a
Jemi-circular position. So deadly was
:he fire - zone that the Scotts guards
were compelled to leave their Maxim
runs behind when they were forced to
seek less exposed ground. It was only
after dark that a portion of the British
troops succeeded in crossing the river
by a mill dam on the extreme left.
When night fell the Boer artillery fire
tvas still as vigorous as in the morning,
but the Boers' retirement in the night
saved the , situation for the British.
The exhausted condition of the British
troops precluded the possibility of a
pursuit of the enemy.
The conclusion of the correspondents
that the Boers must have suffered
beavily must be confirmed from offi
cial sources before it is accepted as a
fact. In any case, the Boers retired
tvithout any sign of disorder, carrying
off their guns and equipment. Thus
Gen. Conie's force is still intact. The
fact that Gen. Methuen and CoL Keke-
wich are now-in communication may
cause a reconsideration of the Boer
commander's plan to give battle at
Spytfontein, where he might be simul
taneously attacked by both British
forces.
It is reported that Modder river
bridge has been repaired, and that the
British resumed their march towards
Kimberley to-day.
Has Methuen Entered Kimberley?
London, Dec 5. The Evening News
says it learns that a cable dispatch was
received to-day from an officer of the
guards saying simply: "In Kimber
ley," which, it is added, may mean that
Gen. Methuen's vanguard has entered
Kimberley.
Another Account of the Fight.
Cape Town, Nov. SO. (Delayed in
transmission). Some details of the
Modder river battle are at last at hand.
The battle was fousrht with the river
between armies. The Boers had five
miles of intrenchmentson the northern
bank. For several hours there was an
artillery duel, when there was a lull in
the Boer fire, and the British infantry
advanced to the river bank without
cover, hoping to force a passage over
to the Boer position.
The British were simply mowed
down in this and attempted and re
peated efforts to cross were frustrated
by the Boer guns. Finally a few of
the guards got across and held a posi
tion on the north bank despite heavy
odds. Some of the British tried to
swim the river, but were forced back
and nearly drowned. The Boers held
their position till darkness ended the
fight, when they retired unseen with
their guns to a new position to the
northward. A large "part of Gen. Me
thuen's force then crossed the river.

gold money in the country still stands
above the billion-dollar point and in

of the country was threatened by the
steady outward movement of gold.
The gold coin in circulation fell off $7,

in circulation. The total circulation
of the country stands at S1,9S5,030,964,
