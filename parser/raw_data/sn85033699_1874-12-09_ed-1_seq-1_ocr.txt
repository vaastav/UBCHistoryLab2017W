expect next a proposition that the Gov

sundry Erropean monarchies, or that
it go into the baker business, to furnish
the people with bread at cost.. The idle

day's date to the Chicago Tunes stated
that Representative Roderick Random
Butler, of Tennessee, would rise in his
seat m the House, on Monday, and de
mand a special committee to investi
gate the charges of corruption made
against him in connection with the
payment of what is known as the
Sueg Fort war claim. From our dis
patches it will be seen that Represen
tative Lawrence, of Ohio, got ahead of
Butler, and called for information on
the subject from the Departments.
The official term of Police Commis
sioner Partes expires to-morrow, when
the City Council will elect his succes
sor. It is all-important that the posi
tion should be filled by a first-class man.
Mr. Parkes has performed his duties
with such exceptional faithfulness and
efficiency that we cannot but look with
suspicion upon the desperate effort be
ing made to defeat him. Public senti
ment runs so strongly in favor of his
re-election, that we are confident the
City Council will recognize the wisdom
of letting well alone.
We heartily concur in the sugges
tion of the Shelbyvillc Commercial that
the .charges of fraud in connection with
the administration of the State gov
ernment, which were so freely made
throughout the recent canvass, should
be rigidly investigated by the Legisla
ture. If these charges emanating
originally, we believe, from Radical
sources, and never yet stated in a spe
cific shape can be proven, none 6hall
be more emphatic than we
in demanding the punishment of
the unfaithful stewards; but if
honest and efficient public servants
have been made to suffer in reputation
by the circulation of such reports, let
their vindication by the Legislature be
prompt, unequivocal and complete.
The people will be satisfied with no half
way action; they were never in less
humor for whitewashing.
While touching upon this matter we
may mention that our Shelbyville con
temporary is in error with regard to
the libel suit, to which it refers as hav
ing been instituted by the Comptroller
"with a great flourish of virtuous indig
nation," and then, "very mysteriously
hushed up." The case is still pending
in the Davidson County Circuit Court.

Arkansas . Affairs.
The Senate Republican caucus continued
in session several hours this afternoon,
Arkansas and Louisiana affairs were only
mciaentaiiy reierrea to, it beinc evident
that a formal discussion would show wide
and irreconcilable difference of opinion.
In tne-Arkansas case, the friends of
Smith have beeu seeking Congressional
action, ana tuose oi uarland ope
rating against it. Several prominent
Senators say that if the Senate attempts to
intermeddle witn the anairs of Arkansas,
they will become as much confused as the
parties to the Gubernatorial controversy
are themselves, in that State. Besides,
thev do not see how Congressional action
could benefit a State already peaceful, and
they fail to perceive any reason for inter
fering in Arkansas, when the scandalous
condition of Louisiana has failed to secure
Congressional action.

X llnrrj About the CItII Rlg-bts Bill.
Special to the Chicago Times.
A good deal has been said of the inten
tion or the Republicans leaders in the
House to take up at once and press to a
vote the Senate Civil Rights bill, now on
the Speakers table, and send it to the
President; but inquiry shows that nothing
of the kind is intended. Gen. Butler en
tered, at the last session, a mo. ion to re
commit the bill to the judiciary Commit
tee, and it is his intention to have it take
that course, with a view of amending it
and sending it back to the Senate.
T he Enforcement Art Unconstitutional
The full opinion of Justice Bradley, of
the United States Supreme Court, deciding
in the Louisiana case, that the Enforce
ment act is unconstitutional, has been
made public here, and is so very strong
from such a source as to leave no doubt in
the minds of good lawyers of both parties
that the full bench will confirm it in
March. This will relieve the opposition
of the necessity of introducing a bill for
the repeal of the law. Justice Bradley is
a Republican, and is the last appointment
to the Supreme Bench made by GraDt.
Butler and DnrelL.
It Las transpired that for two weeks past
a strong pressure has been made on Geu.
Butler, as Cliairman of the House Judicia
ry Committee, to induce him to change
front on the proposed impeachment of Judge
DurelL The latter's friends have besieged
him in all ways to invoke his vote in the
committee, and thus change the result; but
he steadily refused, and even informed
tlwm that he should report the resolution
for Durell's impeachment at the earliest
practicable moment. In view of this state
ot affairs, Dwell was advised at once to re
sign, which he did promptly. But'er, it is
said, believes Durell to have been a very
unrighteous judge.
Republican Demoralisation.
Special to the Cincinnati Enquirer.
It is predicted by one well informed
member that the Committee on Barking
anl Currency will not endorse the policy
of the message. Such prominent Republi
cans as Butler and ielley will probably
make open war upon it. For the first time
since the Republican party came into
power, there are visible and decisive
breaches or discipline revealing them
selves on the floor of the lower
house of Congress. The President's
message is to them a bombshell. It makes
a square issue; intact, a series or square
issues, which the managers do not pretend
to deny that tliey w ill find themselves
powerless to m"et. The first gun was fired
to-day by Hg-iren Kelley, who says broad
ly that lie will oppose certain measures or
the admihist ration, no ma ter w hat politi
cal associations it may lead him to form.
Undoubtedly a good deal of demoraliza
tion was expected in the Republicans, but
the meeting of Congress sliows this in
peculiar forms. The leaders seem to have
lost their discretion with tne pros ect or a
loss of power.

Kelley's Convertibles.
The House then went into Committee of
Wliole on tbe general calendar, and after
laying aside several bihs without action,
took up one of which Kelley is the author,
for the exchange of greenbacks into o.rj j
convertible bonds. Keller proceeded to
address the House in support of the bill.
He said that it proposed, tliat when any
individual had any money lying idle, fr
which lie had no present use, he might
lend it to the government at the rate of 3.05
per cent., recalling it as ne might do rrom
a savings bank when the time came for the
use of the money. He claimed that the
government would thus get about $ 0J,00(),
000 at that low rate of interest with which
to redeem the gold-hearing bonds now held
abroad; that it would releive the govern
ment of its foreign debt; that it would give
increased value to greenbacKs, diminish the
demand for gold, and thereby remove the
disparity between them and gold, it
would quicken every industry and restore
confidence to the people.
Ben Sutler's Views.
After respeaking twenty-five minutes,
Mr. Kelly yielded to Mr. Butler, of Massa
chusetts, who advocated the bill, aud
claimed that it was in accord with the pos
ition which be had held on the subject for
many years. If a person wanted money as
a business loan, he could iot borrow it on
commercial paper at less than seven, eight,
nine, or ten per cenU, and why? Because it
was understood that Congress and the Ex
ecutive were determined to contract the
currency until specie paymeut was reached.
But specie payment there never had beeu
and never would be. It was always a de
lusion. But specie values they would
come to. He wanted the Government to
come into the market as a borrower at a
low rate of interest. Then the next range
would be nearer to it, and so on until all
rates of interest came down.
lintler Preaches tbe Fnneral of Radl.
eallsna, and Dig at tbe Democ
racy. Tbe Rebublican party s held responsible
for tbe distress that has been brought upon
the country, to have become tbe party of
invested capital, a party or bondholder
and monopolists. The Republican party
attracted the true men of tbe country when
it started, because it started by bringing
up lalwr. It commenced at the low.'st
stratum, the slave, and raised him to citi
zenship. But war and the necessities of
the government brought to tbe party the
capitalists of the country, and at last, when
the war was over we had a party, at tbe
head of which were the capitalists, and at
the foot the negroes, with not much ffialia-
tion between them.
laughter on the part ;.f the Democrats.
There is no occasion for your laughter, as
the Democratic party is in very much the
same condition. the old Vthig party
leaders are the capitalists of that party,
who would not come into the Republican
party because they would not go for bring
ing up the laboring men. Finding no
where else to go they went over, and be
came the leaders in the Democratic party;
and so that is a party now with old Whig
bondholders for its head and Irish for its
tail, laughter, and there is very little
affiliation between the bead and tail, either.
We have got into this abnormal condi
tion of things, and the Republican party
has got,
For tbe Last Time,
the opportunity to relieve the country from
its distress, to recover its confidence and to
show that the people are the objects of its
care. If w e fail now, we will forever, be
cause a party once inaugurated lasts for a
generation, and that is to all of us here for
ever. At the close of Mr. Butler's speech, Mr.
Kelly offered a substitute for the second
section of the bill, providing that the Sec
retary of the Treasury shall invest 75 per
cent, of United States notes received in
exchange of such convertible bonds in tbe
purchase or redemption of any bonds out
standing at the time of tbe passage of tbe
act, or in the purchase of gold with which
to redeem such bonds. . "
"Tfeasnreleos Disaster.
Mr. Garfield said: I believe this bill is
fraught with measureless evils to every
great and good interest of the people of
these United States; not to tbe Govern
ment alone, but to the capitalist, and above
all, to tbe laboring interests. For tbe lat
ten years I have given as much of my time,
with what ability I could, lo the.studyof
this question as o any other before the
American people, and I believe it Is clearly
demonstrated that were we now to enter
on fie path pointed out In this bill, and
advocated by the gentlemen who have ad-
aressed the House, that path would lead us
by a quick and rapid grade downward to
the most measure .ess disaster which has
ever befallen tlie business and prosperity of
uie American people.
Garfield Impales Bntler on IIU O
1ttgte.
The gentleman from Massachusetts (But
ter) says truly that a man can borrow mil
lions ou millions in New York to-day if
he wants to borrow it on calL bnt that if
be offer commercial paper and desire the
money lor six, or eight, or ten, or twelve
months, be cant get It except at a large
rate of interest, and then the gentleman
gave a reason, which to me u the most
amazing reason that could be given. The
reason why money cannot be so borrowed,
ne says, is that the men who nave money
are afraid that Congress will resume specie
payment, or that Congress and the Presi
dent will do it.
Mr. Butler No, I did not ay that. I
said they feared that Congress was coins
oawith the contraction of currency. I
said yon never could resurua.
Mr. Garaeld I other words. caDitaiista
who have money in their hands will not
lend it for nine or ten months ahead, for
rear the legislation of Congress will make
that money better at the time it is naid
back to them. Now, whoever heard a
reason like that given for anything in the
worm.- i can understand that nreciselv
tne revel se is tne reason or the monev-
lenuer. tie aeennes to put his money
out of his - bauds for a number
of mouths, and this tends to
depreciate the value of his money and to
provide that it shall come back into his
hands worth far less than when it left him.
The gentleman says that, in his State and
ail the States, the business of tbe country
siumoers on volcanoes, because, for exam
ple, the $200,000,000 in the Savings banks
of Massachusetts are invested there on call,
and he says that, should even tbe servant
girls of that State at once make a demand
ror their deposits, the business of the State
would co. lapse. JSow, u I understand the
nature and effect of this bill, it is to put the
entire finances of the United States in just
siicn a position as mat in which the gen
tieman pictures tne anatrs or his own
State. To say that all the great obit
tiona which this government owes shall be
obligations on call; to say that there may
be a rush, not or servant girls alone, bnt of
all the speculations in the land, to demand
either more greenbacks lor bonds delivered.
or more bonds for greenbacks delivered; of
course all the great volumes or money which
-ew lork capitalists hold to-day and
are willing to lend at two per cent, on call,
as the gentlemen says, would be lent to
the government at 3.63 during the times
when it was not required for more profita
ble uses.
Mr. Kelley Would the Government be
injured by receiving, at 3.6o, paper interest.
and redeeming 6 per cent, gold bonds with
It?
Mr. Garfield With the prospect of beine
called on next week to use more than what
they got for it in redeeming it when it
was presented to tiiem to get currency
again, ibis is a proposition to the effect
tliat if there be a lull in business in the
United States so that a few millions or a
hundred million may be lying idle at any
time, the Treasury of the United States
shall take that and give tlie capitalist in-
teiest oa it; but the moment that capita
list finds a more profitable use for his
nio'iey iu speculation, he comes to the
l reasury and says : O-ive me my money
u rt; I havej jot needed it while you have
had it, and you have paid me interest upon
it, but now that I can speculate with it at a
higher rate; give it back to me."
Mr. Kelley Why do not owners of the
sixty millions which lie dead in your
treasury draw theni out? Tbey stand
there a perpetual refutation of that argu
ment. Mr. Garfield If the Government pursues
a policy which demoralizes gold and makes
it a mere commodity, I do not wonder that
men who have gold are willing to let the
Treasury keep it for them; but let gold be
made monev, the money of the Constitu
tion, and they will soon withdraw it.
Mr. Kelley It is not sixty millions of
gold, but of greenbacks.
Mr. Garfield In our financial aflairs, if
there was ever a time when American
statesmanship needed courage and self-denial,
that self-denial that shall reduce
expenditures and expansion, and re
sist all schemes that would help to
keep us from solid values, honest indus
tries and honest results, that tinis is now.
I trust that we shall not mistake effects for
causes. I am amazed at gentlemen who
say thit the cause of our disaster is a lack
of currency, and that more currency is the
remedy. On the contrary, it is clear to me
that one of the prime causes of our disaster
has been our unsettled, unsteady, fluctu
ating values, and that the remedy for it all
is to reach solid ground.
Mr. Dawes, Chairman of the Committee
on Ways and Means, remarked that upon
his motion tlie House had gone into com
mittee, not for tlie purpose of precipitating
this debate upon the country, but for the
purpose or addressing itseir to current
business; "yet," said he, "I do not know
that I regret that we have come at once
upon the object which rises above all
others in importance and presses itself
more than any other for solution. Upon
consideration, I shall myself, as far as I
can, endeavor to urge upon the House the
consideration ot this question, until it an
nounces to tbe conntry some settled policy
upon it; and I desire, therefore, to ask the
committee to rise now and to permit us to
morrow, if it be convenient, to renew this
debate, not simply for tbe purpose of in
dulging in debate in general platitudes or
enudaiions of principles, but for tbe pur
pose of applying ourselves to the solution
of this whole question.
"The Government of the United States
has $;S2,0OO,OO0 of its promises afloat in
the land. The difficulties that beset labor
and capital arise solely from depreciation
of this $332,000,000 of promises. They
are mere promises of the government; they
are relow par. That measure, and that
measure alone, will bring relief to this
country, which will make them on a par
with the money of the civilized world. It
is the government that has deprecated its
own promises; and it is now incumbent on
tbe Governments Representatives here to
provide that tte government shall make
up to those whom they have forced to take
this depreciated paper, the difference be
tween it and gold. No other measure will
be tolerated by the civilized world, or win
bring relief to distressed labor. The stagna
tion of capital, the disturbance of values
these bring all our woes.
Mr. Cox deprecated the renewal of
this financial discussion as neces
sarily fruitless. We know, be said,
that no results will flow from it except the
fluctuations in business which are sure to
follow Congressional agitation. The solid
people, the business men, tbe merchants
aud the workingmen, do not expect legis
lation at this session. It would be wise,
if not decorous to allow the popular party,
when in power, to settle this question if
tbey can. Business, if reviving, will feel a
blow from tbis discussion or tne subject,
speculators will thrive on these inconse
quential debates. We know the Senate will
not pass this measure and the House snouid
not; aud if it were passed, the President
would veto it.
Mr. Kelly rose to a point of order and
protested against any attempt to overawe
the Uouse by threats of what the Senate or
President would do.
Mr. Dawes insisted on his motion that
the committee rise. ....
Mr. Cox This is the dying kick of a
dying party. (Lanchter.)
The committee then rose, the bills were
ordered printed and the House adjourned.

The question was discussed of a successor

oblige Disraeli to retire, Tbe resn t of tl
discussion showed that Earl Derby had a
very slender majority. The indications
were that tbe Duke of Richmond or the

of the so-called reactionary wing of the
