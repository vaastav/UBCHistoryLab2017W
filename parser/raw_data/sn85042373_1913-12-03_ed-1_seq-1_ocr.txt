The Lights of Brightest Gold
This is the season when gold, silver, diamonds, and other precious stones

It is a splendid season for buyers to study advertising in live daily news
papers like. The Times and use it for a guide.
You want to be sure when you buy jewelry—for you are depending
largely on the integrity of the dealer.
It is a wise rule to patronize the jeweler who advertises, for he is putting
himself and his claims publicly on record..
He is stamping himself with a guarantee, just as his solid silver ware is
stamped sterling.
He cannot go back on his printed promise—it would be commercial sui
cide.
Study your newspaper carefully before yoo go on your shopping tour

The stairways were all aflame when the alarm was
given.

street. After the firemen moved back, men continued to
jump from the upper windows. The fire escapes were
blocked by the flames.
