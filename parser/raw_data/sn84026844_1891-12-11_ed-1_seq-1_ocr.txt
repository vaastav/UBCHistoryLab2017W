Washington, 0. C!., Dec. 10.?The
questions that are being very generally
askcil .13 to why Mr. Wilson's name was
not presented in tho lato caucuses as a
compromise candidate ior speaker can
bo satisfactorily answered by tiioso who
.were on tho insUlo of tho fight horc. In
fact, they can all be answered with one
word?jealousy. Mr. Wilson's name
was not presented because peoplo in
Vido and out of tho West Virginia dele
gation bitterly op < .aetDovery auggo'.tion
looking to that end, and they did this
because, as they flatly acknowledged,
if Mr. Wilson siiouul havo been se
lected as the Pom > iratic candidate for
speaker lie would then, oven more than
now, belittle the remainder of tho dele
gation and withal havo less uso for cer
tain othor leading lights of tho Host
Virginia Democracy than ever.
CAl'KltAKT's 1'OStTlON.
Tho story of ill feeling manifested in
tho caucus betweon Messrs. Aldcr.-jon
and l'endluton on the one side, and Mr. I
Capchart on tho other, in tiie mattci o I
a pair for the latter on ono ballot has
alroad/ been given in these dispatches.
That was but an indication of th'j feel
ing beneath. Neither Aiderson nor
l'endlelon had any uso for Capchart,
simplv becauso lie was for Mills first,
and failing in obtaining him, lor \\ it
son. Capchart agitated so much as a
new member can the question of brm^
ing forward Wilson's name, but lie was
met by a most determined opposition.
ST. CLAIll's HAND.
The head and front of this was Mr. J. |
W. St. Clair. Iiis headquarters were in I
Crisp's room and iio was ono of that
gentleman's most active lieutenants,
ill: had conio on tho scene of hostilities
to see that his man Aiderson kept to
the straight and narrow path, and as lie
etood in tiie doorway seemed to care
little who hoard his announcement
that Wilson's naino should not bo prs-1
Honted under any circumstances, and as i
the seipioi proved, ho was able to make
good his assertion. Wilson was never
a factor in the fight, but no one who
looked on will dony that thero were
often times in tho courso of that ue.s
poruto struggle, whon if tho name o
the West Virginia representative had
l).:ea sorting in the caucus, and had
been backed up by his state delegation,
the chances wero more than tavorablo
for its acceptance.
Mr. Wilson was tho only compromise
candidate and this was his <:reat oivpor
tunitv. He has Mr. .St. Clair to thank
for not being ablo to tako advautaue of
it.
SMOOTHED OVER.
Congressman Capehart made his ap
pearance at tho capitol to-day for the
tirsl time since ho was taken ill just be
fore the final session ot tho Democratic
caucus of Monday, He Bays that tho
statements nuulo by Messrs*. Pendleton
ami Alderson relative to tho supposed
arranjroment to pair with him Monday
night were correct. Mr. lireekenridgo
has apologized to both Vendleton and
Alderson, and explained that ho did not
mean to question their veracity. A j
note written by Mr. Wilson corroborat
ing the statements of tho two Crisp men !
has done much toward reconciling the
allowed misunderstanding and all is now
lovely and harmony prevails.
THE DlltECT TAX CASE.
The resolution introduced by Senator
Faulkner to-day calling011 the secretary

the amount of said tax refunded to the

gress approved March 2, 1891, and his
reasons, if any, for his failure to pay

governor of tho State of West Virginia,
which was appropriated by the last

Mr. Faulkner also introduced a joint

Washington, D. 0., Dec. 10.'?One of
tho first subjects to occupy the atten
tion of tho foreign alfairs cuinmittco
after the organization of the committees
of tho house by Speaker Crisp will be
that of harsh treatment of Hebrews by
Russia. This question will bo earnestly
pressed uponthoattention of thecommit
tee, and it will bo urged to go as far as
possible in expressing its sympathy
with the Russian Jews in their distress
and to tako such measures consonant
with the usages of diplomacy as will
tend to secure an amelioration of their
condition.
Tho subject will bo brought to the
attention of the committee, probably by
the introduction of a formal resolution,
but tho customary distribution of the
various portions of the President's mes
sage will bring the matter before the
committee in tho absence of any resolu
tion whatever.
About two score members of Congress
were in and about the lionso of repre
sentatives this morning, answering cor
respondence, chatting and listening to
appeals for ollico and considering the
now absorbing topic of committee as
signments.
THE SPEAKER l'.USY.
The house not being in session, it was
comparatively an idle day ior tho mem
bers, but for the now speaker it was
one of arduous and unremitting toil.
His private room, just outside the house
lobby, was never deserted, and consul
tations with' narty leaders on tho policy
to be pursued during tho Congress and
tho fittest men to carry out the work to
be done were almost continuous, and
such time as remained was devoted to
an accumulationofcorrespondencoor to
persons who desire tho speaker's assis
tance in ono way or another to attain
some object thev huvo in view.
.Senator Manderson to-day reintro
duced a bill similar in purpose to the
ono introduced by hi in last session to
increase the efficiency of the infantry
of the army. The bill provides for the
increase of infantry regiments to twelve
companies, officered as at present, with
tho addition of junior otficers for the
t.wo proposed additional companies.
The bill also proposes to incrcaso the
enlisted men in the arm v to 30,000 men.
The senate to-day broke the record in
the way of measures introduced in a
single day, there having been til2 bills
and eight joint resolutions presented.
This is about 100 more than ever before
introduced in one day.
NOT VET DECIDED.
Tito speaker this afternoon had not
yet decided upon Ins colleagues on tho
rules committee, and the probabilities
are that no conclusion will be reached
until tho house reconvenes .Saturday
and perhaps not until next week. Tho
speaker has given some consideration
to suggestions which mombers havo
offered him in favor of a recurrence to
the former policy of choosing the mem
bers of tho committee, tho majority of
which should be in c'.oso personal and
political relations with the speaker.
The matter has not yet gone beyond the
stage of informal discussion.
Mr. Carlisle, when he becamospeaker,
departed from tho custom of selectim:
members of the committee on rules re
irardless of their committee assign
ments, and made its membership go as
a matter of course to the chairmen of
the two' most important committees,
namely ways and means and appropri
ations.
Speakers KandaU and Keifer had se
lected tiie rules committee with regard
to other considerations, Messrs. Jilack
btirn and Alexander 11. .Stephens being
tho former's associates and havingoth
erwiso special committco prominence.
want a lnrrunx.
A number oi Democratic congress
men urgo a return to that policy, and
represent that its effect would be to
strengthen tho speaker. The ways and
means.and anpropriation committees
now havo prior rights under tho rules
over their respective chairmen on tho
rules committee, which is the guiding
or "steering" body of tho house. The
result is represented to be disastrous to
other committees, whose business may
be important. Membership on this rules
committee, it is urged, should be of
high honor without ot her committeo as
signment except of a very ordinary
Character, such as tho chairmanship,
perhaps, of some minor committee;
Moreover,, as tho chairmen of the two
principal committeos would bo thoman
agors of work originating with the com
mittees, tho speaker would have these
men as his active lieutenants in fiscal,
and revenue affairs, and the rules com
mittee members as lieutenants in other
proposed legislation,and together would
nave an excellent opportunity to keep
thoroughly in touch with his party.
ilKHI) not IN IT.
It has been presumed that ex-Speaker
Reed would bo one of the minority rep
resentatives in tho rules 'committee,,
. but under this policy such perhaps
I would not* bo tho case, as Mr. llood
i might prefer to lead tho minority of the
l committee on ways and moans.
Thero are two aid en, however, to tho
1 proposed method of constituting the
i ruled committeo, and the speaker also
heard the objections that wore urged
1 against tho plan, it was represented
1 that the appropriations and tho wav?
and means committees were tho most
' important ot all committees and that
thoir work would bo tho feature of tho
session. It was urged that the chair

have representation on tho rules com
mittee lot' the reason that otherwise
thoir policy might bo blocked by tho
introduction of special orders having
precedence.

It was also urged that it was to tho
intoreat of the harmonious working of
the houao to have tho order of legisla
tion in tho hands of those directly con
cerned in tho chief measures to bo
brought iip.
Mr. Crisp listened throughout tho
day to arguments on this and other
matters relating to tho policy of the
party in this house in this congress.
Subsequently lie said nothing had
been definitely decided upon as to tho
committees, and that he was unablo to

Mr. Springer, of Illinois, who is likely
to bo chairman of thojvays and means
committee, if Mr. Mill's should be
J ollered and decline tho honor, said to
day that his policy with reference to
tho tariff was to4 provide for free wool,
free salt, free lumber, ireo cotton tics,
ireo coal and free binding twine. Ho
! said: "J do not think wo should
attempt a general revision of the tarilf
: at this time.
i '*1 think there should bo appointed a
strong committee on manufactures, with
abjo investigators in it. This commit
tee would bo a sort of adjunct to tho
ways and means eommitle, which could
goon with its work and then subse
quently get all tho testimonv without a
long lfbt of hearings.
"These inquiries should not be con
ducted with a spirit of hostility toward
tho manufacture?, but with a* view to
ascertain the bottom facts and ascer
tain in each caso what, if any, degree
of protection is needed, as I have a

protection than is roallv tho case.

decrease of,...i,74$,5S3 from the amount
appropriated on account of pensions

usually frequent occurrence. Tho Porto

As a matter ot fact the Turkish govern

that the latter do just ? about as they

Pauis, Dec. 10.?In an interview tho
secretary of theCbincso legation in this
city said that the Tartar dynasty of
China makes[common cause with Europe
in matters of thought and morals, and
it is for this reason that the present
ruler of China was regarded with sus
picion by the Chinese of the old school.
Tho present rising in China, the secre
tary said, was partly duo to the ultra
conservative spirit of the old Chinese
school which imagines that tho govern
ment shows too much favor to foreign
ers, and is too well disposed toward
Christians. Tho secretary adds: "If
we were a war-like people this condition
of all'airs might result iu the overthrow
of the government, but except among
the Tartars tho profession of arms is
despised. Still, China eau put in the
field two million fully equiped soldiers if
it should become necessary."
CHILEANS MAY FIGHT.
How They llocelvctl President Harrison'.*
Views on tho Trouble.
Valparaiso, December 10.?President
Harrison's statement of tho situation
growing out of tho trouble between
this country and the United States, is
considered here as threatening an open
rupture.
It is not bolicvcd that tho Chilean
government will apologise or pay any
material indemnity. The majority iu
the Chilean Congress is known to be
opposed to any concession, and the gov
ernment would find it difficult to carry
the necessary support for any humiliat
ing measures.
It is now no secret that the govern
ment is proceeding actively with war
like preparations, and that artillery oi
the latest manfacture has been ordered
from Germany.
'The situation is complicated by
Spain's demand for a largo indemnity.
The Chilean's liavo always detested the
Span birds, and tho hatred is quickened
by this demand. They would challenge
Spain if they had not the United States
to deal with.
Captain Schley declines to express
any opinion for the public as to the
President's message, but it is evident
that lie is pleased with it.

with reference to that clause of Presi

refers to tho largo influx of Chinese
into tho United States from Canada,
Minister of Customs Bowcll said that
Dominion Government was powerless
to render assistance in checking the
movement. As regards tho returning
of Chinaman the country from whence
they came, as carried outby tho United
States authorities toward Chinamen
smuggling themselves across tho bor
der, .Mr. Howell concurred in the onin
ion recently given by one of the United
States district courts, that where thoy
hud established a domicile in the Dom
inion by paying their per capita tax,
they should be returned to Canada,
but"where they had landed' at Van
couver in transit to the United States,
and had smuggled themselves across
the border without paying tho Cana
dian per capita tax, they should be re
turned to China, the place whence
they came.

TAUN T IN GKItMAXY.
Chtutccllor Cuprlvl OUcuhmc* tl?u HfTect of
the Trout lo?.
Bkhli.v, Dec. 10.?In the Iloichstag
to-day tho chancellor said that tho
innnediato eirect of tho treaties
upon the finances of the empire would
bo n diminution in revenue amounting
to nearly 1H,000,000 marks. This Was a
matter that required btidgot considora
tion. In regard to the t|Uostlon of tlio
dillbrontial treatment ot countries not
included in tho treaties, those conutrios
having tho most favored nation treat
ment would receive the benefits of the
treaties. llegarding other countries,
negotiations were about to open
whereby Germany would endeavor to
obtain concessions. It was needloss to
speak of jtussia. The lamontnblo dis
tress that prevailed in that country,
causing a stoppage of exports, would
not be removed for some timo, and it
was useless to discuss what would bo
done afterward. .As regards the United
States, tho governments had decided to
continue to take their stand on tho
basis of tho arrangements of 1 S.S5,
wherebv tho United States received
most favored nation treatment. In any
ease the governmont had no intention
to make a fur. her reduction of tariffs.
In tho meantime tho federal govern
ments withstood all attacks.
In connection with alleged distress
in Germany ho said lie was likely to
see that the agriculturists had done
more to maintain duties than the gov
ernment, especially in the eastern
provinces, where protective tarills wero
of effect, if anywhere. Nevertheless,
if it had not -been for these tarills an
agricultural crisis would havo coma
upon the eountrv which might have
lasted for yearn. Farmers, to whatever
party they belonged, must ho reck
oned among the elements by which
the state was upheld. The agriculture
of the country could very well bear,
without risk, a reduction in tho tariff
rate of one and a half marks. Tho rais
ing of tho rate to livo marks had been
an experiment which had answered tlio
purpose of the federal government. In
fact, it had been considered how far
tariff rates effecting agriculture could
bo reduced without injury to
tho country. In tho matter of
?wine, it had been tho aim to create
sharp competition against artificial
wines, schnapps anil the so-called
"French clarets," so as to provide on
German soil a battle field i'or Italian
wines, as against those of France. Tiie
reduction in duties on necessaries of
life was of advantage to tho working
people, lie concurred in the saying of ?
Chaplain Stoekor, "Wo must not only
go forth against undue claims of tlio
workmen, but wo must make advances
toward him."
Adverting to the MeKinlev bill, tho
chancellor said: "Wo wish tho coun
tries of Europe to preserve their inde
pendence against America. For this
purpose they must unite together. The
treaties just concluded will give a sure
guarantee for the future."
llerr Keichensperger, centrist, said
ho hoped that the treaties, in view of
their economic and political .strengthen
ing of the empire, would be agreed to
with as great unanimity as possible.
llerr Von Knnitz, conservative, op
posed tho chancellor's policy. lie said
lie regretted' that the negotiations
showed that they had only freo trado
counsellors. He looked forward to tho
ruin of the German agriculture;. lie,
himself, as a landowner, would rather
submit to adverse fate than associate
himself with transactions irrecon
cilable with his conscience. Tlio
chancellor responded that he
had been aided ? by the same
advisers that assisted Prince Bismarck,
and that ho must rebel most emphat
ically the insinuation that any instruc
tions issued from the chancellors had
not. his full approval. The debate was
adjourned. At a meeting of the con
servative members of tho Iteichstag
twelve voted in favor of and twenty
four against the treaties. Her Karl iff
read a telegram stating that Prince P.is
marck did not intend to appear during
the debate.

Den'Vei:, Dec. 10.?Immediately after
Judge Rising had ordered court con
vened in the Graves trial tho prosecu
tion put Dr. J. A. Scwell, of the Denver
University, on the stand, lie had made
an analysis of tho bottle of liquid pro
rented him by Dr. Holmes and Mr.
Worrell, jr., some of wnich, it is alleged,
caused tho death of Mrs. Josophino'
Barnaby. . lie found this liquid con
tained per cent of arsenic and 21 per
cent of alcohol, and judging from tho
analysis tho bottle contained 132 grains
of :i/scnic and no whisky at all.
On cross examination tli'o doctor said
the bottle is what is called a sixteen
ounco bottle, and when received by him
contained about eleven ounces o? tho
liquid.
The bottlo was then introduced as ev
idence and passed around among tho
jurors and lawyers who, nearly all, put
a little; oil their lingers, rubbed jt on
their tongues and smacked their lips in
their enpeavor to determine whether it
was a good quality of lino old whisky
; from our friends in tho woods on tho
mountains.
i Dr. Sowell was recalled and his cross
examination continued. In reply to
Judge Macon's 'question the doctor said
lid had mado tho analysis by tho Marsh
| test and ho lirst looked for mercury or
| some corrosive substance, but instead
of getting mercury he got copper and
arsenic;
I Upon redirect examination ho stated
j thf;t antimony could readily bo taken
| for arsenic, but not if tho-two drugs
wore seen together. Then, antimony
was not readily dissolved, while arsenic
was; Dr. Sowell was excused and l'ro
j lessor "Walter Haines, who also ligured
j in thoMillington case, was called to tho
stand.
In Juno last Mr. MePharland gavo
him a fluid for analysis, lie identified
I tho fatal bottlo as tho bottle from which
tho fluid was poured, lie mado an
j analysis by four tests, among them tho
Marsh, and his results were tho same
I as Dr. StiwcU's. Prof. Mason, who
I mado an examination of tho viscera and

I lied to tho lindingof arsenic in sufficient
quantities to cause death. At tho closo
