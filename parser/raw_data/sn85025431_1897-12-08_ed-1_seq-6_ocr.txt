iSOLONS IN SESSION
FIRST REGULAR SESSION OF THE
FIFTY-FIFTH CONGRESS,
Vreildent'i Aferaag* Read Before Both
Houses—Cuba and Currency the Frl»«
cipal Topics, Though Other Important
Matters Were Touched Upon—A Sum
nary of the Document.
WASHINGTON, Deo. 6.—The regular
or long session of congress as it is
called, because there is no constitu
tional limitation upon the period of its
duration, opened at noon. The extra
session robbed the opening of the regu
lar session of the exoitement and inter
est which usually attaches to it. At
the opening of a regular session or
dinarily Washington thrills with ex
citement. The hotel lobbies surge with
place hunters in the wake of the vari
ous candidates for speaker, clerk, door
keeper, etc., the members are strug
gling for committee assignments and
the air is full of rumors and plots and
counterplots. But as the house was
completely organized at the extra ses
sion and all the committee assignments
were made then Washington is now
tranquil.
After the usual opening formalities
the president's message was read in
both houses.
President McKinley, in his asual mes
sage to congress, congratulated it upon
assembling ljjider felicitious conditions.
Peace and good will with all the nations
ef the earth continue unbroken, he says,
end we should feel genuine satisfaction at
the growing spirit of fraternal regard and
unification in all sections of our country
and the lifting of great public questions
above party prejudice.
Beginning with the subject of the finan
ces, the president says that while the full
effect of the legislation of the extra session
has not yet) been realized, what it has al
ready accomplished assures us of its time
liness and wisdom. The next question
pressing for consideration is that of the
currency. The evil of the present system
Is found in the great cost to the govern
ment of maintaining at a parity with gold
our different forms of money, and the ex
perience of the past four years has demon
strated that this is not only an expensive
charge upon the government, but a dan
gerous menace to the national credit. It
is manifest that we must devise some plan
to protect the government against bond
issues for repeated redemptions. We have
(900,000,000 of currency which the govern
ment by solemn enactment has under
taken to keep at par and nobody is obliged
to redeem in gold but the government,
Which must borrow the gold.
Fay Out Greenbacks for Gold Only.
He recommends that as soon as the re
ceipts of the governments are quite suf
ficient to pay all the expenses of the gov
ernment that when any United States
notes are presented for redemption in
gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes
shall be kept and set apart and only paid
out in exchange for gold.
The president invites careful considera
tion for the detailed plan of the secretary
of the treasury to protect the gold reserve.
He concurs with him in the recommenda
tion that national banks be allowed to is
sue notes to the faoe value of their bonds
deposited that the circulating tax be re
duced to one-half of 1 per cent, and that
national banks may be established with a
capital of $J5,000. He also recommendE
that the issue of national banks be re
stricted to the denomination of $10 and
upwards and that they be required to re
deem their notes in gold.
The Cuban Difficulty.
Turning to foreign affairs, the presi
dent devotes much space in his message
to a consideration of the Cuban question,
which he says is the most important prob
lem with which our government is now
called upon to deal in its foreign rela
tions. Summarizing the history of for
mer outbreaks, the president comes doWn
to the present insurreotion, speaking of
its remarkable increase, its tenacious ex
istence against enormous forces massed
by Spain, the widespread destruction of
property and the disregard of the civil
ized code of war on both sides. He says
these conditions give rise to gravest ap
prehensions. There is no desire on our
part to profit by Spain's misfortunes, and
we have only the desire to see the Cubans
enjoying that measure of self control
which is the inalienable right of man. Of
the concentration policy of Weyler, he
says: "It has utterly failed as a war
measure. It is not civilized warfare—it
is extermination.".
Against this abuse of the rights of war
the president says he has felt constrained
on repeated occasions to enter the
Firm
and
Earnest Protest
of this government. He outlines his in
structions to Minister Woodford, which
were in substance to impress upon the
Spanish government the sincere wish of
the United States to lend its aid toward
the ending of the war by reaching a peace
ful and lasting result, just and honorable
to Spain and to the Cuban people. It waj
also asked whether Spain of her own voli
tion should no* make proposals for settle
ment, «nd it was said that he could not
contemplate an indefinite period for the
accomplishment of this result.
The Spanish reply to Mr.Woodford was,
in the president's opinion, in the direc
tion of abetter understanding. It admit
ted our friendly purposes and deep inter
est, and declared that the new govern
ment was bound to a change of policy
that should satisfy the United States and
pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To
this end political reforms will be put into
effect and military operationt conducted
on humane lines. It was suggested that
£jpain be left free to conduct military op
erations and grant political reforms,
while
the United States for its part should
enforce neutral obligations and cut off
the assistance which the insurgents, it
was asserted, received from this country.
Early and complete pacification is hoped
for.
Have Mot Neglected Our Duty.
The president declares that the Spanish
disposition to charge us with failure to
meet international duties is baseless and
points to the efforts this government has
made at the cost of millions and by the
employment of the administrative ma
chinery of the nation to perform its
full duty. Premising that through
out all the horror and danger to
our own peace, the United States has
never abrogated its right to determine its
policy as. to Cuba, the president points
out that of untried measures there re
mains only: Recognition of the insur
gents as belligerents recognition of the
Independence of Cuba neutral Interven
tion to end the war by imposing a ra
tional compromise between the contest
ants an intervention in favor of one or
the other party. He says: "I speak not
of forcible annexation, for that cannot be
thought of. That by our code of morality
would be criminal aggression-"
Belligerency Not a Good Tiling.
Taking up the question of belligerenoy,
the president quotes at length from Presi
dent Grant's message of Dec. 7, 1875,
wherein he declared that the condition in
Cuba warranted neither the recognition
of independence nor the recognition of
belligerency. He adds that moreover a
recognition of belligerency would confer
upon neither party to the conflict a status
not theretofore actually possessed while it
would weigh heavily in Spain's behalf,
giving her the right of search on fhe high
seas and extending her maritime rights to
the margin of our territorial waters.
"For these reasons," says the president,
1
'I regard the recognition of the belliger
enoy of the Cuban insurgents as now un
wise and therefore inadmissible. Should
that step hereafter be deemed wise, as a
matter of right and duty, the executive
will take it."
Hopeful Ch inee in Spain's Policy.
He points to the hopeful change in the
Spanish policy to the pledge of reform
and to the abatement of the horrors of
war as reasons against Intervention on
humanitarian grounds. The first acts of
the new government lie in the honorable
paths it has outlined the policy of exter
mination has been reversed broad olem
encies proffered measures have been tak
en to relieve the horrors of starvation.
The power of the Spanish armies, it is as
serted, is to be used, not to spread ruin
and desolation, but to protect the resump
tion of agricultural industries.
The president sketches the auton
omy scheme of the Spanish government
and says that it was honestly due to Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
lhance to realize her expectations and to
prove the asserted efficacy of the neW
order of things, to which she stands irre
vocably committed. He points to the
many concessions already made, to the
modification of the horrible order of con
centration, to the release of the Competi
tor prisoners, and the fact that not a
single American citizen is now under
arrest in Cuba. He says the near future
will demonstrate whether righteous peace
is likely to be attained. If not, the ex
igency of further and other aotion by the
United States will remain to be taken.
Annexittlon of Hawaii.
The president next takes up the subject
of the annexation of Hawaii which, he
says, should be accomplished.
The president says of the international
monetary commission that, notwithstand
ing diligent effort, the envoys have failed
so far to secure an agreement. Gratifi
cation is expressed at the action of France
in this matter in joining in our efforts and
it is said that the negotiations are still
pending. Meanwhile the envoys have not
made their final report, believing that the
doubts raised in certain quarters respect
ing the possibility of maintaining parity
between gold and silver may yet be solved.
The president earnestly hopes that their
labors may bring about an international
agreement.
Protection of Reals.
Reference if made to the recent confer
ence at Washington on the subject of pro
tection of seal life, the result of which
place beyond controversy, it is said, the
duty of the government's concern to adopt
measures without delay for the protection
of the herds. Negotiations to this end are
now in progress.
International arbitration is declared by
the president to represent the best senti
ment of the civilised world, and treaties
embodying these humane principles on
broad lines without in any way imperiling
our interests or honor will have his con
stant encouragement.
The Civil Service.
The president devotes the last chapter
of his message to the civil service, the
practical improvement of which, he says,
has long been a subject of earnest discus
sion, and which has of late years received
increased legislative and executive ap
proval. During the past few months the
service has been placed upon a still firmer
basis of business methods and personal
merit. While the right of deserving vet
eran soldiers to reinstatement has been
asserted, dismissals for merely political
reasons have been carefully guarded
against the examinations improved and
made practical, and a distinct advance
has been made by giving a hearing before
dismissal upon all cases where incompe
tency is charged or demand made for the
removal of officials. This last has been
done without impairing the power of re
moval, one of the vital safeguards of the
system. Much remains to be done before
the system can be perfected, and the pres
ident says that he shall not hesitate to
exempt cases whioh he thinks have been
properly included in the classified service
or include those which in his judgment
will best promote the public service. The
system has the approval of the people and
it will be his endeavor to uphold and ex
tend it.
Kansas Pacific
Snie,
Speaking of the pending sale of the
Kansas Pacific railroad it is said that if
no better bid is received than the upset
price fixed by the court the government
would receive only 12,500,000 on its claim
of nearly $12,000,000. He believes that
the government has the authority te bid
on the road and has directed the secretary
of the treasury to make the deposit of
$900,000 required to qualify as a bidder
and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal
to the principal of the debt to the govern
ment. He suggests, however, that in a
matter so important as the government
becoming a possible owner of the railroad,
congress should enact some legislation to
define its views. It is clear to him, how
ever, that the government should not
permit the property to be sold at a price
less than one-half the principal of its
debt and less than one-fifth of its entire
debt, principal and Interest.
Department Reports.
Concluding the message, the president
says:
I am forced by the length of this mes
sage to omit many important references
to affairs of the government with which
congress will have to deal at the present
session. They are fully discussed in the
departmental reports, to all of which I in
vite your earnest attention.
The estimates of the expense of the
government by the several departments
will, I am sure, have your careful
scrutiny. While' the congress may
not find It an easy task to re
duce the expense of the government,
It should not encourage their increase.
These expenses will, in my judgment, ad
mit of a decrease in many branches of the
government without injury to the public
service. It is a commanding duty to keep
the appropriationsVithin the receipts of
the government and thus avoid a deficit.
