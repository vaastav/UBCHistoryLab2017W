SMOOT MEMBER OF BODY
THAT DEFIES THE LAWS
Declares Senator Burrows
in Speech on Resolu
tion to Expel.
NAMED BY HIS CHURCH
Polygamous Marriages Still
Sanctioned and Secretly
Performed.
Washington. Doc. 11. At the conclu
sion of the morning business in the
senate today, Senator Burrows, chair
man of the senate committee on privi
leges and elections, calleil i the
lesolution from that committee de
claring that Keed Smoot is not entitled
to a seat as senator from the state of
Utah, and addressed the senate on that
subject.
I'uljeamy "ot Ibr IsMiie.
Burrows said there had been no
proof submitted to sustain the allega
tion that Smoot is a pedygamist, add
ing the recommendation of the commit
tee on privileges and elections in fa
vor of declaring vacant the seat of the
Utah senator is not based on sucn
charge. Burrows said the impeach
ment is based entirely upon the con
nection of Smoot with the governing
body of the church, consisting of the
president and 12 apostles.
'utrol Kvery Otliee.
He referred to this body as the
'hierarchy," and said it possesses prac
tically every political position in the
state government. He cited many in
stances of jjolitieal interference not
only in Utah, but adjoining states. He
quoted at length the church manifesto
of IMmJ requiring members to obtain
consent of the hierarchy before becom
ing candidates for office. Smoot had
leen compelled to obtain this permis
sion. "lie was nominated by the hier
archy," said Burrows, "and the selec
tion was ratified by the legislature."
f'oneetle Meiulerlil.
He said Sn.oot's membership in the
church governing bedy, which incul
cates belief in polygamy, is conceded,
that proof is indubitable, that in spite
of the manifesto of IS'JO, issued by the
head of the church, counseling the
suspension of polygamy, the majority
niemlers of the hierarchy is today
openly and confessedly defying the
laws of the land prohibiting such
crimes.
Mnrrleil in STf.
The record is so shocking as to
challenge credulity. He declared that
"It is shown by testimcmy a majority
of the apostles are living in polyga
mous cohabitation, including President
Smith. Plural marriages are perform
ed in secret, in darkened rooms, on
highways remote from habitation."
Coming to the connection of Smoot
with the hierarchy. Burrows said prac
tically, all the members were polyga
mists when he became a member.
InBarnrrd !' Aimwlntlon.
"The vital question, therefore, is," he
said, "can one become a member and
identify himself with a band of law
breakers, knowing them to be such,
participate in their counsels, sustain
them in their conferences, and yet es
cape all responsibility for their unlaw
ful acts? Such contention will not
stand the test of citner law or reason.
linn Aided Hierarchy.
"The senator's complicity in encour
aging polygamy and polygamous co
habitation does not consist wholly in
the fact that he is one of the govern
ing bodies of that church. By repeat
ed acts he has, as a member of a
quorum of 12 apostles, given active
aid and support to the hierarchy and
its defiance of the statutes of his state
and the laws of common decency, and
In its encouragement of polygamous
practices by both precept and exam
ple." v.
Xot Entitled i Representation.
Burrows concluded by saying: "I
submit that an organization that fos
ters and encourages crime; practices
polygamy and polygamous cohabita
tion, desecrates the home, undermines
and shakes the foundations of human
society and government, and defies tne
authority of the state and national gov
ernment, is not entitled to have its
representative In the senate of the
United States, and I therefore ask the
adoption of the resolution."

REARING OF DYKE
Efforts to Save Bed of Salton
Sea Given Up by South
ern Pacific.
Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 11. With
the breaking of the Colorado river
through a $1,000,000 dike, just com
pleted by the Southern Pacific, settlers
in the Imperial valley have given up
practically all hope of saving their rich
farm lands from inundation. As most
of these farms lie-from 70 to 200 feet
below sea level, there is little pros
pect of the waters being drained off
unless government engineers evolve n
plan to turn the river back into iti
channel .
Ffnr Sen Mny Cover City.
Where today are rich towns and
prosperous farms, the future seems to
portend only a huge salt Inland sea,
hemmeel in by mountains. The city of
Imperial will be from 50 to 70 feet
under water shoulel the waters not be
dammed shortly."
The transcontinental line of the
Southern Pacific is doomed already.
Orders were issued yesterday to rush
2,000,000 ties and rails to Mecca to
build a new line beyond the mountain
ranges for a distance of 40 miies.
Gangs of men have been ejrdered to
begin operations immediately upon re
ceiving instructions from General Man
ager Calvin.
Southern Pacific Quit KIltt.
Southern Pacific officials are of the
opinion that the railroad will give up
the struggle with the waters, as it 13
estimated that $2,000,000 more would
be required in a second attempt to
turn the river back into its old chan
nel. But there is no assurance of the
permanency of the work. Should the
Southern Pacific abandon the" fight,
the entire region Is doomeel unless the
government will take immediate steps.
To add to the gravity of the situa
tion, the river may scour its way back
through deep canon and carry away

LET ISLANDERS IN
Burden of Message of President
Vto Congress Regarding
Porto Rico.
SAYS PEOPLE ARE READY
Enlightened and Patriotic and Should
Therefore Be Made Full
Citizens.
Washington, Dee. 11. President
Roosevelt today submitted to congress
a special message em Porto Rico, the
result of his recent visit to that island
while enroute home from the isthmus.
The increase in exports of the Ameri
can iKjssession to more than double
what they were in the best years un
der the Spanish regime is commented
upon as reflecting the improvement in
government now enjoyed and congress
is complimented for legislation that
worked to this end.
Heady to lie I'Hlzeii.
The president, however, believes
that the time has come when the peo
ple are ready for full citizenship, and
recommends in the following language
that it be conferred:
"There is a matter to which I wish
to call your special attention, and that
is the desirability of cemferring full
American citizenship .upon the people
of Ptrto Rice. I most earnestly hope
that this will be done. I can not see
how any harm can possibly result
from it, and it seems to me a matter
of right and justice to the people of
Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are
glad to be under our Hag, they are
making rapid progress along the path
of orderly liberty. Surely we shoultl
show our appreciation ef them, our
pride in what they have elone, and our
pleasure in extending recognition for
what has been done, by granting them
full American citizenship."

POLICY THE SAMEILA
Secretary of Interior Hitchcock
Declares He Will Continue
to Prosecute
IN CASES OF LAND FRAUD
Though His Efforts Are and Have Been
Opposed by Strongest In
fluences. Washington, D. C, Dec. 11. Ethan
Allen Hitchcock, secretary of the in
terior, in his annual report refers to
the prosecution of all persons conspir
ing to defraud the government of pub
lic lands, asserting that the efforts of
the department will be continued. He
says the enforcement of the law to pro
tect the public domain has been the
cardinal principle of his administra
tion. "It is to Ire regretted," states the
secretary, "that the efforts made to re
lease it from the grip of its despoilers
have been met by every embarrass
ment that human ingenuity could de
vise; powerful influences have been
concerned and have not hesitated to
aggressively exert every agency that
could be commanded to weaken the
hand of the law; even local land of
fice officials have been subservient to
such influences, and the punishment
imposed by the courts has, in many
cases, been so conspicuously inade
quate as to encourage rather than de
ter violations of the law.
Proceeilcil Without Prejudice.
"In the discharge of my duty under
the law I have proceeded without the
slightest prejudice for or against any
person or persems interested. Appar
ently they are all on the same footing:
in my judgment, however, the higher
the offeneler the greater the crime
against society and law .because of
the force and influence ef the higher
example. It is not. possible for per

Scene nre Touching.
Scenes in some churches were ex
iremily touching. Not in years had
there- be'n such an niw ndanco at mass.
The number of women, especially, was
large, and was noteworthy as an fndi-

But. on the 'e of the struggle It is
becoming more annnrcid lhat both gov

tics are resisting ihe advice of the in
temperate minister of public worship,
Briand, who announced that the "gov

of closing the churches," and Cardinal
Hichard, archbishop of Paris, has
strongly censured placarding appeals
to clericals to make violent resistance
to the law officers.

"No violence," he says, "but passive
resistance to unjust law, after exhaust
ing all protests at every step."
This is the disposition so far as the
higher ecclesiastics are concerned, but
their followers evidently have no In
tention to submit and are preparing to
assume the role of martyrs, abandon
the churches, and organize private
worship.
Iteiiiutlntc Private Property.
Cardinal Hichard and many bishops
already have begun the removal of

mansions, and the clergy are preparing
to leave their rectories and move into
