The pla'm, practical manner in
which President Arthur discusses
the Mormon question in his annual
message justifies the belief that he
not only has a horror for that haten
ful institution, 6uch as should be felt
by all enlightened persons, but that
he haa practical ideas. He believes
that the way to extripate a great so
cial evil like this is to strike it hard
blows to render it hateful in the
eight of Christian meu, as it is in the
sight of God. If Congress wiil act
upon hia suggestions and pass
Bound, wholesome laws, there is
no danger about their enforcement.
His lamented predecessor had taken
a decided stand against Mormonism,
and Lis position is no less decided.
The country has had enough tem
porizing with Moroconism. It is
tiaie that the strong arm of the law
was invoked, to-crueh it out. The
President's heart is right, now let
Congress arm him with authority to
act.
Geuain. Disappointment.
For a man to read half way down
a col-1
uinu of Hue print before he discovers that
be la on the track cf another "infallible
roiuedy" is un oeeasiou where a few vigorous

tiaing dodges now -a-days that we fall afonl
of a nostrum 4 often as anything else. The
only genuine disappointment we have had
for a week was when we read the following
verse :
" As homeward comes the married man,
He' met by wife at door,
"With fond embrace and loving kiss

and failed to find after it a recommenda

The Jews.
A handbook, giving a general account
of the Jews, by Dr. R. Andree, estimates
their total number throughout the world
at about 6,100,000. Only 180,000 of the
race are to be found in Asia, 400,000 in
Africa, 300,000 in America and 20,000 in
Australia. The great majority of the
race, more than 5,000,000, live in Eu
rope. Itoumania contains a far larger
number of Jews, in proportion to its
population than any other European
country, namely, 7.44 per cent, while
Norway contains only thirty -four indi
Wduali of the race. The local distribu
tion of the Jewish population in differ
ent countries is traced out with great
pains by Dr. Andree. Thus in some of
the government districua of Russian Po
land the Jewish inhabitants constitute
from 13 to 18 per cent, of the popula
tion. Although for tho whole of Gen
many the Jewish clement is only lj per
cent, of the population, in the city of
Berlin it has increased to nearly 5 per
oent.
Floating Gardens.
A writer describes the floating vegeta
ble garden of Lake Orinagar, in Cash
mere : They are made by first planting
poplar poles, twenty-five or twenty-eight
fett long, in two or three rows, twelve
or fifteen feet apart. Then the gardener
gathers from the lake a lot of aquatio
plants, and "interweaves them between
liis poles. This forms the support of
the garden. Then more plants are col
lected from the lake, and piled up to the
height of three or four inches. These
soon rot and form the soil, and the gar
den plants first sprouted on the land are
then transplanted to the garden. At
first they are watered, but it does not
take long for the rootlets to find their
way to the water underneath.' The veg
etables raised are said to be Vcy fine,
.and are sold for very low prices.
Art in Folding Linen.
The women of the ancient town of An
jou have acquired a world-wide celebrity
for their art in folding linen for all pur
poses. Their huge linen presses show
some chef d'eeuvrea in the way of folded
table-linen that may be called marvel
ous. In a vast table-cloth folded into a
trough, twenty-four sheep formed of
Medina napkins are drinking, watched
by a large napkin in the shape of a
shepherd, and half a dozen doylies,
lringed, taking the form of dogs. Oth
ers are folded in castles, towers, wind
mills, pitchers and miters of the larger
size, which should be about twenty
eight inches broad and thirty inches
long for dinner. The miter shape has
already f.mnd its wav to the American
table. The bread is" placed in the cen
ter, between the two highest ixanta.

London December 8. The Times,
in an editorial commentiner on the

the languishing condition of Ameri

President Arthur only discovers in
it reason for lamenting that this
branch of enterprise also has not
baen predicted and for suggesting
that a mission be repaired. It is
difficult to see how protection can be
applied to carrying trade, except in
bounties, which will, however, have
an advantage, as the protectionists
may think of handicapping the for
eigners and observing some part of
tho surplus revenues.
The Daily News in a leading article
this morning says: "The European
powers have no desire to meddle
with affairs on the American Conti

meddling, for they agreed together
that the Panama canal, if completed,
no war ship should go through it in

COTTON PLANTERS' ASSOCIA
TION. Address by Commissioner of Ag
riculture Geo. B. Loring.
Atlanta, Ga., December 8. The
National Cotton Planters' Associa
tion continued in session to day, and
transacted . the regular business.
President Morehead was re elected
president ; George M. Kune, treas
urer and Jas. N. Ogden, secretary.
United States Commissioner of Ag
riculture Geo. B. Loring, delivered
an ffddress on " Mutual Relations of
American Industries," in the course
of whi h, he said : The relation ex
isting between the cotton plantation
and market, creatfd by American
manufacturers, is deeply interesting
to this association, which represents a
great branch of industry. I learn
from the cotton movement and regu
lations compiled by R. P. Salter,
member of the New York Cotton
Exchange, that of the total crop of
1870 and 1871 of 4,350,317 bales,
1,110,196 bales were consumed in the
United States ; of the total crop of
1874 and 1875 of 3,832,961 bales,
1,193,005 bales were consumed in
the United States, and of the crop of
1880 and 1881 of 6,605,750 bales
1,938,937 bales were consumed in
the United Stites. The incieise of
home consumption during ten years,
froiii 1870 to - 1881, was 828,741
bales. This increase is more
important considering the fact that
the loss of cotton sold in the English
market is nearly 2 cents per pound
in friecrht, port charges and loss of
weight on bagging, etc., and the
average price in 1880-'81 in Liver
pool was 618-100 pence, and New
York 1134-100 cents per pound, the
advantage of the American market
being nearly 2 cents per pound to
the producers. This important re
lation will continue to increase in
value as American manufactures ex
tend and the home market is en
larged, and will undoubtedly produce
an increase in the average yield of
cotton per acre and the ultimate
uniformity of the crop in the cotton
States, allowance being made for the
difference in soil and " climate.
This, added to tho wide
diversity of farming which
will be adopted hereafter, will do
much to develope the agriculture of
this section. It is undoubtedly true
now that the cotton belt needs varie
ty of crops to fill vast unoccupied
areas not suited to the cotton plant.
(Applause). Nine-tenths of the su
perficial area of these States yield no
production in agriculture except in
a limited degree in pasturage and
wood products. -Rut three acres in
every hundred are in cotton, which
occupied one-third of the breath of
the land actually cultivated. The
cotton area in 1879 was 14,462,438
acre . The area of ten cotton States
ia 45,600,000 acres. The 'cotton
crop is not evenly distribu
ted in these States. It ia almost
unknown. The whole mountainous
system of the southern elopes, as
well as the summits and broad table
lands and high elevations, suited
only to the products of high tern
perate latitude, mixed farming, grain
growing, dairying and orcharding.
It is grown mainly on the limestone
belt of Southewestern Georgia, Cen
tral Alabama and Western Missis
sippi. In general terms, one tenth
of the counties yielding cotton pro
duce half of that crop. The largest
average yield per acre, according to
the census, discloses the local belts
of the greatest productiveness as
follows : . The richest cotton land in
the States is on the Mississippi above
and opposite Vicksburg. The high
est county averages in three States
to prove the superiority of this dis
trict. East Carroll in Louisiana,
Chicot in Arkansas, and Washington
in Mississippi, respectively, stand for
the largest rate of ; production in
these States, and in the cotton belt,
yielding in 1879 but little less than a
bale per acre. The second best dis
trict is also on the Mississippi. The
best yields of three States, Dunklin
in Missouri, Cooke in Tennessee, and
Hickman in Kentucky, In the same
way are grouped Cherokee in Alaba
ma with Polk in Georgia and Marl
borough in South Carolina and Rich
mondin North Carolina. Nine coun
ties north and east of Raleigh, N.
Carolina, scarcely a tenth part of
the State, produce half of the crop
of that State, and the adjoining dis
trict in south east Virginia produces
all of the crop of that State.

MORNING. DECEMBER 9, 1881.
THE SOUTHERN BE4UTY
AS SEEN AT THE INTERNATIONAL
COTTON EXPOSITION.
Diamonds and Pretty Women at At
lanta. How They Affected the Proposed Be
ception to Sherman.
Atlanta correspondent of the
Cincinnati
Commercial.
During the past week the North
ern visitor at the Cotton Exposition
has enjoyed a more than favorable
oprcrtunity of observing at his leis
ure that fascinating element in
Souther society immortalized by
Mrs. Southworth and her contempor
aries, and popularly known as the
Southern beauty. Among the
thousands of citizens of Georgia,
Alabama, the two Carolinas and sis
States represented here in the large
ly increased attendance of the past
five days, the Southern beauty has
been present in no inconsiderable
proportion, and wherever found she
is distinctive among her sex, and is
collectively the reflex of several
types of femimne loveliness. You
find her as a slender brunette, with
classic features, faultless though
delicate form and flashing black eyes ;
or, less numerous but fully asat'rac
tive, in the entrancing and ever pop
ular blonde, who, while of more ro
bust figure and of lees delicate tout
ensemble, is equally graceful and em
inently fitted to 6hine with and in
contrast to her dark-eyed rival.
There is another type here which a
stranger will find prominent among
the two, but which cannot be prop
erly classed as a beauty. That is
the blondine, who must be called
pretty, but not beautiful ; whose dig
nified maimer, charming presence
and graceful carriage necessarily add
to her natural attractions. She is
not in a mixed throng in greater per
centage than either of the others, and
when seen invariably commands ex
tensive and respectful comment from
the opposite sex.
DIAMONDS and pretty WOMBS.
Just here, to a close observer, there
is one very pleasing and striking pes
culiarity about the art building
which does not exist to nearly the
same extent at any other point on
the grounds, and that is the fact
that it is a popular resort for ladies
of refinement, beauty and culture.
Take the dark-eyed Southern beauty
in her native atmosphere, and her
intellectual attainments and fascinat
iag manners form an appropriate
setting to her prepossessing person
ncl. In no place can her combined
qualities be seen to better
advantage than here. She goes
through the several buildings, ad
mires the exhibits which interest her
sex exclusively, grasps the intricate
scientific problem as it is presented
in the mass of cotton and other mas
-chinery, and reads in the exhibits of
improved agricultural instruments
the discrepencies and necessities of
the soil culture in this section, but it
ia in the Art building where ehe is
found in her natural element. Here
are features more congenial to her
taste and at one point particularly is
this most prominent. I epeak of the
Diamond and Jewelry of the E. Jao
ca-d Jewelry Company, of St Louis,
which attracts more wide spread at
tention than any other here. It ia in
the main Art building, immediately
west of the Arcade, and deserves
special mention not only because of
the popular reputation of the firm,
but because of the varied and valu
able character of the exhibit and its
handsome, surroundings. In this
portion of the building, the first
thing that greets the eye of the
visitor is a massive and handsome
EBONY AND GOLD PAVILION,
Draped in curtians of rich material,
carpeted and with heavy plate-glass
sides forming also the outer walls of
commodious show-cases, which are
artistically upholstered in silk and
satin. This is where the Jaccard
Jewelry Companyexhibit is located,
and if nothing else were to give this
information a mammoth iron safe
inside would almoEt tell of the great
treasures which it is its duty to hold
within its grasp.
The most prominent feature of the
display consists in the diamonds
which it embraces, and here the la
dies, true q the instinct of their sex,
congregate and apparently never
weary in canvassing" the many quali
ties of the soltairies and other gems.
At all hours of the day the pavillion
is thronged with the elita of the gen
tle sex,'whose position in society and
circumEtances make them critical
connoisseurs in this particular branch
of the art of female adornment In
passing judgment in this respect the
visitors are greatly assisted by the
very reputation of the Jaccard Com
pany, which, having ben established
in J.829 more than half a century
ago has acquired an extensive and
valuable business throughout the
South, and , are constantly making
important sales at the Exposition,
which compels from day to day the
replenishing of the stock of dia
monds from the home establish
ment. '
A TEN THOrSAND-DOLLAB PAIR.
Among
the
extensive display of
diamonds is
a matched cut pair of
fifty-two and one-half carats, valued
at $10,000, which are the largest
matched pair ever brought, to thia
country. , When one views them the
mind naturally reverts to the crown
jewels of England, France and Rus
sia, to those in Green Vaults of Dres
den, and to the celebrated Kohinoor
of ; India. The latter, you will re
member, weighed five or six hundred
carats in the ' rough, and 132 carats
when cut But while diamonds are
a special feature . with the Jacard
Company, they . are . also extensive
manufacturers of silverware, of which
there are many most beautiful, artis
tic and modern specimens on exhibi-
(ftiriilritf-fif
tion. The company as large con
nections in Europe, by which means
they are enabled to import all of the
latest French, English and Viennese
goods, bronzes, clocks, bric-a-brac,
etc. The exhibit also embraces cab
inets of silverware, clocks, cutlery,
bronzes, bisque, parias and porcelain
ware, vases, repousse ware, watches
bracelets and many other articles in
the fine jewelry line. A pair of large
Satsuma vases which were recently
sold to ex Governor Bross, of Illinois,
are greatly admired. They are beauw
tifully illustrated in traceries of gold
oxides by martial scenes taken from
the earliest history of Japan, and as
articles of vartu are very . valuable.
The Jaccard Company are fo be con
gratulated on tho exhibit niade here,
and during the earlier days of the
exposition it appeared ashough the
enormous outlay and the heavy draft
on their stock had been made for
naught, but under the present im
proved condition of things the value
of their display is being properly ap
predated.
While sneaking on this subject, it
would be well to show what moral
influence the Southern woman exerts
in her proper ephere, as demonstra
ted incident to General Sherman's
visit here on Tuesday. It is a res
markable fact that while the male
natives have ceased to bear animosi
ty towards the grim old warrier who
left a black souvenir in Georgia
"forty miles wide and three hun
dred long," the women, on the cont
trary, will never forget that Sher
man burned their homes, and they
uniformly refuse to regard him as
anything else than an invader and
despoiler. Speaking to some South
ern ladiea about Sherman, a few
days ago, they 6aid they would
never forget him, and they would
not permit him to be feted here if
j they could prevent it.
" Why," said one, when he came
South before and was feasted here,
there were women at the banquet
table who wished every drink he took
could be transformed into poison ;
and others, while lending their pres
ence as a matter of necessity, hid
beneath the guise of politeness a
hatred which boded no good for the
destroyer of their homes." I have
found that this sentiment s ill exists
here very largely among the women
of Georgia, and if report be correct,
it was a potential agency in inrlu.
encing a change of programme on
Tuesday. A committee of citizens
proposed to hoor the General of
the Army with a banquet but cur
rent rumor haa it that the members
of the committee were informed that
it would be distasteful to some, and
Mhat a number of ladies visited a
merchant who was on the committee
and warned him not to give the ban
quet or they would withdraw their

ceived as his rank and position de
serve. Charleston Races.
