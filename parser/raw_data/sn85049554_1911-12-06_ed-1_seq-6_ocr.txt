THE WAR IN CHINA.
China has obviously forgotten, if it
the maxim, "In time of
peace prepare for war."
An empire like China without a ple
thoric treasury, a large and efficient
.standing army and navy, competent
I leadersip and cohesion of its citizen
ship, is inherently weak by sheer force
of numberB as well as for these vital
causes.
China demonstrated her utter Ina
bility to cope with any power of im
portance in her war with Japan some
years ago. She lost a large slice of
exceedingly valuable territory as a re
sult of the struggle betweerv'Russla and
Japan, her unpreparedness rendering
her powerless to prevent it. And now
that an internicin« war has broken out
the empire quivers on the verge of
hopeless disruption and endless strife.
The revolutionary element evidently
has little advantage over the Imperial
party except In point of numbers and
an apparently worthy cause. It Is lack
at strong leadership, cohesive force
and funds Is greater than that of the
government, hence tha uncertainty of
the result.
The situation in China is particular
ly deplored among the more civilised
nations by reason of the fact that their
missionary efforts are so tremendous
ly handicapped by the hostile attitude
of the country. Safety of the mission
aries and other foreigners is promis
ed but it Is by no means assured an«l

shall be restored. But the prospects
for peace, that will give any Assur

at this time.
There is a momentous lesson for
China in the present trouble and its
cause, but whether the empire will
heed it and benefit by it is an unan
swerable question now, for it is a per-
verse nation and as changeable as the

but in so doing he sought, with his
recognized legal ability and the $195,

carriage of justice and prostitute the
very courts which labor has been
prone to criticise. His motives, as he
admits, may be misunderstood. Wheth

pressed indignation against its be
trayal by the McN'amara lawyer. The
necks of a dozen dynamiters are not
worth the price organized workmen
have been compelled to pay in their
effort to escape responsibility for the
deplorable Los Angeles tragedy.
The state board of health has doub
less sounded a timely warning to the
people of Iowa against the spread of
plague by rats, mice ajid ground squir
rels and has asked that the little pests
be exterminated.
The issuance of the bulletin follows
a similar action by the state board of
California, which has declared that an
epidemic of the bubonic plague and of
leprosy may be spread by small ani
mals. This conclusion was reached
following examinations of the ani
mals for symptoms of the disease.

IOWA OPINION AND NOTES.
"The stumbling of J. P. Morgan, the
railroad and financial magnate, in
church has jarred the newspaper world.
Really, what was there so astounding?"
asks the Inter-County Journal, "about
the fact that the man who has walked
over hundreds of railroads and thou
sands of other great enterprises with
out once tripping should stumble in a
church edifice when his only financial
ballast was paltry church contribu
tion."
"According to the count kept by an
Indianapolis man. for every newspaper
article on edible mushrooms have been
five autopsies," says the Indlanola
Record.

principal contention was that over the
custody of their one child and four bull
terriers," says the Inter-County Jour
nal. "The wife is sorely grieved over
the inhumanity of the judge's decis
ion which gave her the child and one
dog, the other three dogs being given
her husband. If those given her hus
band could speak doubtless they would
protest at the loss of the wife's tender
care."
'Speaking or Standpatters,' as the
Knoxville Journal usually does, your
Uncle Tama Jim Wilson, secretary of
agriculture since the memory of man

'What in the world is all this row
in Des Moines politics about?" asks the
Washington Democrat. "We supposed
that the commission plan had made
everything lovely and that there would

"A member of the lower house of

"The editors, who a month ago were

now greatly disturbed by the fear that

declares the Knoxville Journal. "They

PERPBTUA-L CHRIST MA®.
A Olft That Repeats Itself tvery Day
to the Extent of Complete Library.
The dally Times-Republican makes
an Ideal Christmas present to give to
anyone because it repeats itself day
by day thruout the year. At the end
of the year It will have delivered for
a few dollars interesting reading equal
in volume to 326 ordinary library
books such as retail at $1.50 per vol

There would be at least elghten good

the Times-Republican.
Outside Point of View
other people are. The Pharisee said
something we can literally repeat with
a devout and sincere feeling. It's a
pleading for all to realize what they
have to be thankful for—In comparing
oui1 lot. circumstances and environ
ment with that of others. If the whole
world would adopt this doctrine the
word envy would soon be obsolete. And
the idea advanced here, does not in
clude pride or Phariseeism. It is to be
really and truly thankful we are not so
bad off In many ways as we might be,
and not in any particular as bad off as
some others. Our friends, the Chris
tian Scientists, have a good thing in
their creed which prevents some from
realizing or feeling pains and aches
which the human body is heir to. The
doctrine preached in this creed. If
adopted will prevent many having a
mental condition that is harder to hear,
than any bodily disease. It Is only
when we get in close touch with others
that we realize that discontent is the
rule and not the exception. Such per
sons may not admit their envious
thoughts, much less express them, but
envy occupies much more time and
space in the mental make-up of the
average person than thankfulness.
Such persons can not be forced to In
dulge in a thankful spirit for what they
have and enjoy, but they can be forced
to admit many are worse off. We can
make them say they are thankful they
are not as other men are.
Now no sermon has any effect unless
It is practiced. Illustrations are a nec
essary part of all sermons, so let us
take up the question of money, which
is the god we more, or less worship.
Suppose we start with Rockefeller, the
richest man In the world. We can all
understand why he enjoys his Thanks
giving sermon, but today many a sec
tion man on many a railroad, has more
to be thankful for than John D. Rocke
feller. The section man living and
supporting a family on $1.40 a day, has
many things John D. has not. Things
Mr. Rockefeller would give millions for.
Is there a sectloi mgg liAhe United
States today who~wowld accept a mir
aculous change and be John D. Rocke
feller tomorrow morning? Unques
tionably the section man wonld like
some: of the millions/1 but would he
trade even, trade the section man Into
the multimillionaire, if some fairy was
ready to do the act.
Xow suppose we look into Mr. Rock
feller's case. He has troubles of his
own. That stomach,, that bald head,
those years bringing him closer every
Thanksgiving to th* fljmraon lot of all
manhind. those magazine articles, the
newspaper squibs, those words "tainted
money," and surely the skeleton In
every closet, in the rich or poor man's
house, what has he to be thankful for?
Much In comparison. He's alive, that's
cne thing, he knows.qf several rich
men who left this world since last
Thanksgiving. He can play golf, some
his rich friends have the gout and
heumatism. He has some children he
is proud of, other rich men have dis

politician, realizes that the country Is

because of his veto of the "pop gun

THE TRAGEDY QUEEN.
[.Mason City Times].
It Is now reported that Mrs. Ger
trude Patterson, just cleared from the
murder charge in Denver, Colorado,
will endeavor to go upon the stage.
Stating that she had always wished to
be an actress and now that she had
the opportunity she believed that she
would avail herself of the opportunity
this alleged beautiful woman, Just out
of the shadow of the gallows, with the
blood of her husband acknowledged to
be upon her hands, hastens to Inform
the public that she will entertain it
from behind the footlights.
Tho cleared by a Jury of murder, the
fact remains that this woman shot to
death the man that called her wife,
and after living with him for years as
his life companion, she found it neces
sary to seek and obtain a quarrel, and
while he was In the act of further
abusing her, shot him down. With his
blood upon her hands, with the terrible
knowledge of the awful tragedy still
preying upon her mind, it would seem
that this woman would have exjerlenc
ed enough of tragedy for the rest of
her life. The schemes of such public
characters, to profit by notoriety gain
ed by escape from the gallows, should
be frowned upon by the public, and
killed In their Inclplency. Rather than
planning on a life on the stage this
woman ought to be thanking God, and
a sympathizing Jury, for her freedom
and liberty to live.
NOW IS THE TIME TO DECIDE.
[Mason City Times],
The policy of silence pursued by so
large a number of our congressmen,
and political leaders in Iowa, as re
gards Taft amd LaFollette, and their
aspiration for the presidential nomina
tion, Is becoming the more remarked
as time progresses. Where, in former
years, it was the usual thing for the
representatives of the people to whom
the people naturally look for opinions
upon public matters, and in whom
they supposedly hav# great confidence,
to speak out plainly upon such topics
and show the people that they have
ideas, and explain to them where they
stand, this year a density of silence pre
vails that would rival the stillness of a
deaf and dtimb asylum. If a congress
man or senator is for President Taft,
and the principles he stands for, or if
he favors Robert IiaFollette and the
governmental policies which he rep
esents, Is consistent, has the wellfare
his country at heart and Is not
thinking of his own selfish affairs, his
re-election or the size of federal pie
that he will be able to command, he
should speak up and let his constit
uents know where he stands. He
hould make an active, aggressive fight,
for the man and policy he approves.
Any other course marks him as a
pawn. Insincere, and afraid to call his
soul his own.
OTTOSEN MAY RUN.
[Bode Bugle.]
While prospective candidates for
governor and other state officers are
frequently mentioned by the dally pa
pers thruout the state, but little is be
ing said about the office of railroad
commissioner, or the possible succes
sor to N. 9. Ketchum.
The office of railroad commissioner
one of the most Important to be
filled In the state and we feel it our
duty to call the attention of the peo
ole to this office and the possible can
didacy of Chris Ottosen for railroad
commissioner.
Chris was one of the candidates for
railroad commissioner at the last pri
mary, but was not successful. Not so
much for any personal weakness, but
conditions were such that merit alone
could not win at that time. Certain
strong Interests favored the selection
of Colonel Palmer, while the Corn Belt
and iMeat Producers' Association were
strongly behind the candidacy of Clif
ford Thorne, which resulted in the
selection of the two commissioners
from the same town.
We think It about time (If men are
equal) that western Iowa be repre
sented on the board, and we know of
no one that would be more acceptable
to the people than Chris Ottosen of
Ottoaen, Iowa. We feel sure of at
least two things, should he become a
member of the board. He would do
what was right and he would be right
more times than he would be wrong,
and further we would say give him a
chance and you will not regret it.
A Saving to Remember.
"I met William Dean Howells In
Paris last month," said a New York
poet. "Mr. Howells Is as kind and

Is it aqutuidered? That Is the ques
tion whlolt B. N. Clark asks In Success
ful Farming, and proceeds to partially
answer his own question.
The muckrakers have recently given
us so much expose llteratjire that •'Old
General IPubllc" 'has learned that many
of his trusted officials who collect,
handle and spend public funds have
ulterior motives which are not com
mensurate with economy.
Very often when the average man
reads "public funds" he thinks "graft."
When I started out to gather data for
this article I was prejudiced in favor
of the tax payer. When I read "Ia It
Squandered?" Ithought yes was the
answer, and began to search for evi
dence to substantltae my biased con
victlou. "Old !Uidy Prejudice" plays an
important part In forming the average
man's notions and beliefs regarding
public officials and'public funds.
The editor commissioned me to
look into the matter of county bridge
building and find out if there was any
crooked work going on. I looked and
found many crooked bridges that had
been built by contractors who were on
the square. When I started on my
quest for Information I was obliged
to cross a bridge—a six-span solid con
crete structure that cost the taxpayers
of Polk county several thousand dol
lars. And as my mind as well as my
body was upon bridges, I made some
observations which tilted my mind and
threw "Old Lady Prejudice" off her
balance. I hope she fell in the river.
Be that as It may, the bridge I was
crossing was not only a beautiful and
substantially built structure, but also a
necessity, and the money that was
spent to build it was not squandered.
Xor Is all your tax money squandered.
I decided to be truthful In my nar
rative and only state facts that could
be proven by substantial evidence,
shall not burden my article with fig
ures, dates, names, exact locations, etc.,
nor any technicalities which might be
juggled and disputed by unscrupulous
contractors.
In searching for bridge facts I de
cided not to cross any bridges until
came to them, but I came to bridges In
Cedar county, Iowa, that were so di
lapidated and rotton, that they would
not bear my deight (135 pounds),
could not cross them when I got to
them. Bridges paid for with good tax
money that were so faulty In construc
tion that they collapsed with the first
high wat«.
I foun bridges that have never been
crossed by a horse or wagon—several
of them—bridges, the AOOTS of which
were covered with weeds growing out
of the untrodden soil deposited by the
wind, bridges built where there is not,
nor ever were roads connecting with
them—isolated and useless structures
of wood, steel and concrete: useless in
every sense except as object lessons to
teach the tax-payers that the great god
graft is still in their midst.
One of the best, constructed bridges
that I crossed—a splendid example of
masonry, paid for out of the public
funds of Polk county—led to the pri
vate grounds of an Influential farmer at
the termination of a road not more
than a half mile long. The bridge was
apparently built for his exclusive use.
Your tax money—Is it squandered? In
some cases it is not only squandered
but stolen.
In Harrison county, Iowa, I stood on
a bridge ta midnight, and at thta late
hour I could tell from the way it rattled
that It was a "king-bolt" bridge. The
specifications for that same bridge
stated plainly and emphatically that
tho joints shoudl be steel-Tive-ted. A
steel-riveted bridge Is practically as
solid as if the entire structure was one
piece of steel, while a '"king-bolt"
bridge is anything but solid. I found
many cases In Iowa where the terms of
the specifications had been violated by
contractors and pin-connected bridges
substituted for riveted work.
The commonest form of graft In
bridght building is that of charging and
collecting exorbitant prices for extras
in the way of material and repairs.
This common petty grafting would not
be possible if all supervisors were
thoroughly honest. When a supervisor
allows a man $25 for naUing two cross
beams onto some piling the supervisor
knows some one Is grafting.
There are several counties In the
state of Iowa that are referred to by
bridge contractor as "S—farms," a term
that means a district in which one
bridge-bulldlng firm has a sure thing
when it comes to procuring bridge con
tracts. All other concerns know that 't
would be useless to bid on bridge work
in a county known as an "S farm."
Most of the "S farms" are non
competitive counties. A foreman who
.has bossed many bridge Jobs In Iowa
remarked to the writer that he would
rather have the yearly contracts In one
particular non-competitive ("S—
farm") county than the yearly co
tracts of all the competitive counties
in the state, meaning, of course, that
the profit to the favored contractor In
non-competltlve county Is greater
than In competitive counties.
There are tricks in the trade of
bridge building as in all others. I
earned of a case where the supervls
advertised that bids would be
opened on. "Wednesday the 9th." It
happened that the 9th day of the month
did not fall on a Wednesday, but the
contractor with the "pull" had his bid

A few days ago a county supervisor
hinted to me that couM get some In
teresting data for my story by finding
out who paid the hotel hills at the last
state convention of county supervisors.
1 took the hint and found Out. But
neither tbe name of nor the generous
man himself interests the writs*,
but the fact that one bridge, contractor
paid the hotel bills of the oounty su
pervisors Is Interesting. JUsO the fact
thta he paid the rent for several cot
tages at a nearby summer resort and
hired cooks to serve the Occupants who
were county supervisors.
Is it squandered? that is the question.
Believe me, Mr. Taxpayer, much Of It
Is. And the squandering will continue
as long as you elect supervisors that
will allow themselves to be bribed by
unscrupulous contractors. If your tax ..
money la squandered it is because you
are Indifferent as to the character of

When a real capable brother ffciinsr
announces himself as candidate for su- jai
pervisor or any public office a lot of
farmers Insinuate that he Is after the
place for his own personal gain. It Is
this that makes a good, capable, clean
man hesitate before throwing himself
into the breaeh in behalf of the public
interests and serve his country or his
county in a capable manner as a public
official. He has no seed for the paltry
(4 a day allowed to supervisors. If he
serves at all It is because of Ms pub
lic spirit, his prlele In his home county
and he sacrifices his good name, his
peace, his own business that the graft
er and the incompetent may be driven,
hence.
But he is the man the voters ham
their knives out for! They vote for the

Potato Epidemioe. i.
"There are contagious diseases and
epidemics among potatoes and beans
the same as among men and horses
and In England farmers are fined for
not reporting potato or bean maladies
to the authorities, Just as doctors are
fined for not reporting diphtheria or ty
phoid."
The speaker, an intensive farmer, de
scended from the seat of his automobile
plow, and took a clgaret from his gold
case, and resumed:
"Potatoes, for example, are liable to
black scab. Suppose a farmer puts
black scab potatoes on the market.
Then the small ones go for seed, and-*
since heredity governs potatoes as
governs men—from these black scab
father and mother potatoes black scab
little ones are born.
"To prevent that propagation of dis
eased potatoes the English farmer Is
fined $10 and costs whenever he toils
to notify the government that he's sot
diseased potatoes on hand. It's
grand good tiring.
"A grand good thing," repeated the
intensive farmer, as, blowing clouds of
fragrant smoke,' he mounted his superb
electric plow again. "The world's
agricultural departments will in t)(U
way stamp out potato epidemics, bean
diseases, grape plagues and so on. Just
as animal research has stamped out
cholera, yellow fever and smallpox."
