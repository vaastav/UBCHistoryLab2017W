DEPAUTKEST BUILDING
S Tho compction of the new

is urgently needed and estimates for
continuing its construction are
especially recommended The col
lections of books specimens and re

museum and library are of national
importance The library now con
tains about 51500 volumes and 57
000 pamphlets relating to medicine
surgery and allied topica Toe con
tents of tbe army medical mueum
consist of 22000 specimens Their
destruction would be an irreparable
loss not only to the United States
but to the world There are fled in
the record a dupsnsary division over
16000 bound volunua of hospital
records together with a great quantity
of papers embracing original record
01 the hospitals of our armies during
the civil war Asido from their
historical value these records are
daily searched for evidence needed
in the settlement ot large num

for the protection of government

as well sa for the benefit I
of honest claimants These valuable
collections are now in 0 building
which is peculiarly exposed to the

therefore earnestly recommended

ALASKA
Tho recommendation of the secre
tary of the navy that provision be
made for the establishment of some
form of civil government for the
people of Alaska i < approved At
the present there is no protection of
persons or property in that territory
except such as is offered by officers
of the United States ship Jamestown
This vessel was dispatched t Sitka
bsciusa of the fear that without the
immediate presence of national autho
rity there was impending danger of
anarchy The steps taken to restore
order have bean accepted in good
faith by both white and Indian in
habitant mid tho necessity for the
m Oi of restraint does not in my
Opinion now exist II however the
Jamettotcn should b withdrawn
leaving our people as at present
without the ordinary judicial and
administrative authority of organized
local gore ninent serious conse
quences might ensue The laws
provide only for the collection of
revenue protertba of public prop
erty and tbo transmission of mails
The problem is to apply local rue I
for a population so scattered and
peculiar in its origin and con
dition The natives are re
ported to be tractable and
1 prtej ctbla self
supporting and i properly instructed
doubtless wonli advance rapidly in
civilization and I new factor of pros
I perity would b added to the national
life I therefore recommend
le remmend requi
site legislation upon this subject
r Toe secretary of tho navy baa taken
etepa towards the establishment of
M naval coaling stations at theIsthmus
J of Panama to meet the requirement
f of our commercial relations with
i Central and South America which
are rapidly growing in importance
M Locations eminently suitable both as
I regards our naval purposes and the
I i ages of commerce have been selected
one on tho cast side of the Isthmus

54 Sea and the other on tho Pacific et
the Bay of Golfito

4 harbors sufficiently commodious on

POST OFFICE DEPAETMENT
The report of the postmaster
general exmbits a continual growth
nd high state of efficiency of the
I postal service Tbe operations of no
department of government perhaps
represent with greater exactness the
increase of the population and busi
ness of the country In laW the
postal receipts were 8518067 in
1880 the receipts were 33315479
All tbe inhabitants of the country are
directly and personally interested in
naving proper mail facilities and
naturally watch the poitofSoe very
elosely This careful oversight on
he part of the people baa proved a
Constant atimuloaa to improvement
During the putt year there was an
increase of 2134 pcetofhces and
the mal routes were extended
27177 miles making an additional
mnual transportation of 10804191
Tiiles The revenues of tbe postal
lervtce for the enduing year arc estimated
mated at 38 845174 and expendi
tures at 42475932 leaving a deficiency
ciency to be appropriated out of the
treasury of 630757 The universal
postal union has received the approved
of almost all the countries and
colonies of the world maintaining an
organized postal service and it is
cocflJently expected that all the
countries and colonies now outside of
tne union will coon unite herewith
thus realizing the grand idea and aim
of the founders of the union of
forming for tne purpose of inter
national mail cotnmunicatian a
single postal territory embracing the
world with a complete uniformity of
postal charges and conditions of inter
national exchange for 1 descriptions
aud correspondence To enable the
United States to do its full shares of
this gieat work additional legis
lation is asked by the postmaster
general to whose recommendation
etpecial attention is called The lug
elton of the postmaster general
that i would be wile to Encourage by
appropriate Segiilation tho establish
ment of American lines of steamers
Ameroan seamers
by our own citizens to carry mails
between our own ports and those of
Mexico Central America South
America and of trans Pacific coun
tries ia i commended to the serious
eerous
consideration of f Congress The at
tention of Congress is also invited to
tbe suggestion of tho postmaster
general in regard to postal savings
TEDEEAL COURTS
Tho necessity for additional provi
sions to aid in the transaction of the
buninetc of federal courts becomes
each year more apparent The
dockets of the Supreme Court and of
tbo circut court in the greater num
ber of the circuits are encumbered
with the constant accessions of cases
In the former curt and in many
instances in the circuit courts years
intervene before it ia practicable to
bring cases to a hearing The at
torneygeneral recom mends the es
tablishment of an intermediate court
of errors and appeals I is recom
mended that tbe number of judges of
tbe circut court in each circuit with
the exception of tbe second circuit
should be increased bj the additions
of another judge in the tocond circuit
that two should ba added and that
intermediate appellate courts should
be formed in each circuit to consist
of the circuit judge and circuit jus
tice and that in the event of the ab
sence ol either of these judges the
place of the absent judge should be
supplied by the judge of one of
the district courts in the circuit
Such appellate court could be
safely invested with Urge jurisdiction
onri ifa roiinn nlr tl itn

in many cases where appeals would i
still be allowed to thoSuprome Court
The expense incurred for this inter
mediate court will require a vary
aoderAte increase ot the appropria
tions for the expenses of the depart
ment of justice This recommenda
tion is commended to tbe careful con
sideration of Congress I is evident
that the delay of justice iu many in
stances oppressive and disastrous to
Euitoranow necessarily occurs in Fed

ISDIAK AFFAIRS
The report of the secretary of the
interior presents an elaborate account
to tho operations of that department
during tbe past year It lves me
re plensuro to say that our Indian
8f irs appear to be in a more hopeful
condition now then over before The
Indians have made gratifying prog
ress in agriculture herding and me
chanical pursuits Many nho were
a few year ago in hostile conflict
with tbe government are quietly Bat
tling down on farms where they hope
to make their permanent hornet
and are building houses and
are engaging in the occupations
of civilized life The introduction of
freighting among them has been re
markably fruitful of good results in
giving many of them congenial and
remunerative employment and in
stimulating their ambition to eRr
their own support Their honeety
fidelity and efficiency as carriers are
uiphlj praised The organization of
a police force of Indians bai been
I
equally successful in maintaining law
aud order on the reservttion and in
exercisidg a wholesome moral icflu
euca among the Indians themselves
I concur with the secretary of the
interior in the recommendation that
the pay of this force be increased a p
an inducement to tbe bt class of
yonnjj men to enter it Much care
and attention has ben devoted to the
enlargement of the educational facil
ities of the Indians The means
available for this important object
have been very inadequate A fWjad
dittonalborirding schools a the Indian
agency have bern established and the
erection of buildings begun for several
more but an increased appropriation
or this interesting undrit king i
greatly needed to accommodate the
large number of Indian children of
school age The number offered by
their parents from all parts of the
runty for education in government
schools is murh larger than can be
accommodated with the means n
present available for that
Ivni ths purpose
The number Indian
pupils at the
Normal School at Hampton Va
under the direction of Gen Arm
strong has been considerably in
creased and their progress is highly
encouraging The Indian school es
tablished by the interior department
in 1879 at Carlisle Penn under the
direction of Captain Pratt has ben
successful I has now nearly 200
pupils of both seses representing the
great variety of lives l cut of the
Becky Mountains The pupils in
both these institutions receive not
not only an elementary English edu
cation but are instructed in house
work agricultural and useful me
chanical pursuits A similar school
was established this year at
Forest Giove Oregon for the edu
cation of tee Indian youth oa
the Pacific Coait In addi
tion fo this thirtysix Indian boys
and girls were selected from the east
ern Cerobecs and placed in board
ing schools in North Carolina where
they aro to receive an elementary
English education and training in
industrial pursuits The interest
shown by Indian parents even among
the so called wild tribes in the educa
tion of their children is very gratify
ing and gives promise that the results j
accomplished by the cHarta now
I
making will be of lasting benefit
Tbe expenses of Indian education
have so far been drawn from the per
manent civilization fund at the dis
posal of the department of the interior
poa
rior but the fund is now eo much
reduced that a continuance ot this
bentficial work will in future be de
pendent on a specific appropriation
by Congress for the purpose and I
venture to express the hope that Con
gress will not permit institutions BO
fruitful of good results to perish for
want of means for their support On
tbe contrary an increase of the
number of euch schools ap
pears to me highly advisable
The past year baa been unusually free
from disturbances aoaong the Indian
tribes An agreement has been
made witi the Utes by which they
surrender their large reservation in
Colorado in consideration ot an an
nuity to be paid them and agree to
settle in severity on certain lands
designated for that purpose as
farmers holding individual titles to
their lands in tea simple inalienable
for a certain period In this way r
costly Indian wr baa been avoided
which at one time seemed imminent
and for the first time in the history of
the country tm Indian nation has
given up its tribal existence to settle
m severally and live as individuals
under the c mon protection of the
laws of the country Tbe conduct of
the Indiana tbrougout the country
during the past year with but few
noteworthy exceptions has been or
derly and peaceful The guerilla war
fare carried on for two years by Vic
torio and his band of Southern
Apaches has virtually come to
end by the death of that chief
and moat of his followers on
Mexican soil The disturbances
caused on our northern frontier by
Sitting Bull and his men who had
taken refuge in the British domin
ions are also likely to cease A large
majority of his followers have surren
dered to our military forces and tbe
mitary
remainder arc apparently in a state I I
of disintegration I concur with the
secretary of the interior in expressing
the earnest hope that congress will
before the close of the session take
favorable action on the bill providing
for the allotment ot lands on different
reservations in toveralty to Indians
with patents conferring a fee simple
title inalienable for a certain period
and the eventual disposition of the
residue of the reservations for general
settlement with the consent and for
the ben ¼ fit of the Indians placing
the latter under the equal protection
of the laws of the country Thi
method together with a vigorous
prosecution ofour educational efforts
will work 1 most important and et
fectic advance toward the tolution
of the Indian problem and in pre
paring for the gradual incorporation
of oar Indian population into tbe great 1
body ot agrarian citizcnsahip I
PUBLIC LANDS
A largo increase is reported in the 1
disposal of public lands for settle
ment during the past year which I
marks tbe prosperous growth of our
agricultural industry and a vigorous i
movement cf the population toward
our unoccupied land As this move
ment proceeds the codification of our
land laws I a well as proper legislation
to regulate the disposition of public
Undsbecome of more pressing neces
sity and I therefore invite considara
tion of Congress to the report and tbe
accompanying draft of a bill made
by the public lands commission which
were communicated by mo tj Con
gress at the list I session Early ac
tion upon this important subject is
highly desirable
TIMBER LANDS
The attention of Congress is again
asked to the wasteful depredations
committed on our public timber lands
and the rapid and indiscriminate de
struction of or forests Urgent ne
occuLT for legislation t the end that
this may be prevented it i now gener
ally recognized in view of the lawless
character ot the depredations com
mitted and the ditaitrons conse
quences which will inevitably
follow their continuance Legis
lation again and again has been
recommended to arrest the evil and
preserve for tho people of our western
states and territories the timber
needed for domestic and other pur
poses
GEOLOGICAL AND MINERAL SURVL
The report of the director ol geo
logical 1 surveys is a document of un
usual interest The consolidation
of the various geological and geo
graphiccal turvojc rod exploring
enterpriaS each of which has here
tofore operated upon an independent
plan without concert cannot fail r
be of great benefit to all those indus
dustries of ha country which de
pend upon the development of our
mineral resources Toe labors of the
scientific men ot recognized merit
who compose the corps of geological
survey during the first season of their
field operations and inquiries appear
to have been very comprehensive and
will soon b3 communicated to Con
ercsi in a number of volumes Ibe
director of surveys recommends that
the investigations carried on by his
bureau which so far has been con
fined 10 the gocalled public
land Elates and territories be
extended over the entire coun
eotre
try and that the necessary
appropriation be made for this
purpose This would be particularly
beneficial to iron coal and to the
other mining interests of the Missia
eippi valley and of the eastern nd
southern states The subject is com
mended to the careful consideration
of Congress
PUBLIC BUILDINGS
Toe secretary of the interior ache
attention to the want of room in the I
public building of tho capital now i
existing and iu progress 01 construc I
tion tor the accommodation of tbo I
clerical force employed on tho public
record Necessity has compelled
the renting of private buildings in I 1
different parts of the city for the lo J
cation of public offices for which a
large amount of rent is annually
paid while tho separation of offices
belonging to the sme depart
ment impedes the trans
action of current businosr The B C
retary suggests that the block sur
rounding Lafayatte Square on the east
north and west be purchased as a site
for 1 new edifice for the accommoda I
tion of government office leaving
the square itself intact and that if
such buildings were constructed upon
an harmonious plan of architecture
they would add very much to the
beauty of the national capitol and
would together with the treasury and
now Bttttv navy and war department
buildings form one of the meet im
world posing groups of public edifices in the
TEA AND SUGAR
The commissioner of agriculture
expresses the confident belief that his
eflorts in behalf the production of i
our own sugar and tea have been en I
couragingly rewarded The impoit
ance of the results attained have at
tracted marked attention at home
and have received special considera
tion from foreign notions The EUC
cesaful cultivation of our own tea and
the manufacture of our own sugar
would make a difference of many
millions of dollars annually in the
e 1th of the nation
CATTLE DISEASE
The commissioner ak altenI
ton particularly to the conj I
tinned prevalence of infectious
and contagions cattle diseases known
in Europe and ASIA as the cattle
plague or pleuropneumonia A
mid type of this disease in the
present condition of our country is
the occasion of great loss to our
farmers and a serious disturbance to
our trade with Great Britain whicn
furnishes a market for most of our
live stock and dressed meats Tne
value of cattle exported from the
United States for tbo eight month
ended August 31 1880 was more
than 127000000 and nearly double
tbe value for the lame period in 1879
an unexampled increase in tbe ex
port trade Your eirly attention is
solicited to this important matter
PUBLIC AKD INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS
The commissioner of education re
ports a continue increase of public
interest in educational affairs and
that the public schools generally
throughont the country are well cur
tamed Industrial training uattraotint
deserved at cation and colleges or in
struCtion theoretically and practically
in agriculture mechanics and arts
including the govern m ant a hoth I re
oently established for the instruction
of Indian youths are gamingetcadil
in public estimation The commie
eioner aikj special attention to the
depredations committed in the lands
reserved for the future support ol
public instruction aud totbe very
great need of help from the nation
for schools in the territorial end in
tbe southern states Tho recom
inundation heretofore made it re
peated and it is urged that an edu
cational fund be set apart from the
net proceeds of the sales of publio
lands annually the income of ffhich
shall be distributed on some satis
factory plan to the states and territo
ries and the District of Columbia
The ucce3 i of tne public schools ol
tbo District of Columbia and the
progress made under the intelligent
direction of the board of education
and superintendent in supplying tbe
educational requirements of the
district with thoroughly trained and
efficient teachers is very gratifying
SCHOOL lANDS
The acts of Congress from time
to time donating pubLo land
to the several eiatei and territories in
aid of educational interests hue
proved to ba wise measures for pub
lic good reultmv iu great and lasting
benefit It would seem a matter oE
simple justice to extand the beuefii
of Lois legislation the wisdom of
which has been HO fully indicated by
experience to the District of Colum
bia I again commend the general 1
interests of the District ot Columbia
to tbe favorable consideration of Con
gress DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
The fljtird of tbe district as shown
by too report of toe commisdionera
are in I very satisfactory condition
In my annual messages heretofore
and in my special message ot De
cember 15th 1879 I have urged
upon the attention of Congress the
nccesiity of reclaiming the marshes
of toe Potomas adjacent to tbe capi
tel and again I am constrained by
its importance to advert to the sub >
ject Tbejefiiti embrace an area of
eeverl hunrded acres They are
tin impediment to the drain
age of the city and seriously impair
us health I u believed with the
eubjlaatml improvement of the river
front the capital would be in l re
spects one of tbe most attractive
cities in the world Aside from its
permanent population this city is
necessarily tie place of residence ot
persona from every section of the
country engaged in pubic service
Many others reside here temporarily
In thA trAnIrton nf hnairri wiLl
the government It should not ba
forgotten thai the land required nil I
probably be wo th the cost of rr
claiming it and the navigation ol too
river gre < tly improved I therefore
again lilt the attention of Congress
to provide prompt provision for this
muchneeded and too longdeUyed
improvement The water mpply ot
the city is inadequate In addition
to the ordinary ueo throughout the
city the consumption by government
in the navy yard arsenal and
various de artment aud n large
quantity if i required for tho proper
preservation 01 the numerous perks
and the cleansing of sower
I recommend this subject to receive
the early Attention ot Congress and
that in making provision for an in
created Euppiy such means be
adopted as will have In VICW tbe
future groivlh of the city Temporary
expedients for each a purpose cannot
but ba a waste of money and there
fore unwise and a more ample reser
voir with corresponding facilities for
keeping i filled should in my judg
mont be constructed I recommend
again to toe attention of Congress the
subject of the removal from their
present location of the depots at the
several railroads entering the city
and I renew the recommendations of
my former messages in behalf of
the congressional erection of 1 build
ing for a library tbe completion of
the Washington monument and ot
liberal appropriations in support of
