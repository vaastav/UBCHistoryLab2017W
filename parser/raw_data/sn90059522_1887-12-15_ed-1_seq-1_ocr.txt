Fergus Falls, Minn., Dec. ll.— The
supposed cases of leprosy in Otter Tail
ami Wilkin counties have been thor
oughly investigated, and the reports are
given as follows: Christopher Kjono.
living live miles from Kothsay, in
Wilkin county, was born on the island
Proven in the Atlantic ocean, west of
the city of TroiMlhjem, Norway, and
followed the occupation of fisherman.
His mother died, but with no traces of
the disease which afflicts Christopher,
and which has slain his wife and one of
his brothers.' Christopher's father i
still aliv* and is a healthy man and
tree from tlie fearful disease. Christo
pher had no symptoms of leprosy until
about eighteen years old. At that time
appeared the first traces of tills malady.
Small, hard lumps on his eyebrows
were the firsl symptoms. These went
away, but the hair in the eyebrows
dropped out. From this time on the dis
ease, with frequent intervals of rest.
Continued to lake a firmer hold upon
him until he became an inmate of the
government hospital for lepers in
Trondhjem. At the age of thirty, hav
ing an unusually long p jriod of immun
ity from the disease ami supposing him
self healed, In left the hospital, biking
with him a young woman slightly af
fected with the disease and came to
America, where he married the 'eprosy
stricken companion of his voyage, the
laws of Norway forbidding such mar
riages. Although stoutly denied by {':>■
Kjono family, it appears upon the testi
mony of neighbors who visited her dur
ing her last illness and who are well ac
quainted with the disease in itsevery
stage, that the woman died of leprosy.
The greatest misfortune to the man is
that whenever he receives a scratch, cut
or wound
11 sever Ml.AI.s.
Aside from this his skin is perfectly
smooth. The inroads of this form of
leprosy are to be seen in his flattened
nose, sunken mouth, hairless face and
head and destroyed palate. His lingers
are gone to the third joint. This he
claims was done by a circular saw in a
Wisconsin saw mill. Not much cre
el, nee is given to -his statement, as
other cases show the form of mutilation
to be a result of this disease, Chris
topher is an inmate of his brother
Anton Kjono's, house. He had no chil
dren of his own. In his brother's fam
ily are three bright little children.
Neither they nor their parents show any
symptoms of leprosy. Another brother
lives near by, and has a family of live
children upon whom the leprosy has yet
left no signs. Another brother aged
twenty died. He was also a fisher
man on the waters of Trondbjem,
Norway, and died in the state hospital
from leprosy at Trondbjem. In the
same hospital was another patient, who
lives twelve miles west of Fergus Falls,
by the name of Bjorgen Sjcldrup. He
is well known to the Norwegians of
this section, who refer to him when
asked to cite a case of "Spidalsk" in its
last stages.
THE STORY OF Ills CASE
is a repetition of the case of Christo
pher Kjono. The points of difference
are that his wife is still living and
shows no symptoms of leprosy: neitl_.tr
does the child. About three years ago
the wife of Hans Nelson, of Otter Tail
county, died of this disease. The
woman was the mother of three chil
dren, born after their mother was at
tacked by the leprosy, hut the children
are perfectly free from the dread dis
ease, It is nowhere thought to be con
tagions. It is only a matter of dispute
among those of the medical fraternity
who have -ecu the Asiatic form and its
contagious character. People in Nor
way are not isolated. They are not
availed and when they are so far ad
vanced in this disease as logo to the
hospital their friends visit them and
have no fears of contagion. These pa
tients say they never heard of any cases
of leprosy in this country which were
not contracted in Norway. The eating
of fish they regard not as a cause but
as an aggravation of the disease. The
eating of fifth in the hospital is not al
lowed by the physicians.

Special to the Globe.
Ckookstox, Minn.. Dec. 14.— This
was the date set for accepting tilings on
contests from parties desiring to pro
cure lands within the indemnity limits
of the Northern Pacific railroad. The
oflice and hall leading thereto were
filled at an early hour. The train from
St. Paul brought hundreds more. A
majority of these people already occupy
the lands they desire to tile upon, and
have valuable improvements thereon,
and their anxiety in not a few cases is
touching. The closing of the
land office caused a lull in the rush
of applicants, but the different land
attorneys were found "Hobnobbing to

Palls a young attorney named Dave
Williams, and since Mr. Smith's occu
pancy of the register's office he has re
peatedly said he would not let his son

land contests, as the people would
charge him with being partial to
his side of the case. To-day when the
train arrived the greater portion of
those having contests \\ere under the
espionage of Mr. Norby, clerk of the
court of Norman county, and he had
their filing and contest papers all made
out. needing only the signature of an
attorney. This attorney proved to be
Mr. Williams, and he occupied the
government contest room to do his busi
ness, and had free access to the govern
medt office all day. The other attorneys
in the city did not do business enough
to pay them for the trouble they had
taken to prepare for the wotlc. The
local attorneys claim it is a put-up job
between Smith, Williams and Norby.
and the opinion of the business com
munity regardless of politics seems to
lean that way. Mr. Norby claims that
it was no put-up job, but that he came
with his papers prepared in order to
help these poor contestants, and Mr.
Smith informed him they would have to
be signed by a regular attorney. He
recommended Williams; his son-in-law,
and be thought it best not to prejudice

FRIENDS OF IRELAND.

Handsome Reception.
Wasiiino ton. Dec. 14.— At the recep

to-night the hall of the temple was
brilliantly illuminated and decorated
with American and Irish flags, while
such inscriptions as "Scotland, Wales
and Ireland Demand Dome-Rule,"
"American Sympathy is with Ireland,"
"Coercion is an Outrage on the Spirit of
Human Liberty," "Columbia Greets
Gladstone and Parnell,'' ornamented
the stage and walls. Nearly every scat
in the body of the bail was occupied.
It was nearly 8:30 when
the distinguished guests arrived, and
were escorted to seats upon the plat
form, where a large number of senators
and representatives were present to do
them honor. Among them were the
following: Senators Sherman, Palmer
and Hawley; Representatives Collins,
Bland, Herbert, Outhwaite, Foran,
O'Niell, of Missouri; Woodburn, Phe
lan, (rain. Kennedy. Parker, Nutting,
J. 1). Taylor, Yost and Brown, of Ohio,
and Fred Douglass. Mr. Morris Mur
phy, chairman of the committee on ar
rangements, called the meeting to or
der, and said that owing to the unavoid
able absence of Senator Ingalls, who
was to preside, the lirst business was
the election of a permanent
chairman. Representative O'Neill,
of Missouri, proposed Senator Sher
man, and he was elected amid
great cheering. Senator Sherman had
just begun speaking when Senator Ing
alls arrived and was escorted tothe
platform. Senator Sherman, in ack
nowledging the compliment conferred
upon him, was greeted with loud ap
plause and cheers. in appearing here
to-night, he said, he was bound to say
that he was not an Irishman, but the
trouble was that his ancestors had come
to this country so many years ago that
it was absolutely immaterial whether
they were Irish, English, Scotch or
Welsh. He knew one thing— was an
American (applause), and as an Ameri
can, feeling himself free to speak not
only of matters concerning our national
affairs, but also as to the affairs of
friendly nations, he took pleasure in
saying that he believed he spoke the
general voice of the people of tlie
United States in every part of the Union
when he said to the distinguished guests
that
THE SYMPATHY OF AMERICA
went forth fully and heartily in the
strong desire that they might have home
rule in Ireland to the full extent de
manded by Parnell and Gladstone.
[Applause.] Why should not Ireland
have home rule? Americans felt that
they were born to govern themselves
and they had home rule not only in the
nation, but in every pari of their great
organization of states. Our nation,
armed with limited powers, was hut tin.
creature of the people. Everywhere in
our country there was. or ought to be,
free and equal rights and equal
privileges among all the citizens
of the United Slates. [Applause].
He wanted to see Ireland possess
the same rights as those enjoyed
by the people of the United States
(applause) and he believed that in this
sentiment the general voice of the peo
ple went with him. In conclusion Sen
ator Sherman said: "All we want and
all we pray for is that Great Britain
may yield to our Irish brethren what
they desire and give them home rule:
and the British government from that
day forth will be stronger than ever
amid the powers of the world, (Loud
applause.) Now 1 am going,'" he added,
bowing to Senator Ingalls, '"to resign
my oflice to the gentleman who has
come to take my place."
Senator Ingalls. after the applause
with which he was greeted had sub
sided, said two illustrious Irish mem
bers of the British parliament have
crossed the ocean to tell the story of the
wrongs of Ireland. They are here for
the purpose, and, he understood, of
ascertaining the sentiment of the Amer
ican people upon this great question
which is now occupying the attention of
men all over the civilized world, for the
purpose of ascertaining by personal in
spection and examination whether or
not it is true, as the Tories of Great
Britain have said, that the sentiments of
the great mass of the American people
are not with Ireland in her struggle lor
home rule and constitutional liberty,
but that ali these movements are only
the conditions of partisan demagogues
and of obscure politicians for the pur
pose of catching Irish votes. "We have
assembled this evening,"" he said, "in
the shadow of the national capitol for
the purpose of saying, BO far as he could
voice the sentiments of the assemblage",
that the cause of Ireland is the cause of
America (great applause); that in a
deeper and wider sense it is not only
the cause of Ireland, but of humanity
itself. We have assembled for the pur
pose of learning from these two illus
trious representatives of Irish senti
ment what has been the result of
SKVEX CEXTUKIES OF . 'KKSSIOX .
of the Irish people by the governing
classes of Great Britain, and he said,
were he a still more obscure politician
than be was, he should not hesitate to
say that if we are called upon to choose
between expressing our sympathies for
Great Britain or for Ireland in this con
test no American citizen will long hesi
tate as to what his preference shall be.
He did not understand, he said, that
the Irish representatives of home rule
desire to interfere with the unity of the
British empire, but Great -Britain should
•not forget that there is nothing so dan
gerous and so unprofitable as injustice:
Great -Britain should not forget
that seven millions of people
determined to be free can never be en
slaved, Great Britain should not forget
that three millions of citizens in the or
iginal thirteen colonies revolted and
achieved their independence under far
less provocation than the seven million
of Irish people have endured for cen
turies. [Applause.] He did not desire
to trench upon the proprieties of the
occasion on to intrude upon the comity
of nations, but lie should not forget that
a brutal and degraded British soldiery
within the memory or' men who might
now be within the hearing of his voice
had sacked and burned this capital.
He could not forget that in every great
crisis in American history we have
had to contend with the ill
will and malevolence of the governing
classes of Great Britain; that in that
last great struggle for the preservation
of constitutional liberty upon this con
tinent we had the ill-will of the govern
ing classes of Great Britain; that she
consorted with the South and equivo
cated with the North, and contributed
everything short of actual hostility to
secure the downfall of the American
union. In conclusion, he said: "I shall
never cease to remember that during
that awful period there was not a battle
field for American liberty which was
not illustrated by Irish valor and conse
crated by Irish blood." He then intro
duced Sir Arthur O'Connor to the audi
ence, who was received with cheers. In
viewing the large assemblage before
him, he said he was sensible of the
i;i:i:atxi:ss and saceedness
of the cause which he had the honor to
represent. Here in Washington, the
headquarters of freedom— capital of
the grandest and freest community the
world had ever seen— no cause which
was not just and grand and noble could
call forth such a distinguished audi
ence. While the cause of Ireland was
one which enlisted the sympathy of
every liberty-loving heart, which en
joyed the attention of all civilized man
kind, it was in a special manner calcu
lated to draw the attention of many of
the illustrious statesmen who hon
ored his colleague and himself, and hon
ored Ireland by their presence here to
night. [Applause.] Ireland was at
tempting by force of organized public
opinion, by constitutional and peaceful
means to secure the repeal, not of a law,
but of a conquest; It was attempting to
repeal the conquest of Ireland. [Ap
plause.] He was followed by Senator
Hawley, who said the speech of Mr.
O'Connor was a statement of terrible
fact, a terrible argument. Humanity
everywhere would say that he had stated
wrongs which must be remedied. He

these distinguished representatives of
the great Liberal party of the British
empire. His heart was with them.
There was no real American looking at

purpose of that party who could with

He predicted local self-government in
Ireland, and that it would be followed
by local self-government in Scotland,
Wales and perhaps subdivisions of Eng

i EXTENDING HEARTY OBEETIXG
to Messrs. Esmonde and O'Connor; sol
emnly protesting in the name of human
ity against the loiy policy toward Ire
land as beiug subversive of liberty, of
right, of justice, of the freedom of
speech and the freedom of the press,
and declaring that the people of Ireland
may well arraign their oppressors before
the civilized world. In the words of
Thomas Jefferson: "You have de
stroyed the lives of our people with cir
cumstances as cruel and perfidy scarcely
paralleled in the most barbarous ages,
and totally unworthy a civilized nation.
You have quartered large bodies
of troops among us. You
j hove deprived us of the ben
efits of trial by jury. You have
excited domestic insurrection among us,
and deprived us of rights formidable to
tyrants only:" expressing admiration
for and confidence in Parnell and the
Irish parliamentary party; thanking
Mr. Gladstone in behalf erf the Ameri
can people for his course toward Ire
land; pledging financial aid to the Irish
people; sympathizing also with the
English people, who can never have
good government while Ireland has bad
government, and because the action of
the Liberal party has drawn Great
Britain and the United States nearer
together. Telegrams and letters of
• Sympathy with the Irish cause
from Senators Manderson, Kenna,
Blackburn and others were read. Mr.
Esmonde spoke of the encouragement
which this meeting would lend to the
Irish cause. Representative Herbert,
of Alabama, expressed his sympathy
with Ireland. Representative Springer
said he thought we had a hundred years
ago served sufficient notice upon Great
Britain as to our own sentiments on
home rule, but some of her statesmen
had not apparently read that part of
Great Britain's history. Representative
Kennedy, of Ohio, testified to his
hearty sympathy with the cause of Ire
land.
SABIN ON THE SITUATION.
The Senior Minnesota Senator
Pleased With the Outlook.
Special to the Globe.
Washington, Dec. 14.— Asked about
the senate committees, Senator Sabin
said:
"I am exceedingly well pleased with
the committees agreed upon by the Re
publican caucus. 1 was somewhat ap
prehensive that Minnesota might suffer
on the committees by the retirement of
Senator McMillan. Or course every one
knows that I am pleased with my col
league. Senator Davis, but it was not to
be expected that a new senator would
be as well placed upon committees as
one' who had been with us for several
years. However, Senator Davis has
.fared well, and Minnesota has no rea
son to complain of her standing."
"How about the committee on com-
merce?"
"Well. Senator McMillan was chair
man of that important committee, and a
right good man he was for the place,
too. But. fortunately for us all, Sena
tor Sawyer takes a position on that com
mittee, as does also Senator Palmer, of
Michigan. Both of them are part of us
in the Northwest, and will look after
our interests. Senator Sawyer is almost
as good a friend of Minnesota as he
could be were he one of our senators.
Senator Palmer is a broad-gauge states
man,of whom it is more than a pleasure
to speak well. At their hands Minne
sota may expect justice."
"How about the bill for the improve
ment of the Sault Ste. Marie and Hay
Lake channels?"
"I am glad you bring up that subject.
There is nothing that can be introduced
during the present session which will
prove of more interest to the farmers,
mechanics, merchants, and all classes
and conditions of men in Minnesota
and the Northwest than that same bill.
It will be introduced in a few days by
Senator Palmer, of Michigan. We are
all agreed upon working for it, audit
will go through booming,] expect, lt
will he introduced at the same time in
the house, and will go through there,
too, although the usual delays in that
branch' of .'congress will keep it back
•r a few months."
; "It will increase the size of the river
and harbor bill, though, won't it?"
"Not at ail. We intend to make it a
separate bill. {Senator Palmer will ask
for an independent • appropriation of
14,000,000 to commence work on. We
mean business, and will not commence
on a small scale, lt is a great measure i
and deserves to pass. Every man of us I
will demand its passage, and light
lor it."
"You will encounter considerable op
position to that measure, senator. Do
you not expect it."
"There will be no reasonable opposi
tion in either house of congress. The
Hennepin canal people may make an
opposition of some sort, but it will be
the opposition of jealousy, and not a
reasonable opposition. -The Hennepin
is a good scheme, and will not find any
of us objecting to it. probably. But we
do not want the friends of that measure
to stand in our way. The 'Soo' hill is
one which is of vast importance to three
great states at the very least, and it is
approximately of advantage to Dakota,
as well as to New York and New En
gland. The Hennepin bill interests Illi
nois more than any other state, but it is
also of interest to lowa and Wisconsin.
1 am in favor of all legitimate public
improvements for the public weal, and
shall hope to avoid all opposition to
meritorious measures, regardless of sec
tional lines. You may say that lam of
the opinion that the 'Soo' bill will go
through all right, and also that 1 am ex
ceedingly well pleased with Minnesota's
standing in the senate." .
CONGRESSMAN BULLS.
The Well-Known Texan Talks
About Tariff Reform.
Nkw Yokk, Dec. 14.— World's
Washington correspondent has had an
interview with Representative Mills, of
Texas, who will probably be chairman
of the committee of ways and means. ;
He is quoted as saying: "l heartily j
agree with President Cleveland's tariff
ideas, as put forth in his message. While
I believe that an ad valorem tariff is the
only fair and wise measure, still I will
vote for a specific tariff if by that means
1 can get a bill passed reducing taxes."
"Do you think a bill will be passed
by congress reducing the tariff.""
"If congress does its duty it will pass
some measure lowering duties and de
creasing our revenue."
"Do you think there will be much dif
ference of opinion about the bill?"
"Well, there are many interests that
imagine they will le hurt by the lower
duties and helped by the higher ones,
and of course they will be heard from.!
but I hope we may be able to harmon- !
ize these conflicting opinions and pass a •
bill making substantial reductions."
••Will the bill, do you think, pass the j
senate?"
"I cannot tell about that. I am in- '
clined to think some bill will pass the
senate. It may not be what we want, j
and we may quarrel some over it. in a j
legislative way, and then agree on I
something. Constituted as the two |
houses are now. it is hard to predict |
what phase the bill will wear when it i
gets through, if it should succeed at ■
all."
"Do you think the tariff will be the j
issue hi the campaign of lss* - .'"
"There is no doubt of it, and I am j
glad that we have the battle pitched on
it. We can win the fight if we do not ;
get frightened and fly the Held."
"Do you think that any measure af- ,
fecting the tariff that may be passed by '
this congress will make itself felt in the j
country at large in time to have any ef
fect on' the campaign of 1888?"
"If the tariff is lowered considerably, j
and should be passed by the Ist of
April, to take effect June SO, the price
of our exports would go up before the I
bill takes effect, and before November I
the improved condition of agriculture. I
manufactures and commerce will be !
very perceptible."
"Would you reduce or repeal the in
ternal tax on tobacco?"
"No, 1 would not, if I could, pass Ihe
bill by myself ; but I cannot, and 1 shall
have to get the best I can and be con
tent with it. The president has laid
clown in his message the true principles
—tax luxuries high, necessaries of life
low, if taxed at all. People can do with
out tobacco better than they can do
without shirts and shoes."
"The Republicans say the Democrats
are in favor of free trade and mean to
do away with customs."
"That is all silly. We speak of free
trade as we do of free men. Yet free
men have to be taxed to support gov
ernment and so does trade. When we
say free men we mean men who refuse j
to bear unnecessary burdens, and when
we speak, of free trade we mean trade |
stripped**" unnecessary burdens. We ■
have had custom houses and tariffs from j
the beginning and will have them to the
end."
Mr. Mills expressed confidence that a
tariff measure would pass the house
without much debate and that it would
be presented to the senate at an early
day.
THE SENATE.
Faulkner Declared to Have a
Good Title to a Seat.
Washington, Dec. 14.— Mr. Hoar,
from the committee on privileges and
elections, presented a report in the
West Virginia case. He said that the
report was unanimous. The questions
raised were very simple ones and easily
comprehended. One of them had been
long ago determined by the senate, and
he supposed that all senators had had
occasion to reflect on the other, lv
order that the senator entitled to the
seat might enter tit once upon his
duties lie hoped there would be* no ob
jection to having the report disposed of
at present. The report was read
at length. It concludes with
two resolutions, the one de
claring that Daniel IL Lucas is
not entitled to the seat, and the other
declaring that Charles J. Faulkner has
been duly elected senate, from the state
of West* Virginia for the term of six
years, commencing March 4. 18S7, and
is entitled to a seat in the senate as sen
ator. The resolutions were agreed to,
viva voce, and the oath of office was
thereupon administered to Mr. Faulk
ner. Mr. Hoar then moved that Mr.
Faulkner be assigned to the committee
on claims. District of Columbia. Mines
and Mining and Pensions. Agreed to.
The president then sent to the senate
several hundred recess postmaster nom
inations, among them the following:
Daniel A. Mahoney. Kenosha. Wis.:
Albert C. Robinson, Green Bay, Wis.;
John McCarthy. Stillwater. Minn.: L.

New Yore, Dec. 14.— 1n regard to
the president's message, President
Eliot, of Harvard, has written the fol
lowing letter:
"To the Editor of the World : In reply
to your inquiry of the 7th inst., 1 beg to
say that I find President Cleveland's
views on tariff revision and reduction
of the surplus sound economically, sa
gacious politically and thoroughly patri
otic. Very truly yours,

President Bartlett, of Dartmouth,
says:
"To the Editor of the World: As I
am not in politics, except as a voter, it
is hardly worth while for mc to enter on
any criticism of the president's message.
My views are not in accordance with
many of its conclusions nor with the
reasonings by which they are supported.

BALFOUR TALKS.
The Irish Secretary Makes a
Speech at Manchester.
London, Dec. 14.— Mr. Balfour ad
dressed an immense meeting at Man
chester to-night. There was considera
ble disorder at times, and the Irish sec
retary was both hissed and cheered re
peatedly. In consequence of the warn
ing conveyed by the Times' sensational
story of a plot to assassinate Mr. Bal
four the precautions taken by the police
were quite elaborate. Mr. Balfour, in
the course of his speech compared Mr.
Trevelyan to Banyan's "pitiable,"'
who started with Christian on
the right road but falling into
the Slough of Dispond, used violent
language toward bis companion, and
finally returned to the City of Destruc
tion. The Radicals, he said, had
changed not only their old policy, but
their old morality as well, ami even the
foremost separatist showed an increas
ing want, of moral perception. Mr.
Gladstone had been forced to retract
the assertion made at Nottingham
while Mr. Trevelyan talked about the
increase of evictions. The fact was,
that during the first three months of
Mr. Trevclyan's administration as chief
secretary for Ireland there were 855
evictions, while during the same period
of his (Balfour's) tenure there were only
132. In conclusion Balfour predicted
the complete triumph of order under
the government's Irish policy.
"WHAT DAVITT SAY'S.
' The One-Armed Patriot Discredits
j the London Times' Latest Yarn.
London, Dec. 11.— In an interview
; this afternoon concerning the 'limes'
: alleged dynamite revelations, published
! this morning, Michael Davitt said:
••The Times' so-called disclosures were
! made either by its anti-Irish scare de
' partment or somebody in New York
; ambitions to obtain a sensational adver
j tisement. In either case such a scare
) at the present time, when two men, no
mailer whether they be innocent or
I guilty, are awaiting trial in London for
I alleged connection with a dynamite
j conspiracy, was most cowardly. 1 pre
i diet that when the New York inter-
viewers visit the room in Chambers
street to-day and give their impressions
in tomorrow morning's about the place
and its staff of clerks, the fund
of £'200.000 will shrink nearer to
nothing than did Falstaf's men in (buck
ram. There is not a journalist, detect
ive, government official or public man
in New York, or any other American
city, who does not know that Kossa's
whole party cannot command as many
farthings as the Times endows them
with pounds, and any one who has read
the United Irishman within the last six
months, knows that Kossa is engaged in
defending himself against unfounded
charges made by former friends who
have affirmed that he betrayed some
men who are now undergoing long
sentences in England for alleged com
plicity in dynamite operations. Mad as
Bossa is, he Is utterly incapable, in
my opinion, of betraying any
one to the English government.
But that he or his successor controls the
vast sum mentioned by the Times is as
probable as that the unemployed work
ingmen of London have large bank ac
counts, and the plot is about as vision
ary as the fabulous fund with which it
is to be effected. The Times never ad
mits that the dynamiters repudiate the
Parnellites in language equally as
strong and elegant as that of the Times
itself. The Times' daily denunciation
of Mr. Gladstone's policy might he in
spired by one of Kossa's writings, only
the London edition of the New York
anti-Parnellite organ has as yet nothing
of my assassination, as Kossa's paper
did in November. 1_8«, for my attack

of the dynamiters than the writings of
papers like the Times."

D. Hopkins' a young man twenty-eight
years of age, died this morning from
the effects of laudanum, taken last night
at his fashionable boarding house on
West Tenth street, in the presence of
two young women. lie had achieved
considerable notoriety both here ami
in other parts of the country by his
reckless and eccentric conduct, most of
bis exploits being in the nature of the
lavish expenditure of money, He in
herited a large fortune some years ago
and had been conspicuous before the
public ever since. A short time ago ha
went to New York on his way to Eu
rope, and while there had some diffi
culty which gave rise to a widely circu
lated newspaper report that lie had en
gaged at a considerable salary a pugilist
to accompany him on his travels and to
punish any one who gained his ill will.
He had been drinking heavily for sev
eral days before his death. In 1882,
while handling a shotgun, it accidently
exploded and the contents struck his
wife, tearing her bead to pieces. A sin

Mrs. Hopkins was reading the novel "A*
