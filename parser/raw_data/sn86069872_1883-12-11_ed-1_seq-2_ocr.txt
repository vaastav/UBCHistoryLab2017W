hew River and Harbor Recommendation.
Washington, D.ecember 4. The Secretary
of War has adopted a new method of
submitting his. estimates for a River and
Harbor Bill. He recommends the specific
sum of 8,000,000, to be
as Congress may direct. The Engineers'
estimates are simply (presented as
notes of the same which, it is believed by
officers in charge of works can be profitably
expended during the fiscal year. He
recommends $17,500 for examinations and:
surveys at South Pass, Mississippi River;
$5,000 for gauging the waters of the Lower
Mississppi and its tributaries, and $3,000
for gauging the waters of the Columbia
River.
Mahone Defines His Position.
Washington, December 5. Senators
and Riddleberger received invitations
to the caucus of Republican Senators yesterday
similar to those sent to Republicans.
Senator Mahone, speaking of his attitude
toward the Republican party, said he had
no objection to attending the Republican
caucus, and should have attended that yesterday
had he received the invitation
in season. He would not, however,
attend as a member of the caucus
nor vote upon any proposition
before 'it. He held that the thirty-eight
Republican Senators, being a majority
ot the Senate, had a right to its control.
He had no candidates for Senate offices,
and would not attempt to influence nominations.
He had strong preferences, but
should content himself with voting in accordance
with his preferences. Snould he
attend the Republican caucuses it would be'
simply lor conference. He believed his
opinions were shared by Senator
Land-Office Bills in the Senate.
WASHiNGTOXjDeceinber G.-The bills introduced
in the Senate, by Senator Ingalls, repealing
the pre-emption and timber culture
laws, were prepared by the General Land
Office. The proposed repeal of these laws,
which has been recommended by the Land
. Office, by the Secretary of the Interior and
by the President, will undoubtedly be discussed
in both houses of Congress
this winter. A dozen bills
proposing the repeal will be introduced
in the House next Monday. But the
proposition will be stubbornly fought.
Land speculators in the West have organized
a powerful lobby to resist the passage
of repeal legislation. Some of their representatives
are already heie, and are
bringing appliances to bear upon Senators
and upon the Speaker of the House to secure
the appointment of committees which
will smother legislation. It is altogether
probable that a repeal bill will be passed
by the House, but it may be defeated in the
Senate as it was at the last session.
Notes.
Secretary Teller has decided that the
Choctaw and Chickasaw 'Indian nations
have no claims against the Missouri, Kansas
and Texas Road for material furnished
for its construction, as the Indians ware
paid individually.
The following new Postmasters have
been appointed: Rufus Lancaster, Hin.-ton,
Ky.; Samuel Eggleston, Hope Furnace,
O.; Jerome B.- Byers, Mayfield.
Tenn.; Charles C. Stelier, Servia, late New
Madison, Ind.; New offices Benjamin P.
Reed, Wilmot, Stark County, O.
The President will make the Mississippi
River improvement, the Hennepin Canal
and other public works the subject of a
special message to Congress. Reference
to these subjects was omitted from the regular
message with a view of treating them
in detail in supplemental communications.
Representative King, of Louisiana, has
prepared, and will introduce into the
House at the first opportunity, a bill to require
that females emploj'ed by the Government
shall receive a rate of compensation
equal to that allowed males for the
same grade of work.
Doorkeeper Wintersmith, of the House
of Representatives, has appointed John
Ford Thompson, of Harrodsburg, Ky., Superintendent

A Wealthy Carriage Manufacturer Charged
. by His Wife With Forgery.
Houston, Texas, December 6. J. W.
Rose, a wealthy carriage manufacturer,
disappeared last Sunday, and the wife and
her supposed stepson tell the grand jury
that Rose is Cornelius Krum, who, in
Kingston, N. Y., in 1866, committed a heavy
forgery, deserted his wife and two children,
and came to Texas, made money,
and married Mrs. Dagnall, the
He returned to Kingston in
1876, after the charge of forgery was outlawed,
and promised to bring his firat wife
to Texas. Failing to do so, his sou followed
him a few months ago and, threatening-exposure,
Rose shot six times at him!
The son, showing signs of recovery, was
sent to Florida, Rose assuring him his
second wife was only his mistress and at
the same time inducing her to say she did
the shooting. The boy is now at Houston
to compel reparation to his mother, but his
father's whereabouts are unknown.
A Slnjjularly Disastrous Snow Storm.
Denver, OoL., December 6. A snow and
wind storm visited this section last night,
which in disastrous effect is without parallel
in the history of Colorado. The snow
commenced falling at noon and continued
all night. The weatherbeing warm, the snow
attached itself to the telephone wires until
it was two inches in -diameter. At 4 this
morning the wind blew almost a gale,
and in about half an hour 300 poles,
eighteen inches in diameter, were

few serious accidents.
Another Inexplicable Disappearance.
Wheeling, W. Va., December. Friends
of Lettie Yost, daughter of Jacob Yost
living near Carlington, O., a small town

hunting for traces of her. She sudden! v

Own Flight From Homo, I
St. Louis, Mo.juDecember 5. rThe
of Carondelet are terribly incensed at
the doings, of the Rev., Jacob Shlittler, pas
tor of the German Lutheran Church,which
have just come to light. Jacob arrived in
Carondelet eight years ago and gave out
that he was from'Ghica'go. He married a
rich widow named Westerman, and she
had a daughter, a handsome young lady
just budding into womanhood. Shlittlerfor
some time, it appears,hashad his wife completely
under his control. He built an oratory
in his parlor, and three times a day
her daughter was brought in there, where
her spiritual adviser and stepfather pretended
to be praying with her. Supernatural
manifestations reduced Mrs.
Schlittler to a state of practical imbecility.
Annie found the paths qf goodness pleasant
to walk in, and for some months everything
went well. In the middle watches of
the night Schlittler would arise and
call the unfortunate girl to devotions. Her
mother woid applaud the pair and thank
Heaven for such a Musb'and and such a
daughter. A week ago Annie's aunt, a
lady named Alstoroff, called upon the
Shhttlers and at once suspected that something
was wrong. In spite of herself the
girl was seized by her mother and her aunt
and the truth discovered. Finally, getting
free from her aunt, she struck her a blow
in the face which sent her reeling
over a chair, and,, rushing into
the front parlor half clad as
she was, she threw herself into her father's
arms, crying, ''Protect me from mother
and Aunt Alstorolf !" The two women followed
her in, realized the situation at
once, and the mother fell in a dead faint.
The Rev. Jacob, as soon as she was restored,
confessed his crime and begged forgiveness.
Annie followed, confessing, and
asking pardon. The aunt began to denounce
and threaten tar and feathers. A scene followed,
and the wife took the part of
the erring husband and daughter, and
drove her sister from the house. The
latter smothered her rage and held her
own counsel until to-day, when she informed
the authorities. Officers imme
diately set about investigating the matter,
and found that Schlittler and his stepdaughter
had fled the city, Mrs. Schlittler,
strange as it may seem, having consented
to his taking her daughter to Chicago. To
your correspondent she said: "I have still
faith in my husband's purity. He confessed
to me, but said that he must have committed
the crime when in a semi-unconscious
state. God forgives, why should not
I? I love Annie. I love him. He will take
good care of Annie. They will come back
all right." She had just received a letter
from her husband, whose departure for
Chicago was made last "Wednesday. He
writes: "Annie is doing as well as could
be expected. What do people say about us
in Carondelet?" He also says that he and
Annie are staying in Chicago with his sister,
Mrs. Mary Heyder, at No. 45 Mohawk
street.
The Legislature of Virginia.
Richmond, Va., December 5. The General
Assembly met at noon. Both houses
elected Democratic officers. Governor
Cameron's message deals mainly with
State affairs. In the matter of the public
debt he refers at length to the working of
the Riddleberger act, and recommends that
the requirements of the bill be all carried
out by the present Legislature, and
that further legislation be adopted
to increase its effectiveness. The
Governor says an investigation
should be had in relation to the Danville
riot. Witnesses should be allowed to
be made to testify, and the truth
should be made apparent, so that the Commonwealth
of Virginia should be placed
before the world as one of the States which
tries crime, no matter who may be the
criminal. A resolution was introduced in
the Senate calling upon Senator Mahone
to resign. The preamble consists of a
sharp arraignment of the Senator.
National Farmers' Congress.

delegates were present, representing
Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Virginia,
Mississippi, Colorado and Indiana.

The President of the Congress,
Major Thomas J. Hudson, of Lamar, Miss.,
made an address of some length,setting forth
the demands and wants of the agriculturists,
and especially urging the appointment
of the Commissioner of Agriculture
as a member of the President's Cabinet.
"Such officer," he said, "could watch our
foreign relations in respect to this interest,
which must ever be the greatest. Let us,
therefore, form a national body, to teach
farmers their own interest, and to raise a
cry that will reach the Federal Government."
The Congress will be in session
about three days.
The Cotton Gentennial Meeting.
New Orleans, December 6. The board
of managers of the World's Industrial and

and 900 feet wide,- with 1,000,398 square
feet of floor space, including a music
hall in the center, with a seating capacity
for 1:3,000 persons. The design also provides

Samon, the Murderer, Pleads Guilty.
Laconia. N. H., December 6. Samon,
the murderer, was given a hearing to-day.
He appeared nervous. In answer to the
question, "Samon, are you guilty or not
guilty V1 he responded, "Guilty, sir."
He was ordered to remain in jail till
March, when his case will be heard. He
said his confession was true in every respect,
and that he was ready to suffer the
penalty for ,his crime. It is thought the
we'ight on his mind will entirely break
him down, aud cause his death before
March. He eats very little, .but complains
of nothing. There are no chances
for a plea of insanity to be entered in his
casft. -

CABLEGRAMS
The Franco-Chinese Trouble.
Hong Kong, December 4. Eleven hun
dred Chinese troops passed to-day in a
Chinese merchant steamer, on the way
from Shanghai to Canton. More are following.
London, December 4. A Paris dispatch
states that Admiral Courbet, commander
of the French forces in Tonquin, has ordered
an attack upon Sontay, not Bacninh,
to appease the susceptibilities of the Chinese
Government during the negotiations
with France. Bacninh is garrisoned by-Chinese
regulars. Sontay is in the hands
of the Black Flags.
Hong Kong, December 0. Admiral Ping
Yu Ling, who has arrived in Canton, has
publicly notified all foreigners that war is
imminent. He has massed all his available
land and sea forces for the purpose of
protecting Canton, and has warned all neutral
powers that France alone is responsible
for the position of affairs, and for the
war likely to ensue. All the powers are
warned especially to observe tbeii1 treaty
obligations, and informed that their literal
interpretation will be insisted upon.
Hong Kong, December 6. The Government
refuses to withdraw or modify its
claim regarding Tonquin. It prefers war
to the surrender of the Province of France.
Large bodies of troops are continually
passing Hong Kong for the Tonquin border.
Paris, December U. Admiral Courbet
telegraphs, under the date of Hanoi,
November 27, that he is still preparing for
the campaign. La Liberte (newspaper)
says England is taking energetic steps to
bring about a treaty between Fiance and
China. It adds that it has authorized information
which leads to the belief that
peaceful negotiations have made great progress
during the last few days.
English Comment On Arthur's Message.
London, December 5. The Times thinks
President Arthur's message somewhat
colorless, and sees a tribute to the Irish
vote in the language used in regard to
pauper emigrants. The press generally
express disappointment that the President
did not recommend reductions in the tariff
at this session. All, however, refer to the
picture the message presents of the great
prosperity of the United States.
Things Getting Serious in Egypt.
London, December 6. A Kartoum dispatch
says: The mudir of Sernaar telegraphs
that a dervisch entered the bazaar
there Wednesday evening and proclaimed
the annihilation of Hicks Pasha's army
near El Obeid. The dervisch swore
on the Koran that not one Egyptian
soldier was left alive in Kordofan. Five
thousand hearers armed themselves, 500
having Remingtonjrifles, and declared for
El Mahdi. The Mudir asks for instructions.
A Cairo correspondent says the foregoing
is the most serious new3 received since the
report of the destruction of Hicks Pasha's
army. Sernaar is the granary of the Khartoum.
The proceedings at Sernaar may ba
repeated at Khartoum or even at Assouan.
Notes.
Men who have made the journey from El
Obeid to Khartoum since the battle between
the forces of Hicks Pasha and the
False Prophet, say that while there were
large stores and a train of camels taken
back to El Obeid, no prisoners were seen.
They believe the story that the Egyptian
army was entirely annihilated is truef
A London correspondent says
frenzy at the conclusion of his trial
was due to the fact that he was not allowed
to speak, as promised. He failed to hear
the Court Registrar ask him, before his
sentence, whether he had anything to say,
and therefore made no answer. When
Judge Denman, later on, forbade his speaking,
O'Donnell thought he was wronged.
O'Donnell's solicitor is endeavoring to
induce the jury to sign a memorial to the
Home Secretary, asking him to commute
the daath sentence of O'Donnell. Some of
the jurymen are willing to sign the paper,
but it ifrvexpected that the majority will
decline.

The Story of the Loss of the Lake
Boat Manistee.
gXuBrealf 1h,Two and Goes
"' ' due Boat luaiates
. ;4 freeze to Dcatli.
Minneapolis, December 7. A Tribune
special says : Mr. Carlston, of Duluth,
received a letter yesterday from a friend
who was a passenger on the ill-fated Manistee,
of which the following is a synopsis :
"When the boat went out," the letter
goes on to state, "they encountered a very
heavy gale from the southwest, and when
about twenty miles out the boat was put
about, but could not make it and broke in
two. Two lifeboats were taken out, but
before they were launched all but one were
swept away, and only the nine persons
who were in the boat were allowed to get
in, They had a terrible time. After the
steamer went down there was nothing
but a wide expanse of water before them.
They rolled around on the turbulent waters,
cold, wet, and hungry, for three days, and
one by one dropped off, death having come
to their relief: Some of them froze to
death, while some died of sheer exhaustion
and exposure to the wind. They say Capt.
McKay never left the boat, but wrapped
himself up in a heavy overcoat and remarked:
4I will never leave the boat
until the last soul is off; I am Captain
of this boat, and if she is a coffin
for anybody she shall be my coffin.' Alter
the men had left the boat they say
the Manistee made one plunge under
the waves, and that was the last of her.
They report that when they left the boat
there were the crew and ten or eleven passengers
on board, and out of those who
started out in the boat only three we're
saved and reached Houghton. They say
the wreck occurred off Eagle Harbor,
and that there was no possible chance of
saving her under the circumstances. They
say that at last, when everybody saw
there was no hope of saving the boat, Captain
McKay gave his orders just as coolly
and collecteu as if on shore."
Pacific Coast Interests.
Washington, December 7. A meeting of
members of Congress from the Pacific Coast
States was held to-day. There were present
Senators Dolph and Slater, Representatives
George, Rosecrans, Sumner, Glasscock,
Budd, Henly, Tuiley, and
Senator Miller presided. The
object of the meeting was to secure unanimity
among the Pacific Coast Representatives
and Senators in respect to legislation
by this Congress in the interest of
the people of the Pacific Coast, especially
in respect to curing delects in the present
Chinese restriction act. It was known that
several members were preparing bills covering
the matter, but it was lelt by those
calling the meeting that it would be better
to have all Representatives from that section
unite upon a plan of action. The meeting
discussed the evasion of the law by
Chinese immigrants furnished certificates
by Chinese authorities, entitling them to
enter this country as belonging to classes
privileged by the law, and finally agreed
that a bill to remedy the defects of the
present law be prepared and introduced
simultaneously in both houses as the joint
work of the Pacific Coast delegation. A
committee consisting of Senator Dolph, Representatives
Henly and Cassidv, was
appointed to draw up a bill and submit
it to the delegations at a meeting
next week. The meeting discussed
several other matters of local interst,
among them the necessities of the coast in
the matter of river and harbor improvements
and public buildings, but this discussion
was informal and subordinate to
the question of Chinese restriction. Rep
resentative Cassidy, one of the committee
appointed, favors the adoption of a system
oi passports for Chinese immigrants, to be
used by United States Consuls betore the
persons holding them go aboard vessels for
the United States. This was one of tne
features of the ''twenty year" restriction
bill vetoed by President Arthur.

they collected in this manner to exceed
$1,000,000, which they claimed to be

sending to their subscribers from
time to time large dividends upon
their investment. The Federal authorities
exposed the fraud and Flemming fled to
Canada, but was recently arrested in Bismarck,
Dakota. The Merriam of the firm
is supposed to be a myth. Loring was
proven to have had an active connection
with the firm. The indictments were for
fraudulent use of the mails and for obtaining
money under faUe pretenses. The
prisoners were very strongly defended,

such cases $500 and imprisonment at the
discretion ot the Court.

by his old friends unless pointed out
and named. It is believed that Mrs. Merz
