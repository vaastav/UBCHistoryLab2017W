SATURDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1898.
The President’s Message.
President McKinley is a man of large abili
ty and wide experience in public affairs, but
he lacks the one essential iff cessary to great
ness or even to administer the office of Presi
dent in justice to himself or his views upon
matters of state. He lacks courage and firm
ness and has been bullied to action contrary
to his convictions of duty by jingoes and
others, who seem to control his every action.
Mr. McKinley well knew this government
had no right to intermeddle with the internal
affairs of Spain; he knew affairs in Cuba were
no more concern to us than was the massacre
of Christians by Turks in the island of Crete,
against which this government did not even
enter a piotest, and he was slow in acting.
Although spurred on hy jingoes, he was de
termined to avoid war anil to endeavor to
ameliorate conditions in Cuba hy diplomacy
rather than by the sword. Finally his courage
failed him and he succumbed and took the
step that plunged the country into an unite*
cesary and unjustifiable war, resulting in much
sacrifice of life by bullets and disease, the
maiming of thousands more, and in a large
addition to the public debts ot both the United
States and Spain and increased taxation for
both.
In his message to Congress lust Monday
the President recites the incidents leading up
to the war, in which he labors to throw all the
responsibility upon Spain, and closes that
part of his message with a direct assertion
that Spain “initiated that complete form of
rupture of relations which attends a slate ot
war.” The warrant for this assertion is the
refusal of Spain to consider the demand ol
the United Stales that she relinquish all au
thority over the island ol Cuba, giving to that
government forty-eight hours to answer, and
which demand was accompanied hy a copy id
resolutions of Congress authorizing the I’res
ident to use the land and naval forces ot
this government to enforce Spanish evacua
tion of Cuba.
In this part of the message it is quite evi
dent that the President is not stating his true
belief and conviction, but rather, having been
driven to a course contrary to both, he is en
deavoring to justify his course by throwing
the responsibility upon Spain.
The President next takes up the conduct
of the war and entertainingly recites chronolo
gically all the battles on land and sea and ihe
movements of the army and navy.
The message, while very lengthy, is com
pact and concise in statement. Nearly all ot
it is devoted to the Spanish-American war
and with foreign affairs. Nothing scarcely is
said of home affairs, beyond a recommenda
tion for the necessary legislation for taking
the census in 1900, for an appropriation to
celebrate the centennial anniversary of the
founding of Washington for a permanent cap
ital of Ihe government, an appropriation for
a building for the Department ol Justice and
the subsidizing of steam ships to run bet ween
United States ports and onr anticipated new
possessions.
Finance and taxation are scarcely more than
alluded to, and no suggestions are made as to
the government of our new possessions. As
to the latter, Congress is merely told that
military government will he continued until
that body prescribes some other form of gov
ernment.
The message is not one that will elicit much
adverse criticism, except those parts where the
President seeks to make Spain instead ol the
United States the aggressor in the late war,
subsidies to steam ship lines, and his concur
rence in the recommendations of the Secreta
ry of War for a large increase in our standing
army and of the Secretary of the Navy for large
additions to the navy. The teachings of the
fathers of the republic were tliat a large army
and a large navy were a menace to liberty, and
these lessons have recently been brought
home to the people hy attempts at govern
ment hy injunction, supported by federal
bayonets.
Most of the criticism has been for omissions
by the President.
Look at Home.
The Baltimore American, alluding to the
various reports of G. S. Griffith oa the Alms
House and Jail of Carroll, and to the report
of the late grand jury on the Jail, says Carroll
has not done its duty.
Ills just possible that it is none of the
American's concern how affairs are conducted
in Carroll, and it will lie kept very busy if It
corrects the abuses, rascality and thievery of
the gang that controls Baltimore and Mary
land.
The inmates of our Alms House are all
comfortable and satisfied, and the Jail is suf
ficient for all purposes.
Carroll has a lower tax rate than any other
county in the state and the debt per capita is
only about twenty-five cents. This is the re
sult of business methods in managing county
affairs, of strict honesty in public officials and
economy in public expenses. No jobs, no
scandals, no extravagance has been charged,
or even hinted at.
Baltimore has a debt of about $32 per cap
ita and a tax rate of about $2.35 on the SIOO.
Under Republican reform administration the
past two years there has been a continual
wrangle over spoils and the city has been sys
tematically robbed by dishonest officials, and
where dishonesty has not prevailed iacomp
tency reigned. Under the beneficent(?) Re
publican rule business has retrograded and
six or seven thousand buildings are tenant
less.
Let the American set its own house in or
der before commenting upon affairs in other
places.
Expenses of Government.
The government expenses for the present
year, ending June 30th next, amount to
$802,875,513, or at least that is the total of
regular and deficiency appropriations, and
the public debt was increased two hundred
millions of dollars by the sale of bonds to get
means to prosecute the war against Spain.
The estimates for the year ending June 30,
1900, amount to $593,048,378. The Presi
dent in his message to Congress on Monday
last recommends the appointment of Com
missions upon a variety of matters, and if
Congress sanctions their appointment there
there will be a large increase, as nothing is
so expensive as a commission. The expenses
of the government for 1900 are likely to go
considerably over $000,000,000, ns appropri
ations never hold out.
When the appropriations by the Fiftieth
Congress, two years, amounted to over a bil
lion of dollars, the country was amazed at
the extravagance and hurled the Republicans
from power in the House. Now, however,
billion dollar Congresses have come to stay,
for a time at least, and the probability is that
the expenses of government under the im
perial policy of the Republican party, if that
party be continued in power, are likely to
reach far above a billion dollars every two
years.
Cuba.
A dispatch from Havana, Cuba, of Decern
l>er 5, says—
Two American confidence men have been here
and gone, leaving the Spanish Wiser but poorer by
(30,000 in gold. One of them paid $5,000 by a certi
fied check for an option on a plantation at $115,000.
Then a second American appeared and offered
$175,000 cash for his plantation, giving the Spaniard
a certified check for SIO,OOO to make good the bar-
first purchaser refused to release his option
except on the payment of $30,000 cash. He got the
money. Needless to say the second purchase was
not completed. The certified checks were bogus,
and the two confidence men are now in the united
States.
Criminal Aggression.
In one of his messages to Congress last
April, we believe, President McKinley, in
denying the intent of the United States to
expand its territory, said —
“Forcible acquisition was criminal aggres
sion.”
According to this view the United Slates
have been, so far as the McKinley Adminis
tration could accomplish it, guilty of “crimi
nal aggression,” for it has insisted upon the
Peace Commissioners demanding Pono Rico
and other Spanish possessions against the
wishes of Spain and without consulting the
people of the islands thus sought to he an
nexed.
If the treaty of peace is ratified hy the
Senate and the House votes the necessary
$20,000,000 to pay to Spain for the Philip
pines, no one doubts that the forcible annex
atio i of Cuba will follow in a few years, al
though Congress declared to the world that
this government
“Disclaims any disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control
over said island except for the pacification
thereof, and asserts its determination when
that is accomplished to leave the government
and control of the island to its people.
Cost of Elections.
Under the Australian ballot law passed by
a Democratic Legislature, the cost of holding
an election in Carroll was about sllsO. Un
der the present law, passed by a Republican
Legislature, the bill presented to the County
Commissioners for the last election amounted
to over $3,000. No one, whose opinion is
worth noting, pretends that the present law
secures more secresy or fairness than the
form *r one, while all admit that it is more
cumbersome, difficult to understand, and
nearly three times as expensive.
Republican rform(?) in this one matter,
costs the tax-payers of Carroll nearly $2,000
extra —that is, $2,000 more than the efficient
simple election law passed by a Demo
cratic Legislature.
Open Discussion to be Had.
Treaties arc always considered by the Sen- |
ate in secret session. Still, this will not pie- j
vent a full ventilation of the subject of terri- |
turial expansion, for Mr. Vest, ol Missouri, j
has introduced into the Senate a joint resolu
tion declaring that under the Constitution the
United States have no power to acquire terri- !
lory to be held and governed as colonies. |
While speaking to this resolution members j
can take a wide latitude and the whole sub- |
ject of the conduct of the war, the breaking
faith with the nations of the world by acquir- |
inv territory when such acquisition was dis- j
tinctly disavowed, and the annulment of the |
Monroe Doctrine, can be fully discussed and i
ventilated.
Bidding for the Philippines.
flic inhabitants of the Philippine Islands |
do not relish being sold to the I nited States, j
They want independence and arc willing to j
pay the United Slates the $20,000,0(10 they
expect to pay Spain for the islands. Japan, it j
is said, is willing to pay $200,000,000 for the |
Philippines. I here is also some talk in
Washington of selling the islands out to Eng
land. France, Germany, Russia and Japan. ;
It is not altogether certain that the United j
States will ever own the Philippines to sell,
for there is a tremendous sentiment develop
ing against their acquisition.
The estimated receipts of the government ■
for the year ending June 30 next are one linn- |
dred and twelve millions of dollars less than
estimated expenses. I his does not disturb
Mr. McKinley, for he made no recommenda
tion concerning it. Ihe treasury has still
two hundred millions in bonds which can be j
issued if necessary, and the hankers, brokers j
and stock jobbers will likely compel their j
issuance.
The Secretary of War wants a standing j
army of 100,000 men. Formerly 25,000 have
proven more than necessary.
The Secretary of the Navy wants an addi
tion to the navy of three battle ships, three
armored cruisers, three protected cruisers and
six other cruisers, the total cost of which is
to he $36,100,800. The annual cost to main
tain these, if built and commissioned, will be
about $4,500,000.
Mayor Malster of Baltimore has notified
ihe Wellington-Stone combination that if he
is not renominated for Mayor next spring he
will he a candidate for Governor.
Secretary Alger’s Annual Report.
From the Baltimore Sun.
The Secretary, in his report, makes two
recommendations which will attract attention,
although one of them has been under discus
sion tor some time us a probable outcome of
the adoption cf a policy of territorial expan
[ sion. He urges that the regular standing army
j of the United States be increased to 100,000
I men, a portion of whom will be drawn from
; the natives of the islands which we have
wrested from Spanish control. Of course, a
standing army four times as large as that
which was adequate before the United States
went to war with Spain will he very expen
sive. Beginning on July 1, 1800, Secretary
Alger estimates that his department will need
$105,250,377 a year, a large part of which will
he required to pay the officers and men of our
enlarged military establishment. The people
have been warned that a colonial policy in
volves a vast increase in expenditures and
heavier burdens of taxation. Consequently,
if their representatives in Congress establish
a regular standing army 100,000 strong, they
will have to pay the bill, and it may not be
many years before an army of 100,000 men
will be declared inadequate and a further in
crease be ordered.
While he is enlarging fhe army, Secretary
i Alger is also eager to launch the government
! upon a programme of railroad development
j in Cuba. The Secretary thinks this govern
i ment should expend $20,000,000 iu building
j a road “practically through Ihe whole length
I of the island, with branch roads to the Icad
| ing cities on the coast.” As the Congress of
| the United States promised to give the Cu
bans a free and independent government,
there seems to be no good reason why the
United States should not leave to the Cubans
the development of their own island. If, how
ever, we are to annex Cuba, the question of
railroad building assumes a new phase, but
even under those conditions it would he well
to leave to private enterprise the construction
of railroads in Cuba. The country has not
yet forgotten the scandals which grew out of
the construction of the Pacific railroads by
government aid, and if the United States un
dertake to build railroads in Cuba it will
open up a wide field of jobbery, fraud and
scandal. There are many men who would
rejoice if the government was committed to
a programme involving the expenditure of
$20,000,000 on Cuba railroads. They would
grow rich on what could be made out of con
tracts and the government would suffer cor
respondingly. Government-built railroads in
Cuba will be a great thing for those who, in
the vernacular, are on the “ground floor,”
but the government of the United States ought
not to be conducted for their benefit.
A Republican Refuses to Contest.
A dispatch from Parsons, W. Vu., to the
Wheeling Register says that Judge Philetus
Lipscomb, the defeated Republican candidate
for the Legislature in Tucker county, was
urged last week by Governor Atkinson, Sec
retary of State Dawson and Interna! Revenue
Collector White to contest the election of Mr.
Wagoner.his successful Democratic opponent.
The dispatch to the Register says this appeal
to Mr. Lipscomb was supplemented by ap
peals from the county chairman and other
Republican leaders. Mr. Lipscomb firmly
refused to be a party to a contest, saying :
“Go back and tell Dawson and Governor At
kinson that if they want this notice served
they will have to sign it themselves and do the
swearing. I was beaten for the Legislature in
this county, and have no grounds for contest
against Mr. Wagoner, and I decline to be a
party to any scheme which looks to deprive
him of the seat in the Legislature to which he
was elected.”
In this county there bad been a recount a
few days after the election, at the request of
Mr. Lipscomb, but the recount showed a gain
in favor of Mr. Wagoner. '
A severe wind storm prevailed Tuesday
over the entire upper region of West Virginia
and Ohio. At Grafton, Fairmont, Morgan
town, Monongah and at many intermediate
points, severe damage was done to roofs,
chimneys and trees. At Morgantown a sec
tion of a plate glass window from a third story
was blown through the air 300 feet and struck
Harry Blair, who was walking on the side
walk. The glass was shivered and Blair has
fifty cuts on his head, face and shoulders.
I He can hardly recover.
