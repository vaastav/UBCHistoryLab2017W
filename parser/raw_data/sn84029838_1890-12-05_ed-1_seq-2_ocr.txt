Congress is in session.
There is small doubt but that tbe re
publicans will pass the force bill. Tbe
grave digging still poes on.
The president recommends that the
force bill be passed. 3Ir. Harrison re
fuses to take a tumble to himself.
The weather prophets are predicting
a mild winter. This will not deter the
Tfiee farmer from preparing for the
worst.
John L. Sullivan has made $30,000
from his theatrical tour. Muscle
seems to get the better of brains at
present
Christopher Columbus' autograph
is worth $800 and none for sale.
Christopher still cuts quite a figure,
considering the length of time since
his demise.
Pittsburg, Pa. has gone back to
smoke and soot, and ceased using nat
ural gas. Very few things can run
long on gas.
The coming year will see $125,000,
000 disbursed in pensions to the old
soldiers, in view of this fact, it does
not seem that republics are ungrate
ful. In his message, the president asserts
that the McKinley bill will open many
foreign markets to the farmer. Just
how or in what way, remains locked in
Ben's mind.
A number of cadctships arc vacant
at West Point. As there are almost
as many officers as men in the army,
the necessity for filling the vacancies
docs not appear.
Mr. Cleveland was abused for his
opposition to free coinage. He has
changed his views, favoring free coin
age. Now the same parties abuse him
for changing his views.
The Leavenworth Times prefixes
"premier" before Blaine's name. This
is rank, rotten treason, for the word is
peculiarly English, and what is used in
England, should never be used here.
The Albany Times ascribes the re
mit of the recent election in New
York to Hill's leadership. Just what
the Times ascribes the result in all the
other states to, is a matter for conject
ure. Benjamin Harrison had a chance,
through the agency of the annual mes
sage, to overshadow Blaine for a short
period, but alack! the golden opportu
nity hath gone for another year un
seized. "I voted for the McKinley bill be
cause it is a republican measure," is
the statesmanlike reason given by
John J. Ingalls for his support of that
measure. No wonder he advertises
Kansas.
The Democrat fails to recognize a
most valuable journalistic maxim, re
garding its Hill boom. Hash, re-hashed
without anything but hash, is apt to
become unpalatable. Take a tumble
brother Peter.
Kansas mortgages, according to some
exchanges have been paid off at the
rate of three hundred per day during
the past three months. The mortgage
liar, while new in the field, seems to
hare struck a boom.
The Wall street panic is over, and it
is said that Jay Gould is $30,000,000
more in pocket as a result. One be
gins to wonder whether the calamity
shriekcrs are altogether wrong or not
when one man can make millions of
dollars in a month, and not a dollar of
it in legitimate trade.
There is but one noteworthy section
in the president's message, and that is
relative to. the navy. Fortunately the
country is united in the demand for a
reconstruction of of the navy, and the
work began by Secretary Whitney is
being carried forward by his successor.
Our government now has some of the
finest war vessels in the world.
It is singular the amount of bitter
animosity; vituperative abuse and un
called for denunciation hurled against
Grover Cleveland by the republican
papers. There is an apparent explan
ation for this and it is that they fear
him, and deep down in their hearts they
respect him. It galls and chafes them
when they hear some distinguished re
publican like Chauncy M. Dcpcw -declare
that Grover Cleveland "is a splen
did type of the typical American," or
when a distinguished protectionist like
Andrew Carnegie publicly pays a trib
ute to his uprightness, honesty, and
fearlessness. How cheap tawdy, not
to say contemptible, appear the sneers
sad insults thrown at Grover Cleveland
by these small fry, in comparison with
the leaders acknowledgments of true
worth.
It is highly probable that this, the
seventh congressional district, will be
divided under the new apportionment.
This is the largest and most populous
congressional district in the United
States, and consequently it is almost
an assured fact that the apportionment
will be made. Whether or not it will
will cut us off from sockless Jerry
Simpson, is a matter for grave conjec
ture. Mr. Blaine' reciprocity ideas, pre
sent a most remarkable change of front.
Mr. Blaine is indirectly responsible
for the high tariff attitude of the re
nublican rjartv today. It was he who
sprang to the fore, when Mr. Cleve
land's message made its appearance,
and he it was who, through his coun
ter message, committed the republican
party to the stand it assumed against a
lowering of duties. Mr. Blaine's mas
ter political stroke won, and Mr. Harri
son was landed in the white house.
But the campaign of education went
on, and Mr. Blaine, with the eye of a
prophet, saw that the seed sown in 1888
by the democrats, bore fruit in-.' 89-90.
Taking time by the forelock, Mr.
Blaine has made a mighty jump clear
ing the Chinese wall, and landed on
reciprocity. Mr. Blaine saw that the
people did not understand the tariff
question in 1888. Mr. Blaine sees
that they are understanding it better
every day and that they will have thor
oughly mastered it by 1892. The oth
er republican leaders are not gifted with
Mr. Blaine's powers of perception and
the rock upon which the split will oc
cur, will be high protection. The sec
retary of state is, without doubt, advo
cating a policy reciprocal trade
which would be of vastly more benefit
for the American people than protect
ion. But the fact that he forced them
to accept the high tariff policy, which
is now proving so disastrous, augers ill
for him ever receiving another nomi
nation as the champion of reciprocity.
Harrison, McKinley and Reed, who fol
lowed Mr. Blaine's lead to high tariff
waters, will not relish the idea of leav
ing them stranded, while he sails into
port on a reciprocity craft. They have
attempted to carry out the points made
in Mr. Blaine's Paris message, by pil
ing on tariffs, while Mr. Blaine, after
casting a glance over the political hor
izon, has concluded that times have
changed and steers away from the high
tariff. Protection is proving a mill
stone around the neck of the republi
can party in more ways than one, but
Mr. Blaine docs not propose to be
dragged to the bottom of the sea.
OUR FAMOUS UNDERFLOW.
From The Chicago Herald.
There has been growing upon those
who have studied the plains of Kansas
the conviction that agriculture in thr
western third of the state, is beyond
question a failure, unless a more per
manent water supply can be obtained.
A new theory has been broached, that
of irrigation by means of the "under
flow" in the river valleys, and it has
been tested with remarkable success.
In searching for and investigating the
water sources, it was discovered that
underneath the great valley of the Ark
ansas, and presumably under the beds
of all rivers of Western Kansas, if not
under the plains, lies hidden a vast
body of water. The possibility of us
ing this as a source from which to sup
ply the ditches naturally arose, and
practical tests have just been completed
that prove the entire reasonableness of
the theory.
The vicinity of Dodge City, about
100 miles from the western line of the
state in the Arkansos valley, was se
lected as the place for the experiment
just completed. There was opened a
ditch fourteen feet wide and drifting
westward up the valley. The river
falls seven feet to the mile, and the
ditch was commenced three feet below
the surface, and extended westward on
a grade of three feet to the mile, which
soon brought it below the level of the
river bottom.
The ditch was extended until the ex
cavation was found to be twelve feet
deep, and six feet below the river bot
tom. Into the ditch thus dug into the
the solid earth, drained the underflow.
So great was the drainage that at the
point of beginning a dam was construct
ed, ard the" amount of water flowing
over it was thirty cubic feet per sec
ond. A ditch was opened easterly along
the higher land, at a fall of only one
and seven-tenths feet per mile, so that
by the time the ditch reaches a point
southeast of Dodge City there is a per
pindicular fall of nearly or quite twen
ty feet, with a water supply as con
stant as the everlasting hills, or at
least so considered.
The ditch thus far constructed, and
which it is believed will furnish a per
manent, supply the year round, as it
was completed at the close of the dry
est year ever known in Western Kan
sas, will irrigate about 25,000 acres of
land and has been built at a cost of $60
000. The proprietors believe that,
with their expsrience they could now
do the same amount of work for at
least $10,000 less.

THE DODGE SCHOOL OF THEOLOGY-
One of the fixed institutions of South
west Kansas is The Dodge School of
Theology. It was organized December
2, 1887, and incorporated the same
year. The Southwest and the North
west Kansas Conferences approved it
by appointing official visitors. The
school opened in June, 1888 as an ex
periment. It has proved a success.
It has grown in favor. Its warmest
friends are its students, who number
now near sixty, and who hold a mem
bership in eleven annual conferences,
and reside in as many states or terri
tories. The Alumni numoers a score
of our brightest young men, all of
whom are in the active itinerant work.
The object of The Dodge School of
Theology is to furnish at nominal cost,
Biblical and Theological knowledge,
and a thirst for broader culture, to
those in active ministerial ranks, and
others, who cannot go to a school that
would require long terms, great dis
tance and large expense.
In The Dode School of Theology
very much is crowded into its short
terms. To furnish an outline, where
to find what is wanted, suggestive plans
of study, enough to sharpen the appe
tite and to cause the student to think
for himself, is its aim. It brings the
young itinerant into intellectual touch
with the growing thought of the church,
it grounds him in the faith of the fath
ers, it equips him for the work of to
day. Bishops, editors, educators, leaders
of thought in the church, as far as they
have examined the plans and work of
the school, are very hearty in their
commendations. Not one has spoken
disparagingly. They seem to see in it
a solution of the problem how to
reach the mass of preachers with need
ed knowledge and culture. The late
Gen. Clinton B. Fisk, after a careful
examination, credited its foundation to
"an inspiration from Heaven".
The Dodge School of Theology owns
no property, has no endownment, and
is without an income. Its faculty is
large, its undertakings many, its ex
penses heavy. So far, "without a col
lection in the churches", a "financial
agent in the field" or "appeals through
the press", it has paid its bills. It
has no debts, but its needs are many
It will have property, income and en
downment.
The First Step-
Perhaps you are run down, can't eat,
can't sleep, can't think, can't do any
thing to your own satisfaction, and you
wonder what ails you. You should heed
the warning, you are taking the first step
into Nervous Prostratiou. You need a
Nerve Tonic, and in Electric Bitters you
will find the exact remedy for restoring
your nervous system to its normal
healthy condition. Surprising results
follow the use of this great Nerve Tonic
and Alternative. Your appetite returns

and Kidneys resume healthy action. Try
a bottle. Price, 50 cents; at City Drug
Store.
F. H. Mendenhall, of the Dodge City
Times, seems to be worrying himself
about the number of joints that are doing
businesss in Kansas City. Kansas Nev
er mind brother' Gov. Humphrey and
Attorney General Ives, will get them all
in due time Jetmore Sunflower.
Two hundred joints in a probition city
is enough to worry anybody but a bro
bibition republican. Eight years hayc
passed away in the work ef "getting'
them, and they don't seem to have been
"got" yet.
