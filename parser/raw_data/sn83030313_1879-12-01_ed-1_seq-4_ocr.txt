NEW YOKE
Frrnldrnl Annual Ncu?k?.
The President's Message, like Secretary
Sherman's report, has been surreptitiously
obtained and prematurely published,
greatly to the annoyance, no doubt, of
their respective authors. Tbe President
must feel this breach of trust more keenly
than the Secretary, since it will make an
empty show of a usual mark of respect for the
Chief Magistrate of the country. Unlike
the department reports, the annual Message
! of the President is formally read at length
in both houses of Congress, and listened to
not only with the appearance but the reality
of attention. Its contents being previously
unknown, the members ??re curious to
seo what the President has to communicate.
But this year everybody
will liave road the Message before
delivery, and it will be a solemn
bore to sit for two hours under the iiiflic*
tion of a document with whose oontents
they are perfectly acquainted. To ilispenso
with the reading would be a violation of
usage and of decorum toward the President,
while to procoed with it before listless and
uulisteniug auditors will be an idle and
tedious formality unwelcome to all concerned.
It would be still more annoying
if the practice of the first two Presidents
had been kept up ot delivering the annual
communication in person to the two houses
assembled in one chamber. It is easy to
imagine how the pomp of sucli an occasion
would be turned into ridicule, and what a
loss of dignity would be felt by the President
in delivering a ceremonious speech which
had been deprived of its freshness and gloss
and had satiated public curiosity. We
suppose the publication might be punished
as a contempt of Congress in intercepting
and divulging a communication intended
>for it, but this would be unwise, as magnifying
tho want of skill and care on the
part of the Executive.
The Message thus surreptitiously obtained
is a plain and unambitious document,
which conveys in a clear, straightforward
manner the views of the President
on the present state of the country. It has
a higher merit than force of diction and
intellectual astuteness?the great merit
of steady and honest adherence to
sound principles without vacillation
or trimming, or any of the shiftiness
which bends to a lalso expediency. We have
some abler men in public life than President
Hayes, but none who excels him in
that rectitude of understanding which
proceeds rather from the moral than tho
intellectual side of human nature, and
which is the chief safeguard against ingenious
and plausible error. Public questions
are not so difficult that it requires any great
stretch of iaoulties to understand them;
otherwise republican institutions would be
an absurdity. Government by the people
implies that the people are capable of forming
correct judgments on publio questions,
and what is needed in their rulers is not so
much superior intellect as steadfast virtue
and political courage. To President Hayes
belongs the praise of standing by his
conviotions, which is the greatest merit
that oan be possessed by a man who is
clothed with responsible trusts. The leading
recommendations in this Message bear
the stamp of unswerving honesty of purpose
in adhering to settled views. The
large portion devoted to civil service reform
exemplifies the President's tenacity
in what he believes to be
right. He returns to the charge with
unabated zeal and courage. His position
on this subject ia so obviously right and
wise that he can afford to disregard the
obloquy of trading politicians and keep
alive the efforts which, if they do not sueceed
in his time, must ultimately suacoed
if wo are to save our free institutions.
We cannot follow this part
of the Message in detail, because the President
touches another greut subjeot of more
immediate urgency on which it is the duty
of the press and the country to give him
their promptest and heartiest moral support.
Civil service can wait, especially
while the head of the government
is trying to check its most
flagrant abuses ; but our great experiment
at resumption is in such peril from gross
imperfections in the laws as to justify notes
of alarm even in the flush of apparent prosperity.
The country stands on the downward
road toward a new inflation, and progress in
that direction must be arrested.
The law requiring the continued coinage
of base silver dollars must be repealed or
our currency will sink to a lower value than
it hud during the lour years which preceded
resumption. There ha9 not been a day
sinco the passage of the Resumption act in
1875 when the silver dollar was worth as
much as the greenback dollar, and if
the present large coinage of silver is
to be continued gold will be driven
out and our currency sink to the bullion
value of silver, thus losing more than we
have gained by resumption. On this point
the President is explicit. "The market
value of the silver dollar," he says, "being
uniformly and largely loss than the market
value of the gold dollar, it iB obviously impracticable
to muintain them at par
with each other if both are coined
without limit. If the cheaper coin is
forced into circulation it will, if coined
without limit, soon become the sole standard
of value." When our currency sinks
to that point it will be more depreciated
than it wns at the date of the Resumption
act, and this great and costly experiment
of resumption will prove a failure and a
farce.
As if this danger were not sufficient, wo
are threatened with another, whioh approaches
with swifter steps. Our resumption
is not redemption. What it builds up
with one hand it immediately pulls down
with tho other. By an absurd and stultifying
lnw all the greenbacks whioh are taken
outof circulation by resumption uro required
to be put back into circulation by
the Treasury. Il the currency becomes
ever so swollen and inflated there are no
legal means of reducing its volume, but a
legal compulsion to keep it all in circulation.
Genuine redemption of tho greenbacks
would be the payment of a debt, but
the pretended payment is a sham when
another debt of equal ainouut is forthwith
incurred. It is like the expedient
^called "skinning," by which a hard
L HERALD, MONDAY, DE(
up individual tries to got rid of
liis debts by borrowing more money,
which shifts ami postpones his obligations
without discharging tho u?a trick unworthy
of a great and solvent government.
Tho only correct and sale way to deal with
the greenbacks is to redeem and cancel
them, whereas tho method actually pursued
is like pretending to bail the water
out of u boat by pouring it into a seive
pluccd directly over the hold.
Presideut Hayes has a clear perception of
the folly and danger of this fictitious resumption,
which makes no more progress
than soldiers do when at beat of drum they
lift their feet to mark t^ime, bringing thorn
down in the same spot. Our false resumption
marks time but does not march,
and meauwhile the currency is rap'<!!?
1v<r Vtr {mnA*^Ai?Ana
AV1AJT luumvu uj uvu v j lui^vtvuuvua
of gold. Tho only proper thing
to do is to withdraw and cancel tho legal
tender notes. "The retirement from circulation,"
suys tho President, "of United
States notes, with the capacity of legal
tender in private contracts, is a step to be
tuken in our progress toward a safe and
stublc currency." This language is well
chosen. "A safe and stable currency"
is not yet achieved, but is something
which it is our dnty to make
"progress toward" by taking the indispensable
step of retiring the greenbacks.
This puts our resumption experiment in
its true light. It is the President's opinion
that the continxied circulation of the legal
tender notes is a violation of the constitution
as well as false finance. "It is my
firm conviction," he declares, "that the
issue of legal tender piiper money, based
wholly upon the authority and credit
of the government, except in extreme
emergency, is without warrant
in the constitution and a violation of sound
financial principles." Their issue was intended
as a transient war measure, and
their continuance in circulation was not
contemplated by the trainers of the law.
"They anticipated tho redemption and
withdrawal of these notes at the earliest
practicable period consistent with tho attainment
of the object for which they were
provided." President Hayes has earned a
new title to public confidence by these unshrinking
declarations.
Plumbers and People.
Winter has ccrtain points of merit that
strongly commend it to tho public esteem.
It brings skating, sleighriding and Christmas
presents, supplies excuses for buying
new clothes and opportunities to give away
old ones, provides Congress for us to grumble
at and transfers most tramps from the
streets to the Island ; yet, when Among its
inevitable effects is noted that exasperating
but necessary evil the plumber, it is not
strange that men who pay bills do not regard
the return of the season with unmixed
delight. The magnitude of this
infliction makes it seemingly impossible
that the plumber was invented merely as a
punishmont for sinners; besides, true
justice is always tempered with mercy,
and there is nothing merciful about
the ways or the bill of the average
plumber. Ho is called, in a hurry,
to rectify a frozen or bursted water
pipe, and in his own good time he comes.
We say he, for a single individual is, to the
innocent householder, supposed to be sufficient
to the occasion, but the rulo is for
two men to appear?one bearing a lamp
and tho other a bag of tools. The ability
that tool bag displays for nover containing
the appliances demanded by the oocasion
is beyond doubt the eighth wonder of the
world, but it never astonishes the tool
bearer, who returns to the shop for the
lacking articles, while his companion
mukes himself agreeable to the servants at
an expense of sundry dollars per hour to
the employer of those ladies. In time
the man returns, and not ulways
with anything so heavy as to explain
his long absence; the couple go through
various motions of doing something, they
depart, and the bill that follows is one that
would delight a Supreme Court justice if
he could make it out in his own favor according
to the time consumed. But if the
householder gets off even on suoh
terms he should congratulate himself,
for if the plumber is worthy
of his profession he does not allow a frozen
pipe to be cleared without first building a
fire on the sidewalk and attending the same
at an extortionate rate per hour, with the
cost of fuel supperadded at figures that
must make ooal companies acouse themselves
of abject cowardice. The time for
all this sort of thing is at hand, and the
householder who has not a large bank account
would do well to wrap his water pipes
warmly, spend two or three dollars in tools
and do his own tinkeriifg, If his time is
worth five dollars per hour ho may, nevertheless,
do the work at hulf the cost that a
brace of plumbers would compel.
Ireland'* Demonstrations.
Our special cable despatch from Ballnghaderin,
in the county of Mayo, gives us a
picture of one of the many meetings held
in various parts of Ireland yesterday. The
gathering described in our special despatch
was apparently conducted in a temperate
and sensible manner, and as a matter of
course resolutions were passed condemning
the action of the government.
Mr. Duly had a picturesque
reception, and expressed his thanks to the
English government for his recent arrest,
which he considered had greatly assisted
the present agitation. In conjnnction with
the reports of yesterday's demonstrations
the thoughtful lettor oq Irish aif.iirs from
our Dublin correspondent will be read
with more than ordinary interost. Tho
letter makos clear, first of all, the nccessity
that was felt by Irish leaders of
"demonstrating" in such a fashion that the
attention of the world should be drawn to
the sad condition of the island. Indoed,
Lord tteaconsfield treated the land movement
with unjustifiable levity until the
matter was brought home to him in
the more serious form of what ho considered
"seditious" language. It must have
beon a groat blow to Disraeli, so busily
occupied in demonstrating the Imperial
idea, to have the stute of
Ireland thrown aa a taunt in hia face
3KMBE11 1, 1879.-WITH SI
l>y the Russ and more especially by
the Turk, who, when asked insultingly
to carry out reforms in Asia Minor, pointed
ironically to the condition of affairs permitted
to exist under the reform-boasting
government of Her Majesty so much nearer
home. The mass meeting in Hydo Park
yesterday, as reported by cable, was a
perfect lizzie. The home rulers in London
would do well in future if
they would organize meetings in such
a fashion as to excludo the Tiohborneites
and othor similar factions. These people
generally make themselves and those to
whom they attach themselves ridiculous.
The present Irish agitation is essentially a
national one, and as such does not need any
augmentation from questionable sources.
American Glrla.
The editor of Truth has, liko all his home
contemporaries, found it necessary to say
Kf)inf>thiiiL? about tho American <_'irl. and as
most English editorial opinions on tho
suuie topic have to thoir estimable subject
boon iar more provocative of pouts than
smiles, we are happy in being able to say
that Truth believes the Amerioun girl to
unite the tact and savoir vivre of the
French woman with tho solid qualities of
the Anglo-Saxon race. Wo are further informed
that our young women know how
to set off their natural advantages with
dress, they are philosophically good tempered,
and?although on this side of the
ocean it has strongly the appearance
of a negative virtue?they are favorites
with wife-soeking Englishmen. The
editor is to be congratulated upon his discernment,
lor most of his fraternity abroad
have blundered wofully whenever they
have attempted to consider tho samo subject;
they have followed rales established
by society groatly unlike our own so far
as women are concerned, failing to realize
the fact that in Europe, as well as here,
woman's manner is the result of the requirements
that society, in the larger significance
of the word, makes upon her. It
is not only impossible, but decidedly improper,
for the American woman, even
of excellent English lineage, to bo
an exact follower of her foreign
cousins, for her position at home and
in society is higher and more important.
Married, she is not only her husband's
housekeeper and his assistant in social formalities
; she is, if she chooses, his business
coniidanto and in every other way his
equal ; unmarried, and still u girl at home,
she has nevertheless, through birth and
tho unconscious education of the home circle,
at least as much taste for general affairs

which is unexcelled by her sex in any other
nation, and equalled only in France, is
partly the result of mental rebound
from practical cares and thoughts?
from the cause, in fact, to which in
most countries the higher spirits of
the ruder sex may be traced. The demands
of a nower civilization are probably the
cause of the difference, just as the special
requirements of travel in rude countries
have turned delicate English ladies?for
instance, Lady Duff Gordon and the wife of
Sir Samuel Baker?into admirable women
of affairs, without in the least marring inherited
graces and refinements. Most of
our girls graduate from homo sohools where
the special tuition has a range to which
that enjoyed by the English girl is not to
be compared, and among the effects are
perception, decision and independence,
which unconsciously modify conduct
with' results that are entirely misunderstood
abroad, for the simple
reason that vigorous individuality in
woman is not demanded there by the
conditions of society, and its manifestation
is consequently regarded with suspicion.
That the typical American girl is
not entirely at home in foreign society follows
as a matter of course, and not for
reasons ascribed by most English writers
and suggested by some Americans who seem
to be endeavoring to denationalize themselves.
That sho is not nn English girl may
occasionally cause her annoyance, yet to
become other than she is would require
loss of character, lor which the conventional
graces of a different though not a
more refined oivilization would be no compensation.

Possibly even tfce crazy London Quarterly
Iteview may recover reason concerning the
IIkiuld's weather servico after it has been
pelted by a few more pitiless storms of
which we have given cable warnings a week
in advance. While New York was lying in
clear, oold moonshine last night, without
a cloud flecking the sky, London was attesting
the accuracy of the warning wo sent last
Tuesday, and all over Groat Britain snow
wus drifting in a gale that blocked tho railways.
The Quarterly doubts whether it is
"of any possible use to a Wick herring boat

says:?"The discomfort suffered by the audience
was considerable; but the lecturer, standing on a
draught-swept stage, was in a much more pitiable
condition." Fortunately for Mr. Proctor's peace of
mind, he recognized, in tbe intense oold, a valid explanation
of the mental stagnation he had experienced.
Only a few minutes aftor tbe lecture he had
said, remarks the writer just mentioned, "I have
lectured with the perspiration streaming from my
face without serious lnconvenleuco; but the oold
this evoning put mo hors de combat so far as power*
of expression were ooncerned. Had I done
so badly in Now York on my opening evening, I
should have had but a small audience at subsequent
lectures." Hocce, lecture committees may learn
that although In the case of a single discourse they
may sately freeao the locturer, they will do Wisely
to make things warm on the first night of a course.
AMUSEMENTS.
grand opera hoose?gilmgbe's concebt.
Another In the aerioa of Bouday night ooucorta of
Mr. P. 8. Gilmore was given laat evening at the
Grand Open House. Tho audience in the orchestra
and family circles and gallery waa large, and ahowed
the popularity .of this claaa of entertainments. The
programme waa one of tho beat of the aeaaon, and
introduced auch artiata, in addition to the band, aa
Mlaa Stella Botatord. Mlaa Bertha Mouia, Mr.
Alfred Pease, the pianiat; Mr. Lefebre, aoloiat on
tho saxophone; Slgnor Liberal I, on the cornet;
Mr. Carl Lanier, on the violin, and
M. de Leauhodny on the zither. The musical
selection* wore of the character that
have made these performances so generally enter*
taininu. One of tho notable features of the evonlng
waa the debut of Miax Htella iiotsford, a daughter of
tho well known musician of that name. She has a
sweet, fresh, flute-like roice, not poworful, bnt thoroughly
sympathetic and always in tuna, and she so
well rendered the aria to which sho was aaalgned,
"Nearer My God to Tlioe," that being called on for
an encore she gave a rondition of "Ave Maria." Tho
young lady lias a bright artlatio future before
her. Miss liertlia Monia also aang in
an acceptable miinnor tho sacred aria from
llandel, "He shall feed his flock." The perform*
ntices of tho rest of the artists and of the band have
already been heard nud commented upon heretofore.
Tho evening's entertainment ended with a march,
putUled "Gratitude," by Mejrollis, dedicated to Gilmore's
Hand by one of its members, and played for
the ttrst time. Mr. Gilmore will not repeat these
.Sunday ovenlng concerts until after the prodnction
of his new national anthem, "Columbia," which will
rirobablv take Disco durlmr tho next two wanks.
ARAHKMY OF MUSIC?OOHC15BT.
A Urge ?u<li?nce was in the Acadomy of Mnnlc U?t
evening to bear the concert announcod by Mr.
Maplcaon, the occasion being the final repetition
of lloaaini'a "Stabat Mater" by Her Majowty'a Opera
Company. Thia, the important work of the
evening, and in whloh Mile. Vallerla, Miaa Gary,
HignorlCampanini, Oalanal and llerr Behrana wera
the aololata, wan followed by a miacoilanaouaconoeri,
in which latter Mme. Ambre, llerr Bohrena, the tall
band mid chorua wure engaged.
The "Htabat Mater" waa aung very well, and In
tho main moat artlatically, bnt It had not the oven
flulah throughout that waa ao atrong and admirablo
a point in laat Hunday'a concert. Still, It waa an
abin Interpretation of tbe work and waa
greatly enjoyed by the hooae. Mme. Ambre
wan down for Itohaud'H "La Htella Confidante"
aud llerr llehrena for "Trollhattan" and Abt'a "Mtill
iat die Nacht." Mme Ambre aang with conaldorabi*
expreaaion, but not alwaya with a faithful ri-gard to
the key in which the aeloctiona were placed by the
compoaer, while Hnrr liehrena acquitted hlnmclf
moat creditably, and exhibited again hla excellent
i method and thorough Amah. Both Mote. Am bra ,
and Herr Bchreus were pleasantly reo ived and
heartily encored.
There is uuu trilling matter iu couueotion with
tbe?e coucerla which, to lunio of the audruuce, ia a
source of diasatisfactlou, and to which the management's
attention only needs to be directed, iu all
probability, to meet with proiupt abatement
of an annoyance. At least such should be
the result. It i? the universal custom iu
New York to provide free programmes ot the evenlug's
entertainment for the use of an audience. At
Mr. Mupleson's Muudiy concert* they are printed
only in the acore books for sale in the lobbies. The
purchaser ot a seat discovers on entering the
house that he muat remain in ignorance
of the namea of the artists, and evon of tha
music they are singing, unless he purchases a
book. The cost is trifling; but, aucustonlod to a free
programme, the additional tax imposed in this way
ia an annoyauce to the patrons of the house. Any
aort of a cheap card of the entertainment is preferable
to having any of the audience dissatisfied.
Mr. Maple-on haa so ably produced ltoaslnl's
"Stabat Mater" that he should follow it with some
Muss music, of which there ia a wealth from whieh
to choose, and which, beiug well suited to his Company,
could be producod und r Signer Ardlti'?ahle
direction with great effect. These coucerts are of so
excellent a quality that thoy deserve encouragement,
which thoy will undoubtedly receive If the programmes-are
varied?and free.
FBKNCH CONCERT AT BOOTH'S TflEATRE.
A large audience sat ilowu at Booth's last evening
to taste sucli pieces of French musical cookery tu
Mr. tirau thought moot for a Sunday repast. It was
a very light oue Indeed, but was enjoyed without
question. Even wheu it was amiouncod in a
grave but witty way from the stage that
"Lea Canards Tyroliena" had been left behind
In Boston, there was not a single murmur
of foul play over the Iosb of those birds, and when
Mile. Paola-Marie came forward to sing instead "SI
vous croyez," from OHenbach's forgotten "Fortunio,"
everybody looked as if they really did believe
it. Here and there was found a make-believe
of giving the conccrt a lift out of ths
region opera of bouffe and the cafc-chantant, but
nobody took It seriously to -heart. M.
Capoul quivered from top to too in "L'Extase"
of Felicien David, and was called on to
cjuivor again to the same touching tune. Later on ha
sang "Lies Etoiles," a pretty bit of melody by M.
Almeras, words by M. Charles Villa, and was induced
to repeat it. Mr. A. il. i'o.isu, the pianist, played
Oottschalk's arrangement of Verdi's "Miserere,"
which ho followed up with variations uuou "The
Sweet By audByu" and "Suwanee ltiver." He know*
bis public. But the comic songs?the chnuonettei
by Mile. Angele and Mile. l'aola-Muriu?were the
supple backbone of the entertuinmeut. Thoy brought
the Frenchmen back to the days before opera boutft
loomed upon the theatrical horizon?days whose
traditions are merrily kept up still in the singing
halls of Pans. In this branch of art?tho Freuch
make it an art, as thoy do with everything which
English and Americans leave in the state ot
manufactures?Mile. Angele excels, and PaolaMarie
is not far behind. Angela's "C'est
dans 1'nes que 9a m'chatouillo," as well her
"Bras dessus.bras dessous" were a delight to the omnivorous
audience and would bo a revelation to our
variety women, though wo doubt that in plain English
they would bo as palatable to our public. So it
was with Mile. Marie's "Far lo trou de la serrure,"
whose audacity could bo learned from the
little lady's expressivo pantomime if her
distinct pronunciation hau failed to convey
the sense of its words. These ladiea
had to sing the concluding stanzas again and again.
Mile. Gregoire faintly recalled the lost Aimoo by
singing "La Paloma" and "Protty as a Picture,"
and Messrs. Juteau, Vtlauo and Poyard added
more or less to the programme. M. Jouard Rang
from Auber's "Domino Noir"and with Mile, ltaphsel
in a duo from tho "Daughter ot tho ltegluiont."
This was ambitious at least.
