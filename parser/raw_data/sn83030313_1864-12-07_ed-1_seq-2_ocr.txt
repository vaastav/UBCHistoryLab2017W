The Secretary or tbe Treasury's report will probably bo

the remarks relating lo tbe finances in tbe President's
Message to reflect upon. The receipts or tbolreaeury

Tbe President, we are glad to find, agrees with the
Secretary of tbe Treasory that increased taxation is ren
dered necessary. lie makes a suggestion that Congress
would do well to lake s hint from with respect to ex
emption from taxation and eeizure for debt of eome
future iesus of government securities. But ws need
bsrdly say that distinctions of this kind would be In
vidious, end tbe only way in which Congress can ect open

the government exempt from selzjre for,dobt.
Tbe amount of tbe public debt on tbe 1st of July !ast
fell abort of the eatlmnte of Mr. Chase by 93,995,079, and
tbe President beilevee that this "fact exhibits a satisfac
tory condition and coo duct of the operations of tbe
Treasury." We are eorry that we cannot coincide with
Mr. Lincoln In this eahtulue view of aflaira. " This
fact" simply amounts to nothing whatever.
The Executive highly approvea the national bank ays
IMS, nod says it will be for Congress to determine
"wbetaer or not any further legislation Is advisable for

?tassage concludes with tbe remark tbst 'it seems quite
eiesr the Treasury cannot be satisisctorlty conducted
uoless the government can exercise a restraining power
over tbe bank note clrculatoa of tbe couatry," and
ooaaidermg that tho national bank issues are

SPECIAL AOl-MTS.
By tbe seventeenth section of an act of Oongraas, ap
proved July 1,1804, chapter 197. page ;?y, it is enacted
' tbat the special agent ol tbe I oat utiles Department on
the Pontile eoaet aball receive a compensation of live dol
lars per diem." 'Ibe sa<ary of this officer was $2 600 per
annum under tbe act of March 2, 1001, and for all travai
ling and incidental expenses no greater sum than two
dollars for each day employed oould bo allowed under the
act of March 3,1846
It is not supposed thai Congress Intended to reduce the
pay of this utbeer irom $3.3J0 to $1 826, but such is the
effect of the law, and 1 meretori recommend such a
modiflcAttua of that seotion as will restore his lull oaiaty
of $2^0u per annum from the date of the paoaage of said
act, and to provide for hi* actual travelling expenses a
sum not exceeding $6 per diem. Although, at the time
of the passage of tbe said sot, $2 per diem was con
srdered sufficient for tbe traveling and incidental ex
penses oi ibeee officers, it la now inadequate, aod I re
commend that all other S|>ecial agents be allowed a gum
not exceeding (4 per day while enspioyod.
For several yeara after tbe occupation of tba Pacltc
coast by tbe I nlted States, tbe agent oi una department
stationed at San Francisco had larger powers lb?a
usually oonSded l> special agents In the Atlantic States,
particularly lu rofereoce to the adjustment of con
tractors' account*, tba practice being lor him to give
certiilcatee of service performed under mall coatracta,
on which the Postmaster at ran Francisoo made pay
ments Tbe soconnts ware then transmitted te the Au
ditor for entry and fUnl setlismeat. la this manner
pay menu to mail contractors were expedited, bat doubts
arising as to tbe authority of Ibe Poetmaoiar t.eueiui to
coster such powers oa a subordinate olDoer, they were
wttbdrnwo, and ibe I'aclOc agent is now on the same
footing with all other ofl.cers of bis class. It is be
lieved tbai tbe tunctlons of Ibis oflloer could be en
larged with advantage to ibe public aervloe, and as pre
vious legislation is neceeaary.aileation is called to the

In this connection it Is proper to sdd that, from infor

aivo tbat tbe postal sorvics In the I'acilla Mates is cot Is
as good condition as should be desired; and I may aave

Tbo payment of $260 per round trip, limited to the
