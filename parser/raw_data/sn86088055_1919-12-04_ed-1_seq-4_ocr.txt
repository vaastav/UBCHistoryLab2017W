Washington, Dec. 2 General
recommendations on the cost of liv
ing, labor unrest, radicalism ami re
adjustment of the nation to a peace
t'asis were the features of President
Wilson's annual message to congress
del'vered today.
'I he peace treaty, the president
told congress, will be discussed in a
separate message alter, as will the
railroad question. For the second
time only since the president estab
lished the practice of addressing
I congress in person, his message was
j read by the clerks.
I The president's principal reeom-
mendntions were the establishment
of a budget system for national fi
1 nances, reorganization of the taxa
' tion system with simplification of the
I income and excess profit taxes; re
adjustment of the tariff system to
i conform with the fact that the Un
; ited States is the greatest capitalist
1 in the world; recognition and relief
'for veteran soldiers of the world war,
I particularly in the way of govern
1 ment farms as proposed by Secretary
Lane; proper measures to foster dye
stuffs industry built up during the
war to keep the United States inde
pendent of foreign supply; enlarged
i program fur rural development, in
recognition of the farmers' part in
' the war.
Measures which will "remove the
causes of the political restlessness in
our body politic." At this point the
president made his most extensive
reference to the peace treaty by say
ing that the causes for unrest ";r,
tuperficial rather than deep-seated,"
ami that thev "arise from or are con
nected with the failure on the part
.of our government to arnve speedily
at a just ami permanent peace per
mitting return to normal conditions
from transfusion of radical theor
ies" from the seething European cen
ters, pending such delay, from heart
less profiteering, resulting from the
increased cost of living, and lastly
' from the machinations of passionate
and malevolent agitators. With re
turn to normal conditions this unrest
will rapidly disappear.
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal
effectively with "those persons who
by violent methods will abrogate our,
time-tested institutions."
Several recommendations and some
renewals of previous ones were made
by the president to bring down the
cost of living. Among them were
extension of the food control law to
peace times for emergency, regula
tion for the transpotration of foods
in interstate emmerce; a cold storage
i law modeled after the law in New

show the length of time foods are
kept in storage, and a law to secure
"competitive selling and to prevent
unconscionable profiU" by federal

A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and rights of labor. "A definite
program to bring about improvement
in conditions of labor and a genuine
democratic industry," was recommended.
SOME LOCAL ITEMS
FROM THE SLATONITE
LUBBOCK. TEXAS
Although the crops have just be
gun to move around Slaton the bank
deposits are climbing rapidly, which
indicates that prosperity is with us.
It is estimated that lcs than half the
cotton has been marketed and very
little grain has moved on account of
lack of thrashers and laborers to put
it in shape for the market. Despite
these facts there is now about 1700,
(100 00 on deposit in the two Slaton
banks, as compared with $JXi,8"U
on September 1 2th this year.
F. L. Wilber received a message
Monday stating that his father, W.
R. Wilber, had died at his home in
Omaha, Nebraska. He left Tuesday
for that city to attend the funeral
and burial. Before returning Mr.
Wilber will visit a married daughter
at Dow City, Iowa.
This week Joe Garland sold a nice
piece of residence property in South
Slaton Addition to J. A. Harris, of
Aransas, who will move here In a
short time and occupy it. The deal
was handled by A. M. Watson Co.
Messrs. Joe Montgomery and Geo.
McCarty have Just returned from
Juaticeburg, where they have oil
properties and where there is much
excitement and speculation over the
prospect of bringing in a gusher in a
few days. These gentlemen are very
much pleased with thv prospect of
realising excellent returns on their
holding in the Justiceburg field, and
are making preparations to develop
a section of land they hold.
