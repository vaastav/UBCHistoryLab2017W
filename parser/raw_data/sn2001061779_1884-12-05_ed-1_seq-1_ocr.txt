THE BLOODY SHIRT.
Harrison Suow Tells How he Thinks
it Became Bloody.
JkCKum, Micii., Dec. 4. Yesterday after
ixoou Harrison Suow waput upon the stand,
who swore: (iot to the Crouch house at 7
a. m. There were but eight person there
when he arrived. Firs! examined Mr. Crouch
and fouud that he wa dead: then went into
Pulley's room and o ou to all the rooms.
He looked to if anything w missing,
but could detect nothing w rong in that re
spect. Witness was familiar with their way
of doing businet:. at Mr. Crouch', as he
had paid the old man money at different
times and Kunice White had always taken
charge of the paj-crs. The mortgage he
paid the money on wa taken from along
leather lnxk in which were a number of
other. During the time witness was at the
house he naw Dan Holcomb take this book
and the papers which it contained and put
them in his pocket. He aid the hot in Pol
ley's breast was first discovered by wit
ness. He turned down the clothes before
ho found the wound, and it was his
opinion that the shot had been tired when
the bed clothing did not cover the
breast, but it had beeia put over the body
after Policy was killed. Henry White lay on
his side and one of hi arm. was under his
wife's head. There was a number of spat
ters of blood upon the nightshirt of Henry
White, as if hit tod wa spurted over it from
an arterv and thi blood was also upon
Eunice White's face. Witness helped to
search Wlute's clotlung. also Polley's. The
only thing fouud in White's was a watch
hook that had a piece of ribbon attached to
it, while Polley had forty-five cents, a key
and a cigar in his clothing. George Holies
told witness his yarn and they went up and
looked at iho chest. Holies said he didn't
put the shirts back on the lid of the chest
after getting out in the morning. There was
a till at one end of the chest and a pile of
school books in the center, with a counter
pane over them. The chest was altout two
and one-half feet long. Witness told Holies
that he did not pass the time in the chest
tliat he said ho did, and the boy said he was
terribly scared, and if he didn't get into the
chest ho didn't kuow where he did get to.
This morning the prosecution put Snow
again upon tho stand and argued that he
was competent to give an opinion as to how
the blood came upon the clothing of Henry
White and his wife. The court allowed him
to answer and Snow said he thought the
blood came from the wound in White's
neck.
Henry S. Smith, of Clinton county, sworn:
Saw Dan Holcomb at William Holcomb's in
April and again in October, Dan said
he had been there a week. Witness made a
'drive" for deer the next day, and Dan was
going out on the lake in a boat, but backed
out, and spoke of shooting any deer that
might swim past, with a revolver he had.
This was in the morning. When witness
returned at sundown Holcomb was at
the same place, having been there all day,
and then claimed he had lost his revolver the
day before, he thought. Didn't know where
lie had lost it, but thought he did so in a
"burning." Witness never saw the pistol,
and Dan made no mention of its ioss when
they got home. Witness mentioned it to
William, but never heard Dan say anything
about the pistol being for a present to Wil
liam. Saw Holcomb up there again. He
came again two weeks afterwards, in the
night, and left at daylight the next morning.
William accompanied him. Chas. Wangei
'son had said Holcomb wauted to know if
witness had said Dan wouldn't allow Eunice's
baby to see the light, and also asked if wit
ness thought Judd could do the murder.
Said it took a cool hand and bull head to do
the job. Witness thought Judd to big a
fool, and Dan said "Judd is no fool by any
means."
Prosecutor Gibson said their side had now
got through with this branch of the case and
should go into the section connecting Judd
Crouch and James Foy with the mnrder.
The defense insisted that the prosecution
should call Dr. Williams. Gibson said Wil
liams was Holcomb's family doctor, and
they did not need him. The defense
thought the people should bo obligated by
the court to put William on, bnt the court
said he couldn't do that. Finally it was
agreed to produce the witness, but Judge
Gridley said ho didn't want to hear any
more arguments to-day as he was ill, but ho
could preside if witnesses were called.

FROM GRAVE TO GAY.
Unfortunate Independent Evolutionist
Beecher.
New Yobk, Dec. 4. When asked to-day if
he had anything to say in connection with
Frank Moulton's death. Rev. Beecher said:
I could say many kind things of Moulton,
but some things not complimentary. Then
why say anything? His hand was raised
against me, but he could not help it, he was
compelled to take the stand he did resulting
in that conspiracy against me. Moultou
held many documents that were not pro
duced. I may tell what I know some day."
"What do you think of the election and its
results?" said the reporter. Tho country
has been like muddy water stirred up; let it
alone and it will settle. The new adminis
tration must be one of progress, or in IKn? a
new party will come into jower. I am not
a Democrat and people wont let me call my
stif a Republican, so I suppose I am a
'nr titer. I am an evolutionist and I believe
in unfolding great principles and great
issue. I care not for names of parties. I
look back only when doing so helps to steer
forward." "How do you think Cleveland
will net as President?" "I don't know.
His past record has been excellent, but a man
may be a good colonel and not a good gene
ral. It is a matter of speculation. I hope
Cleveland will give nothing to Independent.
We went in for the right. A soon a dis
interestedness i taken away down goes our
independence. The principal thing I hope
to see i a revival of business in the south.
Very Suspicious.
Boston, Dec. 4. A Washington special
says the Democratic electoral colleges of
Connecticut and Maryland seem to le mi
willing to trust Vice-President Edmunds,
and have sent duplicate of their te turns to

MICHIGAN MEN.
Interviews With Thm by an "Inter
Ocean" Man.
The Chicago litter-Ocean of yesterday
contains the following go?ip on Michigan
iHjlitic:
Congressman Edward Breitung, of Negau
nee, Mich., who is at the Tremont, was
a-ked yesterday if ha believed the rumor
that Senator Conger was about to retire, and
if he himself were, as alleged, a candidate
for the heiiatorship himtlf. Mr. Breituug
replied that he did not believe that Senator
Conger intended to resign, and that ho
should regret if the senator did n., since he
considered his services of much valoe to
Michigan. As for his own ambitions in this
direction Congressman Breituug unequivo
cally declared that he was not a candidate,
and did not wi-h to become one, nor would
become one under any circumstances, for
he was too thoroughly occupied with his bus
iness interests, and did not hanker after the
honor after the honor. Speaking of thos
who were candidates for the osition, should
Senator Couger re;dgn, ho mentioned Horr
and Kutcheon as men whom he would like
to see enjoy the honor. Congressman Breit
uug expects little done in Congress aside
from the passage of the appropriation bills,
and can not anticipate the action which may
be taken in the matter of those railroad lands
in the Peninsula which were declared, by a
recent decision of the Secretary of the Inter
ior, to be forfeited to those who now hold
them under actual purchase. He fully ai
preciates the hardship which the owners
suffer if finally their titles in this land nre
not confirmed. He does not think that
either this Congress or the next will attempt
any tariff reduction; but says if Democrats
put lumber on the free list, as he thinks they
will attempt to do, that the "common" lum
ber trade of Micliigau will be entirely de
stroyed by the importation of Canadian lum
ber. As it is now he says the profit is made
from the "common" lumber but from the
"uppers," find he adds that cheaper lumber
would not be the result of free trade in this
commodity, since with Canada controlling
the market and without the competition of
home producers, she could set the price as
she pleased. As a mining man he, with
others of the Upper Peninsula, experiences
the disadvantages of the uncertainty in busi
ness circles, and says that it is a question in
Cleveland whether ore will not be delivered
nt tho lake ports at a ton for tho highest
grade, and that this reduction from 5?o.o0
will naturally come out of tho wages of the
miners and transportation.
Study of the question in Europe causes
Congressman Breitung to insist that it is
upon labor that the influences of any re
duction of the tariff by Democrats will be
felt.
Another Upper Peninsula man at the Tre
mont House yesterday, and who left for New
Orleans in the evening, was Mr. A. C. Davis,
of L'Anse, who is the Commissioner to the
World's Exposition from the Upper Penin
sula. He said that the miner's exhibit of
the Peninsula would amount to about six
tons, and that it would pass through Chicago
last evening. Mr. Davis reiorted that the
Upper Peninsula would send a very fine
State exhibit, probably the best in the world,
he thought. It comprises two varieties, and
is typical of the quality of slate from that
region, which the Supervising Architect at
Washington has pronounced superior to
Welsh slate, and therefore tho most desir
able in the world. Mr. Davis says he takes
down the finest plank that ever was made.
It is of cork pine, without sap or blemish,
from Hibbard & Th irb?r's mill, and has di
mensions oa follows: Length, 10 feet;
width, 41 inches: thickness, 4 inches. Ho
also takes some fine specimens of corn and
other cereals native to the Peninsula.

THOSE WHO READ THE MESSAGE.
Leading Citizens Interviewed by "Tel

President's Epistle.
That President Arthur's message has not
gout unread, may Ikj inferred from the
brief interviews which are given below
gathered yesterday from oar citizens by
Tti.ttiiuii reiorter$. The replies as given
are in answer to the two leading ques.
lions, rllave you read the President' Me,
huge'r" "What do jou think of it?" Want
of FjKvce forbade extending the interview
further, and want of time, from looking up
a number who were absent from their places
of busmehs.
Judge Hotmer"It is a very able and con
servative document, although I am not fully
clear as to several recommendations I find it
contains. The recommendation to reduce
the po-tnge one-half on drop letters is a good
oue, if the President knows whereof lie
speaks and I presume lie does and believe
it to be a step in the right direction."
Judge Perkins "It i a good document,
although I don't uppiove of some of his
tariff recommendations. I believe in some
changes, in raising the tariff on certain ar
ticles, and cutting them in others, but not o
much as to disoourage the idea of protec
tion." Peter Doran "Good! Good! I ee he also
lelieves in a revision of the tariff. What are
the protectionists going to do about it I won
der?" Win. T. Hess "Yes, I have read it casual
ly, and let it go at that I think it a good
document."
W. F. Balkley I have, glanced over it
casually, and have read some editorial com
ments on it. I am surprised to see it lean so
strongly toward free trade, and with that
apparent tendency I can account in a meas
ure for the late Republican disaffection and
lukewarmness; those twa elements and jeal
ousy beat Blaine. I notice Secretary McCul
loch talks of taking the tax off tobacco."
L. D. Follett "A good document, but I
don't imagine he will be strongly supported
in his views by the protection element in his
party. It convinces mo that if he had been
nominated instead of Blaine he would have
been elected."
J. W. Ransom "I have read only a
synopsis, but as I view it, it is as good a
Democratic document an I have read for
some time. It is a good safe state paper."
Alexander Hamilton "If I may be al
lowed to express my opinion, it is a strong
document and will help to inae him a great
man four years from now. It would be no
surprise to me if Mr. Arthur was on the win
ning ticket in 1888. Would it be to you?"
O. II. Godwin"I read a sjTiopsis. It is
a fairly good document and has not hurt
Arthur's reputation as a good President."
United States Marshal Monroe "A very
good state document. The best I think Mr.
Arthur has yet given to the country. It
deals with the business and state interests
of this country' without mixing in politics or
religion. I should have been much pleased
to have seen Mr. Arthur nominated and re
elected." J. M. Mctheany -"No; I just returned
from an inspecting tour over the road and
have not read it yet. I have laid it aside
with my Sunday reading."
M. C. Burch "A very wise ixnd able docu
ment, in keeping with tho clmracter of the
man."
Moses Taggart "I have not read enough
to have a very definite opinion, as far as I
have read it seems clear and concise. A
very satisfactory document"
Henry Spring "I consider it one of the
best messages I ever read. Don't find any
one that says otherwise."
J. H. Campbell "I would not read it
through for a hundred dollars. Did you ever
read one through? Don't believe I ever read
a President's message through in my life. I
generally pass it over, taking in the promi
nent features,
H. N. Moore " Yes. A good meage."
A. V. Pantlind "I have, and consider it a
good message."
Hon. G. G. Steketec "Just returned from
lansing this moment, where the electors
have jerfoiinc"d their duty."
"What wis the feeling among the elector
as to tho result, Mr. Steketec."
"Oh, of course we regretted that our action
could not elect the President"
"I believe you have been appointed to con
vey the electoral vote of thii State to Wash
ington." "Yes, I have lxen entruste-d with that
honor, nnd mut file the papers in Washing
ton by the first Wedne-day in January. I
consider the President's message an A No. 1
document."
Mr. Steketec alo intimate-d that the out
