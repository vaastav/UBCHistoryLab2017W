The Speakership Contest.
The animated contest among the Demo
cratic members of Congress in relation to
the choice of a candidate for Speaker of the
House was ended on Saturday last by the se
lection, in caucus, of the Hou. M. C. Kerr, of
Indiana, who was nominated on the third
ballot. The caucus was harmonious, and
upon Hie announcement of the vote allowing
Mr. Kerr to have a majority, the Hon. Sam
uel J. Randall, his principal opponent, mov
ed that the nomination be made unanimous,
in a conrloous and graceful speech. Hon. S.
S. Cox, of New York, was also a candidate-
Accordingly Mr. Kerr, on Monday, received
the votes of the Democratic members of the
House, and was duly elected Speaker.
His selection for this important position
means much more than the personal choice
of a favorite. Indeed, of the two men Mr.
Randall appears to have been personally
more popular than Mr. Kerr. The selection
of the latter, therefore, at the present time,
may he taken ns indicating, to some extent,
the temper and disposition of the Democrat
ic majority in Congress, and as foreshadow
ing the line of policy it is inclined to pursue.
It means, according to the able and patriotic
speech of the Hon. L. Q. C. Lamar, the chair
man of the caucus, that there will be a thor
ough and sweeping reform of the civil ser
vice of the country, “which shall be conduct
ed iu a spirit that will secure the appoint
ment to places of trust and responsibility of
the honest, Hie experienced and the capable.
It means that the administration of the
public revenue of the country will ho vigi
lantly examined; that corruption will he
ferreted out, aud wrong-doers, no matter how
high or low, shall he fearlessly arraigned and
fully exposed and punished.
It means economy in the administration of
(lie government, aud the perfection and
adoption of such a system of taxation as will
bring in the required revenue “with the few
est restrictions upon commerce aud witli the
least burden to the people, and that burden
equitably distributed aud skillfully adjust
ed.” In other words, free trade as nearly as
practicable.
It means the carrying out in good faith of
every pledge made by the government, the
payment of the national debt in full, and the
restoration of the currency of the country to
an equality with that of any nation on earth
It meaus the equal rights of all the States
and all the people, the restoration of the
Constitution to its ancient strength and au
thority, as the protector of every State and
of every individual.
In the contest for the Speakership Mr.
Randall labored under the odium of being
the favorite of Boss Shepherd and other
prominent Republicans, aud it was intimat
ed that the course of investigation as desired
by the Democratic party, would find iu him
a lukewarm supporter. On the currency
question, also, he was represented as unsound.
Whether these charges were true or not, they
nevertheless overcame Ids personal populari
ty, and enured to the benefit of his rival, Mr.
Kerr, -whose record upon all points, as a
Democrat, and whose personal honor, ability
and uprightness marked him as the proper
person to preside over the first Democratic
House of Representatives that has assembled
iu Washington for fifteen years. Let us
hope that their counsels will he guided by
moderation aud wisdom, for the benefit of
the whole country.
The Governor aud the Attorney Gener
alship.
Governor Oroome, at Annapolis, on Mon
day, rendered what is termed his.decision in
the Attorney Generalship contest between
Hon. S. Teackle Wallis and Hon. C'has. J.
M. Owinn, which practically, however,
throws the whole question into the courts
for determination. In the outset the Govern
or disposes of the jmma fans case—that is,
he decides, on Hie basis of the returns of
election as made through the clerks of the
courts, that Mr. Gwinn was duly elected on
the 3d of November last, and that Mr. Gwinn
was also duly qualified to hold the office of
Attorney General’
So far it is all clear enough. But the Govr
cruor proceeds to question his power unde
Section 3 of Article 5 of the constitution to
fake testimony outside the returns, or decide
the election otherwise Ilian upon those re
turns. He considers that the construction
of the constitution in this particular is so
close and serious a matter as to require the
decision of the judiciary, aud he therefore
concludes to withhold a commission from Mr.
Gwinn for the office, aud Huts places upon
Mr. Gwinn the onus of instituting proceed
ings against the Governor by mandamus to
compel the issuing n commission to him as
the Attorney General elect according to the
returns.
On a hearing of this application for man
damus, if it he entertained, there wilt he a
judicial construction of the Stale constitu
tion in the premises which will define the
Governor’s authority iu like case. But the
Governor says that iu absence of Mr. Owinu’s
prompt movement iu the contest he will pro
ceed to take testimony in the matter outside
official returns, notwithstanding the con
struction of the matter as to his constitu
tional powers in the case is, as he says, so
“close and serious.” The Governor in some
supplemental remarks staled that lie lias se
lected to represent him Hun. A. B. Hagncr,
of Annapolis, that gentleman having hitherto
represented Mr. Wallis’s position iu the con
test, and the Governor considering that in
the apparent houleversement of the case Mr.
Wallis assumes a position in which the Gov
ernor will he a party with him in any case
fur mandamus or injunction asked for by Mr.
Gwinn, the latter gentleman having a right
as evidently anticipated by the Governor, to
ask lor an injunction to prohibit the Govern
or from taking testimony in the absence of
mandamus proceedings in the case.
The Governor urges that as ids answer
must be filed at an early period all legal for
malities should he waived, aud an agreement
entered into witli Mr. Gwinn’s counsel that
the courts having jurisdiction in the prem
ises be allowed to at once hear and adjudi
cate the case. In authorizing Mr. Hagncr
to appear fur Idm he is subject to instructions
contained in the decision. —Baltimore Bun.
—Boss Tweed, New York’s great crimi
nal, has, for a time at least, eluded justice,
by flight. Although nominally in Jail, he
was allowed many privileges, such as visiting
his home, iu charge of an officer, &c. Last
Saturday he went home, and obtaining per
mission to have a private interview with Ids
wife, he departed and lias not been heard of
since. The trial of the six million dollar
suit against him fordelramlingthe Treasury
of New York was to have commenced on
Monday. Ten thousand dollars reward has
been offered fur his capture.
General Babcock Indicted.— The grand
jury of the U. 8. District Court at Bt. Louis
; has indicted General O. E. Babcock, Presi
; dent Grant’s private Secretary, for complici
i ty in the whisky frauds against (lie internal
revenue, whereby the government was rob
, bed of millions of dollars. When the charg
i cs against Babcock were first made in the
1 newspapers, he protested his innocence, and
r asked for the appointment by the President
[ of a military court, to inquire into the mnt
( ter. The President accordingly appointed
Gen. P. H. Sheridan, Gen. W. S. Hancock
and Gen. O. H. Terry, with instructions to
( meet at Chicago on the !>lli hist., investigate
i the case, and give their opinion of the mat
| ter. In the meantime the grand jury, from
the evidence before them, found a true hill
i against General Babcock, and lie will douht
! less he tried, and if found guilty will suffer
j the penally of the law, without regard to the j
j finding of the military court. The decision j
of the latter, if adverse to Babcock, will only
1 affect his standing as an army officer. The
offence being of a civil nature, the action of
the St. Louis courts will not he impeded by
that of the military hoard. If the Presi
dent’s famous declaration, “Let no guilty
man escape,” is strictly carried out, the proba
bilities are that Babcock will he called upon
to "step down aud out,” and President
Grant will want another private Secretary.

The President’s Message. —President
Grant’s message to the 44th Congress is an
extremely lengthy document, and abounds in
suggestions startling to Congress and the
people. The main feat ure of the message,
perhaps, is the school question. It recom
mends a constitutional amendment com
pelling the States to establish and forever
maintain free public schools; that education
may he compulsory so far ns to deprive all
persons who cannot read and write from be
coming voters after 1890. Such a measure
would he an unauthorized interference witli
the right of each State to regulate its own
internal affairs, and a hold step towards a
centralized despotism, which would in the
end blot out all freedom of action in the
States, making them in all things subservient
to the government at Washington.
The message favors, also, the taxation of
all church property, exempting only' burial
places “and possibly, with proper restric
tions, church edifices.” Upon this point be
is a long ways ahead of previous advocates
of such a measure. It is regarded, in some
quarters, as a yielding In the ultra radical
element that scoffs at all religion, and as an
attempt to bring into national politics the
question of religious proscription of a certain
body of Christians. The message is really
nothing hut a campaign document, intended
to advance Grant’s chances for third term.
The Forty-fourth Congress.— The first
session of the Forty-fourth Congress was
commenced at Washington on Monday.—
The House organized by the election of offi
cers chosen by the Democratic caucus on
. Saturday. Mr. Kerr, for Speaker, received
173 votes. His opponent, on the Republi
can side, was cx Speaker Blaine, who re
ceived 100 votes. The other officers arc as
follows ; Clerk, George M. Adams, of Ken
tucky ; Sergeant at-Arms, John G. Thomp
son, of Ohio; Doorkeeper, Lafayette 11.
Pilzhugli, of Texas; Postmaster, .Tames M.
Stewart, of Virginia ; Chaplain, Rev. J. L.
Townsend, of District of Columbia.
The Senate was called to order by the Hon.
T. W. Ferry, President pro tempore. Presi
dent Grant being officially informed of the
organization of Congress, by a joint com
mittee of the Senate and House, sent his !
message, which was read. A synopsis of it I
is printed to-duv.
Death op Charles 8. Aiiell. Mr.
Charles S. Abell, third son of A. S. Abell,
Esq., proprietor of the Baltimore Sun, died
at the family residence, “Guilford,” near Bal
timore, on Friday morning last, of typhoid
fever, after a short illness. Mr. Abell had
been in delicate health for some time previ
ous, and spent Inst winter in Florida. While
there his letters to the Sun, under the signa
ture “Sac,” formed a very pleasant feature
iu that journal, being sprightly and enter
taining in an unusual degree. Mr. Abell
was talented and possessed every attribute
which could make him dear to his relatives
j and friends. His early death, therefore, has
caused the deepest sorrow in the family cir
cle and among his friends.

Transfer Pictures. — The decorations on car- j
riages, buggies, sleighs, furniture, boxes, &c.i
and other painted surfaces, often show the most
delicate artistic skill, aud the question arises,
how are such views and ornaments placed
there without great expense? The cheapest
articles arc frequently covered with bits of
landscape or floral decorations that could not
he painted by band without increasing Hie value
of the articles. The secret is, these paintings
are transferred to the articles adorned by a pro
cess called “Decalcomanie.” When the method
was first discovered high prices were charged
for the transfer pictures, and also for teaching
the art, so that few could afford to purchase.
Recently, however, dealers have reduced the
rates so that now these pictures may be obtain
ed at comparatively low cost. J. L. Patten <k
Co., lU3 William Street, New York, arc large
dealers iu these goods. For Hie small sum of
leu cents they will send complete instructions,
with catalogue and ten specimen pictures, to
a iy one who wishes to learn this beautiful art.
—Of the 44Ut Congress, there arc in the
House, 177 Democrats, 101 Republicans, 5
Liberal Republicans, 4 Independent Repub
licans, 4 Reformers, and one vacancy. The
Democratic majority is 03. The Republican
majority in the last Congress was 105. In
the Senate there are 43 Republicans,39 Demo
crals, 3 Independents, anil one vacancy. Re
publican majority 11. The Republican ma
jority in the last Congress was 31.
The President’s Message.
President Grant, in his seventh annual
message, sent to Congress on Tuesday, in
dulges in some pleasant mention of the ad
vancement of our country from its infancy
to its centennial, and of the nation’s great
success in progress and civilization ; of its
wonderful achievements iu arts, science and
all the concomitants of advanced betterment
of all the people. And in tills connection he
urges Hint all citizens should he educated
sufficiently to east a vote with right intelli
gence of the value of the elective franchise,
which is a proposition no reasonable perton
will question, though it was not acted upon
in the reconstruction policy of the President’s
own party. The absence of such educated
intelligence is, the President thinks, the pri
mal danger to our country’s prosperity and
the permanence of Us free institutions, and
in such belief lie recommends an amendment
to the constitution requiring the several States
to establish and forever maintain free public
schools adequate to, nt least, the rudiment
i ary education of all Hie children, irrespective
of color, sex, nationality or religion ; forbid
ding, however, the teaching in such schools
the inculcation of pagan nr atheistic tenets,
, or the bestowal of school funds to any rcli
. giotis denominations for educational pur
’ poses. He also objects to the accumulation
’ of vast amounts of untaxed church property,
- and says that that class of property in Hie
■ United Stales in 1875 amounts to (1,000,000,-
, 000. He recommends the taxation of all
, such property, exempting only cemeteries
and limited edifices for churches.
These subjects have always in this coun
try heretofore been regarded ns belonging
( peculiarly to the State and local governments
and at no time have they received more gen
-1 oral and willing attention in the States Ilian
nt present.
Stating that our relations with foreign
powers are satisfactory and friendly, the
President takes occasion to remark that Con
gress should so legislate ns to prohibit citi
zens of the United States from owning slaves
iu any other country, and he hopes such eon
summation may ultimately embrace citizens
of all nations.
Chili has made reparation in some long
standing cases of outrage on our commercial
marine. Mention is made of the Hawaiian
reciprocity treaty, and of the Virginias in
demnity, which lias been settled by Spain.
In regard to Cuba, the President thinks
there is no evidence of a near termination of
Hie conflict there, and that there still exists
that continuous disregard of laws, civilized
warfare and humanity which has character
ized internecine strife during the past sev
en years. He adverts to the commercial im
portance of Cuba to the world at large, and
asserts Ids belief that Hie nations have a right
to interfere sufficiently to establish its gov
ernment on a secure basis, hut he considers
j Hie recognition of Cuban independence im
! practicable at present, and lie believes Hie
| United Stales and all other nations must
1 soon consider the necessity of mediation and
intervention in Hie premises, A considera
ble portion of Hie message is devoted to this
subject.
He indorses the recommendations made in
the annual report of the Secretary of War,
including a system of annuities for families
of deceased officers by funding a monthly
deduction from Hie pay of those officers
while in service; a return to Hie old system
of mileage; an approval of torpedo experi
ments, and a permanent organization of Hie
signal service corps.
The condition of Hie navy is staled as be
ing satisfactory. It does not contain much
iron cruising power, hut it has a considerable
number of iron clads of the monitor class,
which, though not cruisers, are of excellent
effect for operations on our coast and for safe
defence of our harbors. The navy includes
more than fifty war ships, fifteen of them be
ing iron clad.
In referring to Postoffice Department af
fairs, the President recommends Hie exclu
sion from the mails of merchandise of all
kinds, and the limitation of transportable
matter therein only to those articles which
should he properly classed ns amilnhle.
The President says that although govern
ment efforts to protect the rights of Indians
in Hie Black Hills have been successful, the
next year will exhibit a large increase of
immigration thither. The condition of the
Indian Territory is practically unchanged,
but the President may hereafter make some
suggestions ns to legislation for the govern
ment of that Territory.
The grasshopper plague is supposed to
i have diminished Hie sale of public lands du
ring Hie year, there being a decrease in Hie
I sales of 3,459,001 acres as compared with
those of the previous year. The surveyed
area of public domain is 080,353,094 acres
leaving 1,154,471,703 acres yet to he surveyed!
The management and disposition of this vast
farm of “Uncle Sam” are recommended to
the careful consideration of Congress.
As to pensioners, the message stales Hint du
ring the past year 11,557 names have been add
ed to the payrolls and 12,977 dropped, show
ing a decrease of 1,430 pensioners. But not- 1
withstanding this decrease of pensioners I here I
has been an increase in pay to Hie amount of
(44,738.18, which was induced by the great- 1
ly increased average rate of pensions allow- !
ed by the last Congress. During Hie last
fiscal year there was paid for account of J
pensions (29,083,110. There arc on the roils
334,831 persons, of whom 210,303 are army
pensioners, (of these 105,478 being invalids.) i
and 104,885 arc widows and dependent relit- |
lives. The navy pensioners are 9,420, in
cluding 1,030 invalids and 1,784 widows and '
dependent relatives. Of the war of 1813
there are 21,038 pensioners, 15,875 being sur
vivors and 5,143 widows. The amount re
quired for payment of pensions for the next
fiscal year is estimated at (29,535,000.
The President thinks his Indian policy has I
been prosecuted with encouraging and satis
factory results ns to Hie improvement of the
race, aud lie says the same policy will he
continued with such modifications as may he
deemed proper.
As to Hie centennial exhibition the Presi
dent thinks that as it is to he an internation
al affair, to which the United States govern
ment is only a voluntary contributor, its
contribution should ho large enough to sus
tain the dignity of the United States in such
a contingency. He says that almost without
exception Hie powers of Europe, the South
j American States, aud even Hie far-off East-
I ern sovereignties have taken steps to ho rep
resented in Hie centennial exhibition.
The President recommends the formation
of a special tribunal for hearing and determ
ining ail claims of aliens against the govern
ment of the United States which now exist
or may hereafter arise outside of treaty stipu
lations.
The question as to monopoly aud exorbi
tant charges on the Atlantic telegraphic ca
ble lines is given to the earnest consideration
of Congress, aud in absence of action by that
body the President will not approve the
landing of cables proposed to he laid by
competing companies.
The frauds in naturalization aud expatria
tion are severely commented on, and pre- i
ventive legislation asked. It is also suggest- i
ed that there is necessity of enactment in re- i
latiou to Hie status of American women who
may marry foreigners, and of defining Hie
{ condition of children of American parents
I horn in foreign countries, so ns to give legal
j effect to marriages of American citizens ef
| fccted in foreign countries.
As to resumption of specie payments the
President will heartily approve any practi
cable measures to that end that may he
adopted by Congress. He thinks unlimited
inflation would bring about specie payments
more quickly than a law looking to redemp
tion of legal-tenders in coin, hut this would
he at the expense of national honor. He
recommends a repeal of so much of the legal
tender act as makes such notes receivable
for debts contracted after January, 1877,
The Mexican robberies and cattle-liftings
in the Free Zone, adjoining Texas, arc al
luded to, with Hie admission Hint the mili
tary force of our government available for
service nt that point is inadequate to guard
the line even at the places where raiding in
cursions arc most frequent.
The bureau of agriculture has dissemina
ted much useful knowledge to agriculturists,
and lias introduced new and probably useful
productions to our soil, and the President I
thinks the bureau worthy of continued en- j
couragement by the government.
The Mormons arc visited with a short
but positive rod. The President thinks
Mormon ism should he banished from the
land of Utah by punishing it as n crime. He
thinks similarly in regard to the importation
of Chinese women for infamous (im poses.
It is recommended in view of Hie Presi
dent’s own observations iu visits to the Ter
ritories, that existing laws iu relation to the
disposition of public lauds and Hie mining
interests be carefully amended, so ns to pro
tect and assist the enterprising pioneers who
arc to do so much for Hie development of
the Western wilds. He suggests Hint joint
committees of Congress he sent to examine
into these subjects.
In conclusion the President refers to this
as the last annual message lie will transmit
to Congress before his successor is chosen,
aud sums up into five propositions Ids views
on requiring the States to give common school
education, making it compulsory aud without
sectarianism ; for keeping Church and Stale
separate; for driving out licensed immorali
ty, and enacting laws for a speedy return .to
a sound currency .—Baltimore Bun.
Local Affairs.
Little Locals ;
—Jacob Minnick, Sr., an old and well
known citizen of Harford county, died nt
his home, at the Hickory, on Wednesday
afternoon.
—The petit jury were finally discharged
on Thursday afternoon of last week, and
court adjourned from day to day, being oc
cupied iu hearing arguments iu equity cases,
&e.
—The Havre Cornet Band gave their first
public exhibition in Hie Town Hall on Tues
day evening of last week, for the benefit of
Hie M. E. Church. Some of the members,
says Hie Republican , have made wonderful
progress and exhibit great natural musical
talent. The hand is composed of sixteen
pieces.
—On last Friday morning aliont half-past r
five oVlock, a fire broke out in the bar room £
at Dunly’s, (formerly Dampman's) tavern, t
on I lie Harford Turnpike, seven miles from r
llel Air. It was extinguished without much f
loss. \
—Some seventy-five or one hundred feet i 1
of the embankment of the Susquehanna (
Canal, near Hock Hun, was swept out on 1
Friday night, 20lh nit., by the flood in Deer I
Creek, caused by the heavy rain of that day. (
The break has since been repaired, and navi
gation resumed. i i
—A few days ago a man who was shoot- -
ing ducks from Gunpowder Bridge, on the!
P., W. and 11. Hailroad, carelessly laid Ids |
gun across the track, and a train approach- i
ing lie forgot to remove it. The train ran .
over Hie gun, smashing it to pieces, and also 1
came near being thrown off the bridge by ’
the obstruction.

Boots and Shoes.—Our renders will find 1
at Mr. J. Benj. Ely s, No. 170 N. Gay street, '
corner of Exeter, a full assortment of boots
and shoes, of the latest styles, and at prices !
to suit the times. His stock embraces every- J
thing in his line that can be desired for any |
member of the family, and he fully sustains, f
in the quality of his work, the reputation of '
this old-established house. Head his adver- j
liscment on our first page. j
j
Baiin Buiined.—On Thursday night of
last week a now barn belonging to Hubert 1
Little, situated in the fifth district,near Cas- J
tlcton, was entirely destroyed by fire. Two ,
horses, two mules, three colts, a quantity i
of grain, fodder, hay, straw, harness, gears,
and some farming utensils, were consumed j
in the fire. The building was insured in the
Farmers’ Insurance Company, of York, Pa.,
for SI,OOO, Mr. Lillie’s loss, it is stated, 1
will be heavy, as there was no insurance J
upon the contents of the barn. ,
PosTI’OHMENT OF THE DIi.UOCII ATIO ,
Meeting.—The general meeting of the f
Democratic parly of the State, called for i
Wednesday night, at the Maryland Institute j
Baltimore, was postponed until December 1
14th, mainly at the request of a number of
- from the counties, who desired to
attend and'were prevented from doing so
on account of the inclemency of the weather.
It is expected that there will he a good at
tendance of Democrats from different por- j
lions of the State, and that the action to be | ]
taken will be of great importance to the j
party.
* • ... ; i
The Bu.timoiie and Haufoud Tubs- i
j pike.—A meeting of committees appointed
| by the several farmers’ clubs ol the county
| will be held at the Court House, on Salur
! day, the 18th instant, at 13 o’clock, M., to' 1
discuss the present deplorable condition of j c
the above-named turnpike, and to lake such !
action in relation to the matter ns will com-1
pel its owners to place it in good repair.— j
Complaints are annually made against this j
road, and under the threat of an appeal to
the courts a spasmodic effort is made to mend
the road. The complaints then cease for a
time, until public attention is again called to
its condition. This road constitutes the
great thoroughfare over which a large por
tion of the produce of Harford and Balti
more counties is conveyed to market, and our
farmers arc not unreasonable in demanding
that in return for the tolls exacted the road
should be a better one than if it were merely
a county road.
Attacked nv Highwaymen.—On Thurs
day of last week two colored men, Charles
Dorsey and James Helmsly, in the employ of
Mr. J. J. Chapman,of Baltimore county, were
returning from Baltimore over the Harford
Turnpike, with a team and wagon. Near
the Eight Mile House, Dorsey, the driver,
noticed in the woods a horse attached to a
light express wagon, and four men walking
back and forth ns if they were waiting for
someone. Dorsey turned his team into the
road leading across to the old Bel Air toad,
when two of the men started after him. He
paid little attention to the circumstance, but
turning casually around to look at them, he
suddenly received a severe blow in the
mouth, which cut his lip, the men at same
lime demanded his money. Dorsey was scat
ed on the lazy board at the lime, his compan
ion being asleep in the wagon. He jumped
down hastily and laid about him so stoutly
that the ruffians retreated. Helmsly pro.
longed his nap until the robbers were out of
sight, leaving to Dorsey the danger ns well
as tlie glory of the fight.
Horrible Accident—a Man Crushed
to Death.—Owing to the break in the
Susquehanna Canal at Rock Run, from the
storm of Friday, Nov. 261 h, a large number
of boats were detained, both above and below
that point. The repairs having been finish
ed, on Sunday the boats began to move. As
Capt. Thomas Hoofmaster’s boat was as
cending tlie canal, Sunday afternoon,ayoung
man, a stranger to the captain, came on board
at Bell’s Ferry, and engaging in conversation
told the captain he. was himself a boatman,
&e. About one o’clock in the afternoon as
the boat was about entering the lock near
Conowingo Bridge, she accidentally struck
one side of the lock. At this moment the
stranger was engaged in casting off the line.
! The sudden jar threw him off his balance and
he fell over the side of the vessel. He mana
ged to grasp the gunwale, however, as he
fell. Before he could climb to the deck he
was caught between the boat and the lock
and crushed most horribly. Tlie bowsman
sprang to his assistance and dragged him on
to the deck. He was carried ashore and
taken into the office of Joseph Ross, at
Conowingo. Drs. 11. Clay Whiteford, David
Riley and R. 11. Archer ofHarford county,
| and tlie Drs. Rowland, of Cecil, were all sent
1 for. ll was found that the young man’s legs
I and the lower part of his body were crushed
| into an almost shapeless mass. Everything
| possible was done for him, but he died at 8
o’clock Sunday night. He is believed to
have been a young man named Cox, of
Harrisburg, Pa. lie was about twenty-four
years of age.
Dead Body Found.—On Sunday morn
| ing, about ten o’clock, some colored boys
j discovered the dead body of a white man
in the race of Reckord’s Mill, on the Har-
I ford Turnpike, a short distance from the
bridge over the Little Gunpowder. Justice
Burton was notified, the body taken out and
an inquest held. The verdict of the Jury was
that the man had died while in a fit. In the
pockets of the deceased were found a letter
addressed to Robert Hamilton, Eager street,
four doors from Bond street, Baltimore.—
There was also found a handkerchief, a pipe,
a knife, five cents in money and other small
articles The deceased, it was ascertained,
I had been seen passing the mill late Saturday
! evening, going-in the direction of Baltimore.
' It is supposed that he afterwards turned
back, and got into the field bordering on
the falls, near the turnpike. Losing his
way in (he darkness It is thought that in
wandering about he accidentally fell over
the hank, a depth of eight feet, into the
race. The shock, n = doubt, brought on the 1 j
fit, which caused bis dooth. He appeared to
bo about 35 or 40 years of age. An exami
nation was made by Dr. J. IV. Burton, who
gave it as his opinion that the man had died
while in a fit. A number of medals, a cross, \
&c., were found about his person, indi
cating that ho was a member of several
Roman Catholic societies. Accordingly the j
body was taken in charge by members of a I
Catholic church in the neighborhood.
All doubts in regard to his identity were
removed by the following advertisement in ,
Monday’s Sun:
' "Robert Hamilton wandered from home on
Friday night last, height five feet and eight
inches, dark hair and moustache, light coat,
light pants, black slouch hat, long boots.- ]
Any information will be thankfully received ;
by Ids distressed parents, 174 Stirling street,
or 374 East Eager si. George Hamilton.”
Mr. Q. A. Carlisle at once telegraphed to j
the distressed parents the fact of finding the
body, and it was sent for on Monday night, i
The Sun says: | ]
Deceased, who was a laborer, was married,
and leaves two children and a wife, with j
whom he lived at No. 8 Barnet street, until j
a few months ago, when, being without era- ! -
ployment, the children and wife went to re
side with her mother, on Bond street, near
Burnet, and lie to live with his mother. He
was twenty-eight years of age, and for six
years had been subject to epilepsy, which, to- 1
getlicr with being out of employment for the
past four months,- preyed ou his mind. On
Tuesday last he had nine convulsions, fol- J
lowed on Wednesday by five or six more,
during which he received severe cuts and
bruises about the face from fulling. Friday
night after supper he left home in a hurried
manner, without stating where he was going, i ■
and not returning on Saturday, search was ’
instituted. His family and friends arc sorely t
distressed over the unfortunate occurrence.

The ground was white with snow for a short

In the North Eastern Slates there was a change

From 4 below to 18 below was the general range
through the New England States.
Tlie 30th was tlie coldest November day in

The temperature of August, September and
October, was much below the mean for these
months; a generally milder temperature for
November has raised anticipations of a more
moderate winter than last, but safe skating on
the first day of December does not seem to
range with such conjectures. General destitu
