of prisoners of war, and tnaJe a speech denouncing
the policy <>f the government, saying that it was
only designed to perpetuate the party power of
the administration. Senators Hale and Lane replied

Tile Crisis of tlie Country?Who Is to he
Onr Next President 1
Wo arc at I ho threshold of the next Presidential
campaign, upon the issue of which will depend
the restoration, reconstruction or destruction
of the Union and our popular institutions.
The people of th Ioy.il States, therefore, may
j well begin to discuss, consider and act upon
j the ull-'iuportant question, who is to be our
next President?
The present administration is engineering for
another term of office; but Mr. Lincoln, his
Cabinet, his met Congress, his present Congress,
so utr, ami the clique of fanatical politi- !
cians by which Cabinet and Congress have been |
und are controlled, have signally failed to meet |
the just and reasonable expectations of tl.e i
country. In a word, the present administration |
has proved u deplorable tailurc. The time at j
length has come when its merits and demerits !
may be ffoely d sciissed in reference to the sue- j
cession. We have, down to this day. generously
labored to strengthen the bands of the Preei
dent, to apo'og ze lor or explain uway his mistakes
and delinquencies, to give hint good advice,
and to encourage him in well doing
by constantly keeping before his eyes j
the illlniit Able torces ana resources
at his command, and the imperishable glory
within hia reach from their faith:ul employment.
We Lave stood by biin through all the
dark days of the war; but now that the robolI
lion ia fairly within his grasp, and when the
I next l'rc8:dency is coming info the foreground,
Mr. Lincoln cannot complain if, as an aspirant
for another term, he ia rigidly judged according
to his deserts.
We say, then, that his administration has
proved a failure, including hia official advisers,
his measures of legislation, and his couduct of
the war. Ilis Cubiuet, discordant and incompetent,
lius been u failure from the beginning.
Seward has proved to be only a romantic
dreamer, Chase a bold and duiigerous financial
experimentalist, Stanton a mad bull iu a china
shop, and Welles a veritable Rip Van Winkle,
sleeping at his post. As for Rlair, Bates and
Usher, tbey may be passed over as of little account
one way or the other. Of all the members
of the administration, according to the
late official report of General Ilalleck, the President
himself is the individual most directly
responsible for our military failures. General
Iluruside's Fredericksburg disaster, for instance,
and General Hooker's deplorable campaign to
Cbuncellorsvillo and back, are among the consequences
of Mr. Lincoln's experiments as a
military genius. Hut the fanatical and rapacious
abolition elements of the couutry, which
through Congress and the Cabinet have controlled
the councils, advised the measures and
dictated the policy of the administration, are
the malign influences which have roost lamentably
damaged its reputation and its prospects.
What, th?n, are we to do? Is it not apparent
that this administration is now more intent
upon securing the approaching Presidential
election than the suppression of the rebellion?
Does it not secin to be the policy of the party
in power rather to prolong the war, in order
the more surely to exclude the rebellious
States from the Presidential eleotlon? At this
into, what other course to peace and reunion,
and from national bankruptcy and financial
chaos, can the people pursue than the election
of a new administration, upon a new platform,
uud under a new popular organization, wholly
Independent of either of the corrupt and reckless
political parties of the day? Wo contend
that there is no other course by which wo can
insure the national safety. Nor can a movement
of this sort prevail except under the
standard of a military hero, whose achievements
in this war render hiin stronger than are
the financial and fanatical powers of the administration.
And who ie the warlike hero whose personal
popularity thus overshadows all the politicians
and parties of the day, and even the administration
itself? General Grant is the man. Let
the independent masses of the people, who
have had enough of thoir despicable managing
party politicians, and thoir horrible,bloody and
destructive work, proceed at once*to bring out
General Grant ae their Presidential candidate,
and they will sufely cut out the politicians, set
aside the incompetent and blundering administration,
end darry the day. Thus we shall a+
cupe ^dian at tbe^eel ^ alters who cap an?
will tpee.liiy brmgtne wa/ to an ehd, ahd a
i man, (oo, from whom we may expect a new
. and betuh* ordot of things In ^he work of re
storing the aruj securing the national
> treasury and the country agsin.-it a ruinoui
financial collapse.
' | Wo therefore call upoa the independent
ma?<>es of the people, without reference to partj
t i di tinctlons, but who arc anxious for peace, ro
union and financial security, to take the 1ea<]
j and Ibo whip hand for the next Presidency. un

TIM CknaptHk* Duty Ol
the H?t, Otp?rlBi?*ti
The Chesapeake piracy la, perhaps, the
most daring und atrooioua on reoord,
and it behooves the government to take
i precautionary measures tg ftn)r
more similar occurrences. The duty of the
Navy Departinont iu this matter is plain
and simple, and had Mr. Welles heeded bur
warnings some mouths ago the Chesapeake
would havo been erp this retaken, and the vessel
restored to her rightful ownors. We recommended
long ago that one or p>ore of the fust
est vessels in the navy be stationed at New
York, Boston, Philadelphia and Hampton
Roads, with banked fires, ready to start ut fifteen
Minutes' notice, so thut in event of a pri- t
vatoer appearing iu close proximity to our
Coast this fast fleet could be despatched as soon
as the news was received of her being in this#
vicinity, or, iu a case like the Chesapeake, it
would not be twenty-four hours or more hefore
any vessels could bo sent in pursuit. Commanding
officers at the navy yards do their
duty promptly and faithfully, and ulways on
receipt of news of a character which would lie
likely to call for a fleet of cruisers do their
utmost to prepare them in advance of any
orders from Washington.
The seizure of the Chesapeake, and the faet
xnut lucre are otner piratical parties only wait- {
iiig an opportunity to seize other vessels, leail t
us to believe that either the Alabama, Kappa
bannock, or some other English privateer 1111- N
der rebel colors, will soon tnake her appearance
on our ooast, as did the (
Piorida when the Tacony made her raid upon j
our fishermen and coaBters. The Department
must remember that the Portlanders captured
the Tacony pirates?and perhaps they will re- j
! capture theCh supcake?and that it is the duty j
of Mr. Welles to see if his vessels cannot overc
haul and take something also. In future something
can be accomplished provided the
Navv Department will take our advice and J
station a special fleet, as we have suggested,
which cuu operate?as in the opinion of every (
man who knows anything about the subject? j
very efficiently in cases such as we have mou- o
tionod.
While in search of a vessel along our coast, p
let the commanding officers of the cruisers bo
instructed to call at certain seacoast telegraph n
signal stations, ami thus obtain the latest ino
formation respecting the movements of the vessols
they are in search of. If the Navy Depart- ^
liient would show some of the common souse ^
disnlaved liv nrivate cornoriitions or intolli
gent individual?, it might accompliuh some- J "
iliinir which would he a credit to the navy and
% a
the country. ^
CtisNKit vi. Sickles at Gkttyswho.?General I;
Ilalleck's report is in some souse a Beries of p
assaults. Nearly every one mentioned comes ti
in for a blow, and the President for the heavi- c
est share. That uppears to be all right. But ti
in his assaults on generals it seems possi- a
ble that the General-in-Chief, as he often h
speaks ' without data," muy sometimes speak r
without knowledge. We gave yesterday in our ji
Washington news a statement in positive con- V
trudtction of what he says about the peninsula s
expedition of Gcuoral Dlx. In his account of u
I the Gettysburg battle General lialleoU directly y
charges General Sickles with -'an eirnr that c
nearly proved fatal." Gonoral Hallocfctv posi- \
tfon ought to give great importance to eucb a p
churge; yet if General Halleck is a man who b
speaks liastily upon subjects of which be knows r
but little, no dignity of position caff give im- c
portance to any charges that he may make. a
What, then, does General Halleck know about t
the Gettysburg battle? He knows that there ?
was a battle; but he does not know bow many Q
troops we had engaged there; he does not L
know the order in which the several corps of t
our army arrived on the field, though he pre- a
tends to tell; he does not know the positions t
given to our cerps as they came up; be does t
not know how eur line of battle was formed; f
and be does not know what corps went in on a
the left of the Third corps on Thursday after- i
noon, and so came in for the dreadfully hard j
part of that day's fight. From this it seems 1
I mil DC Known Ycrj uuiv ?uuut iuu unviirj nuu
yet he assumes to speak pa to what "nearly
proved fatal." Such a charge should, perhaps, 1
not be received as a creditable imputation i
against General Sickles; but we are not sure \
that that soldier does not owe it to a well |
earned reputation to demand a court of in- \
quirj- i
orknino or tub Prbsidknti^l Camp awn.? 1
The politicians in and out of Congress have '
commenced their pipelaylng for the Preaiden- '
cy, and are busy pulling the wires to control '
the national nominating conventions of next
year. The documents put forth in the shape of
absurd reports of the oflkials at Washington
conclusively show that the politicians at the
national capital are unable to comprehend
the events of the times, or grapple with
t!-.e mighty issues of the war in a manner
that will bring about an early reunion of the
States. Un toe uwer nanu, me political parties
have all been annihilated by the people at the
polio. The election in this State wan not a
triumph of the republicans, but a defeat. The
republican party was used up, tbo Albany Regency
smashed, mid, with Tammany and Mozart
repudiated, not one of these factions has any
moral strength. The people arc tired of the intrigues
of the politicians and look with distrust
upon all their operations.
What then must be done? The only question
la, will the people remain inactive until the
politicians again have them in their power ?
No porson but the designing politician Imagines
that any party baa a particle of strength
in theee revolutionary time*. This is the
time for the public to move. Party politics
is now in * state of chaos. The hour has
arrived for the people to move in their iodividua!
capacity and bring forward their candid
atee without regard to the politicians. We
therefore recommend* that public meetings be
held In every ward and township throughout
the loyal Statee, for the purpoee of nomlnating
their favorite candidates for the Presidency.
The sooner these meetings are held
the Vtt^r. Subscription papers should i>e circulated
at once, aod, as soon as enough signatures
are obtained, hold the meeting and trot
out a candidate. All persons who desire to
unite is n movement of this kind, in favor of
1 General U. S. Grant, will And an opportunity
to sign their names to a paper recommending
1 that a meeting be beld in this city for the pur'
pose of nominating that gallant and eflli lent
. general by calling at the Mmui.d office. Who
I will move first T

Tun lil-ooxauk ok 'Jilt I'llll. All aimonltion

received repeatedly, from some of our most respectable
citizens* including miny ladies, communication#
complaining in bitter terms of
tbe mud t?nd rubbish blockade that fenfcbmpusaes
tbe southerly aud piptieulprlj the Fifth
avenue entrance# to the iy-k. So urgent
were some or the cAMpla nts that we despatched
a reporter to the objectionable locality, and his
impressions are given in another columu. It
appears that the grievances complained of actually
exist, and that a corrective is demanded,
and it should be applied as promptly as
possible.
The present system of laying the water maiiiH
seems to occupy too much ground at one
time, liore is an extent or some eight blocks,
through the utaiu and moat elegant avenue in
lite citv to (lie l'arli. in which the street has
been excavated, and but a few sections of the
[>ipe laid, leaving all the balance of the apace
filled with rubbish, blockh of rock and atone
?nd heap* of gravel and dirt, rendering a passage
by that thoroughfare to the chief aoulhery
Park entrance almost a matter of impossibility
with any idoa of personal comfort or of
;he safety of a vehicle. This route being pracically
closed, vehicles and equestrians going
;o the l'urk seek other uvonues, and through
nud sometimes knee deep they Anally manage
o get inside, and the mud becomes more and
nore "vcrdiint" and of greater depth and coheiveness
with the passage of every vehiclo.
This plan of laying water pipes and of disurblng
'public thoroughfares is all wrong,
t is true it is common to American cities, and
night be called an " American institution''
vcre it not essentially an American nuisance.

rlieu it ia necessary to close a main ono tor relaira
or any other purpose, or the repairs
re so regular uud gradual that vehicles
re not at all inconvenienced, no more than is
lie transit of a railway car upon a well estabished
road because a few rails happen to be
ut of place or out of order and require relacing.
Why cannot the Hume plan be alopt
d here? In Hurope it would be deemed
lmost as outrageous to close up for months the

t a large city as it would be in America to
f>p a railway train to repair a damage that
ad long been foreseen. There would be no
elp for a railway corporation that should be
uilty of exhibiting such a want of" foresight
ml iiiudence in this countrv. Thou whv
hould our principal thoroughfares be blocked
p with not ho good a reason to explain it? The
ict is, it is owing to a want of the exercise of
roper vigilance on the part of the chief paries
who tiave the business in hand. In this
use the inconvenience is clearly chargeable
9 the Croton Aqueduct Hoard, who havo
Mowed the work to progress in the manner it

or because they are wilfully blind to the

VoiXYimuNO Committbk.?The Supervisors'
Volunteering Committee is still progressing
with its affairs with success. The arrangement
lrgcd upon the War Department from tho fust
by the committee, to appoint for its exclusive
use, at its rooms, a mustering in ofllcer, surgeon,
Ac., has, after a month's cogitation, been
allowed. The importance of this plan .was well
understood by the members of the oommittee
before they commenced operations, and the
Chairman, Mr. Blunt, and Supervisor Tweed,
went personally to Washington in reference to
this very matter, and urged it with all the arguments
thov could make use of unou the Secre
Ury of War, but without success. After cogitating
and sleeping over it for a month, with the
losa to the city of hundreds of men by the
suggestion being ignorod. the Secretary has at
la-t awakened to its importance and granted
the request asked for, and the plan is found to
work admirably.
Now, when a recruit is brought in, he steps
immediately before the Provost Marshal and
the surgeon, and is examined, and the necessary
enrolment papers are made out. He then goes
before Mr. Blunt, shows his documents, receives
his bounty money of three hundred dollars, is
let down into the basement, encased in soldier's
garb, and Ibus has become, in the course of a
few moments, a soldier of the Union, and is
marched off to Hiker's Island.
But while the plan worke admirably and
saves a vast deal of inconvenience and trouble,
and insurea security of tho men, it has been accompanied
by an order from General liaya
which,wbile it prevents son# of the soldiers, perhaps,
from being defrauded ef a portion ot their
bounty money, sensibly interferes with the procurement
of men, by driving tbe brokers or
agents ont of tbe business. That some of these
agents are rogues there ii no doubt The man- ]
ner in which Bupervisor Blunt baa brought
several of them up before Lim and compolled
them to ^lsgorge their ill-gotten gains is sufficient
eiidence of this. But, although an evil,
those brokers seem to be a necessary one. Very
few men will cops in of their own accord and
enlist voluntarily. They require to be huated
up, sought out and brought in. At this the
agents are adepts, and are wonderfully successful.
But they a.c like a greut many others who
could be named?great speculators, and will not
work unless they uw make money out of it.
This many of them did by making tbeir own
bargains with the recruits, hiring them to go,
eomo as low as two hundred dollars, tome for
two hundred and fifty and two hundred and
seventy-five dollars. Ac., taking tbe balanoe of

intimate connection existing between the agent
and the recruit
The order of General H**? al l this, ana
tluc committee to pay the bounty directly
iuto the handa of the recruit after he l?
mustered In. Tho broker, of course, oau see no
more of liim. Ilenoothey seem geuerally to hare
struck, and have probably all gone into Wall
street, where they can fleece tho bulls and
bours to their hearts' content. Thus, while the
order of General Hays is most excellent in itself,
so far as saving the bounty money to the
soldior, it astonishingly reduces the number of
men received. If it helps on one hand, it on
the 9ther sensibly affects volunteering. About
every claBs of business carried on in this community
is doue throng i a broker, whether buying
a box of segars, a ton of coal or a hundred
shares of stock, aud the Supervisors' Committee
have discovered that the volunteering business
ib no exception to tue ruio.
hut many or these agent# or brokers are truly
honest and honorable men, and will doubtless
contiuue faithfully iu the business for the sake
of the fixed premium of the government of firtoon
dollars for every new recruit brought in
for an old regiment, and twenty-five dollars for
an experienced soldier.
Now thut the committee have plenty of
money, the best results are looked for, and a
draft, if possible, will be prevented.
This Gkiimax Oi'kua in Nkw Yokk.?We aro
sorry to near that tuc experiment ot giving
German Opera in our Academy of Music has
proved a failure. The manager has offered
sufficient inducements; but the public would
not respond to his call, and it is asserted
there is now every probability that Maretzek
will bo offered the Opera House, and that his
season will commence in January instead of
February.
New York is the only city in this country
that will libcrully patronize Italian Opera. In
Boston or Philadelphia the operatic seasons
must be short, as the patronage of the public
will not hold out. llere, a good troupe, producing
the best operas, with all the accessories
to render the performances on a par with those
in European cupitals, will surely meet with 0:1oourugement.
But we cannot patronize both
German und Italian Opera. What ws may do
in that line when General Grant has conquered
a peuce and been elected President we are not
prepared to say; but, until the General hus done
this, all that New York can accomplish is to
liberally support Italian Opera.
We would advise Mr. Anschutz to make a
tour through the Western cities, whore, with
his talented troupe, he may surely play short
and successful seasona of Gorman Opera.
There are many thousands ot Germans residing
in St. Louis, Cincinnati and Chicago, who would
perforce patronize German Opera in the absence
of the more attractive Indian music.
Worryino Uski.khhi.y.?The party leaders in
the present Congress have lost no time in pushing
their extreme views upon its attention in
the form of legislative propositions, bills for
the prohibition and immodiate abolition of
slavery in the States and Territeries have been
introduced by Senator Hale and Reprosmvtativee
Lovejoy, Arnold, Wilson (Iowa) aim a
number of others Peace resolutions have been
brought forward by Fernando Wood and Finck
of Ohio, both of which will of oourso be
shelved. It ia useless for these men to seek
to influence the fste of the great pending
issues of the day by their action. Tbey might
a* well attempt to set bounds to the ocean
By next September all oontrol over these
questions will hare been taken out of their
hands by the people, who, in the election of
General Grant to the Presidential chair, will
give an entirely new direction to the views and
policy of the government.
Thk Pohtat. Mosey Order System.?We are
glad to see that the Postmaster General hus
again urged the adoption of the system which
has proved such a convenience in England, of allowing
the Post Office to act as a medium tor
the transmission of money by orders purchasable
at its different sub-offices throughout the
country. Nothing has contributed more to
facilitate commercial transactions in the United
Kingdom than this plan, and t- i wonder is that
it lots not been sooner adoj,.jd here. Thort is
no other way in which smuil sums of money
can be transc't'ed as inexpensively sud safely.
The systei .nglaud is uot only self-supporting,
but contributes a handsome surplus to the
Post Office revenues. We trust that Congress
will not fail this session to give it the legislative
sanction which is necessary to enable the

Who Condi errs tub War?? Secretary Stanton,
in his report, ignores the active opciutiomi of
our armies?turns nil that part of the business
of his department over to another functionary,
and so gives a clear intimation that ho has left
it alone and has nothing to do with it. That
other functionary?General Halleck?-has given
us a very full report; but whenever bo comes
to a very important point, and one upon which
the people particularly desire knowledge, all
that he says is?the President. So tho President
is responsible for Durnsido's failure in
December last, for Hooker's at Cbancellorsville,
and lor the bad businosa atChickamauga. Now.
as the President is not a military man, and is
emphatically a sensible one, it is difficult to
suppose that he bos made all this trouble by interference
with generals; and the next question,
therefore, is, who moves the President? Who Is
at the bottom, and who carries on the war? We
do not expect an answer "to this question; but
it is to be expected that the people will provido
against the recurrence of the blunders under
another administration; and the way for them
to do so is to elect General Grant President.
They may know positively enough that ho will
carry on the war, end end it too.
Pxack Propositions.?We notice that Mesa/a.
Stebblns and Odell, who are considered out
and out war men, voted for Fernando Wood's
peace proposition in Congress. They need not
trouble themselves on that question. General
Grant will pass a sot of resolutions daring the
coming year that will secure peace worth having.
