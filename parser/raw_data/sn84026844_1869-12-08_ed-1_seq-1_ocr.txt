The second union or the Forlyflrat
Congreee opened with moatdisagreeable
dev. There waa rein this morning,
leet thin noon end enow thle evening.
The etorm wee eo severe end the walking
so bad that the ettendanoe et the
Cepltol in much leee then uaual. Mr.
Thornton wee the only one or the Foreign
mlnlitere preeent, though woet of
the othen were represented by theft
secretaries. For heir en honr betore
order wea celled, the floor ot eaoh
branch of Congreee waa thronged with
people, nnd there wee the osoal amount
or handshaking end oongraluletlon.
Oood leellng prevailed. The telle Indlnated

*ton. All (be galleries were pretty well
Ailed, but none of them orowded, and
there wan a noticeable vacancy In the .
diplomatic galleries. Among thoae on
the lloor of the Senate daring the afternoon,
were General Sherman, (Governor
Lowe, the new Minister to Cuius,
Uovernot Itullock. of Georgia, and
Governor Walker, of Virginia. Senor
Lernua, lute head of the Oaban Junta,
wau In the Senate gallery, with a uumber
of sympathizers, The regular report
shown fully enough what waa
done In Congress daring the day.
OKNKRAT. SATISFACTION WITH TBI
MRSSAUB.
The reading of the message occupied ,
about an hour, and it was listened to
with tho closest attention In both
houses, and the genoral comment to- ,
night ia very favorable to Ub good sense, ,
clearness or idea and vigor of expression.
Tiio Oaban lobby is in great
wrath at the manner in which the President
gives them the cold shoulder,
and see clearly that It la not worth
while for them to expeot much from
Congress at present. Senor Lemus
looked very gloomy when this part of
the message was read. Everybody was
glad to bear the President reiterate his
views of Inst February on the Alabama
ciaimH question. It will bo noticed
Winv IUPJ niO Ollllliai IU K?UttrUl IVIIUH
to tboso taken by Mr. Sumner In bin
speech on the Johnson-Clarendon (
treaty, The principal discussion In all
clrcleu U 011 the linancial part of the |
message, and on the report of the Heoretary
of the Treasury. The last named
document was not read to Congress,
but the tenor of lts recommendations
soon got abroad. The Eastern members
seem more generally to favor
an early return to Bpecle payments
than those from the West,
muny of whom talk about hu Increase
of currency. The President's Idea
of redeeming currency at a fixed price
1h identical with that presented some
weeks ago by Mr. Garfield. The tariff
men find the message rather more favorable
than they expected It would
be, more from what is omitted than
from what Is said. The suggestion to
remand Georgia back to the condition
It was In when the State Legislature
assembled took people by surprise, but
it will probably be carried out, and a
bill on the subject comes up in the
Senate on Wednesday. The recommendation
for the repeal of the tenure
of the tenure of ofllce act will find some
opposition, though the House Is certain
to pass the bill carrying it out, which
Mr. Butler will bring In to-morrow, If
he can get the tloor. It Is jet far too
uarly to say how the financial recommendations
of the message and report
will be regarded wheu members have ;
bad u chance to carefully consider them, 1
bat it In certain that (he finanoes are
going to have early attention in both
branches ol Congress.

The beads of the various departments |
are prompt with their estimates for the .
coming year. They are in full as tol- .
low*: Legislative, 12,838,801; Executive, |
127,380,774: Civil List, $25,780,056; MilliHry,
$33,345,747; Naval, f24.698.297; Indian

121,000,000; Poatal service,
$12,000,000; total, $210,970,056. To these
must be added about $13,600,000 for de*
ticlenclos from lant year, making a
grand aggregate ol not far froui $225,000,000,
exclusively Interest on the public
debt. A revision of poatil and miscellaneous
estimates will probably re*
suit in their reduction somewhat, and
it may at once be set down as oertaln
that Congress will not appropriate any
such sum as $31,000,000 lor public
works, unless tbe views of membera
undergo a great change.

The consolidation of the staff corps,

and recommended by General Sherman,

was formed of Inspectors and

The Herald says that President
Grant's message is that of an honest,
clear-headed, practical man. Mia the
reconstruction business he simply looka
to tbe exeoutlon of the laws. His plea
for the funding of the debt and the
gradual return to speole payments, will
meet the general approbation of tbe
oonntry." It considers tbe message
non committal on Cuban affairs. It la
a eood business measaire.
The Times a ays the message l? one ol
good iibwh throughout.
The IForMaays: "TUIa Is the weakest
message ever nt>nf to OongreHS by an
Amerloau President." it considers
that the meha??o "settles the Cuban
Insurrection agHiuBt the patrlotn, and
on tluanolrtl atfalrn Is too Quixotic and
chimerical for Horloua consideration."
