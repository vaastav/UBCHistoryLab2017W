General Grain \e»v».
Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce, Dec.
10.—The bull sentiment continues in wheat,
although this morning brought a sharp set
back, and It looked for a time as If the mar
ket had turned about. The frightened shorts,
who last night paid 80»ie for May on the curb,
saw It sell at TSVic on the opening break.
Larger northwestern receipts were shown this
morning, Minneapolis and Duluth getting
1,119 cars, against 462 last year. There is an
increased country movement of corn. Pres
eut prices are attractive. The moet deterrent
factor, however, is the continued unrespon
sive, almost indifferent, tone abroad. With,
any encouragement from the foreigners, the
market would no doubt go to even a higher
level under stimulus of the present buying
fever; but to date all our advances have been
usable to jar up on Liverpool or to bring more
than a reluctant and feeble response. Yes
terday Liverpool failed to come up, and to
day, against our price maintenance and addi
tional gain, Liverpool came only %d higher,
sliding off to H to higher on second ca
bins, and closing H&'^d lower. The local
market was extremely nervous and active
over a wide range. From the first break to
ISVfcc, there followed recovery to 79%@79%c,
this followed by another break. Some of the
small fry were shaken out on the early
slump. Broomhall cables that his Argentine
advices are of favorable harvesting condi
tions and that corn has a good start. Ilia
Odessa agent reports considerable wheat still
in the interior that will not be shipped until
spring, and that farmers are delivering corn,
freely lv South Russia and also in Rou
inania.
Primary receipts were 1,066,000 bu, against
Kuo.OOO bu last year; shipments, 190,000 bu,
against 243,000 bu. Wheat and flour clear
ances, 536,000 bu. Minneapolis had 895 cars,
against 369 last year, and Dulutli 724,
against 9S.
The world's visible, according to Brad
■treet's figures. Increased 3,250,000 bu. East
of the Rookies the Increase was 6,392,000, but
this was offset in part by a decrease of 2,100,
--000 bu In Europe and afloat.
Towards the close the market turned very
weak and broke under 78c, May closing at
77% c. December closed at 75% c and July at
74c. Chicago closed May at 77% c.
The cash, wheat market was again very ac
tive. Sales of wheat to arrive have been
considerably lighter on this upturn than is
the rule, and this is much commented upon.
In to-day's trading, No. 1 northern to arrive
sold principally at 78% c, some at 78c and a
little at 7S%c. No. I northern to arrive Bold
m. 76%@76%c and spot No. 2 at 76%@77c. No.
3 wheat was steady at /6c. Rejected and no |
grade were in fair sale- on. a range of 69 to
74% c.

'01.40, and No. 1 sold around $1.42%. Receipts,

CHICAGO GRAIN
Decline in Wheat in Consequence of
Weak Cable*.
Chicago, Dec. 10.—Opening tendencies in the
grain markets to-day indicated almost a du
plicate of the early trading yesterday. Prices
all around broke on bearish conditions and
Influenced heavy markets. Wheat was still
the leader and showed' the greatest weakness*
May opening l@l%c to 1%@1%c lower, at
82% cto Sl%c. Weak cables, in spite of strong
interior English markets and markedly larger
northwestern receipts, started the decline.
The trade was enormous and nearly every one
in the pit seemed to have selling orders. It
seemed to be a case of high prices again
tempting holders to take profits. Just the
opposite soon became the order of business,
however. Once more the lower prices
brought out good buying orders from New
York and tho southwest, and prices respond
ed, May quickly advancing to 82% c. At this
figure the markets held fairly steady at nar
row fluctuations, selling at 82% cat the end of
the first hour. Receipts, 75 cars, 1 contract;
Minneapolis and Dulurth reported 1,119 cars,
a total for the three points of 1,194, against
681 a year ago.
May reached 83% c, the stream of long wheat
began pouring in again and prices slumped.
May sold down to Sl%c and closed weak, l%c
down, at 81%@81%c.

Much th« same thing happened in corn a*
in -wheat. Traders early tumbled over on*
another to take profits. The market had a
heavy tone resulting from the big sales yes
terday. This, with weak cables, brought a
slumping opening. Trade was large. May
opened %@l%c lower, at 68c to 67% c. After
this slump there was some show of local sup
port and corn reacted to 6Se, holding- steady,
slightly under this figure. Receipts, 235 cars.
Corn showed some strength, following
wheat, aud May sold up to 68% c, but heavy
sales and little demand brought the decline '

THE MINNEAPOLIS JOUBNAL,
STOCKS DO BETTER
i
Substantial Gains in the Opening
Minutes.
AMALGAMATED STILL SEESAWING
Market Closes Dull and Heavy
Near , the Lowest
Prices.
I
New York, Dec. 10. —Gains of a substantial
, fraction were made by som» of th« leading
stocjrt at the opening, particularly Manhattan,
'■ Missouri Pacific. New York Central and
Pennsylvania. Amalgamated Copper opened
l%c higher, at 72% c, and reacted to 71% c, and
bounded up again to 72%0 in the first five
minutes of business. Lackawaniia was a
j point better, and Consolidated Gas 1%. The
general tone was strong and Business was in
large volume. There were advancee of fro,m
1 to 2 points in Chicago Great Western pra
ferred, Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville,
Illinois Central, General Electric, American
Car, Hocking Coal and lowa Central.
Professional traders then took profits on
yesterday's purchases, and this selling de- j
pressed the leading stocks well below last |
nig-ht. The declines from the opening figures .
ran from 1 to 1% In Amalgamated Copper, j
Manhattan, Sugar, St. Paul, Atchision, Mis- i
eouri Pacific, New York Central and Wabaeh. j
I preferred. Trading became very dull after |
! the lower prices were made. St. Paul and j
New York Central recovered over a point.
Amalgamated Copper hung around 71.
The dullness of th© market was relieved
somewhat by in-creased selling pressure, di- '
rented principally against the tractions and 1
Amalgamated. The reaction forced Sugar, ;
Amalgamated, Manhattan,, Metropolitan, Mis- j
souri Pacific, Norfolk & Western, St. Paul
and Atchleon from 1 to 2% under last night, ,
with Metropolitan Street Railway the chief i
sufferer. Amalgamated sold at 69 as com- J
pared with 72%, the earlier high price. Pres- i
sure slackened toward midday except in j
Amalgamated Copper, and the market again ;
fell into dullness, but maintained a depressed ■
tone. Manhattan and Metropolitan Street ,
Railway rallied sharply over a point.
The market was dull and sluggish except j
for wide movements in a few stocks. Metro- j
politan Street Railway fell back 1%. Later 1
Manhattan stiffened to 137% and Amalga- j
mated Copper to 70%, with some sympathetic
effect on other stocks. American Smelting
rallied 1%@1% over yesterday and Canada
Southern rose I.
Buying of Vanderbilt stocks strengthened
the market, which.was reinforced later when
Amalgamated Copper was bid up to 74%.
Union Pacific, St. Paul, bison preferred,
Louisville, Sugar and several others ruled at
their top prices and the general tone was
more confident. Net gains were made of
2% for Rock Island and Canada Southern and
1% In New York Central and Minneapolis &
St. Louis. Metropolitan Street Railway re
covered 2% from the lowest.
Amalgamated Copper worked up again to
74% after a reaction. Canada Southern made j
its gain 1.-., Lake Erie & Western 2%; lowa j
1 Central 1%, the preferred 2%, and North
American 1%. When Amalgamated broke
again to 69%, the whole market weakened I
decidedly. Calling of loans ran the money [
rate up sharply and brought large offerings !
on Ihe market. Low prices for 'the day were ;
made. St. Paul touched 161, Manhattan 134 Vi
and Sugar 119%, these stocks being most act- {
ively affected. Manhattan made a spasmodic
rally of 1%, but the closing was generally
dull and heavy near the lowest. .
Bonds were irregular.

INVESTMENT GOSSIP
London cable: "Americans firm and the
tendency is upward. In financial circles gen
erally, sentiment is more cheerful and secu
rities incline to strength." :A'.
New York to Watson: "While the stock
market is regarded as speculative, being due
very largely to short covering, and while
smart declines are to be expected, sentiment
favors tho purchase. of stocks on the weak
spots. The point Is that prices are down on
average ten points from the highest reached
in November, and at the recent level stocks
have been accumulated by the same interests
which unloaded on last month's rise. Union
Pacific, for instance, several weeks ago was
around 108, and hundreds of thousands of
shares were dealt in In a single day, and the
pool dumped its holdings, which it has of
late been taking back, clever brokers believe,
from 103 down."
SPECULATIVE GOSSIP
Berlin—Closed lc higher. y
Budapest— %c higher.
Antwerp—Wheat, unchanged.
Liverpool close: Wheat, 1,4@%d lower;
corn, %@%d lower.
Chicago contract stocks: -Wheat, 5,199,000
bu; corn, 4,245,000 bu; oats. 1,046,000 bu. .
Verhoeff from Milmine: Tbe buying of wheat
to-day has been much better than the selling.
Some of the local crowd ha* been on top of It
but the commission, houses■ have taken it.

grains helped this pit, however, and prices
advanced well. January pork opened 100
higher at $17; January lard 5c down at $9.80
and advanced l©c, and January ribs 5c lower
at $8.50 and sold up 2%c. Close: Pork, De
