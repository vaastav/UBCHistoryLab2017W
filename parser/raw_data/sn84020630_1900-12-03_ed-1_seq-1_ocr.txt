of the president's secretaries, appeared
with the president's message. Secretary
Bannett at once began reading the docu
ment. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: VWlth the outgoing of the old and
the incoming of the new century, you
begin the last session of the fifty-sixth
congress with evidences on every hand
of Individual and national prosperity,
and with the proof of growing strength
and Increasing power for the good of
' republican Institutions. Your country
, men will Join with you in the felicita
tion that, American liberty Is more
firmly, established than ever "before and
love, for it and the determination to
preserve It more universal than in any
former period of our history. The re
public was never so "strong, because
never so strongly Intrenched in' the
heart of the people as now. The con
stitution, with a fewsamendments ex
Jsts as It left the hands of Its authors.
The additions which have been made,
proclaim a larger freedom .and more
extended citizenship. Popular govern
ment has demonstrated In a hunlred
and twenty-four years of trial here Its
stability, security and Its efficiency as
the best instrument of national devel
opment and the best safeguard to hu
man rights."
.. After showing the growth of the
country In territory and population, it
says: "Education, religion, and moral
ity kept pace with our advancement
and adhered to its foundation princi
ple, and abated none of them, dealing
with our new peoples and possessions.
The nation so preserved and blessed,
gives reverent thanks to God and In
vokes his guidance and continuance of
his care and favor."
POLICY TOWARDS CHINA,
i The history of the Chinese trouble,
which the message says Is a "dominant
question" of our foreign intercourse, is
then outlined. Of the condition Avb'.eh
led up to the Boxer outbreak, the pres-1
I dent says: "The origin lies deep In the
character of the. -Chinese races uai in
Afl i t I M ' t ' ll CI t TV miTBHIIHAIlf rpViA
,feawlt,,sV?lllon and the openintr of
'? Chines po ts to foreign trade and sol-
Hement disturbed aljke the homogene
ity and the seclusion of China. . ,
"In the meanwhile foreign actlvltv
made .itself felt In all quarters, - net
alone on the coast, but along the great
river arteries and In remoter dlrtr'ots.
, carrying newJdeas,' and Introducing
new, associations among the primitive
.:, people "Which had pursued for centuries
a national policy of isolation. '
The telegraph and railway spreading
- over their land, steamers plying on their
waterways, merchant and missionary
penetrating year by year, farther to the
interior, became to the Chinese mind
' types of alien Invasion and changing
: - the course of their national life and
i fraught with vague forbodings of dls
aster to their beliefs and their self con
trol. :
For several years before the present
trouble began all resources of foreign
' y diplomacy, backed by moral demonstra
tions and physical force of fleets and arms
: had been needed to secure due respect
. for the treaty rights of foreigners and
-' obtain satisfaction for the outrages up
on persons and property and unoffend
ing sojourners,
The diplomatic representatives of the
:.- powers at Pekln strove in vain to check
' the movement. A protest Was followed
br a demand and, the demand by a r
newea protest, id oe met wicn pertunc
tory edicts from the palace and evasive
' ana futile reassurances from the Tsung
LI Yamen. ... ,
. The Chinese government proved Itself,
' however, unable to check the rising
strength of the Boxers and appeared to
.',. be a prey to' International dissensions.
In an unequal contest, the anti-foreign
. . .'Influences soon gained ascendancy under
the leadership of Prince Tuan. ..?..,
Continuing on this subject the presl
, dent says:
"The policy of the government of the
United States Is to seek a solution which
" may bring about permanent safety and
peace to China, preserve the Chinese ter
ritorial administrative entity, protect
all the rights guaranteed the friendly
powers by treaty and International law,
and to safe-guard for the world the prin
ciple of equal and impartial trade with
all parts of the Chinese empire.
"The Russian proposition looking to
the restoration of the imperial power in
Pekin has been accepted as In full con
sonance with our own desires. While
so doing we forego no jotof our undoubt
ed right to exact exemplary and deter
rent punishment of the responsible au
thors and abettors of criminal acts
whereby we and the other nations have
suffered a grievous injury.
"I regard as one of the essential
factors of durable adjustment the se
' curement of adequate guarantees for
liberty of faith, since the insecurity of
those natives who may embrace alien
creeds Is scarcely less effectual than the
assault upon the rights of foreign wor
ship and teaching than would be 'a di
rect invasion thereof.
"The matter of indemnity for. our
wronged citizens is a question of grave
pnnnorn . MonauroH in mnnav nlnna onf.
Sclent reparation may - prove to be be-j
vond the ability oi Uliina to meet, ah
of the. powers concur in emphatic dis
claimers of any purpose of aggrandize
ment through the dismemberment of the
empire. I am disposed to think that due
compensation may be made In part by
the increased guarantees and security
for foreign rights and immunities, and,
most important of all, by the opening of
China to equal commerce to all the
world. These views have been and will
be earnestly advocated by our represen
tatives." The message then .recites the events
as they occurred reports of slaughter
of native converts and missionaries and
the decisions of the powers to assemble
its combined fleet In Chinese waters as
a moral demonstration; the development
of the seditions movement In Pekin; the
shelling of the Taku forts, after tho
Chinese had fired on the fleet, In which
the American Admiral refused to par
ticipate on the ground that we were not
at war with China; subsequent were the
capture of the Taku forts, and the sev
erance of communication with Pekin;
the attack on the legations aud their
relief by the combined force after fight
ing their way to the walled city.
Commenting on the latter the Presi
deht says: The siege and the relief of
the legations has passed into undying
history. In all the stirring chapter
which records the heroism of the devot
ed band, clinging to hope in the face of
despair, and the undaunted spirit- that
led their relievers through the battle
and suffering to the goal, It Is a memory
of which my countrymen may be justly
proud, that the honor of our flag was
maintained alike In the siege and rescue
and that stout American hearts haye
again set high, In fervent emulation,
the true men of another race and lan
guage, by their Indomitable courage
that ever strives for the cause of right
anu justice. .
TRADE WITH SOUTH AMERICA.
Credit for the continued good trade
relations with South America is given as
follows: ...
The "Bureau of American republics
continues to discharge, with the happiest
result, the Important work of promoting
cordial relations between the united :
States and the Latin American coun
tries, all of which are now active mem
bers of the International union. The)
bureau has been Instrumental in bring-j
Itrg - about an agreement for another I
International American congress which ,
i . . . i .. . i fit.. i : i 1
in .bu tiienb in tuts iibv ui iubjuuu in
October 1901. Tho bureau's future for
another term of ten years is assured by
International compact but congress will
doubtless have much to do with shaping
new lines of work and general policy. I
Its usefulness to the Interests of the
Latin American trade is widely appre-,
elated and shows gratifying 'develop- i
inent."
FINANCIAL CONDITION.
The financial condition of the govern- (
ment Is spoken of as follows-. I
' -It is gratifying to be able to state tnat
the surplus revenues fur the fiscal year,
ended June 30, 1900, were $79,527,000. 18.
For the six preceding years we bad only
deficits, the aggregate of which from
1894 to 1899 Inclusive, amounted to
$283,028,991.14.
"It is gratifying also to note that
during the year considerable reduction i
was shown in the expenditures oi tne
government.
. "Because of - the excess of revenues
over the expenditures, the' secretary of
the treasury was enabled to apply bonds
and other securities to the sinking fund
to the amount of $50,544,556.09. The
secretary of the treasury -' estimates
receipts for the current fiscal year will
aggregate $580,000,000 and expenditures
$500,000,000 leaving an excess of re
venues over expenditures of $80,000,000
The present condition of the treasury Is
one of undoubted strength.,
THE MONEY QUESTION.
'It will be my duty as I am sure It will
be the disposition of congress to provide
Whatever further legislation Is needed
to Insure continued parity under all con
ditions between our two forms of me
tallic money, silver and gold. : K
THE NATIONAL BANKING ACT.
"The beneficial effect of the financial
act of 1900, as far as it relates to ihe
modification of the national banking
act. Is already apparent. The prjvis.on
for the incorporation of national hanks
with a capital of not less than 12000"!
ill places not exceeding three thou-.'ind
fnhablt&nte, resulted In the extension.
of banking facilities to many sn ttllj
communities hitherto unable to provide I
hemselves with banking .nstitut'.uus
under the national system."
INCREASE IN BANK NOTE CU'.CU
LATION. "The large increase in the nat'onal
bnik note circulation resul.ed Cvoni a
provision of the act which per n1 Is- na
tional banks to issue circulating notes
to the par value of the United SUtes
bonds deposited as security, Instead of
only 90 per cent thereof as heretofore.
The Increase in circulating notes from
March 14 to November 30, was $77,889,
570. The party In power passed
such legislation as will better make the
currency responsive to the varying
needs of business at all seasons and to
all sections."
FOREIGN TRADE.
Continuing, the message says: "Our
foreign trade shows a remakable record
of commercial and industrial progress.
The total of Imports and exports for
the first time in the history of our
country exceeded two billion dollars."
... RECIPROCITY.
In that portion of the message de.
voted to Commercial conventions, the
following" paragraph appears: "The
policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests
upon principles of international equity
and has been so repeatedly approved
by the people of the United States that
there ought to be no hesitation in either
branch of congress in giving to it full
effect."., '
RELATIONS WITH SPAIN. '-
With regard to Spain, the message
says: "Satisfactory progress has been
made toward the conclusion of a gen
eral treaty of friendship and inter
course with Spain, by the replacement
of the old treaty which had passed into
abeyance by reason of the late war.
By the terms of the treaty of peace the
line bounding the ceded Philippine
group in the southwest failed to Include
several small Islands lying west of the
Sulus, which always have been recog
nized under Spanish control. The oc
cupation of Sibutu and Cagayan Sulu
by our naval forces elicited the claim
on the part of Spain, the essential
equity of which could not be gainsaid.
In order to cure the defect of the treaty
by removing all possible ground for
future misunderstanding respecting the
interpretation of its third article, I di
rected a negotiation supplementary to
the treaty, which will be forthwith laid
before the senate, whereby Spain quits
all title and claim of title to the is
lands named as well as to any and all
islands belonging to the Philippine ar
chipelago lying outside of the lines de
scribed in said third article, and agrees
that all such islands shall be compre
hended In the cession of the archipelago
as fully as had it been expressly In
cluded within those lines. In considera
tion of this cession the United States la
to pay Spain the sum of $100,000."
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
The statement that the Nicaraguan
government had declared void the mari
time canal company contract and the
Eyre-Cramin option for building the
inter-oceanic canal, concludes as fol
lows: "Deeming itself relieved from the
existing agreements the Nicaraguan
government shows a disposition to deal
freely with the canal question, either In
the way of negotiations with the United
States or taking measures to promote
the water way.
"Overtures for a convention to the ef
fect that the building of the canal un
der the ausplcions of the United States
are under consideration. In the mean
time the views of congress upon the
subject, in the light of the report of the
commission appointed to examine the
comparative merits of the various
trans-isthmian ship canal projects,
may be awaited." '
H AT-PAUNCEFOTE TREATY. '
"I commend to the early attention of
the senate the convention with Great
Britain to facilitate the construction
of such a canal and to remove the ob
jections which arise out of the conven
tion called the Clayton-Bulwer treaty."
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The message then discusses the re
latione of the United States with for
eign countries, which are represented
as being cordial. In speaking of Great
Britain, no mention 1b made of the
South African war, other than to refer
to the seizing of American goods by
Great Britain. Regarding Mexico, the
president uses. the following language:
"No noteworthy incident occurred In
our relation, with our important south
ern neighbor. The commercial inter
course with Mexico continues to thrive,
and the two governments neglect no
opportunity to foster their mutual In
terests In all practicable ways."
LA ABRA AND WEIL CLAIMS.
. "Pursuant to the declaration of the
supreme court that the awards of the
late Joint commission In the La Ab a
and Well claims were obtained through
fraud, the sum awarded in the first caie
of $403,030.08 has been returned to Mex
ico, and the amount of the Well award
will be returned in like manner."
BOUNDARY COMMISSION.
"The convention indefinitely extend
ing the time for the completion of th
labors of the United States and tne
Mexican International (water) bouud-'
ary commission has been signed."
REDUCTION OF WAR TAXES.
The president recommends '"the re
duction of the war revenue taxes, be
ginning with those most burdensome
to the people."
UPBUILDING OF THE MARINE.
He wishes to see the upbuilding of
the American marine as a field for
"profitable employment of labor and
capital."
TRUSTS.
Referring to the trusts, the president
uses the following language: "In my
last annual mesage to congress I called
attention to the necessity of early ac
tion on a remedy of such evils as might
be found to exist in connection with
combinations of capital organized into
trusts, and again to Invite attention
to my discussion on the subject at that
time."
THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION.
. The president refers to the last mes
sage In which he dwelt at some length
upon the Philippine question. He also
repeats the lengthy instructions to the
secretary of war regarding the appoint
ment of the Philippine commission and
speaks of General MacArthur's am
nesty proclamation. The preliminary
report of the commission Is mentioned
as are later reports which show "yet
more encouraging advances towards
insuring the benefits of liberty and good
government to the Filipinos."
The president continues: "I have
upon another occasion called the Fili
pinos the wards of the nation. Our ob
ligation as guardians are not lightly
assumed; it must not be otherwise than
honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to
benefit those who come under our fos
tering care. It is our duty to treat
them so that our flag may be no less
beloved In the mountains of Luzon and
the fertile zones of Mindanao and Ne
gros than It Is at home, that there, as
here, shall be revered the symbol of
liberty, enlightenment and progress in
every avenue of development.
"The Filipinos are a race quick . to
learn and profit by knowledge. It
would be a rash people, who with the
teachings of contemporaneous history
in view, would fix the limit of the de
gree of culture and advancement yet
within reach of those people If our du
ty toward them be faithfully per
formed." PORTO RICO
The president asserts that the civil
government provided for Porto Rico by
act of congress is in successful opera
tion, and recommends that the dispo
sition of public lands there be provided
for by law.
CUBA.
The instruction and address to the
military governor of Cuba regarding
the holding of a general election in
both which the purpose of the United
States to exercise sovereignty over the
island is disclaimed, Is next quoted..
. PACIFIC CABLE. .
The recommendation for the Pacific
cable is renewed. . fJ
' INCREASE OF ARMY. V As"'
For the proper garrisoning of army
posts and the care of the defensive ma
chinery of the government and meeting
the necessity of considerable force In
the Philippines, the date of the dis
charge of the volunteer force being
close at hand, and it being inadvisable
to reduce the forces in Cuba and Porto
Rico, the president says that there is a
need for from 50,000 to 60,000 men, in
creasing the army to 100,000 in the Im
mediate future. ' The message says:
"I am sure that the number may be
reduced as the insurgents shall come
to acknowledge the authority of the
United States, of which there are as
suring Indications."
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
Referring to the post office depart
ment, the president says: "The contin
ued and rapid growth of the postal
service is a sure index of the great and
increasing business activity of the
country. Its most striking development
is the extension of the rural free de
livery. This service ameliorates the
isolation of farm life and conduces to
good roads, and quickens and extends
the dissemination of general informa
tion." THE NAVY.
The recommendations of the seer-.-tary
of the navy for new vessels and
for additional officers and men are ap
proved. '
PENSIONS.
Commenting upon the increase in V'ne
amount of pensions paid, the president
says: "The government justly appre
ciates the services of its soldiers ani
sailors, by making the pension pay
ments liberal beyond precedent to them
their widows and orphans.
THE EIGHT HOUR LAW.
Continuing, the president says:
"There still remain important .featun s
of the rightful application of the eight
hour law for the benefit of labor and
of the principle of arbitration, and I
again commend these subjects to the
caiful attention of congress."
IRRIGATION PROBLEMS.
The only reference in the president's
message to the subject of irrigation was
the following: "The irrigation prob
lems in our semi-arid regions are re
ceiving careful and Increased attention.
ECONOMY COUNSELED.
. The mesage concludes: "In our great
prosperity we must guard against the
danger lt-inrltes of extravagance In
government expenditures and appro
priations; and the chosen representa
tives of the people will, I doubt not,
furnish an example In their legislation
of that wise economy which In season
of plenty husbands for the future. In
this era of great business activity and
opportunity caution is not untimely.
It will not abate, but strengthen con
fidence. It will not retard but promote
legitimate industrial and commercial
expansion. Growing power brings with
it temptations and perils requiring con
stant vigilance to avoid. It must not
be used:. to invite conflicts, nor for oppression,-
but for more effective main
tenance of the principles of equality
and Justice upon which our Institutions
and happlnese depends. , Let us keep
always in mind that the foundation of
our government is liberty; its super
structure la peace." .-

A MURDER IN v
GRANT COUNTY.
Joseph Corn of Central Shot and
Killed by Julius Wellgehausen
Last Wednesday.
SELF DEFENSE IS CLAIMED.
Corn Was Somewhat Under the Influence
of Strong Drink and Had Quarreled
Before the Shooting Both
Well Known Men.
Joseph Corn, a mining man of Central.
Grant county, was shot and killed by
Julius Wellgehausen. The killing oc
curred last Wednesday night in the Pal
ace saloon. Two shots were firud by
Wellgehausen, one going Into the ceiling
aui'tlie other penetrating Com'! abdo
men. Corn died 25 minutes afterward.
He leaves a wife and cirfld. Wellge
haused claims self-defense as the motive
of his deed. He was arrested the fol
lowing day.
On Wednesday evening, Corn took it
few drinks after supper and between tlx
hours of 8 and 9 o'clock pawned his six
shooter at Wiley's saloon for a small sum
of money. Later he went to the Palar.e
saloon and after taking more drinks be
came involved In some difficulty with a
negro named Shelton. Blows were passed
and Corn and Shelton then clinched,
later being separated by bystanders,
Shelton left the saloon for a few minutes
and upon his return he again began
fighting with Corn. Bystanders again
separated the belligerents, but shortly
afterward Corn slapped Shelton who
refused to fight again. A negro friend
tried to get Corn to go home, but he re
fused, saying that he would wash his
face and then he would go. After wash'
ing his face Corn came near the bar and
asked Wellgehausen: "Are you a friend
of Andreas Walters?" To which Well
gehausen replied: "I am." Corn then
said: "If you are a friend of his, come
from behind tho bar." Wellgehausen
replied: "No, 1 am tending bar. Go
away."
The leading witnesses examined for
the prosecution testilied that Corn
then walked to the center of the bar, or
very near the center, and stepping upon
the Iron railing in front, leaned upon
the bar and looked over it. The wit
ness then left the saloon and shortly
afterwards heard shots.
Corn had been a resident of Grant
county for about 25 years, was liked by
all who knew him, was honest, indus
trious and a good citizen, excepting that
at times he would become intoxicated
and was at 'such times very disagreeable.
He was married some five years ago to
Miss Ana Holland, of Central, who with
their only child, a boy, aged about three
and a half years, survives. An uncle
who lives at l'inos Altos, and one who
lives in Lincoln county, are the only
relatives in the territory.
Julius Wellgehausen has been a sub
stantial citizen of the county for many
years and has been thoroughly identltied
with its upbuilding in a business way.
He has always maintained an enviable
reputation as an upright and law abid
ing citizen, and in all his business trans
actions has heon just and honest. The
affair is all the more to be regretted be
cause of the prominence and stability of
tho parties to the occurence.
