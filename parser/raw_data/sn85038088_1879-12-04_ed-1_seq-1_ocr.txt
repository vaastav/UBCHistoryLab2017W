Tho grave evil aad perils of a partisan
spoils system of appointment to office, and of
office tenure, are bow generally recognised.
In the resolutions of the great parties, in tad
reports of Departments, . la the debates aad

pointed out, and tha need of their reform haa
been admitted. To command tha necessary

When the people have approved a policy at
a National election, confidence oa tho part of
the officers they have selected, and of the ad
visers who in accordance with our political
Institutions should be consulted In the policy
which it is their duty to carry into effect, is
Indispensable. It ia eminently proper that
they should explain it before the people, as
well as illustrate its spirit ia the performance
of their official duties.
It hardly Bead be pointed oat that very differ

ber of those who All the subordinate places in

their superiors ia official position. . It ia tbsir

Aa a consequence, it follow that their
tenure of office should not depend on the pre
valence of any policy or the supremacy of any
party, but should be determined by their ca
pacity to serve the aewpauaoat usefully, quite
irrespective of partisan iatereeta. The same
consideration that should govern the tenure
should also prevail- to the aapotatment, dis
cipline and removal oi those subordinates. The
authority of appointment and tcasoral ia not a
perquisite which may bo used to aid a friend or
remove a partisan ; but is a trust to be exer

people to bestow it upon him, it would seem

A large and responsible part of the duty oi
restoring the Civil Service to the desired purity
and efficiency rests on the President, and it has
been my purpose to-do what is within my
power to advance such prudent and frugal
measures of reform as will most surely and
rapidly bring about that radical change of
system essential to make our administra
tive's methods satisfactory to a free and
intelligent people. By a proper exercise of
authority it is in the power of the Execu
tive to do much to promote such a reform. But
it can not bo too clearly understood that
nothing adequate can be accomplished without
co-operation on the part of Congress, and con
siderable and intelligent support among tha
people. . , I , ".; . -
neiorms which challenge the generally ac

and exposes the errors of their adversaries
riETIgm BLACKMAIL.
There are other Administration abuses to
which tha attention of Congress should be
asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap
pointment and the constant peril of removal
without can very naturally load to an ab
sorbing and mischievous political activity en
the part of those thus appointed, which not
only Interferes with . the due discharge of
official duty, but is incompatible with the
freedom of election. Not without warrant in
the view of several of my. predecessors ia the
Presidential omce, and directly within the law
of 1871 already cited, I endeavored by regula
tions mado on the 22d day of June, 1877, to
put some reasonable limits to uch abuses. It
may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be
accessary., to aenne with crecisioa the proper
limit oi politic! action oa the part of' Federal
officer ; out while their right to hold and freely
express their opinions can not be questioned, it
ia arery, plain tnac tney should neither DC al
lowed to devote to other subjects the time
needed or tho proper discharge of their official
duties, aur to us tbo authority of their office
to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the '
political action . of tho who hold, different
opinions.'-" w
in Whatever aspect considered, the practice
ot making levies, for party purpose upon the
salaries of officers is highly demoralising to tho
puoiio service, ana discreditable to the coun
try. Though an officer should be as free a any
other citixen to give hi own money in aid of
hi own opinions or his party, he should also
be as free as any other citixen to refuse to
make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair
compensation for the time and labor of the
officers, it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon
mem. n tney are maae excessive in order
that they may bear the tax,' the excess in an
indereot robbery of the public fund. I recom
mend, therefore, such a revision and extension
of present statutes as shall secure to those in
every grade of official life or public enployment
the protection with which a groat and enlight
ened Nation shall guard those who are faithful
in its service.

The attention cf Congress is called to tbe
annual report of to Secretary cf the Tieasury
on the condition of the public finances. The
ordinary revenues from all sources for the
fiscal vear, ended June 30, 1879, were $27:1.-
827,184.46. Tbe ordinary expenditures for
the same period were $260,947,883.33 ; leaving
a surplus revenue for the year, ot $6.87H.300.y3.
The receipts lor tne present flscal year, ending

follows : Acjtual receipts for the first quarter,
commencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61 ; esti

for the remaining three-quarters of the year the

The total receipts during the next ti.-cal vi-ar.

riod will be $278,097,364.39, leaving a surplus
of $9,902,635.61 for that year." The large
amount expended for arrears of pensions dur
ing me last ana tne present nscai year, tmuuui
inz to $21,247,249.60. has prevented the ap
plication of the full amount required by law to
the sinkinr fund for the current year; but
these arrears having been substantially paiu;
it is believed that the sinking fund can here

The Secretary of War reports that the War

being lor a less sum of money than any annua)
estimate rendered to Congress from that De
partment during a period of at least twelve
yeara. He concurs with the General of the
Army in recommending such legislation as
will authorize the enlistment of the full number
of 25,000 men for the line of the army exclusive
pt the 3,463 men required for detached duty,
and therefore not available for- service in the
field. He also recommends that Congress be
asked to provide by law for the disposition of a
large number of abandoned military posts and
reservations, which, though very valuable in
themselves, have been rendered useless for mil
itary purposes by the advance of civilisation
and settlement. In these several recommenda

ealero Agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria
the head of a small band of maunders, after
committing many atrocities, being vigorously
chased by - a military force, made his way
across the Mexican border, "and is now on
foreign soil. While these occurrences
which a comparatively small number of
Indians were engaged, are most deplora
ble, a vast majority of our Indian popula
tion have fully justified the expectations of
those who believe that by humane and
peaceful influences the Indian can . be
led to abandon the habits of savage life,
The Indian policy sketched in the report of
the Secretary of the Interior, the object of
which is to make liberal provision for the edu
cation of Indian yonths, to settle the Indians
upon farm lots in severalty, to give them title
in fee in their farms, inalienable for a certain
number of years, etc., must commend itself as
just and beneficial to the ' Indians. I, there
fore, earnestly recommend the enactment of a
law enabling the Government to give Indians
title in fee, unalienable for twenty-five
years, to the farm lands assigned to them
by allotment. I also repeat the rec
ommendation made in my first annual mes
sage, that a law be passed admitting Indians,
who can give satisfactory proof of having by
their own Tabor supported their familie for a
number of years, and who are willing to de
tach themselves from their tribal relations, to
the benefit of the Homestead Act, and to grant
them pat.nta containing the aame provision of
inalienability lor a certain period.

The effort made by the Department of the
Interior to arrest the depredations on the
timber lands of the United States have been
continued, and have met with considerable
success. A large number of cases of trespass
ers have been presented in the Courts 01 the
United states, utbers nave been settled,
the trespassers offering to make payment to
tho Government for the valne of the timber
taken by them. . The proceeds of these prose
cutions and settlements turned into the -Treasury
far exceed in amount the sums appro
priated by Congress for thi purpose. A
more important reBuit, however, .consists in
the tact that the destrnction of our public
forests by depredation, though such cases still
occur, has been greatly reduced in extent;
and it is probable that if the present policy is
vigorously pursued, ana sufficient pro
vision to that end ia made by Con
gress, such trespasses, at least those on a
large scale, can be entirely suppressed, ex
cept in the Territories where timber for the
daily requirements of t he population can not
under the present state of the law be other
wise obtained. I, therefore, earnestly invite
the attention of Congress to the recommend
ation made by the Secretary of the Interior,
tbat a law be enacted enabling the Govern
ment to sell timber from the public lands
without conveying the fee, where such lands
are principally valuable for the timber thereon,
such sales to be so regulated that as to con
form to domestic wants and business require
ments, while at the aame time guarding
against a sweeping destruction of the
forests. 1 be enactment "ot such a law ap
pears to Decomo a more pressing necessity
every day.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
In former messages, impressed with the im
portance of the subject, I have taken occasion
to commend to congress tne adoption " of a
generous policy toward the District of Colum
bia. Tho report of the Commissioners of the
District herewith transmitted, contains sugges
tions and recommendations, to all of which I
earnestly invite your careful attention. I ask
your early and favorable consideration of the
views which they express as to the urgent
need of legislation for the reclamation
of the marshes of the Potomac and its eastern
branch within the limits of tho city, and
for the repair of the street of the Capital
heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and by
decay rendered almost impassable, and a
source of imminent danger to tbe health of it
eitisens. The -means at the disposal of the
Commissioner are wholly inadequate for the
accomplishment of these important works, and
should be supplemented by timely appropria
tions from the Federal Treasury. The filling
of the flats in front of the city will add to the
adjacent landa and parks now owned by the
united states a large and valuable domain.
sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its en
tire cost, and will also, as an incidental re
sult, secure the permanent improvement of tho
river for the purposes of navigation. The Con
stitution having invested Congress with
pTeme and exclusive jurisdiction over the Dis
trict of Columbia, its eitisens must of necessity
look to Congress alone for all needful legisla
tion affecting their interests ; and as the terri
tory of this District is the common property ot
the people of the United States, who equally
with its resident Citixens are interested in the
prosperity of their Capital, I cannot doubt that
you will be amply sustained by the general
voice of the country in any measures, you may
adopt lor tbls purpose.

Chandler on th Emergency.
Among the anecdotes of Znck Chn ti
dier the Milwaukee t-eiitinel tells the fol
lowing: Senator Chandler waH for forty
years a Hlit ician, and pained national
prominence by his remarkable energy in
war times urginir the prosecution of the
war. Liit'kiii-uHivntion and book edu
cation, he was possessed of unusual good
sense, which was at times of iinuieuse
value to the government. Senator Car
penter tells this of him: When the Ala
bama claims were under discussion by
the "high joints," England submitted a
proposition that was very severe. In
response to -a cable dispatch, the Eng
lish members of the "high joint ' were
told to withdraw entirely if the proposi
tion was rejected. In great distress
Secretary Fih sent for Senator Chan
dler. The point was explained to him by
Fish in the presence of Grant and the
whole Cabinet, and Chandler was asked,
' hat ahull we do?" Old Zach replied,
"Tell 'em Jo go to hell put it in diplo
matio language, of course. ' That is just
what was done, ahd it answered the pur
pose entirclv.

as irrelevant, and decided to close the case an
commit Killen for trial. Mr. Rea desired to
call as witnesses the Crown Solicitor, the Cath
olio Archbishop of Dublin, and one of the
members ot parliament lor npperary. au
was what finally broke down the patience
of the Magistrates. After committing
Killen, the Magistrates offered to neecp
the same amount of bail as in the
cases of Daly and Davitt. Rea protested
against the proceedings and said he hnd been
arranged with his client not to find bail. Tbe
Magistrates asked Killen whether ho would
find ball. Killen stoutly refused and offered
passive resistance to his rcmornl from Court.
He hung on the arm of two policeman with his

Report of tha Secretary of the Mary.
B. W. Thompson, Secretary of the Navy, in
his report of the condition and operations of tho
Navy Department, says : " The condition of
the navy has greatly improved during the past
year. There are now in commission thirty,
five vessels, consisting of cruisers, monitors.
and (orpedo bouts of different classes. Sixteen
can be put in condition for sea scrviee in a few
months, anil twenty can be made ready in
an emergency. With this done, the fighting
force of tho navy, which might be made avail -able
ii a very short lime, would consist of
eighty-one vessels of all classes. And If to this
number be added the four monitors. Terror,
Puritan, Amphllrltn, and Monadnock, mid
eighty powerful tnj?s, which can be fitted for
either bruisers or torpedo boats, our whole
NUMBER 35
effective fighting force would consist of ninety
three vessels."
The unexpended balance of appropriations
which stood to the credit of the department at
the close of the last - fiscal -year waa $1,418,-
285.37, which, added to the appropriation,
makes an aggregate of appropriations available
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, of
$14,502,250.67. ' '"-?
The table of estimates submitted of expenses
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, ag
gregate $14,864,147, showing an exiess over
the appropriations of the previous year of
$361,899. This excess is accounted for by the
faot that the estimate for the pay of the navy
was reduced $106,725 in the appropriations,
and that $90,000 will be required to set on foot
the system of training boy for the navy, and
by other expenses in various bureaus, which
are mentioned in detail. For the first time,
probably, in the history of tho government .the
expenses of the past year were less than the
amount 01 tne appropriation.

We summarise aa follows from the report:
In 1835 the United States was entirely out of
debt; January 1, 1861, the whole debt amoun
ted to $66,213,921. During tbe beginning of
the war tbe national debt increased at the rate
of $4,000,000 per month. This increase ranidlv
Increased as tne war progressed until, during
the last nine months preceding the close of he
war the debt was accruing at tne rate of tz,-
000,000 a day, and for tbe fire months next
thereafter it increased at the rate of $3,000,000,
or about $90,000,000 a month, reaching ita
maximum on August 31, 1865, at which date
it amounted to 2,845,907,626 less cash in
the treasury at that period, $88,218,055,
Tbe temporary loans, certificates of indebted
ness, seven-thirty notes, and all other items of
the debt, except the legal-tender notes and
fractional currency, which have been largely
reduced, have been paid, hare matured and
ceased to bear interest, or have been funded
into five-twenty six per cents., of which more
than one thousand six hundred millions (1,602,-
683,330) were issued.
The reduction on the interest bearing debt
of the United States, from its highest point,
on August 31, 1865, to November 1, 1879, is
$583,886,594, of which amount $105,160,900 was
accomplished since the refunding operations
were commenced on May 1, 181.
At the highest point the annual interest on
the debt was - $150,977,697, while it is now
83,773,778, only. . - i ' i t
Th total annual reduction of interest under
these refunding operations since March, 1877,
has been $14,296,177, while the saving on this
account, growing out of the operations of the
present year alone, is nearly nine millions
18,803,707), and the total annual saving in
all the refunding operations of the Government
sinoe 1871 is twenty millions (19,907,607).
These funding transaction are believed to be
without parallel in financial history.
The Government ha still outstanding $273,-
681,350 in six per cent, and more tban Tooo,
000,006 in five per cents, all of which will
mature in 1881. The refunding of these bonds
into four per cents, will save $10,473,000 in in
terest annually. Th credit of the Govern
ment is now such that it it not improbable
that long before it maturity th present debt
may be refunded into three and a half per cent-
bonds, which is one-half per cent, more than
the rate cf the English consols, thus saving to
to tha Government a large additional amount
of interest, .., ,.ojfii... . ,

xne banks ot tne country at wo uaio oi
sumption held more than one-third of the out
standing treasury notes ; but they had so much
confidence in the ability of the Secretary to
maintain resumption that none were presented
by them for redemption. . The people also, who
held more than $3(10,000.000 of the issue of the
national banks, which tsmiei were based apoa
tho bonds of the nation, preferred such notes to
coin itself. There was, therefore, no demand
for payment of the notes of the Government,
and the gold coin in the Treasury, which
amounted to $1:15,000,000 on the day ot resump
tion, increased more than :ilt,000,000 in th
next ten mouths, tbe iiim unt held on the first
day of November, IS7W, exceeding $171,000,000.

which gives the value In cents of the standard
gold dollar in legal-tender paper dollars on
July 1st of each year from 1864 to 1878, and
also January 1st of the present year :
The old forms of tables, giving the amounts
and kinds of currency in circulation, ara now
obsolete, and must be superseded by new ones.
'which shall include not only the paper currency,
but also tne coin 01 tne country, 'lbe total
amount of the circulating medium can not, for
this reason, be hereafter accurately given, inch
total being affected by estimates of the amount -of
coin in the country. The latter amount is
estimated by the Director of the Mint to hav
been $427,000,000 on the first day of .November
in this year, of which amount $121,000,000 was .
in silver coin. If this estimate is correct, th
circulating medium on that data was composed
as follows :
ireaaury notes outstanding. ......... 1346.681.016
National bank notes outstanding 337,191,418
Gold in the Treasury, less certificates

Estimated amount of coin held by the
people .. ... 231,478,816
Total .11,165,553,504
The estimated total currency of the eountry
on November 1st thus appear to hav been
more than $165,000,000, which amount is at
least $380,000,000 in excess of the highest point -reached
between the suspension and the re
sumption of specie payment.
.Notwithstanding tne large increase or specie
in the country during the past year the amount
held by the banks has by no mean increased
in proportion, ine amount held on October 1,
1878, was $30,688,606 ; on the first day of Jan
nary, 1879, $41,499,757, and on the second of
October last, $42,173,732, showing an increase
on that day of not less than $700,000 since re
sumption day. The more recent return, how
ever, 01 tne national banks in tbe city of
New York to the Clearing House for the week
ending November 15, show a further increase
of $21,239,400. The amount of cash reserve
now required to be held by all of tbe banks is
less than $94,000,000.
From this statement it will be seen that the
banks outside the large cities held, on October
2, $11,474,961 of specie, which nearly equals
three-fourths of the full amount of cash reserve
which they are required to hold, while the
banks of New York and in the other principal
cities neld in specie considerably less than one
half of their legal cash reserve.
The Controller urgently - recommend that
all the national bank shall take advantage of
the present influx t gold-to aocumnlat in
their vaults an amount equal to .the total cash
reserve required by law. He indulges the
hope that the reports of another year may
show them to be possessed oat least $100,000,-
000 of gold com. if tnis coin, which is still
flowing into the treasury, shall also be largely
accumulated by the banks, t will be more
likely to become diffused among the people.
Resumption ha mad tne dollar ot the same
valne at home and abroad. The refunding of
the debt has placed funds in the hand
of such holders as have declined to re
invest in the four per cents. The gold har
vests, the shipment'of produce, the large an
nnal production of gold, and silver from the
mines, and the importation of gold which still
continues will certainly make money abundant,
and have already stimulated speculation to an
unhealthy degree, and will be likely to 00 so
in the future, hot long hence, the specie
which has so long been hoarded, or which has
hitherto been used only in the payment to tho 1
Government of duties on imports or in the
purchase of foreign exchange, will be brought
into general use. The effect of the present in
creasing and prospective redundancy of cur
rency is manifest in the transactions of the
Stock Board during the lost three months,
which are said to be the largest on record, one-
fourth of which are estimated to have been
based upon stocks which pay no dividends.
Alter quoting an extract J ruin a um u-
dress by Leone Levi, at King's College, Lon
don, the Controller winds np his report in the
following language :
" Historv repeats itseit : and tne experience
of England, and of Germany, and our own ex
perience in former days, seems not unlikely
again to be repeated in this country. Af cur
rency which will adapt itself to the existing
circumstances is particularly neeaea -in-present
time, and it will be the province of
Congress to watch carefully the indications of
an exoesa. of paper money, and to prevent by
proper legislation -the mischief and danger of
a redundant and nbn-elaetie currency." ,;
