NINE JURORS CHOSEN
Flushing, N. Y., Dec 13. An addi
tional panel of. one hundred tales
men, drawn last night, filled the trial
room "to overflowing to-day and
when Thornton Hains was brought
into court his wrist locked with steel
nipper to a deputy sheriff, he had to
edge his way through the throng.
Hains does not like being manacled
to a deputy sheriff declaring thut he
would not escape if given the oppor
tunity. "They could turn him out of Long
Island jail every morning unattended
and he would come immediately to
cr urt," said Lawyer Mclntyre.
Mrs William E. Annis, widow of
the publisher held a conference with
District Attorney Darrin to-day be
fore court convened. Dressed in
black, Mrs Annis was the cynosure of
all eyes. She will be one of the prin
cipal witnesses for the state and as
an eyewitness of the shooting tell of
the events that transpired from the
time of the arrival of the Hains
brothers at the yacht club to the
shooting at the water's edge.
Much interest w-as caused to-day
when it was developed that William
Hecker, a shipping clerk and the
third juror in the case was selected
by Thornton Hains in opposition to
his counsel. Hains said that he
thought Hecker would make an ac
ceptable juror and though counsel
opposed him he had his way and
Hecker took his" seat In the jury box.
Justice Crane announced at the
opening of court that he had receiv
ed from the county judge a certificate
authorizing the appointment of El
mer S. White and James A. Dayton
as special prosecutors. Mr Mclntyre
vigorously opposed the employment
of other counsel for the state declar
ing that It was a wrong practice. He
insisted that Mr Dayton came into
the case at the Instance of the Bay
side Yacht club but Justice Crane di
rected that the appearance of the
two special prosecutors be noted and
the order of the county judge carried
out. Mr Mclntyre said he would ask
the county judge to have the order
vacated. Tae examination of tales
men was then begun and Mr White
as special prosecutor undertook the
questioning of talesmen.
The examination of the first six
talesmen occupied some time but did
not result In the selection of any ju
rors. The prospective jurymen being
excused for various causes. Some had
fixed opinions of the case. One had
a prejudice against the carrying of
firearms and another failed to com
prehend the character of counsel's
questions and then pleaded illness.
The seventh talesman examined,
Alexander Jardin, a plumber of Long
Island City, was selected as the sev
enth juror. Counsel for the state
had withdrawn all changes when it
was developed that Jardjn had up to
a few years ago lived in Texas. Pros
ecutor White thought to submit a
peremptory challenge after stating
that the talesman was satisfactory to
the state. Justice Crane said he be
lieved the talesman to have quali
fied as a most satisfactory juror and
directed that Jardin be drawn. Hains
appeared delighted with Jardin's se
lection. The seventh juror is said to
have Indian blood in his veins.
Hugh McCullah, a milk dealer,
was the eighth juror secured.
Louis New was selected as the
ninth juror. He Is a carpenter.

HARRIMAN VICTORY.
Interstate Commerce Commission Is
Not Baffled.
AVashlngton, Dee. 15. Members of
he interstate commerce commission
.aid today that the decision of 1 lie
United States supreme court in the
;ase of E. H. Harriman and Otto Kahn
would prove an empty victory to Mr.
Harriman.
It is not felt by the comnilssion'that
the decision will affect seriously" its
powers of railroad regulation, inas
much as the questions propounded to
Mr. Harriman and to Mr. Kahn did
Hot affect materially the determination
of the so called "Harriman cases."
Chairman Knapp of the commission
said that the decision could not de
tract in any material way from the
powers of the commission In the mak
ing of future Investigations regarding
railway transactions. This opinion
was concurred in by other members of
the commission.
The opinion justified the refusal of
Messrs. Harriman and Kahn to make
reply to questions put by the commis
sion in the course of an inquiry con
cerning the dealings of Mr. Harriman
ss president of the T'nion Pacific in
ihe stocks of other railroad companies,
many of which are competing lines.
In a dissenting opinion, concurred in
by Justices Harlan and McKenna. Jus
tice Day declared that the effect of
(he opinion of the majority of the
,'ourt would be to materially narrow
the scope of the interstate commerce
law.
BOSTON PROHIBITION FIGHT.
Biff Battle On Again In Bay State
To-Day.
' Boston, Dec 15. The last but one
of the municipal elections in Massa
chusetts' 33 cities were held to-day,
when Boston .Newburyport and
North Adams chose city officials for
1909 and decided upon the question
of legalizing the sale of intoxicating
liquors. Cambridge is the only city
which has not yet voted.
The license issue was wel! to the
front in the popular interest over the
outcome of to-day's elections in New
buryport and North Adams. Both
these cities elected mayors in addi
tion to members of the city govern
ment, while in Boston there was no
voting for mayor.
Newburyport was expected to
maintain its majority of votes in fa
vor of no license but the outlook in
North Adams was less certain on
either side. Last year's vote in the
latter city was expected to return a
large majority in favor of license.

NO BLOCKADE YET
Washington, Dec 15. The exist
ence of what amounts practically to
a state of war between Holland and
Venezuela, the absence for the first
time in many years in an acute crisis
of this kind of American warships
from the proper sphere of influence,
and the profession by the state de
partment officials of their Ignorance
of the intention of Holland, constl
tues a most curious and Interesting
International situation. The fact
that America has a quarrel of her
own with Venezuela and has termi
nated diplomatic relations with that
country, gives rise to doubt as to the
accuracy of the statement that (hit)
government is not interested in what
is going on off the coast of Venezue
la. Indeed there is reason to believe
that while the official records may
fail to show the existence of any for
mal agreement between America and
the Netherlands, the government, of
the latter country is proceeding with
the tacit consent of America to bring
to an end the chaotic conditions
that have prevailed in an internation
al sense in Venezuela for the past
two years. So long as the Dutch
ships act strictly within the lines cf
the Monroe doctrine, as construed in
the annual message to congress of
President. Roosevelt last year; so
long as no attempt is made to seize
Venezuelan territory for permanent
ocupation, there probably will be no
interference on the part of the
United States government. Logical
ly the next step will be the declara
tion of a blockade and of this due
notice must be given by Holland to
all maritime nations in order to pre
vent the lodgement of claims for un
warrantable injury inflicted upon
neutral commerce.
MR MARSHALL (iOXK
Said to Have Worked in Harmony
With C. W .Mabie.
Bridgeport, Dec 15. Since the ap
pearance of W. O. Marshall in this
city and a vehement attack upon
the prohibition candidate for gov
ernor, there have been developments
which are believed to connect the
movement against the prohibition
nominee with attack upon the anti
saloon league by C. W.. Mabie of-Detroit.
.
Efforts have for some time past
been made to locate Mr Marshall,
but his present whereabouts are as
mysterious as his entrance ;to Con
necticut and his pyrotechnical cam
paign in an automqbile throughout
the state.
In a special despatch to The Tele
gram from Detroit. t. is stated that
gram from Detroit it is stated that
in that city, but had given them up
and disappeared. From other
sources the information comes that
these officers were in close proxi
mity to those of Mr Mabie, who has
conducted such vigorous warfare
against the anii-saioon league. In
fact, it. has been stated that the two
were working in harmony, if not in
actual relationship.

were of the Impression that the
schools were not to be closed for the

noon and were about to appoint a
committee to wait upon Superinten
dent Tinker when it was learned tlve
vacation would start at noon on

In view of the stormy session in
the aldermanic chamber last evening
it does not look as though the teach

organized chiefly to better their
financial condition and one of the
prime movers in the organization
said to-day that, last night's meeting
would have little effect upon th

DEATHS IN NOVEMBER
Hartford, Dec 1G. There ' were
1,138 deaths during the month of
November in this state, according to
the mortality reports received by the
Connecticut state board of health
and sent out to-day in its month'
bulletin. This was 73 less than In
October, 103 less than in November
of last year, and 87 less than the
average number of deaths during
November for the five years preced
ing. The death rate was 13.5 for the
large towns, for the small towns 12.0
and for the whole state 13.1. The
deaths reported from infectious dis
eaess were 181, being 15.9 per cent
of the total mortality.
Speaking of the Red Cross Christ
mas stamp the report says:
"Everywhere in the state where
people are interested in the fight
against the great white plague the
Christmas stamps are being sold.
The National Red Cross Society has
been literally overwhelmed with or
ders, as the demand has much ex
ceeded the expectation, so that re
mote will be the place from which
comes the Christmas mail that does
not bear this stamp.
"These stamps, of course, hav3 no
postal value, but may be attached to
letters, parcels and post cards to
carry the Christmas greeting, and
are also for decoration, like the little
holly stickers generally used. Those
who use them will have the satisfac
tion of knowing that in addition to
adding an ornament to their letters
and packages, they have also mada
use of one 'bulletin, the fight against
tuberculosis.' In this state the
money received is going for local
tuberculosis work. It is all right to
tell consumptives to eat nourising
food, but useless when they are un
able to procure it; or to tell them to
sleep with the windows open when
they do not have bed clothes enough
to keep them warm. These are some
of the necessities that must be sup
plied." WAS XOX-Sl'ITKD.
Suddf'u Termination of Cottle Suit
