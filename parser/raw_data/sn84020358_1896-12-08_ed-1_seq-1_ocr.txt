CONGRESS RESUMES WORK
SHX. ITU ASD BOMB It E ASSEMBLED
YESTERDAY.
Large Crowd Present Both Chambers
Contained Many Floral Tribute From
Steinberg' Admirers President's Mes
sage Read House Adjourns Out of Re
spect to the Late Speaker Crisp.
Washington, Dec. 7. Congress re
sumed business at the old stand to-day
in the presence of one of the largest
crowds that have ever witnessed the
opening of a short session. A perfect
day and the possibility that the presi
dent's last annual message to congress
might contain something sensational
relative to the Cuban question proved
to be Irresistible attractions at the cap
itol. Senators and representatives were In
holiday attire, and every statesman
who owneda silk hat wore It to-day.
The crowd of spectators commenced
moving on the capitol long before 11
o'clock, and as soon as the doors lead
s' lng to the senate and house galleries
were opened there was a grand scram
ble for the most desirable seats.
As usual the house proved to be the
most attractive point for the sightseers.
The rules of that body are more pliable
than those in force in the senates and
the spectators who could not obtain
seats in the galleries had the small sat
isfaction of wandering around on the
floor of the house brushing against the
early arriving members until the order
to "clear the floor" was given. A ma
jority of the occupants of the house
and senate galleries were women, who
; had taken vthe precaution to provide
themselves with tickets of admission
from friendly congressmen.
The senate chamber, 4n its new dress
and wrth the Improvements in the seat
ing capacity, evoked general commen
dation, and the floral display was fully
up to the standard.
In the house floral displays were in
profusion, but only one attracted gen
eral attention. This was a green and
white wreath on a black background,
and was placed on the desk occupied
by the former leader of the democrats
in the house, the late Speaker Crisp.
All interest in this session of Congress
attaches to the senate, because the
house has nothing whatever to do ex-
cppt pass the regular appropriation
bills and act on such measures as may
, come from the senate. Speaker Reed
cleaned up the house calendar com
pletely last session, and so the senate is
now alone ' responsible for legislation
during the brief remainder of the life
of the Fifty-fourth congress.
There is still a wide difference of
opinion among the republicans as to
what will be or can be done, and more
than one senatorial caucus may be
' necessary before a decision, is reached.
. The semi-official statement of Sena
tor Thurston, made in the presence of
Mark Hanna, that an extra session will
be called to meet about March 16, is
generally accepted as sealing definitely
the fate of the Dlngley bill and putting
off the question of tariff and financial
legislation to be settled by the new
congress. There was, therefore, only
one topic of interest at the capitol to
day, and that was with regard to what
the president would say in his message.
Promptly at 12 o'clock Speaker Reed
called the house to order without a
word of introduction and, the members
all standing, the chaplain offered the
customary morning prayer.
The roll of members by states was
then called, and the second and final
session of the Fifty-fourth congress
was under way.
At 12:40 o'clock an adjournment was
taken until 1:30 o'clock.
Both houses reassembled at 1:30
o'clock.
Shortly after reassembling the presi
dent's message was read in the house,
y When the reading of the message
was finished it was on motion of Mr.
Dlngley, rep., of Maine, together with
the accompanying documents, referred
to the committee of the whole and or
dered printed.
W. A. Stone, rep., of Pennsylvania,
from the appropriations committee, re
ported the pensions bill for the coming
fiscal year.
Mr. Turner, dem., of Georgia, on be
ing recognized, state that it was his
duty to inform the house of the death
of his colleague, ex-Speaker Crisp, who
died at Atlanta, Ga on October 23. At
a later day he would ask that a day be
assigned to pay proper respect to Mr.
Crisp's distinguished character and
eminent public services. He offered the
following:
' Resolved, That the house has heard
with profound sorrow of the death of
Hon. Charles F. Crisp, late a represen
tative from the state of Georgia.
Resolved, That as a mark of respect
to his memory the house do now ad
i journ.
! The resolutions were adopted and the
house at 3:50 adjourned.
In the Senate.
Washington, Dec. 7. At first close
attention was paid to the message by
senators, most of them following the
reading with pamphlet copies of the
message in hand. The Judicial sum
ming up of the Cuban question by the
statement that when the inability of
Spain to deal successfully with the in
surgents has become manifest a situa
tion will be presented in which our ob
ligations, w hich we can hardly hesitate
to recognize and discharge also, seem
ed to be satisfactory to both sides of
the chamber. Very little attention was
paid by senators to the other portions
of the message which had to do solely
with internal affairs. The reading oc
cupied an hour and fifty minutes. The
message was laid on the table and the
atnate adjourned.
HOW IT IS REGARDED.
Views of KenresentHtlveK Concerning the
President's Message.
Washington, Dec. 7. Neither senate
nor house had a good opportunity of
Judging of the president's message by
the public reading of it, which was done
In the most perfunctory and monoto
nous manner, no one In either chamber
paid marked attention to it, after the
Cuban passage had been read. .The re
port of Secretary OIncy, copies of which
had be obtained, seemed to attract as
much interest as the message itself.
Members and senators were chary In
their comments. Some of the opinions
expressed follow:
Speaker Reed said: "It seems hardly
necessary to 'comment upon the mes
sage. It Is calm in tone and on the
Cuban question will be much more sat
isfactory to the community than it
would have been a year ago, as much
sounder ideas prevail than prevailed
then.
"I wish there had been as frank an
acknowledgment of the deficit a year
ago as now. The idea that the revenue
is sufficient, being made so by borrow
ing, seems to me hardly tenable."
Representative Barrett, rep., Massa
chusetts. "The message shows that
the administration will do nothing re
garding Cuba. An attempt will be
made to get congress to force the presi
dent into some radical measures. I do
not believe it will succeed. That and
the Hawaiian question will go over to
the new administration. The demo
crats get no cue from the message ex
cept to do nothing. The measure shows
a clear purpose to veto every republi
can measure of relief."
Representative Morse "What the
president says of the Turkish situation
does credit to his humanity. His de
nunciation of the treachery, weakness
and imbecility of the Turkish govern
ment speak the sentiment of the coun
try. What he says about the struggle
in Cuba and his intentions to Spain are
patriotic, humane and perhaps as far
as the country is justified in going in
the present situation." :
Representative Walker of Massachu
setts "What the president says about
the weakness of our hanking 'system
and its reform Is most admirable.
When he suggests, however, that the
greenbacks be retired by the issue of
bonds he forgets that we passed an act
in 1866 to retire them and. when only
$59,000,000 had been retired the people
rose up and congress repealed the act."
VIEWS OK SENATORS
On President's Message Senator Piatt
Characterizes it as Conservative.
Washington, Dec. 27. Of the members
of the senate v committee on foreign
relations Senators Sherman, Davis.
Cameron, Lodge; Gray, Turpie, Daniel
and Mills refused to discuss the presi
dent's message" in the most formal way.
Other senators of prominence who de
clined to talk were Messrs. Adlrich,
Vest, Faulkner, Hill, Woleott, Gorman
and Jones.
Senator Morgan of Alabama, mem
ber of the committee on foreign rela
tions, said the assertion by the presi
dent that no other nation must inter
fere in Cuban affairs was the most
decisive declaration of the Monroe doc
trine that has yet 'been. made. The
message called the great civil war an
insurrection and, on this false declara
tion 'it justified active aid to Spain in
furnishing all kinds of military muni
tions and refused the right to send any
thing to the insurgents. Senator Mor
gan regretted that this national action
was so illogical and unjust and must
still cost many lives and suffering to
a people admitted by the message to
be at war for the sake of liberty.
Senator Frye of Maine, of the for
eign relations committee, said: "The
message is commonplace. So far as the
Cuban question is concerned the presi
dent argues on both sides of the sub
ject." Senator Piatt said: "The message is
conservative, but contains an intima
tion to Spain that if the war is not ter
minated by according home rule in Cu
ba the United States will be called up
on to act. In this the people of the
United States will sustain the presi
dent. On the tariff question Mr. Cleve
land has, manifestly, not seen any
change of heart from his free trade
fallacies."
HEW YORK'S BICYCLE RACE.
Feature of Testerday's Riding Was the
Work of Hale and Reading.
New York, Dec. 7. The feature of
the first day of ,the six day bicycle race
at Madison Square Garden was the
battle for the leadership in the nine
teenth and twentieth hours between
Teddy Hale, the Irish rider, and Read
in, of Omaha. Hale retired for about
forty-five minutes and at 12 o'clock, be
ing then in the lead at 230 miles, 8 laps.
Reading, who had been following close
on the Irishman's. heels, then assumed
the lead and held it until 8 o'clock. Hale
had been gaining steadily and a des
perate sprinting match between the
pair set in at o'clock, when Hale was
a trlrle under two miles behind the
Omaha man. The Irishman had the
Yank's speed. Reading distinguished
himself during the early hours by his
endurance ride. He remained in the
saddle without change until he had ac
complished 260 miles in 14 hours, 10
minutes, establishing a world's record
for endurance in a bicycle contest of
any kind.
The value of his performance was
further enhanced by the fact that he
only dismounted to change his saddle.
He divided the honors of leadership
with Hale throughout the afternoon,
and was close up at midnight. All
previous records were surpassed every
hour by the leaders. Waller, who was
badly shaken up in a collision with
Van Embergh in the early morning,
was forced to retire during the after
noon. Van Embergh was unable to
' ride after the fall, but Waller went on.
It is doubtful if the latter will be able
i to come In. Champion Eddie Bald
rode an exhibition mile in the evening,
paced by the "black and white" tan
dem. His time was 2:08 1-5 seconds on
the outside of the track, the fastest
.mile ever ridden ia the garden.
DEFEAT FOR HEALTH BOARD

pointed Aldermen's Busy Night Hack
Ordinance Killed Keport of Finance
Board.
The opponents of the proposed loca
tion in the Twelfth ward of the conta
gious disease hospital were out in force
last evening, at the aldermanlc meet
ing. Arranged along the rear of the
room were the remonstrants ready to
support, If called upon, the members
who espoused their cause. When
Clerk Lyon had finished reading
the report of the committee on ordi
nances, Alderman Kinney moved to
strike out the recommendation of the
committee and insert the prayer of 'the
remonstrants. The recommendation
referred to was in substance that the
board of health proceed with the erec
tion of the hospital on the lot already
purchased. The prayer of the remon
strants asked that the board be not al
lowed to locate the hospital in the lot
In question.
Alderman Kinney withdrew his mo
tion at the request of Alderman Chtl
lingworth, who said that at the request
of a brother alderman he had opened
negotiations with the General Hospital
society for the location of the propos
ed isolated hospital on the hospital
grounds, and, together with the alder
men, had written a letter to the presi
dent of the society asking whether the
society would entertain a proposition
to enter into a contract with the city
of New Haven, as provided for in sec
tion 5 of the act approved June 28, 1893.
Also, the communication asked upon
what terms such a contract could be
kmade.
As a result of this communication
over twenty of the directors of the so
ciety met and carefully considered the
matter, which resulted In the adoption
of the following resolution and letter:
Whereas, the president of the society has
been informally asked by members of the
city government if the society would enter
tain a proposition from the city looking to
the establishment of an Isolated Hospital
on the grounds of the society
Voted That the directors of the society
would consider favorably such a proposi
tion provided the Isolation Hospital was
placed under the control and management
of this society.

Gentlemen Your letter of Nov. 27th. ad
dressed to mo as President of the General
Hospital Society, has been submitted to the
Board of Directors of said society.
The Board believes It the duty of this so
ciety to extend every facility possible to the
city authorities for the care and treatment
of the sick, subject of course to the rules
and regulations of the institution.
Regarding terms find conditions, that Is n
matter that would require consideration and
negotiation between the city and hospital
authorities. I,et me add that our Board at
its meeting appointed a committee to con
sider these matters, provided the Court of
Common Council, in Its official capacity,
should see tit to take any action looking to
ward an agreement with our society.
The enclosed resolution which was adopt
ed shows the spirit with which the proposi
tion was met by our Bonrd.
Very respectfully vonrs,
S. E. MKRWIX. President.
General Hospital Society.
Alderman Belden said that this atti
tude of the directors of the general hos
pital was at variance with that which
had been reported to his commltte.e.
Much pains had been taken to Inves
tigate the exact status of this phase of
the hospital question, and the same
negative answer had invariably result
ed. Mr. Belden Intimated that had the
committee been in possession of the
information given by Alderman Chil
lingworth there might have been dif
ferent report made, but after a careful
investigation of the matter, in view of
all the circumstances surrounding the
case, the committee saw fit to make the
report Just read, and he was convinced
more than ever of the fitness of the
place selected by the board of health.
Alderman Macdonald, who had an
tagonized his colleague (Chillingworth)
during the greater part of the session,
came to his assistance. This solution
of the question had suggested itself to
him some days ago. He was happy to
find that his colleagues had effected
so much toward the settling of the
contagious disease hospital question.
The following vote was passed:
Voted That His Honor, the Mayor, ap
point two aldermen mid the president of
the eouncilmen and three councilmen, to
whom nil matters relating to the proposed
hospital for contagious and Infectious dis
eases is hereby referred, and which com
mittee are authorized nnd empowered to
negotiate with the President and Directors
of the General Hospital Society, or any
committee appointed by them, to ascertain
and report to this or the incoming Court of
Common Council the conditions and terms
upon which said society will care nnd pro
vide for city patients In ait Isolation Hos
pital to be erected for , u purpose.
Voted That all votes or orders Inconsist
ent herewith are hereby repealed.
The new building ordinance, which
was reported by the special committee
appointed to revise the ordinance gov
erning the same, was tabled.
The board concurred in the action
of the councllmanic board ordering a
new 'bridge at the railroad crossing on
East Chapel street.
The proposition to appoint a board
of managers to look after patriotic
ceremonies on July 4, 1897, and for
each succeeding year, the board being
a continuous one, was laid upon the
table at the suggestion of Alderman
Rourke.
The report of the board of finance up
r.n the estimates for the year 1897 was
table for printing.
The following explanatory communi
cation accompanied the report of the
board of finance:
"The present situation of the financial af
fairs of the city should be somewhat denned
at this time that you may be prepared for
final action. To conform to the law it Is
absolutely forbidden to increase tile expend
itures beyond the estimated Income each
year, and this should le considered a sutli
cicnt reason why the board of finance can
not recommend appropriations to carry for
ward much public work, though it may be
deemed necessary, and in which all sections
of the city are alike interested.
"Von will observe that the board of fi
nance bus so seriously considered the bridge
question us to recommend that your lioiior-
uoie uody at no distant nay take ueciucu
measures recommending that the necessary
lower be acquired to further bond the city
to cover the necessary cost in building such
new bridges us will be required during the
next live years, for a well constructed
bridge is considered a permanent Improve
ment, und it will reuuire not less than live
years to meet ail demands. Therefore, all
appropriations for bridges nave been leu
out that the expense of the same iiiny be
provided for by the issue of bridge bonds.
The t'ol owhiir new bridges are contemplat
ed for the Improvement of hind travel and
navigation: (. impel street, over railroad ;
new drawbridge, Clmpel street, over Mill
river i Tonillnson's bridge, westerly ap
proach ; Kimberly avenue drawbridge, V'ii
sou street bridge; Orange street, bridge.
East Hock aproach; Edgewood avenue
bridge: Derby avenue bridge.
"It has been a quest lou with the mem
bers of the hoard of tliiauce as to the au
thority for any department to assume the
responsibility to Increase its expenditures
beyond its regular appropriations Willi a
view of adding largely to the force of tliem
or otherwise, in anticipation of meeting the
sanction of the board of finance nnd the np,
provul of the common council. This is in
reference to' the increase of eighteen men
to grade E of the supernumerary force of
the police department, wherein the otlicials
of that department state that these men are
appointed ami are now on duty,, which, if
permitted, possibly necessitates u large in
crease in the expenditures of that depart
ment which are not provided for in this re
port, of the board of finance.
"The board of finance cannot meet this
requirement at this time though it appears
to them that the necessity actually exists
for the better protection of the city.
"If the several departments were nil al
lowed the Increases asked for, a lnrge in
crease In taxation would be necessary, and
In order to meet the requirements us re
ported, the board has decided to recommend
an increase of one-half mill. This will keep
the tax rate for the city and the town the
same as last year, and this Is necessitated
by the many street improvements ordered,
such as topdressing, or hardening, the ex
tension of t iiion avenue, and the two police
precincts, Nos. 3 and 4, as ordered, and also
the Increase in the interest account.
"This statement the board trusts will ex
plain Its action, together with the recom
mendation, to prevent any complications
and differences, anil that your honorable
body will, without change, approve this re
port." .
Alderman Chillingworth led the op
position to the amendment allowing
suburban residents the use of the pub
lic library.
Aldermen Smith and Macdonald, who
championed the cause of the amend
ment, did not thin"k that the children
of Strong school should be compelled to
do without books. Mr. Macdonald said
that he 'had never, and he would not,
legislate to the detriment of the rising
generation. It took and aye and nay
vote to decide the matter. The ballot
stood: aye 12, nay 8.
The following is the text of the
amendment:
, Section 9. Said board of directors may
make rules extending upon such terms and
under such conditions as to tile board may
seem best, all tlie privileges of said library
to any or all of the following classes of per
sons, viz.: First, to non-residents attending
school or college within the limits of said
City of New Haven; second, to non-residents
doing business in- said City of New
Haven, who pay taxes therein: third, to
persons resident in the Town of New Ha
ven, outside the City limits, provided the
Town of New Haven sha!! make an appro
priation for the benefti. .of said lllirarv
which shall be satisfactory to said hoard of
directors; fourth, to persons resident in the
boroughs of VVcstville, Fnir'Haven Bust, or
West Haven, provided the borough In which
they reside shall make an appropriation for
the benefit of sail! library which shall be
satisfactory to said board of directors;
fifth, to all other non-residents on the pay
ment to the use of said library of such
sums as shall be satisfactory to said board
of directors.
, The library bonding amendment,
which proposes to bond the city in
$100,000 for the purpose of extending the
facilities of the free public library, was
next taken up. Alderman Chillingworth
again opposed the directors of the free
library. He spoke eloquently of the ob
ligation of the members to do their
duty. He did not believe in obligating
the city of New Haven any further. He
did not believe in burning bridges be
hind him.
Alderman Smith referred the gentle
man from the Tenth to the fact that
the board had already apropriated $50,-
000 for bridges, and contemplated other
expenditures. Where wa3 the economy
in taking away from the education fa
cilities of the citizens of the city and
building bridges? This was one of the
bridges that should be built.
Aldeman , Macdonald supported the
resolution. He said we have just pass
ed a resolution authorizing an unlimit
ed amount for bridges. "I asked how
much, and there was no reply," he con
tinued. Alderman Rourke replied: "We must
build the bridge." This Mr. Macdonald
claimed was not an explanation.
The motion was lost.
The proposed amendment of the hack
license ordinance was indefinitely post
poned. The following letter was read from
Superintendent Smith on the subject:
New Haven, Conn., Dec. 5, 1806.
Felix Chilingworth. Esq.,
Alderman
Replying to your Inquiry I would sny that
1 have carefully examined the proposed Or
dinance and Amendments de Public Convey
ances and am of the opinion that it would
be unwise to adopt them In their present
form. In my judgment the proposed ordi
nance savors too much of so-called "class
legislation." A hack or any public vehicle
licensed for public hire should have Its
number on Its lamps and the lamps should
be lighted at night in order to afford the
police an opportunity to see who the driver
Is, in case of any trouble or accident. The
driver of every itcensed vehicle should be
compelled to wear his license number ex
posed to view on the left breast of his outer
garment, and in all cases the tariff rates
should be conspicuously posted on the in
side of every licensed vehicle.

as there was no election for mayor or
city officers this year.
Putnam, Dec. 7. But little interest

A KENTUCKY LYNCHING BEE
AMOB WllJSAKS ITS YEXGliAXCB ox
in O ALLEGED MURDERERS.
The Victims Were Confined in Jail It Was
Alleged That They Killed a Woman and
Two Children Jail Broken Into Bodies
of the Men Found Swinging to a Tree
They Protested Their Innocence,
Lexington, Mo., Dec. 7. A mob of un
masked men, two hundred In number,
broke into the jail here this morning
and then hammered down the doors to
the cells in which were confined James
Nelson and Jesse Winner, charged with
the murder of Mrs. Winner and two
children near liberty in October last.
The mob dragged the prisoners from
the prison and carried tham away in
the darkness over into Ray county,
where they hanged them to a tree.
The jail was guarded by five men.
The guards were covered with Win
chesters before they were aware that
any one was near.
Jailer Goode refused to deliver the
keys when a demand was made, so
sledges were used In breaking down the
doors. Both prisoners protested their
innocence, but without avail.
Maggie Catron, a woman with whom
Winner was intimate, made a full con
fession on Saturday to the county pros
ecutors, implicating Jesse Winner, Lon
Lackey and James Nelson In the crime.
She made an affidavit in which she said
that on the night of October 26 Winner,
Lackey and Nelson drove to the Win
ner house, and that Winner killed his
wife and Nelson cut the throats of the
two children, while Lackey held the
horse at the fence.
Thomas Sick and wife, uncle and
aunt of Maggie Catron, made affida
vits to the effect that Winner, Lackey
and Nelson were In their house between
10 and 11 o'clock on the night of the
murder looking for the girl, and that
they went away together in a buggy.
This evidence convinced the people of
their guilt and the lynching followed.
The bodies were found this morning
half a mile from the river in Ray coun
ty, hanging to ah oak tree. Their
hands were tied behind their backs and
they were swinging from the same
limb, Nelson's feet barely touching the
ground. His face bore' the same grave
look as when he was taken from jail.
Winner's face bore the look of cow
ardice, and had an expression of horror
upon It. Winner's watch, which had
stopped at 3 a. m., was still in his pock
et. His feet touched the ground, but
his legs were bent at the knees. Hun
dreds. of people flocked to the scene to
see the dead bodies. " ... - . '
Lon Lackey, who had also been in
jail here under a charge of complicity
in the murder, was taken back to Rich
mond Saturday, which fact alone saved
his life, as he would certainly have
been lynched with the others. The
probabilities are that vengeance will
be meted out to him later. Winner
when led out of his cell this morning
was ' trembling with fear. Nelson
clearly showed that he was not afraid.
The mob members made no effort to
conceal their Identity. The.majority of
the mob were young men. Winner ad
mitted to a prisoner in the jail last
night that he was guilty. Prosecuting
Attorney Aull says:
"I have evidence sufficient to identify
some- of the mob and have the names
of others. If it is the last act of my life
I expect to bring the perpetrators to
justice, and shall request the assist
ance of the attorney general and all
the power that the state can lend to
see that such conspiracies against the
law are punished and the conspirators
brought to justice."
STATE LOSES $00,000.
Caused by Error in Computing the Tax of
if. T t If. H. and H. K.B.
Hartford, Dec. 7. Henry L. Goodwin
of East Hartford, a stockholder of the
New York, New Haven and Hartford
railroad, 'has written a letter to State
Treasurer Hodge claiming that an er
ror has 'been made in computing the
tax due the state from the company
and that the eiTor makes the tax ap
pear to be about $50,000 less than it
actually is. The error consists in de
ducting from the amount of the rail
road's property subject to taxation the
sum of $7,632,928 and in computing the
tax on only the remainder left after
such deduction was ma.de.
Mr.. Goodwin claims that in making
the returns to the comptroller the road
has not used the blank forms issued by
the state but has made its returns in
type-written form, omitting to give the
funding and floating debt occasioned
by expenses of construction and equip
ment and the amount of capital stock
issued for each construction and equip
ment. His contention is that the road
reports having expended $4,758,703 for
the construction and equipment of the
Harlem river and Portchester railroad,
a leased road, when the "Consolidated"
road has issued no capital stock nor
Incurred any indebtedness for expen
ditures on Mat road.
Mr. Goodwin urges the treasurer to
not accept the tax to be paid as full
payment to the state, but to give the
road a receipt on account The state
board of equalization has accepted the
returns as submitted by the road. Sev
eral years ago in a suit brbught by
the state against the road to recover
back taxes due through incorrect re
turns the supreme court held that the
returns were incorrect but that the
acceptance of the returns by the board
of equalization was final.
General Pension Bill.
Washington, Dec 7. The general
pension bill for the year ending June
30, 1898, which was to-day reported to
the bouse from the committee, carries
a total of $141,263,880. This is $65,000
less than the appropriation for the cur
rent year and the same amount under
the estimates submitted by the commis
sioner of pensions. .

to President Cleveland.
Louisville, Dec. 7. The Anzelger, a
German dally, contained a page inter
view with Henry Watterson this morn-,
ing, in which the Courier-Journal's ed
itor again hauled President Cleveland
over, the coals. After expressing the
opinion that an ex-president ought al
ways in his actions to have respect for
the great distinction conferred upon
him, Mr. Watterson said:
"It was, for example, scandalous in
my opinion that Grover Cleveland, as
ex-president, practiced law in the su
preme court of the United States, two
of the Judges of which had been ap
pointed by him. The American people
pay their president so liberally that it
should not be necessary for him, after
his return to private life, to exert him
self to earn money."
Continuing, Mr. Watterson said that
he was under obligations to Cleveland
for opposing his nomination at Indi
anapolis. He had never expected to
accept the nomination, so that Cleve
land had done him a real kindness by
his opposition. When asked whether
he had read that in certain circles there
was talk of the nomination of Cleve
land in 1900, Mr. Watterson said: e ,
"I have not read that, but I d6 not
need the assistance of newspapers to
know that- Grover Cleveland will be a
presidential candidate as long as he
lives. The presidency suits the man
exactly, and if he lives to be a hun
dred years old he will never cease to
be a candldlate." ,
THE BIG HAMBURG STRIKE.
Employers and Employes Are Apparently
as Far Apart as Ever.
Hamburg, Dec. 7. Numerous meet
ings of the striking dock laborers were
held In this city to-day. The largest
of these was a mass meeting at which
Herr Molkenbuhr, socialist member of
the reichstag for Hamburg, announced
that the subscriptions to the fund for
the support of the strikers had so- in
creased that the distributors of the
fund would be enabled to raise the
weekly grants . to unmarried men by
one mark a week and to give to mar
ried men an additional allowance ac
cording to ,the number of children In
their families.
The employers have, held another
meeting, at which their refusal to sub
mit the dispute between the striking
dockmen and themselves to an arbitra
tion tribunal was reaffirmed. This ac
tion Is due to the faot that a guarantee
fund amounting to $250,000 has been
signed for the protection and aid of
the smaller employers.

terwards proposed Tausch as deserving
of a decoration. Witness said that he
had received a letter from Tausch

had destroyed. Count Eulenberg said
he had never been connected with any
Intrigues against Freiherr Marschal

trigues against him.

fession of Baron Luetzow, in which he

ed that a decision had been arrived at
in respect to all the prisoners. All but
one of them were found guilty. Von
Leutzow and Lefket were sentenced to

brous Tumor the Cause
New York, Dec. 7. District Attorney
J. F. Fellows, who had been seriously
ill from a fibrous tumor of the stomach
since Tuesday last, died at his resi
dence here at five minutes past one
o'clock this afternoon. Colonel Fel
lows was anxious to see his son and
aided by a strong constitution made a
brave struggle for life. After he was
compelled to take to his bed on Wed
nesday last Colonel Fellows took no
nourishment whatever except such 'as
was administered by Injection.
He himself did not realize the seri
ous nature of his illness until yester
day. Even then he held the idea that
it was pneumonia he was suffering
from, and when Mrs. Fellows told him
that his illness was of a much more
serious nature he replied that, if it was
pneumonia, he would get well. He
asked frequently yesterday whether
"Jack," his son, had get home and in
his delirium called his name. From
midnight last night until four o'clock

FOR A $500,000 BOND ISSUE
BOARD OF EDUCATION DECIDED
THAT IX WAS XECESSAMX.
The District Meeting Will be Asked to
Authorize the Board to Apply to the
Legislature for Power to Make the Issue
A One Mill Tax to be Levied for Tea
Fears for School Expenses.
A special meeting of the board of
education was held last evening for the
purpose of preparing a call for a dis
trict meeting to be held December 15,
Messrs. Asher, Moran, Hooker, Stod-
ard, Betts.Manson, Farnsworth, O'Con-
ner and Superintendent Kendall being
present. The chief business done at
the meeting was to discuss financial
matters, and ' to decide upon what in
this line should be incorporated In the
call for the district meeting.
It was voted that the district meet
ing be requested to authorize the board
of education to apply to the legislature
for permission to issue $500,000 worth
of bonds for the purpose of paying ex
isting indebtedness, for the completion
of buildings now in process of erection,
and to erect,, equip and furnish a new
High school. It was also voted to re
quest the district meeting to authorize
the board of education to sell these
bonds, fist, to pay the floating indebted
ness of July 14, 1896, and second, to
pay the debts contracted for Board-
man, Strong and Sherman schools.
It was voted to recommend the dis-
trict meeting to annually lay a ona
mill tax, the proceeds to be set aside in
a building fund, for the purpose of pur
chasing sites, for the erection, furnish
ing and equipment of new buildings;'
remodelling buildings, and building ad
ditions to present buildings and furn
ishing and equipping the same as may
be voted by the district.
It was then decided to recommend to
the district meeting that a tax of one
mill be laid on the grand list of 1896,
payable September 1, 1897, to be used
for the purposes named in the precede
ing recommendation. -
The idea back of these recommenda
tions is to go In debt for no more new
school buildings, but to pay for them
and the expenses Incident to repairing''
and adding to the old buildings as soon
as such expenses are incurred.
The financial committee gave out the
following financial statement, which
gives not only the present ldebtedness 1
of the district, but also estimates of
the needs for the next ten yars. The'
statement is revised to December 7,
1896, and Is as follows:
Bonded Debt, . $500,000
Floatlne debt. July 14. 1896. 206.000 ;
Already contracted for
zunaer, uaiances or contracts
and extras, . - 10,500

tion), . 6,000

NEEDS OF NEXT TEN YEARS.

New water closets, West street, ' 2,5000

New water closets, Oak street, 2,500
Finishing top floor Strong school
ana rurmsmng . . . .. d.ihiu
Eflulnment Boardman. 5.000
To reduce number of" children to ,
42 In a room will require 12 rooms
additional, which can be obtained
by additions to present buildings
at a Drobable cost of ' 45.000;
For addition to Woodward, or new
minding. so.uuu
For addition to Lloyd street, or
new buildine. 35.000
The average annual increase In the
enumeration or scnooi emidren i
for the last ten years has been
393.6; , about two-thirds of this
number are enrolled In the public
schools 262.4.
If the rate of increase for the next -
ten years the same as for the last
ten years we will have to provide
seats for 2,624 pupils in the next
ten vears.
The rate of Increase probably will
oe greater ana it is unaotiDteoiy
a conservative estimate to place
the probable demand at 8,000.
This will require six school houses
or vz rooms eacn. oxiz equals n.
72x42 equals 3.024. - " .
Wheu a new high school Is built,
the present high school can be used
for a grammar school, so that pro
bably only Ave new buildings will
be needed.
These buildings with necessary
land will probably cost $75,000 1
each and will probably located as
follows:
Winchester District, , $75,009
Lovell District. ' 75.000
Day District, 75,000 .
woolsey-strong, - ai.uou
Cedar Street school, 75,000
Reseating and changing old High
school for Grammar school, 5,000
Total of 10 years' need, $590,000
It is hoped hy the board that the
Sherman school can be completed for
$63,000. Ail the sums mentioned in the
first paragraph of this statement as al-.
ready covered by contracts will be ex
pended by next summer. The sum for
the remodelling of Eaton school has
been already voted, but not yet col
lected. The remodelling of Baton
school will also be done next summer,:
so that the total amount to be expend
ed during the next two years for re
pairing, remodelling and building will
be something over $100,000, which will
all be used the first of these two years.
The one mill tax which is to be laid
to meet such expenses will not be suf
ficient to pay this amount the first
year and therefore the amount neces
sary in addition to the proceeds of the
one mill tax for the first year to pay
the $100,000, will be borrowed on the
one mill tax of the second year.
' It will be seen by the above state
ment that the total estimated needs of
the next ten years will be $500,000, and
it Is thought that the one mill tax for
the ten years will produce revenue
enough to pay this sum.
Mr.. Stoddard suggested that the pre
mium on the proposed $500,000 bond is
sue be used as a sinking fund and es
timated that this premium would be
nearly, if not quite $30,000. The sug
festion was favorably discussed by the
gentlemen of the board.
