Can they not Induce It to give him Its sup

they shall fail to do so, they certainly can
not expect much commendation from the

Honest and Sincere in Their Loyalty.
'
.The recent tour ot observation by Gen.
Grant through the South, has convinced
him (so he has told the President) that the
gontn almost unanimously desire a speedy
readmlssion to their old position sin the
Union, and that their professions of future
loyalty and, good behavior are hdnelana
sincere. This, be It remembered, is not the
language of a politician, or of a man speci
ally In the interest of the South. It is the
testimony pf a man who ha done consider
able in holding' the South In the Union
against their will; and 'It follows, necessa
rily, that he did. 'not travel , through the
South, predetermined, to manufacture an
untrustworthy sentiment In favor of the
SoOthem? people; "His' testimony, viewed
in Uila light, is entitled to be received fa
vorably. And inasmuch as it is reliable,
whretn Is to be found the Justification for
Congress to nullify the Constitution of the
United ,$tate iu denying to the Southern;
Representatives their seats In Congress? . r
Republicans in Congress Refuse
to Indorse the President's Reorganization
Policy.
Qu Tuesday, Mr. EtwtiDOK, of Wiscon
sin, offered a resolution in the lower House
of CoBgress indorsing the President's poli
cy of reorganization. The ' House refused
to' second the - demand for" the' previous
question on Its passagef-the vote standing;
yea 23, hays 108.; Thus, not only in acts,

The Way the President is Being
Backed Up by the Republicans.
,It Is known to the "country, that when
President Johnson on Monday asked Hon
Hxnkt J Raymond to take and present to
the House the credentials of the Tennessee
members, he ' thereby manifested an
anxiety, that those members should be
'unimdUv admitted to their keato. 'The
quickest way and the proper way, to dls-
pose of the question was at once to swear
the Tennessee members In, as Messrs
" Firfc; GniDMTand "Smith "argued honld
bo done. This was refused by the Re
publican members." The next proper
eoerse to pursue was te- refer their cre
dentials to the Committee on Elections, to
which Mr. Raymond expressed a wish they
should be ruforred. t'Ia this he undoubted
ly gave utterance to the wlshes of tlie Pres
ident, but this wish the Hepubllcan mem
bers refused to gratify: so they sent them
toTHABs SmvtNs' revolutloftry .and:un
eonstitutional committee of fifteen. Not
a Recnbllcah ' member Irom ' Ohio had
the courtesy or the manhood to' second or
advocate the cause of the President, as it
Wu presented in the form of the creden
ti'als. of 'the Tennessee members'.. ' Not one
The member from this District Mr. Sukl
tABAOER t refused such support. . (We

Gkant, and all other reliable 'testimony Is
to the effect that the; Southern people are
honest aud sincere In their .desire to abide
dutifully in the Union. The President has
accepted such evidence; he believes them;
he believes the Southern States In the Un
ion; he professes to believe in the Consti

issue. If the people want more strife, more

Condition unhappy, all they have got to do
is to follow the lead ot Stevens, Sumkeii,

What Southern Men of Influence
Desire.
General Grant Is reported to have told
the President on Tuesday, when he was
recounting to the President the result of
)iis observations in Virginia, North Caroli
na, South Carolina and Georgia, , that the
Southern men of Influence were outspoken
in favorof complylngwith any demands the
'J'rttUtent might consider necessary for their
Restoration and that he, : General G bist)
believes the people of the South almost
Unanimously desire a speedy readmlsslon
to their old position in the Union, and thai
their professions of future loyalty and good
behavior are honest and sincere. The state
ment that Southern men of influence were
willing to comply wfth any demand the
President might consider necessary for
their restoration, Is significant. They know
jtbe composition Of this. Congress, they
know It Is likely to be dominated' over and
controlled by men who would, degrade, nu
Imillate and fronton them to the utmost ex
tremity; and nchce tber do not proclaim a
willingness to comply with any. demands
Congra$ might consul necessary for their
irestoration. They put their trust in the
President In his humanity,' justice and lite
lingering attachment to the Constitution
and hope that his exactions will not be re
pulsive. : Shall they be disappointed? '
