Constitution of the United States, and the
Union under it, wliy also to the laws and to
proclamations in regard to slavery. These
laws and proclamations were enacted and put
forth for the purpose of aiding the suppres
sion of tho repelUou. To give their fullest
effect, there had to be a pledge for their main
tenance. In my judgment they have aided, i
and will further aid the cause for which they
were enlisted. To give up this principle,
would not only be to relinquish a lever of
power, but would also be a cruel and asto'uu-'
ding breach of faith.
I may add at this point that while I remain
in my present position I shall not attempt to
retract or modify the Emancipation Procla
mation; nor shall I return to slavery any
lierson who is free by the terms of the proc
nmation, or by any act of Congress. For
these and other reasons, it is thought best,
that the support of these persons shall be in- j
eluded in the oath, and it is believed that the
Executive may lawfully claim it in return for
pardon and restoration of forfeited rights,
which he has clear const itufional power to
withhold altogether, or grant upon terms
which he shall deem wisest for the public
interest. It should bo observed, also, that
this part of the oath is subject to the modify
ing and abrogating power of legislation and
supreme judicial decision.
The proposed acquiescence of the National
Executive in any honorable temporary State
arrangements for the freed people, is made
with the view of possibly modifying tho con
fusion and destitution wlpch must at least
attend all classes by a total revolution of
labor throughout the whole of the States. It
is hoped that the already deeply afflicted
people in these States may be somewhat more
readv to give up the cause of their affliction,
and "to this extent this vital matter is left to
themselves, while no power of the National
Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by
the proposition.
The suggestion in the Proclamation as to
maintaining the political frameworks of the
States, on what is called n construction, is
made in the hope that ft may do go6d with
out tho danger of harm. It will save labor
and avoid great confusion. But why any
Proclamation now upon this subject t This
question is beset with the conflicting views
that the step might be delayed too long or
bo taken too soon, in some elements, for re
sumption, they seem ready for action, but
remain inactive, apparently for 'want of a
Vallying point, and n pi in o'f action. Why
shall I adopt the plan of It rather than that
of A and A and B ? Should they agree, how
can they know but the General Government
here will respect their plan ?
By the Proclamation a plan is presented
which may be acceptxl by theirt as a rallying
point, and which, th6y are assured in advance,
\vill not bo rejected here. This may bring
them to act sooner than they otherwise would.
Th« objection to a premature presentation of
a plan by the National Executive, consists in
the danger of commitments in points which
could be more safely left to further develop
taents. Care has been taken so to shape the
document, to avoid embarrassment from this
source. ~
In saving that on certain terms certain
classes will be pardoned, with their rights re
stored, it id not said that other classes on
other terms will ever be included. In saying
n reconstruction will be accepted if presen
ted in a specified way, it is not said it will
never be accepted in any other way. The
movements on the parts of States for emanci
pation that several have made were not in
cluded in the Emancipation Proclamation,
and are matters of profound gratification;
and while I do not repeat in detail what I
Tiavc hcrc'ofore so earnestly urged upon this
'snbjcc', my general views and feeling remain
Unchanged, I trust that Congress will
omit no fair opportunity of aiding these im
portant steps t > the great consummation.
In the midst of other cares, hirwever im
portant, we must not lose sight of the fact
that the war power is still our main reliance.
To that power alone can we yet look for a
time to give confidence to the people in the
contested regions that the insurgent, power
will not again overrun them. Until that con
fidence shall be established, little can be
done for what is called reconstruction ; hence
dur chief caro must be directed td our army
and Our uavy, who have thus born their hard
er part in nobly ahd well; and it may be
esteemed fortunate that in giving the greatest
efficiency to their indispensable arms, we
also encourage the gallant men—from com
mander to sentinel—who compose them, and
to whoiri, more than to all others, the world
stands indebted for the riifwitlialled, regen
erated, enlarged and perpetuated home of
freedom.

The President's Proclamation.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8,1863.
Whereas, in and by the Constitution of
the United States it is provided that the
President shall have power to grdnt reprieves
and pardons for all offenses against the Uni
ted States, except in cases of impeachment;
and whereas, a rebellion now exists whefeby
the loyal States and the Government of the
several States have, for a long time been
subverted, and many persons have been com
mitting and are now guilty of treason against
the United States; and whereas, with refer
ence to said rebellion and treason, laws have
been enacted by Congress calling for the for
feiture and confiscation of property and the
liberation of slaves, all upon terms and con
ditions therein stated, and also declaring that
the President was thereby authorized at any
time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend
to persons who may have participated in the
existing rebellion in any State or part thereof,
pardon, or amnesty, with such exceptions
and on such terms and on such conditions as
he may deem expedient for the public wel
fare ; and whereas, the Congressional declar
ation for- limited and unconditional pardon
accords with well established judicial exposi
tion of the pardoning power ; and whereas,
with reference to said rebellion the l'residunt
of the United States has issued several proc
lamations with provisions in regard to the
liberation of slaves j aud whereas, it is now
desired by some persons heretofore engaged
in said rebellion to resume their allegiance
to the United States and re-inaugurate loyal
State Governments within aud for their res
pective Btates
Therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President
of the United States, do proclaim, declare
and mike known to all persons who have
directly or by implication participated in the
existing rebellion, except as hereinafter ex
cepted, that a full pardon is granted to them
and each of them, with restoration of all
rights, if third parties shall have intervened,
and upon the condition that they—such per
sons—shall take and subscribe an oath, aAd
thenceforward keep and maintain said oath
inviolate, and which oath shall be registered
for permanent preservation, and shall be of
the tenor and effect following, to wit:
" I do solemnly swear, in presence of Al
mighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully
support, protect and defend the Constitution
of the United States and the Union of States
thereunder* and that I will in like manner
abide by and f iithf illy support all Acts of
Congress passed during the existing rebellion
with reference to slaves so long and so far
as not modified or repealed, or held void by
C'ongrdfcs or by a decision of the Supreme
Court, and that I will in like manner abide
by and faithfully support all proclamations of
the President made during the existing re
bellion having reference to slaves, so long and
so far as not modified or declared void by a
decision of the Supreme Court; so help me
God!"
The persons excepted from the benefits of
the foregoing provisions are all who arc, or
shall have been, civil or diplomatic officers or
agents of the so-called Confederate Govern
ment; all who have left judicial stations un
der the United States to aid the rebellion;
all who arc, or shall have been, military or
naval officers of or above the rank of Colon
el in the army, or Lieutenant in the navy ;
all who left .yats in the United States Con
gress to aid in the rebellion ; all who resigned
their commissions in the army and navy of
the United States and afterwards aided the
rebellion ; ami all who ha»'c engaged in any
way in treating colored persons, or white
persons in charge of such, otherwise than
lawfully as prisoners of war. and which per
sons may be found in the United States ser
vice as soldiers, seamen, or in any other ca
pacity.
And I do further proclaim, declare, and
make known, that whenever in any of the
States of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mis
sissiji;>i, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Flor
ida, South Carolina and North Carolina, a
number of persons, not less than one tenth
ot the number of the votes east in such
S:ate at the Presidential election of the year
of our I.ord 18I>((—each having taken the
Oath aforesaid and not having since violated
if, being a qualified voter by the election
laws iif the State, existing immediately be
fore the so-called act of Secession, and ex
cluding all otlii-rs—shall be established a
State Government, which shall be republi
can, and in nowise contravening said oath,
such shall b.« recognized as the true govern
ment of the State, and the State shall receive
(hereunder the benefits of the constitutional
provision which declares that the United
States shall guarantee to every State in the
Union a republican form of Government, and
shall protect each of them from invasion, on
application of the Legislature, or the Exec
utive when the Legislature cannot be con
vened against domestic violence. Second—l
do further proclaim, declare and make known,
that any provision which may be adopted by
such State Government in relation to the
freed people of such State which has or
which shall recognize and declare their per
manent freedom, and provide for their edu
cation, and which may yet be consistent as a
temporary arrangement with their present
condition as a laboring, landless, and home
less class, will not be objected to by the Na
tional Executive ; and it is suggested as not
improper, that in constructing a loyal State
Government ill any State, the name of the
boundary, the sub-division, the Constitution
and the Federal code of laws, as before the
rebellion, be maintained subject only to mod
ifications made necessary by the conditions
hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any,
not contravening such condition, which may
be deemed expedient by those framing the
new State Governments.
To avoid misunderstanding it may bo
proper to say that this proclamation, so far as
it rcllitcs to State Governments, has no ref
erence to States in which loyal State Govern
ments have all tliH whilo been maintained.
For the same reason it may be proper to fur
ther B&V, that whether members sent to Con
gress from any Statu shall be admitted to
seals conventionally, rests exclusively with
the respective houses, aud not to any extent
with the Executive. And still further, that
this proclamation is intended to present to
the people of the Sta'cs, wherein the Na
tional authority has been subverted, a mode
by which the National authority over every
loyal State Government may be established
within said States, or any of them. And
while the mode presented is the best the Ex
ecutive can suggest, with his present impres
sions it must not be understood that another
possible mode would not be accepted.

Washington, the Bth of December, A, D.,

DATES I'O DECEMBER 16.
Mr. Washburnc offered it resolution present
ing the tlruiks of Congress to Mnjor-General
Grant and the officers and soldiers who fought
under him during'the rebellion, and providing
that the President shall cause a modal to be
struck for Gen. Grant in the name of the
people of the -United States. It passed
unanimously, without one word of debate or
oxplaiiatidn.
Mr. Arnold gave notice of a bill to pro
hibit slavery forever ill the territory included
in the President's emancipation proclamation,
and to repeal as much of the enrolment act
as authorizes the discharge of persona drafted
on the the payment of 0300.
New York, Dec. B.—The Richmond Whig
of the 3d, calls for a reconstruction of the
rebel cabinet, and Bays :
" We have a Department df State that has
not been able, for nearly three years, to es
tablish any relations with any other cdnntiy;
a Treasury Department that has failed to
keep its finances from ruin; a War Depart
ment in the hands of a chief whose previous
course of life has been purely and peculiarly
civil; a Navy Department without a navy ;
a Post-Office Department with a very shock
ing system of mailt."
Tho Whig adds:
"We ara getting into deep waters, and a
feeling of dread is slinking the souls of tho
people. There is nothing that the President
can do that will so reanimate their hearts as
calling to his Cabinet the wisest and most ex
perienced men in the country. The time is
pmditious; the occasion urgent; the people
anxiously expectant; and for his own contin
uing capacity for usefulness aud future fame,
as well as on account of the sorely necessi
tous condition of the country, we earnestly
press this recommendation."
New York, Dec. 12. —Tho Timet' tele
gram says:
The Army of the Potomac will b<s re-or
ganized and made larger and better every
way. The chief command will probably be
teudered to Hooker or Thomas, the former
being considered the next best commander
of the Potomac. The present corps com
manders, with one exception, are to be re

By the arrival of the steamer Fulton, from

A furious gale prevailed at the time. Hie

Cincinnati, Dec. 16.—Advices from Knox

The main body of 'Longst root's army-was
at llogersville. During the retreat, he lost
3,000 men in prisoners and deserters. There
were swarms of fugitives from' his ranks, and
his army was worn out by hard service and
were dispirited. Longstreet abandoned his
siege train of six guns, after burning the gun
carriages. They fell into our hands. The
people around Knoxville are destitute, the
rebel army having consumed everything eata
ble. Longstrect'a ariny is represented to be
almost entirely demoralized.
Chicago, Dec. 16.—8y way of Memphis
we learn of another victory gained over the
rebels in Texas. Official information has
been received at Headquarters of the Depart
ment of the Gulf, that all the rebel forces at
Port Cavnllo, were captured by the Union
troops under (Jen. Washburnc. It is not
known What the number of the enemy was,
but accounts previous to capture placed tho
number of the garrison at 1,000 men under
Col. Brndfatc, of Texas. A refugee states
that two months since, there were sevon
heavy guns and five field pieces at that point.
The possession of this place clears tho en
trance to Matagorda Hay, aud givis the Un
ion army command of several important
places.
)Vu.ihinglon, Dir. 16.—The Government

A Terrible Calamity—Port Angelos washed
Away.
Mr. Hrndtsliaw lias shown us n loiter from
•Jnred 8. lirown, Esq., Deputy U. S. Mar
shal, written front Port Townsend, 23d inst.,
nunouiicing tlm total destruction of the town
of l'ort Angelos, by n torrent of water which
burst upon it suddenly front A ravine in the
rear of tbto town. The calamity occurred on
Wednesday evening about G o'clock. A full
account is found in the Victoria Chronicle
from which we condense particulars: The
first intimation which the inhabitants had of
the danger was a rushing, roaring sound pro
ceeding from the gorge, and on turning their
eyes thitherward, they saw a great body of
water several feet in height, bearing upon its
surface or sweeping before it logs, trees and
stumps rushing down upon them. Before
they could even realize their danger the flood
was upon and over the greater part of the
town. The Custom-house, a large, two-story
structure, stood exactly in the path of the vaxt
torrent, and was overturned and swept away
in a moment. Of the three occupants in the
Custom-house at the time, Dr. Gunn, the Col
lector, tVns the only ouo who escaped. His
deputy, Mr. J. W. Anderson, and Captain
Ooodell, an inspector, were overwhelmed with
the building and lost their lives. Their bod
ies, mutilated and swollen, were recovered
from the ruina lifter the rtatcrs had subsided.
The flood next carried away the dwelling of
Victor Smith, (ex-collector,) his family nar
rowly escaping with their lives; and swept
clear into the harbor the dwelling of Mr. E.
Stanton, Ivliose family were with difficulty
rescued by boats. The front portion of tlte
Hough and lleady Saloon, a portion of the
wharf, and several thousand fret of logs were
also swept into the sea. The fragmcuts of
houses, and hundreds of trees and stumps lie
scattered abjut in every direction, and iu
some places they are piled one upon another
to the height of 30 feet. The accident ia
supposed to have been caused by the late
rains nlelting the ice and snow in the moun
tains, and causing avalanches into the lakes
at the foot hilla. These lake* were then
overflowed, and rtishiug dotrn the gorge, car
ried everything before them.

liter# attack of Toothaeh* and Pain m my /me*,
(sometimes called ague in the face.) My whole
face was very much swollen and distorted, and
the right side was very larfce. The pain was so
intense that I could not eat or sleep, aad at times
it seemed as if I must go distracted'. Every tooth
in my bead seemed to ache at 'tie sa'&'e time, so
that I coald not tell which gave me the post pain.
I kept a mustard plaster applied to my bee until
it nearly blistered. This gave mc momentary re
lief, but on taking cold would return With more
violence than ever. Just at tilts cns\s 'we found
one of your circulars, which had been tUfown in
our yard. Seeing the Panacea recommended, I
procured a bottle, and commenced using it, by
flVat buttling my feet freely, and also washing my
teeth an gums. Afterward I applied a poultice
with the surface moistened with Panacea, which
I changed twice a day, THRU goon gave me relief,
aud in a few days entirely cured me. I have had
similar attacks since, but the PANACEA Jpas,al
ways given Immediate relief. I have also used it
for Summer Complaints and Paias in the Bowels,
and always found it a speedy and certain semedy.
Accept with this my gratitude for the blessing

POISON, AND IB BAM FOB THE MOST
DELICATE CHILD !
Rome, Oneida eo., N. Y. May 23, 1860.
TI.e Balsam has produced recently one of
the most remarkable cures we have ever yet wit
nessed iu this section. It is that of a young lady
who has been suffering from lung complaint for
the last rear or two, and has been under tho treat
ment of some of the best physicians in New York
city, and by them pronounced incurable. Uy their
advice recently she came up into the country
among her relatives, where she could be properly
nursed, not expecting to live bqt a few weeks or
months at the" most, suffering as she was from con
stant cough, nightsweats, and all the unpleasant
systems attending confirmed consumption! .One
of her friends noticing your advertisement, pro
cured of us a bottle of the Ualsam, with expecta
tion only of giving a little temporary relief, and
without any hope of its affecting a permanent
cure. After using half of the bottle she found
the effect exactly as described in your pamphlet,
her cough began to disappear. She commenced
gaining in flesh; and by the time had com
pleted the second bottle, she pronounced herself
nearly Kelt. She was recently in our, store for
the purpose of procuring a bottle of tkic Balsam
to send to a friend of hers, and appeared to be
enjoying good health I She is extremely gratefiilj
and says that she is anxious that the wbqlo world
should know of the curative properties of
JlaUam," as she considers that it tins been instru
mental In saving her life 1

Almost Death from Suffocation.
Mrttrt, A. L. Seovill $ Co., — Genii: —For the
bouefit of the public, and especially those who
are suffering with diseased lungs, or are subject
to coughs and colds, I wish to add my testimony
to that of many others, touching the efficacy of
Da. HALL'S BALSAM. Last winter I was attacked
with a rough, which was very shortly afterward
followed by pains in my breast aad sides, and
shortness of breath. I resorted to various reme
dies, and to what I deemed the best medical ad
vice; but notwithstanding all that, ! continued
daily to declino, till I was pronounced past all re
covery. Death frto lt tujjhcattim tttHed very nee'r to
me, and it Was with the utntdst difficulty that I
could breathe'. Just in this stage of my disease,
my husband heard of Da. HALL'S BALSAM and its
great efficacy, aad procured a bottle at once. I
commenced its use immediately, and icithim ttcen
tjf-four hour* therefrom I expectorated large masses
of phlegm and matter, which gave me .great re
lief. 1 continued the use of It as directed; and am
now attlfc to lay that I Mm entirely restored tb {
health'. • -J
For farllier reference call on me at my resi
dence, on Betts-street, south side, two doors east
