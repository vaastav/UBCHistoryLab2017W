Death of Horace Greeley.
New York, Nov. 29. Horace Gree
ley died- conscious and peaeefullv at
t:"iO r. u.
The Ti-iltmc furnishes the follow
ing account of the illness and last
hour? of Mr. Greeley :
io far as any of his associates are
aware, Mr. Greeley was in almost as
good health as usual when, on the day
after the election, he wrote the card
announcing bis resumption of the
editorial charge of the Tribune, His
sleeplessness was known to have be
come greatly worse, but for years h
bad suffered more or less from the
same difficulty, and, as is now clear,
sufficient allowance bad not bran
made for the intense strain upon him
throughout tne rammer, especially
daring the last months of his wife's
illness; but it soon became evident
that bis strength was unequal to the
hard task to which he "set himself.
He wrote only three or four careful
articles, nooneo them half a column
in length. The moat notable, perhaps,
' was that entitled "Conclusions," in
which be summed np his viewsof the
canvass. In all, he wrote less than
three aud a half columns after bis re
turn, contributing to only four issues
of the' paper. Two or three times he
handed his assistant "short articles,
saying, "There is an idea worth using,
but J have not felt able to work It out
properlyj yoa had better put it iu
- shape." At last, on Tuesday, the 12th
lest., be abandoned the effort to viBit
the office regularly, and sent for the
family physician or Air. A. J. John
eon, the friend with whom he was a
guest, and in whose house his wife
had died. Evary effort was made
to induce sleep, but be grew steadily
worse until it became evident that his
ease was critical. Dr. George C. S.
Chunte and others were called in con
saltation, aud finally it was decided
to take him to Dr. Cboate's resident1.
two or three miles distant from Mr.
draeley'sowD country house at Chap
pit qua. Here he received the unin
termittiug- attentions of Dr. Choate,
and here Dr. Krown and others were
" called in connuk-ation.- Theim-'bninia
bad developed into inflammation oi
the brain, and nnder this the venerat
ed patient rapidly sank. At times he
was delirious, at usher times lie was
clear headed as ever. He lost flesh
and strength with startling rapidity,
and in a few days the possibility of
his speedy death forced itself into un
willing recognition.- It was not, how
ever, until Thursday that his asso
ciates and family brought themselves
to admit it, and ven then they still
clung to his faith fn the vigor of his
constitution. On Wednesday night
be failed very rapidly, but oii Thurs
day afternoon and eveniug he i-eemed
somewhat easier. sss9fl ring the night
besiept vary unea!y;-nnUtering occa
sionally, and frequently raising liis
rifcht hand. Toward moruing lie was
' more quiet, and between eight and
utoe,o'clock fell iuto a nearly uncon
scions condition which continued
-with some intervals through the day.
He made occasional exclamations, but
many of them, In consequence of his
extreme weakness and apparent ina
bility to finish what he began, were
unintelligible. About noon, howev
er, he said quite distinctly and with
some force, "I know that my lie
deemer livetb." During the day lie
recognized various people, his daugh
ter nauy times, the members- of his
homestead at Chsppaqun,' Mr. John
It. Htuart and Mr. Keid. On the
. whole he suffered tittle, and teemed
to have no mora than the ordinary
- restlessness which accompanies the
- last stage of disease. During the day
- bis extremities were cold, and- there
- was no pulse at the wrist: the action
of the heart was very intermittent,
and constantly diminishing in force.
He bad not asked for water or been
willing to drink it since iis stay at!
Dr. Cboate's, but during Friday he
asked for it frequently, and up to
within half an hour 'of the end he
manifested in various ways his con
sciousness of what was going on
. around him, and cren answered in
' monosyllables and intelligent!? ues
tion addressed to hint. About half
past thieehesaid vary distinctly, " It
is done,'' and beyond the briefest an
swers to questions this was his. last
otte ranee. Hie youngest daughter,
Miss Cabrialle, was with him through
Thursoay evening. Throughout Fri
day the elder daughter, Miss Ida, was
in constant attendance, as she had
been ehiruMt the whole of his illness,
and Mrs.GreeUy' before him. Other
awn aeia of his Cnappaqua household
were present, with Mr. and Mrs. John
K. Stuart and a - few other friends.
Nothing that science or affection could
suggest was wanting to ease the last
hours. The wintry wind had fairly
set in when the inevitable hour came.
Without, sleighs were running to aud
fro hearing to Cbappaqua, the nearest
telegraph station, the latest bullelios
which the thousands of an xious hearts
.in the r reateity near by kept demanding.-
Within, the daughter and a few
others stood near the dying wan, who
restrained -onscioos aud seemingly
rational and fre from aiii, though
bow too weak to spratt. in the ad
joining room eat one or two more
friends and tlx physician. At en
minutes before senui ti e watcher
drew back in snvcreiit stiitasss from
the bedside. The great editor wia
gone in peace after so many struggles
in bonor, after so naucn ootoquy.
The Tribune issues the following
bulletin :
" Nov. 29, 9 p. m, Mr. Greeley died
very quietly aud without paiu at ten
sninates before seven this evening.
He wa conscious and rational."
Horace Greeley's life was insured
for Moe hundred thousand dollars for
the benefit of the Tribune Aocia
tioo. It is announced that Cbappa
jua, the home of Mr. Greeley, is
be abandoned by the family, and that
the propertv will be auctioned to
morrow. The feeling in this city in all quar
ters is one of profound sorrow at the
death of Mr. Greelev, wtilfii is uni-
wersany reijsrueu in vue itgut-vj ana
Clonal calamity.

THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.
In transm'tlintr to you my fourth
annual message it is with thankful
ness to tho Gircr ol all good that as
a ration va have been blessed for
the la.l year with ieaco at homo

vouchsafed to but lew peoplo, with
the exception of the recent dcva6la
ting firo which swept Iron, tho earth
with a breath as it wero millions ol
accumulated wealth iu the city ol
Boston. Thero have boon two over
shadowing calamities within tbe year
to record. It is gratifying to note
here, like llieir lellow citizens of the
city of Chicago, under similar cir
cumstances a year earlier, the citi
zens of Boston are rallying under
their misfortunes, and tbu prospect is
that Ibeir energy and perseverance
wiil overcome all obstacles sinil show
tho same prosperity soon that they
would have shown had disaster
befallen it em. Otherwise, we have
been Irce Imm' pestilence, war and

run penetrate tho future, no cause
soems to exist to threaten our pre
ent peace.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS ARBITRATION.
i ,n wrmnv
' "
When Congress adjourned in Juno
last, a question had been raised by
Great Britain, and was then pending,
which tor a tine seriously imperilled
the settlement by friendly arbitration
of the" differences existing between
this government and that of Her
Britianic Majesty by tho Treaty of
Washington,' bad been referred to
tbo Tribunal of Arbitration which
had met at Geneva, in Switzerland-
The arbitrators, however, disposed of
tho question which had jeopardised
tne wbolo ot the treaty and threat
ened to involve tho two nations in
most unhappy relations toward each
ctber, in a manner entirely satisfac
ly to this government and in accord
ance with tho views and tho policy
which it had maintained The tri
bunal, which hnd convened in Gcno-
va in December, concluded its labor
ious session on tho I4tu day of Sep
tember last, on which day, having
availed itself of the discretionary
power given to it by the treaty to
award a turn in gross It made its
decision, whereby it awarded the
sum of fl5.o00.000 in gold s the in
demnity to be paid by Gr. at Britain
to the United States, lor the rannca
tion of all the claims referred to its
consideration- This decision happily
disposes of a long standing di Here nee
between the two governments, and
in connection with another award
made by the German Emperor nnder
a reference to him by the same treaty,
leave these two governments with
out shadow upon tho friondly rela
tions which it is' my sincere hope
mav forever tctnain equally uncloud
ed' Tho report of the agent of tho Unt
ied Slates appointed to attend tho
Geneva tribunal, accompanied by the
protocols of tho proceedings of the
arbitrators, the arguments of tho
counsel of both governments, tbe
award of the tribunal, and the opin
ions given by the several arbitrators,
is transmitted herewith. I have
caused to be communicated to the
h 'ads of tho three friendly powers
wbo complied with the joint request
mad? to them under the treaty, tbo
thanks of this government for iheap
poinimcnt of arbitrators made by
them respeclivclyvand also my thanks
to" "lh eminent persons named by
thorn, and my appreciation of tho dig
nity, patience, impartiality and great
ability with . winch they discharged
their orders and liih functions. Her
Majesty' gorerfiincnl has communi
cated to mc its nppr-iati6n bv- her
Majesty of the abiii'y and indefatiga
ble- industry displayed by Mr. Adams,
tbe arbitrator immed on tho part ol
this povcrnmenl during tho protract
ed inquiries nnd discussions of tho tri
bunsi). I cordially unite with her Maj
esty in tbi appreciation. It is duo
to the agent ol tho United Stales be
fore the tribunal to record my high
spnrceiati- n ot the marked ability,
unvearivd patience and the prudence
and discretion with which he haicon
ducted the- very;rcspoiw;ible and deli
cate duties committed to him, as it is
also due to the learnod and eminent
counsel " ho attended the tribunal on
the part of this' government, to ex
press niv sense of the talents and
wisdom which thev brouzbt to bear
in llio argument of rcsull. 60 happily
renched.' it will be tho providence of
Congress to provide for tho dislribu
tion amonr tboso who msj' be cnli
tied to it of their respective shares
of the money to be paid.
-Although the sum awarded is ol
payable until a year from the date ol
the award, it is d.emed advisable, that
no timo bo lost in making a proper
examination of tho soveral cases in
which indemnification may be .due
I consequently rect'mmend tho crea
lion of a board of commissioners for
tho purpose. By tbe 34ih article ol
the treaty ol Washington the respect
ive claims of the United States aud
of Gnat Britain in their construe
tion of the treaty of the loth of June.
1846, defining tlu boundary line be
tween their retpective territories
were submitted to the arbitration and
award of his Majrslf the Emperor ol
Germany to deride which of thosa
claims is most in accordance wi'.h tho
true int rprelalion of tb treaty ol
1846- His Majesty, the Emperor ol
Germany, having been pleased to un
derlake tho arbitration, has the earn
est thanks of tbis government and
ot tbe people of the United Stales for
tbe labor, pains and care which he
has devoted to the consideration of
this long pending difference. 1 have
caused an expression of my thanks
to bo communicated to His Majesty.
Mr. Bancroft, the representative of
ibis government at Berlin, conducted
tbe case and prepared the statement
on tbe part of tho United Stat.s,
with the ability that his past service
justified the public in expecting at
his hands. As a member of the cabi
net at the data of the treaty which
has g:ven rise to tho discussion bo
tween the two governments, as tbo
Minister to Great Britain when the
construction now pronouncod un
founded was first advanced, and as
tho agent ar,d representative of the
government to present tbe case and
t recuivo the award, he has been as
snciatcd with the qties'.ion in all of its
phases, and in every stage has mani
tested a patriotic zeal and earnest
ness in tho mainlenanco of the claim
of the United St alps ; ho is entillod
to much credit for the success which
baa attended tho commission. Aftor
a palicnt investigation of the case
and of tbe statements oi each parly,
his'wajesty tho Emperor, on tho 21st
day ot October last, signed bis award
aecretng M$L claim
of the eovernmeot of tho United
States that the boundary line between
the territories of ber Britannic ' ina
jeaty and the United States should bo
drawn through tho Uaro t-tiarincl, is
most in accordanco with tho true in
terpretation of tho treaty concluded
on tho 15th of June. 1S43. between
tho agents of her Biiltanic tnoj&:.y
and tho United States.
THE SAN JUAN QUESTION.
"-opies of tbe esse presented on bo
half ef each government, and of tho
statement in reply, cf each ' and a
translation of the award are trans
mitted herewith. This award eon
firms the United States in their claim
to the important archipelago of is
lands lying between tho continont
and Vancouver's Island, which lor
twenty six years, ever since the rati
fication ot tho ttcaty, Great Britain
has contested, and leaves lis for tho
first time in the history of tho United
Stales a nation without a question ol
disputed boundary between our ter
ritory and tho possessions of Great
r.ritain on this continent. It is my
gratelnl ' duty to ' acknowledge the
uroiniiL Kniiiilnnenus action of Her
r r- i . .
Majesty's government in giving effect
to the uward: In anticipation ot any
request from this government and
before tho reception in tho United
States of tho award signed by the
Emperor, Her Majesty had givon in
struction for the removal ot tier troops
which had been stationed thoro, and j
for tbo cessation of all exercise or'
claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave
tho United Stales in exclnsivo poses
sion of tbe lately disputed territory.
1 am grateful to be able to annoanco
that the orders for tho removal of the
troops havo been executed, and the
military joint occupation of San Juan
has erased. Tho islands are now in
the exclusive possession ot the United
States. It now becomes necessary to
complete the survey and determina
tion of that portion of tho boundary
line through the Hani channel, on
which tho commission which deter
mined the remaining part of the line
wero unable to agree. I recommend
the appointment of a commission to
act jointly with ono vhich may be
named by hor Majesty for that purpose.
THE ALASKA BOUNDARY.
Experience of tho difficulties at
tending the determination of our ad
mitted line of boundary after the oc
cupation of the territory and its set
tlemcnt by those owing allegiance to
the restrictive governments points to
the importance of establishing by
natural objects or other monuments
the actual lino between the territory
acquired by purcbaso from Russia
and tbo adjoining pnsessions of ber
Britianic majesty. The region is now
so sparsely occupied that no conflict
ing interests of individuals or cf juris
diction are likolv to interfere to the
delay or orabarrassment of the actual
location of the line. If deferred until
population shall enter and occupy the
territory, some trivial contest' of
neighuors may again array the two
governments in antagonism. I there-
lore recommend tho appointment ol
a commission to act jointly with ono
tbat may bo appointed on tho part ot
Great Britain to determine tbo lino
between our territory of Alaska and
the co terminus of possessions of
Great Britain. In my last annual
message I recommended the legisla
tion necessary on tho part of tho Uni
ted States to bring into operation the
articles of tho treat- of Washington
of May, 1871, relating to the fisheries
and to other matters touching the re
lations of the United Stales toward
the -British North America posse
sions, to become operative so soon as
the proper legislation should bo had
on the part ol Grca. Britain and its
possessions. ."
The legislation on the part of Great
Britain and its possessions had uot
then been had, and during a session
of Congress a question' wai raised
which for the ti.ue raised a doubt
whether any action by Congress iu
the direction indicate t w mid become -important.
This qaestion hassiuce
iteen' disposed of, and I have re
ceived notice that the Imperial Par
liament and the legislature of. the
provincial government nave passed
laws to carry the provisions of the
treaty on the matters refeired to into
operation. I therefore recommend
joor early adoption of the legislation
in the same direction necessary oa
the part of this government.--. .
The joint commission for determin
ing the boundary line between the
Unitid States aud the-British pos
sessions, between the Lake of the
Woods and the Rocky Mountains,
has organized and entered upon its
work. It is desirable that the force
le increased, in order that the com
pletion of the survey and determin
ing of the line may be tne sooner at
tained. : To this end I recommend
that a sufficient appropriation be
made:

OUR RELATIONS WITH EUROPE.
1 With Franca, our earliest ally;
Russia, the constant - aud steady
friend of the United Slates; Germa
ny, with whose Government and peo
ple we have so many causes or.
friendship and so many common
sympathies, and tbe other powers of
Kurope, our relations are maintained
on the most friendly terms.; Since
my last annual message, theexchange
has been made of the ratifications
of a trraty with the Austrian and
Hungariau empires relating to nat
uralization ; also of a treaty with tbe
German Empire respecting consuls
and trade maifcs: also of a treaty,
with Sweden aud Norway relating to
naturalization, all of which treaties
have been duty proclaimed.
THE VIENNA EXPOSITION.
Congress, at its last. Session, having
made an appropriation t defray the ex
pent of commissioners on the part of
the United busies to the International .
tSta'.isili-al congress at ait. Petersburg,
the persons appointed in that eharacter
proeee led to their riostination, and at
tended tbe sessions if tbe congress ;
their report shall in due season be laid
before yon. This congress meets at in
lervala of atmut three years, and has held
its sessions in several of the countries of
Europe. I submit to your consideration
tbe propriety of extending a.i invitation
to the Cong reus to hold its next meeting
in the United States. Tbe Centennial
Celebration to be held in 1876 would af
ford an appropriate occasion for auch .
meeting. Preparations are making for.
tbe international exposition to be held
the next year in Vienna, on a scale of
very great magnitude. The tendency of
these expositions is in the direction of
advanced civilization, and of the eleva
tion of industry, of labor, and of the in
crease of human happiness as well, snd
of greater iutercour.w and good will be
tween nations. As this exposition is to
be the first which will have been held in
eastern Earojie, it is believed tbatAmer
i su manufacturers and inventors will
I e ready to avail themselves of the op
portunity for the presentation of their
prod dci ions, if encouraged by pro par aid
and protection. At the last session of
Congress authority was given Kr tbe
appointment of one or more sgmts to
represent this government at tne expo
sition. Tbe authority thus given baa
been exercised, but in tbe absence of
any appropriation there is danger that
the important benenta which tbe occasion
offers will, in s large degree, be lost to
the eitiiens of the United .States. I com
mend the subject strongly to your coo-'
sideration, and recommend tbat an ade
quate appropriation be made for the
purpose.
To further aid the American exhibitors
at the Vieuea exposition, I would recom
mend, in addition to an appropriation of
money, that the secretary of the navy be
authorize-! to fit op two naval vessels to
transport beteeirour Atlantic -i ties sad

THE POLICY WITH MEXICO.
Since your last session the President
of the Mexican republic, distinguished
by his high eharacter and his services to
bis country, has died. 11 is temporary
sue essor has now been elected with a
great unanimity by the people, a proof
of contiddiios uu their part in bis pat
riotism and widnm whieii, it is believ
ed, will be confirmed by tbe results of
his administration. It is particularly
desirable ' that nothing should be left
undone by the government of either
republic to strengthen their relations as
neighbors and friends. It is much to be
regreted that many lawless acts continue
to disturb the quiet of the settlements
on the border between our territory and
tbat of Mexico, aud that complaints of
wrong to American cltizona in various
parts of the country because of tbe rev
olutionary ranci ion in which the neigh
boring republic has i-o long been involv
ed, has in some degree contributed to
tbis disturbance. It is to be hoped that
with a mote seilletl ruleo'order through
the rspublio which may bees p- cted from
tbe present government, the acta, of
which just complaint is made, will cease.
The proceedings or tbe commission
under the convention with Mexico of
the 4th of July, lhtii, on the auhjertor
claims, have unfortunately been check
ed by an ntwtacle for the removal of
wuich measures hsve been taken by the
two governments whii-n, it is believed,
will prove successful. Ttie commission
ers appointed pursuant to tbe joint rr8--lutioim
of Coimress of the 7ih ot May
last toj inquire lnto the depredations on
tne iVxjii frontiers have diligently
made iuvtatlaiions In that quarter.
The report upon thanbtct will Oh com
municated to ou. Their researches
were necessarily incomp ete, partly on
account of the limited appropriate u
made by Congress. Mextoo, on the part
of that " government, has appointed a
similar commission to iuves'gate these
outrages. It is not announced officially.
but the press cT.tiat country siatna mat
the luileot investigation is lired, and
that ttie cooperation ol all parties run -cerned
is invited to secure that end. I
therefore recommend that a Biecial ap
propriation be made at the earliest day
practicable to enable the commissioners
on tbe part of the Uuited States to re
turn to their labor witnout ueisy.
THE DISTRESS OF CUBA—THE OBVIOUS
CAUSE.
It es with regiet that I have agaiu
to announce a continuance of the dis
turbed condition of the Island of
Cuba. No advance toward the paci
fication of the discontented part of
population has been made, while the
insutrection has gained no advan
tages and exhibits no more of the ele
ments of power or of ultimato success
than were exhibited a year ago.
Spain, on the other band, has not
succeeded in its suppression, and the
parties stand appanntiy in me same
relative attitude which they have oc
cupied for a long time past. This
contest has lasted now for more than
four years. Were it seen at adistance
from our neighborhood we might be
indifferent to its result, although hu
manity could not be unmoved by
many of its incidents wherever tbey
might occur. It is, however, at our
door.
I cannot doubt that the continued
maintenance of slavery iu Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to
the continuauce of tbis strife. A
terrible wrong is the natural cause of
a terrible evil. The abolition of
slavery and the introduction of other
reforms in the administration of the
government of Cuba could not fail to
advance the restoration of eace aud
order. It is especially to be hoped
that the present liberal government
of Spain will voluntarily adopt tbis
view. The law of emanciiation,
which was nasaed more than two
years since, has remained unexecuted
in the absence of regulations for its
enforcement. It was but a feeble
step towards emancipation but it was
the recognition of right and was
hailed as such, and exhibited iu Spain
in iianuouy witii inn bciiuuiculs ui
humanity anai-l justice, aua iu sym
pattiy with the other powers of the
;brltlunand civilized wonu. wiiiun
the past few weeks tbe regulations
for curry ingout the laws of emancipa
tion have been announced, giving
evidence of the sincerity of the inten
tion of the present government to
! carry into effect the law of 1S70. I
have not failed to urge the cousidera
ition of the wisdom, the policy and
the Justice oi a mow enecuve system
for the abolition of the "rent .evil
which oppressed a race and continues
a blood v and destructive contest close
to our border, as well as tbe txpedi
ency and justice of conceding relorms
of which tne oropiietyis not ques
tioned. Deenlv impressed with the
conviction that the continuance of
slavery is one of the most active
causes of the continuance of tbe un
happy condition in Cuba, I regret to
believe that citizens of the Uuited
StHtes. or those churning to be such.
are large holders iu Cuba of what is
there c aimed as property, uui wnicu
is forbidden and denounced by the
laws of the United States. They are
thus in defiance of the spirit of our
own laws contributing to the con
tinuance of this -disiretoiug and sick
ening contest. In my last annual
message, I refened to tbia subject,
aud I again recommend such lepisla
tion as mav be proper to denounce,
and if not prevent, to uiscourage
American citizens from holding or
dealing in slaves. It is gratifying to
announce that the ratification of the
convention concluded under the
auspices of this government between
tpain on the one part, aud the allied
republics of the Pacific on the other,
Dmviding for an armistice, have beeu
exchanged, a copy of the instrument
is herewith submitted, it is nopeu
that this may be followed by a pei
manent Deace between the same
parties.
DIPLOMATIC POLICY WITH CHINA
AND JAPAN.
The differences which ui one time
threatened the mainlainance of peace
between Brazil aud the Argentine
Republic it is hoped are in the way
nt satisfactory adjustment. With
these states as with the Republics of
Central and South America, we con
tinue to maintain the most friendly
relmlona. It is with regret, however
I announce that the government of
Venezuela has made no further pay
tnents on account of the awa-da un
der the convention of the 25th of
Annl. 1866. That Republic is under
stood to be now almost, if not quite
Iranquilized. It is hoped, therelore,
that it will lose no time in provi
ding for the unpaid balances of its
debt to tbe United hlates, wuicu uav
Ing originated in injuries to iu citi
zens bv Venezuelan authorities and
having been acknowledge.!, pursuant
to a treaty .in the mosi solemn lorra
known, an'ionz nations, it would
seem lo deserve a preference over
debts of" a Idiffereut origin and con
tracted in a different manner. This
subject is again recommended to the
attention oi uongresa iur aucu acuuu
as may be deemed, proper.
Our treaty relations with Japan
remain unchanged. An imposing
embassy Jrom I hat interesting and
progressive nation visited this coun
try duri ng the year that is passi ng, but
being unprovided with powers for the
signing of a cor. .-ention in this coun
try no conclusion in that direction was
reached. It is liopeu, nowever, mat
tbe interchange of opinions which
took place during their stay iu this
country has led to a mutual apprecia
tion or the interests mere, wnicu
may be promoted when tbe revision
of the existing treaty shall be under
taken. In this connection I renew
my recommendation of one year ago,

AND JAPAN. RELIEF OF DISTRESSED CITIZENS ABROAD
Congress, from the beginning of the
government, has wisely made pro-ilon
for the relief of distressed seamen in for
eign countries. No similar provision,
however, baa hitherto been made for the
relief of distressed citizens abroad other
than seamen. It is understood to be
customary with other governments to
authorize consuls to extend such relief
to thoir citizens or subjects in certa n
cases. A similar authority and an ap
propriation to carry it into effect are
commended, in rase of citizens of the
United Suites, destitute or sick under
auch cirourostsnces. It is well known
that auch citizens resort to foreign coun
tries in great numbers, though most of
them are able to bear tbe expense inci
dent to locomotion. There are some
who, through accident or otherwise, be
come penniless, aud havo no friends at
home able to succor them.
Persons In this situation most either
perish or east themselves upon the
charity of foreigners or tie returned at
tbe private charge of our own officers,
wbo usually, even with the most benev
olent dispositions have no hing to spare,
were such the purposes. Should the
smhnrity and appropriation tie made
care will e taken lo carry the bo
niticence of Congress Into effect tbat it
oe not unnec ssarilv or unworthily be
stowed.

With tbe great redaction of taxation
by tbe acta of Congress at its last session,
the expenditure of the government in
collecting the revenue will be much re
duced for the next fiscal year. It is very
doubtful, however, whether any further
reduction of so vexatious a burden upon
any people will be practicable for the
present. At all events, as a measure of
justice to tbe holders of I he nation's cer
tificates orindebreduess, I would recoin
uieud that no more legislation be had on
this subject, unless it bet correct errors
of omission or Commission in the present
laws, until suflidout time has elapsed to
prove that it can be done and still leave
sufficient revenue to mest the current
expenses of the government, pay tbe
interest on the public debt, snd provide
for the sinking fund established by law.
The preservation of our national eredit
is of the highest importance. Next in
importance to this comes a solemn duty
to provide a national currency of a
fixed, unvarying value as compared w itu
gold, and as soon as practicable, having
due regard for the interests oflbedebtor
ciass and the vlelsiiudes or trade and
commerce, and convertible into gold at
par.
WAR DEPARTMENT.

fisol vear ending June :, 1872, lo be,
$!5,372,157 20, showing a redneiion in
favor of the last Uscal year or $427,834 72.
The estimates for military appropriation
for the next fiscal year, ending June 30,
1374, are 3 ),137 78. The estimates of
tbe chief of engineers are submitted
separately for for fortifleatio.is, river and
harbor improvements, and for public
buildings aud grounds, and the Wash
iogtnu aqueduct. The affairs ef the
freedmen's buicau have all been trans
ferred to the War Department, and tbe
regulations have been put into execution
for the apeedv pavment or bounty due
colored soldlera, properly coming under
that bureau.
All war accounts for money and
property, prior lo 1871, have been
examined and transmitted to tbe
treasury for final settlement. During
the fiscal yeai there have been paid
for transportation on railroads, $1,300
000 of which $80,957 was over the
Pacific railroads. For transportation
hy water, $65,637,3-52, and by stage
$48,075.84, and for the purchase of
transportation animals, wagons, hire
of team ters, eta, $9-?4,6S0 6i. About
$370.0d0 have beeu collected from
southern railroads dtiriug the year,
leaving about $4,000,000 still due. Tbe
quartermaster has examined and
transmitted to the aceouiilii-g officers
for settlement $30,717,272 of claims by
lowal citizens for quaitermaslera'
stores taken during the war.
The - subsisting supplies to the
amount of $89,04S. 12 bae been issued
to the Indians. The annual average
of mean strength of Ihe army was
24 101 whiteand 1,494 eolored soidiers.
The total deaths for the year reported
were 367 white and 54 colored.
The distribution of the medical and
surgical history of the war is yet lo be
ordered by Congress. There exists
an absolute necessity for a medical
corps-of the lull number established
by act of Congress of JulySsth, 1806,
there bring now fifty-nine vacancies,
and the number of successful can
didates rarely exceeds eight or ten in
any one year.
The river and harbor improvements
have been carried on with energy

only partially completed, the results
have saved to commerce many times'

The attention of Coui;res will be
called during the present session to

of the constantly increasing sur
plus of the western and southern
products to the Atlantic seaboard.
'fbe subject is one that will force itself
unon the legislative Drancn oi iu
government sooner or later, and I sug
gest, therefore, that immediate steps
he taken to earn an available iniot
mation to insure equitable aud just
legislation on a route to connect the
Mississippi valley with the Atlantic
at Charleston, uuth Carolina, and
Savannsli. Georgia, by water, by the
Ohio aud Tennessee rivers and canals
and slackwater ravigatiou to tne ba
vannab and Ocmulgee rivers has been
surveyed and a report made by an ac
complished engineer officer of the
army. Hecond and third new routes
will be proposed for the consideration
of Conirress, namely: by sc extension
of the Kanawha and James river canal
to the Ohio, and by an extensien of
the Chesapeake and Uhio canal,
am not preiaired to recommend gov
ernment aid to ttiese or -otner enter

they are not ouly oi national interest,
but that when completed tney will
be of a value - oiiiraensurate with their

rapidly than the means or transporta

precedented growin in population ann
products of the whole country will
refill ire additional facilities, and chea
per means for the more bulky articles
of commerce to reach tide water, and
a market will be demanded iu the
near future. Iseotiallv demonstrable,
I would therefore suggest either a
committee or commission to be au
thorized to consider this whole .ques
tion and to report to Congress at some
future day for Its belter guidance in

The rail loads of the country have been

a project to iaci itate commerce by tt e

has been agitated fur many years, will
no doubt be called to your attention tbis
session. Lookiug to the great future ef
the country, the increasing uemanos oi

an b ect not only to hsve It exammea
and report upon the various practicable
routes lor connecting too .Mississippi
with the tide water on the Atlantic, but
the leasibilitv of an almost lann-locsed
navigation from Maino to th Gulf of
Mexico. Sueh a ronte along our coast
would be of great value at all times, and
of inestimable -aluo in ra.-.eof afoieigo
war. Nature has provided tho greater
part of this route and the obstacles to be
overcome are easily within the skill o.
the encineers. I have not shaded to
hi subiect with the view of having any
further expenditures of public money at
this lime than may ne necessiry to pro
cur.- an-l iilace all tbe necessary infor
mation before Congresa in an authentic
rorm, to enable it hereafter, il deemed
practicable and worthy, to legislate on
tbe subject without delay.
The report oi me secretary oi me our
herewith accompany iag, explains luily
tho condition of that biauch of the pub
lic service, its wants and deticienccs,
expenses incurred during the past year
and appropriations fur tho same. It also
gives a complete history of the services
of tbe navy for the past year in addition
to its regular services. It is evident tbat
unless steps are taken to preserve onr
navy, that in a very few years tbe Uni
ted Stales will ho tbe weakest nation
o pon the ooean of ail the great powers.
With an energetic, progressive,. business
neonle like ours, penetrating and form
ing busiuess relatione with every part of
tbe known worm, a navy s-rong euuusu
to command the respect of our flag
abroad is necessary for the full protec
tion of l heir rlghta. 1 recommend a
careful consideration by Congresa of the
recommendations made by tbe Secretary
of the Navy.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
:
The accompanying report of the Post
master Ue-.ierai furnishes a full and sat
isfactory exhibit of tbe operations of tbe
Post Office Department during the year.
Tbe ordinary revenue oi the department
for the fiscal year ending Jane 30, 1S72,
amounted to jl.915,4 37, and the ex

of $3,897,707 28 over the deboiency for
tbe year 1871. Other interesting atatie

approval ot tne .Minister ol riuance,
luile remains to be accomplished by the
treaty for some lime to come, in respect
to i h reduction of rates (or improved
facilities for postal intercourse. Your
favorable consideration la respectfully

for tbe increase of tbe salaries of heads
of bureaus.
I have heretofore recommended the
abolition of tbe franking privilege,
and see no reason now. for changing
my views on that subject. It not
having been favorably regarded by
Conirress, however, I now suggest a
modification of that privilege to cor
rect its glaring aud costly abuses. I
would recommend also the appoint
ment of a committee or commission
to take into consideration the best
method, equitable to private corpora
tion who have, invested their time
and capital in establishing telegraph
i. lies, oi acquiring iDe title to all
telegraph lines now in operation, and
of connecting this service with the
postal service of the natiou. - It is not
probable that this sunjrKSS could re
ceive the proper consideration during
the limits of a short sesuiou of Con
gresf, but tt may be initiated so that
further action may be fair to the
government and to private parties
concerned. There are but three lines
of ocean steamers, namely : The
Pacific mail bteamship company, be
tween lan rrancisco. China and
Japan, with provision made for semi
monthly service after October - 1st,
1873; the United States aud Brazil

New Zealand and Australian line.
monthly, plying between tbe United
sia es aud foreign ports, and owned
and operated under our flag. I ear
nestly recommend that such liberal
contacts for carrying the mails be
authorized with these lines a-) will
insure their continuance. If the ex
pediency of extending tbe aid of the
government to lines of steamers which
hitherto have not received it should
be deemed worthy of thecousidsration
of Congress. Political and commer
cial objects make it ad disable to
bestow such aid on a line under flag
tietween Panama and the western
South American ports. By this
means much trade now diverted to
other countries might be brought to
us, to the mutual advantage of this
country and those lying in that
quarter of tbe continent of America.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury will show an alarming fall
ing off in our carrying trade for the
last ten or twelve years, and even for
the past year. I do not believe thai
public treasure can he hetterexpended
in the interest of tbe whole people
than in trying to recover this trade.
An expenditure of $,000,000 per
annum for the next five years, if it
would restore to us our proportion of
the trade of the world would be pro
fitably expend d The ince of labor
in Europe has so much enhanced
within the lat tew years that the cost
of building and operating ocean
steamers in the United States is not
s much gie ter, that I believe the
time ha arrived for Congress to take
this subject into seri:ius consideration.
The disbursements through the De
partment of Justice will be furnished
by the repor of the Attorney Gener
al, aud though these have been some
what iucieased by tbe recent act of
Cotigiess lo enforce the rights of citi
sens of the United States to vote in
ihe several States of the Union, and
to enlorce tbe provisions of the Four
teenth Amendment to the Constitu
tion of the United States and other
amendments thereto, I cannot ques
tion tbe necessity and salutary etlects
of these enactments. Reckless and
lawless men, I regret to say, have as
sociated themselves together iu some
localities to deprive other citlxens of
tbe right guaranteed to them by tbe
-Constitution of the United Slates,
and to that end have committed
dveds: of violence, bat the prostcu-'thm-
and punfchment of many of
these persons have tended greatly t
the repression of these disorders. I
do not doubt that a great majority of
the people in all parts of the country
favor the full enjoyment by all per-,
sons of these rights, to which they
are entitled under the Constitution
and the laws, and I Invoke-tbe aid
and influence of all good citizens to
prevent organizations whose objects
are by unlawful means to interfere
with those right) I look with con
fidence to the time, not far distant,
when the obvious advantages of good
order aud peace will Induce an aban
donment of all coiuhiuations prohib
ited by the acts referred to, aud wheu
It will be unnecessary to carry on
prosecutions or inflict punishments
to protect citizens from the lawless
doings of such combinations. Ap
plications hsve been made to me to
pardon persons convicted of a viola
tion of said acts uoou the ground that
clemency in such cases would tend to
tranquilize tho public mind, and to
tmt (ha virtue of that policy I am
disposed, as far as my sense of justice
will permit, to give to these applica
nous a favorable consideration ; but
any action thereon is not to be con
strued as indicating any roisi
mv determination to enforce with
rigor such acts, so long as the con-
spiracles ana comuiuauous

some of Ibcw for some years has lieen

a recent da'c. and in all the current
business has been promptly dispatched.
THE INDIANS.
The policy which was adopted at
the beginning of the adiniuistratlon
with regard to tbe management of the
Indians has beeu a successful as its
most atdent friends anticipate.!.
Within so short a time it has reduced
the expense of their mansgemeut, de
creased their forages on the white set
tlements, tended to give the largest
opportunity to the extension of the
eieat railways through Ihe public do

into more remote districts of th coun

the condition of the Indians. The
policy will be maintained without
any change, excepting such as further
experiei.ee may show to be necessary
twniW it more efficient The sub
ject of converting the so-ealred ina
an. Territory, south of, Kansas, Into
home lor the Indians, and erecting
thereon a territorial torm of rovern
ment. Is oue of great importune- as a
complement of the existing Indian
policy, The Question or removal to
the teritory has within the past year
been presented to many of the tribes
resident upon other and less desirable
portions of the public domain, snd
has generally been received jy them
with favor. As a preliminary step to
the organization of such a territory.
It will lie necessary to continue the
Indians now resident therein to farm
of proper size, which should lie se
cured to them la fee; the residue to be
used for tbe settlement of - other
friendly Indians. Kfforts will be
made lu ttie immediate iuiure to in
duce the removal of as many peceahly
disposeded Indians only to the Indi
an territory as can be settled properly
without disturbing the harmony ol
i hose already there. There Is no oth
er location now available where a
people who .are endeavoritg to ae
quire a knowledge' of pustoral aud
agricultural pursuits can be as well
accommodated as upon tbe onoccu
pied lauds in the Indian territory.
A territorial government thould
however, protect the Indians from
the inroads of whites for a t-rm o
years, until they become sufficiently
advano d in the arts of civilization to
guard their own rights. aud trom th
disposal of lands held hy them for tht
same period.
SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS.
During the lost fi-cal year there
were disposed or out of the public
lands 11 864 97-5 acres, a quantity
greater by 1,090,270 acres tliua wV
disposed of the previous year. O
Ibis amount 1,370,33) acres were sold
for cash, 389,400 acres located will,
military watrauts. 4 671,332 acres ta
ken for homesteads, b'J3 013 acres iocs
ted with college scrip, 3.V4,887 acres
granted to railroad, 4(3o.347 acre,
granted to wagon roads, 614. 2o5 aere
given to states as swamp land, and 5,
0 acres located by Indian scrip.
The cash receipts from all sources
to the land office amounted to $3 218
lot). During the same period 2.013WS
acres of the public lands were survey
ed, amounts to 583,3j4,780 acres, leav
Ing 1,257,731.628 acres of the public
land yet unsurveyed. The reports
from the auhordiuate of the Lahd
Offices contain interesting in forma
tion in regard tt their respective dis
t icta. They uniformly meulion the
rruilfulnes of the soil during the past
season, and the increased yield of nil
Kind- of produce evince, in the those
states and territories where mining
is the principal busiuess, the agricm

PATENTS.
During tbe year ending Sopte i ber 30.
1872, there were issued from the nateul
ftics 13,620 patents, 233 extensions, and
556 certificates and registers of trade
marks. During tbe same time 9,567 ap
plications for patents, including reissues
aud designs have been received, and
3. Io0 caveats bled. Tbe fees received
during the same period smonnted to
f70.095.9tW, ind the total expenditures lo
t02,355,390, making tbe net receipts over
tbe expenditures $7,7-40.006. Since 1838
two hundred thousand applications for
patents have been hied, and about 134,
000 patents is-ued, the offices being coo
Jucted nnder tbe same laws and general
organization aa were adopted at their
original inauguration, when only from
one hundred to five hundred applica
tions were made per annum. The com
missioner shows that tbe office bas out
grown tbe original man, and tbat a new
organization has become necessary.
Tins subject was presented to Congresa
in a apveial communication iu February
last, which met my approval snd the
approval of tbe Secretary of the Interior,
and tbe suggestions contained in said
communication were embraced in a bill
that was reported to tbe House by the
Committee on Patents at the .ast session.
Tue subject of the reorganization of tbe
Patent Office, as contemplated by the
bill referred to. is one of such impor
tance to tbe Industrial interests of the
country that I commend it to the atten
tion of Congress. The commiss oner
also treats tbe subiect of tbe separation
of tbe Patent Office trom tbe department
oi tne interior. Ibis subiect is also em
braced in the bill beret -fore referred to.
Tbe commissioner complains of the want
of room for the model gallery and for tbe
working force and necessary hies of the
office. It is impossible tn transact the
busiaeea ol the orr)ie properly without
more r.sim in wnicn to arrange Dies and
drawings tnst must be consulted hourly
iu tbe transaction of busiuesa. The
whole of the Patent Office builoing will
soon be needed, if it m not already, lor

PENSIONS.
The amount paid for pensions in tbe
last nscai year was 3i,ia.340. an
! amount larger hy $3,708,434 than was
I naid 1'urinir the nreetedini? vear. ff
this amount, c',313,409 wa- pnid on
der the act of Congress of February
li, 1S71, to survivors of tbe war of
1812. The annual increase of pen
sions by the legislation of Congress
nas more man Kept pace villi the
natural yearly losses from the rolls.
The act of Congress of June 8, 1872,
has added an estimated amount of
$7oO,iiOO per annum to the rolls, with
out increasing tbe cumber of pen
sioners. . w e cannot, therefore, loot
for any substantial decrease iu tbe
expenditures of this department for
some time to come, or so long as Con
gress continues to so change tbe rates
of pension. The wbole number of
soldiers enlisted in the war of the re
bellion was 2,638,-523. The total num
ber of claims for invalid pension is
IiB.out', being but six per cent, of tbe
wbole number of enlisted men. The
total number of claims on hand
the beginning of the year was 91,60!);
tbe number received during the year
was 2fi,o74 ; the number disposed of
was 3-i.lTS, making a net gain of ,-
24. The number of claims now on
file Is 79,06-5. On tbe 30th of June,
1872, theie were on the rolls the
names of 9-5,400 invalid military pen
sioners, 113,518 widows, orphans and
dependent relatives, making an ag
gregate of 200,023 army pensioners.
At tbe same time there were on the
rolls the names of 1,449 navy pen
sioners, and 1,730 widows, orphans
and dependent relatives, making the
whole number of navy pensioners 3,
179. There have been received
since tbe passage of the act to pro
vide pensions for the survivors of the
war of 1812, 36, -Sol applications prior
to June 30, 1872. Of these there were
allowed during tbe last fiscal year
20, 126 claims; 4,845 were njected
during tbe year, leaving 11,580 claims
pending fiom tbat date, t he num
ber of pensions of all classes granted
during ths last fiscal year was 23,838 ;
during that period there were dropped
from the rol s for various causes 9,104
names, leaving a grand total of 232.-
pensioners on tbe rolls on the 30th
if June. 1872. It is thought that tbe
claims for pensions on account of the
war of 18I2 will all be disposed or oy
the 1st ol May. 1873. ll is estimated
tbat $30,480,000 will be required for
the pension service during the next
bscal year,
THE CENSUS.
The ninth census is shout completed
Its eomrdetion is a subject of congratu
lation, inasmuch as the use to be made
of tbe alalia! ica therein contained de
iiends very greatly on tbe promptitude
or publication. Tbe Secretary of the
Interior recommends that a census he
taken in 1875, which recommendation
should rei-eive the ready attentiou ol
Congress. The interval at present estab
Imbed between tbo federal census is m
ong thai the Informalioa obtained at the
decennial periods aa to tne material con
dition, wauls and resources of tbe nation
is of little practical value after the ex
piration of the hi si half of that period.
It wonld probably obviate the coustitn-
tional provision regarding tbe decennial
census, if a census taken iu 1875 should
be divested of all political character and
no reapportionment of Congressional ,
representation be made under it. Much
a census, coming as it wonld in the last
year of tbe first century of onr national
Hxbdence. woutd furnish a noble uionu
mentof tbe progress of the United States
uuring that oantury.
EDUCATION.
Tbe rapidly Increasing interest la edu
cation is a most encouraging feature in
tbe current history or the country, and
Is n doubt true that il is due in a great
zqea'ure lo tho edectsof the Bureau of
Knucation. That office is enutinuail
receiving evidences which abundantly
prove its efficiency from, tbe various
institutions of lcurninir and elueators of
all kinds throughout the connti v. The
report of the commissioner coutainsa
at amount o; eiuca-.ional details of
itreat interest. Tbe bill now pending
uniure congress providing lor tile appro
priation of pan of tbe proceeds ol the
aies of pupiie laius .or educational
purpose, lo aid Ihe slates in the general
education of their risiug generation, is
" """ oi sucn great importance to
to our real progress, and is so unani
mously approved by the leading friends

favorable attentiou of Con areas..
TERRITORIAL AFFAIRS.
AfTaln iu tbe territories are gener
ally satisfactory. Tbe energy and
business capacity or tbe pioneers who
are settling up tbe vast domains not
yet incorporated into states, are keep
ing pace in internal improvements
aud civil government with the older
cominuuiues. Iu but oue of them,
Utah, isthe condition of ahirs un
aatistactory. txcept so far as the
quiet of the citizens ay be disturbed
oy real or imagiuary danger of Indi
an hostilities, ,t has seemed to be the
policy of the Legislature of Utah to
evade all rr sponsibility to the govern
ment of tbe United Mates, aud even
.. bold a position iu hostility to it.
I recommend a careful revision of tbe
.re-eullawsof tbe Territory by Con
ars, and the enactment of such a
.aw. a the oue proposed la Congress
l its last session, for instance, or
-xjiueihiug similar to it, as will secure
teace, the equuiiiy of all cil liens be
f re the law, and the ultimate extiu
g lishmeut of polygamy. -
Since the establishment of a terri
orial goveruiueut for ihe Ub-laict of
Columbia, the improvement of the
oouduioii o the city of Washington
tudaiirrouudinga, and U.e increased
prosperity of the citizens, areobservu
me lo the tuosi casual visitor. The
ualioo, being a large owner of prop
erty iu this city, should bear witn the
citizen of the District a just share of
me expense of these improvements.
I recouimeud, therefore, an appropri
ation to reimburse the citizens from
work done by them along ud in front
of public grouuds during tbe past
year, and liberal appropriations in
order tbat the improvt ment aud em
iiellisbment of tl. public buildings
aud grounds may keep pace with the
improvements madr by the territorial
authorities. - ' .
AGRICULTURE.
The report of the Commissioueis of
Ai-riculturef gives a v-eiy full and In
teresting account or the several divi
sions of that department the horti
cultural, agricultural, statistical, ento
mological aud chemical and the benefit-
conferred by each upon the agri-
cultural interests of the country, i he
whole report is a complete history in
detail of the workings of that depart
ment iu all its branclies,5bowing the
manner in which the farmer, mer
chant aud miner is informed, and the
extent to which be is aided in his
pursuits. Tbe commissioner makes
oue recommendation that measures
be takeu by Congress to protect and
induce the. plautiegof forests, and
suggests that no part of the public
lauus enouid be disposed of without
the condition that one-tenth of it be
reserved in timber, where it exists,
and where it does not exist, induce
ments suouiti ne oirered for planting
it.
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.
In accordance with tha terms of the
act of Congress, approved March 3, 1871,
pruviuing ior tne celebrauou of the one
hundredth anniversary of American
independence, a commission baa been
orgauized consisting of two members
from each of tbe States and Territories.
The commission has held two sessions,
and has made satisiaclory proressin the
organization and in the initiatory steps
necca-iary for carrying out tbe provisions
of the act, and for executing the provi
sions also of the act of June 1, 1S71, cre

A preliminary report of progress has
been received from tbe president of tne
commis-ionand is herewith transmitted,
il will be the duty ol the commission at
your coming session to transmit a report
of tbe progress made, and to lay before

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
An earma: des re bat baen felt to cor
rect the abuses which bavaxrown up in
the civil service of tbe ciuntry, through
the detective method of maKitig appoint
ments lo office, wbtoa bas been regarded
too much aa the reward of political ser
vices. Under authority or Congress,
rules have been estai-l-shed to regulate
toe terms of office and the mode of ap
pointments. It cannot be expected
that any system or rule can be entirely
etleetive and prove a1 perfect remedy
tor tbe existing evils until they
bave been thoroughly tested bv actual
practice, and ante Dated according
to the requirements of the service.
Curing my term of office it shall be my
best endeaver to so apply the rules aa to
secure tbe greatest possible reform In
the civil service of the government, but
it will require the direct attention of
Congresa to render the entorcement of
the svslein binding upon my successors,
aud I hope tbat tfie experience of the
past year, together with appropriate,
legislation by Congress, may reach a
satisfactory solution of the question, and
secure to the public service, fur ad time,,
a practti-al method of obtaining faithlul.
and efficient officers and emploves.
