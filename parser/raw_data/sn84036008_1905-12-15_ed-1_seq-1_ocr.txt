[By Associated Press]
Washington, Dec. 14.-The senate
speat four hours today in discussing
the Panama canal emergency appro
priation bill and when it adjourned
the bill was still under consideration.
There were set speeches by Teller,
Scott and Morgan and there followed
a general debate in which all sides of
the controversy were exploited, includ
ing the question of salaries, the con
trol of the Panama railway and the
necessity for general legislation on
the canal subject.
Allison, chairman of the committee
on appropriations, expressed the opin
ion that congress should take up the
question of salaries in connection with
other legislation. He also said the
status of the Panama railway should
to be made the subject of legislation.
Teller, Scott and Morgan expressed
dissatisfaction with the conditions in
Panama, but all indicated a determi
nation to support the supply measures
necessary to secure construction of
the canal as at present undertaken.
Teller advocated a sea level canal,
Scott spoke in support of the San
Blas route as preferable to all others,
and Morgan expressed the opinion
that before the Panama canal was
completed another canal will be nec
essary to do the business required.
A separate bill regulating the is
suance of bonds for the canal and plac
ing them on the same basis as other
government bonds was passed without
debate.
Promise by Elkins.
During the day Elkins made a state
ment from the committee on inter
state commerce expressing the opin
ion that the .committee would present
a report within a seasonable time.
HOUSE TALKS INSURANCE.
Many Speeches Treat of Other Than
Subject Under Consideration.
[By Associated Press]
Washington, Dec. 14.-Debate on the
recommendation in the president's
annual message regarding insurance
regulation occupied the house again
today without conclusion. The pend
ing resolution refers to the question
to the ways and means committee and
in its defense Payne, chairman, made
the argument that the only way con
gress could control insurance was
through the taxing power. To this
many objections were made. Mem
bers said they could not afford to take
the position that the only way the
government could control insurance
was through taxing it, but that it
should resolutely pursue other meth
ods of control until some way was
found which would be effective.
The liberal rules of debate allowed
lengthy speeches, which went off on
other subjects more or less intended
for home consumption and applicable
to particular localities.

STEEL TRUST
OUTWITS BILL
SECURES VALUABLE LAND IN
MESABA IRON RANGE.
HINT AT RETALIATION
Great Northern Likely to Build Road
Into Territory As Retaliatory Meas
ure For Giant Corporation's Inva
sion of What Was Regarded as Com
pany's Exclusive Domain.
[By Assoclated Press]
Duluth, Minn., Dec. 14.--One of the
biggest mining deals in the history of
the Meseba iron range was consum
mated today, when the transfer of a
half interest in what are known as the
J. J. Hill unleased ore lands on the
western Mesaba range, was formally
made to the United States Steel cor
poration, the papers being filed at
Grand Rapids, the county seat of Itas
ca county, Minnesota, today.
The principal part of the unleased
iron ore lands on this range comprises
a vast acreage of the west end of the
Mesaba, known as the Walker lands.
These lands have been variously esti
mated to contain from 100,000,000 to
300,000,000 tons of ore running about
one half bessemer.
Steals March on Hill.
It has not been generally known
that the Great Northern has owned
only a one-half interest in the Walker
lands and when the steel corporation
became informed as to the proboble
quantity and quality of the ore there,
negotiations were entered into by it
with T. B. Walker of Minneapolis,
with the result that the corporation
has acquired the half interest still con
trolled by him.
It is generally believed that the
steel corporation stole a march on the
Great Northern when it acquired the
half interest in the Walker lands. It
has been broadly hinted that the
Great Northern will build an ore road
to the Vermillion range by way of re
taliation against the steel corporation
for invading the western Meseba.
Many people had long assumed that
the Great Northern would at least haul
the ore from the Walker lands, but re
cent developments make it appear
certain that the steel corporation pro
poses to have a hand in it

CZAR PINS FAITH TO WITTE
Plot Against Premier Fails and He Con
tinues at Head of Ministry.
[By Associated Press]
St. Petersburg, Wednesday, Dec. 13,
via Eydtkuhnen, Dec. 14.-The gov
ernment's advices today from the
Baltic provinces, forwarded part of
the way from Riga by courier, are of
the most alarming character. Bands
of thousands of Lettish peasants are
roaming the country in the vicinity of
Riga, putting the torch to the houses
on all the estates and even entering
the town of Riga itself. The districts
of Riga and Ventun are entirely in the
hands of the insurgents. The revolt
is spreading to all parts of Courland.
All railroad communication with Riga
is cut. The insurgents have seized a
number of stations of the three rail
roads leading from that city and are
advancing against others.
According to tne government's infor
mation all the sailors from the com
mercial steamers in the harbo of Riga
have joined the strike.
Stands by Witte.
According to reports from Tsarskoe
Selo the reactionary camparilla, head
ed by General Count Elexis Ignatieff
and M. Steschinsky, formed to effect
the downfall of Count Witte and to
create a dictatorship, has failed and
his majesty is stnding firmly by the
premier.
More Aggressiveness Demanded.
M. Menshikoff, the well known
writer, who is in close touch with the
court, is out with a strong article de
manding the inauguration of an ag
gressive fight against the revolution
before it is too late. M. Menshikoff
says:
"The revolutionaries, like the
French convention, openly send emis
saries and do not conceal their inten
tions. They act in the full light of
day, while the government works in1
secret. The government, it is true,
has cannon, but, perhaps, only for the
present, while they are not necessary.
When they are needed none can
guarantee that they will not be in the
possession of the revolutioniaries.
TOOLE WILL CALL NO SPECIAL
SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE
[By Associated Press]
Helena, Dec. 14.-Better freight
rates for Montana is the object to be
attained by a conference here of busi
ness men, cattlemen and other ship
pers from various parts of the state.
The conference began in the Unitarian
church today, the visitors being wel
comed to Helena by W. Hedges,
speaker of the lower house of the
legislature, Mayor Purcell and Gover
nor Toole. About 100 delegates were
present from outside points.
Governor Toole in addressing the
gathering said he hoped it, would
achieve its object. But if it were
proposed to have a special session of
the legislature to enact a railway oom
The present anarchy and suspense are
due to the inaction of the govern
ment. Witte, like Kuropatkin, not
only permits the enemy to arm and to
concentrate his forces, but to make
his dispositions and to choose the
moment for giving battle. Such tactics
will no more win in. Russia than they
did in Manchuria."
It is officially declared that the im
perial family does not intend to leave
Tsarskoe-Selo in the near future.
' ,The government is sending several
columns of troops to the Baltic provin
ces of Esthonia and Courland and to
.Riga. In, response to appeals from the
German embassy demanding the pro
tection of German subjects, the gov
ernment has replied that ample troops
were now on the way to insure protec
tion of all foreigners.
Peculiarly Atrocious Murder.
August von Hennings, a prominent
member of the Baltic nobility and as
sistant chief of his district, was atroc
iously murdered at his residence near
Riga by a revolutionary band. Two
dragoons, who were detailed to guard
the residence, also were killed.
A servant, who walked 60 miles to
catch a train, brought the details of
the terrible event to St. Petersburg.
According to the servant, the revolu
tionaries demanded that von Ten
nings give up his sword. On being
told that as an officer he could not sur
render with honor, the revolutionaries
shot him. Subsequently his head was
hacked off and his body cut to pieces
and fed to the dogs.
The latest class to organize is the
chimney sweeps. They have decid
ed that it will be impossible for them
to work without the promulgation of
a constitution.

'MORE MEN
IN FIELD
PARTY NOW OUTFITTING HERE
FOR BILLINGS AND GREAT
FALLS RAILROAD SURVEY.
MAKES THE FOURTH
Chief Engineer Smith of the Great
Northern Now in this City-Has
Secured Services of W. B. Young,
Formerly With United States Recla
mation Service to Take Charge of
New Party.
That James H. Hill is in deadly
earnest in his plans for building a
railroad from Billings to Great Falls,
is evidenced by the fact that there are
already three parties in the fields be
tween this city and Armington, and
another party is outfitting right here
at the present time.
Several days ago W. C. Smith of St.
Paul, chief engineer of the Great
Northern railway, arrived in this city.
His first official act was to secure the
permanent services of W. B. Young,
an engineer of wide experience, to
take charge of a party that shall
begin work at this end of the line.
Mr. Young has been in charge of a
camp of the government reclamation
service for several years. He spent
two or three years at Cody making
the preliminary surveys for the big
canal that is to water the Big Horn
basin from the reservoir in the Sho
shone canyon, and is therefore well
qualified for the work at hand. Mr.
Young has been busily engaged for the
past two days in employing men and
preparing to outfit the party. Two car
loads of outfit materials are expected
to arrive from St. Paul any day, and
he will then be readS to start on his
work.
Looking Over Proposed Line.
Messrs Smith and Young have al
ready driven out over the probable
line of the survey to a distance of 20
miles or more, following the old Bur
lington surveys up Alkali creek. It is
expected by those who are in a posi
tion to know anything about the mat
ter that the road will leave Billings
by that route. The party that Mr.
Young is outfitting will probably make
this city its headquarters for a week
after it starts to work. During that
time it will be running lines out the
Alkali creek route and perhaps other
routes will be prospected. He has
employed several young men about
town, one of them being the son of
Engineer Chase of the Billings Land
and Irrigation company. It is stated,
also, that a young son of President
James J. Hill will be a member of Mr.
Young's party.
Speaking of the proposed new rail
road last evening a prominent busi.
ness man stated that he would not be
surprised if, in a year from this date,
one could travel over the new line
from Billings to Great Falls. "What
with the new railroad building and the
sugar factory going up there will be
work for everybody next spring, and
when the laboring men are busy,
times are always good," he said.
"Then there will come, also, the open
ing of the reservation, which I con
fidently believe will be done next fall.
The year 1906 will undoubtedly be
one of the greatest years for commer
cial and industrial advancement in the
history of the city, and I hope that
many more will follow. Talk about
Billings having an inflated boom that
is liable to burst at any time-wel,
we'll show 'em."
