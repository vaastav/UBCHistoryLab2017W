ed ly Captain Melianghlln Evl
dence In the Fellows Case.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.-Father Ducey's
attendance on the sessions of the Lexow
committee were, not Intermitted to-day.
The clergyman said he had not received
a reply to his latest letter to Archbishop
Corrlgan. Another notable attendant at
the early sitting of the committee was
Mrs. Elizabeth B. Grannis, the social and
dress reformer.
Raphael Angelo told the committee that
he lost an eye from a blow struck by a
policeman Zimmerman. He had not sued to
recover damages because he thought it
would be impossible to receive justice in a
suit against a policeman. This witness said
be had paid money tnrough a lawyer.
whoso name be could not recall, to escape
prosecutloa in the Jefferson Market Folice
Court.
Mrs. Rebecca Freem, who has been en
gaged in missionary work on the East
Side, told a story of the general violation
of the excise law in her district. She told
of policemen she had seen drunk, and how
one of them went into a saloon with her.
When a woman who had been abused by
her husband applied to Justice Feitner for
a warrant for his arrest, he told the wom
an to coma back in two weeks, and when
the witness remonstrated with him he
abused her.
Bacldo Salindo related the arrest of him
self and some of his boarders, who were
playing domlnos when the police pounced
down upon them. Only out of more than
?1Q0 taken from them at the station was
returned to them when they were dis
charged. When witness complained, Capt.
Haughey struck him.
Marcus 13. McCarthy, now of Boston,
but formerly a saloon keeper here, testi
fied that he had paid several hundred dol
lars to Police Captains Slevin and Stephen
son, and their wardmen, for protection,
besides trusting patrolmen for drinks when
ever they asked It. He quit the saloon
business here, he said, "because the police
wanted too much."
August E. Costello, the author of "Police
Protectors," explained how he lost $19,000
through the police board of this city, liis
book was published under the auspices of
the police board, and he was to receive 20
per cent, of the proceeds. Superintendent
Uyrnes's book, "Great Criminals of New
York,", appeared almost simultaneously
with "Police Protectors," and when the
former was placed on the market the lat
ter was thrown back on Costello's hands,
causing a loss of $19,000 to him. The book
caused trouble between witness and
Captain (now Inspector) Williams and in
November, 1SSC, he was arrested by Captain
Williams and given over to two detectives
and sent to Captain (now Inspector) Mc
Laughlin's precinct. "Just as I put my foot
on the bottom step of the station house."
Costello said, "some one stepped out of the
shadow at one side and struck mo in the
face. I felL ' and as I lay in the
gutter, covered with blood and mud.
Captain McLaughlin tried to kick me in
the face. I warded off the blow with my
umbrella and finally ran inta the station
house, where I thought I would be pro
tected. The detectives made no effort to
help me. In the station house Captain Mc
Laughlin struck me with a pair of brass
knuckles. I was then allowed to wash in
the captain's office and was locked up all
night, and even a drink was refused me.
I found, or returning home next day,
that detectives had been there to annoy
my wife and children. As a result of the
way Captain McLaughlin abused me I was
In bed Ave days and had to call In Dr.
Jenkins. I never made any complaint to
the police board, because I was humiliated
and knew that the police would put a dif
ferent face on things If I made any row.
Therefore I desisted."
Dr. William T. Jenkins, now health offi
cer, and a brother-in-law of Klchard
Croker, was called and testified that he
had attended Mr. Costello at the time, and
thought he had been struck with brass
knuckles. Hearing was then adjourned to
10 o'clock to-morroar morning.

NEW YORK, Dec 3. In the Fellows in

the case has never been brought to the

witness admitted in cross-examination that
the case involved the examination of many
intricate accounts. Under orders from
Colonel Fellows Chief Clerk Unger refused

Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
PITTSBURG. Pa.. Dec. 5. The police of
ficials of Pittsburg are investigating the
National Detective Bureau, of Indianapolis.
Clyde B. Kerns, a young man of Port
Perry, Ta., called at the department and
complained he had paid money into the
bureau, In return for which he was to be
come a member of the bureau and receive
employment as a professional sleuth hound.
The certificate 'of membership has been re
ceived, but Kerns has derived neither ben
efit nor employment from it. The bureau
advertises extensively In Pittsburg and
other papers for agents to represent them
In every town. Kerns, being out of em
ployment, and as he Is of the age and dis
position that aspires to detective work, an
swered one of the ' advertisements. The
bureau sent him a letter and application
blank, with a request for a fee of $3. The
latter, it was stated, was to pay for his
detective's badge, certificate of membership,
card of introduction, etc. He was advised
to buy a copy of "How to Become a De
tective" from the Detective Publishing
Company, of Indianapolis, for $1. The book,
it was claimed, would, give him all the nec
essary instructions about identifying crim
inals and running them down. The bureau
promised him any work it would have for
experienced tdeuths in Port Perry. The lat
ter Is a small village of a few hundred in
habitants. The certificate that accompanied
the letter is signed "Chas. AInge, Supt."
The badge is a nickel-plated affair. Kerns
says he has written several times for em
ployment but received no answer. The po
lice say many persona have been victimized
by fake detective agencies, and that they
have been appealed to frequently to run
down the schemes. Superintendent of Po
lice O'Mara has written to Indianapolis ask
ing for information about the bureau.
Know othlngr Ahont Them.
The city officials receive inquiries almost
dally regarding the several detective agen
cies with headquarters in this city, and the
answer they make to all such letters is that
they know nothing at all about them.
Mayor Denny has made inquiries regarding
their manner of doing business. Superin
tendent Powell has also Investigated them,
but nothing unlawful has been found in
their operations. It is well known how
some of these agencies live. They cfierd
on the dollars of the detective-struck young
men who are more frequent In the small
towns than In the cities. Great induce
ments are held out to these credulous ones,
and after reading the circulars sent out by
the agencies they dream of great riches.
They can acquire wealth if sough t-for-crim-inals
and lost people chance their way.
The badges sent out by the agencies are
worthless, and more than one young man
has got into trouble by wearing one. No
police department in the country recognizes
them. The agencies send their agents a
paper containing the pictures and descrip
tions of persons for whom the reward is
offered and for whom the legitimate detec
tives of all the great cities are looking.
An agent's salary depends on his ability to
run down the persons sought. Occasionally
a green hand is found who has some nat
ural ability, and he generally makes some
thing out of it. But while the thousands
of agents or private detectives are watch
ing and waiting, the agency has the thou
sands of entrance fees.
Insurance Men at "War.
SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 5. Arthur K.
Maglll, the Pacific coast manager of the
Home Insurance Company, of Sew York,
and of the Phoenix Insurance Comp-any,
of Hartford. Conn., has withdrawn from
the Pacific . Insurance 1'nlon. His resigna
tion means a bitter fight consequent on his
ddtennlaatfoi to cut ratci.. The nouh.
teTCouTse rule was put into effect against
Maglll at onoe. The rule Is in the nature
of a boycott and prevents all other insur
ance companies on the Pacific coast from
accepting business through iMajruTs com
panies or of sharing business to the line
of reinsurance with either of hl3 com
panies. .
EVANGELICAL CONFERENCE,
Qnestion Considered by Uelea-ates of
the Xew United Chureh.
NAPIERVILE, Ind., Dec. 5.-In the
United Evangelical Church General Confer
ence the day ijvas devoted to the revision
of the book of discipline. The matter of
Sunday schools was disposed of. The unit
organization in thl3 church is called a class,
and its officers consist of a leader and as
sistant, the duty of each was defined by a
chapter comprising thirteen sections, the
directions are explicit, the requirements not
burdensome, but are intended to encourage
zealous members, entice the lukewarm and
reprove the wayward. These proceedings
were important and intensely interesting.
The term of a bishop's office was under
consideration and called out a protracted
discussion. A large minority, composed
principally of ministers, contended that the
number of terms for which a pisnop might
be elected should be unlimited. The laymen
and a few ministers favored a restriction
to two terms of four years each in suc-
cesion, then a rent of four years before a
minister could be elected to the bishopric
The clause restricting the services of one
man as bishop for more than eight years
was carried by a small majority.
The representation of laymen in the an
nual and general conference was also under
consideration to-day. Nothing short of
equal representation in every important
body will satisfy the laymen. The major
ity of ministers favor this equality.
NEW YORK VERY SLOW.
Elevated Trains Do Xot Run nn Fast
as Common Hark Horses.
NEW YORK. Dec. 5. A livery hack
hor.-le beat the Manhattan elevated railroad
.ystm last night In a novel race from the
flattery to riftv-nfnth street. .The match
was for JoO a tdde. Lynwood Palmer, the
artl&t. backing the horse, and Frank Elliott,
the Canadian gentleman Jockey, backing the
elevated road. His blind confidence lost him
the wafer. The terms of the bet were that
Palmer could drive without police inter
ference from the Mattery to the Central
Park Riding Academy, Seventh avenue and
Fifty-ninth street and cover the route faster
than Kiliott couul travel by train. The
start was made from the Battery stairs
leading to the elevated station. Bertie
Ashenden was the starter and time keeper,
nnd drove with rainier, watch In hand. The
route was up Broad .vay and Seventh avenue
to the end of the course which was covered
In just twenty-nine minutes. The two men
were in a run-about wagon, pulled by u
horse hired from a livery stable. The best
time was made on upper Seventh avenue,
where there was no interference from pass
ing vehicles. Elliott arrived ten minutes
later.
ADA REHAN'S SILVER IMAGE.
Allced Attempt to Steal the White
Metal Mntiie of the AetreKn.
CHICAGO, Dec. 5. The silver statue of.
the actress, Ada Rehan, Is under guard of
half a dozen detectives, to-day, as the re
sult of the discovery of a plot to steal the
valuable Image. The statue has been on
exhibition at tho retail store of Carson,
Pierie, Scott & Co., and recently a man
representing himself as an employe of the
Montana Silver Statue Company, owners
of the statue, called at the store and se
cured the address of, the night watchman.
Last night, after closing hours, the man
presented to the night watchman an order
signed by the-Monlan'.conipany saying
that General Manager Hlgbee. of the com-
Eany was dead and asked that the statue
e delivered to the bearer. The watchman
refused to honor the order despite the
man's protests. The detectives who are
working on the case claim thaO a well
planned conspiracy had been laid to steal
the statue and. after melting it down, to
dispose of the silver.
GAVE IT TO THE CHURCH.
Suit Over Property Bequeathed to
Catholics by a- Kentucky "Widow.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Dec. 5. The contro
versy over the property of Mrs. Mar How
ard Preston, widow of John Preston, which
appeared in the courts of Louisville and
Trimble county on her death took a new
form In the filing to-dav of a suit here. Be
fore her death Mrs. Preston deeded to
Bishop Maes, In trust, for the Catholic
Church, a valuable farm of ,140 acres near
lexington. The suit begun to-day is to set
aside this deed of trust and to recover $4,740
as rental since January, 1S90. Mrs. John
Preston, whose property is now in dispute,
lived in a palatial house on the Ohio river
In Trimb'e county, Kentuckj'. The death
of an idolized child years ago gave her great
sorrow, and In her distress she adopted the
Catholic faith and became po devout that
she erected an altar in her home. Other
members of the family are prominently iden
tified with the Episcopal church.
LETTER ROXES ON STREET CARS.
Cleveland to llnve the. lleneflt of an

CLEVELAND, O., Dec 5. Assistant
Superintendent of Railway Mail Service
Matsen, of Washington, arrived here to
day, and Is making arrangements with the
Cleveland E'.ectrlc Street-railway Company
for the collection and delivery of the malls.
Letter boxes will be placed on electric
trains on the various lines, in case the
company accepts the proposition of the
government for the service. The latter of
fers the street-car company the same rate
as it pays steam railways, which is $42.75
for every two hundred pounds per mile per
annum. It is very likely that the proposi
tion will be accepted and that the service
will be started very soon. If the plan
works satisfactorily special electric postal
cars will be built and run over all the lines
in the city.
WHEAT FED TO STOCK.
Total Amount This Year May Ilench
7.1.30.1,000 Ilnshels.
WASHINGTON, Dec. C.-The returns
from the correspondents of the' statistical
division of the Department of Agriculture
relative to amounts of wheat fed to stock
estimate the quantity already fed, that Is
to say, up to Oct. 30, 48.030,000 bushels; and
the estimated amount to be fed 29,273,000
bushels, making a total of 7T,3(tt,0Oi) bushels.
These figures on wheat feeding are merely
the meager estimates from those States
whose correspondents compiled with the
request of the department and must not
be taken as anytning more than an at
tempt at approximation of the total feed
ing of wheat from present supoly. The
severity and length of the winter will
necessarily Influence the final findings upon
tnis question. .

Mr. Quay Submits a Xerr Sugar Bill to
the Senate Germany- Seeking Fresh
Means of Retaliation.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, Dec 5. Senator Voor
hees has performed his expected omer
sault. The Statesman who at the last ses
sion of Congress was the champion of the
President and his uncompromising repre
sentative on the floor of the Senate for un
conditional repeal of the purchasing clause
of the Sherman act, the Irreconcilable foe
of all trusts and the ardent tariff reformer,
has turned against the President with the
same furious energy that formerly marked
his zeal. jAt yesterday's caucus Senator
Voorhees astounded even those who
thought they knew him by the violence
with which he denounced the President's
action in issuing bonds and his financial
policy in general. This he followed up with
the statement that It was idle to think
of carrying out any of the President's rec
ommendations in the way of tariff. The
bills for free coal and free iron ore Mr.
Voorhees bluntly characterized aa too un
important to be worth wasting any time
over, and as for the bill to repeal the dif
ferential rate on refined sugar it would
be Impossible to pass that bill without mak
ing all sugar free, and that, Mr. Voorhees
affirmed, the treasury could not afford.
Mr. Voorhee'5 conversion on the sub
ject of silver sfcnee the exhaustion of the
supply of patronage at the White House
is no less radical. Th3 distinguished chair
man of. the finance committee, who, only
eighteen months ago, was the official leader
of the opposition to the friends of the
white metal, is now feverishly awaiting
the opportune moment for the introduc
tion of his free silver bill. He is favorably
impress J with the silver bill Introduced
in the House by Mr. Hartman. of Ore
gon, a feature of whose bill is the pro
vision that all countries which will not
consent to an International adoption of bi
metallism shall pay impjrt duties at the
United States custom houses in gold. It
Is not Impossible that he will incorporate
this idea into his bill. .Indeed, since Mr.
Voorhees has no serious belief that his
bill will ever be. enacted into law it Is
quite likely that he will incorporate in it
all the financial vagaries which he has
supported at' one time or another In his
long political career. Sugar Trust stock
took an upward bound on Wall street to
day when the attitude of Chairman Voor
hees toward the sugar bill became known.
Carlisle's Scheme to Be Pushed.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. An important
conference of most of the Democrats of the
House committee on banking and currency
was held after the adjournment of the
House to-day, as a result of which early
action looking to the reporting of a bank-
ing bill in line with the scheme presented
by Secretary Carlisle in. hia message was

laws of the State of Arkansas. All provisions
of treaties heretofore made by the United
States with the civilized trll -s, except so
far as the treaties relate to land titles, are
abrogated and repealed. and all governments
established by the tribes abolished. The

C.ERMAXY XOT COXTEXT.
May Strike Other Blows nt United
States Products.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6. Germany has
taken the initial step towards curtailing
the importation of another American prod
uct In the proposition now before the
Bundezrath to enormously Increase the
duty on cotton seed oil. The proposition
is to increase the present duty, which Is
tt to $2.50, equivalent to a duty of 230 per
cent., and as the proposition is supported
by the combined agrarian and protectionist
Industrial parties, there can be little doubt
that it will succeed. The subject Is treated
at length In a report to the State Depart
ment by United States Consul Merritt at
Bremen. He says that In future cotton
seed oil and oil nuts and seeds will pay a
high duty. The raising of the duty is sup
ported by the report that its use for fool
purposes rose from 142.01)0 pounds in
1SS3 to over 600,000 pounds In 18?3. By
means of simple processes of refining, cot
ton seed oil can be turned into sweet oil
and is used to a great extent in the man
ufacture of artificial butter and also for
the conservation of fish. "All this means
in good German," says the consul, "that
while pretending to strike at cotton seed
oil, it means to strike oleomargarine. If
officially drugged so as to be unfit for
transformation into food the oil will be ad
mitted at a much lower rate. The result
will be a considerable rise in the price of
the material for the manufacture of oleo
margarine, for, unlike our American mail
uraciurers, the (Jermans nave not succeed
ed in producing the oil from the seed fit
for food purposes. The consul marks the
progress of tnis traffic war in the following
sign.ficant paragraph: "i had hoped to be
able to report that there was a sincere de
sire on the part of the German people, to
join the people of the United States in a
mutual ertort for the extension or the corn
mere of both countries, but the foregoing.
together with the recent edict against
American beef would indicate to a certain
extent a different attitude in this coun
try toward the enlargement of sales of
American products."
It is not Impossible that the German gov
ernment may also take some action hostile
to our cotton interests. In a report to the
State Department coming from a round
about way from ienna. United Mates
consul-general .Max juoa states mat tne
German government has recently sent a
commlfsion to study the cultivation and
manufacture of cotton In the United States.
It is to inquire into: First, methods of cul
tivation and Implements used therefor;
second. Improvements in machinery - for
preparing cotton for markets; third, differ
ence of conditions and cost of production
of cotton before and after the war; fourth.
the quality of cotton before and after 1he
war; fifth, the success of the cotton seed
oil industry and the cost of the produc
tion of cotton and the advantages pos
sessed by the United Mates over England.
New England and Germany in the manu
facture of cotton. The prime object in
view, according to the official report, is to
determine whether the cotton produced In
the United States meets tne needs ot tne
German manufacturer or whether it would
be better to buy all or part of the raw
cotton used in Germany elsewhere.
Gresham nn the German Protest.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. The President to
day sent to Congress the statement of the
German contention in reference to the dis
crimination against the importation in the
United States of German sugar, to which
reference was made in his annual message
to Cpngress. The statement is in form of
a letter from Secretary Gresham to the
President. In . substance this is a recital
of the German protest made Aug. 23 last
against the additional duty of one-tenth of
a cent per pound imposed by the Wilson
act on sugars Imported from bounty-paying
countries. The Secretary refers with some
length to the negotiations between this
country and Great Britain, about ISil, rela
tive to rice importation. In which the United
States then assumed a position, finally con
ceded by Great Britain to be correct, very
similar to that now taken by Germany in
the case of sugar, and In fact the discrim
ination in the present instance is even
more pointedly at variance with
the treaty stipulations. The Secre
tary holds that payment of a bounty
on exported products cannot be considered
in the light of a discrimination; certalivly
not more so than the imposition of a pro
tective or practically prohibitive duty on
the Importation of an article. The two
measures are the same in principle; the
question as to whirh shall be adopted Is
a matter of domestic policy. Each is in
tended to create a national advantage In
production or manufacture, and as between'
the two the bounty is more favorable to
the Inhabitants of foreign eountries, since
It tends to enable them to get cheaper ar
ticles at the expense of the bounty-paying
government, in conclusion the becretary
says that the additional duty levied on
bounty-paying sugar by ,the act of 1834 is a
discrimination, that it is an attempt to
offset a domestic favor or encouragement
to a certain industry by the very means
forbidden by the treaty. He assumes, how
ever, that the German government does
not claim that the treaty (male with Prus
sia in 12S) affords any Jun ground fur
protect against additional duties on sugars
not shown to be the produce or manufac
ture or Prussia.

Representative McGnnn Thinks an
Aiili-Sfrlke 1)111 Will Posh.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Labor Commis
sioner Wright will have a conference to
morrow with Chairman McGann, of the
House committee on labor, .Representative
Springer, author of the pending bill, and
Representative Erdman, who wrote the fa
vorable report -on the bill. They will go
over the question of arbitrating strikes.
with a view to outlining a programme for
immediate action In Congress. Mr. Wright's
experience in the presidential commission,
which recently Investigated the I-ullman
strike, is depended on to give practical form
to the plan of national arbitration. It lias
heretofore been urged theoretically, but the
report of the commission, based on Inquiry
and experience, recommends such federal
arbitration as the surest remedy against
labor agitations and strikes. It was
hoped that President Cleveland, In his mes
sage, 'A-ould give specific approval to the
plan of arbitration recommended by the
strike commission.
Chairman McGann says of the prospects
of passing an arbitration bill this season:
"I think such a bill will go through the
Senate and House without difficulty. There
seems to be a general reeling, without ref
erence to party as to the opportuneness of
such a measure. Under ordinary circum
stances it would be difficult to get throuuh
eucn an important bill at a short session.
but the feeling is so ripe for action that
I expect it to pass both houses. The
Springer bill now reported is almost Identi
cal with the recommendations of the nrei-
dential strike commission. Mr. Wright will
be asked for suggestions to perfect the bill
and then there a- 1 1 1 be a united effort to
secure speedy action on the subject."
Hrlefly, the bill provides for the appoint
ment of a permanent board of arbitration,
consisting of three persons, one of whom
may. In the discretion of the President, be
the commissioner of labor for th time l.e
Ing. The term of their offlce Is fixed at six
years, and their salaries at J5,(XW a year,
and their appointment shall be made by the
President, by and with the auvice and con
sent of the Senate. The arbitration Is se
cured on the petition of one of the parties
to a controversy, and when neither party
asks for it. there is no compulsory arbitra
tion, but on the application of a State Legis
lature the President may tender the offices
of th national commission. The power of
the commlsslcR to settle strikes Is defined
in ths bill as follows: "The said National

LONDON, Dec. 5. Dr. G. Thoumain,
formerly a professor at the American Col--
lege at Marsovan. has received a letter
from an Armenian, now at Constantinople,
giving still further particulars regarding
the Turkish atrocities In Armenia. The
name of the writer Is withheld for pru
dential reasons. The letter relates, ta de
tail, the situation of affairs and lays.th
chief blame upon England, which power,
he says, poses as Armenia's protector. Tht
writer says: "In the neighborhood of
Moosh, the Inhabitants of twenty-five Ar
menian villages have been ruthlessly mas
sacred and their houses have .Seen burned
down and destroyed at the hand of the
Hamldije cavalry, great favorite regiments
of the Sultan. The victims number six
thousand. Besides that the inhabitants of
two or three villages were compelled to
embrace Mohommedanlsm. Alas, it it an
authentic fact, which all the embassies
know well, that all this was done with
the Sultan's knowledge. Two days ago the
Turkish official papers announced 'that the
Sultan had presented new, golden flags to
the Hamldije cavalry. '
The details of the barbarities will prob
ably not be believed in England. But, my

WASHINGTON, Dec 5. The Turkish le

"Towards the end of July last and under

near Moosh formed separate bands, and,
armed with guns, daggers, hatchets and

Iiuieror William.
BERLIN, Dec. 5. Emperor William, wear
ing a British uniform, visited the Prince oC
Wales and the Duke of York this morning,
and the two latter returned his Majesty's
visit an hour later. They then started for
England. After the departure of the Prince
of Wales and the Duke of York Emperor
William donned a Prussian uniform and
prepared to open the Rtichstag. The Radi
cals are furious that the monarch does not
come to the Parliament, but that, instead,
his Majesty must go to the ctle for th
ceremony. This course of his Majesty, says
the Frelsinnige Zeltung, shows how modest
a part parliamentarism holds In Germny.
The session of the Reichstag was opened at
noon in the Rlttersaal of the castle In
stead of in the usual White Hall, which is
being renovated. Emperor William in per
son read his speech from the throne. It
follows:
"Honorabla Gentlemen In the name of
