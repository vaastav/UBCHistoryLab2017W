Porter'i Apolof r to the President?
An Abject Letter.
A day or two ago we presented the text
of Admiral Porter's letter to Secretary
Wbli.ks, reflecting severely on General
Giunt, in connection with the Fort
Fisher expedition. Nothing has happened
in official circles for a long time to
create such a buzz. Ever since Grant
has become President Foutf.ii has been on
the most intimate terms of friendship
with him. Bo long as Mr. llouts was
Secretary of the Nary, Porteii was the
virtual and Bonis only the nominnl Secretary,
and evidently had the entire confidence
of the President After Farrag ct
died, Grant appointed Porter to the
rank of Admiral thus made vacant. The
appointment being made Id vacation, it
lias not yet been confirmed, nor
sent in to the Senate for confirmation.
This unfortunate letter has
been brought out just in time to blast the
Vice Admiral's prospects, for it would be
a little too much to expect ol human nature
tliat Grant should now nedd Porter's
nomination to the Senate, though it
would bo creditable to his magnanimity to
Jo it,ami he may doso. If he should, the
i/vinant in llial llin flnnillll WAIlllI PttSlt/tf
|fimjnvinuih?miw .. vui.i
Lhc' nomination; and then again It It
Itiglily probable tho rank "will 'sooii be
abolished by act of Congresr. It in evident,
therefore, that PonTKn Is done for.
If lie took 111* mortification like a man,
we could teel some sympathy for bU misfortune,
hut a man "who could make Bo
abject an apology as the following, deserves
only the ridicule it lias brought
upon him:
Washington, Dec. 3,1870.
Mn. 1'iikhidknt : My first impulse 011
readme the letter published in The Mew
Yurk world wiis to go to you at once and
pronounce it a fabrication, lor as such I
considered it; but. as it purported to have
been written six years ago, and published
by a person who once held a prominent
position under tlie Government, I determined
to ascertain fully if I had ever indited
such a letter before addressing you
on the subject. Neither myself nor my
secretary, who has served with me eight
years, could recall to our recollection any
circumstances of the kind. I could not
conceive Uiat I liad uttered sentiments I
know 1 never felt, and which are so at varlanco
with those' that 1 liavu uniformly
expressed toward you. The letter, it appears,
was u privuto one; and vindictive
must have been the heart of the man that
could be guilty of so grave a breach of
conlidence; and depraved indeed must be
the characlcr who, to gratify his mischievous
instincts, could make public a confidential
letter, written, perhaps, under
great excitement, and at this distant day
not even remembered. It sceuis like a
poor return foryour uniform confidence
and kindness to ine; and I am too glad that
I remember nothing conncctcd with the
letter.
At about the date of the letter I had
passed through a long and tntigulug contest
with Fort Fisher, mid my numerous
Heel was almost overpowered by the elements.
I saw tho coveted prize within
my grasp and then slip from me. For
auotlicr month I had to battle with the
storms ol Winter, anchored on an open
coast, with the responsibility ol that large
licet on my hands, and my mind and
body harassed by extraordinary fatigues.
The wliolo nation was looking on cxcited,
dreading a defeat that might prolong a
contest that was already sapping its vitals.
You and others know what I bad to undergo
bodily and mentally. I presume it
was while under this excitement that 1
wrote the letter which, you say, has made
you lose your faith in human nature. 1
have no recollection of It liny more than
I would have of other passing circumstances
of tlx yearn, ago.. When several
persons have at different times informed
me that a letter would bo published in
which 1 had abused Qenerai Grant,
I imoimI tho mnttpr wilfi indiffer
ence, thinking It Impossible that such
11 letter could exist I do not write
for the purpose of exonerating myself,
for I would rather be the writer of the
letter than its publisher. The peace of
political parties and of society would he
placed In great jeopardy if all the private
letters written the last six years were published.
Nothing that I hare said will
affect your fuir fame, and your many
friends would be sadly wanting in Judgment
if they wertat all Influenced by the
silly exultations ot a few unscrupulous
persons who, after all, arc only rejoicing
over the most contemptible breach' of
confidence I ever hoard ot. { ?
I regret exceedingly the loss of your
friendship, and do not hesitate to disapfrove
the sentiments of which, I suppose,
must bear the odium. They appear in
a letter of which I have no recollection.
They are so different from the sentiments
I always express toward yourself and the
gallant officers of our army, and arc so inconsistent
with all my antecedents, that I
scarcely consider them entitled to a moment's
thought >>
I have tho honor to remain, very pespectfully,
your obedient servant,
David D. Pobtbb, Admiral.
'To thcrPrcsident ' '1
A Washington correspondent of the
Hatton 1UI relates the scene; that occurred
when Admiral Porter met the President
after the publication of his Welles letter.
Tho President was surrounded by his
Secretaries, and ex-Secretary Boric was
also present. At tho Admiral's entrance
the President laid down the letter, and
expressed his disbelief in its authenticity.
"I don't think the Admiral wrote it; but
if so, the assertions are unwarranted."
Admiral Porter approached the President,
was received cordially by him, and said:
"Mr. President, you have rod that letter,
I suppose?" An affirniativo answer was
given, when the Admiral continued:
"Well, I don't know whether I wroto it or
not, but if I did it must have been tinder
circumstances that any officer, with 140
vessels under his command, and with
many difficulties to. encounter, would
have written. I will not be surprised at
your being angry. However, it will not
change my personal friendship for you,
let your course be what it may.
The President was greatly surprised at
the Admiral's virtual acknowlcdment
Ex-Secretary Borio Is a warm friend of
Porter, and urged him to sign and publish
a disclaimer at once. Tho Admiral declined
to do bo, and vaguely asserted that
Gov. Ilawloy and ex-Becretary Welles
woro responsible for tho mlwliicf. .
In conversation with frlen'da the Admiral
waa still moro depreciating?even
stigmatizing the latter as "a d?dbad letter,
although I wrote if myself." "But
believe me," be continued ingenuously,
this has made me Grant's friend forever,
let come of it what will." In addition to
this severe repentance, tbe Admiral adds
modest abnegation, lie docs not core for
the place ol Admiral, would be even content
to leave tbe Navy, thereby aiding bis
own'interests more than he can in tbe
Navy.
The Admission of Georgia.
Washington, Dec. 0,1870.
The admission of Georgia is creatine
considerable interest here, inasmuch as
nothing more is required but to admit the
Senators and Representatives to their
seals. Seuator elect Farrow, whose term
expires in 1878, is quietly awaiting Congressional
action, and thinks the Stale
ought to be admitted at an early day prior
to the election which 'takes placc on tbe
32d ol this month. Mr. Wbitely, who
was elected Senator lor the short term, expiring
on the 4th of march next, is not
here, but is at homo canvassing for election
to the House of Representatives, for
which lib is a candidate. Should the
State be admitted, and be bo elected a
Representative to the Forty-second Conf;rcss,
he will probably return here to till
lis placc In the Senate alter the Christmas
holidays. The contest between
Messrs. Farrow and Whitely, and Gov.
Hill and Mr. Miller, will require settlement
by the Scnalo before either are admitted.
liill and Miller, it will be remembered,
were elected by the Legislature
of 18(18, but Congress, by spccial act,
declared this Legislature revolutionary,
and its acts nut bhiding upon tbu Federal
Government. This was in consequence
of alleged usurpation by disqualillcd mem
oers, Willi mumimneu wicir acuta m iium'
lation (il Uic law, expelling colored members,
and upon this' question of the eligibility
or these Senators depends the Issue.
If Congress maintains its original
decision, then Hill nnil Miller will not he
recognized, and Farrow and Whitely will
he admitted. The Georgia Stale Senate
isdn session only for the purpose of confirming
or rejecting Governor Bullock's
nominations for Commissioners of Election,
and the Assembly to be elected does
not meet until November next The
question of Foster Iilodgctt's eligibility
lor United Slates Senator lor the six vents
commencing on the fourth of next March
is agitating the public mind, particularly
as the friends of Attorney General Akcrman
are pressing him for the position.
They bold that Mr. Blodgett's election
wa? void, j because It was not had lnecenrflanefc
with the Ihw of Cdhgi'ess providing
for election of Senators, no vacancy
existing nt the time legally
warraijliog tbs election1 ol anybody
nt the time it was consummated.?
If thisr*.-position , bo, correct, and the
Republicans carry tho State, tlio con1
test will be again made, but this time between
Mr. Blodgctt and Mr. Akermnn.
Governor Bullocfc will throw Ills entire
weight and ofllcial patronage lor Mr.
Illodgett, and those who claim to know
assert that lie would prefer any other Republican
to Mr. Akcrman. This will necessarily
create a conflict between PresideHt
'Grant and Governor Bullock, and
the Issue will bo determined upon Federal
as against State patronagu. The contest
now belnre the Senate, between Miller,
and mil, and Farrow, and Whitely
will be referred to tho Judiciary Committee
at an early day, and elaborato legal
arguments will be presented. Tho Republicans
here assert that they will certainly
carry four out of tho seven Georgia districts,
and perhaps live. The military Is
only to be used to assist the civil officers

Republican Senatorial Caucus-?Scburz
and Trumbull in Attendance.
' ,
('nr. Cin. Commercial.
Washington, December 0,1870.
Tho Republican Senators met in caucus
to day, and appointed a committee to re- ,
port at a future meeting on tho subject of
revising the Senate committees. The session
lasted nearly an hour, and an interesting
discussion nrose on a resolution in- traduced
by Senator Cameron, providing
for the appointment ol a committee to inquire
whether liny action was accessary
to promote the interests of the Republican
pnrty. Tho resolution is understood to
have reference to the disaffection of several
Senators, their personal misunderstandings,
their coolness towards the President,
and their want rtf tcalty to the'party. It
was supposed to have particular reference
to llie New York Senators, and the SenaInM

the resoiiitloii, on tlic ground tlifit It was
unnecessary, nnd bo counseled harmony
nnd reconciliation in a quiet manner,
without paradu or show. Trumbull also
opposed it us mischievous. Sumner rather
favored it Cameron advocated it strongly.
The .resolution was llnolly laid over
tor iuture action, and it is thought the
next caucus will lie an exciting one on
this subjcct.
Cor. (Hn. JCuqitirtr. ; | .f j : j j/.
The caucus of Republican Senators held
to day did not propose, as had been antic!patetf
In some quarters, to change tho organization
of tlio Senate, but pimply con.
tented itself with tlie' arrangement ot {he
com mittces for the present session. What
little doubt existed as to; the status of

ttle surpripo expressed, ajter what some
newspajiers had said, that he should be so
early on Jumd. Mr.jjtmrr .said that, in
reply, he must congrntulato Mr. Conkling
on trio 1 litter's eflbrta'to carry New York.
Mr.Coltax soon came in, and, with a
smile, also congratulated Sclinra on the
result ofhls labor in Missouri; whereupon
tlie Vice President was-as quickly concfatillated
on 'the result In "Indiana.
Neither Mrj Trumbull nor Mr, Schurz
will be disturbed In their posluon* on tbc
Senate Committee.
A RTHONO reason why Congress will
not rc|>eal the law organizing tho term of
tho 4th ol March, is given by an officer of
the House who has to do with the payment
of members, who says , that with a
Speaker elected to sign warrants, for pay
and mileage, members could get their
compensation monthly; bat, with the
House unorganized, they would have to
wait nlno months before they could draw
a cent

General Mahone gets only: |25,000 salary
as President ol various consolidated railroads

will be more united than heretofore,
as tho late elections have taught tii em that
they cannot "divide and conquer."

Johnson is neither a Republican nor a
