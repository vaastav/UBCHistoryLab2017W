ItKVISlO.N (If I'liNSION I.AWS.
I am thoroughly convinced that, our general
pension laws should be revised and adjusted to
meet as ar as possible, in the light ot our ex
perience, all menlorious cast's. The fact that
104 difterent rales of pensions are paid cannot,
in my opinion, be made consistent with justice
to the pensioners or to the government,and the
numerous private pension bills that are passed
predicated 111 on the imperfection ot general
laws, while they increase
111
many cuses exist­
ing in quality and injustice lend additional
force, to the recommendation for
11
re\lsiou of
the general laws on this nubject.
The laxity of ideas prevailing among a large
number of our people regarding pensions is be
coming every day more marked. The princi
ples upon which they should be granted are in
danger of being altogether ignored, and (I al
ready pensions are olten claimed because the
•applicants are as much entitled as other suc
cessful applicants, rather than upon
any disability reasonably attrib
utable to military service. If
the establishment of various precedents be
continued: if the granting of pensions be not
divorced from partisan and other unworthy
and irrevelant considerations, and if the hon
orable name of veteran unfairly becomes by
these means but another term for one who
constantly clamors for the aid of the govern
ment, there is danger that Injury will be done
to the fume and patriotism of many whom our
citizens all delight to honor, and that a preju
dice will be aroused unjust to meritorious ap
plicants for pensions.

Favorable reference is made to the diffusion
process in making sugar from sorgham and

The president counsels early attention to the

WASHINGTON, Dec. S.—At the conclusion
of the reading of the president's message
today the democrats heartily endorsed it,
•while t-ho republicans could not iind any
thing good to i.y in its behalf. A few of
the expressions obtained are piven below .-
Mr. Hoar—It embodies the utterances of a
disappointed politician.
Mr. Sherman—There is nothing striking
about it.
Mr. Cullom—Of necessity he dies game 011
his tariff views, and in his reference to internal
affairs runs into a great scold.
Mr. Krye—The only part of the communica
Tfcfion which interested me was that referring to
the fisheries question. I am now trying to
solve the problem therein, namely: The pres.
ident states that there has been nothing
of moment occurring on that subject since
March last. Why, then, does ho severely crit
icize us for not passing retaliatory legisla
tion?
Mr. anderson—I was not particularly struck
with what I heard of the message. If Mr.
Cleveland will visit the Northwest, he will lini}
that our farmers do not indorse his utterances
on the tariff question.
Mr. Cockrell—Generally speaking, it im
pressed mo very favorably.
Mr. Kansom—I think it was like all of Mr.
Cleveland's public communications have been,
a very able and concisely framed instrument.
Mr. Teller—I think that the tirst part of the
message is full of spleen.

drop into the democratic ranks, but they bore
the chaffing manfully. They come loaded with

as opportunity oilers.

Murdered Pioneers.
On a recent beautiful day, which seemed
as though made purposely for the occa
sion, the transfer .ook place of the bodies
of four pioneers from the graves where
they were laid together aft»r being mur
dered by 2nd ans, in 1870, to the permanent
resting place provided by Rapid City. It
rked an epoch in the town's history. In
1876, when the residents of the hamlet
turned their faces homeward after paying
humanity's poor tribute to the dead men,
they numbered in all nineteen, and nearly
that man}- hundred followed the bones of
tho pionoers to Evergreen Cjmetery. The
exercise? at Library Hall were very im
pressive. The address bv R. B. Hughes,
mself a '7(i-cr, was au eloquent tribute to
the mem iry of tho men who had given
tho'r lives in making that a habitable
region. Tne pall-bearers on the occasion
were all pioneers, many of the or gitial
nineteen being among them. To these
men there was a marked change in tha
surroundings as contracted with those of
a dozen years ago, and the patriotic citi
zen hopes that another dozen years shall
see agnin as great change in proportion as
has the last.

FARM AND FIRESIDE.
—The best selling pork is generally
that grown in eight months, and this,
too, is the pork made at the least cost.
—The digestive systems of a cow and
horse are quite dissimilar, and the
bulky food should be given the cow.—
The Farmer.
—In reference to the contamination
of wells by soakage or filtering through
the earth—the well draws toward tho
bottom, not the top.
—Good food and warm stables will
run the cow machine well through tho
winter. Lack of fuel will stop it mighty
quick.—Farm Journal.
—After buttering the tin for a boiled
pudding, dust it with powdered bread
crumbs baking pans can be treated
with flour in the same way and tho
cake will never stick.
—Most farmers greatly underesti
mate the value of a coat of paint on
their farm implements. These tools aro
a great item of expense and ought to
be taken good care of. Exposure to
the weather is more destructive to
them than the wear they get.
—Spiced Veal: Three pounds veal
chopped fine, two eggs, small lump
butter, three rolled soda crackers
two or three to i.spoonfuls of salt, one
tea-spoonful pepper, half teaspoonful
cloves, two or three tablespoonfuls
milk. Form into loaf and bake. To
be eaten cold.
—More diseases among fowls than
many imagine are directly due to the
presence of lice, which, by sapping1
the vitality of the fowl, and by caus
ing irritation and uneasiness, render
the system easily susceptible to the
germs of disease. Good health is the
best preventive of disease, and good
health is largely dependent upon free
dom from vermin.
—To Freshen Codfish Quickly: Pick
it up quite line, wash it, and then scald
it in throe waters, draining it off
through a colander, so that the parti
cles of salt will not be left in the dish.
Mackerel should be laid with tha skin
upward, in a colander, when It is
freshened. A little thought about such
things does wonders.—Housewife.
—Parsley may bo had all winter, and
at the same time make a handsome or
nament for the kitchen. Make a box
to fit the wiudow sill, and about six
inches wide. Take up good roots from
the garden and cut back the old leaves,
but do not injure tha central bud or
growing point shorteu the roots to a
convenient length, and plant quite
closely in tho box. The new growth
will soon start and produce a hand
some mass of verdure. —American Ag
riculturist.
—Nowadays there are many sugges
flons in the papers as to saving seeds,
but this is not always advisable. Do
not attempt to save your own seeds un
less you have used every precaution
accessary to prevent cross-fertilization,
says a practical gardener. Plants often
mix without the knowledge of tha
grower. A melon may be fertilized by
a pumpkin and the fruit of this season
may be apparently genuine, yet the
seeds of such, if used next season, may
cause failure of tho crop or else destroy
the quality.
NEED OF GROOMING.
The Only Way in Which a ITor^e Can He
Kept
til
Good Condition.
No man can groom a horse intelli
gently unless he has a correct idea of
the purposes of grooming And tho
characteristics of the skin. We havo
seen people dig into the skin of a horse
with a sharp curry-comb as if they
were smoothing down a stone, and tho
pitiable cringing of the animal has 110
effect in getting the fact into the mind
that the horse was being hurt. Tho
skin is to be reached, for one of tho
chief purposes of the operation is to
cleanse the skin—remove the dirt and
collections that have gathered on it.
In one sense, when the skin is covered
with dirt and the dried excretions that
have come through the pores, it is like
a head covered with dandruff, and
those who have had an experience of
that kind know how much discomfort
thero is in it. The pores of the skin
become clogged, and they can not,
while in this condition, fully perform
their functions. Their importance is
so well understood that some have even
gone so far as to recommend tha
Turkish bath for the horse, and wo
honestly believe that it would often
prove valuable.
The skin is, therefore, to be distinctly
and effectively reached by the curry
comb. that it may do all it can do in
removing from the surface whatever
may irritate the skin or clog the pores.
The pores can not be fully cleaned by
the curry-comb, but they can be par
tially cleansed by it. But while it is
necessary to "scratch" the skin, it
must be gently done. The hor«e should
never be made to cringe under the pro
cess of grooming. Of late years combs
have been manufactured that do not
harm the skin, and some of them are
valuable. It need not be said that farm
horses are often neglected in this re
spect. Frequently it is the result of
the hurry in our work. But suppose
the trotting horse should be thus neg
lected. If it could be with impunity,
certainly the owner would not go to
the expense that he incurs for having
the animal thoroughly groomed. It is
th® only way that the trotting horse
can be kept in good condition. But tho
work horse ha,s the same sort of organ*
ism that the trotting horse has. and
what is good for one is good for the
other. The truth is that if we paid
more attrition to groomiag we could
feed less, and our horjes would be much
less liable to disease. Time spent in
performing these "little things" on the
farm is usually well spent.— Ilcit-i.r'j

BRASS is an allov of copper and zinc, made
by plunging copper in slips into melted zinc
in a crucible. The former metal rapidly
combines with the fluid mass, and the addi

mainder of the copper is at once added. The
brass thus formed is broken into pieces and
I'emelted in a crucible over a charcoal fire,
and a proper addition of either zinc or cop
per made to bring it up to the color and
quality desired. It is then poured into gran
ite molds. The addition of tin gives it hard
ness and grain, aud lead toughens and ren
ders it fitter for working. Anoiher method
for making small quantities of brass is to
melt the copper and zinc iu separate cruci
bles, and then pour them together, stirring
vigorously until thoroughly combined. Of
course it will be necessary to add a flux to
Vho copper to aid ID tho fusion.
