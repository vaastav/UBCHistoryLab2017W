i CORIORATIOXS
I am In no sense hostile to corpora
tions This Is an age of combination
and any effort to prevent all combina
lion will be not only nteleee but In the
end vldoiu because of the contempt t
for law which the failure to auto rnn I
law Inevitably produces The corpora
tion has come to stay just aa the
trade union baa come to stay Each I
cn do and haa done great good Each I
thonld be favored so long as it does
good But each should bo sharply
checked where it acts against law and I
justiceExperience
Experience has shown conclusively
that it II nseleaa to try to get any sole
quote regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by State ac
tion Snob regulation and supervision I
can only bo effectively exercised by H I
sovereign whose jurisdiction la toes
onexr
poration that la l by the National Gov
ernment I believe that this regulation I
and supervision can bo obtained by the I
Ienactmont I of law by the congress If
this proves Impossible It will certainly
n
be necessary ultimately to confer In I
fullest form such power upon the na
tional government by Hnirmntlve ao
meet of the constitution
EMPLOYERS LI A Hi LIT Y LAW
In my annual memage to the FlrtyI I
eighth oongrres at ILl second wMiou I
IIreoommendtod
reoommendttd the passage of an em I 1
ployers liability law for the District of I
Columbia and In our navy yards I re
newed that rroomendatlon In my t
message to the Fittyelgth congrew at 1
Its second lellIIIOn and further suggest I
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of toI I t
lployenUabl1lty with a view to the enII I
actment of R wise and constitutional
law covering the subject applicable t o
all Industries within the scope of the
federal power I hope that snob a law
will be prepared and enacted as speed
ily as possible
There has been demand for depriving
courts of the power to issue injunctions I
in labor disputes Such special limits
tlon of the equity powers of our courts
would be most unwise It Is true that t
some judges have misused this power
but this does not justify a denial of the I
power any more than an Improper theI I
ercise of the power to call a strike by a
labor leader would justify the denial of
the right to strike The remedy is ofI I
regulate the procedure by requiring the I
judges to give dun notice to the adverse I
parties before granting the writ the
hearing to ta ex pate if the adverse 1
party does not appear at the tttne un < l I
place ordered IINSURANCE I
INSURANCE
ITbe great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations I
whose business has extended ao far
sbeyond the jurisdiction of the state I
precluded d I
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states In my
last annual message I recomended
that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
lone In Insurance Recent events
have emphasized the importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
this question to see whether it Is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been able
to furnish agalurt jjorrnptlon of the
flagrant kind which has been expo ed
It has beeu only too densely shown
that certain of the men at the head of
these largo corporations take bnt small
note of the ethical distinction between
honesty and dishonesty They draw
the line only this side of what may be
called Uw honettty the kind of honesty
necessary in order to avoid falling into
the clntches of the law Of course the
only complete remedy for this condi
tion must be found in an arousad pub
lic conscience a higher sense of ethical I
conduct in the community at large and I
especially among business men and in I
the great profession of the law and In I
the growth or a spirit which condemns I
all dishonesty whether in rich man or
In poor man whether it take the shape I
of bribery or of blackmail
ECONOMY IN EXPENDITURES
Eirnesty recommend to the con
grew the need of economy and to this I
end of a rigid scrntinyof appropria
tone All nnecessary offices should i
be abolished In the public printing
also a large saving of money can be
made There is a constantly growing I
tendency to public masses of nnlm
portant information at which no human I
nobumanII II
being ever looks
Yet in speaking of economy I mar t I
in nowise be understood as advocating
the false economy which is in the end
the wont extravagance To cut down I
in the navy would be a crime against
the nation To fall to push forward all I
work on the Panama canal would be as I
1greats folly yyt
CURRENCY
ICURRENCY
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to onr currency system The I
evil does not consist in an inadequate
volume of money but in the rigidity
of this volume which does not respond I I
as it should to the varying needs of
communities and of seasons Inflation
must be avoided but some provision
should be made that will insure a
larger volume of money during the fall
and winter months than In the less ac
tive season of the year so that the
curency will contract against specula
tion and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business At the present the
treasury department is at irregularly
recurring lntervals obliged In the Inter
est of the business worldthat is in
tins interests of tha American public
to try to avert financial crises by pro
viding a remedy which should be pro
vided by congressional action
FEDERAL ELECTION
In my las annual message I said
The power of the government to
protect the Integrity of the elections of
Its own officials Is inherent and has
bee recognized and affirmed by re
posted declaration of the supreme
court There Is no enemy of free gov
ernment more dangerous and none so
Inaldons as the corruption of the elect
Ions The details of such a law maybe
I
be safely left to the wise discretion of I I
the congress but it should go as far
under the constitution as it Is possible to
go and should include a severe penalltles
against him who gives or receives a
bribe intended to influence hilt act or
opinion as an elector and provisions for
5the publication not only of the expend I
itures for nominations and elections of
all candidates but also of all contrib i
tions received and expenditures made
by political coinmlteea1 <
I I desire to repeat this recommenda I k
lion
j i All contributions by corporations to
I 1 any political committee or for any po
1 Htlcal purpose should not be permitted
to use stockholders money for snob
purposes and moreover a prohibition
of this kind would be as far as it t
went an effective method of stopping
the evils aimed ut In corrupt practices
ARMY AND NAVY
I do not believe that any army In the
world bee a better average of enlisted
men or a better type of junior officers <
but the army should be trained to act
effectively in a mass Provision should
be made by sufficient appropriations
for maneuvers of a practical kind
Provision should be made for the pro
motion of exceptionally meritorious
men over the heads of their comrades
and for the retirement of all men who
have reached a given ego without get
ting beyond a given rankj j
ADMISSION TO STATEHOOD
