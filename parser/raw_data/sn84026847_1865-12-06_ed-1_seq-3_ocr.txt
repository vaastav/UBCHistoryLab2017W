Mr. H*ll
Chahlkstown, W. Va. J
Novtunlwr 88, 1866. 4
Hon E. B Hall? Sir? I hereby notify
you that I will contest your right to l?o
commissioned nud hold the office of
Judge of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in the
State of West Virginia, for the following
reasons :
Iht.? That at the election held ou the
2r>tli day of October last, I received a ma
jority of all the votes legally east for
Judge of the said 10th Judicial Circuit.
2ud. ? That the said election was held
t?> till the unexpired term canned by my
removal by the Legislature, and that I
was commissioned by the Governor of
West Virgiuia as Judge of the 1 0th Cir
cuit in said State, which commission re
cites the counties composing said Circuit
and that Jefferson aud Berkeley counties
are not named in said commission.
3rd. ? That the said counties of Jefler
ton and Berkeley are not, constitutionally
a part of the 10th Circuit.
4th ?That the Legislature had uo au
thority from the constitution to add said
counties to that circuit, but that they
were expressly declared to be a part of
another circuit known as the 11th Judi
cial Circuit.
f>th. ? That it the aforesaid couut ies are
a part ot the 10th Judicial Circuit, I re
ceived a majority of all the votes legally
cast at said election ,
?itb. ? That by the Constitution of the
State ot West Virginia "the white male
citizens of the State thall be entitled to
cote at all elections held within the elec
tion districts in which they respectively
reside ; but no person who is a minor or
of unsound mind, or a pauper, or who is
under conviction of treason, telony, or
bribery in an election, or who has not
been a resident of the State for one year,
and of the eounty in which he offers to
vote for thirty days uext preceding such
otter, shall be permitted to vote while
such disability continues." That citizens
of this State are citizens of the Uuitcd
States residing therein. Article 1st, Sea,
t?. Con.
That by the act of see. 24, page
liy, the supervisors and inspectors at
< -eery ( lection shall permit all persons to
vote, according to the 1st section of the
Urd article of 1 he Constitution, and this
law has never been repealel, and is still
the law of the State; but that notwith
standing the Constitution aud the law
thus imperatively declares who shall be
entitled to the lights of suffrage, you,
then being Attorney General of the State,
and at the same time a candidate for the
office of Judge iu the said circuit at said
election, did pr< nounce your opinion iu
writing, publish it, and have it circulat
ed throughout the entire circuit, (backed
by a proclamation from the Governor,
declaring said opiuion to be bimling in
the abseuceof auy decision by the Court
of Appeals,) in which said opiniou you,
as Attorney General, pronouneo a law
passed at the last session of the leg:sla
tnre known as "the Test Oath Law," to
lie constitutional, and that the supervi
sors aud inspectors of elections were
bou u (I to execute it. i
I therefore charge that this was an itn
proper, and, under the eiroaustonoes, an
unjustifiable attempt to influence the su- I
penrtson and inspectors of elect ion, to
(.?boy a law in direct violation oft ho Con
stitution they wore sworn to support. ? I
That it did so induence many of said *u- I
per visors and inspectors, and caused I
them to reject luuny le^al votes ? prob- I
ably mpre than two thousand in this
circuit. That it disfranchised many vo- 1
ters who eould fairly take said oath, but I
who would not do so because they deem- 1
ed this test oath an unconstitutional law I
and one which tho legislature had no
right to enact.
7th. ? That the vote of Jefteruon coun- 1
ty was cast for me by a majority of 151
votes. Seo inspectors returns of said I
county.
8th. ? That a portion of the Board of
Supervisors of said county, without au I
thority of law, threw out and refused to I
count the eutire vote of Cliarlestown
township, numbering in all 267 votes, of
which 265 were cast tor me.
'.Hit, ? That one of said supervisors, Mr.
Daniel Cameron, served as a volunteer in 1
tlio rebel army, 2nd Virginia Regiment,
Stonewall Brigade; ami that another,
Mr. Pottertield, was a deputy Sheriff for
Mr. Rush, who was defeated before the
people for Sheriff, and therefore directly I
interested in throwing out and refusing
to count tho vote of said township. Aud
that Mr. Rush was thus declared elected
Sheriff of sajd conuty.
10th. ? The said Board threw out and
refused to count many ballots cast for
me which were printed on colored paper,
contiary to the provisions of the Consti
tution. which, while it. prescribes *hat
tho vote shall ho by ballot, does not pro
scribe its color.
11th ? That at Chapline and Shepherd
townships in said county about 100 voters
more or less, who offered to vote for mo
were rejected by the inspectors, and al- 1
though they were requested by said vo
ters to record their names upon the re
jected list required to be kept by the act
of 1^63, said inspectors refused to record
them, saying "they meant to have uo af
ter claps." I charge and am prepared
to prove .hat about 100 other voters who
would have voted for mo, were thus de
terred from exercising their l ight of suf
frage. A list of those whose ballots was
refused entry upon the rejected list is
filed herewith marked "exhibit A," and
made part of this notice. I shall contend
fh.it these votes must he counted, or that
the election held at these two precincts,
in consequenco of said refusal of the in
spectors, is a nullity, and should not be
conn ted in ascertaining the general re
sult.
12th. ? That at Averill township, in
said county, do votes were cast for mo,
and placed upon the rejected list, which
were not counted for me by the said in
jectors of election.
13th. ? That in the county of Berkeley
thoelection in several of the townships
was conducted amidst seenes ot great
personal violence to those "vho sought to
exercise the right to vote for me aud
against you False representations had
been made to (teneral Kmory by persons
holding office in that county, and who
favored your election, such as induced
that officer to send troops to Martius
btug, and, I believe, otner portions ot
said county. That these troops were
placed by that officer under tho control
of Mr. Pitzer, the high fcherifi, who, in
order to assist you and tho party to
which you belong? contrary to the ex
press orders of General Emory, used
them for the purpose of arresting Mr.
Pendleton and others who had been al
ways loyal to the government ot the
United States; and who, contrary to the
Constitution aud laws of the country,
placed them directly at the voting places.
That, after this was done, every man,
who was supposed to favor my election
was challenged, and, if he refused to
take the T^t Oath, his ballot was reject
ed, and, so far as I can learn, uo list was
kept of his name, when persons who fa
vored your election, whether loyal or
not, were permitted to vote unchalleng
ed.
That at live of the voting places in
said county, I am informed aud believe
that, no rejected list of voters was kept,
although the voters requested the in
spectors to record their names and bal
lots according to law.
That at Hedgesvflle, in said connty,
the ballots cast for me, were taken, after
the electiou wto ww| by parsons inter
ested in ray defeat, and burnt in the pub
lic auiidst the cheers of the ex
cited populace. I shall contend, there
tore, that, the election held in said county
on the 26th day of October last wiw.nnder
the circumstances well calculated to de
ter the loyal voters of the county from
exercising the right of suffrage; and
that it did deter mauv snch from goiog
forward to vote. That said electiou waa
held iu utter coutempt and violatiou ot
the Constitution and the law, aud should
be declared a nullity, and the returns
not conuted iu the general result.
14th ? That in Hardy county I receiv
ed a large majority of the votes cast
supposed to be between 150 and 200 ma
jority. That Abijah Dolly, Rhinehart,
and Muntzing, declared that they were
the authorised parties to whom the in
spectors of election should make their
returns. That these men were all can
didates for office at that election on the
ticket opposed to me. That said returns
in said county were, tnsde to these afore
said parties. That said returns were as
certained by them upon inspection to be
in my favor, and that they were all de
feated before the people. That they took
said poll books and ballots, and went
with them to Wheeling, or some other
place, aud, aftor consulting with you as
to the legality ol throwing out certain
eutire polls, returned to said county aud
held a meeting of the supervisors ? who,
I learn, were only elected at that elec
tion? at Moojetield. No quorum being
present, they adjourned to meet at some
point miles away tro'm the Court
house, and there finding a quorum, thro w
out aud refused to count the votes of six
entire townships, to-wit: Beans. Har
pers, Mathias, Brakes, Bark d all's Mills,
aud Petersburg. That, at Kitzuiiller's,
poll books were deposited and notice giv
en for tke election. When the people as
sembled, they were informed that the
poll books had been taken away by the
order of Mr. Dolly. I claim, therefore,
and shall contend that the Board of Su
pervisors ? especially those elected only
at the last election, on the 26tli of Octo
ber, 1865? at that and no other county
have by law no powor to throw out aud
refuse to count the votes, of any town
ship, and that they are uot by law the
judges of the returns aud qualifications
of any hut township aud county offi
cers.
15th.? I charge that the supervisors in
Morgan couuty, threw out and re/used
to count the votes ot two entire town
ships, called, I think, Timber Kidge aud
Rock Gap, which cast their votes by con
siderable majorities for me.
By the illegal actiou ot theso Boards
you have received majorities in the coun
ties of Jefferson and Hardy. You have
been declared elected by the Governor of
the State, notwithstanding some of these
facts were represented to him by my
counsel. It is charitable to suppose that
he did not investigate the matter fully,
perhaps not at all.
In conclusion, I do not hesitate to say
and charge that your election has been
effected by frauds most wholesale and
palpable, and violence such as uover be
fore disgraced this or any other Cir
cuit.

that tho Liberals are daily' gaining

of the States of Souoro, Sinoloa, Chihua

Profitable Transaction.? Mr. Mar
shal O. Roberts, a powerfully loyal man
in Now York, had a ship called the' Il
linois which ho wanted to sell to the gov
ernment Three successive commissions
were appointed to consider the propriety
of purchasing the ship and each commis
sion pronounced the vessel worthless
and recommended (that it, should not be
purchased Mr Roberts made personal
application to President Lincoln about
the matter and tho vessel was bought
for tho government, Mr. Roberts receiv
ing ^KkUHX). The vessel never was used
during the war. A few days|sgo a com
mittee under orders from the secretary of
the navy appraised the Illinois at $50 ?
UCH? and ottered her for sale at auction. ?
The highest bidder was a dealer in old
iron wiio offered $35,000 for hoi. Roberts
in, of course, "an honorable man."
Still at Lakok. ? Cincinnati hits been
considerably disgusted by the recent ex

Recently ho wad threatened with expo

Iron Railroad Cars ? In view dT the
alarming frequency of fatal railroad ac
cidents, the construction of passenger
cars of boiler iron has been sugge?t
etl. It is proposed to make them oval in
shape, so that one utay not be driven in
to another, sod it is thought that the
breaking of tracks which Mb tiiroogh
the floors of wooden cars will not do
mora than make a dent in the iron.
Whining to Lkgisi.ativk "Borkrs."
? It has been recently decided by the
Supreme Court of Rhode Island that con*
tracts made for services rendered in pro
curing the passage of lawn for iudiyidual
beuefft, of fofr worm ing YoKtfa^Mironi
dublic officers, are contrary to public
policy and therefore void. This strikes
at the root of the ''lobbying" and "go.
between business which has been so
proti table to a dishonest Bet of politi
cians and so detrimental to the interests
of the pnblic at large.
U, S. Tklkgraph.? The Western ex
tension of wires of the United States
Telegraph Company has reached St. Jo

ThrBbpublicax Ii>ea ? The rotunda
ot the capital hua been lately adorned
with a 'very fair life-like portrait of
Lieutenant General Grant, and within a
day or two a very unlike picture of
President Lincoln has b? en suspended
over the door leading toward the Senate
Chamber. This is not so much a memen
to of the "martyr ' as a constant remind
er to Senators, Representative^ and to
whom it may concern, that Andrew
Johnson is but the adiuiuistrator of the
estate of the late Mr. Lincoln? an article
of faith in the Republican belief that it is
hard to root out.
Streaked ? The asphaltuiu |witb
which the iuuer courses of stoue in build
ing the wings of the capital was coated
to keep out moisture, has penetrated the
pores of the marble and appears in un
sightly black stains on the outside. The
damage is irremediable; the tires in win
ter, and the huu in summer, drivo out and
draw out the asphaltum, and by and by
the outside walls will be as black, l ing
streaked and speckled as the party now
in power inside.
