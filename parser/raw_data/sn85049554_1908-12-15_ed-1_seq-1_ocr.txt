BENEFITS THE FARMER.
Abolition of Bleached Flour Will Start
8everal Idle Mills.
Fargo, N. D., Dec. 15.—The ruling
against the sale of bleached flour is
expected to work a double-header boom
in North Dakota. It will result in in
creased milling In this state and the
resumption of work by many mills that
had been forced to close down because
they could not compete with the big
mills in bleaching and mixing, and in
directly the sale of the by-products,
such as bran and shorts, will be a
stimulus .to the Increasing dairying in
dustry of the state.
Another effect of the ruling will be
to increase to the farmers the prlcfe
of the hard wheats like fife and blue
stem. These will be used for grado
flour instead of being mixed to bring
cheaper grades up to the standard.
Both plans will work to the direct ben
efit of North Dakotans, because of the
high quality of the grain in this state.

FRICK LETTER JOKE
Schwab Called Upon to Explain Hi*
Doclarations Pertaining to Ability
of Trust to Sell in Foreign Markets
and Lower Prices Than at Home—
The Tariff Hearing.
Washington, Dec. 15.—A arge fund
bf information regarding ffie cost of
making steel was given the house ways
and moans committee today by Charles
M. Schwab, of Now York.
Chairman Payne began a crossfire of
questions by asking Schwab about the
letter which had been referred to by
previous witnesses. This letter was
written by Schwab to Henry C. Frlck
May 16, 1S99, and stated that rails
were being made for less^than $12 per
ton, or nearly $7 less than cost. In
England. In the letter Schwab pre
dicted that tile Carnegie Steel com
pany, of which he was then president,
would be-able to increase Its not earn
ings to $3,600,0^0 a month, and said
it could sell all of Us surplus produc-
the profit on domestic sale. He said
•the letter had been prepared at Frlck's
solicitation and was written in an op
timistic vein.
Schwab gave a detailed statement of
the cost of making iron and steel rails,
which indicated that the present cost
of manufacturing pig iron is $14 per
ton, as compared with $8 per ton in
1899, while the cost of steel rails is to
day $21.50 per ton, compared with $12
nine years ago.
Before Schwab took the stand, Wal
ter Wood, of Philadelphia, a manufac
turer of cast iron pipe, asked Jhat the
difference in duty on cast iron pipe and
pig iron be reduced $2 in addition to
the advocated reduction of the duty on
pipe as much as the duty on pig Iron is
reduced. The tariff on iron pipe is now
$5 higher than on pig irtjn. .Witness
said he competed with the "trust."

Somebody Deliberately Lied.
Summarizing charges made in this
connection the president says:
"These statements sometimes ap

uals either unknown or to be of -bad
character. They are false in every par
ticular from beginning to end. The
wickedness of the slanders is only sur
passed by their fatuity. So utterly
•baseless are the stories that appar
ently they represent in .part merely ma
terial collected for campaign purposes
and in part stories original)*- concocted
with a view of possible blackmail. The
inventor of the story about Mr. Charles
P. Taft, for InstMce, evidently sup
posed that at someNperiod of the Pan

retary of war, whereas in reality Mr.
W. H. Taft never became secretary of

"While the criminal offense of which
Mr. Pulitzer .lias .been guilty is in form
a libel upon individuals, the great in
jury done is in blackening the good
name of the American people. It should
not .be left to a private citizen to sue
Mr. Pulitzer for libel. He should be
prosecuted for libel by the govern
mental authorities. In point of encour
agement of iniquity, in point of Infamy,
of wrongdoing, there is nothing to
choose between a public servant who
betrays his trust, a public servant who
is guilty of blackmail, or theft, or
financial dishonesty of any kind, and a
man guilty as Mr. Pulitzer has been
guilty in this instance. It is therefore
a high national duty to bring to justice
this villifier of the American people,
this man who wantonly and wickedly
f.
nnd without one shadow of justifica
tion seeks to blacken the character of
reputable private citizens and to con
vict the government of his own coun

Method of Purchat Explained.
Explaining the method of concluding
the purchase, the president says:
"The Panama canal transaction was
actually carried thru not by either the
then secretary of state, Mr. John Hay,
or the then secretary of war, Mr. Elihu
Hoot, both of whom, however, were
cognizant of all the essential features
but by the then attorney general, Mr.
P. C. Knox, at present senator from
Pennsylvania. I directed or approved
every action, and am responsible for
all that was done in carrying out the
will of the congress and the provis
ions of the law, enacted by congress
tifter exhaustive examination and dis
cussion, were scrupulously complied
with by the executive. While the trans
action was pending I saw Mr. Crom
well but two or three times, and my
communications w«4h him were lim
ited to the exchange of purely formal
whether Mr. Root held any conversa
tion with him. The attorney general
saw him frequently, as ho was coun

communications were official, as rep-
