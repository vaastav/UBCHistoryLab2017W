and on tbit issue the Court decided
that Sommerville was entitled to the

determined that Sommerville should

coarse them are easy enough things

Sommerville half been arraigned
under nine different specifications and
his removal is asked for under sec

making payments to clerks, laborers,

amounts; charging that persons were
paid from the funds of the ware
house while employed elsewhere;

the case of a man whose removal from

The President’s Message.— The
message of President Arthur was
communicated to Congress on Monday
last, and was much more severely
criticised, the papers state, in his own
|ioHtieal household than by demo
crat* Of his political friends, the
* IUII Breeds" appear to be better
pleased with it than the Stalwarts,
who speak of it as a feeble and in
consistent State Pafwr. We legret
that our limited space will not allow
of its appearance in fell in the Bea
cow, the best we are ably to do being,
the publication of a brief iy nog wit of
the questions of domestic concern
treated el in the Message. The re
ferences to. and suggestions of, the
President in regard to our Foreign
relations will raoeivs, we believe, the
approval and endorsement, of every
intelligent American. Premising, that
the synopsis give* below of the in
i rnivl matters discussed in the Mee
’•Mge is taken from the Dmly Sun of
of Tuesday, we present it without
further comment to the consideration
of our readers:
The discussion of questions of do
mastie concern naturally forms the
greater pari of the communication,
and the interesting and important sub
jects of a revision cl the tariff and a
reduction in internal revenue taxa
tion are treated at some length. Re
ferring to ihe rej ort of the Secretary
of the Treasury “as to the necessity
of providing by legislation some mode
of freAng the treasury cl so excess of
awste,” the President says he hearti
ly approves the secretary’s recom
mendation of immediate and exten
sive reductions in (ha annual reve
nues of Ihe government. The surplus
revenue for the fiscal year ended
June &>. mi. whs 11K*.000,000, and
for the fiscal year ended on the 30th
of Jane last was more than odb hun
dred and fifty-five mill tone. Although
this surplus has been largely applied
lu (be psymeut of the national debt,
the president renews Urn exf reseioa
of hia conviction that rock rapid ex
tinguishment of the national indebt
edness m is now taking pines in cause
for serious apprehension, rather fthaf
for congratulation. If tbs mrolUtt
revenues of tbs government He idle
in tbs treasvg they will become tks
temptation to corrupt and exirava
gnnt expenditure. Tbs Prssidsnt.,
therefore, roggssts that unless it shall
be frond that (he probable expendi
tures of tbs govern meat for tbs eon*
been underestimated,
all internal taxes except those which
relate to distilled spirits can be prn
ink the cost of col lection f2.500.Q00
and retire from office from l.&K) to
2.000 persona He does not think,
however, that the time has arrived
for the total abolition of internal
taxes, for the reason that it is doubt
ful whether the duties on imports
would alone be sufficient for ths needs
of government, and because, more
over, • total abolition of exeise taxes
would prove a serious obstacle to a
thorough revision of the tariff.
The present tariff system is, the
President frankly admits, in many
respects adjust, and if the tax on do
mestic spirits is to be retained, he is
clearly of the opinion, judging from
the revenueo derived from customs
during the last few yean, that large
reductions in the customs revenue are
entirely feasible; 'and this may be
accomplished, be believes, without
abandoning the protection of domes
tic labor by equalising the public
burdens among all classes and occu
pations.
The President refers to bis veto of
the river and harbor bill of last ses
sion, and recommends to the consid
eration of Congress the advisability
of the passage of an amendment to
the Federal co *tit tion which wonid
permit the executive to disapprove of
any item or items in an appropria
tion bill without being under the
necessity of condemning the entire
measuie. y y. - fc. • , --i
Referring to the report of the Sec
retary of War, the attention of Con
gress in invited to the propriety of
making more adequate provision for
arming and equipping the m iitia,
and to the conflicting legislation with
reference to the retirement of array
officers. The condition of the navy,
as shown in the secretary's report, is
commented upon and the attention of
Congress called to the intimate con
nection and interdependence of the
navy and the commercial marine, and
to the continued decadence of the lat
ter and the transfer of our growing
commerce to foreign bottoms.
The report of the Postmaster-Gen -
eral shows that there is a considera
ble surplus in his department, and
the President expresses himself in
favor of a reduction of letter postage
to the rate of two cents per half
ounce, and believes that the increase
in postal patronage would equal the
expenditures after the lapse of three
or four years, if they would not ulti
marelv greatly increase the revenues
from this source.
In regard to that portion of the
Attorney-General*, report which
touches upon the star-route-caeca, the
President save that “if any guiltv
person shall finally e cape punishment
it all not be for lack of earnest and
diligent efforts on the part of the
prosecution."
Commenting in connection with
the report of the Secretary of the In
terion upon the illiteracy disclosed
iu certain portions of the country by
the . census returns, the President
thinks it a momentous question wheth
er Congress should not extend imme
diate end substantial aid to supple
ment individual effort and State leg
islation in behalf of education.
Upon the subject of civil-service re
form the President recalls the senti
ments expressed in his last communi
cation to Congress, and adds that
since thebe suggestions were submit
ted “the people of the country, ap
parently without distinction of party,
have in various ways giveu express
ions of their earnest wish for prompt
aud definite action. In my judgment
such action should no longer be post
{xmed."
The President takes occasion to set
himself right upon the question of
official removals, and claims that in
the fourteen months of his adminis
tration only eighty-nina removals
have been made, exactly the same
number made in the fonr months of
Presidsat Garfield's administration.
In connection with this subject he
also expresses his disapproval of
forced contributions from office bold
ere, and favors their prohibition by
law.
The Postmaster General has adopt
ed an invention combining a letter
s beet, envelope and stamp, all for
t use cento, and a circular letter and
envelope and stamp for one cent ad
ded to the cost of the paper, fibs toi
ler sheet ie manufactured with gum
med flaps, which when the sheet is
folded lap over two open edges and

of the flaps, end the sheet is

post offices by the middle of Janua

The potato crop is about 160.000.-

The Fate of Moboax —The New
York Sun pub!tehee § sworn state
ment made by the laU Tburlow Weed
on ibf 38tb of last September, in
which be professes to explain the
mystery surrounding the disappear
ance of William Morgan of Batavia.
New York, In 1826. Morgan, our
older readers will recollect, was re
ported to be about to publish a vol
ume exposing Hie secrets of free ma
sonry, which he had sworn never to
4i£B)ge.jMid was kidnapped and car
ried off. Weed, in a newspaper of
which he was editor, asserted that the
Fseessaeene were eoneensed in Mor
gan's abduction. Great excitement
ensued, end Weed was compelled to
•ever bis connection with the paper.
Committees of vigileoce and safety
were formed and Morgan and bis ab
ductors were said to have been traced
to Fort Niagara, near Lewiston, N. Y.
From thence it was believed that Mor
gan was taken out upon Lake Onta
rio in a boat aad drowsed. No posi
tive proof oould be obtained and re
ports were current that Morgan had
afterwards been seen at Smyrna, in
Asia. A body was afterwards found
along the shore of Lake Ontario which
was identified by Mrs. Morgan as that
of her husband, whilst the clothing
was identified by Mrs. Muoroe as har
ing been worn by her husband, Tim
othy Muoroe, who was also drowned.
The agitation resulted in the organi
sation of an anti-Masonic party, in
Western New York, which spread to
other States, and came near defeating
Gen. Jackson for President in 18'?,
Weed was the prime mover in the
anti-Masonic agitation, and according
to his statement, obtained proof show
ing by whom and in what manner
Morgan was drowned. Weed claims
to have heard the confession of one
John Whitney, who witnessed the
drowning of Morgan, but he neglec
ted to secure Whitney’s sworn state
ment. The evidence was not to be
made public by Weed except in bis
own defence, and Whitney died be
fore making oath to the story he told
Weed.
The President has ordered the re
moval of the marshal of the District
of Columbia. Charles £. Henry; Post
master D. B. Ainger, Assistant Post
master M. M. Parker, M. D. Helm,
foreman of the Congressional Record,
and George E. Spencer, Commissioner
of the Union Pacific Railroad. They
are charged with interfering with the
administration of justice in the sUr
route cases. Their dismissal created
a sensation at the capital.
Two magistrates in Washington
county nominated by the Governor
and confirmed by the Senate, failed
to qualify, and the former appointees
continued to act. Appeals from their
decisions recently raised the question
as to their power to act after the term
of their appointment, two years, bad
expired, and Judge Alvey last week
decided that magistrates* hold over
until their successors qualify.
The annual session of the Mary
land State Grange, composed of mas
ters of subordinate granges and their
wives, will be held in the hall of the
Young Men's Christian Association,
Baltimore, on Tuesday. December 12.
Several important matters affecting
the organization will be considered
during the session, which promises to
be au interesting and important one.
In reply to a New York press re
porter the officer in charge of the
Signal Service in that city gave the
following explanation of shifting and
veering winds, as used in the weather
reports: “By shifting winds we mean
those that change from north to sooth
bv the wet point. Veering winds
change from north to south by the
weet point."
“Ou Next Governor." —Under
the above caption, a writer in the last
issue of the Rochnile Sentinel makes
the following complimentary mention
of our oonntyman, Judge Robert
Ford:
"As the time is not very far dis
tant when the Democracy of onr good
old State will be called upon to name
a candidate for Governor, permit me
through the columns of your widely
circnfated journal to suggest the name
of Hon. Robert Ford, of St. Mary's
county, as one entirely worthy of the
honor. While Ido not wish to say a
word in detraction of the claims of
other gentlemen who may have aspi
rations in that direction. I am Certain
that no man who is acquainted with
the character of Judge Ford will for
one moment doubt that he would
prove a most popular candidate, and
nil the important office with all the
dignity and wisdom for which he is
not*d V
"Having filled the position of As
sociate Judge for many years, he has
not been identified with any of the
factional contests in the parly, and
would bring into the contest with oar
common enemy none of that bitter
f eting which has a i happily been en
gendered t f late years.'

Assistant State's Attorney Gans
{ pronounces the criminal code of Msry
and a disgrace to the state, and far
more defective than the body of sta
tntee for the punishment and repres- j
sion of crime in most other states. —
We believe this criticism to be just,
severe as it is. The cause of the
anomalies and defects in our penal
statutes is obvious enough. The Code
is a piece of patchwork, the frayed
remnants of the old inherited crimi
nal law of England being mended
and overlaid with a miscellaneous
series of enactments to suit special
interests and special occasions.—
A criminal code, to be homoge
neous and consistent with iteelf,
should always preserve the central
idea of crime and its degrees, shades
and differences, regulating the pun
ishment by this one certain standard.
But our statutes have lost sight of this
distinction almost entirely. In the
case cited by Mr. Gans, for instance,
where the larceny and the embezzle
ment of small sums of money are pun
ished with imprisonment of such dif
ferent character and degree, the twj
statutes represent two entirely differ
ent epochs, and entirely different
views on the subject of criminality
and punishment. Laws change, and
are subject to growth, development
and decay, just as words are. and
codes should be revised, pruned and
corrected just as we remodel our dic
tionaries and reform our grammars.
We cannot cause radically new laws
to be enforced any more than we can
give vogue and currency to new coined
words, unless they are in accordance
with the spirit of the age; but we can
continually lop away excrescences
and reform and simplify processes.—
This ought to be done. It ought to
be the continuous work of a standing
committee of qualified persona, au
thorized and expected to report to
every session of the legislature. Our
schools, and the mode of teaching pur
sued in them, are kept in line with
the spirit of the age and with the
progress of improvement by the con
stant meeting of teachers to inter
change ideas and experiences It
would be a go- d thing if the Bar As
sociation would arrange so as to have
stated meetings and conferences —say
once a quarter—of the state's attor
neys and the leading criminal law
yers of the state, in order not only to
promote bienaeance, but to find out
and determine the deficiencies in our
criminal code, and the best modes of
repairing them. — Balt. American.
Why Oysters Should be Eaten
Haw. —Why oysters should be eaten
raw is explained by Dr. William
Roberts in his lecture on “Digestion.”
He says that the general practice of
eating the oyster raw is evidence that
the popular judgment upon matters
of diet is usually trustworthy. The
fawn-colored mass, which is the
delicious portion of the fish, is
its liver, and is simply a mass
of glycogen. Associated with the
glycogen, but withheld from actual
contact with it during life, is its ap
propriate digestive ferment—the hep
atic diastase. The mere crushing of
the oyster between the teeth brings
these two bodies together, mad
the glycogen is at once digested
without any other help then the dias
tase. The raw, or merely warmed,
oyster is eelf-digestive. But the ad
vantage of this provision is wholly
lost by cooking, for the hear imme
diately destroys the associated fer
ment, and a cooked oyster has te be
digested, like say other food, by the
eater s owa digestive powers.
“My dear air, do you want to ruin
voor ' digestion V asked Professor
Houghton, of Trinity College, one
day of a friend who had ordered
brandy and with hie oysters la
a Dublin restaurant.
Then he seat for a glam of brandy
and a glass of Guinness’ XX, sad pul
an oyster in each, la a very short
time there lay in the bottom of the
glam of breads a tough, leathery
substance resembling lbs finger of a
kid glove, while in the porter there
was hurdle atr *ce of the oyster to
be found.
