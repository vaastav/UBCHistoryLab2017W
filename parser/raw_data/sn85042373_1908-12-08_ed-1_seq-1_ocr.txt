Competition Will Adjust Rewards.
"Might has overturned this law in
some cases, cunning has perverted it
in others and government has some
times suspended it, but it should be
the aim of the social man to restore
this law and to make It operative.
Man cannot adjust the laws of so
ciety as impartially or as equitably
as they can be adjusted by competi
tion where competition is free.
"Man has not the intelligence to

lative act or by commission, nor have
those in power the disinterestedness
necessary to a wise distribution of the
work to be done. Where competition
is impossible, a government monopoly
is neceet&ry, but where individual
competition Is possible, competition
is better than government ownership.
"The Republicans may boast of their
victory, but they have a more formid
able opponent than the Democratic
party to contend with. They have the
irresistible forces of Socialism to com

deaf to the petitions of those who
feel aggrieved by present injustice,
the remonstrance will grow until the
threat of punishment will compel the
government to give heed.

"Just as the Populist party grew
until It compelled consideration of the
abuses that led to its .organization,
so the Socialist party will grow until
It forces those at the head of the gov

are done and to apply remedies.
"A Democratic victory would have
brought the reforms earlier, but even
a Republican victory cannot perman

acting with the Democrats, might have
hastened these reforms, but the So

Defense Proves She Was on
the Street Instead of With
Rustin
Omaha, Dec. 8.—Another expectant
crowd gathered at Judge Sears'
branch of the criminal court today to
hear the testimony in the murder trial
of Charles E Davis. Considerable in
terest was shown as to. what the coun
ty attorney would present in the way
of rebuttal since the defense had
placed two witnesses on the stand to
impeach the evidence of Mrs. Abbie
Rice and a number of other witness
es who had testified for the prosecu
tion.
Mrs. Emily Allen yesterday testi
fied to having seen Mrs. Abbie Rice
on the street down town about 4
o'clock in the morning buying a pa
per, a time at which, according to sev
eral witnesses for the prosecution, she
was at the house of Clara Gleason.
Mrs. Allen told a remarkable story
and went into the minutest details to
show that she was able to fix the time
of each event which brought -her into
contact with Mrs. Rice.
All the way through the prosecu
tion has introduced witnesses to show
that Mrs. Rice that night got on a
car at. Fortieth and Farnam streets,
at 11:30 and went directly to her
room at Clara Gleason's where she
remained until the next day.
On cross-examination Mr. English
showed -that some person, who Mrs.
Allen believed wished to keep her
testimony out of the case, called her
to the telephone and said: "You are
a great big bag of hot air and you
better keep your nose out of this'
case."
On cross-examination, Mrs. Allen
followed closely the details of the
evidence given on direct questioning.
Mrs. Allen then told in detail of
having seen Dr. Rustin and Mrs. Rice41
together several times. She knew
Dn Rustin well and presumed all the
time that Mrs. Rice was his wife. Re"
direct examination developed that
some person had called her up on the
telephone and told her to "keep her

When the bulky document had been
formally delivered to the two houses,
there was a subdued silence in the
galleries which were filled to over
flowing. The members followed close
ly the reading of the message for near

clerk's voice began to grow husky,
they sought the cloak rooms and lob

copy of the document at their leisure,
rather than follow the long reading

The Message.
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
The financial standing of the nation
at the present time is excellent, and
the financial management of the na
tion's interests by the government
during the last seven years has shown
the most satisfactory results. But our
currency system is. imperfect, and it
is earnestly to be hoped that the cur
rency commission will be able to pro
pose a thoroughly .gpod system which
will do away with'to existing defects.
.During the period from July 1,
1901 to September 30, 190S, there was
an increase in the.amount of money
in circulation of $902,991,399. The
increase in the per capita during this
period was $7.06. Within this time
there were several occasions when it
was necessary for the treasury de
partment to come to the relief of the
money market by purchases or re
demptions of United, States bonds by
increasing deposits.4ft. national bank's

to approximately $5,000,000. Clear
ing house associations throughput the
country 'had been obliged to 'resort
to the expedient of issuing clearing
house certificates, to be used as mon
ey. In this emergency it was deter
mined to invite subscriptions for $50,
000,000 Panama canal bonds, and
$100,000,000 three per cent certificates
of indebtedness authorized by the act
of June. 13, 1898. It was proposed
to redoposit in the national banks the
proceeds of these issues, and to per
mit their use as a basis for additional
circulating notes of national banks.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.

The moral effect of this procedure
was so great that It was necessary
to Issue only $24,631,608 of the Pan
ama canal bonds and $15,436,500 of the
certificates of indebtedness.
During the period from July 1,1901,
to September 30, 1908, the balance be
tween th» net ordinary receipts, and
the net ordinary expenses of the gov
ernment showed a surplus in the four
years 1902, 1903, 1906 and 1907, and
a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908
and a fractional part of the fiscal year
1909. The net result was a surplus
of $99,283,413.54. The financial oper
ations of the government during this
period, based upon these differences
between receipts and expenditures, re
sulted in a net reduction of the inter
est-bearing debt of the United States
from 987,141,040 to $897,253,990, not
withstanding that there had been two
sales of Panama canal bonds amount
ing in the aggregate to $54,631,980,
and an issue of three per cent certi
ficates of indebtedness under the act
of June 13, 98,. amounting to $15,
436,500. Refunding operations of the
treasury departments under tl*e act
of March 14, 1900, resulted in the con
version into two per cent consols of
1930 of $200,309,400 bonds bearing
highter rates of interest. A decrease
of $8,687,956 in the annual interest
charge resulted from these operations.
In short during the seven years and
three months there has been a net
surplus of nearly one hundred mill
ions of receipts over expenditures, a
reduction of the interest-bearing debt
by ninety millions, in spite of the ex
traordinary expense of the Panama
canal, and a saving of nearly nine
millions on the annual interest charge.
This is an exceedingly satisfactory
showing, especially in view of the
fact that during this period the na
tion has never hesitated to undertake
any expenditure that it regarded as
necessary. There have been no new
taxes and no increases of taxes on
the contrary some taxes have been
taken oft there has been a reduction
ol taxation.
Corporations.
As regards the great corporations
engaged in interstate business, and
especially the railroads, I can only
repeat what I have already again and
I
again said In my message to the con
gress. I believe that under the inter
state clause of the constitution of the
United States has complete and para
mount right to control all
agencies of interstate commerce,
and I believe that the national
government alone can exer-

A TARIFF BILL
Work Will Begin Tomorrow on the
New Measure
Washington, Dec. 8—The work of
framing a new tariff bill will be ac
tively begun by the house ways and
means commission on Wednesday.
The majority members of the commit
tee will be designated by the chair
man as a sub-committee to draft the
bill. A resolution offered in the
house today by Chairman Payne of the
house ways and means committee,
which was adopted, gives the commit
tee power to subpoena witnesses for
the tariff hearings. An executive
meeting of the committee probably
will be held tomorrow to select the
names of those whom it is desired to
have appear before it. President Van
Cleave of the National Association of
Manufacturers, probably will be one
of the first called before the commit
tee.
PECULIAR POWER
The Shah Apitolnts the Members of
the Persian Council
Teheran, Dec. 8—The statutes gov
erning the newly instituted Persian
council are shortly to be made pub
lic. They will confer fairly wide pow
ers on the new body, one of the weak
points of which however, is its un
representative character. All the
members are to be nominated by the
Shah.
The council will be composed of 60
men, 32 notables and 18 merchants.
They will remain in office for two
years. The meetings will be held in
the Teheran palace of the shah and
the more important questions may be
submitted by the council to his maj
esty direct. Ordinarily, however, the
grand vizier will act as intermediary.

A THORNY PATH
Postal Savings Bank Bill May Not be
Passed
Washington, Dec. 8—A thorny path
confronts the postal savings bank bill
in spite of the fact that its passage is
advocated in the Republican national
platform.
Investigations conducted abroad by
members of the national monetary
commission are in large part respon
sible for a change of sentiment in re
gard to the establishment of postal
savings banks.
Several members of the commission
are now on record in favor of the gov
ernment keeping out of the bank busi
ness. Senator Aldrich, the chairman
of the commission is ready to take a
positive stand against the passage of
the bill and he will have the support
of a large number of senators because
of influence brought to bear upon
them by the opposition of small bank
ers throughout the country. These
bankers have taken steps to flood
their senators and congressmen with
protests against its enactment. They
have taken the position that the state
and savings banks are necessary to
communities because it is to them
that borrowers are compelled to go
when they desire to raise money on
real estate and chattels which nation
al banks will not accept as securities
for loans. The position is taken fur
ther that these small banks in many
instances will be driven out of busi
ness by the postal banks. In view of
the opposition that has developed the
prospect is that no vote will be ob
tained on the postal savings bank bill
on December 14 or upon any other
day in the immediate future.

MORRIS UNNECESSARY

Washington Dec. 8—The report of
the commissioner bf Indian affairs, F.
E. Leupp, to the house of representa
tives, naming the non-reservation In
dian schools which in his judgment
are no longer of value to the Indian
service, was submitted to the house
.today. As a result of an attempt at
the last session of congress to have
the Carlisle Indian school abolished,
the commissioner of Indian affairs
was directed to investigate upon what
terms it may be possible to dispose
of any of the non-reservation Indian
schools which he deemed unnecessary
to the general scheme for Indian edu
cation.
WILLIAMS' GROUCH
Emperor Grieved Over his Recent Call
ing Down
Potsdam, Dec. 8—The emperor, who
has been living in seclusion since No
vember 17, today resumed audience
with reference to official business, the
finance minister, Baron Von Rhein
baben and Herr Von Valentini, chief
of the civil cabinet, being among those
received. The emperor has been suf
fering from a cold for the past fort
night and although he is able to take
long walks and rides, is described as
being greatly depressed by recent
events and not. disposed to talk even
to members of his household, as he
feels deeply his loss of prestige
abroad and among his own people.
The emperor feels grieved that old
loyal ministers, such as Baron von
Rheinbaben, General Von' Einem and
Dr. Rethmann-Holweg, as well as
Chancellor Von Buelow, should desire
to limit his freedom of speech in his
after dinner conversations, even
though with foreigners. The empress
has been his constant companion and
councilor during the last few weeks.
ARE THEY DEAD
Question of Whether Electrocution
Kills to be Settled
Albany, N. Y., Dec. 8—Officials of
the state department of prisons are
interested In the report from Trenton/
N. J., that efforts are to be made by
prison physicians to revive the victim
of the next electrocution at the state
prison there for the purpose of prov
ing or disproving the theory that has
been expounded that electrocution only
stuns the victims who are later killed
by the surgeons knife during the au
topsy.
"While I have no personal knowl
edge as to whether electricity really
kills except that which ts reported to
me by the officials in charge of elec
trocutions," said Superintendent C. V.
Collins of the state prison department
today, I feel certain that when the
contacts are properly made, the man
is dead before the surgeon's knife
touches him. We have had some of
the most eminent physicians of the
country attend executions in New
York state and in every instance aft
er an examination of the man electro
cuted, they have pronounced him
dead."
In his years of service at the head
of the state prison department, Su
perintendent Collins had attended but
one electrocution, that of Leon Csol
gosz, murderer of President McKinley,
who was executed at Auburn prison
on October 29, 1901. Fourteen per
sons are under sentence of death In
this state, seven at Auburn prison
[seven at Sing Sing.
