the message* as is her'' presented, exhib
its more than u.-ual ibility?while it
abounds in those chiracteristies pecu

noticed that while the su;cesij of our
arms has nut 1 eon as great, nor otu for

nothing discouraging.

More Soldiers.
The Government has now in arms one
million of men, but is this unprecodcn
.od number sufficient lo insure the spoo
ily siiDprei-iiiti of the rebellion? V\ e,
for the following reasons, think it
inadequate. It'3 undeniftblo, that wo
all have hitherto sadly erred, in under
ra'ing tho power, unanimity, bravery and
resources of our subtle foe, and conse
quently was compelled lo rolinquisb
r.uch volorotislv won. Anew call for
throe hundred thousand,was quickly fob
lowed by a similar ono, and patriots res
ponded with alacrity, from Maine to
Cnlifornir.; an.l ihe result is?six lit n
dred thousand reinforcements; but, ton
.-idoring the swoeping conscription nut,
and the desperation evinced by our ene
my, we fear our vast army may he in tho
future--as it unfortunately has been in
too many instancis, in tho past?over
whelmed by superior numbers. Our six
hundred eld regiments hie, (with scmce
Av nn exception,) sadly depleted, and in
our judgment, they should immediately
be filled to a maximum; and as vol
unteering involves too much time
and moncv. we suggest an immediate
dralt for at least four hundred thousand
men. The productive resources of the
country would suffer much less, from a
draft now, than next Spring. It is ab
surd to suppose the rebels will evcrsuo
comb while they can confront us with
equsl numbers, hence the wisdom of
demonstrating our superiority, by pitt
ing against them a force that (bey can'
potubhj withstand. We have at least three
times n? many white fj.hting men as j
they hove. Why not lien, ertt>A Ihrm
with tmmbcrf? Mcrcy dcmr.nds, that
this terrible stiuggle be spec lily cn<!cd.

A Butternut sheet, in Iowa brags j
over a fumily of a father of sevon grown |
up sons that voted tho clean huuernui
ticket at the Into election. Of coursoi
whero you find a fimily of seven sons,
and none of thorn in the army, their pol

would have hceo in tho service of Uncle

A meeting of tho book trade of Boston,

Important to Volunteers,
It has been decided by the authorities
a'. Washington that if a soldier is dis
charged before he has served two whole
years, or to the end of tho war, if sooner
ended,ho forfeits his olUO bounty. Tho
back dues for wages, end fifty cents for

placc of discharge lo the place of enroll,

gates from his nearest paymaster. If a
soldier is killed, or dies of disease, before
the end of two years or tho olosa of the
war, he has unilcr ihe liberal construc
tion of the law. served lo the end of the
war, so far as he is orean he concerned.
Congress intended by Iho provisions of
the law that no one should have the
bounty until iho end of the war. Tho
ClOOboun'y, by ibis law, will buiuimo.

Under an order and rule of the War
Department, there can be pro ured for
the wives of soldiers imprisoned in the
South the monthly wages of the soUior,

monl'iM wa>;es, ?hicli iho Government
reserves. If no wifo, the minor child

the soldier is unmarried, his widowed
mother is entitled.
An important decision lias been made

that he it nol lo wail until his company

We will give tho official vote in our
I) x' i'stt;,
I In I lie fallowing extract from ihePres
I ident'e MMKage, a birds eye view of oar
notional finances is presented. Our
roaJers v. ill concur with u? tint our "6
nancial atuotioo'' is not discouraging;
Tho condition uf the finance! will
claim your most diligent consideration.
| The vast expenditure* incident to the
military and naval operations, required
fur rlio suppression of tho rebellion, have
hitherto been metwuh a promptitude and
[certainly unusual in similar circumstan
ces; and the public credit has been
fully m> intnineJ. The continuance ol
the war, however, and the increased dis
bursements made news-try by the aug
mented f.rcos now in the field, demand
your lien reflections as to the best mode*
of providing the necessary revenue,
without injury to business, and with the
loaf t possible burdens upon labor.
I ho suspension of specie payments by
the banks, soon afior the commencement
nf your last session, made largo issues of
United States notes unavoidable. In no
other way could the payment of the
troop", and tho satisfaction of other just
demands, be so economically, or so well
provided for. Tho judicious legislation
of Congress, securing tho recoivaWlity of |
theso notes for loans and internal duties !
aud making them a legal tender fur oth i
er debts, has made them an universal
currency, and has satisfied, partially at |
least and for the time, tho long (eli want I
of an uniform circulating medium, savins I
thereby to tho people immense sums in !
discounts nnd exchanges.
A return to specie payments, however,
at the earlicit period compatible with
due regard to all intcresls coneerned,
should over be kept in view. Flucta
tionsin tile v due of currency are always
injurious, and to reduce these IhciuV
lions to tho lowest possible point will
always bo a leading purpose in wise leg
illation. Convertibility, prompt and
cerium conr. nubility j?t0 cojni j, ?cn.
erally acknowledged to be tho best arid !
surest safeguard against them; and it is'
f-x romely do'ibtful whether a firculitlon 1
of United Stales notes, payable in coin
and sufficiently largo for the wants of the '
people, can he porm.mently, usofully and
safely maintained.
Is there then, any other mode in
which thn nrcessfiry j>f-vision ftr the
public wants can be made, and thegrcat
advantages of a sale and uniform cur
rency secured ?
1 know of none which promises so
certain result*, and is, at tho same time,
so unol j 'ctionable, as the organization
of banking associations, tinder a gener I
aot of Congress, well guarded in its pro
visions. To such associations the Gov
ernment might furnish circulating notes
on the security ofUnited States beads
deposited in the Troasury. Tliesi niites
prepared undi* the Supervision of prop
per officers, being uniform in appear
ance and security, and convertiblo al
ways info coin, would at once proteot
labor against the evils of a vicious cur
rency and fnci it tie commerce by cheap
and safe exchanges,
A moderate reservation from the interest
on the bonds, would compensate the
Uni e I Slates fur tho preparation end
distribution of 11?e notes, and n goner*!
supervision of tho system, and would
lighten the bui'diM] of that part of the
public debt employed ns securities. The
public credit, moreover, would bo groat
ly improved, and the negotiation of new
loans greatly facilitated by the steady
market demand f?r Government bonds,
which the adoption of tho proposed sys
tem wou'd create.
it is an additional recommendation of
the incisure, ol considerable weight, in
my judgement, that it woulil reconcile,
as far as possible, nil1 existing interests,
by tho opportunity offered to existing in
stitutions to reorganize undor the net,
substituting only tho secured, uniform,
national circulation,for the local and va
rious circulation, secured and unsecured
now issued by them.
The receipts into the Treasury from all
sources, iricludinglonns and balance from
the preceding year, for the fiscal year
undine on tho 30th Jiino.'flt.ivero 8588,
805,247 00, of which sum 840,056 397
02 were derived from customs; $1,705.

?Voir. Jus! v? ir j
The disbursements during the same
period were, for Cocgressional, Execu

813,190,334 45; and for payment of

of temporary loan and redemptions,
890 006,922 09; making an aggregate
ol 8579,841,700 25, and leaving a bal
anco in tho Treasury, on tho 1st day of
July, 1802, of 813,043,546 81.
It shoiiM bo observed that the sum of
*90,006 92200, expended for reimburse*
wonts and redemption of pulilio debt,
being included al io in tho loans made,
may be properly deducted bolli Irom re-1
oeipis and expenditures, leaving the ac

Tho reports of tho Secretaries of War
and of ihe Navy arc bercwilh transmit

oro scarcely mora rh?n biief abstracts of

your Attention to them.
It gives me pleasure to report n de< i- 1
(led improvement in the financial con- |
dnion of the Postoffiie Depi rtrr.ent as |
compar d with several preceding years.
The receipts for the fiscal year llttil,
amoun e ! to $?i,34 J,2G6 40, which em
braie 1 the rcvxnuo front all the States;
of the Union for tliree quarters of that |
year. Notwithstanding the ess tion of
revenue from the so-called seceded
States iluting the last fiscal year, thu
increase of the correspondence of tho
loyal States has been su.'fi ient to pro.
dttce a revenue during tl.o sami year of
88,203,820 90, being only 850,000 less
tbnr. wasd.rivod from nil the Slates of
the Union during the previous year ?
Tho expenditures show a sill more fa
vorable result. Tho amount expended
in 1801 woe $1 it.806,75!) II. For the
list year tin amount has been rcduoed to
111.125.354 13,show'nga decrease of
about 52.481,000 in the expend turcs as
compirod with the preceding venr, nnd
about $t3 760.000 as compared with ti e
fined year 1300. The deficiency in the
l)(p irtntent for the pr.'tious year v.n
81551,900 1H. Fur thr'ldst fiscal year
it was reduced to $3,11?,S14 57. Tin-re
fiivorablo rstilts are in part owing to tho
cessation of mail serviie in tho insurrec
tionary St t c. nn I in part to a careful
review of all ? xjenJitures in thai depart
ment in the interest of economy. The
efficiency of tho postal soivice, it ts be
lieved, ha- also lieen m :ch improved ?
Tho Postmaster G-rneral has also open
ed a correspondence, through the Do
pxr'nvnt of State, with foreign Govern
ments, proposing a lor.vcntiun of Postal
representatives 'or the purpose of simpli
fying (he Mies ol foreign postage' and to
expedite the fnr?!rrn mn:ls. This pr-ipo
fi i -n, ei]na'ly important to our adopted
citizens, and to tho commercial interests
of this country, has been favorably en
toiluined, uud agreed to, by all the Gov
ernments from whom replies have been
received.
I ask the attention of Congress m 'he
suggestions of the Postmaster General in
his report re?peeliiis the further legisla
tion required, in bis opinion, fur the ben
efit of the postal ser.ice.
The Secretary of the Interior' reports
as follows iu repaid to the public land?:
"The public lands havo ceased to l)o n
'source of revenue. From the 1st July,

to settlers, that sales for onsh cannot be
expcctod, tu tin exent sufficient to meet'
the expenses of the Gtneral Land Office ;
and the cost ol the surveying and blink

The disci epancy betweon the sum
here slated as arising from tho sales of j
the public lands, an 1 tho sum derived j
from the same source as reported from j
the Treasury Department, arises, as 1 j
understand, from the fact that the peri

siderable sum now, which had previous I

fiuiently large to greatly overreach the !

Ganewl Milroy has issued an order for
the suppression of the Wheeling Press
within his jurisdiction. Wo know it
would come to this. That treasonable
sheet, as ho jjstly denominates it, has
been growing bolder and bolder in its
utterances, until to ondure it longer, was
to exhibit a degree of leniency towards
an enemy,unworthy a military chieftain.
It i.-i worthy of remerk in this connic
