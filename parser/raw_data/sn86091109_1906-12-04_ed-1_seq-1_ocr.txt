To the Senat» and House of Repre

As a «nation we still continue to en

Corporation Campaign Contributions.

to the campaign expense* of any par

President Urges for Right of Govern

Another bill which has Just pa Ht one
house of the congress and which It is
urgently necessary should be enacted
Into law is that conferring upon the
government the right of 'appeal in
criminal cases on questions of law.
This right exists In many of the
states; it exists In the District of Co
lumbia by aot of the congress. It is
of course not proposed that In any

the merits should be set aside. Re

where such a course offers a reason
able chance of success. At first, as
was proper, every effort was made to
enforce these laws by civil proceed
ings; but It has become increasingly
evident that the action of the govern
ment in finally deciding, . In certain
cases, to undertake criminal proceed
ings was Justifiable; and though there
have been some conspicuous failures
these cases, we have had many suc
cesses, which have undoubtedly had a
deterrent effect upon evil -doers,
whether the penalty Inflicted was in
the shape of fine or imprisonment—
an<J penalties of both kinds have al
ready hfcèn inflicted by the courts. Of
course, where the Judge can see his
way to inflict the penalty of Imprison
ment the deterrent effect of the pun
ishment on other offenders Is increased
but sufficiently heavy fine* accomplish
much. Judge Holt, of the New York
district court, In a recent decision ad
mirably stated the need for treating

kind. His opinion runs In part as fol
lows:
"The government's evidence to es
tablish the defendant's guilt was clear,
conclusive, and undisputed. The case
was a flagrant one. The transactions
which took place under this illegal
contract were very large; the amounts
of rebates returned were considerable;
and the amount of the rebate Itself
was large, amounting to more then
one-fifth of the entire tariff charge
foe the transportation of merchandise
from this city to Detroit. It Is not
too much to say. In my opinion, that
If this business was carried on for
considerable time on that basis—that
Is,-if this discrimination In favor of
this particular shipper was made with
an-18 instead of a 23 cent rate and the
tariff rate was maintained as against
their competitors—the result might be
and not Improbably would be that
their competitors would be driven out
of business. This crime is one which
in its nature is deliberate and pre

TWENTY MILLION
RUSSIANS STARVE
St. Petersburg, Dec. 3--Prlnces Lvofl
xnd Orbellan I, the representatives of
the Moscow zemstvo famine relief or
ganization, who have just returned
from the stricken district, have fur
nished the Associated Press with the
following facts regarding conditions In
the famine provinces:
"The crops In the seven provinces
of Samara, Saratov, Simbtrosk, Ka
zan, Penza, Tambov and Ufa were
practically total failures. In twenty
provinces the harvests were very poor.
About twenty million people will need
assistance for from four to ten months
to stave off starvation until the new
trops are available. In some regions
the Inhabitants have been suffering
from starvation for ten years, possible
crops having been gathered In only
two of the ten years. The Moscow
-emstvo organization calculates that
»75,000,000 and possibly more Will be |
pçcesoary."
Though' the conditions In the famine
legions are now distressing, far worse
may be expected in January. The
8emstvo organizations say $300,000,000
will then be exhausted and the relief
organizations will be compelled to
cease their efforts for the starving
peasants. Prince Lvoff complained
that local officials, for political rea
sons, are Interfering with the estab
lishment of soup kitchens and the

CALIFORNIA
UP IN
ARMS
Deeply Offended By the
Presidents Deference
to Japanese
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—Roosevelt'«
discussion of the San Francisco Bchool
situation In his message was received
with great dissatisfaction by the
California delegation In the house,
who assert that no treaty rights have
been violated In excluding Japanese
from the public schools. As the Cali
fornia delegation sees It the treaty
would be clearly unconstitutional and
should nut stand.
A meeting of the California delega
tion will be held to discuss the San
Francisco situation.
The suggestion in Roosevelt's mes
sage that naturalization should be ex
tended to -the Japanese Is extremely
distasteful to the California delegation
In the house.
Senator Raynor introduced the fol
lowing:
Resolved, That In the opinion of the
senate this government has no right
•to enter into any controversy with
any foreign gov p-nment relating to the
public school system of any state« of
the union. '
"Resolved, Further that Iff the opin
ion of the senate there is no provision
In the treaty between the United
States and the government of Japan
that relates In any manner to this
subject or In any wsy Interferes with
the right of the state of California to
conduct and administer Its system of
public schools In accordance with tt*
own legislation an4k
"Resolved. Further that It is the
dutY of the president of the United
States to notify the government of
Japan and notify any foreign govern
ment with which the question may
arise that the public educational In
stitutions of a state are not within
the Jurisdiction of the United Statee
and the United States has no power to
