I From our Regular Correspondent. I
Th*-? President is devoting a con?
siderable portion of his time to &
< areful an?l comprehensive conaidera
tion of our present financial system,
which he, in common with many
??ther profound thinkers, believes
tnt* cuuutry has outgrown. That
something is needed he has long agu
.mo convinced, but just what
mat sc. met tiing la and the best way
to obtain it is \\ bat has not been de?
cided. It wns l**ecnuse no decision
had been ur rived at that neither the
President's message nor Secretary
Wiudom's annual report contained
any specific recommendation on this
subject. Whether the President will
later send a special financial mes?
sage to Congress or will, with aid of
a Senator and a Representative, em?
body the result of his thinking in a
\n he simultaneously introduced
in tb* House and Senate is as yet
Rroblematical. But something must
e done soon, for the clamor for
ra money becomes louder and
louder every day, and the believers
in a free and unlimited courage of
silver, who constitute a majority in
Congress, are growing more and
more restless.
The adoption of a resolution con?
demning the Federal Election bill by
the Farmers' Alliance convention, at
Ocala, might have disconcerted the
-republicans somewhat if it had not
been followed by the positive infor?
mation that the whole business was
put up in this city at a conference of
Southern democratic Senators. As
it was, it attracted no more atten?
tion than would the same resolution
passed by any other democratic con?
vention.
CongTe-aS hrs lost no time to speak
of in its first week. The House luis
passed the International copyright
bill, the regular annual pension ap?
propriation bills, and several others
of minor importance, while tho Sou
ate is working Hway at the Federal
election bill in a wav which indicates
that 1H91 will still be very young:
when that measure, slightly modifi?
ed, shall have become a law of the
land.
Senator Stanford has introduced
his bill to loan Government money
to farmers at low rates of interest
upon mortajragps upon their real es?
tate. He asked that the bill be al?
lowed to lie upon the table until he
shall have submitted a few remarks
upon it. The Senate Finance com
mittee made an unfavorable report
upon this bill at the last session, but
Mr. Stanford insists that the more
thought he devotes to the subject
the more he becomes convinced that
it is a sound constitutional and
practical method of supplying the
national need for a sound circulat?
ing medium.
? tfmmge has yet boon made in
the S-'m!ti*r*!sr ' .
tbe Fv.vral election bili, aud none
will be made until the democrats be?
gin to resort to flllibustoring. The
republicans have nt) desire to pre?
vent their opponents exercising
every legitimate right in discussing
this measure, but they propose to
allow no extended fillibustering.
There ia au interestitTg rumor float -
ing around the Capitol to the effect
that the democratic Senators hui
decided not to flllibuster against a
final vote. This may be taken with
a Brain of allowa ure, in fact several
of them.
Secretary Noble has been looking
pretty closely into the business of
the pension office of late, and one of
tlie results is that a bill prepared at
hia request has beeu introduced in
the House by Representative Bel
knap, of Michigan, reducing tie fee
of pension attornies for obtaining
increases of pensions from $10 to $1.
This has raised a howl among the
pensiou attornies, whose fees for the
month of Noveml>er for innv
pension ca^es alone amouuted to
$80,000. Secretary Noble says
there is no need for an applicant for
an increase in pension to employ an
attorney and that it is little short of
robbery for an attorney to exact a
fee of $10?for the nominal service
performed in such cases. Mr. Noble
is understood to be considering oth?
er changes in the methods of doing
business with the pension office that
will be beneficial to the country and
to the deserving pensioners.
The country has long ago become
convinced that Mr. Blaine is one of
the ablest, if not the ablest Secreta?
ry of the State we have ever had,
and the correspondence in the Bar
rundia affair, which resulted in the
recall of minister Mumer, just sub?
mitted to Congress, adda another
proof to the st: ready ex?
isting of Mp. Ll'.*!*.,,-/* aptitude in
deaiiug with complicated interna?
tional questions. Democratic Con
gressmen vies with republicans in
complimenting Mr. Blaine for his
management of this matter. Ex
Governor Pacheco, of California,
has been nominated Minister to the
Central America States to succeed
Mr. Mizner.
The House Census committee has
practically agree upon an appor?
tionment bill making the member?
ship of the House 350, an increase
of 24.
Senator Pasoe on Saturday prc
sented to the Senate the protest
of the convention of the Conger larc
bill. It is a bill as a substitute foi
the lard bill.
