How John Delaney Administered Tol
son to III* Mistress, VH Acquitted by
tlie Grand Jury and Afterward Moved
by His Consolenee to Confession.
NEW YORK, Deo. 7.—John J.' Delaney,
nineteen years old, is locked up In the
^AUr, 'as street station house, Brooklyn,
teM»s A self-confessed murderer. .He visited
sa&ln. station house on Saturd*y night
while drank, and asked Capt. Campbell
the penalty for murder. Upon learning
it he said lie had murdered a girl, Mary
Jane Cox, and wanted to make a state
ment to the captain. The latter refused
to listen to the boy, as he considered him
SB irresponsible, and sent him away.
-Sp1 Sunday night he returned sober and in
:m?£ his right mind, and after being cautioned
that anything he might say would be
used against him on trial, he made a
long confession, In which he described
his relations to the Cox girl, and ad
mitted that be bad given her a dose of
rat poison.
fes "I met her on the street," he said,
b4"last spring, and an intimacy soon sprang
np. Mary got Into trouble and told me
about It. This was on June 2, and I
bought 18 cents' worth of rat poison and
mixed it in a bottle of water at the Key
stone bouse, New York, In the presence
of .the night clerk, whose name la George,
and a boy named Frank McKeofi. I told
them what it was and what it was mixed
for, and then came over to Brooklyn. I
met Mary on Johnson street, near
Adams, and gave her the bottle, telling
her that if she took plenty of It It would
cure her. She said she would, and went
home. The next morning she was found
dead. From that day to this I haven't
been right in my head, ,and I have had
awful -visions. I can't stand itany longer,
and want to give myself up."
Delaney was taken to Superintendent
Campbell's office, and he repeated his
statement to that Individual ancTto Dis
trict .Attorney Kidgeway. Then he was
locked np again, while Capt. Campbell
came to this city to endeavor to find
"George," the night clerk, and Fr.ank
McKeou.
On the morning of June 3 last, Mary
Jane Cox, a servant girl, eighteen years
old, was found dead In the kitchen of
her employer's house, No. 140 Prince
street. There wad evidence about the
room that she had been very sick, and
the autopsy showed that death had been
caused by ado|e of rat poison. A bottle
containing a solution of poison was
found in hec room. She had swal
lowed- about three-quarters of its
contents. When her clothing was
searched two letters addressed to John
Delaney, and upbraiding him.for bis con
duot toward her were discovered, and the
police were instructed to arrest Delaney,
who was employed in the Keystone houae
In Harl«n.c At the inquest be admitted
his intlmaey with Mary, but Alleged that
she had Induced him, to buy the mixture
which afterward caused her death. The

party living in the same, locality, con
sisting of John Davidson and George H.
Crain, started home on the same route,
and overtook and passed the first party
about two miles ana a half from the oity.
After they bad passed Crow said to Mont
gomery, referring to Davidson, who had
just passed: ''This is as good a time as
you will ever have to settle this fuss."
Montgomery answered, "That's what,"
and they called upon the party that had
passed to stop, which they did. and com
ing up to them Montgomery said to
Davidson: .— you, what did you
strike Martha for?" to which, Davidson
replied: "That's noae of your busi
ness."
At this Montgomery drew his revolver
and Davidson his knife. Davidson
plunged at Crow and urave bis knife into
hi* stomach, instantly killing him. He
then slashed at Montgomery, who by
this time had fired two shots at David
son. Davidson then started on, badly
wounded, and Montgomery kneeling by
Crow, shook him and called, "Bill, Bill,"
but received no reply. He exclaimed,
'Dead by G'—d. He then ran after
Davidson, and, putting his revolver close
to his body, fired the third shot into him,
which felled him in a djing condition.
Montgomery then started off on a run
through the woode, and has not been
found, although he is thought to have
been badly wounded by Davidson's knife.
The bodies were removed to their homes,
and Davidson lingered until 2 o'clock in
the morning, when he died.
The trouble grew out of an old grudge
existing between Davidson and Mont*

Commission Explains Its Farposese
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The twenty-six
senators who took the oath of office at
this session are called new men, but
eleven of them have been sitting iu the
senate for years, and. are their own suc
cessors. Others have been in the senate
before—for example, Mr. Turpie, who
took the place of Mr. Bright when he
Waa expelled for disloyalty, and Mr.
Paddock, who last winter defeated Mr.
Van Wyck as six years earlier Mr. Van
Wyck had defeated him. Mr. Stewart,
of Nevada, ia one of those who return to
the scenes of activity in the past after a
considerable period of retirement. Mr.
8tewart is a tall, large man, whose beard
and hair are white, and who makes a
very imposing appearance. Many years
ago he built the house now occupied by
the Chinese legation on Dupont circle.
There waa then no other house in the
vicinity, and Senator Stewart's residence
waa known indifferently as "Stewart's
castle," and "the honest miner's camp."
Mr. Stewart haa taken a seat pretty well
around on the Republican aide, in the
baoE row, and haa Senator Farrell on
one side of him.
Mr. Hiacook sits close by in the same
row. He is not quite so heavy a man in
tellectually as his face in repose would
indicate, and, if he be anew senator he
certainly is not new here ia any other
aense after all the years he haa spent in
tfie house of representatives.
With him there has just come over
from the house of. representatives Judge
Reagan, of Texas, whose state rewarded
him for his twelve years' fight in the
house against the soulless corporations
with a promotion to a higher sphere of
enjoyment just as soon as the Reagan
Oullom inter-state commerce law had
been passed.
Mr. Purple sat with Senator Vorhees
for a while, and then moved over to the
extreme.right on the democratic side in
the middle row of seats, at the desk in
scribed with his name.
Mr. Pasco, of Florida, sat behind him.
Mr. Pasco is of a rather slendftr build,
with coal-black hair, and mustache and
goatee.
Mr. Faulkner sat in the seat the senate
0®clala have assigned him, and toyed
With the blonde tuft of hair on hia chin,
while hla rival, Lucas, short and hump
hacked, sat in a chair against the wall
and held a tall white hat in hla hand.
ljlr. Blodgett, the new senator' from
•JJetf Jersey, has the very little hair on
his head cut close, and he shaves his
cheeks and chin and has his mustache
trimmed short. He haa taken one of the
three seats on the democratic side that
foam a rudimentary row in the rear of tha
others.
In the corresponding bobtailed row on
the other side Senator Chandler, ex-sec
retary pf the navy, has a chair, and this
small, brisk, sharp-eyed gentleman from
New Hampshire, is expected to devote
himself to showing that the Chicago,
Boston, Atlanta and Dolphin are good
ahips, in spite of anything Secretary
Whitney's subordinates may aay about
them.
Mr. Davis, of Minnesota, haa got a
seat in the rear row of republican seats,
near Mr. Farwell, and the senators who
last winter had these retired positions
are now near the front Senator Cullom
"Succeeded to Senator Logan's seat in the
front row, and close to the center last
winter, and Senator Spooner has now an
eligible seat near the center of the repub
licans, while Ge n. Manderson, who used
t? view the proceedings from the rearest
of the seats, is now near Mr. Spooner.

senate convened to-day a letter from the
secretary of the interior was laid before
it, stating that an appropriation of $77,
000 is necessary to complete the report on
the' census of 1880.' The letter waa
tabled. A large number of official re
ports were received and ordered printed.
Mr. Cullom moved to adjourn^ but
withdrew the motion at the request of
Mr. Plumb, who offered a resolution in-
?he
utring if any person employed under
appropriation of congress for experi
ments in the production of sorghum had
procured patents on inventions perfected
during the Work.
Mr. Farwell asked that he be allowed
to introduce a bill to perpetuate the na
tional banking ayatem.
Mr. Cullom declined, and renewing
hla motion, the senate at 12:20 ad
journed.

service, is. recommended to take the

the cable rate is-$2.25 per word. From
Victoria, B. C,, to Great Britain tho cost
is 17 cents a wurd. It the trans-Pa
cific cable were laid and allowing
*1
.00 word as the rule from Sidney or
Auckland to Victoria, it will at once bo
perceived tbar the direct benefit yearly to
the government of Australusla, who
cable thousands 6f words annually to the
mother country, would be very great.
To complete the scheme a tranr-Atla nr.u
cable would have to be obtained, but it is
thought there would be no difficulty in
securing one of the muny existing lines.
Canada's contribution to the projected
enterprise would probably be $50,000 for
twenty years, but she would be more
than remunerated for her investment by
the reduction which would be obtaiued
in Atlantic cable rates.

Senator Teller: It is a remarkable
message and very weak.
Senator Frye: It is good enough plat

Senator Allison: If the president
means free trade, and I take it he does,
it will be a good enough document for Re

Senator Spooner: A free-trade essay.
I am glad to see them show their hand.
Senator Reagau: I like and endorse it.

Dakota and WuebiOKtun lerntorj
should hbve been admitted wuhoat
qaeetion at tho last, session of congreta,
The senate passed the bills admitting
them, but the democratic house de.euttsd
them. The democrats do not want them
admitted beoanse they know that the
eleotoral votes of both will be given to
the republican. Mootana is another ter
ritory thai is entitled to admissiou. It
stands next to Wachitgton territory ID
the matter of populution'.
SeUdtor Man da son said tb«i senate
would undoubtedly te-enaot bills !or tbe
admiBsioa of these progressive tetii
tories to statehood at the coming session,
and would also likely pass a bill to ad
mit Montana. He is a member of the
committee on territories and may be
supposed to know wbat he is talking
about.
"The people of the east," said he,
"have no conception of tha feeling that
exists in the weal over the refnssl of ths
democratic house to admit tbese terri.
tories. I do not know how it wilt be in
the east during the ooming presidential
campaign, but I know this opposition of
the democrats to tbe lawful and jnat
demands of the people of Dakota aid
Washington territory will haye an im
portant influence in favor of the repub
lican party in the west. The demoorats
stand on this question to-day just as
they did on the admisasca of Kansas
»nd other anti-slavery territories in tbe
abolition period. Tbey oppose their
admission solely because they know the
territoriee are republican and not on
the Blightest pretence of justice."
