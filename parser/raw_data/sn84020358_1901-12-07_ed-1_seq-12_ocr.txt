When James J. Hill, then president 'of
the Manitoba system of rails and loco
motives, began the work of establishing
town sites in the Far Northwest future
feeders of his transcontinental line one
of the first to be laid out was Blue
Duck. While the community nourished
for two or more years, changes in the
wheat territory and shifting of the cat
tle ranges destroyed its trading area
and finally effaced it from the map. But
there must be a great many men still
living who passed through the portals
of Blue Duck In the its best hours, knew
its joys and sorrows, its hot passions
and wasted hopes, and will recall the
day and the afternoon that Carter call
ed for his last drink.
When Carter first came to Blue
Duck there were in the town a future
Governor of a State, a future United
States Minister abroad, a coming .ad
viser of presidents, an embryo railway
president and an extheologlcal student,
who later was to control for some time
all the faro layouts of New York city.
Mixed in with these geniuses were cow
boys of Southwestern origin, Nor
wegians and Swedes fresh from Europe,
half-breed Sioux and a few negroes.
The town lay flat, bare, naked on the
plain. There was not a beautiful thing
in it, about it or near it but Carter's
wife, and she was as unapproachable as
Arcturus.
Carter was a graduate of the Uni
versity of Iowa, a descendant of ancient
New England governors and lawmak
ers, a Puritan bred and a scoundrel by
heart. . He appeared in Blue Duck as a
surveyor for the branch line of the
Manitoba road, which was then in
course of construction. His wife did
not come until several months after he
had established the reputation of being
the hardest drinker, foulest-mouthed
gambler and most indecent person be
tween the Missouri and the Red river.
For all his failings, in his best mo
ments he was smooth-tongued, well ed
ucated and an artificial gentleman. It
wl be remembered that he engaged one
afternoon in a discussion with "Gentle
man Ed,", the proprietor of
gambling games of the region
Greek interpretation of the
verse:
"Whosover comcth anything near
unto the tabernacle of the Lord shall
die; shall we be consumed with dying?"
The verse is found in Numbers, and it
has been said by learned men that be
tween the Greek version, the Hebraic
phrasing and the Latin interpreation a
twist has been given to this verse not
intended by the original compiler, who
ever he may have been.
It was a delight to all who under
stood at all and even to many who did
not to listen to these two versatile pin
ners discuss Phoenician of their letters,
neither writing and the values of their
letters, neither willing to finally e.ocerft
the dictum of the other, each recalling
a better day in lives now well mis
spent. It may be here said that the only rea
son Carter was not shot for all his bad
qualities was not due to his learning,
but to the fact that he was the best
man with a single-actor gun on the
range, barring "Gentleman Ed," and
these two had to come together yet.
Mrs. Carter arrived In Blue Duck. We
knew he was coming, for one day Carter
ceased boarding at the Oriental and
threw up a shack on the south border
of the town. As it had two roomsand a
kitchen, it was quite evident he expect
ed the arrival of a woman. When he
announced that his wife was on the way
evrybody felt Interested except "Gentle
man." He told the solitary newspaper
man of Blue Duck: .
"We've got along six months without !
a woman, except those crazy half-
breeds that come here trading, and I i
believe we have a great future before
us if we can keep women out. They i
make trouble."
Still "Ed" was In front of the Oriental
when the stage brought Mrs. Carter,
end she steeped from the box to the
ground and her husband. Blue Duck
gasped after it had given her one look.
Mrs. Carter's attire was quite simple
n s-vflv traveling skirt, a waist and
jacket of dark blue hue, a dark, soft Uwa,
nvital, v,o- wllh a taninli'.iner fppther In I Kent
the band, gauntlet gloves and heavy
walking shoes. Little of that Blue Duck
saw then. -'
What Blue Duck took In with amaze
ment was that shhe was not over 21
(Carter was 40) and straight as an ar
row. Every line of her, form was mold
ed as if a Canova had gone over her
when nature finished its. work. Her
hair was heavy and wavy brown, her
eyes dtep brown, her skin as white as
marble except where slight flushes of
pink revealed the touch of the range
wind. For all this she might have been
marble so far as expression or life of
manner was concerned.
She gave Carter one glance when she
greeted him, and that glance said to
Blue Duck:
"This man Is my husband. The law,
society and everything else hold me to
him. There Is nothing in common be
tween us, but my duty is clear. I wish
no help. Only let me alone and do not
show pity."
Blue Duck understood. Blue Duck
made no comments. If there was one
thing that Blue Duck prided itself on It
was the fact that It never knocked, tat
tled, gossiped. Blue Duck was at the
service of Mrs. Carter from the instant
it set eyes upon her, but Blue Duck
had nothing to say of either of her or
her husband. Only quiet, telephatical
ly. Blue Duck knew before Mrs. Car
tor was a day in the town thnt 1f ever
she needed help "GentlemanEd" would
take the initiative for the honor of the
community. He had said nothing pub
licly, but the night she came when he
was turning into bed he remarked to
the man with him:
"That woman's being crucified."
And the other laconically answered:
"Well?"
After this both slept.
As for Carter, he became meaner,
more vicious, more brutal, after the ar
rival of his wife. Blue Duck soon learn
ed that he struck her: that he finished
his debauches in her presence; that
sometimes she was penniless; that she
never came into town from the shack
. ' '
if she could avoid it; that she often
played the guitar when alone; that she
was fond of books and music, but Blue
Duck held ita peace. It was waiting for
Carter to do some public wrong in con
nection with her.
The wrong come. One afternoon Car
ter stumbled Into the One Dollar cara
vansary, reeled to the bar and with a
gulp announced:
"I'm goin' to take my last drink. I'm
goin' to take it an' then clean out the
town. You hear me? I'm tired of ev
erythin, here, an' I'm going to drop the
liquor, make my mark on you, an' move
on."
He had both his pistols out by this
time, and Blue Duck was politely listen
ing. He straightened up and went on:
"I'm goin' up an' get that woman of
mine, and she's goin' to take my last
drink with me. You wait.
He ga-e his guns a quick flourish and
moved off toward his shack. "Gentle
man Ed" was at the postofflce when he
learned what was about to happen. He
took in the men about him with a com
prehensive roll of his eye.
"She's a woman, boys, and a lady,"
he said.
Figuratively, Blue Duck instantly
placed itself behind him. What he was t
going to do met its approval. He walk
ed down the dusty street towaml the
One Dollar. From the other end of the
street came Carter, his wife walking
ahead of him, one of his guns covering
her, the other sweeping the street. He
literally drove the woman, whose face
was whiter than snow, into the One
Dollar, and shunted to the bartender:
"Two glasses and the liquor."- i
One glass was set before Mrs. Carter
and one before her husband. Then'
through the back door came "Gentle
man Ed," and his hands were working
like chain lightning. His fust shot
broke Mrs. Carter's glass, his second
broke Carter's, and his third killed him.
As for Ed himself, he was shot twice
through the shoulder before Carter
went down, but the wounds were
slight.
A week later it was "Gentleman Ed"
that escorted Mrs. Carter to the south
bound stage and in the name of Blue
Duck said to her:
"Our work Is here; your back in your
old home. If you ever need a friend
and any of us here," indicating the
crowd of bareheaded men, "are on
earth, send for us. Good-by."
In that way Bluck Duck not only be
friended an unhappy woman, but aided
Carter In taking his last drink. H. L.

the town of Port Hope, Canada. He
was born in Dublin in 1820, was educa

he lived a most useful life until his
death In 1S86.
Having an income from the old coun

It is said that, when he was a young

was so deeply impressed with the van

America, England and Germany. Out
of the already extensive monumental
literature, those texts have been care
fully selected which are of real vaule
to students of history, literature, so
clnl science and religion. While no Im
portant inscriptions will be omitted,
duplication will, as far as 'possible, be
avoided. The library will contain
many texts hitherto unpublished.
The volumes will also be supplied
with general introductions gpresentin
historical, literary and other data ne

text.
Each volume, or group of Inscriptions,
has been entrusted to an acknowledged
authority in the department presented.
It will aim to present lucidly and con

! you know that man? What is his name
' and where does he live? I want some
I one to cut wood, and find it difficult to
' get a sober man who will dn such work
faithfully."
"But you can't get that man," was
the reply. "That is Mr. Scrlven. He
won't cut wood for you."
"Why not?" queried the gentleman,
"Because you are able to pay for it.
He saws wood for poor widows and
sick people, and often sends them
wood." i
Upon one occasion he found a family
in the greatest wretchedness, with the
head of the household very 111. Mr.
Scriven paid their rent, got them a
better house, and provided wood and
other necessaries. Then, and not till
then, did he talk religion to them.
Nobody ever suspected that he had
any poetical gift until a short time be
fore his death. A neighbor was sitting
up with him, and while the patient was
asleep accidentally found .a manu
script copy of "What a friend we have
In Jesus!" and read It with great de
light. When Mr. Scriven was ques
tioned about it, he said that he had
composed it for his mother. He had
sent her a copy to comfort her in some
great sorrow, and had kept this copy
for himself, never Intending that any
one else should see it.
Some "time later a Port Hope gentle
man said to him: "Mr. Scriven, it is
said that you composed the hymn,
'What a friend we have in Jeusl' Is it
so?"
He replied, "The Lord and I did it
between us."
The hymn is undoubtedly one thnt

they will imitate the vowel sounds.
Thus different phonetic syllables may
be obtained which may be used to form
an international alphabet.
Another important application of this
synthetic process can be made in the
construction of ear trumpets that will
not fatigue the deaf, because they will
not modify the grouping of oscillation
adapted to the ear. Dr. Marage has also
constructed the "acouometer," giving a
typical sound of tlie vowel "a," for ex
ample, which may be used as a standard
to which certain other sounds may be
referred.
Thus there are far greater possibili
ties for this self-talking machine than
appear from a first glance at it. Now
that it is possible to make exact me

mouth with pliable lips, , perfect teeth,
and all the wonderful inner mechanism,
it will be possible to use these mechan

scale on steamships at night and in
fogs, and many disasters may thereby
be averted.
At present Dr. Marage is engaged In
perfecting his invention and studying

less important part, for in this direc

Invention Which Speaks, Not Merely
Reproduces Speech by Living Lips!
A' remarkable triumph in mechanical
Invention has just been achieved by Dr.
Marage, who has succeeded in con
structing a machine that can utter
plnlnly the five vowels a, e, 1, o, u.
Although many attempts have been
made at this, it is only now that suc
cess has been attained, and before long
we may expect to have a machine that
can really talk.
Of course, the phonograph is not a
talking machine, because It merely
gives off a record that has already been
made upon a cylinder by an actual hu
man voice. Dr. Marage's machine, how
ever, creates th9 vowel sounds at first
hand.
This machine has been constructed so
a.s to reproduce the interior of a per
son's mouth while pronouncing the dif
ferent vowels, using the plastic sub
stance employed by dentists.
These false mouths, as It wore, are
made of plaster of Paris, and are fitted
to sirens giving the appropriate combi
nations of sounds. Dr. Mar.ige then sets
his machine In operation and the vow
els are produced synthetically.
Dr. Marage purposes to modify the
steam sirens used on shipboard so that
Committee Invites Bids for Erection of
Regimental Monument.
Mayor Alexander Harbison, Edmund
D. Riley and Charles Courtice of Hart
ford and Frank Miller of Bridgeport,
the committee of the First Connecticut
Heavy Artillery to secure bids, have
prepared the following letter inviting
bids for the erection of the monument
in this city:
Hartford, Conn, 'i
Dear Sir It is proposed to erect on
the Capitol grounds in this city during
the coming season a monument to the
First Connecticut Heavy Artillery, a
regiment that served from May, 1861, to
September, 1865. As a constituent part
of that monument we have the original
thirteen Inch sea coast mortar that was
used by the regiment in front of Pe
tersburg in 1864, and it is desired that
this shall be the principal feature and
the rest of the monument accessory to
it.
The weight of the mortar Itself Is
about seventeen thousand pounds, and
the wrought Iron carriage, on which it
is mounted, will add, perhaps, four
thousand pounds more. The length of
the carriage is nine feet three inches.
and width over all five feet ten and one-
half inches. From the ground to the
highest point of the mortar when the
same Is elevated at an angle of forty
five degrees (as it should be when In
position) is about live and one-half
feet.
We do not know that you will care to
do so, but If yu wish t submit, with
ut expense to the committee, a design
and bid, the committee will be pleased
to consider the same. In that case the
design must be accompanied with spec
ifications sufficiently full to show what
Is proposed In the way of foundation,
shape and size of stones to be used in
the structure, style of finish and such
other points as will enable the commit
tee to institute intelligent comparison
with other plans that may be submitted.
A sample of the material to be used
must also be furnished.
The price must not exceed fifty-five
hundred dollars, which sum must cover
all charges, Including moving the mor
tar and carriage from the cars in this
city, all excavations, foundations, or
dinary grading in finishing about the
base and aW work necessary to place
the monument in the hands of the com
mittee completely finished and ready
for dedication.
It is desired that some urrangement
be made for drainage through the mon
ument to avoid the discoloration from
rust, 'liable to ccur If drainage is ut
slde. The bid will also specify what
time during the coming season the work
can be completed.
Tlie mortar ana carriage are at
Bridgeport, Conn., where they can be
examined on application to Frank Mil

AUTHORSHIP OF A WELL-KNOWN
HYMN.
Very few hymns have been more
widely published or more frequently
sung than "What u fiiend ve have in
Jesus!" Whenever it is started in
Christian endeavor services or church
prayer-meetings, the people join in the
singing with great heartiness and evi
dent enjoyment. Thousands have been
cheered in time of trouble, and led
nearer to the "Friend that sticketh,
closer than a brother," by this sweet
and simple hymn. It is found in almost
all the hymnals, but in scarcely any of
them is the author's name given. In
some books it is credited to Dr. Hora
tiue Bonar, but as a rule the word '"un
known" appears.
The real author of the hymn was a
humble Christian worker named Joseph
jl ridLis or a
Sickly Mother.
The drugs and medicines and "tonics" frequently
taken by the sickly, overworked mother actually militate
against her strength, for they do not take into account
the fundamental reasons for weakness and nervousness.
What they need is a constant reinforcement of natural
strength. '
They must have the benefit of the food they eat and
they must have perfect rest at night.
The ideal strengthener and sustainer for sickly and
overworked women is the genuine Johann Hoff's Malt
Extract. In it there are no unknown combinations of
drugs, but there are elements which assist natural strength
in every way. For over half a century
Johann Hoff's
Malt Extract
has been doing a glorious work in building up weak
bodies. It makes flesh and blood and makes it in a
natural way through the food you eat. Vou take it with
your mails and the result is the perfect assimilation of
food, so that its nutritive elements are intensified and
show themselves in the strengthening work they do.
Weak and sickly women find the genuine Johann
Hoff's Malt Extract an absolutely efficient help, and by its
use their weakness is turned into strength strength ihtt
is real strength, fortified by the rich blood of health.
These statements are so easily proven that every
woman may test them for a trifle.
Or. E. A. Bartlett of Albany, N. Y. writes: In my practicethe part
winter Johann Hoff's Malt Extract has been almost a "mainstay"
on account of its valuable nutritive qualities. I have used it
many years, but never to more advantage than this year.
Beware of substitutes. Be sure to get the genuine Johata
Hoff's Malt Extract.
