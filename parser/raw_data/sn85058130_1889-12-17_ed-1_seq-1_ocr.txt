Special t THE HERALD Krammer Dispatch
SYRACUSE Dec 1ltTohn McCarthy an
undertaker of this city has just returned
turned from a trip to the Samoan islands
in the Pacific ccean where he went to re
cover the body of Chief Engineer George
W Hall of the United States steamer Nip
sic He tells a thrilling story of adventure
and brings back information reflecting on
the naval squadron in those waters which
he intends t formally bring t the notice
of Secretary Tracy Engineer Hall whose
wife lives here died in the Samoan archi
pelago June 18 last under mysterious
circumstances McCarthy refused pres
ent t divulge what ho has learned but it
is inferred that the dead engineer was
abandoned on the most desolate island
of Tutulla while deathly sick through
some disagreement with his commanding
officer Engineer Hall had served his term
in the navy and when he died he was on
his way home retire on a pension and
McCarthy says that Chief Engineer Gowan
of the United States steamer Alert on his
return will give startling facts in this
frightful case of cruelty The abandon
ment of Hall to his hard fato also involves
the steamship Zelandia owned by Claus I
Spreckels whose commanding officer
refused to stop at Tutulia although
< knowing of Halls predicament
McCarthy told Spreckels of this when he
got back to San Francisco Spreckels said
that the report he received was that there
was a storm and manofwar could not
be sent He also said that the United
States government had not acted fairly in
paying the English government 3000 more
to carry the sailors wrecked at Apia home
than his vessels would have done it for He
said further that he was not paid for carry
ing the mails which however his steam
ships usually do from the Samoan group
McCarthy recovered the body getting it
safely t Honolulu and expressed it home
In relating his experience ho said
tVT Having secured a metallic casket and embalm
T ing material at San Franelco I saw Claus
Spreckels the great sugar king and arranged
j 1 with him to hip the casket by his steamer the
i Zealandia which I was to meet at Honolulu and
so on to Tutulla He agreed to land me there
and bring mo back for O hal of which was for
my own passage f 200 for the body In addition
I paid 1H l for the passage of my wife to Hono
lulu We left San Francisco September 14 on
the steamer Australia We landed at Malluka
in the Sandwich islands There Heft Mrs Mc
Carthy and took the steamer Zealandie a few
days later which had on board the casket em
balialng fluid and other things necessary for the
duty I had to perform I was a question at that
time whether 1 could be landed in Leon bay in
which i situated the island of Tutulla The re
ceipt for my passage read that I was to be
landed there t practicable This was to guard I
against rough weather reaching Leon bay at i
night or other possible contingencies Tutuila
i not a regular port The United States govern I
ment vessels meet steamers there and get mall I
but a landing can be mado only in small boat
Claus Spreckels had told me that he thought I
would get through all right as trouble was ex
p silenced but once so far as he could remember
Hall left there to die
that was when poor Hal was lef ther
At that time Spreckels said there was a heavy
sea and i was Impossible to stop At least that
ras the report made to him I was sick five of
the seven days ft took to get from Malluka to
Leon bay When I was able to get on deck one
of the officers of the essel told me I was all
right i we got to Leon bay in day time but i
we got there at night I might be taken on to
Australia and not get home till spring My
chances of landing would be better on another
ship he said than on the Zealandiabecauso the
captain of our vessel was cruel and knocked na
tives from his ship They were afraid of him or
anyone on his ship Sometlmeshe said the
natives tried t get on board the ship he would
order their hands cut with knives and let them
drop Into the sea I had been told at Honolulu
tat the captain was cruel I was
In constant dread that ho would do
somettlnj to prevent me from gctt ng off
Finally 1 met the captain and asked him what
my chances were t be landed at Tutulla He
4L repliedln a gut way that they were not good
t that I might have t go to Australia I told him
the family of Hall had desired me to ask him
hT why he didnt stop there in June and take Hall
off the Inland He said that he had made
his report to the proper authorities that I could
ace that i I wanted t when I got back to San
Francisco i I ever did get back I told him
that the family blamed him for Halls death He
replied that he could not help that He Is a
German and one ofthe cruellest menl oversaw
I asked him how I was toJ leave his vessel at
Leon bay and get to Ttula He said he didnt
know unless we met a United States ship A
little sailing ressel he said came from Apia for
the mal but took no freight I asked him how
long It would take me to get aboat Irjin the na
tives He said about an hour I think I asked
him i he would wait that hour until I could get
a boat i case I had to He said he would not
as the Australian government would fine him
1C an hour for every hour he was late I told
him that would willlnglypay the fine whatever
It might amount to if ho would only agree to
J consent He refused and seemed to be overjoyed
at my predicament I tell you i I ever prayed
In all my life i was that day and night
that wo might reach Lion bay In the day timer
Well on Sunday morning hightcd Leon bay
and there was the United States manofwar
Adams When wo got near an onlcor came on
board our ship I showed him my papers and
iIw
tgi
told him that I was after Halls body This of
ficer paid no attention t me Why I probably
will never understand I supposed that i I met
an officer of an American manof war and ex
plained my errand that 1 would be given all the
assistance possible but i was not gven We for
tunately hail on board the Zealandia the gov
ernor of Australia and his suit and the captain
did not therefore dare display so much of his
temper toward the natives as usuaL Several
thorn got aboard the ship offering curiosities for
sale I ran to them offering them gold and try
Ing to make them understand G n4e to get
ashore When the United States officer saw
how determined I was he told me he would take
me off The casket and other things were low
ered Into the boat and I reicheilthe manofwar
1 all right Lieutenant Commander Wood
worth was In charge owing to the ab
sence of tho commander who was sick
and had gone away for a rest
Lieutenant Wcudworlh said hj was bound for
Apia ana asked where I was going I offered
him my papers t look over hut Le refused
read them and insisted upon my telling where I
was goirg and what brought me to that part of
the world Finally ho looked carelessly at my
papers alter I had forced them upon him I
then explained ay mission Ho gave me so
little encouragement that I talked with a
sailor Ho told mo that some of tho
natives would take me t Leon bay
nine mllea off for II I agreed t
pay that amount We lowered the casket cask
of embalming fluid and other things Into a small
boat The casket fell Into inc sea and would
have been lost had it not been that It
had been pecked fo that it would float
This frightened the natives and It was only af
Ti
tee a struggle that I got them to help get In into
the oat 1 There was a priest on board from
Pago Iago Ho told me that the priest at
Tutulla was French and knew very little Eng
Hah so he gave me a letter to him explaining
my mission Finally the manof war went eight
miles Into the bay and tho natives towed mo f

A GENERAL FAST DAY
GENRA
I is announced tat the first presidency
of the Mormon church have designated
December 23the anniversary of the birth
of the Prophet Joseph Smithas a day of
fasting and prayer when all the Latter
day Saints throughout these mountains
are requested to join in supplicating the
Lord on that day for His holy spirit t
be poured out in great power upon His
servants and all the saints as a witness
that He is still with them Also that the
enemies of Zion may be confounded in their
wiced works and designs and that the
hearts of the rulers and people of this na
tion may be softened t the end that they
maybe induced to deal justly and merci
fully with the saints and be willing to
hear our cause and grant to us those rights
and privileges which belong to citizens who
are true to the constitution and institu
tions of the United States
The fast is t commence at sundown on
the 22d and to continue until sundown of
the 2Sd and it is expected that the mem
bers of the church will have special prayer
meetings at home and in their ward as
semblies
In this city i i recommended that in
addition to the regular meetings on Sun
day evening the 22d inst morning and
afternoon meetings be held on the 23rd
and that in the early morning and between
the meetings on that day prayer meetings
be held in the places specially set apart far
that object
The notice says it is to be hoped that all
business places conducted or controlled by
members of the church will be closed on
the SOd inst so that persons employed
there may be free to fast and pray and at
tend the meetings that will be convened
This is an important matter and the re
sults that will surely acre will be of
vastly more value than gold and silver and
any material interests that may be in
volved
Through inquiries among the leading
Mormon merchants it has been learned that
they will generally keep their stores closed
on the day named It is also understood
name aso
that there will be a general suspension of
business by Mormons on Monday
Whateer besides you chance t want
Neer fall short of Sozodont
But keep it always in your sight

To cleanse your teeth ife with your smile
The most fastidious you beguile

THE CELEBRATED CRONIN CASE
Finally Closes What Judge McConnell Says
Abont the Verdict Kunze Cries Burke
eems Welllleased
We11lease t
Cnicaco Dec 160ne of the most
memorable trials in the criminal history of
America closed this afternoon when the
jury impenneled three months ago ren
dered its verdict in the Cronin case That
return of this jury with a verdict and not
a disageement is a source of much con
gratulation to the public mind and although
though there is naturally much division of
sentiment on the question of an approval
of the verdict the sense of relief which is
experienced at tho linal culmination of the
case is unanimous However bitter toomay
have been the feelings engendered by the
two factions into which the Irish people
have been divided in the case it cannot
fail t beta source of congratulation to
Judge McConnell that his impartial con
duct as presiding judge has been such as
to winfor him not only the applause of
both of these opposing factions but the
approval alikeof the leadine lurist of the
land upon the validity of i rulings As
the court convened at 2 p m he received
the verdict of the jury There was a
momentary silence a the vast audience
breathlessly awaited the first words of
Judge McConnell as he mounted the
bench
bncl
The jury is prepared to make a return
in this case said his honor But I ob
serve that Mr Donohuo counsel for OSul
livan and Kunze is absent
have been requested t represent Mr
Donahue sad Mr Foreestl
The court announced his satisfaction
with this arrangement and a moment later
the door leading from the jail opened and
the five defendants marched in to receive
the announcement of their fate Hardly a
sound dindant every eye in the audi
ence turnc4 toward John F Begge who
le the piossion The face of the senior
guardian Camp 20 was pale and anxious
looking but ho faced the stare of the au
dience boldly Daniel Coughlin affected
his usual indifference but his restless
furtive eye d oted terrible mental sus
pense the ex elective experienced as he
awaited the dreadful announcement
Hardly a person in the court room suc
ceeded in catching the eye of Pat
rick OSullivan His looks were
directed toward the floor and
whatever emotion he may have felt
at this critical moment was not shown
Martin Burkes face flushed for a moment
as he his seat but
approached h immediately
after his features regained their natural
expression and with an affected nonchal
ance he resumed the chewing of gum as
has been his wont during the gm the
trial For the first time since his arrest
the little German John Kunze seemed to
appreciate the gravity of his situation and
his usual air of Jauntiness j was absent As
the audience were contemplating the
prisoners and commenting upon their de
meanor a noise of many footsteps was
again suddenly heard without and a mo
ment later ihs twelve men in whoso judg
ment reposed the lives of th defendant i I
entered the room headed by Foreman
Clarke Every person simultaneously
turned his eyes upon the jurors as i to read
in their impassive features the secret of the
verdict but there was no sign to give them
hope or fear I
The clerk will call the roll of jurors
Every person in the audience tart as
the sound of the judges voice broke the
silence only to add a deeper awe to the sol
emnity of the occasion Slowly the jur i
ors answered to their names and the
twelve men were announced be present
Gentlemen said the court I under
stand you have reached a conclusion in this
I case With a bow Foreman Clarke took
from his pocket a large envelone and
handed it to the judge who in turn handed
it to the clerk
The clerk will read the verdict said
the court Instantly a hush so profound
that as the clerk tore open the envelnpe
the sound fell discordantly upon the anx
ious ears I A moment later this anxiety
became painful in its intensity as the so
norous voice of the clerk began reading the
verdict of the jury as follows
We the jury find the defendant John F
Bepga not guilty
We the jury find the defendant John Kunze
guilty manslaughter as charged In the in
dictment Jjnd fix his punishment at imprison
ment info penitentiary for the term of three
years 3
We life jury find the defendants Daniel
Coughlln Patrick QSulliran and Martin Burke
guilty of murder in the manner and form as
charged in the indictment and fix the penalty
at Imprisonment in the penitentiary for the
term of their natural lives
At the request of the defense the jury
was then polled and reaffirmed their ver
dict Simultaneous with the
Simultneous wih announce
ment of the vprdict Coughlin OSullivan
and Burl bed deathly pale while
Kunze sin iddenly from his seat and
a moment lat dropped his head upon his
breastand b st into tears Beggs face
was luminous with joy and immediately
after tho polling of tho jury he arose from
amid the prisoners walked over to the jury
box and during the breathless lull that
followed shook Foreman Clarks hand
lieartily and said Gentlemen I thank
you I trust the future may confirm your
judgment upon me and that you will never
regret that you found men not guilty of
this terrible cnarge
The only sound that broke the stillness
following this was the deep sobs of little
Kunze He burst out with God knows I
am innocent I never was in Lakeview
that 0 God knows
night I am innocent
gentlemen
OSullivan was the only one of the other i
three prisoners who found refuge in tears
For a moment they tnckltd down his
cheeks but a minute later his black eyes
lashed with defiance of revival of courage
and dashing his hand across his brow he
braced up In his seat and cast a longing
glance around the court room The only
evidence of terror to be perceived in
Coughlin was the incereased pallor that
overspread his face as he fully realized the
significance of the sentence to life impris
onment and his lips twitched nervously
during the coHoquy that followed between
the attorney and the court relrtive to a
motion for anew trial
Martin Burke was unquestionably the
least afiected of all the prisoners His
usually florid face took on a slight pallor as
the verdict was announced but a moment
later his laws again began a methodical
mastication of gum as regularly as at any
previous time during the trial
As the verdict was announced and the
large audience contemplated little Kunzes
grief Beggs turned a reporter and said
Its a shame t sentence Kunze poor little
Fellow I think he is n innocent a I am
Its a d shame to send him to the penitentiary
entiary for three years He had no more
idea of being found guilty than you had
The comments among the audience were
various Both Irish factions were well
represented and naturally took opposite
aews Cronins friends were indignant at
the verdict Its a shame said Hon P
W Dunne shame and a travesty upon
justice His sentiment found an echo
from a dozen Irishmen near him while
only a dozen feet away the members of
other factions were congratulating them
selves and the prisoners that the verdict
was no worse and tho friends of Beggs
were elbowing their way through to grasp i
the hands of the senior guardian of Camp
2 in felicitation upon his exoneration
Forrest on behalf of the four convicted
defendants entered accustomed motion i
for a new trial After considerable dis
cussion the judge fixed January 13 a tho
day on which the motion for a new trial
would be argued and the prisoners were
taken back t jail Kunze was still crying
and went out of doors with tears running
down his face and still muttering and sob
bing to himself Burke followed Kunze
and as he passed he whispered to Forrest and
smiled He seemed entirely unconcerned
OSullivan followed looking pale and
sallow but different from his usual ap
pearance Coughlin was the last of the
prisoners to leave and as he stalked out he
half turned and looked back into the court
room as i expecting to find some friend
The door clanged behind the bailiff who
bronght up the rear and the Cronin trial
was over
Itjwas not until afternoon today that the
jury finally came t a verdict and then it
was that Juror Culver who had been vot
ing for acquittal for all the defendants
since the jury went out consented to com
promise The other jurors were for hang
ing Burke Coughlin and OSullivan while
he was for letting them all off Culver fin
ally agreed to a life sentence for the three
The jury was practically unanimous on tho
subject of Beggs acquittal and but little
time was needed to fix Kunzos term
What do you think of the verdict
judge asked an Associated Press repre
sentative of Judge McConnell after the
adjournment of the court for the day
Judicially of course I can pass no opin
ion upon the verdict As an individual
however and without being cognizant of
the proceedings in the jury room I might
say Lthink the verdict is tho result of the
objection of some of the jury to the death
penalty on circumstantial evidence
Mr Culver probably
No not Mr Culver necessarily I un
derstand ho was in favorof acquittal from
the start It only after
strt I was afer a Ions and
harrassing deliberation that he finally
agreed with the rest upon this verdict You
will probably find that Mr Culver was not
the only man upon the jury who was op
posed to the banging of the three principal
defendants But the jurors all swore on
a
being examined a to their competence
that they had no conscientious scruples
against capital punishment or circumstantial
crcumstn
tial evidence That is all true but behind
all this each man probably had a mental reservation
servation that the evidence must be con
vincing beyond n reasonable doubt Now
if some of theso men should think there
was even the faintest shadow of a doubt as I
to the guilt of these three men do you not
see how natural it would be for them to i
mentally compromise the matter with their I
consciences no matter how conclusive
heir judgmentmight by favoring life
imprisonment in lieu of the death penalty
all because the casewas once clrcumstan
ialevidence
I believe you feel relieved that there
has not been a disagreement
I do most assuredly Although if the
jury had disagreed and it became necessary
to try the case again I should not have
ld hde

again
About 4 oclock an Associated Press rep
resentative went t the jail and found rep
four convicted defendants out in the cor
ridor with the other inmates taking their
usual exercise before supper Kunze
seemed to hold himself apart from the
other prisoners and remained in his cell
refusing to be comforted in his misfortune
3oughlin and OSullivan were at the
Coughln OSulvan en
trance of the cage discussing the case
with a couple of the members of Camp 20
who had called to offer their sym
pathy or congratulation who knows
which At the approach of a Press
reporter they became silent
I am sorry to disappoint you said
Coughlin courteously but T do not want
to be interviewed1
But what is of the
your opinion ver
dict
I am afraid I shall have to refer you to
Mr Forrest my attorney for an answer to
that question
Are disappointed at the verdict
Well I suppose no man regards the ver
dict of life imprisonment with any partic
ular enthusiasm said the exdetective
grimly but really gentlemen I must de
line to be interviewed
With this sentence Coughlin retired
pleasantly bowing good evening as ho went
I was evident to all that the prisoner was
in a mood very nearly of elation and to
Dan Coughlin at least the verdict was a
source of selfcongratulation His habitual
mood during his confinement of the past
six months has been one of taciturnity
but this evening a bright smile illumined
his face and his step was light and buoy

In the boys department Martin Burke
was found walking up and down and smok
ing a cigar Ho seemed entirely composed
and good natured as ho greeted the Asso
ciated Press reporter
Well Burke what do you think of it1
Oh I am not saying a word said the
young Irishman The Chicago papers
have had enough to say about me already
and I dont want to give any excuse for
gve
any more
But dont include us in your gen
eral damnation
Im not damning the papers said
Burke Ive nothing them but I guess
gess
they can get along withont me
Al efforts extract any comments from
Burke on the verdict was in vain He ex
pressed himself as being delighted to con
verse on that he termed social topics
Bnt on this other business as he called it
with 1 jerk of his head toward the court
room he was as dumb as an oyster
After the jury was discharged this after
noon and while the gentlemen were wait
ing for their certificates 1 crowd of re
porters besieged them for information
about what had transpired in the jury
room and tho cause of the long delay I
is no use said Juror Manor wo agreed
not to say anything From what I have
heard since I got back into the world the
newspapers have been doing some pretty
tall lying Juror Culver was not the cause
of the delay and there wasn t any unpleas
mtnesi tor any knock down as one paper
has declared Juror North was angry at
the statement mentioned above The
man who wroto the story of a row in tho
jury room ought be punished said he
There was no trouble at all and we
passed the time a pleasantly as we could
under the circumstances

mont of the last Congress proceedings had
been taken in the United States court in
his state relating to matters of current
report in the district he represented
Inasmuch as those proceedings
seemed to him to be conclusive
md as the court was one not organized by
his party or any member of his party but
was throughout its whole organization a
Republican court it had appeared to him
hat the proprieties of the case demanded
that the initiative should be taken by the

he action of the committee on elections

of inquiry that was proper to the jurisdic
