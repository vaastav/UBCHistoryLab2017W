Tho tarllT commission has surprised both

report proposing no material chango oxcept
in methods lias been constantly and confi
dently predicted by its foes Kvcn its friends
havo hardly expected that its plan would
provo strong wise aud bold enough to form
tho safest basis of action for a national party
lint tho report is a bravo and honest eflort to
do just what thb needs and interests of tho
country demand Inasmuch as no party can
hope to succeed unless It does or honestly trios
to do this tho report Is wlso for tho Republi
can party as well as wlso for thocountry If It
bo adopted by tho Republicans they will stand
amply vindicated on this issuo whether Demo
cratic partisanship defeats action or not and if
enacted Into law it will greatly promote tho
public prosperity Yet thoaction of tho com
mission lias been so just so freo from parti
sanship or sectional or personal prejudice and
so manifestly designed to promototho best in
terests of tho country that its report Is unani
mous as to essentials four members dissenting
only ns to tho retention of duplicate duties on
woollens and party distinctions being obvi
ously and absolutely ignored in tho deolslou
of Its members What seems best for tho
wholo country to such a commission acting
in tills spirit Is likely to ho tho thing which
on tho wholo ought to bo done and members

Tho wholesome rebuke administered by tho
President to official sympathizers with tho
star route thioves Is produoing excellont io
suits already It is simply amusing to notice
how mauy understrappers whoso names havo
never been heard outside of tholr respective

durations that they always were satisfied that
Dorsoy Brady and evory other man who ever
saw tho post office aro a set of double dyed
villains scoundrels and thioves nnd that
everything they havo said and every lcttor
they havo written has leilcctcd tho slncoro
belief that they ought each separately to bo
drawn nnd quartered Notwithstanding all
theso clovcnth hour conversions to tho policy
of tho government It is not to bo expected
that all havo been removed who ought to ho

no ueoms wiso in mo uircctiou ot reconcilia

Tho presldont of tho Independent club in
this city moro frank as a man than prudent
as a politician has frequently voiced tho
leal sentiments of the faction which that club
is intended to pcrpetuato Let us know
what Arthur wants let us kuow what men

direction his policy Is to lie and wo will
support tho men aud tho measures that ho
does not support This is tho Independ

rial action of tho Presidents is criticised
At somo time Mr Arthur has crossed the po
litical path of tho leaders In this
penueut movement no lias prcvcntcil ono
of them from shoving himself forwnrd as n

thwarted tho schemes of this eager politician

or neglect For this reason is ho constantly
reminded when ho does what is manifestly
right that ho is only following tho examplo
of his lamented predecessor and when ho fails
to do what tho llalf Brccds want him to do is
ho condemned for leaving the lamented Gar

perhaps whoso services cannot bo spared with
out detriment to the publio service aud this

for their friends first and then enforce a rule
that tho good officials should bo kept in
their rcspectlvo official positions Wo despiso
swindling and hypocrisy no mnttor in what
shupo or form or party and thereforo wo
detest also tuat virtuous swiuuio wuun sinco
Mr Hayes was counted into tho Presidential
chair was practlicd by him and his hypocriU
leal associates and It is all moonshine if ouo
party attempts to make tho other bell eve that
they would not uso an eventual victory to
reward their party friends with public offices
And it is but natural that as long as this
country is governed by parties every ono
of them endeavors to exercise the pub
lic power through their own friends
uud to contlnuu iu power ns long as
possible This has hoen m voguo at all times
nud everywhere and if even kings and princes
havo not dcatcd from this rule why should
it lio otherwise iu other countries where dis
tinct parties of different political views mid
principles fight tho samo battles Whether
tho Lancasters or tho Yurks whether Valols
or Bourbon Welf or Wiiiblingen or as it was
during thu last century luHwodaiOhatsorcaps
fight among themselves to get Into aud keep
in power Every ono of them when in power
endeavored to keep tho other down and to
prevent tho outs from getting iu it was
the tight for power with no sentimentality
either And it is exactly tho samo light iu u
republican State or iu a union of icpublican
States and whoever leceives and accepts an
ofllco from uuy iwrty and believes ho will bo
or hopes to bo kept iu ofllco under another
party is u foul
The number of surh fools however Is com
paratively small much smaller than our civil
service reformers Imagine Hojv could it lib
large when the perpetual elections demon
strate tho fact that tho people themselves
chose their olllceri regardless of their fitness
and capability solely mi account of their po
litical belief and scntlmuitHr All ourpolitl
calstiugglcs In legard to electing administra
tive and judicial otllceis aro niero mockery ut
tho Idea of tho so called elvil servico reform
If the people reward to day tills ono nnd to
luol row another ono with an nlllte which gives
employment to fiftv or a hundred clerks Jan
Iturs iiiessjniin ixcwlmt else can bo expect
ed than that such tin officer surrounds himself
with subordinates ol ills own political creed
when they helped him to gctt he offico
It is nonsense to feel sorry about this stale of
affairs or to point ut the good old times
under John Qulncy Adams Tho publioscr
vico of thoso days was of no great account for
the reason that tho administration of tho
whole couutry sixty years ago was not half as
important as thatot the State of New York

Tho charitable of this city contrlbuto overy

postors or iu over relief to souie whllo others
obtain nothing Iiidisciiminutoalms glvlug
without inquiry oiieouiuges professional
begging uud impostors and It is manifest that
tho money thus distributed could bo much
better employed If given only to thoso whom
actual investigation shows to ho entitled to
aid
Tho Associated Charities of this city was
organized with tho purpose of aiding tbo
destitute while checking tho operations of
Impostors and if thoso who wish to aid tho
lieedy would mako uso of this association In
their efforts they would bo much moio cer
tain of ellecting tholr purposo than by follow
ing ordinary plans of distribution
The society lias been in opeiation but one
year somo of the subdivisions aro uot yet in
perfect working order nnd owing to lack of
experience aud tno need ot trained visitors
all tho opeiatlons may not bo as wisely
dhected as is desirable yet with theso impei
fectlons tho society aflords much bettor menus
of distinguishing between true and falso pov
eity and of finding out tho needs of tho poor
who will not beg than anything yet piovided
better lesultswill follow with greater expe
rience
The results effected by tho society will do
pond to a great degree upon tho uso mado of
it by tho public Every ease repotted is in
vestigated by a visitor and when iid can bo
given by or through existing institutions the
matter is rcfened to tliem Every eflort is
made to avoid giving alms and by ailvico uud
assistance to put the puor in the way of earn

destitute preventing them from degeneiiiting
