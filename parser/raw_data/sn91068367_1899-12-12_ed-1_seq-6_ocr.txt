TOBACCO GROWEIW' CONVENTION
Steps for Forming an AHsocIatlon lor
Their Protection.
(Special to the Messenger.)
Raleigh, N. C, December 6. The
.North Carolina Tobacco Growers' Con
vention was called to order by Com
missioner of Agriculture Patterson,
who said the condition of affairs was
f peculiar, and the problems confronting
tobacco industry very serious. The
crop of 1899 sold for about 20 per cent,
less than that for six years before.
.The price for tobacco is lower, while
production is smaller, and there 4s no
decrease in demand, so the price does
not follow the usual laws of suppply
.and demand.
Joel B. Phillips, of Nash, was elect
ed chairman. The suggestion by him
that there be an adjournment until
March was opposed.
James F. Jordan, who has been in the
Vob-acco business at Greensboro sixteen
years, bitterly denounced the American
"Tobacco Company, saying year by year
It forced prices down. He also de
nounced the Dukes, of Durham, saying
they gave to Trinity college nearly $100.
000 of which farmers had been despoil
ed. He suggested as a remedy the
Wolding of county conventions to elect
delegates to the general convention of
tobacco growers from North Carolina,
Virginia, east Tennessee and South
Carolina; also that at each market
there be two leaf buyers, and farmers
have two representatives. It will take
$7,000,000 to handle the crop, but money
can be h'ad easily, if farmers will enter
Into iron-clad contracts to sell to
warehouses established under their
management.
A recess was taken until tonight, and
a committee, with John S. Cunning
ham as chairman, was appointed to
draft a plan for the sale of leaf to
bacco. lAt the night session it was decided
lo hold a state convention, with fivt
delegates from each county, at Ral
eigh on the evening of January 17th.
It was fretfly said tihaJt organization
alone was necessary and thalt then the
formieirs could build factories and man
ufacture tobacco. There was some hint
at a secret organization, but this was
redicuted and it was declared that the
only way to fight the American Tobac
co Company was face to face. It was
car.iii tviot t was not the DUX
iUl LHCl .'Li 1 VA.u-w - .
pose 'to array iiuui aBunsi ..."'f
to unite ais one man against the com
pany. It was set forth in resolutions adop
ted that the price of leaf tobacco has
been so forced down by the trust as to
leave no profit to the growers and that
the purpose of the state convention is
to divise the plan to raise prices.
The county meetings to select dele
gates are to be hald January 1st.
HOUSES AND THINGS.
There are heroes and heroes. The
Richmond Dispatch has resurrected
the record of some meetings of the
Richmond city council, held during the
war between the states, and some cor
respondence growing out of some of the
proceedings, whichhave a peculiar in
terest just at this time. It appears
that at a meeting of the council in
question on the 9th of November, 1863,
Mr. James A. Scott, one of its mem-
. bers, offered a resolution, which was
adopted, appropriating $60,000 "for the
. purchase of a house and lot to be ten
dered to General Robert E. Lee and
family, free of rent," and that at a
subsequent meeting of the council Mr.
Scott read the following letter and re-
. quested that it be spread upon the min
utes, which was done, and its request
complied with:
Headquarters
Army Northern Virginia,
November 12, 1863.
To the President of the City Council,
Richmond, Va.:
Sir My attention has been directed
to a resolution reported in the news
papers as having been introduced into
the body over which you preside, hav
ing for its object the purchase by the
city of Richmond of a house for the
use of my family. I assure you, sir,
that no want of appreciation of the
honor conferred upon me by this reso
lution or insensibility to the kind
feeeling which prompted it, induces me
to ask, as I most respectfully do, that
no further proceeedings be taken with
reference to the subject. The house
is not necesssary for the use of my
family and my own duties will prevent
my residence in Richmond. I should,
therefore, be compelled to decline the
generous offer, and trust that whatever
means the city council may have to
spare for this purpose may be devoted
to the relief of the families of our sol
diers in the field, who .are more in need
of assistance and more deserving of it
than myself.'
I have the honor to be, very respect
fully, . Your obedient servant,
R. E. LEE. General.
Richmond Pearson Hobson has fallen
into some disfavor because he allowed
too many women to kiss him In public;
and yet it is recalled in this connection
that after his performance at Santiago
his neighbors at Greensboro, Ala.,
sprung a project to raise money to lift
a mortgage on his father's house, but
that the young man said No; he would
pay off the mortgage himself, which
he has done, and in addition to which
he is educating a younger sister at one
of the best schools at the south.
But this is enough to say, for com
parisons are odious. Charlotte Ob

REVOLUTION IN GUATEMALA.
Washington, December 6. The sec
retary of state has received a tele
gram from Mr. Hunter, minister to
Guatemala, saying that he has been
informed by that government that on
the 2nd Instant, General Toledo, with
about 300 followers, principally for
eigners, attempted a revolution near
the border of Salvador at a place call
ed Juliapa. They were attacked by
government troops and driven across
the border with heavy loss. The min
ister . says that all other departments
are reported quiet.

GERMANY PLEASED
At the Friendly Sentiments Expressed
in McKinley's Message.
Berlin, December 6. The German
government and press almost unani
mously welcome President McKinleys
message to congress. Even the. agra
rian papers, always opposed to -things
American, grudgingly admit that the
message is fair and honest. The drift
of private comment is virtually the
fame. In the lobby of the reichstag
today similar sentiments .were ex
pressed without reserve by members
of every shade of political conviction.
Emperor William, it is reliably re
ported, had a long consultation this af
ternoon with Count von Buelow, the
foreign minister, and expressed him
self as very much pleased with Presi
dent McKinley's attitude toward Ger
many. Count von Buelow authorized the
Associated Press correspondent In Ber
lin to send to the United States the
following as his impression of the
message:
"Count von Buelow regards 'the
message as an enunciation" memorable
In the development of German-American
.friendship. The warm tone in
which the president speaks of our mu
tual relations has created here the
best impression and one may be sure
that the sympathy exhibited by the
president for Germany is here sin
cerely reciprocated. Politically, ev
erything between the two countries is
serene and there is nothing that dis
trubs the entente cordiaie. Economi
cally considered, the contents and tone
of the message strengthen the hope
that the United States, with their in
creasing exports to Germany, will
make fair concessions to Germany's
trade and tha the reciprocity negotia
tions will be further conducted in a
friendly spirit to a good end."
The press particularly rejoices at
the announcement regarding alliances,
despite many previous asserverations
to the same effect.
Shot Wife and Mother-In-Law.
XJthonia, Ga.t December 6. Hiram
Sharp shot and killed his wife and
wounded his mother- in law here to
day. Family trouble was the cause.
Sharp and hiis wife had been married
twenty years. Sharp escaped into the
woods and a party of citizens headed
by the sheriff and posse have started
in pursuit.
It is understood there had been an
estrangement of several years' exist
ence between Siharp and his wife. A
short time ago s"he left him, after a
bitter quarrel, but she returned and
since they have been living together
at their country home.

Fiscal Year Ending .luae :;ir.2i, ISiJI.
The annual report upon the Tmprcve
ment of certain rivers 'and harbor? In
Nortfh . Carolina, issued by the United
States chief of engineers for 1S99 vas
received yesterday. It gives an 'ex
haustive report of the projects and
work done under the supervision of
the United States Engineer office in
WThnington, which includes practical
ly all tihe rivers and seacoast of East
ern (Carolina.
That part of the report of Captain
E. W. VanCourt Lucus relative to the
improvements of the Cape Fear river
at and Below Wilmington will be of
especial interest to Wilmingtonitns.
It is as follows:
IMPROVEMENTS OF CAPE FEAR
RIVER.
The work of tine last fiscal year has
been carried on by hired labor and use
of the United States plant. It has con
sisted of the work of the suction dredge
Cape Fear and clam shell dredge AJix,
making minor surveys and repairing
and watching plant, details of which
are given in the accompanying report
of Assistant Engineer Cnarles Hum
phreys, in locail charge.
The pile training wall at Snows
marsh, while gradually deteriorating,
has been effective throughout the yeaa
in maintaining a good channel across
this formerly most troublesome shoal.
When "the mud builkiheads at the ends
of the cut have been removed, proba
bly during Che coming winter, this
training wall, if maintained, will hold
the depth without further dredging. It
is a mcst useful and effective work.
Whether or not the uper parts of the
braining wall will have to be repJaced
as destroyed by worms, and whether
or not tihe lower part, which the bank
ed sand protects from 'the worms, will
alone prove efficient, are questions that
can not yet be determined, but even if
the training wiali has to be renewed
every few years it will be at an expense
qui'le small as compared wi'tih that of
the constant redredging which had to
be resorted to before the training wall
was built.
The experience Of neiairty five years
wi'tih this training wall seems to indi
cate that i'ts construction and mainten
ance costs less than the interest on the
cost of a stone training wall, witih the
further advantage that it can be easily
taken out or its position altered if
found expedient ox disiraMe. A map
showing the condition of this shoal tin
August last is appended.
The bar channel, after some deterior
ation due to the absence last summer
of the suction dredge at Fernandina,
has been again deepened to 20 feet or
more, with a least widtih of 180 feet.
It is expected that thie full project
width Of 270 feet can be obtained and
maintained during the coming year,
but this clan only be done by thie con
stant use otf the dredging steamer
whenever the weather permits. The
work of maintaining the project chan
nel depth and width across this bar is
about the limit of her capacity.
As noted in the accompanying report
(of Assistant Engineer Humphreys, the
channefl at the throat of the inlet has
been moving bodily eastward for some
yeairs, due to the erosion of Bald Heau
point, uiii.il uie o;u woou-buay Jetty,
which formerly marked . the end of
Bald Head point, is now well in the
chamneQ, the centre of which is ap
proaching it. If every injurious de
terioration is to be avoided i't appears
centain that some meUica for stopping
this erosion at Blald Head point must
be adopted in the near fututre. For
the purpose of making an intelligent
study of this question a survey of this
part of the river has just been made,
a map of which is herewinh appended,
and a speciaH report on the subject will
be submitted as soon as practicable.
The dredge cuts in the river are being
maintained fairly well, excepting ait
Lilliput and Brunswick Cove shoals.
The filling m at Lilliput is thought to
be due to the ebb current from the
west of Big island, while that at Bruns
wick Cove ds almost certainly due to
its position west of the natural line
of tidal flow. A series of current ob
servations are contempflated at these
localities for the purpose of determin
ing the cause of undue deterioration
and ascertaining, if possible, a remedy
for it.
A feature of the work on this river
has been the notable success of the
use of plant owned by the government.
The clam she'll dredge Ajax, with tug
and scows, was purchased two years
ago, and, although laid up for several
months last summer, when the tug was
needed for submarine minting work,
this plant has done an amount of
dredging which, at the average con
tract price since 1890 of 13.1 cents per
yaird, would have cost $177,139.72. Dur
ing the same time the total expendi
tures for purchase, maintenance, run
ning expenses, etc., has been $134,789.43
in addition. Considering as assets the
supplies on hand at the end of the fiscal
year, the excess earnings amounted to
nearly $50,000.
, This work has been in charge of As
sistant Engineer Charles Humphreys,
and under his effective management is
becoming a model of its kind.
The "money statement" showing ex
; - t-.-s fn- nir v ork sh-vg 3 nsh
balance available July 1st, 1899 of $183,
134.69 and recommends that $250 000
can be profitably expended in the fiscal
year ending June 30th, 1901. sd a so
$35,000 for maintenance of improvement
during the same period.
CAPE FEAR IMPROVEMENTS
ABOVE WILMINGTON.
' Concerning the improvement of the
Cape Fear above Wilmington the re
port says:
"Little ' work was dome during the
year because oT the small balance
available, and many obstructions ac
cumulated in tlhe channel. After the
appropri atkm of March 3, 1899, became
available, the snag "boat was put In
condition for work, and started snag
ging on this stream in June, 1899. Work
Is in progress at clos of fiscal year.
To end of year 150 mfles were run over
and 135 snags, 18 stumps, 31 trees and 6
logs were removed."
The money statement for uhis work
shows a balance on hand July 1st. 1899,
of $5,641.18 and recommends that $25,
000 can be profitably expended for work
of improvement during year ending
June 30th, 1901, and $5. 000 for main
tenance of Improvement. ,

always taken a very acuuuerest m
the matter of securing at propriations
for fthls work, previous appropriations
in fact having been very kUrgely due
to influences which he broajht to bear
upon North Carolina members of the
house and senate. Mr. Meeer. is also
engineering the present motjement. He
has had prepared a petition fo congress
setting forth the iwork heretofore done
by the government:, the prfeent needs
for the completion of the woject and
asking for th $15,000 appropriation.
The petition contains valuifble infor
mation. It is as follows:
"To the Congress of the United States;
"Greeting: The undersigned citizens
of Brunswick and New Hanover coun
ties, in the state of North Carolina, do
hereby urgently and most respectfully
petition for an appropriation of at least
$15,000 for the further improvement of
Lockwood's Folly river. N. C. So far
$18,000 has been appropriated for the
improvement of this river, the appro
priations being made on September
19, 1890 for $5,000; July 10, 1SS2, for
$3,000, and August 17, 1S94, for $10,000.
and of ahese appropriations all but
$181.49 have been expended.
"In a letter dated May 5, 1897, the
chief of engineers directed that the im
provements on this river be discon
tinued, giving for reasons that the
commerce of and tributory to said river
did not justify further expenditure in
that the depth of the channel then
secured was sufficient for all purposes.
"At the discontinuation of the work
a channel five feet deep at ' mean low
water and 40 to 58 feet wide had been
secured from the inlet to Lockwood's
Folly bridge, a distance of twenty-five
miles. Since the discontinuation of
work the channel has gradually been
filling in at" points, "noticeably below
Genoa Point, until at present it is in
anything but a satisfactory condition.
, "It is believed that for $15,000 the
channel can be placed in good condi
tion, and other necessary improve
ments made, noticeably on work at the
bar, and the removal of a number of
small shoals above the present im
provement, and opposite Dickson's
landing and other places. In addition
two or three short cuts could be made
at a nominal cost, material to be re
moved being of a soft, peaty nature
with no rock, logs or stumps.
"The increase in commerce tributary
to this section has been marked in the
past two years.
"In a few instances have there been
a decrease in the figures as given in the
statistics compiled for the year 1895,
On the other hand there have been
great gains in certain lines. The shell
fish business has increased over 200 per
cent, and the timber trade is assuming
large proportions. Nature has so laid
out these grounds and distributed the
salt and fresh waters in their alter
nations in tins' river, that the shell
fish products are rapidly gaining favor
with dealers far and near on account
of their peculiarry delicious flavor.
"R. W. Gibson has 'established near
this river a shingle mill with a capacity
of 4,000,000 'shingles, the plant being
valued at about $20,000; and if the
water facilities are improved he will
increase 25 per cent, on present plant."
Wilmingtonians feeling an interest in
this movement and desiring to sign the
petition, can do so by seeing Mr. J. B.
Mercer at his shoe store on Princess
street.
MORE BIG COTTON MILLS.
Winston, N. C, December 7. -The
American Development Company,
which is composed principally of the

and the search for her since that time
had been unavailing up to today. An
investigation of the case led to the be
lief that she had been the victim of
foul play, and circumstances strongly
pointed to Allen Fuller, a negro, as
her probable murderer. Fuller has
been arrested and lodged in Bibb coun

CUBA'S NEW C.OVEUNOK.
General Wood to Succeed General
Brooke Troops to bo Withdrawn.
Washington, December 7. General
Leonard Wood had a conference with
the secretary of war today respecting
his future. Wrhile neither of the prin"
cipals had anything to say for publi
cation as to the conclusions reached,
it is gathered that General Wood is to
be the next governor of Cuba, succeed
ing General Brooke, who will return
to the United States.
It is expected that the military force
In Cuba can be greatly reduced In the
near future, so that while General
Wood, by commanding the troops re
maining will be a military governor,
there will be so little left of the mili
tary establishment that his-office will
be much more civil than military in
fact. The reduction in force will en
able the war department to withdraw
some or perhaps all of the general of
ficers of the regulars now in Cuba.
GENERAL ADVANCE IN WAUliS.
Boston, Mass., December 5. The
Movement to advance wages in cotton
mill centers has become general
throughout the New England states.
Thus far nearly 100,000 operatives have
been notified of a 10 per cen't. advance
and the outlook indicates that most of
the mills which have not made any
announcement will soon do so.
The operatives of the big Rhode
Island corporations controlled by the
Goddards and Robert Night and sev
eral smaller concerns in that s-tate and
those of the Lowell Company, aggre
gating in number neaTly 30.(00, were
among the mill workers notified of tb
advance today. The new schedule will
go into effect at Lowell December ISth
and in Rhode Island one week earlier.
It is expected that by Christmas wages
in the carton mills of New England
will be higher than -they have been be
fore since 1893.
THREE SENATE CAUCUSES.
Washington, December 5 Three cau
cuses were held in the senate end of
the capitol today. They were under
the auspices respectively of the repub
lican, the democratic and the Independ
ent senators, the last named including
the silver republicans and 'the popu
lists. The business of each of the meet
ings pertained to the filling and reor
ganization of the committees and in
each Instance the detail work was re

Benjamin F. de Costa, whose reception J
imo me itoman caitnonc cnurcn, which
took place on Sunday last, has written
an article which is to be published in
Catholic papers In which he explains
his reasons for the step he has taken.
In beginning Dr. de Costa thanks
God for giving him" "grace to over

ucation," and declares that his change

year, but began very long ago.
"The sad, fallen estate of post-reformation
belief," he adds, "has forced

that the reformation was not based
upon any true foundations,"

New mills at the fanner's door mean

And in this connection it is interest

and the world calling for it, of course
it doesn't matter about protection now,

The secretary of the treasury's esti
mate of a $40,000,000 surplus in the
treasury at the end of this fiscal year
is "pointed to with pride." The presi

ver. "Greatness" is a word that needs a
modern definition. We ay that Glad
stone. Jefferson, Napoleon, Rockfeller
and Duke were great, meaning thereby
that they are "the top of the pile" In
their calling. Mr. Ben Duke has cer
tainly proven "to be a Napoleon of the.
tobacco trade, building like Rockfeller
upon the ruin and failure of thousands
of competitors, and reducing the to
bacco farmers to the condition of mak

better things next year. That's what

To regulate the world we must begin

ask for equity; doing Justly, we can.
insist upon Justice; being charitable,
we can solicit alms with grace and
consistency. But let ua not set our
selves up as critics to give precept
without being the exampkir thereof.
Iet us not pronorvre other all evil until
we have eliminated the old Adam' from
ourselves. The man who lives a con

there Is charity and loving klndnew
he who so lives Is beloved. Wruiro do

But leaving aside thj? incongruous
position of the adminifr Hon Cfr Mr.
Gage declares that his action was dic

another point: Under the Harrison re
gime tlhere were Issued 2 per cent,
bonds, now quoted on the market at
100. Instead of purchasing these, and
saving to the treasury $2,700,000. what
does our Mr. Gage do but go into the
market and make an offer on the part
of the National Governmeint to buy
$25,000,000 of outstanding 4 and 5 per
cent, bonds, the fours being quoted at
112.75 and accrued interest, and the
fives at 111 with accrued Interest, en
tailing the expenditure of $2,700,000
more than was nectssary, even admit

proper thing to be done. The republi
