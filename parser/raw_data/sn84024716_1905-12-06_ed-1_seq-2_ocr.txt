CONUKESS IN SESSION
The first session of the Fifty
ninth Congress was held Monday.
No unusual incidents marked the
opening at noon,although a crowd
ot' visitors was attracted to Wash?
ington for the ooeaeion. The
session of the Senate was brief,
but that of tbe House lasted for
several hours. Great interest
attached to tbe House proceedings
from tbe fact that a Speaker bad
to be elected, and it was a foregone
conclusion that Speaker Joseph G.
Cannon of Illinois, would be re?
elected without opposition, and he
was.
On account of pending matters
of commewial and political Interest
the present session of Congress bas
been looked forward to as one of
more than ordinary interest. Ques?
tions that will engage the atten?
tion of Congress include control of
corporations engaged in interstate
business, corrupt use of mouey at
elections, Panama canal construc?
tion, statehood for tbe remaining
territories, insurance companies,
ian igration and treatment of the
Chinese under the present exclu?
sion law, and raising revenue for
a possible deficit. Tbe situation
in the Philippines, tariff questions
and commercial competition with
Germany will also come in for
their share of attention.
EDUCATORS IN LYNCHBUHO
Th Co operative Education
Association of Virginia held an
interesting and helpful convention
in Lynchburg on Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday of last week.
The attendance was large, more
than four hundred educators, in?
cluding college presidentSjteacbers
and superintendents, being pres?
ent. Many practical addressee
were made, which were followed
by interesting discussions.
Resolutions were adopted calling
on the Gereral Aesembly for the
establishment of a fund of $200,
000 as a building fund to be loaned
to the counties and cities for ap?
propriations in addition to the
present educational fund, and ask?
ing that steps be taken for the
establishment bv tbe State of an
institution cf higher learning
whereby Virginia's daughters shall
have the same opportunities as are
now given her sons at tbe Univer?
sity of Virginia.
Dr. S. C. Mitchell cf Richmond
College, was elected president of
the Association, and Dr. George
H. Denny of Washington and Lee,
was made a member of the execu
live committee.
President Roosevelt's message In
Ccngre&s was reud Tuesday before
that body, and was listened to
with great interest. Tbe message
is voluminous, making more than
half a hundred pages of closely
printed pamphlet. Matters of in?
terest to tbe government are dis?
cussed interestingly, and many re?
commendations are made for Con?
gress to net upon. Tbe keynote of
tbe message is struok wben the
President says that this govern?
ment is not and never shall be
government by a plutocracy. Thie
government is not and nevor shall
be government by a mob. It shall
continue to be in the ^future what
it bas been in tbe past, a govern
ment based cn the theory that each
man, rich or poor, is to be treated
simply and solely on his worth us
p iran.
The Democratic leader cf the
House of Representative, Hon.
John Steward Williams of Missis?
sippi, bas informed Representative
Claude A. Swanson that under no
circumstances would a Virginian
be selected to succeed Mr. Swan
eon oa the W*-ys and Me-ns Co rn
n,ittee. It i.< said Mr. Williams'
attitude is due to his dislike for
ReprefentaiiveHay cf the Seventh
DiHtrict. The Virginia dele^atitn
is not at all pleased with the at?
titude of Mr. Williams.
The Harrisonburg Spirt of tbe
Vaiby last week published an
industrial edition in magazine
form,which gave excellent sketches
of the enterprising business firms
cf that progressive town. The
issue was tastefully printed with
exoellent half tone cuts. The
Spirit is to be congratulated on its
commendable enterprise.
The President Endorsee James?
town Tercentennial
The following paragraph in
President Rooaevel t's - message to
Congress has reference to tbe
Jamestown Exposition, in which
be heartily endorses the move?
ment:
I heartily commend to your
favorable consideration tbe ter?
centennial celebration of tha
settlement at Jamestown, Va.
Appreciating the desirability of
tbis commemoration, the Congress
passed an act March 8, 1905,
authorizing in the year 1907, on
and near the waters of Hampton
Roads, in the State of Virginia,
an international naval, marine and
military celebration in honor ol
tbis event. By the authority vested
in me by this act I hav mada
proclamation of said celebration,
and have issued, in conformity
witb its instructions, invitations
to all nations of the earth to
participate by sending t.ieir uaval
vessels and such military organiza?
tions as may be practicable. This
celebration would fail of its full
purpose unless it were enduring
in its results and con*nensurate
with the importance of the event
to be celebrated, the event from
whi'-h our nation dates it birth.
I earnestly hope that this cele?
bration, already endorsed by the
Congress of the Uuited States,and
by the Legislatures ol f.ixteen
States since tbe action cf the Con?
gress, will receive such additional
aid at your hands at- will make it
werthy of tbe great event it is
intended to celebrate, and thereby
enable the government of the
United States to make provision
for the exhibition of its own
resources, and likewise enable our
people who have undertaken the
work of such a celebration to
provide suitable and proper en?
tertainment and instruction in the*
historic events of our country for)
ali who may visit tbe exposition
and to whom we have tendered our
hospitality.

The Washington and Lee Uni?
versity football team, lighter
by nearly 10 pounds to the man
than their opponents, defeated

The difference in weight was over?
come by the superior knowledge
cf the game on the part of the
Washington and Lee team, which
outclassed Geotge Washington ii.
the flue points.The score indicates
the relative ability of tbe two
teams.
Moomaw scored tbs first touch?

first hu If, and Anderson went ever
tht George Washington goal line
ten minutes later for thc second

It took Washington and Lee 17
minutesof the second half to finally
shove Moomaw ever for tho third
and last score. Anderson kicked
goal. George Washington could
not gain consistently, and the
Virginians' goal line waa never in
danger. The game closed the

YOUR MONEY
For Our Goods!
We have goods to sell, you have money to spend. The
only question with you is, "Where can I get the best value for
my money?" If we can't give it to you, we don't want
your money I All we ask is, that you consider quality as
well ae price; then we ara sure to sell you. Not how low in
price, but how good at a price! That is our motto. And the
reason is, that "cheap" goods are dear at any price. Take our
10 cent CANDIES, for instance. Nowhere else will you find
such candies for 10 cents. And the 20 cent kind usually brings
30 to 40 cents elsewhere. Do you want proof of it9 Try
them as others have and you will know. We began selling
them a little over eighteen months ago, and have sold in that
time between 6 and 7 tons. That speaks for itself. We
guarantee every pound absoluteey pure.
Just so with our entire line of goods, whether in
Groceries, Shoes, Dry Goods, or what not. The vkby best
POSSIBLE AT THE PRICE; AND THE PRICE A8 LOW AS, IF" NOT LOWER
than, any other. On this basis we are prepared to sell any?
thing you want to eat or wear. Take our UNDERWEAR.
It is the finest, softest, most elastic, and best fitting we can
buy. Whether you pay 25 cents a garment or a dollar and a
half.
Try our CORSETS. R. \& G or Invisible Lacing,
Deep Hip, Straight Front, Tapering Waist, or any style. We
guarantee every pair, if they break or rust?your money back.
FURS. Where can you buy such furs as we offer at
$2.00 to $15.00? Such Muffs at $2.00 to $7.50? Do you
need Rugs or Art Squares? Who ever sold so good a rug as
we at $1.00 ? We sold 50 of them in two days and a half, and
we'll have another bale in a few days.
Many people are ruining their health and stomachs,
buying cheap foods. We won't sell them if wc kaow it, and
ii is our business to know. Take SARDINES as a sample,
Have you ever eaten any really good sardines ? Let us sell
you some, packed on the coast of Sardinia (that'-i where they
get the name) put up in pure oil of olives.andyou'11 never want
any otber kind. The flavor is al'ogether a different thing from
the common run of so called *-ardineh. Just so with all our
groceries.
tAeT If you are looking for Baroains, and do not care too
much for style, ask to see a few Cloaks and Suits we carried
over from last season. We are actually selling them below
prime cost.
BLACK CAT HOSE, for boys and girls, have never been
surpassed. They save darning, and they wear.
