FRIDAY DEC. 11, 1908.
Just to keep his hand in, Roosevelt
puts two more into the Ananias club.
Liar seems to be the president's pet
word.

Smithsonian Institution, wlil "outfit"

Roosevelt pays his personal expenses.
Whether he will divide up on the $1 a

question. How much Teddy would

fare doesn't prevent the great magnate
buying in princely style. One com­
ment made is that it would take many
of the farms along the Great Northern
altogether to be equal in value to the
New York lot. The commentator for­
gets that all the territory through
which Hill's road runs is farmed by
the Great Northern.
The president's message is exceed­
ingly long. Strange that so adept a
writer as Roosevelt should not have
learned the art of condensation. But
it is the tendency of preachers to
extend their remarks, and the presi­
dent is above all a preacher. His
opinions arejjust now not as important
as those of Taft, because his power is
nearly over. While he is hunting in
Africa, Taft will be facing the
problems. The president leaves the
great tariff reform question un­
touched. This question seems never
to have interested the president, al­
though he was an advocate of free
trade earlier days. He says some
good things on the rights of labor, and
makes just criticism of the encroach­
ments of the judiciary. He advocates
putting all railroads completely under
the control of the interstate commerce
commission, with powers that would
make government ownership but a
Step further. His words for forest
preservation are to the point, and

message.
EFFECT OF DEPOSIT GUARANTY.
Ih Bringing out Hoarded Money
Around Oklahoma.
(Correspondence ot the New York
Evening Post.)
Whatever may be the fault of the
bank guaianty system, it seems to
inspire confidence enough, among the
misers to bring out some of their
hidden wealth. A stockholder in a
new state bank just organized in
eastern Oklahoma tells of its ex­
perience. "At the end of the first day
I estimated that the deposits would be
$10,000. A friend guessed $20,000.
We investigated and found the3r were
$80,000. I asked the cashier, whence
it all came.
'About $25,000 came form the
other three banks, two of them na­
tionals, he replied, 'and we received
$18,000 from Missouri, Kansas and
Arkansas, sent here probably because
of the guaranty law. Then for the
rest, look a this.' He showed a pack­
age of worn bills, all brought in by a
farmer well outside the town. 'I
know that none of this was ever in a
bank since he gathered it little by
little—there is $14,000 in that
bunch.'
Up in central Kansas last week a
man sold a farm and went early one
morning to deliver the deed. The
farmer who was the buyer excused
himself and went out to the barn he
was watched and was seen to pick a
tin can from a corner of the hog lot
and take from it $1500 in bills. Land
agents say the experience of receiving
packages of musty bills, evidently
buried for a time, is not unusual,
indicating that large sums are pro­
bably thus concealed among the
farming communities.

Holland Makes Demonstration
Against Venezuela.
Regarded as Preliminary to a
Blockade of Ports.
Willemstad, Dec. 5.—Having been
nnable to obtain an amicable settle
ment of outstanding differences with
Venezuela, the Netherlands govern­
ment has begun a naval demonstra­
tion off the coast of the South Ameri­
can republic and since Wednesday
vessels flying the Dutch flag have
steamed along the eoast from Puerto
Cabello to La Guayra at a Hit—at
•f 3,000 yards from the shore.
The Ijattleship Jacob Van Heems
fcerk and the cruisers Gelderland and
Frlesland are engaged in the opera­
tion, which, it is said, will continue
indefinitely. The Jacob Van Heems­
kerk has arrived here, bringing the
above news. The two cruisers had
proceeded to Maracaibo, it was stated,
though the officers observed secrecy
concerning the movements of the ves­
sels. The Heemskerk will relieve the
Gelderland at Maracaibo Monday
With steam up In all her boilers, the
Heemskerk arrived off La Guayra
Wednesday morning at 5 o'clock. As
soon as the battleship was sighted all
the lights in the city were extinguish­
ed. From the deck of the ship could
be seen the guns ashore pointed to­
ward the battleship, which was kept
ready for action. The Heemskerk re­
mained but one day off La Guayra and
Thursday proceeded up the coast and
passed between the shore and the
small sandy islands in the bay of
Puerto Cabello off the city of Puerto
Cabello.
The demonstration is regarded as
indicating that the preparations for
an effective blockade of the Venezue­
lan coast are complete.
DEMOCRATS DESIRE INQUIRY
Demand That Panama Canal Purchase
Be Probed.
Washington, Dec. 8.—The Demo­
crats of the house are planning to de­
mand an investigation of the purchase
of the Panama canal property and in
conformity with this programme Rep­
resentative Rainey of Illinois intro­
duced a resolution asking the speaker
to appoint a committee of five to "as­
certain how much of the $40,000,000
wbich appears on record to have been
paid to the French company wa.i
really paid to that eompany." It is
said that the national Democratic
committee requested Mr. Rainey to
present the resolution.
The resolution provides that the
committee shall ascertain if any por­
tion of the $40,000,000 was directly or
indirectly paid to American citizens
•r to an American syndicate and if
any member or senator profited by
the transactions.
During the recent campaign it was
charged in newspaper articles that
the president's brother-in-law, Doug­
las Reblnson of New York, and
Charles P. Taft of Cincinnati, brother
of the president-elect, had profltei by
the transaction. It was this charge
and newspaper comment thereon
which provoked the letter from Pres­
ident Roosevelt to William Dudley
Foulke of Indiana denying the state­
ments and saying that all the papers
In the matter were open to the public.
WOMEN FIGHT VIGOROUSLY
Suffragettes Repel Attempts to BJeet
Them From Hall.
London, Dec. 6.—The suffragettes of
London, in other words the militant
section of the women who are agitat­
ing for the suffrage of their sex, in­
dulged in a fierce demonstration
against David Lloyd-George, chancel­
lor of the exchequer, at Albert hall.
The chancellor was addressing a suf­
frage meeting, but the women inter*
rupted him with shrill cries from all
parts of the hall until finally the up­
roar was such that the stewards
moved down the aisles to quiet the
demonstrants. They found them
chained to their seats and there were
numberless fierce struggles, the wo­
men using whips vigorously to repel
the attempts to eject them. Men and
women struggled back and forth over
the floor, the women rallying to the
support of their colleagues. Finally
a semblance of order was restored
which made it possible for the chan
eellor to continue his speech.
YANKEE GOES TO BOTTOM
Cruiser Sinks After Being Taken Off
the Rooks.
New Bedford, Mass., Dec. 5.—Free
from Spindle rock, at the western en­
trance to Buzzards bay, where she
had been impaled for ten weeks, the
United States cruiser Yankee sank six
fathoms deep near what is known as
the Sand Spit while being towed to
this city for repairs. She lies a short
distance to the north of Penikese isl­
and and not far from the ledge on
which she had rested since Sept. 23
last. The sinking of the cruiser oc­
curred twelve hours after she was
floated from the ledge. In spite ef
the discouraging situation it is be­
lieved that the vessel can be raised
and work to that end will ho begun

ADMIRAL COGHLAN IS DEAD
Retired Naval Officer Expires Sud­
denly of Apoplexy.
New York, Dec. 5.—Rear Admiral
Joseph B. Coghlan is dead at New
Rochelle, N. Y. He was in command
of the New York navyyard from 1904
to 1907.
Rear Admiral Coghlan's death was
very unexpected. He, with Mrs. Cogh­
lan, was living at the home of Charles
Chamberlain, a former New York
newspaper man, in Sutton Manor, the
residence section of New Rochelle,
while waiting for his new home in
that city to be made ready for his oc­
cupancy.
Apoplexy was the cause of Rear Ad­
miral Coghlan's death. Only a short
time before the end he complained of
severe pains in the region of the heart
and when a physician reached the
house he had collapsed.
Admiral Coghlan was a native of
Kentucky, where he Was born in 1844.
In the course of his distinguished
career he had
ajdive
service in the
Civil war. in the spanish war, as sec­
ond in command of the North Atlantic
squadron from June, 1902, to April,
3904, and more recently commandant
of the New York navyyard.
CONGRESS IN SESSION
House and Senate Hold Open­
ing Proceedings,
Washington, Dec. 7.—Both houses of
congress held brief sessions today, ad­
journments being taken out of respect
to the memory of those members who
had died during the recess. The only
business transacted by the senate was
the swearing in of Senator Page of
Vermont. The first half of the hour
that the house was in session was de
xoted to a roil call to- ascertain the
presence of a quorum. The formal
opening of the body witnessed a re­
markable demonstration for Speaker
Cannon, the Republicans and mp.ny
Democrats loudly clapping their hands
and cheering for several minutes.
Soon after Mr. Sherman of New
York the vice president-elect, came in
the chamber and he was accorded an
ovation from his Republican col­
leagues. In lik« manner the Demo­
crats roundly applauded the new lead­
er. Champ Clark, when he, rose in his
place and forced an explanation re­
garding the absence of credentials cf
a new member from the Third New
York district.
PANAMA CANAL BONDS SOLD
Disposed of at an Average Price of
$1.024368.
"Washington, Dec. 7.—Secretary Cor
telyou announced that the Panama
canal bonds had been sold at an aver­
age of $1.024368. The lowest accept­
ed bid was at $1.022778. There were
159 accepted bids, amounting to $30,
000,000. Six hundred and seventy
two bids were rejected, amounting to
$72,^OS.800. The total number of reg­
ular bids, therefore, was 831, sub­
scribing for $102,808,800.
The bona fide character of the bids
is shown by the fact that of the 834
received all but three were accom­
panied by certified checks or cash
for 2 per cent of the face value of the
bonds applied for.

CHARLES P. TAFT
MAKESANSWER
Replies to Panama Canal
Insinuations.
MAY TAKE LEGAL ACTION
Agrees to Demand to "Let in the
Light," but Declares That When
Evidence Is All in an Apology Will
Be in Order—New York Worid, Dis­
cussing President's Recent Letter,
8ays His Statements Are Untrue.
Cincinnati, Dec. 9.—The Cincinnati
Times-Star, of which Charles P. Taft
is editor and proprietor, publishes the
following reply to the article on the
Paftama canal which appeared in the
Indianapolis News and New York
World:
"The New York World, the paper
which was responsible for most of
the talk about the 'Panama scandal'
during the recent campaign, says:
"'Whether Douglas Robinson, who
is Mr. Roosevelt's brother-in-law, or
any of Mr. Taft's brothers associated
himself with Mr. Cromwell in Pan­
ama exploitation or shared in these
profits is incidental to the main issue
of letting in the light.'
"This statement is intentionally
misleading. The Panama story was
used in the campaign for political
reasons solely. The one thing that
gave its political value in the eyes of
those who used it was the fact that
the story, as printed, carried the
names of a brother of the Republican
candidate for the presidency and of a
brother-in-law of the president. The
inference was plain enough. It was
that Theodore Roosevelt and Willian\
H. Taft had used thflr Influence as
high officials of the United States gov­
ernment to help near relatives fea
Looting the Treasury
at Washington. That was the meat of
the story. If the names of Douglas
Robinson and Charles P. Taft had not
been included in it, flimsy and absurd
as it was, the lying yarn would never
have been used by the World, the In­
dianapolis News and other papers
which for on9 reason or another want
ed to defeat Mr. Taft and discredit
Mr. Roosevelt.
"The World is trying to dodge the
issue. It wants to be relieved of the
responsibility of trying to drag the
names of Mr. Robinson and Mr. Taft
into its made to order mess of scan­
dal and slime.
"Both the World and th« Indianap­
olis News are crying 'let In the light.'
We thoroughly agree with them. But
after a little time has passed, after
the most desperate efforts of the cor­
nered World and News have produced
all the evidence they can, an apology
will be in order from those newspa­
pers.
"In the meantime Mr. Taft reserves
the right to take legal steps, which
possibly have been made more desir­
able by the events and insinuations of
the past forty-eight hours."
REGARDING CANAL PURCHASE
New York* World Declares Roosevelt's
Statements Untrue.
New York, Dec. 9.—The New York
World, to which Delavan Smith, ed­
itor of the Indianapolis News, referred
In his reply to President Roosevelt's
attack upon him as the authority for
the article on the Panama canal
which appeared in his paper and
called forth the president's letter,
says:
"In view of President Roosevelt's
deliberate misstatements of fast in
his scandalous personal attack upon
Mr. Delavan Smith, editor of the In­
dianapolis News, the World calls upon
the congress of the United States te
make Immediately a full and impar­
tial investigation of the entire Pan­
ama canal scandal.
'The investigation of 1906 by the
senate committee of the interoceanic
canals was blocked by the refusal of
William Nelson Cromwell to answer
the most pertinent questions of Sen­
ator. Morgan of Alabama. Since that
time nothing has been done because,
after Senator Morgan's death, there
was no successor to carry on his
great work of revealing the truth
about Panama corruption."
The World then quotes from Pres­
ident Roosevelt's letter denying the
charges and continues
"To the best of the World's knowl­
edge and belief each and all of these
statements made by Mr. Roosevelt are
untrue and Mr. Roosevelt must have
known they were untrue when he
made them."
Anti-Foreign Agitation.
Hongkong, Dec. 9.—There has. been
considerable anti-foreign agitation in
Hongkong during the past few days
owing to the death of a coolie on
board a river boat and the Chinese
have boycotted the local river steam­
ers. It was alleged that the death of
this man was caused by an assault on
the part of a foreign watchman on
board one of the steamers, but an offi­
cial inquiry disproved this.

held up in the bank 1.

All One in Christ.
The coming of Christ gave emph*
sis to the fatherhood of God and tht
brotherhood of man. The great prin­
ciple of Christianity stands out prom*
inently in contradiction to many of
the noblest principles of heathendom.
Race prejudices ran through all peo­
ples and amongst all tongues, but
when Christ came he taught the
fatherhood of God and the brother­
hood of man. He taught that God ia
no respecter of persons. He made the
poor as well as the rich his disciples.
He dined with the publicans and sin
ners, as well as with priests and
noblemen. He commanded that the
Gospel be preached to every crea­
ture. His church today is a living
witness that there is neither bond
nor free, male nor female, Greek nor
Jew, for we are all one in Christ
