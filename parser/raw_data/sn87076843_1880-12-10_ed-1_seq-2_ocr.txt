There seems to bo n disposition on tho
part of some Bepublicans to have. General
Garfield appoint Alex. II. Stephens, of
Georgia, In n placo in his Cabinet. If it
should bo deemed expedient by Gen. Gar

such a position, this selection would be a
good one.

Private Dulzelle wrote to President
Hayes requesting to know If he would
allow his name used as n competitor for

The Bowling Green Scntinil put squarely
astride the fence on the Senatorial ques
lion lust week and personates Jintice,
iiiimn the blindfold. It considers the
scales equally baljuueed between brains
and money thin Sherman is entitled to
the position of U. H. Senator ou tho ground
of ,his grcut ability nml past services to
.the country, and Foster is entitled to equal
.onors for the liberal use of his money in
campaigns.
A Washington correspondent snyB 1 1 is
certain that Gen, Garfield will not In the
slightest degree exert Jiis Influence in fuvor
f either of the Senatorial citudidales in
Ohio, They are both warm personal
friends," Ac, So it would seem that Dcm
ucrnlic editors are wasting their time and
deluding their readers by trying to mnkc
It appear that there is a coldness between
Garfield and Sherman.
It is evident that the Toledo Timet feels
(list It is necessary for Gov, Foter to rise
and explain several matters away, if lie
can. It calls upon him about three times
it day to do so. But still Foster is reti
cent, looks wise and evades answers when
questioned by reporters about the pay
went of the $2,800 hotel bill nt Chicago,
which his friends claim should have been
paid by Secretary Sherman,,

fleorgta and cast their respective votes its
they had been Instructed by the majority
itt each in accordance with thecoustitrtiou
nnd law on the subject. The electors ol
Georgia, failed to do so. from the fact that
the Georgia State luw did not provide for
the very obvious contingency of the first
Wednesday in December being nteu the
first day of the mouth, and the Electoral
Vote of that Hlnto will m ut likely be
thrown Oilile. It makes but little dilll-r-ence,
as It would not change the result

Build shot on tho Senatorial question, and

It is said the present will bo the first
Winter that Geo. Garfield has spent nt lit
home In Ohio for 20 years. Ohio men
generally spend a good deal of time In
Washington nnd they compare well st tho

Union.

Toledo lice: Ohio Congressmen in
Washington nrc said to bo almost un
animous in the opinion thnt Sherman
will bo elected Senator Indeed some of
them say that his name only will co be

the average Congressman is sometimes mis
taken. n -
Trains are now running regular on the
Ohio Central It. 11 , between Columbus nnd
Fostoria. They will run through to Toledo
as soon ns the bridges over the D. & M. and
Luke Shore tracks nrc completed. This it
is thought will be ncromplishcd by next
Wednesday. Trains also run on the south
branch of thIsrnad,soulheast from Colum
bus, to Hush's Station, 29 miles.
It is thought that Senator Lamar, nf
Mississippi, nnd Senator Glover, of Oregon,
will neither be nblo to take their seats in
tho Senate again. This will leave the 'Re
publicans with n clear majority in the Sen
ate without the vole of Mnlione, of Vir
ginia, who, it is thought, will net with
them. lie was elected by a Democratic
Ite.idjiisler-Kepublican combination nnd
may asstimn the position vacated by Sen
ator D.ivls on the fence.
From the fact that nearly all the Demo
cratic papers of Ohio nrc supporting Fos
ter for Senator nnd nearly all the Itepubli
cm papers of the State aio supporting
Hon. John Sherman for the same position
it is becoming a leading question which
party Mr. Foster would represent if suc
cessful in the race. The heighth of his nm
bilion seems to bo to allow his "foO
fncnds"to parade before the country that his
claim upon the office consists in the length
of his purse and his liberality In the use
of it.
The Decennial State Board ot Equali

Chicago lnter-Octrnx : The trouble about
the Congressional apportionment under the
new census it is nlrendy apparent, will be
rs to the basis of representation. The
New England and Borne of the Middle
States, which fall behind, will object to
nny diminution of their representation to
Congress. But even if the present basis,
one representative for every 131,000 pop
ulation, be continued, the Isew England
Stales will lose four and tho Middle
six Conirressmen, hut the size of the
I louse will be swelled to 303 members.
This indicates one of the iiiuuy reasons
why the apportionment may be postponed
to the next Congress.

Toledo Democrat: Tho dcfc.it of Judge
Terry for Presidential Elector in Califor
nia, by the votes of tho Democratic friends
of David Broderick, who was murdered by
Terry in a so-called duel, during tho ad.

warm personal nnd political friend of Ste
phen A. Douglas, and lost his life on ac
count ol his eppodtion to the schemo of

SWINDLERS ABROAD.
Hotv a Trio of Wood l.'ounlr Farm
ers siave uccu tastn in.
Toledo Eculn Bee.
Several weeks since our neighbiring
county of Wood was raided by a brace of
pruuing-shenrs agents, followed by another
brace of patent liny-fork agents. The for
mer visited, among others, Mr. Osman Di
ver, a farmer of Montgomery township,
who accepted an agency fur tho sale of
pruning-shears, the shears to lie delivered
to him as he required them nnd had sale
for them, he to make n handsome profit ou
each pair of shears sold. A purported ar
ticle of agreement, wsb signed, nnd the
bland agents took their departure.
In the southern portion of the county,
Mr. Jacob Bailey, a well-to-do farmer re
ceived a call from a coup'o of hayfork
agents, who desired him to become agent nf
the same. This however, he declined to
do. Then permission was asked to hang
a simple fork in his barn that be might
show his neighbors. Alter considerable
urging nnd persuasion he consented to
this, signing what purported lo be n re
ceipt tor a fork, safely stowed away in his
barn for exhibition to his neigh bora.
The same parties also visited Mr. Adam
Schurer, ol Plain township, where a simi
lar request wax made and granted, he also
signed a receipt fors.iid fork.
Time pissed mi, when the fact was re
vealed that a citizen of Fostoria held the
personal obligation of Mr. Onuau Diver
for the sum of $350.
Two other notes of hand turned up in
this city, one against Mr. Adam Schurer
for SC00, and the other against Mr. Jacob
Bailey for the snug sum of $750. Both ol
these notes were in the hands nf a business
man on Summit stieel. Inquiries passed
through the Commercial Agency of this
city as to the standing of at least ono ol
these men, but no information could be
obtained ns to where the inquiry cninc
from. Through the means of some detec
tive work, however, the whereabouts of the
two notes were ascertained, and the cir
cumstances under which the notes were ob
tained fully explained, A second visit to
me city, nnu 10, me notes uiui passed inio
ine nanus oi oilier pariico names uoi
given. The several notes are due about
three months hcuceL mid their payment
will he resisted to the uttermost.
There should be n way provided to bring
such miscrrnnta to justice, and all good
citizens will contribute of their knowledge
to that end. Much iudlgnaioii ia felt by
Wood county parties to the manner iii
which certnin information wna withheld
by parties in this city at n time when il
might have been nt some avail in ferret
ing out tho perambulating rascals.
A dispatch from FIndlay says that sev
eral farmers In IIanc6ck county have id
no been victimized by the pruning-shears
swindlers, nnd their names are (.'. N.Colo
and N.J. Bliss, and efforts are on foot there
to capture the rascals.

To-day President Ilnycs will submit his
Inst annual message lo Congress. Although
Mr. Ilnycs' ndmllilstrntlon has not been
what Is denominated of tho "stalwart1'
kind, still nil, oven our political opponents
must admit Hint It tins been fair, Impartial,
and pure. As nn Kxccuttvc, Mr. Ilnycs
lias administered the laws according lo his
Ideas of right, tho government has dealt
lehntly nnd justly with nil classes of Its
citizens, nml in no case can it be said wtth
litilh that tho power of the government
was made the means nf Injuring or curtail
ing injustly (he liberty, ficcdom of action
of n porsonjor persons; life nnd properly
have been protected under tbe law in all
rases nnd in evoiy section. Wo nro nt
ica(c with all tho world, our national cred
it standi; No. 1, nil our domestic industries
are thriving nnd prosperous, money is
abundant and chenp, for our mnnulacttircd
nrlklesand toroiir agricultural products wo
have a ready sale. The balaucc ot trade is
largely in nur favor, the gold of Kuropcnnd
Asia is being pouted into our laps in ex
change for tho products most needed by
them and of which we arc the world's pro
ducers. The manufactures ot the cast, the
grain-giving dial, lets of the north ifnd west,
the cotton ploductug delta of the south,
and mineral resouicrs of the fur west and
Pacific slope, nil combined In One grand
whole, go to make up n sum total of na
tional prospcrley for which wo have not
only reason to feel proud but grateful,
proud because we know that It has been
brought about by our industry, by intelli
gent labor, nldcd nnd assisted by that great
liower nod dlfiuser of knowledge, the pub
lie school. I'roud because we have built
up nnd sustained the political structure
known ns tho American Union by-the arts
of pence. Not u single stone in the entire
edifice has been added hv war and spolia
tion. To tho oppressed nml downtrodden
of nil tho world we hnve opened our nrpis
nnd bid them welcome and God speed on
the road to independence nnd prosperity.
Wo aie proud because we believe thit thcic
is nn land Under the Sun whero liberty nl
thought, liberty uf speech, and lilierly of
conscience is so much indulged, nnd does
not degenerate into silence but makes us
all tho mote law-abiding mid onlerly.
Widely ns we differ In our political views,
ns sincerely do we respect our neighbors
opinions, and when the heat of political
discussion is over nnd the battle decided
we at once cease to be enemies nnd become
friends and fellow countrymen. We un
grateful, also, to that Divine Providence
that watches over the affairs of nations
with thjfl.ime interest nml care as of the
individual or the birds uf the field. We,
therefore, believe Ihul alter the country
has perused this, the lust message of Presi
dent Haves In which besets forth nl length
our position both nl home and abroad and
submits to Ins countrymen n full account
of his stewardship, all will have reason lo
be proud of him. As n Kepiiblicnn,nud for
Republicans I believe lean speak and say
truly that, taking the Presidency nt a most
difficult lime, his own pirty torn into fnc
lions, the Democratic party but half satis
fied with the decision of a tribunal they
themselves had invoked, to decide n mos'i
momentous question, not only in so fur ns
it related to the welfare and prosperity of
thocountry as n whole, but ns il nfftclcd
political and party supremacy, that Presi
denl Hayes has so dischaiircd bisdiitv to
his country, to his party and to himself ns
10 step down Irom the chair of ollice Willi
satisfaction of knowing he has the respect
of all men and the esteem of his party. 1
believe that it is through nnd bv the
menus nnd example of Mr. Hnves' admin
istration, that the people of the Southern
Slates are so ready and willing to tender
their support to Mr. (.'arfiehl's administra
tion, for it is a well known (set that several
of the most trusted and respected leadersof
me rxiutiirrn Democracy luivesoiutormeil
President-elect Garfield. The reisoli is, I
believe, that they have tested the siudtritv
of the Republican paity, as administered
by President Haves, ami feel that ihev can
safely trust Mr, Uarficld, and not only thnt
they can trust, but they can afford lo throw
parly prejudice and sectional feeling aside,
