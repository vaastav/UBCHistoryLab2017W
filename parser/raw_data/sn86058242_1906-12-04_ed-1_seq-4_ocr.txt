WITH THE EDITORS.
Why He Failed.
He became saturated with other
men's thoughts.
Ho depended too much on hooka.
Ha thought his education was com
pleto when he left college.
He regarded Ids diploma as an in
surance policy against failure.
His mind was clogged with theories
and Impractical facts.
Ho mistook a stuffed memory for an
education, knowledge for power, and
scholarship for mastership.
Ho know languages and sciences, but
was ignorant of human nature.
He knew Latin and Greek, but could
not make out a bill of goods or a bill
of sale.
He was well posted in political eco
nomy, but he could not write a decent
business letter.
His four years In the world of books
left him permanently out of joint with
the world uf practical affairs.
He was above beginning at tho foot
of the ladder when ho left college.
The stamina of the vigorous, ind
pendent mind lie had brought from tho
farm and was lost in academic refine
ment. Ho thought that his four years' col
lege course had placed him immeasur
ably above those who had not had that
advantage.
Ho had never assimilated what he
learned and was crippled by mental
dyspepsia.
Tho habit of discriminating minuat
ly, weighing, balancing and consider
ing ull sides of a subject, destroyed
his power of prompt decision.
He thought that the world would be
Bt his feet when ho left college, and
made no effort to win its favor.
He could not digest his knowledge.
He knew enough, but could not man
age it effectively could not transmute
his knowledge into praetloul power.
O. S. Mardeu in. Success Magazine.
the iuui.e as uTEu.mnr,
Mr. William Lyon Phelps, who occu
pies the chair in English at Yale col
lege, is certainly a versatile gentleman
in his scholastic domain. Ho recently
expressed 1 egret that tho public had
eo vigorously opposed his making the
study of fiction a separate course in
English; that he had felt it best to
drop It nfter a single year's trial.
He now appears with a suggestion
that the college entrance examination
in English should be simply from the
Bible, which, he says, "has within
Its pages every single kind of litera
ture that any propose,! list of English
classics contains."
If Prof. Phelps has made a mistake
In either of Ids suggestions. It has
been in their exeluslvenoss. There is
no reason why fiction and the Bible
nlso should not be a part of every Eng
lish course. Indeed, they must be, if
it is at all complete. But there is no
reason for a course conih.od wholly to
the study of cither.
Also, there is no reason why the
Bible" should not have a place in every
college entrance examination, but no
reason for narrowing it to that book
f xelusively. Ignorance of the Bible
merely as literature in a college stud
ent is educational wickedness.
No person who is not familiar with
Biblical style, with its characters, its
teaching, its place in history, in mor
als r.nd religions, its wealth of imag
e v and figures can claim any consid
erable proficiency in English. It is in
style the most admirable and finished
product of our language, and most of
the great orators and writers of Eng
land and America owe the purity, the
beauty and the clearness of their dic
tion, to its study.
Vioi. Phelps can do no greater ser-
vice to his students than to encourage
its study and to make a knowledge of
it as literature compulsory in his Eng
lish courses. Duluth News-Tribune.

THIS C III ill. WORLD.
The German kaiser put a good deal
of human experience Into small space
when he said: "If I succeed, they ask
'Who was his adviser?' If I fall, they
say 'lie lacked judgment.' " Just like
the poor editor whose delinquent sub
scribers, as they wiped their eyes after
marching around his casket, sighed:
"He was a good fellow, but he couldn't
save his money." Montieello Journal.
falsi: ox its fact
It is reported that a certain news
paper editor in an adjoining county is
about to be prosecuted for attempting
to corrupt a voter. The case will fail
for want of evidence, unless, indeed, it
can be proven on tho poor fellow that
he was trying to swap space for politi
cal favors. The charge that an editor
was using his money is preposterous
on its face. Starke County Republi

It is in all probability the grandest
sport in the world when practiced in a
spirit of honor and decency. To ride
beside such a driver as Cap Wobeke is
a revelation. One trip in his company-
is sufficient to kill all the prejudices of
the worst enemy of nutomobiling. We
were going along a country road some
forty-five miles an hour, when a girl
babv of three years toddled out direct
ly in our path. Without bustle or ex
citement Cap slowed down. The big
machine simply died in its tracks, jus
like a lump of butter melting. No jerk
ing, no emergency brakes, no reversing
ot engines, no tossing forward or pas
sengers. When "she'' came to a dead
stop tho babv was within two feet of
the front wheel. "Hello, little girl,"
said Cap: "how long you going to play
in the road? Ha vine: a good time?"
The other day Cap Wobeko made tho
fastest drive that has yet been made
from Lakewood to New York. There
were eight people in his car and at
times the speed exceeded seventy-sev
en miles an hour. The road from Lake
wood to Newark is as tine as the shell
road of the Nevis or that along th
Riviera. obeke, by the way, used to

On
prise
the proposition of private enter
doing the work of carrying th.
mail the Ohiengo Journal says
The postotMce department is managed
with reckless extravagance, such as
would not bo tolerated for a single day
by private enterprise, it carries adver
tising matter in enormous quantities at
a great loss, at the request of a pow
erf ul lobby, and charges the .people
twice as much as is actually neevssa
for the transportation of letters. It
is robbed unmercifully by the railroads.
It has had nine postmaster-generals
within the past twenty years, none of
them experience in the work and many
of them absolutely incapable of trans
acting tho departments's business. The
department as a whole is preposter
ously mismanaged. And yet public opin
ion would not consent to allowing the
department to be conducted by individ
uals, however costly and inefficient con
duct by politicians may be.

WE BUNCO FOR
- EAST CHICAGO
Faulty Specifications Leave
Loophole for Unjustified
OGAL EDITORS ARE ANGRY
Torthern Indianian Gets Contract for
Publishing Auditor's Report;
Bill May be Held Up.
The East Chicago city council had
one of its Interesting sessions which
are the rule, last niarht and certair.lv
fulfllled what has crown to be the ex
pectation to have a change of pro
gram every two weeks.
After the usual routine of business
had been disposed of two very tiekelish
questions were brought to the atten
tion of the councilmen and discussed
pro and con all evening in a half hu
merous and half serious manner.
The lirst was another case of East
Chicago being bunkoed. When the
specifications for the paving of Com
monwealth evenue and Washington
street were drawn they indicated that
Commonwealth avenue was to be paved
to Washington street and Washington
street was to be paved to Common
wealth. The contractor claims that
in estimating tho cost of paving these
streets, he took the specifications liter
ally and did not take into considera
tion the square of pavement that would
have to be put In at the intersection
of these stret. The same was true ot
the intersection of Washington. Guth
rie, Cedar, and 13'th streets, which all
come together in a peculiar criss cross
and Cedar and 137th. The contractor
claims that he will not nav these
three intersections unless the council
agrees to pay him extra for it, and the
council has decided to see if a cornnro-
mise can not be effected.
Lauh On Council.
The laugh is on the council and the
city engineer for not having the speci
fications state specifically that the pav
ing of one street or the other must
extend to the opposite curb of the
street with which it intersects.
The other matter concerned the let
ting of the contract for tho publishing
of the auditors' report. It developed
that the finance- committee asked for
bids from W. W. Moberly of the Indiana
Harbor Sentinel and George Brown of
the East Chicago Globe, on the print
ing of 300 copies of the report and then
let the contract to the Northern Indian
ian for $25, before either of the East
Chicago papers knew what was being
done.
There is no objection to the price
which was very low..' but the editors of
the East Chicago papers objected to
being asked to bid on the job over the
phone and also to the haste with which
tho contract was awarded to an out
side newspaper without giving other
bidders a chance to figure closer.
Editor Brown addressed the council
and claimed when he was called up over
the phone he thought he was bidding
on another job and bid $125, when the
others were bidding $23.
Aldermen Stand
O'Girr and Lewis then
Pat.
attempted to
Lewis in de-
defend their action, and
fense of his letting the
contract said
that the city was not supporting the
editors of East Chicago papers and that
he believed in accepting the lowest bid
no matter where It came from
mere promises to tie a merry war
between the editor of the Northern In
dlanian and the editors of the two East
Chicago papers, and one of the first
moves that will be mado will be a de
mand upon the council that the bill be
not allowed for the reason that the
Northern Indianian printed the report
as a news item under a sensational
head in which former officials are
characterized as grafters, instead of as
a formal official report.
STAGGER STATISTIC EDITOR.
Overwhelming Array of Figures Turned
Over by Railroad Coniml-sniou.
Indianapolis, Dec 4. Figures that
stagger are submitted to Governor
Hanly in the report of the railroad
commission that has been turned over
to him. The railroads that reported to
the commission reported that for the
year ending June 30, 1906, they carried
over their entire line, 336,049,460 tons
of freight and 113,934,754 passengers.
The average freight rate per ton per
mile ranges from 3.09 cents in the
case of the Chicago, Indiana & Eastern,
which is the highest to .43 of one cent
In tho case of the Chicago & Erie, the
lowest. The principal amount of the
traffic was carried by other lines at
rates between that received by the Erie
and .72 of one cent received by other
lines.
The highest rate received per pas
senger per mile, is 4.54 cents in case
of the Louisville, New Albany & Cory-
don, while the lowest is l.H cents per
passenger per mile received by the
Grand Trunk Western.
HAMMOND MARRIAGE BROKEN.
Husband Telia Wife That Marriages
Performed Here are Void.
Chicago, Dec. 4. "Indiana marriages
are not legal, and so you are not my
wife," John Andrews is said to have
remarked to Edith B. Andrews three
months after their marriage, which
was celebrated last June in Hammond,
Ind.
Mrs. Andrews began suit for divorce
yesterday, alleging that her husband
had deserted her and married another
woman.
"I think the man was a fool." said
William E. Furness, attorney for Mrs.
Andrews. "He said all marriages cele
brated at Hammond, Ind., several
thousand of them, were illegal. He
also told me he had married another
woman.''

Latest Movements in Industrial Centers, by Exclusive
NEW YORK LETTEn,
New York, Dec. 4. Stocks started
the day off strong and higher in sym
pathy with higher prices lor American j
shares in London and absence of sell- j
ing pressure. The leaders were the
same as yesterday. New York Central
continued its upward movement, open
ing at 131 and selling up to lob. The
news was a rehash of yesterday, that
is the stock would be put upon a six
per cent basis at the next regular
meeting of the directors.
St. Paul, Union Pacific, Reading,
Atchison, Baltimore & Ohio, Louisville
& Nashville and Missouri Pacific were
all fractionally higher in the early
trading. But irregularity seemed to
predominate in the market, where one
particular stock was strong and ad
vancing, another was weak and declin
ing. St. Paul sold off two and one-half
from the high prices obtaining early.
Reading also declined from 149 to 147.
Fnion Pacific from ISSVi down to 186.
The selling was on a very liberal scale
and it looked as if some one was will
ing to reap the handsome profits In
these stocks that have been so strong
of ,late.
The president's message was read in
congress today. As usual when con
gress opens, the American Sugar com
panies shares begin to get active on
th stock exchange. Today was no ex
ception to the general rule. There was
more trade in these shares after noon
today than there has been in two
months. Tho market opened at 134
and sold up to 137 'i, closing at the
highest price of the day. The buying
was excellent in quality and it eman
ated from houses with ashington
connections.
The market closed extremely irreg
ular with losses in one-quarter and
gains in others.

CHICAGO LETTER.

tract wheat decreasing rapidly; Liver
pool markets one-quarter higher. The
short interest in the December option
has become so unwledy that a good
part of it was made to cover on the
advance today. Cash situation is re
ported good although sales to export
erss today were only 30,000 bushel
More activity was apparent in this
market today than for some time. The
close was strong with an advance of
for the May future and about a cent
for the December.
CORN eak early, cut later re
gained the entire loss. There was
quite a little selling of the December
future based on more liberal offerings
of new corn from farmers. The cash
market, however, was strong and high
er. It was reported that an advance of
two to three cents a bushel was scored
in the sampel market for the best
grades of old corn. The market closed
steady to firm.
OATS Fallowed the corn market
closely, weak early, later showing some
afarensth. May oata scored an advance profits if bought at present prices.

The funeral of Edward Treavers who
died Sunday morning of diabetes, was
held this morning in the Sacred Heart
church. Mr. Treavers had been a resi
dent of Whiting for about fourteen
years, and was a boiler-maker by
trade. The fact that ho had many
friends was fully demonstrated by the
large number who gathered at the
Lake Shore depot where the remains
were shipped to his old home in Ches
terton. The florol offerings were beau
tiful. The family, which consists of his
widow and two children, have the sym
pathy of all in their hour of sorrow.
As to Uses cf Soap.
Can soap be done without? Accord
ing to a member of the Kngllsh public.
It is quite an unnecessary article, and
man may be kept clean with plain
water. Nations have risen to great
ness without soap. Ancient Rome, our
old familiar companion, Rome, knew
nothing of soap until she came in
contact with the Germans and the
Gauls, who used it to brighten the
color of the hair. Onco or twice soap
is mentioned in the Old Testament,
but it doesn't mean the oily substanca
that it is today. Painful as it is for
Americans who have lived in England
to admit, it would bo tetter for gen
eral comfort if more soap was used
there. Thus, instead of advancing Its
cost, let it be lessened and so place
the cleansing articla within the reach
of all. But the new soap combine
doesn't view the situation in that
light precisely. It takes the caka
and the public pays.
For Young Man's Guidance.
The best ru!e3 to form a young
man are, to talk little, to hear much,
to reflect alone upon what has passed
in company, to distrust one's own
opinions, and value others that da
serve it. Sir W. Temple.
