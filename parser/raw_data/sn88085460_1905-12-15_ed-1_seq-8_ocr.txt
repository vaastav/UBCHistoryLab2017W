Catarrh Cannot be Cured
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease. Ca
tarrh is a blood or constitutional disease, and
in or ?er to cure it you mu<t take internal
remedies. Hall's Catarrh Cure is taken in
ternally, and acts directly on the blood and
mucous surface*. Hall's Catarrh Cure is not
a qacck medicine. It was prescribed by one
of the best physicians in this country for
years and is a regular prescription. It is com
posed of the best tonics known, combined
with the beet blood puritiers, acting directly
on the mucous surfaces. The perfect combin
ation of the two ingredients is what pioduees
such wonderful results in curing Catarrh. Send

FROM GIRLHOOD TO WOMANHOOD
Mothers Should Watch the Development of Their Baughters —
Interesting Experiences of Misses Borman and Mills.
BORMAN (h £/ MYRTLE MILLS (Gc\
Every mother possesses information
which is of vital interest to her young
daughter.
Too often this is never imparted or is
withheld until serious harm has result
ed to the growing girl through her
ignorance of nature's mysterious and
wonderful laws and penalties.
Girls' over-sensitiveness and modesty
often puzzle their mothers and baffle
physicians, as they so often withhold
their confidence from their mothers
and conceal the symptoms which ought
to be told to their physician at this
critical period.
When a girl's thoughts become slug
gish, with headache, dizziness or a dis
position to sleep, pains in back or lower"
limbs, eyes dim, desire for solitude;
when she is a mystery to herself and
friends, her mother should come to her
aid, and remember that Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound will at
this time prepare the system for the
coming change, and start the menstrual
period in a young girl's life without
pain or irregularities.
Hundreds of letters from young girls
and from mothers, expressing their
pratitude for what Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound has accomplished
for them, have been received by the
Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Co., at
Lynn, Mass.
Miss Mills has written the two fol
lowing letters to Mrs. Pinkham, which
will be read with interest:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham:— (First Letter.)
"I am but fifteen years of age, am depressed,
have dizzy spells, chills, headache and back-

helpful advice to girls in my condition, I am
writing you."—Myrtle Mills, Oquawka, lIL
Dear Mrs. Pinkbam:— (Second Letter.)
" It is with the feeling of utmost gratitude
that I write to you to tell you what your
valuable medicine has done for me. When I
wrote you in regard to my condition I had
consulted several doctors, but they failed to
understand my case and I did not receive
any benefit from their treatment. I followed
your advice, and took Lydia E. Pinkhara'a
Vegetable Compound and am now healthy
and well, and all the distressing symptoms
which I had at that time have disappeared."—
Myrtle Mills, CXuxawka, 111.
Miss Matilda Borman writes Mrs.
Pinkham as follows:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham :—
" Before taking Lydia B. Pinkham's Vege
table Compound my monthlies were irregu
lar and painful, and I always had such
dreadful headaches.
M But since taking the Compound my head
aches have entirely left me, my monthlies aro
regular, and lam getting strong and well. I
am telling all my girl friends what Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has done for
me." —M atilda Borman, Farmington, lowa.
If you know of any young girl who
is sick and needs motherly advice, ask
her to address Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn,
Mass., and tell her every detail of her
symptoms, and to keep nothing back.
She will receive advice absolutely free,
from a source that has no rival in the
experience of woman's ills, and it will, if
followed, put her on the right road to a
strong, healthy and happy womanhood.
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com
pound holds the record for the greatest
number of cures of female ills of any
medicine that the world has ever
known. Why don't you try it ?
