BEEF BARONS
ARE ORDERED
TO BE TRIED
U. S. Supreme Court Refus
es to Grant Stay in the
Proceedings as Had Been
Petitioned For.
WEDNESDAY IS SET
FOR HEARING CASE
Alleged Violators of Anti
Trust Law Will Be Placed
on Trial in Chicago Dis
trict Court.
(National News Association)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. The appli
cation of the Chicago Beef packers in
the U. S. supreme court for a stay in
the proceedings in their trial for crim
inal violation of the anti-trust law was
denied today. The decision of the
court was announced officially by
Chief Justice White and was without
any written opinion. As a result of
the decision the trial of the packers
before the district court of Chicago
will be resumed tomorrow, the exten
sion of time allowed by Judge Car
penter to permit the packers to appeal
to Ihe supreme court expiring at that
time. Some of the attorneys for the
beef packers Were in the court room
when the chief Justice announced the
decision.
Judge Koolsaat quashed bis tempor
ary writ of habeas corpus on Novem
ber 18, on the ground that a circuit
judge had do right to issue such an
Instrument unless the proceedings
were "extraordinary," and the case
was conducted to go on trial the fol
lowing Monday, before Judge George
A. Carpenter, of the Unit4 States
District Court of Chicago.
On November 21, however, Judge
Carpenter granted a stay of . trial on
application of, the Packers' counsel
setting forth a desire to seek a stay of
trial from the Supreme courts ,
Supreme court was not tn session
at the time and. Chief Justice White
refused to grant such an Instrument
on his own Initiative, holding that the
matter must be taken under advise
ment by the court as a whole. On No
vember 25 Judge Carpenter set the
trial for December 6. and the Barons
laid plans to take the matter before
the Supreme Court soon after that
body convened.
The prosecution of the beef trust
officials Is the most extensive ever at
tempted under the criminal provision
of the Sherman anti-trust law. They
are charged with forming a combina
tion In restraint of trade, which, it is
alleged, controls absolutely the price
of fresh meat in the United States. If
convicted the packers are liable to a
fne of $5,000, or, imprisonment for
one year, or both.
There Are Five Counts.
There are live counts in the indict
ments charging the packers with hav
ing entered Into a conspiracy to con
trol the fresh meat prices of the coun
try and two in each of the other in
dictments, vis: one charging the for
mation of the National Packing Com
pany as a means of controlling the
fresh meat prices and the other seek
ing to monopolise the fresh meat bus
iness contrary o the Sherman Anti
Trust Law.

Barons approaches the thousand mil
lion mark and they have engaged some

The newest form of reconnaissanoj at Tripoli. A cavalryman picking up
a dispatch just dropped by the airman that lie may ride to headauarter
with it. From a sketch from the London Illustrated News, When the aero
plane takes flight for a scouting expedition, acavalryman escorts it as
far as he can with reasonable safety. It is his business to act as dispatch-rider
between the airman and headquarters. The aviator, having
scribbled his notes, makes a rough package of them, and drops them as
nearly as possible at the cavalryman's feet. Then they are picked up and
carried to their destination, while a second horseman takes the place of
the first. Thus a series of messengers serve the airman, who is kept in
close touch with his commanding officer. It may here be noted that the air
man acting as bomb-dropper fills each bomb as he wants it while he is in
flight, holding the case between his knees and the schew-cap between his
teeth, and pouring the ingredients in as best he can. He does not start his
flight with bombs loaded, lest, by mischance, he should fall to the ground,
thus cause the bombs to explode, and so be hoist with his own petard.
Each bomb is about the size of an orange, and is of steel.
DUTY OF SURGEON
RELATED' TO JURY
Interesting Instructions by
Court in the King
Damage Case.
Definition of the duties imposed up
on physicians and surgeons, as these
duties are recognized in the eyes of
the law, is made by Judge H. C. Fox
of the circuit court in his instructions
to the jury, deliberating on the mal
practice case of Leota King against
Dr. Frank Harold, who demands $2ji)00
damages for alleged unskillful treat
ment of a double fracture of her little
finger on the left hand. The jury re
ceived the case Tuesday afternoon af
ter four days of testimony and argu
ment. Tersely the court ruled that when a
physician or surgeon held himself out
to the public as such he must possess
the ordinary qualifications and skill,
usually and ordinarily possessed by
physicians and surgeons practicing in
the same neighborhood. He does not
have to be rarely .endowed with skill,
but must in accepting cases, exercise
reasonable care and his best judgment.
He is liable for an injury only when
he does not exercise ordinary care and
his best judgment, as these qualifica
tions in a prficticioner are recognized
in the community in which he prac
tices. Mrs. King was injured in March
1909. She said that Dr. Harold re
duced the double fracture by binding
it in adhesive tape without inserting
splits. The physician alleged he did
use cardboard splints, winding the
tape about these. Physicians and sur
geons were called upon the stand to
testify in the capacity of experts as
medicine and surgery is practiced in
this city. They approved of the meth
od which Dr. Harold said he employ
ed In reducing and treating the frac
ture. THE WEATHER

MAYOR IN FAVOR OF
TRACITELEVATIOII
Says Railroad Crossings Are
Too Dangerous To
Advise with Neff.
Deploring the conditions of the rail
road crossings in this city regarding
the matter of safe-guarding the public
from accidents. Mayor Zimmerman at
the meeting of the board of public
works Monday made a motion to the
effect that in any future conference
between the board and the officials of
the Pennsylvania railroad company,
that the board insist upon the tracks
of the company being elevated so as
to permit undergrade crossings. Mayor
Zimmerman declared that the cross
ings were entirely too dangerous un
der the present arrangement for guar
ding them.
It is estimated it would require an
enormous sum to raise' the tracks of
the company, and there is a great deal
of doubt among city officials as to
whether the railroad company would
ever consider the advisability of ele
vating the tracks.
At a previous meeting of the board
of public works the mayor made a mo
tion to the effect that both railroad
companies be forced to maintain elec
tric are lights at every railroad cross
ing, and to station watchmen at the
crossings, both day and night. Nettle
ton Neff, superintendent of the Rich
mond division of the road, has re
quested the board to do nothing fur
ther with this matter until he can con
fer with the board.
The -board desires to widen West
Main street from Fifth street to the
corporation . line and - instructed the
civil engineer to prepare plans and
specifications for this.

Ad INVESTIGATING
COMMITTEE NAMED
FOR THE HOSPITAL
Mayor Zimmerman Last Eve
ning Appointed Three Citi
zens and Three Council
men to Do the Work.
ACTED ON REQUEST
MADE BY TRUSTEES
Councilman Waidele Tem
porarily Relieved of His
Official Duties Because of
His Poor Health.
In accordance to the request of the
board of trustees of the Reid Memor
ial hospital Mayor Zimmerman at
council meeting last evening appointed
a committee composed of Alfred Bavis,
chairman, Councilmen Kauffman,
Burdsall and Williams, and Edward
Harris and Edward Warfel to investi
gate conditions at the institution. The
committee was urged to make a thor
ough investigation of the books and
the .management of the hospital.
IThe request for the investigation
was made in a letter from John H.
Johnson, secretary of the board of
trustees, following the report sub
mitted to council at a previous meet
ing by Councilman Frank L. Waidele,
of the Seventh ward, in which he al
leged the institution could be better
managed and placed upon a paying ba
sis. Scope of The Probe.
The main points upon which the
committee will work are those brought
out in the report, which charged mis
management. The report alleges that
for the care of railroad patients only
$1.50 per day per patient is charged,
while for other patients $1.90 per day
is charged.
It further alleged that money being
expended for the comfort of nurses
at the hospital should be devoted rto
the treatment and care of the patients.
The report claims that more nurses
are employed at the Reid hospital than
at other hospitals, comparatively
speaking. The committee will also in
vestigate the statement contained in
the report to the effect that if physi
cians were appointed on the board of
tfustaea InsUtuUoaould he man
aged more successfully.
The trustees assure the investigat
ing committee that nothing will be
kept from it, and that everything con
nected with the hospital in any way
will be open for inspection.
Councilman Frank Waidelee, who
submitted the report on the hospital,
and who is now confined there owing
to a nervous breakdown, caused by
worry over the matter, was extended
the sympathy of his colleagues in a
resolution presented by Councilman
Weishaupt, last evening, and unani
mously adopted. '
"Mr. Waidele is a hard working and
ardent councilman, and the work he
had done for the citizens has brought
on a serious collapse," Mr. Weishaupt
said. "I move that we, as a body, ex
tend to bim our sympathy and as a to
ken of appreciation of his work send
him a bunch of flowers and an expres
sion of hope for his speedy recovery."
Mr. Weishaupt was appointed chair
man of a committee to present the res
olution and flowers to Mr. Waidele.
A request was made to council by
Dr. F. P. Busche, Mr. Waidele's phy
sician, to relieve him of his council
manic duties until he is fully recover
ed. Dr. Busche stated in a letter to
council that Mr. Waidele's physical
condition will not allow him to resume
his duties in council for some time.
Consequently Mr. Waidele will be re
moved from the chairmanship of the
contract and franchise committee and
another member of council will be ap
pointed. Mayor Zimmerman stated that
he would not make public the name
of the councilman whom he will place
at the head of this committee until the
next meeting night.
SENTENCE TDD LIGHT
Local Labor Leaders Dis
pleased with Judgment.
In no uncertain terms members of
various local unions expressed them
selves on Monday upon the McXamara
case, declaring that union men here
as well as in other parts of the coun
try were led to believe the McXamara
brothers were not guilty and they re
ceived a large amount of money and
support from thousands of union men
by misleading them.
When the news that James B. Mc
Xamara waj given a life sentence and
John B., his brother was sentenced to
fifteen years in prison was heard, sev
eral union men declared that the sen
tences were too light. They declared
that James B. McXamara, should have
been hanged and that his brother
should have received a life sentence.
While the majority of local union
men believed the McXamara brothers
innocent and falsely accused, it Is said
that very litUe money was given to
ward their defense. The various an
ions were not assessed the same
amount, although every union was
asked to contribute as much as pos
sible toward the defense of the two
men.
TRUST PROBLEM IS
DEALT WITH TODAY
BY THE PRESIDENT
In His Message to Congress
the Chief Executive Asks
Legislation to Supplement
Sherman Law.
TAKES ISSUE WITH
ROOSEVELT'S VIEWS
Denies Government Intends
Confiscating the Property
of Any of the Offending
Corporations.
The President's Message, in full,
will be found on the first page of
the second section of this issue.
(National News Association)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. President
Taft sent a special message to con
gress today dealing exclusively with
the trust problem. The President
gave his own views on its solution,
demanded legislation to supplement
the Sherman anti-truBt law and took
direct issue with criticism of the dis
solution plan for the American Tobac
co company, as expressed by ex-President
Theodore Roosevelt in The Out
look. Among the recommendations made
by President Taft are demands for a
law specifically defining "restraint of
trade and suppression of competition,"
a federal corporation commission and
a federal incorporation act. He up
holds the Sherman law and defends
the results of litigation under that
measure.
In defending the action of the U. S.
supreme court in the Standard Oil
decision, in reading the .word "unreas
onable" into the law, President Taft
deplored the agitation for the repeal
of the law which has sprung up since
the Standard and American Tobacco
trusts were dissolved.
Cites Court Rullncs.
The message, which contains be
tween 6,000 and 7,000 words is accom
panied by numerous extracts from
court decisions to uphold Mr. Taft's
contentions.
One feature of the message is con
tained in a paragraph in which Pres
ident Taft disavows the intention of
the government of confiscating prop
erty of offending corporations. The
President calls attention to the fact
that imprisonment is one form of pun
ishment provided for in the anti-trust
law for offenders.
Mr. Taft declares that the Sherman
law protects business and says that
"the mere size of a corporation is no
sin against the anti-trust" law.
In his plea for supplemental legisla
tion to the Sherman act, the President
says that it would be a great aid to
the government in bringing future anti-trust
suits because the proceedings
could charge a misdemeanor instead
of the cumbersome method of charg
ing a conspiracy and naming an unus
ually large number of defendants.
Mr. Taft advocates that the bureau
of corporations be a tribunal of the
dignity and power of the comptroller
of currency and be modelled after the
interstate commerce commission. He
call the anti-trust law "the expression
of effort of liberty loving people to
preserve equality of opportunity."
"For twenty years," he said, "this
statute (Sherman law) was on the
statute books. All knew its general
purpose and approved. Many of its
violators were cynical over its as
sumed impotence."
DEFEAT JUIMERMAII
Moose Elect Smelser Lodge
Physician.
Members of the Moose lodge held
one of the most enjoyable meetings of
the year Monday evening at K. of P.
temple. The evening's program in
cluded the initiation of fifty candi
dates, the work being done by the fa
mous Anderson degree team, followed
by a banquet. The election of offi
cers developed an interesting race be
tween Dr. S. G. Smelser and Dr. W.
W. Zimmerman for lodge physician,
which went to Dr. Smelser by a com
fortable majority. The other officers
elected include John Darnell, dictator;
Clyde Ryan, vice dictator; J. C. Ryan,

LIFE FOR IM MMMMt - AID
15 YEARS FOR
BILLBOARDS ARE
CALLED
Fire Chief Opposes Placing
Such Advertising on the
Tops of Buildings.
Attention was called by Councilman
Kauffman to the building at 22 South
Eighth street which is being remodel
ed and he said hi did not believe it
would be of fireproof construction.
The Are chief suited that the build
ing is one of the poorest constructed
within the fire limits but that it passes
the requirements of the fire regula
tions. The building code, which is still
pending before council, will bo taken
up in the near future at a joint meet
ing of council and the Commercial
Club and it is thought the code, if
passed by council, will compel the con
struction of better buildings.
Councilman Evans petitioned coun
cil to have the sidewalk on both sid. s
of North D street, leading to the Do
ran bridge, roughened so that there
would be little danger of any one slip
ping on the walks. He also recommen
ded that a flagman be staUoned at the
C. & O. railroad crossing at North
Third and D streets, and to force the
company to keep the crossing free
from ice and snow.
To Have Viaduct.
Speaking on this matter the mayor
said that there is little doubt but that
a viaduct under the C. & O. railroad at
First and South D would be construct
ed in the near future.
The report of the city controller for
the month of November was read. It
follows :
Cash on hand Nov. 1 $22,403.62
Receipts , 30,564.19
Total 152,967.91
Total disbursements 14,586.17

Signs and bill-boards on the top of
buildings are very dangerous in the
opinion of Fire Chief Ed. Miller. He
said so in. council meeting last even-
kng.-ThefrecWeta
ordered some big signs torn down
from the tops of buildings and would
not issue permits for any more to be
erected. He declared that they are
very dangerous to pedestrians, owing
to the possibility of strong winds blow
ing them over. This contention of the
fire chief was heartily concurred in by
the mayor.
An Indianapolis company. Chief Mil
ler said, had asked permission to be
allowed to erect billboards and large
signs on the tops of buildings in this
city in the business district but had
been refused. On account of this re
fusal the chief said the company in
tended to appeal to the city council.
Miller asked that council support him
in the stand he had taken.
The chief stated further that these
signs would be a hindrance to the fire
department in case of fires.
The subject of billboards was
broached by Councilman King who de
clared that the newly erected sign at
Tenth and Main streets was danger
ous to pedestrians and that it is very
unsightly. He declared that all bill
boards in the center of the city should
be removed. However, the city attor
ney stated that according to the exist
ing ordinance such billboards were
permitted in any part of the city, as
long as they were erected under the
permission of the ire chief.
Some members of council, however,
did not agreee with Mr. King in regard
to billboards. They stated that they
hid unsightly lots from the public view
and in fact were an improvement to
some parts of the city.
OXENDINE LOCATES
LONG LOST SISTER
To accompany his long lost sister
back to this city, Simpson Oxendine,
colored janitor on the first floor of the
court house, will leave this evening
for Roanoke, Va., where he will meet
his sister, Mrs. Sarah Rawley, of Mt.
Airy, North Carolina, from whom he
was separated' in 1868, when he left
home and came north. Oxendine is
now 66 years old and bis sister is 57.
As ripe old age approaches, it has
become a passion with Oxendine to be
reunited with his sisters and broth
ers. Each year in the past few years
he has been successful in locating one
or more of the members and each time
has been the occasion of a happy re
union. All but one, a brother, has been
located by Oxendine, and Oxendine
will be sublimely happy when he is
reunited with him. His only clew is
that his brother left home soon after
he did and went to Mississippi.

MENACE
BROTHER JOHN
Judge Bordwell on Monday
Morning Sentences the.
Two Self Confessed Dyna
miters After the Pleas.
STATE DID NOT ASK
EXECUTION OF JAMESL
Judge Tells Author of Times
Outrage His Excuse 1
Poor One and He Is a Mur-"
derer at Heart.
(National News Association)1
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5. James Br
McXamara, confinement in San Quen-"
tin penitentiary for the term of his
natural life; John J. McNamara, fif
teen years imprisonment.
The above sentence from the lips of
Judge Bordwell sealed the fate of the
notorious McNamara brothers, con
fessed dynamiters of the Times build
ing and the Llewellyn Iron Works of
Los Angeles, and credited with com
plicity in nearly one hundred other
dynamite outrages throughout the Un- .
ited States.
James B. McNamara's sentence con
stitutes his punishment for the con
fessed explosion of the Times building
where 21 lives were lost.
John J. McNamara's Imprisonment
was for the confessed responsibility .
for the Llewellyn explosion, commit- -ted
by Ortie McManigaL In which the '
monetary loss was many thousands of'
dollars.
James Sentenced.
James was the first to be ordered
by Judge Bordwell to the stand. Asked
for his full name he replied, "James ,
Barnabas McNamara." He said he
knew no reason why sentence should
not be pronounced. Then Prosecutor
Fredericks arose and announced the
judge could fix the penalty in two
ways life imprisonment or death, ad
ding that no bargain had been made
in the case, but the plea of mercy was '
based on the fact that Jim's confes- "
slon settled a question forever, upon0
which otherwise some doubts may ;
have existed. Addressing Jim McNa
mara the Judge said there waa little ?
comfort in the atatament that the tak- &
Ing of human life was not intended
by the explosion. Any person who
would place sixteen sticks of dyna
mite under a building full of people , v
must have been a murderer at heart.
The widows and orphans left alive
have another story the judge said. "
Then John J., dressed in black with
a high , collar and a black tie, was
ordered to stand up. He hung his
head and chewed furiously on a wad
of gum. He gave his full name as
John Joseph McNamara. ' Prosecutor
Fredericks suggested to the court to
fix the sentence so John J. would have .
only a few years of life after his
term expired. "You have heard the
court's remarks to your brother," said
Judge Bordwell, "and in no small way, ' I
sir, they apply to you." The court
then pronounced fifteen years impris
onment as the penalty for the crime.
The brothers were then led back to
the Jail, Judge Bordwell left the bench,
and the court room was left In great
confusion. Both prisoners displayed
considerable nervousness in the court
room.
... Brothers Are Nervous.
The McNamara brothers showed
grave signs of losing their nerve dur
ing the forenoon, but Joseph ScotC
one of their attorneys, spent several
hourse buoying up their spirits as .
much as possible.
Judge Bordwell informed the news
paper men that the sentences would
be pronounced in the court room df
judge McCormick, of the superior
court located in the Hall or Records,
which is connected with the county
jail by the "bridge of sighs." This
change was arranged with great se- '
crecy. : Intense excitement prevailed
in all the court buildings and a large j
guard of detectives and deputy sher
iffs were on hand at the Hall of Rec
ords, carefully scrutinising everybody
in the corridors, which were jammed, ' t
the doors of the court room being kept
locked.
McManigal was apparently very hap- l
py. He stated today that in addition
to the strong evidence in the case he
was also influenced to turn state's ev
idence because he feared the McNa
maras might "double-cross" him.
Jim's proposition to go hunting after
the completion of proposed Detroit
jobs made him suspicious of being '
foully, dealt with, he said. Clarence
Darrow declared today he never told
Gompers the McNamaras were guilty,
because Gomper's didn't ask.

James B. McNamara's brief confes
sion, penned by himself, bearing evi
dences of a man little skilled in let- T
ters, follows: i . ; . ,,
"On the night of September thir
tieth, 1910, at 5:45 p. m., I placed in
