lessage ol President Grant I
Isame subject. As regards
lotion, the time of that had
pe. but, the President con- ?
eluded, the dignity and honor of
the United States would be firm
ly upheld in any event.
Our relations with Hawaii
were reviewed and the hope ex
pressed that, in the event of the
Senate's ratification of the pend
ing treaty of annexation, of
which he seemed assured, Con
gress would so provide for the
government of the Islands that a
reasonable amount of local self
rule would be guaranteed.
The changing affinities of sev
eral Central American States had
caused a muddle over the real
duties of onr representatives,
which Cong, ess might be called
upon to settle. The President
expressed the desire that work
on the Nicaragua Canal be push
ed rapidly forward.
Referring to the work of the
Bimetallic Commission, Mr. Mc
Kinley expressed his hope of the
ultimate bringing about of an in
ternational agreement, and prais
ed Prance for her active co-op
eration jn the work of the Com
mission.
Reciprocity negotiations were
reported to be moving ahead
under the direction oi the newly
appointed commissioner. J. A.
Kasson, and it was urged that
ourcommerce be further extend
ed by attention to the needs of
the merchant marine.
The outcome of negotiations
for the protection of the seal herd
in Bering Sea was said to be
hopeful. Arbitration is passed
over with a word of belief in and
.will!
the pending arrangements for
the Paris Exposition received a
word of praise, and Congress
was urged to provide liberally
for an American exhibit at the
great fair.
Passing to home affairs the
President spoke of the impera
tive need for the navy of armor
plate to complete battleships now
building, and of dry-docks of
sufficient size to accommodate
our largest war vessels, and re
commended the building of a new
battleship for the Pacific coast.
The steadily increasing popu
lation of Alaska, owing to the
gold fields, led the President to
urge a more thorough govern
ment for the Territory. He con
curred in Secretary Alger's re
commendation that troops be
sent, and promised that Govern
ment relief should, if possible,
be sent to the starving miners.
The opposition which theDawes
Commission experienced in seek
ing to bring about an allotment
of the lands of the Five Indian
Tribes might, in the President's
view, soon necessitate action by
Congress to relieve the many
white settlers in Indian Territo
ry
In view of the dread ravages
of yellow fever in the South, tha
recommandation is made that the
quarantine regulations be revis
ed and thatan expert commission
of four be named to inquire into
the caase of tbe disease.
The sale of the Union Pacific
was commented on and thepend>'
ing bale of the Kansas-Pacific led!
to the inquiry whether the road:!
should be allowed to go for a sum
far UDder the Government's^
claim or the Government protect
its interests by becoming owner;
of the road.
In conclusion the President ex-'!
pressed his adherence to civil?
service principles, but stated that:
changes would be made in tha~
rules as the necessity of the ser
vice demanded.
MARION COUNTY.
Charges Against Certain Of

(JTIET DELL.
West Virginia Bnildlnp Stone.
Ed. Telegram:-I eame to this
place as Mr. Lynch's foreman,
expecting to open a quarry fce
lodging to Mr. D. H. Dans, at
the mouth of Brushy Fork. But
as Mr. Lynch did not do the work
and as Mr. Davis is expecting to
furnish the rock for the bridge
on the Short Line R. R , he de
cided to open the quarry. So
to-day we put off the first blast,
Using nine (9) kegs of powder
and six (6) sticks of dynamite.
It lifted about 60 feet in length,
*nd the quarry is 30 feet deep,
moving about S00 yards of stone.
I have worked in 15 States and
three Territories, but this is
among the finest quarries of sand
stone I ever saw. A part of it is
light gray and a part of it a fine
blue, which is equally as good or
superior to Brear sandstone of
Cleveland, Ohio, which I think is
the standard sandstone of ttie
United States.
The quarry is entirely free
from seams, checks and also free
from all foreign substances and
discolorations.

Somewhat of a sensation was
created in the Circuit Court at
Fairmont on Monday afternoon
by the presentation of charge*
against R. L. Cunningham, sher
iff, and G. M. Alexander, prose
cuting attorney. The presenta
tion was made by A. T. HU1
through his attorney, Mr. W. H.
Martin. The charges are in sub
stance that the officials named
have received money from the
houses of ill fame and speakea
sies ot this community and have
contracts with the keepers of the
same. Judge Mason, on Tuesday
morning, ruled that said char^~
be set aside, as they had not 1
presented in proper foj
Martmaccorfmgiy wijtf
growth of the indictments just
found against Hiil and bis wit
nesses.
A War Piny That Pleasr*.
.' On Monday evening Dec. 13th
is patrons of the opera house
will again have an opportunity
to see the celebrated military
drama "The Girl I Left Behind
Me." This is one of the most
[iBDCcessful plays in elaborated
'productions ever put forth from
the Metropolis. It is calculated
on exciting lines and based on
'theatrical facts. The cast in
cludes 17 people and each one of
tbem plays an important part in
helping on the action. The
piece revolves Ground a war in
the far West between the Black
foot Indians and a detachment
of the American army. In rapid
succession occur the scenes of J
love, hate, regret, animosity and
turbulence.
Ex. U. S. Senator B. K. Bruce
1 the colored statesman from Mis
i sissippi has agaia been appointed
Register of the Treasury.
Arch Watkins, formerly of
Clatksburg and whose parents
still reside here, is said to have
mysteriously disappeared and his
friends think be has been foully
dealt with. Watkins had been
an attendant at the state hospital
for the insane, at Spencer, for
over it year. Some limn ago a
man from near Hintou was
brought to the hospital by rela
tives, but was refused admittance
as the authorities were not satis
fled of his insanity. Watkins
was employed there by bim to
return homo with him as his pro
tector, he bellving his relatives
?were trying to get possession of
is property. Watkins wrote to
.rente here ..frequently and
e had always
written home regularly, his par
ents became alarmed, but re
ceived no answers to their num
erous letters, and when there
came a letter from a young
lady at Spencer to whom Wat
kins is said to be engaged, say
ing she had not heard from him
for about two months, they be
came satisfied that he had been
foully dealt with, and every
effort will be made to bring the
perpetrators of what they be
lieve to be a cold blooded murder
to justice.
| It is with much pleasure that
j the management of the Opera
House announce to their patrons
| the return of Julius Cahn's mlli
; tary production, "The Girl I
Left Behind Me." Monday, Dec.
113. We all remember with pleas
ure that beautiful play "The
i Charity Ball." The same author
, wrote ' 'The Girl." The scene is
laid around a military post in
, Montana, and, although there
are soldiers, Indians and carbines
[ in the piece, there is not a shot
fired in the plav. The many
thrilling scenes are admirably
interwined with the young peo
ple's love scenes and flirtation s.
