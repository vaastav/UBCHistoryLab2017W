attention upon the printed pages.
Opposition to the proposed immedi
ate congressional investigation of the
sugar import scandals in the New
York custom house, and likewise to
any further revision of the tariff at
present; absence of any specific rec
ommendation regarding the crisis in
Nicaragua, and actual recommenda
tion of legislation to forbid the issu

notic in labor controversies, and for
the establishment of a system of pos
tal savings banks, may be considered
the most striking features of the first
annual message of President Taft to
congress.
The Nicaraguan question, conserva
tion of the nation's natural resources,
needed amendments to the anti trust
and interstate commerce acts, and the
contemplated ervision of the federal
statutes governing the organization of
the armed forces of the nation in time
of war are all reserved for possible
treatment later in special messages
Country Prosperous.
In his message, which bulks some
17,000 words, Mr. Taft reports the
country to be "in a high state of pros
perity," and he adds that "there is
every reason to believe that we are
on the eve of a substantial business
expansion, and we liave just garnered
a harvest unexampled in the market
value of our agricultural products."
The president expresses entire con

IN HATTIESBURG
On Their Way to Conference They
Take Advantage of Opportunity
to Visit Magic City.
Many Hattiesburg citizens are today
enjoying the pleasure of acting as
host to a large number of ministers
of the Methodist church who, on their
way to attend the annual conference,
which convenes at Brookhaven tomor
row, took advantage of the opportu
nity to stop off and take a look at
the city of which they have all heard
so much.
Many of the divines were heard to
express themselves as being very
agreeably surprised at the wonderful
advancement made by Hattiesburg in
the recent past, and were over
wnelmed at the hospitality of our citi
zens and the many courtesies shown
them.
The visitors will remain in the city

STUMBLING
01 Constitutional Convention Are
Growing More Numerous As
Time Passes.
OPPOSITION NOW
WORKING OVERTIME
in
A new stumbling block, which at this
juncture it is difficult to Bee how they j
are going to get around, has been
placed in the path of the South Mis-'
sissippi members of the legislature
who are clamoring for a constitutional
convention I
A New Impediment Has Been Thrown
In the Path of Those Who Are
Working for Relief of the Southern
Counties of Mississippi,
The chief grievances of the people
of this section is the inequitable appor-'
tionment of membership in the legis
lature, and the unequal distribution of
the public school funds. It is gener
ally conceded that the counties in this
district have not been fairly treated
in these matters, and that they have
not at present a representation propor
tionate to population.
A Just Contention.
More than this, it is unanimously
conceded by fair-minded people that
there is much justice in their conten
tion that the organic law should be re
vised, but the argument is now brought
forward that it will be impossible to
arrange a more ■ equitable apportfon
ment until the Federal census is tak
en, and the statistics showing the pop
ulation of Mississippi will of course
not be available until the year 1911.
It will therefore be impossible for
{ the legislature to frame a new basis
of representation without official sta
tistics showing the population of each 1
!
|
' county, and the demands of this sec-,
tion will meet with much opposition on i
; this ground alone, regardless of the
merits of the claims being made.
|

j
j Another argument that is being ad
vanced against the constitutional con
vention movement is the fact that a
I- goodly number of the southern coun-j
ties, in order to relieve the burden
which they believe had been unjustly j
imposed upon them, deliberately
duced their assessments for the cur-;
purposes, j
and on the ground that they were:
bearing more than their just propor- j
tion of the burden of state govern -1
ment. This has cost the convention !

This Question Will Be Debated
At The Next Session ol
Legislature.
LAWMAKERS SAID
TO OE SATISFIED
With the Present Arrangement, But a
Large Element of States Citizenship
Is Opposed To It—Amendments
Probable.
Special to The News.
Jackson, Miss., Dec. 7.—The question
of what to do with the state and
county convicts, with especial refer
ence to whether or not they shall be
worked on the public roads or con
tinue to till the state and county
farms, will unquestionably be brougnt
forcibly before the legislative session
convenes early in January,
should there seem to be the most re
mote chance of having it considered,
and provided the governor will give
his sanction to the presentation of it.
While the proportion of the citi
zens of the state who favor a change
in the states penal system is believed
to he comparatively small, as com
pared with the number who are sat
isfied with the present arrangement,
there are those who strenuously op
pose making cotton with convict
| labor.
j This opposition is generally based
on the theory that they are in com
petition with free citizens, and ap
parently forgets that, no matter what
work they do, if they labor at all,
they will be in competition with some
body, or will be doing something that
someone else would otherwise do.

Lawmakers Satisfied.
A large majority of the lawmakers
who have expressed themselves at all
on the subject are quite satisfied with
the general plan now in operation, al
though some minor amendments are
I su KSested fro™ time to time.
An idea which has gained

i 11 is estimated that in most of the
counties the addition of the state pris

j would not more than double the num

j prisoners have the longer terms, and
therefore keep up the pro rata.
