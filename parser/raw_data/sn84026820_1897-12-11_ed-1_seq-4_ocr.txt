FEEDING NEW CORN.
Being Difficult to Digest, Much Is Wasted.
Grinding the Corn.
Much of the corn crop this year will
be soft. It will be what farmers call
new corn until freezing dries out its
surplus moisture. Yet the hogs have to
be fattened for slaughtering in Decem
ber or January, and there will have to
be a good deal of it fed out without dry
ing to cows and other stock. American
Cultivator has the following to say on
the subject of feeding new com:
Probably the cow can get more good
ont of soft com than any other farm an
imal. She will bring it up and remasti
cate it, insuring partial digestion if she
has not had an overfeeding of com, for
it must be remembered that all com is
hard to digest, and when it is full of
moisture it is more so than ever.
Grind the com, even if into coarse
bits, and it is made much more easy to
digest. When fattening hogs are fed
fine com meal, some of it will go
through them undigested, but when
new com is fed to stock the part that
fails to digest is mnch greater. It is
very hard to grind new corn. The mois
ture in it makes the grain stick to the
grinding apparatus. But if some well
dried oats, com or barley are mixed
with the com not yet dried out it will
grind mnch better. When it is desired
to grind corn on the cob, the trouble is
that the cob breaks into large pieces, in
stead of being ground as it should. But
if whole grain of any kind is mixed
with tho ears so as to fill
spaces the cob will grind perfectly. For
feeding cows and other homed cattle
there is an advantage in grinding com
in t | le ear The ground cob makes the
, . . . ° ^ A •. ji
i nutriment less concentrated and it di
; ß e f bctter ff . .. fpd to
As new soft com is usually fed to
hogs, a great part of its nutrition IS
-wasted. It is so-jnuch harder to digest
than the same com after it has dried,
that it is much better to feed sound corn
if it can bo bad and reserve the soft
com until it dries out by freezing. There
is great shrinkage during this drying
out process, but there is more fattening
quality in the smaller quantity than
there is in tho larger.
Com is almost universally fed while
it is full of the juices of the stalk and
cob. If the feeding of the crop were
spread out during the whole winter, in
stead of being confined to fall and one
of the winter months, the gain from
feeding it would be far greater than it
is. Much of the larger part of this sea
son's com crop will be fed to hogs, cat
tle and sheep between now and next
January or February at furthest. It is
done to hurry up the fattening, but ow
ing to the indigestibility of new com
much of it is wasted. The pork and
beef thus made are neither so palatable
nor so healthy as tbe same would be if
hogs and cattle were fed from their ear
liest period sufficient to keep them in
thrifty and growing condition. It is the
common practice of wasting new com
during the fall and winter months that
makes this impossible. A small amount
of grain given while animals are at
grass in summer will produce far more
flesh and of a better quality than a
much larger quantity fed as wastefully
as new corn usually is.
Successful Wintering of Bees.
Whatever method be followed in win
tering bees certain conditions regarding
the colony itself are plainly essentiaL
First, it shonld have a good queen; seo
ond, a fair sized cluster of healthy bees,
neither too old nor too young; third, a
plentiful supply of good food. The third
essential, good food, says Frank Benton,
assistant entomologist, department of
agriculture, is secured if the hive is lib
erally supplied with well ripened hon
ey from any source whatever, or with
fairly thick sirup, made from white
cane sugar, which was fed early enough
to enable tbe bees to seal it over before
ihey ceased flying Fifteen to 20 pounds
lor outdoor wintering in the south, up
to 80 or 40 pounds in the north, when
wintered outside with but slight pro
tection, or if wintered indoors 15 to 20
pounds may be considered a fair supply
of winter food.
A smaller amonnt should not be trust
ed except in case much greater protec
tion be furnished against the effects of
severe weather than is usually giveu. A
greater amount of stores will do no
harm if properly arranged over and
abont the «enter of the cluster, or in
case the combs are narrow wholly above
the cluster. In many instances it will
be a benefit by equalizing in a measure
the temperature in the hive as weU as
by giving to the bees greater confidence
in extending tbe brood nest in early
spring.

A Potato Crop That Paid.
Cornell university at Ithaca, N. Y.,
is a noted agricultural college and ex
periment station. Usually most of the
experiments are made without caring
much for profit. But this year the man
agers determined to grow potatoes on a
scale sufficiently large to determine
whether this crop can be grown cheap
ly enough under scientific treatment to
make the crop profitable. The season,
as all know, was very unfavorable for
potatoes wet through the summer and
dry as the potatoes should be maturing.
Yet, as reported by American Cultiva
tor, on the field fertilized with 20 loads
of stable manure per acre tbe yield per
acre was 3S0 bushels and on land un
fertilized was 300 bushels. As the gen
eral average of the potato crop in New
York is only 65 bushels per acre, the
farmers at Cornell have reason to con
gratulate themselves on their success.
The station potatoes were also free from
rot, due doubtless to the liberal use of
bordeaux mixture and other fungicides.
At present prices of potatoes the crop
this year is undoubtedly a pay
lug owe.

RETURNS FROM AN APIARY.
, i
A Moderate Estimate For a Fairly Good
Locality.
Apiculture, like all other branches of
agriculture, depends largely upon the
natural resources of the location, and
tho favorableness or unfavorableness of
any particular season, no matter how
skillful the management, may make
great differences in the year's return.
The knowledge, skill, industry and
promptness of the one who undertakes
the care of the apiary have likewise
much to do with the return. Further
more, profits are of course largely affect
ed by the nature and proximity of the
markets. Frank Benton, assistant ento
mologist of the agriculture department
at Washington, writing in this connec
tion, says:
À moderate estimate for a fairly good
looality would be 80 to 85 pounds of ex
tracted honey or 20 pounds of comb
honey per colony. This presupposes
good wintering and an average season.
When two or more of the important
honey yielding plants are present in
abundance and are fairly supplemented
by minor miscellaneous honey plants,
the locality may be considered excellent,
and an expectation of realizing more
than the yield mentioned above may be
entertained. With extracted honey of
good quality at its present wholesale
price of 6 to 7 cents per pound and comb
honey at 12 to 18 cents, each hive should
under favorable circumstances give a
gross annual return of $2.50 to $3. From
this about one-third is to be deducted to
cover expenses other than the item of
labor. i.These will include the purchase
of comb foundation and sections, repairs,
eventual replacing of hives and imple
ments and the interest on the capital
invested.
By locating in some section particu
larly favorable to apiculture—that is,
near large linden forests, with clover
fields within range, supplemented by
buckwheat, or in a section where alfalfa
is raised for seed, where mesquite, Cal
ifornia sages and wild buckwheat
abound, where mangrove, palmettoes
and titi, or where sourvvood, tulip trees
and asters are plentiful—the net profits
here indicated may frequently be dou
bled or trebled.
But these favored locations are also
subject to reverses, the result of droughts,
great wet, freezes which kill back the
bee pasturage, etc., and, though some
years the profits are so much larger
than those named above as to lend a
very roseate hue to the outlook for the
accumulation of wealth on the part of
any one who can possess himself of a
hundred or two colonies of bees, the
beginner will do well to proceed cau
tiously, bearing m mind that mnch ex
perience is necessary to enable him to
turn to the best account seasons below
the average, while during poor seasons
it will take considerable understanding
of the subject, energetic action and some
sacrifice to tide over without disaster.
On the whole, there should be expected
from the raising of bees for any purpose
whatever only fair pay for one's time,
good interest on the money invested and
a sufficient margin to cover contingen
cies. With no greater expectations than
this from it, and where intelligence di
rects the work, apiculture will be found,
in the long run, to rank among the best
and safest of rural industries. _
NOTES ON COLD STORAGE.
Very Low Temperature Not Necessary if
the Air Is Kept Pure.
At the meeting in Detroit of the So
ciety For the Promotion of Agricultural
Science Professor Bane of the New
Hampshire Agricultural college read a
valuable paper on cold storage which
placed the matter on a novel basis. The
professor made it appear that a very
low temperature is not necessary pro
vided the air is kept pure. Following
are in brief some of the remarks made
by Professor Bane:
The first essential to this preservation
is pure air. For orchard fruits the tem
perature should be as low as possible
and be above freezing, grapes not need
ing so mnch cold. In from 84 to 36 de
grees, where light could be excluded
and the air kept pure and free from gas
es, the fruit will keep indefinitely.
The assumption that oxygen is tho
agent of decay is erroneous. The condi
tions which favor or avert plant growth
are the same as those which avert or
favor decay.
The presence of moisture favors de
cay. The first gas generated in a house
is carbonic acid gas, and it is the first
impurity found in a cold storage house.
If temperature is high, there is shrink
ing, then softening and loss of flavor.
Fruits in a vault in which a candle can
not be kept burning are affected as if by
frost. Remove this gas as soon as found
to be present
The temperature for preservation,
other things being right, was shown to
be not as low as generally supposed,
from 30 to 45 being given for apples, 45
to 65 for peaches, 46 for pears, 84 for
cabbages and 87 to 89 for fresh beet
Butter, Professor Rane said, shonld
have 23 degrees and be kept in a room
by itself.
A description of the station cold
storage house, which is on the north
side of the barn cellar, was given. The
floor is impervious to air. The all im
portant part of it is the ventilators which
are run across the cellar. The filling
between the sheathing is of fine shav
ings, packed as tight as possible. The
cost, including lumber and labor, was
given as $80. The system worked well.
Of 800 barrels put in the loss over win
ter was very light. Sold in the spring,
the price was for first quality. The only
expense of the keeping was the labor of
hauling. Potatoes stored in the same
house kept perfectly.
The principle, as explained in the
Philadelphia Ledger, which reported
the meeting, is in keeping rid of the
carbonic acid gas by changing the air
by ventilation instead of by the exceed
ingly more expensive and troublesome
method of chilling and freezing
Importers or ~»Ylndbreaks.
Windbreaks are placed next in im
portance to irrigation by E. P. Powell
of New York. Writing to The New
England Homestead he tells that in
Oneida county, N. Y., there is an or
chard of Red Astrakhans one half of
which has a windbreak of arbor vitse
hedge and the other none. The protect
ed part is in perfect condition, the oth
er part is nearly dead ; not a thoroughly
sound tree in it The crops show the
same difference. At another place there
are on one side of the street hedges and
groups of evergreens, on the north and
west on the other side is an open
sweep for the wind. The protected land
ripens lima beans and Isabella grapes and
is as good as a whole degree of latitude
warmer than the other. Our serions
trouble is not from cold, but from cold,
drying winds and speedy changes of
temperature.
He recommends evergreen screens
everywhere, not only hedges but screens
of trees, allowed to grow tall without
clipping. The arbor vit® is generally
best hemlock iu some localities. Nor
co wants more room, but is
The old plan of letting trees
grefw up in fence lines was right Too
mnch economy in clearing land is a mis
take. The proper trees for windbreaks
vary in different parts of the country,

HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION'.
By a special message dated the 16ih day
of June last, I laid before the Senate a trea
ty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries
of the United States and of the Republic of
Hawaii, having for its purpose the incor
poration of the Hawaiian Islands as an
integral part of the United States, and
under its sovereignty. The Senate having
removed the injunction of secrecy, al
though the treaty is still pending before
that body, the subject may be properly re
ferred to In this message, because the ne
cessary action of the Congress is required
to determine by legislation many details of
the eventual union should the fact of
annexation be accomplished, as I believe
it should be.
While consistently disavowing from a
very early period any aggressive poliey of
absorption in regard to the.Hawaiian group,
a large series of declarations through three
quarters of a century has proclaimed the
vital interest of the United States in the
independent life of the islands and their
intimate commercial dependence upon this
country. At the same time it has been
repeatedly assereted that in no event could
theentity of Hawaiian statehood cease by
the passage of the islands under the domliia
tion.or influence of another power than the
United States. Under these circumstances,
the logic of events required that annexa
tion, heretofore offered, but declined,
should in the ripeness of time come about
as the natural result of Ihe strengthening
ties that bind us to those islands and be
realized by the free will of the Hawaiian
state
That treaty was unamiously ratified
without amendment by the Senn « und
President of the Republic of Hawaii the
10th of September last, and only awu..s the*
favorable action of the American Senate to
effect the complete absorption of the is
lands into the domain of the United Stater.
What the conditions of such a union shall
be, the political relations thereof to the
United States, and degree of the elective
franchise of the inhabitants, the extension
of the Federal laws to the tei ritory or the
enactment of special laws to fit the peculiar
condition thereof, the regulation, if need
be, of the labor system therein, are all mat
ters which the treaty has wisely relegated
to the Congress.
If the treaty is confirmed, as every con
sideration of dignity and honor requires,
the wisdom of Congress will see to it that,
avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements
perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the
highest franchises of citizenship, and hav
ing due regard to the geographical condi
tions, the most just provisions for self-rule
iu local matters, with the largest political
liberties as an iutegial port of our nation
will be accorded to the Hawaiians. No
less is due to the people who after nearly
five years of demonstrated capability to ful
fill the obligations of self-governing state
hood, come of their free will to merge their
destinies in our body politic.
The questions which have arisen between
Japan and Hawaii by roaâbn of the treat
ment of Japanese laborers emigrating to
the islands under the Hawaiian-Japanese
convention of 1888, are in a satisfactory
stage of settlement by nego.iation. This
government has not been invited to medi
ate, and on the other hand has sought no
intervention in that matter, further than to
evince its kindliest disposition toward
such a speedy and direct adjustment by the
two sovereign states in interest as shall
comport with equity and honor. It is
gratifying to learn that the appréhensions
at first displayed on tbe part of Japan lest
the cessation of Hawaii's national life
through annexation might impair pri
vileges to which Japon honorably laid
claim, have given place lb confidence in
the uprightness of this government, and in
the sincerity ofits purpose to deal with all
possible ulterior questions in the broadest
spirit of friendliness.

.. Letter
In every life there must be sorrow!

which not even

Had President McKit ley followed
the example of his immediate predeces
sor, w ho rarely finished one of his mes
sages to Congress until the day before
Congress me*, his message would not
have been ready, but he completed the
message a week ago, and did not have
on his mind while traveling to the bed
side of his strickeu mother, from which
lie returned to Wa-hiugtnn In perform
the duties incumbent uu«u him a; the
opening of tbe session of Congr-ss.
As soon as those duties were performed
he started for Canton again, carrying
with him tbe sorrowful sympa' hies 'of
the whole couutry.
Tltree P's, patriotism, peace, aud
prosperity form tha keynote of Presi
dent McKinley's annual message to
Congress. His treatment of the an
nexation of Hawaii, tha Cuban and
other foreign q estious, including that
of commercial reciprocity, is patriotic
to the core, without (lie slightest trace
of jingoism, and his treatment of the
financial and oilier domestic questions
is that ef a man who only desires that
which will coulfuue and in cease tbe
prosperity the country is now begin
ning to eDjoy.
In addition to getting a first class
man to fill the important poaition of
Attorney General, President McKin
ley's choice of Gov. John W. Griggs,
of N. J., to fill the vacancy ia the
Cabinet that will be made by the nom

iiiation of Attorney General McKenna
to succeed Justice Field, who retired
from tbe U. S. Supreine Court last

than any t.riiis predeccs nrs, is 'em:»
sidered to be a good political move
one that will aid materially in keeping
New Jersey in Ihe Republican Column, j
aud the wish is general that Gov.
Griggs will accept the tendered poit
folio.
j
The activity in certain quarters in
tfforis to make the public lulieve that '
there is some doubt about the siimxh
tiou of Hawaii, indicates that situs
money is being spent for ihe purpose
of creating anti-annexation sentiment.
If so, it is being thrown away, as an
nexation is absolutely sure to couia be
fore tlie close of this season of Qon
gress. Two-thirds of the Senate are
ready at any time to vote for th > rati
fication of the annexation treaty, but
the rules of the Senate put it in the
power of the opponents—not more
than twenty at the outside—to delay
the vote. Should it become apparent
that this power is bding used for fili
bustering purposes, annexation will be
secured by legislation, which will only
need a majority vote.
The more conservative element in
Congress is strongly in favor of mak
ing this session as shot t as possible.
This sentiment was voiced by llepre
sentative Heatwole, of Minn., when he
said:
lu my opinion, this Cong:eas
sho lid git through its tontine work by
May 1, and adjourn. The smallest
amount of leeislutiou v. ill be of the
greatest benefit to the countiy, and if
we can finish und go home by that, date,
a good many millions of our couii'iy
men will rise up and call us blessed."
Speaker Reed says he sees no excuse at
present for make (he session a very
l.mg one.
