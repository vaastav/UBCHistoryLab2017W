MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT

Frame Up a Warm
Retort.
Christiania, Norway, Dec. 13.—'No
arrangements for the official recep­
tion of Henry Ford's expedition are
being made here. American Minister
Bchmedeman has receives no commu­
nication from the expedition, nor has
any other person of prominence ex­
cept the president of the Students' as­
sociation, who had a telegram from
Ford explaining his program and an­
nouncing that he proposes to remain
In Christiania two days and after­
ward to viBit Stockholm, Copenhagen
and The Hague.
The Students* association replied
that the party would be afforded an
opportunity of meeting the associa­
tion officially. The expeCltion is re­
garded here as being without any im­
portance or authority and merely a
piece of farcical bluff.
STAY QUIETLY AT HOME,
BERLIN ADVICE TO FORD
London, Dec. 13.—The Berlin Vos
Bische Zeitung, referring to Henry
iFord, in the num'ber just received
here, says:
"The ibest thing 'Americans can do
would be to stay quietly at home and
concentrate their energies on the far
nobler task of stopping Uic provision­
ing of the entente powers with war
material.
'"This would be a most effective
means of furthering the cause of
peace. Transatlantic pleasure trips
cart' be productive of notfting but thp
ridicule that kills."

House Leader Against Preparedness,

Representative Claude Kitchin.
London, Dec. 13.—An explanation
by the chancellor of the exchequer,
Reginald McKeniia, and a short de­
bate, the house of'commons passed at
the second reading the 'bill empower­
ing the government' to mobilize Amer­
ican and Canadian' securities by pur­
chase or by bororwing them to be
used primarily for collateral for loan
or in case of necessity to be used to
meet Great Britain's liabilities in the
United States.
The scheme is an entirely volun­
tary one and the chancellor made it
clear that the government had no in­
tention of swamping the American
market with securities v/hich would
be unfair to holders here as they
were to be paid for at the market
price.
Claude Kitchin, representing tin North Carolina district in congress,
is the new majority leader iYi the lower house. Representative Kitchin is
opposed to preparedness, but lias announced that he will not actively fight

San Francisco, Dec. 13.—Baron
George Wilhelm, von Brincken, an at­
tache of the German consulate here
C. C. Crowley, a detective employed
by the consulate, and Margaret Cor­
nell, said to be a secret agent in
Crowley's employ, were indicted here
late today by the grand jury on two
counts eftcii.
Tlie first count changes conspiracy
to interfere and destroy commcrce
•between several states of the Union
and the United States and foreign
countries the second count charges
use of the mails to incite assassina­
tion and murder.
iBail was fixed at .$3,000 on each
count of the three indictments. Coun­
sel for the defendants, all of whom
had been arrested previously, prom­
ised to appear tomorrow in court.
Brincken and Crowley were pre­
viously charged by Commissioner War­
ren with conspiracy to interfere with
and destroy commerce and they have
been at liberty on $10,000 bail while
Mrs. Cornell, arrested and detained
as a witness, gave $1,000 bail. The
overt acts stated in the indictment
were not made known tonight.
Crowley's operations, the govern­
ment charges, extended throughout
the United States.
The investigation resulting in to­
day's indictment, has just begun, ac­
cording to John W. Preston, district
attorney.
Federal aigents said today they had
already connected the alleged Pacific
coast conspiracy with 40 explosions.

er-in-law, Mrs. William Tague, ana
then committed suicide. He was
thought to be insane.
usual trade balance in favor of Great
Britain had been exhausted by the
new demands made upon America for
goods for England and her allies and
the amount paid in interest on foreign
securities held here or earned by Brit­
ish shipping were not sufficient to set
it right.
Consequently, in order to meet lia­
bilities in the United States, they
were obliged to go outside the ordi­
nary course of trade and to borrow or
sell securities.
He estimated that the securities
held here were valued anywhere from
?1,500,000,0000' to $2,000,000,000 and
expressed the hope that it would be
sufficient to meet our liabilities and
to make exchange in the United
States for the period of the war.
Say Suffrage Leaders Show Lack
of Patriotism in Tor
menting Congress.
Washington, Dec. 13.—The National
Association Opposed to Woman Suf­
frage in annual convention here today
re-olected the principals and adopted
resolutions declaring a lack of patri­
otism was shown in the work of the
suffragists to torment congress dur­
ing a session which is called upon to
solve the greatest national interests
that have confronted the nation in
years.
Delegates fron the 24 states repre­
sented in the association were pres­
ent. The business of the convention
was concluded today, but a delegation
of 40 women will call on President
Wilson at the White House tomor­
row.
Mrs. Arthur M. Dodge, president, in
her opening address, said there "was
need for state committees in Iowa,
South Dakota and West Virginia,
where the, legislatures had voted to
submit the question to the voters.
Adopt Resolution.
The resolution adopted by the as­
sociation reads in part as follows:
"This association depdecates and
contends a lack of patriotism was ex­
hibited by the suffragists in annoying
the president of the United States
and congress in makiug a sham fight,
which is a scandal and a reflection
upon the intelligence of American wo­
manhood.
Mrs. Robert Lansing, wife of the
secretary of state, read to the asso­
ciation a letter from her father, John
W. Foster, a former secretary of
state, in which Mr. Foster declared
that suffrage was probably a question
to be left to the determination of the
state rf-ther than congress.

Separately.
JUDGE GOSS WRITES
IMPORTANT DECISION
Takes Stand that'Section 179 of
Constitution Uovers Is­
sue Raised.
Under an opinion of the supreme
court, rendered yesterday, all indus­
trial sites along the railroads not
used in the operation of the railroad
are assessable as other real estate.
Judge iXuessle is reversed as regards
elevator sites and affirmed on his rul­
ing that sites used by oil companies
are subject to taxation.
Judge 'N. C. Young of Fargo, who
appeared for the railroacs, could not
state last evening whetlier the mat­
ter will be appealed to the Uniteu
States supreme court.
The railroads took the position that
the attempt to assess the industria.
sites constituted double taxation, as
all this property is assessed by the
state board of equalization.
Justice Goss, who writes the opin­
ion, takes the stand that all proper­
ty other than that used in the opera­
tion of the\ railroad is assessable as
other real estate1 under section 178
of the state constitution.
The syllabus of t'.ie case follows
FROM MORTON COUNTY.

iSyllabus: Under constitutional and
statutory provisions governing taxa­
tion of sites- of -^evirtdhsy --iuwrrei'
yards and oiltank stations upon rail
road right of way occupied under li
cense or lease from the railroad com­
pany, it is held
(1) Such sites are industrial sites
while so held and used and as such
arc devoted to private and not rail­
road-use' and are therefore taxable as
local real estate.
Taxable as Real Estate.
(2) While the tract occupied by
such sites are subject to the railroa
right of user and are taxable as a
part of and in the manner of taxing
of strictly railroad property, yet the
tax therefor assessed by the stat?
board of equalization on such has
cannot constitute a tax upon the tax
able private right of user enjoyed by
the industrial sites, and which sites
for such purposes can be assessed
and taxed only after local assess­
ment as real estate.
It is held, therefore, said industrial
"sites have escaped taxation during
the years in question and were tax
able locally during said time.
Constitutional Question.
H) The 1 IK) 1 constitutional amend­
ment to Sec. 17! of the constitution
for taxation purposes recognizes a
dual taxable right of user of right oi
way, viz (I) a right to tax samr
upon the assessment of the state
board of equalization as lor railroao'
use and (2) the right to locally tax
by general taxation any portion o!
.the site appropriated temporarily to
private use.
(5) 'Section 'M 18 C. h. 1913, taken
with said constitutional amendment
authorizes the assessment made upon
the private* right of user of these in
dustrial sites.
(6) This taxation of both rights oi
user does not constitute double taxa­
tion.
(7) The taxes assessed and levied
upon all these industrial sites are val­
id and constitute liens upon the tracts
in question.

Mr. Wilson told of his experiences
as secretary of the Seattle organiza­
tion and as manager of the Humbolt
county development bureau in Cali­
fornia. He dwelt on the necessity
of reaching out for the farmer of in­
teresting the boy, both in the city and
in the country. He predicted a bril­
liant future for Bismarck, providing
the city prepares itself to grasp the
opportunities as they present them­
selves. He urged the club to be not
so anxious to locate new industries as
:o overlook quality in seeking quan­
tity. He told of what other commun­
ities, smaller than Bismarck, have
gained by co-operation, and commend
3d friendly rivalry and mutual help as
opposed to the sectional jealousy
which so often exists.
The meeting was a success, al­
though the attendance was not as
large as might have been desired.
The lack of numbers was accounted
for by counter attractions, and by the
fact that the announcements had in­
dicated that the meeting was to be
confined solely to business. Enter­
tainment features were considered,
but it was thought that with so many
functions crowding into the holiday
season, such activity on the part of
the club would be inadvisable.
A PACIFIC FLEET

Washington, Dec. 13,—'Preliminary
skirmishes before the republican com­

place for the 191(5 republican national
convention to nominate the party's

here today. On the surface the only
contest of importance was that of the
cities seeking the convention.
After a day spent in strenuous ef­
fort on the part of the cities contest­
ing for,the convention, St. (Louis and
Chicago were looked upon tonight as
the moat prominent in the race. If
surface indications were to be trusted
the convention would go to St. .Louis,

MOTE THIS WEEK
Reports From Vienna Say Com
mander of Submarine that
Sank Ancona Is Missing.
Washington, Dec. 13.—Austria-Hun­
gary's reply to the American note on
the sinking of the Italian steamship
Ancona Is looked for by the state de­
partment officials by the end of the
week. This expectation was express­
ed today, when Baron (Erich Ziiedink,
in charge of the Austro-Hungarian
embassy, conferred with Secretary
Lansing regarding, theVJiote in an at­
tempt, it was understood, to gain in.
foramlly for his government an under­
standing of what would satisfy the
United States.
The charge, it was said, did not in
dicate what the action of Austria
Hungary might be, explaining that he
had not heard from the foreign dfflcc
upon the subject.
iBut attention has been attracted in
official and diplomatic circles by that
portion of the i.ote which referred to
the "acquiescence of Germany" in the
attitude of the United 'States towards
the use of submarines in attacking
vessels of commerce.
'Officials here were interested in
press dispatches from Vienna which
reported that the Austro-Hungarian
government had been unable to com­
municate with the co~imander of the
submarine which sunk the Ancona
and suggested that the uncersea ves
sel might be destroyed. iShould the
commander actually be missing, the
fact would play an important part in
the consideration by Austria-Hungary
of the reply to the American note.
Note Causes Anger.
"Reports from Vienna say that the
American note concerning the sink­
ing of the Italian liner, Ancona, has
caused Intense anger in the Austrian
govrnment and a diplomatic rupture
is considered probable.
"The question before Baron Buruan,
the Austro-Hungarian foreign minis­
ter. is whether a rupture with the
United States would not force Berlin
to a like step.
"Count Tisza, the Hungarian pre­
mier. has been summoned to Vienna
to discuss the situation with the gov­
ernment."

FORCES SAFE
Sustain Heavy Losses in Making
Retreat Across Southern
Serbia.
GERMANS MAY FOLLOW
INTO GREEK TERRITORY
Remains of Serbian Army Is Still
Resisting Austrians and
Bulgarians.
London, Dec. 13.—The British and
French troops have successfully car­
ried out their retirement from Ser­
bia across the Greek frontier and by
an arrangement with the Greek gov­
ernment, a clear road has been left
to them to fall back on Salonlkl,
which is being organized as a base.
The German official report of to­
day claims that "approximately two
English divisions were annihilated
during the retirement, but this is con­
sidered here as exaggerated. Ac­
counts from Athens and SaloniW
say tho retreat was carried out in an
orderly manner and without heavy
tosses. But the destruction of rail­
way bridges and roads and stubborn
rear guard actions, in one of which
two companies of the Inniskilin regi­
ment sacrificed themselves to save
their comrades, the Bulgarians were
kept at fairly safe distance.

The question now arrises whether
the Bulgarian and Austro-German* in­
tend to follow the British and French
troops into Greece and what'action
the Greek gQyernincn^will.^t^'-lf
they do so.
However, with the railways de­
stroyed, it will be some time 'before
Greece is called upon to take actioh,
and in that time,.the Anglp-Ffrench
troops could be safe in the defenses
of Saloniki under fire of their ships.

The Turkish attack against

night. British reinforcements' are 'be­

Turks Lose Gunboats.'
Details have been received of -the
destruction of two Turkish gQnboats
off Kefken in the Black Sea, about €0
miles east to the entrance to the Bos
phorus, by three Russian torpedo
boats, as announced in the Russian
official comment of last Saturday.
The torpedo boats were watching
the coal shipping region along the
Turkish coast when they cited the
two Turkish gunboats.
Towns and villages within a radius
of 50 miles of Hover were shaken by
the explosion and those in the immed­
iate vicinity sustained serious dam­
age.
During the light that followed .a
Turkish submarine arrived 6tt the
island, but was put to flight by
tthe
Russian fire.
The appalling effect of Saturday's
explosion in the Belgian munition fac­
tory are more clearly shown as the in­
vestigation of the disasters proceeds.
All the sheds of the plant, which cov­
ered 15,000 square feet of ground,
were completely destroyed. The pit
where the first explosion occurred is
marked by a chasm 130 feet deep.
