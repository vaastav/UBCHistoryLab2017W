CONGRESS BEGINS BUSINESS.
Short Session Will Continue Until
March 4, 1913.
Washington , Deo. 2.— Congress
met promptly at noon today for the
short session that will terminate with
the incoming of the democratic ad
ministration March 4. Crowded gal
ferles looked down on the animated
ecenes on the floor as Speaker Clark
in the house and Senator Bacon,
president of the senate, rapped the re*
e pecti ve bodies to order at the stroke
of 12.
Senators surged through the doors
at the last moment and it took some
time to secure order for the pr ayer by
the chaplain, the Rev. U. G. B. Pierce.
Failure of members of the house to
reach the floor delayed the opening of
the session of the house tu about a
minute after the hour of noon.
When Speaker (Clark climbed the
stairs to the rostrum he was greeted
by applause from the floor and crowd
ed galleries.
The roll call by states followed.
When the name of former speaker Can
non was called the members rose and
applauded and cheered the veter
an legislator, whose services at this
session will conclude 40 years in the
halls of congress.
"Uncle Joe" rose in his place and
bowed his acdnowledgment of the
greetings.
After the adoption of the customary
resolution to appoint members of a
joint committee to notify the presi
dent that congress had assembled,
Senator Lodge moved that the senate
meet tomorrow at 11 o'clock. It was
adopted without debate, the purpose
being to give time for the reading of
President Taft's message before the
hour set for the convening of the Arch
bald court of impeachment.
Senator Root gava the senate the
formal notification of the death of
Viee President Sherman. Resolu
tions were adopted conveying the
senate's sympathy to the family of the
late vice president.
Direct Payment of Pensions.
Washington , Dec. 1. — The new
system of paying all persons on the
federal pension rolls direct from
Washington instead of through the 18
pension agencies, is being put into
effect by the pension bureau. Checks
are being sent to 300,000 pensioners
covered by the agencies.
For the first timn in history the
pensioners will be paid without the
formality of vouchers, the checks serv
ing the same purpose by requiring
endorsement by the pensioneer in the
presence of two witnesses. The pen
sioner also must show to the endorsers
his certificates, the number of which
must tally with the certificate number
of the checks. The new system
obviates the necessity of receipts from
the pensioners.
Dynamite Suspects Discharged.
Indianapolis , Dec. 2.— Four of the
45 defendants in the "dynamite con
spiracy" trial were discharged today
by the government on the ground that
the charges against them had not been
sustained. The government said its
release of the above defendants did
not affect the merits of the remaining
cases.
Herbert S. Hockin, named by wit
nesses as the man who organized the
McNamara "dynamite crew" and later
became a spy in the ranks of the
union against OrtleE. McManigal and
others, resigned today as secretary
treasurer of the International Associa
tion of Bridge & Structural Iron
workers.
Big Crowd At Pie Counter.
Chicago , Dec. 2.— Democratic office
seekers crowded the corridors of the
city hall and county building before
daylight this morning as a preliminary
to assumption of office by the newly
elected officials. At 4 o'clock in the
morning the throng of job hunters
numbered several hundred and an
army of bailiffs was necessary to
maintain order. For the first time In
several years the democrats controled
practically all the city and county
offices and the rush for the places held
by republicans led democratic party
workers to appear at the buildings
long before daylight.
Decoys For Purse Snatchers.
Chicago , Deo. 1. — Half a dozen
slim, graceful, beardless and small
footed detectives were selected here
today to be dressed up in women's
clothes with muffs and tempting look
ing purses to decoy some of the army
of purse snatchers that have descended
on this city.
The innovation was the idea of Cap
tain Wm. Cudmore of the North Shore
district. He spent part of the after
noon picking out the men and giving
The River Press.
the orders for their street dresses.
The assignment Is not desired by the
policemen who are eligible for such
duty and the likely ones are trembling
In fear of having to don high heeled
shoes and corsets.
Senate Equally Divided.
Baltimore , Nov. 29.—Governor
Goldsborough announcad tonight the
appointment of William P. Jackson,
republican national committeeman for
Maryland, to succeed the late United
States Senator Isidor B. Rayner.
He will serve uctil the legislature
which meets in January, 1913, fills
what will then be an unexpirld term
of three years. The legislature at
that time also will elect a succeseor to
Senator John Walter Smith, demo
crat, whose term will expire in 1915.
Washington, Nov . 30.—The ap
pointment of William P. Jackson, a
republican, as the successor to the
late senator Rayner of Maryland, re
duces the öuppposed democratic ma
jority in the new senate to a point
very near the dividing line. Before
Senator Riyncr's death, the democra
tic leaders counted on having 49 votes
or more than a majority. Now they
count on only 48, with the democratic
vice president to cast the deciding
vote in case of a tie.
WILL BE SHORT SESSION.
Congress Will Have Little Time For
General Legislation.
Washington , Nov. 30.— How to
dispose of 91,000,000,000 worth of an
nual appropriation bills and transact
all other general legislation in 26 days
is the problem worrying Speaker
Clark and his associate managers of
the house of representatives. Repub
lican Leader Mann, just back from
Panama, dropped in today to greet
the speaker.
"We did not make any plans for the
session," said Mr. Manu later, with
mild cyniciEm. "The truth is the
democrats, now they have come into
power, are afraid to do anything im
portant at this short session for fear
it will put them on record for the
future."
Speaker Clark agreed that no plans
for the future had been considered,
but be took a different view of the
reasons why no general legislation of
importance is likely to be enacted at
the winter session.
"There are actually only about 26
free days of work on appropriation
bills and general measure?," said the
speaker. "There are 92 days in the
session. Take out 13 Sundays, 14 for
the Christmas holidays, 13 Mondays
which are donated alternately to Dis
trict of Columbia and pension legisla
tion, 13 Wednesdays which are given
by ironclad rule to bills on the regu
lar calendar and 13 Fridays devoted
alternately to claims and private bills
and there are left but 26 unencumbered
days for general work."
Dixon""Will Get Busy.
Washington, Nov. 30.— Senator
Dixon, during the short session of
congress, will attempt to get final
action on the several bills affecting
Montana which did not receive con
sideration at the last session Among
the measures he will press for con
sideration are the following:
Authorizing an additional federal
judge for Montana; providing for the
opening of the Crow Indian reserva
tion; authorizing the appointment of a
superintendent of Glacier National
park and granting authority over the
United JStates government; authoriz
ing a weather bureau station at Mis
soula to cost 818,000; increasing the
Billings public building to 9185,000;
appropriating 960,000 additional for
the Missoula public buildings, and
establishing the Jefferson park game
preserve.
Prohibits Rag Time Dances.
Sacramento , Cal., Nov. 30.—"Rag
time" dancing ended its lawful career
in Sacramento at midnight Thursday
night, when an ordinance, adopted 30
days ago to prohibit immoral danelng
in public became effective. The pro
prietors of the dance halls ordered the
ordinance strictly complied with.
After midnight the orchestras in the
dance balls played waltzes. The two
step was indulged in as well as other
"military" styles of the sort.
New Test For Immigrants.
^Washington , Nov. 29.—The pas
sage of laws prescribing a literary
test for prospective immigrants into
the United States by both house and
senate at the coming session of con
gress was predicted today by Repre
sentative Burnett of Alabama, chair
man of the house immigration com
mittee. Mr. Burnett declared that he
had been assured of enough votes in
the house to pass the measure and
that there was little opposition in the
senate.
ADVERTISING MONTANA.
Exhibits At Land Show Were Center
of Attraction.
Billings, Nov . 28 —An immense |
amount of good will accrue to Mon
tana from the publicity given at the
lands products exposition which closed
last week in Minneapolis, and the etaio
is Dow in a position to receive the
greatest increase in population In Ita
history, is the belief of J. L. Moore,
traveling Immigrant agent of the
Northern Pacific, who has just return
ed to this city.
Mr. Moore says, taken as a whole,
the products exhibited by Montana
far outclassed those from any of the
other states and that fully 80 per cent
of the 160,000 persons in attendance
were making more inquiry regarding
this state than any of the northwestern
group.
Mr. Moore said he gave away nearly
30,000 booklets descriptive of the
state's resources and that each of thos>
were placed in the hands of persous
who voluntarily inquired for them.
The exhibits shown at Minneapolis
will be sent to New York, where they
will be made part of a permaueut d s
play, and four new cars have been
fitted with products of the finest sort.
These cars will be taken through all
states of the central west and the re
sult will be widespread publicity for
Montana.
Pension Payments Increase.
Washington , Nov. 29.—Appropria
tions of nearly 8200,000,000 of pen
sions to veterans of American wars
will be necessary at the short session
of congress that opens Monday. The
unusual sum, exceeding all appropria
tions of former years, will be neces
sary to make up a deficit of nearly
820,000,000 resulting from the iocrease
of pensions under the Sherwood law
of last summer.
Estimates obtained by members of
congress today indicate that the regu
lar pension bill probably will carry
about 8175,000,000. This, in itself,
will be a record breaking total. The
pension bureau has enough money for
the present hut will run «hört hetweon
March 4 and July 1, when the new
fiscal year begins, unless it gets the
extra 820,000,000.
Adjusting Railway Mail Rates.
I
Washington , Nov. 29.— Readjust- :
ment of railway mail was the subject I
of a conference between Postmaster '
General Hitchcock and representatives j
of several of the larger railway sys
tems of the country. The railways
now are paid according to the weight
of mail carried, while Mr. Hitchcock
proposed to pay according to the
amount of car space actually used.
Figures compiled at the postoffice
department as to the actual cost of
carrying the mails indicate that under
the present system many roads are
receiving an exorbitant amount, while
some of the smaller lines are actually
losing money.
Under the weight system the govern
ment pays approximately 850,000,000 a
year to the railways for carrying
mail. Mr. Hitchcock contends that if
his plan is adopted it will result in
an annual saving of not less than
89,000,000.
Taft Will Name Commission.
Washington , Nov. 29.—President
Taft Is expected to determine upon the
membership of the industrial commis
sion before the Christmas holidays
are over.
This commission is regarded by Mr.
Taft as one of the most important
authorized by congress in recent years
and will examine the whole subject of
the relations of labor and capital.
Hundreds of names have been suggest
ed from which the president must
select nine men—three employers of
labor, three representatives of labor
and three other persons.
World's Heaviest Woman.
Montreal , Nov. 29.—Mrs. Justin
Masson, who weighed 770 pounds, and
is said to have been the largest woman
in the world, died here today. Sever
al months ago she became insane and
taken in charge by the Assistante

came notorious for exploits of strength
when in a frenzy. Even the walls of
her room failed to restrain her and It
was necessary to build a round house
outside the main building for her.
Conference of Progressives.
Washington, Nov . 29.—Senator
Dixon, chairman of the progressive
national committee, who has just re
turned from a visit to Oyster Bay,
said today that Colonel Roosevelt
would attend the national conference
of progressive leaders, to be held in
Chicago on December 10 and 11. Mr.

Governor Johnson would dttei.o. He
announced tiat thee woull be a
meeting of t'le execu ivd c moiittee of
the national committee December 9.
Senator Dixro declared he had receiv
ed many letters from progressives
and he felt assured of a large atten
dance of representative men from the
various states.
The conference he said, would be
devoted largely to devising ways and
means for carrying on the work of
organizing in the next four years.
Democrats Want Office
Washington, Nov. 29.— That an
effoet will be mi.de to suspend Presi
dent Taft's executive order of October
15, whereby about 36,0.10 fourth class
postmasters were placed under the
civil service, became known today,
when Represent m i ve Cordell Hull of
Tennessee said the democrats in con
press who are already in Washing
ton have conferred informally on the
subject, acd there was an overwhelm
ing sentiment in favor of having the
order revoked. Representative Hull

eating hur»e cuent recently, accord
ing to investigations of the city health
deparimeu'. A.-sistant Health Com
missioner Hoehler announced today

Would Postpone Inaugural Show.
Hamilton , Bermuda, Nov. 30.-Gov

his oilth of office as president of the
United States without ostentation on
March 4, and that the formal ceremo
nies that every four years attract
maoy visitors to Washington should
be postponed until the last Thursday
in April.
Many persons have urged the presi
dent-elect to sanction a postponement
of the inaugural ceremonies without
realizing that this cannot be done
without aa act of congress, and that it
is impossible now to change the
forth-coming ceremony, as far as the
taking of the oath is concerned. Mr.
Wilson's statement however indicates
his sympatny with later inauguration
movement and implies that he gladly
will assent to a delay of the show fea
tures of the event if an agreement to
this end can be reached.

libe rty bell petition, mounted on a
huge reel and containing the signatures
of nearly 500,000 school children of
California, started on its journey to
Philadelphia today after being

military bouors. When the Phila

ness to send the liberty bell to Sau
Francisco for the Panama-Pacific in

decided to make an appeal to them in
the form of a petition signed by Cali
fornia school children. The plan
proved a success and the signatures
pasted together make a string nearly
two miles Ion*:.
Taft Is Not a Candidate.
Washington, Nov. 28.— President
Taft has quietly informed friends that
no matter how active his participation
in a reorganization of the republican
party may he, he is not to be regarded
nor publicly referred to in political
speeches by republicans as a possible
candidate for the presidency in 1916.
The president intends to do all in
his power to help rejuvenate the party
and probably will make many pol tical
speeches before March 4, and after he
enters private life, but, according to
close friends, he Is in the fleht to con
tinue the party, and to try to return
it to power as the man who had been
Its standard bearer for four years and
not as a man seeking a renomination
four years hence.

gate from one of the territories enjoys.
The measure will provide a salary

prisonment.

Washington , Nov. 26.— The Dis
trict Commissioners will not permit
the use of "ticklers" during tbe inaug
uration of President elect Wilson. A

PROTECTING PIE COUNTER.
Democratic Senators Want Public
Offices For Democrats.
Washington, Nov . 26.—Senator
Myers of Montana, after talks had
with other democratic senators, Is of
tbe opinion that the senate will refuse
to confirm nominations sent to it by
President Taft during the short ses
sion, especially where nominations are
to fill terms which expire between De
cember 2 and March 4. Democratic
senators generally are disposed to
hold these appointments, allowing in
cumbents to serve until March 4, that
all such offices may be available for
democratic appointees when the new
administration opens.
In Montana several important post
offices become vacant during tbe short
sessiou of congress and Senator Myers
believe no new appointments should be
made to those offices, for if republi
cans are appointed this winter they
will serve practically ^throughout the
Wilson administration. The santor
rather takes the position that the
present postmasters should be allow
ed to serve until March| 4 and then
make way for democrats. In regard
to either presidential post masters
and federal officers in Montana
appointed prior to election for the
foui-year term, he says he favors al
lowing them to serve out their appoint
ed terms and then be replaced by
democrats. In other words, he would
not disturb officials now in office until
their terms expire.
Senator Dixon Will Retire.
Washington, Nov . 25.—Senator
Dixon today authorized denial of the
report that he intends taking charge
of the progressive^publlclty bureau of
this city during the coming four years.
The bureau will be established here,
but will be in charge of Oscar King
Davis, who assisted Mr. Dixon during
the recent campaign. Senator Dixon
says be intends returning to Montana
as soon as the short seesslon of con
gress ends, and that he has no regrets
upon his retirement from congress.
He believes the progressive and
democratic parties will be the leading
political organizations of tbe country
from this time on, and that the re
publican party, as now constituted,
has ended its usefulness.

lected 82,135,486 from the American
Sugar Refining company, 8695,304
from Arbuckie Bros, and 8604,304
