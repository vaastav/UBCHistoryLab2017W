The Message*
~ "TPho ponderous paper of the day is
the Messcgo of the President delivered
to Congress on Tuesday last. Tho
speeches of Qovornor Tlllman and Gov
ernor Evans and other like light litera
ture of the period, are evanescent,
feathery and gossamer in comparison.
These pass, as of tho day, as the ldlo
wind, and are regard od not. But tho
message deals with weighty matters.
The foreign relations of the govern
ment are complex and mixed, but are
satisfactory. The President exhausts
his powers of statement and argument
in disoussing tho llnanoial condition of
the country. As a statement, it is proba
bly the clearest that has boon given, or
can be, of the financial condition of the
country; as an argumont sustaining
the policy of his administration under
monstrous legislation and failure to
legislate, It is unansw 'able. He
recognizes, and presents with power,
our Indisputable flnanoial plight, but
blazes a way out if the country should
be wise enough to take his suggestion.
This will not be done. Tho Republi
cans being in power, will never adopt
the views of a Domoorat; the Demo
crats, if they were in power, would di
vide, because they prefer riot, on fu
sion and disordor. Southern demo
cratic leaders want a sound currency
probably, but they want office worse,
and they will contlnuo to bofuddle,
deceive and hold out false hopos to the
people. Abuse of Cleveland they
think oheanor^and more promising
toUJiuomfaajsM IfcSworing his argu
ijW be a contlnuod
ihe domoorats do
orifcy of tho
Senator Tlllman objects that greon
baoks should be issued by tho Govern
ment instead of bonds. This is equiv
alent to putting tho country on a silver
basis. It is truo the greenbacks
would not bear interest But the Gov
ernment issues the greonbaoks, the
bolder presents them for payment, and
there is nothing to pay with. If silver
is handy and Is tendered in redemp
tion, It is equivalent to saying?I pay
you in coin of a dollar denomination
worth In the world's market only fifty
cents. Six millions of our nine millions
bales of cotton aro sold to England and
our farmers now get gold or its equiv
alent. They will not accept money
worth fifty per cent, of Its faco value.
Every cotton producer will Insist on
sound money.

The latest iiqwo from Wfcirtdaaiftn
senator Irby has not ap
peared in his seat and was in the care
of a physician. Ben Tlllman had at
tended a silver caucus, where the com
pany were eight. He immediately at
tended a caucus of Democrats. That
Benjamin of ours gets around lively
and don't you forgot lt? So does Samps
Pope. For four years clorkof Tlllman's
State Senate at $1200 a year, then inde
pendent candidate for Governor, and
now trimming hia sails to lead the Re
? publicans in this State Benjamin no
doubt rogrets the training ho gave to
the wily Sampeon. Believo in every
man's honesty, but keep your hand on
your pocket book.
A negro man and an old colored wo
man, his mother, wore murdered by
four white men in Colleton county dur
ing last week. The man was charged
with a petty theft and the woman with
concealing it. If the details of the
butohery are as reported tho butohors
will soon swing according to law, if
there be decency, Christianity or civil
ization in that region. We trust that
the good name of the Stato will be vin
dicated?-Colleton being a part of South
Carolina.

instrument as a whole by a vote of 110

Tho Atlanta Journal hammers
Senator Tlllman and Gov. Evans for
their speechos at Atlanta. All right.
Giants can stand battering rams. When
you have 15,000 to hurrah for you and
1,500 molish at your back, you will pay
small attention to tho paper bullets of
a newspaper.

If the government stamps a piece
of silver as big as a ton cent pleco as a
dollar and it is redoemablo In a gold
dollar wortn one hundred cents thon a
dime may bo made to pass for a dollar.
But do you bollovo it and aro you will
ing to so accept It?
If the stamp of tho government can
add fifty cents to the value of a piece of
silver, thon free colnago is right and
the mints should run day and night and
their capacity bo many times multi
plied.

Factional lines gone as to the white
people In this Stato, surely the peoplo
will not fall out on tho question of the
ofllcos and who shall hold thorn. Mor
it alone?fltnoss?character and abil
ity should decide.
The President does not care partic
ularly about what kinds of money wo
have as currency but ho is concorned
that tho people handle such money as
may bo redeemed at sight in coin
equal in actual value to tho nominal
value of tho currency.
Congressmen Strait and Latimer
aro no longer to be black listed by the
Postmaster General and will be allowed
to control the appointments In their
DistriotJ?. Tlllman lo In Washington.
Clovoland had better look out.
Nobody with good horso sense ob
jects to silver as part of tho currency
of tho country. But every man of
horse sonso wants a dollar which is
worth as much as any othor dollar.
With the intrinsic valuo of an Amori
lean silver dollar at fifty cents the gold
dollar worth intrinsically ono hundred
cents is the only standard of value.
The Columbia Register significantly
suggests that Senator Tlllman will bo
judicious in tho use of his pitchfork at
Washington. But what was ho sent
there for?
Senators Tillman and Irby occupy
seats widely separated In the Senate
Chamber.
That
Tired Feeling
So common at this season, is a serious
condition, liable to lead to disastrous
results. It is a sure sign of declining
health tone, and that the blood is im
poverished and impure. The best and
most successful remedy is found in
HOOD'S
Sarsaparilla
Which makes rich, healthy blood, and
thus gives strength to the nerves, elas
ticity to the muscles, vigor to the brain
and health to tho "whole body. In
truth, Hood's Sarsaparilla
Makes the
Weak Strong

Head's Pills ?re purely vegetable, per?
fsotly harmless, always reliable and beneficial.
