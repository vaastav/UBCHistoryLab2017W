FKIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1905.
Prosldent's Mcssage.
As the message of President Roosevelt
to Congress is too lengthy to pcrniit of
ovcn a brief abstract being given by the
Register tliis wcck we will say tbat tbe
following are among the strong parts of
the messnge:
Declares navy nhould bo made better,
but not, at present. bigger.
Killa big stick criticisms by peacc talk.
Argues that there should be inter
nntionnl conferonee to eonsidt'r iuestion
of iimnigration.
l'resident says tliero ahould be tnore
dircct govorninental regulation of rail
roads, corporations and insurance.
Opposea governmental ownership and
says it ehould bo proven not needful for
honest administration.
The Burlington Ereo Press commenting
editorially npon the mes&age pays :
l'resident Itoosevelt's annnal mmsage
is churacteristic in every respect except
length. lint in spite of its length, it is
well worth reading, down to the lnst
word. Lt't no one be deterred ly tlie
nutnber of columns, howeverformidable.
The tole of chief interest, aside from
the rebate question, begins with a
recommcndation in favor of legislation
in regard totlie regulation of child lalwr,
and lor an invetitigutiun of the eonditioii
of women in iinltistry . As to the in
surance qucstioii, l'resident Uoosivelt
rehews hi H coiimiendiitioii in favor of
Federnl snpei vision. He urge.s the
nation to make the results of the llague
conference eirective, and restates his
position in reganl tothe Monioedoctrine.
The modllication of our laws relating to
the (Jhinesc is again tirged, and I'ree
trade between the l'liilippines and this
country is warnily advouated.
In nio-t or all of thet-e recommenda
tions l'resident lioosuvolt lias the
Aineriean people with hini. Tlieir clear
and conclusive restatiiient is a good
thing at this tinie. and the l'resident has
again deterved well of tlie Ameriuun
people.

NEW G. A. R. COMMANDER
Comrade Tracy One of the Younfl
est Civil War Vetcrans in the
Cou ntry,
James M. Tracy, the newly elected G.
A. R. Commander, hus been an enthu
siastic member of Russell Pobtsince 1880
holding several ofllces in the meanwhile
including that of Senior vice-Com-tnander.
Mr. Tracy is an Ohio boy and
his first enlistmcnt was in the 7Cth Ohio
Voluntecr Infantry, in which he was
enrolled on the day that he becamo 14
years of age, so that he is now one of
the youngest Grand Army men not only
in Vermont but in the entire Union. Ho
re-enlisted in the 142d Ohio volunteers
and Berved nntil tho close of the war,
taking part in soijie pretty hot ftghts,
among which were those at Cold Harbor
and Petersbuig. Mr. Tiney hns lived in
Cornwall most of tlie tinie since 1807 and
liis comrades of Post Rubs.eU believe he
has the (junlitics which will make hini a
popular and capable commander.
The White House.
The 'White llouse up to date has cost
about $!),000,000, of which nearly one
third has been paid for furniture and
Interior decorations, says tlie Saturday
Evening Post. Originally the State of
Virginia gave 130,000 to build it, Mary
land adding $72,000. To maintain the
White llouse costs from 25,000 to $50,
000 a year, the appropriation for this
purposo varying considerably. But
every now and then tliero is eomething
extra to bo paid for, and Congress is
called upon to give an extra 830,000 or
$50,000. The biggest pull of this kind
over made was for $550,000, which was
spent a eouplo of years ago in a partial
reconstruction of the interior and in the
addition of winglike terraces and an
oflice buihling. Kvery now and then a
new set of china has to be provided and
usually that costs 825,000 rather a big
Mim from the overyday housewife's
point of view. Repairs nin up to a large
amount annually, white paint being an
important item.
The l'resident gets bis pay every
montli in the slmpe of a eheck, or more
aeeurately speaking, a warrant for
150.08, which m sent by a mehsenger to
the White llouse. A niemoranduin of
the amout due is made by the auditor of
the State departnient and is sent to tbe
warrant division of the treasury where
it ls examined and marked as approved.
The seeretary af the treasury slgns it.
the coniptroller certilies it as eorreet,
and then Mr. Roosevelt receives liis
money. The smallest warrant over
issued by the treasury departnient was
in favor of the l'resident of tlie United
States. It was for one ccnt, and was
forwarded from Washington to Mr.
Cleveland to Gray Gables, the sum being
due to close tho account of salary for
the flseal year.
