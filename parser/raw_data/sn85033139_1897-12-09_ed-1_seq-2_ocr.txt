It h a little strange Low diametrically

Comptroller Eckei.3 never writes on

Mart Ann Angel, who sought to ob

Little River Falls is to be deprived
of her one iamb by cities having cattle
on a thousand hills. The little place
should not be thus despoiled. The board

springing up.
Kl 'ND'kk is now serving the same

“Prof.” Ferguson of Sheboogan can

The business of eloping with the coach
mac has aooarenlly felt the general de

But prosperity is reaching out so ns to
include the coachman as is proved by a

tocratic parents, eloped with a negro
coachman. They wore traced as far as
Butte, Mont.
The boom for the renomination of
Scofield has some of the features of the
b< 011 for McKinley's nomination. There
is no opposition to Scofield and that adds
intensity to the character of the support
be ie receiving, ft is such an easy thing
to be enthusiastic when there is practical
unanimity, but boisterous devotion on
such an occasion, being unnecessary, may
well be looked upon with suspicion.
Old Pat Walsh, for years janitor at
the State I’mversify, die! last week.
Many years ago when the University was
not as pretentious as it is now, Pat acted
as if be owned it. The students liked
him notwithstanding that he was a pretty
hard boss, as Pat interpreted bis position
as one giving authority over the young
people. They did honor to his memory,
thereby showing respect for him as well
as exhibiting their own manliness.
If old Diogenes were alive now he
might enjov the rare pleasure of seeing

received from the government to the com

to $495 86. He says the pension allowed
him was not well based. Such conduct
is inexplicable.
'lhe situation in Austria appears criti
cal. The Austria Hungarian empire has
always been a lov>se federation in the
matter of affinity. It is a conglomera
tion of people who have never unified and
never will. The Bohemian is a man of
strong national pride, though nor demon
strative in exhibiting i f . W hen roused
to activity i,e is rot easily quieted It is
probable th“ disintegration of the Aus
trian empire lias begun,
It is quite likely that the republican
lenders in Congress will act upon McKin
ley’s suggestion and move for a measure
to prohibit i!*e reissue of greenbacks, af
ter redemption, except for gold. This ie
an improved r‘, but, by uo means a cure
cf the evil. It je as m ich as the debauch
ed condition of public sentiment will
grant. Indeed it is probable ihat this
much will not be conceded. It is onlv
polling the evil, not striking at the root.
A case of more lha i parsing interest
to water companies was recently decided
at Ashland A person died from tvpboid
fever, the disease being caused, it was

supreme court. The decision of this
court will be awaited with interest. If it

Many recmolicaa pipers slid harp
upon the “defied" under Cleveland’s ad
ministration and even go to the extent of
announcing that a deficit no longer exists.
This is blind party devotion. The d-ficit
continues nod increases ss the menthy
statements plainly show. The Dmgley
law ie not proving as good a revenue meas
ure as the Wilson law was. A deficit ie
not a thing to lie alarmed over with such
resources as t* is country has. but we
should admit in t be interest of truth, that
it exists.
Fbank Wabneb has written a brother
of his m Madison, a letter about the neb
ness of the Klondike fields. He says they
are not overestimated. He returned to
Seattle this fall because of the scarcity of
provisions, bat mil retnrn in the sprint;.
There are other means of making money
besides digging for gold. Horses earn as
high as stso per day on the trail and sell
for &300 at Dawson. He intends to take
horses with him, work them on the trail
and (tell them when Dawson is reached.
He estimates that $100,000,000 will be
taken oat of the Klondike in the next
foar years.
Scabcity of money cannot be urged so
far as Manitowoc county is concerned.
The banks are in a congested condition
and many loaners are running after in
vestors. The Building & Loan Associa
tion has been compelled to call in some
of its shares. Of course the man who
will not earn has no surplus; nor can the
man who has no security to offer, borrow.
But no system of finance can relieve im
providence.
Fully $500,000 have been paid out for
farm produce in this city this fall. The
man who has nothing to sell received
none of this. That is his fault. Many
people who earn considerable money are
hard up, —the result of past bad invest
ments, If the individual suffers for lack
of money the fault is hie, Either indo
lence or unwise speculation is the source
of his trouble.
President McKinley’s message is
non committal. Interest centered on
what he might suggest on the financial
question and the Cuban policy. He
deals temperately with the latter ques
tion and very gingerly with the former.
The suggestions have a perfunctory tone
wholly lacking in the aggressiveness of
stocere belief. He says one good thing in
dealing with the financial queetion.
While we are in the midst of prosperity
we experience no embarrassment from
our present currency. But it is during a
period of pioepenly that defects should
be remedied. He treats the Cuban quee
tion so as to inspire confidence. The
jingoes receive but little comfort though
they appear to have been counting on it.
He clings to international bimetahsm
notwithstanding that the logic of late
events show how flimsy the hope of se
curing it is. The message contains the
usual reference to commonplace matters.
Thebe can be no question but that
the caucus system in cities is an evil. It
always will remain so as the man who is
engaged in making a living for himself
and family, instead of insisting that be
be supported by the government or by
distribution of property, will not spend
his lime in upsetting the schemes o? the
men who manage the ward primaries.
There is no use in talking of duty. No
reputable man engaged in legitimate
business, has the taste for organizing
necessary to carry a caucus. The politi
cian who has a scheme to put through
always secures the purchasable element
end it controls the caucus. The saloon
intiuence when active is the most forceful,
and it seldom ie inactive.
Ihe caucus system in the country ie
clean. Either the interest is general or
the indifference so. Asa rule there is no
dominating interest. The caucns there
partakes of the features of the election.
In the city if a caucus is to be packed,—
and as a rule it is—some unemployed
person,—unemployed for good reason—
is the person employed to do the work.
He becomes a promoter and an active one
and by no means among men of high
character.
Wisconsin became a state May 28,1 848
The plan of celebration of the semi-cen
tennial of the anniversary is to have si
multaneous celebrations in every county,
at the county seat on May 29, 1898 This
suggestion should be acted upon, not as
a matter of sentiment, —though that is
proper on this occasion,—but because of
the historic value of tlie event. Manito
woc county has always been lacking in
the spirit of historical research and pre
servalion of early recollections. There
are many incidents in the early history
of the county of exceeding interest. They
should be collated and preserved. Work
of this kind can be best prosecuted by
creating general interest and this can be
oest aroused by celebration of the state’s
natal day. With such an event in pros
pective interest in local history is stimu
lated and facts which have long slumber
ed are recalled.
ihe year 1898 will soon be here and
steps should at once be taken to fit
tingly celebrate the creation of the 17th
state of the union. Wisconsin’s history
as a part ct the great republic dates back
to the earliest records of exploration. It
was a pan of the thirteen colonies which
waged war for .ndependence. It consti
tuted a part of that Great Northwest
whose ordinance against slavery is now a
part of the constitution.
Manitowoc is one of the counties of the
state whose existence is coeval with that
of the state. It is peculiarly appropriate
that we should celebrate. Let the move
ment in that direction be hearty and gen
eral.
he Milwaukee Sentinel takes the
ground that the desire for normal schools
in Wisconsin has become abnormal. That
was the position of The Pilot years ago.
The mnltiphcation of normal schools is a
mistake. Not that they are not desirable
end do not do good work, but the im
provement of those we have, in enlarging
their course, their scope, and making
t hem more truly professional is what is
desired.
Mulliolvmg normal schools is an ob
struction to a form of educational work
in which the stale should engage, and
that ie the creation of training schools
in counties. Our attention has been giv
en 100 much to higher education to the
neglect of the common schools. The
country school must rely almost entirely
on the callow efforts of the untrained
teacher. Ihe influence of the normal
school is felt roost largely through the
necessity which compels the student to
teach after entering the normal school
anti l>efore graduation.
There is no department of educational
work more interesting and which re
sponds mor l readily to intelligent and
persevering effort than country school
work. There one is near the heart of the
people and the community readily as
sumes the character of the school. One
can trace the influence of a good school
in every home and in the enlarged
thought of every patron.
It is strange that the legislature has
developed no man who could fully appre
date the character of the country school,
its possibilities ami the splendid field it
o.it-rs for cultivation. Some few years
ago there were young intellectual giants
engaged in teaching in this county. All
are now leaders in other lines of profes
sional work. I uder their vigorous ad
ministration the county fairly tingled
tti’h intellectual life. It was a small
army of Paladins razing the fortresses of
ignorance. But graded schools claimed
them, from which they passed to more lu
crative employment.
That was an intellectual epoch in the
history of the county. Such talent is
not repeated in a generatiou. But some
thing certainly can be done by legisla
tion to give the teacher of the country
school an opportunity to fit himself for
his work. Why is it not attempted? The
state department is not much more than
a bureau of statistics end the legislature
is always busying itself with the needs of
tbe University.

The tendency in the grain market is

Every teacher of this county ought

ward bettering the conditions, espe

“stepping stone” spirit on the paft

The profession of teaching should be

We go into e'dasy over and boast ot

schools should be the stepping s-ones

TESTIMONIALS.
This is to certify that I have been
treated for rupture by the Fidelity
Rupture Cure and consider the cure
a complete succes. Leon Fortner,
State Hospital.
Evansville, Wis., March 30, 1807.
I am cured of double rupture, one
1 had from infancy (over 70 years)
the other the past fifteen years. 1
take pleasure in recommending the
Fidelity Rupture Cure as the most
successful treatment for this trouble
I have any knowledge of, Believing
it for the interest of anj’cne suffering
from hernia to be treated by a physi
cian using Fidelity Rupture cure. I
remain yours truly. J. M. Evans M, D.
I am profoundly grateful for the
benefit the Fidelity Cure has done
for me. I took treatment last Octo
ber and November, I think six treat
ments, and have not had any difficulty
or seeming return of the rupture
since, although I had been troubled
with if for over twenty years. I can
most heartily recommend the Fideii
ty Rupture Cure. Sincerely yours,
Rev. Win. Bonnet,
Pastor M. E. church Rosendale Wis.
I hereby certify that I have been
ruptured for the past four years but
have been cured in four treatments by
the Fidelity Rupture Cure without
loss of time or any inconvenience.
Chas. E. Barnes, hackman. Oshkosh.
Appleton. Wis., Feb. 2, 1897.
For the sake of the sufferer from
rupture let me add my testimonial, 1
was ruptured for the past twelve
years; have taken about thirty treat
ments in Milwaukee by a similar pro
cess without success (paid for in ad
vance.) I have had six treatments on
one side and two on the other by the
Fidelity method and am entirely cur
ed. I can now lift, eongb, sneeze and
work without a truss, and without
showing the least sign of rupture,
something I have been unable to do
for years as mv case was a bad one.
