The Anarchistic Sunday Schools
CHICAGO November 3Three hun
dred persons held a meeting at Aurora
Turner Hall this afternoon for the
purpose of effecting a permanent or
ganization to support socalled Anar
chist Sunday School The object was
accomplished seventy of the people
present signing the roll of membership
on the spot The feature of the meet
ing today was the general denial that
the schools were Anarchistic or
Socialistic The plea was made that
they were simply antireligious One
of the leading radicals voiced the senti
ment of the meeting when he said this
is an attempt to remove our children
from the demoralizing influences of
Christian religion and its baneful effect
on their mind making them too stupid 1
and lazy to think instead of developing
their intellect

Difference or Opinion
CHICAGO December 3This after
noon Judge Tuley of the Superior
Court issued a rule on Judge Prender
gast of the county court forbidding
him to proceed to appoint a receiver for
the Bankrupt firm of Lindauer Broth
ers Co clothiers Judge Prender
gast held that Judge Tuley had no
jurisdiction in the premises and pro
ceeded to appoint a receiver
Judge Puendergast named Michael
J Schweisthal cashier of the Interna
tional bank assignee The matter was
further complicated this afternoon by
the action of Judge Horton who on
petition of attorneys for the insolvents
and several New York creditors
appointed Bernard Kuppenheimer
receiver for the failed firm It
is said the petition of these creditors
was part of a plan to outwit Judge Pren
dergast and they certainly now have
the best of the matter as Receiver
Kuppenheimer took complete posses
sion of the property tonight before
Assignee Schweisthal put in an appear
ance According to Judge Tuleys rule
Judge Prendergast must explain his
action tomorrow

ANARCHISTIC WORK
A desperate and coldest blooded at
tempt to commit murder occurred
early this morning in the bakery of
James P Bruce About three years
ago he took a poor homeless German
named George Hacker in his employ
and taught him the trade Hacker
gradually developed into a full blown
Anarchist and when conversing on 1
the subject of Anarchy would grow ex
cited and abusive This morning when
Bruce entered the bakery to mix flour
for his bread Hacker sprang upon him
armed with a hatchet and a long knife
He struck Bruce on the head with his
hatchet then he crowded the dazed
victim against the wall and deliberately
PLUNGED THE DAGGERINTO
Bruces neck and face nine times The
victim cried out for his wife and the
brave woman rushed into the room and
clutched the bloodbespattered Anarch
ist about the neck dragging him away
from her husband just as he was lifting
the hatchet to brain the helpless man
Io i < ii j Jt ik
A terrible struggle betweed the frantic
wite and Anrachist thentook place
He was wild with murderous hate and
holding his bloody knife in his hand he
rushed about the room endeavoring to
get again at the dying Bruce He
finally got by the wife and reached
Bruce when the latter who is of giant
frame strugglinglto his feet made an
effort and grappling with the villain
struck Hacker a blow on the head
Hacker then fled Bruce is at the hos
pital with slim hopes of living through
the night

fight occurred between several high

about twenty Chinamen all armed with
pistols participated Over fifty shots
were exchanged and the row lasted
some ten minutes Four highbinders
were shot down and two others badly

The other three are wounded fatally
and cannot live Two other wounded
men were carried away during the fight
with their countrymen and cannot be

spectators were struck by random
shots The most intense excitement

In the Supremo Court
WASHINGTON December 3In the
Supreme Court today Hob F S
Richards of Salt Lake made a motion
for the advancement of the case of the
United States vs the Mormon Church
for the forfeiture and escheat of church
property to government on appeal
from the decree of the Supreme Court
of Utah After stating the claims of
government and of appellants the
following reasons were given for the
advancement of the case viz
that it is a cause in which the
United States is a party that
it involves the constitutionality
of certain acts of Congress that it ef
fects not only the people of Utah but
the rights of church corporations of
every denomination in the Territories
and is therefore a question of public
interest that a large amount of church
property has been seized and is now
held by a receiver much of it of a per
ishable nature and thus liable to ir
reparable loss and damage if left till the
case can came up in its order and the
delay with the great expenses entailed
will amount to the virtual con
fiscation of the property that
nearly half a million dollars of
personal property has been thus seized
when there is no law or aemblance of
law for the seizure personal property
that part of the real estate so seized
has been held by said church for over
thirtyfive years and before the act of
1862 was passed limiting the amount of
real estate to be held by church corpor
ations and that another part has been
held as a parsonage and is exempted in
the terms of the law For these and
other reasons the appellants ask an
early hearing of the case Counsel for
government offered no objection The
court took the matter under advisement

SENATE
WASHINGTON December 3It was
an unusually fell Senate that responded
to the President pro tern Ingalls call
at12 oclock today At that time all
the galleries were foil except the
Presidents and the diplomatic depart
ment As the minute hand overtook
the hour indicator on the dial of the
clock facing him Ingalla let fall the
gavel and Chaplain Butler opened the
proceedings with prayer
A few moments were spent in greet
ing Senators and then Senator Sher
man offered the usual resolution that
the Secretary notify the House that the
Senate is ready to proceed to business
The resolution was adopted and a com
mittee appointed to notify the Presi
dent that the Senate is ready to receive
any communication he may have to
make Messrs Morrell and Salisbury
composed this committee
On Mr Camerons resolution the Sen
ate at 1247 took a recess for half an
hour Later the recess was further ex
tended to 130 oclock
At the conclusion of the recess the
usual message from the House an
nouncing the fact of its being in session
and < = huving appointed a committee to
wait upon the President was delivered
it having been delayed in consequence
I of the recess That was followed by
the report of the committee to wait on
the President to the effect that it had
performed that duty and the President
would communicate in writing immedi
ately
Then the Presidents message was
delivered by Pruden one of his secre
taries and McCook secretary of the
Senate proceeded to read it
The reading of the message d
an hour and twenty minutes The por
tions of it which discuss the questions
of tariff revision treasury surplus fish
ery troubles and the west incident
were listened towithvery close atten <
tion and apparent interest by fourteen
Republican Senators and about an
equal number of Democrats Other
portions of the message seemed to have I
few if any listeners and the reading
had the effect of gradually clearing the
galleries of the numerous spectators
When the reading was finished the
message on motion of Hoar was laid
on the table and ordered printed Hoar
then said he was about to move an ad
journment but thought it would be
convenient for the Senate to learn from
the gentlemen having the various
measures in charge what would likely
be the order of business for tomorrow
Senator Ingalls said the unfinished
business was a bill to reduce taxation
the tariff
HoarAt what hour will that bill be
in order to morrow 1
Presiding Officer2 oclock
FryeI give notice I shall call up for
consideration with the consent of the
Senator the bill for settlement with the
Union Pacific Railway Company to
morrow morning immediately after
the routine business of the morning is
completed
By ChandlerThat we would ask for
action on his resolution to investigate
the Louisans election of April last and
by Allison that he would ask the Sen
ate to proceed with the tariff bill and
would even tif the discussion became
too protracted call it up during the
morning hours of the session
HOUSE
WASHINGTON December 3 Long be
fore the hour of meeting of the second
session of the Fiftieth Congress the pub
galleries were filled with spectators
On the floor handshaking was indulged
in and congratulations on reelection
or condolences on defeat exchanged
among the members Jocose raillery
on the part of Republicans patient
resignation on the part of Democrats
were everywhere evident
Republican members who are promi
nently mentionea in connection with
the speakership came in for an extra
share of felicitations it being generally
conceded on the floor that the next
House will be Republican with from
three to seven majority
When Randall entered the chamber
which ho did at a few moments before
noon he was surrounded by his friends
desirous of expressing their pleasure at
seeing him once more able to resume
his congressional duties
CALLED TO ORDEr
At precisely 12 oclock the fall of the
gavel stilled the tumult which existed
in the hall and silence reigned while
the chaplain offered a prayer
Roll was then called and the hum of
conversation broke out afresh During
the progress of the call of members
Cleveland entered the executive gallery
and becamejfhe attention of spectator
The call developed the presence of
twentythree members there being
eightyeight absentees
On motion of Mills of Texas a reso
lution was adopted directing the clerk
to inform the Senate a quorum of the
House had appeared and the House
was ready to prroeed to business
In accordance with the resolution the
Speaker appointed a committee to join
n similar committee appointed by the
Senate to wait on the President and in
form him that Congress was ready to
receive anything he might transmit
The House then at 1220 took a recess
for an hour
THE MESSAGE READ
After resess Holman announced that
M 31o1i1 Ji k
the committee appointed to wait upon
the President had performed the duty
and that the President would communi
cate to Congress forthwith
Pruden one of the Presidents recre
taries was then announced The an
nual message was delivered to the
House and immediately read by the
clerk
That portion of the message in which
I the President treats of the tariff ques
tion was listened to attentively by
members of both sides of the House
Now and then a smile more of triumph
than derision would appear upon the
face of some enthusiastic Republican
but the silence was not broken until
the clerk read in a clear voice The
cause for which the battle is waged
Is comprised within lines clearly and
distinctly defined It shonld never be
compromised it is the peoples cause
Then the Democrats could no longer
restrain their feeling and broke into a
round of applause which was an
swered by the Republicans with de
risive laughter
From this point the interest in the
message slackened Mills was the only
member who paid the slightest atten
tion to the further reading and the
noise of conversation became so great
that this was no easy task When at
145 the reading was completed Mills
offered a resolution which was agreed
to referring the message to the com
mittee of the whole and providing for
its printing

the sum of 40707 for the expenses of
the Irish Secretarya office
Elli Lberal moved reductions his
purpose being to raise a general debate
on Balfoara administration He
charged that the government was us
ing coercion to such an extent that
1500 persons had been imprisoned
ttit z41renrithes act went toopera
tion Balfour was seeking to conceai I
from the people of England the acts of
cruelty perpetrated in Ireland Bal
fours entire administration had been
characterized by party malignity and
calculated brutality
Balfour retorted sharply and con
cluded his remarks by saying if the
country ones understood the criminal
methods by which political objects were
averted in Ireland if the character of
the alliance binding the opposition were
revealed the verdict would not be with
Gladstone
THE EXPREMIER REPLIES
Gladstone who had come from
Hawarden in order to assist in the
attack upon the government twitted
Balfour and other Conservatives with
having sought a similar alliance on the
eve of the last election The exPremier
denied that the Liberals had sought
party advantage in the allisnce which
arose from a concurrence of opinion
with the Nationalists upon the great
lines of their policy toward Ireland
Oheers He proceeded to charge
Balfour with misrepresenting Earl
Spencers treatment of prisoners when
Spencer was Viceroy of Ireland and
reviewed other cases Coming to the
murders at Hichaelstown he assured
the Conservatives that
NOTHING BUT BEPENTENCE
would silence the reproach arising
from that mistake It would be heard
again and again until the government
would be oblidged to condemn what
had heretofore praised or until the
time when the solemn verdict of the
whole country was given t Oncers and
counter cheers The murders were
never even inquired into as they ought
to have been But what could be ex
pected of an administration which
claimed the character of honorable or
pure or just
Mr Balfour said Gladstone while
protesting against strong laneuage in
dulged in criticism the chief feature of
which was the strength of ethics He
Balfour admitted he had erred re
garding Earl Spencer but his mistake
arose from the defective information
supplied him Gladstone in his ac
count of the event at Michaelstown
omitted to refer to the mobs attack
upon the police thereby distorting the
truth about the affair The assailants
of government could not travel beyond
the narrow limits of a few charges
which had often been refuted
