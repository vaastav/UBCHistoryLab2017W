BAILEY CRIES "GROSS IXSUI/T"
Bailey objected to the resolution be
cause it did not direct the committee to
inquire into the "very trross and wan
ton" -words of the president's message.
"No action." he said, "should.be taken
on the resolution until that point is
covered. Either congress is th*> most
infamous body that ever assembled in
any country of the world or it will take
some notice of this most wanton and
gross insult ever given any body in the
world."
Aldrich insisted that the resolution
provided for just what Bailey advo
cate.
TiUman insisted that according to
tli« president's message congress is
composed of a lot of "rascals and
scoundrels who belong In the peniten
tiary."
i:\DIU\ATIb.V I.V SE.YATE
Hale replied that there had been a
great deal of "restlessness and indig
nation in the senate."
"Th<?r<? is no restlessness et the
White House." retorted Tillman. "They
ar* content and calm as can be there."
Culberson said the message "was a
deliberate, studied and gratuitous in
sult to the congress by the president"
Newlands declared that the question*
at issue was whether the secret service
had been used to investigate congress
man in the pursuance of the?r legisla
tive duties, or-was only to detect fraud
in the duties devolving upo;i the ex
ecutive departments. He was not at
tempting to apologize for the president,
but wanted to have the senate avoid
any hasty and improper language.
Agreement Not a Treaty
WASHINGTON-. Drc I «*— Secretary
Hoot, before the senate committee on
foreign relations today, pointed out
that the only obligation upon, either
party to the entente between -the'
United States and Japan relating to
the maintenafnee of China's integrity
is that they shall consult with each
other before undertaking any action
concerning Chinese affairs, and there
fore the agreement does not assume
the character of a treaty. If no ac
tion Is taken' by the r committee the
.whole matter will remain as nego
tiated by the secretary of state.

dent today sent to the senate the fol
lowing, nominations: .. -

Prohibits Liquor in Mails
WASHINGTON. Dec 16. — Except for
a few moments spent in the "transac
tion of routine business and" the pass
age of two bridge b.ills. the" house' to
day devoted its entire time in the fur
ther consideration of the bill to revise

The Garrett amendment, which came
over from last night and which pro
hibited of sending through the mails

. SrASHiXGTOJC. V* 0 - 16.— President
Rdosevelt today^ sent to , .congress : ; a
letter of ,therSec"retary of AVar. tran's
rofetlng a memorandum prepared by
Juktge Charlton of ' the bureau of insu
lar affairs, and Richard^ R. Rogf rs. the
general counsel of the isthmian canal
commission, bearing further upon .the
charges that Americaons were, inter
ested In the Panama canal property, at
the time of the purchase by the United
States. \u25a0 The memorandum states. that
at the time the property- was trans
ferred it included the' socalled "ar
chives" and they are now in posses
sion of this government. .
Examination, of these archives by
Charlton and Rogers show, however;
that neither, at the time, of the first
examination nor how. were there any
lists of stockholders in the old: or new
Panama canal company except those
contained in the formal" minutes.. Thu
minutes of th« . last meeting prior *to
the transfer of the property were not
contained in the .archives surrendered
and the la^v officers pay that the
United States government has no con
cern in them. It is believed to be im
possible, therefore.; to gathe^ from the
records the names of any Americans, if
any,- who profited by the sale of >the
property. - v
News Answers President
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind^. Dec. 16. — The
Indianapolis News, mentioned in the
special messages on the Panama canal
deal, sent to .congress yesterday by
President Roosevelt, today issued a're
ply to the chief executive. It says:
"It is difficult to characterize-fully
the latest outbreak of the president
without resorting to the use of lan
guage as undignified and. blameworthy
as that which puts the president's ut
terance In a class by itself in, the offi
cial literature of the high office he
holds. Whatever provocation • ". -Mr.
Roosevelt may have felt pricking his
soul nothing could justify or extenuate
the torrent of invective and virulence
whjch he poured out In a state paper
upon the head of private citizens. No
one in hie sober senses can fail to re
gard the performance as a grave dero
gation to the dignity of the presiden
tial station, a pitiable exhibition of
towering rage on the part of the chief
magistrate and the source of humilia
tion and chagrin to the entire country."
-Bryan Blames Roosevelt.
LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 16.—Comment
ing on the trouble between President
Roosevelt and Joseph Pulitzer of the
New York World. William J. Bryan
comes out strongly on the side of the
latter and .warns 'the president that he
can not muzzle the press. Under the
heading, "President Oversteps f> the
Limit." Bryan will say in his^Com
moner:
"President Roosevelt has sent t<vcon
gres3 a message which announces a
new and dangerous doctrine. It is the
duty of every publisher and every be
liever in free speech and a free press
to rerent the president's attempt to
use the government to terrorize those
who would criticise the action of pub
lic officials.
"It is a matter of little consequence
whether the charges made by the New
York World are true or false— that
be determined- by a suit at law in the
ordinary" way— but it is a matter/ of
great importance that every editor and
every other individual shall be free to
express his opinion on any subject con
nected \u25a0with public affairs."
Urge Change in House Rules
WASHINGTON.- Dec. 16 Another
step toward amending the rules of the
house was taken tonight, when the in
surgents held a mass meeting.^ The
report of ' the committee appointed at
the insurgents'' meeting last week was

Colonel Hepburn of lowa, chairman
of the committee, informed the gather
ing that- the committee had decided
that a change In the method "of select
ing committees, in the house was'de
sirable. \u25a0 ~ v^"/'
It had been agreed that the rules
should be changed so that one day. each

Ho explained .that the (Committee
