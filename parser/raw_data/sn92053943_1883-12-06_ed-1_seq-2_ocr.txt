PwKiflent Arthur's annual message bar. that
chnrni'terof plain and practical gowl set
wMi li all iifs utjito papers have lr.ime, ami,
wl'ilu wo do ii.jt approve of all liusriiinen
ili.ti.ms, and indeed disswat itroiiKly from
some of the uiwt important of tin -m, we eau
not too highly praiw the spirit of the docu
ment The Sun says: The document to congress
yesturduy aCUsruuou coutaius iuucu evidence
that tlio president thinks for himself. His
opinions and rdtommondntioiis on important
qii sdona of .iiolicy are often wholly itiiler
eut from thci which he transmits in the re
poiiri of his cabinet advisers.
The World says: Toe message cou tains a
foroihlu suggest icm for the treatment of polyg
amy. It is the repeal of the act on which the
preynt government of Utah depends, the as
sumption by the national legislature of tlieen
tire jxjlittoul control of , the territory, and
the establishment of, a commission to hold
authority over it. This favors strongly of
absolutism. Ob the whole, the invssngB is
an interesting document, containing some
evidence of independence, some suggestions
if whioh 'we ti jmrove an I much that wo
stronglyVondemti. It will repay perusal.
The Tribune says: Whatever the apol
ogists may 6ay now, five trade has become
the question of the campaign, and if tlio
Democracy is afraid to mwt it the election
goes by default. It is too late to change.
Chh'aho, T'ec. 5 The Tribune says: The
president's message will impn-s-s the render as
a conservative and cautions document. There
is an occasional intimation of a de.dre to
rosrioiiil to progressive public sentiment
in the matter of taxation and tlnvrugnja
tion of monopolies, but it is repressed
for the most part in appuivut deference to
the "biuiDess interests" of which tho country
hasntsardsoiime.il during the contest over
the'speakor'a chair. His recommendations,
as a rule, are in the right directiou, and it is
ruber the omissions than the assertions
which will encounter criticism.
The Herald says:. President Arthur has
apparently contented bims-elf with calling at
tention to the views of bis subordinates, and
generally approving them. Ill other
words, the message is like those of
Oram's, which his followers so pre
tended to admire it is "a business message."
While not a man-el in breadth of thought or
comprehensive statesmanship, is yet a simple,
plain and effective statement of the condition
of oiir national affairs. V- .
Cincinnati, Dec. C The Enquirer says
that the message is not a tlirillinj document,
but the kind of a communication which
ougth to be expected from a president who is
a candidate for re-eleotioii, aud who man
ures ills i-anipmgll its a poinii-imi imnei
than as a man of principles aud statesman
ship. The Commercial Gamttesays: The message
is an unpretending but dignified and able
state paper, which contains so much that,
after reading it, one is surprised to see that it
is so short.
Lot'isviLLE, Ky.J Pec. 6 The Courier
Journal says: There is nothing which tst.ities
more einpalhicallj" to the general tranquility
of the nation than the utterly uninteresting
character of the president1- message.- ft i
dull from end to end.
St. Louis, Dec. 6. The (! lobe-Democrat
says: The message strikes the average
reader as being a dreidodly careful one from
a political point of view, ami, barring some
omissions slid R lank of stress on one or two
points where ' more extended treatment was
expected, is statesmanlike and wia.
New Orleans, Dec. (1. The Tinies-T)efno-erat
says: In fine, whilo tho message con
tains nothing refy startling , or novel, it is
sensible and conservative, unsectional, and
unpartisan. We may not W nhle to accept
a" of Arthur's views, but a great majority
them will strongly recommend themselves to
ihe country.
What the KtBtcxnien Hay.
Washington City, Dec. 0 A numlier of
congressman have been interviewed in regard
to the president's message; subjoined are a
few of the opinions expressed: Senator
Mitchell "flf Pennsylvania, said:. President
Arthur is very practical and his message
busuffss-like and to the point. I did not, hear
any reference to the coinage of silver, how
ever, as I had expected.
Senator Logan, of Illinois: It is a very
good fnessagp. There nru some good points
iu it upon which tho president und myself
disagree, but as a whole it is a very accept
able document. ' ' -
Senator Hawley was asked what he thought
of it. He said: Well, from what I was able
to understand of It I should say it is a very
able document It covers a great many sub
jects and commends reflection.
Senator Keck said: It is very indifferent,
It means that the president will tlirow the
entire responsibility for legislation as to
revenues and tariff upon congress.
Senator AlUeonJamarkedT 1,-shoiiId say it
is a good message; not so pronounofd
some particulars as that of last year, ir-
haps.
The proposition to rehabilitate the navy
created more favorable comment than any
other portion, as even the senators from the
interior begin to feel that it is a foolhardy
policy to allow tho couutay to go aloug for
years in a perfectly defenseless condition.
Senator Aldrich, of Rhode Island: I fully
agree with every suggestion mailo by tlie
president '
Senator Jones, of Florida: It is an emi
nently practical document, and worthy ol
serious consideration by every thinking inan.
Seuator Groome, of Maryland: It is one
of the strongest business communications that
1 have ever'beard,
The Foreign Press.
London, Dec. 6. The Times thinks Presi
dent Arthur's message is somewhat colorless,
and sees a tribute to the Irish vote in the Inn
guage used in regard to pauper emigrants.

that the president did not recommend reduc

YOUNG NUTT'S TRIAL.
Difficulty in Obtaining a Jary
-The
'H Hceae im Court.
Unioxtoww, Pa., Deo. 6. At 9 o'clock a.
am., the Nutt trial began in the criminal
court before Judge Wilson, Judge-elect
Ingraham sitting on the bench with him,
through tbe courtesy of the court Senator
Voorhees arrived from Connellsville,
and came into court accom
panied by Marshal Swartzwalder 'and
Mnjor Brown, of Pittsburg, representing the
defense. Messrs. Patterson and Boyd, prose
cuting attorneys, remained seated at the
counsel table a few minutes, and then Sena
tor Voorhees was presented to the
court. On motion of Mr. Playford
Senator Voorhees and Major Brown were
then admitted to the bar. When both
sides reported that they were ready Jair.c
utt himself thenjstooif up anil said he was
not guilty of murder. Mrs. Nutt dressed in
deep mourning sat with her son, James, being
at her right hand and her brother, (Jamas
Wells) at her left, James 'jCutt, wasja cool
and calm as the judge. His face was pale.
His plea of not guilty was made in a low but
firm tone of voice.
A panel of jurors was called, nearly
all answering, and the work of selecting the
jury began. The prothonotary informed the
prisoner that he had a right to object per
emptorily to twenty-five jurors, and as
many as he chose for cause. William Stewart,
the first man called, was objected to because
he had to a certain extent already made up
his mind in te case. Then nineteen more
were called and were not acceptable. The
twenty-first man called was William A. Mc
Dowell, to whom no objection was made, and
he was therefore enrolled as a juror. "
The number of newspaper men present is
remarkable, nearly every (prominent paper
in the state and in the east having a special
correspondent here. Sire. Nutt is the only
woman present.andshenevcrximoveshereyias

Shortly before noon fifty names had been

took recess until 2 o'clock.
MORRISON FOR PRESIDENT.
A t'onplr of ('nrreopondentil Nee Hi
ltoom Cumins. '
Cincinnati, Dec. 0. -rbel-jiqairer'sWasbr
ington corresjiondeut telegraphs: There is go
ing to be troubio after ull among the Demo
cratie presidential candidates in the west
Up to the time the speakership canvass grew
warm, there was the general belief that Car
lisle's success meant an opening overture in.
favor of McDonald. He was pushed by rep
resentatives from free trade states supposed
to le for McDonald as a free trade
candidate. Since the caucus, however,
there is reason to believe that Morrison,
of Illinois, is to be pushed as the beneficiary
of whatever there may l in Carlisle's elec
tion. Already one hears that the Democratic
candidate must come from the west,
and the friends of Morrison are not
only active but ' demonstrative. Mor
rison himself gives open encouragement. It
is all-early beginning to dawn on the minds of
Mcl louuld's friends that theTe is to be an effort
made to squelch their candidate, and to
build up Morrison at bis expense. It is not
Known whether Mr. Carlisle is aware of the
;novemejit, but ho could not well be contrary
to it in view of the accive part Morrison took
iu his behalf.
It can further lie noted that Morrison is
discussed with more favor than McDonald by
the revenue reformers, The argument fc
used that his position ou tho tariff is more
explicit than that of McDonald; that he has
the advantage ef having a military record;
that Ids public life is open to no misconstruc
tion, and that if the candidate js to stand on
the platform of a tariff for revenue only and
come from the west, he is the man.
New VptiK, Dec. 4.-"Gath" says: Mr.
Morrison may himself become a presidential
quantity unless the tariff question should
produce such general alarm that the Demo
crats will fly to a quasi protectionist for their
candidate. The political field i-requires cool
judgment , ; " ; ' t ,

Cincinnati, Dee. 6. The Enquier's JTew
York correspondent seDds the following:
The speakership being Jecided iu ayor of Mr.
Carlisle, the tariff q'tlfsiloh coines out to the
front The south and the north west which
accomplished this victory Lava far different
reasons for hostility to the tariff system. In
the south this opposition may ho called a f or
ciji policy, that being the only method of war
left against the dominant an-l busy north.
Besides, free traile has a traditional value in
the south, coining from nulliucation times.
It belongs to that class of questions -in the
south called states' rights intimating th:it
the government at large must hot do any
thing, tree trade in this country was first
taught by Judge Coopur, an Englishman from
I'eunsyl vauia, in his leetures before the South
Carolina college. These lectures constitute,
jierhaps, the rarest book on the subject at the
present time.
Calhoun, toward the end of his life, as at
the beginning, was rather a renegade to. free
trade. By nature he was not a state's rights
man at all, lint a national man, and only

His early writings were strongly protective.
AVhen he got into the snarl with President
Jackson, who was of the same blood and
state as himself, he allowed the Whigs to ex
tricate him from the nullification ruse by
joining with them to pass a taritf. Yet theso
points are imperfectly known through tho
smith, and the -youflg people there consider
tliat to soine extent free trade and secession
are, twin traditions, j.1 - v . . t.
The uewspapec press iu the south, which is '

There are but two Republican newspapers
in tlie north of free trade tendency, The
Kvening Post, which lerie5 its advertising
pat ronage entirely from the Importing class,
aud Tlie Times, which is against the tarifr,
liecause the tariff assists to support The
Trihiuie. - Scattered through the press, how
ever, are many freo traders. That doctrine
has a generous flavor and attracts young
radicals and, idealists,-particularly those
who have traveled in Europe and do
not like, custom-houses and to see their
comforts taxed. Some portions of the taritf
are absurd, and if our people came as
closely in contact w ith it as those who re
turn from pprope, a bninidous vote would
lie polled agahlsl it. I should Tike to have

Canada is full of lumber, much of which can

lumber is in request all over the eountry.
I apprehend that dunag the liresent cou-

salt tariff also. Tlie salt question is a peculiar
one. Salt we can get f roni the West Indies,
where it is evaporated, or from Great Britain,
where it is found in immense quantities, and
often comes over for ballast. To satisfy the
fishers of Ntw Euglaud they get a rebate on
tlieir foreign salt. Hut in the west and in
terior genur&lly tha 'price of salt has been
regulated from Syracuse, a. Y., perhaps tho

gronu 1 that the southern men had again ia
vitel northern sectionalism by the election
of Carlisle as s,alcer. He says:
"Tins is that - 'entertainment to which
southern sectionalism invites the Democracy.
It would give Virginia back to Mahone, it
would make North Carolina, Louisiana, Ala
liama, Tennessee and West Virginia doubtful
and it would leave the Democrats without
the-bope of a single electoral vote in the
northern states. Such is the outlook, 'and
only the resolute reversal of the
sectional policy declared by the house
can give the Democrats the remotest
chance to contest the election
of a president next year. From this day
until the Democratic people shall unmistaka
bly repudiate the sectionalism of their party
leaders in congress no conservative Republi

Kx-tov. Hendricks' Views.
Indianapolis, D-a . Referring to the
cent editorial of Col. McCiur". of The Phila
delphia Times, Mr. Hendrie s wus asked to
give his views. He sant: -'Mr. Carlisle
should be judged by his odmiuistration, and
nut by lus location. The very logic of the
war is that citizens of Die sou iiiern states
must remain citizens ol thi United
States, and as such ::iav till anv office to
which they can be elected. Mr. Cm-iisle's
election may have been the result of a desire
ot many of his supporters to assert their rights
to tneir own opinions upon political matters,
and also the right of their people to thoir
share in the party councils, and, being the
majority, they have done only what the
friends of other candidates would have done
under the circnin-tanres. Mr. Carlisle must
lie judged by the results of his administration

Railway Report Denied.
New York, Iee. 6. Manajrer S. H. H.
Clark, of the Union l'acilic railroad, and
Manager li. R. Cable, of tlie Rock Island
road, deny that their roads have "tacitly
agreed" with the Milwaukee & St. Paul
railroad to withdraw from the Iowa pool.
They say that their visit to New York at this
time was purely one of general bnshiegg, and
that they did not come to meet Manager
Morrill, of the St. Paul road, or to sign any
agreement of to nature indicated. Their
being here at the same time is a simple
coincidence.

THEiPRAfERlOTE
Remarkable Story of Miss Jannie
. . Smith, Evangelis:.
Iter Marvellous" Cni-e After Sixteen
Yearn of Helnlesaness A
Iiatter Days.
' Chicaoo, Dec. 8. A . large audience at
Farwcll hall listened to the recital of the
story of the marvelous cure of M Jennie ;
Smith through the agency of pra'yer, after '
more than sixteen "years of suffering and
helplessn.s3. The story attracted much
attention, for iq this -skeptical age, when
anything that resemble a mimrlt Ms looked
upon with suspicion such a manifestation
goes fartoward strengthening the faithful in
their belief: If Miss Smith's story of bersuf
ferings be only partly true, she deserved a1
release from them years ogbl's' ''' " "
, When entering upon her teens, he says, ber'
father met with flnancM reverse:' She was
ambitious to assist toe family, nd so over
worked hsrseif that for six mouths, she wxs
confined to her bed. From that her physio 1
troubles grew. - Suffering first rora spinal
troubles, one of her limbs afterward became
affected, and for some years she endured the
most violent paroxysms of pain.At tunes she
lost the power of speech and sight, and for
awhile could only hear with one ear. Every
kind of medical treatment ' failed to effect a
eure. Hsring entirely lost the power to help
herself, Miss! Smith began her religious work.
Bbe was carried before her' audiences on a
couch. At Philadelphia, five years ago, the
last effort was made to obtain relief from medi
cal aid. All hope of cure was then abandoned,
and she gave herself up to suffering and
Christian work... While still confined to ber:
room at the hospital a time was s-.-t for some
ministers to call upou her. &be then deter
mined to test the will of God, and to ask the
prayers of her, friends for her recovery.
When the littie meeting opened she told. her
friends the time had come when she must know
the will of God. A time was spent in prayer
and scripture-reading. At 9 o'clock some of
the ministers were cbmpolloi to go, but she
felt that they liiost wait for God s 'mercy.
She asked all who were willing, to stay and
pray with her until morning. Eleven of
those present remained. At 11 o'clock she
first opened her mouth m pray , . and then
after a short - silence she recalled - the
words of Christ, "stretch forth thine arm."
When she thought of these words the gift of
prayer came, aud she faUV the ataiwigth come
into her body, , After first rising to a sitting
posture she stoo 1 oh her feet for the first time
in sixteen yeais. 1 Miss Smith nttm'tnitos her
euro wholly to prayer, and she has deternfine!
to consecrate herself to religions ana temper
a hoe work. -. -t i. . .;-:.! i ','

A Little Story with a Large Moral, One

Have you BEFSON.S CAPCJNE PLASTERS,"
asked a gantlemau of a certain dreggist whose
name could be given were it desired. "I am trou
bled jnst now with a tooch of my old friend, the
himWago, and the Benson's Plaster seems to go
the spot almost as soon as it tenches the skin."
'Not at present,".replied the druggist, genially,
but we have lots, of plasters just as good. There
is AUcock's. the CapHcnm and others won't one
of them do jtist as well?"
"My dear sir," retorted the gentleman, with a
slight show of temper. "I say nothing against
those articles, but I am a business man, and al
ways ask for precisely hat I want; and for noth
ing else. I may enlighten you, however, when I
say that sometime ago, for another disease,
which the C'apcine has since crtrcd me, I tried all
those yon mention, with no appreciable benefit.

they sre the same thing. Experience tasglit me

Be on your guard against imitations. The gen
