This morning Senators Johnson and
Lewis, together with members of the
Qouse now it Washington and several
members of both branches of the Vir?
ginia Legislature, Conservative? and
Radicals, called upon the President to
day to pay their respects snd to thank
him for the recommendation in his mes
sage concerning the commonwealth of
Virginia. The Senators made brief ad
dresses to this effect, and also express
ing the hope that the people ef Virginia
would in the future, as now, have his
support and approbation. The Presi
dent returned thanks for the compli
ment, and trusted that the conduct of
the State would justify him in bis rec
ommendation for her restoration to all
the rights conferred on all the members
of the Union. After tbe presentation of
the Virginia delegates, they requested
that Judge Alexander Rives be appoint
ed District Judge, under the new law,
for the Fourth District. The President
replied that Judge Rives was too old,
to whioh remark Senator Lewis said
that Judge Rives was sixty-three years
of age but was in good health bodily
and mentally, and in all respects quali*
fied for the office. The delegation then
withdrew.

London, December 7. ? The massage
of the President of the United States
was transmitted by tho AtlanAv tele
graph last night and is published this
mornir g. The Pall Mall Gazette in its
comments on President Grant's refer
euoe t s the Alabama claims says the
Americans are ready to accept an apol
ogy iu lieu of all damages, but England
cannut do more than she has already
done. Time will amend American sen
sitiveness. Such events as the demon
stration in honor of Mr. Peabody will
tend to mitigate irritation. The Gazette
concludes that the message on the
whole is friendly aud thinks the Presi

be entered into to prevent similar
troubles will be approved in England.
THE MESSAGE.
Opia|?aa ?f ike Prr?.
New York, December 7. ? The Herald
says Giant's message is that of au hon
est, clear headed, practical man. In
tie reconstruction business he simply
looks to the execution of the laws. His
plea for the funding of the debt and tHe
gradual return to specie payment will
meet the general approbation of the
country. It considers the message non
committal in Cuban affairs, and says it
is a good busioess message.
The Times says the message is one of
good news throughont.
The World says it is the weakest
message ever sout to CoDgress by an
American President. It considers that
the message settles the Cuban insur
rection against the Patriots, and on
liuancial affairs is too (Quixotic and
chiruurical for serious consideration.
T'ue Tribune regards the message as
one of the wisest and most judieious
nyer transmitted to Congress, and pre
dicts its hearty approval by the Ameri
can people.
