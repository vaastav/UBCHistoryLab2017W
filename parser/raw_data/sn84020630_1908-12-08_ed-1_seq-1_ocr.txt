Financial Standing of Nation
Declared ExcellentDe
mands Respect of Law.
Washington, Dec. 8. The message
President Roosevelt was read to
both the Senate and House today. In
substance the document was as fol
lows: . '. :
To the . Senate and House of Represen
tatives: The financial standing of the
nation at the present time Is excellent,
and the financial management of the na
tion's Interests by the government dur
ing the last seven years has shown the
most satisfactory results. But our cur
rency system is imperfect, and it Is ear
nestly to be hoped that the currency
commission will be able to propose a
thoroughly good system which will do
away with the existing defects.
During the period from July 1, 1901, to
September 30, 1908, there was an increase
in the amount of money in circulation of
$902,991,399. The Increase in the -per capita
during this period was $7.06. Within this
time there were several occasions when
it was necessary for the treasury de
partment to come to the relief of the
money market by purchases or redemp
tions of United States bonds; by increas
ing deposits in national banks; by stim
ulating additional issues of national bank
notes, and by facilitating importations
from abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur
rency system has made these proceedings
necessary, and they were effective until
the monetary disturbance in the fall of
1907 immensely increased the difficulty of
ordinary methods of relief. By the mid
dle of November the available working
balance In the treasury had been reduced
to approximately $5,000,000, t' Clearing
house associations throughout the coun
try had been obliged to resort to the
expedient of issuing clearing house cer
tificates, to be used as money. In this
emergency "it was determined to invite
subscriptions for $50,000,000 Panama canal
bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent,
certificates of indebtedness authorized by
the act of June 13, 1S9S. It was proposed
to'redeposit in the national banks the
proceeds of these issues, and to permit
their use as a basis for additional circu
lating rrotes , ;of national banks. The
moral effect of this procedure was so
great that it was necessary to issue only
$24,631,980 of the Panama bonds and $15,
436,500 of the-certificates of indebtedness.
During the period from July 1, 1901, to
September 30, 190S, the balance between
the net ordinary receipts and the net
ordinary expenses ' of the government
showed a surplus In the four years 1902,
1903, 1906, and 1907, and a deficit in the
years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional part
of the fiscal year 1909. The net result
was a surplus of $99.2S3,413.54. The finan
cial operations of the government during
this period, based upon these differences
between receipts and expenditures, ' re
sulted in a net reduction of the interest
bearing debt of the United States from
$987,141,040 to $897,253,990, notwithstanding
that there had been two sales of Panama
canal bonds amounting in the aggregate
to $."4,631,9S0, and an issue of three per
cent, certificates of indebtedness under
the act of June 13. 1S98, amounting to
$15,436,500. Refunding operations of the
treasury department under the act of
March 14, 1900, resulted in the conver
sion into two per cent, consols of 1930 of
$200,309,400 bonds .bearing higher rates of
interest. A decrease of $8,687,956 in the
annual interest charge resulted from
these operations.
In short, during the seven years and
three months there has been a net sur
plus of nearly one hundred millions of
receipts over expenditures, a reduction
of the interest-bearing debt by ninety
millions, in spite of the extraordinary ex
pense of the Panama canal, and a saving
of nearly nine millions on the annual
Interest charge.
Control of Corporations.
As regards the great corporations en
gaged in interstate business, and espe
cially the railroads, I can only repeat
what I have already again and again said
in my messages to the congress. I be
lieve that under the interstate 'clause of
the constitution the United States has
complete and paramount right to con
trol all agencies of interstate commerce,
and I believe that the national govern
ment alone can exercise this right with
wisdom and effectiveness so as both to
secure justice from, and to do justice to,
the great corporations which, are the
most important factors in modern busi
ness. ; I believe that it is worse than
folly to attempt to prohibit all com
binations as is done by the Sherman
anti-trust law, because such a law can
be enforced only imperfectly and ' un
equally, and its enforcement works al
most as much hardship as good, I
strongly advocate that instead of an un
wise effort to prohibit all combinations,
there shall be substituted a law which
hall expressly permit combinations
which are-in the Interest of the public,
but shall at the same time give to some
agency in the national government full
power of control and supervision over
tlleni, One of the chief features of this
' control .should be securing entire pub
licity in all matters which the public
has a right to know, and furthermore,
'the power, not by judicial but by execu
tive action, to prevent or put a stop to
every form of improper favoritism or
other wrongdoing.
' The- railways of the country should be
put completely under the interstate com
merce commission ' and removed from
the' domain of the anti-trust ' law. The
power of the commission should be made
thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise
' complete supervision , and control ; over
the issuo of securities as well as over
.. the raising and lowering of rates. As
regards rates, at least, this power should
be summary. , . i Rates must be made
as low as is compatible with giving prop
' er returns to all the employes of the rail
road, from the highest to . the lowest,
and proper returns to the-shareholders,
,but they must not, for instance, be re
duced in such fashion as to necessitate
a. cut la. the .wages ot the employes or
the "abolition of the proper and legitimate
profits of honest shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies en
gaged in Interstate business should be
put under the jurisdiction ot the inter
state commerce commission.
It is very earnestly to be wished that
our people, through their representatives,
should act In this mutter. It is - to
the interest of all of tis that
there should be a premium put upon m
dividual , .Initiative and Individual ca
pacity, and an ample reward for the
great directing; intelligences alone com
petent to manage the great business op
erations of to-day. It Is well to keep In
mind that exactly as the anarchist is the
worst enemy of liberty and the reaction
ary the worst enemy of order, so the
men who defend the rights of property
have most to fear from the wrongdoers
cf great wealth, and the men who are
championing popular rights have most
to fear from the demagogues who iruihe
name of popular rights would do wrong
to and oppress honest business men,
honest men of wealth; for the success of
either type of wrongdoer necessarily in
vites a violent reaction against the cause
the wrongdoer nominally upholds. . . .
Need of Centralization.
, The proposal to make the na
tional, government supreme over, and
therefore to give it complete control over,
the railroads and other Instruments of
interstate commerce Is merely "a propos
al to carry out to the letter one of the
prime purposes, if not the prime purpose,
for which the constitution was founded.
It does not represent centralization. It
represents merely the acknowledgment
of the patent fact that centralization has
already come In business. If this irre
sponsible outside business power is to be
controlled in the interest of the general
public it can only be controlled in one
way; by giving adequate power of con
trol to the one sovereignty capable of ex
ercising such power the national govern
ment. To abandon the effort for national
control means to abandon the effort for
all adequate control and yet to render like
ly continual bursts of action by state leg
islatures, which cannot achieve the pur
pose sought for, but which can do a
great deal of damage to the corporation
without conferring any real benefit on
the public.
There should be regulation by the na
tional government of the great Interstate
corporations, including a simple method
of account keeping, publicity, supervision
of the issue of securities, abolition of
rebates and of special privileges. There
should be short-time franchises for all
corporations engaged in public business;
including the corporations which get
power from water rights. There should
be national as well as state guardianship
of mines and forests. The labor legisla
tion hereinafter referred to should con
currently be enacted Into law.
To accomplish this, means a certain in
ciense in the use of not the creation of
power, by the central government. The
power already exists; it does not have
to be created; the only question is
whether it shall be used or left idle
and meanwhile the corporations over
which the power ought to be exercised
will nit remuin idle. The danger to Amer
ican democracy lies not in the least In the
concentration of administrative power in
responsible and .countable hands. It
lies in having the power Insufficiently
concentrated, so that no one can be held
responsible to the people for its use.
Concentrated power is pulpable, visible,
responsible, easily reached, quickly- held
to account. Democracy is in peril
wherever the administration of po
litical power is scattered ' among
a variety of men who work in
secret, whose very names are un
known to the common people. It is not
In peril from any man who derives au
thority from the people, who exercises
it in sight of the people, "and who Is
from time to time compelled to give an
account of its exercise to the people.
Legislation for Wageworker.
There are many matters affecting labor
and the status of the wageworker to
which I should like to draw your atten
tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the
problem in all its aspects is not now nec
essary. I believe in a steady ef
fort, or perhaps it would be more
accurate to say in steady efforts
in many different directions, to bring
about a condition of affairs under which
the men who work with hand or with
brain, the laborers, the superintendents,
the men who produce the market and the
men who find a market for the articles
produced, shall own a far greater share
than at present of the wealth they pro
duce, and be enabled to invest it in the
tools and instruments by which, all work
is carried on. As far as possible I hope
to see a frank recognition of the advan
tages conferred by machinery, organiza
tion and division of labor, accompanied
by an effort to bring about a larger share
In the ownership by wage-worker of rail
way, mill and factory. '
Postal Savings banks will -make it
easy for the poorest to keep their sav
ings in absolute safety. Thje regulation
of the national highways must be such
that they shall serve all people with
equal justice. Corporate finances must
be supervised so as to make it far safer
than at present for the man of small
means to invest his money In stocks.
There must be prohibition of child la
bor, .minutlon of women labor, short
ening of hours of all mechanical labor;
stock watering should be prohibited,
and stock gambling so far as is. possi
ble discouraged. ; There should be a
progressive inheritance tax on large
fortunes. Industrial education should
be encouraged. As far as possible we
should lighten the burden of taxation
on the small man. We should put a
premium upon thrift, hard work, and
business energy; but these qualities
cease to, be the main factors in accu
mulating a fortune long before that
fortune reaches a point where it would'
be seriously affected by any inheri
tance tax such as I propose. It is emi
nently right that the nation should fix
the terms upon which the great for
tunes are inherited. They rarely do
good and they often do harm to those
who inherit them in their entirety.
There should no longer be any palter
ing with the question of taking care of
the wageworkers who, under our pres
ent industrial system, become killed,
crippled, or worn out as part of the
regular incidents of ,.' a given busi
ness. . Aa. far as poncerns those
who have been worn out. I call your
"attention to the '; fact that definite
steps toward providing old-age pen
sions have been taken in many of our
private industries.. These may be In
definitely extended through voluntary
association and contributory schemes,
or through the agency of, savings
banks, as under the Massachusetts
plan. -;
Urgent Need of Reform.

benefit to only one class of people the

SV Louis, Dec. 8. Francis D.
Hirschberg, a prominent Roman Cath

bishop Glennon, also widely known
in club and business circles and as
a director of the Lousiana Purchase
Exposition, was shot and killed at his
home on Lindell Boulevard early to
day. Whether it was murder or sui

Members of the family aver that

body of the girl was brought to her! there is no evidence of an intruder. A
former home by the posse and buried, trail of blood indicates that Hirsch-
Martinez was a notorious bad man
and had served time in the territorial
penitentiary at Santa Fe, New Mexico,
and was pardoned recently.
Case of Mistaken Identity.
Inquiry today at the territorial pen
itentiary failed to reveal that any pris
oner by the name of Francisco Mar
tinez had ever been pardoned from the
local prison. There is a prisoner by
that name now serving a life sentence
for murder, having been sent up from
Rio Arriba county. The identification
of the murderer of the Garcia family
as an ex-New Mexico convict is, no
doubt, a mistake.

way and then walked back to his bed
room on the second floor. From there
he crossed the hallway and passed
through his wife's room to the bath
room. As he returned he staggered
into his wife's room and Mrs. Hirsch
berg awoke just as he sank to the
floor unconscious.
Mrs. Hirschberg had her husband
carried to his bedroom where he died
without making a statement as to how
he was shot. It is explained that deaf
ness prevented his wife hearing the
report of the revolver. Hirschberg
was 54 years of age.

morning in his private car to settle
the location of the new depot to be
erected here by that railroad. Air.
Kern J was accompanied by several
civil engineers.
When asked about the location of
the new depot, Mr. Kern replied:
"It is very much up in the air. We
desire to locate it as far up town as
possible."
Mr. Kern and the engineers are run
ning lines this afternoon establishing
boundaries and it is quite probable
that a site opposite the west side of
the capitol, between Montezuma ave
nue and Cerrillos .road will be select
ed. Mr. Kern seems to favor this
location and it is very likely that it
will be selected, .
This would give the Santa Fe the
best located depot in the city; it would
be removed from the freight section,
be handily located with the capitol
and nearer the business center of the
city.
This afternoon's examinations will
decide the matter and before Mr.
Kern leaves tomorrow noon the loca
tion will be settled upon.
It is necessary that the site be se
lected at this time so that work may
be commenced upon the foundation.
Material for the structure is already
on the way.

Ft. Bayard, N. iM Dec. 8. Bids will
be called for this month, by Captain
S. P. Vestal, the quartermaster at

New York World
Wants Alleged
Scandal Aired
CRITICIZES M PRESIDENT
Says His Controversy With
Editor of Indianapolis
News Was Uncalled For
New York, Dec. 8 The New York
World, to which Delvan Smith, editor
of the Indianapolis News, referred I
his reply to President Roosevelt:
tack on him, as authority for his arti
cle on the Panama canal,' which ap
peared in his paper and called forth a
a letter from the President, says to
day:
"In view of President Roosevelt's
deliberate misstatements of fact in his
scandalous personal attack on Delvan
Smith, editor of the Indianapolis News,
the World calls upon the Congress
of the United States to make a full
and impartial investigation of the en
tire Panama canal scandal. The in
vestigation of 1906 by th state com
mittee on inter-oceanic canals was
blocked by the refusal of William Nel
son Cromwell to answer pointed ques
tions of Senator Morgan. Since that
time nothing has been done to carry
on the great work of revealing the
truth of the Panama corruption.
"The Indianapolis News said in its
editorial, for which President Roose
velt assails Editor Smith, that it has
been charged .that the United States
bought from American citizens for
forty million dollars property that cost
those citizens only $12,000,000. There
is no doubt that the government paid
the forty millions, but who got the
money, asks the editorial. Mr. Roose
velt's reply to this most proper ques
tion is for the most part a string of
abusive and defamatory epithets, but
he also makes the statement that the
United States did not pay a cent to
American citizens, but that, the forty
million dollars was ; paid directly to
the French government, and that he
had no knowledge of a syndicate in the
United States. To the best of- the
World's knowledge and belief all these
statements are untrue and Mr. Roose
velt must have known they were un
true when he made them."
The World then gives long details
to prove the truth of its position.

JUDGE J. R. M'FIE
NAMES RECEIVER
W. B. Bunker, of Las Vegas, Placed in
Charge of Meadow City Electric
Railway.
W, B. Bunker of Las Vegaa was
yesterday appointed receiver of the
Las Vegas electric street railway by
Judge John R. McFie, in a suit by the
bondholders vs. the Las Vegas Light
and Power company, the corporation
having defaulted in the interest pay
ments on its bonds. Chief Justice W.
J. Mills of the Fourth Judicial Dis
trict, being a stockholder in the com
pany, was disqualified from sitting in
the case, and it was taken before Judge
John R. McFie, presiding judge of the
First Judicial district. It is believed
that the corporation is solvent and
that he receivership merely paves the
way for a reorganization. , 1
Another interesting case heard by
Judge John R, McFie in chambers yes
terday was that of Penrock vs. Black-,
rock, from San Juan county, involving ,
a number of interesting law points
brought up on demurrer by the defend
ant. The heirs of a deceased wife,
by her first husband, sue for an inter
est in lands, community property, val
ued at $21,000,- and there is involved
the question of the right of heirs of
the wife to inherit an interest in the
community property, the, " plaintiffs
maintaining that, the deceased wife
has an ; interest in community prop
erty, under the old Spanish or civil
law, which the heirs can inherit, while
the defendant holds that the husband
owns the community property abso
lutely, the wife having only aa expec
tancy during the continuance of the
community and that when she dies her;
heirs do not inherit.
