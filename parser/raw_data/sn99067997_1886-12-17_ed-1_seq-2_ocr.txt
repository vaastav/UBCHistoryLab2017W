INTRODUCTORY.
To tic Congress of the United States: ID the
discharge of a constitutional duty, and follow
ing a -well established precedent in the executive
office, I herewith transmit to the congress at its
reassembling certain information concerning
the state of the anion, together with suchrecom
endiitions for legislative consideration as ap
pear necessary and expedient.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
CLAIMS AGAINST CHILI.
thiv government has consistently maintained
its relatione of friendship toward all other pow
era and of neighborly intorest toward those
whose possessions ore contiguous to our own.
Few questions have arisen daring the past year
with other governments, and none of these are
beyond the roach ot settlement in friendly coun
sel. We are as yet without provision for the set
tlement of tite claims of citizens of the United
States against Chili for injuries during the late
war with Pet and Bolivia. The mixed commis
sions organized under the claims conventions
concluded bv the Chilian government with cer
tain European states have developed an amount
off notion which we trust can be avoided in the
convention which our representative at Santiago
is anthorieed to negotiate.
DHB CHINESE QUESTION.
The crnell treatmentof inoffensive Chinese has,
1 regret to say. been repeated in some of the
far western states and territories, and acts of vi
olence againstthose people boyond tho power of
the local constituted authorities to prevent and
difficult to punish, are reported even in distant
Alaska. Much of this violence win be traced to
racn prejudice and competition of labor, which
cannot,, however, justify the oppression of
strangers whose safety is guaranteed by our
treatj with China equally With the mo6t favored
nati, ne. In the opening of our vast domain to
alien elements, thet purpose of our law-givers
was to invite assimilation, and not to provide an
arena of endless antagonism. Tho paramount
lu (.[ maintaining public order and defending
the interests of oar own people may require the
adoption of measures of restriction, but they
should not tolerate the oppression of individu
als of special race. 1 am not without assut
•ince that the. government of China, whose
to r"ciii^i"eP wlu°mi»ufBrfnndpvfB^^K^Km,rP
country, may bo secured. Legislation is needed
to execute the provisions of our Chinese conven
tion of touching the opium traffic.
TJ1B ISTHMUS OR PANAMA.
While the good will of the Colombian govern
ment toward our country is manifest, the situa
tion of American interests in the Isthmus of
1
anrima has at times excited concern and invited
friendly action looking to the performance of tho
engagements of the^two nations concerning the
territory embraced in the inter-oceanic transit.
Until the subsidence of tho isthmus disturbances
ana the erection of the state of Panama into a
federal district nnderthe direct government of
the constitutional administration at Bogota, a
new order of things has been inaugurated which,
although as yet somewhat experimental, and
afioruing scope for arbitrary exercises of power
by the delegate of the national authority,
promises much improvement.
UAKTQOLDI STATL'E.
The sympathy between the people of tho
United States and France, born during onr col,
omal struggle for independence, and continuing
to-day, has receivod a fresh impulse in the suc
cessful completion aud dedication of the col
ossal statue of "Liberty enlightening the world"
in New lork harbor, the gift of Frenchmen to
Americans.
MARINE CABLES.
A convention between the United States and
certain other powers for the protection of sub
marine cables was signed at Paris on March U,
1851, and has been duly ratified and proclaimed
by this government. By agreement between the
higti contracting parties this convention is to go
into effect the 1st of January next, but the leg.
isl.ii ion required for its execution in the United
htates has not yet been adopted. 1 earnestly ree
ommeiid it6 enactment.
GERMANY,
Oases- have continued to occur in Germany
giving rise to much correspondence in relation
to the privilege of sojourn of our naturalized
citizens of German origin visiting tho land of
their birth, yet 1 am happy to state that our re
lations with that country have lout none of their
acostoined cordiality. Tho claims for interest
upon the amount of tonnage does illegally ex
acted from certain German steamship lines were
favorably reported in both houses of coDgress at
the last session, and I trust will receive final and
favorable action at anv earlv dav
THE CANADIAN FISHERIES.
The recommendation contained in my lasii an
nus! message in relation to a mode of settlement
of the fishery rights in the waters of British
Worth Anierica, so longa subject of anxious dif
ference between the United States and Great
Britain, was met Jty an adverse vote of the senate
April 13 last, and( thereupon negotiations were
Instituted to obtain an agreement with her Brit
tanic majesty government for the promulga
tion of such joint interpretation and definition of
the article of the convention of 1818, relating to
the territorial waters and inshore fisheries of the
British provinces, as should secure the Canadian
rights from encroachment by United States fish
ermen, and at the same time insure the enjoy
ment by the latter of the privileges guaranteed
to them by such convention. The questions in
volved are of long standing, of grave conse
quence, and from time to time for nearly three
quarters of a century^ have given rise to earnest
international discussions, not unaccompanied
by irritation. Temporary arrangements by reat
ies have served to allay the friction which, how
ever, has rorived as each treaty was terminated.
The last arrangement under the treaty of 1871
was abrogated after doe notice by tho
United States June 30, 1885, but I
wae enabled to obtain for oar fishermen
for the remainder oft hat season the enjoyment
of the privileges accorded by the terminating
treaty. The joint commission by whom the treaty
had been negotiated, although invested with
plenary power to maice permanent settlement,
were content with temporary arrangements,
after the termination of which the question was
relegated to the stipulations of the treaty of 1818,
as to tho first article of which no construction
satisfactory to both countries has ever been
agreed upon. Tho progress of civilization and
prowth of population in the British provinces to
which ttie fisheries in question are contiguous,
and tho expansion of commercial intercourse be
tween them and the United States, present to-day
a condition of affairs scarcely realizable at the
date of the negotiations of the treaty of 1818.
ew and vast interests have been brought into
existence, new modes of intercourse between the
respective countries have been invented and
multiplied, the methods of conducting the fish
eries have been wholly changed, and all this is
necessarily entitled to candid and careful con
sideration in the adjustment of the terms and
conditions of intercourse and commerce between
ihe United States and their neighbors along a
frontier of over 3.500 miles. This propinquity,
community of language and occupation
and similarity of political and social institu
tions indicate the practicability and the obvious
wisdom of maintaining mutually, beneficially
and friendly relations. Whilst I am unfeignedly
desirous that such relations should exist be
tween us and the inhabitants of Canada, yet the
action of their officials during the past season
toward our fishermen has been suoh as to seri
ously threaten their continuance. Although dis
appointed in my efforts to secure a eatisfactoiy
settlement of the fishery question, negotiations
are still pending with a reasonable hope that be
fore the elose of the present session of congress
an advancement- may nave been made and an ac
ceptable conclusion reached. At an early day
there nifty be laid before congress the corre
spondence of the department of state in relation
*4o thSs important subject, «o that the history of
the past fishing *oaaon may be folly disclosed
and the notion and theattitnde of the adminis
tration clearly comprehended, and a more ex
tended reference is not deemed necessary in this
communication.
The recommendation submitted last year that
provision he made fori a preliminary recon
naissance of the boundary line between Alaska
and British Colombia is renewed.
THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
I ezpresB my unhesitating conviction that the
intimacy of onr relatione with Hawaii should be
emphasized as a result, of the reciprocity treaty
of 1875. Those islands, on the highway of Ori
ental and Australian traffic, are virtually an out
post of American commerce, and a stepping
stone to the growing trads of the Pacific. The
Polynesian island groups Kave beeu so absorbed
by other and more powerful governments that
the Hawaiian islands are left almost alone iu the
enjoyment of their autonomy, which it is im
portant for us should be preserved. Our treaty
is now terminable on one year's notice, but
propositions to abrogate it would be, in my
Judgment, most ill-advised. The paramount in
fluence we have there acquir«d, once relinquished,
could only with difficulty be regained and a
valuable coign«? of vantage for ourselves might
be converted into a stronghold for our commer
cial competitors. 1 freshly recommend that the
existing treaty stipulations be extended for a
further term of seven years. A recently-signed
treaty to this end is now before the senate. The
importance of telegraphic communication be
tween those islands and thu United States
should not be overlooked.
.1A1AX.
The question of a general revision of the
treaties of Japan is again under disunion at
Tokio. As the first to open relations with that
empire, and as the nation in most direct com
mercial relation with Japan, the United States
have lost, no opportunity to testify their consist
ent friendship by supporting the jn&t claims of
Japan to autonomy and independence among
the nations. A treaty of extradition between the
United States and Japan, the first concluded by
that empire, has beeu lately proclaimed.
LIBRK1A.
The weakness of Liberia and the difficulty ot
maintaining effective sovereignty over itB outly
ing districts, have exposed that republic to en
croachments. It cannot be forgotten that tins
distant community is an offshoot of our own sys
tem, owing its origin to the associated benevo
lence of American oitizeus whose praisowoithy
efforts to create the nucleus of civilization in
the dark continent have commanded respect and
sympathy everywhere, especially in this country.
Although a formal protectorate over Liberia is
contrary to our traditional policy, the moral
right and duty of the United States to assist in
all proper ways in the maintenance of its integ
rity is obvious, and has been consistently an
nounced during nearly half a century. 1 recom
mend that in the reorganization of our navy, a
small vessel, no longer found adequate to our
needs, be presented to Liberia to be employed
by it in the protection of its coastwise revenues.
MEXICO.
The encouraging development of beneficial
and intimate relations between the United States
and Mexico, which bits been so marked within
the past few years, ie at once the occasion of
congratulation and of friendly solicitude. I
urgently renew my former representation of the
need of speedy legislation by congress to carry
into effect the reciprocity commercial conven
tion of January 2Ib83. Our commercial treaty
of 1S31 with Mexico was terminated according to
iu provisions in upon notification given by
Mexico in pursunuce of her announced policy of
recasting all her commercial treaties. Mexico
has since concluded with several foreign govern
ments new,treaties of commerce and navigation,
defining alien rights of trade, property and resi
dence. treatmont of shipping, consular privileges
and the like. Our yet unexecuted reciprocity
convention of 1883 covers none of these points,
the settlement of which is so necessary to good
relationship. 1 propose to initiate with
Mexico negotiations for a new and en
larged treaty of commerce and navigation.
In complience with a resolution of tho senate
communicated to that body on August 2 last, and
also to the nonse of representatives, the cor
respondence in the wise of A. K. (Jutting, an
American citizen then imprisoned in Mexico,
V''' wit1' ,h"commission
in
oH!^ I iect After,he demand had been made for his
-A whXh«i!iS? 1
of a penal"offense
»f which a Mexican citizen was the ob-
^^BSSS^i
within Mexican territory. This joinder of al
leged offenses, one within and the other exterior to
Mexico, induced the order of a special investiga
tion of the case. pending which Mr. Cutting was
released. The incident nas. however, disclosed a
claim of jurisdiction by Mexico novel in our his
tory, whereby any offense committed anv where
by a foreigner, penal in the place of its commis
sion, and of which a Mexican is the object, may,
if the offender be found in Mexico, be there
tried aud punished in conformity with the Mexi
can laws. Jurisdiction was sustained by the
courts of Guayquil in the (totting case
and approved by the oxecutive branch
of that government upon tho au
thority of a Mexican statute. Tho appellate
court, in releasing Mr. Cutting, decided that the
abandonment of the complaint by tho Mexican
citizens aggrieved by the alleged crime (a libel
ous publication), removed the basis of farther
prosecution, and also declared justice to have
been satisfied by the enforcement of a 6mall part
of the original sentenc e. The admission of such
a pretention would be attei#ed with serious re
sults invasive of the jurisdiction of the govern
ment and highly dangerous to our citizens in
foreigu lands. Therefore have denied it, and
protested against its attempted exercise as un
warranted by the principles of law and interna
tional utases. A sovereign has jurisdiction of
offenses which take effect within his territory,
although concocted or commenced outside of it,
but the right is denied of any foreign sovereign
to punish a citizen of the United States for an
offense consummated on our soil in violation of
our laws, even though the offense be against a
subject or citizen of such sovereign. The Mexi
can statute in question makes the claim broadly,
and the principle, if conceded, would
rente a dual responsibility in the
citizen and lead to a confusion destruciive of
that certainty
111
tho law which i6 an essential of
liberty. When citizens of the Dnited States
voluntarily BO into a foreign country they must
abide by the laws there in force, and will not be
protected by their own government from the
consequences of an offense against those laws
committed in such foreign country bat the
watchful care and interest of this government
over its citizens are not relinquished because
they have gone abroad, and if charged with a
crime committed in the foreign land a fair and
open trial, conducted with a decent regard for
justice and humanity, willibe demanded for them.
With less than that this government will not be
content when life or liberty of its citizens is at
stake. Whatever the degreo to which extra terri
torial criminal jurisdiction may have been
formerly allowed by consent and reciprocal
agreement among certain of the European states,
no such doctrine or practice was ever known to
the laws
of this country, or of that from which onr
institutions have mainly been derived. In the case
of Mexico there are reasons espeoially strong
for perfect harmony in the mntual exercise of
jurisdiction. Nature has made us irrevocably
neighbors and wisdom and kind feeling should
make us friends. The overflow of capital and
enterprise from the United States is a potent
factor in assisting the development of tho re
sources of Mexico and building up the pros
perity of both countries. To assist this good
work all grounds of apprehension for the security
of person and property should be removed, and
1 trust that in tho interests of good neighbor
hood the statute referred to will be so modified
as to eliminate the present possibilities of danger
to the peace of the two countries.
NETHERLANDS AND PERSIA.
The government of the Netherlands has ex
hibited concern in relation to certain features of
our tariff laws, which are supposed by them to
be aimed at a class of tobacco produced in the
East Indies. Comment would seem unnecessary
upon the unwisdom of legislation appearing to
have a special national discrimination for
its object which, although unintentional
may give rise to injurious relations.
'1 ho establishment, less than fouryears ago, of
a legation at Teheran is bearing fruit in the in
terest exhibited by the shah1s government in the
industrial activity of the United States and the
opportunities of beneficial interchanges.
PEITU.
Stable government is now happily restored in
Peru by tliuei etion of a constitutional president
ana a period.of rehabitation is entered upon, but
recovery is necessarily slow from the exhaustion
caused by the late war and civil disturbances. A
convention to adjust by arbitration tho claims of
our citizens has been promised and is under con
sideration.
KU881A.
I
The naval officer who bore to Siberia the testi
monials bestowed by congress in recognition of
the aid given the Jeannette survivors haB accom-
ge
lished hie mission. His interesting report will
submitted. It is pleasant to know that this
mark of appreciation has been welcomed by the
Russian government and people as befits the
traditional friendship of the two countries.
THE 8AMOAN ISLANDS.
Civil perturbations in the Samoan isles have,
during the past few years, been a source of con
siderable embarrassment to the three govern
ernments of Germany. Great Britain and the
United States, whoBe relations and extra territo
rial rights in that important group are guaran
teed by treaties. The weakness of the native ad
ministration and conflict of opposition
interests in those islands have led King
Maliteoa to seek an alliance or
protection in some one quarter, regardless of
distinct engagements whereby no one of three
treaty powers may acquire any paramount or ex
clusive interest. In May last Maliteoa offered to
place Samoa under the protection of the United
Btatoa, and the late consul, without authority,
assumed to grant it. The proceeding was
promptly disavowed and the overzealous official
recalled. Special agents of the three govern
ments have been deputed to examine the situa
tion in the islnnds, with a change in the repre.
sentation of all three powers and a harmomoos
understanding botween them by which the peace,
prosperity, autonomous administration and neu
trality of Samoa can hardly fail to be secured.
SPAIN.
It appearing that tho government of Spain did
not extend to the flag of the United States in the
Antilles the whole measure of reciprocity requi
site under tho statute for tho continuance of this
suspension of discriminations against the
Spanish flag in our ports, 1 was con
strained in October last to rescind my
predecessor's proclamation of Febru
ary 14. 1884, permitting such suspension.
An arrangement was, however, speedily reached,
and upon notification from the government of
Spain that all differential treatmont of onr ves
sels and their cargoes from tho United States, or
from any foreign country, had been completely
and absolutely relinquished, I availed myself of
the discretion conferred by the law and issued
on the 27tii of October my proclamation declar
ing reciprocal suspension in the United States.
It is most gratifying to bear testimony to the
earnest spirit in which the government of the
queen regent has met our efforts to avert the ini
tiation of commercial discrimination, which are
ever disastrous to the material interests of the
political good will of the countries they effect.
1
he profitable development of the large com
mercial exchanges between the United States
and the,Spanish Antilles is naturally an object
of solicitude. Lying close at our doors, and find
ing here their main markets of supply and de
mand, tho welfare of (John and Porto Kico and
their production and trade aro scarcely less im
portant to us than to Spain. Their commercial
and financial methods are so naturally a part of
our system that no obstacle to full»r. freer
intercourse should be permitted to
exist. The standing instructions of
our representatives at Madrid and
Havana have for years been to leave no effort un
essayed to further these ends, and at no time has
the equal pood desire of Spain been more hope
fully manifested than now. Tin government of
Spain, thus removing tho consular tonnage fees
on cargoes shipped to the Antilles, and by reduc
ing passport fees. ha6 shown its recognition of
the needs of lees trammeled intercourse.,
TURKEY.
An effort has boen made during tho past year
to remove the hindrances to the proclamation of
the treaty of naturalization with tho sublime
porte, signed in 1874, which has remained in
operative owing to a disagreement of interpreta
tion of the clauses relative to the effects of the
return to and sojourn of a naturalized citizen in
the land of origin I trust soon to be able to
announce a favorable settlement of the differ
ences as to the interpretation. It lias been
highly satisfactory to note the improved treat
ment of American missionaries in Turkey, as
has been attested by their acknowledgements to
our late minister to that government and of his
successful exertions in their behalf.
VBNEZOELA.
The exchange of ratification of tho convention
of December S, 1885, with Venezuela, for the re
opening of the award-of the Caracas commis
sion under the claims convention of 18tlli, has not
been effected owing to the delay of tho executive
of that republic in ratifying the monsores. 1
trust, that this postponement will be briof,
but shonld it much longer continue the delay
may wel 1 be regarded as a rescission of the com
pact and a failure on the part of Venezuela to
complete an arrangement BO persistently sought
by her during many years, and assented to |by
this government in a spirit of international fair
ness, although to the detriment of holders of
bona fide awards of the imnugned commission.
NATURALIZATION ANXI EXTRADITION.
I renew the recommendation of my last anneal
meessage. that existing legislation concerning
citizenship and naturalization be revised. We
have treaties with many states providing for tho
renunciation of citizenship by naturalized aliens,
but no statute is found to give effect to such en
gagements, nor any which provides a needed
central bureau for tho registration of naturalized
citizens. Experience suggests that our statutes
regulating extradition may be amended by a pro
vision for the transit across onr territory now a
convenient thoroughfare of travel from one for
eign country to another .of fugitives surren
dered by a foreign government to a
third state. Such provisions are nsnal
in the legislation of other couutries and tend to
prevent the miscarrying of justice. It is alto
desirable in order to remove the present uncer
tainties that all authority should be conferred on
the secretary of state to issne a certificate in cass
of an arrest for the purpose of extradition to the
omcer before whom the proceeding is pending,
showing that a requisition for tho surrender of
the person charged has beeu duly made. Such a
certificate, if required to be received before the
prisoner's examination, would prevent a long
and expensive judicial inquiry into a charge
which the foreign government might, not desire
to press. I also recommend that express provis
ions be made for the immediate discharge from
custody of persons committed for extradition
where the president is of opinion that tho sur
render should not be made.
1NTERNATIONAI, COPYRIGHT.
The drift of sentiment in civilized communi
ties toward full recognition of tho rights of
property in the creations of tho human intellect
has brought about the adoption by many impor
tant nations of an international copyright con
vention, which was sighed at Kerne on the 18th
of September, 1885. Inasmuch as the constitu
tion goes to congress the power to promote the
progress of scienco and useful art» by securing
for limited times to authors and inventors the
exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries, this government did tot feel war
ranted in becoming a signatory pending the ac
tion of congress upon measures of international
copyright now before it. but the right of ad
hesion to the lierne convention hereafter has
been resorved. 1 trust the subject will receive
at your hands the attention it deserves, and that
the just claims of authors so urgeatly pressed
will be duly heeded.
Representations continue to be made to me of
the injurious effect upon American artists study
ing abroad and having free access tc the art col
lections of foreign conntries of the maintenance
ofadiscriminating duty against the introduction
of the works of their brother artists of other
countries, 1 am induced to repeat my recom
mendation for the abolition of that tex.
THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
NECESSITY FOR IMPROVEMENT.
Pursuant to a provision of the diplomatic and
consular appropriation act, approvsd July 1,
1SS6, the estimates submitted by the secretary of
stale for the maintenance of the consular service
have been recast on the basis of salaries for all
officers to whom such allowance is deemed ad
visable. Advantage has been taken of this to re
distribute the salaries of officers now appropri
ated for in accordance with the work performed,
the importance of the representatm ditties of
the incumbent and the cost of living at each
post. The last consideration has been too often
lost sight of in the allowances heretofore made.
The compensation which may suffice for the de
cent maintenance of a worthy and capable offi
cer in a position of onerous and representative
trust, at a post readily accessible, and where the
necessaries of life are abundant and chaap, may
prove an inadequate pittance in distant lands,
where the better part of a year's pay is
consumed in reaohing the post of duty,
and where the comforts of ordinary
civilized exi6tence.can only be obtained with
difficulty and at exorbitant cost. I trust that in
considering the submitted schedules no mis
taken theory of economy will perpetuate a sys
tem which in past has virtually closed to deserv
ing talent any offices where capacity and attain
ments of a high order are indispensable, and in
not a few cases has brought discredit on our na
tional character, ami entailed embarrassment
and even suffering on those depnted to uphold
our dignity and interests abroad. In connection
with the subject I earnestly reiterate the practi
cal necessity of suppling some mode of trust
worthy -nstruction and report of the manner in
which the consulates are conducted. In the
absence of such reliable information efficiency
can scarcely be rewarded or its opposite cor
rected. Inoreasing competition in trade has di
rected attention to the value of the consular re
ports printed by the department of state, and
the efforts of the government to extend the
practical usefulness of these reports have created
a wider demand for thorn at home and a spirit of
emulation abroad. Constituting a record of the
changes occurring in trade aod of the progress
of the arts and inventions in foreign countries,
they are mnch sought for by all interested in the
subjects they embrace.
THE FINANCES.
GENERAL CONDITION.
The report of the aoratary of the treasury ex
hibits in detail the condition of the public
finance and of the several branches of the gov
ernment related to hia department. I especially
direct the attention of the congress to the recom
mendations contained in this
and the last preced
ing report of the secretary touching the simpli
fication and amendment of the laws relating to
the collection of onr revenues, and in the inter
est of economy and justice to the government
I hope they may be adopted by appropriate legis
lation. The ordinary receipts of the government
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, were $338,
439,727.06. Of this amount $192,905,022.41
reoeived from customs, and $119,805,9M.48 from
internal revenue, while the total receipts as here

of $11,431,084.10 and from
nne of $4,407,210.94, making a gain
iu these items for the last year of
$15,811,295.01 a falling off in other revenues re
duced the total increase to the smaller amount
mentioned. The exponses at different custom
houses of collecting this increased customs reve
nue was less than the expenso attending the
collection of such revenue for tho preceding
year hy .190,008, and tho increased receipts of in
ternal revenue wore collected at a cost to tho
internal revenue bureau of $155,914.99 less than
the expense of such collection for the previous
year. The total ordinary expenses of tho gov
ernment for the fiscal year ended June 30, lHStS,
were S2IJ.4S3.138 5P, being less by $17,788.797 than
such expenditures for the year preceding, and
leaving a surplus in tho treasury at the close of

$0S,4ti3.7fl.li7 at the close of tho previous year,

THE TARIFF.
NECESSITY FOR THE REDUCTION OF TAXA
TION.
In my last annual message to congress atten
tion was directed to tho fact that the revenues
of tho government exceed its uctuel noeds. and
it was suggested that legislative action should be
taken to relieve the people from the unnecessary
burden of taxation thus made apparent. In
view of the pressing importance of he subject I
deem it my duty to again urge its consideration
The income of the government with increased
economies in its collection is more than ever iu
excess of public necessities. The application of
the surplus to tho payment of such portion of
the public debt as is now at our option suject to
the extinguishment, if continued at the rate
which has lately prevailed, would retire that
class of indebtedness within less than one year
from this date. Thus a continuation of our
prosent revenue would result in the receipt of an
annual income much
GKEATER THAN NECESSARY TO MEET THE
GOVERNMENT EXPENSES
with no indebtedness on which it could be ap
plied. We should then be confronted withavast
quantify of money, the circulating medium of
the people, hoarded in the treasury when it
should be in their hands, or we should be drawn
into wasteful public extravagance, with all the
corrupting national demoralization which fol
lows in its train. But it is not tho simple ex
istence of this surplus and its threatened at
tendant evils which furnish the BtrongeBt argu
ment against our present scale of federal taxa
tion. Its worst phrase is the exaction of such a
surplus through a perversion of the relations be
tween the people and their government,a danger
ous departure from tho rules which limit the
right, of federal taxations. The good govern
ment of which every American citizen boasts has
tor its objects the protection of every person
within its borders with the greatest liberty con
sistent with the good of the country, and his per
fect security in the enjoyment of his earnings
with the least possible diminution for public
needs. When
MORE OF THE PEOPLE'S SUSTEXANCE IS EX­
ACTED
through the form of taxation than is necessary
to meet the just obligations of the govornment
and the expense of its economical administra
tion, such action becomes ruthless extortion
and a violation of the fundamental principles of
a free government. The indirect manner in
which these exactions are made has a tendency
to conceal their true character and their extent,
but we have arrived at a stage of superfluous
revenue, which has aroused the people to a real
ization of the fact that tho amonnt received pro
fessedly for the support of the government is
paid by them as absolutely if added to the price
of things which supply their daily wants as if it
was paid at fixed periods into the hands of tho
tax gatherer. Those who toil for daily wages
are bepining to understand that capital, though
sometimes vaunting its importance and clamor
ing for protection and favor of the government,
IB dull and sluggish till touched by the magical
hand of labor. It springs into activity, furnish
ing occasion for federal tax and gaining the
value which enables it to bear its burden, and
the laboring man is thoughfully inquiriug
whether these circumstances, and considering
the tribute he constanly pays into the public
treasnnr as he supplies hie daily wants, he re
ceives his fair share of the advantages. There
is also a suspicion abroad that
THE SURPLUS OF OUR REVENUE
indicates abnormal and exceptional business
profits, which under the system which produces
such surplus increases without corresponding
M&efit to the people at large the vast accumula
tions of_ a few among our citizens whose for
tunes, rivaling the wealth of the most favored in
anti-democratic nations, are not the natural
growth of a steady, plain and industrious repub
lic. Onr farm Are, too, and those engaged di
rectly and indirectly in supplying the products
of agriculture, Bee that day by day. and as often
as the daily wants of their households recur, that
they are forced to pay excessive and needless
taxation, while their products struggle in foreign
marketa with the competition of nations which,
by allowing a freer exchange of productions
than we permit, enable their people to sell for
prices which distress the American farmer. As
every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly
increasing pride of our people io American citi
zenship and in the glory of our national achieve
ments and progress,,a sentiment prevails that
the leading thing9 useful to a nation in its in
fancy may well to a great extent be discarded in
the pr^ent stage of American ingenuity, cour
age and fearless self-reliance, aud for the privi
lege of indulging this sentiment with true
American enthusiasm our citizens aro quite will

FOKXGO AN IDLE SURPLUS IN THE PUBLIC
TREASURY
and all the people know that the average rate of
federal taxation npon imports is to-day in time
of peace but little less, while upon some articles
of necessary consumption it is actually more,
than was imposed by the grievous burden will
ingly borne at a time when tho government
needed millions to maintain by war the safety
aad integrity of th£ United States. It has been
the policy of the government to collect the
principal part of its revenue by a tax upon im
ports, and no change in this policy is desirable,
bat the present condition or affairs constrains
onr people to demand that by a
REVISION OP OUR REVENUE LAWS
the receipts of the government shall be reduced
to tho necessary expense of its economical ad*
ministration, and this demand shonld be recog
nized and changed by the people representa
tives in the legislative branch of the govern
ment. Iu readjusting the questions of federal tax
ation sound public policy requires that such of
our citizens as have built up large ami important
indnstries under the present conditions shonld
not be suddenly and to their injury deprived of
these advantages, to which they have Adapted
their business but if the pnblic good requires it,
thoy shonld be content with such -consideration
as shall deal fairlj- and cautiously with their in-1
terests. while the just demand of the people for
relief from needless taxation is honewtly an
swered. A leasonalilo and timely Bubmission to
such a demand should certainly be possible
without a disastrous shock to any interest, and a
cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt and
heedless action, often the outgrowth of linpa
tieuce and delayed justico. Hue regard should
be also accorded in any proposed readjustment
to the interests of American labor so far as they
are involved. We congratulate ourselves 1 hat
there is among us no laboring class fixed within
unyielding bounds and doomed under all condi
tions to the inexorable fate of daily toil we
recognize in labor a
CHIEF FACTOR IN THE WEALTH OF THE RE­
PUBLIC,
and wo treat those who have it in their keeping
as citizens entitled to the most careful regard
and thoughtful attention. This regard and at
tention should be awarded them, not only be
cause labor is the capital of our workingmon,
justly entitled to its share of government favor,
but for the further and not less important rea
son that the laboring man, surrounded by his,
family in his humble home, as a consumer is
vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost of
living anl enables him to bring within his do
mestic circle additional comforts and advantages.
This rolation of the workman to the revenue
laws for the country, and the manner in which
it palpably influences the question of wages
should not be forgotten in the justifiable prom
inence given to the proper maintenance of the
supply and protection of well paid labor, and
these considerations suggest such an arrange
ment of the government revenues as shall re
duce tho expense of living, while it does not cur
tail tho opportunity for work, nor reduce the
compensation of American labor, and injuri
ously affect its condition and the dignified place
it holds in the estimation of our people. Bnt
OUR FARMERS AND AGRICULTURISTS,
those who from the soil produce the things con
sumed by all, are perhaps more directly and
plainly concerned than any other of our citizens
in a just and careful system of federal taxation.
Those actually engaged in and more remotely
connected with this kind of work number nearly
one-half of our population. None labor harder
or more continuously than they. No enactments
limit their hours of toil, and no interposition of
the government enhances to any great extent the
value of their prodnefs. and yet for many of the
necessaries and comforts of life which tho most
scrupulous economy enablos them to bring into
their homes, and for their implements of
husbandry, they are obliged to pay
a price largely increased by an unnatural profit
which by the action of the government is given
to the more favored manufacturer. I recommend
that, koeping in view all these considerations,
the increasing and unnecessary surplus of na
tional income annually accumulating be released
to the people by an amendment to our revenue
laws which shall cheapen the price of the necessa
ries of life and give freer entrance to such im
ported materials as by American labor may be
manufactured into marketable commodities.
Nothing can bo accomplished, however, in the
direction of this much-needed reform, unless the
subject is approached in a patriotic spirit of de
votion to the interests of the entire country and
with willingness to yield something for the
public good.
THE PUBLIC DKIIT.
RAPID REDUCTION.
The sum paid upon the public debt during tho
fiscal year ended June 30,1886, was SH."'51,013.3r5.
During tho twelve months ended October 31
18Sii. 3 per cent, bonds wore called for redemp
tion amounting to $127.281,100, of which $80.1113,
200 was so called to answer the reauiromcnts of
the law relating to the sinking fund, and $16,639.
9,10 for the purpose of reducing tlie public d^bt
by the application of a part nf th-j surplus in the
treasury to that, object. Of theb thus called
$It,2.2ti9.450 became snbject under such calls to
redemption prior to November 1. IH-Sli. The re
mainder, amounting to $25,013.65(1, matured
under the calls after thai. date. Iu
addition to the amonnt, subject to payment and
cancellation prior to November 1. There were
also paid before that day certain of these bonds
with interest thereon amounting to $5,072,350,
which were anticipated as to tho maturity, of
which 82,664,350 had not been called TIIUR $107,
311,800 had been actually applied prior to tho 1st
of November, 1886, to the extinauishment of oar
bonded and intorest-bearingd'-bt. leaving on that
day still outstanding the sum of $1,115,413,112.
Of this amount $86,818,703 were still represented
by 3 percent, bonds. They, however, have been
since November 14, or will at onco be, further ro
duced bv $22,606,150, being bonds which have
been called, as already 6tated, but not redeemed
and cancelled before the latter date.
THE SILVER QUESTION.
A SUSPENSION OF COINAGE RECOMMENDED.
During the fiscal yoar ended June, 30,1886,
there wore coined under tho compulsory
silver coinage act of 1878, $29,838,849 sil
ver dollars, and the cost of the silver
used in such coinage was S23.44S.960 Ct
Thoie had been coined up to the close of the
previous fiscal year, under the provisions of the
law, 203,882,554 silver dollars, and on the 1st. day
of December, 1886, the total amount of such coin
age was $247,131,549. The director of the mint
reports that at the time of the passage of the act
of 1878, directing this coinage, the intrinsic
value of the dollars thus coined was 94H conts
each, and that on the 31st day of July, 188B, the
price of silver reached the lowest stage ever
known, so that the intrinsic or bullion price of
our standard silver dollar on this date was less
than 72 cents.. The price of silver on
the 30th of November last was snch
as to make the dollars intrinsically
worth 78 cents each. These differences in value of
the coins represin' tho fluctuation in the price of
Bilver. and they certainly do not indicate that
compulsory coinngo by the government enhanced
the price of that commodity or secures uniform
ity in its value.
Every fair and legal effort has been made by
the treasury department to distribute this cur
rency among the people. The withdrawal of
United states treasury notes of small denomina
tions and the issuing of small silver certificates
have been resorted to in the endeavor to accom
plish this result in obedience to the will and sen
timents of the representatives of the people in
the congress. On tho 27th day of No
vember. 1886, the people held of those coins or
certificates an amonnt representing the nominal
sum of $166,8(3,041, and we still have $79,461,345
in the treasury, as against about $142,891,055 in
the hands of the people and
$72,865,37# remaining
in the treasury one year ago.
The director of the mint again urges tho ne
cessity of more vadlt room for the purpose of
storing these silver dollars which are not needed
for circulation by the people.
I hae seen no reason to change the views ex
pressed in my last annual message on the sub
ject of
THI6 COMPULSORY COINAGE,
and I again .urge its suspension on all the
grounds contained in my former recommenda
tion, reinforced by the significant increase of
our gold exportations during the last year, as ap
pears by the comparative statement herewith
presented, and for the further reasons that tho
more this currency is distributed among the peo
ple the greater becomes our duty to protect it
from disaster, and that we now have abnndauce
for all our need, and that there seems but little
propriety in building vaults to store such cur
rency when the only pretense for its coinage is
the necessity of its use by the people as a circu
lating medium.
THK REVENUE LAWS.
TH1 PRESSING NEED Off AMENDMENT.
The great number of suits now pending in the
United States courts for the southern district of
New York, growing out of the collection of the
customs revenue at the port of New York, and
the number ot such soits that are almost daily
instituted, are certainly worthy tho attention of
congress. These legal controversies, based upon
conflicting views by importers and the collector
as to the interpretation of our present complex
5?odfi5dS.finite reTen5fl Jaws, might be largely ob
viated by an amendment of those laws. But

TH^ NAVY.
IHE NEED OF REFORM.
The report of the secretary of the navy con
tains a detailed report of the condition of his
department, with suoh a statement ot tho action
needed to improve the same as should challenge
the earnest attention of congress. The present
navy of tho United States, aside from the ships
iu course of construction, consists of:
1. Fourteen single-'o-reted monitors, none of
which aro in commission nor at the present time
serviceable. Tho hut: eries of these ships are ob
Boleto and they can only be relied upon as auxil
iary ships in harbor defense, and then after 6uch
an expenditure upon them as might not bs
deemed justifiable.
2. Five fourth-rate vessels of small tonnage,
only one of which was designed as a war vessel,
and nil of which nro auxiliary merely.
.3. Twenty-seven cruising ships, threo of which
aro built of iron of small tonnage and twenty
four of wood. Of these wooden vessel it is es
timated by the navy that only three will bo ser
viceable boyond a period of six jtnis.
at. which time it may be said .. that of the present
naval force nothing worthy of the name will re
main.
All the vessels heretofore ordered aro
UNDER CONTRACT
or,in course of construction except the armored
ships, tho torpedo aud dynamite boats and one
cruiser. As to the last nf these the bids were in
excess of tho limit fixed by congress.
The production in tho United States of armor
and gun steel is a question which it seems neces
sary to settle at an early day, if the armored war
vessels are to be completed with those materials
of home manufacture. This has been the sub
ject of investigation by two boards and by two
special committees of congress withing the last
threo years. TUo report of the gun foundry
board in 1S84, of the board of fortifica
tions made in January la«t, and the reports
of tho Beleet, committee and of the two houses
made at the last session of congress, hnve
entirely exhausted llio eabject, BO fares prelim
inary investigation is involved, and their recom
mendations are snhstaiuiulty agreed. In the
event that the prrsent invitation of the depart
ment for bids to furnif-h snch of this material as
is now authorized bliall fail to
indace
domestic
raannfnctnrers to nndeitake the large expendi
tures required to prepare for this new mano
factnru. aud no other steps are taken by con
gress at its romin# session, tho secretary con
templates with dissatisfaction the necessity of
obtaining abroad thu armor and tne gun-steel
for the authorized ships. It would seem desira
ble that the w/jnt of
1
he army and the navy in
this regard should be reasonably met, and that
by uniting the contract** f-uch inducement might
be offered as would result in securing the domes
tication of these important interests.
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
A GRATIFYING CONDITION.
The affairs of the postal service show marked
and gratifying improvement during the past
year. A particular account of its transactions
and conditions is given in the report of the post
master-general, which will be laia before con
gress.
The reduction of the rate of letter postage in
1883. rendering the postal revenues inadequate to
snstain the expenditures, and business depres
sion also contributing, resulted in an excess
cost for the fiscal year ended Jane 30, 1885, of
eight and one-third million dollare. An addi
tional check upon receipts by donbling the
measure of weight in rating correspondence
and diminishing one-half the charge for
paper carriage was imposed by legislation waxen
took effect at the beginning of the past nsc&i
year, while the constant demand of
