Of Year's Achievement
' Washington. f A. P.) A nrplua of
l2.Si2.kM In poslofllre operations for
ths tha Aural yesr 191J whs snnnnnctd
in ths annual report today of I'ost
pisster General Ilurleson. Tho' nirures
nr subject to anmn adjustment which
would tnci-MM the aurplua, Mr. Burle
son Mid, adding that tola whs the sixth
time In the seven years of tha present
poatoffloa administration Hint revenues
had axoeeded expenditures.
An arcretrate turpitis of more than
tJS.MHI.OoO aa compared to an skkto
pata deficit of more ttmn isj.nno.uoo for
the preceding: seven-year period la
rhowa In mn appended table.
"Tha cause of tha change I imme
diately apparent," the report eaya
Of thla comparison. "Whereas tho
revenues under thla admlnlatratlon In
rrraeed 737.687,t18 or at the rata of
fiOM per rent, compared with the
(even-year terlod prior to the time It
assumed office, the expenditures in.
rreaeed only 164J.S35.79ll. or at the rate
ef 43.49 per cent. The difference be-m-een
tha increase In expenditures and
tha increase in revenues, leas louses, I
equals the amount of tne net cnange in
favor of tha public treasury."
Much of the criticism leveled at
' tha department's financial policy, Mr.
Burleson aald, "was due to lack of
complete and accurate Information."
Tha facta, as presented," he added,
"teU a atory of achievement. They do
not call (or explanations or apologies
and none are given. Tha admlnlstra
Hon stands squarely on Ita record."
; Discussing improvements In the serv
ice, Mr. Burleson said nothing had been
left undone within his authority "to
effect readjustments in the Interest of
nil tha people and not In that, of any
special class," adding:
"Because of tha curtailment of what
may be termed 'special class' postal
facilities there has grown up strenuous
hostility upon tha part of a limited
number Of 'special Interests,' tha ex
pense of whose private business waa
larawly oald by tha government lnatead
of by themselves. This lias particular t
ond-class mailing privilege which had
until tha advent of the present admin
fatratlon been grossly abused."

Tr?pper,
A smart and clever as you are
A mink may smarter be by far.
This ia what Billy Mink said to
himself as he uncovered the trap
which had been set for him at the
entrance to one of his favorite holes
In the bank of the Laughing Brook.
Of course, he was thinking of the
trapper when he said it. At first
Billy flew into a great rage. It mado
him angry clear t the tip of his tail
just to think he must now be always
watching for traps where for so long
thero had been no danger.
At first, on discovering that trap,
he had thought to go on at once up
the Laughing Brook and see what
more he could discover. Hut you re
member that Billy was hungry and
that there was a piece of perfectly
delicious fish back In that hole. He
knew now just how that linn hap
pened to bo .here. He knew that

"It will serve that trapper right if
I can get that fun," mutteed Billy.
: hat trapper had put that piece of fish
in there, hoping that Billy would be
no eager to get In that he would be
careless.
The more he smelled it, the more
he wanted It. "It will serve that
trapper right if I can get that fish!"
muttered Billy. "Perhaps it will teach
V. 1 . . . 1. t 1,A ! a i ' 'i am
thinks he Is. I wondor if I can etey'l
tvr uuw. imi.
Billy sat down and studied the
trap and the entrance to the hole.
The more he studied the more sure
he became that he would be running
a very foolish risk if he tried to step
over that trap just to get a piece of
flsii. Tou see, that trap had been
very cunningly placed. But the more
he smelled that fish the more 'he
wanted it. " ,
Billy stroked his whiskers thought
fully. Of course that didn't have any
thing to do with it, but Just the
same while he was stroking them he
remembered something. His eyes
snapped and he grinned. Way up on
tho bank, between the roots of a cer
tain tree, was a little tiote. It was
the entrance to a little underground
tunnel, and that tunnel led right
down to the very hole In front of
which the trap was set. It really
was a sort of back door.
Billy turned and In a flash had
scrambled up the bank. With his
keen little nose he made sure that
there was no scent of the trapper up
thni-a VJa .'nH BlirA that the t nnp.r
had not found that little hole be- J
tween the roots of that certain tree, j
But though he was certain of this, ,
he took no chances. As he approached i
that hole he took the greatest care1
to make sure that no trap was in
there.
There was none. Once Inside the
hole, Billy ran along that little tun
nel chuckling to himself. He knew
that now there was no danger. He
could got thaffish. He did get it.
He got it -and ate It right there.
Then he turned and ran out the way
ha had entered. Some low that fish
had tasted the best of any fish he
had ever eaten. It was because he
had outwitted the trapper.

Are a Harmless Substitute
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets are the
result of Dr. Edwards' determination
not to treat liver and bowel complaints
with calomel. For 17 years he used
these tablets (a vegetable compound
mixed with olive oil) in bis private
practice with great success.
They do all the good that calomel
does but have no had after effects. No
pains, no griping, no injury to the
gums or danger from acid foodsr- -yet
they stimulate the liver and bowels.
Take Dr. Edwards' v Olive Tablets
when you feel '"logy" and "heavy."
Note how they clear clouded brain and
perk up the spirits. 10c and 25c a bor..
