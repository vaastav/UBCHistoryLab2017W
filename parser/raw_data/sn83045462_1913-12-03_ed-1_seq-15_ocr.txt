ecutive sessions may be held. The com
mittee voted to accept the amendment.
Dr. Shaw, the first speaker, said that
no attempt was to be mad' to convert
the rules committee to woman suffrage,
but that the suffragists merely wanted a
suffrage committee in the House.
Suffrage Crowded Out.
Mrs Helen II Gardener made the point
that because of President Wilson's deter
mination to get trust legislation this year
tbe judiciary committee, which has al
ways considered suffrage in the House,
will be too busy to gi\t- proper atten
tion to votes for women.
"The judiciary committee is warned
that it i* to he heavily burdened during
this Congress." said Mrs Gardener. "As
never hefif* the question of woman suf

There will be much besides the mere per
functory annual hearing.
"You will remember that there is a
| committee on Indian affairs. Now, why?
! Are the Indians more important than tiie
j women?
"The democratic party now has the op
j>ortunity of a century."
Mrs. Ida Husted Harper said there are
now 1..VJO.OOI) women in the l.'nited States
who are completely enfranchised and
more than tt,000,?60 who may vote for
t presidential electors.
"This number is liable to be increased."
she continued. "Four states?Nevada.
Montana and North and South Dakota
will vote* on suffrage in 1914. The legis
latures of eight other states gave a
majority vote in favor of submitting suf
frage amendments this year."
She said that until 1884 the House had
a suffrage committee. Mrs. Harper re
ferred to the suffrage parade here last
March, saying the acts of men on that
occasion were disgraceful.
Miss Jane Addams Speaks.
Miss Jane Addams was the next speak
er. She took up the states right ques- i
tion, bearing on the question of whether
Congress has the right to control the
voting qualifications. She showed that
in a number of instances Congress has
exercised control of who shall vote in
the states.
1 here is a wave of public opinion i
growing over this land in favor of this
movement." she continued. "We expect
that twice as many women will be vot
ing In two years."
Representative I la rd wick ol" Georgia
suggested that the House committee on '
the election of President and Vice Presi- !
dent might be glad to consider woman
suffrage. Mr. Henry said that Repre-!
sentativ e Rucker of Missouri is chair
man of that committee. He said that
"perhaps you would like to know how
he stands on suffrage."
"We do not care about that so much."!
replied Dr. Shaw, "but w<- do care that'
the committee shall heed what the peo
ple of the country want."
Retort Causes laughter.
One of the members of the committee
said that the committee mentioned is a
"dead" one.
"It wouldn't remain dead lung if we
got at it, retorted Dr. Shaw, amid
laughter.
Miss Desha Breckenridge of Ken
tucky, a granddaughter of Henry Clay,
declared that a constitutional amend
ment for suffrage will not harm the
south.
"1 must admit," she said, "that the
men of my state now speak oratorically
of women in connection with horses and
whisky, and politically in connection
with idiots and criminals."
Objection Over Committee.
Objection l?o the idea of turning the
suffiage question over to the commit
tee on the election of President and
Vice President was made by Repre
sentative Roper of California. He said
that because of the President's recom
mendation for presidential primaries
this committee probably w ill be very
busy.
"You have committees to consider
every other kind of a question." he con
tinued. "Why not one for this ques
tion ?"
Representative Garrett of Teunensee
asked if it was not expected by the
women that the proposed committee
be composed of men favorable to suf
frage . Mr. Roper replied that all that
was desired was that the committee be
fair. Dr. Shaw interjected liiat even
if a committee against suffrage should
be named it could be won over.

President Wilson's Failure
to Advocate Woman Suffrage
Is Criticised by Convention
President Wilson's failure to apeak of
woman suffrage irt his message to Con
gress yesterday was made the subject of
several speeches delU'ered at the Na
tional American Woman Suffrage Asso
ciation convention at the New Masonic
Temple last night, which resulted in the
adoption of a resolution criticising his
| stand.
, Tiie resolution, introduced by Mrs. .1.
William t-unk of Maryland, was as fol
j lows:
"!t is the sense of this meeting that
ident Wilson failed to rise to the
sup.imlst heights of democracy when he
tailed in his message to Congress to
recommend the freedom of half the citi
i MHS. MAID MISKH OF CHICAGO.
zens of the United States, and probably
half the citizens of the civilized world "
Some Defenders of President.
The resolution was adopted by an over
whelming: majority, although some of the
more conservative suffragists voted
against it on the ground that the Presl
| dent had, so many important subjects to
j consider in his message that he should
not be criticised for not mentioning votes
for women.
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of
the national association, brought up the
subject when she made a short address.
She declared that the President said In
his message that the time has come for
an extension of greater social justice, and
that she had hoped he would include
some measure of political justice.
Dr. Shaw called attention to the fact
that President Wilson in his message
urged the necessity of the extension of
the ballot to the Filipinos ?nd territorial
voters' rights. for Alaska.
Several other delegates to the conven
tion made statements along the same
line.
Need of Court Reforms.
"Women and Children in the Courts"
was Mte general topic of the addresses
last night. The speakers included Mrs.
, Joseph T. Bowen of Chicago. Judge Har
| ry Olsen. who spokf on "The Court of
! Domestic Relations and the Couri of
Morals." and Miss Maude Miner, who
spoke 011 "The Women's Xight Court and
the Work of a Probation Officer."
"From the time of the arrest of a woni
man." said Mrs. Bowen. "to the final dis
position of her case she is handicapped
by being in the charge of and surrounded
by men. who naturally cannot be expect
ed to be as sympathetic and understand
ing as one of her own sex. In the police
station she is at a disadvantage, for such
places of detention in most of our large
: cities are not tit for human habitation. In
Chicago the majority of them are da.'k
and insanitary. The women are herded
together, the innocent with guilty, the
clean with the unclea*. the young girl
j with the prostitute. The sleeping accom
modations are vile.
"When the woman appears for her pre
liminary hearing she is tousled and un
tidy as the result of being without proper
toiiet accommodations, and is therefore
apt to create an unfavorable Impression.
In all police stations separate rooms or
cells should be provided, with plenty of
light and air and sleeping and toilet ac
commodations for the women."
Mrs. Bowen toid of what had been done
to meet this situation in Chicago by the
I establishment of the court of domestic
relations and the morals court. The lat
I ter hears the caaes of women charged
j with improper conduct.
Compromise Is Forced.
l'ear oi" bringing on a revolt that might
give America a militant suffragist or
ganization yesterday caused leaders in
the National Woman Suffrage Association
to abandon their efforts to have adopted

MRS. ESTHER ABELSON SELLING

MASONIC TEMPLE.
a new constitution reported by a revision
committee appointed a year ago.
Advocates of rights for state associa
tions and opponents of a proposed budget
system for raising the national organiza
tion's funds declined emphatically to ac
cept the recommendation, and finally the
draft was referred back to the committer
with instructions that a compromise con
stitution to meet the views of all factions
be prepared.

House Committee Indorses
'
Proposed Changes in Pos
tal Savings Service.
The House committee on post offices
and post roads, at its session yesterday,
after Third Assistant Postmaster Gen
i eral Dockery had appeared before it by
| direction of the Postmaster General, de
cided to report favorably the bill remov
i ing the restriction of $100 placed on the
amounts that may be received as a postal
I savings deposit from any person within a
calendar month and increasing the
amount upon which interest may be paid
from $"4M) to 11.000.
The bill, if it becomes a law. said Mr.
Dockery today, will allow postal savings
: depositories to receive from a single de
; positor any amount he cares to deposit:
j but it provides that interest shall be paid
j only on the maximum amount of $1,000.
; even though the deposits exceed that
amount.
It was said that Monday a depositor
called with $1,500, but. as the clerk at the
Washington office could accept only *100
of it. he decided not to split the amount,
i but to invest it in money orders for safe
; keeping. Another depositor who called
j the same day offered $3<R>. $100 of which
was accepted and a certificate therefor I
was issued. A short while later he
called to say that he had either lost or
had stolen from him the other $UOO. The
proposed bill will make these occurrences
impossible.
The House committee also, it is said, de
cided to report favorably the bill author
izing the payment of money orders at any
post office. At present they may be paid
only at the offices on which they are
drawn.
Other bills in which the department is
interested, such as the one relieving post
masters from individual responsibility
for losses of postal savings funds by fire,
burglary or other unavoidable accidents,
it is understood, are also to be favorably
reported.
