THE FINANCIAL QUESTION.
QTh report of the secretary of the treas
ury incorporated to large extent Into th
moanage, all the llgurea a to receipt, and
expenditure, ordinary and extraordinary
being quoted, Tho total receipt from all
aouroe exceeded those for the flaoal year
nded June 30, 1887, by $7,8(12,707.10. The
ordinary expenditure of Uie flaoal year
ending Juno 30. 18H8. was ail,TO3,ft)8.0T,
leaving a aurplua of $110,1112,118.09. Th
docronse in those expenditure aa compared
with the flacal your ended June 80, 1887,
WM $3,278,221.30. Notwlthatandlng tlie
payment of more than Ave million dollar
for pension In execs of what wa paid for
tbkt purpoeo in tho latter mentioned year.
Tha requirement of the sinking fund act
hav bean met for the your ending June 3,
1888, and for Uie current yonr also, by tin
purchaso of bonds. - The bond purchasing
operation! eo far transacted are recited and
the saving to th government iUted. Tha
apparent gain he shows to be in reality
lost to the poople of $55,700,000, on th
bond purohase so far made. Thl calcula
latlon would seem to domonstrnte that it
excessive and unnecessary taxation I oon
tlnued and the government Is forced to
