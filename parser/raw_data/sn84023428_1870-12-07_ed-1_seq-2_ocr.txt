The Europcan.War.
The war news of the last week has been
more contradictory than usual. The French
have reported a succession of victories for
their armies, and if their dispatches were
exclusively believed, we might suppose
that the climate of Franoe is getting too
warm for the Gormans, and that the in
v'aders will soon bo obliged to make an in-
glorious retreat across the Rhine. But
the assumption! of the French are greatly
modified by the German reports, which
announce the continued rcpulso of the en.
emy In their attempts to break the siege
6f Paris. : There have been, from all ac
counts, numerous minor engagements, in
which' the honors and advantages Lave
been about equally divided, bat the most
important event of the week was the
heavy sortie from Paris, which began on
Tuesday and involved severe lighting with
tho besiegers on that and tho following
day. It seems to be certain that General
Duc'rot succeded in getting out of Paris
with an army of from one hundred thous
and to one hundred and fifty thousand
men, bqt it is doubtful whether he has
united' with the army of tho Loire, which
must havo been aa important object of his
movement.
The French claim a great victory. The
Germans say that they repulsed the one
my at every point, and that their losses
are small. ,
The vigor displayed by tho French is
creditable under the circumstances, and
the general impression that wo derive
iroiii the news of tho last week is rather
favorable to them, after making due al
lowauces. A ' ,

; meetino of Friday, dec. 2, 1870.
President, II. Safford. ' .
The , room was filled this evening, and
the discussion well sustained. ' It should
be understood in the reports of tho Es
says, Speeches, &o , that only the leading
ideas of the speakers aro intended to be
given, and that sometimes makes the sen
tences brief and unconnected ; this applies
as well to the past evenings as tho pres
ent. Essay by Satidford Slocum.
1 shall attempt to relate a little of. my
experience on a farm of about 100 acres,
the soil of which is clay and sandy loam.
lu my experience, especiul.y on sandy
soils, it is best to plough in the fall, as ii
not only forwards tho work in the spring,
but the action or the frost prepares the
soil in a better manner for tho crop es
pecially for sinal) grains. I plough lund
for CDrn six inches deep ; for potatoes,
eight to ten inches. Plant what corn I
can manure with hog manure in the hill ;
can raise from 30 to 40 bushels per acre
without further manuring. Generally make
about 20 or 30 loads with two hogs, by
using muck and tho slops from tho house.
In this ' way I raise a fair crop with but
littlo manure and have a quantity left for
other crops; I think it pays as well and
keeps the farm iu bettor condition than to
use more ou corn. For potatoes 1 put on
25 loads to Iho acre, harrow, and with a
small plough mark out the rows and cover
three or four inches, in good seasons I
raise from 200 to 300 bushels to the aero.
I'always plant on tho sud, never keep my
land ploughed but two years at a tirnp. I
think it bad to plant more than two years
in succession, it either reduces the land
to a ruinous extent or much manure will
bo used which is needed olsewhere. What
manure 1 have left after planting cornand
potatoes I draw out on laud to be seeded
down, and sow not over three bushels of
oats per acre and spied with herdsgrass
and clover, and have always got a good
enp of grass on land treated in this man
ner. , I sow oats as soon as the frost is
out, by so doing I get a better crop,
they are not so liable to lodge, and get a
better stock. In my judgment there is as
much value according to tho cost, if they
arc harvested in tho right time, in onts
as in any crop i raise. I cut corn as soon
as the husk begins to turn ; think the corn
oquallygood and the fodder is worth twice
as m ich as when allowed to stand till ripe
Having manured my land lightly while
ploughed, L top-dress in bept. with manure
mado during tho summer, and fo keep up
the strength of the land, and have six or
seven acres of newly-seeded or top-dressed
land to mow each year, and go over the
whole ot my tillage land once in six or
seven years. ,
Discussion topic : How shall we dispose
ot our tarni products to our dealers at
home, to commission men in market, or
to consumers direst, and if to consumers
. direct, how shall we deal with them ?
A. R. Bailey. I have had some cxpe.
nenco in uca nng wmi men at norno, and also
with commission dealers.
If you havo a dealer whom you know
and can trust, you oan sometimes do bet
ter to send him your butter and sometimes
not. Sometimes the market declines and
you realize less than you would to have
sold at homo, and if it advances yon re
alize more. Most commission men dea'
more or less on their own account, and if
they have a lot. and the market fulls they
sell their own first and the farmers' 1-st.
I sent some one year that 1 paid 33 cents
for, and after keeping it for months I only
got 10 cents, and it was good butter, too.
1 think if farmers would take more pains
to make d nice article of butter they could
always get a good paying price at home
which would be better than trying to sell
to commission dealers or to consumers di.
rect.
II. D. Bryant. This matter of dispos
ing of farm products is one of much im
portance to farmers. All cannot be cattle-brokers
or stand in the market to sell
their butter und chceso, and men who arc
acquainted can sell produce better than
those who are not. Tho first car of cattle
I over sold was the hardest work to get
fair prices I ever had j the buyers seemed
to consider me legitimate prey for them
to seize upou.
Men who buy produce have to buy af
ter allowing for the fluctationsaf the mar
ket, und they act accordingly ; sometimes
they lose heavily, and again they make a
handsome profit. I think if farmers could
have a man who was "square-toed" in all
respects to whom they could send their
butter they might do better than in any
other way, but the trouble is to find the
man. All in all, in my judgment, the best
way to disposo of our produce is to send
to some man who will sell direct to gro
cers to retail, or to consumers. Such a
plan has been adopted by the Labor Reform
Club in their purchases, and it works nice
ly. Farmers' Clubs, or farmers not in
Clubs, might send ono of their number to
sell their products and pay him a fair price
for doing the work.
A. R. Bailey. I think a Good way
would be to find a good reliablo grocer
and send butter or cheese to him and from
3 to 5 cents per pouud more would bo re
alized. ' I. A. Dwfrwll. Tho nearer together
we bring the producer and consumer the
larger profit wo can realize on what we
sell, but thcro are great difficulties in the
way so few farmers are acquainted with
grocers or consumers that a "middle man"
seems to bo necessary, as things now are
wo havo several. ' "
' Tho ono who buys here usunlly buys on
commission and sendf totholinase in mar
ket, which often sells again at wholesale,
aud then the last buyer to tho grocer who
retails it out, and all theso persons have
to receive a profit from tho proceeds of
our butter, , , ' .
The best way would bo to send a good
man and trust him to dispose of our pro
duco when bo dorms best if Wo can find
sueh anono, : , "". : !:
D. N. Farrand. 1 do not know, as I can
nay anything to interest about this ques
tion, but Inst week I or tho Clerk made a
mistake, 1 intended to have Said my un
cle who feeds sour milk n-akes from 200
to 250 pounds of butter par cow, and he
L
has it from 3U0 to 350 lbs. per cow. The
Clerk understood at the time "800 to 350"
and thought rather a" "big boo" but put it
down. In regard to this question 1 havo
always sold to purchasers hero. 1 think
it would be an improvement in our sys
tcm if we could have regular market days
a they do in St. Albans. Butter has beep
quoted there about 5 cts. higher than here
on'an average this season.
W. W. Delano. Under existing oir
custances I know of no better way than to
sell at liotiie,
Butter is otir hiain stay, nnd in sending
it to commission house there is an uueer-
i tainty as to what if any returns we shall
receive that 1 do not wish to assume. I
had rather take what I can get and let it
go here. " A market day would better
matters some if we could have one.
D. J. Safl'ord. If our farmers went to
St. Albans with their butter they would
find a greater range in prices there than
here.i A "tip-top" article brings a good
price and a poorer article a much less price
than here; usually many of tho buyers
are not merchants and do not hesitate
about cutting down tho priee for fear of
losing tho seller's custom in their store.
A. R Bailey. I examined a stock
there (St. Albans) a little while ago, found
some butter which brought 40 cents or
over and other as low as 17 cents. Most
of the buyers there belong there and buy
for themselves or on commission.
A. G.' West. I do not think it would
be practicable for our farmers to deal di
rectly with consumers or retailers, but I
think a market day would bo a benefit
to us.
H. D. Bryant. There is a very great
range of prices in market, in some things
an unwarrantable range. Butter' sells
from 17 to 40 cents nnd over, beef from 5
to 14 cents, Ac., but yon go to a house
and try to buy a woman's butter when it
is worth, say 35 cents, if nice, und if you
can't pay at least 30 cents for her's on nc-
count of its poor quality you must invent
some sort of an excuse to get out of doors
or you aro iu dang.'r of being kicked
out. Men feel hurt and misused because
they do not g t the best prices for their
cattle or sheep when they are in poor or
der so that no buyer CJuld pay prices any
where near the best quotations and live.
There are not twenty first-class feeders in
this county ; there are a few in this town,
but only a few, they can almost always
get satisfactory prices. Buyers must look
forward to perhaps u broken murket when
they buy, and also look for a profit, for
themselves.
D. J. SafTord If we had a market
day Mr. Bryant would not need to run
the risk of being kicked out of doors while
running around after Lutter, and one great
thing it would do for us would be to set
the farmers' wits' to work to make better
butter, a man might not acknowledge
that another's was bettor than his but he
would sec it if it was aud try nnd find out
where his fault was.
W. W. Delano. A market day is the
thing for ns. Our merchants deal in but
ter and a man comes in with butter to sell
which is not "the thing" but he is a good
customer and his trade mmt not bo lost
so he gets the best price, and his neigh
bor who decs make a nice article has to
help make up the loss by a less price than
he ought to have.
P. F. Spauldinz. W'c must know what
our produce is worth and then we can dt
as well at home as to send to market
Market days would help some by enabling
us to compare our products with others
and so to imnrovi.
J P. Davis. I catno to learn but still
have an opinion of my own. Butter seems
to be most talked about, because there is
most sold and most is mado out of it by
middle-men.
I think tho best way for us to do is to
employ a man to market for us and pay
him a regular salary for doing it. He
may take the butter and go from here
with it. or live in Boston, but I think it
would bo better for hun to live there and
have it sent to him on regular days, and
we should take pains to havo it sent from
hero to tho cars iu decent shape which we
ean do if we take sufficient care. We
support several middle-meu now with our
sale, and 1 don't expect they will agree
with me in my views for we should not
need them al) then.
P. F. Spaulding. I think more might
be saved on wool, pound for pound, than
anything else, by care in putting up and
a good agent to sell for usj several cents
difference in price would be gained, I be
lieve. W. W. Dolano. I want to know it any
man here ever seut a yoko of cattle to
market and got more than he was offered
at home for them?
II. D. Bryant. Yes. M. N. Wheeloek
sent a yoke of oxen by me and pot $10
moro for them than I dared pay him for
them, and some ten mon in town received
from 1 to 2 cents per pound more for their
butter last year by sending by me thau 1
could promise to pay them.
I It will bo perceived hat most of the
Club do not have anything to sell except
butter, although (hero ar8 us many as ono
yoko of oxen, a horse and a dozen or so of
sheep sold out of our town iu tho course
of the year. Clkiik. x "

This is a subject every farmer should

and care are a dead loss ti the farmer.
Many farmers put fat younir cattle in the
yard in the fall and feed them straw.
stuiKs ana coarse hay and iu tho spring

they 1 commenced feeding. This should
not he so. Hogs aro profitable if well
fed, but how many pigs are raised on half
feed in a dirty, wet yard and ut three
months aro not as good as they should be
at four weeks old? The team," too. should
