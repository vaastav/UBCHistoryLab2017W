PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
Heflular Army of 141,843, Supplemented by Force of 400,000
Trained Citizens Is Urged Gravest Menace to the Peaco
of the Country Comes from Disloyal Foreign-Born
Citizens Plan for Larger Navy Outlined.
Washington, Deo. T. President Wllnon
today delivered Ills annual mei8ticn at a
Joint eslon of tho two houses of con
res. lie ald In partr-
Bines I last had pie rrtvltos tit IU1
dressing you on the state ot the Union
-the war of nations on the other side of
the Yea, which hod then only burun to
-disclose Its portentous proportions, has
-extended Its threatening and sinister scope
until It hftsvsjfi'ept ' within ItB name some
oorttnn of et-erv nilnrter of thn olohe. not
excepting: our. hemisphere, has altered tho
whole face of International affairs, und
"cow presents a prospect of reorganiza
tion and reconstruction such na states
men and pcoplca hnvo never been called
upon' to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously neutral.
It was our manifest duty to do so. n
itho day of readjustment and recupera
tion we earnestly hope and bellevo that
we can bo of Inllnlto Bervlce.
In this neutrality, to which they were
fcldden not only by their separate life nnd
their habitual detachment from the poll
tics of Europe but also by a clear per
ception of International duty, the states
of America have become conscious of a
new nnd more vital community of Inter
est and moral partnership in affairs, more
clearly conscious of the many common
sympathies nnd Interosts and duties which
told them stund together.
We have been put to tho test In tho case
9f Mexico, and we have stood the test.
Whether we have benefited Mexico by
the course wo have pursued remains to
be seen. Her fortunes are In her own
hands. But wo have at least proved that
we will not talto advantage of her In her
-distress and undertake to Imposo upon
her an ardor and government of our own
chooslnfT.
We will aid and befriend Mexico, but
we will not coerco her; and our course
with regard to her ought to bo sufllclent
iroof to all America that we peek no po
Itlcal suzerainty or selfish control.
Not Hostile Rivals.
The moral Is, thnt the states of Amer
ica are not hostllo rivals, but co-oper--ntlng
friends, and that their growing
sense of community of Interest, alike In
matters political and In matters econom
ic. Is likely to give them a new slgnlll
cance as factors In International affairs
and In the political history of tho world.
It presents them as In a very deep and
true senso a unit In world affairs, spir
itual partners, standing together bocause
thinking together, quick with common
sympathies and common Ideals. Separat
ed, they are subject to all the cross cur-
,fn--(.l-.-!d--BallUC3 of a. world
of hoctllo rivalries; united In spirit und
.purpose they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This Is Pnn-Amerlcanlsm. Jt has none
of tho spirit of emplro in It. It Is tho em
bodiment, the effectual embodiment, of
the spirit of law nnd Independence and
liberty and mutual service.
Thcro Is, I venture to point out, an espe
cial significance Just now attaching to
this wholo matter of drnwlni? the Amer
icas together In bonds of honorable part
nership and mutual advantage because of
tho economic readjustments which the
world must Inevitably witness within tho
next generation, when peace shall have
t last resumed Its healthful tasks. In
tho performance of these tasks I believe
the Americas to bo destined to play their
-parts togother. I am Interested to fix
your ottentlon on this prospect now be
cause unless you take It within your
"View and permit the full significance of
It to command your thought I cannot
find the right light In which to set forth
the pnrtlculur matter that lies at tho
very front of my whole thought ns I ad
dress you tcKiny, I mean national do-
-fense.
Might to Maintain Right.
Out of Buch thoughts grow all our poli
cies. We regard war merely as a means
of asserting the rights of a people against
aggression. And we are as fiercely Jeal
ous of coercive or dictatorial power with
in our own nation as of aggression from
'without. Wo will not maintain a stand
ing army except for uses which are ns
necessary in times of peace as In times
of war; and wo shall always see to It
that our military peace establishment la
no longer than Is actually and continuous
ly needed for the uses of days In which
no enemies move against us. But we
do believe In a body of fren cltlzenB ready
And sufllclent to take care ot themselves
s.nd of the governments which they have
.set up to servo them. In our constitutions
themselves we have commanded that 'the
Tight of the people to keep and bear
nrms shall not bo Infringed," and our
confidence has been that uur safety In
times of danger would He In the rising of
the nation to take caro of Itself, as the
farmers rose at Lexington,
But war has never be3n a mere matter
of men and guns. It Is a thing of disci
plined might. If our citizens nrn over to
.Tight effectively upon a Budden summons,
they muat know how modern fighting is
done, and, what to do when tho summons
comes to render themselves Immediately
available and Immediately effective. And
the government must bo their servant In
this -matter, must supply them with the
training thoy noed to tnko care ot them
selves and ot It, The military arm ot their
government, which they will not allow to
tllroct them, thoy may properly uso to
iaerve them nnd make their Independence
.secure und not their own Independence
merely but the rights also of thoso with
whom they have made common cause,
should they also be put In Jeopardy,
They must be lilted to play the great
role In the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened ambi
tion to play.
It la with these Ideals In mind that the
plans of the department of war for more
adequate national defense were conceived
-which will he laid before you, and which
1 urge you to sanction and put Into ef
fect as soon as they can be properly scru
tinized and dlacuased. They seem to me
the essential first steps, and they seem
to me for the present sufllclent.
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force ot the regular army from
AFFECTION THAT NEVER DIES
Old Friends Have a Place In the Heart
i From Which They Never Can
De Removed.
f I As t pld' rlonds, they are like old
i, shoes, an, abiding comfort und a great
"Solace. If they; have not been tried In
'extremity the have, been tested by
' 'V ''time and Its mutations, and by the
iwear'ot yVa?H. Thore Is little more
beautiful'-111' human experience) than
lone-iustalned friendships between
lt present strength of S.K3 officers nnd
102,9X5 enlisted men of all services to a
strength of 7,136 officers nnd 134,707 en
listed men, or 141.843, all told, all serv
ices,' rank and file, by the addition of 12
companies of coast nrtlllery. 15 com
panies of engineers, ten regiments of In
fantry, four regiincntB of Hold artillery,
nnd four nero squadrons, bosldes "CO offi
cers required for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all-Important duty
of training the citizen force of which I
shnll presently speak, 792 tion-comtrds-sinned
oltlcers for service In drill, recruit
ing nnd the like, and the necessary quota
of enlisted men for tho quartermaster
corps, tho hospital corps, the ordnance
department nnd other similar auxiliary
services. These nro the additions noces
sary to render the nrmy ndequato for Its
present duties, duties which It has to
perform not only upon our own conti
nental coasts and borders nnd nt our In
terior nrmy posts, but also In tho Phil
ippines, In tho Hawaiian Islands, at the
Isthmus, and In Porto Itlco.
Force of Trained Cltlzons.
By way of making tho country ready
to nssert somo part ot Its real power
promptly and upon n larger scale, should
occasion arise, the plan also contemplates
supplementing the nrmy by n force of
400,000 disciplined citizens, raised In Incre
ments of 133,000 a year throughout n pe
riod of three years. This It la proposed
to do by a process of enlistment under
which tho serviceable men ot the coun
try would be asked to bind themselves to
servo with tho colors for purposes of
training for short periods throughout
three years, and to come to tho colors
nt call at any time throughout an addi
tional "furlough" period of three years.
This force of 400.000 men would bo pro
vided with personnl accoutrements as fast
ns enlisted and their equipment for tho
Held mado rendy to bo eupplled at any
tlmo. They would be nssemblod for train
ing nt stated Intervals at convenient
places In nssoctntlon with sultnblo units
of tho regular army. Their period of
annunl training would not necessnrlly ex
ceed two months In the year.
It would depend upon tho patriotic feel
ing ot the younger men of tho country
whether they responded to such a call
to service or not. It would depend upon
the patriotic spirit of tho employers of
tho country whether they made it possi
ble for the younger men In their em
ploy to respond under favorable condf
tlons or not. I, for one, do not doubt
tho pntrlotlo devotion either of our young
men or of those who glva them employ
mentthose for whoso benefit and protec
tion they would In fact enlist. I would
look forward to the success ot such an
experiment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tlon for defenso seems to me to bo nh
solutoly Imperative now. We cannot do
less,
Program for the Navy.
The progrnm to bo laid before you con
templates tho construction within flvo
years ot 10 battleships, C battle cruls
ers, 10 scout cruisers, f-0 destroyers, IS
fleet submarlnea, 85 coast submarines,
four t'unboats, one hospital ship, two
ammunition ships, two rucl-ol! ships and
ono repair ship. It Is proposed thnt of
this numbor we shall tho first year pro
vide for the construction of two battle
ships, two battle cruisers, threo scout
cruisers, 15 destroyers, live fleet subma
rlnea, 16 const submarines, two gunboats,
and ono hospital shlpt the second year,
two battleships, one ecout crulsor, ton
destroyers, four fleot submarines, 15 coast
submarines, one gunboat, and ono fuel
oil ship; the third year, two battleships,
ono battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five
destroyers, two licet submarines, nnd 15
coast submarines; tho fourth yenr, two
battleships, two battle cruisers, two
scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet
submarines, 15 coast submarines, ono am
munition ship, and ono fuel-oil ship; and
the fifth yenr, two battleships, ono battle
cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroy
ers, two fleet submarines, 15 coast subma
rines, ono gunboat, ono ammunition ship
and ono repair ship.
The secrctury of the navy Is asking
also for tho Immediate addition to tiie
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors,
5.600 apprentice seamen, and 1,500 marines
This Incieaso would bo sufficient to care
for the ships which are to be completed
within tho fiscal yenr 1917 und also for
the number of mon which must be put In
training to man tho ships which will be
completed early In 1518. It Is nlso neces
sary that tho number of midshipmen nt
tho naval academy at Annapolis should
bo Increased by at least SCO In order that
tho force of officers should be more rap
Idly added to! nnd authority la asked to
appoint for engineering duties only, ap
proved graduates of engineering colleges,
and for service In the nvlutlon corps a
certain number of men taken from civil
life,
If this full program should be carded
out we should liavo built or building In
1921, according to the estlmntes of surviv
al and standards ot classification followed
by the genornl board of tho department,
an effecttvo navy consisting of 27 battle
shlpa of the first lino, six battle cruisers,
SS battleships of the second lino, ton nr
mored cruisers. 13 scout crulse'rs, five
first-class cruisers, threo second-class
cruisers, ten third-class crulaers, 108 de
troyers, IS fleet submarlnea, 157 coast sub
marines, six monitors, 20 gunbonts, four
supply ships, 15 fuel ships, four trans
ports, three tendera to torpedo vessels,
eight vessels of apeclal types, nnd two
ammunition ships. This would be a navy
fitted to our needs and worthy of our
traditions.
Trade and Shipping.
But armies and Instruments of war are
only part ot what has to bo considered
If we are to consider the Buprcme matter
of national self-sufficiency and security
In all Its aspects. There are othor groat
matters which will be thrust upon our at
tention whether we will or not. Thero
Is, for example, a very pressing question
of trade and shipping Involved In this
great problem of national adequacy. It
Is necessary for many weighty reasons of
women grown far Into the years, for
example, nnd yet who have maintained
their communion ot drcamB and con
fidences unbroken and unspoiled.
There Is llttlo more refreshing to con
template than friendships between
ralddle-aged or old mon that have, ox
lsted In strength nnd harmony from
boyhood days. Other friendships havo
these folks of the passing generation,
tome ot thorn true, some ot them
tried, but none ot thorn as richly re
garded and highly treasurod as the
old ones. For necessarily tlioro are
national efficiency and development that J
wo should hnvo a grent merchant ma
rlna. The great merchant fleet wo once
used to make us rich, that great body of
sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag
Into every sen, and who wore tho pride
and often tho bulwark ot tho nation, we
have almost driven out of oilstenca by
Inexcusable neglect and Indifference nnd
by a hopelessly blind and provincial pol
icy of so-called economic protection. It
Ib high time wo repulred our mistake and
resumed our commercial Independence on
the seas.
Kor It Is a question of Independence.
If other nations go to war or seek to
hamper each other's commerce, our mer
chants, It reems, nre at their mercy,
to do with ns they please. Wo must use
their ships, and use them ns they deter
mine. We have not ships enough of our
own. We cannot handle our own com
merce on the sens. Our Independence Is
provincial, and Is only on land nnd with
in our own borders Wo are not likely
to be permitted to uso eVen the Bhlps of
other nations In rivalry of their own
trad', nnd are without means to extend
our commerce even where the doors are
wide open nnd our goods desired. Such
n sltuntlon Is not to ho endured. It Is
of cnpltnl Importance not only that tho
United Slates should bo Its own carrier
on tho sens and enjoy tho economic In
dependence which only nn adequate mer
chant marlno would give It, but also that
the American hemisphere na a whole
should enjoy a Itke Independence and self
sufficiency. If It Ib not to be drawn Into
tho tnngle of lluropenn nffnlra. Without
such Independence the wholo question of
our political unity nnd self-determination
Is very seriously clouded and complicated
Indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true or ef
fective American policy without ships of
our own not Bhlps of war, but ships of
peace, carrying goods and carrying much
more; creating friendships and render
ing Indispensable services to nil Interests
on this sldo of the water. They must
move constantly back and forth between
tho Americas. Thoy are tho only shuttles
thnt can weave tho delicate fahrlc ot
sympathy, comprehension, confidence and
mutunl dependence In which wo clotho
our policy of America ror Americans.
Ships Are Needed.
With a view to meeting these pressing
necessities of our commerce and availing
ourselves at tho earliest possible moment
of tho present unpurnlleled opportunity of
linking tno two Ainericns togeinor in
bonds of mutual Interest nnd service nn
opportunity which may never tvturn
again it wo miss It now, proposals will
bo made to tho present congress for the
purchaso or construction of ships to be
owned and directed by tho government
similar to thoio made to tho last con'
Kress, but modified In aotno essential par
ticulars. I recommend theso proposils
to you for your prompt ncceptanco with
the more confidence because every month
thnt has elnpsed since the former pro
nosals were mado has mado tho necessity
for such action more and mote mani
festly Imperative.
Question of Finance,
The plans for tho armed forces of tho
nntlon which I havo outlined, and for
tho general policy of adequate prepara
tlon for mobilization nnd defense, In
volve, of courso very largo additional ex
pendlturos of money expenditures which
will considerably exceed tho estimated
revenues of tho government. It Is mado
ray duty by law, whenover tho estimates
of expenditure exceed the estimates of
revenue to cnll tho nttentlon of tho con
grefs to tho fact and suggest any means
of meeting the deficiency that It may be
wise or possible for mo to suggest. 1 mn
ready to bellevo that It would be my duty
to do so in any case; and I feel particu
larly bound to speak ot tho matter when
It appears that tho deficiency will arise
directly out ot tho adoption by tno con
gross of measures which 1 myself urgo
It to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to
speale briefly of the present state of tho
treasury and of the llscal problems
which the next yenr will probably dls
close.
On tho thirtieth ot Juno last thero was
nn nvatlablo balance In tho general fund
of the treasury of 1104,170,105.7a. Tho to
tnl estimated receipts for tho year 1916,
on the assumption that the emorgonry
revenue measure passed by tho laBt con
gress will not bo oxtended boyond its
present limit, tho thlrty-llrst of Decem
ber, 1915, nnd that tho present duty of
one cent per pound on sugar will bo dis
continued after the first of Hay, 1916,
will bo J070.SS5,50O. Tho balance of June
last and those estimated revenues come,
therefore, to a grand total of n7i,K35.B05.78.
Thn total estimated disbursements for the
present fiscal year, Including I5,000,000
for tho Panama cannl, J12.000.MO for proh
ohlo deficiency appropriations and J50,
000 for miscellaneous debt redemptions,
will bo 1753,F91.000; and tho balance In the
general fund ot the treasury will bo re
duced to J20,C44,G05.78. Tho emergency
reven-'to net. if continued beyond Its pres
ent tlmo limitation, would produce, dur
ing the half year than romalnlng, about
forty-one millions. Tho duty of ono cont
per pound on sugar. If continued, would
produco during tho two months of the
fiscal year remaining nfter tho first of
May, about fifteen millions. These two
Bums, amounting togothor to 56,000,000,
If added to tho revenues of tho second
half of tho llscal yonr, would yield tho
treasury at tho end of tho year an avail
able balance of 176,641,605.78.
The additional rovunues required to
inrry out the program ot military anil
naval preparation of which I havo spok
en, would, as at present estimated, be
for tho llscal year 1917, 193.M0.O0O. Those
figures, taken with tho figures for tho
present fiscal year which I have already
given, disclose our financial problem for
tho year 1917,
How Bhall wo obtain tho new revenue?
It scorns to mo a clonr dictate of pro
dont statesmanship nnd frank finance
thut In what wo nro now, I hope, nbout
to undertake wo should pay as wo go.
Tho people of tho country are entitled to
know Just what burdens of taxation they
nrs to carry, and to know from the outset,
now. Tho new bills should bo paid by In
ternal taxation.
' To what sources, then, shnll we turn?
We would be following nn nlmost unl
versnl example of modern governments
It we were to draw the grcaler part or
even tho wholo of tho revenues wo need
from (he Income taxes, lly Bomewhnt
lowering the present limits of exemption
and tho figure at which tho surtax Bhall
begin to ho Imposed, nnd by Increasing,
step by step throughout the present grad
uation, tho surtax Itself, ths Income taxes
as at present apportioned would yield
sums sufllclent to balance tho books of
the treasury at tho end of the fiscal year
1917 without anywhere making the bur
den unreasonably, or oppressively heavy.
Tho precise reckonings aro fully and ac
curately set out In the report of the, sec
retnry of the treasury, which will be Im
mediately laid before you.
And there are many additional sources
many things that occur In a llfotlmo
which Jar or disturb us, which give a
different turn to our tastes and dispo
sition, which Introduce changing ola
rrfents nnd predilections Into tho prob
lems ot tho day and times ot the
preBont and. future can Mover bo tho
same na'fii tho long "ng6. Yet tho old
friends remain, possibly -not In the
same neighborhood or community,
nor In the samo part of tha country.
Hut ,tlio.y,t-aro ver within tho boun
daries ot ou 'spiritual vision and thoy
aro enshrined In tho sanctuary ot the
of revenue which can Justly he reported
to Vlthout hampering the Industries ot
the country or putting any too great
charge upon Individual expenditure. A
one per cent tax per, gallon on gasollns
and nsptha would yield, at the presont
esllmntcd production, 110,000,000; a tax of
to cents per horsepower on automobiles
and Internal explosion engines, 15.000,00et
a stamp tax on bank checks, probably
SlS.tflO.OCO: a tax of !i cents per ton on
pig Iron, J10.ooo.ooo; n tnx of to centa por
ton on fabricated Iron and steal, proba
bly 810,000.000. In a country of great In-
lustrles like this It ought to be easy to
distribute tho burdens of taxation with
out malting them anywhere bear too
heavily or too exclusively upon any ono
sot of persons or undertakings. What Is
clenr Is, thnt the Industry of this gener
ation should pay tho bills ot this genera
tion.
The Danger Within.
I have snokfn to you today, gentlemen.
upon a stnglo theme, the thorough prep
aration of tho natlor to cffo for Ita
own security nnd to mulct sure ot entire
freedom to piny tho Impartial rolo In this
hemlsnhera nnd In tho world which we
oil believe to have been providentially
neslgned to It. I have had In mind no
thought of any Immediate or particular
t'nnger arising out of our relations with
other nations. We nro ilt peaco with all
tho nations of tho world, and there Is
reason to hopo that no question In con
troversy between this and other govern
ments will lead to nny serious breach ot
nmlcablo relation, grave as somo differ
ences of attitude and policy havo been
nnd may yet turn out to be. I nm sorry
to say thnt the gravest threats against
our national penco nnd safety hnvo boen
uttered within our own borders. There nre
citizens of tho United States, I blush to
admit, born under other flags but welcomed
under our generous naturalization laws
to tho full freedom nnd opportunity of
America, who have poured the poison of
disloyalty Into the very arteries of our
national life; who havo sousnt to oring
thn authority and good name of our gov
ernment Into contempt, to destroy our In
dustries wherever they thought It effec
tive for their vindictive purposes to strike
nt them, nnd to debase our politics to the
uses of foreign Intrigue. Their numbor
Is not great ns compared with the whole
number of thoso sturdy hosts by which
our nation has been enriched In recent
generations out of vlrllo foreign stocks;
hut It Is grcnt enough to have brought
deep disgrace upon us and to have made
It necessary that wo Bhould promptly
make ubb of processes of law by which
wo may bo purged of their corrupt dis
tempers. America never witnessed nny
thing like this before. It never dreamed
It possible thnt men sworn Into Its own
citizenship, men drnwn out of great free
stocks such as supplied somo of tho host
nnd strongest elements of that little, but
how heroic, nation that In a high day of old
staked Its very llfo to free Itself from
every entanglement that had darkened
tho fortunes of the older nations nnd set
up a now standard here that men of such
origins and such free choices of allegi
unco would ever turn in malign reaction
ngnfnst tho government and people who
had wolcomed and nurtured them and
seek to make this proud country onco
moro n hotbed of ljuropean puBsion. A
little whllo ago such n thing would havo
seemed Incredible. Because It was In-
credlblo wo mndo no preparation for It
Wo would havo been almost ashamed to
prepare for It, an If we were suspicious
of ourselves, our own comrades and
neighbors! But the ugly nnd Incredible
has actually come about and we are with
out ndequato federal laws to deal with
It. I urgo you to enact euch laws nt
the earliest possible moment and feel that
In so doing I am urging you to do noth
ing loss than save tho honor and self-
uspect of the nation.
Must Be Crushed Out.
Buch creatures of passion, disloyalty
and anarchy must be crushed out. Thoy
aro not many, but they aro lnllnitely ma
llgnant, und tho hand of our power should
close over them nt once. They have
formed plots to destroy property, they
havo cnteied Into conspiracies against the
neutrality of the government, they have
sought to pry Into every confidential
transaction of tho government In order
to servo Interests nllen to our own. It la
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest tho terms
in which they may be dealt with.
I wish that It could be said that only n
few men, misled by mistaken sentiments
ot alleglanco to the governments under
which they were born, had been guilty of
disturbing tho self-possession nnd mliiep
resenting tho temper and principled of
the country during these days of terrlblo
war, wlion it would Beein thut every man
who wub truly an American would In
stinctively mako It his duty and his prldo
to keep tho scales of Judgment even and
provo himself a partisan of no nation but
Ills own. But It cannot. There are some
met; among us, and many resident abroad
who, though born nnd bred In tho Unit
cd Stntes and calling themselves Amer
icans, have so forgotten themselves and
their honor ns citizens as to put their
passlonato sympathy with one or the oth
er side In tho great European conflict
above their regard for tho peaco and dig
nlty of the United States. They also
preach nnd practice disloyalty. No law
I suppose, can rench corruptions of the
mind nnd heart; but I should not speak
of others without also speaking of these
and expressing tho even deeper humilia
tion and acorn which every Belf-possesaed
and thoughtfully patriotic American must
feel whon ho thinks of them and of tha
discredit thoy nre daily bringing upon ua.
Transportation Problem.
The transportation problem Ib nn ex
ceedingly serious nnd pressing ono In thlB
country. Thero bus from tlmo to time
of lato boon reason to fear thnt our rail
roads would not much longer bo ublc to
cope with It successfully us at present
equipped nnd co-ordinated I suggest
that it wuuld ho wise to provide for n
commission of Inquiry to ascertain by u
thorough canvass of tho wholo question
whether our luwa as at prekout frnmed
and administered aro as serviceable as
they might he In the solution of the prob
lem. It Is obviously a problem that lle
at tho very foundation of our eltlclency
as u people Filch an Inquiry ought to
drnw out every circumstance und opinion
worth considering und we need to know
nil sides of the inattur If we mean to
do anything In the field of fedornl leglsla.
Hon.
I'or whnt wo nro seeking now, what In
my mind Is th alnglo thought ot this
message, Is natlonnl efficiency and se
curity. Wo rorvo it great nntlon. We
should serve It In tho spirit of Its peculiar
genius. It Is tho genius of common men
for solf-govcrnmont, Industry, JUBtlre, lib

It lacks no Instrument, no facility or vigor
of law, to make It sumflent to play Its
part with energy, safety, and naaurod
success. In thl wo nre no partisans but
heralds and prophets of a new ago,

lonosomo In n crowd, and sometimes
should fool ns If wo had boon aban-'
doped, though, surrounded, by our own

DIPLOMATS WHO 'FALL DOWN'
Many Foreign Ministers Have Been
Recalled In Disgrace From the
United States.
In 1793 Washington asked tho
French cltlzons committee ot safety
to recall tho French minister, Citizen
