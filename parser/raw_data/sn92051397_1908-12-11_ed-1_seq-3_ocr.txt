The gun department of Winches
ter's, with the exception of thre or
four rooms, went onto a four-day
seheilni . yesterday. The following
statement Is made by those closely
connected with the factory:
"This Is due to the fact that the de
mand for tlie guns by the tohbers Is
not as great as usual, since they are
not keeping large, stocks on hand be
cause of the bard times which hae
not entirely Improved as yet.
"Through the hard time of the last
.(ear the factory has been running
practically full handed and It Is not
surprising that a slight recession has
come, when one considers the fact
that we have accumulated a large
slock,
c expect good business next year
and hope that, the reduction In th
work schedule In the gun shop will
I be of short duration."

Washington, Dee, 10. Numerous con
ferences were held at the capltol today
relating to President Roosevelt's mes
sage to congress and his recommenda
tions concerning I he sei ert service, In
which he used language which is ob
jected to by senators and representa
tives. The last of those conferences
was at the office of Speaker Cannon
and was attended by the speaker and
Senators Aldrich mid Hale.
It was practically dectded that a
resolution he Introduced In the house
tomorrow providing for the appoint
ment of a select committee to consider
the recommendations made for a re
storation of the law regarding the se
cret service and to take account of the
expressions In the message which were
offensive to niemhcrs of the congress. A
resolution has already been prepared
and Is In the custody of Reprsentattve
Perkins of New York who according to
the present understanding will Intro
duce It In the house tomorrow.
As originally drafted, the resolution
contained a preamble which reeltd the
language used by the President and de
clared l( an unnecessary condemnation
of the course taken by members of con
gress in confining the activities of the
secret service to the detection of coun
terfeiilng and to the protection of the
President of the T'nlted States. At sev
eral of the conferences, however It was
thought best to make the resolution as
general as possible. It Is thought like
ly therefore, that when the resolution
Is presented the preamble will have
been eliminated. It Is understood that
the committee to be appointed If the
resolution Is adopted will consist of
members of the highest standing and
that Representative Perkins will he the
chairman.
Indications point to non-action by the
senate on the message until after the
house's special commission has had the
opportunity to Investigate the entire
matter. A number of democratic sen
ators have Informally considered the
language used by the President and as
a result Senator Culberson, the minor
ity leader, consulted with Senator Hale,
the new republican leader, today. Sen
ator Culberson took the position that
the message could not bn Ignored and
suggested that the portion relating to
the secret service be referred to the
senate committee on appropriations for
an Investigation of the operation of the
amendment concerning the secret ser
vice, which was made by the sundry
civil bill last year. He proposed also
that this committee consider the rec
ommendation of the President looking
to the restoration of the old law. It
was his opinion that such action would
carry with It an Investigation of the
language used by the President al
though It wa.s not his Intention that
any resolution to be offered should re
fer specifically to that language.
The democratic senators favor action
by the republican, hut It was Intimat
ed that If the majority party Is Inclin
ed to Ignore the matter a resolution
will come from the democratic side of
the chamber. At the same time they
expressed the opinion that the subject
should not be made one of party con
troversy and sehowed a disposition not
to debate any proposition which might
be advanced frm the republican side.
'At a conference held during the day
nl the senaie end of the capital, a
number of republican senators were
present who have always hee-j ready
to defend any criticism made of the
President. They announced their decid
ed opposition to suggestions which had
been made that all that, part of the
President's message which has given
offense should be expunged from (he
record. At the same time (hey an
nounced they would not oppose any re
solution providing for an Investigation
by (lie appropriations committee of the
amendment adopted last year.
