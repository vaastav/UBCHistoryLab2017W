Huge Combine of

Moie Industry Planned to

l'uMic Interest.
. New York, Dec. 8. A dramatic
nt the talc unwound on the cellu
loid rihlxmi tlrmclvt. is a gigantic
plan now being developed in the mo
tion picture industry of the I'nited
Mate, as uncovered today by the
New York World.
The romolete reorganization of the
National Association of the Motion
Picture Industry, the official organ
isation embracing jir2::ically every
maker and producer and distributor
of films in this vast business and the
proposed if nut already tendered in
vitation t Will It. Hays, postmaster
general, to become general chair
man of the new board at a salary of
not less than $10MH)0 a year are
me two vital moves now under way.
Drastic Action Needed.
Adolph Zukor, president of .lie
Famous Players-Lasky corporation,
and. the most powerful official in
motion picture production in Anier
ica, admitted last nnht that such a
plan was contemplated.
lhere is nothing much 1 can
say," he sa:d. "There is such a plan
on toot (a reorganization) but we
have four or rive men in mind to
invite to head it and we have de
cided nothing definitely yet."
For months, the newspaper 'says,
leaders in the motion picture world
have realized that drastic action
alone would win back an indifferent
and deserting public and prevent
what is considered a fatal federal
censorship. They have decided that
the most essental thing to the pros
perity, if not the existence of the
industry is to have a man of national
repute at the helm one who can im
press upon the ppublic the leaders'
desire for the producVon of picturs
of unassailable quality.
"I know nothing about it," said
William A. Brady, present executive
of the national association. "There
lias been talk of such a thing for
ome time, but nothing creative has
come of it."
Interstate Body I lopes
For Lower Rail Rates
Washington, Dec. 8. Hope is ex
pressed by the Interstate Commerce
commission in its annual report to
day to congress that a "substantially
lower" level of railroad rates and
fares would be possible with an ex
ception in the volume of traffic fol
lowing the present business depres-
S'on ana witn a iinincr aajusimvui

prevailing tendencies.
Freight rates, following war-lime
increases and some later readjust
ments, have not yet reached an
equilibrium, the commission says,
because the ciiicf factors controling
them, "the value of service and the
cost of transportation still are in a
state of flux."
The commission's report is for the
vear ended last October 31. It dis
closes that a total of $430,000,000 has
been ordered paid to the railroads
under the government guarantee
against losses during the first six
months after their return to private
ownership and that there is still due.

KatmoJ tram Yntar !.)
The Fortune Hunter thrust the ill
back into the drawer and locked the
door, without another glance, then
be rroed the room, and pulled
down the window, shutting out the
night and the winding road.
"I will not go, I will may!" be
tolj himself fiercely. "Jihe loves
me and because she love me things
will have to come right,"
I'm when the Fortune Hunter
at last fell asleep, it wa to dream
that he was walking miles and miles
through a dark wood, searching hope
les.sly for Anne; sometimes lie could
hear her voire, but always it got
fa'nter and further away, and he
woke shaking and trembling like a
woman, to find the daylight pour
ing into his room.
A dream thank God, only a
dream! He dressed hurriedly and
went down into the garden. Out
in the air he always felt better and
more able to cope with things, but,
as he was crossing the lawn, some
one called his name, and turning, he
saw Anne following him from the
house.
She looked prettier and happ'cr
than he had ever seen her. and she
was simply dressed in a short dark
skirt and a white blouse and made
her look very young.
"1 meant to be up before vou,'
she said, slipping, her hand tnrcugh
his arm. She raised her dark eyes
to his face. "Is it all right still?"
she asked, flushum a little.
"Everything's always all right if
you love me," he answered. They
went down to the river and walked
along the grassy bank,
"And what shall we do today?"
Anne asked suddenly. Do you
know. I feel as if for the last two
days I've lost you somehow and
that last night I found you again."
But even as she spoke, against
her will, she thought of the letter
Tommy had put into her hands, and
a little tremble shook her,
The Fortune Hunter glanced down
in swift concern. "You're not cold?"
"No." She laughed and shook her
head. "Someone walked over my
grave.
He frowned, but made no answer,
and they walked on silently, but the
new quiet happiness with which she
bad awakened that morning was al
ready shadowed by the unwillm
memory of that other girl.
She turned desperately to her old
excuse there was some explanation
no man could so deliberately deceive
the woman who loved him I She
would go on trusting him, no mat
ter what happened, and some day
perhaps it would come right.
But when she spoke again the
life seemed to have gone out of her
voice. "We ought to turn it must
be breakfast time."
The Fortune Hunter glanced swift
ly down at her grave face.
Last night she had said that every
thing was all right she had said the
with ! same th ng again this morning, but
the rortune Hunter knew she was
only deceiving herself, and that noth
ing could ever be right for either
of them again.
Mr. Harding was already at the
breakfast table when Anne and the
Fortune Hunter entered the room.
He looked up from some papers he
was reading with rather a preoccu
pied smile.
"Morning, my dear morning John
there s a letter tor you
Democratic Seuator Raps
Republican Leadership
Washington. Dec. 8. The repub
lican party's leadership was assaiicd
in a speech in the senate yesterday
by Senator Harrison, democrat, Mis
sissippi, who declared President
Harding was doing the very things
for which he, as a senator, had de
nounced, President Wilson." The
president's message, he added, con
stituted an appeal to partisanship
and warning to republicans to disa
vow their allegiance to "bloc' or
ganization. Mr. Harrison attacked the senate
leaders, saying they had 'shifted and
hopped until none of us know where
or when or why." Secretary Mel
lon also was" denounced as seeking,
in his annual report, to "help along"
the ideas of President Harding with
respect to "relieving the rich of
heavy taxation." ,
Filipino Solons Aroused
By Wood-Forbes Report
Man:ta, Dev. S. The Filipino
colons are aroused by the statement
in the Wood-Forbes report that the
Philippine National bank story con
stitutes one of the darkest pages in
the history of the Philippines and
they are planning a sensational in
vestigation of the bank and all of its
branches. The investigation of the
closing of the Shanghai branch of
the bank is already progressing and
it is to be extended if the resolution
prepared for presentation to the sen
ate passes, which it is expected to do.
The Wood-Forbes mission cited a
loss of about 45,000.000 pesos
($22,500,000) and the senate, com
mittee will investigate "for the pur
pose of determining the vcr.-.city of
the report."

egram. Quoting the Bible as his
authoritv, Frank Maddox of this city
admitted allegations made by his son.

tortured him by jerking a rope tied
on his son's thumbs.,
The testimony of Elmer was sub

that the thumb jerking disciplinary

Fugitive Surrenders
San Pedro. Cat. Dec. 8. Oscar
Thompson, for whom the police
have been searching since Monday
when Mrs. Thompson ant
tier sister Mrs. Fred Howard,
were shot and fatally wounded,
pave himself op to the police ncre
bt night.
"For me!" The Fortune Hunter
caught the letter up sharply, his face
tlushmg. lhere was only one per
son who was m the least likely to
write to him, he knew, and that was
lrcnie Claver. He supposed it was
an acknowledgement of his check,
but the writing on the envelope was
not hers. v
He had laid it down beside his
plate, face downwards, and took his
seat.
".Read it if vou care to, John,
Anne said lightly. "We're not at all
formal here, (ire we, uncle?"
"There's no hurry; it will wait
it's only a business letter."
The Fortune Hunter answered
hurricdlv ; he felt confused, without
know ng why. Anne flushed faintly.
"Oh, well, if it's only a business
letter," she said quietly. .
Jealousy was waking again in her
heart this letter was from a worn;
an, she was sure, else why could not
lohn read it in the ordinary way in
stead of looking so embarrassed?
"Tommy late this morning?" the
Fortune Hunter asked with an ef
fort. He knew quite well what Anne
was thinking, and realized that he
had made another blunder by not
immediately opening the letter and
reading its contents. -(
"Tommy nearly always is late.
Mr. Harding said absently. "1 am
afraid wc have spoiled him, my
dear."
The Fortune Hunter glanced
quickly at 'Anne and saw the set
folds of her pretty mouth and the
flush on her checks and be realized
with despair that the bridge of kisses
they had built last tvght was al
ready tottering to a fall. .
He-took up the letter lying beside
his plate and slit open the envelope
recklessly.
Its contents were brief and type
written, and sent from the head of
fice of a London bank:
"Dear Sir We have today receiv
ed a draft from the Bank of Austra
lia, Sydney, placing to your credit
the stmt of 30.000 pounds with the
request that we immediately notify
vou at Cherry Lodg-, Somerton-ou-Thames."
We await your instructions
on the matter. Assuring you of our
best attention, we are Yours faith
fully . . ." ...
The Fortune Hunter sat like a
man turned to stone; he was nailed
to his lies now at all events; this
was surely that last step along the
pathway of deceit.
He forgot that Anne was watch
ing him as he sat there, his break
fast untouched, staring before him
with strained eyes.
Thirty thousand pounds? It was
impossible. How could he do this
thing?
"Good news. John?" Anne asked
with an effort and her lips trembled
in spite of her efforts to keep them
steady.
The Fortune Hunter turned with
a start, -crushing the letter into his
pocket.
"A business letter, that's all, noth
ing very interesting.
lie tried to turn the conversation.
"What are we to do today? I thought
there was to be some wonderful
proeram? It's going to be splen
didly fine, too." j
She knew it was a deliberate at- j
i moment she could not trust her.
self to speak.
Why had she ever gone bn to
him lat nichl? No doubt lie had
taken her kie l"d fond words
with a covert smile, blie had no faith
left in him he was not worth loving
. . , so the wild thoughts crowd
ed over one another in hrr mind, un
til suddenly she suet his eyes, and
felt ashamed.
"Shall we go for a long walk?
I haven't shown you half the places
round here yet but I forgot! You're
not a good walker?
The Fortune Hunter laughed.
"Not a good walkerf Why, I've
spent half my life tramping the
world. 1 " He checked himself
hurriedly, conscious of a subtle
thange in her face.
"I thought alter you hurt )our
leg" she said uncertainly.
There was a poignant silence,
which Mr. Harding broke by push
ing back his chair and rising.
Vou'll. excuse me. my Hear. I've
letters to write." He bustled out of
the room and the Fortune Hunter
s,rose and went to stand behind
Anne's chair, his hands on her shoul
ders. ...
"It is I who feel now that I have
lost you again since liut night," he
said hoarsly.
She sat quite still, her head a little
downbent, her hands clapped in her
lap; then suddenly she broke out in
passionate despair.
"Oh, I'm jealous jealous; It's
just as if you shut me out of your
life as if I were a child, only to be
kissed and petted, but never to bt
told anything. . . .1 thought it was
going to be so different. . . .1 thought
we were going to be everything to
each other I thought after all I had
suffered the years I waited for
you.
Anne, for God's sake"
She half turned in her chair and
looked up at him and for a momctr.
she was shocked into silence by the
suffering in his face; then she
stretched out her band and laid it
on his arm.
"John, oh, John. . . what is it?"
The Fortune Hunter thrust a band
into his coat pocket and took out
the crumpled letter.
"If you're' hurt because I didn't
show you this read it! I suppose
you thought it was from a woman.
I suppose you thought I was lying
to vou and deceiving you again"
The hard bitterness of his voice
goaded her beyond endurance, she
pushed the letter away.
"I don't want to read it; T don't
care if it was from a woman. You
lied to me once about that photo
graphyou've never tried to explain
or tell me who she was Oh,
I wish I wish you'd never come
home!"
She warded him off with trembling
hands when he would have touched
her she ran past him and out of the
room.
