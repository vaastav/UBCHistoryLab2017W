WitstiiNOTOM, Dec. 7. Tho following Is a
summary of President Cleveland's messago to
congress. Of nrluirs In Turkoy tho president
says:
Affairs lu Turkey.
At tho outset of a reference) to tho more Important
matters ulTcctlng our relations with
foreign powers, It would afford mo satisfaction
if I could assure tha congress that the
disturbed condition In Aslntlc Turkey had
during the past year nssuraod a less hideous
and bloody uxpect, and that cither as a
of tho awahenlne of tho Turkish government
to tho demands of humane civilization,
or as tho result of deolstve action on tho
part of tho great nations having tho right by
treaty to lutctfero for tho protection of those
exposed to tho rngo of mad bigotry nnd cruel
fanaticism, tho shocking features of tho
had been mitigated.
Wbllo nono of our citizens in Turkoy have
thus far been ktllod or wounded, though often
in tho midst of dreadful scenes of danger,
their safety in the futuro is by no means assured.
Our government at homo und our
at Constantinople hao loft nothing undone
to protect our missionaries In Ottoman
territory, who constitute nearly all the Individuals
residing thoro who have a right to
claim our protection on the scoro of Amercan
citizenship.
Several naval vessels aro stationed In tho
Mediterranean as n measure of caution and to
furnish all posstblo rollof and rcfugo in caso
of etnorgency.
Wo Into mado claims against tho Turkish
goornmont for tho plllaga und destruction of
missionary property nt llarpoot and Marash
during uprisings ut thoso places -Thus far
tho validity of thoso demands has not been
admitted, though our minister, prior to nuoli
outrages and in anticipation of danger, demanded
protection for tho person nnd property
of our missionary cttUcns In tho localities mentioned
und notwithstanding that strong
exists of actual complicity of Turkish
soldtors In tho work of destruction and robbery.
Insurrection In Culm.
Iho Insurrection in Cuba still contlnuos
with nil Its porploxlttcs. It U difficult to
that any progress hut thus far been
mado towards tho piclllcatlon of tho Island
or that tho situation of affairs as depleted in
my last nnnual mossngo has In tho least improved,
If fepnln still holds Havana and tho
seaports and nil tho considerable towns, tho
Insurgents still roam nt will over nt least
two-thirds ol tho lnlind country. If ths determination
of Spiln to put down tho Insurrection
scums but to strengthen with tho
lupjo of tlmo and Is evidenced by lior
dovotlon of largely incrensod military
and naval forces to tho tnslc. Micro Is much
reason to boliavo that tho Insurgents hnvo
gained In point of numbers, and character, and
resources, nnd aro nono tho loss Infloxtblo In
their resolvo not to succumb without practic
ally securing the great objects for which thoy
took up arms. If Spain has not yot re-established
hor authority, nelthor havo tho Insurgents
vet mido good tholr lltlo to bo re
garded
A nn Jntlrponilont State.
Indeed, ns tho contest has gono on, tho
tint civil government oxlsta on tho
Island, except so fur as Spain is nblo to maintain
It, has been practically abandoned.
Spain doos kcop on foot huch n government,
moro or low Imperfectly, In tlo largo towns
und their immcdlato suburbs. Hut, that exception
being mail), tho cntiro country Is
either given over to anarchy or is subject to
tho military occupation of ono or tho other
pirty, It Is reported. Indeed, on reliable authority
that, at tho demand of tho
of tho Insurgent army, tho
l'lltntlvo Ciibmi Uovoriiineiit
has now rltcnupnll attempt to oxerclso its
functions leaving that government confessedly
(what thiro Is tho best reason for supposing
it always to havo been In fact) a government
raorcly on pa par.
Our actual pccunlnry Interest in it is second
only to that of tho pooplo nnd government of
Spain. It Is reasonably estimated that at
least 530,000,0:0 to KO.COO.OCO of Amerlopn capital
uro Invested in plantations und In railroad,
mining and other businoss enterprises
on tho iHlnnd, Tho volumo of trad a between
tho United States nnd Cuba, which In 1889
amounted to about fCl,CCO,000, roio In 1893 to
nbout JIC3,0C0,C00, nnd In 1691, tho year boforo
tho present Insurrection broko out, amount-to
nearly S 00,000.000, Besides this largo pecuniary
stako In tho fortunes of Cubn, tho
United States llnds ltsolf Inextricably Involved
In tho present contest In othor ways
both vexatious and costly.
Many Cubans rosldo in this country and indirectly
promoto tha Insurrection through tho
press by public meetings, by tho purohnsonnd
shipment of nrms, by the raising of funds
nnd by other means, which tho spirit of our
institutions nnd tho tenor of
Our Ivs Do Not lVrralt
To bo mado tho subjcot of criminal prosecutions.
'
Somo of them, though Cubans nt heart and
in all their feelings nnd interests, havo taken
out pnpers ns naturalized citizens of tho United
Stntes, a proceeding resorted to with a
vlow to possiblo protection by this government,
and not unnaturally regarded with
much Indignation by tho country of tholr
origin. Tho Insurgents nro undoubtedly encouraged
nnd supported by tho widespread
sympathy tho pcoplo of this country always
and Instlncttvoly feel for ovory strugglo for
bottor nnd freer government, and which, In
tho caso of tho moro odventorous and restless
clemonts of our populntlon, leuds In only too
many Instances to uctlvound personal participation
In thd contest.
Tho result Is thnt this government Is constantly
called uron to protect American citizens,
to claim damages for Injuries to persons
nnd proncrty, now estimated nt many millions
of dollars, and to nslc explanations and apologies
for tho nets of Spanish officials, whoso
zeal for tho roprosslon of robolllon sometimes
blinds thorn to tho Immunities belonging
to tho unoffending citizens
of a friendly power. It follows from the same
causes that tho United Stntes is compollcd to
actively pallco a long lino of sea coa3t against
Unlawful' Expeditions,
Tho cscapo of which tho utmost vigilanco will
not always sufflco to prevent.
These Inovltablo entanglements of tho
United States, with tho robelllon In Cuba, tho
largo American property interests affected,
nnd considerations of philanthropy and humanity
in gonoral, havo led to a vohomont
in vnrlous quarters, for somo sort of
positive In'.orvontlon on tho part of tho United
Statos.
8pnln Should Offer Autonomy.
It would seem that if Spain should offer to
Cuba gcnulno autonomy a monsuro bf homo
rulo which, whllo preserving tho sovereignty
of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements
of hor Spanish subjects thero would
bo no just reason why the pacification of tho
Island might not bo effected on that basis.
Such n result would appear to be In the truo
Interest of all concerned. It would at once

to theso waters to study the habits

Life Having Service.
From tbo llfo saving servlee tt la reported
that tho number of disasters to documented
vessels within the limits of its operations
during tho year woa 437. These vessels had
on board -1,003 persons, of whom 4,!03 were
saved and 13 lost. Tho valuo of such vessels
Is estimated at 18,880, M0 and of thetrcargoes
73,840,380, making tho total valuo of property
Imperiled ?12,7J0,5M Of this amount
wrrs saved and 11,432,750 was lost. Sixty-seven

There woro besides 243 casualties to small undocumented
craft, on board of which there
woro 691 porsons, of whom 687 were saved and
7 woro lost.
Our Army.
Tho roport of tho secretary of war exhibits
satisfactory conditions in the several branches
of tho public service Intrusted to his
chnrgo. Tho limit of our military force, as
fixod by law, Is constantly and readily maintained.
Tho present discipline and morals of
our army aro excellent, nnd marked progress
and efficiency aro apparont throughout its
organization.
With tho oxcoptlon of dellcato duties in the
suppression of slight Indian disturbances
along our southwestern boundary, in whloh
tho Moxlcan troops and tho compulsory
but peaceful return, with the consent
of Groat llrltain, of u band of Croo Indians
from Montana to tbo Drltlsh
possesslous, no nctlvo operations have been
required of tho army during tho yoar past.
During tho past year tho work of constructing
pormanont infantry and cavalry posts has
been continued at tho places herotoforo designated.
The secretary of war, ropoats his recommendation,
that appropriations for barracks
nnd qunrtors sbould more strictly conform
to tho noeds of tho servlco ns judged by
tho dcpar.'mont rather than respond to tho
wishes nnd Importunities of localities.
Erection and Armament of Fortification.
Dm ing tho past year rapid progress has
been mado toward tho completion of tho
schemo adopted for tho ereotlon and armament
of fortifications along our sea coast,

In all 418 guns and mortars. During the

statements
whero mado concerning tho government's receipts
and expenditures for tho purposo of
venturing upon somo suggestions touching
our present tariff law and Its operation J
This statuto took effect on tho 28th day of
August, 1891. Whatever may bo its shortcomings
as a completo mcasuro of tariff
It must be conceded that It has opened
the way to a freer and greater oxchango of
commodities botweon us and other countries,
and thus furnished a wider markot for our
products and manufactures.
The only 'cntiro fiscal year durln? which
this law has been In forco ended on tho 30th
day of June, 1890. In that year our Imports
increased over thoso of the previous yoar
more than 10,500,000, while tho valuo of tho domestic
products wo oxported and which found
markets abroad, was nearly $70,000,030 moro
than during the preceding year.
Thoso who insist that the cost to our people
of articles coining to them from abroad for
their needful use should only bo increased
through tariff charges to an extent necessary
to meet the expenses of the government, as
well as thoso who claim that tariff charges
may bo laid upon such articles beyond tho necessities
of government revenuo, and with the
additional purpose of so Increasing their prlco
in our markets ns to glvo American manufacturers
and producers better and moro profitable
opportunities, must agree that our tariff
laws are primarily Justified as sources of rev-onus
to onablo tho government to meet the
necessary expenses of Its maintenance. Considered
as to its sufficiency in this aspect the
present law can by no means fall under Just
condemnation.
I bolleve our present tariff law, if allowed n
fair opportunity, will in the near future yield
a revenue, which, with reasonably economical
expenditures, will overcomo nil deficiencies.
The Deficit Nord Not Disturb Us.
In tho moantlme no deficit that has occurred
or may occur noed cxclto or disturb
us.
To meet any such deficit we havo in the)
treasury, in addition to n gold rescrvo of ono
hundred millions, a surplus of moro than ono
hundred and millions of dollars
appllcablo to tho payment of tho expenses of
tho government, and which must, unless
for that purpose, remain a unless
hoard, or, if not extravagantly wasted, must
In any ovont be perverted from the purposo of
its exaction from our people.
Monetary Iteform.
1 am more convinced than over that wo cat
have no assurod financial pcaco and safety
until tho govornmont currency obligations
upon which gold may bo demanded from tho
treasury are withdrawn from circulation and
cancelled. This might bo dono. as has been
heretofore recommended, by tholr exchange
for long-term, bonds bearing a low rato of Interest
or by their redemption with tho proceeds
of such, bonds.
Even If tho United States notes known as
greenbacks were thus rollred, It la probably
that the troasury notes Issued In payment of
silver purchasos under tho net of July 14, 1890,
now paid in gold when demanded, would not
crcato much disturbances, as they might,
from tlmo to tlmo, when received In tho treasury
by redemption in gold or otherwise, be
gradually and prudently roplaced by silver
cola
This plan of issuing bonds for tho purposo
of redemption certainly appears to bo tbo most
eflectlvo nnd direct path to tho needed reform.
In default of this, howovcr, it would bo a step
in tbo right direction if currency obligations
redeemable In cold, whenever so redeemed,
sbould be cancelled Instead of being re-Issued.
This operation would bo a slow remedy, but it
would improvo present conditions.
National banks Bhould redeem tholr own
notes. They sbould bo allowed to issue circulation
to the par valuo of bonds deposited as
security for its redemption and tho tax on
their circulation sbould bo reduood to one-fourth
of one per cent
Judoes havo often very knotty
points to decide. In a recent caso an
immenso amount of argument was expended
over tho question whether a
tooth, after being drawn, is tho prop-
'erty of the dentist or his vintim.
