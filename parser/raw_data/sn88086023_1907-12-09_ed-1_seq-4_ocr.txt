Our school system is grave-
ly defect ve in so far as It puts
& premium upon mere literary
training anil tends therefore to
train the boy away from the
farm and the workshop. Noth-
lug is more needed tban the
best type of Industrial school,
the school for mechanical in-
dustrles in the city, the school
for practically teaching agrl-
culture In the country. The
calling of the skilled to ler of
the soil, the call.ng of the skill-
ed mechanic, should alike be
recognized as professions, Just
as emphatically as the callings
of lawyer, doctor, merchant or
clerk. The schools should rec-
ognize this fact and It should
equally be recognized In pop-
ular opinion. President
Roosevelt, in Message to- Con-
gress.
SETTLERS WHO SETTLE.
Hood River boasts that this year
through the eolon st rates on the
Harriman lines, a large number of"
actual settlers with large capital
came to that vicinity. They have
bought high priced land. built
dwellings costing from 13000 to I",
Ou each and have settled In the dis
trict adjacent to Hood River to be
come permanent residents.
This Is a direct result of Hood
R ver's extensive advertising. She
has aJvertised, not alone with words,
but with products, and most felici
tous results have followed. She is
receiving in return not only capital
to arge quantities, but what la far
better, she is receiving a solid and
permanent citizenship which will
help develop her resources and solve
the knotty problems.
Oregon has been greatly benefited
this year, especially, through the
Harriman lines. Thousands of sub-
atantlal settlers who will settle, have
been brought to the state through the
persistent advertising of the railroad.
It has dope far more than its share
t help supply capital and settlers
for the state.
Another year Pendleton should
make an effort to secure more of
this substantial class of settlers. She
has the inducements to offer if she
will only make a proper showing
among dissatisfied and discontented
people of the crowded eastern cit
ies. The financial flurry Is going to
bring thousands of good people west
ward. They will be anxious to In
est their money In land, an Inde
structible asset and resource, and it
is said even now by people who have
recently returned from the east that
many capitalists who have depend
ed on loans and banking for an in
come are seriously considering west
ern land investments.
If Pendleton and Umatilla county
can make a creditable showing thee
is no reason why many substant'al
Investors cannot be Induced to come
here. Hood River has set a pact,
but Umatilla county, having a large
Irrigated area now ready for settle
ment can lead her little red apple sister.
rOKTLAXIVS AWAKENING.
The rich, red blood of modern
thought is slowly creeping !i to the
sluggish veins of Portland, ;f the ac
tion of the Portland city council on
a m-m'cipal lighting plant !s any in
diiatien. Tired of being the playth'ng of a
corporation, tired of paying out
twice or three limes the actual cost
of street lighting every year, the
city council has at last received a
mental tip that a municipal plant
would save the taxpayers many
thousands of dollars and beside would
furnish better lights.
So Portland may become modern
ized before long. Where she Is pay
ing over J 100,000 a year for a poor
street light service, with this amount
constantly mounting upward, she
will be able with a municipal plant
to furnish double the number of
bright lights for the same money.
It Is said that the electric lights
!n the suburbs of Portland are so
d m that reading by them !s almost
impossible. This is caused by the
oifctrlc companv furnlsr.ing 1m3 volt
age than their l?-eement calls for.
Instead -t furnishing 110 or 120 volt
age, or the amount they are supposed
to furnish, they are simply stealing
the Juice from the wires and sell
ing it twice. The people are paying
for something which they do not re
ce ve. They are being "short
weighted" on their electric light sup
ply. They are being buncoed by the
corporation.
This form of commercial plunder
ing is no less reprehensible than
"short changing" or "short weight
ing" people over the counter. It is
simply stealing. While it is d 'fficult
to detect the theft of the electric
Juke .from the wires, yet people who
pay the bills and put up. with dim,
miserable lights, know full well that
they are being victimized.
EASY VI ILK.
I've traveled round this world a bit,
an' I am go n' still;
I'm tryln' hard to find a place that
some call "Easyvllle."
They tell me folks don't have to
work, and care Is never found,
That all they do In "Easyvllle" Is
Just to loaf around..
They have enough to eat and wear,
an' sleep Just all they please,
An pick the choicest fruits of life
right off the hangin' trees;
.Vow, do you wonder I have tramped
these years o'er dale an' hill
To find the everlastln' Joy an' rest
of "Easy vllle?"
I ask my brother from the North,
"How looks it over there?
Hast ever looked on "Easyvllle?"
Hast seen It anywhere?"
He shakes his head; my brother from
the east an west the same.
An' yet they cast a hungry look
whene'er I speak the name.
O "Easyvllle," so I am told, lays Jest
beyond the chain
Of mountains called "Ambition,"
"Push." an' "Toil" an' "Stress"
an' "Strain;"
An' I have looked these many years,
an' I am lookln' still,
An' mebbe when I git to God He'll
Bhow me "Easyvllle."

WOMAN'S INFLUENCE.
.MR. GEEK'S M LEMMA.
In one breath the Portland Ore
Ionian announces with favorable
comment the candidacy of T. T.
Geer of this c ty for congress and
in tlie next breath the Oregonian,
through its cartoonist, brands Mr.
Geer as a miscellaneous candidate,
seeking all the offices from the Uni
ted States senate to collector of cus
toms, but like the old maid, willing
to take, "O, Lord, anybody."
From the Oregonlan's peculiar
mixture of Independence it will leave
Mr. Geer's friends In doubt as to
whether he will be warmly support
ed or sarcastically ridiculed, in the
campaign.
Come out of It, Brother Geer. Let
them take the whole batch of off!-
In the recent city election held in
Pullman, Wash., In which the ques
tion of open or closed town was the
Issue, the women and the children,
200 strong, formed in a parade
through the principal streets and
urged the voters to vote the dry
ticket in protection of their schools
and homes, with the result that the
town went "dry" by a large majority.
This is a most emphatic demon.
stratlon of woman's power in politics
If she will but use It for the best
There is no town in the west that
could not be made dry under the
same influence If the women and
children would exercise their pre
rogative and speak in their own be
half.
In the south this method has been
one of the chief factors in carrying
Georgia and Alabama for prohibi
tion. Women went by hundreds to
the state house and urged the mem
bers to vote for their homes and chil
dren with the result that the pro
hibition vote was almost unanimous.
Thus without a vote woman is a
power In the land. Consider how
much greater this power would be
if she had the ballot
STATE FUND SAVED.
By the persistent and aggressive
efforts of Governor Chamberlain,
seconded by Attorney General Craw
ford, the state of Oregon will save
the funds which were on deposit In
the defunct bank of the Title Guar
antee and Trust company, amount
ing to over $400,000.
The state of Oregon owes the re
covery of this fund directly to the
foresight of Governor Chamberlain,
who exacted an additional bond from
State Treasurer Steele only a short
time ago. Had the governor not
taken this step, which was criticised
by the partisan press at the time,
the bond of the state treasurer would
not have been sufficient to .cover the
loss and the state could not have re
covered the amount of funds on de
posit In the defunct bank.
The American Surety company, In
which company State Treasurer
Steele was bonded, has made a sat
isfactory settlement with the state,
after action was urged by the gover
nor and Mr. Steele's bond with that
compnny has been cancelled.
This Is a straight tip to the tax
payett. that a mighty good bond
should be required from all public
servants who handle public funds.
WHICH WAS THE WISER?
Two men tolled side by side, from
sun to sun.
And both were poor;
Both sat with children, when the day
was done.
About their door.
.it -
One saw the beautiful ln crimson
cloud
And shining moon;
The other, with his head in sadness
bowed.
Made night of noon.
One loved each tree and flower and
singing bird
On mount or plain;
No music in the soul of one was stir
red By leaf or rain.
One saw the good In every fellow
man.
And hoped the best;
The other marveled at his Master's
plan
and doubt confessed.
One, having heaven above and Jieaven
below.
Was satisfied;
The other, discontent, lived on in woe
And hopeless died.

THE FOREST VANDALS.
Any fool can destroy a tree, but it
takes Mother Na'ture a century or
more to make one. The famous
temple of Diana at Ephesus, costing
untold millions and one of the won

the papers."
Those that fell trees seldom plant
them. During a man's life onlv
saplings can be grown to take the
place of centuries old trees that have
been destroyed. It took more than
3000 years to make some of the
trees In the western woods and to
build up the noble primeval forests
which the greedy sawmill men ru'n.

Nature preserves the trees for
centuries, saving them from drought

If we kill off all the fools we might

COURTEOUS TREATMENT.
A Chicago woman, while a pas
senger on a street car, had a trans
fer tickets Jostled from her hand
through the crowded condition of the
car. Several of the passengers sup
ported the statement as to the loss of
the ticket, but the conductor never
theless forced her to leave the car
and used no very polite language In
doing so.
She sued the company for $1250
and the supreme court sustains the
contention of her attorneys that pas
sengers can recover damages for In
sults as well as the actual cash loss
the company having contended that
the most it could be required to pay
was the 5 cents Involved In the loss
of the ticket. "Passengers of a pub
lic carrier are entitled to courteous
treatment.' said the supreme court,
"and it is the duty of the company to
see that its employes give this sort
of treatment to passengers."

4TT ADVERTISING is not a magic art. All it is, in
putting into print effective selling arguments a good
salesman would use orally. Write those arguments in an
attractive style bring out the merits of a proposition so
that the other fellow feels an instinctive desire to possess
it tell him why he should buy it and then finally satisfy
him that the price is right.
To get the best results, cater to the largest number yon
can reach among those who make good wages and live well
people who can afford to buy what you have to sell.
The East Oregonian's readers are composed of that class
who willingly pay G5 cents a month for it in preference to
buying the cheaper papers. Xet result they are people
who can afford to buy what you have to sell.
They are not penurious.
They are not paupers.
