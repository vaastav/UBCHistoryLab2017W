neous Washlucton Mutters
WASHINGTON Dec 2 One of the
first measures of natural interest
which will be introduced in the senate
at the session which begins today will
bo a resolution looking to public
action concerning the death of Presi
dent McKinley This will be present
ed on Tuesday either by Senator For
aker or by Senator Hanna probably
the former and after its introduction
the senate will adjourn as a mark of
respect to the memory ot the dead
president
The annual message of President
Roosevelt will not be received until
Tuesday and on this account the ses
sion today will -be exceedingly brief
It i3 not now expected that anything
will be done beyond the announce
ment of the death of Senator Kyle
following which the senate in accord
ance with custom will adjourn for the
day On Tuesday the presidents
message will be read and after its
reading the announcement of the
death of President McKinley will fol
low at once whereupon under the
precedent established when Presidents
Lincoln and Garfield died resolutions
providing for the appointment of a
committee to act with a similar com
mittee of the house of representatives
to take appropriate action relative to
the matter and then calling for im
mediate adjournment for the day will
be adopted Heretofore committees
have been appointed to arrange the
details of public exercises and it is
understood that plan will be pursued
in this instance and that later in the
session some public man of distinction
will be invited to deliver a eulogy in
the capitol
Wednesday and Thursday will be
devoted to the introduction of new
bills and as usual there will be a
flood of them Among the first bills
of importance to be presented will be
the ship subsidy bill which will be
introduced by Senator Frye and the
Nicaraguan canal bill which Senator
Morgan will present Senator Frye
has not entirely completed his bill
but he said it would be different in
many details from the old bill of last
session That measure was framed by
former Senator Edmunds Senator
Frye himself is the author of the new
bill Senator Morgans canal bill will
be a duplicate of Representative Hep
burns bill on the canal question
Other early bills of importance will
be one looking to the construction of
a sub marine cable from the western
coast to Hawaii and another provid
ing for the establishment of a new
executive department to be known as
the department of commerce On
Tuesday the senate will adjourn until
the following Monday The general
opinion among senators is that very
little real work will be done before
the Christmas holidays
The first subject demanding atten
tion is reciprocity Various treaties
are now pending in the senate look
ing to commercial agreements between
the United States and other countries
Senator Aldrich will renew his efforts
to have these treaties which have al
ready been reported from the commit
tee on foreign affairs committed to
the committee on finance on the
ground that they deal with tariff
questions

PROVES NO GENUINE COMET
Director Campbell of Lick Observatory
Explains Phenomenon
SAN FRANCISCO Dec 2 Director
Campbell of the Lick observatory has
made a thorough search of the heav
ens for the phenomenon witnessed at
Chicago a few nights since Prof
Campbell failed to find the slightest
trace of a comet He explains the
phenomenon witnessed in Chicago in
two ways saying
What the people saw may have
been the bright trail left by a me
teor I myself have watched such
trails for as much as twenty minutes
before they wholly disappeared It is
more probable though that what they
saw was the constellation known as
the Pleiades It so happens that the
Pleiades are now in exactly the loca
tion in the heavens described in the
dispatches and when obscured by a
thin mist the constellation looks so
much like a comet that it has been
mistaken for it before

STIRS UP NATIONAL GUARD
Adjutant General Authorizes Additional
Companies
LINCOLN Neb Dec 2 Adjutant
General Colby turned loose his order
machine and ground out some orders
for the Nebraska National guard He
authorized the organization of two
new independent companies one at
West Point and the other at Stanton
James C Elliott was given authority
to organize a company at West Point
and G A Eberly of Stanton was giv
en permission to recruit another at
his home town Both companies will
be equipped by the state and after
organization may be admitted to the
guard
Orders were also issued for the for
mation of a signal corps and en
gineers corps at Fremont and two ad
ditional sections of artillery the latter
probably at Plattsmouth and Grand
Island though the location is still un
determined
This activity in the Nebraska Na
tional guard has caused many to be
lieve that a third regiment is to be
organized but General Colby says
there is no ground for that belief as
the independent companies do not in
dicate a new regiment He says the
matter of organizing a third regiment
is undetermined
The formation of two additional sec
tions of artillery will necessitate more
guns as each section is supposed to
have two guns General Colby has
taken steps to secure four new model
breech loading cannon together with
harness and equipment
MANY WANT BOOKS TO READ

Loup City Alexandria Douglas Par
dum Kenesaw Fairmont Oak pre
cinct and Osceola
The commission has aprpoximately
1200 available for the purchase of
books This money it is estimated
will buy over 1400 books About one
third of the books in each set will
be of the juvenile class and a ma
jority of the balance will come under
the general classification of fiction It
is the desire of the commission to
have each large town or city which
is a beneficiary of the traveling li
brary system make a small donation
for the purchase of new books It is
believed that in this way the pur
chase fund will be greatly increased

WHAT A LEADING AGRICULTURIST
SAYS OF WESTERN GANAU
Prof Thomas Shaw of Minnesota
verslty Gives an Unbiased Opinion
In a letter to The Farmer St Paul
dated Sept 1st 1901 Prof Thomas
Univer
Minnesota State
Shaw of the
sity has tho following to say after
having made a trip through Western
Canada
The capabilities of the immense
Canada are but
area known as Western
little understood on this sldo of the
line Our people are apt to look upon
it as a region of frost and snow a
country in which but a small portion
of the land relatively will over bo till
able because of tho rigors of the cli
mate True the climate is cold in win
ter but Western Canada has neverthe
less just that sort of climate which
makes it tho most reliable wheat pro
ducing country in all the continent
An Immense Area
Western Canada is not only an Im
mense area but the samo description
will apply to those portions of the
country that are capable of being suc
cessfully tilled or grazed Nearly all
of the prairie Province of Manitoba
though probably not one third of Its
surface has been laid open by the plow
Assinibola to the west is a grain and
stock country Saskatchewan to the
north of Assiniboia has high adapta
tion for the same This also may be
said of Alberta to the west Here lies
what may be termed a grain growing
and stock producing empire the re
sources of which have been but little
drawn upon comparatively viewed
from the standpoint of the agricultur
alist When it is called to mind that
even In the Peace River country in
Athabasca and several hundreds of
miles north of the Canadian boundary
wheat was grown which won a pre
mium at the Worlds Fair in 18S3 tho
capabilities of this country In wheat
production loom up more brightly than
even the brilliant northern lights of
the land that lies toward the pole
Adapted to Stock and Grain Production
The region under consideration Is
however mainly adapted to growing
grain and grazing stock Much of it is
adapted to growing both grain and
stock but certain areas especially to
wards the mountains are only adapted
to ranching except where Irrigation
will yet be introduced This of course
can be done successfully along the
many streams that flow down from the
Rockies and water the country towards
the east and north The adaptation of
the country for wheat production Is of
a high character The cool nights
that usually characterize the ripening
season are eminently favorable to the
filling of the grain and to the secur
ing of a plump berry and consequently
large yields The crop this year Is a
magnificent one In Manitoba and the
territories it should certainly give an
average of more than 20 bushels per
acre But should the yield be not more
than 20 bushels the crop will be a
most handsome one owing to the large
area sown to wheat Many farmers
only grow grain But those who do
succeed as well in growing oats and
barley as In growing wheat hence
these foods for stock should always be
abundant Some grow cattle mainly
and others combine the two The last
named of course is doubtless the saf
est of the three during a long course
of years that is to say where much
farming is practicable
Quality of tho live Stock
It was a peasurable surprise to
note the high quality of the stock
The average of quality in cattle is
higher than the average of cattle in our
state unless in the dairy classes This
opinion Is not reached rashly or with
out ample opportunity for investiga
tion I spent three long days in the
show ring at Winnipeg making the
awards in the beef classes I question
if any of our states single handed
could make such a showing In cattle
It was my privilege to make the
awards at several shows and at all of
their fairs were evidences that much
attention Is given to the improvement
oi tne stocK I noted carefully the
character of the herds that grazed
along the railroad and everywhere the
high average of the quality of the stock
was in evidence
Reasons for Quality in Stock
The quality of the grass Is good
Many of the settlers came from On
tario and had been schooled as to the
value of good stock before going west
The railroads and the government
have taken a deep interest in making
it less difficult and costly to the farm
ers to secure good males
Those who are anxious of changing
their residence should bear in mind
that the lands in Western Canada are
many of them free and others reason
ably cheap

any agent of the Canadian government
