Detailed Account or tlie llattle Tlie
Victors nrnl Vanquished Eutertalned
at ii Banquet at 1J. J. McGrnuu'H.
When yesterday's 2 p. ni. train rolled
Inte the Pennsylvania station there alighted
a jelly Bet of young men who wen ltl rival
In form and address Apelle of antiquity.
They w ere students of St. Jehn's college,
Feniham, N. Y., and their mission was te
check F. .V M.'s victorious feet ball team in
Its triumphal match.
It Is reported that theMi men have wen
Inn rein and distinction In many athletic
contesls, but any ene who saw thorn play
feet ball yesterday at McOrann'H park
would net be likely te accept this game
us their stronghold. Somehow they failed
In their mission and were compelled te
succumb te the powers of their adversary
by a very unenviable score. Stout and
muscular men make up their rush line, but
they full short in executing the 11 no points
of the game. TheJF. it M. boys forced the
play from beginning and played with their
accustomed cleverness. After the contests
like these just passed a game llke this
afforded much amusement and pleasure
for them but te the St. Jehn's nothing np np np
poared particularly laughable
Carri.iges, which were trimmed with the
colors of the respcctlve celleges, bore the
teams te the scene of the cenllut.
Dosplte the threatening weather, about
1 out) people from the city witnessed tlie
game. Whlle the game was net as brilliant
as theso played bofero, much interest was
manifested and overy movement was care
fully watched, The usual disputes and
wrangling wero net engaged In, and the
bc-t feeling prevailed the St. Jehn's fully
acknowledging their Inferiority te F. A- M.
Fer the visitors Charles Hellly, of this city,
who attends St. Jehn, by his running and
tackling, merited the most honor. T.
Carmerty also did well. On the home
team, as usual, all did well. Harreld, by
clever eeettriug of the ball, and Grlfilth,
uy geed tackling, wen much admiration.
Irvine did excellent work in the centre,
and madu several splendid runs. Gabriel,
true te his fame, made brilliant runs, as
did Nethsteln.
llin'AIT.S OF TIIK OAMi:.
Tt was about 20 miuutcs of three when
the maroon and white and blue coaches
arrived en the grounds, and Immediately
the preliminary work, which consisted in
kicking, passing and catching the ball,
beg-in. Tills seen becume tee tame for the
boys, and though net yet threo o'clock, the
two teams advanced te the contre of the
Held, F. A: M. facing the north goal and
having tlie ball, whlle Fordham cast thelr
eyes toward the sunny south.
After tlie captains expressed thotnelvos
as ready, Uetoree Wiley called play and the
game, b'egan.
Irvine dribbled the ball te Gabriel: In an
Instant thostve teams wero en a heap and
the ball was down eight yards from the
centre.
Irvine next took the ball, gave the
shovers the weid and iive yards mero wero
added. ' Holiied again, with an additional
gain often yards.
f After several mero slight advances by
the Mine kind of work, he succeeded In
massing the visiting team about the cen
tre j but, te vary the monotony, Nethsteln
took the bill around the end and the lirst
touch-down was made Just three minutes
after play begin. Irvine kicked goal and
the score was tl te 0.
Tluv was resumed in the middle of the
field, "Heillv taking tlie ball and advancing
it .en yards. T. Carmedy backed this up
with ten uieie. After another advauce of
llve yards their pregress was checked and
en the fourth down our boys again had the
ball. Gabriel shot around the cud for a
gain of fifleeu yards. The visitors new be
gan te line out wellin order te check the
inns, but a ccntie rTTSlneminded them
of the fact th it Lebach was still In the
game. Huns by Nelhstein and Gabriel
carried tlie leather twenty yards further,
und Irvine rushed for eight yards. Slowly
but surely the ball moved forward till Ir Ir
vieo plained it well across the line, and
niter kicking goal the scere steed 12 te 0, In
favor of the white and blue.
Keilly gained (en yards for his team, but
en the next play Harreld secured the ball
and its course was changed. Soen the ball
was carried back te the starting point and '
Nethsteln, sweeping around the ond.beioro
he could be tackled, had the ball behind
the goal line. The try at goal failed, but
Harreld seized the ball and immediately
inade another touch-down Irein which Ir Ir
vieo kit ked goal. Score, 22 te 0.
After gaining ten yards Carmedy kicked
and Irvine secured the ball en F. it M.'h
twenty-five vnrd line. It was seen worked
back te Ferdliain's territory again and alter
n 'iVyard dash scored the leurth touch
down, from which Irvine kicked goal.
Fordham started the bill with a kick,
but ene of our tall men jumped before It
nnd Gabilel seUing it gained ten yards.
I vine next made ene of his beautiful
rushes, carrvlmr all who could hung en.
gaining 20 yards. After a run of 20 yards
Gabriel laid the ball gently betwem the
pests. Irvine kicked goal, und utieru few
minutes mere play the tlrst half closed.
Score, 31 te 0.
SECOND HALF.
By this tlme the visitors wero warm
enough and they looked with longing eyes
toward the north jxile. Ureely tried te
reach this point some years age and was
snewed under; se wero they. The visitors
had the ball, advanced It ten ynrds.but let
It en a forward pass. Our rushers new
began te rush and after a few of theso by
our Invincible Nethsteln ran around the
end and scored the 7th touch-down. Geal.
Nine minutes later F. .v. M. secured another
touch-down and klcked goal.

perfected the arrangements of the game,
which yesterday gave the F. and M. team
.a signal victory ever the eleven from
St, Jehn's college, Fordham, N. Y., he was
not'eentent, but, with unparalleled hospital
ity, Invited the members of bet It teams te
a banquet at his palatial country residence,
en the outskirts of the city. After the
game the teams met at the City hotel,
whence by the kindness of
Mit, n. j. M'enAN.v
they were cenveyed te his residence In
coaches. The banquet was given In Mr.
McGraun's parlor, where covers were set
for forty persons ; the regular dining
room constituted an overllew- room,
where the dozen or mero ether
gliesis from Fordham and Lancaster
dined. The tables laden with cut (low
ers and dainties, together with the forty
athletes, formed a plcturcsque sight and
ene worth miles of travel te soe. The chun
dcllcrs, windows nnd tables were wreathed
nud decorated with smllax ; great banks of
roses covered the mantels, and plateaus of
choice llowers steed en each table ; the
mellow light of wax candles under many
colored shades and variegated fairy lamps
enhanced the beautv of the seotie.
In front of the large mirrors at eltlier.
enu were suspended two large uerai tool
balls, Inscribed with the initials of the two
teams In violet. Aftert he banquet theso
were presented by Master Itichard I. Mo Me
G rami te the captains of two teams. Sir.
McGrann uinde an address of wolcemo nud
the guests were seated alternately, a Ford
ham aud a Lancaster man, the captains and
Heforee Wiley each occupying the heed of
a table.
The dinner, a model of the caterer's art,
was solved In eleven courses. The best of
f;oed humor prevailed, and the men who
lad struggled desperately in the afternoon
against each ether vied ene with' another
te prometo the feeling of geed fellowship.
After the cigars had beeu passed, Mr. W.
U. Hcnsel acted in the capacity of Im
promptu teastmaster. Captain Irvine re
sponded for the F. it M. team, and Captain
Cirmedy for the Fordham bevs. Mr,

or the Seven Games Only One Is Scored
Against Franklin and Murs'iull.
Hefere Captain Irvine came td Lancaster
the collcge was without n feet ball team
nnd the game was entirely new te the city.
He at ence proceeded te organbe a team
that the city, as well as the college poenle,
have geed reason te fuel proud of. The
season just closed has been a brilliant one
for them. Out of seven games they lest
but one, thut being with the Dickinsen
College club, In Carlisle. In the return
game played here, howevor, the home
club wero easy victors. In the seven
games played the Franklin and Mar
shall team scored 188 points te 20 by thelr
opponents. That Is certainly an excellent
record. Ne prophetic cye Is needed te sce
F. it M.'s feet ball team in time near at
hand pressing hard the teams of the larger
celleges for supremacy. The earnestness
and por-cveratice that has been shown by
them have bieught their victories. What
may net be said of F. it M. ?
The great success of the team Is owing
largely te the splendid work of Captain
Irvine, who kept the men In practice con
stantly and looked after them at nil times.

LANCASTER,
WISDOM'S HEPOUT.
MesMise or the Secretary of the Trvasury
te Congress,
Wasihnotex, Dec 4. Socretary of the
Treasurv Wlndem te-day sent te Congress
his report en the state of the finances for
the year 1880. Following are the impor
tant points of the report t
The revenue from all sources amounted
te $3S7,050,0e8.84 ; of this 223,8.2.-41.09
was from customs and 1130,881,513.02 from
Internal revenue.
The expenditures were 1281,990,015.00,
leaving a surplus of 105,053,443.21 ; H7,
583, 313.65 was used for the purchase of
bends, leaving a net surplus of f57,40,
129.50. The estimated revenues for the year end
ing June 30, 1891, are: Frem customs,
9220,000,000 ; from Internal revenue, a135,
000,000 ; from sales of public lands, 97,000.
000; total, 9385,000,000. Estimated expendi
tures, 9202,271,401.70; or an estimated sur
plus of 992,728,505.30; estimated amount
required for the sinking fund, 919,150,073 ;
leaving a net surplus fur the year of $13,
609,522.30. In 1889, 990,979.427.35 was applied te the
purchase and redemption of the debt. As
compared with 8I0J.220, 401.71 at tlie close
of the fiscal year 1888, the cesh balance In
the treasury evor nnd abeve all accrued
liabilities at the clese of 1889 was 971,481,
042.39. If te this balance there be added
the estimated surplus for the current fiscal
year, the amount that may be applied te
the purchase of bends te June 30, 1890, will
be 9103,484,042.39. Bends and ether obliga
tions of the Unlted States have already
been purchased and rodeomod te the ex
tent of 950,405.485.49, leavlag the avallable
cash en hand November 1, 1889, 915,335,
702.40. The amount required for pensions in
1889, was $95,02 1,779.11; the amount appro
priated for tlie year ending June 30. 1890,
was 997,758,700. A comparison of tne nx nx
pendlturesef 1879 with these of 18S9 will
show that during the last ten years the in
crease of pensions has net diHered very
wldely from the docrease of Interest en the
public debt: Pensions In 1879, $.15,121,
482.39; ponslens in 18S9, 995,024,770.11:
Interest en publla debt 1879, 8105,37,919;
interest en public debt 1889, 811,001,481.29.
The secretary says: An accumulation
of nioiiey in the treasury beyend the
necessities of the government endangers
legitimate business, tends te excessive and
wasteful public expenditure, and te en
courage extravagance In private uiralrs. In
the preseuce of such conditions, it Is a man
ifest duty te wisely guard against a future
accumulation with its fruitful truln of
evils. I
lteductlen of the Interest-bearing debt of
the government, by the purchase of bends,
Is thoexpodiout resorted te for returning a
part of this surplus te the channels of trade,
and Is the only means new open te the
secretary of the treasury for the use of this
mouey. Te requlre from him this incisure
of rosiienslbility and discretion is of doubt
ful wisdom.
UF.COMMJINns TAMI!' 1115VISIOX.
It is manifestly wrong te take meney
irem me neopie ler me cancellation ei
bends, te tlie saving of only about 2 per
cent of interest, wlien it is worth te thorn,
perluips, three times as much In their busi
ness, it Is rather through a reduction of
customs receipts and internal taxes, that
an unnecessary uccumulatldti of mouey in
the treasury should be avoided.
Itodtictleu In receipts from customs pre
sents the only advisable means ler dimin
ishing the reyenue. This can be ac
complished :
First. Uy reduction in rates of duty
UMn'tliose articles which, by reasen of
inconsideruto legislation, or changes which
have occurred in the development of our
industries, me found te be oxcessive.
Second. Uy increase In rates upon
nrtlcles which have net been successfully
produced here, because net adequately
protected ; the obvious effect of which in
crease .would be te stimulate domestic pro
duction nnd diminish Importations nnd
rovenue. It is plain that such articles
should either be lulrly protected or placed
upon the froe lLst.
Third, ily transferring te the froe list
articles which, from climatic or ethor
causes, are net and can net be successfully
produced hore, also articles which, under
existing conditions, we can net economi
cally produce in sulllcient quantities te
meet tne needs of our people, or toserve
the purpose of competition with foreign
productions, and nrticles the production of
which Is of inconsiderablo imjiertancc.
Whatever dllloreucos of opinion thore
may be with regard te the best method of
disposing of the surplus rovenue, and pre
venting the accumulation of money In the
treasury beyend the preper needn of the
government, and however diverse may be
opinions as te the abstract question of tax
ation for rovenue purposes, customs and
internal, there is general ngrccment that a
revision of the tarlll' and customs laws is
urgently needed.
The tariff act of 1883 was hastily con
sidered und passed. While Intended as a
protectho measure, It was based en former
tarltl's, and perpetuated many of the In
equalities and ether defects with which
theso acts abounded, and which have net
only beeu directly hurtful te certain
domestic interesls, but have afforded op ep op
peitunitles for evasion, and provoked con
stant dispute and litigation.
It is estimated that the Internal rovenue
receipts for tlie cucrcht fiscal year will
amount te 8135,000,000. The tax collected
en tobacco w as as fellow s: Frem cigars,
cigarettes, and cheroots 8 12,077,987.00; lrem
snuff, 8015.0VJ.57; Frem manufactures of
tobacco, 817,070,899.91; from special taxes,
81,400 SOO. 12 ;;tetal,."831,8(irt.8.t7.53.
" Whatever may be said of the moral or
fihyslcul ellects and lulluence of tobacco, it
i.is ceme te be regarded as n necessity by
tlie peer as well as the rich. It is new tlie
only product of agriculture that. Is dlrectly
taxed by the government. Tlie repeal ,of
this tax would reduce the surplus about
832.000,000."
The subject of exempting from taxation
alcohol for use In the arts merits nnd has
received much attention. A tax of 85,40,
000 is collected. Its use would doubtless
be largely increased wero It net for this
tax, which Is equivalent te about 250 per
cent, of Its value. This is a direct and on
erous burden upon our industrial interests
and U'Hin the consumers of the articles
produced, for which there new seems te be
ue necessity or excuse.
KXI'OHTS AND 'tMl'OnTS.
The total value of our imports and ex ex
eorts of merchandise and specie during the
last fiscal year was 81,013,137,0.13, an In
crease ever the preceding J ear of 8S7,i73,
813, and was greater than for any year
since 1881.
Tlie total value of experts was 8730,282,
009, uud imports $745,131,023.
The iews of the becretary en the
silver question were Included In the
president's message. Here is the socra secra
tary's recommendatien:
" Issue treasury notes ngalrfnt deposits
of silver bullion at the market price of sil
ver when deposited, payable en demand in
such riiiautltics of siher bullion as will
equal in value, at the date of presentation,
the number of dollars expressed nu the
face of the notes at the m irket price of sll
er, or ill geld, at the option of the govern
ment; or lit silver dollars ut the option of
the holder, ltcpc.il the compulsory fea
ture of the present cel mice act."
The monetary transactions of the govern
ment hae been conducted through the
treasurer of the United States, nine sub
treasurers, and two hundred and ninety
six national bank depositaries.
The amount of public moneys deposited
with national banks en the 1st of Juuuarv,
1887, was about 8.50,000,000. Prier te that
date, for a nuuiber of jcars, the average
was considerably less. During the year
1887 the amount se deposited Increased
until, In October, it was 8 11,707,478, aud, In
December. It hud swollen te 852. HKi.017.
The highest point reached was In April,
18S3, when tne amount se deposited was
801,921.21l, since which time it has (In
creased until, en the 31st of Oclolier, 1889,
it was 817,495,479. There should be a
further rwductlen, at the earliest day prac
ticable, of at Iest $W,O0j,00O, leaving only
such amounts as are necessary for the
business transactions of the go eminent.
It is grossly unjust tothugevcrnment te
grant the froe use of lis mouey, while it
pays te the very jiartles thus favored, I and
4J ier cent. interest en Its own bends,
which are pledged as security for the
money inns rt-cciveu.
There seems te be no oxcuse for this.
Icy, when the treasury could use tlie
money la Ui& purcIuuM of bemU,
PA., WEDNESDAY,
thereby return It te circulation and save a
large portion of the Interest
It Is manifestly unfair te the peeple te
glve the Iwinks tlie use of thelr meney for
nothing, whlle they are required, by the
banks, te pay from 0 te 8 per cent, lntorest
en It.
A sudden or Injudicious withdrawal
would be felt far mero severely by tlie

A Misstate Mether nnd ltithy That Had
Decnmped Frem the Almshouse.
On Sunday, Sadle Christ who had her
fourteen-weekf-eld child with herdlsai
pcared from the almshouse where they
had been since the birth of the child. When
It was found that the voupte had left, the
ofllcers of the Institution began a search
for them, as they did net think the mother
had any right te leave In that manner,
especially as the child 'was quite sick.
Complaint was made against tlie woman
befere Alderman Dcen, charging her with
cruelty te a child nnd the police officers
were notified te be en the lookout. Olneer
lleas located the mother at the house of
Mrs. Emma Ruth yesterday nnd notified
the chief of police They visited the house
and thoie found out from the mother the
true slate of aftulrs. The mother said that
she wanted te get a situation and drslred
te have her baby taken cure of by seme
ene. Her step sister, F.mmn Herr,
agreed te take It. Last Tuesday they
had Intended te leave the; almshouse,
but an opportunity did net present itself.
On Sunday she stelo away with her child
nnd carried it te the reservoir, where she
met her sister, Kmma Wnldley, nud
Samuel Fleming. They nil ceme te town
together and en Monday the mother leek
the child te Mrs. Huth's. The matter was
given Inte the eharge of Censtable Sam
haub, who returned the child te the alms
house te-day. It seems that the mother's
intentions were geed, but the manner in
which she left tlie iilmshouse was some
what suspicious and had the child died the
ofllcers of the Institution might have beeu
Blamed. Fer that reason they had the
matter investigated.

TIIK Htr.VKII QUKHTION.
In discussing the sllver question the
president says: "The total colmige of
sliver dollars was en November 1, 1889,
8.in,O3H,O0I, of which 928,1,(139.521 was In the
treasury vaults and 90O,09H,4m) wero In cir
culation. Of the amount lu the vaults
9277,3Hi9ll was net In circulation nnd net
represented by cmtlllcates. The law re
quiring the purchase by the treasury
of two million dollars' worth of sllver
bullion each month te be coined Inte silver
dollars of four hundred nud twelve and
ene-half grains has been observed by the
department, but neither the present secre secro socre
tary nor any efhls predecessors has deemed
It 8ii fe te exercise the discretion given by
law te Incroase the monthly purchases te
four million dollars. When the law was
enacted, February 28, 1878, the lirlce of
silver in the market was 81.20 2-10 per
ounce, malting the bullion vahin et the
dollar 93 cents. Siuce that tlme the price
has fallen as low as 01.2 cents per cents,,
reducing the bullion value of the dollar te
iu.il coins, vt limn the last low months the
market prlce has somewhat advanced. On
fhe 1st day of November last the bullion
value of the sliver dollar was 72 cents. The
evil anticipations which havonccempanlod
thocelnageund usoef the silver dollar liave
net been realized. As n coin it has net
had general use nnd tlie public treasury
has been compelled te store It. Hut this Is
manifestly owing te the fact that Its paper
representative Is mero convenient. The
general uccoptauce and use of the silver
cortillcate show thut silver has net beeu
otherwise discredited. Seme favorable
conditions have contributed te maintain
this nruticnl equality In thelr commercial
use bctwoen the geld nnd silver dollars.
Hut seme of theso are trade conditions that
statutory ouactmeuts de net control and
of the continuance of which we cannot
be certain. I think it Is clear that If we
should niake the coinage of silver at the
present rnlle free we must expect that the
ilitl'erence In the bullion values of the geld
nnd sllver dollars will be taken account of
lu commercial transactions nud I fear the
same result would fellow any conslderablo
Incroase of the present ntte of coinage
Such il result would be discredit te our
-financial management nnd disastrous te all
business Interesls. any safe legislate
upon this subject must secure the equality
of the twrf coins lu their commercial
uses. I have always beeu an advocate of the
use of sliver lu our currency. We are
large producers of that metal und should
net discredit It. Te the plan which will be
presented by tlie secretary of the treasury
ier the Issuance of notes or ccrtlllcates
upon the deposit of sllver bullion at Its
market vnlue I have been able te give only
a hasty examination owing te the press of
ether mutters nnd te the fact that It has
been se recently formulated. The detullH
of such n law require careful considera
tion, but the general plan suggestcd by hint
Reems te satisfy the purpose te contlntie
the use of silver In connection with our
currency, mid ut the same tlme te obviute
the danger of which I have spoken. At a
later day 1 may communicate further with
Congress upon this subject."
In a rcforcuce te the assault upon
Supreme Court Justlce Field by David H.
Tcrryiii California, uud the killing of the
assailant by n deputy U. S. marshal, the
president recommends that mero dollulte
pro"isleii be made by law, net only for the
protection of fedenil ofllcers, but Tern full
trial of such cases in the United States
court.
I TIIVNTS nKNOIIKCKU.
On the subject of " trusts " tfie president
says: " Earnest attention' should be given
by Congress te a consideration of the
quostlen hew far the restraint of theso
combinations efa capital commonly called
'trusts' Is a matter of federal jurisdic
tion, When ergaulcd as they often are te

article of commerce uud general necessity
thev iiredaiigomnseenHtiiracios against the
public geed, and should be made the sub
ject of prohibitory uud even penal legisla
tion." On the pension question the president
says : " The law new provides u pension
for every soldier nnd sailor who was mus
tered Inte the son ice of the Jlnlted States
during the civil war, and Is new suffering
from wounds or dlsease, having tin origin
lu the service and In the line et duty. Twe
of the three necessary facts, viz., muster
and disability, ure usually susceptible nf
easy proof, but the third origin lu the ser
vice is often (tilllcult. uud In tiiuiiv deserv
ing cases iiujMissihlote establish. That very
many of theso who endured the hardships
of our most bloody and arduous campaigns
are new disabled from diseases that hail n
real but net traceable eilglu in tlie service
I de net doubt. Jlesldes these thore is
another class composed of men, many of
wiiem served an enlistment et three lull
years and efreenlisted veterans who added
it fourth year of service, who escaped the
casualties of battle nud the assaults of dis
ease, who were ever ready for iiny detail,
who were In every battle line of their com
mand and wero mustered out lu sound
health uud have sluce the close of the war,
while lighting with the same Indomitable
and Independent spirits the contests of
civil life, been overcome by disease or cas
ualty." FAVOIIIMI I'KNSIONH 1'OK A 1. 1, SOMilKIIS,

ident says: Horcteforo the book oftllgi eftllgi

certltkatiQus wcru made upon the requisi

was then the source of much suspicion,
and of many charges of favoritism In the
admlnlstratlcn or law. What Is secret Is al
ways suspected, whnt Is open can bejudged
The civil service commission with the full
approval of all its memliers has new
onene.1 the list of cllglbles te the public
The eligible lists for the classified post pest post
elllces and custom houses are new publicly
Pet In the respective ontces, as are also
the certifications for appointments. The
purpese or the civil service law was abso
lutely te exclude any ether consideration
In connection with appointments under it
than that of merit as tested by the
examinations. The business proceeds
upon the theory that both the examin
ing beards nnd the appointing of ofllcers
are absolutetly Ignorant as te the political
view nud associations of nil persons en the
civil sorvlce lists. It is net tee much te say,
however, that seme recent congressional
Investigations have somewhat shaken
public confidence In the impartiality of the
selections for appointment. The reform of
the civil sorvlce will make no ssfe or satis
factory advance until the present law and
Its equal administration are well estab
lished lu the confidence of the pnople. It
will be my pleasure as It Is my duty te soe
that tlie law Is executed with tlrm
ncss and Impartiality. If seme of
Its previsions have been fraudulently
evaded by appointing elllccrs our resent resent
inent should net snggest the repeal or the
law, but reform lu its administration. Wn
should have ene vlew of the matte.' and
held It with a sincerity that Is net ntleeted
by the consideration thatthe party te
which we belong Is for the tlme In power.
My predecessor en the Ith day or January,
1889, by an executive erder te take ell'eVt
March 13. breuuht the railroad mull servicn
utider the oiM-rallen of the civil sor ser sor
vleo law. Prevision was made that
the eitler should take olfect sooner
lu any state where an eligible list
was sooner obtained. On the 11th day
of Mnreh Mr. Lyman, then the only mem
ber of the commission, reerted te me lu
writing that It would net be possible te
have tlie list of cllglbles ready befere May
1 and requested that the taking effect of
the order be postponed until that tlme,
which was dene subject te the same pro pre
vision contained In the original order
ns te states lu which nn ellglbln list
was sooner obtained. As n result
of the revision of the rules of the
new classification nnd of the inclusion
ofthe railway malt sorvlce the work of Uie
commission hns been greatly Increased aud
the prosent clerical ferce Is found te be In
adequate I recommend that the addi
tional clerks asked by the commission lie
appropriated for. The duty ofthe appoint
ment Is devolved by the constitution or by
the law nnd the appointing ofllcers are
properly held te a high responsibility In Its
exercise. The growth of the country and
the consequent increase ofthe civil list have
magnified this function of the oxecutlvo
dlspropertlonally. It cannot be denied,
however, that the labor connected with
this necessary work Is Increased often te
the point of actual distress by thosudden
excessive demands that are inade upon nu
Incoming administration for removals and
nptxilutnients. Hut en the ether hand It Is
net true thut lucumbenuy Is n conclu

elllces se conduct themselves as te con
vince lust political opKnents that no party
consideration or bias nlfects In any way
the discharge of their public dutles we can
mera easily stay the demand for remov
als. I am satisfied that both in nnd
out nf the chissllled sorvlce great
honellt would acrue front the adop
tion of seme system bv which the
olllcer would recolve tlie distinction
and benellt that In all private
employment comes from exceptional faith
fulness and elllclency In the pcrfortnaneo
of duty. I have suggested te the heeds of
the oxecutlvo departments that they con
sider whother a record might net be kept
In each bureau of all theso elements that
ure covered by the terms. ' faithfulness'

thn relative mellis of the clerks of each

each class. They will be appropriately In
dicated In the official register lu the report
of the department. That u great stimulus
would thus be given te the whole sorvlce,
I de net doubt uud such n record would be
the best defense against Inconsiderate re
movals from ofllce."

The prosldent rocnmmetids n national
grant et money for education. He admits
that such grunts of mouey from the public
treasury, should be always suggested by
seme exceptional conditions, but says the
sudden emancipation of the slaves of the
Seuth, the bestowal oflue simrage and tlie
Impairment of the ability of the states
where these new citl.ens were chlelly
found te adequately provide educational
facilities presented net only exceptional
but unexampled conditions."
In further discussing the condition ofthe
colored people the president says that since
their freedom from slavery they have from
a staudiKiitit of ignorance und poverty
which was our shame net theirs made re
markable advances In education and In the
acquisition of property. They liave as a
(Hiople shown themselves te be friendly
and faithful towards the whlle race under
temptations of tremendous strength. They
furnish courngeoiis uud faithful soldlers te
our nrmy nnd In civil lire they ure new the
tellers of their communities gcuendlyithey
de net desire te quit home, the president
continues, and their employers resent the
Interference of the emigration agents who
seek te stlmulute such a desire. Hut not
withstanding all this In many parts of our
country, where the colored population Is
large, the peeple of that race are by various
devices deprived of any effocllve exerclse
of ther political rights and of many of their
ci II rights. The wrong docs net exjeml
Itself iiK)ii theso whose votes are sup
pressed. Every constituency In the Union
is wronged. It has been the hope of every
patriot that a sense of Justlce and of
resjsjct for the law would work a
gradual euro of these flagrant evils.
Surely no ene supiioses that the present
can be accepted as a pcrmauent condition.
If it Is said that these committees must
work out this problem for themselves, vv e
have a right te usk whether they ure ut
work upon It. De they suggest any solu
tion? When and under what condition Is
the black man te have u free ballet?
When Is he lu fact te liave theso full civil
rights which have se long been his in Jaw?
When Is tli.it equality of lulluence which
our form of government wus Intended te
secure te the electors te be restored ? '1'hl.s
generation should courageously face these
grave questions and net leave them as a
heritage of war te the next. The consulta
tion should proceed with candor, calm
ness and great patience ; upon the Hues
of justlce uud humanity, net of preju
dice and cruelty. Ne ouestlou lu
our country can be ut rest except upon the
iirm base ei justice aim ei tue n
base of Justlce and
of the law. I
earnestly Invoke I
the attention of Conuress
te the consideration of such measures
within its well defined constitutional
powers us will secure te all our iwoplea
free oxerciso of the right of suffrage and
every ether civil right under the
constitution and laws of the United
States. Ne evil, hew qver deplorable can
Justify the assumption, either en the part
ofthe executive or of Congress of powers
net granted, but both vv ill be highly blaiu blaiu
iible If nil the powers granted ure net
wisely but firmly used te correct theso
evils. The pewer te take the whole
direction uud control of the election
of members of the 11 en se of Repre
sentatives is clearly given te the
general government. A partial und
qualified supervision of these elec
tions Is new provided for by law, and In
my opinion this law may be se strength
ened uud extended as te secure, en the
whole better results than can be attained
by u law taking all the processes of such
cioctleu Inte federal control. The colored
man should be protected In nil of his rela
tions te the federal government, whether
