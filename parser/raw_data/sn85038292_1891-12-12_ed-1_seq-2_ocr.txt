(Thr Ihinacratif Advocate.
WESTMINSTER, MD.
SATUKDAV, DECEMBER 12,1801.
The Speakership.
In an article on the Speakership, in the
issue of November 7th, the ADVOCATE
said—“ Some months ago the Advocate
expressed a preference for Mr. Crisp, and.
all things considered, he is, in our judg
ment, the best equipped of all the aspirants.
The Advocate then went on to advocate
the selection of Mr. Springer, of Illinois.
He is a good parliamentarian, has had long
experience in the House, is a tariff reformer,
sound on finance, and comes from a state
that has recently sent a Democrat to the
United States Senate and increased its
Democratic representation in the House
from seven to fourteen. Illinois, it must
be remembered, was once reliably Repub
lican by from forty to fifty thousand, and
it is the centre of a belt of states, from the
Ohio River to the Dakotas, where the great
tight in 18112 is to be waged. To have
given Illinois the Speakership would have
been a recognition, we thought, of the
sturdy Democracy of that commonwealth,
and also an encouragement to the Democ
racy of the northern half of the Union
which hits, for the first time since the war,
elected a majority of Democrats to Con
gress. Further, Mr. Springer’s election,
we believed, would have avoided the sec
tional issue raised against the Democrats
in 1888, when it was truthfully charged
that the Speaker and all the important
committee chairmen were from the South.
We yield to the party’s selection, how
ever, and it may be better that Mr. Crisp
has been chosen. Mr. Springer himself
withdrew and voted for him. Had the
Speakership gone North, the other positions
would probably have been distributed in
the South As it is, the South secured
the Speaker and the other positions are all
given to the North. James Kerr, of
Pennsylvania, was made Clerk' Samuel
S. Voder, of Ohio, Sergeant-at-Arms;
Charles 11. Turner, of New \ork. Door
keeper; and Lyeurgus Dalton, of Indiana.
Postmaster. By this distribution the
Democracy of New York, Pennsylvania
Ohio and Indiana arc complimented, and
Illinois will doubtless get a prominent
committee chairmanship by the appoint
ment of Mr. Springer.
Mr. Crisp is the best equipped man for
Chairman, by reason of his thorough
knowledge of the rules and his equitable
temjKTainent. Mr. Mills is too irascible
for the position, and Mr. Springer s chief
claim to the place, although very competent,
was his geographical location from a party
standpoint.
There was no party policy involved in
the contest nor were tlure any presiden
tial aspirations bound up in it. Republican
papers affected to believe that the failure
to elect Mr. Mills would be a virtual aban
donment of the tariff issue, but this was
only a part in politics they were playing.
They sougl t thus to drive Democrats into
selecting him, and counted upon his excit
able disposition to lead him into errors that
would offset Reed’s rude and autocratic
conduct.
Tariff reform is still the leading issue,
with sound finance next, and Cleveland is
still the leading candidate for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination. This would
have been the situation had any of the
aspirants been chosen, for party policy on
the tariff and finance was not involved in
the result, neither were the fortunes of Mr.
Cleveland.
Testing the McKinley Act.
Three cases, involving the constitution
ally of the McKinley tariff act, were argued
before the Supreme Court of the United
States last week. The cases were those of
Boyd, Sutton A Co. and Sternbach Sc Co.,
of New York, and Marshall, Field & Co.,
of Chicago, against the collectors of cus
toms at New York and Chicago respect
ively. The eases involved three points
and were heard together by a full bench.
The points raised were that the sugar
bounty clause of the McKinley act is
unconstitutional, and that this fact invali
dates the whole act; that the reciprocity
clause is a delegation of the taxing power
to the President, therefore in violation of
the constitution, and this vitiates the whole
act; that the law is unconstitutional
because the tobacco rebate clause was
omitted from the hill signed by the Pres
ident.
There is still another ease before the
court attacking the constitutionality of the
act, because the bill was acted upon by less
than a quorum necessary to do business,
Speaker Reed having no authority to count
as present and taking part in the proceed
ings of the House those who declined to
vote.
The Governor of Virginia sent a special
message to the Legislature on Wednesday
in reference to the oyster interests of that
state. About the same condition of things
exists there as here in Maryland. The
oyster beds have been depleted and the
production has fallen off one-half in the
last ten years. The Governor recommends
a survey and platting of the grounds and
a rental for a period of ten years to the
highest bidder, also a culling law, except
ing all oysters under 21 inches, the pro
tection of planters and no oystering per
mitted, under severe penalties, between
sunset and sunrise. A revenue of 85,-
000,000 per annum, he thinks, may be
realized by the state. The interests of
tongers, dredgers and planters antagonize
each other, and the “oyster war” is likely
to rage as fiercely there as it does here.
The cupidity of the oystermen is certain to
destroy the oysters, and any legislation to
prevent it is certain to meet with their de
termined opposition.
Two political sensations occurred in New
York this week. One was the announce
ment by William J. O’Dair. who was elected
to the Legislature by a combination of
Republicans, County Democrats and Peo
pie’s Municipal that he would sup
port Democratic measures in the Assembly,
thus adding to the Democratic majority in
that body. The # other was the announce
ment that John Y. MeKane, who left the
Democratic party in 1888 and carried fifteen
hundred voters with him, and materially
aided in carrying the state for Harrison,
had returned to the Democratic fold.
Tho President’s Message.
President Harrison submitted his third
annual message to Congress on Wednes
day- It is voluminous and essentially a
business message, giving a resume of for
eign and domestic affairs, and containing
but few recommendations. Parts of it
are intended for political effect —those refer
e ing to the persecution of the Hebrews in
s Russia and the elevation of the Agricul
■: tural to an equality with other departments.
, The one is meant to catch the Hebrew
- vote, and the other to impress the farmer
with the distinguished consideration the
* Republican party has for him. The note
• of this government expressing “deep con
c cent” on a question of’ a purely domestic
• affair in Russia, was a piece of impertinent
J interference, and the change at the Agri
- cultural department is one in name only,
i so far as the lienefits to agriculture arc con
* eerned. The title of Commissioner has
- been changed to Secretary, the salary of
■ the office increased, and the Secretary has
I a scat at the farther end of the Cabinet
‘ table.
■ The message makes plain one fact—that
‘ is, our foreign affairs have been badly
J managed, and our jioliey has been an ag-
J gressive one of interference and intermed
- dling with the domestic concerns of other
■ governments and of extravagant and un
-1 tenable claims upon our part.
’ By claiming that which our country
' protested against when made by Russia,
3 concerning jurisdiction in Bering sea, the
■ Harrison Administration brought thiscoun
s try dangerously near an open rupture with
I Kngland. Bluster did not deter Lard
t Salisbury, and Mr. Blaine had to recede
• and consent to arbitration. President 11 ar
■ rlson devotes some attention to the Bering
P sea controversy, but he handles the subject
f carefully and omits important facts in the
l! case.
8 Then there Is the controversy with Italy,
II over the New Orleans lynching, the hasty
action of our officials encouraging the Ital-
M ian government to make claims that this
'* government had to deny; the Data affair—
*l our own courts deciding that the vessel’s
S detention was unlawful and consequently,
r * also, the subsequent chase and surrender;
the meddling with Chilian affairs by our
10 incompetent and indiscreet minister; the
h attack upon our sailors, the outcome of
d hostility engendered by the imprudence of
lt Minister Egan; the insolent protest against
1 ■ expulsion decrees by the Russian govern
ment; the interference of this government
r in a question of boundary between Gaule
h mala and the British government.
All these arc spoken of by President
L * Harrison, and he presents the facts in the
light most favorable to bis Administration,
b More controversies with foregn nations
>' have sprung up under the present Admin
istration than for some years past, and this
11 fact is sufficient evidence of the lack of
■ prudence and diplomatic ability on the
ri part of this government. Our own course
u is responsible for all of these international
* disputes.
s Upon the leading questions of the day—
• tariff and finance—the President is brief.
* He recommends that there be no legisla
* tion upon either. The country, he says,
1 is enjoying larger prosperity than ever
3 before, under the McKinley bill, and
quotes statistics to show that for the year
? ended September 30th, 1801, our exports |
s were some $02,000,000 greater than in the 1
• previous year, and of this increase about |
1 S 15,000,000 were in agricultural products. |
Whatever increase there has been in our
1 agricultural exports is due to abundant |
1 crops at home and short crops abroad. The ;
McKinley act is praised for the alleged
great prosperity of the country, the Presi
dent forgetting that in his Thanksgiving !
proclamation he said it was (oo great to be
. the work of man and ascribed it to an All- I
j wise God. And in his message the recip- j
\ rocal trade relations negotiated with Spain
f and several other countries are spoken of
with evident satisfaction, as contributing
to our prosperity, the President again for
getting that reciprocity is free trade, not !
I protect inn .
The latter portion of the message is de
, I voted to the subject of elections, and the
r President laments the failure of the Force
s bill in the last Congress. He says the
j. chief national danger lies in the suppression
y or perversion of the popular suffrage, and
r this in the face of the well-known fact that !
f he now holds the high office of President
B through purchased votes in “blocks of five,”
1 by a corruption fund raised by a Philadel
-8 phia merchant, who holds a cabinet position
as a reward for his part of the work.
Seeing that an overwhelming Democratic
c House and an increased Democratic vote
c in the Senate is an effectual bar to Force
is bills during this Congress, tho President
s says it would be possible to constitute a
it Hou-jHirttMun commission to consider the
[, evils of our election system and methods,
0 with a view to correcting or removing
them, and suggests that the constitution
would permit the selection of the commis
siou to be vested in the Supreme Court.
y Democrats remember too well the Bx7
1 commission of 1877, which suppressed the
8 popular and electoral verdict and defrauded
e Tilden out of the Presidency, to place con
c fidcnce in the non-partisan character of
2 the Supreme Court. They are no more to
s be trusted than other people—imbued
* with no more fairness and impartiality.
2 The 'message is devoid of anything of
' statesmanship, neither is it framed in clear,
■ forcible and expressive language. In ex
' pression it is common place. It is com
-1 prehensive, however, and business-like, and
’ for the grandson of his grandfather is very
2 good.
; On the matter of the civil service, Presi
dent Harrison, in his message, says “the
. law is being executed with impartiality.”
i This is a bold assertion, when it is remem-
bered that he delayed the putting of the
railway mail service under the civil service
law, in order to provide places for political
workers who were incompetent to pass the
r examination, and that dismissals were made
- after the law applied to the service and the
I discharges dated back to evade it. It will
f be remembered, too, that the civil service
| law was openly violated by Federal officials
■ ' in Baltimore, and the fact was duly inves
, | tigated by Civil Service Commissioner
i | Roosevelt, who reported to the President
-! and recommended the dismissal of certain
) j offenders. The result was that the offend
i era, all loud Harrison supporters, continue
r j in their snug berths, and Mr. Roosevelt
. came dangerously near b, ing invited to
I step down and out.
A Ridiculous Performance.
The Baltimore Sun a few weeks ago at
tempted to be facetious in au article on
the rural press, but succeeded only in being
insolent, and its vanity cropped out boldly
when it alluded to itself as the “leader”
and “teacher” and “guide,” of said press.
There is not a Democratic county paper in
the state that is not more consistent, fair
and logical, for the Svn has none of these
qualities. Dls purse-proud and arrogant,
wavering and uncertain.
On Monday it indulged in a double
leaded editorial on the Speakership. When
articles are thus printed it is done to give
them special prominence, and they are
supposed to bo duly weighed and consider
ed before publication. Here is an extract
from it:
“If those Democrats who are personally
hostile to Mr. Cleveland and would prefer the
nomination of some other candidate for the
presidency—or, if any person who himself
cherishes aspirations for the next Democratic
nomination —are seeking to influence the
election of Speaker for that purpose, they
have chosen an occasion for the promotion of
their private and personal aims and ambi
tions most unfortunate for themselves and
for the party. If those Democrats who would
like to seo free silver substituted as au issue
for tariff reform in 1802 imagine that they
can bring that result to pass by excluding
from the Speaker’s chair the Democrat whose
name is more conspicuously identified with
the cause of tariff reform before the entire
country than that of any oilier member of the
House, we can’t help thinking that that also
is a grave mistake in point of time and
method. The selection of a candidate for
Speaker should be kept clear from all such
unnecessary and dangerous complications.
It is Mr. Crisp’s misfortune, wholly unde
served it may be on his part, that his candi
dacy should have received such active sup
port, outside of the House, from men who
make no secret of their opposition to Mr.
Cleveland and of their preference for free
silver over tariff reform as a party issue in
the next election.”
It is thus intended to show that Mr.
Cleveland’s fortunes were bound up in the
result, and that the failure to elect Mr.
Mills, “whose name is more conspicuously
identified with the cause of tariff’ reform
than any other member of the House,
would be a set back for tariff reform. Mr.
Crisp’s election, it is intended to show,
would be in antagonism to Mr. Cleveland,
Ac., &c. The article was endeavored to in
fluence the Democrats of the House, and
the argument, or rather mere statements
and insinuations, it was supposed, would
cause a general rush to act on its views.
Mr. Crisp was chosen, however, and here
is another instance of the Sun s impotency
in Democratic counsels. Not only was
Crisp not defeated, but bis vote was in
creased by twenty-five, enough to elect
and more, and the two Democratic Con
gressmen from Baltimore even had the
temerity to vote for him from the begin
ning to the end of the balloting. The Sun
stood almost alone in giving to the contest
its presidential aspect and its tariff and
silver bearing, though on Tuesday, after
Mr. Crisp’s selection in the Democratic
caucus, it undertook to throw the respon
sibility upon others, and declared his
election had no party policy significance,
or that it was very slight. Here is an
extract from its Tuesday article:
“The significance of Mr. Crisp’s success,
from the point of view of paity policy, is prob
ably slight, though in the heat of the conflict
just closed the attempt was naturally made to
give it great importance. It was said by
some of Mr. Crisp’s opponents, in the ardor
of the struggle, that he was an anti-Cleveland
and anti tariff-reform man. This was warmly
denied by many of Mr. Crisp’s friends. It is
certain that he was supported for the speaker
ship by a number of out-and-out tariff-re
formers on the ground of personal liking
merely, or because he was thought to be bet
| ter fitted by temperament for the quasi judi
-1 ciul functions of presiding officer of the
House. The vote of 111) to 105, by which
Mr. Crisp defeated Mr. Mills, shows but a
narrow margin of preference for the Georgian
lover the Texan, even if the division were
i altogether upon radical differences of opinion.
It would therefore be absurd to try Iqjmport
into the result important political meanings
which from the nature of the case it cannot
I contain. Mr. Mills has been the more prom
inently associated in the public mind with the
1 issue of the day, but Mr. Crisp is also an out
spoken advocate of lower taxes. This was
i shown unmistakably in his speech last night
after being nominated, in which he declared
I to his fellow Democrats of the House that he
•would take no step backward in the cause
of tariff’ reform.’ ”
Proof vs. Assertion.
The Baltimore Herald , the best paper
for its price published, claims a large cir
culation, though it is not continually mak
ing extravagant claims on that point. The
American . a few weeks ago, published
some wild assertions about itself, which
every newspaper man smiled at, and the
Herald at once challenged them to a com
parison of circulation, offering to give the
American the selection of two of a commit
tee of three to inquire into the facts. The
Sun has recently indulged iu some talk
of papers of limited circulation, and straight
way the Herald challenged the Sun to a
comparison of city circulation. The Herald
offered to prove through a committee of
three, two to be of the Sun's staff", that the
Herald's circulation equals the Suns in
eleven wards, exceeds it in eleven wards,
and that the street sales are four times as
large as the Sun's. The Sun failed to accept.
It is so much easier to assert than to prove,
and the Sun prefers assertion to proof.
While on this matter of circulation it
has always seemed singular that adver
tisers do not ascertain what they are buy
ing when taking space in a journal. It is
rare that they ask the circulation of a
paper, and when they do it is rarer still
they ascertain the locality of it—whether
it is spread over the universe or is concen
trated mostly in the territory desired to
be reached. They usually pay the price
asked and trust to luck. They buy noth
ing else unless they know r what they are
to get, but when it comes to space in a
newspaper they go it blind, and many thou
sands of dollars are wasted annually in
advertising bills.
Governor Russell on the Democratic
Outlook.
Governor Russell of Massachusetts con
tributes to the December number of The
Forum an explanation of the recent growth
of the Democratic party in Massachusetts,
which, he maintains, is attributable to the
attitude of the party on the tariff and on
silver coinage. The Massachusetts Demo
crats have demanded a reduction in duties
on raw materials and have opposed the free
coinage of silver. Governor Russell does
not say that Massachusetts is yet a surely
Democratic state, but he docs say that if
the national Democratic platform next year
endorses the position of the Massachusetts
Democrats on these two important points,
he thinks the state can be carried by his
party. He quotes the last Massachusetts
Democratic platform on both these subjects
and explains how in all the recent state
campaigns Democratic workers have laid
their main emphasis on these points.
Winter Cheer.
Winter is here, and winter is the time
i for good cheer and home and fireside com
r forts. A few articles of prime necessity is
r all that is needed to carry us comfortably
! through the winter.
Man wants but little here below.
Nor wants that little long.
r Only about four-score or five-score years,
j Marylanders arc proverbial for well-filled
barns, garners, and larders. Maryland is
the cornucopia of Plenty. Her barns i
are full to overflowing and her presses
t burst out with new wine. The voluptuous
. epicures, and those who roll in wealth,
want many things to minister to their |
pampered tastes. But we speak ol the
L masses, not the money-bags. Well, let us
recount how little it takes for human com
fort, after all. ()nc can get through the
. winter very pleasantly, with something like

Disastrous Storms.
On December 4 a series of storms passed
over a portion of this country, carrying great
r destruction with it.
A violent wind storm, accompanied by lor
rents of rain, swept through the Cumberland
Valley, in Pennsylvania, doing great damage
e to property. At Shippensburg the round
i house of the Western Maryland Railroad, the
Cumberland Valley Railroad warehouse and
i other properly was demolished. A freight
e car was blown from the track at Kerrsvilte,
and at Carlisle a number of buildings were
- either wholly or partially wrecked. The dam
e age at Mechanicsburg v.l~ much more severe,
the Methodist church, Franklin Hall and
■ National Hotel being among the properties
L . destroyed. Several persons were injured, but
there was no loss of life. At Williamsport
I the storm was very violent. Many roofs were
- damaged, electric lighting disarranged and
several small bridges were washed from their
A foundations.
/ At Roanoke, Virginia, a building in course
i of construction was blown down. L. B. Her
ringe was killed and a man named Lovelace
li was very seriously injured,
j All the electric light poles on the east side
of First avenue, between Twenty-fourth and
5 Fortieth streets, in New York city, were blown
s down.
At Belvidere, N. J., it was reported to be the
• severest of the season, but no serious damage
i was done.
Much damage was done along the Hudson
river to shipping,
t The greatest snow blizzard for many years
in North Dakota ended on Saturday morning,
after having raged 48 hours. The therraome.
- ter was all the time below zero.
The blizzard in the Northwest on Frida}'
M crippled every railway line. At Northfield,
n Minnesota, the temperature fell 40 degrees
| within one hour, and the wind's velocity was
40 miles an hour. At Chicago the highest
r velocity was 54 miles an hour.
Buildings were unroofed and other damage
was done at Tipton, lowa, on Friday, by a
0 terrific rain and wind storm.
e A heavy storm prevailed on Monday over
the entire Northwest, from British Columbia
to the California line, and east to Montana.
3 In the Cascade Mountains a heavy fall of snow
| is reported, and trains were delayed, both on
II ; account of snow and falling timber. Tele
- graphic wires suffered the most damage.
i Great damage on Puget Sound is reported
1 j as the result of a storm on Monday. Several
i washouts were encountered on the Lake Shore
and Eastern Railroad, and trains were de
j layed.
The Greatest Known
Professor Horace Briggs, the well-known 1
e educator, of Buffalo, N. V., has arrived from
Japan. He was in Yokohama at the lime of I
1 the great earthquake, and immediately pro .
? ceeded to Nogoya and Gifu, where the shocks i
were most severe. After describing the scenes j
5 which have already been published, Professor
3 Briggs said:
“In the ruin of the postoflice at Nogoya, !
which was the only brick building in town, !
s twenty postal clerks were buried. The men j
e were assorting the morning mail when the ;
building toppled over upon them and buried
s them. Not one escaped.”
, Prof. Briggs went to Gifu, but the railroad
beds had been so badly wrecked that travel
• beyond was impossible. Immense crevices,
r from which hot mud and steam escaped, were
to be seen in all directions. During his stay
s there a Japanese, who had lost his wife in
, one of the crevices, went in search of her,
and while standing on the edge of the fisure,
• the earth crumbled beneath him and precipi
■> tated him into the unknown depths below.
. All of these crevices along the roadside have
since been bridged, but the danger from them
s is little lessened. Professor Briggs said :
j “I think this earthquake will be known as
one of the most violent that has occurred
during the Christian era.”

THE FORUM
is the most instructive, the most timely, the

The three groups of subjects of the coining

111. Theological Unrest —with all the so

great topics.
There is no other way whereby one may
get the ripest information about the great
problems of the time within so narrow a
