A Message of Faith
YV/OOimoW WILSON has said his last
W olllcia! word to Congress. His an
imal message, read before both branches
y?sterday because the sacrifice of his health
for his country's sake forbade its delivery j
in person, is re-ally his "hail and fare
well." After eight years, during which he
led this nation successfully through the
most turbulent times the world has known,
his task is all but complete. At last he Is
to have rest.
As a public document, the President's
final message to Congress will not rank
with the great state papers that he penned
when the world trembled on the brink of
fate. There was no reason why it should.
Inspiration of former communications to
the government s legislative branch was
lacking. The country is at peace, the great
work is finished, and the party of which
he has been thi.- central, dominant figure,
and about whom the maelstroms of political
and martial currents have eddied and
swirled, is about to surrender its power .
to the keeping of the party which fought I
him so perilously near t<> death. So. with !
tlie incentive lacking which in former davs ?
raise.! him to lofty heights, the future be- j
yon (I his formative guidance, the President
conllncd himself almost entirely to a brief
discussion of domestic issues, each of them
Important to a restored America, and each i
of them recommended by him on previous i
occasions only to be rejected by a hostile '
t'ongr.ss. His entire thought, so far as
Ins message shows, is for America. If there j
was in his mind as he penned his words a
thought of America's material leadership
in international affairs, of the league of
nations, v.hich he brought into being u:id
which now meets with America's chair vu- '
cant, he has given no sign.
it is as a human document that the mes- !
>ago will seize and hold the sympathetic
attention of the American people. It is no
longer the Wood row Wilson, fighting Presi
dent, battling leader of a dominant party
u..<. winner of a thousand legislative com- ;
hat-:, who is speaking. It is Wood row Wil- '
son. the retiring chieftain of a defeated
party, the broken man who made ail but
the supreme sacrifice, the man who has i
been hounded as no other President ever
was hounded, the weary, disappointed man, j
addresses himself to Congress and
through Congress to the. American people, j
.'her.- is no spirit of rancor, no word of
bitterness, no hiru of complaint. Tliero

A Philadelphia surgeon is responsible for
this "hurt, swift summing up of the question:
?A woman, f.>t and forty, who belches gas.
has gallstones." They don't generally settle
things so quickly as tjiai in Philadelphia,
though they arc keen on nptr.Uive procedures
there.
Somehow women are four times more fre
<iii<nil\ tho victims of gullsac iiillammation or
of gallstones than men. ?'oit<els. as 1 have
occasionally intimated, are ;i health-destroy
ing factor. When 1 say corsets I mean ab
dotninal splints merely, run tight lacing.
Typhoid fever is not the only bacterial in
fection of which gullsac inflammation or gall
stone disease is a common sequel. The liv
ing typhoid terms have been found in the ren
ter of gallstones thirty-live years after the
siege 01 typhoid fever, hut oth? r germs the
common staphylococci and screptococci of or
dinary inflammations and suppurations are
atso responsible i(! many cases. Tli.se germs
I.nd their way into the gallsac from tin blood.
..nd they reach the blood from some recognized
or unrecognized sent of long-standing infec
tion, such as diseased tonsil.*,, suppurating
gums, infected nasal sinuses, chronic Intestin
al infections, infected teeth.
Forty or thereabout is tn. typical gallstone
?<kc. Not that a man in any more susceptible
to any health Impairment than a woman is at
forty <>r llfty; not that there is one iota of
sense in the notion that health impairments
inevitably come to any man or woman merely
as a feature of middle age. Gallstone* occur
commonly enough in persons fifteen, twenty
or twenty-five years of age. goodness knows.
Tt is at about the age of forty that itiiut
cases come under medical observation. As a
lule. the victim has been quarreling with

him. For the old sultan is dead and MeClain

MeClain wrote the department that he was
the man referred to and he has Juat received

death and sayi:fr that his claim would be
referred to the Bureau of insular Affairs,
which would advise him later.

?M KM I'll IS. TKNN., Dec. 7.?A re
duction of at least oO per cent in the
?'otton ncreagi- In I!?'JI anil a crop of
not more than 6.000,000 bales was
|>ri'Uk'tc<t !>>? \V. H. Thompson, formi-r
president of (he New Orleans Cotton
t.vchungc in an address today before
the cotton conference here, called to
inaugurate a campaign Tor a material
cotton acreage reduction anil crop
diversification during t ll?> coining;
planting season.
"The south is determined to re
duce the cotton acreage in 1921 to ai
least one-half of that of last year."
Colonel Thompson said. "This will
mean that the coming crop will be
reduced to C.OUO.000 hales or less. Tile
convention hero Is called for the
purpos; of solidifying this determi
nation and serving notice on the
world that the cotton producing
bouth will no longer perinit its chief
agricultural asset to be slaughtered
and its producers impoverished by
any combination of circumstances or
Interests whatsoever."
After outlining the course of the
market In iv? ?-iit rnc.nlito. I'olr.ac!
Thompson declared the reduction
movement was made necessary by
"the ap|ialliiiK decline in prices, due.
we are told by aploglsts. for the ruth
loss deflation campaign, t'? over pro
duction."
"In spite of the fact that in the
sprint; the farmers wore urged and
I'licouriiRcil hv iliiancial authorities
at Washington to produce all the cot
ton possible," Colonel Thompson con
tinued, "we are. after the price lias
declined to figures which represent
less than one-hall actual cost of pro. j
duct ion. told that we have produced'
too much anil must stand the. oortse- i
interiors of such over-production "
"The answer to this is that we will
hold tIKht to every bale of the so
called surplus and that we will re
duce the next crop to proportions
which will stamper those who wou'd
rcduco the cotton producer to a con
dition of destitution.
"I.et the Word prepare itself for a
i, i.no.ono or 6,'iOO.t'Oi) bale crop In
li'21."

Though chosen with tast? und fas
tidious care,
Ami it Isn't tho price that you paid;
It isn't tho sIbo of your pile In the
bank.
Nor tlto number of acres you own,
Jt Isn't a question of prestige or rank.
Nor of stnow and muscle and bono;
It isn't the servants that como at
your call,
Tt Isn't the things you possess,
Whether many or little?or nothing
at all,
It's service that measures success.
It isn't a tjucstlon of name, or of
length
Of. an ancestral pedigree,
Nor a intention of montal vigor and
strength.
Nor a question of Aoclal degree;
It isn't a question of city or town.
Nor a question of doctrine or creed.
It isn't a question of fame or renowicu
Nor a question of valorous deed;
Hut he who makes somebody happjr
oadt day,
And bo who gives heed to dlatretss.
Will lind satisfaction tho rlcboat o?
pny.
For It's servlco that measures iraivi
cc?s.
