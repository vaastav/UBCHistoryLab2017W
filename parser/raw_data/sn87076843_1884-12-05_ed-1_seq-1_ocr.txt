as to secure to the cltlicns of tmhercoUutrj'i

also been concluded. Tho war between
Chill nnd Peru Is nt an end.. 1'or the arbitra
tion of the claims of Ainerlcnn citizens who
during Its contlnunncc suffered through tho
acts of tho Chilian authorities, a convontlon
will soon bo negotiated. The stnto of hostil
ities between Franco and China still contin
ues to bo an cmbarrneMng fenturo of our
Eastern relations. The Chlncso Government
has promptly adjusted and paid tho claims
of American citizens whose property wnsde
stroyed in tho recent riots nt Canton. I re
new tho recommendation of niv last annual
message that the Canton Indemnity found be
returned to China. Tho two Intcrprctntlou
of tho recent treaty with that country per
mitting tho restriction of Chlncso Immigra

whether the statuto passed at tho last ses

tain Chlncso who left this country with re
turn certificates held under tho old law, and
now seem to bo prevented from landing from
lack of certificates required by tho new.

commercial importance in the East. In view,

COJCClO BASIN.
Pursuant to the advice of the Scnnto at the
last session I rccojrnlzcd tho flag of tho In
ternational Association of' tho Congo nsthat
of a friendly government, avoiding In so
aoing any prejudgment or conuict. in ter
ritorial claims In that region, and subse
quently, in execution of tho expressed ulsh
of tho Congress, I nppolnted a commercial
agent for tho Congo basin. Tho Importance
of tho rich prospective trade of tho Congo
Valley has led to tho general conviction that
It should be open to all nations upon equal
terms. In tho International Conferenco for
the consideration of this subject, called by
tho Emperor of Germany, nnd nowln session
nt Berlin, delegates aro In attendance on bo
half of the United States. Of tho result of
the Conference )ou 111 bo duly advised.
Tho Government of Coron has generously
nlucd the efforts of tho United States Minister
to socuro suitable premises for tbo usoof
tho legation. As the conditions of diplo
matic Intercourse with Eastern nations de
mand that tho legation premises bo owned
by tho represented power, I advlso thnt an
appropriation bo mado for tbo acquisition of
this property by tho Govcrnmont. Tho
United States already possesses valuable
premises at Tangier ns a gif t from tho Sultan
of Morocco, and, as is stated hereafter, they
havo lately received n similar gift from tho
Slamcso Government. Tho Government ot
Japan stands ready to rent to us extensive
grounds ntTokio, wherein to erect a sultablo
building for tho Legation, n court houso and
Jail, and similar privileges can probably bo
secured In China and I'ersin. Tho owning of
such premises would not only effect a largo
saving of tho present rentals, but would
.permit of tho duo assertion of extra terri
torial rights In tbeso countries, and would
tho better servo to maintain tho dignity of
thn United States.
Tho failure of Congress to make nn appro
priation for our rcnrnsentntlon nt tho Auton
omous Court of tho Khcdlvo has proved a
serious embarrassment in our lntcrcourso
with Egypt; nnd In vlow of the necessary
Intimacy of diplomatic relationship, duo to
tho participation of this Government as ono
of tbo treaty powers In nil matters of admin
istration there affecting tho rights of for
eigners, I advlso tho restoration of tho
Aironcyand Consulnto General at Cairo on
Its former basis. 1 do not conceive it to bo
inowisn or congress tnat tno united states
should withdraw altogether from tho honor

respect to tho Khedive, or that citizens of
this ltepubllo residing or sojournlngln Egypt
should hereafter bo without tho nld and pro
tection of a competent representative,

With Franco tho traditional cordial rela
tionship continues. Tho Ilnrtholdl Statue of
Liberty Enlightening tho World, tho gener
ous gift of tho pcoplo of France, Is expected
t reach Now York In May next I suggest
that Congressional action bo taken In rela
tion to tho spirit which has prompted this
flft, nnd In aid of tho timely completion of
bo pedestal upon which It is to bo placed.
Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes to our own some of tho
best elements of citizenship, contlnuo to bo
cordial. Tho United States havo extradition
troatlos with soveral of tho German States,
but by reason of tho confederation of theso
States under tho Imperial rule, tho applica
tion of such treaties Is not as uniform and
comprehensive ns tho Interests of the two
countries require. I proposo therefore, to
opon negotiations for a single convention of
extradition to cmbruco all tbo territory of
tho Empire.
It affords me pleasure to say that our Inter
course with Great Britain continues to bo of
a most friendly character. Tbo Government
of Hawaii has Indicated its willingness to
contlnuo for soven years tho provisions of
tho existing reciprocity treaty. Such con
tinuance, in vlow of tbo relations of that
country to tho American system of States,
should In my Judgment be favored.
Tho revolution In Ilayti against tho estab
lished Government has terminated. While It
was In progress It became necessary to en
force our neutrality laws by Instituting pro
ceedings against Individuals and essols
charged with their Infringement. Tho prose

Much anxiety hns lately boon displayed by
various European Governments, and es
pecially by tho Government of Italy, for tha
abolition ot our Import dutlos upon works
of art. It is well to consider whether tho
present discrimination In favor of produc
tions of American artists abroad Is not likely
to result, as thoy themselves soom very gen
erally to bcllovo It may, in tbo practical ex
clusion of our painters and sculptors from
tho rich fields for observation, study aud
labor which thoy hav o hitherto enjoj ed.
Tboro Is prospects Uiut the long pending
revision of the foreign trcatlosof Japan may
bo concluded at a now conferenco to bo held
atTokio. Whllo this Government fully recog

tho general adoption of Buch terms of oom-
Froinlso as Japan may bo disposed to offer In
urtheranoo ot u uniform policy of lntor

During tbo past year tbo increasing good

The treaty ot commercial reciprocity oonolu

tho past year tho attention of Congress was
drawn to tho formal Invitations In this regnrd

Tbo Executive has In some instances np

I recommend that thoscopoof tho neutral

as to cover all patent acts of hostility com

prohibit tho fitting out of armed expeditions

obligations, but simply tor tbo protection of

NATURALIZATION LAWS.
Our oxlstlng naturalization laws also need
revision. Thoso sections relating to persons
residing within the limits ot tho United
Statos ill 1793 and 17113 havo now only u histor
ical Interest. Section 2172 recognizing tho
citizenship of tho children of naturalized
parents Is ambiguous In Its terms and partly
obsolete. There nro special provisions of
tbo law favoring tho naturalization of thoso
who servo In tho army or In morchaut ves
sels, whllo no similar privileges are granted
thoso who servo In tho Navy orin tho Marino
Corps, and a uulforin rule of naturalization
suoh as the Constitution contemplates
should, among other things, clearly define
tho status of persons born wlthlu tho United
Statos subject to a foreign power Section

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Of tho varied Governmental concerns In

port of Its Secretary presents an Interesting
summary. Among the topics described with
particular attention 1 refer jou to hlsobscr
rations respecting our Indian affairs, tho pre
emption and timber culture nets, tho failure
of railroad companies to tako tltlo to lands
granted by tho Government, nnd tho opera
tions of tho Pension Ultlco, tho 1'utcut

Tho report of the Utah Commission will bo
rend with Interest. It discloses tho results
of receut legislation looking to tho preven
tion and punishment of polvgnmy In thut
Territory. I still bellevo that It that abomi
nable practice can be suppressed by law It
can only bo by the roost radical legislation
consistent with the restraints of the Consti
tution. 1 ugaln recommend, therefore, thut
Congress assume absolute political control
of tho Territory of Utah and.provldo for tbo

In the course ot this communication refer

How under conditions thnt will equalize or

First. A series of reciprocal commercial

Secondly. The establishment of tho Con

respects vessels carrying goods entitled to

Thirdly. Tho enactment of measures to
favor tho construction nnd maintenance of a

Fourthly. Tho establishment of n uniform

so that the coined products of our mines

tho whole system of Commonwcnlths.
