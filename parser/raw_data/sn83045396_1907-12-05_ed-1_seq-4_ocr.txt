THE BUBEATJ OF MINES.
The recommondation of President
Roosuvclt. in his message to Congress
in favor o the creation of n Bureau
of Mines under the control and direc
tion of the Secretary of tho Interior,
will moot with henrfj' rcsponso through
out, all this Western country, and very
hkcJy will bo favorably racoived
throughout tho country at large, as it
certainly ought lo be. Those who op
poso it will be, the windy speculators,
the shnrpors, nnd tho complacent, self
suffieiejil absorbers of money in Xcw
York City who do not care anything
about any American industry, except
as they can exploit it to their own
advantage. A Bureau of Mines prop
erly conducted would give the Amer
ican people a great and trustworthy
view of the vrholo mining situation at
all times, nnd would liavo surveys, rec
ords, and geological investigations on
file that would provo valuablo to the
I The Bureau of Mines would naturally
i and speedily grow far be3'ond tlio lim
i its outlined by President Roosevelt in
his mcssago. nis idea i3 that this bu
reau should "include statistics, make
investigations in all matters pertaining
to mines, and particularly to tho acci
dents and dangers of tho indusUy."
That surely would bo one important
function of the bureau, but far aud
i away beyond this it should have know
edge at hand with regard to all the
important initio deposits of the county-and
details of all operated mines. It
should havo special experts investigat
ing mineral deposits, proving their ex
tent and quality, and indicating by tho j
scientific explorations and surveys of
mineral deposits, including metals of
all kinds, carbonaceous deposits, hydro
carbons, oils, tho situation of mineral
bearing strata, and everything now
mined of value, or . that could bo
mined of value to the pcoplo at larue
or to the country. And we should ex
pect to sco. this bureau grow into a
Dopartment with a Secretary at the
head of it. precise! as tho Department
of Agriculture qrew from the small be
ginning of a division .in tho Interior
Department, then a Bureau, and finally
a separate Department, with a Secre
tary at tho head a member of the Pres
idential Cabinet.
The limited function outlined for
such a bureau b' the President would
certainly be useful, but naturally there
would grow from it a wonderful in
crease of opportunities and usefulness.
Tho geological survey of tho country
would naturally bo found under the
control of this Department of Mines
when it is created, nnd that is a matter
of tho very highest importance to tho
whole country. The work of tho geo
logical exports is especially valuable in
tho mining industry; and a thorough
ecological survey of the whole country
would be of immense benefit to All. The
idea will no doubt develop from the
Bureau of Mines into tho Department
of Minos far morn rapidly than any
other bureau has so devclopnd in the
history of the country: because, when
tho Bureau of Aline? is opened it will
be so thronged with business, with the
addition of matter that is no appropri
ate to tho work of such Bureau, that
it will speedily bo found that it is a
mere beginning of tho great work lo
bo done, lint tho fact that- it is a
beginning is the main point, aud so we
woliSbmc the President's suggestion and
aro sure that it will bo supported loy
ally throughout tho mining regions of
the country, and should b by every
body. And there is no reason why it
should not take actual form at tho
present session of Congress.
A QUEER RECOMMENDATION.
One of the most surprising sugges
tions thatvhas boon made in roecnUtitues
in' connection with politics, is that found
in President Roosevelt 's message recom
mending that Congress make appropri
ation of funds for the legitimate ex
penses of each of the great National
parties; "an appropriation amplo
enough to meet tho necessity for thor
ough organization of-machincry, which
requires a large expenditure of money."
It will be extremely difficult to con
vince the country oi tho propriety of
such expenditure of the public money
as this. Asido from the fact that it
'would be an open bid for the formation
of an immense number of so-called Na
tional parlies, it would bo a constant
temptation on the part of tho party in
power to appropriate to itself large sums
of money, and hold tlic opposition party
down to a starvation basis. Obviously
it would not do to appropriate tho
money merely to the "two great
parties," because any National party
is just as much entitled to such recog
nition and appropriation as any other.
The Populist part.v, the Socialist party,
the Social Democrats, the Prohibition- J
ists, mid a multitude of other parties
that would no doubt be organized upon
the creation of any such a custom on
the part of Congress, would speedily
make demaud upon tho treasury. And
it would bo difficult, even with the np- I
propriation made, lo restrict the free
dom of giving by zealous party men
who could afford it. Tho likelihood that
such an appropriation would diminish
tlio usual campaign funds materially is
-not great.
By the very terms of the President's
recommendation that nothing but the
most necessary campaign expenses'
would be met by the proposed Congres.
sionnl appropriation, there would spring
up right there and at once a wranglo as
to what comprises tho necessary cam
paign expenses; and it "would be dif
ficult to say that ono party should have
more llma'anothcr. It ivould hardly do
to say that because one party had a
1 very largo vote that therefore its es
pouses were greater and that it should
havo moro money than tho parties cast
ing a smaller vole; tho fair argument
'would follow that with proper recogni
tion, tho voto would bo larger. Wocan
sco roadily that such appropriation by
Congross would bo a trcmcndouB factor
in croating now National parties of va
rious kinds, but othorwiuo wo aro not
nble to boo whore it would do any good
or would amount to anything in tho pur
ification of politics, tho keeping down
of campaign expenses, or tho prevention
of thoso who were supposed to bo espec
ially interested in tho policies of any
party from holding up corporations for
what might bo supposed lo bn "a fair
contribution," and of gotting tho
"fat."
Wo can hardly imagine Congress pay
ing any sorious attention lo this recom--mendation
of President Roosevelt.
i SENATOR HOPKINS ROUTED.
j Papers from Illinois aro at band
showiug the encounter at Piano, Illinois,
between Senator Hopkins and Elder
Cooper. It appears that the proceed
ing's wore at the Maramcch club; that
Elder Cooper read certain portions of
tho Snioot testimony in which Smoot
declared his belief in tho divinity of
tho revelation commanding polygamy.
Hopkins doniod Cooper's claim, and de
clared that no such tostimony had been
delivered. Elder Coopor thereupon
quoted from the record, showing .that
ho was exactly right nnd that Hopkins,
iu denying tho officinl procedure and
testimony as printed, was clearly in tho
wrong. That is to say, Hopkins did not
know what ho was talking about, and
wjien ho denied tho record he was
speedily put to rout. '
Tho proceedings occurred at a ban
quet of tho Maramcch Club, at which
the Piano church ladies served an elab
orate menu. In his remarks before the
club, Senator Hopkins repeatod what ho
had ea'ul about. Smoot being a polyga- I
mist, and claimed that Smoot "has
done more tliau any other ono hundred
men iu Utah to blot out tho practice of
polygamy," and all that sort of rub
bish. In this Hopkins modified his pro
Sinoot claim by ninety per cent. In his
speech to tho Senate, Hopkins said that
Smoot. had done moro than any thou
sand other men to beat down polygamy.
lildcr Cooper replied at once, being
fully prepared. Ilo literally and abso
lutely demolished Hopkins for donying
tho verified testimony that Smoot had
delivered. Hopkins, in a burst of
fraudulent indignation at beiug as
sailed falsely, had got away with the
situation until Elder Cooper caino back
at him and road tho record, which ut
terly confounded Hopkins.
It is really remarkable that. Senator
Hopkins would put himself in such a
position as he did at Piano. Ho gavo
every candid hearer tho impression that
he was a fakir, a pretender, a fraud.
Ho bolstered his caso up with false
Jioods and with assumptions that had
no possible foundation, just as ho had
dono iu his speech in the Senate in
Snioot "a favor. Of course Snioot. has
never said anything against polygamy;
of course ho testified to tho divinity
of the polygamy revelation; of course
Smoot never delivered any anti-polygamy
speech; he would not dare to de
liver any such speech now. The whole
foundation for Hopkins's argument is
based ou utter falsity, and it is sur
prising that he has tho effrontery lo go
before tho people of Illinois with his
false pretenses, unfounded assumptions,
and direct falsehoods in support of his
wretchedly bad case.
TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL, BOTH
Notwithstanding tho fact that it has
reiterated it time nnd lime over, tho
Doscrot Is'cws on Monday returned to
its old falsehood in denial of the pro
phetic claim to tho right of universal
dictation. So many iiuics have wo ex
posed the utter untruth of tho News in
this matter that it seems almost un
necessary to tako further notice of it;
but tho evident vicious intention of the
anti-Christian organ to deceive the pub
lic justifies tho following quotation from
its editorial columns, together with our
subsequent proof and comment:
Finally. It Is not true that Prcfeldent
Joseph F. Smith has claimed the divine
rljjht to "rule this people In all things."
Of course, the Dcseret Nows remem
bers well enough that Joseph F. Smith 's
own uttorances are in direct contradic
! linn of its entirely stupid assertion; but
I that, would in no wise deter it from ro
peating a threadbare falsehood. Tt
knows that President Smith has de
clared in a sermon that "any man who
says you can direct me spiritually, but
not temporally, lies in the presence of
God that is, if he has got intelligence
enough to know what ho is talking
about." A charge of falsehood, in view
of these two contrnry statements, must
necessarily Iio against either the Dcs
eret News or Joseph V, Smith; and as
lo which of tho two should bear the,
onus of the offending, there are already
so many black marks against both that
a fow more ou the account of either
would make but little dill'crcncc.
Then there is the explanation Which
President Smith very recently mado to
tho Pittsburg Times, which wo copy as
fnllnwa-
Our church differs from other churches,
In that it looks after tho temporal ns
well as tho spiritual wclfaro of Ita peo
ple. losepli F. Smith is the supreme head
of the church; his word is final in all
things; whether the matter in hand lie
of a religious, or a business, or a politic
al nature. Smith's decision can not be
appealed from. Logically, then, the
president of the church docs "rule this
people in all things." The Dcseret
News will not deny that he is tho final
authority in the church upon religious
questions, so that it must admit that
ho rules in this particular. Tho prophet
lias warned his peoyde that they must
refuso to sell lauds or cucourauu Gen
tiles, which is a temporal matter; ho
hns threatened to crush certain of his
followors if they persisted iu engaging
in an enterprise which canto into com
petition witli tho business of n church
corporation, which is also temporal; ho
has ougaged the funds of tho church
(colloctod solely for religious purposes,
according to tho understanding of the
contributors) in commercial couccrns,
which is another temporal pursuit; and
tho volumo of ovidonco in this respect
is almost inexhaustible. So that tho
News can not mako consistent or truth
ful denial that the prophet also rules
in tin's particular. Wo can show by
church publications that Joseph l'
Smith has repeatedly directed the votes
of his followers to an object desired by
himself, which is certainly )olitical;
that ho has authorized ecclesiastical
supportorB to instruct tho pooplo in tho
massing of their uuitcd strength upon
ono party or another, according to his
own schemes, which is likowiso a mat
ter political; that ho procured tho elec
tion of two United Statos Senators in
Utah, which also comes under tho head
of politics. Bosidcs, wo can show by
tho columns of tho Deaerct News itself
(sco tho issuo of December C, 1000,)
that Joseph P. Smith spoke upon poli
tics in the Tabernaclo, and that during
his sermon ho made refnronco to tho
matter of selection of desirnblo men to
voto for; and that upon this subject he
said :
When I get the- word of ths Lord ns
to who Is tho right man, will I obey It.
no mattor if It docs como contrary to
my convictions?
Thorc is no end of proof that Joseph
F. Smith claims the "divine right, to
rulo this pooplo in all things." If bo
did not, ho would ho proceeding to cast
aside the most cherished special privi
lege that has boon claimed by himself
and all tho other pretended prophets of
Mormondom, who havo gone beforo him.
To do that, ho is both too great a
fanutic and too selfish, of ppwer and
pelf.
THE FLITTLNG OF THE FLEET.
In his message to Congress President
Roosevelt, enters upon an olaborato apol
ogy for his order of sending the fleet
of battleships to the Pacific. The rea
sons ho urges aro plausible enough, and
probably no ono would feel like find
ing special fault with them. At the
same time it is clear that, tho real
thing to do is to have as large a fleet
as is necessar, both in the Atlantic
and in tho Pacific; for if we should
havo any trouble with any nation of
Europo requiring tho presence of the
fleet in tho Atlantic, thcro would not
be time fo draw from the Pacific the
necessary reinforcements. This is ob
vious under the present conditions. Tho
voyage around Capo Horn by a war
fleet is an arduous, a doubtful, a risky
trip. We havo not had tho experience
bo far of sending a war fleet around
tho Horn. It may well be that thorc
will be damage and loss in the trip as
ordorod. It is true that tho Oregon
mado her grent'voyagc from San Fran
cisco to Florida around tho Horn with
safety, and that the speed was admira
ble. It is hardly to be expected, how
ever, iu sending a whole fleet on that
same voyage, that, all the vessels will
escape as well as did the Oregon.
Even when tho isthmian canal is
finished, there would still bo scant time,
and thore would certainly be great risk,
in seuding vessels from the Pacific to
the Atlantic' in caso of need. And if
the policy shall bo continued of keeping
only a few ships on the West coast;
oar West const will be defonselcss in
case of attack from any great nation on
tho Pacific. Groat. Britain overmatches
us all the time there, and so does Jap
an; but we should havo a forco con
stantly in the Pacific that would be a
match for any combination likely lo bo
brought against us on the Western
waters.
The very best thing to do with re
gard to this fleet when it gets around'
lo tho Pacific, is to let it stay there;
nnd then add largo navy yards. dry
docks, and every appurtenance and fa
cility for the building of moro ships
and kocping thoso already built up to
tlio highest, stale of efficiency. Then
all the navy yards on the Atlantic
const should bo made busy in building
now ships and replenishing the loss of
tho battleships on tho East coast that
have been sent to tho West. - With a
fleet on tho Atlantic which would bo of
greater strength than tho Pacific licet
wlujn re inforced by tho ships that Ad
miral Evans will couduct to tho West
coast, the country will be in a well
balanced condition to meet foes on
either shore; and that is exactly what
wo should bo at all times. Wc should
keep our naval strength on both consts
up to tho point of being sufficient to
meet any combination that would be
:n tho least likely to bo hostile. With
an ample fleet it would not bo neces
sary to maintain a great army. But
tho army should als.o be kept up lo
greater strength than it is, and should
bo so organizeij that it could bo quad
rupled on a thirty-day call.
Tho President's excuse for sonding
the Heel to the Pacific is all right
enough, provided that fleet remains
there. If it is to be taken back, then
it is more in the nature of a fool
hardy adventure thnn a matter of
State policy or actual naval drill av'.
