PRESIDENT'SMESSAGE
President Roosevelt's annual message
has IPPCI] delivered TD congress. Open
ing with a plea fur tin- co-operation of
nil classes In continuing tin* country's
prosperity ami in correcting existing
evils, for a "square ileal" for every
body. tin? message first takes up the
question of eorporatlons ami railroad
rate legislation. The president says:
Corporal lonN.
1 it in ill no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This is mi age of continuation,
nuil any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but in the
end vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce
law Inevitably produces. The corpora
tion has come to stay, just as the
trades union has come to stay. Each
can do and has done great good. Each
should lie favored so long as It does
good. But each should lie sharply
checked where It acts against law and
Justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
that it Is useless to try to get any ade
quate regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by state ac
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by n
sovereign whose Jurisdiction Is coex
tensive with the Held work of the cor
porations—that Is, by the national gov
ernment. I believe that this regulation
mul supervision can be obtained by the
enactment of law by the congress. If
this proves Impossible, It will certainly
be necessary ultimately to confer In
fullest form such power upon the na
tional government by affirmative ac
uient of the constitution.
The laws of Ihe congress anil of the
so vera. states hitherto, as passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
In showing tliut the states have 110
power In the matter than that the na
tional government has power; so that
there at present exists n very unfortu
nate condition of things, under which
these great corporations doing an In
terstate business occupy the position of
subjects without a sovereign, neither
any state government nor tho nationnl
government having effective control
over them. Our steady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered
In, to adsert the sovereignty of the na
tional government by uffirmntlve ac
tion.
This Is only in form an innovation.
In substance It is merely a restoration,
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized In the action of the law
making bodies, and nil that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions In
supli manner ns will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always itossessed, not only In this coun
try, bnt also In England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
Itailroad Rate Legislation.
As I said in my message of Dec. 0
last, the immediate and most pressing
need so far as legislation is concerned
is the enactment into law of some
scheme to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged in inter
state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
include putting a complete stop to re
bates In every shape nud form. This
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powers over the business world, should
be exercised with moderation, caution
and self restraint, but it should exist,
so that It can be effectively exercised
when the need arises.
11l my Judgment, tlio most important
provision which such law should con
tain is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power
to decide upon the case being brought
before it whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
Just, and if it is found to be unreason
able and unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to prescribe
the limit of rate beyond which it shall
not be lawful to go—the maximum
reasonable rate, as it Is commonly call
ed—this decision to go into effect with
in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low a rate.
In such case the commission would
have the right to fix this already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
and ft would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to cure
railroad companies of the practice of
giving Improper minimum rates. I call
your attention to the fact that my pro
posal is not to give the commission
power to initiate or originate rates gen
erally, but to regulate a rate already
fixed or originated by the roads upon
complaint and after investigation. A
heavy penalty should be exacted from
any corporation which falls to respect
an order of the commission. I regard
this power to establish a maximum
rate as being essential to any scheme
of real reform in the matter of railway
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether
it wonld not be wise to confer on the
government the right of civil action
against the beneficiary of a rebate for
nt least twice the value of the rebate.
Tills would help Btop what is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should
|>e stopped, for they have now grown
feo such an extent that they are demor
alizing and are used as rebates.
Private Car Lines,
i All private car lines, industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
should be expressly put under the su
jpcrvlslon of the Interstate commerce
commission or some similar body so
far ns rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates ere concerned. A re
hate la icing charges or in fc&soge or In
t division of the rate for refrigerating
charges is Just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way.
There should lie publicity of the ac
counts of common carriers. Only in
iiis way can violations or evasions o?
tiie law lie surely detected. A system
of examination of railroad accounts
should be provided similar to that now
conducted into the national banks by
die bank examiners. A few tlrst class
railroad accountants, If they bad prop
tr direction and proper authority to in
spect books and papers, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola
tions of the law.
Employers' Liability Law.
In my annual message to the Eifty*
eighth congress at Its second session I
recommended the passage of an em
ployers' liability law for the District of
Columbia and In our navy yards. X re
newed that recommendation in my
message to the Eifty-eighth congress at
Its second session anil further suggest
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of em
ployers' liability with a view to the en
actment of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
nil industries within the scope of the
federal power. I hope that such 11 law
will IK- prepared and enacted as speed
ily as possible.
There has lieen demand for depriving
courts of the power to issue Injunctions
In labor disputes. Such special limita
tion of the equity powers of our courts
would bo most unwise. It Is true that
r.oine judges have misused this power,
Aut this does not justify a denial of the
power any more than an Improper ex
ercise of the power to call a strike by a
labor leader would Justify the denial of
the right to strike. The remedy Is to
reguiate the procedure by requiring the
Judge to give due notice to the adverse
parties before granting the UTlt, the
hearing to tie ex parte If the adverse
party does not nppenr at the time and
place ordered. What Is due notice must
depend UIHMI the facts of the case. It
should not ho used as a pretext to iier
nilt violation of law or the Jeopardiz
ing of life or property. Of course this
would not authorize the issuing of a
restraining order or Injunction In any
case in which it Is not already author
ized by existing law.
I renew the recommendation I made
In my last annual message for an In
vestigation by the department of com
merce and labor of gencrnl labor condi
tions, especial attention to be paid to
the conditions of eh IUI laltor and child
labor legislation in the several states.
Such nn investigation should tnke Into
account the various problems with
which the question of child labor is
connected. In such a republic as ours
the one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect is the problem of turning out
decent citizens. The future of the na
tion depends upon the citizenship of
the generations to come. The children
of today are those who tomorrow will
shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The leg
islature of Colorado has recommended
that the national government provide
some general measuro for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what I
trust will be your favorable consider
ation.
A* to Women Who Work.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough Inves
tigation of the conditions of women In
Industry. Over G,(HX).OOO American wo
men are now engaged in gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth-of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important ns It is vast and
complicated. The introduction of wo
men into industry is working change
and disturbance In the domestic and
social life of the nation. Tho decrease
In marriage, nud especially In the birth
rate, has been coincident with It. We
must face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
be made, but surely it can lie made
with less friction nud less harmful ef
fects on family life than is now the
case. This whole matter In reality
forms one of the grentest sociological
phenomena of our time. It Is a social
question of the tlrst importance, of far
greater importance than any merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer and employee inter
ested, but also a third party—the gen
eral public. Every considerable labor
difficulty in which interstate commerce
is involved should be investigated by
tho government and tho facts officially
reported to the public.
Insurance.
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose business has extended so far
beyond the Jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
Strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In my
last annual message I recommended
"that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
tions In insurance." Recent events
have emphasized the Importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
this question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been ablo
to furnish agnlnst corruption of the
flagrant kind which lias been exposed.
It has been only too clearly shown
that certnin of tbe men at the head of
these large corporations take but small
note of the ethical distinction between
Boncsty and dishonesty. They draw
the line only this side of what jnny be
called law honesty, the kind of honesty
necessary In order to avoid falling into
the clutches of the law. Of course tho
only complete remedy for this condi
tion must be found In nn aroused pub
lic conscience, a higher sense of ethical
conduct in the community nt large and
•specially among business men and In
the great profession of the law, and in
the growth of a spirit which condemns
all dishonesty, whether in rich man or
In poor man, whether It takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much
can be done by legislation which Is not
only drastic, but practical. There is
need of n far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast Insurance
interests of this country. The Cuiteil
States should In this respect follow the
policy of other nations by providing
adequate national supervision of com
tuerclal Interests which arc clearly na
tional In character.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should consider
whether the federal government has
any power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions In In
surance of an Interstate character.
That state supervision has proved in
adequate Is generally conceded.
The Revenues.
There Is more need of stability than
of the attempt to attain an ideal per
fection In the methods of raising rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
business world certain to attend any
serious change In these methods ren
der such change Inadvisable unless for
grave reason. It is not possible to lay
down any general rule by which to de
termine the moment when the reasons
for will outweigh the reasons against
such a change. No change can lie
made on lines beneficial to or desired
by one section or one state only. There
must lie something like a general agree
ment among the citizens of the several
states that the change Is needed and
desired In the Interest of the people as a
whole, and there should then be a sin
cere, intelligent and disinterested ef
fort to make It In such shape as will
combine, so far as possible, the maxi
mum of good to the people at large
with the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special interests of locali
ties or classes, but In time of i>cace
the revenue must, on the
taking a series of years together, equal
the expenditures or else the revenues
must be Increased. Last year there
was a deficit. Unless our expenditures
can be kept within the revenues then
our revenue laws must l>s readjusted.
It is Impossible to outline what shape
such n readjustment should take, for
It Is as yet too early to say whether
fliero will be need for It. It should bo
considered whether It Is not desirable
that the tariff laws should provide for
applying as against or In favor of any
other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
treatment between other nations and
ourselves.
Economy In Expenditures.
I earnestly recommend to the con
gress the need of economy and, to this
end, of n rigid scrutiny of appropria
tions. All unnecessary offices should
be alwllshed. In the public printing
nlso n large saving of money can be
made. There Is a constantly growing
tendency to publish masses of unim
portant Information at which no human
being ever looks.
Yet, In speaking of economy, I must
In nowise bo understood as advocating
the false economy which Is In the end
the worst extravagance. To cut down
In the navy would be n crime ngalnst
the nation. To fall to push forward all
work on the Tannmn canal would be
as great a folly.
Currency.
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist in an Inadequate
volumo of money, but In the rigidity
of this volume, which does not respond
as It should to the varying needs of
communities and of seasons. Inflation
must be avoided, but some provision
should be made that will Insure a
lurger volumo of money during the fall
and winter months thnn In the less ac
tive seusons of the year, so that the
currency will contract against specula
tion and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business. At present the
treasury department Is at Irregularly
recurring Intervals obliged In the Inter
est of the business world—that Is, In
the Interests of the Amerlcnti public—
to try to avert financial crises by pro
viding a remedy which should be pro
vided by congressional notion.
Business Methods In Departments.
At various times I have Instituted In
vestigations into the organization and
conduct of tho business of the execu
tive departments. While none of these
Inquiries havo yet progressed far
enough to warrant final conclusions,
they have nlrendy confirmed and em
phasized tho general Impression that
the organization of the departments Is
often faulty In principle and wasteful
In results, while many of their business
methods are antiquated and Inefficient.
I recommend that the congress consider
this subject.
Federal Election*.
In my last annual message I sald:„
"Tho power of the government to
protect the Integrity of tho elections of
Its own officials Is inherent and has
been recognized and affirmed by re
peated declarations of tho supreme
court. There Is no enemy of free gov
ernment more dangerous and none so
Insidious as the corruption of the elect
orate. No one defends or excuses cor
ruption, and it would seem to follow
that none would oppose vigorous meas
ures to eradicate It. I recommend the
enactment of a law directed against
bribery and corruption in federal elec
tions. The details of such a law may
be safely left to the wise discretion of
the congress, but it should go as far ns
under the constitution It is possible to
go and should include severe penalties
against him who gives or receives a
bribe Intended to Influence his act or
opinion ns nn elector and provisions for
the publication not only of tho expend
itures for nominations and elections of
all candidates, but nlso of nil contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees."
1 dealia to rmot Jbli xaeammenda
tlon, ■ **
All contributions by corporations to
any political committee or for any po
litical purpose should be forbidden by
huv, directors should not be permitted
to use stockholders' money for such
purposes, and, moreover, u prohibition
of this kind Mould lie, as far as it
Meat, an effective method of stopping
the evils aimed at in corrupt practices
acts.
The lliianc Conference.
The tlrst conference of nations held
at The Hague in lsiiii, being unable to
dispose of all the business before it,
recommended the consideration and
settlement of n number of Important
questions by another conference to be
called subsequently and at an early
date. These questions were the follow
ing: (It The rights and duties of neu
trals; (lb the limitation of the armed
forces on land and sen and of military
budgets; (11) the use of new types and
calibers of military and naval guns; (4|
the inviolability of private property at
sea In times of war; (To the bombard
ment of ports, cities and villages by na
val forces. In October, I'.SU, at the in
stance of the interparliamentary union.
I issued invitations to all the powers
signatory to The Ilague convention to
send delegates to such a conference
and suggested that it lie again held at
The Hague.
From all the powers acceptance was
received, coupled In some eases with
the condition that we should wait until
the end of the war then waging be
tween Russia and Japan. The emperor
of Russia, immediately after the treaty
of peace which so happily terminated
this war, in n note presented to the
president on Sept. 13 took the Initiative
In recommending that the conference
be now called. The United States gov
ernment in response expressed its cor
dial acquiescence? and stated that It
would as a matter of course take part
In the new conference and endeavor tc
further Its alms. We ussume that all
civilized governments will supinirt the
movement and that the conference Is
now ail assured fact. This government
will do everything In its power to se
cure the success of the conference to
the end that suhstantlnl progress may
lie made in the cause of International
pence, Justice niul good will.
Monroe Doctrine.
There are certain csseutlul points
which must never lie forgotten as re
gards the Monroe doctrine. In the tlrst
place, we must 11s a nation make It ev
ident that we do not intend to treat It
in any shajN' or way as an excuse for
aggrandizement 011 our part ut the ex
pense of the republics to the south.
Itut we must muke It evident that we
do not intend to permit the Monroe doc
trine to be used by any nation on this
continent us u shield to protect it from
the consequences of Its own misdeeds
against foreign nations. The Monroe
doctrine does not force us to Interfere
to prevent the punishment of a port
save to see thut the punishment does
not assume the form of territorial occu
pation In uuy shape. The case Is more
difficult when it refers to a contractual
obligation. This country would cer
tainly decline to go to war to prevent u
foreign government from collecting a
Just debt. Oil the other huud. It Is
very inadvisable to i>ormlt any foreign
power to take possession, even tempo
rarily, of the custom houses of uu
American republic lu order to enforce
the payment of Its obligations, for such
temporary occupation might turn into
a permuuent occupation. The only es
eui>e from these alternatives may at
any time be that -we must ourselves
undertake to bring ultout some arrange
ment by which so much as possible of
a Just obligation shall be paid.
To do so insures the defaulting re
public from having to pay debts of un
Improper character under duress, while
it also insures honest creditors of the
republic from tteing passed by in the
Interest of dishonest or grasping cred
itors. Moreover, for the United States
to take such a position offers the only
possible way of insuring us against a
clash with some foreign power. The
jHisitiou Is therefore lu the interest of
peace as well as hi the interest of Jus
tice.
Snnlo Domingo.
Santo Domingo has now made an ap
peal to us, and not only every principle
of wisdom, but every generous instinct
within us, bills us rcs|mml to the ap
peal. The conditions in Santo I»oiulngo
have for a number of years grown
from bad to worse until a year ago all
society was 011 the verge of dissolution.
Fortunately Just at this time a ruler
sprang up In Santo Domingo who, with
his colleagues, saw the dangers threat
ening their country and appealed to the
friendship of the only neighbor who
possessed the power ami the will to
help them. There was Imminent dan
ger of foreign Intervention. The pa
tience of foreign creditors had become
exhausted, and at least two foreign na
tions were on the point of Intervention
and were only prevented by the unoffi
cial assurance of this government that
it would Itself strive to help Santo
Domingo In her hour of need.
Accordingly, the executive depart
ment of our government negotiated a
treaty under which we are trying to
help the Dominican people to straight
en out their finances. This treaty Is
pending before the senate. In the
meantime a temporary arrangement
has been made under which the Domin
ican government has appointed Amer
icans to all the important positions In
the customs service, and they are see
ing to the honest collection of the rev
enues, turning over 45 per cent to the
government for running expenses nnd
putting the other 55 jK>r cent Into a
•afc depositary for equitable division
In caso the treaty shall be ratified
among tho various creditors, whether
European or American.
Under the course taken stability and
order and all the benefits of peace are
at lust coining to Santo Domingo, dan
ger of forelgu Intervention has been
suspended, and there Is at last a pros
pect that all creditors will get Justice,
no thoro and no lest II Mm arrange
tueut is terminated by the failure of
the treaty chaos will follow, and sooner
or luter this government may be In
volved In serious difficulties with for
eign governments over the island or
else may be forced itself to intervene
lu the island in some unpleasant fash
ion.
Army nnd Navy.
1 do not believe that any army in the
world has a better average of enlisted
man or a better type of junior officer,
but the urmy should be trained to act
effectively in a mass. I'rovtslon should
be made by sufficient appropriations
for maneuvers of a practical kind.
Provision should IK- made for the pro
motion of exceptionally meritorious
men over the heads of their comrades
and for the retirement of all men Mho
have reached a given age without get
ting beyond a given rank.
There should l>o an increase In the
coast artillery force so that our coast
fortilications can be in some degree
adequately manned. There Is special
need for an Increase and reorganization
of the medical department of the army.
In l>oth the army and navy there must
be the same thorough training for duty
In the staff corps as in the lighting line.
The importance of this was shown con
clusively In the Spanish-American and
the Itusso-Japanese wars. The work
of the medical departments In the Jap
anese ariuy and navy Is especially
worthy of study.
Our navy must, relatively to the na
vies of other nations, always he of
greater size than our army. We have
most wisely continued for a numtier of
years to build up our navy, and It
has now reached a fairly high standard
of efficiency. This standard must not
only bo maintained, hut increased. It
docs not seem to me necessary, how
ever, thut the navy should, at least in
the imuiedlute future, he Increased be
yond the present numlier of units.
What Is now clearly necessary Is to
substitute efficient for inefficient units
as the latter become worn out or as It
l>eeoinort apparent that tliey are use
less. Probably the result would he
attained by adding a single battleship
to our navy each year, the superta-dod
or outworn vessels being laid up at
broken up as they are thus replaced,
naturalisation.
On this subject I recommend:
First—A federal bureau of naturali
zation, to bo established In the depart
ment of commerce and lut>or. to su
pervise the administration of the natu
ralization laws und to receive returns
of naturalizations ponding and accom
plished.
Second.—Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be charged, and
procedure.
Third.—More exacting qualifications
for citizenship.
Fourth.—The preliminary declaration
of iuteutiou to tie uhollshed and no
alien' to be naturalized uutll at least
ninety days after the tiling of his peti
tion.
Fifth.—Jurisdiction to naturalize
aliens to be confined to United States
district courts and to such state courts
as have Jurisdiction lu civil uctlous in
which the umouut In controversy Is un
limited; in cities of over 100,000 inhab
itants the United States district courts
to huve exclusive Jurisdiction in the
naturalization of the alien residents of
6uch cities.
Crlmlnnt Law*.
11l liiy last message I asked the at
tention of the congress to the urgeDt
need of action to make our criminal
law more effective, and I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to
the report of the attorney general on
this subject.
There seems to be no statute of the
United States which provides for the
punishment of a United States attor
ney or other officer of the government
who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do
or wrongfully refrain from doing any
act when the consideration for such
corrupt agreement Is other than one
possessing money value. This ought to
lie remedied by appropriate legislation.
Legislation should also lie enucted to
cover explicitly, unequivocally and be
yond question breach of trust In the
shnpe of prematurely divulging official
secrets by an officer or employee of the
United States aud to provide a suitable
penalty therefor.
Merchant Marine.
To the spread of our trade In peace
aud the defense of our llag in war a
great and prosperous merchant marine
Is indispensable. We should havo ships
of our own and seamen of our own to
convey our goods to neutral markets
and in cuse of mini to re-enforce our
battle line. It cannot liut be a source
of regret und uneasiness to us thut the
lines of communication with our sister
republics of South America should be
chiefly under foreign control. It Is not
u good thing that American merchants
aud manufacturers should have to send
their goods aud letters to South Amer
ica via Europe If they wish security
and dispatch. Even 011 the Pacific,
jvhere our ships have held their own
better than on the Atlantic, our mer
chant Aug Is now threatened through
tho liberal aid bestowed by other gov
ernments on their own steam lines. I
ask your earnest consideration of the
report with which the merchant ma
rine commission has followed Its long
and careful inquiry.
It is a matter of unmixed satisfac
tion once more to call attention to tlie
excellent work of the pension bureau,
for the veterans of the civil war have
a greater claim upon us than any other
class of our citizens. Totheni first of
•II among our people honor is due.
Immlgntlon.
As I said in my last message to the
congress, wo cannot have too much
Immigration of the right sort, and we
should have none whatever of the
wrong sort.
The questions arising iu connection
with Chinese immigration stand by
themselves. The conditions in China
are such that the entire Chinese cooly
Class—that Is, the class of i hiuese la
borers, skilled and unskilled - leglti
mutely come under the head of unde
sirable immigrants to tiiis country.
Rut in the effort to carry out the pol
icy of excluding Chinese laborers. Chi
nese coolies, grave injustice and wrong
have been done by this nation to the
people of China and therefore ultimate
ly to this nation itself. Chinese stu
dents, business ami professional men
of all kinds, not only merchants, but
bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro
fessors, travelers and the like, should
be encouraged to come here and treat
ed on precisely the same footing that
we treat students, business men, trav
elers and the like of other nations.
As 11 people we have talked much of
the open door hi China, ami we expect,
and quite rightly Intend to Insist 11)1011,
justice living shown us liy the Chinese.
But we cannot expect to receive equity
unless we tlo equity.
The Civil Service.
Heads of executive departments and
members of the commission have call
ed my attention to the fact that the
rule requiring a filing of charges and
three days' notice before an employee
could lie separated from the service for
Inefficiency has served 110 good pur
pose whatever. Experience has shown
that the rule is wholly Ineffective to
save any man if a superior for Im
proper reasons wishes to remove him
and Is mischievous because it some
times serves to keep in the service in
competent men not guilty of specific
wrongdoing. Having these facts in
view, the rule has la-en amended by
providing that where the inefficiency or
incapacity comes within the personal
knowledge of the head of a department
the removal may lie made without no
tice, the reasons therefor being filed
and made a record of the department.
The absolute right Qf removal rests
where it always has rested, with the
head of a department. The change is
merely one of procedure. It was much
needed, and it is producing good re
sults.
Our copyright laws need revision.
Philippine* and Other lalanda.
During the last yeur the Philippine
Islands have been slowly recovering
from the series of disasters which since
American occujiation have greatly re
duced the amount of agricultural prod
ucts below what was produced in Span
ish times.
The agricultural conditions of the is
lands enforce more strongly than ever
the argument in favor of reducing tho
tariff on the products of the Philippine
Islands entering the United States. I
earnestly recommend that the tariff
now imposed by the Dingley bill upon
the products of the Philippine Islands
be entirely removed, exeept the tariff
on sugar and tolmcco, and that tHnt
turiff be reduced to 25 per cent of the
present rates under the Dingley kef;
thut after July 1, 1900, the tariff upon
tobacco and sugar produced in the
Philippine Utands be entirely removed
and that free trade between the Islands
and the United States in the products
of each country then be provided for
by law.
In my judgmcut, immediate steps
should be taken for the fortification of
Hawaii. This is the most important
point in the raclflc to fortify in order
to conserve the Interests of this coun-
try. It would be hard to overstate the
Importance of this need. Hawaii Is too
heavily taxed. Laws should be enact
ed setting aside for a period Of, say.
twenty years 75 per cent of the internnl
revenue and customs receipts from Ha
waii as a special fund to be expeilded
In the Islands.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which will explicitly eonfet
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico.
I wish also to call the attention ol
the congress to one question which af
fects our insular possessions generally
—namely, the need of an Increased lib
crnlity in the treatment of. the whole
franchise question In these islands.
I earnestly usk that Alaska be glveu
an elective delegate.
Admlulon to Statehood.
I recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma be admitted as one state
and that New Mqxlco and Arizona be
admitted as one state.
The Panama Canal.
Active work in canal construction,
muiuiy preparatory, bus been in prog
ress for less than a year and a half.
During that j>erlod two points about
tho canal have ceased to be open to
debate. First, the question of route;
second, the question of feasibility. The
lß»iut which remains unsettled is wheth
er the canal shall be one of several
locks above sea level or at sea level
with a single tide lock. On this point
I hope to lay before the congress at an
early day the findings of the advisory
board of American and European en
gineers.
In addition to sanitating the isthmus,
satisfactory quarters are being provid
ed for employees and an adequate sys
tem of supplying them with wholesome
food at reasonable prices has been cre
ated. Hospitals have been established
and equipped that are without superi
ors of thfttr kind anywhere. During
the past year a large i>ortlon of the
plant with which the work Is to be
done has been ordered. It is confident
ly believed that by the middle of the
approaching year a sufficient propor
tion of this plant will huve been In:
Btalled to enable us to resume the work
of excavation on a large scale.
Whut Is needed now and without de
lay Is an appropriation by the congress
to meet the current and accruing ex
penses of the commission. The tirot
appropriation of $10,000,000 out of the
$135,000,000 authorized by the Bfeooner
act was made three years ago. It is
nearly exhausted. Unless the congress
shall appropriate before that time all
work must cease.
[ln conclusion the president recom
mends nil Increase in the diplomatic
and consular service and more ad
equate compensation of Jts members.]
