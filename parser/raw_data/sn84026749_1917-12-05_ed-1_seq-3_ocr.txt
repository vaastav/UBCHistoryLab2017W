ized and directed to employ the en
tire naval and military forces of the

the Government to carry on war
against the Imperial and royal Aus-tro-Hixngarlan
government, and to
bring the conflict to a successful ter
mination all the resources of the
country are hereby pledged by the
Congress of the United States."
Deelarattea Expected at Once.
Chairman Flood of the House Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs, introduced
the resolution. It will be approved
by the committee In formal session
this afternoon and by practically the
entire membership of the House prob
ably tomorrow. The Senate will re
ceive the resolution when it recon
venes tomorrow. Passsge through
Congress la certain.
Before this session of Congress rs
far advanced It will In all likelihood
take action to make It possible to
loan Government money to farmers
and stockmen In order to enable farm
era without adequate capital to put
In crops and develop land, and to en
able those having stock to provide
feed and not be forced to throw them
on the market prematurely.
The subject has recently been called
to the attention of the President by
President Townley, of the National!
Nonpartisan League. Moreover. Con-I
gress Is being flooded with letters on!
the subject. ,1
Officiate Faver Plan. I
In the interest of 'increased food
production the food administration
and the Department of Agriculture
are expected to favor It.
Those who have studied the sub
ject say that some plan whereby farm
era and stockmen can obtain loans
on easy terms to promote agriculture
and atockralslng Is Imperative. Other
wise, the country will, before the war
Is another year older. And Itself worse
off for food than ever, aa for lack of
sufficient feed and high prices for
feed, breeding animals are being sac
rificed. This means Injury to the live
stock Industry.
Wmat 140,000,000 er Here.
What Is likely to be done Is to pro
vide that the Government shall make
loans amounting to 130,000,000 or
more to farmers and stock men. The
machinery used would probably be
the farm loan machinery. The loans
would have to be made on the security
of live stock, crops, and the like.
One of the reasons urged for mak
ing such loans Is to enable farmers
to buy seed for next year's crops.

LONDON PRESS INDORSES
PRESIDENFS PLAN FOR
WAR AIMS RESTATEMENT
LONDON, Dec C President WI1
con'a message to Congress gave pow
erful Impetus today to the American
plan for complete, open, frank, and
Joint restatement of allied war aims.
The Dally News' editorial comment
practically Indorsed that plan. Other
newspapers. Joining In the general
chorus df hearty approval of the
whole tone of the Wilson address. In
dicated their belief In the necessity
for a repledglng of the hosts of
democracy.
As stated exclusively by these dis
patches a short time ago. Colonel
House is known to have presented to
British officials President Wilson's
urgent suggestion for a sorting of
war aims, a compilation of those to
which every ally could subscribe, a
discarding of those to which all
could not pledge their force, and
finally Issuance of a joint pledge by
the allies of composite war alms.
The matter presumably was taken
up In the Paris inter-allled councils,
but was put aside for more physical
war measures. Judging from the
reception of President Wilson's ad
dress, the plan will be brought to
the fore today.
The Dally News comment today was
practically an Indorsement of the
American repledglng plan.
-ii me resident could have said
earlier what he said today." the edi
torial declared, "and if In Britain and
France and Italy the responsible
leaders of these nations had made his
language their own, Russia might to
day be driving the German armies
from her borders.
"The demand for a statement of
war alms has been repeated and In-

"Comprekrnds World."
"It would be affectation to pretend
that the speech echoes the declara
tions of allied statesmen," the edi
torial continued. "Hla vision com
prehends the world; theirs only half."
The Times today still rerused to
agree with the President's differen
tiation between the German govern
ment and the German people.
"President Wilson," the Thunderer
said, "has restated the allies' pur
pose with uncompromising force.
With a straightforward atatement of
war alms, the last hopes of the paci
fists must founder."
"As a reaffirmation of previous war
utterances the speech Is of Arst-claas
importance." as.erted the Chronicle.
"Clear, far-.lghted, and statesman
like." was the Express' opinion.
Practically every editorial referred
to the President's address aa the most
emphatic announcement of America's
determination to wage war to the
limit. The President's recommenda
tion that war be declared on Austria
was regarded as one further evidence
of this Inflexible determination."

Today, however. Congressman Fos
ter said that when the resolution came
up In the House, as It will soon, he
would seek to have It broadened out
so that provision will be made so the
miblio can obtain coal at reasonable
j figures.
I "The resolution as it now stands,"
I said Mr. Foster, "does not contemplate
yard or yards from which the pub-
the year 1S69 be knew that a crisis
had not only come, but bad passed be
fore most people suspected it had
come at all. So it has been said of
him that in 1859, two years before
civil war began to develop into bat
tles, he had concluded that it was
"all over but the shooting."
President Wilson has defined "cri
sis" in different language, but he
meant crisis and nothing else when
!n closing his address to the Joint
session of Congress he said: "A su
preme moment of history has come.
The eyes of the people have been
opened and they see. The hand of
God has been laid upon the nations.
He will show them favor, I devout
edly believe, only if they rise to the
clear heights of His own justice and
mercy."
Passing the Crisis.
This is a religious definition of
"crisis." Those who look in the dic
tionary for the word will see that

ing, as the case mav be.
So when the President closed yes
terday with "justice and mercy" as
his last words the "prolonged ap
plause" which followed was "punc
tuated by the Rebel Yell" as we
used to say in reporting Democratic
National Conventions back in the
Nineteenth Century. It is a punctu
ation that always has belonged to
crises short, shrill and "saw
toothed" "the fierce South cheering
on her sons," as the poet of Gettys
burg defines it Now it expresses
the spirit of every American city,
town, hamlet and farmstead from

When It Is "All Over but the
Shooting."
The crisis defined in the joint ses
sion of Congress came when "aver
age Americans" decided for them
selves without putting their feelings
into words that it was "all over but
the shooting."
When once their brains begin oper
ating In that way, they are what the
President wish them to be "a self
governing people." They will then
control the government. They will
then force their way forward against
any opposition. They will make or
break "leaders." They will demand
results forco results and nothing
but results will count with them.
That Is what the joint session of Con
gress meant, with Supreme Court
justices. Senators and members of
the House listening to the President's
address all of which was his intro
ductlon to his definition of crisis as
the supreme moment In history when
the eyes of .he people have been
opened and tht v see.

Listening to the President, the
House and Senate In Joint session

their records think they mado "ap

they blundered Into doing the great

before It.

And the average Americans of 1917,
through the best they can do and
the worst they cannot help, will
make the record now through which

Throughout the country' there has
been a suppressed feeling that this
Congress may not be equal to the
crisis. It is a blunder to have such

other country. The Congress of the
United States In Joint session repre
sents greater possibilities of "making
good," for the bringing the best out of
the worst, than the greatest man in
or out of their own ranks ever can
represent. They are representative
men. When President Wilson defined
the worst possible In world politics
their "prolonged applause" at every
telling point, as It will be bracketed
into the Congressional Record, meant
that if the worst has come to the
worst, they will make the best of It
even If they must "blunder into It.'
We no longer need to study the

tne joint session meant, in detail
it means a declaration of war on
Austria-Hungary, as the President
recommends. It means that if
"alien enemies" of Austro-Hun

the United States the President's
recommendations will be carried out.
It means that the Government of
