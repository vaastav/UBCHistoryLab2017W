WNSUIN(.TON, Dec. 5.--The follow- 'V
ing is a synopsis of President Cleve- t
land's Message which was sent to Con- ec
gress on last Mondav:
To the Congress of the United States: im
The assemblage within the nation's t1
lezislative halls of those charged with fr
the duty of miking laws for the bene- 2:
fit of a generous and free people, i- C:
pressively suggests the exactimg obli- 7"
gation anid inexorable responsibility d4
involved in their task. At the thresh- ii
old of such labor now to be under- ii
taken by the Con'ress of the United &
States, and in the discharge of an ex
ecutive duty enjoined by the Consti- d
tution containing a brief statement of a:
the condition of our national affairs c
and recommending such legislation w
as seems to me necessary and expedi- (I
eat. -The history of our recent deal- p
ing with other nations and our peace- tI
relations with then at thistiie ad
ditionally demonstrate the advantage d
of consistently adhering to a firm but f(
just foreign policy. free from envious b
or ambitious national schemes and ti
characterized b%- entire honesty and C
sincerity. During the past year pur- p
suant to a law of Congress. comnis- 1
sioners wereoppointed to the Antwerp c
Industrial Expedition. Though the 1!
paticipation of American exhibitors ti
fell far short of completely illustrating< d
our national ingenuity and industrial
achievements, yet it was quite credit- tI
able in view of the brief tine allowed o
'for preparation. ,
The message treats first of our for- li
eign relatiolis and disapproves of the ti
situation at Samoa, declaring th.e pres di
ent peace to be unstable, and recom
mending our withdrawal as soon as
ossible from our- connection with t
-he affair. He calls attention t.) the i
good service of our ships at Rio ie Ja- as
neiro, and to the termination of cer- o
tain treaty arrangements between this a
country and Brazil under the new tar- I
iff; also to the signing of a new treaty 6
with China. He comments upon the a
danger to our people resident in Chi- A
na during the Japan-China war, and T
would heed any intimation that our 1
aid wouldbe acceptable in terminating p
hostilitites. He~ calls attention to p
trade differences with Germany grow- a
ing out of our tariff on sugar, and re
commends the repeal of the one-tenth tA
of one per cent. tax. He reconnnends d
the acceptance by this country of the fi
awari of the Paris tribunal in the a
Behring Sea controversy, and the o
prompt payment by this country of the p
$425,000 in full payment of alf 'tlains e
of Great Britain. He reviews the ii
Bluefields incident at some length and v
sets forth in familiar m-i.nner our re- c
lations with the various foreign pow- p
ers. a
The President shows a great appre- c
ciation of the citizen soldiery of the S
several States, and after conimending I
Secretary Lanont's plan for reorran- '
izing the regular army. he says: 'rihe t]
reports of the militia inspections by un
regular army officers show a marked 1
increase in interest and elicncv. p
amono the State organizations, and 'Ii
strongl recommend a continuance of al
the poiy of affording every practical y,
encouragment possible to this impor- v
taut auxiliary of our military estab- tl
lish ment." c<
The President warmly commends'S
the 'worlk of the Circuit Courts of Ap- a:
-peal, and favors the addition of anoth
er judge in each district. He also fa- p
vors ainited States Court for the In- Ui
dian Territory. He urges the settle- 3:
ment of the Union Pacific Railroad rr
matter by this congress in some w~ay (
that will take the road out of th~e si
hands of the receiver as speedily as o:
possible. .u
The President repeats his former re- oi
commendations in favor of govern- si
*ment prisons for governmnent..psson~ 81
ers, and everybody will -ei'idorse his ai
approval of the Seerfyr of W-ar's re- et
commendatia-fiat the present milita- 71
rypr' tEort Leavenworth be
over to the government for the di
- iriometof Federal convicts. 1e
There is no demand for a special pen- se
itentiary for members of the army. (
and Mr. TLamont declares that it can be T
turned over to the government for Sf
other purposes with an actual saving oIf
of money to the War Department. ti
The President cordially endorses the de
recommendation of Postmaster Gen- fc
eral Bissell with reference to restrict- to
ing or remodelling the law with re- w
ference to second class matter in the t1
mails This privilege properly allowed y<
by the government for the distribution vi
of newspapers to the people, is taken pi
advantage of by advertisinosheets and w
- by trashy novels, and for tYie distribu- O<
tioni of tons of garden seeds, so that .de
the Postmaster ~General declares that of
if these abuses were corrected there cr
would not only cease to be a deficit us
in the Postoffice Department. but that th
litimate newspapers could be dis- pr
tributed through the mails free. w
President Cleveland favors addi- sa
tional ships and torpedo boats for the chi
navy, and the continuing of work on 34
our coast defence. He urges a revision th
of the line of the navy. and the passage an
of laws that will make it possible for 53
faithful members to receive promo
tions that will create a corp)s d'esprit
that is now badly needed. The Presi- 'W
dent does not believe in pushing the th
question of allottments of land to In- 2,:
diana too fast, and thinks if old farm- apJ
ers are crying hard times, it is not to pa
be expected that Indians can begin ua
farming and make a living. He agrees to
with the Secretary of the Interior m<
' nt the sale of Jands remaining' th
r napportionment, until it shall se<
have dee'pdby experiment that th
the Indians were ready for allottmnent. in;
He commends the exposure of pen- ab
sion frauds, and it is believed by the di<
commissioner of pensions that the vear mi
of 1S95 will see high water mark in 10'1
the number of pensioners. After the pr.
thirtieth year it is estimated that the ahi
number mnust begin to decrease. The
eleventh census entailed an expense D<
of over ten millions last year. It will 30,.
comprise when completed 25 volumes Of
of 22,270 pages. The Agricultural rc
Department seems to have made sub- 15
stantial savings from its appropriation es1
without detriment to the service. The ce
- President concurs in the Secretary's fo:
recommendation that the free distr'i- ehi
bution of seeds cease. except to experi- bo
ment stations, and that the agricultu- fo:
ral reports be greatly limited in nuim- th
ber. -11
The President stands warnmly to the th
support of the Civil Service. He rec- ca
commends the appointment of a na- an
tional board of heialth and national
quarantine regulations. With refer
ence to the tariff President Cleveland er;
expresses a mild interest in free coal in
and iron, and declu-es in favor of D)<
striing out the sugar ditferential dlu- Ti.

rrasses our foreign coininerce. ie an

THE ARMY. 0
From the rep~ort of the Secretary of a

2 yon Septemiber 30, 1894, was ti
35 enlisted men. Although this is d
paretly a very slight decrease com
redl with the previous year. the act- '.
I effective force has been increased ti
the equivalent of nearly twvo regi. cm
mts through the, reorganization of ~
a system of recruitimg, and the con-s
juent release to regimental duty of n
large force of men hitherto serv
r at the recriliting deposits. The rc
lition of these deposits, it is pre- ni.
ted, will further more effect an an
al reduction approximating $8250,. d:
in the direct expenditures. besides am
>oting generally the health. mnor-1
andI discipline of the troops.

The Commissioner of Pensions is of
me opinion that the year 1895, being
C thirtieth after the close of the War
the Rebellion, must according to
1 sensible human calculatioii see the
hest limit of the pension roll. and
at after that year it must begin to

ride -ime in1 gold are iot cancelled but
are re ie;C and nmay do duty many
;i:ies. by drawing gold from the
Treasury. Thus we have an endless
chain in operation. constantly deplet
ing the Treasurvs gold and never near
a finli rest. As if this was not bad
enou01g1M. we have by a statutory decla
rationt that it is the policy of the gov
ernm ient to maintain the parity be
twec,-n gold and silver. aided the force
and momentum of this exhausting
a id added largely to the cur
renric" oligations claiming this pecu
liar gold redemptiol. Our small gold
reserve is thus subject to drain from
every side. The demands that increase
our <langer also inrease our danger
also increase the necessity of protect
ing this reserve against depletion. and
it ismost unsatisfactory to know that
tihe protection atforded is only a teni
porary palliative.
It is perfectly and palpably plain 1
that the only way under present con
ditions by which this reserve, when
dangerotisly depleted. can be replenish
ed is through the issue and sale of the
bonds of the government for gold and
yet Congress has not only thus far de
elined to authorize the issue of bonds
best suited to such a purpose, but there
seeis a disposition iii some uarters
to deny both the necessity and power
for the issue of bonds at all. I can
not for a momant believe that any of
our citizens are deliberately willing t
thattheir goverinment shoul (k-fault <
ill its pecuniary obligations or that its
financial operationssliould be reduced
to a silver basis. At any rate I should
not feel that mV duty was done if I
ominited ary effort I could make to
avert such acalamity. As long, there
tore. as no r'ovisioni is made for the
final redemjption or the putting aside
of the curraicy obligation now used
10 repeatedlV and constantly draw
irom the government its gold and as ]
long as no better authority for bond <
issues is allowed than at present exists,
such authority will be utilized when
ever and as often as it becomes necesary
to maintain a sulicient gold reserve
and in abundant time to save the credit
of our country and make good the fin
ancial declarations of our government.
THE PRESSING QUESTION.
Questions relating to our banks and
currency are closely connected with
the subject just referred to and they
also present some unsatisfactory fea
tures. Prominent among themt are
the lack of elastioitv.in our currency
circulation and its frequent concentra- j
tion in financial centers when it is
most needed in other parts of the
country. The absolute divorcement
of the government to the currency of
the country is advisable. This con
dition cannot be in ediately reached;.
but as a step in that direction and as a
means of securing a more elastic and
obviating other o'bjections to the pres
ent arrangmnent of bank circulation,
the secretary of the Treasury presents
in his report a scheme modifsving pres
ent banking laws and providing for
the issue of circulating notes by State
banks free fronmtaxation under certain<
Iiitations. The Secretary explains
his plan so pianinly and its advantages3
are developed by- him with such re
miarkable clearness that any effort on
my partt to present arguments in its
support would be superfluous. I shall
therefore content myself with an un
qualified endo rsenment of theSecretary's
proposed die niges in t he laiwand a briief
and imperfect statement of their
prominent featres:
it is proposed to repeal all law~s
providinig for the deposit of Uni-t
ted States bonds as security for
circulation. to per-mit national "banks
to issue circulating notes not exceeding
in amount 75 per cent. of their paidl
up andl uinimpaired~capital, provided
they deposit with the govern
nent as a guarantee fund in 1
United States legal tender notes
anid including treasury notes, of 2
1890, a sum equal in amount to 30 peri
cent. of the notes they desire to issue.
this deposite to be maintained at all ,
times, but whenever any bank retirest
any party of its circulation a propor
tionial part of its guarantee fund shallt
be returned to it to permit the Secret
ary of the Treasury to prepare andc
keep on hand, ready for issue, in case
an increase in circulation is desired, 1
blank national bank niotes for each
bank having circulation, and ;to1
repeal the pr-ovisions of the 1
present law imposing linmitations
and restrictions upon banks de-t
esiring to reduce or increase their
circulation-thuts periiting such in-e
crease or reduce of reduction within t
the limit of 75 per' cent. of capital to b
quickly made as emergencies arise.5
InI additional to the guantee fund re-s
quied it is proposed tolprovide a safety ,
fund for the inunediate redemption of a
the circulating notes of failed banks c
by imposing a small annual tax, say d
one-half of t per cent, upon the av-er-b
age circulation of each bank until the
fuud amournts to 5 per cent. of the e
total cire alation outstanding. WVhen b
a bank fails its guarantee fund is to
be paid into this safety fund and its h~
notes are to be redeemed in the first e
instance from such safety funds thus a
authorized: any imp~airmnent of such h
furd caused therebyx to be made good ri
fromr the inunaediately available cash 14
assets of said bank and if these should a
be insaiflicienit such impiairmlent to be o,
made good by pro rata assessment h
amng tihe other banks, their contri
b~utions constituting aL first lieu uplon a
the assets of the failed bank in favor Sm
of thre conrribuitinlg banks. As a fur
y
ther security it is conrtemrplated that 0
tire existingp~rov-ision fixing theindi
vidmar liabilitv of stockholders is to be p
retaned arid tire bank's indebtedness c
on accounit of its cireulating notes is ,
to e made a f ir'st lieu on all its assets. E
For tire putrphose of meeting the ex
pense of pr-inting~ notes, othicial super
visonl. canicellartion and other like ti
rharges, thiere shall be imposed a tax
af say one-lalfo e et e r
rinom uponou the aviergelt amenro ar

rovded that there shall be nrational
bank notes issued of a less dlenomnina
ion than tenr dollars: that each nation- Ii

RUN DOWN AT LAST.
)ne of the Copes Murderers Captured and
Jailed.
D. C. Murphy, a native of the Fork,
vas arrested at Sheldon, not far from
ort Royal, on last Wednesday,
harged with being one of the assassins
)f the late Treasurer Copes.
D. C. Weeks, B. L. Lambert, A.
Fisher au l T. D. Mitchell performed
le detective work which has resulted
n the capture of Murphy. That he
s guilty is clear beyond question to
,heir minds. The story as related by
he detectives is as follows: About
wo - eeks after the murder they had
ecured evidence that pointed to Mur
hy as one of the guilty parties and
,hey had good reason to believe that
2e was n Paltaka, Fla. Lambert
.vent to that town and after investiga
ion traced him back to South Caro
ma.
-It appears that Murphy was con
tantly on the move. Lambert fol
owed his trail inito Barnwell County,
hence to Georoia, into Screven Coun
y. back into lorida again, and then
o South Carolina a second time. At
1o time. however, could Lambert lo
!ate his man less than three weeks
tnd that was on his second visit to
Palatka, which was on -the 30th of
.ovember. The detectives then learn
d that Murphy had left there about
;hree weeks before. Returning to
:his State Lambert continued his
earch and at last located his man at a
ittle station named Sheldon on the
P~ort Royal and Augusta Railroad,
ibout fourteen miles from Beaufort.
Accompanied by Fisher and Mitchell,
[mbert left Denmark on last Tues
l~y, went to Port Royal, where Tria
ustice Rogers countersigned his war
-ant. Weeks got off at Sheldon
vhere hietkept a lookout for Murphy.
Before the return of his colleagues
Weeks saw his man enter a lhttle
tore kept by. the negro postmaster of
he place and arrested hun. Upon the
eturn of the other detectives Murphy
sked that they go with him to where
ie was living. The place was about
mile and a half from the station.
'hey found there a little cabin in
hic1 he had been living for the past
wo weeks and in which there was a
>retense of a grocery business, but
which was really a blind tiger for the
llicit sale of whiskey; in other words
Jurphy, or as he was known there,
r. T. Shoemaker, was keeping a blind
iger. A bout $15 worth of groceries
ere in the front part of the cabin and
he "tiger" in the rear. An old negro
oman, blind in one eye, was in
:harge of the place.
Murphy was brought by his captors
o Denmark on Wednesday night
here he remained in the guard house
mtil Thursday morning. He was
hen brought to Orangeburo' and turn
d over to Sheriff Dukes. The Sheriff
hought that his prisoner was not safe
n Orangeburg County, and as a pre
autionary measure deemed it best
hat he be carried to Columbia. The
overnor was telegraphed to inform
nig him that the prisoner would be
ent to Columbia for safe keeping~and
V. Hampton Dukes, Deputy Sheriff,
ccompanied by the four detectives,
arried the prisoner to Columbia Thurs
ay night. Sheriff Cathcart having
eeni notified met the train, and the
risoner, who was handcuffed, was
onducted to the jail and locked up
y Jailer Coleman.
Murphy is an ill-looking fellow,
aving thie appearance of a pickpocket
r fcoot pad. He is lean and slender,
bout six feet high when erect, but
as a slouching gait and stooping car
age. His face is mean and hard
>oking, a thin, straggly black mous
che hangs over a mouth that stands
pen nearly all the time and gives
im a hunted, run down look. A
in beard an inch long, also thin
ad straggly, does not add to his per
mal appearance. He is about 32
mrs old. His reputation before the
>mmission of his crime was most uin
a or. He had been in trouble be
re on account of his rascality in
rangeburg and had mad< himnself
arce in those parts for some time.
ec was born and raised1 about two
iles from where the murder was
>mitted. He had not been seen in
L neighborhood for over a year be
ire the crime and his whereabouts
ere unknown. It has transpired that
a had returned about a week before
Le murder, but (lid not make his ap
~arance to those who were familiar
ith him. lie had kept away from
s acquaintances, but that lie had
conplices is certain tind they knew
Treasurer Copes's collection and
ade up the plot to murder him be
rehand.
