TOPEKA STATE JOURNAL, SATURDAY EVENING. DECEMBER 7, 1301.
RAILROAD NEWS,
Railroads Want an Anti-Scalp-er
Ordinance in Topeka.
In Preparation For the Mid
winter Exposition.
AROUSING SEXTI3IE5T.
Circulars Concerning Ticket
Scalping Being Sent Oat.
Officials Don't HaTe Much to Saj
About It.
An effort will be made by representa
tives of the Santa Fe, Rock Island,
Union Pacific and Missouri Pacific rail
roads to secure the passage by the To
paka city council of an anti-ticket
scalper ordinance, which shall impose
a prohibitive license on the business of
ticket scalping. They hope to secure
this action before the time of the mid
winter exposition.
The railroads claim that it will be a
food thing for the town to have such
an ordinance, because all the roads
would then feel kindly disposed toward
Topeka, and give it whatever it wants
in the way of cut rates for future fes
tivals and other big public gatherings.
One of the leading passenger officials
located in the city said today:
'Tbe passage of an anti-scalper ordi
nance in Topeka would be the best
thing Topeka ever did. It would pro
tect the traveling public, and would
make the railroads give the wants of
the town the most careful consideration.
Take the case of El Paso, which has a
strict anti-scalping law. The many
railroads which center there appreciate
this fact, and they give Kl Paso what
ever it asks for. The roads are now
about to commence the erection of an
Immense union depot for the town.
Other cities which have shown that
they are in favor of legitimate railroad
business get the best treatment from
the roads. I wish Topeka would try
the experiment, and shut out all the
ticket scalpers. While 99 men may ride
safely on scalpers' tickets, the hun
dredth man will get caught, and the
chances are he is some poor fellow who
can't pay his fare. He gets put off the
train and it's bad business all around."
Just at the present time the roads in
Topeka, as at other points, are sending
out large quantities of literature cal
culated to inform people about the
ticket scalping business, as seen from
the railroad's standpoint. The litera
ture is composed of extract front var
ious newspapers. After the extract,
the railroad has added a moral in bis
black type. The Allowing are some of
the morals:
"Each day brings evidence of the fact
that the character of the ticket scalping
business is being more fully recog
nized." "The above editorial properly ex
presses the views of thinking people,
and can not but impress the reader as
to the iniquity of the ticket scalper's
business."
"The above shows conclusively that
the ticket scalper lives by fraud."
There is something very mysterious
about these little circulars. The rail
road ofiicials manifest the most amaz
ing ignorance concerning them.
"Who are these circulars being sent
to?" was asked today of an official who
was giving instructions to a mailing
clerk in regard to sending out a big
stack of the little inoffensive looking
anti-scalper documents.
"I don't know, I'm sure," was the
reply.
"Where did they come from?"
"I don't know. They were given to
me by Mr. ,' mentioning his next
superior officer.
"Uoes the road get them out?"
"I don't know. Now don't ask so
many questions. Can't you see that we
don't wit to get this business into the
papers? We don't want everybody to
know where these circulars come from."
It is believed that the circulars are
being sent to newspapers and to prom
inent men for the purpose of arousing
public sentiment throughout the state.
It may be that the anti-scalper cam
paign which the roads have inaugurat
ed is preliminary to an attempt to se
cure some stringent state legislation on
the subject.
As a sample of the circulars which
the roads- are sending out are the fol
lowing, copied from the batch which
was started out from Topeka in yes
terday's mail:
From the Austin, Tex., Current Issue,
October, 1901: "Convention centers and
cities like San Antonio and Dallas, that
annually attract great numbers of vis
itors to their expositions, are finding it
more difficult with each succeeding year
to secure reduced round-trip rates from
the railroads. This is not to be mar
veled at when one considers the fact
that, whenever these reduced rates are
put on, the ticket scalper springs to the
fore all hungry for business. All trains
leading into points that enjoy the round
trip rate, and upon which they must
rely for their visitors, are boarded at
out-of-town stations by the ticket
brokers who solicit the passengers for
thir return. coupons . Travelers not en
titled to the privilege of the reduced
rate, of course, dispose of the unused
portions of their tickets, while others
who will return to their homes fall prey
to the ticket vultures upon the idea
that when they have exhausted their
stay they can buy cheap transportation
from the ticket scalpers, whose allur
ing tariff boards literally line the thor
oughfares. All this is demoralizing to
passenger traffic, unjust to the railroads
and contrary to sound public policy."
From the Louisville Courier Journal
November 5. 1901: "Hundreds of tick
ets purchased from dishonest brokers
have been taken up by the railroads on
the trains out of Buffalo, and their
holders obliged to pay their fare or
gat off the train. This in all cases has
been a serious annoyance, and in very
many cases an absolute hardship. In
view of the universal condemnacion of
the business by those who have in
vestigated it. it would seem as if th
papers throughout the country could
ierform no better service for the pub
lic than to warn them against the pur
chase of tickets from the brokers Par
ticularly is this necessary in the rural
districts and in local papers Peopi-
living in large cities have no excuse for
Ignorance on this subject. The great
uoii.cs iime ana again published
accounts of the frauds pernetrated and
the danger of dealing with scalpers is
generally understood at such points
It is rare, however, that the country
papers give place to items of this char
acter, and it would be an act of posi
tive value to their readers if the rural
press would set forth the danger which
attends any transactions with the tick
et scalpers."
,romi.he Ra"way Age, November 1,
1901: The business men of San An
tonio, Texas, are level headed on the
subject of ticket scalping at the present
time. They are organizing a great fair
and realizing that in order to afford
low rate tickets the railways must be
protected from the depredations of
scalpers they petitioned the state courts

School Conventions.
Chicago, Dec 7. Reduced rates for a
number of big annual gatherings to be
held next summer were agreed on by
general passenger agents of railroads
east of Chicago at a meeting in this
city today.
For the convention of the National
Educational association to be held in
Denver. Colo., July 7-11, a rate of one
fare plus 2 will be made by all lines
east and west. The extra J2 will go into
the treasury of the educational associa
tion. Tickets for this gathering will
be on sale east of Chicago July 4, 5 and
6. The final return limit will be Sep
tember 1. The triennial gathering of
the International Sunday association
will also be held in Denver. For this
meeting the railroads will sell tickets
at one fare for the round trip plus $2.
The convention will assemble June 26
and will continue in session until July
1. The tickets will be on sale in the
territory east of Chicago June 23 and 24,
and the final return limit will be July
31.
SANTA FE'S NEW SCHEME.
May Establish, a System of Local Con
nections at San Francisco.
San Francisco, Dec. 7. The rumor Is
again revived that the Santa Fe has
purchased the California & Nevada
road and intends to utilize it as the
nucleus of a system of local trains and
boats connecting this city with Oak
land and Berkeley. Capt. A. H. Payson,
assistant to the president of the Santa
Fe, denies that his road has purchased
the line, though he intimated that it
might do so in the future.
COMPLETES TO ELLIS.
Union Pacific Ballast Gang Will Quit
Next Week.
The ballast gang on the Union Pacific
will be compelled to stop work for the
winter in about a week. The work has
been completed to a point near Ellis.
Early in the spring the company ex
pects to rush the work through.
The Usual Denial.
Rumors have been put In circulation
lately that negotiations, which have
been pending for a month, have been
practically consummated by which a
controlling interest in the stock of the
Rock Island railway passes from Chi
cago owners to parties affiliated with
the Pennsylvania. Officials of the com
pany here say they know nothing of a
transfer of a large amount of Rock
Island stock and they believe the re
port to be a canard spread by specu
lators to influence the market. It is
certain that neither Mr. Cable nor any
of the other Chicago stockholders have
disposed of their holdings, and if any
Rock Island stock has changed hands
it must have been that of the Moore
brothers. The latter, however, are not
believed to have sold any of their stock.
New Union Pacific Book.
As showing the consolidation of in
terests under one control, the Union
Pacific has lately issued a folder which
contains a map of the Union Pacific,
Oregon Short Line. Oregon Railroad fc
Navigation company and the Southern
Pacific all lately merged under the
Harriman syndicate. The lines are
shown in red and illustrate forcibly the
immensity of the four combined sys
tems. From Spokane, Wn., on the north
to Guaymas, Mexico, as far east as
New Orleans and west to San Trancisco
the roads tap the very ricliest territory
of the transmississippi country. Ac

REV MATTHEW HENRY FRANK,
Who will be Installed Pastor of Oak

by the Rev. J. S. Glendenning, of North
Topeka,
Rev. Mr. Frank was born at Cincin
nati, Ohio, and took a Master of Arts
degree at Wooster (Ohio) university in
1866, where he was for twelve years a
teacher. He was principal of the
academy of Washburn college three
years prior to 1S97, when he went east,
where he was graduated from the theo
logical seminary of Princeton, N. J., in
1900. Rev. Mr. Frank came to Oakland
as his first pastorate about six months
ago as stated supply. The church im
proved rapidly under his management,
and more than doubled its membership.
All are united and enthusiastic at the
prospects of still larger growth of use
fulness. He established a weekly jour
nal last August called "The Oaklander,"
which goes into every home in Oakland.
The people now desire a permanent
pastorate, and the Topeka presbytery
has appointed a committee to install
the choice of the people.
The Christian Endeavor societies of
the city will hold a mass meeting and
rally Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock in
the First Presbyterian church. Rev.
Clarence E. Eberman, national field

address. Mr. Eberman is returning
eastward from a campaign in the west

ent position two years ago. Mr. Eber
man has earned a national reputation
as a platform orator of great force and
power, and he is one of the foremost
speakers of the day. The programme
for the meeting tomorrow is as follows:

Material for the new "bob-tail" way
car is being rushed. There are a num
ber of this style of cabooses in use now
on the western divisions of the road. It
has been found that the platform rigging
is a source of great expense because it
requires constant repairs, the strain on it
being greater than on most other parts
of the car. This is particularly applica
ble where pusher engines are used. With
the late style the steps are placed on the
side and the rainmen get in and out
through a side door, thus doing away
with the platform entirely.
People who have occasion to use the
Fourth street crossing after 6 o'clock are
complaining bitterly at the manner in
which trains are held there for long
periods of time, blocking the way. It is
said that for more than half an hour re

no effort was made to part them, so that
people who were waiting could get over
the crossing. The Santa Fe and the city
should get together and arrange for the
building of a viaduct, or else come to an
understanding by which there may be oc

Read this statement:
Mr. F. T. Yale, No. 707 Quincy St.,
photographer at No. 617 Kansas avenue,
says: "Kidney complaint bothered me
for about two years. At first I paid
little attention to a slight pain across
the small of my back, but finally it
grew so bad I could scarcely attend to
my work. When I stooped it was with
the greatest difficulty that I could
straighten, and the kidney secretions
were unnatural, distressing and annoy
ing, and also disturbed my rest nights.
I was in pretty bad shape when I got
a box of Doan's Kidney Pills at Row
ley & Snow's drug store, corner of
Sixth and Kansas avenue. I noticed
decided relief after the third dose, and
on finishing the treatment the back
ache disappeared and the action of the
kidney secretions was corrected."
For sale by all dealers. Price, 50
cents. Foster-Milburn Co., Buffalo, N.
Y., sole agents for the United States.

a reddish sediment in the bottom of the glass,
or if the urine is cloudy or milky, or if you see

kidneys are diseased and you should lose no
time, but get a bottle of Warner's Safe Cure,

Mr. J. L. Raker, Assistant Post
master, Stevens Point, Wis., writes:
"Warner's Suie Curi; has cured inn
of kidney trouble and indigestion, it
is the best tonic I ever took and it
has permanently cured me of what
my doctor called one of the wor.t
cases of kidney disease he ever
came across in his experience. It
is the family medicine in this part
of the country."
Warner's Safe Cure is purely veg

drugs; it does not constipate; it is
a most valuable and effective tonic;
it is a stimulant to digestion and
awakens the torpid liver, putting
the patient into the very best recep

storer of the kidnevs. It prepared
the tissues, soothes inflammation
and irritation, stimulates the enfee
bled organs and heals at the sanr
time. It builds up the body, gives
strength, and restores energy that

That is the result of a course
of treatment with Scott's Emul
sion. We have special refer
ence to persons with weak
lunsrs and sensitive throats.
Scott's Emulsion does some
things better than others. This
is one of them. It has a pe
culiar action on the throat and
lungs which gives them
strength and makes themtough.
That's how Scott's Emulsion
drives out coughs, colds and

too.
