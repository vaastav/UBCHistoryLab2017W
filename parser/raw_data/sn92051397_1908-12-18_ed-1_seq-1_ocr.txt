i The ,-anta Clans committee of the
F.Iks is very busy this week preparing
j fni the big Christmas tree and dinner
i to be given next Thursday to the writ
' ers of the Sa:;! Onus letters received
I at the local poslofflce. F.ai-h of these
h Iters Is being investigated and the
i worthy ones of the writers will be
gladdened by presents of tho gU'ls for
I which they a.'ked
j In view of the real good which Is be
' lug done in this direction hy Mr.
i ' i.inncll and his fellow F.Iks of the
; committee, It seems an unfortunate
statement Issued yesterday hy Post-
: livery to charitable organisations of
b Mors addressed to "Panta Clans."
Xumeroiis complaints have been
1 made it Is said to the postmns'er gen
jera' by many el arltahle organizations
; that onlng to the iarg number of
; such letters taken hy tv various char-
jltles while the order was In force It j
would not he possible to investigate'
i each rase, and that the presents given i
; out fell Into the hands of unworthy
I persons. The practice aNo was ehj-ct-l
ed to on the ground thai It tended t.C
make beggars of children.
1 The postmaster genera! has directed i
! postmasters to treat the "anta ("au"
'letters In accor lance with those see
: ilons of the postal laws which provide
! that letters hearing flcCtlous addresses
i shall he sent to the division of dead !
i letters- unless the Addresses of the
senders appear upon the envelopes In'
which case the letters will be return-1
oil to such addresses. I
It I, estimated In the officials that I
more than ?,ft.aeo letters are addressed j
by the children of the country to
"Santa clans'' annually.
Tin-so conditions which are set forth
as being ohjei'tlnnahle most emphati
cally do not apply Ih Oils oily. In the
fit st place the F.Iks have voluntarily
taken up this work, thinking It will
clve them a rare opportunity to do a
iM-ge amount of good. Then every loi
ter Is Investigated hy the committee,
one member of which Is assigned to a
certain section of the city and he vis
Its In person each family
vbose children a letter

e ' They realljie that some of these lot -d
ters are written by those who do not
nred assistance and hy others who are
triing to obtain gifts needed by more
i. nfortunate families. My their per
sonal Investigation they' make sure
that none hut deserving cases are carr

Thus it semi unfortunate that ow-

the Flks are willing most rapnhly lo

ministers nt onee make a public re
traction of and apologv for the state
ments made In a circular letter setn
out yesterday which was Intended to
bring opposition to Mr, Hanks In his
candidacy for the speakership, and in
case of failure so to do, he says, the)
lay themselves liable for a suit foi
alleged libel. Mr Hanks says that
he holds each of the clergymen Imll-
Idually and personally liable for the
statements contained In the minister
ial btter. Continuing Mr. Hanks says:
"Kvery statement and every Infer
ence in said cii'i uhir relating lo nu
Is false nnd the falsity of the same
should have been known to you, and
could readily have been ascertained
by you. I call upon you to show
when, where and In what manner I
have played 'fast and loose' with the
county commissioners, and 1 call upon
j mi to show any instances In which I
have shown sympathy 'marked or
otherwise' with the brewers and sa
loon keepers or done anything In their
favor, except to appear opi-nly and
publicly In court and before the coun
ty commissioners as their paid counsel.
I demand that you cite specific In
stances or a case In which 1 'have
been upon both the side of the prose
cution and the defendant' nnd I call
upon you to point out In what respect
my 'en leer has allied me with the
saloon keepers and the brewers' un
less by this last statement you mean
that I have acted as nttoiney publicly
and openly for the brewers nnd sa
loon keepers, and If you mean that
demand that you so state that yon
mean only that.
"I demand also that you state what
position In connection with the conn
ty commissioners you referred to as
held hy me while acting 'on behalf
of saloon keepers'."
The letter then gives an explana
tion of Judge Hanks' relationship to
the county commissioners, of his du
ties as county treasurer, and closes
with a statement that he does not
demand retraction and apology be
cause of any hearing It may have upon
the speakership. Judge Hanks saying
that blf fri.pds will not believe anv
charges such as have been made, hut
because many people who do not ha
persona! acquaintanceship may be In
fluenced by said statements which he
d' dares were false.

DECLARATION OF WAR
ilciitcnnnt's Announcement, So. .
Washington, fee. 17. Something of a
flurry was caused In diplomatic, circles
to-day by the report which gener
ally obtained that Venezuela has de
clared wa- against Holland. These re
ports had their foundation In the dis
patch to the war department by way
of fiogota, transmitting a telegram
from Caracas, saying that the govern
ment had declared a slate of war. ft
wns toon pointed out. however, that this
announcement was based on Vice Pres
ident (tomez's declaration that ths
I country is in a slate or defense because
j of Holland's seizing the coast .guard
ship Alexis.
Offlelals Interested In the situation
profess to see no actual difference he
tween "a stale of war" and "a state of
defense," taking the position that It Is
a case of ''distinction without a dlf-
i ferenee.
