JOYFUL JAPANESE
Subjects of the Mikado Are De
lighted With Roosevelt.
His Views Are in Perfect Accord
With Theirs.
TFHATTUEY WOULD SAY
He lias Said and Frobably Said
It Better.
Eared Country's Honor and
Added Lnstre to His Fame.
Tokio, Dee. 6. Most of the papers here
highly eulogize President's Roosevelt's
attitude toward the Japanese, as ex
pressed in his message. The Asasi is de
lighted that the confidence reposed in
the president has been realized. It says:
"By his firm attitude, prompted by a
lofty sense of justice. President Roose
velt has added new lustre to his already
great fame. It is to be hoped that true
Americans will unite in support of his
righteous policy."
The Hochi praises President Roose
velt's attitude as just and impartial, and
is rejoiced to find it in perfect a-.eord
with the views of the Japanese govern
ment. "Public opinion here," it says, "be
lieves that he must have been actuated
by an exalted sense of patriotism to save
his country from dishonor by clearly de
fining the relative power and authority
cf the federal and state governments."
The Jiji is grateful that President
Roosevelt has expressed exactly what
the Japanese would Fay.
"They feel at ease," it declares, "since
the Japanese cause has been placed in
Fuch powerful hand."
The press is almost unanimous in con
fidentially expressing belief in a satis
factory solution of the San Francisco
complications.
DIG OUT THE TENS.
Secretary Shaw Issues a Letter to the
Hanks.
Washington. Dec. 6. The secretary
of the treasury tod;iy issued the fol
lowing open letter to all banking in
stitutions of the United States:
A very marked scarcity of small
Vails is noticeable everywhere and the
treasury is powerless to relieve. In
the absence of legislation allowing na
tional banks to issue a larger propor
tion of their circulation in denomina
tion of five dollars, the banks them
selves must be rolled upon to alleviate
the strain as far as possible. There
are in circulation nearly $15,000,000
in silver certificates of the denomina
tion of ten dollars. Many of these
are doubtless packed away in the
vaults of various banking institutions
and held as reserve. Permit me re
spectfully to ask that each Institution,
state, and national, search the money
In its vaults, and send these ten dol
lar silver certificates to the treasury.
They will promptly be converted into
ones and twos, to the very great relief
of the country. It is the only remedy.
Let no bank complain of conditions
until it has literally searched its own
vaults and contributed as far as possi
ble to the relief of the situation.
SLUGGED A WOMAN.
Kobber Attacks Night Operator at
Desoto and Hobs the Depot.
Kansas City. Mo.. Dec. 6. A robber

24 miles southwest of Kansas City, on
the Panta Fe, unconscious with a blow
from a wagon spoke, robbed the depot
money drawer of what small change it
contained and escaped. Miss Heckart
was found unconscious lying near the
rtation. There were three cuts on her
head and her arm had been broken
in three places. She recovered con
sciousness later and said her assailant
was a white man about 25 years of age.
The description fits that of Leonard
D. Conner, private in company I, engi-nee-
corps, who escaped yesterday from
the fedenl military prison at Ft. Leav
enworth. Kan.
Conner is 22 years of age. He was
born in Helton, Kan., and his mother.
Mrs. Abbie Conner, is said to live at
Toeka.
Mi?s Heckart had gone to the coal
box near the station for a bucket of
coal when attacked. The robber se
cured less than three dollars from the
ca'-h drawer. He escaped across the
river near town and is reported to
have been seen early today near Len
apc, Kan.

EMMA RIPKE FREED.
The Jury In 30 Minutes Returns Ver.
diet of Not Guilty.
Council BlufTs, la., Dec. 6. The
jury in the case of Emma Ripke, the
Hanover, Kan., girl charged with the
murder of Frank K. Potts, on the
night of October 15 last, late yester
day returned a verdict of not guilty.
The jury was out 30 minutes.
The case hinged on the question of
whether Potts committed suicide or
was shot by the girl, and the evidence
introduced to show that Potts had fre
quently threatened to commit suicide
apparently outweighed that of the
prosecution.
IIUfiDWpLLION
New Stock to Be Issued by Santa
Fe Railroad.
Meeting of Stockholders Called
for Topeka on January 30.
New York, Dec. 6. The directors of
the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe at
a meeting in this city formulated a fin
ancial plan which is expected to meet
the necessities of the road for many
years. The plan Is similar to that
adopted by the New York Central about
a year ago, when the authorized capital
of that svstem was increased from
$150,000,000 to $250,000,000.
The Atchison also will make an in
crease to $250,000,000, but the amount of
new stock recommended by the direc
tors is about $98,000,000, somewhat less
than that authorized by the Central. The
directors called a special meeting of
the stockholders for January 30 at To
peka to vote upon the proposed in
crease. The circular to stockholders will be
Issued today or Friday. It will be com
prehensive in Its terms and the resolu
tion submitted for approval will confer
upon the directors authority to issue any
part of the stock or convertible bonds
with the stock as security, in their dis
cretion. About $26,000,000 of the stock, one of
the directors, said today, or a like
amount of convertible bonds will be is
sued In all probability early in Febru
ary, but whether bonds or stock will not
be finally determined until that time.
The company, the directors added,
has no floating debt and about $15,
000.000 in the bank, but its increased
business requires increased facilities for
handling the business.
RYAN SAYS LINE UP.
Tells Democratic Legislators Not to
Vote for Republican Senator.
If the Democratic members of the
legislature are Inclined to follow the
wishes and opinions of W. H. Ryan,
chairman of the Democratic state cen
tral committee. Col. W. A. Harris, the
Democratic candidate for governor at
the recent election, will bo the caucus
nominee of the Democrats for United
States senator. Mr. Ryan believes that
the Democratic legislators will vote as
a unit for a Democrat for the L'nited
States senatorshlp, although the vote
will be in the nature of a complimen
tary one. He does not see any reason
why any Democrat or any number of
them should turn their votes over to
any of the Republican candidates and
he thinks that their votes should be
given to Col. Harris.
Mr. Ryan is in the city today for the
purpose of making arrangements to
keep the headquarters of the Demo
cratic State Central committee at the
Hotel Throop open during the session
of the legislature as a meeting place
for the Democrats of that body. He
had a conference with W. H. Kemper,
the treasurer of the committee, on this
subject this morning and it was decid
ed by them to have commodious head
quarters open at the Throop during the
session. He also talked over with sev
eral of the Democrats in town the pre
liminary arrangements for the banquet
of the Kansas Democratic club which
will be held here some time in Feb
ruary. "It seems to me," said Mr. Ryan,
"that it would be courteous appre
ciation of his efforts for the Democrat
ic cause in this state for the Democrat
ic members of the legislature to ten
der Col. Harris their vote for United
States senator. I have talked with
none of them about the matter. It is
just my idea that this Is the proper
thing for them to do. I know of no
reason why any of the Democrat
should vote for a Republican and any
honor that the Democrats could be
stow on Col. Harris is due him. I have
heard nothing of an effort being made
by Col. William F. Sapp to become the
caucus nominee of the Democrats for
the United States senatorshlp."
ACTION SUSPENDED.
Secretary Shaw Holds Vp Approval of
Public Building Sites.
Washington, Dec. 6. Secretary Shaw
has ordered action suspended on the
approval of all sites for public build
ings in Kansas.
It was owing to some difficulty with
a site at Manhattan that came to the
secretary's knowledge. It was claimed
that the site recommended is sometimes
five feet under water. Congressman
Murdcck wont to the secretary of the
treasury and had the matter of the
site at Newton exempted from the sec
retary's order, and it is now going
through the process of approval. He
found that It was not necessary for the
Kansas legislature to pass a special act
ceding the site to the government, as a
general act is already in effect cover
ing the subject.

BOILERSJLEW UP
Big Shoe Factory Destroyed by
Explosion and Fire.
Flames Sweep Over Two Acres
of Manufacturing District.
12 DWELLINGS BURNED
Several Persons Injured and
Financial Loss 450,000.
Disaster Occurred as Operatives
Were (Joins to Work.
Lynn, Mass., Dec. 6. The boilers of
the P. J. Harney Shoe Manufacturing
company of this city blew up today, in
juring several persons and causing
heavy financial Ices.
The explosion, besides shattering the
big four story factory of the Harney
company, wrecked several buildings
nearby in the crowded manufacturing
districts. Fires immediately broke out.
A heavy southeast gale was blowing
and the flames soon were beyond the
control of the local fire department.
Help was called from Boston. In an
hour's time two acres In the west Lynn
district had been burned over, ruining
the premises of more than a half dozen
business firms, mostly shoe manufac
turers, and destroying 12 dwellings in
Charles street, principally occupied by
colored people.
The explosion occurred just before 7
o'clock as the factory operatives were
assembling tor work.
The firms whose property was dam
aged include the P. J. Harney Shoe
company, Tufts & Friedman Shoe com
pany, H. F. Hood creamery, Boston &
Maine West Lynn railroad station, Ja
cobs Leather Stock company, and the
M. J. Worthley Shoe company.
The force of the explosion burst the
four machinery loaded floors of the
Harney factory and lifted the roof.
The wreckage spread outward, shatter
ing the walls of nearby structures and
aiding the spread of the flames, de
spite the heavy snow and sleet storm
that had started early in the" day.
In a brief space of time the West
Lynn station of the Boston & Maine
railroad was on fire. Unchecked by
the wind gap occupied by the railroad
tracks, the flames reached structures
on the other side, licking up first the
leather stock factory of the Jacobs
company, and then sweeping through
the district covered by small wooden
tenements.
At 9 o'clock the police reported that
apparently no persons had been killed,
but up to-that time nine persons had
been taken to the hospital. It is be
lieved that none was fatally hurt.
By 9 o'clock the fire was under con
trol with a financial loss estimated at
$430,000.
THAW TRIAL IN SPRING.
Slayer of Stanford White Must Spend
Christmas In Jail.
New York, Dec. 6. The trial of Harry
Thaw for the murder of Stanford White,
the architect, will not begin until March
or April of next year, unless District At
torney Jerome consents to rearrange his
coart calendars. This was the an
nouncement made today at the district
attorney's office.
After notice was served on Mr. Jerome
by Thaw's counsel, that a motion would
be made for the appointment of a com
mission to take the testimony of wit
nesses outside the state, Mr. Jerome in
anticipation that the motion would be
granted, set about to arrange his court
calendars and has tne lists all made out
for the first two and part of third
months of next year.
Yesterday Mr. Jerome received notice
from Clifford W. Hartridge, of Thaw's
counsel, that he would withdraw the
motion for the appointme.t of commis
sion which was argued on Monday last,
there' hoping, it was said, to secure
an earlv trial for his client, but now
that the calendars have been prepared
it is not likely that his hope will be
realized.
WANT 550,000,000.
That Amount Asked for Improving
Waterways.
Washington, Dec. 6. Nearly a
thousand delegates are in Washington
In attendance of today's session of the
opening of the National Rivers and
Harbors congress.
Speaker Cannon and Representative
XSUriOIl, t-Uttll iliaw ... .
mittee on rivers and harbors, are
among the speakers.
The object of the convention is to
secure r.n annual appropriation of
$50,000,000 from congress for syste
matic work in the improvements of
the nation's waterways.
Representative Ransdell (La.) who
has made a tour of 20,000 miles
around the country In behalf of the
rivers and harbors movement, will re
port to the convention that he has
found the sentiment to be in favor of a
vigorous prosecution of waterways im
provement as a remedy for the
"wholly inadequate transportation fa
cilities now afforded by the railroads."
SPECIAL MESSAGE.
The President Asks Authority to Dis
miss Officers.
Washington, Dec. 6. The president
has sent a special message to congress
urging giving the executive authority
on his own initiative and responsibility
to dismiss any officer whom he thinks
unworthy to remain in the service. The
law at present provides that in time of
peace no officer shall be dismissed ex
cept in pursuance of a court martial or
in mitigation thereof. This provision the
president wants repealed.
Illustrating the necessity of the leg
islation desired, the president cites the
case of a naval officer whose name is
not given, but who was accused of "in
decent and disgusting behavior."
He was convicted but the court to his
surprise, the president says, did not
sentence him to dismissal.

Washington, Dec. 6. A modification
of the Galllnger ship subsidy bill was
suggested by Chairman Grosvenor, at
today's meeting of the house committee,
on merchant marine and fisheries. He
expressed a willingness lo strike out
subsidiaries for Transatlantic and Af
rican steamship lines, thus confining the
government aid to Oriental and South
American lines. No vote: was taken but
Mr. Grosvenor will, prepare a revised
bill for the consideration of the com
mittee. In its changed form the Gal

tary Root in his Kansas City speech.

Washington, Dec. 6. Senator Bever
idge introduced a bill today to amend
the meat inspection act by requiring
that the cost of inspection shall be

IT COST 519,604,749.
Expense of Keeping Up the Navy for
One Year.
Washington. Dec: 6. It cost $19,
604r749 to keep, the ships of Uncle
Sam's navy in- commission during the
past - fiscal year, according to the an
nual report of Paymaster General H. T.
B. Harris. The battleship Ohio was
the most expensive craft, for it cost to
put her in commission and keep her in
service for. the twelve frranths $714,
245. The armored cruiser Colorado
was also a costly ship, $5.24.057 having
been expended on her during the fiscal
year. Admiral Schley's old flagship,
the Brooklyn, cost $399,830 to keep in
commission for one year. The cruiser
Baltimore of Manila fame, required the
expenditure of $326,691 to keep her in
active service, and the cruiser Chicago,
one of the first ships pf the new navy,
cost $387,794 to keep afloat and on
active duty. The battleship Iowa on
which Admiral Evans, then captain,
engaged in the battle off Santiago, re
quired the expenditure of $428,048
during the fiscal ' year and Captain
Clark's famous old Oregon cost for
maintenance $398,422. The new ar
mored cruiser Pennsylvania cost more
than half a million dollars to commis
sion and run last year, the Texas con
sumed $303,906, and the triple screw
cruiser Minneapolis $335,562. Her sis
ter ship, Columbia, which has been
doing much cruising in connection with
trips to Panama and in landing the
army of Cuban pacification, cost $308,
258. Admiral Dewey's old flagship
Olympia cost almost an even quarter
of a million to maintain.
The building of new ships, including
labor and material, cost, during the
last fiscal vear, $31,764,556, and repairs
to ships $5,550,309. The sum of $262,
034 was expended on the naval militia
of the states.
As an evidence of thrift of the blue
jackets the paymaster general shows
that in the past fiscal year they de
posited with the paymasters $636,980:
they were repaid $734,867. which with
accumulated interests on the total sav
ings on repayment amounted to $951,
652. The paymaster general says that In
view of the past unsatisfactory experi
ence with commutations of rations and
particularly as the new navy ration is
considered sufficient in all respects to
actually subsist the men it would seem
that the time has surely come 'when
commutation should cease. His report
expresses gratification over the prac
tical elimination of the middleman and
speculator in bidding for naval supplies
and the fact that the number of repu
table dealers and manufacturers not
heretofore dealing with the navy has
materially increased.
RING LINGS' BIG DEAL
Purchase the HasenljccU Circus for a
Consideration of $500,000.
Chicago. Dec. 6. By the purchase
of Carl Hacenbeck's trained animals,
the Ringling Brothers will be able to
dominate the circus business in Amer
ica Hajenbeck's circus is now in its
winter Quarters at New Orleans. But
the deal bv which Ringling Brothers
secured control of the big collection of
trained animals was consummated at
Baraboo, Wis., winter quarters of the
Ringling Brothers' show. The finan
cial consideration involved was said to
be $500,000.
It is the intention of the proprietors
of Hagenbeck's circus to double the
collection of trained animals and put
the show on the road next season en
tirely independent cf the Ringling
Brothers' circus, except that it will be
under the same management.
TTnder the plans proposed by the
new proprietors, the Hagenbeck show
will next season give employment to
1,150 persons and will require eighty
railroad cars to transport it through

RAILROAD SAYS NO
Kock Island Keluses to Make
Harvest Hand Bate.
Not Much Show to Aid Decatur
County Farmers.
SEED 200 MORE MEN.
Kailroad Claims Special Bate
Would Violate New Law.
T. B. Gerow Says Bailroad Is
Dodging the Issue.
Farmers in Decatur county, especial
ly in the vicinity of Norcatur, are act
ually in crying needs of hands to husk
their corn. There was an unusual corn
crop in this county this fall. It is way
up In the northwestern corner of the
state, and not easily accessible from
points where laboring men and farm
hands congregate so the farmers have
been unable to secure the necessary men
to husk their corn. They need easily
more tnan 200 such men and have ap
pealed - to T. B. Gerow, head of the
state's free employment bureau for
hel?.
Some time ago Mr. Gerow thought he
saw a way of getting the needed men
there if he could prevail on the Chi
cago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway
company to put In the usual special har
vest rate of one cent a mile for this
number of men. Mr. Gerow thought
and thinks he can get this number in
the vicinity of Kansas City.
He got a reply from the passenger de
partment of the Rock Island saying that
it did not see its way clear to put in
such a rate at this time and in this re
ply was an intimation that the new
interstate commerce law would prevent
the making of such a rate.
This law does not go into effect unti'.
January 1 and Mr. Gerow does not think
that it would interfere in the making
of such a rate, particularly In view of
the fact that the railroads In the state
are making excursion rates now for a
variety of events, and for the holidays
as well. He has so written to the rail
road company but has had no further
communication from them.
"This is the first time . in my ex
perience," said Mr. Gerow today, "that
I have been asked to furnish so many
farm hands for any one particular lo
cality at this time of the year. Dur
ing the regular harvest season the
railroads have been very kind in put
ting in special harvest rates and un
less a special rate is put in by the
Rock Island now, I do not think it
will be possible to get the men needed
out there. You see It Is so far away
that the one way fare is about $10.50
and this is too much to expect laborers
and farm ..hands to pay,-although the
wages offered them are exceptionally
high., because they can easily find
work these daj-s much nearer the cen
ters of population where they are wont
to congregate when they are not
working. If a regular harvest rate
should be granted, I think I would
have no trouble in getting the re
quired number of men. I do not see
how the interstate commerce law
could affect this proposition because
the rate would be made between
points within this state and over which
the interstate commerce law would
have no jurisdiction."
INTEREST IN ADVANCE.
Secretary of Treasury Giles Notifica
tion to Bondholders.
Washington. Dee. 6. The secretary
of the treasury has given notice to the
holders of L'nited States bonds that the
interest maturing on the several inter
est dates between and including Janu
ary, October and May, 1907, will be
paid without rebate on and after De
cember 15. 1906.
Checks for the interest due January
1, 1907, on registered bonds will be
mailed to the owners on or before the
15th inst. The amount of interest
which may thus be paid is $12,000,000.
The action taken releases for use in
the business of the country a sum prac
tically equal to the surplus receipts
for November and December.
MUST BE WELL TIED UP
Postoffiee Slaking Rules for Handling
of Christmas Mail.
Preparations for handling an ex
pected immense Christmas business are
going on at the postoffiee which is the
center of excitement for the giver of
gifts.
Four extra carriers will be put Into
service to carry packages exclusively.
The ordinary mail will not pass
through their hands at all. Only the
gifts that Santa Claus. designs for his
friends will fall to their lot. At the
central postorHce two substitute clerks
will be added to the force already
employed.
In the hall leading to the money or
der and stamp departments a man will
be placed to weigh articles and pack
ages which are expected to be mailed.
Postmaster A. K. Rodgers has evolved
this scheme in order to facilitate the
handling cf the great amount of pack
ages which swamps the office at this
time of the year. Packages insecurely
tied or without an address on will not
be weighed and marked with the
necessary amount of stamps. So many
parcels tied in a slipshod manner are
received that this precaution to insure
proper handling is absolutely neces
sary. Before presenting the packages
for weighing they should be addressed
and tied securely.
OPENING POSTPONED.
Five More Days in Which to Bid on
Bis Pasture Lsnds.
Washington. Dec. 6. Secretary of
the Interior Hitchcock today issued an
order postponing from the 10th to the
lSth'tTie opening of sealed bids for the
pasture and wood reserve lands in the
Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Indian
reservation in Oklahoma. The secre
tary's action was taken because recent
heavy rains and hih waters in the
streams have delayed the mails and
rendered it impossible for prospective
bidders to examine the lands.
GOING STILL LOWER.
Weather Foreeast Is for Six Degree
Weather on -Friday.
Today's climate has been a good deal
as was predicted by the local weather
bureau yesterday. It is much cooler
and the air Is dry and crisp. However,
the snow which was promised failed to
put in an appearance. There is quite a
little wind which Increases the intensity
of the cold.
The forecast for tomorrw Is for con
tinued colder weather which will proba
bly do much to equalize the warm
weather during the earlier part of the
week. The temperature tomorrow will
be about six degrees above zero.
The wind today is blowing at the rate
of 20 miles an hour from the north.

FOUR TlfilES IN 3 YEARS
Clifton, Arizona, Has Been Washed
From Its Foundation.
Solomonville, Ariz., Dec. 6. Additional
and late details of the Clifton flood dis
aster indicate a most deplorable condi
tion among the inhabitants and a tre
mendous loss of property. Practically
every building in the town is damaged
and many were swept entirely away.
Numerous escapes irora death are re
ported, as the first of the flood came
without warning. Two men were swept
through the streets and saved them
selves by catching, the awnings of a
store and breaking through the plate
glass front. Patients in the hospital
were placed in a car and sent to higher
ground before the flood reached the
building.
Monday night in Clifton was a veri
table night of terror, as practically the
entire population stood upon tf.e hills.
unsheltered. It is expected that many
persons in the Mexican quarter were
drowned, of whom no one has any
knowledge. No accurate estimate of the
damage can be given out, but it will run
into the hundreds of thousands of dol
lars. It is believed that the town will
never be rebuilt in its present location.
as this is . fourth flood in the district
within three years.
MORE MANDAMUS SUITS
Carr Taylor Files Four Actions Against
Missouri Pacific in Supreme Court.
Carr W. Taylor, attorney for the
board of railroad commissioners, has
gone to the supreme court to compel
the Missouri Pacific Railway company
to obey the mandates of the board.
Along in August the board ordered
the Missouri Pacific- to reopen the de
pots at Amiot, Anderson county, at
Fremont, McPherson county, and at
Daw, Washington county, and also to
construct a depot at Arnold, Ness coun
ty, in order that the shipping business
and the public might be properly and
promptly attended to at these points.
In October the board also directed the
Missouri Pacific to construct a side
track in Mills. Rush county, to serve the

COMMISSION OF FIVE.
This Recommendation Will Be Made
for Topekn's City Government.
A commission of five is the recom
mendation which ex-Mayor W. S. Ber
gundthal and F. G. Drenning, city at
torney, special committee to Investigate
the commission system of government,
will make at their meeting this evening
at the council chamber. The meeting
will open at 8 o'clock and the report
upon which both gentlemen have col
laborated will be read. The report is a
lengthy one and relates the experiences
of the trip and workings of the systems
as they found them in Kuston and Gal
veston. The latter city is said to be
governed upon more businesslike lines
than Houston and is freer from political
domination. The Galveston plan of
making every commissioner on a par
and giving the chairman no powers of
veto is approved.
SICKNESS NOT SERIOUS
Alarming Reports Concerning Eugene
Hagan's Condition Exaggerated.
It was reported last night that
Eugene Hagan was stricken with a
cerebral hemorrhage while sitting
with his family at lunch. The doctors
who were called on the case have re
fused to make a statement, though
they claim that his condition is not as
serious as reported. Mrs. Hagan made
the following statement to the State
Jovrnal this afternoon: "I am at loss
to understand how the report which
seems to be so general started as Mr.
Hagan was not stricken with a cere
bral hemorrhage but is 111 from an at
tack of a rheumatic trouble from
which he has suffered at various times
in the past. While he is ill and will
probably be confined to his home for a
week or so his condition is not consid
ered serious either by the doctors or
myself."
SEIZED CARS OF COAL.
Cowley County Citizens Confiscate
Fuel Belonging to Company.
Winfield. Kan., Dec. 6. Reports
from Atlanta and Latham, towns in
this county, are that while several car
loads of coal passing through there en
ro-.-.te to Winfield were standing on the
track awaiting orders, citizens of the
town went out and compelled the
trainmen to uncouple the cars and
back them on the siding. The cars
were quickly unloaded at both towns
by residents who offered pay for the
coal. The railroad agent refused.
The coal famine in this section is
getting serious.

Not Been (Julte So Numerous.
Washington, Dec. 6. The only vital
patronage matter in which the Kansas
delegation will be involved this winter
is the L'nited States marshalship for
Kansas. There may be other patronage
matters of minor nature, and things
affecting the new state of Oklahoma.
but the Kansas marshalship Is the big
thing.
It Is probable that the members of
the house delegation will not take any
conspicuous part in this content, though
individual members will of course, have
their preferences. It is therefore pro
bable that Senators Lonir and Benson
will determine whether William H.
Mackey, Jr., of Junction City, is to suc-
ceeu mmseii or not.
Very little consideration has yet been
given the matter by the Kansas sena
tors, although they discussed it with
friends and supporters before leaving
the. state. During the campaign the
matter was not up to any great extent,
and since the election. Senator Long
was engaged actively and wholly, until
his return here a week ago, with mat
ters pertaining to the spec ial committee
of the senate to investigate certain af
fairs in Indian Territory, of which he
was a member.
Since returning to Washington, how
ever, and getting settled for the work
of the session, the two senators have
frequently been in - consultation over
this and other matters. Neither has any
disposition to discuss it at all; but It Is
known that the question is considerably
engrossing.
Both Senator Long and Senator Ben
son have received numerous indorse
ments of Mr. Mackey within the past
week, and the marshal himself has ac
cumulated an imposing pile of them
which he has forwarded on for con
sideration. Mr. Mackey's chief opponent, A. A.
Richards of Wellington, has not flood
ed the senators with indorsements, but
has not failed in making his ambition
apparent.
Mr. Alackey's predecessor, Littleton
S. Crum, was one of the earlv Burton
appointees in 1901. He died, however In
1902, and Mr. Mackey was appointed' in
September of that year, during the re
cess of congress. He was therefore not
confirmed until December 9, 1902. His
commission therefore d.-rted from that
date, and a new appointment may be '
made on that date.
So far there has been no influx of
Kansas politicians here on the matter,
and it is not probable that there will be
The appointment of marshal for Kan
sas will complete the filling of the "bl.?
four" places. H. J. Bone, succeeding
John S. Dean, was appointed United
States district attorney just about a
year ago, being the first of these "big ;
four" appointees to go into office under
the dispensation of Senator Long.
James M. Simpson, collector of internal
revenue, and Wilder S. Metcalf, pension
agent for Kansas, Missouri, Colorado,
Oklahoma, and Indian Territory fol
lowed in January of this year.
When it comes to Oklahoma patron
age, the influence of Kansas will also
be sought, but it is not nearly so vital
a question with the Kansas delegation
a-s the present contest for marshal of
Kansas. For judge of the eastern dis
trict of Oklahoma, at least two KanFas
men. at present federal judges there,
Joseph A. Gill and Joseph T. Dickerson,
will be applicants.
TREATY WITH JAPAN.
A New One Is in Process of Negotia
tion. Washington, Dec. 6. Viscount Aokl,
the Japanese embassador, vent to the
White House yesterday at the invita
tion of the president. They discussed
a proposition to negotiate an entirely
new treaty, specifically recognizing the
right of each country to exclude the
laborers of the other.
Such a provision is contained in the
present treaty, but both the president
and the Japanese embassador thought It
would satisfy the pride of the Japanese
if their rights to treat Americans as
Americans treat them were recognized.
It was also believed that such a new
treaty would please the people of Cali
fornia and show them that the presi
dent was prepared to go to the extent
of excluding the coolie Japanese if It
should become necessary. It Is said that
Secretary Root under the direction of
the president Is actually engaged in the
negotiation of a new treaty with Japan
which will specifically admit the peopla
of that nation to the same rights of
education as are granted to European
aliens, no more and no less.
COSTS MORE TO LIVE.
A Marked Advance In Prices Is Shown
in One Month.
New York, Dec. 6. Figures giving
the average cost of living on December
1. compiled by R. G. Dun & Co., show
that there has been a marked advance
in price as compared with November 1,
when it reached a high water mark.
In the lapse of one month the cost
of living has advanced from $106.6S
to $108.17, reached on December 1.
The cost of commodities is the highest
since February, 1884.
Iu discussing the subject, the trade
authority says the rise in prices is
"fairly representative of the greater
demand that has followed increased
prosperity throughout the nation and
because of the advances in wage
which have lifted the purchasing power
of the people above all previous record!
in this or any other nation."
