THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. £
President Roosevelt sent his an
nual message to Congress on Tues- 1
day. Like its predecessors, it is a
voluminous affair; and while there J
are many matters of great interest
to everyone, its length precludes the 'J
probability of its being read by u
t i f*
everybody. v
J J |
The message has the intonation of ,
a sermon; its good features are \
bound to stand out in spite of this
glaring characteristic of all the Presi- s
dent’s utterances, yet we think it t
could have been couched in more at- s
tractive language. When it is re- s
membered that this document is sup- 1
posed to be directed primarily to the ,
brightest men of our country, it be- f
ing sent to both houses of Congress, -
which are supposed to contain our '
brainiest men, we think that a more .
respectful tone would have been in t
keeping with the dignity of the occa- i
sion. t
Tbc message is a mixture of Demo- !
cratic and Republican doctrine. All
that is good in Democracy, President i
Roosevelt has not hesitated to again i
appropriate. While he puts forth his ;
original idea of a hereditary tax on ,
swollen fortunes, yet he also urges i
wi:h great consistency the adoption t
of a graduated income tax. The I
Democrats of this country have al- .
ways stood for a measure of this i
kind, and during President Cleve- i
land’s second administration such a i
law was passed, but afterwards de- i
dared unconstitutional by the Su- <
preme Court of the United States.
Following this thought, the Presi- i
dent claims the right to criticise the i
acts of our courts, and in this con
tention he has a precedent set by
Thomas Jefferson, who did not hesi- ■
tate to flav the judiciary whenever
W I
he saw fit.
His utterances on lynching are far
more sane than the views of the or
dinary northern man. He points
out that the great shame of the ne
gro race is its tendency to try to hide
the crime of its fellow members. He
believes that swift trials and quick
punishments should follow each of
fense, and that this is the most cer
tain preventative.
He urges the passage of an eight
hour bill for railroad employees, and
candemns the practice of allowing
children to work in factories, which
is denounced as a crime.
The Japanese question receives
serious consideration. The Presi
dent on this point will probably ar
ray his own party in the western
states against him, as there is a
growing belief that Japanese labor is
■as dangerous to American interests
as Chinese labor. He is unstinted in
his praise of the Japanese and gives
them great credit for what they have
done.
The message taken as a whole is
probably in keeping with a great
many of the President’s other utter
ances. It will be remembered that
he was loud in his determination to
have a provision for a court review
in the railroad rate law, yet when the
‘ powers that be” cracked the party
whip, Mr. Roosevelt tumbled into
line with the rest of his Republican
associates,
—The death of Samuel Spencer,
who was killed in a railroad acci
dent on the Southern railway, of
which he was president, was a great
shock to the whole country. Mr. i
Spencer was on his way to North ■
Carolina to enjoy his annual Thanks
giving outing, and in his party were
Messrs. Frank T. Redwood and
Charles D. Fisher, of Baltimore, both ,
of whom were also killed. Mr.
Spencer was one of the greatest rail- ■
road men that this country has ever ;
produced. He was president of the ■
I’.altimore and Ohio railroad when
less than 4-0 years of age, and after
wards became associated with the
banking firm of J. Pierpont Morgan
and Company to manage the rail
road interests of this great corpora
tion. His place will be difficult to
fill. ,
—President Roosevelt sent the fol- ■
lowing appointments to the Senate
on Monday: Secretary of the Treas- '
ury, George B. Cortelyou, of New
York; Attorney General, Charles •
Joseph Bonaparte, of Maryland; Sec
retary of the Navy, Victor H. Met
calf, of California; Secretary of the '
Interior, James Rudolph Garfield, of
< Miio; Secretary of Commerce and
1-abor, OscarS. Straus, of New York;
Associate Judge of the Supreme
Court, William H, Moody, of Massa
chusetts.
—General L. Victor Baughman,
one of Maryland’s most prominent
citizens, died at his home, in Fred
erick, on Friday evening. He was
held in the highest esteem by the
people of his entire State, and was
marked for high public preferment,
had his health permitted.
FEEDING CATTLE FOR MARKIT.
Reported especially lor The --Hgis.
The Deer Creek Farmers’ Club was royally
□ tertained at the residence of Mr. H. B.
Iruns on Saturday evening. Owing to con
litions which could not be controlled, the
Lttendance of members was not large, but
t was none the less enthusiastic and enjoy
ible.
President John Moores and Messrs. \V. B.
rlopkins, John B. Wysong, G. G. Strcett, J.
McCormick, F. H. Jacobs and John 1).
.Yorthington responded to the roll call, and
Messrs. John H. Reckon!, Garnett Radc
)augh, Joseph I*. Deck man, Harry Norris,
[oseph A. Harris and G. Smith Norris were
Among the guests.
As Mr. Bruns’ home is not located on his
arm, no committee of inspection was ap
pointed, but no account of the meeting
.vould be a just one without some reference
:o Mr. Bruns’ farm.
Located on the Woolsey pike, about one
irid a half miles from the town, its nearly
three hundred acres slope gently to the
louthern sun until they reach Bynum's run,
where a tifty-aere meadow has during the
past five years developed a wonderful growth
pf natural green grass and frequently affords
pasture for fifty cattle for months at a time.
Mr. Bruns has owned this farm for seven
fears, during which its improvement has
been wonderful; the dwelling is modest, and
the other buildings large but inexpensive, ex
:ept an immense stone tilo.
But the well-watered fields, covered with
the best of grass and dotted over with some
times hundreds of stock, are the traveler’s
wonder and Mr. Bruns’ pride. The place has
been thus rapidly improved by heavy graz
ing. liberal application of manure hauled
from the town, and good farming. A valu
able adjunct to the farm is its quarry of fine
building stones, which arc scarce and high in
this section.
The subject of the evening was “Feeding
Cattle for Market.” The host, Mr. Bruns,
being n specialist in this line, was requested
to discuss the subject at length in its various
bearings.
Mr. Bruns said in part: “It is vitally im
portant in feeding cattle to start right, anti
in my judgment many of our farmers here
make a mistake. I would advise that cattle
be sufficiently forced to be placed on the mar
ket in late June or August, while prices are
good, grass is still .abundant and flics arc not
vet troublesome; the farmer should then buy
in August, if possible, a bunch of cattle to be I
pushed through the tall and early winter and
sold on the top January market. In this
way lie turns over two lots in the year and
strikes the best market for both lots. The
cattle should be so selected and fed so as to
be ready tor the market in the shortest pos
sible time; recently 1 placed on the market
104- cattle at an advance of $1,200, which I
had carried for only two months, and in ad
dition to the direct profit, the fertilizer re
sulting from feeding them was certainly
worth $350 more. A silo is tin indispen
sable requisite of successful feeding; 15 acres
of good corn silcagc will feed 05 cattle for 6
months, and their gain, especially with some
bran or cotton seed meal added, will be very
gratifying. 1 opened my silo on the Bth of
last month and started a bunch of cattle,
and 22 days after, despite some stormy
weather, they’ have made an average gain of
4-4- pounds apiece. One of the great advan
tages of feeding is the fertilizer; 1 annually
top dress at least 40 acres, and a further ad
vantage to the ground is their tramping,
which packs the soil and holds the grass, and
their cutting old stiff sod with their feet in
the spring of the year. I advise that, where
a man is properly situated to handle them,
he purchase first-class cattle weighing at
least 1,000 pounds, and finish them for
the market season as soon as possible. 1
may add that loss from death among cattle
is generally light, while last year I lost
$1.32.5 worth of horses in a single week ’’
Mr. John H. Reekord said; “My experi
ence in feeding cattle is slight. Last May I
bought a bunch of cattle from Mr. Bruns for
four cents, pastured six months and sold
them for four cents, making a profit of sl2
I thought the profit small, but I have been
advised that 1 did very well.”
Mr. Radebaugh said; “I do not handle
cattle, but have my stables full of cows. I
give them the best treatment, with a full
balanced ration, and am well pleased with
the result. Rich corn ensilage is the founda
tion of my feeding, while I get the necessary
protein from bran, distiller's grain or cotton
seed meal. At present, ten of my twenty
cows arc yielding 23 gallons of milk daily,
ami the other ten will soon be in profit."
Mr. William B. Hopkins said : *T have not
been encouraged with cattle feeding at pres
ent prices of stoekers during recent years. I
fed last season a bunch Jof excellent steers
which cost 4L 4 cents. Thev ate a large quantity
of corn, and 1 got only 4 :J t cents for them last
summer. Ido not consider this profitable,
and it docs not compare at all favorably
with the net revenue I receive from a herd of
cows. Havre dc Grace is my ordinary mar
ket for both fat cattle and dairy products ”
Mr. John B. Wysong said he had had no
experience in regular feeding of cattle
through the winter, but from his observa
tion he believed that if the stock was bought
right and well cared for, it would yield a fair
profit."
Mr. J. L. McCormick said; “My experi
ence in cattle feeding has been limited My
attention has been chiefly given to dairying.
I have found, however, that if agood quality
of stock is bought, well handled and sold
early, that the profit is satisfactory. I con
sider the silo indispensable in feeding both
cattle and cows, and would not think ol do
ing without it."
Mr. John D. Worthington said : “When
feeding cattle, have in view a definite market
and get yonr stock ready for it. The first
requisite towards a satisfactory sale is to
have the cattle fat. which we seldom do.
For this reason, unless handling two lots an
nually', as outlined by Mr. Bruns, I would
advise that about half of one’s cattle should
be well fed and prepared for the June or July
market, thus leaving an abundance of grass
during the dry months of August and Sep
tember for the remaining half. We followed
this course during the past year, and while
the gross profit was about the same on each
bunch, it would probably have been far less
if the whole drove hail been kept till October
and sold with the vast flood of grassers
which at this time demoralize the market. I
prefer a two-year-old stoeker of good qual
ity’, weighing 850 pounds, but sometimes the
most money is made by buying tails because
of their low cost; thev will sell all right if
made real fat. I would not like to feed with
out a silo."
Mr. Frank H. Jacobs said: "We handle a
good many cattle and generally make a fair
profit; this year I made ado Mar a hundred
advance and put on 425 pounds at my home.
At another farm I placed cattle which cost
2* 2 cents, and few people would have fed, but
more than doubled the money invested. At
the present price of corn and hay, I do not
believe we can afford to feed much to cattle.
There is nothing pays better on a farm than
a little bunch of sheep."
Mr. G. Smith Norris advocated feeding off
half of one’s cattle in June and the other half
in October. He usually buys small cattle,
winters them on rough provender and fin
ishes them off with green corn during the
month of October. He has had cattle in
crease in weight as much as 500 pounds dur
ing the year.
President Moores said: “I generally buy a
cheap grade of cattle, feed them on straw
and fodder during the winter and finish them
with green corn in the fall, ordinarily’ in
creasing their weight 525 pounds by’ the last
of November. I always make it a rule to
have plenty of grass—more grass than cattle.
When thus fattened, complaint is not made
about quality. Flics area serious drawback
to fattening cattle in the summer ; I believe
they cost us 2o per cent, of the possible gain,
and hope some day to see a satisfactory
remedy against them I have always been
friendly to cattle feeding and would not
know how to farm without engaging in this
branch of the business."
An invitation from the Farmers' League of
Maryland to attend their annual meeting in
Baltimore on December 2< was presented to
the club. Messrs. Moores and were
appointed delegates, with the understanding
that as many members as possible would at
tend. Adjourned.
For Thin
Babies
Fat is of great account
to a baby; that is why
babies are fat. If your
baby is scrawny, Scott’s
Emulsion is what he
wants. The health\ T baby
stores as fat what it does
not need immediately for
bone and muscle. Fat
babies are happy ; they do
not cry ; they are rich ;
their fat is 1 ai d up for
time of need. They are
happy because they are
comfortable. The fat sur
rounds their little nerves
and cushions them. When
they are scrawny those
nerves are hurt at every
ungentle touch. They
delight in Scott’s Emul
sion. It is as sweet as
wholesome to them.

Makers Of Clothing With Merit.
Worth Knowing*
i
The effect of tasty wearing apparel is great
ly underestimated. It is true that clothes do
not make the man, but it is also true that
they help him to make himself. The man of
neat appearance has a decided advantage
over his less fortunate, or, more correctly, less
careful, neighbor. It is impossible for per
sons of moderate circumstances to wear fine
clothes; it is, however, within the power of
everyone to wear stylish clothes. To furnish
the serviceable, every-day suit with the cor
rect style, at a moderate price is only
possible for manufacturing houses. To
say that the garments purchased from us
have this correct style would be re
dundant. The newest fashions in the best
goods tor the least money is our motto. We
can follow out this idea, for we arc a manu
facturing house. The materials go practi
cally from producer to consumer, without
leaving our hands. The saving in cost and
consequently in selling price is obvious. In
bujdng clothes from the New York Clothing
House you combine the advantages of made
to-order apparel and the reasonable prices of
the retail merchant.

A prominent farmer told us today that he had been trying the ?, r *' n 8
which is being offered around here, and when he tried the CONTINENTAL
GLUTEN FEED his milk increased 5 gallons (20 per cent.)
This is not new, and anybody who will use the Continental will get the same
results, and we can prove it. ,
What does 20 per cent, mean to a man feeding cows
It means that if you are getting 15e. per gallon for milk, it is equivalent to 18c.

will get it.
