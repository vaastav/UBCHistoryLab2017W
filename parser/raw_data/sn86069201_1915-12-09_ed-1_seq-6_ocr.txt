MESSAGE
Declares That if Full Navy

We Will Have a Fieri For
Defense That Will Be
"Fitted to Our Needs and
Worthy of Our Traditions."
Greatest Danger to Country
Comes From Within Our
Borders.
of bow necessary it Is that we should
hasten their building.
There Is, i venture to point out. an
especial significance Just now attach
Ing to this whole matter of drawing
tbe Americas together In bonds of hon
orable partnership und mutual advan
tage because of the economic readjust
ments which tbe world must Inevitably
witness within the next generation,
when peace shall have at last resumed
Its healthful tasks. In tbo perform
ance of these tasks I bellevo the Amer
icas to be destined to play tbelr parts
together. I am Interested to Ox your
attcntlou on this prospect now because
unless you take It within your view
and permit tbe full slgnttlcance of it to
command your thought I cannot mid
the right light In which to set forth
tho particular matter that lies at tbe
very front of my whole thought as 1
address you today, 1 mean national
defense.
No one who really comprehends' tbe
spirit of tbo great pcoplo for whom we
are appointed to speak can fall to per
ceive that tbelr passion Is for peace,
their genius best displayed in tbo prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent They do not
seek or desire war. Their thought is
of individual liberty and of tbo free
labor that supports Ufo and tbo un
censored thought that quickens It.
Conquest and dominion are not In our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples, nut Just because we demand un
molested development and tbe undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We do more than that. We demand it
also for others. We do not confine oar
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to the Inci
dents and movements of affairs wblcb
affect only ourselves. We feel It wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of independence
and right. From tbe first we bare
made common cause with; all partisans
of liberty on this side the-sea and have
deemed it as important that oar neigh
bors should be free from ail atstde
domination as that we ourselves should
be; have set America aside as- a whole
for tbe uses of Independent nations) and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all ear
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting tbe rights of ai peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without; We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses wblcb are as necessary
In times of peace as In times of war.
and wo shall always sco to It that o tu
rn llltary peace establishment is no
larger than is actually and continuous
ly needed for the uses of days In. which
no enemies move against us. nut wo
do bellevo In a body of free citizens
ready and sufficient to take care- ef
themselves und of the governments
wblcb tbey have set up to serve them.
In
our constitutions themselves we
have commanded that "the right of
the people to keep nnd bear arms shall
not be Infringed." and our confidence
bas been that our safety In times of
anger would lie In tbe rising of the
nation to lake care of Itself, as tbe
farmers rose ut Lexington.

tbo plans of tbe department of war for

conceived which will be laid before

and put Into effect as soon ns they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed
They seem to me tho essential flrl
steps, and they ncrm to me for the
present sufficient.
They contemplate un Increase of the
standing force of the regular army

service, cseclally the all Important J
duty of training the citizen forvo of
which 1 shall presently speak, 702 lion
commissioned officers for service in
drill, recruiting and the like and the
necessary quota of eullsled men for
tbe quartermaster corps, tho hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are tbo nddltlons necessary to render
tbe army adequate for Its present du
ties, duties wblcb It bas to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our Interior
army posts, but also lu tbe Philippine.
In the Hawaiian Islands, nt the lth
mils nnd In Porto tllcu
By way of making tbo country ready
to assert some part of Its real power
promptly and upon n larger scnle
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
bv a force of 4UO.O0O disciplined citl
zens, raised In Increments of ixi.000 n
year throughout u period of three
years. This it Is proposed to do by n
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of tho country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes of tmln
Ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors nt call
at any time throughout an additional
furlough period of three years. TbH
force of (00.000 men would be pro
vided with personal uccoutennents as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for tho Held made ready to bo supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training nt stated Intervals at
convenient places In association wttb
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months In
tho year.
It would depend upon tbe patriotic
feeling of the younger men of the
country whether they responded to
such a call to service or not. It
would depend upon tbe patriotic spirit
of tbo employers of tbe country wheth
er tbey made It possible for tbe young
er men in their employ to respond un
der favorable conditions or not. I for
one do not doubt tbe patriotic devotion
either of our young men or of tbose
who give them employment thoso for
whose benefit and protection they
would In fact enlist I would look
forward to the success of such an ex
periment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of pre pars-
tloo for defense seems to me to bo ab
solutely imperative now. We cannot
do less.

of the country for tbo congress, to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the

and efficiency und to press that plan

There are other great matters w tilth
will be thrust upon uur attention
whether wo will er not There Is. for
example, a very pressing question of
trade und shipping Inrotvnl lu tbl
great problem of national adequacy
It is necessary tor many weighty rea
sons of national efflcletcy and devi l
opment that we- should bare a great
merchant marine. T.ne great mercuaiit
fleet we once used to matu us rich.
tbat great tKxly uf sturdy sailors who
used to carry our flag Into- every sen.
and who were tbo- pride and often the
bulwark of tbe nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by Inexcusable
neglect and Indifference and by a hoe
lessly blind und provincial petb-y of
so called economic protection. It Is
high time wo repaired our mUtake and
resumed our commercial Independence
on tbe seas.
For It Is a question of Independence.
If other nations go to war or seek to
hamper each other's commerce our
mercbsnts. It seems, are ac tfielr mer
cy to do with as they please. We must
use their ships and use tbem. a tbey
determine. We have not ship enoagh
of our own. We cannot handle oar
own commerce on tbe seas. Our ode
pendenco Is provincial, and: Is- only on
land and within our own borders, We
are not likely to be iiermltted to use
even tbe ships of other nations in ri
valry of tbelr own trodo undiare- with
out means to extend our coinmerve
even where the doors are wide open
and our goods desired. Such, a situa
tion is not to be endured, it is of capi
tal importance not only that the Unit
ed States should bo Its owm carrier on
the seas and enjoy tbe economic Inde
pendence which only an, adequate
merchant marine would cli-e- It but
also that tbe American hemisphere as
a wbolo should enjoy a like Independ
ence and self sufficiency, IC It Is not
to bo drawn Into tbe taugle-ot ICnro
pean affairs. Without such. Independ
ence tbo wbolo question ot our ollt
leal unity and self dctermluutUm Is
very seriously clouded nnd corapuVaird
Indeed.
Moreover, wo mu develop, no true or
effective American jwllcy without ship
of our own nut ships of. war, hot
ships of peace, carrying good and car
rying much more: creating frleudsuliw
and rendering ludlspvusablo mttvlces to
all Interests ou this side- the water.
Tbey must more constantly back and
forth between. tbo Americas. They are
tbo only shuttles tbat can ave i In
delicate fabric of sympathy, compre
hension, confidence and mutual de
pendence lu which wo- wish, lo clothe
our policy of Amerlcni for Americans.
The task of building up an adequate
merchant marlno for America private

achloved every other like task among
us In tbe past, with admirable enter
prise, Intclllgcnco- and: rigor, and It

tbey are, singularly enough, yet to be

It Is made my duty by Uw whenever
tbe estimates of expenditure- exceed
the estimates of revenue to call tbe
attention of tbe congress to tbe fact
and suggest any means of meeting the
deficiency that It may be wise or
stble for me to suggest i aim ready
to believe that It would be my duty to
do so In any case, and I feeli particu
larly bound to spe.-tk of the matter
when It appears tbat Hie dcflcluncy will
arise directly out of the adoption by
tho cougress of measures which I my
self urge It to adopt. Allow me there
fore to speak briefly of tho- priwot
state of ibe treasury and of. tbe fiscal
problems which the next year will
probably disclose.
On the 80th of Juuo lu.c there was
an available balance In the general
fund of tbo treasury oC tlOU7U.lKi.78.
Tbo total estimated' receipts for tbe
year 1010, on tbe aasuniptlou tbat tbe
emergency revenue measure passed by
tbe last congress will not be extended
beyond Its present limit, the 31st of
December. 1015. and' that the present
duty of 1 cent per ound em sugar will
be discontinued ufton the 1st of May.
lOltt, will bo $070,3113.500. The balance
of June last and tiles estimated rev
enues come therefore, to a grand total
of J 774 .535.003.78. The total estimated
disbursements for the present fiscal
year. Including twenty-five millions for
tho Panama canali twelve millions for
probable deficiency appropriations and
$50,000 for mlscellnneous debt redenii
tions, will bo $753.S0!.0(O. nnd tho bal
nnce In the general fund of tho treas
ury will bo reduced to JM.OH. 003.73.
The emergency revenue act if contin
ued beyoud Its present tlnio limitation
would produce during the bait year
then remaining about forty-one mil
lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound
on sugar If continued would produce
during the two months of the fiscal
year remaining after tbe 1st of May
about fifteen millions. These two sums,
amounting together to flfty-slx mil
lions. If added to tbe revenues of tbo
second half of tbe fiscal year would
yield the treasury at tbe end of tbe
year an available balance of Ttl.tHI.
003.7a Tbe additional revenues required to
carry out tbe program of military and
naral preparation of which I bare
poken would, as at present estimated,
