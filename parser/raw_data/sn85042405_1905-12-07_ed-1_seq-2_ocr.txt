President Roosevelt's annual message
lias been delivered to congress. Open
ing with a plea for the co-operation of
all classes in continuing the country's
prosperity and in correcting existing
avils, for a "square deal" for every
body, the message first takes up the
Eite
uestion of corporations and railroad
legislation. The president says:
Corporations.
I am In no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This Is an age of combination,
end any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but in the
end vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce
law inevitably produces. The corpora
tion has come to stay, just as the
-trades union has come to stay. Each
-*:an do and has done great good. Each
iBhould be favored so long as It does
good. But each should be sharply
checked where It acts against law and
justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
-that It Is useless to try to get any ade
quate regulation and supervision of
The laws of the congress and of the
aeveral states hitherto, as passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
•to showing that the states have no
•power In the matter than that the na
jtional government has power so that
there at present exists a very unfortu
nate condition of things, under which
these great corporations doing an in
terstate business occupy the position of
aubjects without a sovereign, neither
any state government nor the national
government having effective control
over them. Our steady aim should bo
monweaith abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this coun
try, but also in England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
Railroad Rate LeglKlation.
As 1 said in my message of Dec. 0
last, the immediate and most pressing
need so far as legislation is concerned
Is the enactment into law of some
Bchemo to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged in inter
state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
Include putting a complete stop to re
bates in every shape and form. This
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powers over the business world, should
be exercised with moderation, caution
and self restraint, but it should exist,
so that it can be effectively exercised
.when the need arises.
In my judgment, the most important
provision which such law should con
tain is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power
to decide upon the case being brought
{before it whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
Just, and if it is found to be unreason
able and unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to prescribe
Jtbe limit of rate beyond which it shall
not be lawful to go—the maximum
reasonable rate, as it is commonly call
ed—this decision to go Into effect with
in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
t»jr the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low a rate,
la such case the commission would
fcave the right to fix this already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
pad it would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to cure
gailroad companies of the practice of
jiving improper minimum rates. I call
•our attention to the fact that my pro
-posal is not to give the commission
It is worth while considering whether
It would not be. wise to confer, on the
Cainst
verament the right of civil action
the beneficiary of a rebate for
It least twice the value of the rebate.
Sbls would help stop what is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should
lie stopped, for they have now grown
to such an extent that they are demor
alizing and. are used as rebates.

charges is just as pernicious as a re

-There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common carriers. Only in
this way can violations or evasions of
the law be svyely detected. A system
of examination of railroad accounts
should be provided similar to that now
conducted into the national banks by
the bank examiners. A few firsts class
railroad accountants, if they had prop
er direction and proper authority to in
spect books aifd papers, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola
tions of the law.
Employers' Liability Law.
In my annual message to the Fifty
eighth congress at its second session I
recommended the passage of an em
ployers' liability law for the District of
Columbia and In our navy yards. I re
newed that recommendation in my
message to the Fifty-eighth congress at
its second session and further suggest
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of em
ployers' liability with a view to the en
actment of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
these great corporations by state ac- all industries within the scope of the! serious change in these methods ren
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by a
•overeign whose jurisdiction is coex
ttensive with the field work of the cor
porations—that Is, by the national gov
xrnment. I believe that this regulation
and supervision can be obtained by the
«nactment of law by the congress. If
this proves impossible, It will certainly
*be necessary ultimately to confer in
There has been demand for depriving
courts of the ^ower to issue injunctions
In labor disputes. Such special limita-
ercise of the power to call a strike by a
labor leader would justify the denial of
the right to strike. The remedy Is to
regulate the procedure by requiring the
judge to give due notice to the adverse
parties before granting the writ, the
hearing to be ex parte if the adverse
party does not appear at the time and
place ordered. What is due notice must
depend upon the facts of the case. It

that the nsilioual government provide
some goneril measure for the protec
tion from k'oukc of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what I
trust will be your favorable consider
ation.
As to Women AVlio Work.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough inves
tigation of the conditions of women in
industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo-j
men are now engaged in gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important as it is vast and
complicated. The introduction of wo
men into industry is working change
and disturbance in the domestic and .
social life of the nation. The decrease
in marriage, and especially in the birth
rate, has been coincident with it. We
must face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
be made, but surely it can be made
with less friction and less harmful ef
fects on family life than is now the
case. This whole matter in reality
forms one of the greatest sociological
phenomena of our time. It is a social
question of the first Importance, of far
greater importance than any merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer and employee inter
ested, but also a third party—the gen
eral public. Every considerable labor
difficulty in which Interstate commerce
la Involved should be Investigated by
the government and the facts officially
reported to the public.
Insurance.
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose. business has extended so far
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states., In my
last annual message I recommended
power
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
tions in insurance." Recent events
have emphasized the importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
this question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
thanthe several states have been able
to furnish against corruption of the
flagrant kind, which has been exposed.
It has been only too dearly shown
that certain of the men at the head of
these large corporations take but small
note of the ethical distinction between
honesty and dishonesty. They draw
the line only this (Me of what may be
called law honesty, the kind of honesty

the great profession of the law, and in
the growth o£ a spirit which condemns
all dishonesty, whether in rich man or
in poor man, whether it takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much

only drastic, but practical. There is
need of a far stricter and more uni

Interests of this country. The United
States should in this respect follow the
policy of other nations by providing
adequate national supervision of com
mercial interests which are clearly na
tional in character.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should consider
whether the federal government has
any power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions in in
surance of an interstate character.
That state supervision has proved in
adequate is generally conceded.
The Revenues.
There Is more need of stability than
of the attempt to attain an ideal per
fection in the methods of raising rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
business world certain to attend any
grave reason. It is not possible to lay
down any general rule by which to de
termine the moment when the reasons
for will outweigh the reasons against
such a change. No change can be
by one section or one state only. There
must be something like a general agree
ment among the citizens of the several
states. that the change is needed and
desired in the interest of the people as a
whole, and there should then be a sin
cere, intelligent and disinterested ef
fort to make it in such shape as will
combine, so far as possible, the maxi
mum of good to the people at large
with the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special interests of locali
ties or classes, but in time of peace
the revenue must, on the average,
can
jjich it is not already author-
be kept within the revenues then

revenue laws must be readjusted.
such a readjustment should take, for
it is as yet too early to say whether
there will be need for it. It should be
considered whether it is not desirable
that the tariff laws should provide for
applying as against or in favor of any
other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
treatment between other nations and
ourselves.
Economy In Expenditures.
I earnestly recommend to the con
gress the need of economy and, to this
end, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria
tions. All unnecessary offices "should
bo abolished. In the public printing
also a large savihg of money can be
made. There is a constantly growing
tendency to publish masses of unim
portant information at which no human
being ever looks.
Yet, in speaking of economy, I must
in nowise be understood as advocating
the false economy which is in the end
the worst extravagance. To cut down
In the navy would be a crime against
the nation. To fail to push forward all
work on the Panama canal would be
as great a folly.
Currency.
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist in an inadequate
volume of money, but in the rigidity
of this volume, which does not respond
as it should to the varying needs of
communities and of seasons. Inflation
must be avoided, but some provision
should be made that will insure a
larger volume of money during the fall
and winter months than in the less ac
tive seasons of the year, so that the
currency will contract against specula
tion and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business. At present the
treasury department is at Irregularly
recurring intervals obliged In the inter

the interests of the American public—

Business Methods In Departments.
At various times I have Instituted in
vestigations ii the organization and
conduct of the business of the execu
tive departments. While none of these
inquiries have yet progressed far
enough to warrant final conclusions,
they have already confirmed and em
phasized the general impression that
the organization of the departments is
often faulty in principle and wasteful
In results, while many of their business
methods are antiquated and Inefficient.
I recommend that the congress consider

The Hague Conference.
The first conference of nations held
at The Hague in 1899, being unable to
dispose of all the business before it,
recommended the consideration and
settlement of a number of important
questions by another conference to be
called subsequently and at an early
date. These questions were the follow
ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu
trals (2) the limitation of the armed
forces on land and sea and of military
budgets (3) the use of new types and
calibers of military and naval guns (4)
the Inviolability of private propAty at
Bea In times of war (5) the bombard
ment of ports, cities and villages by na

peace, justice and good will.
Monroe Doctrine.
There are certain essential points
which must never be forgotten as re
gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first
place, we must as a nation make it ev
ident that we do not intend to treat it
in any shape or way as an excuse for
aggrandizement on our part at the ex
pense of the republics to the south.
doctrine does not force us to interfere
to prevent the punishment of a port
save to see that the punishment does
not assume the form of territorial occu
pation in any shape. The case is more
difficult when it refers to a contractual
obligation. This country would cer
tainly decline to go to war to prevent a
foreign government from collecting a
just debt. On the other hand, it is
very inadvisable to permit any foreign i
power to take possession, even tempo- 1
rarily, of the custom houses of an
American republic in order to enforce
the payment of its obligations, for such
temporary occupation might turn into
a permanent occupation. The only es
cape from these alternatives may at
any time be that we must ourselves
undertake to bring about some arrange
ment by which so much as possible of
a just obligation shall be paid. I

Accordingly, the executive depart
ment of our government negotiated a

From all the powers acceptance was

the condition that we should wait until

this war, in a note presented to the

Santo Domingo has now made an ap

of wisdom, but every generous instinct

or later this government may be In
volved in serious difflcultie^with for

else may be forced itself to'intervene

ion.
Army and Navy.
I do not believe that any army in the
world has a better average of enlisted
mail or a better type of junior officer,
but the army should be trained to act
effectively iu a mass. Provision should
be made by sufficient appropriations
for maneuvers of a practical kind.
Provision should be made for the pro
motion of exceptionally meritorious
men over the heads of their comrades
and for the retirement of all men who
have reached a given age without get
ting beyond a given rank.
There should be an increase in the
coast artillery force so that our coast
fortifications can be in some degree
adequately manned. There is special
need for an increase and reorganization
of the medical department of the army.
Ia both the army and navy there must
be the same thorough training for duty
In the staff corps as in the fighting line.
The importance of this was shown' con
clusively in the Spanish-American and
the Russo-Japanese wars. The work
of the medical departments in the Jap
anese army and navy is especially
worthy of study.
Our navy must, relatively to the na
vies of other nations, always be of
greater size than our army. We have
most wisely continued for a number of
years to build up our navy, and it
has now reached a fairly high standard
of efficiency. This standard must not
only be maintained, but increased. It
does not seem to me necessary, how
ever, that the na^y. should, at least in
to our navy each year, thfe superseded
or outworn vessels being laid up or
broken up as they are thus replaced.
Naturalization.
On this subject I recommend
First.—A federal bureau of naturali
zation, to be established in the depart
ment of commerce and labor, to su
pervise the administration of the natu
ralization laws and to receive returns
of naturalizations pending and accom
plished.
Second—Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be charged, and
procedure.
Third.—More exacting qualifications
for citizenship.
Fourth.—The preliminary declaration
of intention to be abolished and no
alien to be naturalized until at least
ninety days after the filing of his peti
tion.
Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize
aliens to be confined to United States
district courts and to such state courts
as have jurisdiction in civil actions in
which the amount in controversy is un
limited in cities of over 100.000 inhab
itants the United States district courts
to have exclusive jurisdiction In the
naturalization of the alien residents of
such cities.
Criminal Laws.
In my last message I asked the at
tention of the congress to the urgent
need of action to make our criminal
law more effective, hnd I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to

this subject

Interest of dishonest or grasping cred

to take such a position offers the only
possible way of Insuring us against a
clash with some foreign power. The
position is therefore in the interest of
peace as well as in the interest of jus-?
tice.
There seems to be no statute of the
punishment of a United States attor
ney or other officer of the government
who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do

act when the consideration for such
corrupt agreement is other than one

Merchant Marine.
To the spread of oar trade in peace

themselves. The conditions in Ghinai

mately come under the head of unde

But in the effort to carry out the pol-..
Icy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi
nese coolies, grave injustice and wrong
have been done by this nation to the
people of China and therefore ultimate
ly to this nation itself. Chinese stu
dents, business and professional men
of all kinds, not only merchants, but
bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro
fessors, travelers and the like should
be encouraged to come here and treat
ed on precisely the same footing that
we treat students, business men, trav
elers and the like of other nations.
As a people we have talked much of
the open door in China, and we expect,
and quite rightly intend to insist upon,
Justice being shown us by the Chinese.
But we cannot expect to receive equity
unless we do equity.
The Civil Service.
Heads of executive departments and
members of the commission bave call
ed my attention to the fact that the
rule requiring a filing of charges and
three days' notice before an employee
could be separated from the service for
Inefficiency has served no good pur
pose whatever. Experience has shown
that the rule is wholly ineffective to
save any man if a. superior for im
proper reasons wishes to remove him
and Is mischievous because it some
times serves to keep in the service in
competent men not guilty of specifio
wrongdoing. Having these facts in
view, the rule has been amended by
providing that where the inefficiency or
Incapacity comes within the personal
knowledge of the head of a department
the removal may be made without no
tice, the reasons therefor being filed
and made a record of the department.
The absolute right of removal rests
where it always has rested, with the
head of a department The change is
merely one of procedure. It was much
needed, and it is producing good re
sults.
Our copyright laws need revision.
Philippines and Other Islands.
During the last year the Philippine
Islands have been slowly recovering
from the series of disasters which since
'American occupation have greatly re
duced the amount of agricultural prod
ucts below what was produced In Span
ish times.
The agricultural conditions of the Is
lands enforce more strongly than ever
the argument in favor of reducing the
tariff on the products of the Philippine
Islands entering the United States. I
earnestly recommeud that the tariff
now imposed by the Dingley bill upon
the products of the Philippine Islands
be entirely removed, except the tiiriif
on sugar and tobacco, and that that
tariff be reduced to 25 per cent of the
present rates under the Dingley act:,
that after July 1, 1909, the tariff upon
tobacco and sugar produced in the
Philippine Islands be entirely removed
and that free trade between the islands
and the United States in the products
of each country then be provided for
by law.
In my judgment, Immediate steps
should be taken for the fortification of
Hawaii. This is the most important
point in the Pacific to fortify in order
to cbnserve the interests of this coun
try. It would be hard to overstate the
importance o( this need. Hawaii is too
heavily taxed. Laws should be enact
ed setting aside for a period of, say,
twenty years 75 per cent of the internal
revenue and customs receipts from Ha
waii as a special fund to be expended
in the islands.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico.
I wish also to call the attention of
the congress to one question which af
fects our insular possessions generally
—namely, the need of an increased lib
erality in the treatment of the wholo.
franchise question in these Islands..
I earnestly ask that Alaska be given
an elective delegate.
Admission to Statehood.
I recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma be admitted as one state
and that. New Mexico^ and Arizona be
admitted as one state.
The Panama Canal.
Active work-in canal construction,
mainly preparatory, has been In prog
ress for less than a year and a half.
During that period two points about
Hie canal bave ceased to bo open to,.,
debate. First, the question of route
second, the question of feasibility. The
point which remains unsettled is wh^®1
or the canal shall be one of several
lodes above sea level or at seal level
with a-Single tide lock. Qn this point

In addition to sanitating the isthmus,
