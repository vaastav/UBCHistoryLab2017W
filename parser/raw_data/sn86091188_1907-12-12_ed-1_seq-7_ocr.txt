1 read this much of the tecord,
which 1 hop- you may take time to
read more of, to show that this man
Reed 8ninot, whom Mr Hopkins des
ignates as a "Christian gentleman,
is not only not a Christian any more
than a pagan may he called a Chris
tian, and that while so far as the
records show, he does not practice
polygamy, he preaches and teaches
polygamy and stands for a man for
president of bia organization who
openly admit« that he la violating
the law of bis country in the manner
above stated. And Mr. Hopkins de
fends bis position upon the 'ground
that Reed Smoot ts not an acturl po
lygamist; that be only teaches and
advises the divine right to commit
this crime, and then draws the cloak
of religion around him and says
"don't blame me for teaching this
doctrine, because thta is a part of my
religion." The supreme court of the
United States has held in these po
lygamist cyses that while every man
is entitled to the most perfect liberty
of conscience and the right of free
dom in religious worship, they go
further and asy that no man may
commit a crime nad seek to justify
that crime by saying it is a part of
his religious belief. And none of
these cases where a defense of polyg
amy was offered that It was a part of
their religious belief, tbe court
said; "Suppose a church would also
teach the right to sacrifice the lives
of children. Wouln any one say that
that was right because it was a part
of the religious rights, ceremonies or
beliefs?
When Mr. Hopkins was u member
of congress the poor little preacher
Roberts knocked at the door of cong
ress. Mr. Hopkins in his righteous
indignation said, "tills man is a po
lygamist," and voted to kick him
out, but when be, Mr. Hopkins gets
Into the United States senate, there
knocks at the door of that body a
man from a church controlled by con
fidence men at the expense of #2,000,
000 annually which they wring from
the poor dupes as tithes, Mr Hop
kins says to him, "Why, my^dear sir,
have you a certificate from the state
of Utah? Are you of legal age to be
a senator?" Yes." "And do you
preach the violation of the law and
teach tbe doctrine and uphold the
organization that is practicing po
lygaray?" ''Yes, but I don't prac
tice it." "All right," says Brother
Hopkins, "walk in and take a seat
with the elect."
Ladies and gentlemen, do you
know that under the law of this
country, that tbe one who teaches
others to violate the law is worse
than the man who violates it? The
mao who breaks the law bus some
courage while the man who teaches
others to break it is a coward
When the anarchists of Chicago
threw the bomb and killed our police
officers we couldn't prove who threw
tbe bomb but we found an organize
tlon something after the form of the
Mormon church, with a name and
purpose. The purpose was death to
all officers of tbe law and the men
who paid tbe penalty of tbelr lives
for the death of our police officers
wer« simply tbe teachers of the in
ramous doctrine of anarchy. That
was sustained by the supreme court
of the state of Illinois and it is not
only a law but It Is justice. Sup
pose an anarchist should knock at
the door of the senate. Brother Hop
kins.would meet him aud say, "Have
you a certificate from a sovereign
state?" "Yes. Are you of lawful
age? "Yes." "But the senate of
the United States has a right to
judge of your right to sit here and
want to know if you are an anar
chist?" "Yes." "What are your
principles?" "We teach death t<> all
officers of the law, from the presi
dent down to the police. We believe
It is our duty to use tiie gun, the
knife and the tiomb, to destroy any
one who seeks to govern another.
But, Mr. Hopkins, 1 have only
preached this all my life; I never
killed an officer nr police. I have
only been a teacher, tiie head teach
er of tiie school," and according^to
the nopkins doctrine lie will o(«en
the door and say, "come in, Mr. An
archist; as long as you don't practice
what you preach, come right in and
help make laws in the government
that vou teach ought to be de
stroyed."
Why, do you remember tiie char
acter of Faglu, who had tbe school
in London town to teach i*>ys how to
steal and where to hide their stolen
goods? Imagine him knocking at
tbe door aod ^St. Feter saying. "Are
you Fagln?" "Yes." "Don't you
have a school for thieves" "Yes. 1
taught the boys how to steal, but 1
never stole anything myself." And,

seat Mr. Smoot. lie has been here
In Yandalla, and explained why. If
Mr. Stnoot Is elected again—and be
wili be, Brother Hopkina will natur
ally vote to seat him again, and if 1
am successful in the present raee for
the United States senate, 1 will vote
to keep him out. If you nelleve that
a man who takes an oath of vengeance
against our government ought to help
make laws for your government, then
you ought to support Mr. Hopkins.
If vou don't believe that, then you
ought to aupt>ort me or some other
man who agrees with me on this sub
ject.
I wish to reply partly to Mr. Hop
kins' legal proposition that the sen
ate has no right to unseat a man f~r
anything that happened before be
was elected. The constitution pro
vides, as Mr. Hopkins says, certain
qualifications for a senator, hut it
also provides that the senate Itself
shall tie the judge of the qualifies'
lions of Its own members, so that
for years, since the organization of
the senate, men have iieen unseated
and refused admittance hy reason of
conditions almost exactly like this,
it will be necessary to cite hut one
case. Senator Clark, of Montana,
was of lawful age that a certificate
from the sovereign state of Montana.
He sat there for months while bis
case was being investigated and was
unseated by tbe vote of the senate
hecuse tiie senate believed be bad
purchased ids election. I could cine
you numberless cases, which can be
fuund in tiie reporta of the senate,
trom which 1 have already quoted,
but I haven't Die time. Nearly all
those cases can tie found in Site senate
report to which i have referred.
Ladles and gentlemen, if the men
who voted for Heed Smoot did so
conscientiously, isn't It remarkable
that it took them so Icrig to make up
tbelr minds herore they took a vote
on tills question? Four years after a
million of tiie Christian women of
this country petitioned for the re
moval of Reed Smoot: four years
these great constitutional lawyers
(which Mi. Hopkins admits he is)
took to consider the merits of his
ease, ami finally, when they found
hey had votes enough, they permit
ted a vote on tills question. One of
the worst mistakes Mr. Hopkins
makes now, and one of tiie most un
fair thin'gs he ts doing, is to go
around tills state pretending that
the seating of Reed Smoot was a re
publican measure, and saying that
only a lew democrats voted to seat
Smoot. 1 deny it. It ^is absolutely
untrue that the seating of Iteed
Smoot was a party measure. If 1
had time, 1 would read you the
names of the republican senutors that
voted against the seating of Reed
Smoot, and the senators that Mr.
Hopkins would like to read out of
the party as a party measure. First
of all, Hale, of Maine, who succeeded
that stlawart republican, .ran.es O.
Blaine. Then Senator^Burrows, who
is chairman of tiie committee, and
who heard every bit of tbe tesltiuony
to seat Smoot. Senator Clapp, of
Minnesota, Senator llemmingway,
of Indiana. who succeeded Vice Präs
iden Fairbanks as a Senator, Kit
tredge, of Sout Dakota, one of the
foremost lawyers of the country all
are to be read out of the republican
party mainly because, as Mr. Hop
kins says, if tie had voted against
Heed Smoot, he would tiave voted
with the democrats.
Is it fair for him to say that it is a
party question, when no paity caucus
was ever held on that subject?
know something about the proceed
ings there, and it is a practice of tbe
republican party to hold a caucus for
the consideration of party questions
to which all republicans are invited
No sucli caucus was ever held to seat
Heed Smoot. And let me say to you
now, gentlemen, that no party,
publican or democratic, will dare go
through tiie country with one of the
planks of Its plat form endorsing the
sealing of Reed Smoot as a party
policy. You can't carry this couuty
on that piutform, you can't carr
this district on that platform, you
can t carry this state on that plat
form, and you can't carry any state
in tiie United States on that plat
form, except Utah.
How can Mr. Hopkins, with any
degree of propriety and frankness
say that this is a party question
when tiie majority report, which
was in favor of ur.seatlng Heed
Siuoot, was a republican committee?

that President Roosevelt had soot

Mr. Hopkins, thought was right. J
hope you will read that letter. Tbe

have voted for Reed Smoot had be 1

Hopkins, and gives him a statement j
that he believe* Mr. Hopkins was
F.very senator there who voted I
against Smoot, and every senator '
bad

markable thing, ladles snd gentle- j
men, that he shoo'd ask any such en
doiseruent from the president? I
who voted for him, could have
tbe same kind of a letter from i'reei-1
dent Ifooaevelt if they had applied j
it. isn't It remarkable that |

* - - - ■ uie presl
I President, give me a certificate of
that I may take back to
the Ladies and gentlemen,
dent wrote another letter on thls|
subject. It was more than a letter
watt a message to congress. He
asked Mr. Hopkins, and ail of tbe
senators, that In view of the fact
congress oouid not prohibit polygamy
in Utah because It was a state,
that they might submit to the peo
an ameitdment to the .constitu
to that congress could tear « ut
great crime of slavery.
The president used this language
that message. I read an extract
from Ute president's message asking
that congress lie given power to stop
polygamy within the slates;
"It Is neither safe nor proper to
laeve the question or polygamy t< be
dealt with by certain states. When
borne ties are looeened, when men
and women cease to regard a healthy
family life as the tiesl worth living,
then evil days are come to the com
monwealth. "
This l* a plea hy the president to
tbe senate of the United States to
give him power to atop polygamy
where he is no* powerless. If polyg
amy has been practically stopped
slpce tiie manifesto, why In the
name of common sense did Theodore
Roosevelt ask for an Increased power
con g I ess to atop that crime? He
begged congress in Una message, dur
ing last congress, to give him the
power to atop polygamy, and Mr.
Hopkins answers the president's re
quest by seating one of tbe twelve
apostles, and tiie leading teacher ol
the doctrine of polygamy, as a Unit
ed Sûtes senator.
1 disagree, also, utterly with Mr
Hopkins when lie claims t liât any
state can establish a "stale church'
and "require the taxpayers of that
state to support that church." In
order 'that there may be no mlsun
demanding, I will read from Sena
tor liopkine' speech in the Heed
Smoot case, at page 24 :
I wish to call tbe attention oi tiie
sonatas that, there is nothing in tiie
constitution of tiie United States
that prohibits a state from having
an established church. If tiie people
of the state of Michigan can revise
their state constitution so as to te
quire tbe taxpayers of that state to
pay annually a certain sum for tiie
maintenance of tiie Episcopal, the
Catholic, the Presbyterian or the
Methodist or any oilier church, sucli
i clause in the constitution of Mlchl
gati or any other Independent state
of the republic would not be untag
onlstio to anything contained In tiie
constitution of the United ^States
It is true that when tiie slates del
egated power to the government hy
the constitution, they did not
specially attempt to limit themselves
in the matter of religious liberty
There arc many tilings which are
omitted in tiie constitution, the ilo
ng of which would be so repugimn
the spirit of tiie constitution
and the institutions of this govern
ment that they would lie held to be
unconstitutional. Whether there
anything in the constitution seeking
limit the (tower of the states
regard to tbe establialinienl of the
cburcli or not, the courts have time
and again held that such a tax as'
Mr. Hopkins says can be laid to com
pel ''taxpayers of that slate to pay
annually a certain turn for t.lic main
tenance of the church," would tie ut
terly repugnant to the constitution
of the Cnitcd States, for it would
deprive tiie taxpayer of his property
without due process of law, and with
out "Just compensation."
If Mr. Hopklr.s is right, then Utah
can amend its constitution, ^pass a
law establishing the Mormon church,
and compel citizens of Illinois, who
owu property In Utah, to support
that church or be deprived of tlieir
property. The supreme court, of the
United States In tiie case of Downs
vs. Bldwell:
There are certain principles of
natural justice inherent In tiie Anglo
Saxon character which need no ex
pression In constitutions ot statutes
to give them effect."
In tiie last biography and public
record of Albert J. Hopkins, Issued
by him, without signature, from Ills
headquarters in the Federal build
ing In Chicago, as shown by his liter
ature, he speaks thus modestly of
himself :
" "The position taken hy Senator
Tlopklns In the Smoot case not only
places him in the front rank of
American constitutional lawyers, but
showed him to have tiie courage of
his convictions "
It is refreshing to have Mr. Hop
kins admit that lie Is a "great con
stltutlonal lawyer," and It Is to be
regretted that no one else, except
him, has ever oliscrved this (similar
ity, and 1 now challenge him and hi
friends to get any gentleman, who

think 1 ha»e answered Mr. Hop- {
kirn' statement that Read Smoot
discouraged polygamy by quoting
from Mr. Reed Smoot's own evidence
that while knowing that the presi
dent of the church had live wives
and forty-three children, he had
never protested against his conduct,
and never Intended to. I think i
hsve shown that in the Third
Judicial Court of Utah found that
the oath of vengeance taken by Mor
mon* against this government was
exactly the same as found by the
senate committee, and when tiie
court fourni that John Moore and
llllam J. Kdgar had taken the ex
act. oath that Reed Smoot had taken,
the court uses this language and ex
cluded these two ^gentlemen from
citizenship:
The evidence establishes beyond
any reasonable doubt that the endow
ment ceremonies are Inconsistent
with the oath an applicant for citi
zenship is required to tike, and that
tie oaths, obligat ions, or covenant*
there made or entered into are In
compatible with tiie obligations and
duties <>f citizens of the United
states."
Is It not a remarkable thing that
that organization of slave-owners,
who were deprived hy the court from
citizenship in Ikrttt, have now
gained In wealth, power and influence
that, witli the same oath of ven
geance upon tlmlr lips arid in theit
hearts, they can now become law
makers for our country? Mr. Hop
kina says, In his speech, which l
have quoted from, at page 2»; "The
oath that was taken by Senator
Smooot when he beecame a morutier
of the senate of the United States
supersedes any oath that he may
nave taken at any period previous in
life " How does that statement nf
aw agree with the decision of the
Utah court? li Mr. Hopkins is
rigid in that, then the court is wrong
in saying that tire endowment oath
was incompatible with the oaths
necessary for a citizen to take.
The truth of the whole matter It
that tire Mormon society la deter
uined to gain control of tins govern
uenl ; they are determined, if pos
•tble, to make respectable their
cencliinite of polygamous slavery.
They do control absolutely Utah, and
with the balance of power In at least
t wo or three other states they hope
id elect Mormons, some of whom w ill
tie republican* and some democrats,
nut when the test comet and they
'lave u balance of power In the Unit
'd States sénat« (and we have fre
quently seen when two or three men
could furnish the balance of power
iielweeti the parties), then the in
dustrial and political differences will
melt Into thin air- Uten tiie republi
can cloak and the neuiocrat Ic cloak
will tie torn aside and the men who
ire sent to tiie senate to carry out
the present scheme« of t list church
nay lie republicans, democrats or
Americans, but above all, they will
he Mormons, first, last and all toe
time.
I was told the other day that my
ibjectlotis to tills church were mere
ly sentimental. I do not adjult that,
but In considering quest ions of law,
no man can is* entirely depilved of
sentiment. The American home is
I lie greatest of American institu
tions. That we lead the nations of
the world In the march of civiliza
tion is due to tiie high standard of
the American borne, and no more
disastrous blow can he at ruck to the
American home than the seatiug of
a United States senator who leaches
leg redat Ion of American women.
The standing of every nation in the
world, so far as civilization Is con
cerned, can be determined by the
treatment awarded to the mother*
of the nation. Who is to govern
this country In a few years? The
liovs who are today getting the In
spirations of patriotism from their
mothers. Can we forget the state
ments of Lincoln, Garfield and Mc
Kinley, every one of whom said in
substance: "All that I am I owe to
my mother." F'or half a century the
women of this country have Iieen ob
liged In shame to sckriowledgc that
polygamy Is practiced under tiie il.ig
of our dear country, and that in some
States then; Is not enough pub'ic
sentiment to pass and enforce a law
against it.
The president lias appealed to con
gress to amend our constitution so
that congress may deal with poljg
aruy, and tiie senate of the United
States replies to that message of Hie
president by referring the president s
message to tbe dead-house of the
senate committee, and rebukes tbe
verv suggestion by seating one of the
