Baltimore, Md., December 4.—The I
bitter enmity which arose some months
ago be^eenRotort Garrett, President of
the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and Mr.
Henry Janes, in regard to the portico I
which Mr. Garrett has put on the front of
of his new house adjoining the Jones
mansion, on Mt. Vernon Place, has |
assumed a decidedly Interesting phase.
Mr. Janes last summer applied for an in
junction against the completion of the
portico, and gained his case. Then Mr.
Garrett took it to the Court of Appeals,
where it now is. During the past
twenty-four hours the residents
within the precincts of Mt. Vernon
Place, sacred to society and the famous
group of Barye statues, have been terror
stricken over a report that Mr. Janes had
said that in case the Court of Appeals
decided against him he would give his
house and grounds next door to Mr. Gar
rett's to a colored orphan asylum. The I
property Is worth about $ 16Q,000, but as
Mr. Janes is a millionaire* and the part
ner of Mr. Enoch Pratt, who' recently
gave the city over a million for a free clr
culatlng library, he will probably not serf
fer from want through his generosity.
Of course the wealthy Mt. Vernon people
are wild with anxiety, knowing that If Mr.
Janes should desire to wreak such sum
mary vengeance on Mr. Gurrett there
would be no law to prevent him.
