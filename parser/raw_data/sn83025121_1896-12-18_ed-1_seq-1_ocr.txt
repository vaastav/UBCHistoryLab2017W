Leaves Word That She is Out to
All Callers Will Visit
Washington.
SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., Dec. 10.
Among the passengers on the steamer
China, which arrived in this port this
morning was ex-Queen Lilluokalani of
the Hawaiian Islands. The arrival or
this illustrious personage created a
profound sensation among the visitors
to the wharf, and it was not long
before a large crowd gathered to see
the woman whose dethronement as a
monarch some years ago was the talk
of the civilized world.
The Queen did not travel in state or
with the retinue that usually follows
in the train of royalty. She had two
servants with her, a man and woman,
and these were all. During the voyage
she kept herself in seclusion as
much as possible, and few of the passengers
had an opportunity of seeing,
much less speaking to her.
On the arrival of the China the ex-Queen
sent a request to her former
Chamberlain, Col. Macfarlane, at the
California Hotel, notifying him that
his presence was desirable on the
steamer. He immediately responded,
and at 11 o'clock he escorted her off
the steamer and to that hotel. The ex-Queen
did not register and notified the
clerk to say that she was out to even"
visitor.
A Bulletin reporter was, however,
privileged to interview her briefly at
noon. She said she had little information
to "give to the public "I have decided
to take a trip through this country,"
she remarked pleasantly. "I may
go to London nerore i return to tne
Islands. I do not know how long I
, ,
The ex-Queen declined to state the
purpose ot ner journey nere. trom
some of the passengers it was learned
that she purposed to call upon President
Cleveland and see what can be
done towards restoring the monarchy
in the Islands. That the trip is one of
pleasure, merely, is generally discredited.
Col. Macfarlane, when questioned
relative to the movements of the
Queen, said:
"Her arrival was most unexpected.
Even her most intimate friends in Honolulu
were not aware that she contemplated
leaving the Islands until an
hour prior to the sailing of the steamer.
The news did not get abroad until
after the steamer China had sailed.
"She has not yet made me her confidant,
but from her conversation with
me I gather that she will remain in
San Francisco a week. She will cer
tainly visit "Washington and possibly
London. It is certain that her trip
is made in the interests of herself and
people. What that business may be I
do not know positively. It certainly
has nothing to do with the annexation
proposition which she naturally opposes.
In a few days, the Queen tells
me. she will mane a statement ot ner
plans to the public"
The Queen has changed in appear
ance rconsiderably. She is no longer
the fleshy woman she was. That the
loss of her crown has caused her
much mental anguish cannot be doubted.
After succeeding to the throne of
Hawaii, on the death of her brother
King Kalakaua. in 1S91, she reigned
for two years when the revolution
which wrested her crown from her,
iook place. Anont two years ago an
was made to re-establish her on
the throne, but the attempt failed
The Government thereupon
charged her with treason, and
she was confined under guard in the
palace, until six weeks ago, when she
was given freedom to go and come
as she pleased. She thereupon took
up her residence in a private dwelling,
there to ruminate upon her fallen
greatness.
Her trial before the military court
was a great political evenL It was at
this time that she made a statement
concerning herself and tie Hawaiians
that created a profound stir among her
faithful subjects. Her trial resulted
in a dismissal of the charges brought
against her.

Such, In brief, fs the infinitely welcome
news which will bring relief and
sense of restored self-respect to tho

announced jet; it may even be
discredited in certain quarters for a
few hours as premature. Nevertheless,
?m nrpnnrwl in TMfilrm If without
reservation. It was not until yester
day that the conclusion was reached.
Russia. France and Great Britain arrived
at a substantial agreement upon
the plan of action last week, but there
remained the necessity of getting the
consent of the other three powers
which were signatories to the Berlin
convention. Italy and Germany agreed
without much demur. Austria hesitated
long, and it was not until after
yesterday's emergency Cabinet council
In London, which discussed and approved
the whole plan, that the Austrian
Embassador notified Salisbury of
the rather unwilling consent of his Gov
ernment that the Russian, French and
British fleets shall force the Dardanelles,
it necessary, in the execution of
the new policy.
It is impossible at this moment to
furnish the exact details of the solution
of the Turkish problem w;hich
has been agreed upon. It may, however,
be partially defined in a negative
way. It provides nothing so radical
as a division of the Turkish empire.
Such a project has not been for a moment
considered. The integrity of Tur
key will be substantially maintained.
The terms of the new policy have prac
tically been dictated by Russia. It
came about finally that English and
other representations brought home to
the Czars Government a realization
of the fact that the policy of inaction,
for which it is chiefly responsible, in
the face of the accumulating horrors
of Turkish misrule, had become intolerable.
Even French influence has
been for some time strongly in favor
of some form of intervention. Russia
eventually yielded, in principle, but the
cussion of ways and means has oc
cupied nearly three months.

was held at the Chamber of
between E C. Potter and
A. Hj Butler, the promoters of the new
JSsWite au
new line from San Diego In conncc
tlon with the Santa Fe Railway system,
and saying that In connection
with the new Trans-Siberian Railway
and superior steamship connection In
the Orient, the trip around the world
would be shortened greatly and tho
time from East India to London made
three days shorter than the Suez route.
He proposed, he said, to organlzo n
company with a capital of $5,000,000
or $.000,000 to build steamships of
about 5,000 tons each, of 20-knot speed,
o ply between San Diego and
and perhaps Hong Kong via Honolulu.
Ho presented letters from

spoke, handling the subject
from the Japanese standpoint and setting
forth the benefits to be derived by
cloe connection with the far East.

Who Wouldn't Testify.

His Wake Supreme Court
I Decision.
1
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 30. By
its ljnanlmous decision, announced today
by Chief Justice Fuller, the Supreme
Court of the United States
affirmed the judgment of the
Court of Appeals of the District ot Columbia
in the case of Elverton B.
the stock broker who de- ot
clined to answer certain questions propounded
by the Senate Committee Investigating
the famous Sugar Trust
rumors in connection with the consideration
of the tariff bill in 1S94.
Tbe'effect of the decision is that Mr.
Chapman must surrender himself to
serve theMerm ot imprisonment of 30
days adjudged against him and pay a
fine of $100.
A collateral effect is that Messrs.
Haremeyer and Searles, of the Sugar
Trust, and Messrs. Edwards and
the newspaper correspondents, who
alai declined to answer the questions
will have to submit themselves for trial
in the District Courts upon indictments
similar to that in the Chapman case.
The history of the case is familiar,
having been frequently narrated in
these dispatches. Chapman was convicted
under Section 102, Revised Statutes,
which provides punishment for
failure to answer questions asked by
a pommittee of Congress, the Court
ovrruling all suggestions that the section
was unconstitutional. He sued out
a vrit of error to have the case re
viewed by the Supreme Court of the
United States, and the Government
mved to dismiss the writ on the
griund that the Supreme had no jurisdiction
to review the judgment of the
Dbtrict Courts in criminal cases.
MR. CIAIMAN"'3 CASE.
Mr-. BIrney Will Give Thno for Habeas
j Corpna Proceedings.
jiVASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 3.
Sreaking to a Star reporter this after-neon,
District Attorney Birney said
tliit he will give Mr. Elverton R.
Clapman, whose conviction as a contumacious
witness before the Senate
Sigar Trust Investigating Committee
the United States Supreme Court
Monday last, reasonable time
In which to apply for a writ of habeas
corpus. Mr. Birney stated that
w lile he has no personal knowledge in
the matter, he has been led to believe
that Mr. Chapman will surrender himself
in a few days, possibly tomorrow.
when he will apply to one of the Jus-tees
of the Supreme Court for the allowance
of the wriL
If Mr. Chapman does so in a reasonable
time, and the writ Is issued, Mr.
Birney will await the decision of the
Supreme Court before proceeding to try
the remaining indicted men, Messrs.
Macartney, Havemeyer, SearleB, Seymour,
Edwards and Shriver.
In the Chapman case, explained Mr.
Birney, the Supreme Court decided that
in all criminal cases tried in the District
of Columbia the Court of Appeals
is the court of last resort, and that, too,
whether a Federal (that is, constitutional)
question is or is not involved.
But, said Mr. Birney, it is claimed that
that decision does not preclude the
Supreme Court from considering such
a question on habeas corpus proceedings.
Hence, he expects Mr. Chapman
to test the constitutionality of the
statute under which he was convicted
by such proceedings.
Mr. Birney believes, however, that
tho Supremo Court will rofuso to Interfere
oven In hnbeas corpus proceedings,
nnd ho theroforo espocta to try
the remaining cases nt an enrly day.
Ho bellovcs that ho will secure convictions

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 6. Sen
ator Perkins arrived hero tonight and
is registered nt tho Shorehnm Hotel.
In an answer to a direct question ot
our correspondent, ho stated that ho
believed the wisest course for hla party
to pursue would bo to pass tho Ding-ley
bill at tho present session, nnd
thus bring in sufficient ravenuo to
meot tho expenditures of tho Government.
Ho does not favor any radical
tariff legislation, and thinks an extra
session should not be called It it can
possibly be avoided.
Senator Perkins Is opposed to the annexation
ot tho Hawaiian Islands. He
thinks that Louisiana, California nnd
Nebraska can produce all tho sugar
needed tor consumption in this country,
and that It would be a serious mistake
to have the product of these Islands
dumped Into the United States
free ot duty. He is, however, in favor
of the establishment of u protectorate,
and does not believe this country can
allow any foreign power to take possession
of the Hawaiian Islands.
All that Senator Perkins would say
In relation to the Pacific Railroad
Funding Bill is that he would pursue
the same course In regard to It that ho
had In the past oppose It to his ut

Mr. Cooper, the Hawaiian Minister of

stated that the visit had no special political
significance further than the de

if possible, for an audience with the
President for a similar purpose.
It is stated further that no reference
was made to the question of annexation,

CLEVELAND'S LAST
Delivers His Final tap to
Aierican Coiipsi
WOULD LET CUBA ALONE
Resolutions 'Promptly Offered
by Senators.
Mtnlstor Honry E. Cooper Dined In
Washington and Calls on
McKlntoy.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 7. President
Grover Cleveland's message was
presented to Congress this morning.
Perhaps the most Interesting portion
of the message is that relating to the
debts due the Government by the Pacific
bond-aided railroads. In plain
language tho President says it Is time
that proceedings were taken to collect
these debts, by foreclosure if necessary.
Former sentiments on questions relating
to tho tariff and currency are
repeated, and foreign relations are reviewed
at length. There Is just a
shadow ot warning to Turkey on the
subject ot Armenian outrages. These
significant words are used: "Tho present
somber prospect In Turkey will not
bo long permitted to offend the sight
ot Christendom."
The President says the Cuban Insurgents
have not yet proved their claim
to be recognized as belligerents, but
that the independence ot tho Island will
be the only final settlement of the warfare
that is now blighting the "Gem
of the Antilles,"
The message opens with congratulatory
remarks as to the outcome of
tho recent election, and the "peaceful
obedience and manly submission
which have,Bucceeded a heated clash of
political opinions."
Cuba Is given the greatest prominence.
The following extracts are
made:
"The Insurrection In Cuba still con
tinues with all Its perplexities. It is
difficult to perceive that any progress
has thus far been made toward the pa-
rciflcntloa ot the island or that? the
nation of affairs as depicted in my last
annual message has in tho least im
proved. If Spain still holds Havana
and the seaports, and all the considera
ble towns the insurgents still roam at
will over at least two-thirds of the island
country. It the determination of
Spain to put down the Insurrection
seems butHo strengthen with the lapse
of time and is evinced by her unhesitating
devotion of largely Increased
military and naval forces to the task,
there is much reason to believe that the
Insurgents have gained In point of
numbers and character and resources
and are none the less Inflexible In their
resolve noLJto succumb without practically
securing, the great object for
which they took up arms. If Spain
has not yet re-established her author
ity neither have the Insurgents yet
made good their title to be regarded
as an independent State. Indeed, as
the contest has gone on, the pretense
that civil government exists on the
island, except so far as Spain is able
to maintain it, has been practicallj
abandoned. Spain does keep on foot
such a Government, more or less Imperfectly,
in the large towns and their
immediate suburbs. But, that exception
being made, the entire country is
either given over to anarchy or is subject
to the military occupation of one
or the other party. It is reported, indeed,
on reliable authority, that at the
demand of the commander-in-chief of
the insurgent army the putative Cuban
Government has now given up all attempt
to exercise its functions, leaving
that Government confessedly (what
that is Is the best reason for supposing
it always to have been In fact), a Government
merely on paper.
"No other great power, it may safely
be said, under circumstances of similar
perplexity, would have manifested the
same restraint and the same patient
endurance. It may also be said that
this persistent attitude of the United
States toward Spain in connection with
Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight
respect and regard for Spain on the
part of the American people. They in
truth do not forget her connection
with the dlscoverj' of the Western
Hemisphere, nor do they underestimato
the great qualities of the Spanish peo
pie, nor fall to fully recognize their
splendid patriotism and their chivalrous
devotion to the national honor.
"When the Inability of Spain to deal
successfully with the insurgents has
become manifest and it Is demonstrated
that her sovereignty is extinct in
Cuba tor all purposes of its rightful
existence, and when a hopeless struggle
for Its re-establishment has degenerated
into a strife which means nothing
more than the useless sacrifice of
human life and the utter destruction
of the very subject matter of the conflict,
a situation will be presented in
which our obligations to the sovereignty
of Spain will be superseded by higher
obligations which we can hardly
hesitate to recognize and discharge
Deferring the choice of ways and methods
until the time for action arrives,
we should make them depend upon the
