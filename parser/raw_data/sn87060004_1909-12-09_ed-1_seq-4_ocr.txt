Iu this industry! ftro, now employ-

500,000,000 tops of coal.
Not only ia the nation Increasing

lu tonnge more than sixty-five per

The economic conditions upon
which coal mining H based m this

the evil eouuoquonoeo are so far
reaching as to both tiniH and oxtont,
and are so essentie&lly uatioual m

best statesmen, as well as our best

6. And tho penalty whiob the ua
...a..
tton is paying tor this bad system Is
tnis mcroaslng wasto or resources
and the still more nnpardonablo in
croasing waato of human lifo tho
yearly loss of 260,000,000 tons of
coal and tho killing or injury yearly
of from 8,000 to 10,000 men.
And what aro the remedies for
this bad situation?
A. Investigations, snob as are
now boing conducted by the govern
ment, as to tho cnuso of mine ex
plosions; and other similar investi
gations as to tho cause of rnino ac
cidents of other kinds, and as to
mothods of provention.
B. Educational work among tho
miners and tho lowor active mine
officials as to . tfcose causes and
remedies;
(J. The training of men at each
mine as to tho best methods of us
ing explosives, using electricity,
handling of gases and dust, of
timbering, of preventing and ex
tinguishing mine flreB; as to tho
methods of rescue work, aud as to
the methods of flrst-aid-to-tho-in-jused
work;
u. Tho development, of, better
and more uniform mining laws.rules
and regulations, based upon accur
ate data aud experience ;
E. Active, determined coopera
tion batweton tho miners and tho
luangemeuf in the Stito's in
spectors and' Iho enforcement of
these rules and regulations with a
view to tbo maintenance of the
earest possible conditions iu every
mine.
Tho above are all parts of tlio pro
gram for lessening and alleviating
inmo accidents; but they do not
complete tho program. It is an es
eontial part of this program that
F. Tho ruinous competitive system
upon which coal mining' in the
United Statos Is based at the pres
ent time should bo changed, aud
that the price paid for coal at tho
mine should bo auoh as will permit
and secure eafe.ancj efficient mining
mining unaccompanied by olther
this large loss of lifo or waste of re
sourcesmining which can have
duo regard to nqt,. only the safety
but also to tho health arid the com
fort of the men who toll under
ground and wboao labor.,! bo es
sential to tho welfare of fcfio, nation.
All this can bo done without adding
appreciably to the burdon of tho av
erage American citizen jwlthout any
incroaao lu ttie price of coal at the
poor man's cottage, and without the
nek of any unreasonable restraint of
trado.
There can be no permanent in
dustry without reasonable proIts.
It is unjust and irrational that iu
this great and Pbsontial branch of
industry, reasonable profits should
be dependent up n any unnecessary
sacrifice of human life, and uu
uocessary waste of rosourcos which
wo can neither replace nor restore
aud wlilch will be ossontial to tho

It Man heeu found from the records kept br our own department that
on the avorugo crop yields psr aore bare sliowu a duoldud tendency to in
crease during a period of forty years, and that thoro is no ovldenco ot
gouerat decrease over iargo areas, or in any particular stato, as Is popu

plo are farming inoro Intelllgontly and tlioroforo moro successfully, nnd

In liis further word upon tlio subject Secretury Wildon Bays that
sonio writers liavo held th it ovon if "tho yiolds aro increasing tho
element of daop;or is that the larger crops romovo feroat amouut8

and more iutenRivo mothods of cultivation thd soil In splto of its

that tho soils of" northern Europe aro now produciiiff' at least twice

Th Earoipoan lesson soems to be convincing and' final,, bo't'tho
caution of tho Secretary of Agriculture against a disregard of the

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
CONSERVATIVE.
Tho message of President Taft
went to Oonp;re'88 Tuesday. It is
conservative in tone and sub
mits a number of rocommcuda
tions of importance. Financial
and business interests will
probably bo most interested in
the fact that the general subject
of railroads and corporation reg
ulation is reserved for discussion
in a future message. Economy
is the key note of the atlmiuia
tration. Subject of trusts aud
railroad regulation to be discus
sed iu a special communication
later. Panama bond issue to
cover Government deficit. Ap
propriations cut to the quick.
Ship subsidies recommended.
Postal savings banks, restriction
of injunction power, and nation
al board of health favored.
Satisfactory foreign relations.
No tarUf war or inconsiderate
revision. Department reorgan
ization and reform advocated.
Tlie President says that there is
every reasou to believe that we
are on the eve of a su'iscautial
business expansion. The high
prices of coin modi ties', he de
clares, cannot be charged against
the existing protective tariff.
That's going some! The Sec
retary of Agriculture figures
that farm products for this year
are' worth SG,000,000 more
than for tho year 100S. The
value of these products has
nearly doubled iu ten years.
The value of the corn crop alouo
in tho farmer's hands for 19QU is
$1,720,000,000. The farmer is
doing, on the average, pretty
well, thak you, taking tho
couutry over. The Secretary
even has tho temerity to suggest
the farmer's share in these in
creasing values iu the following
words :
"There has been a teudoticy
of the animals and crops of
the farm to mcreaso in value
per unit at the farm at a
fastor rate than all commodi
ties have increased at whole
sale." Awerican coal to Argeulino!
Tho first cargo has been shipped
by the bteamer London .Bridge.
All Americathat hoars of the
event through some daily, or
oven weekly, uewspaper is
wishing bun voyage and many of
them to this aud all other coal
carrymg oraft bound for this big
agricultural region to tho South.
Gov. Uughos is pondering over
tho necessity of a "law of tho
air" for the control of ajr ma
chines. Now if some great aud
inliueutial man would ponder
upon legislation for the regula
tion ofvjiot air inachinea and
