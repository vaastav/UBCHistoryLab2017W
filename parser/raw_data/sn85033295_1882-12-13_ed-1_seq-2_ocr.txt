ENGLISH TRADE TRICKS.
In the volume of consular reports is
sued by the state department, attention
is called by our consul at Smyrna, Mr.
Duncan, to the imitations of American
cotton goods which are now being placed
on the markets of that part of the world
by English firms. The result is to in
jure our trade and manufactures. Mr.
Duncan writes: “These dishonest imi
tations, I am informed by the principal
importers of the real American domes
tics, are continually doing us a great
deal of harm by cheating the public,
and yet the brand is probably sufficient
ly changed to avoid prosecution.” In
the same volume of reports there is a
communication from Mr. Denny, our
consul general at Shanghai, on this
identical subject. He writes: “A re
cent novelty has been the import of a
drilling from England, packed in the
same manner as those coming from the
United States, wTiich has met a ready
sales at prices nearly equivalent to those
paid for the best American brands.” We
suppose there is no way of stopping
this business so far as either
govemmeht is concerned. We have
laws because there are rogues, says the
New r York Herald; but in these modern
days the rogues are so ingenious that they
manage to slip through the finest meshes
that have been prepared to catch them.
The best and most effective way to teach
them, perhaps, is to throw the light of
intelligent public opinion on their ne
farious operations.
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN JAPAN.
The seventh annual report of the Jap
anese minister of education states that
there are 28,025 common schools in
Japan, of which 16,710 are public and
the remainder private; there being an
increase of 1,316 and 125 respectively,
as compared with the previous year.
The number of high schools is 107 pub
lic and 677 private, there being an in
crease of 42 and 63 respectively. Be
sides the above many kindergarten and
primary schools were established.
These private schools, even now, play a
most important part in Japanese na
tional life and education. Mfiny of
them have hundreds of students at
tracted by the fame of a single teacher.
Youths flock from all parts of the coun
try to sit at the feet of a renowned
scholar, as men did in Europe to hear
Abelard. The most celebrated of these
leaders of youth—for this they are,
rather than simple schoolmasters in our
sense of the word—is Mr. Fukusawa, of
Tokio, whose translations from Euro
pean books and original works on the
political and social questions of the day
are read far and wide in Japan. Nature
says that the students of this gentlemen
fill many of the most important offices in
the state; some of them recently formed
themselves into a patriotic society, and
established a newspaper, in which the :
acts of the government are subject to
much caustic criticism. Long after the
ordinary educational work of their
teacher is done, and the young men have
gone out into the world to do for them
selves, they continue to reside near him,
to study under his direction, and to form
classes in which important public ques
tions can be freely discussed under his
guidance. One of his classes translated
the whole of Adam Smith’s “ Wealth of
Nations” into Japanese, with annota
tions, and many other important Euro
pean works, especially those on philoso
phy and politics.
THE COUNTERFEITING INDUSTRY.
It appears by the report of the chief
of the secret service division of the
treasury department that while the
counterfeiting of greenbacks and bank
bills has decreased, there is an increase
in the amount of fraudulent coin set
Afloat. Professional counterfeiters have
acquired a skill in the manufacture of
dies, the mixture of metals and of plat
ing which insures them greater success
in uttering hard money than soft. There
was not a single new counterfeit note
issued during the past year, which is
the first time this has been the case
since the National paper currency was
introduced. Nevertheless, no less than
§8,830,124.56 of counterfeit paper money
was discovered and confiscated during
the year, and also 184 counterfeit plates,
dies and molds.
Counterfeiting of all kinds is one of
the illicit industries which has greatly
declined since the period when it flour
ished in most vigor. Several years
ago the Bank of England made a report
to parliament which showed that the
counterfeiting of the notes of that insti
tution was most common during the
early years of this century, since which
time it has steadily declined. From
1806 to 1874 there were no less than
267,525 counterfeit notes presented at
its counter. During the years from' 1811
to 1820, the presentations averaged 20,-
015 a year, and the average face value
was $126,991. Between 1821 and 1830
the yearly average was 3,213 in number
and $24,087 in amount, while from 1871
to 1874 there were no more than 75 a
year, and the nominal value was only
$2,472. In 1874 congress passed a law
under the operations of which two thirds
of all the ourstanding National Bank
bills passed through the hands of the
treasurer of the United States before the
issue of his annual report for 1875, the
object being the detection and destruc
tion of counterfeits. Out of the immense
| number of notes thus handled, but 520
I counterfeits were found, the lowest de
| nominations being the ones most fre
i queutly imitated.
Different methods have been adopted
in this country and England to baffle
counterfeiters. Here the aim has been
to put such a large quantity of tine work
on the engraved plates that perfect imi
tation would be impossible, while the
Bank of England trusts mostly to the
skill of its paper-maker, and the engrav
ing of its notes is comparatively rude
and coarse. It has been complained
against the American notes that the
quantity of engraved work is so great as
to conceal the fibre of the paper, and
propositions have been made to simplify
the plates, and pay more attention to
the manufacture of the paper, but the
comptroller of the currency has always
been adverse to such a change. It has
sometimes been necessary to call in and
destroy all the notes of certain banks of
denominations that had been successful
ly imitated by counterfeiters.
FLAX CULTURE.
The annual report of the Belfast (Ire
land) Flax Association show’s that the
cultivation of flax’ is in a languishing
condition not in Ireland alone, but in
other European countries also. In 1881
there was a decrease of 6.64 per cent,
from the area of the previous year, and
this was followed by a decrease of 23
per cent, in the flax acreage for the
present year. The area under flax in
1870 was 191,803 acres, and 157,534
acres in 1880. The number of scutch
mills has declined from 1,542 in 1860 to
1,150 in 1882. In England, too, the
acreage in flax last year fell off 27.3 per
cent, as compared with figures in 1880,
the area being 6,634 acres. In Austria
the tlax acreage last year was 224,244,
a slight increase over 1880, but less than
in any year during the previous decade.
The area in Hungary was 29,089 acres,
an increase over the two preceding
years, but considerably less than the
average for 1870-72. France had 169,-
430 acres under tlax in 1831, an increase
over the two previous years, but a {
marked falling off from the area during
the years from 1871 to 1878. In Ger
many, where more tlax is grown than in
any other European country except Rus
sia, the area under tlax in 1880 was 319,-
396 acres, a decrease of 10,000 acres as
against 1878. Holland had 48,095 acres
in 1880, an increase over the three pre
ceding years, but a decline as compared
with the average from 1870 to 1876.
The latest accessible figures are here
given, but it is thought that there was a
decline in the acreage of fiax in all these
countries during the present year. In
Russia the flax area is estimated at
2,000,000 acres, or much more than half
the w hole flax area of Europe—amount
ing to 3,342,018 acres. The area in fiax
in this country in 1879, the latest figures
at hand, was estimated by the depart
ment of agriculture to be not less than
400,000 acres.

Russia and Germany.
Alexander 111. may profess boundless
affection for tlie Emperor William, both
as a relative and as his father’s friend.
But those who surround Alexander 111.,
those who really control the destinies of
Russia, have as deep a hatred, both for
the Germans and their king. They hate
the Germans, whom Count Neselrode in
troduced to Nicholas’ court; who for a
quarter of a century held every political
post qf honor; who became the Mame
lukes of the Russian empire. They hate
Prince Bismarck, who made them dis
gorge their plunder of their war with
Turkey. They hah; the Austrians, who
stopped them on their road to the Bos
phorus and the Dardanelles, who are their
only competitors in the race for Con
stantinople. Russian hatred ot Austria
was the bond between Gortshakoff and
the national party. Russian hatred of
Austria is seen to-day in every state
along the line of the Balkans. In Bul
garia it has nearly overthrown a prince;
in Servia it has almost assassinated a
king.
Earth has nothing softer than a
woman’s heart, unless, perhaps, it be a
tomato in the prime of life. —Lowell

ICeporl of (lie Tariff Commission.

and crude chemi als on the free list; a specific
duty of 50 cents a ton on iron ore and of $3
per thousand on cigars; a reduction of 2%
cents per pound on medium wool, of 2 cents

New York’s Sunday Lan%
The Sabbatarian provisions of the New York
code were enforced on the 3d iu the com
mercial metropolis for the first time. Barbers,
ice-cream dealers, expressmen and grocers were
compelled to desist from business. Tbe trains
ran as usual, and the Sunday newspapers were
sold by boys on the streets, although the boot
blacks were forbidden to ply their vocation.
The saloons, however, were not interfered with
except in a few cases. Numerous arrests were
made, but iu nearly all cases the parties were
allowed to go on their own recognizances. By
the provisions of the new penal code “Sabbath
breaking ” is made a rather comprehensive
crime. Not only is “ all manner of servile
labor, excepting in works of necessity or
charity,” prohibited, but also “all shooting,
huntiug, fishing, playing, horse racing, gaming
or other public sports, exercises or pastimes;
all trades, manufactures and mechanical em
ployments; all manner of public selling, or of
fering or exposing for sale publicly of any
commodities except that meats, milk
and fish may be sold at any time
before nine o’clock in the morning,
and txcept that food may be sold to be eaten
upon the premises where sold, and drugs, medi
cines and surgical appliances may be sold at
any time of the day.” The punishment for
Sabbath-breaking is" a fine of 85 or imprison
ment nor exceeding five days. In addition, all
commodities exposed for sale in violation of
the code shall be forfeited. Tbe goods will be
sold on one day’s notice and the proceeds paid
to the overseers of the poor of the town or
city. The disturbing of religious meetings at
any time or upon any day is a misdemeanor.
The following acts will coustitute such a dis
turbance; Uttering profane discourses or
making any disturbing or unnecessary noises
near enough to disturb the solemnity of the
meeting; “engaging in or piomoting within
two miles of the place where a religious meet
ing is held, any racing of animals or gaming of
any description; obstructing in any manner
without authority of law, within tile like dis
tance, free passage along a highway to the
place of such meeting.” Processions and
parades on Sunday, excepting at funerals, are
forbidden, and even at a military funeral there

election of 1882. Kasson presented the views
of the minority of the committee on ways and
means on the Internal Revenue Bill, signed by
himself Duunell, McKinley, Haskell, Moirison
and Russell. They say they are not prepaied
to recommend the entire abolition of ihe tax
nor run the risk of reducing the revenue of
the government below the amount which will
evidently be required to meet arrearages of
pensions in addition to other current expenses
of the government by extravagant reduction
of either source of public revenue. “It is a
much more agreeable duty and much more
feasible to reduce taxes from time to time a*
the unknown extent of our revenues shall be
developed than to re-impose them to mee the
imperative obligations of the government.
For the reduction which it now appears safe to
make, we believe it should be effected rather
by the abolition of taxes more closely related
to the use and convenience of our" people.”
Messrs. Dunnell and Haskell tiled a supple
mental and minority report, in which they fa
vor the abolition of all internal revenue taxes,
except those on malt and spirituous liquors,
tobacco, snuff and cigars. If it becomes ap
parent that the government does not require
the entire amount derived from liquors and
tobacco, a proposition reducing the tax may be
favorably considered. They believe, however,
before this tax is abolished, there should be as
comprehensive a revision of the tariff made as
as the length of the session will permit. That
revision should be made entirely independent
of other sources of revenue, and there should
be such an adjustment of duties levied as will
fairly protect American industries from ruin
ous foreign competition Adjourned.

A Christmas Plum Pudding.
[From Food and Health.}
To be wholesome a plum pudding must
be well combined, well mixed, well
cooked, served up hot, and eaten before
the appetite is flagging. A good plurc
pudding is not indigestible, nourishing,
strengthening, and above all, comfort
ing, it puts people in a good temper and
makes them feel happy, Do not make
it too rich, nor too heavy, nor too sweet,
nor too large, but be moderate in every
thing, forgetting nothing, and mixing it
with your own hands. Onlv that plum
pudding is lucky, that is stirred by each
member of the household. Take I
pound best raisins, well stoned; 1 pound
currants; \ pound saltanas; £ pound of
finely chopped candied peel; 1 pound of
best moist sugar; the rind of one lemon
grated; mixed spice according to judg
ment; 1 ounce of powdered sweet al
monds, grated nutmeg and ground cin
namon; a pinch of salt and a pinch of
ground pepper; prepare best white stale
bread crumbs and rub it even, to your
judgment in quantity, then add three
tablespoons of fine sifted flour; chop as
fine as possible | of a pound of best beef
suet; add to bread aud flour; also two
good pinches of baking powder, mix
well. Pour two tablespoons of best
golden syrup over this mixture. Beat
up the yolks of six eggs well; the whites
of three with ■white sugar, mix them with
the padding materials. Stir for ten
minutes, till all is amalgamated. Add
two glasses of sherry if desired, mix suf
ficient to bring to a good moisture, but
not sloppy. Butter a mould well; pour
in pudding and place in steamer or in
saucepan, so that the water reaches hall
the height and by no means immerse it,
cover the pudding -with clean paper and
let steam six hours at least. Sauce.—

witli half a spoon of best fine flour, mix
well. Add sugar and vanilla flavoring
and as much milk or cream as desired.

wished.
Avoid All This.
(From the New England Journal of Education.]
In promulgating your esoteric cogita
tions, or articulating your superficial
sentimentalities and amicable, philosoph
ical or psychological observations, be
ware of platitudinous ponderosity. Let
your conversational communications
possess a clarified conciseness, a com
pacted compreheneibleness, coalescent
consistency, and a concatenated cogency.
Eschew all conglomerations of fiatuient
garrulity, jojune babblement and as
sinine affections. Let your extempor
aneous decantings and unpremeditated
expatiations have intelligibility and vora
cious vivacity, without rhodomontade or
thrasonical bombast. Sedulously avoid
all polysyllabic profundity, pompous
prolixity/psittaceous vacuity, ventril
oquial verbosity and vaniloquent vapid
ity. Shun double ententes, prurient
jocosity and pestiferous profanity, ob
scurant or apparent. In other words,
talk plainly, briefly, naturally, sensibly,
truthfully, purely. Keep from “slang;”
don’t put on airs; say what you mean;
mean what you say. And don’t use big
words!
Disappearing Heroes.
I From the Atlanta Constitution.]
“ Have you noticed,” said Gen. Hoke,
of North Carolina, the other day, “the
rapid disappearance of one-armed and
one-legged men? At the close of the war
in the south—as almost every southerner
was in the army— men without an arm
or without a leg were to be seen every
where and on all occasions. In a few
more years it will be a rare thing to see
one. Yon will appreciate this still more
if you notice the next assemblage of sol
diers at at a reunion or in procession on
some occasion. It is pitiful to see how
old and grizzled they look. The young
est of them are middle-aged men. Why,
the day I surrendered 1 could place my
hand on my saddle-horn and vault over
my horse’s back. Now about all I care to
do is to climb up one side of him.’
A young widow in Brooklyn received
SIB,O 10 insurance on her husband’s life
and handed it over to a lawyer to invest.
He built him a house with it, and is so
mean he won’t even let the widow in # to
see how it looks.
