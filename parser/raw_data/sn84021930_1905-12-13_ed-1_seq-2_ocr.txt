PUBLISHED EVERY WEDNESDAY
So many rich strikes of gold bearing
ore are being made that the old Tread
well almost sinks into insignificance.
Representative Sulzer has introduced
the same Alaska territorial bill which
he has introduced in each congress for
the last four years.
Captain Amudsen, the Norwegian
who visited the North Pole and walked
back by way of Alaska, reports that
the whalers are safe for the winter.
The Ketchikan Journal reports that
the Hadley Consolidated Copper Com
pany has paid its first dividend of a :
cent a share on a half-million shares of
stock.
A local agent for the Canadion Pa-!
ciflc Company has been appointed at
Juneau, and we are informed that the
boats of this company will make that
town a regular port of call.
There is a feeling of indignation
among the business men because of
the recent raise of freight rates, by the
steamship companies. The terms of
the new contracts make it impossible |
for the small shipper to get any share
of the discount allowed, and the form
er 20 per cent is withdrawn entirely, j
It may seem all right to the steamship .
companies, but to the business man,:
whose profits are reduced thereby, it J
looks like robbery. In the develop
ment of a new country cheap transpor- i
tation is the first essential, but in that <
? respect Southeast Alaska seems to be I
going backward. Every dollar added
to the C09t of merchandise must ulti
mately be paid by the consumer.

TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT
Congressman William Sulzer of New
York has introduced a bill in congress
providing for the organization of the
IHstricfc of Alaska into a territory. |
Under the provisions of the bill, full
territorial power is to be vested in the ;
governor, who is to be appointed by
the president. A territorial legislature
consisting of an upper house of seven
members and lower house of twenty
members is provided for, also delegates
to congress, a continuation of the pres
ent three judicial districts, and for the
establishment of territorial courts.
Congressman Sulzer wants editorial;
endorsement of the bill by Alaska
newspapers.
THE Sl'LZER BILL
The bill of Congressman William
Sulzer, providing for territori al gov- j
eminent for Alaska will receive the
haarty endorsement of not only the
press of Alaska, but her people as well.;
This is especially true of those of our
people who were born and raised in the
States and have tasted the rights of
citizenship and who know what it is to
be a part of the commonwealth ruled
by her people.
Congressman Snlzer is entitled to
the gratitude of Alaska, for his efforts
m her behalf. He has always taken [a
fair view of our condition, and has
been persistent in his endeavors to
give us relief. We hope for his sue

THE CEMETERY
The Committee injcharge of the Doug
las Cemetery has appointed W. C.
Boyd to the position of clerk and grave !
digger. The duties of clerk he has
performed carefully and well for
years. His appointment a9 grave dig
ger, was necessary for several reasons.
Those who have been digging the
graves, have in many cases failed to
observe the plan of the' streets and
alleys as marked out by the committee.
It is very necessary that these require
I ments be observed, because if it is not
done it will bo impossible to ever
make the cemetery beautiful.
The Committee, recognizing in Mr.
Boyd a man who would give the mat
ter the careful attention it deserves,
askod him to take the position and he
has accepted.
1 No bettor choico could have been
made. Mr. Boyd has showu not only
his iuterest, but his ability, iu the past
; by his works. Wo are glad to know
i that the care of our cemetery will be iu
| such competent hands.

ALASKA GETS LITTLE
The president, in his annual message
to congress, renews his former recom
mendation of a delegate iu congress to
represent Alaska. He recommends
that such a delegate be chosen by pop
ular election; but he adds, if con
gress will not consent to this, that,
at least, there be accorded an appoint
ive delegate.
There is reason for disappointment
that tho president is not more emphatic
in his recommendations as to Alaska.
It was hoped that a president of the
sturdy democratic Americanism of
President Roosevelt would recoguize
and condemn in an outspoken way
conditions under which 60,000 white
American citizens of the finest type are
deprived of every vestige of self-gov
ernment; and that he would have re
commended the immediate estsblish
ment iu Alaska at least of such terri
torial governments as were granted to
small isolated groups of pioneer back
woodsmen seventy-five and eighty years j
ago iu what are now Eastern states.
An appointive delegate to congress,!
as a substitute for the full local self-!
government to which this commuuity |
of American citizens is entitled, is |
hardly the recommeudation expected, i
