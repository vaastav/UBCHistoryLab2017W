Htnted that tho winter cro whh ilohiK well.
AiiFmonthiK thlM bullish iirKUinent camo a
nisfi to k1 out of the market, both by jiro
fesnlonalH who held Ioiik lino which they
had aciildrod at a low llBiiro and by many
or tho smaller fry who wanted Uj ciult at a
loss. Tim result was a terrible slump nt
tho opening. May opened JnKgeilly '.("Ac

xrnh ii rumor nlloat that i crowd of cap
Itallsts nt Koiilsvllle was trylnK to corner
wheat anil that this liuyltiK was for them.
With a whoop prices stnrled up iirhIii,
reni hlnc M'iC, only to sa iiunln to Mc.
The tone of the market at this Juncture
vhh tense and strained, but It boosted
prices aaln to,M',c. This time the Hood
of selling ordors and the iiiiniitlty of long
wheat that poured Into the market was
nppallhiK n nil the weakening slump came.
Slav sold down In ipilek Jumps. No onu
seemed to want the cereal and after touch
ing the low price of MHe May closed weak,

1iiish"lH, compared with wn,(jflr last year.
Tho Increase In tho world's visible Hllpply
was XiiCW bushels. .Seaboard clearances
In wheat and Hour wero fill.two bushels.
The seahoard repotted S loads taken for ex
port. Corn was only moderately active and
heavy all session. It had to lean up against
wheat again for support, and tills prop
tailed It siivernl times. There Is a marked
showing of Increases In primary hands and
the open weather has made this it decidedly
bearish factor. Tho cash demand, both for
the east and fonlhwest, picked up ma
terially nml fairly large quantities wero
taken at current prices. Ah In tho wheat
pit tho opening was marked with heavy
selling by professionals and brokers. 1'rlces
broke Irregularly at the start, with May
all tho way trom He to le down at Rfco to
fiic, In lino with the wheat decline nnd
tho lower cabin list. On the soft spots
shorts covered their lines freely find better
prices wero tho result. May early sold up
well nnd when the rctictlon-cninn In wheat
It touched ftic. This showed n weak con
dition, with May l'p down at GV.e. He
eclpts wero 23." cars.
Oats acted In sympathy with wheat mid
corn, breaking early, recovering later and
closing weak. The cash demand has fallen
off materially during the speculation of tho
Inst week nnd stocks show largo Increases.
Tho selling at the start, both for profit
find by shorts, brought May c to Hie
lower at tSlio to 4.Vic On the recovery It
touched Its best price nt Ifiijc. The close
was weak, "io down at IGlic. Hccolpts

The opening In provisions was easier nnd
In sympathy with tho grain weakness, but
beforo noon everything was nbovo yester
ilav's prices. The leading Influcnco was
commission hnuso, buying. The close wan
somewhat easy. January pork closed 1ft;

NEW YORK, Dec. 10. -The recent course
of Amalgamated Copper threw th" ma I ket
Into renewed confusion. After rising to
"2"4 there wns open selling by the brokers,
whoso buying had been a strong Influcnco
in yesterday s rally In tho stock, ns they
are credited with usually acting Tor Inside
interests In Amalgamated Copper. Tho
consequence as that that stock com
menced to sag again In nn Inegulnr way
until It had dropped down to VS. Tho
price then worked Its way upward, with
iiceasloiinl reactions to a high level of
74a.. reiirosentliiir n recovery of over 10
points trom Saturday's low level for th"
siock. i no general level ni prices was
affected by all of these fluctuations, but
only to a moderate extent, tho effect being
more to discourage operations whether
for tho long or short account. There wero
some Individual points of strength, notably
In the Vanderbllts, with large ileum ml for
New York Central nnd a number of less
prominent railroads and industrials. In
cluded In the latter class cro Ueneral
Electric, American Smelting, American
Citr, Hocking Coal, People's Cas, Consol
idated lias and International Paper pre
ferred. Tho tone of tho money market
was much quieter during tho day nnd
there seemed a siilllclent supply nt fIi?
per cent, but lato In the day belated bor
rowers claused a flurry to S per cent by
their urgent efforts to cover their wnnts,
and the stock market mado an Immedlato
response. Iho whole list dropping s-jildonly
to the lowest of tho day on greatly In
creased dealings, Amalgamated Copper
fell back to (5!'H and closed with a net loss
of about ii point, St. Paul nnd Manhattan
fell rapidly, tho former declining 2.
There was no effectual rally In tho market
nnd tho closing wns hcav, at about tho
lowest. Tho sterling exrhange market
continued depressed and there Is not much
likelihood ot gold exports while money
rates hold stiff, A deposit nt tho sub
treasury of $5o,fli) for transfer to New Or
leans shows the Interior pressure for
funds. Tho heavy prollt-taklng of the day
In tho grain and cotton market gave Jiopo
of somo money mnrkct relief by liquida
tion on that quarter. The heavy with
drawals from tho money market by the
government on account of tho surplus
gives cause for uneasiness and there was
general expectation during tho day that
tho secretury of the treasury would an
nounce tho ImmedlHto payment ot tho gov
ornnunt's Jnuuary Interest as a measure
of relief. Tho announcement of notion in
this matter camo too late to help the mar
ket today.
Tho railroad bonds were qulto dlvcrslllcd,
but tho price movement wns Irregular.
Total sales, par value, $I,I10,0"0. United
States bonds wero all unchanged on tho
last call.
Tho Commercial Advertiser's London
financial cablegram says. A hotter fooling
dominated tho stock markot today on tho
toport ot Kitchener's progress In putting
down tho Hocr war and on New York
rumors of a settlement of tho copper light.
American stocks opened llrm, but slid back
in tho absence of support. Then New York
supported tho market, hut It remained list
less, Rio tlntos moved within narrow
limits, at ono time reaching 42HC, but clos
ing unchanged for Iho day at llTdc Copper
was steady at 55 tho ton. Rio tlntos otll
clals refuse to talk about tho reduction of
output. Gold to tho amount of X20,0n0 has
gono out to Malta. Ono million pounds In
stallment Is duo tomorrow. Now Zealand
loan bills nro llrm at 3 7-16. Paris exchange,
is 23.13; Herlln, 20.12.

CATTLE There was n big run of catllo
here today and very few of them wore
range cattle. A liberal proportion of iho
offering consisted of cornted steers, and a
niimbrr of cholco bunches were on wnle.
Reports from other points were none too
favorable, nnd ns a result trade at this
point was a llttlo uneven.
A ten Hire of the market on cornfed steers
this morning was the fact that the shortfed
cattle sold fully as readily ns did the
choicer grades. It was also noticeable that
tho market was uneven. In somo cafes
sales worn made that wero fully steady
with yesterday, while In other instances
.there was no mlstaklnt; tho tact that the
mnrKci was a uunue lower. 11 couiii luu
bo said that the market wits very active, us
buyers wero inclined to hold oft and buy
their supplies lower. If possible, '
The cow market, however, was active null
fully steady. Offerings wore not very heavy
and as all the pacKers wanieit supplies 11
was not long beforo most everything was
out of first hands. The demnnd wns gen
eral, canncrs and medium grades being
ready seller, tho same as the better
grades.
Hulls, .calves nnd stngs also sold without
trouble at good stendy prices.
Blockers und feeders were not plentiful
this morning, and ns tho demand was good
for tho choicer grades, cattle answering to
that description were soon disposed ot nt
steady prices. There seemM to be an outlet
for all tho good cattle that are coming, but
the common kinds of all weights are a drug
on the market. Representative sales:

HOGS The receipts of hogs continued
liberal today, but tho demnnd for heavy
weights was In good shape, and as n re
sult the piarket opened a shade stronger
on hogs showing both weight nnd quality.
Ihey sold mostly from $6.13 to $6.30. Ship
pers ns well as local packers were llberat
buyers, so It was not long before the bulk
of that class of hogs was disposed of Tho
lightweights, however, did not sell at all on
the first part of Iho market, as buyers
would not even look nt them.
When they did finally statt In on tho
lightweights Ihey bought them mostlv
weak to 5c lowc than yesterday. Tho hulk
or them wont from $5.93 to $6.10, Butcher
weights sold largely from J0.IO to $6.13.
Tho close of the market wns slow, as It
was the light hogs that were left. Repte-
