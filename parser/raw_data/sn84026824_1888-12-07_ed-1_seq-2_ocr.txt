FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1888.
Thkkk's a strengthening of Demo
cratic backbone all along the line.
Satan rebuking sin in a mild specta
cle compared with the Wheeling In
telligtnctr shrieking fraud.
Now for one-cent postage. The
government is perfectly able to make
the reduction, so let's have it.
LAST year it is said that forty-seven
and a-half million dollars were coined.
We find it mighty hard to believe
this.
Thk majority against theProhibition
Amendment in this State is something
over **>.000. No one has asked fur n
recount.
It was bad enough to be licked as
badly as the Democrats were at the
last election, without being lied upon
in the bargain.
If some of the fire-eaters of the
North could have their way, the peo
ple of the South would not be allowed
to stay on th^ earth.
This is a law-abiding community,
but outraged justice would make it
unpleasant for the vile slanderer of
its fair fame if he were known.
Thk President's message shows he
has not cha jged his opinions a> to
the tariJ. Ever.. D luo i a' > .?>uld
stand just a i.rn.iy * n ? hi*grva n
tion as tne i're.-id, ui does.
Thk Senate had uo sooner convened
on Monday than the pious Senator
Chandler was on foot with hi> resolu.
tiou about election outrages in the
South. Uo soak your head, Hill.
We are sorry to .-ay that the news
paper liar whose operations have
heretofore been confined to the wes
tern part of the State has invaded
this section with vigor undiminished.
As the Irishman would say. we be
lieve that nine-tenths of the lies told
about election frauds in the South are
untrue. The lies in regard to Shep
herdstown, we suppose, are a fair
sample of the stuff published in the
northern newspapers.
Govkrnor-elkct Hovky, of Indi
ana. a few days ago said that he "had
spent a considerable sum of money to
influence votes, but not a cent to buy
one." This is a pretty fine distinction,
but we suppose to an elastic conscience
like Gov. Hovey's it is all that is nec
essary.
Thk New York Mail awl Expreu
threatens to invade the South with an
armed host and till the people full of
lead and steel if the Democrats don't
behave themselves and let the Repub
licans have everything. We don't
reckon that blood-thirsty editor will fill
many persons with lead? his most
dangerous shooting will be with his
mouth.
In an interview at Washington a
few days ago General Goff said: "We
did not use much money, but our or- j
ganization was superb and that is
what tells in a campaign." This is
truly refreshing, isn't it? "Did not
use much money" is good. With char
acteristic modesty the General claimed
everything, almost, in the State for
the Republicans.
Ik the Republicans have elected
their candidate for Governor we hope
he will be seated. Hut if Mr. Flem
ing has honestly received a majority
of the vote cast, we want the Demo
crats to stick to hiiu and back him up
in his determination to fill the guber
natorial chair. Gen. Goff's game
of bluff must not be allowed to influ
ence the result.
Thkkk art* a few rats left i.i i
theeoun:r- aft? :? all A table pub- J
lished iii Phiiadrl; : ia 1 ">tes ul
Monday shows i ? . a r Cleveland re- j
ceived 80,000 more votes than Harrison |
in the recent election. The peculiar (
workings of the electoral coll?',:'\ I
however, deprives him of tne benefit
of this majority, and -Vr. 1 larri^vjii
gets more electoral votes tban he.
OXB of the things needed by West '
Virginia? and needed badly? is a reg
istration law. Now tna' fraudulent

Certainly ail fair-minded men will de
sire every provision looking to honest
elections, and the measure should be
supported by both parties. We hope
the Legislature will take immediate
steps to this end.
A DISPATCH from Charleston, this
State, on Wednesday, contained the
following good news: "The recount in
this county was completed last night.
The recount shows that Alderson,
Democrat, for Congress, from the
third district, gained 25 in the city,
which elects him by 17. Fleming.
Democrat, for Governor, gained 26
votes. This will, it is believed, give
the Democrats the Governor also.**
This would seem tosettle the fact that
we will have three Democratic Con.
gressmen, with the chances very good
for having a Democratic Governor.
We hope it may be so.
Hon. Wm. L. Wilson, who has been
re-elected to Congress from this dis
trict by an increased majority, des
pite the fact that his district was
flooded with Republican money to ac
complish his defeat, has written a
letter to a friend in Warren county,
Va., in response to congratulations
over his victory. In view of the ef
forts made from the outside to defeat
him Mr. Wilson says his election "is
a signal proof of the incorruptible
zeal of the Democrats of the second
district." In regard to the result of
the national contest Mr. Wilson says:
"I deplore the defeat of Cleveland
withincreasingdistress. To be struck
down as he was in the midst of a most
successful and patriotic administra
tion, and at a time of general business
prosperity, because he championed
the cause of the people, shows the
power of the monopolies, and the
spirit of centralized wealth in a form
too unmistakable for comfortable re
flection."
AN ATROCIOUS LIE.
The following article appeared in
the Philadelphia Fret* of Friday last :
SHKi'HKRPSTOWN. W. Va., Nov 29 ?
This is one of the places in West Vir
ginia where it wasdangerous for a Re
publican to vote. The town and coun
ty are entirely under the control of
the Democrats. Before the election
they made threats that they would al
low no negroes to vote unless they
voted the Democratic ticket, or at least
for Free-trader William L. Wilson, for
Congress. On election day James Rob
bins [Robinson], who had a little more
courage than other members of his
rare, went to the polls and said he
would vote despite their protests. One
of the Democrats caught him by the
back of the neck and jerked him away.
He was driven from the place mid col
ored men generally made themselves
scarce after that. A number of heel
ers from Baltimore and Washington
were brought up on the train and af
ter voting stood around and solicited
votes from the residents of the town.
Ttioiuas R. Hay [John R. Ray], one of
the oldest Republicans in Jefterson
j County, watched these people voting.
During the day he took the names of
twentv-five men whom he knew to be
residents of Baltimore and Washing
ton. The friends of Free-trader Wil
son threw thousands of dollars into
the district and Sliepherdstown got
considerable of this.
The night before election twenty
men were picked up on the streets bv
the Deinot rats. iak- 11 to the otlice of a
prominent gentleman and kept drunk
until after ti e polls closed on election
day. Fiveof these men have since de
I dared their willingness to make an af
tida\it to the effect that they were
locked in the room until it was too
late to vote. A hand of mountaineers
I who rinle up to Harper's Ferry voting
district came here also and in the
same manner put in their votes. They

Democrat- it .d 4 Republicans, this
j district t.a thirty colored men, yet
| only four Republican ballots were
i cast.
At the Shepherdstown voting place
! before tiie polls closed some of the
| ballot-boxes were removed to the of
fice of Jos. Bragonier. a Democratic
lawyer, and the contents counted
there. When the polls closed the rest
of the ballots were taken over and
counted. James D. Fay man, one of
i the clerks of the board, in speaking of
j the matter, said: "The board left
! about twenty ballots in the box. so
j that if there were too many ballots
I they could easily dispose of them.
When we finished counting there were
five ballots more than there were vot
ers. and five Republican votes were
thrown out."
Mr. Fayman. John R. Ray and J. S.
Fleming have made affidavit to the
fact that the ballot-boxes were re
moved.
United States Senator Faulkner lives
at Martinsburg. Berkeley County.
The night before the election he had
j a number of colored ami white Repub
licans from the city taken out to a
1 house in the country, where a dance
i was given them. They were kept
j there until the next morning and liq
uors of all kinds tlowed freely. Asa
result there were a number of Repub
lican votes missing the next day. This
ruse did not. however, prevent Mr.
Faulkner's county, hitherto Demo
I cratic. giving a Republican plurality,
though the United States Senator
stood at the polls all day and worked
for his ticket.
A more outrageous set of lies were j
never perpetrated on a community i
than aro contained in the above arti
cle. It is false in its statements and
false in its implications. There was
never a fairer, a more quiet or a more
orderly election held in Shepherds
town than that of the Gth of Novem
ber last. Xot one person who desired
to vote was intimidated or restrained
from doing so, and every one legally
entitled to the privilege was allowed
to cast his vote to suit himself. The
article is a lie in full, and it is a lie in
detail. Now as to the details:
James Robinson nor any other man
was prevented from polling his vote.
The law provides that no electioneer- |
ing shall be done within 60 feet of the
pulls. Republicans and Democrats
alike observed this law. and no voter
was talked to, even, about his vote,
near the voting place. James Robin,
son and nearly all of the colored men
of the town had full opportunity to
\ < ?t>- and ?o voik f??, . i.' par y. anil
they did so without In! rf-'rence.
We should liivet" hav tie* name
oi the 2? r? ill .t> <?! 1 al'imore and

Ray's count, exco.-d d t li- ir privilege*

There was a differ * of opinion as
to the matter, bu' n ? hi : ? ti at ail
A d isionof theSiat ?> Attorney wa
to the effect t.ia! these persona had A
right to vote.
The statement that twenty men
were k pt drunk until after the elec
tion is a lie out of the whole cloth, as
i- the fairy story about the mountain
eers riding up from Harper's Ferry.
There's not a word of truth in either
statement.
According to a provision of the law.
when fifty votes had been polled the
ballot box was placed in the hands of
the canvassers. It was practically itu
! possible to count the votes in the poll
ing place, so they were taken to the
law office of Mr. J. S. Bragonier, about
fifteen feet away? a custom that has
prevailed as far back as we can re
member. There they were counted
by Messrs. J. S. Bragonier, G. T. Lick
| lider and John Keplinger, three gen
tlemen whose characters stand among
j the very highest in this place. No
' one can honestly question their integ
j rity and fairness. Mr. Fayman is
I quoted as imputing dishonesty to
1 these gentlemen. He is also repre
j sented as saying that "there were five
i ballots more than there were voters.
! and five Republican votes were thrown
out." This is a falsehood, if we can
' trust the gentlemen above named?
and the statement of Mr. Fayman
' himself which appears below. The
truth of the matter is that there were
two mutilated tickets thrown out, one
of them Democratic and the other Re
publican. When the count was fin
ished there were two ballots remain
ing in the box. These were destroyed
without being opened, but owing to a
decided difference in the character of
the paper upon which the tickets
wer* printed, it was readily seen by
all that one was Democratic and one
Republican. So much for the hones
ty of the canvassers.
Now the question is, Who is the au
thority of this vile calumny? Who is
the thief that tries to rob this law
abiding and intelligent and liberal
minded community of its good name
and its honor? We can scarcely be
lieve that any citizen of the town, uo
matter how bitter a partisan he may
be, would deliberately traduce the
town in this manner; but the fart re
mains that even if the author was
some irresponsible newspaper corre
spondent, he must have been fur
nished with the groundwork for his
lies by some onu here. The person or
persons who maliciously aided and
abetted the slander are just as culpa
ble as the boss liar himself. We hope
that all concerned will be smoked out
and held up for the contempt and re*
buke of an indignant and outraged
people.
The following card, written by Mr.
J. S. Fleming and endorsed by Messrs.
Fayman and Hay, is certainly all the
denial necessary so far as they are
concerned:
SHKPHERD3TOWX, W. VA.,
December 4th, 1888.
Editor of the Shepherdstown Regis
ter? Dear bir? Will you permit me
through your columns to reply to an
article in the Philadelphia rrtss of
.November 30th. in which mv name is
mentioned, and 1 understand some ac
cuse me a* being the author, which I
emphatically deny? But that is not
all; this whole community and es
pecially my Democratic triends are
shamefully traduced. So far a- 1 know
there is scarcely a scintilla of truth in
t lie whole article. Itisstaiedthat Jas.
D. Fayman, John R. Hay and myself
made affidavit that the ballot boxes
were removed. The facts are as fol
lows: Jas. 1). Fayman made an affida
vit before me as Notary, substantially
as follows: That he had challenged
live persons as non-residents, who
were allowed to vote by the Commis
sioners, and that the ballot boxes were
taken to the office of J. 8. Bragonier
and counted. Jno. R. Kav and my
II . - . ? r t i . . ? d to the correctness of that.
>,V?rly every voter knows that at ev
? : ^ < lection h< r since we have had a
Boaidof Cam assers the ballot boxes
have been taken to another place and
counted. 1 rved as a canvasser at
three diiTerent elections. The ballots
were always counted at another place.
I \\a~ present at the last election, and
when the count was finished there
was only two (2) ballots in the box,
when the number equal to the votes
had been counted: these were not un
folded at the time.
As to the threats made or the state
ment that it was dangerous for a Re
publican to vote, 1 only have to say
that 1 have lived hwre nearly 50 years
and every one knows I am a Republi
can. but the article above men
tioned is the tirst 1 heard of any
threats. There was no intimidation,
no violence, and 1 am satisfied every
one entitled to vote had the privilege
of doing so unmolested. There were
no mountaineers who rode from Har
per's Ferry or any where else and
voted here. The statement about .las.
Robinson being jerked back and driv
en from the place is entirely without
foundation, as is also the statement
that twenty men were picked up on
the streets before election by the Dem
ocrats and kept in durance until too
late to vote.
In conclusion let me say that the
other gentlemen, both Commissioners
and Canvassers, need no vindication
at my hands. They are gentlemen
above reproach, and would not be a
party to any such proceedings re
ferred to in the article of the Press.
There was a difference of opinion
among the Commissioners as to the
qualification of a few voters. I sup
posed the affidavit of Mr. Fayman to
test that question, or I should not
have certified to it. although the
facts as there stated are known to all.
Respectfully Yours. &<*.,

It gives us pleasure to print, in ad.

Half Fare to Washington.
For the accommodation of all who
desire to witness the inauguration of
President-elect Harrison, the B. & O.
R. R. Co. will sell excursion tickets to
Washington from all points on its
lines at one fare for the round trip.
Tickets will be sold March 1st to 4th,
inclusive, and will be valid for return
passage until March 7th. inclusive.
The H. & O. is the shortest and most
direct route to Washington from all
points touched by its lines. It has
more track and yard room at Wash
ington than any other road and con
sequently more facilities for the
prompt movement of trains and the
expeditious handling of a large pas
senger business than any other line.
The R. & 0. handled an immense
passenger traffic at the inauguration
of President Cleveland, without delay
and without injury to a single pas
senger.
Its facilities have been greatly
augmented since that time and it is in
position to give more satisfactory ser
vice than any line touching Washing
ton.

The President's Message.
The President's message is quite
voluminous, but like all his official
acts and utterances, betokens a pains
taking care to deal fully and justly
with whatever he haB in hand. It
will be searched in vain for a single
word that indicates either regret that
the tariff issue he framed was pre
sented at an inopportune moment, or
the slightest modification of the strong
view of the question he gave one year
ago to Congress and the country. On
the contrarv, he returns with great
vigor to the further argument of the <
subject, and taking as he does the
standpoint afforded him by the cen
tennial of the constitution, he reviews
! the path we have trodden, and points
out the wrongs and the perils which
1 directly spring from our present de
feetive" national policy. And well
may he stand undaunted in the pres
ence of a people who, by a large pop
ular majority, have vindicated his
courage and his wisdom. By a major
ity of many thousands he and his
policy are approved, and. as has
never before happened under like
circumstances, the electoral college
when it meets will reverse the popu
lar verdict. The case of 1876 was not
similar, for then the electoral vote,
honestly chosen, was in accord with
the popular judgment, but it was set
aside bv barefaced fraud. The Presi
dent not only does not retire from the
advanced position he has taken upon
this great economic problem, but he
fortifies his opinions by repeating
what he before said, and adding
other views which the argument of
j the campaign developed so fully. He
aptly and pointedly refers to the com- !
! bination between the producer and
| the government, by which the masses i
are taxed for the benelit of those who
| make and sell, and he points out the
I danger certain to ensue from a policy
| which practically hand* over the peo- j
I pit* to the protection of the rich, who
I receive exceptional benefits Iroui the
government upon the theory ilia'
1 they in turn will tak" care of tiie
laboring poor. He prop- ri s scouts
such a policy and declares inai 1 any
intermediary between the people and
their government, or the I a-t delega
tion of the care and protection tne
government owes to the humblest
citizen in the land, make.- the boast
of free institutions a glittering delu
sion and the pretended boon of Ameri
can citizensiiip a shameless imposi
tion." Mr. Cleveland writes with the
authority and power of a man whose
convictions are thorough and whose
information is full, and with that air
! of confidence which springs from the
i consciousness that the truth, like
other great forces, continues to move
and grow, notwithstanding the efforts
of heretic politicians to destroy it.
This part of the message is likely to
prove yjost interesting just at this
time. It deals, however, with other
questions of great importance. While
| he reports that no instances have oc
curred of outrage or injury to our fish- 1
! eruien in Canadian waters except
! such as the American consul has
readily adjusted, he calls special at
tendon to the unsatisfactory relations
1 between this government ami (Treat
Britain, growing out of the rejection
of the treaty fie submitted to the
Senate, it cannot, of course, be sup
posed that these relations can contin- .
ue to be uninterrupted unless some
permanent basis of operation and set
j tlement be agreed upon by the two ;
1 powers. Retaliation is all well enough
to compel justice and fair dealing, but
that it should become necessary that
the peace of the two great nations
which assume to lead the civilization
of the age should be staked upon such
chances is a reproach to the states
manship of both countries. Unfortu
nately, the burden rests upon our
shoulders, for the obstacle to a settle
ment is the variance between the ex
ecutive and legislative departments
of our own government. A further
reference to our relations with Hug*
land is made in calling attention to
the unfortunate occurrence which
made it necessary to request Lord
Sackville's retirement as the diplo
matic representative of that country.
If anything was needed to justify that
act to the sober judgment and feel
ing of our people, it is found in the
President's statement of the case. It
is fortunate our people were in accord
in dealing with this subject, and that
the <:reat national contest then rag
ing ended at the water-line where our
relations with other sovereignties
! begin. The careful elaborate review
j of our foreign relations and the events
transpiring over the civilized world
i will be read with satisfaction by our
people. Apart from the Canadian
I ditlicultv, our sorest spot is the Hay
; tian outbreak, in which our merchant
men have been seized in several cases.
It is to be regretted that tnese half
1 civilized people should be permitted
to create insurrection and revolution
whenever tiieir passions suggest an
upheaval, and it will be a blessed day
wnen beneath a protectorate of some
kind they are kept down by force
until the nineteentn century march of
! enlightenment does its benign work
among them. Altogetlier tlie message
is exceedingly full and well written.

ranks are leveled and all join in the
one object of making others happy.
To do this, remember that you only
have to come right here and see the
variety and profusion of articles from
which to select your
Christmas Presents!
Goods never were so cheap, our
profits never were so small, and our
great aim is to say when the Holiday
season is over that our sales never were
so large. We would rather have large
sales and small profits than small sales
and large profits, because we can make
just as much, and please our custom
ers better. Come early, and buy, so
you will have time to buy twice, and
tell your friends that it will pay them
to go to
