TELLS DEMOCRATS' PLAN!
ItU'rance of a Statesman Is tl
Comment of All Party I venders
In Congress.
Washington, December 2.?Pres
dent Wllsson today laid before Com
ress the legislative ambition of tli
Democratic Administration.
For exactly 28 minuets the Pres
J dent stood before the assembled Sei
ate and House, in the chamber c
the latter, and read his first annus
message. Applause punctuated In
portant utterances and when he ha
finished there was an enthusiastl
demonstration with liandclappin
and cheers.
Briefly the President outlined
programe for socal justice and th
general welfare of the nation an
proclaimed the aspirations d|f th
United States for international amit
and the maintenance of constiU
tlonal government In all America.
With close, almost eager attentlor
members of the two houses listene
and time and again the legislator
gave vent to their enthusiasm alon
with the crowded gallerres.
BRIEF, BUT POINTED.
Bess than 3.000 words long, th
message was one of the briefest an
most novel of American state paper
?a marked contrast, as presente
by its author today to the hithert
lengthy documents averaging 20,00
words or more droned through by
reading clerk to an inattentive Con
gress.
There was another contrast con
spicuosuly apparent. PresidentWilso
had read three messages before?o
the tariff, the currency and Mexioa
affairs. The first time he addressed
Joint session in person early in thi
term, there was an atmosphere o
stiff formality appluase was libera
a but perfunctory and there was a:
Indefinable air of
?or a century-old custom being rt
vived. Also there was an expeotan
curiosity as to how the Presiden
woul be received. Today the Presl
dent's reception was warm, almos
uproarious as he concluded his read
Ing.
PRAISE FROM ROTH SIDES.
Later, Republicans and Democrat
alike pronounsed the message as th
utterance of a statesman.
"I like the idea of the Presiden
coming before Congress," said Rep
resentative Mann, Republican hous
leader, "and reading a short message
pithy and to the point. In the mail
I like the message today. I thinl
everybody will recognize it as th
uteerance of a statesman, rcgardles
of whether he agree with its details.'
Of particular significance was on
outburst regarded in the nationa
capital today?the unmistakable ap
proval that greeted the President'
remark:
"There can he no certain prosper
of peace in America until Genera
Huerta has surrendered his usurpet
authority in Mexico."
Among those who would discus
the message in Congress there was i
general endorsement of the adminis
tration's policy toward Mexico.
HEARD RY PACKED HOUSE.
The scene of today's function wa
much the same as on the three prev
ious occasions, when President Wil
son has addressed Congress?gal
lerlps crowded with men and womei
of Importance in public affairs, mem
bers of the cabinet, the diplomat!'
corps and the White House family
Democratic leaders were enthus
iastic In their comments on the mes
sane and its recommendations. The;
liked the emphasis placed by th<
President on the need for early actloi
on the currency, for dealing wltl
monopoly through anti-trust legisla
tion, tlio importance of rural credi
legislation to benefit the farmers
the recommendations for governmen
contsruction of railroads in Alaska
the development of the nation's re
sources by a conservation policj
alike acceptable to the state and th<
federal authorities, the enactmen
of employers' liabilities legislatioi
and the selection of presidential can
didates by the primary system.
MEETS WITH APPRHVAi.
The suggestion of the President
that party conventionR as at present
constituted be abolished won muel
applause. As Mr. WilRon declare*
that the party convention should b<
held only to ratify the verdict o1
preferential primaries, that the per
sonnel of the conventions should be
for the most part, chosen from thos*
members of Congress and congres
sional nominees upon whom woulr
devolve the duty of carrying oul
platform pledges, thefe was a wav*
of handclapping, In which Secretarj
Bryan and members of the cablnel
Joined.
"It was a fine, statosmanlik<
speech," said Speaker Clark after
wards, "covering points that I hav*
been agitating for years, particular!)
presidential primaries."
"I think," said Itepresentatlv*
Oscar W. Underwood, "the Presl
dent's message was the address of i
broad statesman, covering the scop*
of the necessary legislative action 01
this session of Congress. It was in HIH
accord with the principles and poll- Kllcies
of our party as declared at Haiti- UIU
Dmore, and I have no doubt it will
meet with favorable action by the
house of representatives."
START ALREADY MADE,
j , For nearly all of the legislation
outlined in the message, the ground
work has been laid, and the Presi- loiai
: dent plans to speak further to Congress
with relation to anti-trust reforms.
Alaskan railroad legislation

man's compensation act has been fa- '
j vorably considered in each house,
i and bills on the other important subIe
jects are in a position to receive iin- ' 'v,>*
mediate attention. '
The declaration for legislation to
provide for primary elections for
1- presidential nominees, without the Tin
?" intervention of nominating conven- ^ia
ie tions, bore immediate fruit in the '
house. Representative Rucker, of
