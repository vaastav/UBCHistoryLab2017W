Gatherings from History.
John Woslev. the founder of
Methodical, was born in KnjjhunJ
in the year of 1703, nd was ed
ucated at Oxford University. He
was couvnrted in K2l. His lirst
efforts at relonnatioa were made
in the vicinity of Oxford, England.
In 17.15, Julia Wesley, with his
brother Charles, visited Georgiii to
preach to tho Colonists; but they
were not very successful in gaining
c inverts to their new system of
theology. They returned to Eng
land and resumed their reform it ry
labors in 1739 with great success.
He died in .1791 at the ago of 88
years. He always claimed to be
u member of the ProteslantUpiseoli
al Church the established church
of England and he and his apos
tates, in a spirit of burlesque, were
called Ranters." 1 The following
incident is told of Wesley :
There was a famous man in
that day, a prominent person in the
ranks "of elegance and fashion,
named "Ueau Xash," who, liko nil
other dandies, was a hopeless fool.
He happened to be present when
Vsley preached at Both, and go.
nig up to mm lieiore the sermon,
lie asked li'nn, "liy what authority
he undertook to preachy" Wes
ley replied, "Uy that Jesus Christ,
conveyed to me by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, when he laid hands
on mo and said, 'Take thou aiiduci
ty to preach the gospel."', Nash
replied that "ho was acting contra
ry to tho laws of the Church."
'I'idyon ever hear mo preach T'
said Wesley. "No, sir,'.1 replied
Nash, "1 judge of you by common
report." "Well, sir," answered
Wesley, "I should be more charit
able than to form my opinion of
you by common report."
Tho (list Methodist congrega
tion in the United States was form
ed in New York City by a few Irish
emigrants in 1700. The first Meth
odist meeting house built in the
United Slates was erected on John
Street, New York City, in 1708. It,
was 00 bv 42 feet; and tho first
sermon preached in it was In Octo
ber of that year, by Mr. Embury
Iwul preacher, who had formerly
pi eai'lied for the Methodist in bis
own house. Previous to the Hcv
pluli inaiy war the preachers in this
country were merely lnj preachers.
there bcinir no authority in this
country in the M. R. Chinch to or
(lain Ministers. This difficulty was
finally settled in 1784, The Rev.
Thomas Coke of the ChuHi of
England was consecrated Superin
tendent,' and Richard Whatcoat and
Thorn : Vasey were ordained El
ders and sent to the United Btates
to carry on the work, which they
did uioi-l successfully. Their first
general Conference was held in
1702. At that time there wero In
the United Slaloo 2fifl regular MetU
odi.ii preachers and 05,000 mem
bers. Now, the Methodists have
more than 6,000 regular and travel-,
ii'g. good local preachers, and
1,000,000 members, of whom 200,
C't 0 arc colored.

The position won by tho French at

by Von Der Tan 11 on Friday, was
again retaken by tho French on
Saturday. General Sonnet having
advanced too far before the troops
was made prisoner. At four other
points the French have been suc
cessful. Gen. Duci'ol is still mas
ter of the situation. The sixteenth
corps, under General Dalkcr, and
the fifteenth corps, under General
liijon, fought with grand courage.
The losses of the Germans during
the two-days' fighting were 6,500,

A lale balloon letter from Taris
states that large quantities of arms,

Paris, and that there are 70.000
Regulars, 90,000 Mobiles and 00,-
000 National Guaids in the city.
Prof. Leone Levi calculates that
all told, devastation and every
thing, France has already lost $3,-
000,000.000 by the war, and will
probably have to pay $ 1,500,000,
000 bid mnity. He places the
total loss of our hf;c ctvnl war at
15(0,500,0110,000. In these losses he
counts the men killed and disabled
at 8!).000 each. It is evident that
they were not worth half lltnl In
themselves.
