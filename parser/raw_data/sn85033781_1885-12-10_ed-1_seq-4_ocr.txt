TRUE NORTHERNER.
Published Every Thursday.
FAW PAW, MICHIGAN, DECEMBKU 10
The tboublk has began Again. Congress
ftisenibled last Monday.
Aix talk about rich men and "boodle
candidates for governor of Michigan, is the
sheerest kind of nonsense. As long as our
etato maintains its penurious system of pay
ing its governor a salary of only a thousand
dollars per year, no poor man need apply.
No one but a wealthy man can afford to ac
cept the office.
Geneiul Kohkciuks has written a labored
article on the "Mistakes of Grant," which
was published in the Xorth American lie
viae. "Old Ilosy" has a good many friends
among the old soldiers and among the people
in general, but he will find it a hard matter to
prove that he is a biger man than old Grant,"
or that he knows more about the late war
than did the deceased general.
Not onit has the present domocratio ad
ministration not paid a single dollar of the
public debt during all the time it has been
in power, but during the month of Novem
ber, according to the statement of the secre
tary of the treasury, there was an actual in
crease of nearly five millions of dollars. The
party in power was never noted for its suc
cessful management of the finances of the
government, and the result of the first nine
months of President Cleveland's administra
tion is pretty fair evidence that the party has
not improved much with age. When, in 18C1,
the democrats surrendered control of the
government to the republican party, tho Na
tion was practicdly bankrupt. In this respect,
the indications are that, if sufficient time be
allowed, history will repeat itself.
Wiixiam II. Vanderbilt, the groat railroad
magnate, dropped dead at his residence in
New York, on Tuesday last at 2:30 p. m.The
cause of his death is supposed to have been
paralysis. lie loaves a family of j fosr
eons and four daughters, all the latter
all married, and who will, probably, inherit
his great wealth which is estimated at $200,
000,000. On the death of his father, the
Commodore, William II. inherited $100,000,
000, to which, by economy and frugality he
had added 100 per cent, besides enjoying
a tolerably good living. He was sixty-four
years of ago at the time he was called to part
with his competency of this world's goods.
His death creates considerable excitement in
financial circles but it is yet too early to
judge what will be the result.
Ketublican senators made a wise choice
when they selected Hon. John Sherman of
Ohio, as the presiding oflloer of the senate
and acting vice-president of the United States.
Mr. Sherman is one the ablest and foremost
statesmen of our country, and will, no doubt,
fill tho office of vice-president with credit to
himself and honor to the people. Had ho
desired it, wo would rather have seen John
A. Logan elected to the office, than any other
man, but for good reasons ho declined the
honor which his republican associates ten
dered him. And he was probably correct in
his judgment, as thero is no doubt that he
can bo of greater service to tho country cn
the floor of the senate than m its presiding
officer, and tho work will be far more cot
genial to him than would be his duties as
president of the senate.
Gekexcackkiw used to complain bitterly
that tho republican party did not pay the
public debt as fast as it ought. To remedy
thi3 state of affairs they assisted, as best they
could, in putting tho democratic party into
power. That party has run the government
nine months, and has not paid a singlo dollar
of the bonded debt. On tho contrary, it has
begun to report a monthly increase, instead of
decrease. It has withdrawn nearly a hundred
millions of dollars from the circulating me
dium of tho country, and piled it np in the
United States treasury where it does no good
to anybody, and which, as far as any present
practical uso is concerned, might as well have
been destroyed. How much havo we gained
by our alliance with the democracy? is a
question that honest, intelligent, practical
men of the geeenback faith, are now asking
of themselves.
Tub South Haven Sentinel and the Paw
Paw Courier should bo ablo to find enough
to do in minding their own business. That
immense jobbing and advertising patronage,
of which the Courier boasts sojrauch, must
surely bo all one democratic editor ought to
attend to, in addition to the dischargo of the
lalor incident to his position as editor of
the organ of the party of his recent choice.
However, bo that as it may, the Nortitehnkb
n not yet ready to perform tho grand trans
formation act and will not go over to the
democracy a i did the Courier man, nor-yet
half way over as did tho Sentinel man. It
has no aspiration nor intontioa af belonging
to tho party of Cleveland and Yaple. Uy
tho way, what has become of Yaplo anyhow?
It is currently reported that he has lost his
grip, and that a Kalamazoo man, and an old
lino democrat at that, is the power behind
the throne, and the dispenser of patronage
for .tho 4th congressional district.
We ruBLisn in another column, a commu
nication from our esteemed friend Join
Kcowles Esq., of Durango, Colorado, on the
silver question. Wo will say right bore, that
we did not intend, in the previous article
mentioning his name, to intimate that his
views on this matter were induced by selfish
motives, or that he was not perfectly honest
in the opinions he entertained. Mr. Knowles
has displayed his well known ability and
ingenuity in compiling and arranging statis
tics to support his argument and theory, and
has written sonn things with which we are in
full aooord. The Nobtiieunib, as we have
repeatedly stated, does not believe in a gold
itaalard alone, but is an advocate of a double
stands rd both gold and silveronly it
wants tho silver dollar to be as valuable,
intrinsica'ly, as a gold dollar, and it desires
tho coinage of silver dollars, containing 100
cents worth of silver, to bo placed upon tho
Barco basis as the coinage of gold free and
untrammeled. We do not believe, however,
that tha demonetization of the silver dollar
in 1873, was at all responsible for tho decline
in tho price of that metal. During the en
tire sixty years preceding such demonetiza
tion, this government had ooinod but $8,045,
833 silver dollars, while since the passage of
tho Bland bill, in February, 1878, less than
eight years ago, it has coined over $200,000,
000 twenty-five times as many as during all
the previous years and yet silver has not
appreciated in value, but, on the contrary,
has steadily declinod. When the weight of
the silver dollar was fiied at 4 12 grains,
it wa.i equal in value to a gold dollar, but in
1873 it had appreciated, or gold had depreci
ated, if that way of putting it is preferred,
until silver dollars were worth about 103
cents and no longer circulated as currency,
to any great extent, but were bought and
sold as merchandise. The great argument of
the advocates of the "buzzard dollar" was
that its coinage would raise tho price of sil
ver to its former standard, but the argument
has been proven, by the logio of events, to
be a fallacious ono, and now, in all fairness,
if they demand free coinage, they ought to
be willing to have the weight of the dollar
increased bo that it shall be what it purports
to be, a dollar in fact as well as in name.
It has often been remarked that thero was
no more effective method of politically killing
a publio man, than to elect him to tho vice
presi Jtncy. Not one man in a hundred can
correctly namo tho different men who have
occupied that office. The recent death of
Vice-President Hendricks has brought this
mattor prominently into notice, and the fact
that most men who havo heretofore filled
that office havo sunk into oblivion and are
nnremembered and their very names almost
forgotten, is emphasizod by tho conflicting
statements made in the public press concern
ing the number of vice-presidents who have
died in office. Tho number has been various
ly stated by leading and influential newspa
pers at from two to five. The latter number
is the correct one. The first vice-president
who died before the expiration of his term
of office was George Clinton, who died in
1812, the last year of his second term. The
second was Elbridge Gerry, whose namo is
perpetuated in the word gerrymander, the
political term for notoriously unfair division
of a state into congressional or representative
districts. Mr. Gerry was elected in 1812 and
died in 1814. The third was William llufus
King who was elected in 1852 and who died
during the first year of his term of office.
The fourth was Henry Wilson who was elec
ted in 1872 and died in 1875, and fifth and
last, Thomas A. Hendricks, over whose sud
den and unexpected death the people aro
now mourning. Twenty-ono different indi
viduals have been elected to this, tho second
office in the gift of the people. Four of the
number. John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, An
drew Johnson and Chester A. Arthur, suc
ceeded to tho presidency, by reason of a
vacancy in that office. Tho mortality in the
vice-presidential office has been somewhat
greater than in tho office of chief magistrate,
notwithstanding tho fact that two of our
pre sidents met their death at tho hands of
an assassin. Twenty-two different men have
filled the ofllco of president, of whom Win.
H. Harrison, Zachary Taylor. Abrhaara
Lincoln and James A. Garfield died before
tho expiration of their terms. Of all the men
who have been honored with an election to
either of tho two principal offices iu our gov.
ernmont but five are now living: Rutherford
B. Hayes, Chester A. Arthur, G rover Clove
land, Hannibal Hamlin and William A.
Wheoler.
The President's Message.
President Cleveland's mo3sago is tho long
est ever laid before the National legislature,
and may be looked upon as a successful at
tempt of "how not to say it." Owing to its
extreme length, it will be read by only a com
paratively small number of people. He re
views at length the relationship between the
United States and foreign countries and finds
it to be, as a general thing, quite satisfactory.
With reference to the tariff question, he
thinks our rovenuo is excessive, greater than
the necessities of the government demand,
and rocommsnds a reduction of duties on the
necessaries of life. He carefully avoids any
thing looking toward free-trade, and remarks
thit such ro Juctions should bo made ho as
not to injuro or destroy American industries,
and so as to avoid injury to American labor.
la view, however, of tho fact of tho increaso
of tho estimates for governmental expendi
tures and of the increase of tho public debt,
it is difficult to understand why tho reveuuo
should bo reduced. Tho present democratic
administration, if it can be correctly judged
by tho record of tho past nine months, may
bo trusted to safely get away with all the
revenue that will come into tho public treas
ury, without any reduction of duties. He
thinks tho ceaseless flow of "buzzard dollars'
from the mint, at the rate of $2,000,000 a
month depreciated as they are will prove
disastrous to tho best interests of tho people,
and in this opinion ho is, doubtless, correct.
Ho deprecates tho fact that tho United States
has no navy, not even a single war veasel
that could keep tho seas against a first class
vessel of any important power, and says that
such a condition of things ought not to con
tinue. A very largo portion of the message
ia devoted to tho Indian question. He
thinks tho truo solution of that question is
to bo found in the educatiou of tho red man.
Many of hU western constituents will disa
gree with this plan. They think tho Indian
is already too highly educated, especially in
the art of war, and in the practice of murder
and rapine, and that as there aro not, and aro
not likely to be, any good Indiana but dead
onos, tho sooner they are exterminated tho
better it will be for civilization and for the
country. He favors the holding of the publio
lands for actual settlers, and condemns
wholesale land-grabbing. Ou the Mormon
question, ho takes a decided stand, and re
commends that a statuto be enacted
forbidding the immigration of Mormon
converts. His views on this question should
receive tho hearty support of the people, re
gardless of all party predilections or partisan
considerations. On tho question of civil
service reform ho presents a well written
essay showing the beauties of the theory of
reform in the civil service, from read
ing which & person might reasonably
supposo that we had at last struck the pana
cea that would effect n permanent cure for all
governmental ills. But when Mr. Cleveland's
theory on this important question, is con
trasted with Mr. Cleveland's practice, the
matter assumes somewhat of a ludicrous
aspect. As a theoretical reformer Mr. Cleve
land is a grand success, but as a practical re
former, he may be bafely trusted to renovate
tho civil service by turning out all republi
cans on tho hypocritical pretense that they
aro "offensive partisans" and filling their
places with partisan democrats. The result
of this method of reforming the civil service
must of course be vastly more beneficial (?)
to tho country than it would bo to tako the
more manly and honorablo position and say
"republican officials must go been use they are
republicans, and their places must bo filled
by democrats because they aro democrats.
On tho whole, tho message, while it contains
some good recommendations it could not
well be otherwise in a document of such ex
trenio length will not take rank among the
really great and important state papera of
tho Nat'.on.
