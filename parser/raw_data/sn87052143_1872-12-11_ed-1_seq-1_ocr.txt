on behalf of each government, aud
of the statement in reply of
each, aud a translation of the award,
are transmitted herewith. This
award confirms the united States iu
their claim in the important archi

It is a grateful duty to acknowl
edge the prompt, spontaneous action
of her majesty's government in giv
ing effect to the award. In anticipa
tion of any request from this govern
ment and before the reception in the
United States of the award signed by
the emperor, her majesty had given
instructions for the removal of her
troops which had been stationed
there, and for the cessation of all ex
ercise or claim of jurisdiction. so as to
leave the United States in exclusive
possession of the lately disputed ter
ritory! 1 am grateful to be able to

of the liitt'urcnces existing betweeu

arbitrators, howevar, disposed tif the
question which had jeopardized the
whole ot tne treaty ana tnreateiieii to
involve the twi nations iu most un
happy relations toward each other.iu
a manner entirely satisfactory to this
government, and in accordance with
the views and the policy which it nau

convened in Geneva in December con
cluded its laborious session on the
14th day of September last, on which
day, having availed itself of the dis
cretionary Doner given to it by the
treaty to awrd a sum in gross, mane

sum of $15,500,000 iu gold as the in

fatigable industry displayed by Mr.
Adums, the arbitrator named ou the
ment, during the
s and dissensions
of the tr:-biiiitil. 1 cordiallv unite
with her majesty ill this apprecia
tion. It is due to the agent ot the
United States, before the tribunal lo
reeortl my high appreciation of the
marked ahiliiy, unwearied patience,
and the pi udeuce and discretion with
which he iiiis toiiaucleil the verv re-
sponsiblp'ttid delu-aie duties commit

learned aud eminent counsel who at
tended the tribunal ou the part of the
government, lo express mv sense of

brought to hear iu the argument, anil
of the result si. happily reached. It
will he the province ot congress to
provide tor the distribution among
those who m.'iv be entitled to it of
their respective shares of the money
to be paid.
Although the sun: awarded is not
payable it lit I a year from the date of
the award, it is deemed advisable that
no time be lost in making a proper
examination oi the several cases in
which indemnification ma v be duo.
Consequently I recomiii"iul the crea
tion ol a board oi commissioners for
that purpose.
THE SAN JUAK BOUNDARY ARBI
TRATION.
By the third and fourth articles of
the treatv of Washington, the re
spective claims of the United States
and of Great Britaiu in their con-
were unable to agree. I recommend
the appointment of a commission to
act jointly with one which maybe
named by tier majesty ior inai pur
Exoerieuce of the difficulties
attending the determination of our
admitted lino of boiyulnry, after the
occupation ot the territory and its
settlement by those owing nllegi-
to the rcsDcetivc governments,
f mints to the iinportauce ot estao
ishing, by natural objects or other
monuments, tne actual one net wren
th tm-ritorv acquired by purchase
from Russia and the abjoiniug pos
sessions of the Britannic majesty
Tho rocrion is now so stiarsclv occu
ied that no conflicting interests ol
individuals or of jurisdiction arc
likelv to interfere to the delay or
embarrassment of tho actual locatiou
of the line. If deferred uutil popu
lation shall enter and occupy tho
tcrritorv. some trivial contest of
neighbors mav agaiu array the two
oiivpi-nmeuts in antagonism. I there
fore recommend tne appoiuimeiii oi
a commission to aet joiully with one
that may bo appointed on the part
ot Great Britian to determine the
line between our territory of Alas
ka and the cotcrininus possessions of
Great Britian.
LEGISLATION TO CONCLUDE THE
TREATY OBJECTS.
In my last annual message I recom
mended the legislation necessary ou
the Dart of the United States to
brin" into operation the articles of
the treatv of Washington of May,
1871, relating to the fisheries and to
other matters touching the relations
of the United States toward the
British North American possessions,
to become operative so soon as the
nroiicr legislation should be bail ou
the part of Great Britian aud her
nossessions.
That U-ifis'.ation on the part of
Great Briliati and its possessions had
not then beeu bad, and during the
session of congress a questiou was
raised, which for the time raised a
doubt whether any action by congress
in the direction indicated would be
come important. This question has
since been disposed of, and I have re
ceived notice that the imperial par
liament and the legislature of the
iirovincitil toveinuierrt rave passed
laws to carry the provisions of the
treaty ou the matters referred to in
to o'neration. I therefore rccom,

VIENNA E.trosiTiot:.
Preparations are making for the
International exposition, to be held
during the next year in Vienna, on a
scale o( very great magnitude. The
tendency of these expositions is in
the direction of advanced civiliza
tion and the elevation of industry, of
labor aud the increase of human hap
piness, as well as of a greater inter
course aud good will between na
tions. As this exposition is to be the
first which will have been held In
Eastern Europe, it i. believed that
American inventors and manufactu
rers win be ready to avail them
selves ofthe opportunity for the pre
sentation of the productions, if en
couraged by proper aid and protec
tion. At the last session of congress,
authority was given for the ap
pointment of one or more agents to
represent this government at the
exposition. The authority thus giv
en uas uecn excrcisca. but m the ab
sence of any appropriation there is
danger that thc important benefit
which the occasion offers, will in a
large degree, be lost to the citizens of
the tinted States. I commend the
subject strongly to your considera
tion, and recommend that an ade
quate appropriation be made for the
purpose, to further aid American ex
hibitors at the Vienna exposition. 1
would recommend, in addition to an
appropriation of money, that the sec
retary oi the navv be authorized to
fit out two naval vessels to transport
between our Atlantic cities and
Trieste, or the most convenient port
to Vienna, aud back, their articles
for exhibition.
OUB MEXICAN RELATIONS
Since your last session, the pres
ident ot tnu .Mexican republic, distin
guished by his high character aud by
his services to his country, has died.
His temporary successor has now
been elected with great unanimity
by the people, a proof of confidence
on their part iu h.s patriotism and
wisdom, which it is believed will be
continued by tho results of his ad
ministration. It is particularly de
sirable that nothing should be left
unaouc bv the government or either
repuplic to strengthen their relations
as neighbors and menus, it is much
to be regretted that many lawless
acts continue to disturb the quiet
oi tne settlements on the border be
twecu our territory and that of Mex
ico, and that complaints of wrongs
to American citizens iu various parts
of the country arc made. The revo
lutionary condition in which the
neighboring republic has so long been
involved lias in some degree con
tributed to this disturbance. It is to
be hoped that with a more settled
rule of order through the republic
which may be expected from the
present government, tho acts of
which just complaint is made will
cease.
THE JOINT COMMISSION.
The proceeding of the commission
under the convention with Mexico
of the 6th of July, 18C8, on the sub
ject of claims, have unfortunately
been checked by an obstacle, for the
removal of which measures have been
taken by the two trovernmeiiLs
which it is believed will prove siic-
cessiui.
MEXICAN FRONTIER INVESTIGATING.
COMMISSION.
The commissioners appointed pur
suant to tne joint resolutions ol con
gress of the 7tu of May last, to inquire
in:o tne ocpredatious ou the Texas
frontiers have diligently made in
vestigatious in that quarter. Their
report upon the subject will be com
iiiuuicated to you. Their researches
were necessarily incomplete, partly
ou account of the limited appropria
tion iiinue uy congress.
The congress of Mexico, oa the part
ui men ut ci mucin, uaa appoinieo
sniiiiui commission to investigate
these outrages. It is not announced
o.tieially, but the press oftliatcoun
try states mat the tullest li'vcstisra
tion is desired, aud that the co-oper
atiuu ui an names couccrueu
uvited to secure that end. I therefor
ecoiiimeiid that a special appropria
tion uc iiiaue, at tne earnest dav
iracticable, to enable the commis
sioners on the part of the United
Mates to return to their labors with
out delay.
THE CUBAN REVOLUTION.
It is with regret that I have agaiu
to auiiounco a continuance of the
disturbed condition of the island of
Cuba. Ao advance toward the paci
fication ot the discontented nart of
the population has been made, while
the niourrectiou has gained no advan
ces, and exhibits no more ofthe
elements of power or of the prospect
ui ultimate success, man were ex hin
ted a year ago. Spam, on the other
baud, has not succeeded in its repres
sion, and the parties stand apparently
in i uc same rcHllve ailllUUe Which
they have .occupied for a long tunc
past. This contest has lasted now
for more than four years. Were it
seen at a distance from our ueighbor-
uouuf we uugui uo .luuiuereul to its
results, although humanity could not
be unmoved by many of its incidents,
wherever they might occur. It is.
however, at our door.
CUBAN SLAVERY.
I cannot doubt that the continued
maintenance of slavery iu Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to
the couliuuauce of this struoole. A
terrible wrong is the natural cause uf
terrible evil. The abolition of
slavery and the introduction of other
reforms in the administration of stov-
eminent in Cuiiu, could not fail to
aovuuce the restoration of peace and
order. It is especially to be honed
that the present liberal government
of Spain, will voluntarily adopt this
iew. i lie law ot emancipation,
which was passed more than two
years since, has reiuaiued unexecuted
iu the absence of regulations for its
enforcement. It was but a feeble
step toward emancipation, but it was
the recognition of right, and was
hailed as such, aud exhibited Spain
in harmony wilh the sentiments of
humanity and of justice, and in sym
pathy with the other powers of 'the
Christian and civilized world. With
in the past fow weeks the regulations
for carrying out the laws of emanci
pation have becu announced, giving
evidence of the sincerity of tho inten
tion or the present government to
carry iuto eoect the law of 1S7U. 1
nave not railed to nrge the consider
ation of the wisdom, tho policy and
the fnstice of a more effective system
for the abolition of a great evil which
oprcsed a race, aud continues a
bloody ami destructive contest Close
to our border, as well a the expedi
ency aud the justice or coiieeaiug
reforms, or which the propriety is
not questioned. Deeply itnpresed
with tne couvietion that the coutinu-
anee ot slavery i one of the most
active cantos or toe continuance oi
of the utihaoov couditiou in Cuba. I
r -grat to" beliVve that citizens of the
Uuited 8UtOB, or those elairaing to be

there elalmed as property, but which

tion as may be proper to denounce- balance at the close of

cou rags, American citizens from

SPAIN AND THK AROBNTINE CON
FEDERATION. It is gratifying to auuouuce that Ihe
ratification of the canveution, con
cluded under the auspices of this
government, between Spain on the
one par; and the allied republics of
the l'seiijooii theothe", providing for
an armistice, have been exchanged.
A copv ofthe instruments is herewith
submitted. It is hoped that this msv
be followed by a perinaueut peace
between the same parties.
SOUTH AMERICA.
The differences which at one time
threatened the maintenance of peace
between Brazil aud the Argentine
republic, it is hoped, are in the way
oi aaiisinctuiy u.tiusiiiiciit,. r n.f
these states, as with the republics of
Central and South America, we con
tinue to maititaiu the most friendly
relatious.
VENEZUELA.
It is with rcirret. however, that I
announce that the government or
Venezuela has made no further pay
ments ou account of tho awards, uu-
dcr the couvention of the "251 li of
April. 186U. That republic is uuder-
MUUt to UU IIUW llllliur!, IS not IjUlll,
anquilizcd. It is hoped, therefore,
that it will lose no time in provnutig
for the unpaid balances of its debt to
the United States, which having
originated in injuries to its citizens
by Venezuela authorities, ana Having
been acknowledge pursuant to a
treatv iu the most solemn form
kuowu among nations, would seem
to deserve a preference over tlebts of
of difiercut origin, and contracted in
a different manner. This subject is
again recommended to the attention
of congress for such action as may be
deemed proper.
JAPAN
Our treatv relations with Japau
remain unchanged. Au imposing
embassv from that interesting and
progressive nation visited this coun
try during the year that is passing,
but being unprovided with powers
fur the siguing of a convention iu this
country, no conclusion in that direc
tion was reached. It is hoped, how
ever, that the interchange ot opinion
which look place during men- Slav
in this country has led to a mutual
appreciation of the interests which
of ihe existing treaty shall be under- J"11" 2.1. 'SS'.."?..1!?.-8

999 87. With the great reduction
of taxation by the acts of congress al
it laatr. session, the expenditure of
the government in collecting the rev
enue will be much reduced for the
next fiscal year. It is verv doubtful.
however, whether any further reduc
tion ol so vexatious a burden upon
auy people will be practicable for the
present. At all events, ns a measure ol
justice to the holder of Hie nation's
certificates or indebtedness, 1 would
recommend that no more legislation
be uau on tins sunject, unless it he to
correct errors of omissiou or com
mission in the present laws, until
sufficient time has clapped to prove
that it can uc done and sun leave suf
ficient revenue to meet the current
expenses of government, puv interest
on the public debt, and provide for
the siukiug tund established by law.
1 lio preservation of our national
credit is of the highest importance.
Next in importance to this comes a
solemn duty to provide a national
currency of' fixed value, as compared
with gold, aud as soon as practicable,
having due regard for tho interests ot
the debtor class and vicissitudes of
trade and commerce, and convertible
iuto gold at par.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the secretary of war
shows the expenditures ef tho war
department for the fiscal year ending
.1 une o0, 1071, to be :(;. vi'vyi aud
taken.
Iu this
connection I renew my re- act,urti," t.or"t fi"':al
commendation of one year ago, that
to give importance ami lo add to the
efficiency of our diplomatic rclttions
with .lapau and China, and to further
aid in retaining the good opinion of
these people, and to secure to the
Uuited States its share of the com
merce destined lo How between these
nations aud the balance of the com
mercial world, an appropriation be
made to support at least lour Ameri
can youths iu each of these countries
lo serve as a part of the official fami
ly of our ministers. Our representa
tive would not even then be placed
on au equality with the representa
tives of Great Britaiu or some other
Dowers. As now situated, our
representatives in Japau and China
have to depend tor interpreters anil
translators upou natives of those
countries, who know our language
lmpertectly, or procure tor the occa
sion the services ot employes iu
foreign business houses, or the in
terpreters of other foreign ministers
TERRITORIES.
I renew the recommendation made
on a previous occasion ofthe trausfcr
lo the department ot the interior, to
which they scent more appropriately
to belong, of all the powers aud du
ties iu relation to the territories with
which the department of state is now
charged by law or by custom.
BELIEF TO CITIZENS ABROAD.
Congress, from -tho beginning of
the government, has wisely made
provTsion for the relief of distressetl
seamen in foreign countries. No
similar provisions, however, has
heretofore becu made ' for the
relief of citizeus iu distress abroad
other than seamen. It is understood
to be customary with other ifovern-
incuts to authorize consuls to extend j he ordered by congress. There exists
vear of $427,834 62. The estimates
for military appropriations for the
next fiscal vear, ending June 30, 1874;
are 832,801,378 78. The estimates of
the chief of engineers are submitted
separately for fortifications, river
and harbor improvements, .and for
public buildings and grounds, and
the Washington aqueduct.
The onicers ot the freed men s
bureau have all been transferred to
the war department, and regulations
have been put into execution for ihe
speedy payment of bounty, pay, Ice,
due to colored soldiers. The propcr-
I coming under that bureau, and all
war accounts for inoiiey and proper
ty prior to 1871, have becfi examined
and transmitted to the treasury for
final settlement.
During tho fiscal year there has
been expended for transportation on
railroads $1,300,000, of which (0,897
was over the l'aclllc railroads: for
transportation by water, $626,873 T2,
and by slage $18,975 84 ; and lor the
purchase of transportation animals,
wagons, hire or teamsters, sc., &c.,
$924,650 05. Abofit $370,000 have
been collected from southern rail
ways during the vear, leaving about
$4,000,000 still due.
The quartermaster has examined
and transmitted lo the accounting
officers for settlement $37,617,271 ol
claims by loyal citizens for quartcr
nmsters' stoies taken during t he war.
Subsisting supplies lo the amottnt of
$8,904,812 have been issued to Indians.
The annual average main strength
ofthe armv was 24,101 white and 2,
404 colored soldiers. The total death
of soldiers for the year.rcported were
367 white and ot colored.
The distribution ofthe medical and
surgical history of the war is yet to
tag contest..
such relief to their citizens or sub
jects in certain cases. A similar au
thority and an appropriation to carry
it into effect arc recommended in the
case of citizeus of the United States,
or sick uuder such circumstances, ll
is well known that such citizeus re
sort to foreigu countries iu great
numbers. Though some of them arc
able to bear the expenses incident -?o
locomotion, there are some, through
accident or otherwise, who become
penniless, and have no friends at
home able to succor them. 1'ersons
in this situatiou must either perish,
cast themselves upou the charity ot
foreigners, or be relieved at the pri
vate charge of our own officers, who
usually, even with the most benevo
lent dispositions, have nothing to
spare for such purposes. Should the
authority and appropriation asked
lor be given, care will be taken to so
carry the beneficence of congress iuto
effect that it shall uot unnecessarily
or unworthily be bestowed.

The route to connect the Missis- ,

Charleston, S. c.. and Savannah, Ga.. ,
by water, by way of Ihe Ohio and ;
Teuucssac rivers, and canals and
slack-water navigation, to tho Savan-
nail and Ocmulgce rivers, has been ,
surveyed imd report mado by on
accomlpished engineer officer of the .
armv. A second and third new route ';
will be proposed for the consideration ;
of congress, namely' by an extension;
of the Kanawha and James fiver

recommend government nut to lues
or other enterprises, uutil ills clearly
shown thai tlicynre not only of na
tional interest, but when completed,
ot a value ceiiiiueiisurate with their
cost. That production increases'
more rapidly than the mentis of trans-!
portRlioti iu our country lias beeu
demonstrated by past experience.,
The rapid growth iu population aud
products of the wholu country will
require additional facilities. That
cheaper means for the more bulky
articles or couiinerco to reacn tiae
water and a market will be demanded
iu the near future, is equally demon
strable. 1 would therefore suggest,
either a committee, or commission to
be authorized to consider this wholo'
question, aud lo report to congros
at some future day forits better guid
ance and legislation ou this impor
tant subject.
The railroads of the country have
been rapidly extended during the
last few years to meet the growing
demauds of producers, and reflect
much credit upon thu capitalists aud
muitagvrs engaged.

THE MISSIKSIl'l'I AND TIDE-WATER.
It "might be well while ou this sub
ject nut only to have examiued and
report upon the various praciicsuie
routes lor coiiuectiug the .Mississippi
with lide-wiitef'oii the Atleutic, but
the feasibility of an almost continu
ous land lucked navigation from
Maine to the Gulf of -Mexico. Such
a route along our coast would be of
great value al all times and of inesti
mable value iu caso o: a foreign war.'
Nature lias provided tho greater part
of this route, huiI the obstacles to bo
overcome are easily within tho-skill
of engineers. 1 have not alluded te
this subject with a.view of bavins
any further expenditure of publio
money at this time than may be ne
cessary to procure and place all the
necessary information before congress
in an aiiiheuic form to enable it here
after if deemed parctii-able aud
worthy to legislate ou the subject
without delay.-
