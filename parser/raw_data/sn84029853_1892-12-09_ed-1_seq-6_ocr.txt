PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
In a Swiss hotel bill of fare lately
one item was supposed to be a refer
ence to the Italian poet Ariosto, but
investigation proved it an old friend
in disguise and suffering from a bad
spell Irish stew.
Piety is not an end, but a means
of attaining the highest degree of
culture by perfect peace of mind.
Hence it is to be observed that those
who make piety an end and aim in
itself for the most part become hypocrites.
Is it any wonder that men are
driven"' insane when they foolishfy
attempt to match a piece of silk for
their wives and the dry goods man
tells them that there are seventeen
thousand styles of the fabric known
to the trade?
An unusually large number of jock
eys have lost their lives or been badly
maimed by accidents on the turf this
season. In'some cases this has been
due to their own carelessness, in
others to large fields in the racing
events, and in others, still, to cir
cumstances which could not have
been foreseen. As long, however, a
jockeys are paid as large sums ol
money as they now receive for win
ning races there will always be plenty
of candidates for positions upon the
backs of the runners. It is danger
ous business, but they look upon the
profits as more than compensation
for all the risks incurred.
When we sum up all the useful
truths which we owe to philosophy,
to what do they amount? When we
look for something which adds to the
comforts or alleviates the calamities
of the human race, we are forced to
own ourselves disappointed.
A San Francisco man was found
dead in bed at an Atlantic City hotel.
He had purposely asphyxiated himself.
It is not strange. Atlantic City at
her best is not charming, and at this
season of the year she is calculated to
drive anybody to suicide or drink.
The New York Board of Health
sent Dr. Siebert to Hamburg to in
vestigate the cholera. He reports
that America must expect a visita
tion from the plague next summer
unless immigration is stopped. The
favorite horn of such a dilemma
should not be hard to find.
The other night the Norwegians
of Chicago met to do honor to the
memory of Leif Erikson. The sturdy
sailor received unstinted praise, and
a $3,000 picture of him was ordered
painted for the "World's Fair. The
Norwegians do well in celebrating
the praises of Leif Erikson. His
daring exploits are well authenticated
and are credited by very high author
ities. But Erikson is no rival of
Columbus and should not be so con
sidered. The latter should, in fact,
be given additional credit for having
made use of all the knowledge ex
tant, bearing on the great purpose of
his life, and for having put it to a
practical use. Erikson's discovery
derives all the more importance from
the fact that it may have been one of
the influences that led Columbus t
make his great voyage. It was Co
lumbus who opened up the new world
to the immigration and civilization
of Europe.
President Harrison's Last An
- nual Message.
To the Senate and House of Rkpskscnta
txyes: In submitting bit annual message to
congress I have great satisfaction in being able
to say that the general conditions affecting the
commercial and industrial interest of toe
United States are in the highest degree favor
able. In comparison, the existing conditions
with the 3 of the most favoiable period in the
history of the country will. I beliSTe, show that
so high a degree of prosperity and so general a
diffusion of the comforts of life were never be
fore enjoyed by oar people.
The pre:ident then gives statistical statements
of the coon try's wealth and adds :

There were issued 23,244 patents last

Because the Viceroy of China has
seen fit to kick and cuff a few of his
inferiors, the hasty conclusion has
been reached that his mind is totter

when it shall be demonstrated in
just what degree the cuffed and
kicked deserved their castigation.
Perhaps the Viceroy is an instance
of raging sanity.
A baijviieaded expert informs the

Tiie famous Easy Chair of Harper's

might be continued by an able and

There must be something pecul
iarly romantic about the southern
part of Virginia. Hardly a week
passes without an elopement. The
couples go across the State line into
North Carolina, and are married
without much trouble. It is worthy
of note, too, that parental forgive
ness usually follows the marriages.
Are the marriage laws of Virginia
too expensive to follow? If not, what
is the explanation?
A Washington expert now bobs up
serenely and appears to demonstrate
that the portrait of Columbus select
ed for the souvenir half dollar is not
authentic. His opinion might have
been of some value before a choice
was made, and besides that it is dif
ficult to conceive that any one man is
so much smarter than Chauncey De
pew as to tell which one of the many
portraits labeled as Columbus is gen
uine. It seems even a greater task
than that accomplished by the origin

A recent article in Scribner's, on

tie known in the West, being eclipsed
by the army, whose famous comman
ders and fighting men were mainly
from the West. The ntjw navy has
been prominently brought before the
whole country, and every community
is personally interested in it. War
ships are designed by naval construc
tors, who also superintend their
building, and as it is an art -of pe
culiar difficulties and technical
knowledge, a special training is given
them. That of the author of
the Scribner article is inte
resting. Assistant Naval Construc
tor W. J. Baxter is an Ohioan, from
Carroll County, and was appointed as
cadetengineeratthe Naval Academy
by Governor McKinley in 1879, and
graduated at the top of his class four
years later; then made a three years'
cruise in various ships, among them
the famous Kearsarge, visiting all
climates, doing duty on deck and in
the engine-room, with cannon and
torpedoes, so as to be familiar with
the special requirements of men-of-war
in all the varied positions in
which they are placed. He was then
sent to Scotland, and for two years
was in one of the largest shipyards
on the Clj-de, where there is an
nually built nearly one-half of the
tonnage of the world. During this
period he assisted in the design and
building of warships and merchant
men, like a regular employe of the
firm, learning from the commercial
standpoint the most economical and
expeditious method of construction.
To study the most advanced theories
of naval architecture he then spent
more than a year at Paris, in the
"Ecole d' Application," the French
government having courteously al
lowed this enviable privilege. Re
turning home in 1889, he was as
signed to duty at the Norfolk Navy
yard, where the battleship Texas, the
cruiser Raleigh, and the coast de
fense ship Amphitrite are being built
by Naval Constructor Bowles. Lieu
tenant Baxter is the first Ohioan who
has been connected with the design
and building of any of our warships.

It is a serious question, and the
solution suggested by a lady traveler
lately returned from a long sojourn
in California is, don't waste your
tears in regretting the much-exacting
plain cook, the incompetent
"general," but employ Chinese labor.
One Chinaman will do the work of
three ordinary English maids. He
is quiet, quick, and reliable; you
never need to give an order twice.
His cooking is perfection, as any one
who has enjoyed not only his roasts
and entres, but his fresh-made bread
and biscuits, will tell you. As a
parlor maid (save the mark!) he
leaves nothing to be desired. His
wages are not exorbitant, and all he
asks is'a modest little cabin in the
corner of your garden or back yard.

of policy and having so much promise as it
seems to me, was begun by the law of March 3,
1S91. Under tu.it, law contracts have been mado
by the postmaster general for cloven ocean mad
routs. The expenditure involved by these con
tracts for tho next fiscal year aproximated $954,

?Sc.nmencan suiP9 of an aggregate tonnage of
a7,400 tons, costing 7,400,000 has been built or
contracted to bo built in American ship yards.
The estimated tonnage of all steamships re
quired under existing contracts, is 05,802, and
when the full service required by these con
tracts is established, there will be forty-ono
mail steamers under the American flag with tho
probability of further necessary additions in tho
orazman and Argentina service. The contracts
recently lot for tho trans-Atlantic service, will
result in the construction of live ships of ten
thousand tons each, costing nine or ten million
dollars, and will add, with tho City of Now

department was authorized by legislation at
the last session to give American registry, seven
of the swiftest vessels upon the sea to our naval

recommends the ratification of the agreement and
was inclined to follow this recommendation.
Certain it is that some action by wnich this con
