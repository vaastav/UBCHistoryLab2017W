Jefferson City Gsslilht Company.
We have before us the annual report of
the secretary of the above company to the
stockholders at their annual meeting, held
November 3,1873, in which he shows the
company to be in a sound financial condi
tion. It appears that the company has an
excess of assets up to that date over aDd
above its liabilities of some $5000, including
$2000 of bonds, which, with the net receipts
of $3000 per month tor November and De
cember. makes a total of some $11.000 on
the tint day of January, with a sufficient
quantity of coal on hand and paid for to run
the works for the next six months.
The company has laid nine miles of addi
tional mam pipes, and erected 317 addi
tional street lamps and service pipes since
the completion of the works, besides other
important improvements, making a total
of eighteeu miles of mains and 622 street
lamps. The last year's receipts show an in
crease of $C197 53 over the preceding year,
with a large increase in the number of con"
Burners.
We eougratuiate the company on its tine
showing. After having used its earnings in
order to make these improvements and ex
tensions, they have added that much to its
actual capital and intrinsic value. It is
now able to start u!i on the first day of
January with a surplus ot some $10,000 and
a large supply of coal, and, as the secre'
tiiry informs us in his report, the net earn'
ings per month are $3000, being equal to
ten per cent on its capita! stock of $300,000,
which ought to make it one of the best
stocks for investment in the market.
Hon. George L. Smith.
This gcutlemaD. recently elected by an
overwhelming majority to represent the
people of the fourth congressional district
of Louisiana in Congress, in place of Samuel
Peters, deceased, has been admitted to his
seat. The question came up through a mo
tion ol Mr. S. S. Cox, a Democratic member
from New York, who offered a resolution to
admit E. C. Davidson, the opponent of Mr.
Peters ia the election of 1872. After some
skirmishing on the part of Democratic and
Republican members, Mr. Butler, of Massa
chusetts, seat to tli© clerk's desk a certifi
cate from Governor Kellogg, which
was read, dated the twenty-ninth ot
November, 1873, stating that at a special
c-lectioa held iu the fourth congressional
distric t on the twenty-fourth of November,
George L. Smith had received a majority of
the votes cast, and was duly elected to rep
resent that district iu Congress. Mr. Morey,
of Louisiana, then moved to amend the
resolution ot Mr. Cox by insetting the
name ot George L. Smith iu the place of
Davidson. The motion finally prevailed,
by a vote of ICI yeas to 94 nays, and Mr.
Smith was sworn in. This is good news for
the citizens of the fourth congressional dis
tri-t, who will have a faithful and efficient
representative iu Mr. Smith. Louisiana is
now, with the exception of the Congressman
at large, fully represented iu the lower
brauch of Congress.
Billiards.
A match game was played last evening
at the St. Charles Exchange, between
Henry Miller aud Krauk Maggioli, the
present amateur champion, Miller giving
the odds of 200 points in 600. A largo
audience assembled, the game having at
tracted a great deal of attention. Betting
was rather lively at first, the odds Maggioli
received making him the favorite. The
stake was $100 a side. With the exception
of otu o, when he run forty-two, Miller was
behind from the s*art. He complained
several times that his hall was not true, hut
the relerree decided that the game having
commenced with that set. a change eolild
not he made unless by consent. When the
game was about one-third finished, Maggi
oli agreed to change the halls, hut Miller
played no better. lie was beuten 123

Louisiana Jockey Club-Postponement.
For a variety of reasons, chief among
which, perhaps, might he named the non
arrival of ceitaia stables and the threaten
ing indications of the weather, the Louis
iana Jockey Club lias postponed the open,
iag of the fall meeting just one week from
dale announced. This will bring the open
ing day to the thirteenth ot December.
We rcgaid this move as quite judicious.
It is true that tonic few may be disap
pointed, hut the additional eclat that will
be obtained by an extra week's preparation
will more than compensate.
Cheap lor Half ilie Money.
The following paragraph appeared in the
Picayune of last AV-.-cing, concerning the
election in Texas:
The empri'ssiun prevails that the entire
Democratic State ticket is elected by $40,
000. The partial returns received show
large gains.
It it cost only $40.000 it was cheap, and,
therefore, it is somewhat singular that it
should "show largo gains." This telling
tales out of school is hardly fair. Such
financial questions should be only discussed
in caucus.

AMUSEMENTS
The Opera.
Last night "Le Trouvere" was rendered
in grand style. We have already particu
larized the exeellenee of the seveiul per
formers in this popular lyric drama. We
have not now time or .space to animadvert
upon Verdi's woful lack of artistic excel
lence in foisting upon an indulgent public a
collection of tuneful airs and harmonious
choruses in lieu of grand opera, hut this we
do admit—that " II Trovatore" with cn
American audience is always popular for
it is always understood.
The music is easy, graceful, and ever pop
ular. The opera needs no libretto, for the
music tells its own story. Scarcely any odb
could fail to uidirstrnd the interpretation
of M. Devoyod, M. Gadilhe. M. Feitiiuger,
and Milo. Denain and Mme. Furech-Madier.
To morrow night we are to have llalevy's
grand opera, "La Juive." At the matinee,
the comedy, in three acts, "Miss Multon,"
will be produced, supplemented by one of
Offenbach's operettas, "Le 00." Sunday
evening will be given Donizetti's grand
opera, "Lucia de Lamineruioor," preceded
hv a commedietta, "La Battaüle des
Dames."
St. Charles Theatre.
Mr. Joseph Murphy wilLcIose his engage
ment at the St. Charles to-morrow evening.
To night he will take his farewell benefit,
and a a hili of unusual attraction is offered.
The performance w ill consist of the best
portions of the new drama, "Maum Cre."
including the new songs and the Hugh
McGinnis scene ; also selections from
the protean drama of "Help," in which
the star will appear iu all of his
specialty songs and dances. In addi
to this Mr. Murphy will uct Larry for the
first time here, in the rattling Irish comedy
called "More Blunders Thau One." This
affords an opportunity to see him in all
phases as an actor, and the house will be
tilled.
Academy of 9Iu«ir.
The "Hidden Hand" was the attraction
at the Academy last night. This evening
the great play "of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" will
he revived, and it will he put upon the
stags and acted wi:-h the same excellence
that marked its first production here. Little
Minnie Maddern is now the best representa
tive of Lea known. Miss Alice Harrison,
who will make her last appearance here on
Sunday night, will be the Tops;/.
Saturday noon another gift matinee will
be given, and another sewing machine is
off ered as a prize for the lucky ticket holder.
"Bertha" is the play selected for the mati

The New Postofflee Boxe«.
If persons who find they have not the
same numbered postoffice lock boxes as un
der the old arrangement will si rive to un
derstand the fact that the numbers ou the
new lock boxes do not correspond with
those formerly in use, they will, perhaps,
realize that Postmaster Ringgold does not
deserve all the swearing at the disappoint,
ed indulged in. And the disappointed
will soon cease to have cause to complain if
they will but promptly notify their corre
spondents of the change in their address.
Great benefits ofttinres have slightly incon

A Startling Report.
Passengers by the LaBelle.from Red river,
bring the harrowing report that Judge
C'uny, the successor ot Judge Crawford, so
recently assassinated in cold blood, has also
been murdered. We have no means of
verifying tliia rumor, and truly hope it is
not true; but outrages lepeatid time and
time again in the past justify us in believ
ing that almost any crime may with im
punity be committed in that unfortunate
section of our State.
The uurder of Judge Cuuy is saht to
have been perpetrated at Columbia, in Winn
parish. We shall await more definite in
foraiation w ith great anxiety.
War.
The news from Havana last night was of
such a character as to induce the belief that
war with the Spaniards in Cuba ia iuevita
ble. The newly appointed Captain Genera!
has chosen to resign rather thau surrender
the Virginias to our government, and in
this course he is eustaineil by. the
dominant party in Havana. Thus Cuba is
in open rebellion against the Spanish gov
ernment. The duty of our Congress, now
fortunately in session, is unmistakable, and
forty-eight hours will probably show that
it will not shirk its responsibilities. Let
those, therefore, who wish to spend their
winter with the army in Cuba get them
selves ready for the final word, which will
doubtless come ere many hours.
The Hit. Louis Mutual in Court.
, The affairs of the St. Louis Mutual Life
i Insurance Company have again begun to
assutii" prominence, aud are again the sub
ject of litigation. A motion for tho ap
pointment of a receiver aud the winding up
of the company was offered yesterday by
the attorney of Mr. Cottril. It was op
posed by General Noble and Colonel Gantt,
who contended that the court could cot en
tertain the motion until there had been a
trial, and while another suit having the
same object was pending before another
court. Mr. Ivineilly and Judge Clover rep
resented the plaintiff. The matter was
taken under advisement by Judge Kram
until this morning, when he will decide
whether the case shall go to trial or not.
The affidavit of A. Miltenberger, aa ac
countant, was iiied in the same court, lie
gives a statement of the resuit of a personal
examination, made by him ander tho direc
tion of the superintendent of tlie Insurance
Department. From this statement, it ap
pears that between December 31, 1872, and
May 31, 1873, the loss cn the business of
the St. Louis Mutual Insurance Company,
was $360,358, and between May 1. 1873, to
October 1, 1873, the loss was $158,802 35;
that much of the loss arises from the fact
that policy-holders had to a great extent
censed to pay premiums on their policies,
and almost the only source of inc« me was
trom interest on the loans of the company;
that tie company, during the last men
tion! d interval, had doue a very small
amount of new business, and its business
was decreasing. He gives it as his opinion
that the company can not retrieve its con
dition. but, on the contrary, that its condi
tion will continually grow worse, and the
only result of permitting tba present status
of the rompany to remain, w iil be to further
diminish the assets, without any c-oires
ponding advantage to the policy-holders.
The affidavit of Watson L. G inft wasalso
filed. Mr. Gantt was in the employ of Mr.
Charles U. Peck at the time the insurance
building was erected, and he alleges that
the timber and labor ot the meu w a»s used to
a wrong purpose.

3IORE MAIL ROBBERIEH.
Arrest of Ifaé Postmaster nt Fort Jessup,
Louisiana —He Is Committed for Rob
bing the Mail -Arrest of tlie Assistant
Postmaster at Alexandria for Embez
zlement—Attempt to Kescae the Pris
oner.
A short time ago the special postoffice
agent in this city. Mtjor Selye, hb is well
known, took his departure for the Red river
country, hut with what intentions was then
unknown. Yesterday a Times reporter hap
pened to stroll into the office of United
States Commissioner Grant, and found him
about to commence »he examination of two
postoffice eases, which had been brought
beiore him by Major Seyle.
The first and most important of these
cases was that, of Theodore Beck, postmas
ter at Fort Jessup. Louisiana. It appears
that the proceedings ia this case were insti
tned betöre H. C. Meyers, a United States
commissioner at Natchitoches, by whom the
testimony taken at the examination is certi
fied. From that testimony and tho papers
in the ease we gather the following state
ments and allegations, the truth of which
will hereafter be made the subject of more
careful scrutiny and examination in the
United States court.
In brief, the charge against Mr. Beck is
that being and acting as postmaster at
Fort Jessup, Louisiana, he did, on or about
the eighth day of March, 1872. willfully and
feloniously rob the United States mail, by
opening a registered package numbered tour,
which had been mailed to Hamilton. Texas,
addressed to the postmaster at New Or
leans, and which package contaiued a re
gistered letter addressed to Charles J.
Petersou, No 306 Chestnut street, Philadel
phia, said registered letter supposed 1 1 con
tain money, amount not ascertained, sent
by one • Jeorgo P. Rains, of Hamilton, Texas,
to Charles J. Peterson.
The testimony taken before Commissioner
Meyers is t« the effect that a letter of the
description given was sent from Hamilton,
as stated, ia a registered letter envelope No.
4; that the same passed through the mails
regularly until it reached the office at Fort
Jessup ; that there the original package en
velope, which contained the registered
letter, was broken open by the accused and
r.tled, after which the same was resealed
and placed in another registered package
envelope, addressed and post marked by
Beck, ami thus continued on its way to this
city. From the testimony of Major Selye,
taken iu the case, it appears that in Novem
ber past he oroceeded to Fort Jessup and
confronted Mr. Beck with what is known
as a " tracer." which bore the indorsements
and signatures of all the postmasters of
the different offices through which the
registered package had passed, iucluding
tho accused, who acknowledgedliis indorse
ment on the " tracer," and that the hand
writing on tiie registered package envelope
No. 4, hearing the post mark and address,
was also his handwriting.
The testimony further shows that on the
arrival of the package at New Orleans
(which was the onlyoftice where it could be
opened after leaviuj the mailing office), it,
was ascertained that the registered letter
had been tampered with, and an indorse
ment was made on iras follows: "Received.
New Orleans, in this condition—has the ap
pearance of having been opened and
robbed. VV. Richards, registry clerk."
With this indorsement the letter wont on
to its final destination, Philadelphia, where
it was again indorsed as having been re
ceived in had condition. The particular
p-jut called out in the testimony is that
there is no similarity between tne hand
writing of the written past mark ar.d ad
dress on the substituted îegistered envelope
No. 4 aud the indorsement of the post
master at Hamilton Texas, on the "tr xeer,"
and that the handwriting ot the indorse
ment on the "tracer" of the postmaster at
Fort Jessup is the same as thit wh ch ap
pears on the registered package No. 4. both
of which it was proven the prisoner ac
knowledged to be Iris own.
On the examination before Commissioner
Meyers the accused was held to bail ia the
sum of $ 1000, ami was immediately brought
to New Orleans by Major Selye. oy whom
the arrest was originally made. The papers
passing into the bands of Commissioner
Grant, a iurtber examination was ordered,
hut the accused waived it. and was accord
ingly committed for trial, aud bond re
quired m the sum named above.
Theo- her case trought before Commis
sioner Grant was that of E. O. Biossat, as
sistant postmaster at Alexandria, aud a
young man who lias always erj-vred a most
excellent reputation. Young Biossat, it ap
pears, was arrtsted on the affidavit of Major
Selye, special agent of the Postoffico De
partment. and by vhom he is charged with
having, on the teith day of August, 1873,
feloniously embezzled from the mails of ihe
United States a certain registered letter or
package containing $309. which package
had been placed untie mail at Natchitoches,
to he forwarded to New Orleans. Tho tes
timony taken at the examination shows that
three different packages, numbered re
spectively eight, nine and ten, had been
registered and mailed at Natchitoches, and
all of them had Lv-en lost. No. 8 was
traced into the hands of the accused, who
was unable to show what he did with it.
having no record in the office of it, nor any
receipt. Tue package was proven to have
beeu placed iu a lock pouch at Natchitoches,
which pouch was afterward delivered into
the hands »d Bio-sat at Alexandria.
Some testimony was also elicit 'd from
Henry M»y*is,«»f Natchitoches, inspecting
package No. JO, which contained a regis
tered let ter from him fo M. G. Cole, of
New" Ui leans. The letter did not contain
money, out a valuable document.
No testimony was taken for the defense,
aud so the accused was committed for trial
before the district court, and held to hail iu
the sum of $1009.
An incident connected with the arrest of
Biossit was an attempt made by eitiz-us to
rescue him from the hands of Major üelye,
which we hear, through some of the pas
sengers on the LiBeile, on which boat both

Committeeman Odilen Pleased at the Sit
uation—He is Snag h I ne ot tho Over
throw of the Kellogg Government
Whnt be Predicates his Hopes Upon.
The action of the House in seating Shel
don et al. produced at first a very discour
aging effect upon the friends of Louisiana,
who-are here in the interest of the Mo
Enery government. An anyVyait ■ of the
situation has, however, greatly relieved the
gloom, and Mr. Ogden, the only member or
the People's Committee now in Washington,
expresses himself satisfied that nothing
that has occurred will prevent a thorough
investigation of the whole matter, and feel,
confident of the ability of his committee to
compel an investigation and overthrow the
Kellogg government.
^ He adds that he is working upon the
Senate, and expects to make so clear a case
betöre the new Committee on Elections and
Privileges that its report will control the
action of the government. It is now evi
dent the great oontest will take place
before this committee, which was appointed
to-day, and to which the credentials of Me
Millen and Pinchhack have already been
referred. It will be a new fight, as the
work of the last committee elapsed with the
expiration of the old Senate. The commit
tee is well composed, and the trial of this
important case will, no doubt, be thorough.
The fate of the Louisiana case seems now
to be regarded as in its hands.

Washington, December 4.—An Asso
ciated Press dispatch from Havana says
that Jouvellar resigns the captain general
ship, and requests tho appointment of a
successor who can carry out the orders of
the government to deliver up the Virginius.
The feeling of the people in Havana is

ders the Captain General to deliver up the
Virginius. General Jouvellar respectlfilly
l-esigus his position, and demands that an
other person be sent to take his place, who
can carryout the orders of tho government.
Considering the exajted state of public
opinion or the impossibility of overcoming
the difficulties, General Jouvellar submits
that a manifest was prepared for delay,
during which opportunity would be given
for reflection and time given to allay the
fiery, patriotic Fpirit of the great national
party in Cuba, hut the strong orders from
Madrid, immediately to be executed, de
prives him of this resource through which
he hoped to assist in the upholding of the
authority and interests of the country.
In order that the Madrid government
may comprehend the difficulties of the
situation and do justice to the ardor anil
perseverance with whicli he began his la
bors, which had already begun to produce
fruit, the Captain General described the
situation on the island. lie declares that
the impression produced by the news of the
arrangement which has "been completed
between $pain and the United States can
be compared with that produced in Spain
by the treaty of Bayonne, which led to the
war of independence against Napoleon.
lie begs to assure the government that
the immediate delivery of the Virginius
will instantaneously cause a frightful com
motion throughout the island, which would
bo euro to result in successive catastrophes,
even if a man of the highest ability ehould
be in command here.
The above dispatch was forwarded early
in tlie evening. Public tecling is intensely
excited, bnt the greatest order prevails,
owing to tho confidence which General Jou
veliar inspires.

The Feeling in Havnnn Last Night—A
Conflict Can no Longer be Avoided.
[Third Dispatch.]
The city continues (jniet. The aspect of
the Virginius question is unchanged. Mauy
intluential Spaniards in conversation to
night express the opinion that further diffi
culties can be avoided, provided tho condi
tions of the surrender of the Virginius are
changed.
They are not unwilling to spo lier deliv
ered into tho hands of a neutral power and
the qui stion of her right to hear the Amer
ican flag decided by arbitration. The ma
jority of the people are determined not to
permit tlie surrender of the Virginius di
rectly to the Americans, and if ibis is in
sisted on there will be a serious conflict.
Calm people express the hope that the
United States will waive the question of a
direct delivery.
The authorities are willing to obey the
mandates ot Castelar, and if the govern
ment of the United States insists, the au
thorities will he compelled to abdicate.
The situation is extremely complicated aud
nobody can foretell the result. There is no
naval vessel of the United States in port.
One British man-of-war is here.
Everything Linges on the manner in
which the Virginius is to be delivered. The
authorities can not count *n the support of
the people in carrying out the surrender.
A number of Englishmen have arrived in
Havana to look after their commercial in
terests ia the crisis.
Cnntelar's Action.
It seems President Castelar inquired by
telegraph as to the state ol popular feeling
in Cuba on the settlement of Jhe Virginias
affair. The Captain General replied that
the people were unanimously opposed to
the steamer's surrender, hut befo
answer could he received at Madrid 0
telar telegraphed the terms ot tho dei
iu the port of Havana. This caused
greatest surprise among Spaniards, who
peered a contrary course.
What a Havnnn Newspaper Says.
The Gorro Frigie declar s that the repub

The (Spaniards in New York Denounce
Admiral Polo and the Protocol.
A number ot Spaniards met iu this city
to-day, in answer to a call which had been
freely circulated, to protest against the pro
tocol entered into by Secretary Fish and
Admiral Polo :n regard to the Virginius af
fair. J. Ferrer de Canto presided and de
nounced Admiral Polo's action, and said
that his views would he indorsed by every
leading Spaniard on this side of the Atlan
tic.
He had. he said, received letters to tlii
effect from Spanish residents of other cities.
Other speakers followed, contending that
the United States had no right to interfere
with the execution of the Vii-giuius pris
oners, and arguing that, according to a
treaty previously existing between the
two governments, the prisoners could not
claim protection of the American flag,
as tlie aet of carrying arms against
a nation with which the United State»
was at peace forfeited their citizenship.
The meeting agreed to issue an address to
the citizens of Spain, setting forth that
the Spanish residents of New York have no
sympathy with, and do not countenance
Admiral Polo's action. It will also protest
against the Spanish government's accept
ance of the terms of the United States gov
ernment.

The London Press on the President's
Message.
London, December!, 5 A. M.—The Times,
iu a leader on President Grant's message,
says: The excessive privileges in regard to
freedom from searoh claimed for vessels
bearing the American flag would confer im
munity on an open pirate. Such pretensions
are indeed short sighted for a mercantile
nation. We can not for a moment believe
that Congress will adopt the suggestion to
prohibit national hanks from paying inter
est on deposits. We do not agree n ith the
President's financial remarks generally,
and think lie is wrong in attributing the re
cent troubles to tho peculiar character of
currency.
The advice to return to specie payment
would he more satisfactory ii the President
told the country how to do it.
The article praises the message for its
moderation rf tone in general, and on the
Cuban question m particular. England, it
says, will unreservedly support the policy
which requires that hpain must really, as
well as nominally, control Cuba.
The Dathj Ncrrs says the President's lan
