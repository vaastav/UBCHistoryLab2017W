FORKION URtiATtONfli
During the past year nothing has
occurred to disturb general frlondly
nnd cordial relations of tho United
States with other powort. The cor
respondence submitted horowllh be
tween this government and lis diplo
matic representatives of olhor coun
tries Indicates the sallsl'actory condi
tion of ail questions between tho Uni
ted Slates and tho most of these coun
tries, nnd with a fow exceptions, to
which rcfcrcnco Is hereafter made,
ihe absence of any points of differ
ence to bo udjtisfcd.
Tlio nol Ice directed by tho resolu
tion of congress of Juno 17, 1874, to
bo given to terminato the convention
of July 17, 18o9, bntweon tlio United
States nnd Uelgium has been given,
and tho treaty will accordingly ter
minate on the llrst day of July, 1876.
This convention secured to certain
Uelgium vessels entering tho ports nt
tho United Slates, exceptional privi
leges which are not accorded lo our
own vessels. Other features of the
convention have proved satisfactory,
and bavo tended to the cultivation of
tho mutually hcucllclul commercial
intercourse and friendly relations be
tween the twoeouutrles. I hope that
tho negotiations Hint have been In
vited will result In the celebration of
another treaty which may tend to the
interests of both countries.
KKI.ATIONS WITH CHINA
continue to lie friendly. During tho
past year the fear ol hostilities be
tween China nnd Japan, growing nut
or the lauding of an armed force upon
Ihn island ot Ionium by the latter,
has occasioned uneasiness. It is earn-c-tlv
hoped, however, that theditll-
cullies arising from this cause will be
adjusted, and that Ihe advance of
civilization in these empires may not
lio retarded uy a stale ot war. in
consequence ol i lie part tuiieii by
certain citizens of the United States
in this expedition our representa
tives in tlio-o countries have been in
structed to impress upon the govern
ments of China nnd Japan Ihe firm
intention of the country to maintain
strict neutrality lu the'eveut of hos
tilities, and carefully prevent any In
fraction of law on the part of our
citizens.
lu connection with this subject I
call tho attention of congress lo u
generally conceded fact that. Ihe great
proportion of Chinese immigrants
who come to our shores do not come
voluntarily In make their homes with
us and their labor productive of the
general prosperity, but como under
contract witli head men who own
them almost absolutely, lu a worse
form does lids apply to Chinese wo
men. Hardly a perceptible propor
tion of them peiiurm any honorable
labor. Hut they are brought for
shameful purposes to the disgrace of
tho communities where settled, and
to tho great demoralization of the
youth ol those localities. If this bad
practice can bo legislated against, it
will be my pleasitreiis well as my duty
to ciilorce regulations in secure so de
sirable an end. It is hoped that ne
gotiations between (lie government j
of Japan and the other powers, look
ing to the furl her opening of the Kin
pi re and to the removal id' various
restrictions upon trade and travel,
may soon produce the results desired,
which cannot tall to inure to the ben
ell t ol all parlies.
Having on previous occasions sub
milled to the consideration of con
gress the propriety or the release ot
ihe Japanese government from the
further payment ot indemnity under
tho convention of October '.'-, lHiil,
ami as no action had been tuken
therein, it became my duly to regard
the obligations of the convention as
lu force; and as the other powers in
terested have received their portion
of the indemnity in full, the minister
of the United Stales nt Japan has
been noli tit.il that this government
received the remainder due to the
United States under Ihe convention
ol Siulousky. 1 submit ihe propri
ety of applying the income of a part,
if not the whole ot this fund, to Ihe
education lu the Japanese language
of a number of young niuii to be
under obligations to servo the gov
ernment for a specllled lime as inter
preters at the iegution and the con
sulates in Japan. A limited number
of Japanese youths might al the same
time l.o i.duialcd in our vernacular,
and bitiietits would result to both
governments. The importance of
having our own citizens competent
and familiar wilh tho language of
Japan, to act ns interpreters and lu
other capacities connected with tlio
legation nnd eotiiiilates in that coun
try, cannot readllv bo overestimated.

connection I renew niv recommenda
tion made at the nooning uf tho last
ses-ioii of congress that a special court
be created to hear and .doterrulno all
clrtlun of allons against tho United
States arising from nets committed
against the persons or property dur
ing tho Insurrection. It appears
cqultsblo that opportunity should be
ottered for porsousof other tittles to
present their claims, nt well as those
Uritlih ttihjecti whoso claims were
not ndinlssablo under tho Into com
mission to tho early decision of n
competent tribunal. 1 recommend
tho necessary legislation to organize
a coui t to dlsposo of those claims or

equitable and satisfactory muiincr,
aud to relievo congress ami tho de
partments t ro m tho consideration of
theso questions.

that tho authority of congress be

There has been no material change
lu our relations with independent
stales within this hemisphere, which
was formerly tender the dominance of
Spain. Marauding on tho frontiers
between Mexico and Texas siill fre
quently takes place, despite Ihe vigi
lance ot Ihe civil mid military author
ities in that quarter. The dilllcully
ot cheeking such tresspasses along the
course of a river id' such length us (lie
Kin (iiaude, and so often fordable, is
obvious. It is hoped that the ell'orls
of this government will I. e seconded

a report upon the condition of the
business iieiore i no .American ami
Mexican Joint claims commission,
made by tho agent on the part of the
United States, nnd dated October 'ii.
1871, it appears that of ihe 1 1, 107

tlio United States, 18:) had been
finally deelded, and seventy-live were

been disposed or, reducing somewhat
the number still pending mid olheis
have been passed upon by Ihe arbi
trators. It has become apparent, in
view ot these figures, ami of the lucl
that tho work devolving on the um
pire Is particularly laborious, that
the commission would bu unable to
dispose ol the entire number of claims
pending prior lo the Hi st day ot Feb

piration. Negotiations were pend
ing looking to Ihe securing of I ho re
sults ot Ihe decisions which have
been reached, and to a lurther exten
sion of tho commission lor a limited
lime, when it is confidently hoped
will sullleo to bring all Ihe business

KXPATlilATIO.
I have again to call tho attention ot
congress to tho unsatisfactory condi
tion of ihe existing laws with refer
ence to expatriation and the election
ol nationality. Formerly, amid con
Hiding opinions and decisions, it win
dilllcutt to exactly determine how
far tho doctrine or perpetual alle
giance was applicable to citizens of
Ihe United States. Congress, bv uti
act nt' Ihe U7lh of July, 18G8, asserted
the abstract right of expatriation ns u
fundamental principle of this govern
ment. Notwithstanding such asser
tion, ami Ihe necessity ol Ireqiienl ap
plication of the principle, no legisla
tion bus been had defining what acta
or lorinalltics shall work expatria
tion, or whethur a citizen shall be
sleeined to have renounced or In have
lost his citizenship. The Importance
of such delluiliou is obvious. Tlio
representatives of the United Stale
lu foreign countries are continually
culled upon lo lend Ihelr aid mid tho
protection of the United Slates to
persons, concerning the good faith or
ihe reality ol whose citizenship Ihoro
Is at least great question, lu some
cases the provisions of Ihe t realise
furnish some guide; in others it
suviii lull to Ihe persons claiming tho
benefit, of citizenship while living in
a foreign country, contributing in no
manner to the performance of the ob
ligations and duties uf neillzeu of tho
United Sales, simply as a 'shield from
Ihe performance uf tho obligations of
a citizen elsewhere. The stains ot
children born ol American parents re
siding in a foreign country, of Amer
ican women who huvu ni.ii rieil aliens,
uf American citizens residing abroad.
Where such queitioti is not regulated
by treaty, are nil sources ol frequent
difficulty and discussion, 1. emula
tion nu these and similar questions,
and particularly as lo the lime when
ami under what eireiiin-iances expa
triation can bu accomplished, or Is to
be presumed, is especially needed.
lu this connection, I earnestly call tho
attention ot congress lo the dillleiil-
lies arising Iroin fraudulent naturali
zation. The United States wisely,
freely mid liberally oilers its citizen
ship to nil who may come in good
lalllt lu reside wtllilll Its limits nu
Ihelr complying wilh certain pre
scribed rc.isisnahtii and simple formal-
Hies and conditions. Aiuoug Hiu
highest duties of the government is
that to afford linn, ellleient ami equal
protection to all its citizens, whciiior
unlive norn or naturalized. Cuo
should betaken thit.it right, carry
ing with it such support from the
government, should not be fraudu
lently obtained, uud should be be
stowed only upon lull prool o a com
pliance Willi tlio law. I' requeul in
stances abound uf illegal and I radii -
lent naturalization, uud uf Ihe unau
thorized use of cerlilieales thus im
properly obtained, ' lu souid caes tlm
fraudulent character nf tho naturali
zation, bus appeared upon the laeo of
the certitieato ilself ; in others exam
inations disclose Hint the holder had
not complied with the law, and in
others, cerlilieales have been ob
tained where the persons holding
them not only were not entitled lo bo
naturalized, bat had not even been
within the United States nt the linu
of Ihu pretended initurallz illon. In
stances pi each of those el uses of
frauds aro dlscovcro.1 at our lega
tions, where Hie cerlilieales nf iiatur
allzalioii are presented, either for tlio
purpose of obtaining passports or in
demanding the proieciionof the lega
tion, when the fraud again appears on
tho face of such cerlilieales. Tliev

ol Ihe government nnd lorwarded in

tho record of the court lu which the
