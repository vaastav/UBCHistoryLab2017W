PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
TO TUB . , .
Two Houses of Congress,
AT THE
Commencement of the Second
,sei&ion of
the Thirtu-JSinth
Congress.
Fdlox-cilizcns of the
Rrpre.ienlatiies:
Senate and House oj
After a brief interval the Congress of the
United States resumes its annual legisla
tive duties. An all-wide and, merciful
Providence has abated the pestilence which
visited our shores, leaving its calamitous
traces upon Booie portions of our country.
I'eace, order, tranquillity, and civil au
thority have been formally declared to ex
iwt throughout the whole of the United
States. In all of the States civil authority
lias superseded the coercion of arms, and
the people, by their voluntary-' action, are
maintaining their governments in full
activity and complete operation. The en
forcenientof the laws is no longer "obstruct
ed in any State by combinations too power
ful to be suppressed by the ordinary course
of judicial proceedings;" and the animosi
ties engendered by the war are rapidly
y ielding to the benificeut influences of our
free institutions, and to the kindly effects
of unrestricted social and commercial in
tercourse. An entire restoration of frater
nal feeling must be the earnest wish of
every patriotic heart ; and we will have ac
complished our grandest national achieve
ment when, forgetting the pad events of the
past, and remembering only their instructive
lessons, we resume our onward career as a
free, prosperous, and united people.
KESTORATION'.
In my message of the 4th of December,
18(55, Congress was informed of the meas
ures which had been instituted by the Ex
ecutive with a view to the gradual restora
tion of the States in which the insurrec
tion occurred to , their relations with the
General Government. Provisional gover
nors had been - appointed, (conventions
called, governors elected, legislatures as
sembled, and Senators and llepresentatives
chosen to the Congresa of the United States.
Court had been f opened for the enforce
ment of laws long in abeyance. The block
ade had been removed, custom-houses re
established, and the internal revenue laws
put in force, in order that the people might
contribute to the national income. Postal
operations had been renewed, and efforts
were being made to restore them to their
former condition of efficiency. The States
theicselves had been asked to take part in
the iigh, function of amending the Consti
tution, and of thus, sanctioning the extinc
tion of African slavery as one of the legiti
mate results of our internecine struggle.
Having progressed thus far, the Execu
tive Department found that it had accom
plished nearly ail that was within the scope
cf its constitutional authority. One thing,
however, yet -remained to be dons before
the work f restoration could ba completed,
and that was the admission to Congress of
loyal Senators and ; llepresentatives from
the States whose people had rebelled
against the lawful authority of the General
( Government. This question devolved upon
the respective' Houses, which, by the Con
stitution, are made the judges of the elec
tions, returns, and qualifications of their
own members; and ' its consideration at
once engaged the attention of Congress? "
In the meantime, the Executive Depart
ment no other plan having been protosed
by Congress continued its efforts to per
fect, as far as possible, the restoration ,of
the proper relations between the citizens of
the respective States, and the Federal Gov
ernment, extending, from time to time, as
the public interests seemed to require, the
judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the
country. With the advice and consent of
the Senate, the Eecessary officers were ap
pointed, and appropriations made by Con
gress fur the payment of their salaries.
The proposition to amend the Federal
Constitution, so as to prevent the existence
of slavery within the United States or any
place subject to their jurisdiction, was rati
fied by the requisite number of States ; and
on the 18th day of December, 1865, it was
officially declared to have become valid as
a part of the Constitution of the 'United
States. All of the States in which the in
surrection had existed, promptly amended
their Constitutions, so as to make them con
form to the great change thus effected in
the organic Jaw of the land; declared null
and void all ordinances and laws of seces
sion; repudiated all pretended debts and
obligations created for the revolutionary
purposes of the insurrection; and pro
ceeded, in, good faith, to the enactment of
measures fur the protection and ameliora
tion of the , condition of the colored race.
Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit
any of these States to representation ; and
it was not until towards the close f the
eighth month of the session' that an excep
tion was made in favor of Tennessee, by
the admission of her Senators and liepre
sontatives. , . . t ,-
I deem it a subject of profound regret
that Congress has thus far failed to admit
to seats loyal Senators and llepresentatives
from the other States, whose inhabitants, with
thone of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebel
lion. Ten States more than one-fourth
of the whole number remain without rep
resentation; the seat "of fifty members in
the House of representatives and- of twen
ty members in the Senate are vet varant
not by their own consent, not by a failure
of election but by the refusal of Congress
to accept their credentials. Their admis
sion, it is believed, would have accomplish
ed much towards the renewal and strength
ening of our relations as one people, and
removed serious cause for discontent on the
part of the inhabitants of those States. It
would have accorded with the great prin
ciple enunciated in the- .Declaration of
American Independence, that no people
ought to bear the burden of taxation, and
vet be denied the right -of representation,
tt would have been iu consonance with the
express provisions of the Constitution,
that "each State shall have at least one
Representative," and " that no State, with
out its consent, shall be deprived of its
equal suffrage in the Senate." These pro
visions were intended to secure to every
letate, and to the people of every State, the
right of representation ia each House of
Congress; and go important wa It deemed
by the framers of the Constitution that the
equality of the States in the Senate should
be preserved, that not even by an amend
ment of the Constitution can any State,
without its consent, be denied a voice in
that branch in the National Legislature.
lt"is true, it has been assumed that the
existence cf the States was terminated by
the rebellious acta of their inhabitants,
and that the insurrection having been sup
pressed, they were thenceforward to be
considered merely as conquered territories
The Legislative, Executive, and Judciial
Departments cf . the , Government have,
however, with ' great distinctness and uni
form consistency, refused to sanction an as
sumption so incompatible x with the nature
of our republican system, and with the
professed objects of war. Throughout the
recent legislation of Congress, the undeni
able fact makes itself apparent, that these
ten political communities are nothing less
thaq States of this Union. At the very
commencement of the rebelllion each
House declared with a unanimity as
remarkable as it was significant that the
war was not "waged, upon our part, in
any spirit of op'presion," nor for any pur
pose of conquest or subjugation, nr pur
pose of overthrowing or interfering with
the rights or. established institutions of
those States, but to defend and . maintain
the supremacy of the Constitution and all
laws made in pursuance thereof, and to
preserve the Union with all dignity, eqali
ty, and rights of the several States unim
paired; and that as soon as these objects"
were " accomplished the war ought to
cease," In some instances, Senators were
permitted to continue their legislative func
tions, while in other instances Representa
tives were elected and admitted to seats
after their States had formally declared
their right to withdraw from the Union,
and" were endeavoring to maintain that
right by force of arms. All of the States
whose people were in insurrection, as States,
were included in the apportionment of the
direct tax of twenty millions of dollars an
nually laid upon the United States by the
act approved 5th August, 1861. Congress,
by the act of March 4, 1862, and by the
apportionment of representation there
under, also recognized their presence as
States in the Union; and they have, for ju
dicial purposes, been divided into districts,
as States alone can be divided. The same
recognition appears in the recent legislation
in reference to Tennessee, which evidently
rests upon the fact that the functions of the
State were not destroyed by the rebellion,
but merely suspended, and that principle
is of course applicable to those States
which, like Tennessee, attempted to re
nounce their places in the Union.
The action of the Executive Department
of the Government upon this subject has
been equally definite and uniform, and the
purpose of the war was specifically etated
in the Proclamation issued by my prede
cessor on the 22d day of September, 1862,
It was then solemnly proclaimed and de
clared that "hereafter, as heretofore, the
war will be 'prosecuted, for. the object of
practically restoring; the constitutional re
lation between the United States and each
of the ,. States and the people -. thereof, in
which States that relation is or may be sus
pended or disturbed."
The recogaition of the States by the Ju
dicial Department of the Government has
also been clear and conclusive in all pro
ceedings affecting them as States, had in
the Supreme, Circuit, and .District Courts,
j In the admission of Senators and Repre
sentatives from any and all of the States,
there can be no just ground of apprehen
piun that persons who, are disloyal will be
clothed with the powers of legislation ; for
this could not happen when the Constitution
and laws are enforced by a vigilant and
faithful' Congress. Each House is made
the "judge of the eleotions, returns, and
qualifications of its own members," and
may, "with the concurrence of two-third,
expel a member." When a Senatorr
Representative presents his certificate of
election, he may be at once admitted or
rejected ; or, should there be any question
as to his eligibility, his credentials may be
referred for investigation to the appropriate
committee. - .If -admitted to a seat, it must
be upon evidence satisfactory to the House
of which he thus becomes a member, that
be possesses the requisite constitutional
and legal qualifications. If retused
admission f as a member for I want" of
due allegiance i to tlie; Guvtrnment,
and returned to his constituents, they are
admonished that none but persons loyal to
the United States will be allowed a voice in
the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and
the political power and moral infloenee of
Congresa are thus effectively exerted in the
interests of loyalty to the Government and
fidelity to the Union. Upon this question,
so vitally, effecting the restoration of the
Union and the permanency of our present
form of government, my convictions, here
tofore expressed, have undergone no change;
but, on the contrary," their correctness : has
been confirmed by reflection and time. "If
the admission of loyal members to seats- in
the respective Houses of Congress was wise
and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise
and expedient now. If this, anomalous
condition is right now if, in the exact con
dition of these States at the present time,
it is lawful to exclude them from represen
tation, I do not see that the question will
be changed by the efllux of time. Ten
years hence, , if , these States remain as (hey
are,, the right of j-epresonlatioh will - lie no
stronger the right of ftclusion will be no
Weaker.
i The Constitution of the United States makes
it the duty of the President to recommend to the
consideration of Congress "such mcttsnre &4 bo
shall judge neeeAary or expedient." I knowt.f
no measure more imperatively demanded by
every consideration of national interest, sound
nnlwif nnii Afinnl i i J t i n than fVta amljuifin , f
I loyal members from the now unrepresented
States. This would consummate the work of
restoration, and exert a most salutary influence
in the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and
fraternal felling. It would tend greatly to re
new the confidence of the American people in
the vhrorand stability of their institutions. It
would bind ns more closely together aa a nation,
and enable us to show to the world the inherent
and recuperative power of a Government found
ed upen the will of a people., and established
opon the principles of liberty, justice and intel
ligence Our increased strength and enhanced'
prosperity would irrefrapably. demonstrate the
iallacy oi the arruments against free institutions
drawn from our recent uation;il disorders by the
eneinii?s of republican irovernmei.it.' The ndmis
sion of loyal members from the States now ex
cluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and ap
prehension, would turn capita! now a waiting an
opportunity for investment, into the channels of
trade and industry. It would alleviate the pres
ent troubled condition of tacis State?, no, by
inducing emigration, aid in the settlement of
fertile regions now uncultivated, and lead to an
increased production of tbosestapleg which have
added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and
tbe commerce of the world. New fields of en
terprise would be opened to our progressive peo
ple, and goon the devastations of war woujd be
repaired, and alt traces of our domestic difler
ences effaced from the minds of our countrymen.
In our efforts to preserve "the unity of Gov
ernment which constitutes ns one people," by
restoring tho States to the condition which they
held prior to the rebellion, we should becau
tious, leat, having rescued our nation from per
ils of threatened disintegration, we resort to
consolidation, and in the end absolute despot
ism, as a remedy for recurrence of similar troub
les. The war having terminated, and with it
all occasion for the exercise of power of doubt
ful constitutionality, we should hasten to bring
legislation within the boundaries prescribed by
the Constitution, and to return to the ancient
landmarks established by our fathers for the gui
dance of succeeding generations. "The Consti
tution which at any time exists, until changed
by an explicit and authentic act of the whole
people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." "If, in
the opinion of the, people,, the distribution or
modification of the constitutional powers be, in
any particular, wrong, let it be corrected by an
amendment in the way in which the Constitu
tion designates. But let there be no usurpa
tion : for" "it is the customary weapon by which
free Goverements are destroyed.'' Washingtoa
spoke ' these words ' to his countrymen,
when followed by their love and gratitude,
he voluntarily retired -from the cam of public
life. "To keep In all things within tho
pale of our constitutional powers, and cherish
the Federal Union ns the only rook of safety,"
were prescribed by Jefferson as rales of action to
endear to his "countrymen thertrue principles of
ttieir Constitution, and promote a union ot sen
timent and action equally auspicious to their
happiness and safety." Jackson held that the
action of the General Government should always
bo strictly confined to the sphere of its appro
priate duties, and justly and forcibly urged that
our Gover&nent is not to be maintained nor our
Union preserved" by invasions of the rights and
powers of tbe several States. In thus attempt
ing to make our General Government strong, we
make it weak. Its true-.jtrength consists in leav
ing individuals and States as much as possible to
themselves : .in making - itself, felt, pot in its
Eower. but in its beneficence: not in its control,
ut in its protection : not in binding the States
more closely to the centre, but leaving each to
move unnoetieted in its urooer constitutional
orbit," These are the teachings of men whose
deeds and services hare made them illustrious
and who, long since withdrawn from the scenes
of li.'e, have left to their country the rich legacy
of their example, their wisdom, and their patri
otism. Drawing fresh inspiration from their les
sons, let us emulate them in love of country and
respect for the Constitution and the laws. ' r '
THE TREASURY.
i The report "f the Secretary of the Treasury
a fl'ord.-f much information respecting the revenue
and commerce or the country. Ilis .views upon
the currency, and with reference to proper ad
justment of our revenue system, internal as well
as impost, are commended to the careful con
sideration of Congress. In my last annual
message I expressed my general views upon
these subjects. I nred now only call attention
to tho necessity of carrying into every depart
ment of the government a system of rigid ac
countability, thorough retrenchment, and wise
economy. With i".xceptional nor unusual ex
penditures, the oirju-essive burdens of taxation
eau be lessened by such a modification of our
revenue laws as will be consistent with tho nub-
lie faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants
oi tnc government.
' The report represents a much more satisfac
tory condition of our finances than one year ago
the moft sanguine could have anticipated.
Iuring thefiscal year ending theSOth June, l'65,
the last year of the war. the public debt was in
creased SW41 ,902,537. and on th 31st of
October. lt. it amounted to $2.7W.KA.tW.
On the 31st day of October, 15G, it had been -reduced
to $iojlr"10,tKi(), the diminution, during a
period of fourteen inomhs, commencing Septem
ber 1, 105, and ending October Bl lio. having
been 2ui,37,J,.:S65. In the last annual report on
the state of the.finances, it . was estimatedthat
during the three quarters of the fiscal year end
ing the Siith of June last, tho debt would be in
creased $112,194,947. During that period, how
ever, it was reduced StJl.li'G.357, the receipts of
tne year navmg benn ?s;i,yoo.uuo more, and the
expenditures sax),oa),33o less than the estimates.
Nothing could more clearly indicate than these
statements the extent and. availability of the
national resources, and the rapidity and safety
with which, under our form of government, great
military and naval establishment can be dis
banuei, and expenses reduced trom a war to a
peace footing.

ISOo, the receipt were SooSjOiiOlitt, and ihe ex
penditures $,r), 750,540, leaving an available sur
plus of $37.2S1, 680. . It is estimated that the re
ceipts for the fiscal year euding the 30th June,
1Wi:T ..-; M 1... I.". 1 1 !
tures will reach the sum of $J16.42S.(J78. leaving
in the Treasury a surplus of . S15S,6;a,308. I'or
the fiscal year ending June iO. 1S68, it is estima
ted mat ttie receipts will amount to 4.V,U)0.UU0,
and that the expenditures will be i350.U47.H41
showing an excels of -50,752,359 in. favor of the
Government. These estimated receipts may be
diminished by a reduction of excise and import
duties: but after all necessary redactions shall
have been made, the revenue of the present and
of the following years will doubtless be sufficient
to cover all legitimate charges anon the Treasu
ry, and leave a large annual surplus to be applied
to the payment of the principal of tho debt.
There seems nw to be no good reason why taxes
may not be reduced aa the country advances in
population and wealth, and yet the debt be ex
tinguished within the next quarter ot a century,

The report of the Secretary of War furnishes
valuable and important information in reference
to the operations of his Department during the
piist year! Few volunteers- now remains in -tbe
service, and they are being discharged as rapid
ly as theyVan;be replaced by regular troops. The
army has been promptly paid, carefully provided
with medical treatment, well sheltered and sub
sisted, and is to be furnished with breech-loading
small arms. The military .rength of the nation
has been unimpaired by the discharge of volun
teers, the disposition of unservicable or perish
able stores, and tbe retrenchment of expend i-
tare.. ' Sufiicient war material to meet any emer
gency has been retained, and, from the disband
ed voluntetrrs standing ready to respond to tbe
national ''M. large armies can be rapidly organ
ied, ei tupped, and concentrated. Fortifications
on the coast and frontier have received, or are
being prepared for more powerful armaments;
lake surveys and harbor and river improvements
are in course of energetic prosecution. Prepara
tions have been made for the payment of the
additional bounties authorized during the recent
session ot congress, under such regulations
will protect the Government from fraud, and
secure to the honorably-discharged soldier the
well-earned reward of his faithfulness and pal
lantry. At ore than sixhhousand maimed soldiers
have received artificial limbs or other surgical
apparatus; aad lorry-one national cemeteries,
containing the remains of 104.526 Union soldiers.

fleet is at Jjeagae Island, in tbe vicinity of Phil
adelphia, a place which, until decisive action
should be takes by Congress, was selected by the
Secretary of the Navy as the most eligible loca
tion for that class of vessels. ;It is important
that a suitable public sla'ioa should be provided
for the iron-clad fleet , It is intended that these
vessels shall be in proper condition for any
eoiersreney. and it is desirable that the bill ac
cepting Leaeue Island for naval purposes, which
passed the House of Eepresentatives at its last
session, should receive final action at an early
period, in order that there may be a luitable pub
lic station for this class of vessel, as well as a
E&vy yard of area sufficient for the wants of

men, and tbe importance of legislative measures
for their relief and improvement. The sugges

are. earnestly recommended to the
favorable attention of Congresa.
f . ( ) ISTOf FICE DEPARTMENT. s '
The report of the Postmaster General
presents a most satisfactory condition of
tne postal service, ana submits recommen
dations which deserve the consideration of
Concrress. The revenues of the Department
for the! year Jending June 30, 1S66, were '
14,3S6,S8, and the expenditures 15,352,
079, showing an excess of the latter of
$965,03., ,Iri anticipation of this deficien
cy, nowever, a special appropriation was
made by tJongress in the act approved July
Zs, lebb. Including the standing appro
priation of S 1 00,000 for free mail matter.
as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet
remaining unexpended, the actual deficit
for the past year is only 265,093 a sum
within $51,141 of the amount estimated in
the annual report of lab A. : lhe decrease
jof revenue , compared , with ihe, .previous
year was one ana one-nun per cent., ana

length of one hundred and eighty thousand

creasing throughout the whole country, and
its steady extension in the Southern States
indicates their constantly improving con
dition. The growing importance of the
foreign service also ; merits attention. The
Postoffice Department of Great Britain and
eur own have agreed "upon a preliminary

The report of the Secretary of the Inte
rior exhibits; ' the ' condition . ot tnose
branches of the public service which Are
committed to his supervision. During the
last fiscal vea 4,629.312 acres . of public
laud were disLosod of, 1,892,516. acres tf
which were entered -under the homestead
ait. "The policy originally adopted relative
to the public lands bas undergone essential
modifications. Immediate revenue,- and
not their rapid settlement, was the cardinal
feature of our land system v Long experi
eiiceand earnest discussion have resulted
in the conviction that the early develop
ment of our agricultural resources, and the
diffusion of an energetic population over
importance to the national growth and
prosperity than' the proceeds of the sale 'of
the land to the highest bidder in open mar
ket, The pre-eUDption laws confer. upon'
the pioneer who complies -with the terms
they impose the privilege of purchasing a
limited portion of "unofiered lands" at the
minimunv price. - The1 homestead enact
ments relieve the settler from the payment
of purchase money, and secure him s per
manent home, upon the condition of resi
dence for a term of years. This liberal
policy invites emigration from the old, and
from the more crowded portions of the new
world..' Its propitious results are. undoubt
ed' and willi be more signally manifested
when time shall have given to it a wider
deyelopment..' . ..... ,; ,.. 'i . . ,
SCongTeas has made liberal frrants of public
land to corporations, in aid of the -construction
of railroads and other -internal improvements.
Should this policy hereafter' prevail, '- more
strinsrent provisions will be required to secure a
faithful application of the fund. The title to the
lands should not pass, by patent or -otherwise,
but remain in the government and subject to its
conJrol until some portion of the road has been
actually built. Portions of them might then,
from time to time, be conveyed to the corpora
tion, but never in a greater ratio to the whole
quantity embraced by the grant than the com
pleted parts bear to the entire length of the pro
jected improvement. This restriction weuld not
operate to the prejudice of any undertaking con
ceived in-good Caith aud executed with -reasonable
energy, as it is the settled practice to with
draw from market the lands falling within the
operation of such grants, and thus to exclude tb
irtoepticun'f suhseuueut adverse right. A breach
of! the ' condition which Conprress may deeni
proer to impose should work a forfeit of claim
to the lands no withdrawn bat an conveyed, and of
title t tae lands conveyed which remain unsold.

1 M - THE DISTRICT OF COXCMBIA, ; - rtl
j . The District of Columbia, i.dej existing
laws,', is not entitled to that representation
n the National Councils which, from our
earliest history, has been uniformly accord
ed to each Territory -established from time
to time within our limits.-It maintains
peculiar relations to Congress, to whom the
Constitution has granted the power of ex
ercising exclusive legislation over the seat
of government. Our fellow-citizens re-
sidrna -in the District, whose interestcare
thus confided to the special guardianship of
Congress, exceed in nnmber the population
of several of our Territories, and no just
reason is perceived why a delegate ot .their
choice should not be admitted .to a seat in
tbe House . of Representatives. I?o : mode
seems bo appropriate and effectual of ena
bling them to make known their peculiar
condition and wants, and of tecunog tne
local legislation adapted to them. I there
fore recommend the passage of a law author
izing the electors of the District of CQlunr
bia to- choose a delegate! to be allowed the
same -rights and privileges as a delegate
representing a Territory. , The increasing
enterprise and rapid progress of .improve
ment in .the Uistnot are highly graUiying,
and X trust the efforts of the municipal au
thorities to promote the prosperity of the
national metropolis will receive the efficient
and generous co-operation f Congress.

j In the month of. April last, as . Congress
13 aware, a friendly arrangement was made
between the Emperor of France and the
President af the United States for the with
drawal from Mexico of the French expedi-
tiimaij mmiaijiuii:cs. . .11X13 wtuiurawal
was to be efiected in three detaclunenU,
the firt of which, it was understood, word J
leave Mexico in November, now. past, -the
second in March next,' and the third, and
last in November, 1867. , Immediately npi
on the completion,- of the evacuation,; the
i renchCrovernmentwas to assume the same
attitude of non-intervention, in ,'regard Jto
Mexico, as is held by' the. Government of
the United States. Repeated .assurances
have been given by the Emperor, since that
agreement, that-he . woald-cornplete the
promised evacuation . within the . period
mentioned, r sooner.' " .
; It was reasonably expected that the pro
ceedings thus contemplated would produce
a crisis of great political interest .ia the
Republic of Mexico, The newly-appointed
Minister of the United Slates, Mr. Camp-j
bell, was therefore sent forward, on tLa Sih
day of Jipvember last, to assume1 hia pro-;
per functions as Minister; Plenipotentiary
of the United States to that Republic. It j
was also thought expedient that he' should
be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by,
the lieutenant Generate! the Army of the!
tinted States, wita tne view of ccHuun
iach information M might ipcHant to
uj uie wuiteu otates in re-wsauusning ana
maintaining necessary and proper inter
course with the Republic of Mexico. Deep-'
ly Interested in the cause 'of liberty ' and"
humanity, it seemed an obvions duty on
our part to exercise whatever influence we'
possessed for the restoration and permanent
establishment in that country of a domestic"
and Republican funi of Government
fcucn was the condition of attain! in re
gard to Mexico, whenj on the 22d ef No
vember last, official information was re
ceived from Paris that the Emperor of.
France had some time before decided not
to withdraw a detachment of his forces in :
the month of November past, according to
engagement, but that this decision was
made with the purpose of wtihdrawing the
whole of those ' forces in . the ensuing
spring. . Of this (Jctermination. however,
i . IT. '. in,. i s .
tne uniiea otates-naa ncs received any
notice or intimation; and, so soon as tha.,
information . was received by the Govern
ment, care was taken to make known ' its
dissent to the Emperor of' France. . , '

tun ot tne Incited fetates. The patters reialtoc
to the subject will te laid Janfore yon. It iebeH
lieved that with the. evacuation of Mexico by
the expeditionary irce, bo uhjwt for serious
dulcrenees between traoeeaiil tbe touted btatee -would
remain. The expressions of taeKiatxM-or

A - claim of a citizen of the United 5tates for
indemnity for ppoli&tion committed on tbe hisrh
seas by the r reach autaoriues, ia the exercise
of a belligerent power nrsin-t Mexico, has been
met by the Government of France with a propo
sition to defer settlement until a mutual cwnveit- .
lion for the adjustment of all claims of cilifens
and subjects of both countries, arising out of the
recent wars on this continent, Khali be arreed
upon by the two countries. -' The suggestion is
not deemed unreasonable, but it belong to Con f
Jtress to direct the manner in which eloims for
indemnity by foreigners, as well as hy citizans of
the United States, arising out of the late civil '
war, shall be adjudicated and determined.
