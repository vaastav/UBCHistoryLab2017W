BUNDINS SNOW STORM
SWEEPS EASTERN STATES
Sam Smith, of the Empire Grocery,
on South Scraper street, was waken
ed by the phone last night, a little after
midnight, and was informed that the
store had been broken into. When he
got to the store, he found that Will
Baxley, the mechant's police, had
found William Kingle, the cobbler, in
the store, and had shot him to prevent
his escape. Kingle was not seriously
injured, however, and was placed un
der arrest this afternoon.
According to Watchman Baxley's
story, he came out of the alley back
of Sanders-Wright's and saw a light in
the grocery store, and some one in
there, moving around. As Baxley went
over towards the store, the "man
crouched, and tried to escape observa
tion. At the back door of the store,
Baxley met Kingle, just coming out.
Kingle said he had found the store
door open, and gone in to see if there
' was anything missing. Baxley made
Kingle go with nim to Charlie Farm
er's rooms, near by on South Scraper,
ana the three men returned to the
store. Baxley kept Kingle covered with
a revolver while Farmer, who is one
of the Empire clarks, hunted for evi
dences of robbery. Baxley said Kingle
was plainly uneasy, and when Farmer
started to examine the cash register
Kingle jumped for the door.
Baxley "followed him into the street,
commanding him to" stop, and threaten
ing to shoot, while Kingle peeled.off
his coat, threatening to fight, and back
ed up to the door of his little shoe
shop, on Illinois avenue, when he got
opposite the shop door, he made a
plunge for it, shouting to Baxley, "I'll
fix you now." Baxley feared that he
meant to come ou with a gun, and
fired. Kingle screamed, and dropped
inside' the shop.
Fearing that he had killed Kingle,
Baxley came back down the street, and
got Assistant Marshal Perry and John
Britt to go up to the shop and see.
They found Kingle conscious and de
cidedly mad. They took him to his
home on South Foreman street. Dr.
Louis Bagby was called, and found
that the wound was not a serious one.
The bullet had entered under the arm
and come out of the breast, apparently
missing the lung in its course.
The county physician made an ex
amination this afternoon and recom
mended that Kingle be not moved for
a few days. A guard was placed over
his until he is able to be transferred.
This morning a warrant was sworn
out against Kingle for breaking and
entering.
Kingle has been suspected for some
time of having a hand in the recent
robberies here in town. Baxley found
him in the alley back of Sanders
Wright's store about three o'clock one
morning about a week ago. .

New York, Dec. 6. A blizzard swept
the Atlantic seaboard and the lower
lake region today. The temperature
was twelve degrees above zero at Can
ton, N. Y. The storm centered on the
lower Chespeake Bay. Rain and sleet
fell over all the coast states, from Vir
ginia north. A high nertheastern ar-
roused the Atlantic waves. Four ocean
steamers, which crept into this port to
day, had to anchor tin the lower bay
because of the blinding snow. Ship
ping sticks to port for better weather.

Washington, D. C, Dec. 6. Congress
gave respectful attention to President
Taft's message today but there were
comparatively no members willing to
concede the probability of favorable
action at the present session, on many
of the recommendations contained
therein, because of the fact that the
session closes March 4. ,

Regarding the Panama canal the
president says:
'The progress of the work is most
satisfactory. It will be completed well
within the time set, January 1, 1915,
and within the estimated cost of $375,

Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 6. The ex
pected sensation in today's session at
the trial of Hattie LeBlanc. the French
Canadian girl, charged with the mur
der of Clarence F. Glover, a Watham
laundryman, was delayed because of
the late arrival of the train, from Prov
inces, on which Zella Gallint, an im
portant government witness, was a
passenger. Miss uainnt was lormer
lv a nurse in the Wltham hospital, and
acted as interpreter the night Miss
LeBlanc, was questioned at the Wal
tham police station, after her arrest
for Glover's murder. Miss Gallint was
at home on Prince Edward's Island,
and at first declined to return to Mas
sachusetts.
One witness, G. L. McCall, superin
tendent of the laundry owned by Glo

der he found Glover's cap in a basket
in the passage way. He also found a
comb and pin, which it is alleged be
longed to the defendant.

A GANG OF CRIMINALS
It was bootleggers day in the county
court today. Jasper Curry, a negro,
from Centralia, was placed on trial
this morning. The prosecuting wit
ness sworn to purchasing the liquor

Tulsa, Okla., Dec. 6. Tulsa is m
the hands of a gang of criminals'
against which" the police are unable
to cope. Within the last two weeks
men have been knocked down, brutally
beaten and robbed within a block of
Main street and in the glare of street
lamps and stores and residences have
been piilaged almost at will. The lat
est robberies were reported Monday.
Some time Sunday night robbers en
tered the Mayo furniture house and
secured $400 in cash. The Mammoth
Credit company's store was robbed of
furs and women's clothing valued at
$500 and revolvers and ammunition
valued at $300 was taken from Mc
Clure's hardware store. ,
Citizens of Tulsa are up in arms be
cause of inadequate police protection
and have called upon the mayor and
commissioners to enhance the effi
ciency of the department. It is be
lieved that the same gang has com
mitted all the robberies and the citi
zens are demanding that they be driven
from the city. They hold that neither
life nor property is safe.

message, sent to congress today, are
these:
He declares it is time to stop legis
lating, with reference tq regulation of
corporations and to witness the effect
of a vigorous execution of the laws
already on the statute books. The
exact limitation upon business meth
ods imposed by law will doubtless be
made clearer by pending decisions of
the supreme court.
Just at this time, the president says,
he believes the activities or the gov
ernment in addition to enforcement of
the laws, should be directed toward
economy of administration on the en
largement of opportunities for foreign
trade, the building up of home indus
trv and the strengthening the confi
dence of capital in domestic invest
ment.
Mr. Taft recommends strongly some
form of ship subsidy to increase Amer
ican shiDDing. especially to South
America.
The tariff board is not ready to sub
mit a report on any of the schedules
of the Payne law, and Mr. Taft says
he will not recommend any tariff leg
islation until the new congress con
venes in December, 1911.
He urges that the tariff board be
made permanent and that all future re
visions be made schedule by schedule.
He vigorously opposes another general
revision.
The Panama canal should be forti
fled. An appropriation of $19,000,000
is recommended ror mis purpose.
There must be no more "pork bar
rel" methods in river and harbor and
public building bills. The latter should
be based upon the report of a commis
sion of experts. In the past congress
has appropriated too much for build
ings not needed and not enough for
buildings badly needed.
Recommendation for anti-injunction
and federal incorporation laws are renewed.
It is proposed that second class mail
rates shall be readjusted so as to
charge magazines a much higher rate
on their advertising sections.
Strong representations are made for
the establishment of a new banking
and currency system.
Two new battleships and several
auxiliary vessels are urged for the
navy.
The president recommends that coal
phosphate and oil lands and water
power sit.es be disposed of in the fu
ture by leasing.
Estimates for government expendi
tures during the next fiscal year have
been cut to $630,494,013.12, which is
$52,964,887.36 less than the actual ap
propriations for the current year. The
estimated receipts for the next fiscal
year are $680,000,000.
The president urges the extension
nf thp rivil service nrincinle to the
j diplomatic and consular corps and the
'acquisition by the government of resi-
'dences and offices for its diplomatic
offices.

act are just, says the president, but

not exceed $1 per net ton. The presl
dent should be authorized to adjust

ernment should include In its manage
ment of the canal, the furnishing not

well, dry docks, repair facilities, and
the sale of coal, oil and other ship
supplies.
Interstate railroads should be pre
sented from owning or controlling
ships trading through the canal
. Regarding the courts the president
declares the crying need of the Unit
ed States is cheapening the cost of lit
igation by simplifying Judicial pro-
ceedure and expediting final judgment.
The supreme court should be relieved
from unnecessary appeals. The salaries
of federal judges should be increased.
Postal savings banks will be estab
lished In a number of cities January
1. A parcels post on rural delivery
routes is recommended. Postmaster
General Hitchcock is given high praise
for putting the post office department
on a self-sustaining basis. The ex
tension of the civil service to include
all classes of postmasters and thus
taking these officials entirely out of
politics is urged.
The president recommends congress
to give some fitting recognition to the
Polar discoveries of Commander Rob
ert E. Peary. The secretary of the
navy suggests that Peary be made
rear admiral and placed on the re
tired list.
The stupendous value of the agri

prospect for business throughout the
country.

A bureau of health should be es
tablished.
The Southern Pacific railroad should
be reimbursed for its expenditures in
fighting the flood in the Imperial val
ley of California several- years ago.
Heavier fines should be imposed
against steamship companies for vio
lating the immigration laws. The fa
cilities at Ellis Island, New York,
should not be so increased as to offer
an inducement to steamship companies
to concentrate their inimigrant busi
ness at one port. Immigrants are need
ed in the rural districts.
Some provision, should be made for
retiring superannuated government
clerks.
The only amendments suggested in
the interstate commerce law are an
appropriation to enable the interstate
commerce commission to ascertain the
valuation of railroads and fixing the
resDonsibilities of public carriers in
the issuance of bills of lading.
Talented Reader Declares Her Inten
tion to Plant Norwegian Writer
In Hearts of Americans.
The Kansas City Star in its issue of
November 13th, published the follow
in g account cf an interview with
Madame Labadie, who is to read
Ibsen's "Doll's House," at the Audi
torium Friday evening:
"Here in America, I am bound to
plant Ibsen in the hearts of the Amer
ican people," Madame Labadie says
"I know I can do it and I will do it
The world owes a debt to the Nor-
Madame Labadie
wegian dramatist. It owes a debt of
uplift, for the struggles he went
through to give his teachings to the
world, for the lessons he taught."
Madame Labadie was at the Hotel
Baltimore this morning. As she talk
ed, she told of Ibsen, his life, his pur
poses and his morals. And she also
told some of the false beliefs about the
dramatist who has been called every
thing from morbid to funereal.
That's just where the world makes
its mistake," Madame i.auauie said.
Ibsen's works are not morbid-, nor are
they set forth as gloomy characteriza
tions solely for the sake of gloominess.
Every drama he wrote was written
with a purpose. He had no hope of
selling them when he began his work.
It only was after he had written and
written that he began to feel a desire
within him to see his works on the
stage.
"Ibsen's purpose? Simply this, to
set out the sorrow of the world and to
give a warning. Shortly before he
died, he wrote a letter in which he
said he believed the emancipation of
the world would come through woman.
Then, if It was to come through wo
man, it must come through mother
hood. And there you are.
"Do you know why many persons do
not like Ibsen?" Madame Labadie ask
ed suddenly; "do you know why they
put up the excuse that it is gloomy
and morbid? Simply because Ibsen
painted life and painted it in colors
that no one could mistake, and per
sons do not like to be reminded too
stronelv of their own faults. As for
the gloominess, that isn't so. Take,

Oklahoma City, Okla., Dec. 6.
There is a good chance now that the
house capital committee may recede
from its attitude favoring the Putnam
site plan and will recommend the adop
tion of the resolution passed by the
senate letting a legislative committee
from each house choose the site. Such
a compromise may be forced by the at
titude of the senate, which still refuses
even to report on the house capital
bill until some site more accessible
than Putnam can be offered by Okla
homa City or at least until the back
ers of the Putnam- proposition agree
to give bond guaranteeing a free cap-
itol building and sit to the state.
Oklahoma Citj people now are work
ing on two new sites. One Is section
16, comprising state school land to
which they propose to add 400 acres
with a guarantee of a $1,000,000 cap
itol building, and the other is the Cul-
bertson proposition comprising land
adjoining the residence section on the
northeast with conditions equally fav
orable to the state. ' If one of these
propositions can be procured the Put
nam site, probably will be ditched In
the senate, and if neither can be ar
ranged the senate is inclined to require
the Putnam site to be backed with a
guarantee and to eliminate the emer
gency section from the site feature of
the bill giving the people a chance to
reject or accept the site at the polls.
Each house passed one bill Monday
and then adjourned until 2 o'clock this
afternoon to give committees an op
portunity to' find some solution to the
deadlock.
In the house, Speaker Anthony
called the attention of the bouse to
an article in a St. Joseph newspaper
which stated that the house and sen
ate had taken a slap at William J,
Bryan, the house by hanging a map
of the Putnam site over Bryan's pic
ture and the senate by not hanging
Bryan's portrait at all. Anthony stated
that the house should resent such a
story. Bill Durant," another Haskell
organization man, moved that the As
sociated Press man be barred from the
floor of the bouse unless he retracted
the article by today.
Charles Barrett of Shawnee declared
that the adverse newspaper criticism
of the state was due largely to the
attitude of enmity to the newspaper
men shown by certain leading mem
bers of the constitutional convention
and First legislature and advised cau
tion in incurring enmity of the press
at this time. - J. Roy Williams of.
Comanche also defended the press and
offered a resolution which was adopt
ed, providing that the house appoint a
committee to investigate the truth of
the article mentioned and report to
the house. - '
The senate yesterday finally passed
the Cornell bill from the house giving
the supreme court-original and exclu
sive jurisdiction to hear all suit3 aris
ing for the removal or location of the
state capital or' any educational or
eleemosynary institution. The pur
pose of the act is to eliminate the dis
trict courts in the determination of
such actions and it is aimed particu
larly at the district court Of Logan
county, which enjoined the removal of
the state capital to Oklahoma City. As
the bill passed the house no one ex
pected the attorney general could have
