THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
PreaMent Uooaerelt's meaaaga is a
aaoat reaMrkabte document. A care
ful reaolac of the aeaaase
that erery word of It waa penned by
the Praafdant It Is doubtful If there
baa beea a aeaaaa submitted to
tot naay years that did not
coataia certala portloae written b?
aibers of the Cabinet- This was
especially true is racoraraoadatloHB
rooceraiag the varioas department'!,
la the past the message of the President
has gone somewhat into detail la
describing; the special work of each
department sad Its needs, before Congress.
President Roosevelt's message
presents a new departure in this
In commenting upon the needs
of the Navy reference is made to tho
report of the Secretary of the Navy as
to the number and elass of new ships
recommended, bat with this exception
all maters treated of in the message
are treated of from the broad ground
of the chief, administrative officer Jf
the nation. Congress is loft to the reports
of the various department heads
for details of the work of the departments.
On the subject of trusts tho President
takes no uncertain stand. He
declares that publicity of tho
of great combinations of capital
Is as necessary as is publicity in
the management of banks. Such results
cannot be brought about by
s State legislation and it thorofore becomes
a subject for national legislation.
Strict laws for the dealing with
anarchists must be enacted, gays the
PceaMaoL and If such laws cannot be
paasod under the Constitution as it
noV stands then he would have a Constitutional
amendment which would
permit of their passage.
Five subjects in the message arc of
special importance to Hawaii. First
Is his attitude upon Chinese Immigration.
There Is no hesitation or
equivocation upon the subject of Chinese
Immigration by tho President.
He says most directly and pointedly
that the Exclusion Act should be re-enacted,
and not only that, but the
act should be strengthened in every
way possible.
Referring directly to Hawaii ho says
American conditions must be fostered.
So important to this Torritory
are his words concerning Hawaii that
It is well to repoat them hero:
i In Hawaii our aim must be to de
V vclop the Territory on the traditional
American lines. We do not wish a
region of large estates tilled by cheap
labor; we wish a healthy American
community of men, who themselves
till the farms they own. All our legislation
for the Islands should be shaped
with' this end In view; the well being
of the average home-maker must
the true test of the healthy
of the islands. The land
policy should, as nearly as possible,
be modeled on our homestead system.
The importance of a Pacific cable
is especially emphasized and Congress
Is urgod to pass a cable bill at the
earliest possible moment.
Nut less in importance is the building
of the Nicaragua Canal, which is
earnestly urged as one or tho groat
national necessities of tho day.
Reciprocity with Cuba is especially
recommended, not merely as a trade
beaofit, but as a duty which tho
Ualtod Statos is morally bound to per
form
All of these matters are of tho utm st
Importance to Hawaii. Othor subjects
concern us indirectly, especially
the butldtag of a powerful navy, but
these fireMouca every interest of Hawaii
dteeetiv.
All ia all the message is a most
powerfel document. It is forceful, direct
and "plain spoken. It carries with
it the Impression of the author; It
brosth.es his indomitable spirit, and !t
shows that force of character which
wfl Jeava tho impress of the President's
course upon the world.

cost of building American ships is
greater than is the case abroad; that

It is a pleasure to say that It is

The Island is thriving as never
before, and it is being administered
efficiently aud honestly. Its people
aro now enjoying liberty and order
under the protection of the United
States and upon this fact we congratulate
them and ourselves.
Urges Reciprocity With Cuba.
In Cuba such progress has been
made toward putting the independent
government of the island upon a firm
footing that before the present session
of the Congress closes this will
be an accomplished facL Cuba will
then start as her own mistress; and
to the beautiful Queen of tho Antilles
as she unfolds this now page of her
destiny, we extend our heartiest
greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere
I have discussed the question
of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba,
however, there are weighty reasons
of morality nnd of national interest
why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar application, and I most ear
nestly ask your attention to the wis
dom, Indeed to the vital need of, pro
viding for a substantial reduction In
the tariff duties on Cuban Imports in
to the United States. Cuba has in
hor constitution affirmed what we desired,
that she should stand. In international
matters, in closer and
more friendly relations with us than
with any other power; and" we are
bound by every consideration tof honor
and expediency to pass commercla,
measures In the interest of her ma
terial well-being.
"
Problem in the Philippines.
In the Philippines our problem is
larger. They are very rich tropical
islands. Inhabited by many varying
tribes, representing widely different
stages of progress toward civilization.
Our earnest effort is to help these
people upward Elong the stony and
difficult path that leads to self-government.
We hope to make our ad
ministration of the islands honorable
to our nation bv making it of thB
highest benefit to the Filipinos them
selves; and as an earnest of what
we intend to do, we point to what we
have done. Already a greater mas
uro of material prrsprlty and of gov
ernmental honestv and efficiency ha"
been attained in the Phll'ppines tbar
lWor '
We are extremely anxious that the
natives shall show the "power of governing
themselves. We are anxious fir
ernlng themselves. We are anxious
firrt for their sakos, and next because
It Tclleves us of a great burden. There
need not be the slightst fear of our
not continuing to give them all the
liberty for which- thev are fit.
The only fear Is lest in our
we give thm a degree of n
dependence for hy ?,i"
thereby inviting reaction and disaster
There are still troubles ahead In the
Islands. Thrt insurrection has become
an affair of local banditti and maraud
ers. who deseire no h'gher regard
than the brigands of nort'ons of the
Old World. Encouragement direct or
indirect, to these Insurrectos stands
on the same footing as an encouragement
to hostile Indians in the days
whan we still had Indlaa wars- Exactly
as our aim is to glvo to the Indian
who remains peaceful the fullest and,
amplest cnslderat'on. but to have it

thing in our power for the Filipino

est measures with the Filipino who
follows the path of the insnrrecto and
the ladrone.
The time has come when there
Mould be additional legislation for
the Philippines.
OnYINS KE:D OF A
PACIFIC CABLE
I call yoar attention most earnestly
tc the crying need of a cable to Hawaii
and the Philippines, to be con
tinued from the Philippines to points
in Asia. We should not defer a day
ionger than necessary the construction
of such a cable. It is demanded, not
merely for commercial, but for political
and military considerations.
Either Congress should immediately
pn vide for the construction of a Government
cable or else an arrangement
should be mEde by which like advan
tages to those accruing from a Gov
ernment cable may be secured to the
Government by contract with a private
cable company.
W:ULD HURRY WORK
ON ISTHMIAN CANAL
No single great material work wh'ch
remains to be undertaken on this continent
is of such consequence to the
American people as the building cf a
cEnal across the isthmus connectiong
North and South America. Its importance
to the nation is by no means
limited merely to its material effects
upon our business prosperity; and yet.
with view to these facts alone, it
would be to the last degree important
f r us Immediately to begin iL While
its beneficial effects would perhaps
be most marked upon the Pacific
Coast and the Gulf and South Atlantic
States, it would also greatly benefit
other sections. It is emphatically a
work which it is for the interest of
the entire country to begin and complete
as soon as possible; it is one of
great works which only a great nation
can undertake with prospects of success,
and which, when done, are not
rnly permanent assets in the nation's
material interests, but standing monuments
to its constructive ability.
I am glad to be able to announce
ti ydu that our negotiations on this
subject with Great Britain, conducted
on both sides in a spirit of friendliness
and mutual good will and respect,
have resulted in mv be'ng ablp to lav
berore the Senate a treaty which, If
ratified, will enable us to begin preparations
for an isthmian canal at
any time, and which guarantees to
this nation every right that it has ever
asked in connection w'th the canal.
In this treaty the old er
treaty, so long recognized as Inadequate
to supply the base for the construction
and maintenance of a necessarily
American ship canal, is abrogated.
It specifically provides that the
United States alone shall do the work
of building and assume the
of safeguarding the canal, and
shall regulate Its neutral use bv all
nations on terms of equality without
the guaranty cr interference of any
outside nation from any quarter. The
signed treaty will at once be laid before
the Senate, and if approved the
Congress can then proceed to give effect
to the advantages It secures us
by providing for the building of the
canal.
Monroe Doctrine Reaffirmed.
The Monroe Doctrine should be the
cardinal feature of the foreign policy
of all the nations of the two Americas,
as It is of the United States. Just
seventy-eight years have passed since!
President Monroe in his annual
sages announced that "the American!
continents are henceforth not to be
considered as subjects for future colonization
by any European power."
in other words, the Monroe Doctrine
is a declaration that there must be no
territorial aggrandizement by any
power at tho expense of
any American power on American
soil. It is in no wise intended as hostile
to any nation in the old world.
Still less Is it intended to give cover
to any aggression by one new world
power at the expense of any other.
It is simply a step, and a long step,
toward assuring the universal peace
of the world by securing the possibility
of permanent peace on this continent.
Build a Great Navy.
The work of upbuilding the Navy
must bo steadily continued. No one
point of our policy, foreign or domestic,
is more important than this to the
honor and material welfare, and above
all to the peace of our nation in the
future. Whether we desire It or not,
we must henceforth Tecognlze that we
have international duties no less than
j international rights, ven if our flag
nrro lmnlprl ilnwn In thf Phllinnines
and Porto Rico, even if we decided
not to build the Isthmian canal, we
should need a thoroughly trained navy
of adequate size, or else be prepared
to abandon the Idea that our nation
is among those whose sons go down
to the sea in ships. Unless our com
merce is always to be carried in foreign
bottoms, we must have war craft
to protect it
Inasmuch, however, as the American
people nave no thought of abandoning
the oath upon which thev have
j entered, and especially In view of the
tact that the building of the isthmian
Canal is fast becoming one of the matters
which the whole people are united
In demanding, it is imperative that
our Navy should be put and kept In
tha highest state of efficiency, and
.hould be made to answer our growing-
needs. So far fiom being In any
way a provocation to wax, an adequate
and highly trained navy 4s the best
guaranty against war, the cheapest
and most effective peace insurance.
There should be no cessation In the
worjt 'of completing our navyi So
far isgecoity has been wholly enable
to devise a substitute for the great
war craft whose hammering 'guns bent
out the mastery of the sea-3. It Is unsafe
and unwise not to provide this
year for several additional battle
ships, and heavy armored cruisers,
with, auxiliary and lighter craft in
proportion; for the exact number and
character I refer yon to the report
of the Secretary of the Navy. But
there is something we need even more
than, additional ships, and this is additional
officers and men. To provide
battleships and cruisers and then lay
them up. with, the expectation of leaving
them unmanned nntll they are
needed in actual war, would be worse
than folly; it would be a crime against
the nation.
To send any war ship against a.
competent enemy unless those aboard
it have been trained by years of actual
sea service, including incessant
gunnery practice, would be to Invite
not merely disaster, but the bitterest
shame and humiliation. Four thousand
additional seamen and one thousand
additional marines should be
provided; and an Increase in the officers
should be provided by making a
large addition to the classes at Annapolis.
There is one small matter
which should be mentioned in connection
with Annapolis. The pretentious
and unmeaning title of "naval cadet"
should be abolished; the tilte of
full of historic association,
should be restored.
The American people must either
build and maintain an adequate navy
or else make up their minds definitely
to accept a secondary position In international
affairs, not merely In political,
but in commercial matters, it
has been well said that there is no
surer way of courting national disaster
than to be "opulent, aggressive
and unarmed."
Extend Civil Service.
I recommend the passage of a law
which will extend the classified service
to the District of Columbia, or
will at least enable the President thus
to extend it In my judgment all laws
providing for the temporary employment
pf clerks should hereafter contain
a provision that they b8 selected
under the Civil Service law.
It is important to have this system
obtain at home, but It Is even more
Important to have it applied rigidly in
our insular possessions. Not an office
should be filled in the Philippines or
Porto Rico with any regard to the
man's partisan affiliations or services;
with anv recard to the nolitirnl
cial cr personal influence "which he
may have at his command; in short,
heed should be paid to absolutely
nothing save the man's own character
and capacity and the needs of the service

in bringing about an adjustment which
tends to enhance the welfare of China
and to lead to a more beneficial intercourse

At Peace With the World.
The death of Queen Victoria caused
the people of the UnitoU States
deep and heartfelt sorrow, tn vcIWpTi
the Government gave full expression.
When President McKin'ey died, our
nation in truth rece'ved from every
quarter of- the British empire express
sions of grief and sympathy no less
sincere. The death of the Empress
Dowager Frederick of Germanv also
aroused the genuine sympathy of th
American people; and this sympathy
was cordltlly reciprocated by
when the President was assassinated.
Indeed, from every quarter
of the civilized wrld we received at
the time of the President's death assurances
of yich grief and regard as
to touch the heart of our people In
the midst of
our affection we reverently
thank the Almightv that we are at

THEBISHOP WARNS HIS PEOPLE
THAT THERE ARE BIG
BREAKERS AHEAD-
Members cf Second Congregation
Branded ac Irresponsible Persons
St Clements Chapel Included
Another Session To Be Held.
The Sixth Diocesan Syncd of the
Anglican Church In Hawaii did, not
close its sessions last night. as, had
been expected. It was "adoption of
resolutions' night, but few of the
nffprwd mado anv headwav.
The first Incident of the afternoon
' session came up when Testa remarked
j that there was a report on the table
, wntcn naa not oeen aciea upuu.
It was the report of the committee
t appointed to Investigate the affair ol
! the parsonage of St ' Augustine's
Church at Kohala in which the trus
tees of that churcn were severely censured.
A lively argument followed the reading
of the repott The Rev. Mr.
Thompkins objected to its severity
and thought that the words
ought to be omitted.
The Rev. A. Mackintosh suggested
that it be referred back to the committee
for further consideration; although
he was not familiar with the
merits of the case, he thought, as far
as he could judge from the reading of
it, that it was altogether too severe.
He objected to the committee
j ing to themselves very great powers.
Mr. Testa defended his report.
The Rev. Mr. Mackintosh arose as
if to say something but was abruptly
cut short by the Bishop who adjourned
the meeting until 7:45 p. m.
At the reopening of the Synod at
7:45 p. m., the atmosphere was somewhat
heavy. ,The Bishop opened the
fight with the reading of an address,
f in which he paid his respects to the
members of St Clement's Chapel anl
of the Second Congregation. He said
in part:
"Before the session closes and the
members of the Synod are scattered,
it will be the wisdom of the Synod
to take soundings of the course which
the P. E. Church in the Hawaiian Islands
is about to take. The position
that confronts you Is a most serious
one. ,
"I hold In my hand the evidence of
the sunken rocks towards which you
are about to direct your course. That
evidence consists of a memorial presented
by a member of the Synod
without any authority from the Synod
"I now ask the Synod to look forward
a little and consider what the
course of events will be, if the warning
note I am uttering passes unheeded.
In three months' time the See of
Honolulu will be vacant You may
then expect that the president of the
standing committee will receive a letter
from the pres'dlng bishop in the
U. S. inquiring whether the congregation
is ready to pay half the stipend
of the bishop according to a guarantee
expressed In a memorial from
members of the church in Hawaii, and
conveyed from Honolulu bj a member
of this Synod; I need not picture
to you the dilemma in which the
standing committee will be placed.
"If no guarantee has been given,
then not only the standing committee
but the whole church in Hawaii will
fall under the reproval of having allowed
the General Convention to be
deceived by a memorial from irresponsible
persons, the worthlessness cf
which they had no means of discovering."
The reading of the address called
forth a heated argument.
W. R. Castle. Jr.. wanted tn em
phasize that the memorial was nott
made either at the suggestion of the!
Rev. John Usborne or the
tion of St Clement's chapel, or of the I
Second Congregation. It was from'
individual members of the church belonging
to several congregations.
A long argument then took place
about the alleged guarantee that $1500
a year for a period of five years
would be forthcoming to help pay the
expenses o' the church. The Bishop
wanted to know who guaranteed
the money and E. G. Keen, George
and T. Clive Davles said that it was
none of the Synod's business. They
were iree to suoscribe when and to
whom they pleased. The Synod .had
nothing to say In the matter. Finally,
T. Clive Davles closed the argument
by reading some twenty names
of people who had subscribed sums
of mone ranging from $20 to ?200.
the total amount being $1500.
The election of officers for the board
of directors was then In order.
Messrs. Kitcat, Auld. Smith, Stiles,
W. it Castle, N. S. Meheula and L.
Arslu were elected members of the
board of directors. The Synod then
adjourned until 5 o'clock this,
Card of Thanks.
The executive committee of the
luau and fair held November 30th. at
the drill shed, wish to thank all ladies
and gentlemen who kindly assisted
to make the affair a success; also
the pre33 for use of their valuable
columns and the support given by a
generous public.
