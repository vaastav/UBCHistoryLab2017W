SHIP SUBSIDY BILL
A New Measure Framed by Senator
Frya
ITRODUCED II TE SEATE TOD
Some of the Differences From
the Bill of Last Year.
NEW RATES FOR MAIL
A new ship subsidy bill was introduced in
the Senate today. This bill was framed by
Senator Frye during the recess of Congress
in order to make it more nearly conform
to the views expressed in the last session of
Congress by senators who favored some
measure to accomplish the purpose sought
by his bill, but who were not willing to
vote for it in its form at that time. It dif
fers radically from the ship subsidy bill of
the last two sessions of Congress. It is
much shorter and simpler and is divided
into four titles, fifteen sections-in all about
2,700 words.
Some of the Difereaces.
The Frye bill does not prqvide American
registry for foreign ships owned by Ameri
cans.
It makes no distinction between fast and
slow steamers, except as the former may
obtain mail contracts under the act of
1891.
It contains no specific requirement for ex
port cargo, on the grounds that it would be
a violation or attempted evasion of our
treaties, and, further, is unnecessary be
cause the subsidy rate is so low that ample
export cargo must be carried in order to
escape loss.
The first title, "Ocean Mail Steamships,"
is devoted to amendments to the ocean mail
act of 1891. Under tne bill the Postmaster
General is required to consider the national
defense and the maritime interests of the
United States, as weh as postal interests,
in providing for the transportation of
American ocean mails. The purpose of this
amendment is to free the United States
from dependence upon British, German and
French auxiliary cruisers for its ocean mail
service, and to substitute a purely Ameri
can system.
The present limit of ocean mail contracts,
ten years, is increased to fifteen years. to
correspond with the limit of the recent Ger
man and French contracts.
The present obsolete and unscientific
classification of mail steamprs provides only
four classes-20-knot steamers of 8,000
tons, 16-knot steamers of 5,000 tons, 14-knot
steamers of 2,500 tons and 12-knot wooden
steamers of 1,.500 tons. The Frye bill pro
vides seven distinct classes and is based
on the progress of ship building and mail
requirements abroad during the past ten
years.
Changes In Rates of Mail Pay.
Corresponding with the new classification
in vessels are changes in the rates of mail
pay. The present rates, $4, $2, 31 and 67
cents, were fixed by the House of Represen
tatives in 1891. The bill passed by the
Senate that year fixed the rates at 36, 33,
91.50 and $1. The experience of ten years
has shown that the present rates are too
low for the faster mail steamers and too
bigh for the slower. The Frye bili' now in
effect restores the old Senate rate of $6 to
20-knot steamers, increasing from 8,000 to
10,000 tons the minimum size, and restores
the rate of 33 for 16-knot steamets provided
the size Is increased from 5,000 tons, the
present minimum, to 8,000 tons, the modern
British and German mail size. The bill
leaves at the present rates or reduces mail
]y for slower and smaller steamers. It
Ops altogether the obsolete wooden steam
er of only 12 knots as no longer eligible for
ocean mail service. The rates fixed by the
bill are maximum rates. Mail contracts
are open to competition and will be award
ed at rates as much below the maximum as
will secure an American mail service.
The proposed maximum mail rates per
gross ton per hundred nautical miles are:
Over 10.000 tons, 2D knots, 2.7 cents; 19
krots, 2.5 cents. Over 5,000 tons, 18 knots;
2.3 eents; 17 knots. 21 cents; 16 knots, 1.9
cents: 15 knots. 1.7 cents. Over 2,000 tons,
14 knots, 1.5 cents.
Rates for mail steamers to the West In
dies, Central America and Mexico cannot
eiceed 70 per cent of the maximum rates
on account of their shorter voyages and
manller coal supply.
General Subsidy.
The second title, "General Subsidy," con
tains the general subsidy for all vessels,
steam or sail, which are not under mail
contracts. This general subsidy Is uniform,
one cent per gross ton per 100 nautical
miles, for not exceeding sixteen entries in
one year. This amount is sufficient, ac
cording to the latest figures, to equalize
the difference in American seamen's
wages and in the cost of building ocean
steamers In the United States and Great
Britain, referred to in President Roose
velt's message and Secretary Gage's re
port.
To promote the building of new ocean ves
eels an additional allowance of one-fourtn
of a cent per gross ton is made for five
years.
Any vessel to receive the general subsidy
must carry mails, If required: must train
in seamanship or engineering one American
youth .for eachi 1.000 tons. The owner must
agree to hold the vessel at the service or
the government, if requairtal for defense,
the pay for such service~ to be appraised
.a representative of the government and
of the owner. 'These requirements are taken
substantially from the ocean mall act or
Any vessel to receive subsidy must be
class Al. and at least one-fourth of the
crew must be Americans.
A vessel going to a foreign port les than
150 miles from the United State. ow makitng
lees than half its voyage on sat wter is
not entitled to subsidy. Barge,, canal
boats. tugboats and wrecking vesseis are
also excluded.
The third title, "Deep Sea Fisheries," pro
wides an annual bounty of 32 a ton for
4eeP sea fishing vessels, and of 31 a month
for American citizens when engaged in
deep sea fisheries.
The fourth title, "General Provisions,"
provides that a vessel shall receive only one
frm of subsidy, and that a vessel whica
has received a subsidy shall not be sold
to a foreigner except by consent of the
becretary of the Treasury. The President
hall designate heads of departments to
erovide regulations to carry out this bill.

TEMPEST IN A -TEAPOT
RUMOR OF FRICTION OVER ORGANI
ZATION OF OHIO LEGISLATURE.
Mr. Foraker Makes a Statement Say
Ing That His Relations With Mr.
Hassa Are Cordial. I
Senator Foraker of Ohio, In answer to
numerous applications made to him for a
statement concerning the alleged friction
between him and Senator Hanna over the
organization of the Ohio legislature, today
gave out the following:
"I have been so overwhelmed with my
duties here that it has been Impossible for
me to keep fully up with the newspapers.
I did not therefore have A chance to read
until yesterday and this morning what has
happened in the Ohio newspapers about the
organization of the Ohio legislature. The
whole thing may be appropriately charac
terized as a tempest in a teapot, and a very
small teapot at that.
"Beyond a natural desire to help. men
who would help me to get places they want
I have no interest in the question who shall
have this, that or any other office in con
nection with the organization of either the
house or the senate.
Has Not Made Anybody a Candidate.
"I have not made anybody a candidate
for any place, and in so far as I have had
or expressed a preference for any one it
has had no reference whatever to Senator
Hanna or his re-election. At the risk of
the remark appearing disrespectful, I feel
bound to say that I did not think of him or
his political interests in any such connec
tion. It did not occur to me that these
matters had any reference to him or his
political future.
"I do not know what Mr. Kurtz has said
or done except from his statements that
have appeared in the newspapers, which I
have no doubt are absolutely truthful, but
I do happen to know that he had nothing
to do with making Mr. Scobey a candidate
or of making Mr. Speelman or Mr. Price a
candidate, but whether he had or not he
has not represented me or pretended to, so
far as I have any knowledge, in regard to
any of these matters.
"The story that I have been appealed to
repeatedly to make concess'ons for the sake
of harmony and had refused to do so i5
utterly unwarranted epXcept to this extent,
Senator Hanna wrote me a letter request
ing me to favor Mr. Uhl for clerk of the
senate. I answered as politely as I could,
expressing regret that I was unable be
cause of mhy promise to another to comply
with his wish.
Cordial Relations With Hanna.
"Senator Hanna took no exception and
would not think of doing so to my answer.
On the contrary, in the only conversation I
have ever had with him in regard to these
matters, he said he recognized that it was
my privilege and also his to stand by our
mutual friends and that where we might
have differing preferences there was no
occasion for any feeling or unfriendly op
position. Our conversation on this subject
was entirely friendly and our relations have
been and are entirely cordial. We do not
always agree about everything, but when
we differ there is no thought of unkindness
on the part of one toward the other, simply
because we do not happen to see in that
particular case exactly right.
"So far as the organization of the legisla
ture is concerned, to speak my mind frank
ly~about it, I do not think either Senator
Hanna or myself should be bothered about
it, or that we should have any special care
as to how or by whom the various places
are filled, provided good men are chosen
who will creditably represent the party
and the state. I do not know of any of the
candidates who have been mentioned for the
respective places who are not good men,
who will, if chosen, worthily fill the posi
tions they are seeking.
"I decline. therefore, to be excited or dis
turbed in the slightest by the plays of the
imagination which are flashing so sensa
tionally in the columns of newspapers not
noted for devotion to the Interests of the
republican party."
ONLY INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIONS.
Opposition to British Treaty Not to
Be Party Policy.
It was clearly developed today that the
opposition from several democrats to the
pending Hay-Pahncefote treaty-in the Sen
ate is individual and has not thus far taken
the shape of a party policy. In fact, there
are no indications of such a contingency,
and it is the general opinion among sena
tors who are keeping themselves posted
upon the situation that there will be no
united party opposition.
Senator Railey of Texas is one of the
most conspicuous opponents of the treaty
in its present form. He is not an opponent
of the isthmian canal project, however, he
says. Senator Bailey is not likely to carry
his opposition to the extent of attempting
obstruction of the treaty.
"I will not oppose the construction of the
canal if the treaty is set aside," said Sena
tor Bailey to a Star reporter this after
noon, "but I will vote against the treaty in
its existing shape. I will' never vote to
ratify any treaty that recognizes the right
of any nation except Nicaragua and Costa
Rica, through whose territory the canal
will pass, to have any voice whatever in
the control or operation of that waterway
by the United States."
"Do you think the treaty will be rati
fled?" he was asked.
"I am afraid it bill, though I hope it will
not," he replied. "I regard it as scarcely
less objectionable than the treaty of last
session, because I cannot find in it any im
portant concession which Great Britairi has
made."
It is practically certain that' several demn
ocrats who voted against the treaty .last
session will vote for the rattaan of the
penigtreaty. An effort will be made by
these in charge of the measure to have a
vote by the end of this week, if those who
are opposed to the treaty find that in that
time they will be aftorded suf~eiant oppor
tunity to express their views, There is no,
disposition to rairead the treaty through
the Senate, but the majority contend that'
as its ratification is inevitable, and as other
important legislation awaits action, a vote
should be obtained with as little delay as
may be consistent with the convenience of
all concerned.

AT THE WHITE HOUSE
A Justice of the eace Aked for
Georgetown;
TALK ON THE IIIANA JUNESHIP
The Chicago Appointments De
termined Upon.
A PORTO RICAN PLEA
The early selection of ten justices of the
peace under the judicial reorganization pro
vision of the revised code prevented Presi
dent Roosevelt getting as well acquainted
with District people as would have been
the case had he delayed the selections
a while longer. So there was some
interest at the White House to
day in the call of a. number of
prominent citizens of Georgetown. The
President gave them an early audience, al
though he had a reception room full of
other visitors., The delegation was com
posed of George G. Boteler, M. J. Adler,
G. W. Cissel, Captain P. T. Moran, J. T.
Dyer, George W. Offutt and Alphonse M.
Baer.
Tne object of the call was to say to the
President that the business men and citi
zens generally in Georgetown had been in
formed that out of the ten justices who
had been selected not one would be as
signed to Georgetown. If true, the delega
tion pointed out, this would work hardship
and disadvantage to the people of that sec
tion of the city, forcing them to the incon
venience of coming to the center of the
city for the transaction of business. The
people had always been satisfied, the dele
gation stated, with the administration of
Oliver P. Johnson, the justice of the peace
in that vicinity for so many years, and
were greatly disappointed when he had not
been chosen to continue in his work.
It was stated that Mr. Johnson had han
died and disposed of 5,000 cases during his
career, and of this large number had been
appealed from in only five. It was much
desired that Mr. Johnson should have a
place, and the delegation hoped the Presi
dent could reconsider his list of appointees
With the object of providing for Mr. John
son. At any rate, it was earnestly desired
that one of the justices should be assigned
to Georgetown.
The President suggested that the delega
tion visit Attorney General Knox and make
a statement to him.
A Long Judgeship Conference.
Attorney General Knox and Senators
Fairbanks and Beveridge had an' hour's
'ccnference with the President today about
tlc- federal circuit court vacancy that is to
be filled by the selection of an Indiana man.
This is the vacancy on which the two sen
ators have been unable to agree, and on
Which they did not agr'ee this morning
while in conference with the President. It
is believed, however, that an agreement
will be reached within twenty-four hours
and the nomination made. The President
has asked tjhe two senators to agree upon
a man, and they * will endeavor to do so.
Until they do something the matter will
hang in the air.
. The President does not like to act in so
important a case until the senators have
had an opportunity of settling their differ
ences. It is stated that Senator Beveridge
has pressed the claims of Francis E. Baker,
one of the judges of the state supreme
court, while Senator Fairbanks has not
made any recommendation, although said
to be favorable to Chief Justice Monks of
the state supreme court. Senator Fair
banks has said so little that his position
has been much In doubt. Political observ
qrs say that Senator Fairbanks has not up
to this time committed himself, for fear of
losing.' His friends say that he has re
frained from active recommendations be
cause he did not know how he would stand
at the White House under the new admin
istration. Delicacy of feeling and political
caution did not prompt him to rush in
without being bidden and without knowing
just how he would stand. So the senator
has held off, while Senator Beveridge has
pushed his candidate.
Until the assassination of President Mc
Kinley there was a common understanding
among the Indiana people that in view of
Senator Fairbanks' candidacy for the vice
presidential nomination in 1904, he should
dispense practically all of the patronage for
that state. There was probably no direct
agreement of this kind, but whatever the
understanding, it has changed since the
death of President McKinley.
Harry C. New, republican national com
mitteeman for Indiana, and Representative
Overstreet talked with the President about
the Indiana judgeship, and Mr. New took
luncheon with the President. These men
are said to be for R. 0. J)awkins for judge.
President Likes a Joke.
President Roosevelt relishes a joke even
when it is on himself. Several days ago a
western paper quote'd Senator Culiom s a'e
marking upon the outspokenness of the
President. The chief executive has a hearty
way of talking to his callers about their
agfairs in the presence and hearing of
others. As these talks nearly always take
place in. a more or less crowded reception
room there is comparatively little privacy.
The President must have seen the story at
tributed to Senator Cullom, for this morn
ing, when Senator Cullom appeared in the
room, the President , ushered the Illinois
senator into a far-off cerner and whispered
in his ear in a most cautious manner. As
both laughed the display qf secrecy must
have been understood.
Three Chicag-o Nominations.
Senator Mason had a talk with the Presi
dent this morning about three Jmportant
ofmes at Chialgs The resalt of the con
ference is that Wimtam Penn Nixon will
be renominated as collector of customs at
Chicago, John C. Ames will get ant~
flur years as United Ststes marshaeabl
Wm .Wmtliam will again serve as mib
treasurer at Chicgo
A 3.mba Nemmte.
Senator Platt and Representative Al
ander of Buffalo were with the President
a few minutes regarding the collectorship
of customs at Buffalo. It has been de
cided to renominate Henry W. Brendel as
collector.
A Keatueky O~me.
Representative Irwin of Louisville saw
the - President and asked the renombia
tion of the United Stte attorney of the
western -district of Kentucky. The Presi
dent has decided to give Postmaster Baker
aetother term at Louisville.

"Crazy snakef" Call.
"Crazy Snake," a minor leader of the
Creek Indians, called at the White House
this afternoon with foul other Creeks and
his interpreter In an- endeavor to see the
President. They were'told that they would
have to call accompanied by the Indian
commissioner, or some person connected
with that office. Commigsoner Jones has
refused to go to the White House with
them.
"Crazy Snake" belongs- o.that element of
the Creeks that has opposed all the recent

They have never accept# the terns of the

name is Wilson Jones, wants to keep white
men from grazing their cattle on former

B. W. Walker, T. W. Curry and, J. I. Mc

talk with the President today to protest
against confining the recognition for the
distribution of federal patronage in that
state to J. W. Dimmiek, who was elected
republican national committeeman at Phil

After its session today the -United States
Supreme Court took a recess 'until January

RUN ON OMAHA BANK
Minderstanding Regarding It. (on
neotion With Loan Ompany.
LuER IEORTIDN l II mouN
City Savings Bank Was Able to
Weather the Storm.
MQNEY REDEPOSITED
OMAHA, Neb., December 9.-There was
a considerable number of depositors of City
Savings Bank present to withdraw their
money when the -doors of that institution
opened today, owing to a misunderstanding
that the savings bank was connected with
the Omaha Loan an4 Trust Company,
w'hich was reported Saturday to be in finan
cial difficulties. Four tellers paid the de
positors as fast as they presented their
books, but many of them on learning that
the bank had become segregated from the
trust company, returned and again dp
posited their money. The bank officials
were prepared for the run and had great
piles of gold on the counters with whieh
to pay the uneasy depositors.
"The run is due solely to the wrong im
pression that the savings bank Is connected
with the Omaha Loan and Trust Company."
said Vice President Flack. 'There is no
connection whatever between the two com
panies, but as the owners and officers or
the City Savings Bank a short time ago
bought the savings bank department of the
Omaha Loan and Trust Company, and I
occupying the offices formerly occupied by
it, a number of persons do not yet realise
that the two institutions are entirely sepa
rate and distinct."
"While there is absolutely no occasion for
the run," continued Mr. Flack, "the City
Savings Bank Is prepared to meet any de
mands that may be made and will pay
promptly every depositor that presents fils
book."
TOM L. JOHNSON PLEASED.
Cleveland Mayor Discusses Factional
Fight Among Republicans.
Special Dispatch to The Evening Star.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, December 9.-Mayor
Tom L. Johnson Is rather pleased at the
evidences of an outbreak of the factiolial
war In this state between Senator Hanna
and Senator Foraker. It will help the
democrats, he said, and will help the people
of the state to better legislation. It will
be *ell for the people of the state if the
democrats, In conjunction with one or the
other warring republican factions can exact
the necessary legislation on the subject of
taxation in the state. It is of much greater
consequence to the people of Ohio to have
action on the subject of tax reform -than
to have peace and harmony In the ranks of
the ;Vpublican party.

RACKED TO DEATH DY BOLOMEN.
Horrible Fate of Party of Prospectors
in Philippines.
WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, Mont., De
cember 9.--The fate of George Hayes and a
party of three prospectors who left here to
prospect in the Philippines in 1899 has been
revealed in a letter just received in the
city. The party has been missingr since
March, 1900, and' every effort to locate the
miners has 6een futile up to this time. Rev.
J. C. Tenhart, formerly a minister at Ha
waII, residing at Mania, was induced by
friends of the missing inen to take up the
search. D~llgent inquiry on his part dis
closed the fact that the party, disregarding
the warnings of the military not to venture
beyond their lines of defense, had gone into
the mountains of central Lusop.
Later the bodies of the four men were
fdund, literally chopped-to pieces by bolo
meon. The heads and arms were severed
from the bodies and the bodies were other
wise horribly mnutilated. The bodies of
Bayes and Jese Brown were dta~ed by
papers they had upon their pesozng,

COURT MAKES RUUNG
Declines to Admit Qaetion ProM.d
ed by Mr Bonine's OounaaL
Dr. Carr Positive Wounds Were
Inflicted at Short Range.
PHOTOGRAPH REJECTED
There was plenty of interest in the BoaftS
murder trial today, yet the attendance was
smaller than on any day since the jury was
selected. Fewer women were present thea
on any previous day of the trial. It was
10:30 o'clock before the examination of
former Coroner Carr was resumed. Pm
ceding the doctors recall to the stand Jus
tice Anderson rendered his decision over
ruling the admission of the hypothetical
question propounded Saturday, and regard
ing which there was lengthy argument by
counsel on that day.
Mrs. Bonine evinced more than ordinary
interest while Justice Anderson was renden
tug his decision. Her respiration was no
ticeably accelerated and she appeared to b4
apprehensive as to the important point in
her defense, which was under considera
tion, as confirming her story of a struggle
with Ayres, and that the wounds could not
have been Inqicted at long range. She
seemed engaged in another struggle, en
deavoring to hold up under the intense
strain. The defendant's brother and si
ters, who have been with her constantly
throughout the trial, also seemed conscious
of the importance of the decision of the
court on this important point.
At several different times during the fore
noon session Mr. Douglass and District At
torrtey Gould engaged in sharp tilts. There
was laughter on the part of the spectat
and Justice Anderson announced that if
there were a repetition he would order the
court room cleared. What caused the
laughter was a retort by Mr. Douglass to
an objection interposed by the district at
torney.
Coumsei Clash.
"All of a sudden, after three weeks, my
friend, the district attorney, has awak
ened from a Rip Van Winkle sleep to the
realization that we are having expert teeti
mony In this case," said Mr. Douglass,
"We have just as high an appreciation of
the intelligence of the jury as the govern.
ment has. and we respectfully submit that
we have the right to ask these questions In
order to prove our position in this case."
Dr. Carr proved to be an important wit
ness for the defense. He was positive
that the wounds In Ayres' body were in
flicted at short range. His tesaimony was
in direct contradiction to that of Dr. Glase
brook, who testified for the government.
Mrs. Bonine watched every word with the
utmost Interest. The bloody undershirt
worn by Ayres was again bnought forth.
The indications are that the trial will
up the attention of the court the grenU
part of the week.
Comat pseades a Peft.
It was nearly i0:0 o'clock before the
proceedingiy were resumed ON tohing.
While waiting for Justice Auesses te sp
pear, counsel for the deflle ad er the
government engaged in conversation.
After the jurors not Impaneled in the
case had been excused anti next Thurs
day morning Judge Anderson announced
his ruling upon the question that precipi
tated the argument which was in progrees
all day Saturday. This question was put
to Dr. W. P. Carr by the defense, and
was as follows:
"Doctor, in your opinion, what differ
ence, if any would there be in the height
or direction of the wound, assuming that
the party receiving the wound is either
standing, walking or running?"
Without passing on the legal proposition
involved, Justice Anderson stated at the
outset that it lacked the facts on which
an Intelligent answer could be based. No
man could answer the question without as
suming the relative positions of the two
parties. The court added that the ques
tion was indefinite and thereby rendered in
admissible, and, In form, objectionable.
"If the question should 'be admitted,"
said the court, "it would inject into this
case a confusion and a clouded situation
that would embarrass the jury in investi
gating and determining the truth of the
issue. The question does not embrace the
necessary facts upon which to base a
rational answer.
"I wIll give Counsel an opportunity to re
form the question," concluded Justice An
derson, "or will finally rule upon the
issue."
The jury was then conducted into the
room. Attorney Douglass fbrmally asked
the question again, United States Attorney
Gould Objected, the court sustained the ob
jection and an exception was noted.
Queetiea is *ther Persas.
Before further examining Dr. Carr coun
sei conferred with Dr. Rautin and Dr.
Bovee, the other experts retained by the
defense.
Attorney Douglass next asked the ques
tion in several different forms. Mr. GioulO
objected to each form, the objections were
sustained and exceptions were noted.
The effort of the defense was to show by
Dr. Carr that in view of the location of the
wound on Ayres' hip the question et
whether the deceased was or was not in
motion at the time the .bullet struck him
would not have changed or influenced the
location of the wound.
The government's counsel did not object
to the following question, proponded by
the defense:
"[n view of the location of the hip wound,
as desCribed by Dr. Gissebook, state
whether or not the wound could have been
influenceid in height and direction, or either,
by the fact that Aires was or was not
walking or rnnitngr"
"SIt woulid not materialy imiusee it as
I understand it," answered Dr. Carr.
"Why do you say thee height er dissetion
would not be materinny 'eema" them is
