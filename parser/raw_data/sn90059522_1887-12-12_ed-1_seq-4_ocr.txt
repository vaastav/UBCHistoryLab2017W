MINNESOTA COMPLIMENTED.
It is a very proper compliment that |
lias been paid Minnesota in the appoint
ment of Senators Sabin and Davis to
the head of two such important com
mittees as railroads and pensions. Min
nesota knows something about each of
those two great subjects. She has cross
ing her territory, with headquarters in
her capital, some of the greatest railroad
systems in the country, and in the
proper regulation of railway traffic her
business men are vitally interested.
And thus, too, with pensions. Within
the borders of Minnesota reside thou
sands of the veterans of the civil war;
men who are properly the beneficiaries
of a gratelul country and men
whom the country honors itself
in remembering. The interests
of these veterans should be carefully
guarded and faithfully preserved, and
the senate committee on pensions is not
an unimportant factor in that work.
That two more capable, more intelli
gent or more willing men than Senators
Sauiv and Davis could have been se
lected from the Republican majority for
the important positions that have been
bestowed upon the representatives from
this state, Minnesotians would be slow
to admit. The state is complimented as
much as its senators are honored, and it
is a compliment that is but a lilting
recognition of the important place it oc-
copies in the sisterhood.
A POLICE GYMNASIUM.
The subject of establishing a police
gymnasium is lieing agitated in Minne
apolis. It should also be considered in
St. Paul, and each city should do some
thing more than talk about it. With a
large police force the establishment of
a gymnasium should lie considered es
sential. The trained athlete has an ad
vantage over the man whose physical
strength has not been cultivated that is
obvious. Policemen may be called
upon at any time to exercise till the
strength and agility that the trained ath
lete puts forth at times of the greatest
exertion. They may be and frequently
arc called upon to engage in rough
hand to hand encounters with men
physically superior to them. It is there
fore desirable that they should at least
be put upon an equal footing with pos
sible antagonists. The man who
"knows how to use his lists*" for in
stance, is able to hold his own with an
opponent of twice his strength who is
ignorant of the principles of sparring.
The police forces of the Twin Cities
contain admirable material, but their
efficiency would be vastly increased if
the muscular powers of the men were
cultivated by systematic exercise. in
large cities like Chicago and Xew York
gymnasium work is made compulsory
.upon policemen, and in consequence the
police forces of these two cities have at
tained an excellence, viewed from a
physical and disciplinary standpoint,
that has made theni the admiration of
the entire country. A gymnasium
should be as distinctive a feature of a
well-equipped police force as the patrol
wagon. Each city should establish a
physical training school, and should do
it with as little delay as possible.

A PROPER PKOTKST.
Gen. Aimu.phus Gkeki.y appears to
be a person whose services would be
more valuable to the people in a less
important position than the head of the
Signal service. It was only recently
that, in spite of the protests of the busi
ness men of Boston, this accidental gen
eral, who feels the weight of his au
thority very much, removed a signal
service observer at the Hub who, by the
accuracy of his predictions, has become
almost indispensable to the shipping in
terests of that port. Having succeeded
in making himself thoroughly disliked
in that quarter, he has now turned
his attention to Chicago. Not
withstanding the energetic protest
of the Chicago board of trade,
lie litis relieved from duty at that point
an observer who, by the accuracy of his
weather predictions, has gained the con
fidence and implicit, reliance of every
shipmaster -ailing on the lakes, and
whose value to the business interests of
Chicago cannot he estimated in dollars
and cents. There were no charges
against the observer, but the position is
a desirable one. and < '1:1:1:1. v bad a
favorite to whom he desired to give it:
hence a valuable man had to give way
to one totally inexperienced. At the
time of <Jj:r.i:i.Y"- promotion it was an
open secret among those acquainted with
the inside history of that ill-fated
Arctic expedition that had elevated
him above the heads of officers who
had grown gray in the service that
if the case were thoroughly un
derstood—that, in fact, if justice
were done — Gkekia* would, despite
his hardships, receive condemna
tion instead of commendation. The ex
perience of the Boston and Chicago
business men "would seem to prove that
he is not a fit servant of the people. It
might be well, therefore, if a higher
authority were invoked to bring
Greelv to a recognition of the fact that
the business public has some rights
which he is bound to respect.
_r--_.
ANOTHER TRAIN ROBBERY.
Travel in the Southwest is attended
with breaks in the monotony of an or
dinarily tedious journey which serve
to relieve the tedium very effectually.
The train robber regards tiie South
western routes as his own particular
field of operations, and he has been at
tending to business again in his usual
energetic, if somewhat brusque man
ner. That three men could hold up a
passenger brain crowded with people,
many of them armed, and gel away un
scathed with £40,000 seems almost in
credible in view of the stories we
are accustomed to hear regarding
the fierce bravery of the typi
cal Southwesterners. Perhaps, how
ever, the train attacked was laden ex
clusively with women and children.
Even in that case the ordinary train
crew of six men ought to be a tolerably
good match for three assailants. Train
robberies have happily been conspicu
ous by their absence in the Northwest,
but some day one may be attempted.
Then, as the bodies of the would-be
robbers, filled with bullets, swing from
a convenient telegraph pole, our South
western neighbors will be taught a very
interesting object lesson regarding the
most effective way of putting an end to
the annoyance.
STRAY SUNBEAMS.
This has not been a "boom" year for
St. Paul, and especially as it relates to
real estate and building. But with all
that, the building record exceeds that of
last year by £2.000,000. Taking into con
sideration all the conditions that gov
erned the building record of the year,
this is probably the most remarkable
showing a city - vet* made.
Las! spring, just at the time when it
looked as if this city were going to have
a building "boom," came the labor
strike. That strike was a fearful back
set to the city. Many persons who con
templated building, and were making
their arrangements for it. were deterred
by the strike from going ahead. It is
safe to say that but for the strike from
1,000 to 2,000 more houses would have
been put up in St. Paul during the past
summer.
Then later on came the financial de
pression in the East, and some were in
fluenced by it to contract their building
operations. Thus circumstances seemed
to conspire against this city's enjoying
the building "boom"' which seemed so
promising early in the season. Yet,
notwithstanding all these drawbacks,
the building statistics for the year foot
up over EI.KVEX million's.
The logical argument of these build
ing figures which the Glum: gives this
morning is that St. Paul's growth is not
only the most rapid of any city in the
world, but it is the most conservative.
A city which can show such a building
record in the face of so many opposing
conditions and fortuitous circum
stances, must have incorporated within
itself all the elements of a solid and per
petual prosperity. The figures of our
building record are the best advertise
ment a city could have.
Xor was this great sum expended
mainly ia one or two costly buildings.
The Globe's record shows that over
4.000 new buildings have been erected
within the city during the past season.
But for the labor strike the number
might have been 0.000. and with any
thing like "boom" conditio) s the record
would have gone much higher than
that. But St. Paul is in no sense a boomed
city. It doesn't need booming. Its
natural growth even under most ad
verse conditions is away ahead of any
other city on the continent.
"Has a preacher a right to use slang
in the pulpit." asked the Old Citizen
last night. " I am a regular attendant at
one of the most prominent churches in
the city, and yesterday I heard the pas
tor during a most animated discourse
use the expression, 'Not by a jugful!. '
Now. i want know to if he was justified
in it.* The GLOBE told the Old Citizen
that he thought the preacher was right,
provided there was no other equally
forcible term to lie employed in giving
expression to hi- ideas. .Some of our
slang words and sentences give a force
and expression to ideas when nothing
else will fill the bill. It is with slang
as it is with secular music. There is
no reason why the devil should have
the exclusive use of the best of it.
That is good news the Globe has
; from Jordan this morning, telling of the
■ discovery of a coal vein in that vicinity.
i If there is anything in this world that
Minnesota would be devoutly thankful
for at this season of the year it would be
; a good coal mine within its borders.
I Even Jordan's cold waves would have
i no terrors for us if there were a prospect
| of finding coal on the other side. If the
; Jordan coal find turns out all right, we
; will never again accuse Jordan of being
\ a hard road to travel.
Nov.- if congress will give the country a
tariff reduction bill rounded on the presi
dent's Dressage, it will stand forgiven in ad
vance for all the sin- it is sure lo commit.
Minnesota gets two senate committee
chairmanships. Had she more senators she
would have gotten more committees. Things
are accustomed to come Minnesota's war.
When Gov. M< (.n.i. consents lobe inter
viewed on high license again he should add
the proviso that hi- remarks arc U) be taken
only in a Pickwickian sense.
By ai.i. means let us have a police gymna
sium, and a pistol galiery. too. Our patrol
men ought to be put in trim to make it inter
esting for the casual burglar.

DIVISION IS DEAD.
That Is What Ex-Gov. Penning-
ton Says in His Paper.
Yankton (Dak.) Telegram.
At last accounts the majority for di
vision had dwindled down to less than
' 3,000, and the returns from all the coun
! ties, when received and compiled, will
• probably wipe that out. A vote on the
I same question last year might have been
j different, and next year when there will
I be a full vote a more favorable result
1 might be had, but the time has passed.
: We shall hear no more of division, cx
i cept the sighing wails of the disap
' pointed politician, or the vehement ap
i -teal*, of capital location boomers. The
I thing is dead, very dead, and the people
j of Dakota will have to come in as one
State, or stay out indefinitely. The
! people cannot be aroused to action
on this division business any more,
in fact the interest has died out. The
construction of North and South roads,
the removal of the capital to Bismarck,
and the antics of cranky politicians
; have done the work and" division is
; dead. Now then, what is to be done?
! Stay out and go on with all the corrup
tions and wrangles of a territorial con
-1 dition, or apply to congress for an enab
j ling act for the admission of Dakota as
: a state. These are the questions, and the
| people must and will answer them for
I themselves, and they will answer them
i intelligently and honestly— and the de
-1 cree will be for the admission of the
state of Dakota. The preponderance of
pressure at Washington this winter will
! be for an enabling act by which the peo
| pie of the whole of Dakota can call a
■ convention and form a state constitution
preparatory to admission into the Union.

The Sheep and the Fox.

The Sheep "Permitted him to Occupy
a seat on her Back and Carried him
Safely over. A few days Later She was
in great Distress of mind over her Lost
Lamb, and called to the Fox to Assist in
the Search.
"Oh. but I have my own Affairs to

"But, didn't I carry you Across the
Stream."
"Certainly."
"And didn't you Declare your Grati

A Wise Document.

"The Fiftieth congress opens to-day
and sounds the death-note of the Demo

that appears in Monday's Pioneer Press.
Notwithstanding the Press' dismal pre
diction, it will find the aforementioned
party a very lively "corpse" before next
fall's campaign closes.

1 in a certain Eastern
city last winter,
J writes Katherine
. Prindiville in the
■.Chicago Herald.
'Knowing that, as a
rule, ladies dread
dressing a doll.
especially during the rush of miscella
neous work that inevitably crowds itself
into the lew weeks preceding Christ
mas, and that such a thing as buying
good ready-made clothes was out of the
question, they went to work and made
up dolls" outfits, from dainty cap and
stylish hat to stockings, underwear, and
aprons and stand-up collars. They rented
one window in a sewing machine room
on one of the principal retail streets,
paid the proprietor a commission for
selling the goods, placed them on exhi
bition ten days before Christmas, and in
three days the stock was sold out,
netting them a goodly sum. The ladies
fairly fought for the little clothes, and
were lavish in their admiring encom
iums upon the careful workmanship
displayed. The underclothes sold in
sets of five, including a sacque
night dress. which varied in
price according to size and the
quality of trimming with which
they were adorned. A very nice set for
a doll of eighteen inches in length could
be bought for S3 cents, a reasonable
enough price when one considered the
fact that all were made of good muslin,
with French seams, trimmed with nar
row* patent Valenciennes lace, and sup
plied with well-worked button-holes
and small pearl buttons. Aprons of
domestic gingham sold for 10 cents, and
dresses of the same material for 15 and
SO cents. There were also little frocks
in muslin, silk, wool and satin at prices
to suit the purses of all. The stock of
cloaks was large, and rivaled in cut and
finish those intended for little girl mam
mas, and big ones, too, for that matter.
There were ulsters with and without
capes and hoods, hunting jackets of
warm cloth, with broad belts, jackets,
with vests and without, and even the
fashionable yoked circular showed its,
ample folds beside the diminutive dol
man trimmed with jet passementerie,-
Not content with offering wardrobes
alone, there was also for sale sheets audi
pillow-eases for dolls' beds and littler
blankets for the same, made of do-*.
mestic flannel, cross-stitched around the.
edges with colored worsteds, while to
provide against any such cold as the*
blankets tailed to keep out, were com-,
fortables with covers of blight shades of,
cheese cloth, tied with contrasting col
ors. To complete these sets were
spreads of the honey-comb canvas, that;
at one time had its day for tidies, and
which proved an admirable imitation of
the counterpanes now in eeneral use.?
The prices of all were extremely reason-,
able, and yet enough to cover the cost,
of material and repay the girls for their
time and labor. I
Graceful scarfs for table, easel, man
tel and piano grow in favor steadily,
and well do they deserve their popu
larity. Handsome ones are made of
thread crocheted over an exaggerated
hair-pin; which, by the way, requires to
be made by a tinsmith, as the thick
wire of which it is formed can be bent
to the proper shape only by an expert.
These scarfs in the brown shade
which can be found in seine
thread, are beautiful when bright
ened up with ribbons of copper
color and yellow run through tlieir
meshes. Sequins, tassels or balls of silk
may be hung on the ends of the ribbons.
Knitting silk may be used for these,
too, ami while not so expensive as one
might think, are very lovely when made
of yellow or pale blue and run through
with ribbons of the same shade,
a contrasting color tending to
cheapen the whole to an al
most incredible extent. Lamp shades
increase in size and beauty, and are par
ticularly noticeable when made of pine
apple silk finely plaited and finished at
the top with a puff of soft, rich-looking
lace and at the lower edge with a deep
flounce of the same. Very misty and
frost-like in appearance are those made
entirely of lace, while those of stripes
of ribbons separated by insertion of lace
wear well and are elegant and effective.
Well might the latest in button bags
sing, "Six Little Button Bags Are We,"
for they invariably come in clusters of
six, which stand upright around a circu
lar foundation of silken-covered card
board. They are about four inches in
length when" finished, drawn up an inch
from the top with a small silk cord, and
joined to each other about half way up
the sides with invisible stitches, while a
fat little cushion rests in the midst
of them and seems to afford them
support, although in reality they stand
quite straight even if the cushion
doesn't happen to be there. They are a
decided novelty and quite attractive in
their contrasting or harmonizing colors.
Biscuit-brown and yellow alternating
make a rich bunch, while lizard-green
and orange together are very fashiona
ble. Light bunches are made of Jap
anese silk in variegated colors, and
lined with silk to match the darkest
hue. Satchel bags are countless, as are
collar ami cuff bags, laundry bags, and
bags for the weekly darning.
Widely different in shape and make
up, are cases for all sorts of uses. Some
are covered with chamois skin, silk, '
satin or the filmy pineapple silk, all del
icately painted in floral designs or with
artistic figures gracefully draped. - On
man] bloom the gorgeous sunflower
which still holds its own the deco
rative world. Some handkerchief cases
of chamois are beautifully painted with
borders of conventionalized flowers and
leaves, which are lovely on the soft
tinted backgrounds. Chamois can now be j
had in a pale <ji-eeii. pink. cream and pure J
white. A handkerchief case of the pale '
green— it is just a ••hint of a tint" of a
shade of green -is very beautiful with a
border of white clover blossoms accom
panied by their leaves, among which a ,
spider web Is inextricably tangled. '
This is lined with a darker shade of
green satin, and finished with a puff of '
the same around the edge. A large bow' j
of broad liltbon almost covers the top.
What might be called a poem . in white
ami yellow is a glove case of white !
chamois, upon which is painted a wreath
of white daisies, the lining and bow at
the corner matching, the golden center
of the flower. Upon shaving-paper J
cases of pineapple silk are painted.

both ends until they resemble an over

a ; couple of spools of thread are
'confined by a length of the narrow
est? ribben tliat can be had, while cling
ing'to the inner sides are pockets for
needles and thimble, besides a tiny
pincushion. On each of the outer sides
are sewn three rows of small brass rings,

and* three in the third, being intended
for holding button hooks, etc. Ribbons

utilized for hanging it from a gas pipe
or any other convenient projection. A
dainty key rack is in the shape of a but

made of light gauzy material, upon

Tidies of chamois are orna

which the nasturtium, in its flame-like
red, is the most brilliant and effective,
especially when it trails its willowy
stem across a background of buff. A
pretty fringe, finishes the ends of these,
and is made by cutting the chamois it
self into slits a quarter of an inch in
width and about two inches in depth,
this being brightened in places by
dashes of color, which are laid on here
and there before the fringe is cut.
To an artistically inclined friend what
could be more acceptable than an album
filled with the photographic copies of
the works of great painters or sculptors,
which arc the very latest in the way of
an art novelty? One may buy a series
of pictures of any one artist, or select
at random from the works of favorites,
thus securing a book of rare beauty
and value. The collections range
from the photographs of orig
inal paintings of old mas
ters of the different schools of art to
those of the artists of our own day, the
subjects being copies of paintings, fres
coes, architectural subjects, engravings
and etchings, so that in the arrange
ment of an album of this kind every
taste may be consulted, while the labor
involved on the part of the donor would
increase its value tenfold in the eyes of
an appreciative recipient.

COLLECTING DEBTS.
An Experienced Collector Who
Finds It Pays to Be Deaf.
New York Sun.
; "No, we have not adopted the Chi
cago method of collecting bills in New
York," said an experienced bill col
lector, "and I don't know that the po
lice would tolerate it if we had. The
wagon marked in flaming letters, 'Bad
Debts Collected,' is still unknown in
our streets, and if any office sends
around letters with "Bad Debt' stamped
on their envelopes, I have not heard of
it. Debts are collected in New York
by dunning, if the debtor won't pay
within a decent time and has property
within reach. And dunning, as well as
being the oldest, is, after all, the most
effectual method."
"But suppose the debtor is 'not at
home' to be dunned."*
Then I wait quietly until he is at
home— if the debt is worth waiting for.
If I can I get the servant as soon as I
call, and before she has notified her
master, to let me in, which, as 1 look
respectable she can hardly refuse to do,
and* l sit down, if not invited to a seat,
until she comes with an answer. Then
1 decide to wait until he come in and
am quite obtuse to any hints as to the
■probable lateness of his return. If he
is a man. or she is a woman who wishes
to keep up appearances with the ser
vants that debt is soon settled.
"But if the servant is in with the em
ployer then a more persistent course
has to be adopted and calls made so fre
quently as to attract the attention of
folks living in the vicinity. I take the
rebuff, which iii such a case I am sure
to meet, very quietly and respectfully
ami very leisurely, and in a way to be
seen by anybody at the windows around.
1 : select the bill from a handful of
other bills, lood, at it, 'fiddle' over it,
and perhaps mark something on it, and
slowly and carefully return it to the
bunch. Then, as if unconscious that I
had attracted any attention. I descend
the steps to the street and walk off,
carrying the bunch of bills in my hand.
This, repeated a few days in any neigh
borhood, respectable or otherwise, is
commonly enough to bring the debtor to
time, or compel him to move.
"One trick I have is to pretend to be
deaf. As a matter of fact my hearing
is as good as anybody's, but deafness is
an excellent faculty in a collector es
pecially when combined with hearing
acute enough to detect a hint of settle
ment. There's a lawyer down town,
good enough pay, but rather slow, and
it is amusing to notice how acts when
I happen in his office. He starts up
from his desk and meets me half way,
and puts bis mouth Into my ear to tell
me when he will settle, or that he can't
settle just then, or something of that
sort. I pretend not to understand just
what he has said, and in a loud tone
which deaf people ordinarily use I ask
him to repeat it, which he does with a
great deal of disgust. My manner is of
course so respectful that he has no oc
casion for offense.
••There are one or more collecting
agencies which menace debtors with
the publication of their names in ashed
or circular for distribution throughout
the country among business men; but
my own opinion is that the method is
not a very effective one. I know of one
instance in which a debtor was about to
pay over money to a collector and the
collector unfortunately remarked, as
much in jest as in earnest, 'I'm glad
you're paying this now, as I was just
about to send your name to — men
tioning ii concern of the kind to which
I have alluded. The money had not yet
passed from the debtor's outstretched
hand. He was a quick-tempered sort of
fellow and the remark stuns- him. He
drew back the money and pocketed it,
with the remark: 'Oh, indeed ! I would
just like to see my name in that affair.'
The collector went away without his
money, aid as the debtor happened to
be a shrewd and experienced lawyer it
was deemed prudent not to herald his
name in the manner indicated.
"There are many ways of collecting a
debt, but plain, simple, dunning is the
st."

Milwaukee Boer Boycotted.
New Yokk, Dec. 11.— Central.
Labor union to-day unanimously
adopted a resolution boycotting Mil
waukee beer. This action is in support
of the striking Milwaukee beer brewers.
The Musical" Protective union, which
was expelled for allowing its members
to play in the Union Square theater
where non-union carpenters are em
ployed, was readmitted.
The Dead Anarchists.
Chicago, Dee. 11.— Another change
in the programme for the final
obsequies of the . dead anarchists
is o announced this evening. The
burial, it is now understood, will

TOOK THE GAS ROUTE.
A Harvard Freshman Successfully
Mixes Gas and Pofson.
AN OLD NEGRO LYNCHED.
Harder Results From a Button Quarrel
in Kentucky— Various Other
Crimes.
Special to the Globe.
Boston, Dec. 11.— Henry. J. Powell,
of New York, aged nineteen, a Harvard
freshman, committed suicide in his
room last night by taking poison and
then turning on three gas jets and lying
down on the bed to await death. An
autopsy shows that death was caused by
the gas before the poison had rime to
operate. Powell was naturally a bright
young man, but had been depressed in
spirits of late.
Said He Was a Voudoo.
Mixdkx, La., Dec. 11.— The body of
Andrew Edwards.a negro seventy years
of age, was discovered a day or two ago
suspended from the limb of a tree a few
miles distant from this place. The mat
ter has been thoroughly investigated,
and all information warrants the asser
tion that the old man was lynched by
men of his own color and without the
slightest cause other than superstition.
The old man was considered a voudoo.
and upon this flimsy pretext he was
lynched. Three or more young negro
men are suspected. The old man was
universally liked by all the white peo
ple, and his death by violence will be
avenged if possible.
GILMER NOT A LIAR.
Some of the Information He Gave
to the State.
Chicago, Dec. 11. — Ex-Assistant
State's Attorneys Walker and ' Furth
man, in an interview published to-day,
answer the questions: "Was Harry
Gilmer a liar? Did August Spies really
strike a match in Crane's alley
and light the fuse in the bomb that
Schnaubelt threw in the Haymarket?"
The interview reveals the hitherto un
published fact that Gilmer first gave
other almost equally important infor
ini..ion about the Haymarket meet
ing, which was * subsequently
found correct in every detail.
It was this that led State's Attorney
Grinneil to put him on the stand as a
direct witness against Spies. The in
formation reterred to was a description
of the man who helped Fielden down
from the wagon after the bomb
was thrown, and a descrip
tion of another man in the
crowd, the one who shouted "Hang
him" when the name of Jay Gould was
mentioned. These two men, William
Snyder and Thomas Brown, were
arrested. and Gilmer identified
I hem among a crowd of
fifty. They both subsequently con
fessed. Mr. Furthmaii said Spies' pre
dominant characteristic was vanity, and
to any one who knew him it was almost
incredible that, unless he were to see
the throwing of the bomb, he
would jump from the wagon when told
that the police were coming. Legner,
the anarchists' own witness, swore that
Spies did jump down at the first word
telling of the approach of the police.
A DEMOCRATIC NEGRO
Comes Very Near Being "Lynched
by a Mob.
Cako, 111., Dec. 11.— Joseph Houser
a colored man, was, not long ago, ap
pointed a pension agent by President
Cleveland and assigned to ~ duty in
Southeast Missouri, with headquarters
at Cape Girardeau. Yesterday as he
was investigating pension matters at La
Forge, Mo., he was seized by a mob,
who were incensed against him, whether
because ohe| was a negro and . invested
with authority by the president,
or.- for some other reason, is
not known. The mob - hurried* him
to tall timber with the intention, openly
and hilariously expressed, of stringing
him un to a tree. After the timber was
reached more moderate councils pre
vailed and the mob contented itself with
whipping, pounding and kicking the un
fortunate official until he was hardly
able to move. He succeeded in reach
ing Belmont Crossing on foot, and ar
rived at Charleston on the Iron Moun
tain road late last night. Houser came
here from Chicago several years ago, and
was for a time editor of the Cairo Daily
Gazette, a Democratic sheet which had
a brief existence. Drifting to Wash
ington later, he was rewarded with the
position which so nearly cost him his
life.
Put It Out to Die.
New Yokk. Dec. 11.— Late Saturday
night an infant three weeks old was
found in a hallway in Eighteenth street.
It was taken to police headquarters.
This afternoon the mother of the child,
twenty years old, came to headquarters
and asked for her child. The foundling
was hers. Betrayed and penni
less, she had taken her child
to the home of her betrayer,
William George Mangold. He was not
at home, but his parents were. The
girl, whose name is Mathilde K. Heb
berting, told them her story of wrong.
They refused to support her babe, which
is the second child by their son, she til
leges, and left the babe on the floor and
left the house. The Mangolds put the
infant out and it was found as stated.
The Murderous Yaquis.
St. Lot is. Dec. 11. — Reports from the
Mexican frontier say the Yaqui Indians
have become so bold that the troops
have again been called out. The kill
ing of Cajenne did not stop their
warfare, but simply changed their
ladies. They have many able
leaders, and the plan now pursued by
them is to make raids in small bands
and not chancing a war by massing
forces. In some "instances they have
destroyed whole communities, run off
the stock and murdered the inhabitants.
They have committed robberies as far
north as Conaoita. Sonars. A detach
ment of cavalry has been sent to La
Bonita. but have so far proven of little
protection. JgE

A All lit) MENAGERIE.
Naturalized Frogs, Toads and
Chickens — A Dog's Tooth Ex
tracted.
A lady friend of mine, finding that
the circus has gradually been degener
ating, has started a menagerie, a kind
of parlor menagerie, says a writer in
the San Francisco Chronicle. She is
laying in a whole lot of animals suita
ble for a drawing room, and she is now
training a fawn to bow when a lady
comes into the room. She has gone
through experiments in naturalizing
frogs, toads, chickens, chipmunks and
sundry other animals, with great dis
appointment. These have not so far
proved any brilliant ability to behave
like American citizens, but she Is in
hopes still that she may get the hens to
lav bric-a-brac eggs and to evolve chick
ens in the latest fashionable combina
tion of colors.
She has been successful in developing
quite tinman traits in dogs. They take
medicine when they are sick, and they
behave just as sick as people do. The
other other day one of them got the
toothache. Wrapping his head in a
blanket, dropping toothache drops in
the tooth, applying the customary rem
edies used for humans had no died.
The doctor was called, and an ulcer
ated tooth was discovered. The dog
was more than human. lie put his head
ti]) on the doctor's knee, never squealed;
did not need to be held while the tooth
was being pulled.
'•Now, doctor, he'll have to get a false
tooth put in there. I cannot endure
such a hiatus in my poor dog's mouth.
And, doctor, I wish you'd just examine
them all carefully and tell me if he
hadn't better have some of them filled.-,'
"I CAXhOVK AND I CAN HATE."
A Hartford Belle of Twenty Sues
for Breach of Promise.
The breach of promise suit of Miss
Susie Carter against Bert Kay, of East
lladdam, Conn., is the talk for miles
around. The plaintiff, who is but
twenty years of age, has for some time
been considered one of the prettiest
young ladies in Middlesex county. The
defendant is one of the most prominent
manufacturers of coffin trimmings in
the country, and, while quite a young
man. is reputed to be worth more than
£200,000. .
The papers in the suit allege that on
July ID. 1887, Hay asked Miss Carter to
marry him. She agreed to do so, but
Ray has refused to carry out his part of
the' agreement, although requested to
do so. The papers call for the attach
ment of Bays estate to the extent of
520,000.
The wedding was to have taken place
about the middle of October. Miss Car
ter had prepared her trousseau, the
clergyman had been engaged and an
hour appointed for the ceremony. The
minister and invited guests had arrived
at the house and all was in readiness
for the nuptial event, when it was dis
covered that Bay was missing. There
was nothing to be done but dismiss the
guests. "I can love and I can hate,*'
said Susie to her friends when they
tried to comfort her.
Ray, it is said, will make a vigorous
fight'iii the courts.

A GROWING INDUSTRY.
Duluth's Position as a Lumber Center
and Future Prominent Market. .
SOME FACTS AND FIGURES.
A Review of the Work Done in the Trib
utary District— Manufacture and
Shipment at Cloquet.
Among the manifold interests which
are obtaining rapid development in this
vicinity there is not to be found a
greater than the lumber trade. As yet
huts swadling clothes, this industry is
a lusty infant, whose cries for recogni
tion jar somewhat unpleasantly on rival
interests where the rank of supremacy
is held to be of great value.
The forests of the Duluth district
(comparatively speaking) are untouched,
and billions of feet of the finest pine on
the continent are waiting for the advent
of the logger and the saw mill.
During the present year the cut of
lumber made by the nulls at Duluth,
Northern Pacific Junction, Thomson.
rower and Two Harbors has reached
the comfortable total of nearly 225,000,
--000 feet of pine lumber, 71,550,000 lath
and 70,550,000 shingles, beside a large
quantity of soft and hard woods which
are used for purposes outside of build
ing.
Upon the St. Louis river and its tribu
tary streams it is estimated by careful
and conservative men that there is now
standing at least 8.000,000,000 feet of
fine, high grade, merchantable pine,
which is easily accessible.
During the winter of 1887-88 the log
cut of the Duluth district is expected to
reach over 300,000,000 feet, and the lum
ber cut of ISS*** will amount to 810,000,000
feet if an ordinarily favorable season is
met with. There is at present a surplus
of about 30,000,000 feet of logs, which
did not reach the various mills on ac
count of low water and other draw
backs, one company in the district hav
ing 12,000,000 feet of logs in that predica
ment, and other companies having
smaller amounts.
At the various mills, in the lumber
yards and at the logging camps of the
district there are now about 6,000 men
employed, at wages which average
$28.60 per inenth to each man, and
about twenty-five firms manufact
ure, handle and dispose of the
product. By the close of the present
year the lumber output will have called
for 20,000 carloads, which will make
quite a lengthy train and take over 1,000
locomotives to handle it.
A glimpse at the exact figures of tho
manufacture and shipment of Cioqud,
the leading point of the district,
will give a better idea of the
vastness ol the industry than can
be secured by any other method. The
figures given being official and abso
lutely correct:

are at work for them in the woods.
Seven new saw mills, some of them
quite large ones, will go into the Du
