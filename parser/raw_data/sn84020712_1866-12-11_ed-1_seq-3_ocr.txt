THE WESTERN DEMOCRAT, CHARLOTTE, X. C
W. J. YATES, Editor and Proprietor.
CHARLOTTE. IV. C.
December 11, 18GG.
The President's Message. We publish,
in full, the annual Message of President John
son to Congress. Of course all our readers will
give it an attentive peiual.
The President does not seem to have chanjred
his position on the question of reconstruction,
but he does not allude to the Howard amend
ment. He still contends that members from the
Southern StaU's who can comply with the tests
of loyalty prescribed by Congress, ought to be
admitted to their seats in each House.
The Legislature. This body has been in
Bession two weeks, but has perfected very little
business. Last week a great deal of time was
occupied in ballotting fur Comptroller, and,
finally, Mr W. Uurgin of Buncombe count', was
elected in place of Gen. Brogden, the old in
cumbent. If there is any charge of incompe
tency against Gen. Urogdca we have never
heard it.
In the whole batch of State officers at Raleigh,
Gen. Brogdcn was the only member of the old
Democratic party in office, and now that he is
turned out, we hope those who have advised and
insisted on the proscription of democrats are
satisfied. We believe that party spirit has too
much influence with many members of the
Legislature. No one who differs with the ma
jority of that body (however slightly, or how
ever deeply he may be interested ic the welfare
of the State,) cannot expect to receive the
smallest favor or compliment. For our own part
yie will take occasion to say that we do not ask
or expect ar.y favors from those who rule or are
in authority at Raleigh or elsewhere. We have
been for peace and a speedy settlement of our
national difficuliios, while others who prnjea& to
be more loyal to the South have promoted strife
and contention.
A correspondent of the Wilmington Journal
(the Editor we presume), writing Irom Raleigh,
nays :
"Mr Whitfield, one of. the members from
Cleveland, has introduced a hill to enable the
Wilmington, Charlotte and Rutherford Railroad
to complete its road, pay its debts to the State,
and e xtend its load to the Tennessee line. The
bill is drawn in accoidance with the views so
ably urged in the rrpcrls of Col. Cowan, the
President of the Company, to the late meeting
of the Stockholders held in Wilmington.
Mr Love, the Senator from the extreme West
ern District, has introduced a hill to consolidate
all the roadi?, finished and unfinished, from Beau
fort Harbor to Duck Town and Paint Rock, to
be called the North Carolina Central Railroad
Company. This is a scheme to sir k ti e entire
value of the property owned by the Stute and
individuals in the North Carolina Railroad Com
pany one-half, to give some value to the Allan
tie Road, and the oth r to be wasted to no pur
pose upon the attempt to complete the Western
end of this mighty road nearly six hundred
miles in extent."
The House has passed a bill to enable the
Fayctteville and Western Railroad Company to
complete its Road to some point on the N. C.
Railroad.
Nf.w MAr.i3TitATE8. On Saturday lust the follow
ing new Magistrates were appointed for Mecklen
burg county by the Legislature:
For Charlotte Beat : Dr W J Hayes, S M Howell.
Taw Creek : Stephen Wilson, V A Cat hey. Clear
Creek : R R King, J L Phillips. Steel Creek : W
HNiel, S W Reid. D II Hart. Mallard Creek: A II
Cheshire, J V Mcore. Long Creek : A M Ban 3-.
Miming Star: R II Maxwell. Providence: J S Rcid,
T L Vail, W E Ardrey. Berryhill's: G V McDonald.
We see that a personal friend in the
Legislature did us the honor to nominate us for
one of the Councillors of State. Of course there
was no chance for our election, but we imme
diately wrote to a friend saying that we did not
want any office.
COTTON. Some weeks ago we mentioned the
fact that Cotton was brought to this market from
near Chenr.v. The Wadesboro Argus copied
the paragruph and was ungenerous enough to ex
press a doubt ns to the truth of our statement.
We madt the statement on the authority of one
or two cotton-buyers of this place, and it is true.
Lnst week there wis cotton sold in this intrket
brought from within 17 miles of Cheraw.
But we now merely want to inform the Argus
that last week we saw several loads of Cotton in
ur streets from Anson county, and some of it
from near Wadesboro. We hope our cotem
porary will not be offended. Truda is fast con
centrating at Charlotte.
Correction. Dr M. L. Brown, the Common
er from Lincoln, and W. P. Reinhardt, the Com
moner from Catawba, write us to correct the re
cord as to their votes on the Amnesty Bill before
the (Legislature. Their names were published in
our last issue as having voted against the bill,
when they voted for the bill. We copied the vote
just as we found it in one of the Raleigh papers.
T he error was not ours.
LF.Gov. Fierpont, of Virginia, in his Message
to the Legislature, favors the adoption of the
Howard amendment as the best terms of settle
ment the South will be able to get from the ma- !
jority that controls Congress. He thinks there 1
j great danger of g 'ing furfher and faring worse. I
itg-Wc return thanks to A B. Springs, Esq., !
ft member cf the South Carolina Legislature, for
inteiesting Legislative documents.

A Threatening Speech. Mr Thad. Steven?,
the leader of the Radical party in Congress, made
a speech in Washington last week, in which he
used this language:
"lie attacked the President with vigor, declar
ing that having been elevated iuto power through
an unexpected event visited upon the nation for
its sins, he now wished to be king instead of Pre
sident. Hisses. Mr Stevens said the war was
not over. Its main and final object was pursued
by the enemy with relentless energy. During
the war Jeff. Davis was commander-in-chief of
the Rebel army, with Lee as his chief adviser.
Now, Andrew Johnson was their commander-in-chief,
and poor old Wool was their chief-martial
adviser, and for the navy they had Semmes and
Welles. Laughter. J The people were to de
cide now whether they were to have Andrew
Johnson as President or as King, for they were
told they hud no other choice h ft. With Sheri
dan for a leader, and 23 or 50.000 colored soldiers,
they might defy Andrew Johnson and all who
might follow his lead. But if the time should
ever come when the conspirators would muster
audncity equal to their ambition, and. as once
happened in England, attempt to turn the regular
army against the people. Congress would not have
to rely on the Southern freedinen alone. The
men of the loyal North would spring to their feet
and unsheathe their weapons, as when they heard
the first booming cannon of Sumter.
Let Congress he bold, and the soldiers of the
last war would take care of the next, and the
usurper who leads the hostile forces would have
time and leisure to revise his boasted proclama
tion in one of too embrasures of Fortress Monroe.
Cheers. The usurper's head would rest much
more quietly, to be sure, on a hip-board and goose
than when oppressed with a crown. Laughter.
With less than impartial suffrage the South, with
his consent, .should never be reconstructed. He
would not be content with such peurile work as
universal amnesty and universal suffrage.'
Mr Stevens is certainly on his high horse, and
rears round generally. We shall sooc see what
we shall see.
m
Gross Extravagance The State Senator
from Halifax, Mr Wiggins, introduced in and
carried through that body a proposition fixing
the per diem of members of the Legislature at
six dollars per day. The pay of the Speaker
was arranged at ten dollars, as was also that of
other principal officers. Raleigh Progress.
After ineffectual attempts on the part of one
or two members of the House of Commons to
reduce the pay, that body adopted the figures
fixed by the Senate. Before the war, members
of the Legislature received just half these rates
A little recreation and fun now and then
is relished by the best of men, but it is to.be
feared that the young men of the South are
giving rather too much attention to Base Ball
playing and that species of frolicking known as
Tournaments. We read in our exchanges of
Tournaments in all directions, and glowing des
criptions are given of the horsemanship horse
racingj, the speeches, dinners, etc.
The resources of our young men, as well as
old men, were greatly crippled by the war, and,
since the abolition of slavery, it will require
hard work and close application on the part of
young men to "get a start in the world." A
working man who thrives will find very little
time to engage in tournaments and base-ball
placing. But everybody to their tastes.
... bb- m
BiS" John Surratf, said to be one of the prin
cipal actors in the assassination of President
Lincoln, has been arrested in Egypt, and will
be brought to Washington city for trial. When
first discovered, he was serving in the Italian
army. If convicted, it is to be hoped that he
will be allowed a little more time in which to
prepare to die than President Johnson allowed
Surratt's mother and others who were executed
in the summer of 1865.
Look Out. It appears that there is a chance
for Yankee gals to get husbands without coming
'down South." The Mormons propose to go to
Massachusetts and get a fresh 6upply .of wives.
Brighatu Young, in a late sermon at Salt Lake,
said :
''The last time I was in the city of Lowell
there were fourteen thousand more females than
males in that one city. That is many years ago.
They live and die in a single state, and are for
gotten. Have they tilled the measure of their
creation, and accomplished the design of heaven
in bringing them upon the earth '( No; they
have not. Two thousand good, God-fearing
men should go there, and take to themselves
seven wives a piece. It is written in the Bible,
''and in that djy seven women shall lay hold of
one man, saying we will eat our own bread and
wear our own apparel; only let us be called by
thy name, to take away our reproach." The
Government of the United States do not intend
that that prophecy shall bo fulfilled, and the
Lord Almighty means that it shall. Do you
not think that the Lord will conquer? I think
he will, and we are helping Him. It is the de
cree of the Almighty that in the last days seven
women shall take hold of one man, &c , to be
counselled and advised by him, being willing to
spin their own wool, make their own clothing,
and do everything they can to earn their own
living, if they can only bear his name to take
away their reproach. The female sex have been
deceived so long, and been trodden under foot
by man so long, that a spirit has come upon
them, and they want a place, and a name, and j
a head, for the man is the head of the woman, j
to lead her into the celestial kingdom of our
Father and God."
The Mormon who gets seven Yankee gals
tied to him will have a fine time the balance of
his life. There's no accounting for tastes.

whereas, certain persons are interested to misre
present the sentiments of the people of this State,
this Legislature representing the people, record
in solemn form as the sense of this Assembly that
the representations aforesaid are fal-e.
Mr Davis said that he knew of no disloyalty.
That persecution of Union men was untrue.
That partizan contests would always arise and
men ditfer. That no one could blame the peo
ple for their preferences. That if there was a
man in this State so base as to say her people
was disloyal he would brand him as a double
traitor. That persons interested in misrepre
senting North Carolina at present, formerly pre
tended to be good Confederates. How could the
people trust them 1 If any were disloyal, such
men were.
Mr Davis called for the yeas and nays.

man did not kuow the truth he could tell it him,
and call names. There was disloyalty in this
State and he was willing to say so. W. W.

was willing to tax the people, if there was no hell
in North Carolina for these men, to build a hell.

inflamed the Southern mind to the late war were
not worthy of confidence.
The amendment wa loafc.
Mr Lyon moved to postpone indefinitely.
Lost.
Mr Russ said he presented this resolution and
endorsed it. He held that any roan, who misre
presented North Carolina was unworthy of re
spect. He would vouch for the loyalty of our
people. The men who were attempting to preju
dice the Northern people against us. and overturn
existing affairs, were like midnight assassins at
tempting to rob your houses. He went on in that
strain for some time.
Mr Russ resolution was then adopted by 85
yeas to 14 nays.
Saturday, Dec. 8.

Wright, of New Hanover, Wm Eatou, jr., of
Warreu, and E. W. Jones, of Caldwell.
CONGRESS.
This body assembled on Monday the 3d inst.
1 he President's Message was read in both Houses.
One of the first things the House of Repre
sentatives did was to pass a bill, by a vote of
111 to 29, to repeal that section of the Act of
July 17, 1862, which authorizes the President
to pirdon those who participated in the "rebel
lion." A resolution was also passed, by a vote
of 107 to 37, directing inquiiy into the pro
priety of placing the Southern States uoder
Territorial governments.
Representative Bingham personally denies the
truth of a telegram circulated through the press,
that be was engaged in preparing articles of im
peachment against the President, on the ground
of complication in the assassination of Lincoln,
lie says he never had such a design, nor has he
ever so intimated.
In the Senate, on Thursday the Gth, Mr
Trumbull reported favorably from the Judiciary
Committee the bill of the House to repeal the
amnesty power of the President, and asked its
immediate consideration.
Mr Wilson gave notice that he would call up
next week a joint resolution to disband and pro
hibit militia organization in the rebel States.
In the House, on motion of Mr Kosson, the
Judiciary Committee was instructed to inquire
into the propriety of directing martial law to be
proclaimed in the counties in the rebel States
where Union men have been murdered, and the
laws not enforced against the murderers.
A bill to protect the rights of action of loyal
citizens was passed. It provides that where a
citizen who has plvvays been loyal shall bring ac
tion to recover damages, it shall not be defeated
or any defence allowed by virtue of the authority of
the late Confederate Slates.
Meeting of Radical. Members of Con
gress. Washington, Dec. 5. The caucus of
the Republican members of the House, held at
the Capital this evening, was very large, nearly
one hundred members being present. The fol
lowing measures, reported from the Select Com
mittee, were agreed upon:
First, to pass a bill regulating the organization
of the House, directing the Clerk to place no
names on the roll from States not represented
in the preceding Congress or declared entitled
to representation, and providing that no elec
toral votes shall be counted from any State not
represented at the time in Congress.
Second, to pass a bill remedying the defect in
the law which may prevent any State canvass
ing the votes for Electors of President and Vice
President.
Third, to pass a law changing the time of the
meeting ot Congress, with a view to assembling
on the fourth of March.
Fourth, to raise a special Committee for the
rigid investigation of the New Orleans riot, the
number of lives destroyed, the property burned
and to what extent Government officials were
included therein. The Committee to have power
to send for persons and papers, to be accompa
nied by the Sergeant-at-Arms, and to report ap
propriate legislation.
Fifth, to order a Select Committee to investi
gate the proceedings under the taws for the col
lection of direct taxes in rebel States, and the
securing and sale of abandoned and confiscated
lands and other property.
Sixth, the Committee on Pensions to inquire
whether any pensioners in the disloyal States,
struck from the pension rolls, have been restored
in violation of law.
Seventh, a special committee to investigate
the facts connected with the release of the mur
derers of Union soldiers in S. C , recently set at
liberty by the Delaware Judge.
A resolution passed unanimously that the
members of the caucus bind themselves to sus
tain the propositions as party measures. Mr
Ashley, of Ohio, said he noticed, present, a gen
tleman who had drawn the address of the Phil
adelphia convention, and asked if he was a mem
ber of the Union party, and had a right there
The Chairman, Mr Morrill, of Vermont, replied
amid laughter, "While the lamp holds out to
burn, the vilest sinner may return." Raymond,
on being asked whether he did not participate
in the Philadelphia Convention, replied, he had,
but not in any spirit of hostility to the Union
party; that he entered the Convention to
strengthen that party, thinking it should be
more conservative than it was, but when he
found it likely to lead to the defeat of the
Union party, he abandoned it and had ever
since done his best to maintain and support the
Union party. He also said he approved of the
measures reported here this evening. Mr. Sco
field moved that the gentleman be allowed to
remain in caucus or not at his option, and judge
for himself whether he was a member of the
Union patty or not. Mr. Lawrence, of Ohio,
asked Mr. Raymond whether he adhered to the
doctrine of the Philadelphia address, particu
larly to the clause that the rebel States could
not ratify the constitutional amendment with
out dishonor. Mr Raymond was understood to
deny there was such a clause in it, said he ad
hered to that address according to his own con
struction of if, but not according to the construc
tion sometimes put on it by others. Mr.
Stevens could not see how Mr Raymond could
pretend connection with the Union party , after
membership in the Philadelphia Convention,
and his authorship of the address put forth by
that body. Mersrs. Darling and Hall, of New
York, and Mr. Gai field, of Ohio, fa?ored Mr.
Raymond's remaining in caucus, and Mr. Mor
ris, of Ohio, and Mr. Cook were against it. Mr.
Raymond made further explanations with regard
to the Philadelphia address, whep the caucus
adopted Mr. coficld'i resolution.
