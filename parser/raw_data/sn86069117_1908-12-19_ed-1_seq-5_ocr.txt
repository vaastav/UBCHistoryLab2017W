Every voter in tho United States again
owes a debt of patriotic gratitude to President
Roosevelt. No one knows the average Sena
tor and Congressman better than Mr. Roose
velt and that there are scorces of them steeped
in vice and graft, the President and the Secret
Service are well aware and they can be spotted
at any timw. There are a lot of Congressman
now scared-half to death at what our President
had to eay in his message. There is already
talk to the effect that Congress is not
nearly so wratby as it was the day the
message came in and as the days go by it
may bo expected that by tho time the Com
mittee reports, the "censure" of the Executive
wjll not have to be written on asbesos. The
Congressmen learned that Chief Wlkie of the
Secret Service was in conference with the Presi
dent several hours Friday. Theodore Roose
velt means business, while the other fellows
are only out for a good time and the salary
tied to the job. v

JOHN BEUCB WOODWARD.
Many hearts were saddened yesterday eve
ning when tbe news was 'phoned over the
county, "John Bruce Woodward Is dead." yust
budding Into manhood, having been' born April
16th, 1889, it seems that be bad been called
too soon from a sister to whom ha was father,
mother and brother, their parents having le
them wben he was four and sbt a toddling babe
of two.
It was the happy privilege of their grand
parents, Mr. Brace Jones and wife, to rear tbem
both. Now that these two people are declin
ing tbe hill of life, it was but meet that they
should lean on their grandson and bis early de
mise removes the foundation of their hope and
home.
In September of this year John Bruce Wood
ward entered State University in the mechanical
engineering course. He bad been there less
than two months, when in tho gymnasium one
day he ruptured a blood vessel whilo using tbe
lung tester. On examination his physician
discovered tuberculosis to bo the seat of bis
trouble, then pnuemonia followed, through
which he made a heroic fight for life. As eoon
aa be was able to leave tbe hospital, be was
conveyed to his home, only to die In peace,
surrounded by his loved ones, prescribed for
by his faithful physician who had ministered to
him from infancy and cared for by his proficient
nurse. Besides his sister, who sees life so
dimly through her veil of tears, and bis dear
4grandparenta, he is mourned for by bis
uncles, Messrs. Isaac Woodward of this city,
Mr. John Woodward of Sardls, Charles and
John Jones of Fernleaf, and his aunt, Mrs. T.
B. Stroade of Germantown, and a host of
friends
Funeral will be from tbo Christian Church
in Germantown Tuesday morning at 10:30
o'clock, sun time. Burial In K. of P. Cemetery.
