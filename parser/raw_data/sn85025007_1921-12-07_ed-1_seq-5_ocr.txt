Extract from President
Madison's message to the Thir
teenth Congress of the United
States. The message, while
occupying a full page of an
"Extra" Gazette, concludes as
follows:
"'The war has proved, more
over, thaC our free government,
like other free governments,
though slow in its early move- .
ments, acquires in its progress
a force proportional t? its free
dom; and that the union of
these states, the guardian of
the freedom and safety of all
and of each, is strengthened
by every occasion that puts it
to the test.
In fine, the war, with all its
vicissitudes is illustrating the
capacity and the destiny of the
United States to be a great, a
flourishing and a powerful na
tion, worthy of the friendship
which it is disposed to cultivate
with all othei's; and authorized, ;
by its own example to require j
from all an observance of the I
laws of justice and reciprocity. ;
Beyond these their claims have
never extended; and, in con
tending for these, we behold a
subject for our congratulations,
in the daily testimonies of in
creasing harmony throughout
the nation", and may humbly re
pose our - trust in the smiles of
Heaven on so righteous a cause.
James Madison.
Washington, Dec. 7, 1813.
OPTIMISM RAMPANT
'f;
There are, multiplying evidences of
the fact th$t domestic business has
"turned the ;corner" and is gradually
but surely- emerging from tne defla
tion period ';that began about the
middle of ^ last -year, according to
the current ?fssue of T'he Guaranty
Survey," thg'r Guaranty Trust Com* i
pany of Nev^t York's monthly review
of business -and financial conditions.!
Two outstanding indications of the >
improvement j are cheaper money,
with its concomitant easier credit,
and the mojfe. or less widespread re
vival. "T^e Survey" says. in part:
"A building boom is sweeping the
country. There is decided 4 1 better
ment in the textile trades and the
rhoe and leather industries report!
progress. ) Our surplus copper is
gradually bjEjhg marketed at prices
that tend Upward. There is in
creased output of iron and steel, and
the railroad^!; are coming back into
the marked Business failures are
less numerous. Unemployment gen
erally is decreasing, and savings are
increasing. ?y
"The banks of the country have
been able, since the establishment of
Federal Reserve System to aid in
effecting a. more orderly general re
adjustment of industry 'following a
period of inflation than was possible
so long as . our banking system re
mained extremely decentralized. Such
service, particularly in the last year
and a quarter, was of incalculable
benefit to the nations business. But
tho avoidance of a general collapse
of credit, such as was repeatedly
experienced before the organization
of the Federal Reserve System, has
necessarily tended to prolong the
period of readjustment.
"Meanwhile, through the gradual
liquidation and utilization of accum
ulated stocks of commodities, the
way has been prepared in a number
of industries for an increased volume
of production for current consump
tion. The check to the downward
course of general prices in this
country and abroad has leasened the
incentive to defer contemplated pur
chases, and this condition supple
ments the depletion of hold over
stocks in creating an enlarged de
mand for current production.
"But much must be done to expe
dite better conditions. The malad
justment between the prices of farm
products and other commodities must
be eliminated before we can consider
liquidation as completed, or before
there can be a full measure of pros
perity. The tax burden must be moi%
equitably distributed, and the high
surtax rates reduced. The railroad
funding, bill should be passed as
early as practicable, to put the car
riers on their feet fnancially and re
establish railroad credit and opera
ting efficiency. In view of our
changed economic position, a perma
nent high protective tariff should
not be enacted to hamper our for
eign trade and prevent or indefinite
ly postpone, the liquidation of our
foreign debts. Every effort should
be made to assure the success of our
foreign debts. Every effort shoulq
be made to assure the success of the
Disarmament Conference, and there
by reduce tax burdens and eliminate
colossal economic waste. And finally,
we must assist other countries to re
turn to prosperity as quickly as pos
sible, largely through discriminating
foreign investments and long term
credits on an adequate scale.
" How prolonged will be the per
iod required for the complete re
sumption of the country's business
activity' on a normal scale must de
pend in considerable degree upon
the progress of industrial and firiar. \
cial recuperaton in other countries
which consume American products. ?
"The improvement in the financial
I situaton in this country since the
beginning of the reaction against in
flation has been pronounced and well
sustained. Since November 3. 1920,
when total discounts of the Federal
Reserve System were at their max
imum, and since December 23 when I
Federal Reserve note circulation was I
highest almost continuous progress j
has taken place in the technical po
siton of the banks. The gMtensive
liquidation reflected by the Reserve
System has been closely followed by
distinctly easier money conditions
?and a stronger investment market.
"Regardless of whether or not the
security markets accurately fore
cast the future of general business,
the recent remarkable improvement
in the money and investment mar
kets assuredly must have a benefic
ial effect on the fundamental ele
ments in the situation. A long time j
decline in money rates almost without
exception has been a sequel of great ,
wars; and the price of money, a real
factor in the cost of commodities, us
ually follows the downward trend of,
orice levels. The present situation '
is no exception.
"The chief cause of the rise in the
bond market is, of course, the de- !
cline in money rates. A special mar- j
ket factor at the present time is the
small supply of new issues, other
than municipals as compared with
the amount of capital seeking invest- 1
ment opportunities. A frequent com
plaint expressed by bond dealers is S
that their 'shelves are empty.' The
acuteness of the situation is accen- ,
tuated by the prevailing state of
business, the use of new capital for
construction and expansion being but
a fraction of what it formerly was.
The supply of funds for investment J
purposes consequently is unduly
large, temporarily at least. There
are other technical reasons serving
to maintain the high levels. Distress
selling, so prominent a year ago, j
has been practically eliminated and
sales in large, volume for income- ;
tax purposes arc unlikely, not only j
because the period of greatest strin- ?
gency is past, but also because in
come tax payments this year will- be
comparatively tsmall, _ especially on -
the patt fof corporation. 'Further- ;:
more, selling at present levels would
not establish, in genpral,. .losses on
issues purchased withinj
the last twelve .months.. , ... j
"The t specific pVppQS<lfs( of ? Secre-s
.tafry fiughds fdr~ tye' '{limitation .of
nay.al: armaments, by, the three drijef (!
naval powers have"' been accepted- ' in

Great Britain' and Ja^art.' : : '-And ' apV'j:
parently there is general confidence J
that a definite agreertiertt will be
reached for the execution of the plans i
in detail. \ ? ? * . iji
"The reduction of 1 governmental
expenditures in consequence of any
such drastic limitation ot" armaments
as is proposed, deluding suspension
of naval construction for a decade,
would represent a direct economic
saving of immense significance. The .
gains would not be -confined to the
mere alleviation of the , burden of
armaments upon, the taxpayers. On
the one hand, the nations concc rned
would be enabled to direct a lr.rger i
part of their public moneys to the j
support *of programs of industrial j
and social betterment; and on the j
other, any lessening of taxation;
would permit the Use of a larger '?
share of private earnings for ordi
nary business undertakings.
"In addition to the more immedi
ate results would be the psychologi- J
cal background, increasingly power- !
ful, developed by the continuing util-J
ization of economic resources less as
means for the destruction of life and
property, and more as agencies for
the conservation of life and the crca- 1
tion of wealth.
"Any measure of success which
may attend tho discussion of the del- j
icate and intricate problems of the
Far East would supplement in incal- i
culable degree the economic gains J
resulting from the limitation of arm- j
aments, for the removal of potential i
causes of international friction is an
aid in the principle of a concert o i
nations in dealing with Far Eastern
questions would facilitate the appli- ;
cation of the same principle,
through machinery for continuing -
conference, to other problems which
constitute a peril to the world's j
peace. Never before has there been
so nearly a universal acceptance of
i the principles which the Washington
j Conference is endeavoring to apply.
! With genuine hopefulness, therefore. I
j we may await its outcome."
