THE PRESIDENTS MESSASrV.
We give up much of our apace
tbia week to the message of.;l'rcsl
dent Grant. In the absence, of
reora for comment we will merely
say it is replete with such Informa
tion about the whole country as
the people will be anxious to read
It Is a plain, business-like : and
statesman-like review of tbe condi
tion of every department of the
government, and of their transac
tions during the last . year. -We
publish it almost; complete, oal
striking out a few of tbe least Inter
eating paragraphs.. It ought lo.be
read with care by all. It cannot
help but please and interest all in
the great amount of information It
contains, and tn its dignified, earn
sr,' and thorough discussion of the
needs of the eountrv. Also in ita
nrra determination of ite author
to InfArte the laws.
THE BOND PROPOSITIflX.
We shall urge nobody to vote for
or against the bond proposition for
another' railroad, next Tuesday,
The people are posted on the ques
tion. The whole gronnd has been
gone over freqneutlv. Let every
man vote as he thinks best .for the
future welfare of the county. ,Jr
We publish some coinmuuicatioua
in another column, on the question,
. wherein both sides are argued by
two of our oldest and most sub
stantlal citizen. It may be well to
observe, as au offset to "Allen
;rMKi ' figures, (not that we are
pleading for votes for- the proposi
lion.) that the railroads themselves
pay a considerable tax into the
i-oiinty. Last year, we believe,
they paid $18,000, In the twenty
eight years that the bonds are still
to run, at this rate, they would pay
to04,000, which is no mean item en
terlng into the figures on this ques
tton. : ' '
To-morrow. Saturday, the 7th of
December, Is the tenth anniversary
of the battle of Prairie Grove. It
was a great battle in iU conse
quences, deserving to be classed
among the decisive ones of the late
war. Hundreds of those who will
read this paragraph participated
and the mere mention of .the namer
will bring vividly to mind ita chief
incidents. Soldiers who were un
der'tire at Prairie Grove and after
wards at Franklin and Nashville
ay that tlie musketry fire of Prairie
Grove was far hotter and more
deadly than at either of the latter
battle.. Tbe 2d.Cth,tbt16tb.Uth

" '. ! 1 u i . . -THE
RAILROAD BOXD QUESTION.
Editor News: Your corres
pondents from Americas? Ilartford
and Reading appear somewhat ex
ercised over the prospect of this
county getting the Kansas City,
Emporia and Walnut Valley rail
road, and express very thin arga-
manta why the county bonds should
not be voted. . ,
(It has become a matter of history
la tbe Stai.thjLtfio railroad, oaa or
will be buflt without .aid, either
from the government or the people,
or both. The roads uow operating
14 tMe "county" received1 not-' only
large land grants.but generous tub-
scrlptions to their stock iuthe way
of countjrbonds. 1 ' " ' '' !
Those gentlemen who are now so
saueh.opposed to the Issue of any
more county-, bonds', v were, at the
time of vpting bonds vto aid tbe A,
T. k and At. K & T. roads.
when (hey thought their little towns
would bear the whittle of the loco
motive, earnest advocates of the in
debtedness, and I think the Ameri
cos correspondent has, since that
time, been advocating the issue of
township bonds for another railroad
enterprise ; ; therefore, it ' appears
that tbe Increased indebtedness is
not really the objection. Selfish
ness answers the .objection better.
. The idea that "townships had bet
ter assume tbe indebtedness if they
want any more roads, (.looks con
temptible. When several of the best
townships. In the' county are paring
a large portion of the ux, without
any direct "benefits to the towns, not
even being afforded stations or any
accommodations due them from the
railroads they .bare I so '. generously
aided,:, i.(.;:..'i:2i5 .-.?; .
The proposed road will not only
benefit Lyon coanty, but the entire
southwestern portion of the State
will have a short and direct , route
east, and the very small amount
asked from Lyon county should be
given freely to' aid this great enter
Prise, '
, " If it is not given eoon other lo
cauues stand ready to give tha re
quired aid and take what every clt
iten it ready to. admit is just the
road ifi. icuut.
I Toe Idea expressed by the Read
lag -rorrospondeut, that "the road
has got to come any way," and claim
ing to be ariend to railroads, but
don't want to pay for It twice, will
look very shallow to the enterpris
ing citizens of the county, who have
not adopted the policy of opposing
any measure they wish to teeurei
But with the Idea tha -the direct
east and. west road will eo perfect
our present railroad system. and advance-,
the material, interests of our
county, that it is worth at least as
much as the .other , roads have cost
the. county, and certainly cheap for
fhe amount of aid required.'.

h . . THE OTHER siDE.
. Exroaia News : I notice, in the
last issue of your valuable , paper, a
proposition for an election to au
thorire.our county commissioners
to Issue. $100,000 of county bonds,
and the transfer of railroad stock
bow in. possesslou ol the county
and for which we are indebted, n
sum not exceeding 1300,000, for 'the
construction of the Kansas' CIly
Emporia and- Walnut Valley rail
roaa tnrougn tne ..comity, i am
and. have always bee, friendly to
the introduction, of railroads, and
voted for the last bonds issued, as
an ultimatum; believing tnat, a we
then had no direct competition east
though at srreat cost, it would be
benefit to the , people, We have
now two direct lines of communl
nation with the east. What need
we more? ' It is claimed that in
creased competition will secure re
duoed freights, etv- This theory is
correct, yet the reduction of freight-
age; and fare that will be consequent
upon tbe construction of a third
road, will, in roy humble opinion
l)e sq slight as. scarcely totbe felt by
a great majority of those who pay
tb bulk of the taxes r'neBides, if
Emporia be an eligible1 peint, the
road will as surely-" pas by that
route without the- bond' as with
them. If we were ont of debl the
proposition might be seriously oou
aidered. .Let us glance at a part of

Quite a snug little sum to be can

there is a written proposition in the
handa of our commissioners, where
in certain parties give assurance
that, for one( third .interest . in tbe
stock of the' M,'K. & T. road, they
can render said stock worth Its par
value ; leaving to the county $133,-
333, thus " enabling us to cancel
bonds' to that amount; whereas, if
we transfer tnem to the new eoro
pany we will receive not leas than

and that only iu stoek of said new

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
To th Senate and Hfiuxt of Hep
resntatives: ". -
In transmitting to yon my fourth
Mnual mesoasre, it is with thankful
aess to the Giver of all good that as
a nation we have been blessed for
tbe last year with peace at home
and abroad, and a general prosper
ity vouchsafed to but few people.
With tbe exception of the recent
devastating fire, which swept from
earth, with a breath as it were, mil
lion! of accumulated whealttr of the
city of Boston, there have been no
overshadowing calamities within
the year to record. It is gratifying
to note "how, like their fellow-citizens
of Chicago, under similar clr
cumatanees, a year earlier, the citi
zens f Boston are rallying from
under their misfortune, .and the
prospect is that their energy and
heroism will overcome ail obstacles
and soon secure them the same pros
perity that, they would have had
had no disaster befallen them. Oth
erwise we haye been free from pes
tilence, war, -and other calamities,
which often overtake nations; and,
as fares human judgment can pene
trate tbe future, no cause tmi). to
exist to threaten our fnlnre.
- . ' THE. OKNKVA AWARD.
When congress adiourced in June
last, a question bad been raised bv
Great liritalu and was then pending
wmeb for a time seriouslv irooeni-
en the settlement by lneudly arbi
tration of the differences existing
between this government and that
of her Britanic mslcstv, and which
by the trestv of Washington had
been referred to the tribunal of ar
bitration whk-u mrt in Geneva,
Switzerland. " Tbe arbitrators, how
ever; disposed ot the question which
bad Jeopardized the- whole of the
treaty and threatened to involve the
two nations in most unhappy rela
tions toward eacij other iu a manner
entirely satisfactory to this govern
ment, and in accordance with the
views and policy which we had
maintained. The tribunal which
had convened in Geneva in Decem
ber, concluded its laborious session
on the 14th day of September fasi,
on which day, having availed itseit
of the discretionary power giveu it
by the treaty to award a sum in gross,
made its decision, whereby it award
ed $15,300,000 in gold as the indem
nity to be paid by Great Britain to
the United States tor satisfactiou
of all claims referred to its consid
eration. :
' This decision happily disposed ot
a long standing difference between
the two governments; and iu con
nection with another award, made
by the Germaif emperor, under n
reference to him by the same treaty,
leaves the two uovernmenfs with
out a shadow upon their friendly
relations, which it ii mr sincere
hope may forever; remain equally
unclouded..
The report of - the aycut of the
United States appointed to attend
the Geneva tribunal, ' aci-orupanied
by the protocols of the procecdinirs
of tbe arbitrators, the arguments of
the- council or both Kovernuiesitf,
the award of tho tribunal, and the
opiniona given by tho several arbi
trators, is transmitted herewith. I
have caused to be communicated to
the heads of three friendly powcr3
who complied with the joint request
made to them under the treaty, the
thanks of this government fcr tha
appointment of arbitrators made by
them respectively, and aleo my
thanks -to the emineut personages
namc( by them, ami my apprecla
mod . ei tne dignity, patience, im
partial y and great ability with
which they discharged their ardu
ous aud high functions. Her maj
esty's government has communicat
ed to mc its appreciation, y her
majesty, of the ability and indefat
igable industry displayed by Mr.
Adams, the arbitrator named on the
part of this government, during the
protracted inquiries and discussions
of the tribunal. 1 cordially unite
with her majesty In this apprecia
tion. It 19 due to the asicnt of the
I nited States before tho tribnna!
to record my high appreciation ot
the marked ability and unwearied
patience, and the prudence and di
eretion with which he has conduct
ed tbe very responsible and delicat
duties coinmmitted to him ; and it
is also due to the learned anil euu
nent council who attended the tn
bunal on tbe part of this govern
ment to express , my seuse of the
talent .and wisdom, which they
brought to bear iu the argument of
tbe result so happily reached
It will be the province of con
gress to provide for the distribution
among those who may be entitle
to it of the respectire shares or the
money to be paid. Although the
sum awarded is not payable until
year irom the date ot the award, it
is deemed advisable that no time be
lost in making a proper examination
or tne several cases in which in
damnification may ba due, Congo
queutly 1 recommend the creatio
of a board of commissioners for tit
purpose.
; VHK SAX Jl'AN IIOUNOARY
By the third and fourth articles o
the treaty of Washington, the re
apectlve claims of the United States
aud of Great Britain, in their con
struction of the treaty of tho 15th of
June, .18-10, defining the boundary
imo oeiween xneir respective terri
lories, were submitted to the arbi
tration and award of h-'s majesty th
emperor of Germany, to dec Mo
which ot these claims was most in
accord with the true interpretation
or the treaty of la lb, ice einpero
of Germany having been pleased to
undertake the arbitration, has tin
earnest thanks of this irovcrnmen
sad of the people of tho United
States, for the labor, pains aud caro
wnicn be has devoted to tbeconsid
etrtion of the long pending differ
ence. . j nave caused au expression
or my , man us to do communi
cated to him. Mr. Bauncroft
the representative of this govern
ment at JJerlin, conducted the
case and . prepared the state
ment on tho part of the United
States with the ability that his past
services jusiuieu me puDiic in ex
pacting at his hands. As a member
of the cabinet at the date of the
treaty, which has given rise to this
discussion between two govern
ments, as minister to Ureut Britain,
and as the agent and tbe represen
tative of the government to present
tha cose and to receive the award,
ta bas been associated with the
question in all of its phases, and in
every stage has manifested a patri
oue ceal and earnestness in the
maintenance of the claim of the
United States. He is entitled to
much credit for the suecess which
bas attended the submission. After
a patient investigasion of the case
and of the statements of each party,
His majesty the emperor, on the 21st
dv of October last, sizned his
award in writing,decreeing that the
claim of tbe government ol tbe I ni
ted States that the boundry line be
tween tbe territories of her Xirittan
ic majesty and of the I nited States
should be drawn through the Haro
channel is most in accordance with
the true interpretation of the treaty
concluded on the Lithof June, 1848.
between tbe agents or her Urittanic
majesty, and of tbe I nited to tales.
. Copies of the case presented on
behalf of each government, and of
the statement in reply to each, and
a translation of the award, are trans
mitted herewith. This award con
firms tha United States- in their
claim in the important archipelago
of Islanda lying between the conti
nent and j anconvera Island,
which' for twenty-six years, since
the ratification of the treaty, Great
Britain : has contested, and leaves
the United States for tbe first time
is tbe history or the country a a
nation, without a question of dis
puted boundary between, onr terri
tory and tha possessions of Great
Britain on this continent. It is my
grateful duty to acknowledge the
prompt and spontaneous actionofher
majesty's government in giving ef
fect to the award.- In anticipation
of any requests from this govern
ment, and before tha reception in
the - United States of the awards
signed by tho emperor, ber majesty
had given instructions' for .the re
moval of her troops, which had been
stationed there, and for the cessa
tion of all ciaims'of jurisdiction, so
u- to leave the United States in ex
clusive COMsssicro of the lately dis
puted terrlT. ."-J aU gratified i-to
on- able tcino&aMi o
tor tha removal of t&9 irpppa t have
pea txoagtta, ad tbpj&t WW'
ry occupation of San Joan has
ceased. The islands are now in the
exclusive possession of tbe United
States. ; It now becomes necesaarv
to Complete the uirtAv and
determination of that portion
of the boundary line through the
Haro channel, upon which the com
mission who determined the re
maining part of the line were una
ble to agree. I reeammond the ap
pointment of a commissiou to act
jointly with oue which may be
named by her majesty for that pur
pose. Experience of tue difficul
ties attending the determination of
our admitted line Of boundary al
ter the occupation of the territory
and its settlement by those owing
allegiance to the respective govern
ments points to the importance of
esiaoiisiiiuir, dv natural obiecU or
omer monument?, the actual line
Detwcen the territory acquired by
purchase from lluseia and the ad
joining possessions of her Brittanic
majesty. The region is now so
sparsely occupied that no conflic
ting interests of individuals or of
jurisdiction are likely to interfere,
to the delay or embarassment of the
actual location of the liue. If de
ferred until the population shall en
ter and occupy tho territory, some
trivial contest of two neighbors
may again array tbe two govern
ments in antagonism. 1 therefore
recommend the appointment of a
commission to. act jointly with one
that may be appointed on the part
of Great Britain, to determine the
line between our territory of Alas
ka aud the C3tcrmiual possessions
oflireat Britain.
The President ucxt notices the
satisfactory tettlemcat of therfish
cry questions at issue between this
government and British North
America.
I :
DUE KL'ROl'EAN UEI.ATIOXS.
With France, our earliest alley;
liusfcia, the constant and steady
friend of tho United Slates ; Ger
many, with whose government and
people we have so many causes of
lrieudship; and the other uatious
oi A.urope, our relations are main
tained on the most friendly terms.
Since my last message, the exchange
has been made of a treaty with the
Austrian-Hungarian empire rela
ting to naturalization ; also of a trea
ty with tho Germau empire respec
ting commercial aud trade marks;
also of a treaty with Sweden and
Norway relating to naturalization;
aliof which treaties have been duly
proclaimed.
The international statistical con
grs,' was properly 'attended by
rcprcstatiyus -'from this country.
This congress meets at intervals of
three years, and the IVcsidont sug
gests the propriety of inviting it to
meet in this country at the tinn of
our national centennial celebration.
INTERNATIONAL FX POSITION.-
The preparations are making for
the international exposition to bo
held during tho uext year, in Vien
na, on n scale of very great magni
tude. The tendency of these expo
sitions Is in the direction of advan
ced civilization, and the elevation
of industry and labor and of the in
crease of humau happiness, n& well
as of greater intercourse aud good
will between nations. As this ex
position is to be the first which will
havo been held in eastern Europe,
it is believed that American inven
tors and manufacturers will be rea
dy to avail themselves of the op
portunity for the presentation of
their productions, if encouraged by
proper-aid and protection.
The President recommends un ap
propriation to pay tbo expenses of
one or more agents ti the above
exposition, aud also that the secre
tary of the Navy lu authorized to
lit up two vessels for the transpor
tation of articles to Vinnna and
back, for exhibition.
.MKMt'AX Al-IAIKS.
inee your last session, the presi
dent of the Mexican republic, dis
tinguished by his high character
and hy his services to his country
has died. His temporary successor
has now been elected with great
unanimity, by the people, a proof of
confidence on their part in his pa
triotism which it is believed will
be continued by the results of his
administration. It is particularly
desirable that nothing should be
left undone by the government of
either republic to strengthen their
relations as neighbors and friends.
it is much to be regretted that
many lawless acts continue tcr dis
tract the quiet of our rettlement on
tho border betweeti our territory
and that of Mexico, and that coin
plaints of wrong to American citi
zens in various parts of the conntry
are made. Tho revolutionary con
dition in which our neighboring re
public has so long been involved
has in some degree contributed to
this disturbance. It is to be hoped
that with a more settled rule of or
der in the Mexican republic, which
may be expected lrorn the preseut
government, the acts of which just
complaint is mado will cense
The proceedings of the commis
sion under the convention - with
Mexico of the tith of July, 1S68, on
the subject of claims, have noio in
timately been checked by an obsta
cle for the removal of which meas
ures have been taken bv the two
governments which it is believed
will prove successful.
The commissioners appointed.
pursuant to the joint resolution of
congress ot the t ih ot May last, to
inquire into tho depredations outhe
Texas frontier, have diligently made
invo ligation in that quarter. Their
report upon the subject will be com
municated to you. Their researches
were necessarily incomplete, partly
on account of the limited appropri
ation made by congress. Mexico
has appointed ft similar commission
to. investigate the so outrages. It is
not, annouueed officially, but the
press of that county states that the
fullest investigation is desired and
thnt the co-operation of all parties
concerned is invited to secure that
end. I therefore recommend that a
special appropriation hi made at the
earliest day practicable, to enable
the commissioners on the part of
the United States to return to their
labors without delay.
TUG ll'BAX SITPATION.
It is with regret that I have again
to announce a continuance of the
disturbed condition of the islaud of
Cuba. No advanco toward tbe pac
ification of tho discontented part of
ine population has Deen made, while
the insurrection has gained no ad
vantage and exhibits no more of the
clement) of power or the prospect
of ultimate success than were ex
hibited a year ago. Spain, on the
other hand, has not succeeded in its
repression, and the parties stand ap
parently iu the same relative post
tiou which they have occupied for a
long time past. This coutest has
lasted now for more than four years,
Were it seen at a distance from our
neighborhood, we might be indiffer
eut to its results, although humanity
could not be unmoved by many of
its incidents, wberever tbey might
occur, ii is, nowever, at our door.
I cannot doubt that the continued
maintenance of slavery in Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to
the strife. A terrible wronsr is the
natural cause of a terrible evil.
The abolition of slavery and the in
troduction of other reforms in the
administration of the government
of Cuba, conld not fail to advance
tbe restoration of ocace aud order.
It is especially to be hoped that the
present iiDerat government of Spain
will voluntarily adopt this view.
Tho law of emancipation, which
was passed more than two years
since, nas remained unexecuted. In
tne absence or regulations - for ita
enforcement, it was but a feeble step
luwarui BUliucipnuon ; out it was
the recognition of right, and was
hailed as such and exhibited Soain
n harmony with the sentiments nr
oumanuy ana or justice, and in
sympathy with the other powers nf
aoe nristian ana civilized world.
Within the past few weeks tha
nlations for carrying out the law of
emancipation nave been announced,
giving evidence of the aiaoareitT r
the intention of tha present govern
ment to carry into effect tha law r
1870.- I have not failed to nrsre th
ibonsideraUon of the wisdom of the
policy, ana toe justice of a more ef
factiyo.aystem for the abolition of
fit great evil which oppresses m
race and continues a bloody and
destructive contest close to our
borders, aa well as tho expediency
and the justice of conceding reforms
of which the propriety is not ques
tionable. Deeply impressed with the con
viction that the continuance of slav
ery is one of the most active causes
of tho continuance of the nnhanpy
condition in Cuba, I regret to be
lieve that citizens of the United
States, or those claiming to be such,
are large holders in Cubu of what
i there claimed to be property,
but which is forbidden and de
nounced by the laws or the
L nited States.. They are then,
m . defiance of the spirit of our
own laws, contributing to . the
I continuance of that distressing and
it..cuiiig contest, in my last an
nual message I referred to this sub
ject, aud 1 again recommend such
legislation as may be proper, if not
to prevent, at least to discourage
American citizens from holding or
dealing in slaves.
liur relations with Spain and
the Allied Republics is peaceful ; so
with Brazil and the' Argentine Re
public; the message urges steps to
compel the payment of .the claims
against Venezuela, which still re
main unsettled.
OCK RELATIONS WITH JAPAN - AND
CHINA.
Our treaty relations with Japan
remain unchanged. An imposing
embassy from that interesting aud
progressive nation visited this coun
try during the year that is nagg
ing, but being uprovided with pow-
eru lor me Bigmug or a convention
in1 this country no conclusion in
that direction was reached. It is
hoped, however, that tbe inter
change of opinion which took
place during their stay in this coun
try has led to a mutual appreciation
of the iuterests which may be pro
moted wheti the revision of the
existing treaty shall be underta
ken. In this conuectiou, I renew my
icvuiuuienuauoii oi one year ago,
that to give importance and to add
to the elliciency of our diplomic re
lations with Japan and China, and
lo further aid in retaining the good
opiui an of these people, and to se
cure to the United States its share
of the commerce destined to flow
between these nations and the bal
ance of the commercial world, an
appropriation be made to support
at jeusi lour American youths in
each of these countries, to serve as
a part ot the official family. Our
ministers and representatives
would then be placed unon an
equality with the representatives of
tit-eat .Britain and some other pow
ers. As now situated, our repre
sentatives in Japan and China have
to depend for interpreters and trans
lators upon natives of those coun
tries, who kuow our language im
perfectly, or procure for the occas
iuu me services oi employees in
foreign business houses, or tho in
terpreters of other foreign minis
ters.
The President renews his recom
mendation to transfer tothelnte
rior department, from the State de
partments, all Territorial affairs,
where they seem appropriately to
belong.
He reommends that farther steps
be taken, and money appropriated
for the relief of distressed citizens
of th U. S. in foreign countries.
TRANSPORTATION TO THK 8K ABOARD.
The attention of congress will be
called, during its present session, to
various enterprises lor the more cer
tain anc cheaper transportation of the
constantly increasing surplus ot west
ern and southern products to the At
lantic seauoaru. ine subject is one
that will torce Itself upon the leirisla
tive branch of the government sooner
or later, and I suggest that means be
taken to gain all available information
to aid Inevitable and just legislation.
A route to connect the Missouri valley
with the Atlantic, with Charleston, 8.
C, and Savannah, Ga., by water", by
way oi ine uuiu sua xennessee rivers
un d antds and slackwater navigation,
and to the Savannah and Ocwulgee
rivers, has been surveyed, and a re
port made by a competent engineer
officer of the army. Second and third
new routes will be proposed for the
consideration of congress, namely
by un extension ot the Kauawa and
James river canal to the Ohio, and by
tbe extension or the Chesapeake and
Ohio canal. I am not prepared to rec-
enunenu government aid to these or
other enterprises, until it u clearlv
show that they are not only of nation
al interest, but when completed of a
value commensunrtevwiUi their cost.
That production increases more rapld-
ij umii lug lucuiii vi iraucpuriauon in
our country, has been demonstrated by
pa-st experience. That the rapid
growth in productions and population
ot the whole will require additional
facilities and cheaper means for the
more DiiiKy matters ot commerce to
reach tnie water and market, will be
demanded in the near tuture, is equal
ly demonstrable. 1 would therefore
suggest mac euuer a committee or
commission be authorized to consider
this whole question and report to con
gress at some luture day tor its better
guidance in legislating on tbia impor
tant subject. The railroads of the
country have been rapicly extended
within the past few years to meet the
growing demands of producers, and
reflect much credit upon the capitalists
and managers engaged in their con
struction. In addition to these, a protect to
facilitate commerce by the building of
a nip cauiu Kroiinu .Magara r ails, on
the United States side, which has been
agitatod for many years, will no doubt
be called to your attention this session,
looking to the great future of the
country, the increasing demands of
commerce, it might be well, while on
this subject, not only to have examin
ed and reported upon the various prac
ticable routes for connecting the Mis
sissippi with tide water on the Atlan
tic, but tbe feasibility of an almost
continuous land lock navigation fram
Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Such a
route along our coast will be of great
value at all times and of inestimable
vaine in case ot a foreign war. Na
ture bas provided the greater part ot
this route, and the obstacles to be
overcome are easily within the skill ot
engineers. I have not alluded to the
snbject with a view of having any
further expenditure of the public mon
ey at this time than may be necessary
to procure and place all the necessary
iniormation petore congress in an au
thentic form, to enable it hereafter, if
ueemeu practicable and worthy, to leg
on me suoject wiuiotu delay.
TAE NAVAL DEPARTMENT.

navy, nerewuti accompanying, ex

for the same. It also srives a comnlotA
history of the services of the navy for

services.
iv, u cviuent mat unless steps are
taken to preserve our navy, in a very
few years the United States will be the
weakest nation npon the ocean of all
the great powers. With an energetic,
progressive, busine9"people like ours,
penetrating to, and forming business
relations with, every part of the known
worm, a navy strong enough to com
mand respect for onr flag abroad, is
necessary Tor the protection of their

THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT.
iue accompanying report of tbe
postmaster general furnishes a full and
satisfactory exhibit of the one rattans
of the post-office department during
the year. The ordinary receipts of the
department for the fiscal year end in z
xons ou, xoi, Bioount lO fzl,yia,4:i6,
and the expenditures 126,638,132.
Compared with the previous fiscal
year the increase of receipts was
787,380 or 9-37 per cenU and tha in.
crease of expenditures 26,0i8 or
9-29 per cent. Adding to tbe ordinary
revenues tne annual appropriation of
uu,uuv iot ireo mailer, and tbe
amount paid to the subsidy on mail
steam ship lines from special appro
priations, the deficiency paid oat of
the general treasury was f 3,3 17,705,
an excess ot $489,107 over the defleien.
ey for tbe year 1871. -
Other interesting statistical infor
mation reiaunz to our ranldlv ax t rul
ing postal service is furnished in this
report. The total length of rahrosd
mail routes, on the 30th of June, 1S72,
was 57.911 miles. 8.07T additional mil..

Atlantic mail ateainsbip service, was
$220,300. .The total ot the United
States ocean steamship sendee includ

lines of mail steamers, was $1,027,020.
Our postal communications with all
parts of the civilized World have been
placed upon the most advantageous
looting by the improved postal 'con-'
ventions and arrangements rewntiv
concluded with the leading commer
cial countries of Europe and America;
uu uie graiuying statement Is made
that with the conclusion of a satisfac
tory convention with France, agreed to
by tha head of theFrench postal depart
ment, subject to the approval of tbe
minister of finance, little remains to
be accomplished by treaty lor some
time to come.
THE CARRYING TRADE. ;
The report of the secretary ol the
treasury will show an alarming falling
off in our carrying trade for the last
ten or twelve years, and- even for the
past year. 1 do not believe that pub
lic treasure can be better expended in
the interest of the whole people than
in trying to recover this trade. An
expenditure of five million dollars per
annum for the next five years, if It
would ret tore to us our proportion of
the carrying trado of the world, would
be profitably expended. The price of
iaoor in r.iirope nas Deen so much en
hanced within the last lew years that
the cost of building and operating
ocean steamers in the United States is
not so much greater than in Europe
that I beiiove the time has arrived lor
congress to take this subject into seri
ous consideratiou.

$99,960,253. This statement treats
solely of the principal of the public

THE KU-KLVX.
Beetles and lawless
to say, have associated themselves to
gether in some localities to deprive
other citizens of therisrhts marantMxi
by - the constitution of "the United
States, and to that end have commit
ted deeds f violence ; but the arrest
aud punbhmunt or many of these per
sons have tended greatly to tbo su
pressionot such disorders. T do not
doubt that a great majority of the peo
ple in all parts of. the country, favor
the rull enjoyment, by all persons, of
the rights to which they are entitled
under the constitution and the laws,
and I invoke the aid and influence ot
all good citizens to prevent organiza
tions whose object i., by unlawful
means, to interfere with these rights.
I look with confidence to the time, not
far distant, when the obvious advan
tages of good order and pence will
induce an abandonment of all combi
nations prohibited bv the act refornwl
to, and when it will'be unnecessary to
lshments to protect citizens from the
J wA I'nxjcCUllODS ir ' inn ipr ntm-
lawless doinrs of such mmhin.iiAn.
Applications have been made to me to
pardon persons convicted of violations
of such acts upon the ground that
clemency in such cuses would tend to
tranquuize tho public mind; and to
less me virtue or that policy, f am dis
posed, as tar as my sense of justice
will permit, to give these persons a fa
vorable consideration, but any action
thereon is not to be construed as indi
cating any change In my determina
tion to enforce the laws with vigor so
long as the conspiracies and combina
tions therein named disturb the peace
of the country. It is much to be re
gretted, aud is regretted by no one
more than myself, that a necessity has
ever existed to execute the eulorce
mentact. No oue can desire more
than 1 that the necessity of applying
it may never again be demanded.

THE INDIANS,
The policy which was adopted at the

regard to the mauagemcnt of the In

most ardent friends anticipated within

THIS CEN:A.!f." 1 -
The ninth census Is about completed.
IU completion is a subject of eongratula
tiau. Inasmuch as tbe use tn be made of
the statistics therein contained depends
very greatly upon the nromptitnde or pub
lication. .-. . .
The secretary of the interior recom
mends that a census be taken in 1875.
which recommendation should receive the
ready attention of eongre. The interval
at present established between the feder
al censuses is so long that tho information
obtained at the decimal peried is to the
material condition, wants and reKurees
of the nation is of little pmrtical value af
ter the expiration of the tirct half of that
period. It would probalily obviate the
coni-titution.il provision regarding the ue
cenial census, if a cennus." taken in lsrr.
should be divested of nil political Chirac- !
ter, and no reapportionment of congres
sional repreNcntation lie made under it.
Such a census, coming a it would in the
Inst year of the first century of our nation
al lile, would furnish a noble monument
of the progress of the United States during
mat I'cfiitirv.

TUB MORMONS. ' I
Affairs in the territories are generally
satisfactory. The enenry and business ca
pacity of tbe pioneers who are settling up
tbe vast domains not yet incorporated in
to states, are keeping pace in internal im
provements and civil government with
the older communities. In but one of the
territories, Utah, is the condition of affairs
unsatisfactory, except fo far as the quiet
ofthecitizens mav be disturbed by real or
imaginary danger of Indian hostilities. It
his seemed to be the policy of tbe legisla
ture or Utah to evade all responsibility to
the government of the United States, and
even to hold a position in hostility to It. 1
recommend a careful revision ot "the pres
eut laws of the terri tory hy congress, and
the ensetment of Mich a law as the one pro
posed in congress at its laat session, or
something similar to it, that will secure
peace and the eqtmliry of all citizens be
fore the law, and the ultimate extinguish
ment of polygamy.
THI AOftlCLI.TUItAI.BL'BBAV. ,
The report of the commissioner of agri
culture gives a very full and Interesting
account of the several divisions of that de
partmentthe horticultural, agricultural,
statistical, entomological and chemical
and tne benefits conferred by each on the
agricultural Interests of the country. The
whole report is a complete bistorv of the
workings of that department In : nil its
branches, showing the manner in
which the farmer, merchant and
miner Im Informed, and the extent
to which he is aided in his pur
suits. The commissioner makes one rec
ommendation, viz: that inensures be ta
ken by congress to protect and induce the
planting of forests, and suggests that no
part of the public lands should be dispos
ed of without the consideration that one
tenth of it he reerved in timber where it
exists, and where it does not exist that
inducements shonld be offere- for plant
ing It.
CIVH. SKRVICK RFKO&M.
Au earneM. desire has been felt to cor
rect abuses which nave grown up In the
civil service of the country through the
defective methods of making appoint,
menu to ollice. These appointments have
been regarded too mnsli a tbe reward of
political service. Under theautuorily of
congress, rules have been established to
regulate tho terms of ollice and tbe mode
of appointments, it cannot be expected
that any .system of rules can be entirely
effective, aud prove a perfect remedy for
tbe exUtiug evils until they have 'been
thoroughly tested by actual practice and
amended a xordini; to tbe requirements of
the service, llurins my term of oliice it
fchall be my best eudeavor to so apply the
rules as to tec ure the greatest possible re
form in the civil service of the govern
ment; but it will require the direct action
f congress to render the enforcement of
tbe system binding upon sny successors;
and I bopo that Uie experience of the past
year, together with appropriate legisla
tion by congress, may reach a satisfactory
solution of this question, and secure to
tbe public service, for all time, a practical
method of obtaining faithful and ctiicient
officers and employees.
