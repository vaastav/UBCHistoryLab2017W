GENERAL ORDERS, No. 97.
Information taving been received at
these headqaartera that the rebel marauders
who were guilty of murder and robbery tX
St. Alban", haye been discharged from a -reet,
acd that other enterpriftesare actually
in preparation in C-uiadt, the Command
ing General deems it due to the peop'e of
the frontier towns to adopt the most prompt
and efficient measures for the security of
their lives and property. All military
commanders on the frontiers are therefore
instructed, in cue further acts of depreda
tion and murder are attempted, whether
by marauders or by persons acting under
commissions from tbe rebel authorities at
Richmond, to shoot down the perpetrators,
if possible, while in the commission of
their crims, or, if it be necessary with a
view to their capture to cross the boundary
between tbe United States and Canada,
said commanders are hereby directed to
pursue them wherever they may take
refuge, and, If captured, they are under
no circumstance to be surrendered, but are
to be sent to these Headquarters for trial
and punishment by martial law. The
Major General commanding the Depart
ment will not hesitate to exercise to the
fullest extent the authority he posteeser,
under te rules of law recognized by all
civilized States, in regard to persons organ
izing hostile .expeditions within neutral
territory and' fleeing to an uylum after
committing acts of depredation within our
own, such an exercise of authority having
become indispensable to protect our cities
nd town from incendiarism and our peo
ple frost robbery and murder. It is earn
estly Doped teat tne lnnaDitantsoi our iron
tier districts and towns will abstain from
retaliation on account of the outrage com
mitted by rebel marauders, and that the
proper measures of redress will be left to
the action of the public authorities.

Mr. Grimes reported form the Naval

Mr. Trumbull also reported a bill, au
thorizing tee holding of a special sas-l jd
diana. The bill was passed.
Mr. Chandler I see in the morning pa
pers the following announcement from
Toronto: " The KL Albans raiders nave
bean discharged for want of jurisdiction.
I desire to offer a couple of resolutions
bearing upon tne subject, one oi tnem par
ticularly, but I do not expect to make the
Senate understand the state of feeling. I
have a great number of letters from gen
tlemen living on the border in my own
city, which is witnin musket range ot me
Canadian shore. Thousands of citiJens
have been under arms for a long time.
We have been in a continual sUte of
alarm from incendiaries, burglars and rob
bers. From this announcement it would
seem that the Canadian authorities have
made up their mii.ds to protect these rob
bers. AS I understand it, a man comes
from the South with a commission, pur
porting to be issued by Jen. Dana, lie
enlists his robbing fames, crosses tbe
borders, murders and robs whom
he pleases, and returns to Can
ada where he sa protected. These
letters which I have in mv possession, are
all bearing upon this point. The one in
my band now, is uom one oi tea most re
e&eetable citizens of Detroit, a gentleman
of great wealth and of high political and
social position, who earnos-iy desires to
avoid any difficulty with Great Britain at
this time. He says: 'The anxiety grow
ing out of the mist and doubt, including
every rumor that reaches ns, is not to be
endured, and, if upon some slight provoca
tion, our people shall be found in Canada,
in some act that the Canadian Government
will say is wrong, sooner or later, wr will
be the result." He says also, "WU1 you
give this subject your immediate attention,
for I think it involves, sooner or later, if
no' rightly managed warwith Great Britain.
i.'r. President, I haye no expectation of
making: the Senate comprehend the state
of excitement thus announced, and the
state of feeling on that border. Vermont
may, for aught I know, quietly submit to
have her towns robbed and ber citizens
murdered, but the Northwest will net. I
offer this resolution:
Whbbu, Beca.t raids have be jn organ-
ized in the Canadas and Nova Scotia, and
men enluted in said British Provinces by
men purporting to hold commissions from
the rebels for murdering and robbing
peaceable citizens of the L nited States, for
burning cities and villages, for piratically
capturing merchant vessels and mur
dering their officers and crer?, and for a
general system of murder, arson, robbery
and plunder of peaceable and unarmed
citizens othe United States; and Wmeri-
as, Tne peop. oi tne critisa rrovmcer,
seem disposed to protect these thieves, rob
bers, incendiaries, pirates and murderers,
not only in their individual capacities, but
by the quibbles of law, therefore,
Resolved. That the Committee on Mili
tary Affairs be directed to inquire into the
expediency of enlisting an army corps to
watch and defend our territory bordering
on the lakes and the Canadian line from
all hostile demonstrations and incursions.
Mr. Johnson. I object to the resolu
tion.
Tbe President. Tiro tern. The resolution
will lie over, objection being made.
Mr. Chandler. 1 had hoped Were would
be no objection to it. I will new oner
another resolution, which I a-k to be re
ferred to tbe Committee on commerce.
The resolution was received, and is aa
follows:
WHZfcZaA, At the commemeannt of
the present rebellion the Unittd Slates
were at peace van ail tne goveri m mis oi
tba world, and on terms of comity and
good will with Great Britain; and
Wbibias, That nation, before the arrival
on ber soil of our Minister accredited to
the Administration of President Lincoln,
precipitately acknowledged the rebels as
hnllicrflrenta. thus recoeniEinsr their Sic
upon tbe oaeao, without which recognition
. ... i jj j . . j
It would nave oeen regaraeu ana ireaitu
as piratical by all other powers; and
Whcbeas, She then proclaimed perfect
neutrality between a republic with which
she had eBtartained friendly relations for
uDward of half a century, and Its treason
able subject,- and Whibkas, Numbers of
ber subjects, with the full knowledge of
her neutrality, commenced fitting out fast
sailing Tessais, loaded with munitions of
war, for thr purpose of running into our
blockaded ports lor the rebels, thus fur
nishing them the means of organising and
carrying on tha rebellion, a.nd without
which it could not nave sustained welt tor
six months; and Wbibxab, in addition to
tbe above and with the knowledge of the
Government British subjects and members
of Parliament are engaged in the manu
facture of piratical Jfroglish ship;, owned
by British subjects and manned by British
seamen, and sailing under British colors,
for the purpose of burning, destroying and
utterly driving from the ocean all peaoaful
vessels sailing under ihe United States
tag; uid Wbsbbaa, Many private and
unarmed American ships have been
burned and destroyed by these pirates
from English ports, thus pausing great
loss And damage to the citizens of (he
United States ; therefore,
fK2te4,That the Secretary of State be in
structed to mace out a list or eacn cargo
thus destroyed, with a lir and seperate
valuation and interest at the rata of six
per cent, per annum from the date of tbe
c&ntnre or detention to the data of rjresen-
tation, and that he be directed to demand
from the British Government payment in
full for all such vessel or cargoes destroy
ed as aforesaid.
Mr. Johnson objected to the resolution,
which was laid over.
Mr. Doolittle wished to nave the resolu
tion in relation to taxation, offered by him
on Monday, taken from the table and re
ferred to tbe Committee on Finance.
Mr. Doolittle said, I desire to call tbe at
tention of the Committee on Finance to
the special point mentioned, without at all
entering into a discussion. . The resolution
instructs the Committee tj inquire into tbe
propriety of a tax on all sales of both real
and peiaonal property, according to the
best estimate that can be made. The
smallest amount that would be produced b
this tax would be $75,000,000 a year, i
not only proposes a tax upon sales actually
made, but upon all wno sell stocks, g)ld or
produce, it win nave more of a restrain'
ing enact on the speculation in gold
tnan any gold bills -which can be passed,
which shall make it a penal offence to sell
gold in the market,-or make any distinc
tion Deiwean goia ana paper currency, it
also proposes that the Committee shall in
quire into the propriety of adding a tax of
tweniy-nve per cent, on all railroad fares
of the country, including street-railroads,
steamboats and ferries, making such com
panins gatherers for the benefit of the
Government. This is a source of income
and revenue which is the most immediately
acveKiuie ox any upon wniun ice
Government can lay its hands, which
would be received in large Quantities
from powerful companies, whose revenues
would Dee:mo immense. This Is the time
when we should seize hold of these mean,
which will produce revenue for the money
we. must nave. Annhtr point in the
resolution is, simply to inquire whether
is not best to prevent the organization
JH
any new banking companies, allowing at
the same time, these babks now in eiUt-
ance to withdraw their circulation and to
go into operation under the general bank-
me taw.
Mr. Doolittle then explained the fourth
provision of his resolction, in reference to
tne substitution ot ctcer interest bearing
notes now in circulation.
Mr. Sherman Before a vote is taken. I
would like to say a word or two. I have
no objection to the reference ot the resolu
tion, but will state that the Committee on
Finance have already this subject under
conn deration, as recommended by tbe Sec
retary ot tne Treasury in his annual report,
and by the President of the United States
in his annual message. All the points at
i'sue will be considered in the Committee
without any resolution on the subject,
Mr. Sherman explained farther, that
while it was well enough for Senators to
express anxiety on tne subject, all bills to
raise revenue must originate in the Houso
of Bepresentatives. The Senate would re
member that at the last session it passed
resolutions for a special income tax and the
House sent it bacc, on tne ground that all
such measures should originate in the
House. He thought this resolution wcu'd
create a controversy with theHause, which
he desired to avoid. The Senate mutt
awtit their action.
Mr.lShea man Viieved there wasnc i ity
for increased taxation. There were sever
al reasons for it. The soldiers were now
serving in the field or enduring tbe hard-
snips ol military sen Ice, while the cituar.s
were reapirg ncn prims from the war, by
engaging in business, and were doing bet
ter than they had done any previous year.
He thought it but right that those who
reaped the profi's of the war should pay
liborally for it in taxes. If we increased
our national debt and put those taxes upon
future generations, we compelled these
soldiers who bad fought our battles to bear
all tbe expenses of the war. This would
be unjust. ,
- Mr Br jwn I have to objection to the
reference of this resolution to the Commit
tee on Ficanc s if it was atro'ueed sin p y
for setting iorth the views entertained by
the Senat r from Wisconsin, Mr. Doolit
tle, indicating the direction in which he
thought the inquiry should be made, but
if it is going to that Committee by gener
al concent, and is tacn aa any indication
that the Senate concurs in the supcestinns
made, I shall, fir one, say that! differ
very widely in regard to tee policies he
has indicated and the effects to follow
from that which he seems to anticipate.
will add one more word and say this
that I think tbe gentlemen are, perhaps,
mistaken in regard to the extent to which
taxation can be carried and that we are
perhaps nearer to the point at which it
can be propei) borne titan mapyj persons
imagine.
Mr. Brown continued his remarks ad
vocating a reduction of expenditures in
tbe conduct ot tne Government.
Mr. Doolittle. I agree with the Senator
from Missouri in what he says about the
necessity of reducing expenses in every
possible way. I will go with him in any
effort to reduce them and to compel the
Administration in every department ot
the government to exeic:se the strictest
economy possible. At the same time our
necessary expenses are so great, and must
continue to be so great, that we are com
pelled to sieze bold or every source tnat
will certainly bring us revenue. I do not
expect, if cjuisc, that these resolutions
shall go forth as expressing the views of
the Senate upon the points I have pre
sented, still the points are of sufficient in
terest ana importance to oe wen considered
by that Committee.
The Besolution was then referred with
out objection.
Mr. Chandler moved tnat the resolu
tions offered by him to-day be printed,
wmcn was carried.
Mr. Brown offered the following, which
was adoptud i
ReuUutd That the Committee on Military
Affairs and the Militia be instructed to in
quire into the expediency of repealing an
Act of Congress, of March 21st, 1861, en
tiled an Act to remove the United States
arsenal from the city of St. Louis, and to
provide for the sale of the 1u,q4 or which
the same is located. .
Mr. Doolittle moved that all bills, peti
tions and memorials which were pending
at the close of the last sassloi of Cocgres,
c relerred to tneir appropriate commit
tees. This was carnea.
A joint resolution, from tbe tho House,
was submitted, giving notic to ureat
Britain of lh9 termination of the Becipro
city Treaty.
Mr. Foster moved to refer it to the
Committee on commerce.
Mr. Sumner moved that it oueht to go
to theCommiltee on Foreign Halations, and
it was on motion, to relerred. Tne senate
went into executive stiiion, and soon
afterwards adjourned.
SENATE. HOUSE.
Mr. Schenck, from the Committee on
Military Affair?, reported a bill pending,
that all Major Genera's, and all Briga
dier Generals, in the military eeivice of the
United states, who on tne loth day ot
February, 1865, shall not be in the per
formance of duty or service corresponding
to their respective grades and rank, and
who shall not have been engaged in such
duty or service for three months co&tfnu
ousfy, prior to that date, shall then bo
dropped from the rolls of the army, and
all the pay and emoilumenU or allowances
of such general officers, so dropped, shall
cease from tnat data, and tne vacancies
thus occasioned may be filled' by
new promotions and appointments as in
other cases, but ne otneer is to be consid
ered as Included in the foregoing provision
where absence from duly shall have been
occasioned by wounds received or disease
contracted in tne line or bis duty while in
ne military service, or ty cu ceing a pris
oner of war or under parole.
Mr. Cox inquired of his coliesgue what
cal become of a similar bill introduced
here at the last session .
Mr. Schenck replied, that having passed
the Hcnsa, it hangs in the Senate.
Mr. Cox taw no necessity for the pas
snga of suob a law. aa tlie President now
has the power to drop officers for incompe
tency or memaency. lie asked w&j tne
enmate naa not acted on tne old bill.
Mr. Schenck .replied that he could not
tell his colleague tho reason for the Senate's
non-action on the subjectas the question
uaa oeen luuy aiscussed at last session.
- Mr. Schenck moved the previous ques
tion. This was seconded, and under its opera
tion the bill was passed by a vote of 98
against 38.
The Houso then proceeded to the consid
eration oi tne Joint Besolution, pending
from July last. auUiorizinir tbe Sacretarv
of the Treasury to appoint three Commis
sicners to inquire and report at the earliest

gara to tne sourees irom wnicn derived,
with power to take testimony under such
regulations as may be prescribed bv the

ira above resolution was tabled bv a

The House took nn and nasaed without
debate, the Senate bill authorizing the pur
chase or construction of six Bevenue Cut

release of the St. Albans raiders. It is
the chief subject of conversation in all
public places. All the daily papers have
editorial comments on the affair. The
iiVroWsaya: "If anything of this kind
should ocour again, it may lead to serious
complications between this country and
Great Britain. If this is the law we are
to expect from the English Bench in Can
ada, the American people will have to
take care of their own border in the future,
and protect it by the most stringent meas
ures.''
The Tribune says : " The Administra
tion at Washington may now, perhaps, in
quire of Great Britain whether the justi
ties this conduct of one of her Judges, and
whether, if it is to rest upon the ground
that these were the acts of belligerents,
she means to permit war to be waged on
the United States from her territory, and
by mta amenable to her laws r .
The Pati says : u Two courses are alone
left us. First, to demand from the Im
perial Government such police of the
Canadian border as will secure our villages
from the descents of rascals under the
name of rebels, and in the event that this
is not promised, to take the mode and
measures of redress into our own hands.11

COUNTER-SKIRMISHING.
The WurU$ army of the James special
gives the particulars of the movements of
the enemy in front of Butler's lines on the
morning of the 10th. Four regiment cf
tbe enemy in line, preceded by skirmishers,
attacked and drove in our cavalry pickets
from Darbytown to tbe James river, near
Deep Bottom. Infantry from the 24th
and 23th corps went to the assistance of
our cavalry, when ihe enemy halted. Our
troops immediately commenced skirmish
ing with the enemy, but made no attempt
to force him to retreat. Meanwhile an
other party of rebels passed the cross fields
to a point where the Kingsland and New
Market roads form a junction, and opened
a skirmish with the troops defending one
of the forts at that point. Skirmishing was
kept np during the dsy , and it is supposed
the enemy fell back at night The move
ment is thought to be for the purpose of
feeling our position. At about the same
hour another attack was made. Tho ene
my advanced in line against the pickets
on the left of Fort Burnham, and forced
them to retire. In a subsequent attack on
our part the enemy were driven back and
our pickets established in advance of the
original line. The artillery in several of
our flanking bastions were Ughtly engaged.
WARREN'S EXPEDITION.
The Tribune't correspondent with War
ren's Corps says : Sussex Court House is
burned in retaliation for the murder of
three of our men, and the stripping and
exposure of their bodies by the road-side.
The town consisted of the court house, jail,
tavern, and a dozen dwolling houses.
Hill's corps left our front at tho same
time that Wanen started.
The rebels failed to anticipate Warren's
movement, and evidently expected another
attack on the South Side Railroad, and had
made the necessary preparations for its de
fence.
WHAT WHAT WAS FOUND ON WARREN'S
ROUTE.
The Herald t correspondent with War
ren's corps give the particulars of the
march and condition of the country visited.
The plantation wera frequent and large,
and gave evidence of high cultivation.
There were great quantities of corn, tweet
potatoes, fodder and live stock. Thousands
of biiihe'j of corn were found in cribs, and
hundreds of acres were yet on the stalk.
No grain belonging to private parties
was destroyed, except in iastances of the
owners being personally bnoxiour.
Apple whisky and brandy were found
in abundance. Seventy-six barrels were
found in one lot and a hundred in another.
Kruit was found in large quantities. - The
majority of the inhabitants seemed reason
ably prepared with a year's subsistence.
The culture of sorghum was a feature
of plantations passed. Almost all had
their own mills and evaporators for manu
facturing syrup. Horses and mules were
generally hidden in the woods, but cattle
and heg were too numerous to be thus
disposed of; chickens, turkeys and geese
were in abundance.
The negroes welcomed us everywhere,
and returned with our troops in consider
able uumbers. But little public property
was captured or destroyed. At Sussex
Court House we secured a little ammuni
tion, but the carbines had just been removed.

ST. ALBANS RAIDERS.
Tho pretext upon which the St. ATbans
raiders have been set at large, and ' their
plunder restored to them, is that it was
necessary under an Act of British Parlia
ment, lor tne Governor Ueneral of Canada
to have issued an order for thair arrrest.
This is believed to be the first caso of ex
tradition. The Canadian Act of the 10th
of May, 1849, and the 13th cf May, 1861,
wers passed expressly to provide for tbe
APPROPRIATIONS.
Consular and diplomatic bills were re

DISPATCHES FROM FOSTER.
FORTRESS MONROE, Dec. 13.
The steamship Arago arrived last even
ing, having in tow the United States gun
boat Aooiista, having broken down, lrem
Port Royal with important dispatches
from General Foster.
FROM SHERMAN.
The latest advices from Sherman at the
time the Arago sailed on the 8tb, was that
his advance troops, comprising mostly
cavalry and light artillery, had reached a
point forty miles from Savannah, and was
steadily feeling his way toward the latter,
with every prewpect of capturing it with
very little loss to his army. He hid suc
ceeded in severing the railway communi
cation leading to Savannah, and had cut
off the moat important route or fimpliet
for the troops that were ka?:.iiy assembled
for its defence.
EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS, ETC.
The bembardment of Charleston had
been suspended and Colcnol Mulford was
rapidly pushing forward his arrangements
far the .exchange of the balance of the
Union prisonors.
Most intenso consternation, it is said by
the men recently exchanged, to prevail,
not only in Savannah, wheie the authori
ties were hourly exp?cting Sherman's van
guard, but also in Charleston.
The exchange cf prisoners is progressing
very favorably, considering the state ot
affairs at Charleston, and no doubts are en
tertained that Colonel Mulford will fill the
remaining vessels of our fleet with released
BUT LITTLE NEWS FROM SHERMAN.
The rebel authorities allow no papers to
be exchanged, so that it is almost impossi
ble to obtain any idea of Sherman's situa
tion or progress. The Charleston Mercury,
of the 6th, has the following only item of
intelligence ironi bavannan : Tne tiepuo-
Uean, ot yesterday morning, say Bner
man's army is a growing scourga where'
ever it goes. No attention is paid by his
troops to his general ordor issued at the
outset of his expedition. Throughout
the whole line of march the country is
made desolate by pillage and fire. - We
trust a righteous retribution awaits the
vandals. A gentleman who reached herd
yesterday, reports that he crossed the Yan
kee telegraph wire running thrtugh a
wsmp in the direction of the Savannah
river. The other end probably reached
fo the other camps. He tried hard to
break it,' but did not succeed, having no
cecvenienie at hand for that purpose.
Our informant says : The country in
the rear of Sherman' army is literally
swarming with deserters arid stragglers,
who are either begging at, or pillaging
every house. He thinks that an active
regiment of cavalry would be able to pick
up a thousand of thef ecu -throats. He was
a prisoner in the Federal army, and he
says many of the officers and men are dis
gusted with the expedition and openly ex
press their desire for peace. Hu heard a
lieutenant say that if he had his way ha
would break Lis sword to pied and go
home, perfectly satiaaed to have the inde
pendence of the Confederacy acknowledg
ed. Sherman had with him 300 or 400 negro
men and beys, but no women or small
children. They wore unarmed and merily
marched along with the Yankees. They
were frequently leaving and going home.j

Hilton Head, a C, Dec 12,
VTA Fobtbess Monro, Dec. 14. f
Major-Generai Ilalleek, Chief of Staff:
Captain Duncan, of General Howard's
scouts, has j'J't come in from General
Howard, having descended the Ogechee
river in a small boat. He left tbe army on
the evening of tbe ?th. Sherman's whole
army was then within ten miles of Savan
nah, advancing to- attack the place.
The enemy's works, five miles from the
city, were probably attacked yesterday, as
heavy tiring was heard ia that direction.
Captain Duncan represents the army to
be in the beat spirits possible and in meat
excellent condition. Little opposition had
been met with on the march, as the enemy
could not tell what route was to be taken.
The army has lived off the country, and
has accumulated a considerable number of
horses and cattle. The army is weil supplied.
The following is a copy of a dispatch,
brought by Captain Duncan :
