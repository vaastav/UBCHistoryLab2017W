TICK NEWS,
She.mr.ii at last. The old flag emerges
from the mystery that has shrouded hisex
}-<dilici:. For a month it lias been sweeping
through the very heart of the inner circle of
the rfhcliion, a region whence the light of its
folds and stars has been for three years cx
c-indcd. The latest direct intelligence from
i-hcrmau’ti army, the first since he swung
loor-c from Atlanta, a month ago, is that giv.
on elsewhere, brought to General Fos
ter by a scout from Gen. Howard's corps,
which he left on the 9th iust. (Friday last)
lu-aiing Savannah. The army Is In splendid
<.l nditloii and well supplied. The indirect
: dviecs .-till later, are by way of a loyal resi
dent of Richmond, given in a Washington
t-j-ccinl to the New York World, And are Of
Saturday, she 10th, They are confirmatory
<.f ilu fir? 4 , named, in respect to the comma*
ideation with Gen. Foster made the day pro
■vion*. If we may credit the second
dirpatch, General Sherman.-at once
h.gan the battle before Savannah, and
;he account U given with much detail, and
doses at such a juncture of the struggle as to
< ausc the subsequent advices to be awaited
with the utmost eagerness.
While v.c arc confident that Sherman has
the ability lo put the finishing stroke to his
great movement, we prefer to await without
prophesying the victory, which, if he wins,
places the rebel cause on the coast, at his feet.
The country will be stirred with deep In
dignation at the issue of the St. Albans raid
hearing before the Canadian authorities, and
will find the order of Gen. Dlx and the stirring
resolutions of Senator Chandler the expo
nents of the sentiments of every loyal Ameri
can, If Canada will not repress and punish
these murderers and assassins for our sake
and the old relations between ns,
the iijuj-j for her own. The people of
border will not look at boundary lines If
they m e made the breastwork of a blood-'
thirsty and incendiary foe. Will Great Britain
repudiate the Provincial construction of in.
1 dilation;;! law, and resume the operation of
the extradition treaty? It is to be hoped she
may, but there arc no complications that can
prow out of tbe ease, more potent for evil
than the immunity to rebel war schemes
within the Canadian borders, and these must
be broken up and theirpartlclpators punished
whdcvi-r lound.

General Orrers, No. 07. —Information
having: btvn received at these headquarters
that the rebel marauders who were guilty of
murder and robbery at St. Albans, have been
discharged from arrest, and that other enter
prises are actually in preparation in Canada,
the Commanding General deems it due to
the people of the frontier towns to adopt the
most prompt and cfllcicnt measures for the
security of their lives and property. All
military commanders on the frontiers are,
f therefore, instructed in case farther acts of
- depredation and murder are attempted,
whether by marauders or persons acting un
der commissions from the rebel authorities
at Richmond, to shoot down the depredators.
If possible, while in the commission of their
crimes, or, if it be necessary, toiih a vl w to their
1 . capture , to cross the boundary between the United
' dates and Canada, said esmtnonders arc here
by direct'd to pursue them wherever they
inn* take refuge, and. it captured, they are
under no circumstances to be surrendered,
but to br sont to those headquarters for trial
and puid-liiui ui by martial law.

the authority he possesses,
nude’ the rules of lew recognized by all dvi

Jif tile expeditions within neutral territory
and fleeing ;o it for an asylum after commit
ting acts of depredation within our own;
such an exercise of authority haring become
iiidisponrdile to the protection of our cities

from robbery and murder.
Jt is earnestly hoped that the inhabitants

New Touk, Wednesday, Dec. 14.—The fol
lowing dispatch has been received at the War
Department:
Hilton Head, Dec. 15, ISM.
Major General Dalleck, Washington:
G EKEKAi,—Capt. Duncan, of Gen.*Howard’s
scents, has just come in from Gen. Hotvard,
Laving descended the Ogcchce river In small
boats. He left our army on the evening of
the 9th. Gen. Sherman’s whole army was
then within ten miles of Savannah, advancing
to attack the enemy’s works five miles from'
the city, which were probably attacked yes
terday, as heavy firing was hoard in that di
rection. ■
Capt. Duncan reports the army to be in tbe
best of spirits possible and most excellent
condition. Very little opposition had been
met with on the march. The enemy conld
not tell what route was to be taken. Tbe
army lived off the Country, and has accumu
lated a considerable number of horses and
cattle. The army is well supplied. The fol
lowing Is a copy of a dispatch brought by
Capt. Duncan:

StILL LATER.
New Tore, Wednesday, Dec. 14.—The
World's Washington special has an account of
a battle in front of Savannah, on Saturday,
the 10th, which he says comes direct from a
loyal resident of Richmond. He says 20,003
of Sherman's men, at an early hour, crossed
the Ogechee River, below Bloomingdale, some
twelve miles south of Savannah, and massing
between that point end Telfhir, the left wing
extended so as to cut the Charleston and' Sa
vannah Railroad. Communication had been
effected the preceding day with Gen. Poster,
who was again rapidly advancing on Gra
hamsvlllc, the rebels retreating from their
strong positions south of Pocotaligo Bridge,
and evidently alarmed at finding themselves
threatened both in front and rear by superior
force*.
Sherman, who was on the field, fonnd him
self confronted by a large force of regulars
and militia intrenched. The battle began
cailyin the day. and was contested with
great fury on both sides, the garrison of Sa
vannah, numbering twelve thousand veter
ans, participating. Towards noon a grand
charge was made by the Union troops, which
carried some of the works on the enemy's
left and center, threatening to cat him off
from the inlet and city. This was followed
by im advance of the whole line, which doub
led up the rebel forces in confusion, and they
fell back to the Immediate vicinity of the
works in the rear of Savannah. Our troops
pursued to Tclioir, on the south, and a cor
rcsjjonding distance along the upper railroad.
Here our troops rested, finding the' enemy's
works very strong, and our men, from a
heavy march the previous night and the se
vere fighting, being worn out. The loss was
severe on both sides—2.soo Union, and be
tween 8,000 and 4,000 rebels, among
whom were fully 1,200 prisoners,
including many officers of rank. Colors,can
non; small anus, wagons and caissons were
captured. Smith, Hardee and Cobb were in
command of the rebels, whose loss at first
was less than ours, owing to their protection,
but at the close *of the action they suffered
tremendously. It Is believed aU*sfthe rebels
at the head of the inlet, four or five thousand,
would be captured.
The facts, soys the TTorkT* correspondent,
have been carefully concealed by the rebel
authorises. The greatest consternation pre
vailed at Charleston.
The latest advices left Sherman close to the
coast, cither able to form a junction with
Foster and the fleet, or to attack Savauuah
with prospects of success.
Richmond pajKirs of Monday report Sher
man moving on in dose proximity to Savan
nah. Beauregard commands the defenses of
the city, assisted by Hardee, Smith and pro
bably Taylor.
Rebel papers say a battle may be progress
*ing to-day, and express themselves confident
of success.
Bragg was at Augusta at last accounts.
New York, Wednesday, Dec. 14.—A spe
cial to the Commercial says that the Richmond
papers of the 12th inst. contain no hews from
Sherman, but there are rumors that Union
prisoners report Gen. Kilpatrick killed, also
that a Union cavalry force had left Baton
Rouge, destined for Mobile. Ocu. Hays and
Col. "Wild have been paroled by the rebel* to
distribute supplies to the Union prisoners.

[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.]
; Indianapolis, Wednesday, Dec. It
Jodgd Advocate Burnett has returned from
Chicago, whither he went a few days ago to
investigate matters connected with the forth
coming confined in Camp
Douglas.
‘ The Military Commission will convene again
in this city to-morrow, and the Judge Advo
cate will begin his argument In behalf of the
Government. As the case stands Bowles is
without any defense whatever, except such as
the ingenuity of his counsel may have woven
for him in the way of sophistical speeches.
The appointment of the Hon- David Mc-
Donald as Judge of the United States District
Court gives general satisfaction. Jndge Mc-
Donald is a sound lawyer and a man of un
blemished character, and will prove a worthy
successor to the lamented White.
Measures are being taken to recruit volun
teers sufficient to HU the quota of the city
in advance of the future call formen. Under
a proper stimulus of sufficient bounty, there
is no doubt the thing can be done.
There have been some changes In tbe office
of the 'Western Union Telegraph Company In
this city. Mr.'J. F. Wallace, for many years
the popular manager of the office, has been
appointed Division Superintendent; C. C.
Whitney, Esq., Chief Operator, succeeds Mr.
Wallack as General Manager, and Mr R. C.
Duncan, formerly of Pittsburg, Penn., takes
Ibt position of Chief Operator. Fitting ap
pointments all of them.
* The United Slates Telegraph Company are
fitting up on office in this city, and expect to
have their line open for business soon.
The one year regiments recently recruited
in this State, the 140 th, 141 st and 142 d, and
which went to the fiont but a short time ago,
arc cooped up in Murfreesboro under Rossean
and Mill oy. The forwarding of men to the
field continues unabated. About 100 recruits
go forwaid to-night lor the 28th C. S. colored
infantry. The news which came to-day, an
nouncing Sherman 1 *- victory near Savannah,
made every body feci good, and the snspH
cions fact that it was only a special to the N.
Y. IVbrM, did not seem to mar the general
rejoicing.
Governor Morion has received a petition.
signed by the loyal citizens of Madison, Ind.,
asking for one hundred stand of arms ana
accoutrements. They propose to raise a com
pany of volunteers W they can be obtained,
ibr the purpose of cleaning ont a guerilla
band which Infests the bonier, and fires Into

47th Indiana, Col. Slack, arrived to-day from
Memphis to be mastered out of service.
The Union wigwam, by permission of the

President pro tern.* in thc'chair.
Mr. NEbMITU, ot Oregon, presented the me
morial of the Legislature of Oregon praying for a

Mr. GRIMES, of lowo. Chairman of the Com

tion tendering the thunks of Congress to Capt.
John A. Winslow, of the U. S. navy, in accordance
with the recommendation of tbe President. He
moved that the Senate proceed to the considera
tion of the resolution, ana asked nnanlmons con
sent to do so. Consent was given, and the resolu
tion considered and passed.
Mr. GRIMES reported from the Naval Commit
tee a similar resolution in the cose of William B.
Cashing, which was passed.
Mr. WILSON, of Mass., presented the petition
of several lice officers In the army praying for ad
ditional compensation. Referred to the SlUllary
Committee.
Mr. WILSON, from tbe Military Committee, re
ported back the joint resolution offered hy him
yesterday, with the recommendation that It pass.
It was read for the first time.
Mr. TRUMBULL, of 111., from the Judiciary
Commi ttce.re ported a number of private petitions.
Mr. Trumbcll also reported a bill authorizing the
holding of a special session of the United States
District Court in Indiana. Tbe bill was passed.
Mr. CHANDLER, of Mich.: I see intnc morn
ing papers tbe following announcement]
from Toronto: “ The St. Albans raiders
have been discharged for want of jurisdic
tion." J desire to ofler a couple of resolu
tion bearing upon this subject, one of them par
ticularly. But Ido not expect to make the Senate
.understand the state of iceliag, existing on the
border. 1 have a great number of letters from
gentlemen living on the border. In my own city,’
which Is within musket range of the Canada shore,
thousands of citizens have been under arms for a
long time.
We have been In a continual stale of alarm from
Incendiaries, burglars and robbers. From this
announcement it would seem that the Canadian
authorities have made up their minds to protect
these rubbers. As 1 understand It, a man comes
from thfrSootb with a commission purporting to
belseucdTiy Jeff. Davis. liecnUyts robbing par
ties, crcstcs the borders, murders and robs whom
be pleases, and returns to Canada,where be is pro
tected. These letters which I have In my posses
sion arc all bearing on this point The one in my
hand now Is from one of the mo»t respectable citi
zens of Detroit, a gentleman of great wealth and
high political and soclal.position. who earnestly
desires to avoid any difficulty with Great Britain.
“At-this time,” he says, “the anxiety growing out
of tbe mid and doubt encircling every rumor that
reaches us. Is sot to be endured, and if upon some
slight provocation ourpeople shall be found en
gaged m some act in Canada that tbe Canadian
government will say Is wrong, sooner or later war
will be the result." He save also; “Will you give
the subject yonr immediate attention for I think it
Involves, sooner or later, if not properly managed,
war with great Britain."
Mr. President, 1 haVe no expectation of making
the Senate comprehend the state of excitement
thus aroused, and the state of feeling on
that border. Vermont may, for aught I know,
Sulotly submit to have her towns robbed and her
Itizen* murdered, but the Northwest will not. I
offer this resolution:
WnnEEAS. Recent raids have been organized In
the Canaass and Noi'a Scotia, and men enlisted <□
said British provinces by men purporting to bold
commissions from the rebels for murdering and
robbing peaceful citizens of the United States, for
horning cities, and villages, for plratically cap
turing merchant vessels and murdering their
crews, and for a general system of murder, arson,
robbery and plunder of peaceful end unarmed citi
zens of the bolted States. And
Whereas, The people of the British Provinces'
seem dibposed lo protect th'*ee thieves robbers.
Incendiaries, pirates and murderers, not only in
their individual capacity, but by the quibbles of
.tbe law. Therefore
Jleeohtu. That tbe Committee on Military
Affairs be ci.-cctcd to inquire Into the expediency
of enlisting tin Army Corps, to watch and defend
our territory bordering on the lake un*l the Cana
dian line from all hostile demonstrations aud in
cursions.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Md.-I object to the reso
lution.
The PRESIDENT pro. ttvx. —The resolution
will lie over, objection being made.
Mr. cn ANni.Kß— i bad Loped there would be
no objection to It. Iv. ill now offer another reso
lution. which I ask to be referred to the Coamit
tee on Commerce.
The moludon wae received and is as follows:
Wnccus, At the commencement of the pres*
ent rebellion, the United Suites were at peace with
all the governments of the world and on terms of
comity and good will with Great Britain; and,
Whereas, That nation, before the arrival on her
soil of our Minister, accredited to the administra
tion ofPresidcnt Lincoln,prccipitalclyacknowlcdg*
ed the rebels as belligerents, thus recognizing their
flag upon the ocean, without which recognition It
would have been regarded and treated us piratical
by all other powers; and
Whereas, She then proclaimed pcrfectneatral
ity between a Republic with which she had enter
tained friendly relations for upw.rda of half a cen
tury, and its treasonable subjects; and
Whereas, lumbers of her subjects, with the
full knowledge of her sublects, commenced fitting
outlast sidling vessels, loaded with munitions of
war, for the purpose of running into our blocka
ded ports for the rebels, thus furnishing them the
means of organizing and conquering the rebellion,.
and without which ft could not have sustained it
self for six mouths; and
Whereas, In addition to the above, and with
the knowledge of the Government, British sub
jects and members of Parliament arc engaged in
the manutactnre ofpracticaJly English ships, own
ed by British subjects manned by British seamen
and sailing under British colors for the purpose
of burning, desfroying and utterly driving from
the occur all vessels sailing under the United
States Hag; and
Whereas, Many private and unarmed American
ships have been burned and destroyed by these
pirates from English ports, thus causing great loss
end damage to toe citizens of the United States,
therefore,
Besolctd, That the Secretory of Slate be In
etrncted to make out a list of each cargo thus de
stroyed, with fair and separate valuation, and in
terest at the rate of 6 per cent per annnmf rom date
of capture or destruction to the date of presenta
tion. and that be be directed to demand irom the
British Government payment in full for all ships
or cargoes destroyed as aforesaid.
Mr. JOHNSON objected to the resolution, which
lies over. __
Mr. DOOLITTLE, of Wig., wished to have the
resolution in relation to taxation offered by him
on Monday, token from the table and referred to
the Committee on Finance. Mr. Doolittle said:
“ I det-ire to call the attention of tho members of
the Committee on Finance to the special points
mentioned, withont at all entering into a discae
ilon. The resolution instructs the Committee to
inquire iqto the propriety of a tax on ail sales of
both real and personal property. According to
the best estimate that can be made thoemaQedt
amount that would be produced by the tax would
be $5,000,000 a year. It not only proposes a tax
upon Bales actually made, but upon all who sell
stocks, gold and produce. It will have more of a
restraining effect on speculations in gold than all
the gold hills which can be passed which shall
make it a penal offense to self gold In the market
or make any distinction between gold and paper
money.
It also proposes that the committee shall inquire
Into the propriety ofnddinz a tax of S3 per cent to
all the railroad fares of the coon ry, Including
street nilroads,steamboats and forays, making such
companies tax gatherers for thebenefltof the Gov
ernment. This is a source of income and revenue
which Is the most immediately accessible of any
upon which the Government con lay its bauds,
wnich would be received in large quantities from
powerful companies whose revenues have become
immense. This is the timtLwbcu wc should seize
hold of these means which will produce revenue,
for the money we must have. Another point in
the resolution is simply to inqnircwhetucr itis
not best to prevent the organization of any new
R ftD iftnp company, allowing at the same time those
banksnowlnczletcncetowithdrawtheir circula
tion, and to go into operation under the General*
I-ankiDc law.
Mr. DOOLITTLE then explained the fourth
provision of Ms resolution, in reference to the
substitution of other interest-bearing notes for
those in circulation.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio—Before a vote Is taken
I would like to say a word or two. I have no ob
jections the reference of the resolution, but will
state that the Committee on Finance have already
this subject under consideration, as recommended
by the Secretary of the Treasury, in his annual re
port, and by the President of the United States, in
his annual message. All the points at issue will
be considered in the Committee, without any res
olution fmthosubject. „ ,
Mr. SHERMAN explained farther that while It
was fitenongh for Senators to express anxiety on
the bills to raise revenue must origi
nate in the House of Representatives; The Sen
ate should remember that at the last session it
passed a resolution for a special income tax, and
the House sent It back oo the ground that all such
measures must originate In the House. He
thought this resolution would create controversy
with the House, which be desired to avert. Tho
Senate must await their action.
In continuing, he believed there was
nccesaky for Increased taxations. There were
several reasons for it. The soldiers were now
serving in the field and enduring the hardships of
military service, while citizens were reaping rich*
profits from the war by engaging In business, and
were doing better than they had droc during any
previous year. He thought it was hut right that
they who arc reaping the profits of the war should
pay liberally in taxes. If wc Increased oar na
tional debt and put those taxes upon futnre gen
erations, we ccmpellcd these soldiers who nad
fonrht our battles to bear the expenses of the*
war. This would be unjust.
Mr. BROWN, of Mo. -1 have no oWcctlon to
the reference of this resolution to the Committee
on Finance, If It was Introduced simply for setting
forth the views entertained by the Senator from
Wisconsin (Mr. Doolittle) or indicating the direc
• tion In which he thought Inquiry should be made:
hut If It is going to that Committee by general
consent, andls to be taken as any that
the Senate concurs io tho suggestions nude, I
. shall formic say that I differ very widely inregard
to the policies be has indicated and the effects to
follow from Ibul which ho reems to anticipate. I

think gentlemen (ire perhaps mistaken in regard
to the extent to which taxation can be carnet],
and that we are perhaps nearer to the point at
which it can properly be home than many persons
imagine.
Mr. BROWN continued bis remarks, advocating
a redaction of expenditures in the conduct of the
Government
Mr. DOOLITTLE—I agree with the Senator
from Missouri entirely Id what he says about the
necessity of reducing expenses in every possible
way. -1 will go with him in any effort to reduce
them, and to compel the Administration in every
department of the Government to exercise the
strictest economy. At the same time, our neces
sary expenses arc so great, and must he so great,
that WO arc compelled to seize hold of every source
that will certainly bring us revenue. Ido not ex
pect, of coarse, that these resolutions shall go
forth as expressing the views of the Senate upon
the points I have presented. Still, the points are
of sufficient Interest and Importance to be well
considered by that Committee.
The resolution was then referred without objec
tion.
Mr. CHANDLER moved that the resolutions
offered by him to-day be printed, which, was car
ried;
Mr. BROWN offered the following; which was
adopted:
jßef'ited., That the Committee on Military Aflhlre
and-tho Militia be instructed to inquire Into the
expediency of repealing on act of Congress of
March Slat, 1861, entitled “An act to remove the
United States arsenal from the city of St. Louis,
and to provide for the sole of the land on which
the Bcmois localcd.” • .
Mr. DOOLITTLE moved (bat all bills, petitions
ixd memorials which Were pending at the close of
the last session of -Congress be referred to their
appropriate committees. This was carried.
A. Joint resolution Irotn the House was an
nounced, giving notice to Great Britain of the ter
mination of the reciprocity treaty.
Mr. FOSTER moved to refer it to the Committee
on Commerce.
Mr. SUMNER, of Mass.,'thought It ought to go
to the Committee on FortignKclatloas, and it was,
on motion, so referred;
The Senate.went into executive pcaslon, and
soon alter adjourned.
Washengtok, Wednesday, Dec. 14,15 W.
HOUSE.
Mr. WILSON, of lowa, from the Committee ofi
Judiciary, reported a bill amendatory to the act
of July 17th, ISC2, to define the pay and emolu
ments of officers of the army, etc., so as to read
that “any alien of twenty years and upwards who
shall have enlisted in the volunteer or. regular
army, navy or marine corps, and been honorably
discharged, may become a citizen without any
previous declaration, and shall not bo required to
prove more than one year's residence." The bill
was passed.
The bill for a ship' canal around the Falls of Ni
agara, and a ship canal from the Mississippi to
Lake Michigan, were further postponed until the
23d of January next. -
On motion of Mr. EBOOKS, ofNewTork.it was
received that the Committee on Foreign Affitirs
inquire into the expediency of providing, by
treaty or otherwise, for tho protection of oar Ca
nadian and Provincial frontiers from murder and
burglary on the pretense of rebel invasion.
Mr. SCIIENCh, of Ohio, from the Committee on
Nllltaiy Affairs, reported a bill pending, that all
Major Generals ana all Brigadier Generals In the
military service of the United States, who, on the
15th day of February, 16C5, shall not be in the per
formance of duty, or service corresponding to
their respective grades and rank, and who shall
not have been engaged In each duty or service for
three months continuously, next prior to that date,
shall then be dropped from the rolls of the army,
and all the pay ana emoluments or allowances of
such general officer so dropped shall cease from
that date, and the vacancies thus occasioned puy
be filled by new promotions and appointments, us
in other eases; but no oillcer Is to
be included -In the foregoing provisions
whose absence from duty shall have been
occasioned by wounds received or diseases con
tracted in the lino of bis duty while in the mili
tary sen ice, or by bis being a prisoner of war in
the hands of enemy, or under parole; and any
Major General of volunteers who may have been
appointed from the regular army, under the au

vice corresponding to his proper rank,'ror three
months consecutively then next preceding.
Mr. COX, of Ohio, Inquired of his colloaguo
what had become of a similar bill introduced bore
at the last session. *
- Mr. SCHiLNCE replied, that having passed the
Bouse it hangs in the Semite..
Mr. COX. saw no necessity for tbe passage of
such a law. as the President now has the power to
drop officers for ineompctcncy or Inefficiency. Be
asked why the Senate had not acted on the old
hill.
Mr. SCIIENCK replied, that ho could not tell
his colleague tiie reason for the Senate's non-ac
tion on the subject. As the question had been'
fully discussed at tbe last session ho (Schenck)
would now merely move the previous question.
This was seconded, and under its operation the
bill was pasted by a vote of 9S against 3S.
The House proceeded to the consideration of the
joint resolution pending from July last, authori
zing the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint
three commissioners to Inquire ana report at the
earliest practicable moment the best and most effi
cient mode of raising by taxation the necessary
amount of revenue for supporting the wants of the
Government, having regard to the sources from
which derived, with power to take testimony un
der such regulations as may be prescribed by the
Secretary of the Treasury.
Tbe above resolution was tabled by a vote of GS
yeas to 66 navs.
Tbe Douse took up and passed without debate
the Senate hill, authorizing the purchase or.con
etractipn of six steam revenue cutters on tbe lakes,
andpapnropriating $1,000,009, for that purpose.
The Donee then went into Committee of the
Whole on the President’s Message.
. Mr. BROOKS, of N. T., made a speech in oppo
sition to two points in the message, viz.: thatiho
war must go on without any further negotiation,
and that the war must continue until slavery Is
abolished throughout the United States. Be main
tained that the subjugation of tbe South was Im
possible, and warned the gentlemen against Intol
erance on the subject of slavery.
Mr. Brooks Amber said—our difficulties can be
adjusted by negotiation, but never by arms.
Mr. PRICE, of lowa, replied by saying that the
speech delivered by Brooks was Intended to
strengthen the bands of the slave owners, and to
that-extent depress tbe Union cause.
The Douse, after further remarks from Mr.
Brooks, adjourned.

News.
[Special Dispatch to the Western Press.]
New York, Wednesday, Dec. 14—Midnight.
There is much excitement to-day on the re
lease of the Sf. Albans raiders, which is the
chief subject of conversation in all public
places. All the daily papers have editorials
commenting on the affair. The Herald says
if anything of this kind should occur again,
it may lead to serious complications between
this country and Great Britain. If this lathe
law wc arc to expect from the English Bench
in Canada, the American people will have to
take care of their own border in future, and
protect it bv stringent means.
The Tribune says the Administration at
Washington may now, perhaps, inquire of
England whether she justifies this conduct of
one of her Judges, and whether it Is to rest
on the ground that these were acts of bellig
erents, and If she means to penult war to be
waged on us flora her territory, ana by men
amenable to her Taws.
The Tost says two courses arc alone left us:
First, to demand from the Imperial Govern
ment such police of the Canadian border, as
will secure our villages from dcsccntsof rascals
under the name of rebels, and in the event
that this is not promised, take the mode and
measures of redress into our own hands.
United States Marshal Murray has received
instructions from Secretary Seward to pro
ceed to Montreal Immediately to look after
the Interests'in the case of -the St. Albans
raiders. He left for Canada to-day.
The Military Situation.
The World** Army of the James correspon
dence of the 10th gives particulars of the
mores of the enemyln front of Butler’s lines.
On the moraine of the 10th four regiments of
the enemy in line, preceded by skirmishers,
attacked and drove oar pickets Irom the Dar
by town road to the James river. Infantry
from the 24th and 25th corps were sent to the
assistance of our cavalry, when the enemy
halted. Our troops immediately commenced
skirmishing with him, but made no Attempt
to force him to retreat.. Meanwhile, another
party of the enemy passed across.a field to a
point where the Kingsland and Newmarket
roads form a junction, and opened a skirmish
with the troops defending one of our forts at
that point. Skirmishing wa#- kept np
during day, and it is supposed the
enemy fell back at night. The movement
was thought to be for the purpose
feeling onr position. At about the same hour
as the above attack was made, the enemy ad*
vanccd in line against oar pickets on tbe left
of Fort Bnrnbam and forced them to retire.
In a subsequent attack ononrlort, the enemy
were driven back and our pickets established
in advance of their original line.
The 2W&tmeV correspondent with Warren’s
Corps says Sussex Court House was burned in
retaliation for the murder of three of our
men and the stripping and exposure of their
bodies by the roadside. The town consisted
of a court house, jail, tavern and twelve
dwelling houses. *
Hill’s Corps left our front the same day that
Warren started. The rebels' foiled to anlici
patc-Wa»rcn’B movement, and evidently ex
pected another attack on the South Side
Bailroad, and bad made preparations for its
defense. ' .
The Bcrdd* special with Warren’s corps,
gives particulars of the march, and condition
of the country visited, Plantations were fre
quent and laige and gave evidence of high
cultivation. There was a groat abundance of
corn, sweet potatoes, fodder and live stock.*
Thousands of bnshelsof grain were found-in
cribs, and hundreds of acres yet in stalk. No
corn belonging to private parties was destroy
ed except In Distances of owners, expressly
obnoxious. Apples, whisky and brandy
were found in abundance, seventy-six barrels
In one' lot and one hundred in an
other. Fruit was also ' found in large
quantities. Many of the inhabitants
seemed reasonably provided, with subsis
tence. The culture of sorghum was the fea
ture of tbe plantations passed. Almost all
had their own .mills and evaporators for
making syrups. ’Horses and mules were hid
den in woods and swamps, but cattle and
hogs were too numerous to be thus disposed
of. Chickens, turkeys, and geese were in
abundance. ’The negroes welcomedus every
where, and returned with the troops in con
siderable numbers. But little public proper
ty was captured or destroyed at, Susses C. H.
Vt e secured a smalHot of powder but the car
bines had just been removed.
The United States Sanitary Commission
sent four agents and two four-horse "wagons,
loaded with hospital supplies with the expo-,
dition to the Weldon Railroad, under Gen.
Warren.
Fokthess Monroe, Dec. 13th—via New’
York, Dec. 14.—The steamahip-Arago arriv
ed last evening, having in tow the U. S. gun
boat Augusta, Laving broken down,-from Port
Royal with Important dispatches from Gen.
Foster.
The latest news from Sherman at the time
the Aragb left on thefitb, was that his ad
vance troops, consisting mostly of .cavalry
and light artillery, had reached a point forty
miles from Bavannah, and was steadily feci
.inghlsway towards that city with every
prospect of taking it with bat little loss to
his army.: He hud succeeded in severing the
railway communication leading to Savannah,
and had cut an important route of supplies
for the troops that werfe hastily assembled
for its defense.
The bombardment of Charleston had been
suspended, and Colonel Mulford was rapidly
pushing forward his arrangements for the
exchange of the balance of the Union prison
ers. Most intense consternation is said, by
our men recently exchanged, to prevail not
only in Savannah, where the authcrltieswere
hourly, expecting Sherman’s vanguard, but
also iu,Charleston. The exchange of prisoners
is progressing very favorably, considering the
slate of affairs at Charleston, and no doubts
are entertained that Col. Mulford will fill the
remaining vessels of our fleet with men.
The rebel authorities allow no papers to be
exchanged, so that it is almost impossible to
obtain any idea of Sherman’s operations or
progress.
The Charleston Mercury of the Cth has the
following, tbe only item of intelligence from
Savannah of yesterday morning
“Sherman’s army Is proving .the scourge
wherever U goes. Ho attention is paid by
his troop's to his general order issued at the
outset of his expedition. Throughout the
whole line of march the country has been !
made desolate by. pillage and fire. We trust
that a righteous retribution awaits] the van
dals. A gentlcmaurwho reached here yester
day, from the country, reports that he cross
ed »£thc Yankee telegraph wire running
through a swamp, in the direction of Savan
nah River. The other cud readied probably
to the other camp, above Milieu, lie tried
bard to break it, but did not succeed.
