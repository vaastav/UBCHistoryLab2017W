Hayfs' first Annual Message was
delivered to Congress on Monday.
We bad already too much matter in
type when it was received to publish
it this week. Its moat notable features
sire the views on toe finance question,
in which the 'President' clearly inti
mates that he will interpose his veto
ofthebillto repeal tbc Resumption
Act, aad that to remonetize silver,
should they pass.
Doc. Sipdali. who was recently
tried for the killing of McClure in
Canton and found guilty only of as
sault and battery, has been sentenced
to pay a fine of one dollar.
A recent decision of the Postoffice
Department says postmasters have the
right to read the contents of postal
cards, and to exclude them from the
mails if containing Indecent, obscene
or lascivious delineations, bnt the in
formation thus obtained muat not be
divulged, or in any way made public.
- Ok the 28th ult., a party of thirty
colonists bound for Arkansas started
from Pittsburgh on a flat-boaton the
Ohio River. A little distance below
New Point Bridge the boat became
unmanageable owing to the breaking
of a steering oar, struck a barge fleet,
broke to pieces and five of the colon
ists were drowned.
The Second National Bank of La
fayette, Indianaospended on the 28tb
ult., owing depositors $200,000 among
whom was the County Treasurer to
the amount of $40,000. The cashier,
who was at home sick, in a note to the
President of the Bank, confesses him
self a defaulter to the amount of $57,
000. Awothcr Herri flnrdef In Cleve
land. About mid day last Sunday a most
cold-blooded murder was committed
at a bagnio on Cross street Cleveland,
kept by one Laura Lane. The mur
derer is a young man named Charles
R. McGill, and bis victim ayonng wo
man, twenty-five years old, who went
by the name of Msry Kelley. In an
interview with the Herald reporter
the murderer related the manner in
which the horrible crime was commit
ted. He says that be held her in his
arms when be shot her and they were
lying face to face. The first shot
track her behind the right ear, when
lie fired the other six ohots of the re
volver and then reloaded the weapon
and whan he saw her move he raised
her left arm and aimed as near her
heart as he could and fired. The shot
act the woman's clothes and the bed
clothing on fire which he stopped 1o
pot out, and then fired another thoi
which strnek her between thp eyes and
finished her. Jealousy seems to have
been the cause of the cold blooded
crime. Bnt the murderer expresses
no compunctions at the horrid affair.

After our fine warm Full, Winter hat.
come again, and I think, has 'come to
stay,' at least for the present, but farm
ers are generally prepared for it and
some of them are even beginiug to
talk about sugar-making.
We have had a raid by a Young?
town firm in the person of J. G. Wins
worth, who offers everything 'in the
line of fixtures such as buckets, spouts,
arch-pans for boiling, tanks for stor
ing and gathering sap, all complete,
manufactured out of iron and by a
new process rendered rust proof and
many of on r farmers hare bought to
test and pay for on condition that all
Is straight. Thirty-three hundred
buckets, eighteen iron arches and
twenty-two sets of pans are already
sold to our farmers on the above con
dition and still the raid continues.
Fall-sown wheat looks well, and
there has been three or four times the
usual quantity sown. The fly has
troubled it some but to what exten
harvest will tell.
About a week ago Mr. G. L. Riley
had four fine fiat steers stolen from a
back pasture. Fortunately he discov
ered the theft in time to make close
pursuit and found his stock early the
next day in Newburgh. The cattle
were in a wheat field a little way from
the road but the thieves hsd vanished.
Of course as he had more care for his
property than the character who stole
it, he took his pets and returned
home rejoicing.
The fall term of the Aurora Center
al high school, under the tutorship of
Mr. H. R- Spencer of Ashtabula coun
ty, and Miss Hattie Hosford, of Hud

Interested.
The winter term commences Dec.
31, under the same teachers.
Thanksgiving was generally observ
ed by our citizens. Prest. Hinsdale
delivered an eloquent and forceable
address at the Disciple Church to a
good audience of appreciative listners
The dance at the Aurora House in the
evening was well patronized.
Twice during the past week the
church bell has warned na that anoth

AHOlfC THE HILLS.
South Valley, Otsego Co., N. Y.
November 25th, 1877.
After an absence of many days, I
I send you greeting from the rocks and
hills of the old Empire State. Six
weeks ago, one dark and windy eve
ning, we boarded the New York Ex
press and came shooting through for
est and field, and in the morning found
ourselves near Hornersville, N. Y.
Alter a half day's ride in the easy
chairs ot the Pullman palace car, we
reached Bingbampton, where we
changed to the Albany & Susquehanna
road, and at 4 p. m., reached onr des
tination a little village nestled among
the hills, where one can almost imag
ine they had been dropped down
from the skies. One lovely day in
October I climbed to the top of the
highest hill, and as I gazed into the
quiet village below and out over the
other hills, I could only thiuk "as the
hills are round about Jerusalem." The
trees gleamed gloriously in their Au
tumnal robes when we iirst came, but
the cold chilling winds of November
have stolen away their beauty, aud
now they are bare and cheerless. In
dian Summer, I I hink, has. forgotten to
come this way. for we have not 6ecn a
glimpse of the golden day?, veiled with
a mist of beauty. The pleasant days
have been rare. It is a much colder
climate here than Ohio, and I think it
would compare favorably with Iowa.
Apples are scarce, bnt plums were a
bountiful crop aud sold very cheap
Hops are the staple product, and many
who have their last year's crop holding
as well as this year's, will at the prices,
realize very little money. Old hops
which last year could have been sold
for 35, now cannot command a price
over 3 cents, aud hardly that.
Last week I took a journey through
a portiou of Otsego and Montgomery
counties. I was shown the hill near
Cherry Valley where, over a hundred
years ago, the Indians 6toIe stealthily
down in the gray dawn and massa
cred the sleeping victims who lived at
the foot of the mountain, and then,
not content, passed on and burned the
town of Cherry Valley and killed
many of the people. No grass grows
in the path down which they marched
to their bloody work of death. There
is soon to be a monument erected to
the memory of those who were mas
sacred at Cherry Valley. Lea vine the
latter place with the pleasant homes
behind us, we pass on and at last pause
at the foot of Prospect Hill, the high
est land in Otsego. From this point
we have a fine view of the Mohawk
valley stretching out in the distance.
We could trace the winding of the
river by the Hue of fog above it. To
the right, many miles away, we conld
see dimly outlined the highest peaks
of the cloud-capped Adirondacks, and
far away to the northward, gleam
ing through the blue mist, we can
faintly see far off Canada. After a few
days sojourn with friends here and
there, and a delightful ride throusrh a
portion of the Mohawk Valley, we
reached Fort Plain, on the Mohiwk
riyer, a nice business place. The de
scendants of the Hollanders still live
in the valley, and are wealthy farmers
living in fine bouses, with immense
barns in which their grain and bay is
all put. I saw no hay stacked in the
field. The hospitality of the New
Yorkers is universal, and they extend
to the stranger a warm welcome, but
among the good things they give us I
cannot agree with them that saur krant
i delicious. Courtesy forbids my dis
puting upon the point, but oh! my
nasal organ does not lie to inc. Curi
osity impelled me to taste it, and I
will say it does not seem po very bad
if the fragrance were a little more
sweet; but no, it is not.
I visited the popular summer resort
of Sharon Spring", while in that vicin
ity, although a rather unseasonable
time of year. It is a pleasant place
nestled in a valley, with many fine ho
tels for summer boarders- The most
prominent among' these is the Pavilion
where many hundreds may be furnish
ed with rooms and is connected with
the eating house by a covered passasre.
The background of the spring i- a fine
ptrk on the hillside. The scene must
be lively in Summer, when fo many
come to iate the healing waters. I
hope to visit Cooperstown soon and
see the home where James Fennimore
Cooper lived, and to stand by his
tomb and look over the waters of the
lake he loved so well, and whose mem
ory he has perpetuated in his works
From your paper I learn that an
other of my friends has gone home
after much suffering. She lived among
my friends of earliest memory and
was the first who guided my steps and
ttained ray mind in the bumble temple
of learning. Then, and in all the
years which have intervened she ever
had a pleasant word for her sometime
pupil. Farewell, teacher, friend and
neighbor, thine is the better part the
battle fought, the victory won. Fare
well, farewell. Embury.

PULPIT POLITICS.
Thnnktf ivlnr Services it the New
Disciple Church.
Mr. Editor : I deem it to the inter
est of truth and to the interest of those
of your readers who were listeners to
the discourse of Bey. Hills on Thurs
day morning last, to note some of the
features and the effect of that political
tirade. That it was interesting I shall
not hesitate to admit ; but that it was
an abuse of a privilege, that no practi
cil good conld possibly arise from
such an harrangue, that it was a false
picture with faulty colors and that it
was pregnant with gross exaggera
tion and false logic,! was forced to be
lieve. The speaker, at the commence
ment of his discourse, alluded to the
license that by custom was granted to
pulpit orators on such occasions as an
excuse for the attitude he was about
to assume in the pulpit of a Christian
church. But custom can never license
a disregard of that injunction of Holy
Writ, "Preach Christ and Him crucifi
ed." But custom is followed, and when
it allows these must-be Christians to
lay aside the mask that gives an un
natural length to their countenances,
to see them grasp the opportunity as a
golden moment, and dive down deep
into the cesspool of political corrup
tion in the hope to "drag up drowed
honor by the locks," only shows what
is uppermost in their minds and
proves that when by a chance wind
the Christiau cloak that enwraps I lie in
is rent, a form is seen like unto other
men, with aspirations thp same, look
ing no higher than worldly favors and
honors that men confer.
It wo give our nod of assent to say
ing aud sentiments, let it not be be
cause they are heard from the pulpit,
but because of the utterances them
selves. A large part of the audience of Rev
Hills were of the gentler sex whose
worth and chief enjoyment, consist in
the confidence they have iu and mani
fest toward those on whom they de
pend; and how that confidence
must have been shaken, and their
hearts pained to hear, from one who
assumed to know and whose words
they accept as Gospel trulb, those who
were the favored of the land, holding
the highest positions in the gilt of a
grcaf, intelligent people, the gray
haired sires and the middle aged pa
triots, characterized, without discrim
ination, as liars, perjurers, slanderous
political tricksters, gamblers, traitors
to humanity and enemies to their
country, and when they drew a com
parison between those of national re
nown who 'bear blushing honors thick
upon them,' aud their plodding idols
at home, the merchant in the little
dark store room, the farmer at his
plow, the laborer diggiug iu the street
how belittled each one must have felt
to think she had lived to no better
purpose thau strive to lend a charm
and comfort to one that was undeserv
ing, and how the respect toward that
former idol must have died away as
she beard such epithets applied to the
favored and honored sons of America.
There arc two methods adopted for
moral instruction. '1 he one by the
true moral teacher, who marks out the
path ot duty, tells of the virtues of
good men, and draws the line of tuau'i!
perfection ; the other by the tachcr of
corruption whoee perverted judgment
has caused him to believe that morali
ty is taught by exciting the imagina
tion' and parading before that bewild
ered imagination the vices and cor
ruptions of men, going beyond the
limit of human degradation, and when
no hero is known to serve thoir pur
pose, imagine aud paint one, till him
with rottenness from head to foot aud
then set lei in up as a specimen of aver
age humanity. Such teachers always
give off the Inferential conclusion that
they are an exception to the monster
thus formed.
Such was the attitude our instructor
assumed on Thursday morning, aud
such the horrid scare-crow, illustra
tive of the character of the honored
rulers of to-day, erected to 'scatter
doubts and danger, wriugiug of the
conscience, fears aud despairs' among
the people, and cause them to believe
that, unless they, God's choseu, the
lew exceptions, should become the
rulers o!" this nation, the pillars ot her
institutions would be hewn down. and
we crushed beneath the ruins of her
mighty temple. Hd one been ignor
ant ot facts ho would have supposed
from this wholesale impeachment ot
American honor, that this was an age
of unparalleled crime aud commotion,
that security for property, liberty and
life was a stranger, and that we, as a
nation, like pious JEneas of old was
launched out into the deep, plowing
the foaming billows of au angry sea
with a shattered ship, while Halus,
the God of the wiuds.waa smiting the
hollow mountain's side with his spear
frora which rush forth at every vcut
the obedient winds aud tear up the
whole deep from its lowest bottom
But Nepture, the God of the sea, bade
the winds lo fly apace and tell their
king that not to him the empire of the
sea and the aw jl trident had been giv-i
en ;that his dominions were the mighty
rocks,and iu that palace let king ..Eolus
proudly boast, and reign in the clase
prison of the winds.
So while these fire eaters aud politi
cal agitators may smite the hollow
mountain uutil the winds therefrom
may i ullle the waters upou which sails
the ship of state yet the serene coun
tenance of the God who guides that
ship will bid them to their temple
That there are abuses of the privileges
given to those who are our temporary
rulers, is true. It has always been the
same. Wu can reasonably expect
nothing else. That every year brings
with it new commotions, aud its his
tory records crimes before uuknow is
likewise true. But why should this
alarm us ? The history of every year
does the same. Let the commotious
and disturbances of any half decade
be enumerated and spoken ot as of the
present and occurring as it were at our
door, and at first thought it would
startle and alarm us; but give the
dates of these uprisings aud outbreaks,
one this year, oue the year previous
and so on ; and then point out the
places where they occured, one on
Atlantic coast, another onPacific slope ;
one in the wintry regions of Lake
Superior, another in the sunny South,
different feeling comes over us.
With au intellectual eui vey taking In
the vast extent of our country, the
armies ol human souls that people it,
people of all nationalities and every
condition in life, and then see with
what security they all enjoy free
thought and free speech, how all are
protected in life, liberty, the right of
possession, aud the pursuit of happi
ness, and how shame would cover us
as with a mantle did we characterize
as perjurers, public robbers, specula
tors and enemies of equal rights,those
human benefactors, the law-givers of
our nation, who thus guard our inter
est and save us irom the 'oppressor's
wrong.' In no other age or no other
nation could the broils aud revolution
ary thundering of the last year have
been silenced with such universal sat
isfaction. It was the work of the pat
riots and statesmen who to-day fill the
halls of our Congress, aud merit all
the honor that men cau bestow.
He detiounced as fbe vilest repudia
torsofthe public debt, those who
were the authors and supporter ot
that bill which is to restore to silver
its monetary power. How is it re
pudiation? That bill only repeals an
act that passed since the contract of
the public debt had been ni ide and
leaves the contract as it was when en
tered into. What injustice is there in
that? Morton said it would do foul
injustice lo the Government and the
people to pay the public debt iu a dif
ferent kind of money than that first
contracted. Thad. Stevens said it
would be a swindle upon taxpayers.
Sherman said it would be evortion
on the part of bondholder to require
it. The Represent ati ves of the people
in Congress knew by thn late elections,
by the resolutions of the people in
Conventions, what their constituents
required at their hands. By this act
they have only carried out the wishe
a a . . . .
ami BMHSn ot t he people. t he in
tercst and Welfare ot fbe people re
quired this measure. Edmund Burke
said in Parliament that 'it is to the
property offhe citizen, and not. to the
demand-! of the creditor of the State,
that the original faith of society is
pledged. The claim of the citi7.cn is
prior in time, paramount in title, su
perior in equity.' What did he pro
pose for all the evils of the day ? Why,
that the right of the elective franchise
be withheld from tho foreigner, be ta
ken from the ignorant and illiterate,
aud that those who wear the cloak of
Gospel ministry become the politiciaus
and legislators of this Nation. That
is, to build up an aristocracy with an
intolerant priesthood at its head. Let
the foreigner be the hawer of wood,
he said ; yes ; but don't let the preach
er be preacher, oh no I let him be po
tentate ! The preacher s soliloquy
should run 'I prayed, and I talked,
and I exhorted, and 1 wore a long face
and I made (oiks think I was gocd
and I knelt by' the dying, aud I gave
away iu marriage, and 1 baptised in
fants, and I won an influence. Aud
then 1 forsook Christ aud took up pol
itics. And I taught my people to, and
did myself hate,and vilify.aud slauder,
and abuse, and insult aud quarrel with
those who did not agree with me in
politics. Ami I instilled discord, en-
i vy, auger, and wickedness into the
heart of tho siciple oues who were
'confided to my charge.'
Tho dangers of Romanism in Amer
ica was also a theme for his comments,
and ho gave to that a political signifi
cance. He said iu effect that Roman
Ism was destined to upturn aud raze
to tho ground the free institutions of
America UnJess some active measures

Docs he mean by this to counsel war?
What other meaning can ho given ?
Let me say that Republicanism in
America is implanted too deep iu the
hearts of the common people, Protest
ant and Catholic, native and foreign
born, to bo plucl.ed up by any priest
or power. Lot iho bulls of the Pope

Back Seat.
The Kadical papers have very re
cently made the discovery that Sena
tor Patterson, of Ssouth Carolina, is a
carpet-bog scoundrel, and demand that
he be expelled from tho Senate. Ttiey
have very recently had a eh autre of
wind, for Patterson was elected by
their party to the Senate and lias been j
maintained in his seat up to this time j
by the Radical party; and now, be-i
cause he votes to seat General Butler j
who, he says was elected lo the Senate j
by the Legislature of that State, and i
who he says he knows to be the choice
of the people, they declare that he
ought to be sent to the penitentiary.

CONGRESS.
In the Senate the proceedings for
the last week have been so exciting
that they have thrown those of the

the Senate opened on Monday, 'Greek
met Greek,' and the battle raged hot
and fierce. Personal encounters were
the order of the day, and the session
continued throughout the night and
up to Tuesday noon, with no inter-
mission of even a few moments for
mission ot even a lew moments iot
,
refreshments. Tho Radicals fought
desperate as demons, but were PUt
hors-du combat by the strategy of our
Democratic friends. So intense was
the interest felt that the spectators
even remaiued all night iu the galleries.
Radical saint Edmunds occupied most
of the time in low, slangy denuticia-
tionof Messrs. Conover aud Patterson,
and continued to such a beastly extent
that the more reapcctible members of
his own party became disgusted, and
assisted him not in his last dying ef
fort to save tho Senate from Demo
cratic rule. Our friends displayed
quietness, yet firmness, paying (So ai
tention to his indecent remarks, but
stubbornly awaited the lime to come
to cast their votes. Edmunds was in
terrupted and remind' d that his own
side had attempted to influence Sena
tors Conover aud Patterson in their
votes on the pending question, and the
reminder so dumbfounded him that he
almost choked with rage, being unable
to com rover: t be a-sei t inn. Patterson

o'clock on Tuesday morning there wa
no prospect ol a com jrm'-e, antrt the
fillibostering continued throughout
the day and continuously up to 3 p m .
when a vote on the main question was
forced bv our Democratic friends, and
resulted in our carrying the uninter
rupted fight of two days and a night
by a vote of 29 to 27 ; Conover and
Patterson coming down to the Demo
cratic score in tine style, aud the vic
tory was ours. The whole of this des
perate encounter, principally between
our giant Thurman and Radical Ed
munds ; was an endeavor ou the part
of the Republicans to ' bulldoze Con
over and Patterson into voting with
them, with the above referred to igno
minious defeat. It was ' a good day
tor Democrats.' During the heat of
the light, and while Republican Mc
Millan, who is a good blue-stocking
Presbyterian, was getting off hisbest,
our friend, General Cockrell, walked
over to McMillan, and handing him a
Presbyterian hymn book, snggested he
should read the hymn, 'Hark, from
the tomb a doleful sound.' Mad ihe
Rads mixed a little coaxing with judi
cious management they might have
wou the votes of Patterson and Couo
ver, but the ' bulldozing' pill wouldn't
go down. Honey catches more flies
i ban vinegar. The Radical Sx7 ver
dict is hurling its avalanco of wrath
upon its perpetrators, and the bowl
ings of the terror stricken Radicals
cannot be described with pen aud ink
and do tho subject justice. Tha result
of the above vote was barely anuouiic
ed before friend Thurman sprang to
his feet and moved to take up the case
of Duller, of S. (J. Saint Edmunds
met this with a couuter-motion to ad
journ. and although Thurman was the
first to address the chair. Vice Presi
dent (?) Wheeler, snowed his cloven
foot aud recognized Edmund, which
resulted in Edniuuds' motion to ad
iouru being instantly voted down. It
w:i3 finally agreed by our friends to
rciist an adjournment for the day no
longer, as everyone was pretty well
worn out, and the fruits of substantial
victory rested with our side, so the
Senate, at 4 o'clock, adjourned, having
been iu continuous session some twen

Wednesday the battle wits a;.in re
newed with redoubled energy, on a
motion by iiieud Titurnitu: to take up
the case of Mr. l.utler, for admission,
in preference to Kellojrg's case. Toe
uncertainty ol the votes of Conover
and Patterson, on tho motion, hung
over the chamber like a midnight pall,
and had the eU'ect to cloud the result,
which was about to begin, in doubt.
On the roll beinj called, Conover
emerged from the cloak room as his

the arm by Radical Dorsey, was, fig
uratively speaking, dragged to his seat
and bolstered up with Dorsey on. one
side aud some other li'td on the other.
In the meantime old man Dorsey ran
his hand up under the coat-tail ot Con
over and squeezed his spine so hard
that his voice came Irom be! ween his

this was a black eye given to our side.
An air of relief pervaded tho Radical
side, as the above result gave them the
vantage grouud. The Rids have evi
dently bought over Conover, whilst
ourfriends persistently refuse to enter
into any alliance whatever. At tliis
point friend Thiirmau raised theqoea
tion as to the right ol Vice Wheeler
to vote on questions of this kind,
which remains at present unsettled.

Senator Will DO declared Vacant, Which
emark caused quite a consternation of
surprise among the Rads. Conover

gaiu the advantage over the other, and !
that he had no understanding With
either the Democrats or Benublicans.

which is regarded bv our friends as

B,u, er and at precisely 12 m. Thurs
day, the hor-ts were in martial array
promptly, aud entered the chamber al
most simultaneously, with the hot
j Dreath of excited ambition flushing
j thejr careworn brows. Both sides
drU(cd a,ong waith)g for evenls to
shape themselves, all hopes of a
Thanksgiyiug dinner at home being
already abandoned, all contenting
themselves throughout the day with
such a lunch as they could momenta
rily procure in the Seuate restaurant
The galleries were filled to suffocation
and the floor was densely packed with
members from the House, among
whom we prominently noticed, Speak
er Randall, Postmaster General Key.
Secretary Sherman and many other
notables. All interest centered about
the spot where a furious battle was
about to lake place. During the day
violent attempts and cunning schemes
on the part of the Radicals were put
iu force to bulldoze Senator Patterson
into deserting Cutler, without any ef
fect whatever, as he stood firm as the
rock of Gibraltar, and swerved not a
hair's breadth from his steadfast
course he had so gallantly maintained
in ilte past, Patterson's intercourse
during the day was confined almost
entirely to the Democratic side, whilst
Conover was ever and auon flitting
from side to side, evidently feeliug in
high glee over tho importance of his
position, and the respect and flattering
attention he commanded from the Re
publicans. A motion was made and
carried to go into executive session,
whereupon tho two prominent oppj s
iug leaders Messrs. Thurman and Ed
munds, paired with each other and
left for home, and the Senate, at 5 p.
m., adjourned. Thus, up to the clos

do iu order to reach the mail in tin e
for your columns, nearly a whole wok
has been consumed in parliamentary
filiibpsterlng and nothing dtflaitely
accomplished. In our next we hope
