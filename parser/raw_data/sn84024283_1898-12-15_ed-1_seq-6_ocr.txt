The War with Spain Officially
Brought to a Close by the
Peace Commissioners.
THE CLOSE WAS A SCENE FOR A PAINTER;
The DocDmentvat Signed at 8:45 p. id., oa
the Night of the loth It Consists of
Seventeen Articles, Making 7 ,600 Words
The Spaniards were Sadly Depressed
Over the Final Action.
Paris, Dec. 11. There were two
joint sessions of the peace commis
sions Saturday, one lasting from
3:50 p. m., to 5:15 p. m., and
the other opening at 7 p. m. The long
session in the afternoon and the sub
sequent recess were due only to the
fact that each article of the treaty had
to be carefully read and compared in
Spanish and English, and to the fact
that the engrossing of the last article
in Spanish was incomplete. During
the wait the commissioners were pho
tographed. The treaty was signed at 8:45 p. m.
A SCENE FOR A PAINTING.
The signing of the treaty would have
afforded a subject for a great historic
painting. The group gathered about
the table in the stately chamber of the
foreign office was impressive in itself,
while the fact that the sense of the
momentousness of the issues which
the act decided was deeply felt by all
the participants gave an impressive
and solemn tone to the scene. Around
the great mahogany table sat the ten
arbiters of the destinies of an old and
a young nation. Ranged, standing be
hind them, were numerous attaches of
the American commission. The jets
from the crystal chandeliers above the
heads of those present magnified the
brilliant green and scarlet of the up
holstering in their gaudiness. There
was the attraction of a contrast be
tween the black clothed actors and the
scenery.
To the Americans it was a happy
ending of the epilogue of war; for the
Spaniards it was plainly a bitter trage
dy, none the less painful because long
foreseen. They sat silently, as though
almost crushed, and none could with
hold sympathy for Senor Montero
Rios, the president of- the Spanish com
mission, who, coming from his bed,
was bundled in a great overcoat,
though logs were burning in the fire
place near by. The spirits of the two
bodies were symbolized by the clothes
worn by the members of the commis
sion, for the Americans were attired
in evening dress for the dinner given
them immediately after the meeting
by the Due d'Loubat, and the Span
iards wore black frock coats.
Although the commissions met at
3:30 o'clock, expecting to finish their
work in half an hour, the engrossing
of the treaty on parchment was found
to be so troublesome that it "Belayed
the signing of the document until
8:20 o'clock. Clerk Martin, of the
American commission, worked all day
without even stopping to eat. When
he came into the chamber at 7:30
with the document he found the com
missioners waiting. .The Spanish
copy had arrived a half hour earlier.
ORDER OF SIGNATURES.
Mr.. Arthur Ferguson then proceed
ed to read first the English, and after
that the Spanish, version of the
treaty. This finished, two copies
were passed around ,the table, the
commissioners signing them in the
order of their ranfe William R. Day,
Senator Cushman K. Davis, Senator
William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid and
Senator George Gray; Senor Montero
Rios, Senor Abarzuza, Senor Garnica,
Senor Villaurutia and Gen. Cerero y
Saons, each commission signing its
opponent's treaty. Both were tied
with the Spanish and American col
ors. When the seals were affixed, at
tendants were sent scurrying for rib
bons of the French tri-color, with
which the documents were sealed, in
compliment to the French hosts of the
commission.
Many officials' interested watched
every detail of the proceeding. The
last seal being impressed, the com
missioners rose, and, without formali
ty, each member shook the hands of
ail his antagonists, and each gave as
surances of sincere personal esteem.
The Spaniards afterward comment
ed acridly upon what they termed the
bad taste of the Americans in muster
ing a crowd of attaches to gloat over
the consummation of their downfall
and to scramble for relics.
The signing was finished at 8:45.
At that time the door, of the chamber
opened.and Senor Villaurutia appeared
and exclaimed to a group . of corre
spondents who were waiting in the
corridor: "C'Est Mni." The other
members of the Spanish commission
followed Senor Villaurutia and passed
silently through the vestibule to their
waiting carriages. The American com
missipn strolled out, chatted compla
cently, and as the descended the
steps the lights in the chamber were
darkened.
Hobson to Ieave San Francisco for Hone
Kong December 24.
Washington, Dec. 11. Naval Con

The Fight in Chicago Over the Granting
of a New Charter to the Street
Car Companies.
Chicago, Dec. 13. The ordinance ex
tending the franchise of the Chicago
street car companies for 50 years came
up in the city council last night, and
was referred to the council committee
on railroads. On all votes touching
the ordinance the friends of the meas
ure were a strong minority, and unless

there is no probability that they will
ever be able to pass it over the veto of
Mayor Harrison.
Was Little Excitement Aronnd the City
. Hall.
Contrary to general expectations
there was little excitement around the
city hall, and although the council
chamber was packed to suffocation,
and a crowd filled the outside corri
dors, the number of people" present
was but little larger than usual. The
crowd, was, however, against the fran
chise proposition to a man, and made
no pretense of keeping its convictions
a secret. Adherents to the franchise
were openly hissed' when they at
tempted to gain a point for their meas
ure, and loud yells greeted the an
nouncement of a vote by which the
ordinance was referred.
Defied the Spirit of the Crowd.
Alderman Mclnerny made a speech
to a certain extent defying the spirit
shown by the galleries, and from that
time to the adjournment he was the
object of numerous remarks from the
outsiders, many of them being warmly
personal. The crowd, however, was
good natured, and there were no dem
onstrations. The railroad committee, which now
has the ordinance in charge, is com
posed of 13 members, 11 of whom last
night voted as friends of franchise ex
tension. Brought Up the Franchise Question.
Alderman Walsh was first in bring
ing up the franchise question. He in
terrupted the regularorder of business
in the council with a motion that the
vote of the last session, committing
the franchise extension ordinances to
the joint committee on streets and al
leys, west, north and. south, be recon
sidered. He was ruled out of order on
the ground that the rules had not been
suspended and the regular order of
business should obtain.
Some routine matters were soon put
out of the way, and Alderman Maltby,
a strong opponent of the extension of
the franchises, jumped up with a mo
tion that no ordinance whatever, ex
tending existing street railway .fran
chises shall be passed and that no pro
posals to that end shall be entertained
until the socalled Allen law shall have
been repealed.
The Fight On in Earnest.
This brought on the fight in earnest
and in a second half a dozen aldermen
were on their feet, shouting and ges
ticulating frantic efforts for recogni
tion by the mayor. He gave the floor
to Alderman Walsh, who had intro
duced the first franchise motion of the
evening. Alderman WTalsh asked Al
derman Maltby to withdraw his mo
tion temporarily as he wished to intro
duce a resolution providing that the
vote by which the ordinance granting
an extension of franchises tothe street
car companies of the city of Chicago
be reconsidered.
Alderman Walsh's Motion Before the
House.
Alderman Maltby withdrew his reso
lution, and the motion of Alderman
Walsh was before the house.
"I move it be laid on the tabic,"
shouted Alderman O'Brien,- who is a
champion of the car companies.
The motion was lost by a vote of
26 to 37. The vote for a reconsidera
tion was then carried by 37 to 26. This
was the first test of strength, and the
foes of the extension were in high
glee.
Referred to the Municipal Committee on
Railroads.
Immediately after the passage of
Alderman Walsh's motion to reconsid
er, Mayor Harrison referred the ordi
nance to the municipal committee on
railroads.
Debate then followed upon the mo
tion of Alderman Maltby shutting off
passage of any ordinance looking to
the extension of local street car fran
chises "until after the repeal of the
Allen law."
Alderman Maltby moved a suspen
sion of the rules to permit the consid
eration of his motion, but -was de
feated. A HEAVY DEAL IN TOBACCO.

It Relates to the Famous De Lome-
Letter That Proved the Spanish
Minister's Undoing. ' ',
CUBAN JUNTA ALWAYS ON THE ALERT.
Ths Minister Well-Known GellT
Taken Advantace of to Secure nror
nation, and a Cuban Posing- as a Vensa-
lam Turned the Trick of Securing- P"
session of the Unlucky Letter.
Chicago, Dec.Tl The Jurn
prints an interview with Senor Carlos
Vincente de Quesada y Socarras, cous--in
of Secretary Quesada of the CuDa""
junta, and son of Gen. Quesada y
Aguiar, who commanded part of tne
Cuban forces during the ten years
war for independence. According to
the interview Senor Quesada claims -that
the famous "De Lome letter, !
written by the Spanish minister ndt-r
culing President McKinley, was stolea
in the United States, and not in Hnv--
ana. . n -
Quesada, who fought under all or
the prominent Cuban leaders, and who
was present at the death of Maceo,
says that De Lome's gallantry led to
his downfall; that a woman in the em
ploy of .the junta learned many of the
Spanish minister's secrets. "There -were
many parties to the conspiracy
which resulted in the theft of the De
Lome letter," he said. "The junta had.
worked , trusted agents into the em
ploy of the Spanish legation. These -clerks
kept us posted on all matters;
which they could, but that was not
enough.
So it was arranged that a woman
was to start up a flirtation with Senor -De
Lome and endeavor to gain his con- -Cdence.
"The woman selected to ensnare De -
Lome is now in New York. De Lome
confided many things to her which
he should not.
"When Canalejas came to this coun
try, he was watched every minute. -Through
the influence of friends the -junta
managed to get a Cuban, as a
waiter, into the hotel where he was
stopping. He was supposed to be a
Venezuelan. As he spoke Spanish he -was
naturally assigned to wait on
Canalejas. ' 1
"When the Spanish minister wrote
that letter the junta was promptly in- -formed
that a letter, contents un--
Known, naa Deen written ro anaiejus. -The
letter reached its destination at
the hotel, but it never got to Canalejas.
The Venezuelan waiter took it out of
the package of letters and turned it "
over to the junta.
"The junta sold that letter to a New -York
paper. It was turned over on
the condition, however, that it should
lw Kiinnnsfrl in Viavo lxn stnlon in -
Havana, so as to avoid any trouble -with
the postal authorities. Secretary
of State Day saw it before it was pub
lished."
About the time of the De Lome in
cident Carlos De Quesada was in
Washington in the interest of the jun

KEEP OUR OWN COUNSEL.
Information Concerning- American Neva. :
Affairs Will Not be So Fr.a
It Has Been.
New York, Dec. 11. A special to the
Herald from Washington says:
Actiota has been taken by Secretary
Long to withhold information con
cerning American naval affairj from,
foreign governments. A regulation,
has been issued announcing that '
"formal official information to at-
taches and other foreign officials in
Washington or abroad will be fur
nished through the bureau of naviga-
tion by the office of naval intelli
gence." Thin regulation is due largely to the.
refusal of foreign governments to
give to American officers information
which they seek. Hitherto the au
thorities have been very open with for
eign attaches, but in' the future it it,.
l'kely the secrecy which exists abroad
will be followed here.
