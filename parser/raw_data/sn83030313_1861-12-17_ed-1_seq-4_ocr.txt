SKETCH OF BRlUAlMER GENERAL VIELE.
Egbert L. Viele, who is in charge of the First brigade

The first regular landing of our troops here in force
look plat 0 last night about nine o'clock, when formal pes
session was taken of the town. Tho troops detailed for
the expedition consisted of three reglmsuts, via:?Vir
tloth regiment Ponusylvanla Volimtoers, ltoundlioad
Pennsylvania regiment and Eighth Michigan. Tho
advanoo was formed by the Fiftieth regiment, com
nit tided by Col. B. C. Christs, who came up in the steumer
Ben Iteford. A gunboat led the way, to point out the
cluumel, which is winding and intricate. Immediately
I upon landing a picket guard, composed of ten men se
'ected from each company, waa thrown oat beyond the
outskirts of the town. A slight brush jo^Pjace between
them and a squad of robol cavalry. Ono of our man was
shot by a pistol ball In the neck, and was seriously
wounded. On the other side, two of the rebels are sup- j
posed to have fallen, as two horses with empty saddles
were afterwards found. Tho force of the rebels was pro |
bably small, but owing to the darkneee and the timber
around their number could not bo well" estimated.
I went ashore at tho first opportunity, and started off
with a comrade to tako a quiet si roll by ourselves N?jvcr
have I experienced such an impressive scone. Portico,
pillar and eolonnde of stately mansions rose before mo.
thrown out in strange, mystical rollef by tho uncertain
light of the young mdou. But no lights were seeu willun.
no footfall heard, no hum of voice* that told of happy W"
cupants?a spell hail fallen?Ml was still as the grave' 1
silent as the catacombs. We turned a corner, and sud
denh tho stillness was broken by the harsh volro or 10m
maud, "Attention, battalion', load!'' aad directly tho
sharp raiding of muskets from the long line of troops
drawn up in battle array attested but too well the cause
of tho sad fate of" Tho inserted Village."
Before lauding General Mheruran had given en i' t sn<i
peremptory orders to the troops that no house should be
entered by them, and 110 property of any kind appro
priated, without special permission, under severe peti-lty ?
Tho It'Oiips in eonsequoiicn had to bivouac for the rest ol
the night oa the soft white sand.
Daylight discovered strange sights; mutl.ela were
stacked in the middle of the streets; camp fires burning
sud snuadHof soldiers, hearing evident marks of the fa
tieue of nigh I duty, wer it coking their rat'?n-. Tho
debris of plundered articles were scattered about, and
open doors and windows marked where the negroes
in their tun c drained saturnalia had rlotod and pillaged.
But comparatively few of the "contrabands" were b?'eu
in and about tho (own, the most of them having gone oil
with their manters to the plantations. Those remaining
wera garrulous enough in their accounts of tho flight ol'
"inussa and missis."
Bonuforl is well known as one of the old aristocratic
towns ol'colonial dsto and importance. Its inhabitants
were generally peopto of wealth, refined, hospitable and
courteous, who named alternately the summers here and
tho w luters ou their plantations. Trade and commerce
were pretty touch ignored, and few or uo marks exist of
its hat utg boen a commercial place. A few stoics and
warehouse* are seen, aud two small docks jirobably af
forded ample room for the steamboats that brought llie
planters thoir stores from Chorleston or Havannnli.
Novert Mdcss, it preseuta a very |#eHr view frotp tho
river a id its comfortable, substantial looking mansions,
with verandahs, columns aud wldo pisxaas, uesiling amid
groves of live oak, with the peculiar long, waving rno?-,
give it a dolccjar nient"appearance,suggestive of quiet,
bappinoBS ond'repose.
' The most stylish houses are built on the river front,
with prettily iaid outgardeus,adorned with shrubbery
and beautiful (lowers, blooming even at this season or
the year. Rose* are in profusion of overy virlety, of
both red aud white. Oue largo, venerable looking
house, with its antique hipped roof, semi
circular wings, having the appearance of towers,
winding steps, solid door and brass knocker, seemed u
memento and exponent of forinor palmy days, it is still
in good preservation, ami the well furnished parlors, with
piano,musio,ottomans, Ac., indicated the style of Its
former occupants, as well at proving the haste of their
flight. The negroes hud spared it from pillage apparently,
and probably from a glut of plunder.
I visited some of tbo churches?the principal of which
U the Fplscoital?a plain edifice of brick, plastered to re.
semble stone, having a square to wer In front, with dial
plates for a clock. The Interior was in gupd order, books,
cushions and fans were left in the pews, showing that the
pillager, whoever he ruight be, had thus far respected
the Divine injunction placed in the semi-circular recesa
back of the altar, "To shall reverence my sanctuary."
The pastor was the Rev. Pr. Walker, as I judged from a
notice I picked up in tho channel. The arsenal, a building
about 100 feet long and flrty wide, is a plain structure of
brick, with dontated battlements. A high outer wall ia
built in the same etyle. The yard wgs filled with rubbish,
and a long thirty two with tho trunnions knocked on, bore
evident marks or the destructive visit of Captain Am
moil's men, of the gunboat Seucca, on the 14th ult.

Behold our glorious banner gsyly In the air,
But four hours since base traitors swore wo could not
plant It there;
But brav lhipont, he led us on, to tight the vaunting foe,
And soon the rebel standard wua in the dust laid low.
When we were seen advancing, they laughed with foolich
pride,
.Saying thai soon our Northern fleet they'd sink beneath
the tide;
And with their guns trained carefully they waited our ad
vance,
And the gallant Wabash soon struck up the music for the
dance.
The Susquehanna next In line delivered hor broadside;
With deadly aim each shot was reut,and well each gun
was plied;
Andetillour gallant ship? advance, and etch one as she
peaaed
I'on red in her deadly messengers, and foo( fell thick and
fast.
Each ship advanced in order, each commander wore a
smile,
Until the famed Vandalia brought up the rear in atyle;
And us our guns wero shortest, we balanced to the right,
Which brought us to tho enemy tho closest In the fight.
Then round the room (1'ort Royal bay) we t"Ok ? High
land tllng,

The ucwif from Mexico represents the people?or at

hut these latter will, undoubtedly, find many friends
amougthe reactionary or clergy party, who have re
fused to co operate with the Juarez, government In ro]
polling the Invaders. I lmve been assured that Spain is
preparing to add reinforcements to tlio expeditionary
army until her forces In Mexico shall amount to at lea.v(
twenty thousand uwn. Thfa would look like going to
work in earnest to udd Mexico mice more to the .Si>aui-<b
crown.
On the other hand, there is a party in Spain strongly
opposed to any such design against the independence of
our sister republic; but whether from motive* of pru
dence, or from mere party opposition to the O'lxmncll
clique, la a question. The Spanish bank hero lis* loaned
' ouo million of dollars for expenses attending the expedi
tion, after being requested m lend a hatover sums might
be required. This the bank refused to do unless a sum
were specified, anil a million having beau named and
paid over, tbe directors, I am told, declared 'hat the
lank was unable to do any more. 1 give th? statement
as 1 hoard it; but for lny pari I doubt the truth of the
latter part of it, for reasons which must he apparent to
any one. The bank Is very well able to lend many mil
lions, nud even if tbe directors were ever ?o much op
posed to Qlto])n{U't! Mexican policy, it is not likoh tli ?y
wfeurn fly I" the faro of the government iuitiai manner.
Bui if it be true, ii is a pretty gtrong sjiecimenof the

NEWSPAPEK ACUOIJNTS.
[From tho Mexican Kxtraorilinaty, Nov. -0.1
The position of foreign relations with this country ha ;
been the absorbing topic of the month, ami with ail the
efforts of foreign mtuistcr# and the ingenuity of the mem
bers of the present government. aliairs hive nol unfor
tunately a.-sumert a favorable aspect. The disorders and
demoralization of the republic, from ono extremity to
the other, and in nearly every Slate amf Territory
throughout its length and breadth, which prevail,coupled
with the impoverished condition of the national .finances,
give but liftt* eliance for the pacific settlement of the
questions pending with England, l-'rsnce anil ,-*|iuin, and
with nil our dlspcgition to favor cucli a termination we
frankly cenfess our inability to see how it can be satis
factorily arrived at. The action of the representatives
Of England and Ihe I nited States would load us to believe
thai the whole question turned upon money . but nurrnw
as the difficulty is reduced by this clew <u tlieras?the
Mexican governniont cannot show ii.-elf in jr ail Ion to
settle, and if we arc lo accept Its pl.-a or poi crlv to-day,
what hopo can we entertain for an impro\ anient in the
future! Eetusseo:
The present government started its career somo eleven
month* ago, with the flnest financial prosjiecH, th>-sym
pathies of almost every foreign resident in the republic
and fho well wishes of ovcry foreign nation. It Imd not
only the ordinary revenue of the nation but the entire
wealth Of the church?estimated at near three hundred
millions of dollars?at it? dis|msal. Before it had held
power to? mouths it b id succeeded in destroying the
sympathies entertaiued for it,und at the close of the
seventh month a death blow whs dealt to all the report
entei tinned tiy that portion of tlio foreign residents who
had not Identified themselves In the repartition of the
property of ihe church. The government had disposed
of the church properties and mortgaged the revenues of
the nation for month* ahead, and to crown all suspended
payment* to all inannorol' creditors, evon to those with
whom it Lad just completed the most binding contracts.
Had good come from this pimligul ex|>cudltitre of tbn na
tional wealth, this bartering of tho revenues and this
display of bad faith, Ihere would lun * been left some ex
cuse, but no; instead of the social condition of Ihe country
improving it grew- every day worse. Banditti daily iii
created on the high roads, and ihe public security de
creased in ail parts, until now but few spots in the whole
republic arc safe for either residence or travel.
In July last the representatives of England and France,*
aft?r bai lug agreed upon joint aoiiou. considered the con
dition of the country and the acts of (lie government Jus
tified them in suspending all diplomatic relation*. Mince
that tlmoevcrf successive mall for abroad liHSgnnefroiglit
ed with account* of new disorders and new atrocities of
*11 kinds, without one well grounded ray of hope for Ihe
**WU>lls!>tncut of order or tor the future safety of foreign
life Md property. Tho outcry of indignation raised
throughout the civilized world inconsequence of l hear
countsfrmn Mexico has como back ui>on us, and, Instead
of exciting a wholesome fear, apparently has added lo
Uio animosity against foreigner*. 'Ibis has bran es
pecially manifested against the Spaniards, Mid had not
the government have taken precautionary measures
frightful scenes would have taken place in the city, gut
with all this a number of foreigners hod been attacked
and one at loaal has been muedared. The l*at mail from
Europe also brought decided instructions to both the
representatives of England and France. The character of
those to the French Minister are said to havo been of
such a character a* might have been expected from tho
tone of the English and French presa, ami that gentle
man has been unable to do anything with the Mexican
government, and ha* consequently suspended definitively
all i slat ions. IIewasal*o the medium of convey iug to
the Mexican government tho ultimatum of Mpain." which,
we hear, has'not reoeivcii eren notico from the govern*
mont, it being considered too insulting?in fact, a virtual
declaration of war.
Sir Charles Wyke,the British representative, his taken
a a>ui>e that cannot bo explained by lie, circumstance*
muter which he suspended relations. In that ease he
acted with the French Minister, but Instead of doing so
on this occasion he has taken the opposite coarse, and
apparently been co oporat Jig with the representative of
tue United States, tin-lion, Thomo* ( or win, who is op
posing all measures that may lend toan-n rnarhwenlupoa
the Monroe doctrine. Whether with or without instruo
ti ui-, Sir (hail' i Wy ko has been zealously ciidv,, -in n.i

of the aiTitlr, wbloh, so tar as it lias progressed, is a de

concerted at llio terrific flro poured in oh them,
the oonllagratlon of their Navy Yard (mostly consisting
< f pine building* and tho broadsides from the ships)
that with a couple of Northern regimen!a our victory
would have been complete. Why such reiiiforoi monts
have not boon supplied to us ia a mystery (o every man
in thus regiment, but, I presume I he authorities at Wash

lias also aided considerably in the construction of the
formidable batteries on Oak Island, recently crocted by
tho rebels, and which will, on our ultimate attacks on

quiet until lie had received reinforcements, nppea-c4
to hsre become tired or thai remainTiig Inactive

war lost onn man killed nud six wounded. For the
present hostilities have censed, and I apprehend with
gain to our ride. The Nuvy Yard is reduced to ashes,
and can afford no a, com mod dt ion for tlio Houthern
troops to winter in. Fort Mclluc is cctupleloly disabled,
fast sluicing into hor soft bed of sand, ant
so weak that tlio rebound of her own

seriously damaged, but still presents n formidable front.

Piratical Act.
The MontrC'iil Herald lias an elaborate article in regard
to the Nashville. II takes ground that the British go
vernment., (hmigli it cannot, under the circumstances
refuse hospitality to the Nashville, as tlv vosgoi of a
recognized belligerent, jet sho must not be supplied with
any warlike stores. The ItemUl goes on to say :
The Nashville had prisoners on board: but her
officers did not pretend to hold them as prisoners
when I hoy were once In British waters. But for
the acknowledgment of the belligerent rights of
the South, the Nashville must have boon regarded as a
pirate, and, being ilia enemy of nil nal ;oas, subject to bo
captured by any. It is true that the I sited ritalos aay
that flits acknowledgment was Improper; but it luui been
dellhorat'Iv made, and will no donl,?l ho maintained.
tithe Sou 111 ho not a belligerent, the rupture of Slldell
and llason was uu act of piracy. But there is uhe point
which throws some deuhts over the rights of the Nash
ville?It is the conduct of her commander in burning her
prize. In general it is the law of privateering thai no
vessel shall be esteemed a prize till she baa beat con
demned bv acomjiofent court
We believe that this is provided by British alattilorjr
law : and in thn regulations for privateers, issued in 1803,
the second article directs thai, immediately after a cap
ture, (ho privateer i- to lake ihe prize into some British
port, in order that#glie may bo adjudged. Again, the
fourth article expressly directs that "the .chips, vessels,
goods,wares,merchandise and effects taken by virtue
or loiters of marques anil reprisals, as aforesaid, shall be
kopl and preserved; and no part of them shall be sold,
apoiled, wasted or diminished, and the hulk thereof shall
not be broken before judgment be given in the High
Court of Admiralty ."
The Southern privateer, therefore, manifestly acted in
contradiction to the English law of privateering when
ho burned a prize previous to condemnation, and lor
which hu might not bo in a position 10 indemuify the
owners in case sho worn not auch a ship as a prize court
would havo condemned. The transaction in that light,
has a vory" piraticallook about it. Whether ft would
bo piracy i? an linglisli \ v >?el, by tCugUsh law . wo do not
know; ii wouldcoiUiulj be a high olfnnce.
But it appeal s.tfom llio opinions of some writers, that
the law of F.ngl .nil ou this sub.ioot in not identical with
the law of nations, which permits or the destruction by
n privateer of a captured onein} before adjudication Jm
certain oirctimsiaii., s. Th. se circumataiicee we hIiouW
take to ho physical difficulties, suth as s tonne, making It
impossible to hi iiig the capt irod ship inio port.
