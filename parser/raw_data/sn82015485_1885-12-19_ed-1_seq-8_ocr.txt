Breakfast Tabic Letter to the
rrcsiilcnl.
Washington National Republican, Editorial.
Mil. PjiKsmcNr: The sudden death of
Thomas A. Luidricks,, vice president of
the Unitod States, in' the quiet o his
homo at Indianapolis, Ind., has produced
a profound fcensation. By the death of
the- second ofliecr of tho lepublic tho
people are aroused and awakened to the
iaefc of tho existence of a mighty chasm
in our iorm of government, upon the
brink of which they stand to-day.
The failure to enact a wise law to meet
tho situation, such a. measure as a Re
publican senate passed and a Democratic
house of representatives neglected to ac
cept, this fact uses the i espoiibi'uility of
criminal failure and want of statesman
ship upon tho Democratic paity on a
question vital to tho continuance of our
government under constitutional forms.
Jf tho death of tho vice president shall
produce such action as shall protect our
people from tho evils of an unauthorized
government, lie will not have died in
vain. All clashes of our people, embrac
ing every shade of political opinion, will
expect you to make recommendations to
congress upon this subject. Such recom
mendations as yor can make can do much
to relieve your party from odium and
your country from danger.
Tho present is the time to act. Pairi
otic statesmen of both parties should not
allow this occasion to pass without pro
viding a remedy, in our statute law, for
tho succession of tho chief executivo
officers of our government in every situ
ation of affairs that can bo reasonably
anticipated.
The death of tho vice president has
another aspect: its cfi'ect upon political
parties, by changing combinations already
planned, to obtain political power. Demo
crats are divided upon tho questions of
civil service, the coinage of silver dollars,
and the tariff. You have- boldly taken
position in favor of civil service reform
and for the suspension of the
coinage of the silver dollar. The
late vico president represented opposite
views, and was fast becoming the central
tiguie around which the opponents of
your administration within tho Demo
cratic party were forming, to nominate a
ticket in 'S8. It is believed that, if power
ful enough, it would have named Hen
dricks and Hill as the nominees of tho
Democracy for president and vico presi
dent. Thus again we are reminded that
man proposes but God disposes.
In the future your iumlth and long
life will bo drank with equal zest 'by the
bourbon and tho reformor of your party,
while every patriotic Republican will
pra v that you may have tho grace and the
patriotism to serve your country well
during your constitutional' term of office.
"When that shall bo finished they will
work consistent ly and earnestly for a Re
publican successor.
Many things might bo said concerning
the intrigues within your party to defeat
your nomination in 1888 that the pro
prieties of this occasion would not per
mit; and were it not for theso combina
tions ex-Gov. Tilden,of Now York, would
not have voiced tho sentiments of Gov.
Hili, tho Tammany society, and other
confederates, that" they regarded the
death of the late vice president as one to
be deplored as a ''public calamity." But
at tho grave the war oE factions must
cease, een if their hopes are destroyed by
the death of their leader.
It is said and believed by many that
yon are a man of destiny. The happen
ing of this great event may confirm them
in their belief, and whatever obstacles
obstruct your pathway, however dark
and portentious it. may appear, the charm
of that destiny will remove all opposition.
Whether man of destiny, or a plain,
matter-of-fact citizen, you occupy the
highest position on earth, wherever yo'u
may le, in the executivo mansion, ex
ercising power for tho good or ill of
nearly (A,uuu,uuu of souls, or journeying
- to and from tho obseuniea of the man
who would have filled your position had
the circumstances been reversed, still vou
will rcoefce from all the- people the honor
ana tno Homage due the president of the
republic

WHIRLPOOL IrTWASHlNGTON.
Western Kansas Voild Correspondence.
Washington, Dec. 12, 1885.
Congress has met, organized, and read
tho president's message since my last
communication. The senate has gone to
work with Senator Sherman in the vice
president's chair, and the house of repre
sentatives, with Mr. Carlisle as presiding
officer, is discussing a revision of its
rules.
The opening scenes of the forty-ninth
congress'wore similar to those of the
forty-eighth, forty-seventh, forty-sixth,
and many others of tho past There was
the same rush to the capitol. There
were crowded galleries and corridors, and
tho same turbulent scenes on tho floor of
the houfcp, to which members old and new
contributed. In the senate the old-time
dignity, decorum and quietude prevailed,
and tho old familiar faces were at their
desks.
The opening proceedings of this con
gress were necessarily unexciting, but the
secsion promises to be a lively one for
business. Tho senate, at least, will be a
working body, and it is likely to supply
material for much excitement before its
close.
The president's messago has, of course,
been the chief subject of comment for
several days. Opinions expressed oven
by Democratic senators and members
have varied so much that it would be
difficult to tell the drift of their criticism.
An almost unanimous comment and re
gret was that tho paper was too long.
Some of the more conservative Republican
senators have said that the message was
more valuable for tho information it con
tained in it than for any opinions ex
pressed or policy advocated. Senator
Logan said he would express his views on
the floor of the senate. The aggressive
senator from Kansas, Mr. Ingalls, char
acterized the document as "an incoherent
mass of dogmatic platitudes, unrelieved
by a single novel idea." The suggestions
about silver, he said, were old and
shallow.
Tho financial chapter in the messago
led to tho most criticism. Tho silver
men of the South and West are in arms
against the views of the president and tho
secretary of the treasury on this question.
The position of the admistration will
have no effect in changing their policy.
It being admitted that the tariff and
silver questions will bo dealt with by
this congress, the wide divergence of
opinion upon them, oven among men of.
the same party, tends to inciease the
interest. Tho advocates of silver
coinage fay the president has sLnply
repeated the old worn out arguments
of Wall street. But Democrats, as a
rule, who differ with Mr. Cleveland are
not inclined to express their antagonism
publicly.
A large list of presidential nominations
made during the recess of the senate
have been sent in for confirmation.
Some of them are likely to bo rovoked.
Somo Republican sonators and congress
men called on tho president yesterday and
told him they could not vote to confirm
certain appointments ho has made, on
account of charges against the nominees.
The senate has many interesting debates
in prospect, matter for which has been
furnished in bills already introduced.
Senator Edmunds is preparing a bill to
destroy Mormonism altogether, by de
priving the church of its temporal power.
Senator Blair has again introduced a
bill conferring the right of suffrage on
women, and it is said there is a desire to
precipitato an animated agitation of that
question. Senator Blair is confident his
educational bill will pass promptly this
session, and Senator Beck is pioparing
for a vigorous reply to the president'
attack on the standard dollar. Senator
Hoar lists again introduced his presiden
tial succession bilL It is thought tho
house'will not be afraid to pass it now,
since its ellect, if adopted, will be to put
Secretary Bayard in the lino of succession
and Senator Sherman out.
Senator Gorman is visited by a larger
number of persons than any other senator.
His callers aro not confined to Maryland,
but hail from every quarter of the Union.
Mr. Gorman is reputed to have great in
fluence with tho administration, and his
callers want his help to get offices.
Tho spoilsmen are undaunted by that
clause in the president's message to the
effect that no offices aro to bo given for
partisan sen-ire. They know that thou
sands of faithful, competent officials have
been put out to make 'place for the
henchmen of Democratic leaders, and that
thousands more will go for tho same
purpose.

THE THREE AMERICAS EXPOSITION.
Special to the Western Kansas World.
New Orleans, December 11, 1SS5.
The exhibit in the States Building,
that represents New Mexico's resources
and peculiarities, is in charge of Commis
sioner W. B. Sloan, a veteran newspaper
man. He has shown excellent taste in
his arrangements, and his terse, clear ex
planations leave no point untouched
In tho center is a narrow pyramid of
wood, surmounted by a life-size figure of
the mining-prospector, in his peculiar
costume, with arms and implements. On
each face of the pyramid are spirited pen
cil drawings, by a miner, accurately rep
resenting Indian types, Indian towns,
(some of them hundreds of years old) fa
mous silver mines, mining camps, and
Lake Valley city, the richest silver mine
r on the continent.
There are ores from San Pedro mine,
in Santa Fo county, that contains enough
wealth to pay tho national debt Ores of
gold, silver and copper, representing 632
mines. Ores of many lead, argentiferous
lead and iron mines. A complete exhibit
of lead and silver, through all stages,
from ores to pig lead and silver-bullion
from tho great Billing mine in Socorro
county. Sand-carbonates of silver, in 26
varieties, hitherto neglected, now success
fully treated.
Various kinds of marble. Samples of
r-.-i.il lfiiiTtitinn: ;ml vroj-imtlimfif('
1 ' '
plenty of it; shipped in all directions.
Plumbago or graphite, for lead pencils,
a large sample; plenty of it in- mine.
Mica, fire-proof stone, natural potash and
gypsum, in abundance.
Tn a small glass case, numerous sam
ples of the silver ores of one mining dis
trict. These are almost solid silver.
The Bennett mine, in Dona Ana coun
ty, sends a large exhibit of remarkable
mineral curiosities, being crystallized
lead, resembling yellow honey-comb, and
crystals in lime, exactly like the most
delicate frost work. This is a recent dis
covery. Near by are curious specimens
of petrified woods that have become crys
tallized and agatized; and, what is still
more curious, a large specimen of molten
copper injected into wood, by the earth's
fires. No where else has a similar freak
of nature been seen.
Of interest to all dealers in leather:
The indigenous root, called by the In
dians canargra. It grows wild and m abun
dance; and has always been used by them
for tanning purposes. It does its work
in a fow days. The scientific experts at
Washington have lately tested this root,
and think it will ero long replace all tan
barks. These Indian articles: Tho handsome
and costly Navajo blankets; pottery, of
the same forms as the native pottery in
Mexico and Central America; ancient
sfono-hammers found in old mines; tho
adobe, or large mud brick, dried by the
sun; the rough stone matato, on which
grain is ground by nibbing with another
stone; tho coffee pea called ganamso, used
instead of Rio or Java; blue corn-meal,
made from blue corn; the universal fa-
I vorite Mexican red bean; tho big Mexican
whito onion, sweet and non-odorous, and
very nourishing; Indian pickle, used by
joung and old; native tobacco used long
before Cortez' days; and finou, a small,
round, brown nut, tasting like our pea
nut. The Indians uso it habitually, as an
article of food, and gather it in largo
quantities when it ripens, every tlnee
years. An array of battled native wines,
made by tho Indians for homo use from
the Mission grape, which was planted by
the Jesuits somo 250 years or more, and
now grows all over the Territory.
Lady visitors will be delighted with
the samples of gold and silver jewelry
I and other personal ornament", made by
tho Indians of Santa Fe. No prettier
design or more delicate workmanship is
seen anywhere; that is, in this peculiar
st le.
Bald-headed people will certainly want
to see the liquid restorative, made from
the Mexican soap-root. Mr. Sloan says
that it does not d o tho hair, but makes
it grow again.
Tbf, pupils of the Indian industrial
schools send excellent specimens of their
skill in drawing and in making school
furniture.
Theso schools are supported, partly by
the Federal government and partly by
religious denominations.
There is a large framo filled with fino
photographs of local scenery, of the na
tives, and of the old Spanish churches
and towns. Among these pictures is a
portrait of the celebrated mountaineer
and scout, Kit Carson.
Every bird, big and little, in tho Terri
tory, is shown by stuffed specimens, in a
glass care. The mountain fishes are seen
in glass jars. Merino wool is shown, of
excellent staple.
Tho management invites all sons of
New England within traveling distance
to come here and join with them, on the
22d inst., in celebrating '"New England
Day," in grand style.
Base-ball still under way, by two fa
mous professional clubs.
The greatest attraction of all, as far as
amusement goes, is the dazzling pyro
technic spectacle, "The Last Days of
Pompeii." It began on tho 10, and will
bo shown twice a week.
The weather is delightful,
