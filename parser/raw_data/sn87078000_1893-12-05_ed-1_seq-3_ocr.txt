UNEXPECTED MOVE AT HAZLETON.
Koti-IT ii i on Mon nt Tlmt Point Join tho
Army of Striker, hntl tho .Situation
There Is Decidedly AuRlint tli Com
pany. llF.THLKnF.M, l'a., free. 5. A conference
between tho joint arbitrators' committee,
representing the boards of the states of
New York and New .Tersey on the one
band, ami the representatives of the Le
high Valley strikers on the other, was be
gun here yesterday afternoon in the Kngle
hotel. The situation was discussed In all
its phases for three hours, nt the entl of
which time no definite conclusion having
been reached, the conference adjourned.
At I) o'clock the committee Hgain met,
ami remained In session until o'clock
this morning. The members refuse to
talk for publication, but enough was
gathered from the several members of the
conference to get a good idea of what is
contemplated by the joint body. The ar
bitrators have a plan for the settlement
of the strike, which was presented to the
grievance committee. The lattertookthe
ground that It would not entertain any
proposition that would deny to the men
the right which they claim is duo them,
and it was then agreed that a third plan,
in framing which both strikers and arbi
trators would taken hand, should be do
bated, it is believed tlmt this plan will
be submitted to President Wilbur today,
and the ieellng hero is that the affair is
drawing to a focus, and startling develop
ments may at any moment transpire
among the men on strike.
WlLKESHAmtK, Pa., Dec. 5. Chief Ar
tbur, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive)
Engineers, nntl Chief Sargennt, of the
Firemen's Brotherhood, were given an en
thusiastic reception nt the strikers' meet
ing yesterday. Mr. Wilkinwrn called the
meeting to order, and Mr. Arthur was in
troduced. The chief of the engineers said
he was pnrtictilnrly pleased with the con
duct of the men so far. They had certainly
carried themselves in a manner that must
receive popular respect and approval. He
hoped this line of conduct would be main
tained. Mr. Sargeant followed Mr. Arthur in a
two hour address. He said the present
strike could have been avoided hud the
Lehigh Valley railroad officials lived
up to the promises made the men. Mr.
Sargeant said that he would, be willing to
risk his life tlmt no Brotherhood man had
a hand In the White Haven disaster, which
was evidently caused by incompetent em
ployes. Mr, Sargeant urged the men to
continue on their good behavior.
The coal and iron police arrested three
men In the Coxton yards last night for in
terfering with non-union employees while
in the discharge of their duties. The pris
oners were brought to Wilksbarre and
locked up. The police say they are strikers.
HAZKLTOX, Pa., Dec. 5. The strike situ
ation has assumed a new phase which was
not anticipated by tho Lehigh Valley
officials, and as a result tho latter are
greatly embarrassed. This was a move
ment on the part of the telegraph opera
tors, which closed up the most important
offices between Delano and Hitzelton. This
includes the night dispatcher and two
other officers of the company here. It is
expected their ranks will be largely in
creased before night. The situation is now
in the strikers' favor. Most of tho men
who have now quit are non-union men,
and the strikers are confident they will be
ablo to induce new men from filling their
places, .
A Point for Alnswortli.
WASmtfOTON, Dec. 5. The court of ap

murrer of Alnswortli, Dante, Covert and
Basse to the indictment brought against
them. This is the famous Ford's theater
case. The decision practically quashes
the indictment and makes it necessary to
begin the trinl all over again.

MURDEREDBY BURGLAR'S.
A Itetlred linker of Cnrnden Shot Dona
' In II Is Home.
Camden, N. J., Dec. ft. The long lift of
Camden's mystetlous murders was added
to by the killing of William J. Kaier, a re
tired baker, at the hand et burglars.
A strange combination of elroumi tances
surround the case, and the police are in
clined somewhat to doubt the story of the
uiurdeieil man's son, William J. Itsier,
Jr., who was the only eye witness to tha
shooting.
As a result the house ts now in the
hands of the police, who guard it zealously,
refusing to permit any members of the
family to leave or. any nnauthorlsed per
sons to enter.
The son says his father wakened him at
4:80 in the morning, saying there were
burglars in the houMt. Going to the top
of the stairs they saw a tall man ascend
ing. Finding tlmt he was discovered, he
rapidly descended, nnd father and s)n fol
lowed him down stairs. He went wfcpidly
into the yard. , t
The father went to the window and
pushed ftside the curtains to look out. As
ho did so three shots were fired, the third
one striking Mr. Kaier in the breast, and
he sank to the floor, dying almost itt
instantly. There were evidently two of ths mar
auders, and they quickly made their
escnpe, though young Kaier gave an Im
mediate alarm.

Tlielr Misfortune.'.
Toprka, Kan., Dec. 5. One of the most
remarkable circulars ever issued by the
executive of any stats was sent out by
Governor dwelling yesterday. The let
ter Is jidtlressed to all boards of police
commissioners in Kansas, and particu
larly renders nugatory all vagrant laws.
After reciting the hardships of the poor in
olden times, speaking speulally of the
reign of Klizabeth, and in France Just pre
vious to the revolution, the govornor re
views tbe present condition of affairs
among the poorer classes in the country,'
He scores the laws now on the statute
books, which calls tbe man nut of work
and penniless a "confidence man." Pppak
nig ui me vagrancy laws oi ivansas.ne
says: i '
"It separates men into two distiryt
classes, differentiated as those who ore
penniless antl those who are no, and de
clares the former" criminals. Only tho bit
ter are entitled to the liberty guaranteed
by tlie constitution.
"I have noticed in police court reports,
that 'sleeping In a box car' is among the
varieties of this heinous crime of beitfg
poor. Some pollco judges have usurped a
sovereign power not permitted lit the
highest functions of the states or of the
nntion and victims of Industrial condi
tions have been peremptorily 'ordered to
leave town.'
"The right to go freely from place to
place in search of employment or even in
obedionco to a mere whim is part of that
personal liberty guaranteed by the con
stitution of the United Stntes to every
human being on Amerioan soil. Even
voluntary Idleness is not forbidden. If
mon commit offense let them be arrested
and punished, whether i or poor; but
let simple poverty cense to be a crlmo.
"The 'rock pile' und the 'bull pens'
should never have been used In degrading
the friendless antl the poor. Let these
twin relics of the departed auction block
era cease to disgrace tliecltios of Kansas."

conscious only at brief intervals. At these
times he recognized the doctor and his
friends, ami was also ablo to take a little
nourishment. He relapsed into a coma
tose state and died quietly. Mrs. Tyndall
