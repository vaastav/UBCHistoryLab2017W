LOST IN A BIG CITY
Miss Ella Mitchell of Worthington
May Be Dead.
LEFT HER EFFECTS IN A HOSPITAL
pointed in Ambition to Become
m. Trained \urse, She May ':
Have Killed Herself.
Special to The Journal.
Chicago, Dec. 17.—Miss Ella Mitchell,
"5 years old, said to be the daughter oi
wealthy pareuts of Worthington, Minn.,
is missing under peculiar circumstances,
uud last night the police of the Harrison
Btreet station were asked to assist in the
March for her.
Dr. Gertrude Gall Wellington, who is in
charge of the Emergency hospital, report
ed the case to Sergeant Euson, and she is
inclined to {he belief that the young wo
man may have committed suicide because
or' her inability to secure a position in
the institution as nurse.
Dr. Wellington told the police that sev
eral weeks ago -Miss Mitchell came to Chi
cago from Lawton, Mich., and until last
Thursday had remained at the hoßpltal.
The young woman said she had read oi
ili« Emergency hospital in the papers
uud was ambitious to become a trained
nurse. Dr. Wellington allowed Miss Mit
chell to remain until last Wednesday,
but as she had no training for a nurse
'fif-ie \vu- no place for her, and Wednes
day night she was told it would be best
lor her to return home.
That night attaches of the hospital
heard Miss Mitchell weeping in her room,
and the next day she left, saying she was
going to Aurora where she had friends.
She failed to reach Aurora, ihowcrer,
and as many articles, including a watch,
which was a present from her mother,
are still in her room in the hospital, it
la feared something may have befallen
tor. Detectives were detailed on the case
lasi night, but as yet no trace of the
young lonian has been found. Her par
ents have been notified.
In reporting the case to the police. Dr.
Wellington said:
".Miss Mitchell was a beautiful girl, and
her only ambition seemed to become a
trained nurse in order that she might
care for suffering humanity. She said
she had heard of the hospital, and think
ing that perhaps she could be of some
assistance here decided to apply for a
I> isitlon."

WILD RIDE AT NIGHT
MAX CHASED BY PACK OF WOLVES
Beasts Ran. Close to the Sleigh ami
Watted for the Tired Morten
to Give Out.
Special to The Journal.
Elgin, 111., Dec. Driven to despera
tion by hunger and the cold of the last
few days, a pack of fifteen wolves last
night pursued William Reinschmidt of
Pingree Grove, who was driving from
his home to that of a neighbor several
miles distant. The wolves followed him
almost to the door of the house, and when
compelled to retreat by the arrival of men
with shotguns, they retired to a wood .
short distance away and refused to leave
until the early dawn to-day.
Reinschmidt left home in a sleigh drawn
by a span of heavy farm horses. It was
growing dusk as he pulled out of the
barn yard. He had proceeded about hah
a mile when the horses began to show
alarm. On , turning around Reinschmidl
saw swinging along at an easy gallop,
■within fifty yards of the sleigh, a pack of.
■wolves. He yelled at his horses in ter
ror. His voice was a signal for the
wolves, and they Increased their speed,
gaining on him rapidly. As they came
nearer they made their presence even
more effective by the sharp barks from the
leaders.
Reinschmidt applied the whip to his fast
tiring animals, and they fairly leaped
through space.- With a good mile in front
of him, Reinschmidt continued to apply
the whip and yell. The wolves gained un
til they were within fifteen yards of the
sleigh, where they seemed satisfied to re
main until the tiring horses should give
up the fight. As Reinschmidt approached
the home of his neighbor he called* for
help, and to its prompt arrival he prob
ably, owes his life, as the horses were in
a jaded condition and could have con
tinued the chase but a few minutes longer.

DOUBLING RECEIPTS
Genuine Boom in Wheat Shipments
to Seattle.
CARLOADS TO NUMBER 700 IN DEC.
Last Year There Were but 325—
( Enough Carrier* Coining- for
the Bns}nea».
Special to The Journal.
Seattle, Wash., Dec. 17.—Wheat ship
ments to Seattle are booming and records
in the state grain inspector's office show
that receipts of the cereal at this port
for the present month will be fully 100
per cent greater than they were during
the corresponding period of last year.
In December, 1900, the total number of
carloads of wheat received in Seattle
was 326, while 350 carloads have already
been shipped here this month, and even
allowing for the decrease in shipments
that may naturally take place during the
holidays, Deputy State Grain Inspector
Hyman feels assured the total shipments
for December, 1901. will amount to 700
carloads.
Tonnage, that has lately been scarce, is
now becoming more plentiful, and at pres
ent it is reported there are sufficient car
riers coming to the sound to handle the
enormous quantity of wheat produced this
year in the fields of Washington and
Oregon.
CONFIRMATION OF KM
gist !of THE preceding debate I
Fall FlrdHfU Attorney General In
Spite of His Previous Service* j
to Trait*.
)Vabhingtou, Dec. 17. —The senate yes
terday continued the nomination of
Philander C. Knox to De ai , :
The discussion turned upon a motion made
oy Senator Jones of Arkansas, to recom
mit the nomination to the committee on
judiciary, in the meantime publishing
the testimony bearing upon the case.
Speeches in favor of this proposition
were made by Senators Jones and Turner,
and in opposition by Senators Hoar and
Pettus. It was contended by the two sen
ators last named that the only evidence
presented against confirmation had been
tiled by members of the Anti-Trust league
and was very vague and indefinite.
The senators favoring the motion said
that if this were true there could be no
objection on the part of the friends of
the attorney general to placing all the
facts within reach of the public, and the
more time the committee should give to
the subject the more thoroughly the pub
lic would be convinced of the fairness of
its position when ultimately taken. They
dwelt upon the charge made that the
attorney general, previous to entering
upon the duties of that office* had been
attorney for the United StatesWsteel cor
poration and the armor plate manufac
turers.
In reply to these accusations it was
said that it was legitimate for an attor
ney in private life to represent any in
terest in his official capacity, and it was
argued that his position as counselor for
those interests could not be used legiti
mately against him in connection with
his nomination to a position under the
present administration. So long as he
had conducted himself with propriety his
relationship as an attorney should not
be used to his injury as an official. The
vote on the motion to recommit was lost.
The ballot stood 43 to 7. There was no
roll call on the motion to confirm, which
immediately followed.

INDIAN LANDS
Government Wants Eleven Town
ships at Red Lake.
Washington, Dec. 17. —Indian Commis
sioner Jones has recommended to Secre
tary Hitchcock that an investigation be
made on the Red Lake reservation, with a
view to securing a cession to the govern
ment of eleven townships on the western
portion of the reserve. Representative
Eddy recently filed a request that an in
spector be sent to Red Lake as a pre
liminary step to having the eleven town
ships referred to opened for settlement.
The commissioner favors the plan, but
says that no action should be taken by
congress until the Indians have secured
their allotments. He also believes that
it is but fair to the reds that timbered
lands should be included in the allot
ments. Under the law, the department
has no authority to include timbered
tracts in Indian allotments on the Chip
pewa reservations.
Commissioner Jones recommends that
it be so amended as to permit alloting a
part of the timbered sections in the
townships which it is proposed to open
for settlement. It is probable the work
of classifying and appraising the lands
on the ceded portions of the Chippewa
reservations will soon be resumed. This
work was suspended in March, 1899. Com
missioner Jones believes it should be re
sumed and he has made such a recom
aienaation to Secretary Hitchcock.
VENEZUELA_MUST PAY
German Warships Simply to Collect
a Bill.
Washington, Dec. 17.—Germany has
informed the United States of her pur
pose to compel Venezuela to pay .the just
claims of German subjects. The an
nouncement was made by Baron yon Hol
leben, the German ambassador, and was
coupled with a definite and po«itive as-
I surance that Germany has no intention
! of permanently occupying a Venezuelan
port, which it may be necessary for her to
seize. Secretary Hay communicated these
assurances to the president.
There Is reason to believe that in re
turn for the courtesy shown by Germany,
; the United States made an explicit state
: inent of its position. Intervention will oc
! cur when any European power seizes ter
! ritory without just cause and attempts
to hold it permanently. Furthermore, {
Germany is aware that in sending so
many warships to the Carribean sea. the
United States is not actuated by any wish
to keep a close watch of her doings.

HOW TO FIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with your
water and let it stand twenty-four hours;
a sediment or settling indicates an un
healthy condition of the kidneys; if ■it
stains the linen it is evidence of kidney
trouble; too frequent desire to pass it,
or pain in the back is also convincing
proof that the kidneys and bladder are
out of order.
| WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem
edy, fulfills every wish in curing rheu
matism, pain in the back, kidneys,- liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold
water and scalding: pain in passing it, or
bad effects following use of liquor, wine
or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the' ex
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its
wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists in fifty
cent and one-dollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root and a book that tells more
about it, both sent absolutely free by
mail. Address Or. Kilmer & Co., Bing
, hamton, N. Y. When writing mention
that you read this generous offer in th«

unbounded" ENTHUSIASM
ROSEBERVS SPEECH FINALLY OUT
He Ik Willing; to Lead I.literal Party
Attain—-Confidence in
Kitchener. .. ■
JV#«> Xorh Sun Special Service
London, Dec. 17. Ex-Prime Minister
Rosebery, wearied of plowing that lonely
furrow to which in his last public speech
he consigned himself, declared in a great
speech at Chesterfield last evening his
willingness to place his services at the
I disposal of the country, and enunciated
I the policy which, in his opinion, should
be adopted for healing the nation's ills
and uniting the liberal party.
The speech awakened unbounded en
thusiasm. The immense audience which
packed the great carshed of the Lanca
shire & Derbyshire railway, which was
converted for the occasion into a meeting
hall, is estimated to have numbered fully
5,000. but 7 a far greater number were un
able to gain entrance. The weather was
most inauspicious. Snow from the storm
of Dec. 12 lay deep and fresh snow was
falling, but the eager liberals were not
deterred. After the main speech, Lord
Rosebery addressed an overflow meeting,
although his voice was so hoarse that it
was with difficulty he made himself audi
ble.
It may unhesitatingly be said that the
impression created among his hearers was
that Lord Rosebery will again lead the
liberal party and lead it to victory at the
next election. His views, although pro
fessedly unframed on party lines, met the
party aspirations so far as they were'rep
resented at the meeting. His bold cut
ting off of the Irish alliance was greeted
only with less approval than his strong
imperialistic views on the war. During
his speech, which occupied two hours, the
attention of his audience never flagged,
while the enthusiasm grew as he pro
ceeded.
Whilst he was emphatic on the neces
sity of vigorously prosecuting the war and
expressing the fullest confidence in Lord
Kitchener, Lord Rosebery said that he
thought the government should be pre
pared to listen to peace overtures, and he
contended there was nothing degrading or
abasing in recognizing the exiled Boer
government for the purpose of making
peace. The three greatest civilians who
had waged war in the past century, the
speaker said. Pitt, Bismarck and Lincoln,
had not disdained such efforts to secure
peace.

VANDERBILT DEAL
Talk in Wall Street of a '-Union Se-
curitlea" Company.
Special to The Journal.
Xew York, Dec. 17.—Reports were cur
rent Saturday that the "Vanderbilt deal"
will be revived shortly, and it was said
application would be made at Albany for
a charter for the "Union Securities" com
pany, which would take in the minority
stock of the "Junior" Vanderbilt proper
ties. Apparently people still believe
something of the kind is meditated. At
all events, considerable blocks of Nickel
Plate. Lake Erie & Western and other
stocks are being carried speculatively in
anticipation of something of the kind.
Beyond admitting that New York Cen
tral must shortly raise considerable
money for improvements on property, the
Vanderbilt people decline to furnish any
confirmation for the storieß ourrent of
pending developments of any kind.
