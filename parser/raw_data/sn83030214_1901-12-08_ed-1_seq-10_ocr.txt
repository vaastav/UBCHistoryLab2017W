BULGARIA AXD MISS STOKE.
All that can be said concerning Miss Stone,
the kidnapped missionary, is that she is still
alive and fairly well. The Bulgarian brigands
who hold her do not seem to be convinced that
the 5G6.000 ransom which Mr. Dickinson offered
tfcem is all that was raised and all that is avail
able for her relief, and they are holding out for
the whole sum— sloo.ooo— originally demanded
by them. The $G6.000 is. of course, all that has
been raised for the ransom, and there is no
prospect of more being contributed. There is
reason to believe that if they were convinced of
that fact, and realized that it is $»>5,000 or noth
ing for them, the brigands would accept that
turn and release their captive. Certainly they
could have nothing to gain and would have much
to lose in murdering her. while in releasing her
they -vrould gain SOG.OOO, which would be a fine
addition to the treasury of the Macedonian
Committee.
This latter organization seems to be suffering
some internal disturbances. The president of
It, one Mihailowsky. has been publicly denounc
ing his predecessor in office, the notorious Sara
foff. and the latter's friends as blackmailers
and murderers in general, and in particular as
the kidnappers of Miss Stone. Whether he was
:jt earnest in this, or was merely "bluffing" in
order to rehabilitate his faction of the commit
tee in the eyes of the world, is not quite cer
tain: but. however that may be. Mihailowsky
doubtless spoke pretty nearly, if not quite, the
truth. Sarafoff meantime has got into a quarrel
with the Russian Minister at Sophia, to whom
he once looked for aid and comfort. It appears
that the minister recently asked Sarafoff to
come to his house for a private and important
interview. Sarafofl w-.-nt gladly, expecting the
minister would ;uak« him an offer of secret
Russian aid In tho Macedonian campaign. In
stead, however, the minister began to take him
to task severely for menacing the general peace
of Europe with his lawless agitations. Sarafoff
interrupted him with the angry declaration that
if Prince Ferdinand chose to be a vassal and
serf of the Czar he might do so. but his subjects
had no mind to follow his example; while, as
for the Macedonian Committee, it would pursue
fts own course and create an independent
Macedonia, :i. which Russia would have no In
fluence. Since that occasion SarafofTs faction
at the Macedonian Committee has been strongly
anti-Russian. It is hinted that the new presi
dent, Mihailowsky, is as strongly pro-Russian;
hence the animosity between him and Sarafoff.
These things, however, cannot avail to relieve
the Bulgarian Government of responsibility for
the outrage upon Miss Stone. It has long toler
ated. If not encouraged, the Macedonian Com
mittee in its criminal career. Even when it
was shown beyond a doubt that the committee
was levying blackmail and perpetrating mur
ders, the government refused to suppress it or
to bring its criminals to justice until practically
threatened by Rumania with war. With such
s record the Bulgarian Government cannot com
plain if Jt is held to a strict accountability for
this latest iniquity of it= proteges
UNITED STATES LOSSES IN CUBA.
Reference has already been made in these col
umns to the deHine of United States trade with
Cuba. The losses are heavy and continuous.
And they indicate corresponding gaius by our
most formidable and tenacious commercial
rivals. Some people in this country seem mor
tally afraid that Great Britain is going to bom
bard Denver, or that Germany is going to tow
the whole South American continent across the
ocean and tie it up in a Hamburg dock. Others
are rejoicing because we are selling American
engine* in London and American shoes in Ber
lin. Yet both look with indifference upon what
is a good deal more practical and significant, to
wit. that under our present system Great Brit
ain and Germany are taking away from us the
j trade of Cuba— the island which lies almost
within sight of our own shores, over which we
have exercised a quasi-protectorate for the best
part of a century, and for the sake of which
and of our interests in which we have recently
fought a costly foreign war.
Cuban purchases from the United States are
decreasing, while Cuban purchases from Eu
rope, especially from Great Britain and Ger
many, are increasing. That is the salient and
significant feature of the situation. In 1899 we
sold to Cuba $36,773,657 worth of goods, and in
1900 only $32,197,029 worth, a loss of $4^576,638
in one year. This year the loss will probably
be still" greater. In the eight months ending
with February. 1900. our sales to Cuba amounted
to $24.41 r>.»Vi".t. and in the eight months ending
with February. 10m. they amounted to only
$19,050,457, a loss of $5365.192 In two-thirds of
a year, or at the rate of 55.047.75S in a year.
At the same tim<> the British and German sales
to Cuba increased from $11.557>.915 to $13.44fi,
104, a gain of $1^90J89 in eight months, or at
the rate of $2.35r>.2>3 in a year. In 1900 the
sales of those two countries to Cuba were three
times as great as they wore in 1895.
That is the condition, as well as the theory,
which confronts us in Cuba. It would seem to
be high time for the farmers, manufacturers
and merchants of the T'nited States to deter
mine what they are going to do about it. There
seems to be only one thing to do that will be
consistent with both honor and interest. That
is to make such a reciprocal arrangement with
Cuba as will assure to us the major portion of
her trade. Such an arrangement was made in
ISOO. under the direction of Harrison. McKinley
and Blame. with the result that our sales to
Cuba were doubled in two years. Republicans
should not be afraid to restore the provisions
of the McKinley bill. Americans should not
refuse to free and independent Cuba that which
they granted to a colony of Spain.
AX HISTORIC PHRASE.
In his dissenting opinion in the second Dooley
case Mr. Chief Justice Fuller characterizes the
view of the majority of the court In a phrase
full of suggestion concerning the development
of constitutional liiw and the growth of na
tional'powers. He disagrees with the decision
upholding the levy of duties in Porto Rico upon
goods from the United States and ruling that
such duties are not a tax on exports from a
State In the sense of the constitutional prohibi
tion of export duties. The tax does come with
in the prohibition of the constitution as he In
terprets that instrumt-nt. and he says: "The
"plain language of the constitution should not
"be made blank paper by construction, and its
"specific mandate ought to be obeyed."
That phrase, "blank paper by construction."
was Introduced by Jefferson in urging amend
ment of the constitution to legalize what he
thought its violation in the purchase of Lou
isiana. He said: "The limits of the United
States are precisely fixed by the treaty of 1783,"
and urged "the constitution expressly declares
itself to be made for the United States." This
differs little from the doctrine of those who
now hold that the constitution was made for
States, not for distant islands, though they and
everybody else now believe that the govern
ment can acquire territory outside the United
States as created by the constitution, some
thing which Jefferson denied In word and
affirmed for all time in act. On September 7,
1803, Jefferson wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas
protesting that the constitution conferred uo
such power as he had exercised, and saying:
"Our peculiar security is in the possession of a
"written constitution. Let us not make it a
"blank paper by construction." Therefore he
called for an amendment, hut added: "If, bow
"ever, our friends think differently, certainly I
"shall aequieseewith satisfaction, confiding that
"the good sense of our country will correct the
"evil of construction when it shall produce 111
"effects." They found it convenient to think
differently, and he did acquiesce. He con
quered his scruples and never again spoke of
the way he had made a blank paper of the con
stitution.
Half a century latf r, when slavery found it
self threatened by "the evil of construction."
the same phrase came to the front. In his con
curring opinion in the Dred Scott case Mr. Jus
tice Campbell gave expression to the constitu
tional theory of the extreme State rights
school. He found that the government of
strictly limited powers had been changed at
some time in our history into an empire, and
he identified the Louisiana purchase and legis
lation as the transforming step. He said: "The
"wisest statesmen protested against it, and the
"President doubted its policy and the power of
"the government." and then made this sarcastic
reference to Jefferson's letter:
Mr. John Quincy Adams, at a later period,
says of the last act, "that the President found
"Congress mounted to a pitch of passing these
"acts, without inquiring: where they acquired the
"authority, and he conquered his ovin scruples as
"they had done theirs." But this court cannot
undertake for themselves the same conquest.
They acknowledge that our peculiar security is
in the possession of a written constitution, and
they cannot make it blank paper by construc
tion.
The use of the same phrase vow by the Chief
Justice is significant. It indicates that the ob
jection to the governments power of meeting
its new colonial problems with a free hand is
only the latest phase of a doctrine that has
been invoked at every stage of our history to
block national advancement. Those who hold
it and invoke it are not to be treated with
disrespect. They are one of the two schools of
thought into which students of our constitu
tion inevitably divide. They are the resisting
and regulating force. They are as necessary
Ear checking too speedy movement as is the
brake on a railroad oar. Like the brake, they
from time to time clutch the moving wheels
and say that the train snail not go beyond a
given point, but it always moves in the end
even if slowed down. Then they accept the
situation, adajit that the train is i tinning prop
erly far beyond the point where they thought
the track ended, and the constitution was
NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. SUNDAY. DECEMBER 8. 1901.
wrecked, and devote themselves on new oc
casions to the same old resistance which is so
useful for moderation and so unable entirely to
stop progress.
The ill timed Alien and Sedition laws of l*y>>
made waste paper of the constitution in the
opinion of Virginia and Kentucky Republicans,
but laws on exactly the same principle to check
anarchists are now proposed and not a whisper
about unconstitutionally is heard. Hamilton s
national bank and protective tariff made blank
paper- of the constitution, according to his op
ponents, but they themselves afterward adopted
similar measures as perfectly valid. Louisiana
made blank paper of the constitution, as we
have seen, hut the constitution yet gives us
security, and nobody questions the power to
acquire territory. Monroe thought that in
ternal improvements made blank paper of the
constitution, as Jefferson before him thought the
building of a Hchtnonse for the protection of
commerce did: but lighthouses and internal im
provements are now a matter of course. in
Civil War limes it was said that the constitu
tion was made blank paper by construction and
likewise by reconstruction, but the government
still lives, and by common consent the consti
tution Is still the framework of its existence.
It is its organic law. organic in the sense that
it is connected with national vitality, and is
adapted to changing national needs, its pro
vision for which may perhaps not be seen till
the exercise of the function is required. It has
been said for so long that the constitution was
being made blank paper by construction that
if it were true there would be nothing left of it
now; but never was it more respected, never
were rights under it more secure, never were
the authoritative declarations by the Supreme
Court of its meaning more quickly and un
questioningly obeyed. Never did it give form to
the government of a greater or freer people.
HIGH SPEED ELECTRIC TRACTION.
United States Consul General Mason reports
that the interesting experiments in electric trac
tion recently undertaken on the Berlin-Zossen
road have been suspended temporarily. Changes
in the motive apparatus, the desirability of
which had been suggested by the experience of
the last few weeks, will be made before the
tests are resumed. While the final outcome of
the latter is delayed in consequence, the inter
ruption ought not to be interpreted as a failure
in any sense. The enterprise in question was
not the opening of a new road, nor an attempt
to perform any particular feat, although the
feasibility of attaining a speed of I^s miles an
hour or more has been under consideration. The
real object In view is an elaborate investigation
of certain possibilities. And when a German
scientist sets out to investigate he does it thor
oughly and takes his time about it.
Already, however, a few questions have been
partially cleared up. No trouble has been en
countered in takinc the current off from three
overhead wires at once. And the air resistance
has proved less formidable than was feared.
As yet a velocity of more than one hundred
miles an hour has not been reached, but Mr.
Mason declares that when that limit is passed
the damage to both track and motive machinery
is liable to prove excessive and costly. To say
nothing of the danger of derailment. This prin
ciple was long ago established in the operation
of steam railways. Only n few dnys ago Pro
fessor Hutton read a paper before the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, in this city, on
the expense of high speeds, in which half a
dozen elements of cost were specified. And it Is
hard to see why the rule should not hold good
in the case of electric roads as well. It can
hardly be expected that the electrical engineers
in charge of the Berlin-Zossen experiments will
deliberately bring about a wreck merely to as
certain ho-vr fast it is safe to run a train. But
It Is to be hoped that their report will cover the
question of deterioration and repair, in addition
to the other problems involved in the inquiry.
WASTEFUL PUBLIC PRINTING.
Ours is without question the most wasteful
and criminally extravagant government under
the sun, so far as the printing and distribution
of public documents are concerned. Some years
ago Congress created a superintendent for the
"receipt, distribution and sale of public docu
ments," whose task was to keep under some
thing like a check the daily outpourings of the
Government Printing Office. In isi>4 that of
ficial expressed the opinion that it was "douht
"ful if any other instance can he cited in the
"conduct cither of important public or private
"affairs In which methods so ill considered, so
"wasteful, so wanting in system and in general
"so vicious have obtained and continued in force
"year after year with no serious effort at correc
tion."
After seven years' additional service in his po
sition this official reports now that the views ex
pressed by him then have undergone no change.
The lack of system in the business of handling
the public documents and the wasteful and BX
travagant methods of seven years azo aro still
continued, involving a needless expenditure of
many thousands of dollars annually. The num
ber of copies of rearly all documents issued is
far in excess of any legitimate demand for them.
This is evident from the accumulations of docu
ments in the folding rooms of the two houses of
Congress, in the office of the superintendent of
doeumenfs and elsewhere.
It Is thought that an annual saving of over
$100,000 might be effected by a system of con
centration and centralization. Congress, how
ever, seems to think that with a bursting treas
ury at the other end of Pennsylvania-aye. it
would he a waste of time to stop so small a
leak. What has become of the watchdogs of
the Treasury any way? Where are the suc
cessors of Holman and Randall?
GREEK CURSES OX FOREST DESTROYERS.
The Greek Church in Greece itself is beyond
doubt an aggressively patriotic institution.
Attention has just been attracted to it by the
violent outbreaks in Athens against the use of
a certain new translation of the Bible. These
were by IUI »cans due to mere ecclesiastical
bigotry, but to a spirit of resistance to alien
Influences. For the so-called "modern Greek"
of the offensive translation is really a Russian
ized Greek, the use of which has been insid
iously promoted by the Pan-Slav propagandists
in hope of ultimately bringing Greece into the
Russian "sphere of influence." The Greeks
have, of course, nothing in common with the
Slavs in race or blood, but have from time
immemorial regarded them as aliens and bar
barians. But the Russian idea is that, since
Russia has made the Greek Church her official
church, all peoples adhering to that form of
worship should be subjects or vassals of the
White Czar. The Greeks see the fatal flaw in
this logic, and. as we have just seen, jealously
and bitterly resent any approacli toward an
enforcement of it.
In another and very different but no less
practical way the Greek Church is the cham
pion of national interests. That is in its anathe
matizing of all who destroy forests. A few
months ago the Hoy Synod of Greece Issued
an encyclical, which was publicly proclaimed
by the government in .all parts of the kingdom,
in which the utmost wrath of the Church was
visited upon all who indulged in "the unholy
practice, abhorred of God," of setting fire to
forests; and also against all who, knowing
others to have been guilty of such deeds, failed
to denounce and testify against them and to
aid In every possible way in securing their
punishment. All thus guilty through either
commission or omission are to be "eicominunl
"cated from the Church, accursed and shut out
••from forgiveness. The wrath of God." con
tinues the encyclical, "and the curse of the
"Church be upon their heads, and may they
••uevf-r see the success of their labors."
We may smile at that as overwrought. X«
In truth "there is much cause for some such
vehemence of denunciation. For apes Greece
has had before her v.-ry eyes appalling object
lesions in the evil of forest destruction. She
has seen the nearby lands of Asia brought to
utter ruin largely through BOCh processes. She
realizes that of forests as well as of cities or
empires we may truly and literally say
. . . their decay
Has dried up realms to deserts;
and she means herself to avoid that fate. In
deed, it is high time for her to take some strong
and active measures for self-protection. la
recent years her forests ha.ye suffered sorely.
Large districts have been denuded of trees and
rendered almost as sterile as the deserts of
Persia and Arabia. And in a hilly country,
such as most of Greece is. such evil is most
easily done and most hardly undone.
We have no state church here and no excom
munication for forest destroyers. Perhaps this
nation has not been so brought into contact
with the evils of forest destruction as to realize
their seriousness. Nevertheless, those evils exist
here in almost all parts of the land, and are
ominously increasing; and we shall do well to
emulate the Greeks, at least to the extent of
regarding as a foe to the public welfare every
one who wantonly or needlessly destroys even
the smallest tract of woodland.
The era of gruff and grunt, of bluff and black

The appointment of Nelson H. Henry as Ad
jutant General of th« State, to fill the place
made vacant by the death of General Edward
M Hoffman, will give general satisfaction In
National Guard circles. He brings to the office
a fund of knowledge on the subject of State
military matters acquired In the course of
long service in th« National Guard and as an
industrious member of the Committee on Mili
tary Affairs in the State legislature. General
Henry's actual service has been only In the
medical department, where h* has filled every
positlon from assistant Burgeon, with the rank
of captain, to eurgeon on the staff of the Major
General, with the rank of colonel. But he is
also well known throughout the State an a good
soldier, and some of the bost known officers of
the guard urged General Odell to appoint him.
pointing to Major General Leonard Wood as a
living refutation of the argument that a physi
cian cannot be a good soldier.
The courts have been called upon to prevent
the award of Tammany contracts for asphalt
pavements which appear to be open to serious
objection. It is not unfair to suggest that dis
credited officeholders, whose opportunities for
mischief may be blocked completely within a
fpw weeks, ought to be watched sharply while
their hold on power Is at the last gasp. Before
the d»ath rattle comes they may do harm.
Senator Lodge, who is regarded as one of
President Roosevelt's i lowest political and per
.onal friends, has Introduced in the Senate a
bill authorizing the construction of an executive
building for the use of the President and his
official staff. Mr. Lodge's plan Is to reconvert
the White House into a residence, and to trans
fer all the office business now conducted there
to the new building to be erected three hundred
or four hundred yards away on the open ground
south of the Treasury. Such a plan seems pref
erable to ar.y remodelling of the White Hous",
which still fu!:Us with admirable dignity the
purposes for which it was built one hundred
years ago- It is to be hoped that this Congress
will take some definite steps toward restoring
to its natural and proper uses the beautiful
Executive Mansion, now overcrowded by de
mands for working room and the incursion of
the visitors whose wants could be better at
tended to within the walls of an office than
within those of a Presidential residence.

A novel form of charity has been Inaugurated in
Budapest— namely, the distribution of bread and
milk among children up to six years of age. The
distribution, which is to be continued daily, takes
place, morning and evening, at a shop In a by
street. The milk is first boiled in four large boilers,
whence It runs Into a cooling apparatus. Fifty
children are allowed to enter at a time, either with
their mothers or alone, while the others wait for
their turn In a neighboring Warmestube, another
charitable Institution. These large, well warmed
rooms are found in many places in Austria-Hun
gary. The children are told to bring their own
mugs for the milk: but there are drinking vessels
for those who have none, which, after use, are
cleaned and disinfected. Both the bread and milk
must be consumed on the premises, and very sickly
children receive a second portion. On the opening
day a number of medical men. as well as men and
women from the upper middle classes,- assisted in
the distribution.

Stamp collectors will be interested in learning
that one of the German States will disappear as
a stamp Issuing country In a few months. At pres
ent the kingdoms of Wiirtemberg and Bavaria
are the only States of the German Confederation
which have their own special postage stamps. It
has long been tho desire of the German Emperor
to have uniformity in this respect. Quite recently
the "Reichsanzeiger" announced that after April 1,
1902. WUrtemberg will cease to Issue its stamps, and
will use those now in use in Germany generally.
Bavaria has been approached on the subject, but
the Bavarians will not listen to the proposal to give
up their own stamps.
A friend of ours relates us the following (true)
story, which, in turn, we cannot help quoting, for
the benefit of home readers, on account of the de

had bought a young cock fresh from the market,
and this young tyrant of the poultry yard, forget

dawn," started the same night crowing hetween
10 and 11 o'clock. Our friend, quite surprised, asked
the cook the next morning in somewhat the follow

makee crow night time. Cock never makee crow
