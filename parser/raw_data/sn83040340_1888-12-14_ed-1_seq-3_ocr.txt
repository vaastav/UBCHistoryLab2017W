Vassktgtox, Dec 5. Congress opened
at 1:S? to-day for its econd session. The
President's message was presented to both
faomses and read.
President Ctevebrd opens his nrssage to
Oonrres by calling attention to tfce fact thmt
frtA. the explratle ot the presert session ot
Cecgress the first century of our constitutional
bfctory Is ccmpWwd. The time admonishes ut
to soberly Inquire whether in tfcefast we hare
.wars closely kept in the course-of safety, ad
whether Ire btfre before us a way plain and
lear which teals to happiness 'and perpetuity.
When the experiment of our Government was
undertaken Sfce chart adopted for our guidance
was the Constitution. Departure from the
lines there hid down is failwe. It is only by a
strict adfremce to the direction they indicate.
and by restraint within te limitatiors they
fix, that w; can furnish proof to the world of
the fitness-of the Americarrpeople for telf-soT-
ernment.
The ecraal and exact "Justice of whis we
boast as the underlyire -principle of eur Insti
lutions-rtaould not be confined to the relations
of oureltizens to each other. The GoTemment
itself Is under bond e the American people
that it the exercise of its functions and powers
It wia-aeal with the body of our citizens in a
manner scrupulously ionest and fair and abso
luteiy'just. We view with pride and satisfac
tion the bright picture of our country's growth
and prosperity, whilccnly a closer scrutiny de
velops a somber shading. Upon more careful
Inspection we find the wealth and luxury of our
cities mingled with noverty and wretchedness.
A crowded and consMmtly increasing urban pop-
utstion snegests the impoverishment of rural
sections and discontent with agricultural pur
suits. TVc discover tfcst'the fortunes realized by our
tnanufacturerers ore no longer solely the re
ward of sturdy industry and enlighted foresight.
tmt theT result Irom the discrimi ating favor of
the Government-trad are largely Built upon un-
-due exaction from the masses of our people.
The gulf between employers and employed is
constantly widening and classes are rapidly
forming, one comprising the very rich and pow
erful, while tn 'lire -other are found the toiling
-poor.
Corporations -which should be the carefully re-
strained creatures-df tne law and the servants
cf the people are fast becoming the people's
masters. Still 'congratulating ourselves upon
the wealth -anil prosperity of our country, aed
complacently reontemplaung every incident of
shange inseparaKe from the conditions.
"t is our uuty as patriotic citi
zens to inquire at the- present stage of our pro
gress how the bond ot the Government made
with the peopJe ihas' been kept and performed.
Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from our
citizens to the necessities of its economical d
tninistration, the Got ernment persists in -exacting
from 'the (people millions which, unap
plied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury.
This flagrant injustice and this breach of felth
and obligation add to extortion the danger at'
tending the diversion of the currency of the
lountryfroci the legitimate channels of fcusl-
uess.
Under the sme laws by which the results
are produced the Government permits many
millions more to be added to the cost of Using
of our people and to.be taken from onrtcon-
turners which unreasonably swell the profits
of a small but powerful minority. The people
must be-taiMTfor the support of the GoTern
ment under the operation of tariff laws. But
to the extent that the mass of our citizens
are inordinately burdened beyond any
sscful public purpose, and for the ibene
fit of a favored few, the Government
undera pretext of an exercise of its taxing pow
er, eaters gratuitously into partnership with
thee favorites to their advantage and to the
Injury of a vast majority of our people. This
is not equality before the law. The existing
situation is injurious to the health ot onrtmtire
body politic .It stifles in those for whose ben-
efit it is, permitted, all patriotic love of country
and substitutes in its place selfish greet and
igrasp.ng avarice.
Yben to the selfishness of the beneficiaries
of unjust discrimination under our law there
shall fce added the discontent of tbeaa who
suffer from such discrimination, we will realize
the fact that the beneficent purpose of our
iGcvernment, cepenoent upon the patriotism
ted contentment of our people, is eniancercd.
iCcinmunisni is a hateful thing, and a menace
'to peace and organized government. But the
sotnmunism of combined wealth and capital.
'tire outgrowth of overweaning cupidibv and
felfishaess which insidiously undermines the
justice and integrity of free institutions, is not
ess dangerous than the communism f op
pressed poverty and toil, which, exasperated
'by injustice ana discontent attacks with. vrtld
jiisorder tbe-citadel of rule.
He mocl,s the people who proposes thit the
Government -shall protect tha nch and that
they in turn will care for the laboring poor
Any intermediary bet een the people ant1 their
overcmenw or the least delegation or to care
tsd protection the Government owes to the
Humblest citizen in the land, makes the -boast
of free institutions a glittering delusion and the
pretend ed boon of American citizenship
aaameless imposition.
.A, just and ensihle revision otour tanClaws
should be rnae for the relief of those of our
countrjmeu who suffer under present condi
tions. Such a revision should receive the-sup-
,port of all who love that justice and equality
due to American citizenship; ot all who realize
that in this justice and equality our Govern-
TBent finds its strength and power U

-of all who believe that the corrtent
cient, competence and comfort of tnany

progress, and of all who dedre to see the pro
ducts of American vkUl and ingenuity in

.CxisUnevils and injustices should be honestly
-recognized, boldly met and effectively reete-

rarteSnterests which apoiso persistently heard

fiemtion of nch matters eebordinate and
ptitrxjne action npoc subjects d great public
tsfortance but icrolriug so spazial, pnvtle or
padsan interest shoall arrest aaeatios asd
leaiio reformation.
A lev of the sumcrotu msstrations of this
taaitunn may be stated:
The crowded condition ot the calendar of the
Supreme Court, and tne delay to setters and de
nial cfjudce resulting therefrom, hare been
strongly crrd upon the attention of the Con
cress. wita a plan for the relief of the situation
approved by those well able to judge of its sier
jls. TVhi'e this subject remains without effect
ive consideration, many laws have been passed
fZJ!l2Z larlg-VIirgaf ttrraa oi initact ,
ecurto at plaeas to suit the oenrenlenee ot local
ities or to lay the foundation nf an application
for the erection of a new-public building.
Repeated recommendations have been sub
mitted for the amendment and ohange ot the
laws relating to our public lands, so that their
spoliation and diversion to other uses than as
homes for hottest settlers might be prevented.
While a measure to meet this conceded neces
sity of reform remains awaiting the action of
the Congress many claims to the public lands
and applications for their donation in favor ot
States and individuals have been allowed.
A plan in aid of Indian management, recom
mended by those weit informed as containing
Taluabie features in furtherance of tin solution
ot the Indian problem, has thus far Tailed of
legislative sanction, while grants of doubtful
expediency to railroad companies, permitting
Uaem to pass through Indian reservaafons, have
greatly multiplied.
The oropriety and necessity of the erection
nf one or more prisons for the confinement of
United States convicts and a post-office build
ing in the National capital are not disputed,
but these needs yet remain unanswered, while
scores ot public buildings hare been erected
where their necessity for public purpose is not
apparent.
A revisieet of our pension laws should be
made, which would rest upon just principles
and provide for every worthy applicant. But
while our general pension laws remain con
fused aad Imperfect, hundreds cf our priiate
pension laws are annually passed which are
the sources ot unjust discrimination and pop
ular demoralization.
Apprepnation bills for the support ot the
Government are defaced by items and provis
ions to meet private ends and it Is freely as
serted y responsible and experienced parties
that a bill appropriating money for public in
ternal Improvement would fail to meet with
favor, unless it contained items more for local
and yrivate advantage than for public benefit.
These statements can be much emphasized
by an ascertainment of the proportion of
Federal legislation, which either bears upon
its face its private character or which, upon
examination, develops such a motive power.
And yet the people wait and expect from their
chosen representatives such patriotic action as
will advance the welfare of the entire country
and this expectation can only be answered by the
performance of public duty with unselfish pur
pose. Our mission amocg the nations ot the earth
and our success in accomp'lhing the work God
has given the American people to do, require
of those intrusted with the making and execu
tion ot our laws, perfect devotion, above all
other things, to the public good. This devotion
will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of
constitutional limitations of Federal power and
to persistently check the increasing tendency
to extend the scope ot Federal legislation Into
the domain of State and local jurisdiction upon
the plea of subserving the public welfare.
The preservation of the partitions between
proper subjects of Federal and local care and
regulation, is ot such importance under the
Constitution, which is the law of our very ex
istence that no consideration of expedience or
sentiment should tempt us to enter upon
doubtful ground. "We have undertaken to dis
cover and proclaim the richest blessings ot a
free Government with the Constitution as
our guide. Let us follow the way it points out.
ItwCl not mislead. And surely no one who
has taken upon himself the solemn obligation
to support and preserve the Constitution can
find justification or solace for disloyalty in the
excuse that he wandered and disobeyed in
search of a better way to reach the public wel
fare than the Constitution offers.
What has been said Is deemed not inappro
priate at a time when, from a century's height
we view the way alreidy trod by the American
people and attempt to discover their future
paths. The seventh President of the United
States the soldier and statesman and at all
times the firm and brave friend of the people
in vindication ol his course as the protector ot
the popular rights and championship of true
American citizenship, declared:
'"The ambition which leads me on is-an anxious
desire anfl -a fixed determination to restore to
the people, unimpaired, the sacred trust they
have confided to my charge, to heal the wounds
of the Constitution and to prevent its violation.
To persuade my countrymen, so far as
I m-iy. that it is not in a splendid
rovemment supported by powerful monop
olies and aristocratic establishments that
they will find happiness or their liberties pro
tected,"but in a plain sjstem, void of pomp
protecting all and granting favors to none, dis
pensing its blessings like the dew of Heaven,
unseen .and unfelt save in the freshness and
beautr they contribute to produce. It Is such
a Government the genius of our people requires
such an one only under which our States may
remain for ages to come united, prosperous and
free."
TOREICV AFFAIRS.
TheTresident announces that the close of the
year finds the United States in the enjoyment
ot domestic tranquility and at peace with all the
Nations. Foreign relations have been strength
ened and improved by performance ot individual
good offices and by new and renewed treaties of
amity, commerce and reciprocity and extradi
tion ot criminals.
The Fisheries question has not been
satisfactorily adjusted, but since March
3d, IsST, no cases have been re
ported to the Department ot State
wherein complaint has been made of unlawful
or unfriendly treatment by Canadian authori
ties in which reparation was not promptly and
satisfactorily obtained by the United btates
Consul-General at Sail ax. I continue in the
opinion that the treaty of February last, which
failed to receive the approval of the Senate,
did supply "a satisfactory, practicable and final
adjustment, on a basis honorable and just to
both parties, to the difficult and vexed ques
tion to which it related," and having subse
quently and unavaillngly recommended other
legislation to Congress which I hoped would
suffice to meet the urgency created
by the rejection -of the treity, I now
again invoke the earnest and immediate
attention ot the Congress to the con
dition ef this 'important question as it now
stands before them and the country, and for the
settlement ot which! am deeply solicitous.
TThe West inc.dent is treated as fol'ows:
Sear the close of the month ot October last
occurrences of a-deeply regrettable nature were
brought to my knowledge, which made it my
pilnf ul but imperative dnty to- obtain, with as
little delay as possible, a new personal chan
nel ot diplomatic intercourse in this country
with the Government of Great Britain.
The correspondence in relation to this incident
will in due oourc be laid before you and will
disclose the unpardonable -conduct of the offi
cial referred to in his interference by advice
and counsel with the suffrages of American cit-
dzess in the veryxrisis cf the Presidential elec
tion then near at hand and also in his subse
quent action, superadding impugnment ot the
.Executive and Senate of the -United States in
connection with important questions now pend
ing in controversy between ithe two Govern
ments. The offense thus committed iiS most
grave, involving disastrous possibilities to
the good relations of .the United States and
-Great Britain, constituting .gross breach ot
diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the
purely domestic affairs and essential sove
reignly of the Gorernment to which the .envoy
was accredited Having first fulfilled the just
demands of international comity, by affording
Joll-opportuniry for her ilajesty's Government
to act in relief of the situation. I considered
prolongation of the subject to be unwarranted
aad therefore declined to further recognize the
diplomatic character of the person whoe.con
tinnanae in such function would destroy that
which is essential to the good understanding of
the two Governments, and was inconsistent
with tne welfare and self-respect of the Govern
ment of the United States. The usual inter
change ff communication has since, continued
through her Majesty's legation in this city.

relations with Central and South American
States and the claims ot certain ot our citizens
against Chili, Ecuador and Venezuela.
As authorized by the Congress, preliminary
steps have been taken for the assemblage at
this capital duriug the coming year of the rep
resentatives ot South and Central American
States, together with those of Mexico, Hayti
and San Domingo, to discuss sundry Important
monetary and commercial topics. Excepting 1c
those cases where from reasons of contiguity of
territory and the existence of a border line in
capable ot being guarded, reciprocal commer
cial treaties may be found expedient, it
is believed that commercial policies Inducing
freer mutual exchange of products can be most
advantageously arranged by independent but
co-eperative legislation. In the mode last men
tioned he control of our taxation for revenue
will be always retained In our hands, unre
stricted by conventional agreements with other
Governments.
utsncRATiox.
With the rapid increase of immigration to our
shores and the facilities ot modern travel
abuses of the generous privileees offered by
our naturalizati n laws call for their careful
revision. The easy and unguarded manner in
which certificates ot American citizenship
can now be obtained has induced a class, un
fortunately large, to avail themselves of the
opportunity to become absolved from alleg
iance to their native land and yet by a foreign
residence to escape any just duty and contribu
tion of service to the country of their proposed
adoption. Thus while evading the duties of
citizenship to the United States they
may make prompt rlaim for its national
protection and demand its intervention In their
behalf. International complications of a seri
ous nature arise and the correspondence ot the
State Department discloses the great number
and complexity of the questions which have
been raised.
Our law regulating the issue of passports
should be carefully revised and the institution
of a central bureau of registration at the
capital Is again strongly recommended. By
this means full particulars ot each case of
naturalization In the United States would be
secured and properly indexed and recorded,
and thus many cases ot spurious citizenship
would be detected and unjust responsibilities
would be avoided.
The maritime powers have also been Invited
to confer in Washington in April next regard
ing uniform rules for the security of lite and
property at sea.
TIIE COSSETAIl SKtmOB.
The reorganization of the consular service is
a matter ot serious importance to our National
interests. The number of existing principal
consular offices is believed to be greater than is
at all necessary for the conduct of the public
business. I repeat the recommendations here
tofore made by me that the appropriation for
the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular
service should be recast, that the so-called no
tarial or unofficial fees which our representa
tives abroad are now enabled to treat as per
sonal perquisites should be forbidden: that a
system of consular inspection should be insti
tuted, and that a limited number ot 'secretaries
of legatlon-at large should be authorized.
THE WASnUTGTOS CESTESNIAL.
Preparations for the centennial celebration
on April 30, IS?1, ot the inauguration of George
Washington as President of the United States
at the city of New York have been made by a
voluntary organization of the citizens ot that
locality. -nd believing that an opportunity
ihould be afforded for the expression of the in
terest felt throughout the country tn this event,
I respectfully recommend fitting and co-operative
action by Congress on behalf of the people
of the United States.
THE TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
shows that the total ordinary revenues of the
Government for the fiscal year ended June 3D,
1S. amounted to 4.CT.33G.074 T8, of which
fc!19,091,17t 63 was received from customs duties
and lli4.i9G,sn to from internal taxes. The
totaljrcceipts from all sources exceeded thoe
for the fiscal year ended June 3), ISST, by
?7,82!,T9T.1U. The ordinary expenditures of the
fiscal year ending JuneS), 1SN. were iJ59,633,
SKK67, leaving a surplus of 119,G2,11S.09. The
decrease in these expenditures as com
pared with the fiscal year ended June
31.1S-T, was ?5,SrS,C2L31, notwithstanding the
payment of more than t5,00,0"0 for pensions
in excess of what was paid for that purpose
in the latter mentioned year. .The revenues of
the Government Tor the year ended June 30,
1&8S. ascertained for the quarter ended Sep
tember M, icSS, and estimated for the re
mainder of the time, amount to fiT7,(XM, and
the actual and estimated ordinary expendi
tures for the same years are 1271,00 .W),
leaving an estimated surplus of tl(M,.O,0i.
The estimated receipts for the year ending
June 20. 1K, are !377,00fl.fo0, and the estimated
ordinary expenditures for the same time are
f275,7C7,4').31, showing a surplus of Sl01,-..-
51 1.60. The foregoing statements of surplus do
not take into account the sum necessary to be
expended to meet the requirements of the sink
ing fund act, amounting to more than I 7,OJ0,0iX)
annually. The cost of collecting the customs rev
enues forthe last fiscal year was s.4J per cent.;
for the year 18S3 it was 3.77 per cent.
The excess of internal revenue taxes collected
during the last flsc-il year over those collected
forthe year ended June 30, 1!S7, was KMsO,
174.23. and the cost of collecting this revenue
decreased from 3.4 per cent. In lSs7to less than
3.4 per cent, for the last year.
Bonds of the Government not yet due have
been purchased up to and including the 30th
day of November, 1SSS, amounting to i9l,704,4l),
the premium paid thereon amounting to
117,508.613.08. The premium, added to the
principal of these bonds, represents an
investment yielding about S per cent, interest
for the time they still had to run, and the sav
ing to the Government represented by the dif
ference between the amount of interest at 2
per cent, ujton the sum paid for principal and
premium and what would have paid for interest
at the rate specified in the bonds if they had
run to their -maturity is about CS'.lES.OiXX At
first sight fhK would seexa to be a profitable and
sensible transaction on the part of the Govern
ment, but as suggested by the Secretary ot the
Treasury the surplus tans expended for the
pur hasaot bonds was money drawn from the
people In exeeesot any actual need of the Gov
ernment and was so expended rather than allow
it to remain in the treasury.
At the close of the Caeal year ended June 8,
1Ss7, there had been cvined under the compul
sory Silver Coinage act rJ66.858.290 in sdver dol

the further coixaie ot silver, and In such recom
mendation I earnestly concur.

The Secretary of War reports that the army,
at the date ot the lateonsolidated returns, con
sisted of 2,183 officers and 2l9 enlisted men.
The actual expenditures of the War Depart
ment for the fical year ended June Srt, less,
amounted to &l,ii.1 17.07. of which sum ifl.'SS,
5I4.C3 was expended for public works, including
nver and harbor improvements.
I earnestly req-oest that the reeomipenda
tions contained in the Secretary's report, all
of which are. in my opinion, calculated to In
crease the usefulse-s and discipline of thearmy
may receive the consideration f the Congress,
among these the proposal that there should be
provided a plan tor the examination of officers
to test their fitness for promotion is of the ut
most importance. This reform has been before
recommended in the reports of the Secretary,
and its expediency is so fully demonstrated by
the argument he presents in its favor that us
adoption shonld no longer be neglected.
The dtath of General Shendin in August
last was a National adction. The nrmythex
lost the grandest of its chiefs. The country
lost a brave and experienced soldier, -t wise and

man. Those who in any manner came within
the range of his personal association will sever

ordinary or current expenditures ot the de
partment for the three years ended Jane 30,

such expenditures forthe three years ended
June 30, 1SS4. The various steps which have
been taken to improve the business methods
of the Depattment are reviewed bv the Secre
tary. The purchasing of supplies has been con
solidated and placed under a responsible bu
reau head. This has resulted in the curtail
ment ot open purchases, which in the years 1984
and 1885 amounted to over so per cent, of all tne
purchases of the department, to less than 11 per
cent.; so that at the present time about j per
cent, of the total departmental purchases are
Biade by contract and after competition. As
the exDenditures on this account exceed on an
average of C000,000 annually, it is evident that
an important improvement en the system has
been Inaugurated and substantial economies
introduced.

The report of the Postmaster-General shows
a marked Increase of business in every branch
of the postal service. The numberot post-offices
on July 1, 1SSS, was 57,376, an Increase of 6,124 In
three years and of 1S10 for tne last fiscal year.
Free delivery offices have increased from 169 in

Central and South American State. The in
crease for correspondence with foreign
countries during the past three years is gratify
ing and Is especially notable and exceptional
with the Central and South American States
and Mexico. As the greater part ot mall
matter exchanged with these countries is com
mercial in its character this Increase is evi
dence of the increased business relations with
them.
The practical operation of the parcel post
convention so far as negotiated has served to
fulfil the most favorable prediction as to their
benefits. In January last a general postal con
vention was negotiated with the Dominion of
Canada, which went into operation March 1 and
which practically makes one postal territory of
the United States and Canada. Under It mer
chandise parcels may now be transmitted
through the malls at fourth class rates ot post
age. It is not possible here to touch even the lead
ing heads of the great postal establishment to
illustrate the enormous and rapid growth of the
business and the needs for legislative readjust
ment ot much ot Its machinery that it has out
grown. For these and valuable rcccommenda-
tlons of the Postmaster General attention is
invited to hL report. A department whose
revenues have Increased from tl9,772,0iO In 1870
to t52.7-0.000 In lbSS, despite reduction ot post
age which have enormously reduced rates of
revenue while dally Increasing its business de
mands the careful consideration of the Congress
as to all matters suggested by those familiar
with Its operations and which are calculated
to Increase Its efficiency and usefulness.
Of the total number of postmasters 54,874 are
of the fourth class. Thes, of course, receive
no allowances whatever for expenses In the ser
vice, and their compensation is fixed by per
centages on receipU at their respective offices,
This rate ot compensation may hae been and
probably was. at one time, just, but the stand
ard has remained unchanged through the sev
eral reductions in the rates ot postage. Such
reductions have necessarily cutvdown the com
pensation of these officials while It undoubtedly
increased the business performed by them.
Simple justice requires a mention ot this sub
ject to the end that fourth-class postmasters
may receive at least an equivalent to that
which the law itself fixing the rate intended for
them.
Another class of postal employes whose con
dlt on seems to demand legislation is that of
clerks in post-ofllces. and I call especial atten
tion to the repeated recommendations of the
Postmaster-General for their classification.
Proper legislation of this character for the
relief of carriers in the free delivery service has
been frequent. Provision is made for their
promotion, for substitutes for them on vaca
tion; for substitutes for holidays, and limiting
their hours of labor. Seven million dollars has
been appropriated for the current year to pro
vide for them, though the total number of of
fices where they are employed Is but 3M for the
past fiscal year, 1th an estimated increase for
the current ear ot but forty, while the total
appropriation for all clerks In offices through
out the United States Is rs,9Gfl,0i.
DEPARTMENT OF JCSTICE.
The transactions ot the Department of Jus
tice forthe fiscal ear ended June 3), lisSS. are
contained in the report of the Attorney Gen
eral, as well as a number of valuable recom
mendations, the most of which are repetitions
of those previously made and ought to receive
consideration. It is stated in this report that
though judgments in civil suits amounting to
tJSS.02l.tS were recovered in favor of the Gov
ernment during the year, only the sum of (132,
ftil was collected thereon; and that though
fines, penalties and forfeitures were Imposed
amounting to KX, KM 41. only Jt 9,648.42 of that
sum was paid on account thereof.
These tacts may furnish an illustration ot the
sentiment which extensively prevails that a
debt due the Government should cause no in
coveniencc to the citizen.
It also appears from this report that tbaugh
prior to March, INS. there had been but six
convictions in the Territories of Utah and
Idaho under the laws ot 18G2 and ISSi, punish
ing polygamy and unlawful cohabitation as
crimes, there have been since that date nearly
six hundred convictions nnder the laws and
statutes of lstfr. and the opinion is expressed
that undersuch a firm and vigilant execution of
these laws and the advance ot ideas opposed to
the forbidden practices, polygamy within the
united States Is virtually at an end.
Suits instituted by the Government under
the previsions of the act ot March 3, 1&87, for
the termination of the corporations known as
the perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and
the Church of Jesus Christ ot Latter Day Saints
have resulted, in a degree, favorable to the
Government, declaring the charters of these
corporations forfeited and escheating their
property. Such property, amounting in value
to more than 1800,00 is in the hands ot a re
ceiver, pending further proceedings, an appeal
having been taken to the Supreme Court of the
United States.
PUBLIC LAND XATTECS.
In the report of the Secretary of the Interior.
which will be laid before you, the condition of
the various branches of our domestic affairs
connected with that Department and its opera
tions daring the past year are fully exhibited.
But a brief reference to some of the subjects
discussed in this able and Interesting report
enn be here made, but I recommend the entire
report to the attention of Congress and trust
that the sensible and valuable recommenda
tions it contains will secure careful considera
tion. I -can not too strenuously insist on the Im
portance of proper measures to insure a right
disposition ol our public lands, not only as a
matter of present justice but m forecast of the
consequences to future generations. The
broad, nch acres of our agricultural plains have
been long preserved by nature to become her
untrammelled gift to a people civilized and free
upon which should rest, in well distributed
ownership, the numerous homes of enlightened,
equal and fraternal citizens. We came to Na
tional possession with the warning example in
our eyes ot the entail of inequities of landed
proprietorship which other countries have per
mitted and still suffer.
We have co excuse for the violation of prin
ciples, cogently taught by reason and example,
nor for the allowance of pretexts which have
sometimes exposed our land to colossal greed.
iiws wnioi open a door to fraudulent acquisi
tion or an administration which permits the
capacious searcre by a favored few of the ex
panded areas that many should enjoy are ac
cessory to offenses against our National welfare
acd humanity and can not be too severely con
demned or pumshed.
Iz is gratifying so know that something has
been done at last to redress the injuries to our
peoale and cheek the perilous tendency of the
reckless waste of national domain. That over
eightr million acres have been wrested from
illegal usurpation, improvident grants and
fraudulent entries and claims must afford a
profouxd gratification to right feeling citizens
as it is a recompense for the labors and
struggles of the recovery.
Our dear experience ought sufficiently to urge
the speedy enactment of measures ot lega
tion which wfll confine the future "position
of oar remaining agnenltp-- mnds to the uses
ofactoal hk-arr ad genuine homes. Nor
.wuia our vast tracks of so-ealled desert land
be yielded up to the monopoly of corporations
or grasping individuals as appears to be much
the tendency under the existing statutes. The
lards require but the supply of water to become
let tile aad productive. It U a yrpblea of great
assent haw mote wUely (Br the public goe
that factor shall be furnished. leas not but
think it perilous to suffer either those lands or
the sources of their Irrigation to fall Into the
hands of monopolies which, by such means,
may exercise lordship over areas dependent ot?
their treatment for productiveness.
Already steps have been takes to secure ac
curate and scientific information of the condi
tion which is the principal basis of Intell'gent
act-on. Until this shall be gathered, the course
of wisdom appears clearly to be In a suspension
of further disposal, which only promises to
create rights antagonistic to the common in
terest. No harm can follow this cautionary
conduct. The land will remain, and the public
good presents no demand tor hasty disposses
sion ot National ownership and control.
I commend also the recommendations that
appropriate measures be taken to complete the
adjustment ot the various grants made to the
States for Internal Improvements and of swamp
and overflowed lands as well as to adjudicate
and finally determine the validity and extent
of the numerous private land claims. All these
are elements of great injustice and peril to the
settlers upon the localities affected, and now
that their existence can not be avoided no duty
is more pressing than to fix as soon as possible
their bounds and terminate the threats ol
trouble which arise from uncertainty.
THE WDtMfS.
The condition of our Indian population con
tlnues to Improve and the proofs multiply that
the transforming change so much to be desired,
which shall substitute for barbarism enlighten,
ment and civilizing education, is in favorable
progress. Allotments In severalty hate been
made on some reservations, until all those en
titled to land thereon have had their shares
assigned, and the work is still continued. As
soon as possible community In laad shonld
cease, by opening up such as remain unallotted
to settlement. Contact with the ways
ot industrious and successful farmers
will perhaps add a healthy emulation
which will both instruct and stimulate.
But no agency for the amelioration ot this
people appears to be so promising as tbe ex
tension urged by the Secretary of such com
plete facilities of education as shall at the
the earliest possible day embrace all teach
able Indian youths ot both sexes and retain
them with a kindly and beneficent bold untd
their characters are formed and their faculties
trained
The Apache Indians at Mount Vernon bar
racks. Ala., are being well cared for and their
children carefully educated, and there Is no
good reason why they should be returned to the
reservation. They should be kept la restraint.
FENSIOKS.
The number ot pensions added to tbe roll
during the fiscal year ended June 30, ISSf, is
60,252, and lnciease ot pension was granted in
45,716 cases. The names of 15,730 pensioners
were dropped from the rolls during the year for
various causes, and at the close of the year the
number of pensioners was 452.537. Of these there
were SX survivors of the war of 1S1-J,
10,787 widows of those who served in
that war; 16.OS0 soldiers of the Mexican
war and 5,101 widows ot said soldiers.
One hundred and two different rates of pen
sions are paid to these beneficiaries, ranging
from R to (416.66 per month. The amount
paid for pensions during the fiscal year was
178,773,851.91, being an Increase over tiie pre
ceding year of t308,2S0.22. The expeamr at
tending the maintenance and operational the
Pension Bureau during that period was 13,362.
534.67, making the entire expenditures of the
bureau 182.038,35.17. being 21H percent, of the
gross income and nearly 31 per cent, of the to
tal expenditures of the Government during the
year.
I am thoroughly convinced that our general
pension laws should be revised and adjusted to
meet, as far as possible In the light of our ex.
perience. all meritorious cases. The fact that
one hundred and two different rates ot pensions
are paid can not in my opinion be made con
slstent with justice to the pensioners or to the
Government, aad the numerous private pen
sion bills tint are passed, predicated upon the
Imperfection of general laws, while they in
crease in many cases existing Inequality
and injustice, lend additional force to
the recommendation for a revision of
tbe general laws on this subject.
The laxity ot Ideas prevailing among a large
number of our people regarding pensions is be
coming every day more marked. The principles
upon n hich they should be granted are tn dan
ger of being altogether ignored, and already
pensions are often claimed because the appli
cants are as much entitled as other successful
applicants, rather than upon any dlsabil
lty reasonably attributable to military
service. If the establishment oi
various precedents be continued. It
the granting of pensions be not divorced from
partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant con
sidcrations, and the honorable name of veteran
unfairly becomes by these means but another
term for one who constantly clamors for the ail
of the Government there Is danger that lnj iry
will be done to the fame and patrotism of many
whom our citizens delight to honor, and that
a prejudice will be aroused unjust to meritori
ous applicants for pensions,

The Department of Agriculture has continued
with a good measure of success in its efforts tc
develop the processes, enlarge the result and
augment the profits of American husbandry.
It has collected and distributed practical
information. Introduced and tested new plants,
checked the spread of contagious diseases
of farm animals, resisted the advance of
noxious insects and destructive fungus
growths and sought to secure to agricultural
labor the highest reward of effort and the full
est Immunity from loss. Its records of the year
show that the season of IsSj has been one ot
medium production. A generous supply ot the
demands ot consumption has been assured and
a surplus for exportation, moderate In certain
products and bountiful in others, will prove a
benefaction alike to buyer and grower.
Four years ago it was found that the great
cattle Industry of the country was endangered
and those engaged in it were alarmed at the
rapid extention ot the European lung plague of
pleuro-pneumonla. Serious outbreaks existed
In Illinois, Missouri aad Kentucky, and in
Tennessee animals affected were held in
quarantine. Five counties in New York and
from one to four counties each in the States ot
New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Delaware and
Maryland were almost equally affected. With
tbe great danger upon us and with the con
tagion already tn the channels of commerce;
with the enormous direct and Indirect losses
already being caused by it, and when only
prompt and energetic action could be success
ful, there were in none of these States any laws
authorizing this department to eradicate the
malady or giving the State officials power to co
operate for this purpose. Tbe deport
ment even lacked both the requisite ap
propriation and authority. By securing
State co-operation In connection with
authority from Congress, the work of eradica
tion has been pressed successfully and this
dreaded disease has been extirpated from the
Western States, with the exception of a few re
stricted areas which are still under supervision.
The danger has thus been removed and trade
and commerce have been freed from the
vexatious State restr ctlons which w ere deemed
necessary for a time.
An exhaustive study has also within the same
period been undertaken of the subject of food
adulteration and the best analytical method
for determining it. A part of the results ot
this work has already bees published oy
the department, which, with the matter in
course ot preparation, will make the most
complete treatise on that subject that eier
has been puolished is any country. The de
partment seeks a progressive development. It
would combine the discoveries of science with
the economies and amelioration of rural prac
tice. A supervision of the endowed experi
mental station system recently provided
for, is a proper function of the depart
ment and is new in operation.
During the past four years the process of dif
fusion as applied to the manufacture of sugat
from sorghum and sugar cane has been intro
duccd into this country and fully perfected by
the experiments carried on by the department.
This process is now universally considered te
be themost economical one, and it is througt
it that the sorghum sugar industry has beet
established upon a fins basis and the road U
its future success opened. The adoption et till
diffusion process is also extending in Louislan.

A gentleman who was out hunting
the other night stumbled over the dead
body of a cow in the Little River
swamp. The cow had crumpled horns,
from one of which was dangling a huge
rattlesnake. The indications were
that the cow had seen the snako coiled
and in the act of springing upon her,
and had accordingly hooked the rep
tile, the horn penetrating the snake's
body so that the rattler was unable to
free himself. The cow's horn killed
the rattler, but the rattler's fangs
killed the cow. And yet tradition says
a rattlesnake's bite doesn't harm a
