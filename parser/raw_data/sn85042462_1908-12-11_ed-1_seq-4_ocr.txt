JAPAN
IN THE word of welcome of the
Japanese to the California cham
ber of commerce delegates there is
the following passage: "We have the
honor to welcome you at the gate of
the city of Yokohama. It was fifty
years ago that Commodore Perry made
his memorable visit to Japan, with a
beneficent mission from your country.
As one of its results this harbor was
constructed and opened and has finally
reached its present prosperity; and it is
with mingled feelings of joy and grati
tude that we welcome you at this very
place today."
The words quoted express the senti
ments of enlightened, scholarly, well
read Japan with regard to the United
States. Illiterate hoodlums from time
to time may howl disapprobation of
the foreigner, but Illiterate hoodlums
are not Japan; and for that matter
illiterate hoodlums are not the United
States, and are not the United King
dom, although from time to time the
actions of a company of Hooligans are
treated by newspapers of one country
or another as if they represented the
real sentiment of that country. It is
absurd nonsense of this kind which
provokes international misunderstand-
ings.
When your neighbor's bad boy ties a
firecracker to your cat's tail you do
not break your neighbor's windows or
seize his chickens. Yet some elements
in our civilization yell "War! war!
war!" on occasion or provocation which
is relatively as slight, when under
the regulation of civil law one human
life Is at stake a great fuss is made.
The governor is besieged by peti
tions. Mass meetings are held at
•which resolutions are passed recom
mending the condemned to mercy. The
same people who besiege the governor
with petitions for the life of a murderer
and applaud resolutions of Interces
sion for the murderer at the mass
meetings will stand up and bawl "Hur
rah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" to express
their savagely patriotic joy when they
see a regiment of soldiers marching
down the street on the way to what is
called "the front," that Is to say, on
the way to what may possibly be the
scene of their execution.
The intellectual and intelligent citi
zens of Japan have no desire for war
with the United States or with any
body else. : The wars which they have
fought in modern times have had the
effect of curbing the cupidity of two
giants, either of which might have
swallowed Dai overgrown Chi
na and huge Russia. It is clear each
war was in effect a war in self-defense,
or a practical Illustration of the im
mortal advice: "If you think the other
fellow is going to dew you, dew him
fust." ;<.
With the unveiling of the memorial
statue of Senator White will come a
revival of the memories of the indebt
edness of Los Angeles to that great
citizen and faithful public servant,
whose example is of itself a public
monument which should never be lost
sight of. ■
ACCIDENTS
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT In his
message took up the matter of
the crippling and death of many
workers while engaged at their occu
pations. He said: •',"
"Our present system, or rather no
system, works dreadful wrong, and is
of benefit to only one class of people—
the lawyers. "When a workman is In
jured what he needs is not an expen
sive ana doubtful lawsuit, but the cer
tainty of relief through Immediate ad
ministrative action. The number of
accidents which result ln the death or
crippling of wage workers, in the
Union at large, Is simply appalling; ln
a very few years it runs up a. total
far in excess of the aggregate of the
dead and wounded In any modern war.
No academic theory about 'freedom
of contract' or 'constitutional liberty
to contract' should be permitted to In
terfere with this and similar move
ments. Progress in civilization has
everywhere meant a limitation and
regulation of contract. I call your es
pecial attention to the bulletin of the
bureau of labor which gives a state
ment of the methods of treating the
unemployed in European countries, as
this is a subject which In Germany,
for instance, Is treated in connection
with making provision for worn-out
and crippled workmen."
The Herald has frequently called at
tention to the matter which Is the
subject of comment by the president,
pointing out, like him, that the num
ber of accidents resulting in the death
or crippling of wage workers Is "sim
ply appalling," and that "the total for
a few years Is far in excess of the
aggregate of dead and wounded in any
modern war." We have already char
acterized this as the most significant
and startling fact in modern civiliza
tion and have no doubt that in our
editorial position with regard' to social
and industrial conditions in the United
States we will soon have "plenty of
good company," for Mr. Roosevelt will'
certainly discuss the matter editorial
ly, and this may embolden to take it
up manfully many Republican or other
editors who have hesitated over giving
publicity to this subject, because they
have been afraid "they might offend
somebody."
The present condition is an offense
both against God and man,, and the
sooner it is amended the better will It
be for the nation.
TOURISTS
REPORTS indicate the tourist sea
son will be a record breaker.
From all parts of the United
States and Canada, and from various
quarters of the old world, people are
flocking or preparing to flock to South
ern California, and as the commercial
and social metropolis of this part of,
the country is Los Angeles, It is nat
ural that hotels should be announcing
their accommodations are taxed to the
utmost.
No city in the world has hotel, board
ing and rooming house accommodations
equal to those of Los Angeles. Citi
zens who have traveled everywhere can
bear witness to the fact that not in
any other city can accommodations at
reasonable rates be had which can be
compared with those at the service of
tourists in Los Angeles. Meals served
at restaurants . are always good, and
there is abundance on the table. Trav
elers frequently comment on the lavish
portions and big helpings of Los An
geles restaurants. One of the reasons
for the superiority of Los Angeles hotel
and restaurant tables over all others is
in the fact that this city is the center
of a great market district. Fresh vege
tables and fruits are always to be had,
and there is not a month in which gar
den, field and orchard do not contribute
to the fare. Here there is some signifi
cance in the. remark, "Delicacies of the
season," for there is no season without
its delicacies. Good health is enjoyed
by the overwhelming majority of our
citizens, and the food as well as th 3
climate helps to produce good health.
Good digestion attends good appetite,
and the eastern dyspeptic develops ?
digestive power equal to that of i»
trained athlete. It is no wonder tour
ists come to California. Climate and
scenery are much advertised attrac
tions, but there are thousands of
others.
HERALD SANTA
MANY of our good friends are work
ing with a will for the success of
The Herald Christmas festivity,
and since our plans were first an
nounced they have been increased
greatly In scope. At 3-3 South Hill
street a headquarters bureau has been
established, which will greatly facili
tate the work of preparation. This
store has been placed at the disposal
of The Herald by the Wrlght-Callender
company, and donations should be sent
to the store. All kinds of articles are
welcome. We are glad to receive toys
and books, equally glad to receive cloth
ing and supplies of all kinds.
Subscriptions in money can be used
to advantage. Not a penny will be
wasted that the public may depend.
There Is abundant opportunity in Los
Angeles for the kind-hearted and the
benevolent to make Christmas cheery
and merry for the youngsters.
Although this Is a prosperous city
there are many boys and girls whose
Christmas would be a bleak one if It
were not for the Intervention of such
stewards of Santa Claus as The Herald
Is trying to be. Experience shows many
people are not only willing but eager to
give either in money or In goods to a
Christmas festival which will help pro
mote "good will among men," but if
they have no channel through which
they can make their Christmas gifts
they must go without the pleasure of
giving, and others must go without the
pleasure of receiving. .
To all givers The Herald gives an
opportunity to give. And The Herald
will guarantee that all recipients of
gifts will be highly appreciative. Santa
Claus will be thanked right heartily by
all the poor children who will be re
membered by him ut The Herald's
Christmas festivity.

_.mxrNG^THE-LAST*DOS£
And He's Never Paid That Fine
EXPATRIATION
JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER is evi
dently preparing to enjoy his re
cently found title of due de Ro
quefeuillet, as he has bought building
sites in the most fashionable quarter
of London, England, and will build a
marble palace which will make his
neighbors of the effete nobility of Eng
land almost expire with envy. In this
marble palace the American oil duke
will spend at least half of his time and
a great part of his money. According
to the Exploiters' Code (a new edition
of which, revised and edited by Carne
gie, Rockefeller and others, will soon
be issued) America is useful only for
money making purposes, but, as a
gilded pup expressed It some time ago,
has no real aristocracy composed of
persons of cultivated leisure. The
American colony in London will be
strengthened greatly when the Due
DOll de Roquefeuillet expatriates him
self, and we may look for great ad
vances in Ithe price of oil, because the
English expenditures of the billionaire
will be much larger than his American.
England will get the lion's share of his
disbursements. America will getleft.
Joking apart, isn't It somewhat trying
to our national temper to have these
oil persons and beef persons and steel
persons use American resources and
American labor and an American "pro
tective tariff" for the purpose of paying
their way abroad and establishing
themselves as parasites of alien courts
and merely tolerated additions to for
eign society?
We say, "It doesn't matter," and "It
Isn't any of our business," but it does
matter, and it is fast becoming a "busi
ness" so serious that it demands no
less attention than the conservation of
national natural resources, to which it
is an allied question. Conserve natural
resources by all means, but do not let
our wise men neglect to devise means
of conserving the labor-product of the
United States, and of using It for the
benefit of the people of this country,
instead of the cockney tradesmen of
London.
Isn't it remarkable that persons like
Whitelaw Reid, who has the well de
served reputation of being niggardly at
home, and of paying his employes on
a 30-cents-an-hour scale, should be free
handed, lavish and generous when
abroad? Do these men call themselves
"good American citizens?" ,;;
REFORM VINDICATED
BY THE conviction of Abe Ruef
San Francisco has condemned
and repudiated everything with
which the name of Ruef was connected.
There Is in this conviction an an
nouncement to the world that the twi
light of evil is about to be succeeded
by the dawn of a new day. The north
ern city has "supp'd full with horrors,"
and has had a surfeit of crime and
crookedness. It has found the way of
the transgressor is hard, and that to
protect transgressors or shelter trans
gression from punishment will bring
any city into the "hard way." There
are many ancient cities whose histories
bear startling resemblance to the his
tory of San Francisco, and It MUST be
true that no law is more potent or more
far reaching in Its influence and opera
tion than the law of cause and effect
the rule that "similar causes produce
similar effects in all countries, in all
ages of the world's history, subject
only to the variation caused by envi
ronment and circumstance."
The conviction of Ruef will make the
workers for a new San Francisco take
heart of grace. The moral leaven is
not dead. It will -yield results. The
regeneration of San Francisco will be

and Mr. Heney, the dauntless officer of
the law who has been preserved, prov
identially, from the fate earnestly de
sired for him by those who would fain
have had his life, are entitled not only
to the congratulations, but the hearty
thanks of all loyal Americans in every
part of the Union.
TEACHERS' EXCURSION
A GLANCE at the record shows somu
readers are working appreciatively
for the success of candidates for
the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific exposition
excursion, but as yet it is "anybody's
contest." Many of our readers have
children at school and all are interested
in the schools and school teachers of
Los Angeles, where we have the best
schools in the United States, and of
course the best teachers, for we could
not have the best schools unless we had
the best teachers.
Twelve of the teachers will visit the
Alaska-Yukon-Paclflc exposition at
Seattle as the guests of Los Angeles
Herald, but The Herald cannot under
take the task of selecting the lucky
dozen. AYe must leave that to their
friends. If you, reader, will vote for
the teacher you would like to see
among the twelve' we shall be most
happy to enroll that teacher with the
elect, and If she receives enough votes
she will surely visit the exposition. We
are willing to do our part. Now your
part is simpler and easier than ours.
All you are required to do is to vote
and to ask your friends to vote.
The voting conditions are easily filled.
They will be found on another page,
where there Is also a list of those
whose names have been already entered
in the contest, and many particulars
and details with regard to the trip.
On that page, for Instance, you will
find that the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific ex
position will cost the huge sum of $10,
--000,000. It will be the greatest enter
prise of its nature the west coast has
ever attempted, and will undoubtedly
be successful, for the west coast was
never known to fall In any undertak
ing. Its educational advantages should
appeal to teachers, while too much can
not be said in praise of this oppor
tunity for restful recreation. The cli
mate of Seattle is excellent, and the
hotels are first rate. No such oppor
tunity as this exposition excursion has
ever been offered whereby the teachers,
who are among the hardest and most
responsible workers in the nation, can,
without- cost to themselves, derive
pleasure and benefit, rest and recrea
tion.
Chang, the Korean charged with the
murder of Durham W. Stevens in
March, must be deeply impressed by
the fierce swiftness with which relent
less justice pursues crime in the land
of the free. It almost looks as if a
man who wished to kill time comfort
ably for a few years at the state's ex
pense had only to ."remove" a fellow
human being in order to gratify his
desire to loaf and feed.

Punishment for Poverty
There Is something repugnant to a

the Idea of placing upon a man the
stigma of having been jailed when his
only offense was poverty, which pos

California Returns Show Big
Democratic Gains in State
THE compilation of the vote of Cali
fornia at the recent election has
not yot been completed by the
statistic at Sacramento, but the to
tals for the presidential and congres
sional tickets have been computed. The
figures are interesting, especially when
compared with those of four years ago.
To Republicans they are satisfactory
in the full sense of the term. To
Democrats they convey a grain of com
fort. The latter can also be said In
regard to the cold water brethren, says
the San Diego Union. For the Socialist
party the totals are not encouraging.
To go Into the details:
For, President. Taft polled 214,398
votes, against 205,226 for Roosevelt in
1904. Bryan Polled 127.492, against 89,

figures -show a gain of 9,172 for the

Democratic ticket. To facilitate fur

Attorney General Explains

SAYS CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
WORKS ARE NOT EXPENSIVE
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 9.—[Editor
Herald]: Mrs. Robertson Is experienc
ing difficulty in justifying Brother
Brown's assertion- that "the trail of tho
dollar Is all over Christian Science."
Claiming that it only referred to the
publications, she leaves out the quan
titative adjective "all" in quoting him.
Let us see if her claim is Justified.
She says Christian Science publications
cost more than others.
The Journal (monthly) costs 20 cents,
the Sentinel (weekly) costs 5 cents, the
Monitor (daily) 2 cents. The first two |
are free from advertisements and all ■
tiro very ably edited, clean, instructive
and elevating, and their Immense circu
lation would seem to indicate their
worth is appreciated.
Mrs. Eddy's books cost no more than
others, but do more for the reader. My
own experience illustrates: Reading
"Science and Health" healed me of
chronic disease from which I suffered
for eight years and for freedom from
which I had spent hundreds, but failed
to find any permanent relief. Nobody
has to buy this book, for the local
Scientists have put twenty-odd vol
umes in our public library, besides two
comfortable reading rooms are support
ed and maintained by them where all
Christian Science publications may be
freely read or borrowed.
Christian Scientists gladly contribute
toward the cost of spreading the gos
pel of Christ— makes man free
without being urged to do so; and if
they do not complain, why should
others? . _ .._.
Mrs. Eddy herself has set the noblest
example, for ln proportion to her
wealth she has probably given more
phllanthropically than any other per
son; in addition to this, her whole time
and effort are vnselflshly devoted to
promoting the welfare of others^

but gratefully, in acknowledgement of
many benefits received. R. N.
COMMENTS ON ROOSEVELT'S
BID FOR AUTOCRATIC POWER
LOS ANGELES, Dec. [Editor
Herald]; I wonder how many of your
readers have taken the trouble to wade
through the president's last message,
and to take notes. I have, and it seems
to me the most extraordinary docu
ment that a chief executive ever
penned. , . _ ..
For Instance, after girding at Indi
vidualism as an extinct creed, and en
tirely ignoring the fact that it Is tho
chief function of that creed to demand
equal opportunities for all—which Is by
no means an extinct idea—the president
calmly states that he favors the exer
cise of "power, not by Judicial but by
executive action, to prevent or put a
stop to every form of favoritism or
wrong doing." He then adds, with
even greater coolness, that "the dan
ger to American democracy lies not in
the least in the concentration of admin
istrative power in responsible and ac
countable hands." -'■"'.-■'
Who, I ask, has ever been able to
hold Roosevelt to account?
I venture the assertion that not
Kaiser AVilhelm himself over made
such a bid for the consolidation of im
perial control in one pair of hands, and
I do not believe it has been possible
for an English statesman since the time
of Charles I even to dream of advanc
ing such a claim.
Most assuredly it seems to me that
if the Democratic party has not the
vigor to fight against such deadly auto
cratic pretensions as those which are
now put forth by the leader of the'
Republican machine, It is high time
that another party should Jump into
the field. DEMOCRAT.
SONS INHERIT TENDENCIES
FROM THEIR MOTHERS ALSO
LOS ANGELES, Dec. [Editor
Herald]: "Vera Fidelia" ln her article
in the public -Letter Box of The
Herald, dated December 2, speaks of
the male sex Inheriting strong tenden
cies to vice because of their fore
fathers' unrestrained passions. It
seems to me that the thought is not
correct, -because the law of heredity
does not work that way, a' large num
ber of young men Inheriting more of
their mothers' tendencies then of their
fathers.
I believe that tile foolish "law" of
society, which demands Ignorance on
the part of women concerning social
Impurity is more to blame for intem
perance In social life than anything
else, for how can a woman who Is
Ignorant of these things give Intelligent
advice to her son on social purity? *:.'.

last month was 386,597 as against 331,545.
in 1904, ■ gain of 64,992.
Four years ago the Prohibitionists
polled 7380 votes. This year they cast
11.770, a gain of 4390.
In 1904 the Socialists cast 29,535 votes.
In the election last month their vote for
Debs dropped to 28,659, a loss of 876.
That Is to say, while the three other
parties had a share in the Increased
vote of 54,992 for the entire state, the
Socialist party alone had no part of
that Increased vote, and did not even
retain the strength that it had showed
four years ago.
The Independence League vote, of
course, can only be compared with that
alleged party's showing of two years
ago. Then Langdon, for governor, re
ceived 45,008. Last month Hisgen for

of 40,730 votes—figures that suggest

cheat justice of her plain due; partly
because our law makers afford almost
infinite facilities for review of judicial
action to the criminal, although being
stingy in allowing them to the govern
ment; but mainly because our laws
show little sense of the value to society
of a speedy administration of justice."
These reasons come very close home
to us in California and enforce the
conclusion of the attorney general that
"American criminal law today in large
measure falls of Its purpose." If re
form is to come it must proceed from
tho lawyers themselves, because the
layman is not competent to devise the
remedy and put it in the form of Stat
ute law. British Jurisprudence and
practice were in very much the same
scandalous condition fifty years ago,
but the remedy was found there, as it
may in like manner be supplied here.

Herald]: I am one who opposes collec
tivism and majority rule, and G.
Washington Downs ln The Herald of
December 2 states that this is a prepos
terous position, since society must have
some method of deciding differences.
Mr. Downs fails to distinguish the
difference between majority rule and
majority method. Under majority rule
this fraction of the people assumes to
represent all the people within a given
territory. Sovereignty is exercised al
ways and assumes to represent only
those who voluntarily accept their ae
clsion, uninfluenced by force or fraud,
then no fault can lie found on the.
ground that such a majority is in
vasive.
The majority method is simply tha
majority system stripped of Its power
to rule. The majority and the minor
ity, too, have a right to restrain the
Invasive Individual. Such restraint is
not "rule" In the sense that I use the
word. Any public meeting may resort
to the majority method to determine its
aotion, as the most practical mode that
can be pursued. The minority is not
ruled. It can conform or quit. It has
the liberty to organize another associa
tion to do things as it wants.
Not so under Socialism and majority
rule. Of course you can quit the coun
try or the earth, but no minority will
have the liberty to organize another
system of co-operation, any more than
I now have the liberty to organize a
postal system and operate It in compe
tition with the present one—which I
dislike. Those of us who despise ma
jority rule will not have even the free
dom to practice the majority method in
managing our affairs.

CONSIDERS CRIME NATURAL
CONSEQUENCE OF CAPITALISM
SAN JACINTO, Cal., Dec. B.—[Editor
Herald]: I was not surprised to learn,
through a recent Herald editorial that
crime is on tho increase in the United
States, and more especially In Califor
nia.
I was surprised, however, that you
gave neither the reason nor the rem
edy for It.
AVhen life in jail Is as agreeable to
a man as life out of jail, how can you
prevent crime by convicting a. man?
When a man becomes so weary of the
•struggle that life holds no charms,
what matters it to him how he gets to
the end of the rope? The only way
to prevent crime, is to remove the
cause, and the cause Is capitalism.
Crime Is increasing in the United
States because capitalism has full sway
here. And crime Is decreasing In other
civilized countries because capitalism
in those countries is restrained by
Socialism.
The fact that crime is increasing
most rapidly In California only proves
what we already suspected: that Cali
fornia is the worst corporation-ridden
state in the Union.
Ninety per cent of crime and prosti
tution, which Is only a symptom of a
diseased social condition, can Justly be
charged to capitalism and a competi
tive system.
The church' and Socialism are op
posed to each other because the church
is conducted in the Interest of. the In
stitution, and Socialism in the Interest
of man.
Socialism has no quarrel with any
man's religion. A. FARMER.
ROOSEVELT PUT UNDER FIRE
FOR ADVOCATING SHOOTING
WHITTIER, Dec. 9.— [Editor Her
ald]: What do the gentle philosophers
who discuss the Golden Rule so loving
ly in your Letter Box think of the
following from tho last message of
the president of this allegedly Christian
country—a president who is said to be
himself a devout and regular attend
ant of the church he patronizes?
"While teams representing the United
States won the rifle and revolver cham
pionships of the world against all com
ers ln England this year,; it Is unfor
tunately true that the great body of
our citizens shoot less and less as time
goes on. To meet this we should en
courage rifle practice among school
boys, and indeed among all classes, as
well as in the military services, by ev
ery means in our power. Thus, and not
otherwise, may we be able to assist in
preserving the peace of the world."
One would like to have Tolstoy's
opinion of this modern follower of the
gentle Jesus. But I forgot that our
president, in his "Strenuous Life," has
singled out Tolstoy for special execra
tion.
, That shooting made universal will
preserve the peace of the world! What
nauseating cant! FRIEND.
