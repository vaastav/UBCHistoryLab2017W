A dlspaich from Constantinople
says tr.rt the Ottoman government
fully .vai zes that further resistance
can on'/ prejudice the position of
Turkey still more, whll * its outcome
would be extremely problematical,
and might lead to even more humilia
. tlon for Turkey, if such were possi
ble. The bulk ot public opinion has
rallied to the view taken responsible
; statesmen, and it is generally hoped
that the best possible conditions of
peace will be secured.
It is recognized that practically the
whole of European Turkey is lost,
and the government and other finan
cial interests are taking steps to safe
guard themselves when he final set
tlement comes up for discussion.
Money From
Forest Reserves
Governor Clark has had advices
from the Secretary of Agriculture, in
forming him that the last agricultur
al appropriation bill passed by Con
gress carried a provision that an ad
ditional ten per centum of all moneys
received from national forest reserves
should be expended for the building
and maintenance of roads and trails
within such respective forest re
serves.
The same communication advised
the Governor that under this provis
ion there was at the present time
available for use in the Alaska forest
reserve for the purposes mentioned
the sum of S4.67S.4S.
The Secretary of Commerce and
I.abor sought Gov. Clark's advice as
to the best method of getting the
most benefit out of this money.
The governor replied by advising
that the department take the matter
up with the Alaska Road Commission.
Through the provision of this act
it is believed that the roads running
through mining and agricultural sec
tion of the forest reserves will re
ceive material benefit.

AN ANCIENT NEWSPAPER
A copy of the Yukon Press, pub
lished Jan. 1, 1894. is a curiosity
which has been handed the Skagway
Daily Alaskan for filing among our
archives. It was originally published
at Fort Adams at the point where
Fort Yukon is now established, and
from the amount of religious matter
it contained was doubtless edited by
a missionary. The names of Bettles.
Beaumont. McQuesten and other
noted sourdoughs appear in its ad
vertising columns. The Press is no
longer published.
The district clerk's office force is
busy preparing the civic calendar for
the approaching term of court. There
are 73 civil cases now pending but it
is not likely that all reach the docket
will come to trial.
PRISONERS' SENTENCES
THAT HAVE EXPIRED.
R. O. Baker, formerly a soldier at
Fort Seward, was released today
from the federal jail, having served
a year's sentence for larceny. Baker
had been in the army for seventeen
years and bore an excellent record,
but in an evil moment he appropriated
some whiskey, while intoxicated, and
when arrested pleaded guilty. He has
been an exemplary prisoner and his
case has excited considerable sympa
thy.
Pedro Rodriguez, a Mexican, also
completed a term of twelve months
in the federal jail today. He was con
victed of peddling whiskey to natives.

Are Opposed to
the Ancient Rites
It is said that the younger genera
tion of natives in Auk village will pe
tition Governor Clark to use the in
rtueuce of his office for the purpose
of discouraging the practices of the
elders of the tribe an account of
wl.ich was recently published in The
Daily Empire.
The younger people are very sensi
tive on this subject and manifested
their displeasure in a signed state
ment appearing in The Dally Empire
on the day following the disclosures.
The young people very naturally in
this enlightened age want a cessa
tion of savage rites and customs and
the dancing and revelry accompany
ing such ceremonies.
The governor states that he has
not yet been applied to for assist
ance in the matter, but it is under
stood generally that a petition is be
ing prepared.

TAfTS
MESSAGE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.?President
Taft's message was submitted to Con
gress today. It warns foreign na
tions against discriminating adverse
ly to American trade, and appeals to
Congress to open markets for Ameri
can industries.
FEDERAL WAR
ON RACE SUICIDE
On November 20 ut a given Bigual,
United States marshals in about 70
cities throughout the country, swept
down on the unsuspecting malpracti
tioners of those places bearing war
rants for the arrest of those charged
with criminal practices.
For more than seven mouths 300
inspectors of the post oilice depart
ment have been working on a nation
wide investigation.
Under the direction of the attor
ney-general at Washington, the drag
net was spread over the country
reaching from Pittsburg to Seattle in
an attempt to serve 173 indictments
against physicians, druggists and mid
wives in a national effort to stop the
use of the mails for the furtherance
of criminal medical practice.
In California twenty-seven indict
ments, 18 of which were issued by
the grand jury sitting in San Fran
cisco, were put in the hands of the
federal officers. Oakland is credited
with holding eight of the 27 against
whom indictments had been found.
Other California cities harboring this
class of criminals are Los Angeles
Petaluma, San Jose, Sacramento,
Fresno and Glendale.
Seattle stood directly in the path
of the descending wrath and many
persons charged with the vicious prac
tice were gathered in.
Portland, Oregon, did not escape
and several arrest9 were made there
on the indictments issued.
In Spokane the dtagnet caught
about the same number as those
found in Portland.
In every instance the charge is mis
use of the mails to solicit criminal
medical practice or to dispose of med
icine or instruments connected with
such practice.
The matter of collecting the mass
of evidence necessary to get con
viction rested with the small army of
post office inspectors. In many cases
the inspectors paid personal vinits to
men and women supected of being en
gaged in the nefarious calling. In
other instances the inspectors com
municated with suspected individuals
using decoy letters and under ficti
tious names asked for the methods
employed and the prices charged. Fi
nancial consideration were found to
range from $5 up to $S00. In most
cases those arrested gave bail for
their appearance.
The evening of the day of the
great raid Postmaster-General Hitch
cock issued the following statement:
"The work of the postoillce inspect
ors today is the culmination of the
crusade instituted more than two
years ago against the fraudulent and
unlawful use of the mails. In that
comparatively brief time we have
wiped out of existence concerns that
have mulcted the people of this coun
try out of more than $100,000,000 by
frauds perpetrated through the use of
the mails, and the courts have sent
many of the promoters of the fraudu
lent schemes to the penitentiary,
where they now are serving time.
"The wide publicity given to the
arrests made today will do more to
put an end to this particular sort of
criminality than any number of prac
tically unknown prosecutions of wide
ly separated cases."

ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE
A DOUBTFUL QUANTITY.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.?When the
State legislature meets next month
at Springfield two United States sen
ators are to be elected. Among the
candidates are James Hamilton Lew
is, formerly of Seattle, Wash. Lewis
who is a Democrat, was endorsed at
the Fall primaries of that party. T*he

a large contingent of Progressives.

cards tomorrow afternoon at the Gov-.
ornor'8 residence. Miss Green is

Mrs. Femmer has almost cntlroly
recovered from her recent Illness.
BREEZY "UNCLE JOE" CANNON
ALSO SMILING AND SERENE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.?Breezy
and debonnalr as ever "Uncle Joe"
Cannon, of Illinois, was in his place
in the House yesterday. He takes
iiiu defeat for re-election to Congress
philosophically, and he jokingly said
that though he would be absent in
the next Congress he would not be
forgotten.
Another long time-member of Con
gress who will be missed when taps
are sounded for the present Congress
is John Dalzell, of Pittsburg, who was
Speaker Cannon's stalwart aide on
the committee on rules when the gen
tlemen from Illinois wielded the gav
el in the House. Dalzell failed of
nomination in the primaries of his
district last summer.
A. Mitchell Palmer, of the Twenty
sixth Congressional District, Is likely
to occupy a prominent place in the
councils of the Democratic adminis-1
tration in the House perhaps, or may
be as a member of President Wilson's;
cabinet. Palmer's democracy is of'
the pronounced type; he is a strong
tariff reformer although representing
a Pennsylvania district In Congress.
He was an ardent Wilson supporter
in the Baltimore convention, where
he was one of the most active of the
floor leaders for the New Jersey can
didate.
James R. Mann, the Republican
leader popularly known as "Jim,"
in and out of the House, is as' con
spicuous and pulchrltudinou8 as ever.
Though he was re-elected by his dis
trict last month he will not have the
support from his home state, in the
Slxy-third Congress, that he has had
heretofore. Many of the Republican
contingent in Congress from Illinois
have been replaced by Democrats.
The Democratic representatives in
the next Congress from Northern
states will be substantially increased,
and the so-called influence of South
ern Democrats in the House is likely
to be less marked than in the Sixty
second Congress.
