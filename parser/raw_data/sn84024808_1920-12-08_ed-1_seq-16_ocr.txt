RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE

Washington, Dec. 7.—President Wil
son's annual message to congress fol
lows:
"When I addressed myself to perform
ing the duty laid upon the president by
the constitution to present to you an an
nual report of the state of the Union, I
found my thought dominated by an im
mortal sense of Abraham Lincoln's:
" 'Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith let us dare to
do our duty as we understand it'—a sen
tence immortal because it embodies in a
form of utter simplicity and purity the
essential faith of nation, the faith in
which it was conceived, and the faith in
which it has grown to glory and power.
With that faith and the birth of a na
tion founded upon ft came the hope into
the world that a new order would pre
vail throughout the affairs of mankind,
an order in which reason and right would
take precedence of covetousness and
force, and I believe that I express the
wish and purpose of every thoughtful
American when I say that this sentence
marks for us the plainest manner the
part we should play alike in the arrange
ment of our domestic affairs and in our
exercise of influence upon the affairs of
the world. By this faith, and by this
faith alone, can the world be lifted out of
its present confusion and despair. It
was this faith which prevailed over the
wicked force of Germany. You will re
member that the beginning of the end
of the war came when the German peo
ple found themselves face to face with
the conscious of the world and realized
that right was everywhere arrayed
against the wrong that their government
was attempting to perpetrate. I think,
therefore, that it is true to say that this
wajl^ie faith which won the war. Cer
tainly this is the faith with which our
gailant men went into the field and out
upon the seas to make sure of victory. 1
The Mission of Democracy.
"This is the mission upon which de- j
mocracy came into the world. Democ- j
racy is an assertion of the right of the j
individual to live and to be treated just- j
ly as against any attempt on the part of j
any combination of individuals to make
laws which will over-burden some or |
which will destroy his equality among j
his fellows in the matter of right or !
privilege and I think we all realize that I
the day has come when democracy is be- j
ing put upon its final test. The old |
world is just now suffering from a wan
ton rejection of the principle of democ- |
racy and a substitution of the people of j
autocracy as asserted in the name, but i
without the authority and sanction of
the multitude. This is the time of all j
others when democracy should prove its 1
purity and its spiritual power to prevail. '
It is surely the manifest destiny of the j
United States to kad in the attempt to ;
make this spirit prevail.
Shotild Champion the Weak.
"There are two ways in which the
United States can assist to accomplish
this great object:
First, because offering the example
within lier own borders of the will and
power of democracy to make and en
force laws which are unquestionably
just and which are equal in their ad
ministration laws which secure its full
right to labor and yet at the same time
safeguard the integrity of property and j
particularly in that property which is j
devoted to the development of industry j
and the increase of the necessary wealth j
of the world. Second, by standing for j
right and justice as towards individual i
nations. The law of democracy is for j
the protection of the weak, and the in- j
fluence of every democracy in the world j
should be for the protection of the weak ;
nations, the nation which is struggling j
towards its right and towards its proper !
recognition and privilege in the family of
nations. The United States cannot re
fuse this right of champion without put
ting the stigma of rejection upon the
great and devoted men who brought its
government into existence and establish
ed it in the face of almost universal
opposition and intrigue even in the face ;
of wanton force as, for example against j
the orders in council of Great Britain j
and the arbitrary Napolenie decrees j
which involved us in what we know as |
the war of 1812. T urge you to con- j
sider that the display of au immediate |
disposition on the part of congress to |
remedy any injustices or evils that may I
have shown themselves in our own na- j
tional life will afford the most effectual j
offset to the forces of chaos and tyranny j
which are playing so disastrous a part j
in the fortunes of the free peoples of j
more than one part of the world. The
I'nited States is of necessity the sample
democracy of the. world, and the triumph
.if democracy depends upon its success.
Recommends Budget System.
"Recovery from the disturbing and i
sometimes disastrous effects of the late I
war has been exceedingly slow on the j
other side of the water and has given I
promise, I venture to say, of early com
pletion only in our own fortunate
country; but even with us the recovery
halts and is impeded at times and there
are immediate serviceable acts of legis
lation which it seems to me we ought to
attempt, to assist that recovery and
prove tho indestructible recuperative
force of a great government of the
people. One of these is to prove that
a great democracy can keep house as
successfully and in as business-like a
fashion as any other government. It j
seems to me that the first step towards ;
proving this is to supply ourselves with |
t a systematic method of handling our,!
estimates and expenditures and bring »
jja# them to the point where they will i
I
not be an unnecessary strain upon our
ineomfe or necessitate unreasonable tax
ation, in other words, a workable
budget system, and I respectfully sug
gest that two elements are essential to
such a system; merely, not only that
the proposal of appropriations should be
in the hands of a single body, such as a
single appropriations committee in each
house of the congress, but also that this
body should be brought into such co
operation with the departments of the
government and with the treasury of the
United States as would enable it to act
upon a complete conspectus of the
needs of government and the resources
from which it must draw its income. I
reluctantly vetoed the budget bill passed
by the last congress because of a con
stitutional objection. The house of
representatives subsequently modified
the bill in order to meet this objection.
In the revised form I believe that the
bill, coupled with action already taken
by the congress to revise its rules and
proceedure, furnishes the foundations
for an effective national budget system.
I earnestly hope, therefore, that one of
the first steps taken by the present
session of congress will be to pass the
budget bill.
improvement in Finances
"The nation's finances have shown
marked improvement during the last
vear. The total ordinary receipts of
$6,894,000.000 for the fiscal years 1920
exceeded thoso for 1019 by $1.542,000,
000 while the total net ordinary expen
ditures decreased from $18,514,000,000
to $6,403.000,000. The gross public
debt which reached its highest point
August 31 1919. when it was $26,590.
000.000 had dropped on November 30,
1920 to $24.175.000.000. There also luis
been a marked decrease in holdings of
government war securities by the banking
institutions of the country as well as in
the amount of bills held by the federal
reserve banks secured by government
war obligations. This fortunate result
has relieved the banks and left them
free to finance the needs of agriculture,
industry and commerce. It has been
due in large part to the reduction of
the public debt, especially of the flont
ing debt, but more particularly to the
improved distribution of government se
curities among permanent investors.
The cessation of the government's bor
rowing, except through short term cer
tificates of indebtedness, has been a
matter of great consequence to the r p0 "
pie of the country at large, as well as
to the bolders of liberty bonds and vic
tory notes, and has had an important
bearing on the matter of effective credit
control. The year has been character
ized by the progressive withdrawal of
the treasury from the domestic credit
market and from a position of dominant
influence in that market. The future
course will necessarily depend upon the
extent to which economics are practiced
and upon the burdens placed upon the

treasury, as well as upon industrial de
velopments and the maintenance to lax
receipts at a sufficiency high level.
Must Reduce Expense
The fundamental fact which at pres
ent dominates the government's finan
cial situation is that seven and a half
billions of its war indebtedness mature
within the next two and a half years.
Of this amount, two and a half billions
are floating debt and five billions victory
notes and war savings certificates. The
fiscal program of the government must
be determined with reference to these
maturities. Sound policy demands that
the government expenditures be reduced
to the lowest amount which will permit
the services to operate efficiently and
that government teceipts from taxes and
salvage be maintained sufficiently high
to provide for current requirements, in
cluding interest and sinking fund charges
in the public debt and at the same time
retire the floating debt and part of the
victory loan before maturity. With rigid
economy, vigorous salvage operations and
adequate revenues from taxation, a sur
plus of current receipts over current
expenditures oan be realized and should
be applied to the floating debt. All
branches of the government should co
operate to see that this program is
realized.
Burden of the Railroads
"I cannot over-eenphasize tTie neces
sity of economy in government appro
priations and expenditures and the
avoidance by the congress of practices
which take money from the treasury bv
indefinite or revolving fund appropria
tions. The estimates for the present
year show that over a billion dollars of
expenditures were authorized by the
last congress in addition to the amounts
shown in the usual compiled statements
of appropriations.
"This strikingly illustrates the case of
making direct and specific appropria
tions. The relation between the cur
rent receipts and current expenditures
of the government during the present
fiscal year, as well as during the last
half of the last fiscal year has been
disturbed by 'he extraordinary burdens
thrown upon the treasury by the trans
portation act, in connection with the re
! turn of the railroads to private control.
I Over $600.000,000 has already been paid
I to the railroads under this act—$.'!.»(>,
; 000.000 during the present fiscal year;
j and it is estimated that further i^ay
! ments aggregating approximately $650.
j 000.000 must ;ti 11 be paid to the railroads
j during the current year. It is obvious
! that these large payments have already
; seriously limited the government s pro
s' gress in retiring the floating debt.
Revision of the Tax Laws
! "Closely connected with this, it seems
I to mp. is the necessity for an immediate
! consideration of the revision of our tax
j laws. Simplification of the income and
j profits taxes is deemed an immediate ne
cessity. These taxes performed an in
dispensable purpose during, the war.
The need for their simplification, how
ever, is very great, in order to save the
tax payer inconvenience and expense
and in order to make his liability more
certain and definite.
Care of Disabled Service Men
"It is my privilege to draw to the at
tention of congress for very sympathetic
consideration the problem of providing
adequate facilities for the care and
treatment of former members of the
military and naval forces who are sick
or disabled as the result of their par
ticipation in the war. These heroic
men can never be paid in money for the
service they patriotically rendered the
nation. Their reward will lie rather in
realization of the fact that they vindi
cated the rights of their country and
aided in safeguarding civilization. The
nation's gratitude must be effectively
revealed to them by the most ample
provision for their medical care and
treatment as well as for their voca
tional training and placement. The time
has come when a more complete program
can be formulated and more satisfac
torily administered for their treatment
and training and I earnestly urge that
the congress ,?ive the matter its early
consideration. The secretary of the
treasury and the board for vocational
education will outline in their annual re
ports the necessity for medical care and
j rehabilitation which I am sure will en
I gage your earnest, study and command
j your most generous support.
Industry and Agriculture.
"Permit me to emphasize once more
the need for action upon certain matters
upon which I dwelt at some length in
my message to the second session of the
Sixty-sixth congress: The necessity, for
example, of encouraging the manufacture
of dyestuffs and related chemicals; the
importance of doing everything possible
to promote agricultural production along
economic lines, to improve agricultural
marketing and to make rural life more
attractive and healthful; the need for a
law regulating cold storage to limit the
time during which goods may be kept in
storage, prescribing the method of dis
posing cf them if kept beyond the per
mitted period, and requiring goods re
leased from storage in all cases to bear
the date of their receipt. It would also
be most serviceable if it were provided
that all goods released from cold storage
for interstate shipment should have
plainly marked upon each package the
selling or market price at which they
went into storage, in order that the pur
chaser might be able to learn what prof
its stood between him and the producer
or the wholesale dealer. Indeed, it would
be very serviceable to the public if all
goods destined for interstate commerce
were made to carry upon every packing
case whose form made it possible a plain
statement of the price at which they left
the hands of the producer. I respect
fully call your attentjon, also, to the
recommendations of the message referred
to with regard to a federal license for all
corporations engaged in interstate com
merce.
Justice For Labor.
"In brief, the immediate legislative
need of the time is the removal of all ob
stacles to the realization of the best am
bitions of our people in their several
classes of employment and the strength
ening of all instrumentalities by which
difficulties are to be met and removed
and justice dealt out. whether by law or
by some form of mediation and concilia
tion. I do not feel it to be my privilege
at present to suggest the detailed and
particular methods by which these ob
jects may be attained, but I have faith
that the inquiries of your several com
mittees will discover the way and the
method.
Assistance for Armenia
"In response to what I believe to be
the impulse of sympathy and opinion
throughout the United States I earnest
ly suggest that the congress authorize
the treasury of the United States to
make to the struggling government of
Armenia such a loan as was made to
several of the allied governments during
the war and I would also suggest that it
would be desirable to provide in the
legislation itself that the expenditure
of the money thus loaned should be un
der the supervision of a commission or
at least a commissioner from the
United States, in order that revolution
ary tendencies within Armenia itself
might not he afforded by the loan a
further tempting opportunity.
Independence for Filipinos.
"Allow me to call your attention to
the fact that the people of the Philip
pine islands have succeeded in main
taining a valuable government since the
last action of the congress* in their be
half, and have thus fullfilled the con
dition set by the congress as precedent
to a consideration of granting independ
ence to the islands- I respectfully sub
mit that this condition precedent having
been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and
our dutv to keep our promise to the
people of those islands by granting
them the independence which they so
honorably covet.
"I have not so much laid before you
a series of recommendations, gentlemen,
as sought to utter a confession of faith,
of the faith in which I was bred and
which it is my solemn purpose to stand
by until my last fighting day. I be
lieve this to be the faith of America,
the faith of the future, and of all the
victories which await national action
in the days to come whether in America
or elsewhere."
