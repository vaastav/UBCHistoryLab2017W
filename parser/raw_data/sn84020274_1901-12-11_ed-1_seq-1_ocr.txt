MRS. BLAIR HAS
FOR THE
She Will Personally Teach Music for the Benefit of the St. Louis
Public With the Assistance of the Morning Choral Club.
Technical Knowledge of the Art
Not Necessary and the Lesions
Will Ke Entirely Free.
5Ir. Jamis I- Blair has a remedy for
tlie ragtime fevtr. She will teach music
for the benefit of the St. Louis public.
The lady Is prepared to follow her expo
sition of music needs and music apprecia
tion In St. Louis by suggesting and per
rorally conducting a means of reiredy.
With the cooperation and assistance of
the Morning Choral Club, of which she Is
president, Sir". Hlalr will, each Tuesday
morning during the wlntT, conduct a class
for the study of sight reading.
There will be no lees. The Imitation is
gereral. AH mho can attend regularly for
one hoi.r on each Tuesday morning from 3
to 10 o'clock, and who desire to Increase
their music knowledge, will be welcome.
It Is not necessary to have any technical
knowledge of mu-!c nor to possess a trained
c!ce to belong to the class. The beginner
he or she who may not !e able to dis
tinguish "Old Hundred" from Nordlca's
much-exploited "Coon Song' will find as
cordial a greeting and as distinctive a
Xilace In the clas exercises as the person
who. having spent many jears in the study
ef music, desires to add to his krow ledge
lay an acquaintance with the Damrosch
system of sight reading, which Is the one
Sirs. Blair will use.
This is not the energetic lady's first es
say at teaching music. Two jears ago she
endertook the s.ime sjstem, and. after
tending several months in New Tork ob
taining information from Walter Dam
rosch In respect to the methods which he
used for the reading of music, came back
to St. Louis and, discovering that the Klrk
vood High School was about to abandon its
study of muic because of lack of funds,
filtered her gratuitous services, which, as is
now well known, were most gratefully and
enthusiastically accepted, lira. Blair car
ried her work to a successful termination
and counts her teaching experience In the
Xibllc schools as one of her most 'valued
possessions.
She will now try the same plan on a
larger scale, and with a much wider scope.
The matter was broached jesterday morn
ing at the regular weekly meeting of the
Morning Choral Club at the Odeon Recital
Hall, and met with warm acclaim from all
members who were present as well as
TO RAISE THE
FRANCHISE TAX.
Mandamus Proceedings Will Be
Brought Against the State
Board of Equalization.
TO FILE THE SUIT THIS MONTH.
City and School Board Will Act
Together Against United Rail
ways Company and Other
Corporations.
The city of St. Louis and the Board of
Education will bring a mandamus suit
JoinUy through tlielr attorneys. City Coun
selor Schnurmacher and Judge Rombauer,
against the State Board of Equalization to
endeavor to compel that body to raise the
franchise tax of the United Railways Com
pany and several other SL Louis corpora
tions. Judge1 Rombauer announced yesterday
evenlng that he would draw up the papers
before the end of this week. He has al
ready been in consultation with Major
Wells and Mr. Schnurmacher. He will pro
ceed to Jefferson City as soon as possible
and bring suit, he said, before the end of
this month.
In his report to the Board of Educa
tion, which met last night. Judge Rom
bauer stated that Major Wells had al
ready Instructed the City Counselor to co
operate in every way in the proposed suit
against the Board of Equalisation.
"The Supreme Court of Missouri," said
Judge Rombauer. "In the Western Union
Telegraph Companj's case, decided on
December 3 that public service corporation
franchise were taxable In this State, even
prior to the act of March 9. 1M1."
Will Be Friendly Salt.
Judge Rombauer has been in consultation
also with Secretary of State Sam B. Cook
and with one of the members of the Board
of Equalization. The board, he said, would
aid him in the legal proceedings, making It
a friendly suit, as all the members were
anxious to hav e the questions at Issue settle!
definitely by the Supreme Court.
"The entire value of the property of the
United Rallwajs Company In SL Louis,"
writes Judge Rombauer in his letter to
Major Well, "as apeais by Mr. Cook's let
ter, was found by the board to be aqual to
RO.COO.OOO. They deducted from this amount
the value of the tangible property, namely
$8,000,000. and then Instead of assessing the
residue of ICWO.OQO upon the valuation of
the franchise, as the statute provides, asses
sed only an additional amount of 18.S00.000.
"Section 9354 of the Revised Statutes pro
Tides that this species of property shall be
subject to taxation for 8tate, county, mu
nicipal and other purposes, to the same ex
tent as real and personal property of pri
vate persons. I cannot conceive on what
theory, even If the statute were out of the
war, the property of corporations enjoying
valuable public privileges should be taxed
upon a valuation of less than one-third of
Its actual cash value, when the property
of private persons Is admittedly taxed at
m. valuation of more than two-thirds.
"I believe the matter can be tested at
any time. Section t&t of the Revised
Statute provides that the State Board
of Canalisation may assess and readjust
ta assessment for any year on this
paries of property, when the assessment
-ftc any cause should be held by tha courts
ta be, Irregular and void."
Ta latere Schawl Tata.
On a motion offered by B. C Eliot, FreaL
'dent Behroers appointed a committee of
'three to confer with similar committees
from Kansas City and St. Joseph boards of
'adocatlon In an endeavor to have tha
school 'tax raised from 40 to Ml cents. This
el vita the unanimous approbation of the

ANOTHER HEARING FOR KERENS.

Washington. Dec. 10. Colonel R. C.
Kerens had another hearing with the Presi
dent to-day, but no definite decision was
reached in regard to the St. Louis survey
orshlp. Chairman Aklns said this evening that he
Is looking for the nomination to be sent
to the Senate this week, and that he feels
confident Boyd will be appointed.
There has been some mention of Judge
Gallenkamp of Union as a possibility, but
so far as can be learned. Boyd's prospects
are better than any candidate yet men
tioned. The opposition has centered its lire
on Boyd personally, and claims confidently
that he will be defeated. Nothing to war
rant this claim can be had at the White
House, where President Roosevelt's Inten
tions are guarded as closely as heretofore.
The St. Louis Congressmen say they will
"stand pat" 'for Bojd and have no other
name to suggest. 'and that they will not
listen to any compromise candidate. Both
aides are watching; the matter closely, but
there has been no real development during
the day.

City .Counselor Gives Opinion in
Contemplated Action Against
President Hawes.
To President Hawes of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners and City Attorney Perry
Post Taj lor, who called jesterday for an
opinion In regard to the legality of the ap
plicat:on of Attorney Xoland of the South
ern Telegraph and Money Order Company
for a warrant against Mr. Hawes, City
Counselor Schnurmacher stated that a war
rant cannot be properly Issued.
Messrs. Hawes and TaIor visited the
City Counselor for the purpose of getting
an Impartial opinion concerning the pro
ceeding. Mr. Schnurmncher's conclusion,
which is to be produced in writing,
strengthens the attitude of Mr. Taj lor.
It is understood that Mr. Schnurmacher
takes the position that the Board of Po
lice Commissioner-., acting in its official capacity-
and according to Its Judgment, can
not be held responsible, particularlj- In n
criminal matter. And, therefore, a warrant
could not properly be issued.
Attornej- Noland appeared before As
sistant Prosecuting Attornej- Johnson J'es
terday to make formal application for
warrants charging oppression In office
against President Hawes of the PoTTS
Board and other member of the depart
ment who are responsible for the raids on
the Southern companj's office. The trend
of Mr. Xoland's argument was that Mr.
Hawes was uIng his official position as
President of the Police Board to strike nt
Cclonel Ed Butler, who is known to be in
terested In the concern. City Attornej
Tajlor was present to answer Mr. Noland,
and both attornej s presented formal ar
guments, which were transcribed by a
stenographer.
After Mr. Noland had gone ttorney
Johnson said he thought he probably would
Issue a warrant charging illegal arrest, but
as the raids were ordered at the advice of
the City Attornej- he hardly could see his
way clear to charge Mr. Hawes with op
pression In office.
Mr. Hawes. In reply to Attorney Xoland's
charge that he was prompted in the raids
of the telegraph company by political ani
mus, said that Mr. Noland was In error.

REFUSE TO DISCUSS
MRS BLAIR'S REMARKS
i
Miss
A.
Helen Gould and Mrs. .John
McCall Decline to Com
ment on Criticism.
RKPOBUC SPECIAL.
New York. Dec. 10. Neither Miss Helen
Gould nor Mrs. John A. McCall would dis
cuss to-day the criticisms of Mrs. James L.
Blair of St. Louis, concerning their failure
to attend the meeting of the Board of Ladj
Manngers of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position held ut the Manhattan Hotel this
citj- on December 5.
Miss Gould, through her secretarj', sajd
she had accepted appointment as a member
of the board on condition that she should
be absolved from the obligations of active
membership. No further explanation of
her falluro to attend the meeting was
vounchsafed.
It is Intimated, however, that Miss Gould
availed herself of this opportunity to em
phasize the conlltlon upon which she ac
cepted the appointment without, however,
anj- Intention to otTend the visiting mem
bers. Miss Gould, it will be recalled, stated dis
tinctly in her letter to the Commissioners
of the World's Fair that her health was
not as good as it might be. and gave the
Impression that she could not devote as
much time to the enterprise as sh would
like to.
Miss Gould, It Is said, was rather sur
prised that the board should have come to
New York, and. although she is not re
snonslbl for the statement of those who
are supposed tc be conversant with the
subject she suspected that New York was
chosen with a view of enlisting her beyond
her strength.
Why Mrs. McCall absented herself from
the meeting is a mjstery not easily solved.
When a representatives of The Republic
called upon Mrs. McCall this evening, she
begged to be excused, on the plea that she
never talks for puolic.ition. In response to
a note, in which It was stated that the vis
iting members of the Board of Lady Man
agers felt that they had been lnhospitably
recelved In New York, this message was re
ceived: "Mrs. McCall has nothing whatever to
aaj."

FOrUkER OUT FOR ROOSEVELT;
HANNA MACHINE SEEMS DOOMED.
First Republican Leader Since Mr. JIcKinley'a Death to Unquali

Determined Stand Against His Colleague JlayLead
to Break in JIanna's Forces.
SENATOR'S ACTION A STRONG
Th- R'Dublle Bureau.
Hth St. an I Pennsylvania At.
Washington. Dc. 10 Senator Foraker
has put himself squarely on record against
Mark Ilanna for President by announcing
that he Is in favor of Hoosevelt In 1S0I.
Thl is the first announcement by any Re
publican leadT !nce JlcKlnley's death
that he Is unqualifiedly for Koosevelt to
succeed himself.
JIanv expressions of support for Roose
velt's administration have ben made by
Republican Senators and Representatives,
but they have stopped short of coins on
record in favor of Roosevelt's nomination
in 19jI In the main, they hav meant no
more than a purpose to support the Pres
ident's policies and to accept the situation
forced upon the party by JIcKinley's d-ath.
Mr. Foraker's announcement will lend
an impetus to the upbuilding of the Roose
velt machine. Foraker has not failed to see
the political significance of President
Roo--velfsi turrdown of five of Hanna's
National Committeemen, exclusive of the
repudiation of Kerens, now pending, ard
.-
, the Ohio Senator decisively aligns himself
, with the Roosevelt rather than the Ilanna
organization.
Foraker is the strongest man jet secured
for the Rcosevelt organization. He is rated
as one of the ablest men In Washington,
and the fact that he lives In Hanna's Stite
will encourage further breaking away from
the present National Committee, its policies
and candidates for 1904.
"I have selected mj- candidate for Presw
ident in 1S-H. His name is Theodore Roose
velt." This is the emphatic declaration of Sen
ator Foraker as an Incident to his discus
sion of the row un-onrr the Ohio Repub
licans. The mtlmitlon from Ilanna sources
that he might be advancing his chancer as
a presidential candidate three jear hence

DEMOCRATS SWEEP
THE CITY OF ROSTON
Gen. Collins Gains Greatest Plural
ity of Quarter of Century Re
publican Kepeaters Arrested.
Boston. Mass . Dec. 10 The Democrats
completely ov erwhelmed the Republicans In
tlie citv elections to-daj-. Gercral Patilckr
A. Collins being elected Major over Mayor
Thomas N. Hart bj- the largest plurality in
a quarter of a century.
The Democrats likewise obtained control
of both branches of the cltj- government,
elected their Street Commissioner. Salem
D. Charles, and practical!- all their can
didates for the School Commission. As
usual the city voted strongly In favor of
license.
The resjlt of the canvass was fully as
much of a wirprise to the Democrats as to
their opponents. The most sanguine Dem
ocratic prophet last night claimed only
i.00. jet this plurality was nearly tripled.
Two years ago Major Hart defeated Gen
eral Collins by 2.2S1 vote, and polled some
th'ng over 40.000. This j'ear the total Re
publican vote for Major was a trifle over
S3.0U0, the smallest given a party candidate
for Maj or since 189J, despite a registration
almost M per cent larger than then. Yet
General Collins received over 52.000 votes,
the largest in the history of the city, and
he carried eighteen of the twenty-five
wards.
The Republican lenders were Inclined to
blame the weather to-night, but this does
not account for the tremendous gains made
bj- the Democrats in Republican wards.
Naturally there was great excitement In
the close wards, and in South Boston two
prominent Republican politicians were ar
rested on suspicion of having obtained re
peaters. This, however, was the only un
fortunate feature of the day.
