NATIONAL REPUBLICAN.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
ttUovxlttima of the Senate
and llousi of Rtpnstntatlvts :
In the midst of unprecedented, political trou
bles, we have' caate of great gratitude to God
for unusual good health and most abundant
harvests.
Ton will not be surprised to learn (hit, in
the peculiar exlgenoies of the times, our Inter
course with foreign nations has been attended
with profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon
our own domestic- affairs.
A disloyal portion of the American people
have, during the whole year, been engaged In
an attempt to divide and destroy the Union.
A nation which endures factions domestic dlvi
tton, is exposed to disrespect abroad ; and one
party, If not both, Is sure, sooner or later, to
Invoke forolgn intervention.
Nations thus templed to interfere, are not
always able to resist the counsels of seeming
expediency and ungenerous ambition, although
measures adopted under such Influences seldom
fall to be unfortunate ant Injurious to those
adopting thftn.
1 he disloyal citizens of the Uvt!z States
who have offered the ruiu of our' jonntry, In
return for the aid and comfort which they have
invoked abroad, have received less patronage
and encouragement than they probably ex
pected. If it were just to suppose, as the In
surgents have seemed to assume, that foreign
nations, in this case, discarding all moral, so
cial, and treaty obligations, would act solely
and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of
commerce, Including, especially, the acquisi
tion of cotton, those nations appear, as yet, not
to have seen their way to their object more di
rectly or clearly, through the destruction, than
through the preservation of the Union. If we
could dare to believe that foreign nations are
actuated by no higher principle than this, lam
quite sure that a sound argument could be
made to show them that they can reach their
elm more readily and easily by aiding to crush
this rebellion, than by giving encouragement
to it.
The principal lever relied on by the Insur
- gents fur excltlog foreign nations to hostility
against us, as already Intimated, is the embar
rassment of commerce. Those nations, how
ever, not Improbably, saw from the first, that
it was the Union which made, as well our
foreign, as our domestic commerce. They can
scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort
tor disunion produces the existing difficulty;
and that one strong nation promises more dur
able peace, and a more extensive, valuable, and
reliable commerce, than can the same nation
broken into hostile fragments.
It is not my purpose to review our Idlscnr
aionswith foreign States; because whatever
might be their wUhes,"or dispositions, the in
tegrity of our oountry, and the stability of our
Government, mainly depend, not upon them,
but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and in
telligence of the American people. The cor
respondence Itself, with the usual reservations,
la herewith submitted.
I venture to hope it will appear that we have
practiced prudence and liberality towards for
eign Powers, averting onuses of irritatlen;
and, with firmness, maintaining our own rights
and honor.
Since, however, it is apparent that here, as
In any other State, foreign dangers necessarily
attend domestic difficulties. I recommend that
adequate and ample measures be adopted for
maintaining the public defences on every side.
While, under this eeneral recommendation,
provision for defending our sea coast line read
ily occurs to the mind, I also, In the same con
nection, ask the attention of Congress to our
oreat lakes and rivers. It is believed that
nmA fnrttflnatlona and denote of arms and mu
nitions, with harbor and navigation Improve-j
ments, at ail well seieoiea points upon inese,
would be of great Importance to the national
defenoe and preservation. I oak attention to
the views of the Secretary of War, expressed
In his report, upon the same general subject. I
I deem It of Importance that the loyal regions
of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina
should be connected with Kentnoky, and othei
faithful parts of the Union, by railroad. I
tnereioro recommeuu, ua a umiuujr uicbuiu
that Congress provide for the construction of
such rood, as speedily as possible. Kentucky,
no doubt, will co-operate, and, through her
Legislature, make the moat judicious selection
of a line. 1 he northern terminus must con
rest with some existing railroad; and whether
the route shall be from Lexington, or Niohol
asvllle, to the Cumberland Gap; or from Le
banon to the Tennessee liar, In the direction of
Knoxvllle; or on tome still different line, can
easily bo determined. Kentucky and the Gen
eral Government oo-operating, the work can
be completed In a very short time; and when
done, it will be not only of vast present use
fulness, but also a valuable permanent Im
provement, worth its cost In all the future.
Some treatles.deslgned chiefly for the Inter
mix nf commerce, and hsvlnor no crave politl-
cal importance, have been negotiated, and will
be submtttca to tne senate ior meir cuuuuor
nttnn
Although we have failed to Induce some of
the commercial Powers to adopt a desirable
melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we
have removed all' obstructions from the way of
this humane reform, except such as are merely
of temporary and accidental occurrence.
I invite your attention to tbe correspond
ence between her Brltannio Majesty's minister
accredited to this Government, and the Secre
tary of State, relative to the detention of the
British ship Perthshire, In June last, by the
United States steamer Massachusetts, for a
sapposed breach of tbe blockade. As this de
tention was occasioned by an obvious misap
prehension of the facts, and as justice requires
that we enouiu commit nu Deiugereui not not
founded in strict right, as sanctioned by pub Ho
law, I recommend that an appropriation be
mode to satisfy the reasonable demand cf the
owners of the vessel for her detention.
1 repeat the recommendation of my prede
cessor, In his annual message to Congress In
December last, In regard to the disposition of
the surplus which will probably remain after
satisfying the claimB of American citizens
against Uhlna, pursuant to the awards of the
commissioners, under the act of the 3d March,
i B',o if however. It should not be deemed
advisable to carry that recommendation Into
effect, I would suggest that authority be given
for Investing the pnncipai, over mo fiuvi.
of tho surplus referred to, In good securities,
with a view to the satlslaotlon of such other
lust claims of onr oltlzens against China as are
not unlikely to arise hereafter In the courso or
our extensive trade with that empire.
By the oot of the 6th of August lost, Con
gress authorized (he President to instruct the
commanders of suitable vessels to defend them
selves against, and to capture pirates. This
authority has been exercised in single in
stance only. For the more effectual protection
of our extent! ve and valuable commerce. In
the' eastern seas especially, It seems to me that
it itould also be advisable to authorize the
commanders of sailing vessel to reoaptura any
prizes whioh pirates may make of United Etttes
vessels and their cargoes, and tbe consular
courts, now established by law in eastern
countries, to adjudicate the cases, In the event
mat urn aauuiu uut ua uvjcvteu mj wj wo iwunt
authorities.
If any good reason exists why we should
persevere lontrer in withholding our recogni
tion of the Independence and sovereignty of
Haytl and Liberia, l am unable to aucern it.
Unwilling, however, to Inaugurate a novel pot
ior in retard to them without the approbation
of Congress, I submit for your consideration
tne expeaienoy oi an appropriation ior main
taining a charge d'affaires near each of those
new States. It does not admit of doubt that
Important commercial advantages might be
secured by favorable treaties with them.
The operations of the Treasury during the
period which has elapsed since your adjourn
ment have been oonducted with signal suo-
The patriotism of tbe people has placed
at the disposal of the Government the large
means demanded by 'the publlo exigencies.
Much of the national loan has been taken by
citizens of the industrial classes, whose confi
dence in their oountry's faith, and seal for
tl elr country's deliverance irom present pern.
b ,ve Induced them to contribute to the sup
d rt of the Government tbe whole of their lim
ited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar
obligations to economy in disbursement and
energy in aotton.
The revenue from all sources, including
loans, for the financial year ending on the 30th
June. 1861, was (86,835,900.27, and tbe ex
penditures for the same period, Including pay
ments on account of the publlo debt, were
18i,578,834.47 ; leaving a balance in the Trea
sury, on the 1st July, of $2,257,065 80. For
the first quarter of the financial year, ending
!n the 30th September, 1861, the receipts from
11 sources, including the balance of 1st of
July, were $102,531,509.27: and the expenses
S98,Z3.733.us : leaving a oaiance, on tne isi
of October. 1861. of $4,293,776.18.
I Estimates for the remaining three quarters of
the year, and for tbe nnanoial year J.8S3, to
gether with his views of ways and means for
leeung tne uemauua uuutcuipinwu Uj uivui,
ill he submitted to Oontrress bv the Secreta
ry of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know
jtbat the expenditures made necessary by the
rebellion are not oeyouo tue resources oi we
loyal people, and to believe that the same po
trfotflm which boa thus far sustained the Gov
ernment will continue to sustain it till Feace
land Union shall again bless the land,
i I respectfully refer to the report ef the Sec
retary of War for Information respecting the
numerical strength of the army, and for recom
mendations having In view an Increase of its
efficiency and tbe well being of the various
branches of the service intrusted to Ills care.
It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of
the people has proved equal to the occasion,
rand that the number of troops tendered great
ly exceeds tbe roroe wnicn uongress aumonzea
me to call Into the field.
I -refer with pleasure to those portions of his
report which make allusion to the creditable
degree of discipline already attained by our
troops, and to the exoellent sanitary condition
of the entire army.
The recommendation of the Seoretary for an.
organization of the militia upon a uniform ba
sis, is a subject of vital importance to tbe fu
ture safety of the country, aud is commended
to the serious attention of Congress.
The lam addition to the regular army, in
connection with the defection that has so con
siderably diminished the number of Its officers,
gives peculiar importance to his recommenda
tion lor increasing the corps of cadets to the
greatest capacity of the Military Academy.
By mere omission, I presume, Congress has
failed to provide chaplains for hospitals ooou
pled by volunteers. This subject was brought
to my notice, and I was induced to draw up
tbe form of a letter, one copy of which, prop
erly addressed, has been delivered to etch of the
persons, and at the dates reBpectlvley named
and stated, in a schedule, containing also the
form of the letter, marked A, and herewith
transmitted.
These gentlemen, 1 understand, entered npon
the duties designated, at the times respectively
stated in the schedule, and have labored faith
fnllv therein ever since. I therefore reoom-
mend that they be compensated at the same
rate as obapiains in tne army, i ljiiuer oug'
gest that general provision be made for chap
lalns to serve at hospitals, as well as with regl
ments.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy pre
sents In detail the operations of that branch ot
the service, the activity and energy which
have characterized its Administration, and the
results of measures to increase its efficiency
and power. Such have been the additions, by
construction and purchase, that it may almost
be said a navy has been created and brought
into service since our difficulties commenced.
Besides blockading our extensive coast,
squadrons larger than ever before assembled
under our nag nave oeen put auoat suu per
formed deeds which have increased our naval
renown.
I would Invito special attention to the re
commendation of the Secretary for a more per
fect organization of the navy by introducing
additional grades in the service.
The nresent organization is defeotive and
unsatisfactory, and the suggestions submitted
by the Department will, It Is believed, If
adopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to,
promote harmony, and tnerease the efficiency
ot the navy.
Thpr are three racanoles on the bench of
the Supremo Court two by the decease of
Justloes Daniel and MoLean, and one by tho
resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so
far iorborne making nominations to fill these
vacancies for reasons which I will now state.
Two or the outgoing judges resided within the
States now overrun by revolt ; so that It 'suo
unnn nr,lnlri In the same localities.
theycould not now serve npon their circuits; and
many or tne most competent men mere, pruu
blv would not take the personal hazard of uC'
eentlntr to serve, even here, noon the supreme
bench. I have been unwilling to throw all tho
appointments nortnward, thus disabling my
self from doing justice to the South on the re
turn ot peaoe ; attnougn i may remark tbat to
transfer to tbe North one which has heretofore
been In the South, would not, with reference to
territory and population, be unjust.
During the long and brilliant judicial career
of Judge MoLean his circuit grew into an em
pirealtogether too large for any one Judge to
give the courts therein mors than a nominal at
tendance rising In population from ono"toM1on
four hundred and seventy thousand and eigh
teen, in 1830, to six million one.hundred and
fifty-one thousand four hundred and five, In
IBtiU.
Besides this, the country ircneraltv has out
grown our present judicial system. If uni
formity was at ail intended, tne system requires
tnat ail tne states snail be accommodated witn
circuit courts, attended by supreme judges,
while, Id fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa,
Kansas, Florida, Toxas, California, and Oregon,
have never had any such courts. Nor can this
well be remedied without a cbsqge of the
system ; because the adding of judges to the
Supreme Court, enough for the accommoda
tion of all parts of the country, with circuit
courts, would create a oourt altogether too
numerous for a judicial body pf any sort. And
the evil, If It be 'one, will increase as new
States come into the Union. Circuit courts
are useful, or they are not useful. If useful,
no State should be denied them ; If not useful,
no state snooia nave tnem. Let tnem be pro
Tided for all. or abolished as to all.
Three modifications occur to me, either of
which, I think, would be an Improvement upon
our present system. Let the Supreme Court
be of convenient number in every event. Then,
first, let the whole country be divided. Into
circuits of convenient size, the supreme judges
to serve in a number of them corresponding to
their own number, and independent circuit
judges be provided for all tho rest. Or, sec
ondly, let the supreme judges be relieved from
circuit duties, and circuit judges provided for
all the circuits. Or, thirdly, dispense with
circuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial
functions wholly to the district courts and an
independent Supreme Court.
1 respectfully recommend to tne considera
tion of Congress the present condition of the
statute laws, with the hope that Congress will
be able to find an easy remedy for many ol the
Inconveniences and evils which constantly em
barrass those engaged In the practical admin
istration of them. Since the organization of
the Government, Congress has enacted some
five thousand acta and joint resolutions, which
fill more than six thousand closely-printed
pages, and are scattered through many vol
umes. Many of these acts have been drawn In
baste and without sufflcleut caution, so that
their provisions are often obscure In them
selves, or In conflict with eaoh other, or at least
so doutmul as to render it very uinicuu ior
even the best Informed persons to ascertain
preoisely what the statute law really Is.
It seems to me very Important tbat the stat
ute laws should be made as plain and Intelli
gible as possible, and be reduced to as small a
compass as may consist with the fullness and
precision of the will of the legislature and the
perspicuity of Its language. This, well done,
would, I think, greatly facilitate tho labors of
those whose duty it Is to assist In the adminis
tration of tbe laws, and would be a lasting
beneSt to the people, by placing before them,
In a more accessible and Intelligible form, the
laws which so deeply concern tbelr Interests
and their duties.
I am Informed by some whose opinions I re
spect, that all the acts of Congress now in
force, and of a permanent and general nature,
might be revised and re-written, so as to be
embraced in one volume (r at most, two vol
umes) of ordinary and convenient size. And
I respectfully recommend to Congress to con
sider of the subject, and, If my suggestion be
approved, to devise snch plan as to their wis
dom shall seem most proper for the attainment
of the end proposed.
One of the unavoidable consequences of the
present Insurrection is the entire suppression.
In many places, of all the ordinary means of
administering civil justice oy me omcers, ano
In the forms of existing law. This Is the case,
in whole or in part, In all the insurgent States;
and as our armies advance upon and taKpos
session of parts of those States, the practical
evil becomes more apparent, mere are no
courts nor officers to whom the citizens of other
States may apply for tho enforcement of their
lawful claims against citizens of the Insurgent
States; and there Is a vast amonnt of debt con
stituting sucn Claim. Dome nave cetimatea it
as high as two hundred million dollars, due, in
large port, from insurgents, In open robelllon,
to loyal citizens who are, even now, making
great sacrifices In the discharge of their pat
riotic duty to support the Government.
Under these circumstances, I have been urg
ently solicited to establish, by military power,
oourts to administer summary justice In tuci
oases. I have thus far declined to do it. not
because I bad any donbt that the end pro
posedthe collection of the debts was just
and right In Itself, but because I have been un
willing to go beyond the pressure of necessity
in the unusual exercise of power. But the
powers of Congress I suppose are equel to tbe
anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the
whole matter to Coogresa, with the hope that a
plan may be devised for tbe administration of
Justice in an sucn parts oi me insurgent ouues
and Territories aa may ue uuuvr me control ui
this Government, whether by a voluutary re
turn to allegiance and order, or by the power
of our arms. This, however, not to be a per
manent Institution, but a temporary substitute,
and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can
be re-established In peaoe.
It Is important that some more convenient
means should bo provided, If possible, for tbe
adjustment of claims against the Government,
especially in view of their increased number
by reason of the war.
It is as much the duty of Government to
render prompt justice against Itself, In favor of
citizens, as It Is to administer the same, between
private Individuals. The investigation and
adjudication oi claims, id tueir nature uetuuK
and forty cents, being about two per cent leu
than the revenue for 1860.
The expenditures were thirteen million sit:
hundred and six thousand seven hundred and
fifty-nine dolltrs and eleven cents, showing a
decrease of more than eight per cent as com-
fiared with those of the previous year, and
eat lag an excess of expenditure over the rev
enue for the last fiscal year of four million five
aanoreu ana mty-eevea thousand, lour Hundred
and s xty-two dollars and seventy-one cents.
The gross revenue for the year ending June
30, 1863, Is estimated at an Increase of fonr
per cent on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to
which should be added tho earnings ot the De
part in carrying free matter, viz : $700,000,
making $9,383,000.
The total'eipendltures for 1863, ore estima
ted at $12,528,000, leaving an estimated defi
ciency or $3,145,000 to be supplied from the
treasury, in addition to the permanent appro
priation. The present Insurrection shows, I think, that
tbe extension of this District across the Poto
mac river, at the time of establishing the capi
tal hero, was eminently wise, and consequently
that the relinquishment or that portion of it
whloh lies within the State of Virginia was un
wise and danaerous. I anhmlt far vntii- nnn.
slderatlon the expediency of regaining that
pan ui mo uiatrici, ano tne restoration or tne
original boundaries thereof, through negotia
tions with the State or Vlrelnla.
The report of the" gaorotnrv nf th Interior.
with the accompanying doouments, exhibits
the condition or tho several branohes of the
publlo business pertaining to that department.
The depressing influences of the Insurrection
have been especially felt in the operations of
tho Patent and General Land Offices. The cssh
reoelpts from the sales of publlo lands during
tho past year havo exceeded the expenses of
our land system only about two hundred thous
and dollar. The sales havo been entirely sus
pended in tbe Soutborn States, while the Inter
ruptions to the business of the country, and
the diversion of large numbers of men from
labor to military service, have obstruoted set
tlements In the new States and Territories of
the Northwest.
The receipts of the Patent Office have de
clined in nine months about one hundred thous
and dollars, rendering a large reduction of the
force employed neoessary to make It self sus
taining. Tbo demands upon the Pension Offloe will be
largely Inoreased bvthe Insurrection. Numer.
ous applications for pensions, based UDon the
-... .. .. . ...
casualties oi me existing war. nave already
been made. There Is reason to believe that
many who are now upon the pension rolls and
the latter, thus liberated, are already depend
ent on the United Btates, and must be provided
for to some way. Besides this, It Is not Impos
sible that some of the States will pass sim
ilar enactments for their own benefit respect
ively, and by operation of whloh, persons ol
tbe same class will be thrown upon them
for disposal. In such case I reoommend that
Congress provide for accepting suoh persons
from suoh States, Kccording to some mode ol
valuation, In lieu, pro tanto, of dlreot taxes,
or upon some other plan to be agreed on with
such Btatesrsspe otlvely; that suoh persons,
on such acceptance bythe General Government,
bo at once deemed free; and that, In any event,
steps be taken for colonizing both classes, (or
the one first mentioned, If tbe other shall not
be brought Into existence,) at some plaoe, or
places, in a climate congenial to tnem. It
might be well to oonslder, too, whether tbe
free colored people already In the United Btates
oould not, so far as Individuals may desire, be
Included in suoh colonization.
To oarry out the plan of colonization may In
volve tbe acquiring of territory, and also the
appropriation of money beyond that to be ex
pended In the territorial acquisition. Having
praotloed the acquisition of territory for nearly
sixty years, the question of constitutional
power to do so Is no longer an open one with
us. The power was Questioned at Ant br Mr.
Jefferson, who, however, In the purobase of
Louisiana, yielded his soruples on the plea of
great expeaienoy. it n ne said mat tne only
legitimate object of acquiring territory Is to
furnish homes for white men, this measure ef-
ieou mat oDjeot; ior tne emigration or colored
men leaves additional room for white men re
maining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, how
ever, piacea ine importance oiproouring Lou
isiana more on polltlsal and commercial
grounds than on providing room for popula
tion. On this whole proposition, Including the ap
propriation of money with the acquisition of
territory, does not the expediency amount to
absolute necessity that, without whloh the
Government Itself cannot be perpetuated!
The war oontinues. In considering the policy
to be adopted for suppressing the insurreotlou,
I have been anxious and careful that the Inev
itable confllot for this purpose shall not degen
erate Into a violent and remorseless revolu
tionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every
case, thought It proper to keep the Integrity
of the Union prominent as the primary objeot
of the contest on our part, leaving all questions
whloh are not or vital military Importance to
the more deliberate action or the legislature.
In tbe exeroise of my best discretion, I have
adhered to the blockade of the ports held by
the Insurgents, Instead of putting In force, by
or .Congress enacted at
to the judicial department; besides, It Is appa
ll bo
rant that tbe attention of Congress wil
more than usually engaged, for some time to
come, with great national questions, it was
intended, by the organization of the Court of
Claims, mainly to remove this branch of busi
ness from thehalls of Congress; but while the
court has proved to be an effective and valua
ble means of Investigation, it In great degree
falls to effect the objeot cf Us creation fur want
of power to make its judgments final.
Fully aware of the dellcaoy, not to say the
danger, of tbe subject, I commend to your
careful consideration whether this power of
making judgments final, may not properly bo
given to the court, reserving tho right of ap
peal on questions of law to the Supreme Court,
with such other provisions as experience may
have shown to be necessary.
I nnW attention to the report of tbe Postmas-
tAr Kaneral. the following belne a summary
statement of the condition of tbe Department :
The revenue Irom an sources uuring tne us
cal year ending June SO, 1801, Including the
annual permanent appropriation of seven hun
dred thousand dollars for the transportation of
" free mall matter," as nine million forty-nine
thousand two hundred and ninety-six dollars
In reoelpt of tbe bounty of the Government,
are In the ranks of tbe Insurgent army, or
clvlns; them aid and comfort. The Beeratarv
of the Interior has direoted a suspension of
tue payment oi ine pensions ox sucn persons
upon proof of their disloyalty. I reoommend
that Congress authorize that ofBoer to oause
tne names orsuca persons to be stricken from
the pension rolls.
The relations of the Government with tbe In
dian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the
Insurrection, especially In the southern super
Intendenoy and in that of New Mexioo. The
Indian country south or Kansas Is In the pos
session or Insurgents from Texas and Arkan
sas. The agents of the United States appoint
ed sinoe tbe 4tb of Maroh for this superinten
dencyhave been unable to reach their posts,
while the most of those who were in offloe be
fore that time have espoused the insurrection
ary oause, and assume to exeroise the powers
of agents by virtue of commissions from tbe
Insurrectionists. It has been stated in the
Eubllo press tbat a portlen of those Indians
ave been organized as a military force, and
are attached to the army of the insurgents.
Although tbe Government has no official Infor
mation upon this subject, letters have been
written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
by several prominent chiefs, giving assurance
of their lovalty to the United States, and ex-
nresslnz a wish for the presence of Federal
troops to protect them. It Is believed that
upon the repossession of the country by tbe
Federal forces tbe Indians will readily cease all
hostile demonstrations, and resume their
former relations to the Government.
Agrloulture, confessedly the largest Interest
of the nation, has not a department, nor a
bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to It la
the Government. While it Is fortunate that
this great Interest is so Independent In Its na
ture as to not have demanded and extorted
more from tbe Government, I respectfully ask
Congress to consider whether something more
oannot bo given voluntarily with general advantage.
Annual reports exhibiting the oondltlon of
our agriculture, commeroe and manufactures
would present a fund of Information of great
practical value to the country. While I make
no suggestion as to details, I venture the opin
ion that an agricultural and statistical bureau
mleht nrontablv be organized.
The execution or the laws for suppression of
tne Arrican slave traae uas oeen oonnuea to
tbe Department of the Interior. It is a subject
of gratulatlon that the efforts which have been
maue for tbe suppression of this inhuman traf
fic have been reoently attendod with unusual
success. Five vessels being fitted out for tbe
slave trade have been seized and oondemned.
Two mates of vessels engaged tn the trade, and
one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver,
have been convicted and aubieoted to tbe pen
alty ot nne aim imprisonment, and one captain,
taken with a cargo of Africans on board his
vessel, has been convloted of the highest grade
of offence under our laws, the punishment of
which is death.
Tbe Territories of Colorado, Dakotab and
Nevada.crcated bythe last Congress.have been
organized, aud civil administration has been
Inaugurated therein under auspices especially
orratlfvlnz. when It Is considered that the leav
en of troason was found existing tn some of
these new oottntries when tne Federal officers
arrived there.
The abundant natural resources of these
Territories, with the seourlty and protection
afforded by organized government, will doubt
less Invite to them a large Immigration when
naana shall restore the business of the oountry
to Its accustomed channels. I submit the resi
nlutlons of tho legislature or Colorado, which
evidence the patriotic spirit or the people of
the Territory, do lar tne auinority oi tne
United (states has been upheld In all the Terri
tories, as it is hoped it will be in tbe future
I commend tbelr interests and defence to the
enlightened and gonerous care or uongress.
1 recommena iu tue lavurauio cuiiviueraunn
of Congress the interests of the District of
Columbia. Tho insurrection has been the
cause of much suffering and sacrlflco to its In
habitants, and as they have no representative
in Congress, that body should not overlook
their Just claims upon the Government.
At your late session, a Joint resolution was
adopted authorizing the President to take
measures for facilitating a proper representa

It has been said that one bad general Is bet
ter than two good ones; and the saying is true,
If taken to mean no more than, that on army
Is better directed by a single mind, though In
ferior, than by two superior onts, at variance,
and cress purposes with each other.
And tbe same Is true, Jo all Joint operations
wherein those engaged, can have none but a
oommon oud In view, and can differ only as to
tbe choice of moans. In a storm at sea, no
one on board can wish the jhlp to sink; and
yet, not unfrequently, all go down together,
because too many will dlreot, and no single
mind ean be allowed to control.
It continues to develop that the insurrection
Is largely, Knot exclusively, a war upon the
first prinolple or popular government the
rights or the people. Conclu.lve evidence of
this Is found In tbe most grave and maturely
considered publlo documents, as well as In the
general tone of the insurgents. In those doc
uments we find the abridgment of the existing
right of suffrage, and the denial to the people
of all right to participate in the selection; of
publlo officers, except the legislative, boldly
advocated, with labored arguments to prove
that largo control of the people In government.
Is the source of all political evil. Uouaroby
Itseir Is sometimes hinted at as a posilblo re
fuge from tbe p wer of the people.
In my present position, I oonld scarcely be
Justified were I to omit raising a warning voice
against this apnroaob or returning despotism.
It Is not needed, nor fitting here, that a gen
eral argument should be made In favor or pop
ular institutions; but there is one point, with
Its connections, not so hackneyed as most
others, to which I ask a brier attention. It ts
the effort to place capital on an equal footing
with, If not above labor, In the structure i.t
government. It Is assumed that labor is avail
able only tn connection with oiipltnl; that no
body labors unless somebody else, caning cap
ital, somehow by the use or it, Induces him to
labor. This assumed, it U next con.idered

ors, and thus Induce them to work by tholr
own consent, or buy them, and drive them tu
it without their consent. Having proceded su
far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers
are either huea laborer,! or what v. n.tli
slaves. And furlhor, it U assumed that who
ever Is once a hired laborer, Is fixed In that
condition for life.
NOW. there is no such relation batweun rao.
It tl and labor as assumed; nor Is there any such
iuiok na u iree man oeing nxeu ior lire in tne
condition or a hired laborer. Both these as
sumpt ons are false, and all Inferences from
them are groundless.
Labor Is prior to, aid Independent of, capi
tal. Capital Is only the fruit of lbor, and
could never have existed If labor had not first
existed. Labor Is the superior of capital, and
deserves much the higher consideration. Cap
ital has Its rights, which are as worthy of pro
tectlon as any other rights. Nor Is It denied
that there Is, and probably always will be a
relation between labor und capital, producing
mutual benefits. The error Is In assuming
that the whole labor of commauity exists
within that relation. A few men own capital,
and that few avoid labor themselves, aud. with
their capital, hire or buy another few to labor
for them. A large majority belong to neither
class neither work for others, nor have others
working for them. In most of tho Southern
States, a majority of the whole people, of nil
colon, are neither slaves nor masters ; while
In the Northern, a large majority are neither
hirers nor hired. Men with tbelr families
wives, sons, and daughters work for them
selves, on tbelr farms, In tbelr bouses, and In

defined and more distinct now; and the pro
gress of events Is plainly In the right direction.
Tbe Insurgents confidently claimed a strong
support from north of Mason and Dixon's line;
and the frlonds or the Union wero not free
from apprehension on the point. This, how
ever, was soon settled definitely, and on the
right sido. South of the line, noble little Dol
aware led off right from the first. Maryland
was made to teem ngalmt the Union. Our sol
diers wero assaulted, bridges were burned,
and railroads torn up, within ber limits; and
we were many days, at one time, without the
ability to bring a single regiment over her
soil to the capital. Now, her bridges and rail
roads are repaired and open to the Govern
ment ; she already gives seven regiments to
the cause of the Union, and none to the e nsmy ;
and ber people, at a regular election, nave bus
proclamation, tne law or Congress
the late session for dosing those ports.
--So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence
m won as too uuugauuna oi law, instead ox
transoendlng, I have adhered to tbe act of
congress to confiscate property used for In
surrectlonary purposes. If a new law upon
tbe same subjeot shall be proposed, Its propri
ety will be duly considered. The Union must
be preserved; and bence, all Indispensable
means must oe employed, we sbould not be
In haste to determine that radical and extreme
measures, which may reach the loyal as well
as tbe disloyal, are lndlsnensable.
Tbe inaugural address at1, the beginning of
me Aamimsirauon, ana tne message to Con
gress at the late special session, were both
mainly devoted to the domestlo controversy
out of which the insurrection and consequent
war have sprung. Nothing now ooours to add
or subtract, to or from, the principles, or gen
eral purposes, stated and expressed In those
doouments.
The last ray of hone for preserving the Union
peaceably, expired at the assault upon Fort
Bumier; ano a general review or wnat boa oo
one band, nor of hired laborers or slaves on
tbe olber. It Is not forgotten that a consider
able number of persons mingle their own labor
with capital that Is, they labor with their own
hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for
them ; but this Is only a mixed, and not a dls
tlnct class. No principle stated 1b disturbed by
the existence of tbia mixed class.
Again: As has already been said, there is
not, of necessity, any such thing as tbe free
hired laborer being fixed to that condition for
life. Many independent men everywhere iu
these States, a few years bsck in their lives,
were hired laborers. Tho prudent, penniless be
glnner In the world, labors for wagei awhile,
saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land
for himself: then labors on bis own a, count

toined the Union by a larger majority, and a I beginner to help' htm. This Is the just, and
larger aggregate vote, than they ever before I generous, and prosperous syttem, which opens
crave to any candidate or any Question. Ken
tucky, too, for some time In doubt, Is now de
cidedly, and, I think, unchangeably, ranged on
the Bide of the Union. Missouri Is compara
tively quiet, and I believe cannot again be
overrun by the Insurrectionists. These threo
States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri,
neither of which would promise a single soldier
at first, have now an aggregate or not less than
forty thousand in the field, for the Union ;
while, of tbelr citizens, certainly not more than
a third of that number, and they or doubtful
whereabouts and doubtful existence, are In
arms sgalnst It After a somewhat bloody
struggle of months, winter doses on the Union
people 1 1 Western Virginia, leaving them mas
ters of their own country.
An Insurgent force of about fifteen hundred
for months dominating tbe narrow peninsular
region, constituting tbe oountles of Accomao
and Northampton, and known as eastern shore
of Virginia, together with some contiguous
parts or Maryland, have laid down their arms;
and the people there have renewed their alle
giance to and accepted tbe protection of tbe
old flag. This leaves no armed Insurrectionist
north of tbe Potomao, or east of the Ohesa-Deake.

the Isolated points on tbe southern coast of

These things demonstrate that the oause of
tbe Union Is advanolng steadily and certainly
soutnwaru.
Since vour last adiournment. Lieutenant
General Scott has retired from tbe head of tha
army. During bis long life, the nation has not
been nnmlndful of bis merit; yet, on calling to
mind bow faithfully, ably, and brilliantly he
has served the country, from a time far back
in our history, when few of the now living had
been born, and thenceforward oontinually, I
cannot but think we are still his debtors. I
submit, therefore, for vour consideration.
what furthor mark or recognition is due to
him, and to ourselves, as a grateiui people.
With the retirement or General Scott came
the Kxecultve duty tt appointing, In his stead,
a general In chtof or the army. It is a fortu
nate olrcustance that neither tn council nor
country was there, so far as I know, any differ
ence of opinion as to the proper person to be
seleoted. The retiring chtof repeatedly .ex
pressed bis Judgment in favor of General Mo
Clellan for the position: and in this tha nation
seemed to give a unanimous concurrence. The
designation of General MoOIellan Is, thsrefore,
In considerable degree, the selection or the
country, as well as or tbe Executive; and
banco there Is better reason to bops there will
he given blm the confidence, and anrdlal sup
port thus, by fair Implication, promised, and
without whlcb he oannot, with so full offlolsn
cf, serve the eount if.
the way to all gives hope to all, and couse
quent energy, and progress, and Improvemeut
of condition to all. No men living are more
worthy to be trusted than those who toll op
from poverty none less Inclined to taker or
touch, augbt which tbey have not hocestlv
earned. Let Item beware ot surrendering a
political power which they already .osees,
and wblcb, If surrendered, will surely be ued
to close the door of advancement against such
as they, and to Ox new disabilities and bur
dens upon them, till all cf liberty shall be lost.
From the first taking or our National Censun
to the last, are seventy years: and we find our
population, at tbe end of the period, tight times
as great as it was at the beginning. Tte in
crease of those other things, wh ch men deem de
ell able, has been even greater. We thus hare,
at oaa view, what the popular principle, applied
to government, through the machinery of the
States and tbe Union, bits produced in a given
time; and also what, if firmly maintained, It
promises for the future. Tbere are are alreai".
among us this) who, if the Union be preserved,
will live to seo It conUlo two hundred and
fifty millions. The struggle of to day is not
altogether for to-day it Is tor a vast future
also. With a reliance on Providence, all the
more firm and earnest, let us proceed 111 tbe
great task which cvanta have devolved up
on us.
