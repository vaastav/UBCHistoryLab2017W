A CRITICAL WEEK.
While Monday will be a critical day In the
liberal fortunes, with the completion of the
jgnUtry and Lord Rosebery's -speech to the
Liberal Imperialists, next week will also be
fraaeht with momentous consequences to the
Unionist part} Mr. Chamberlain has already
*poken hopefully &&& cautiously at Oxford, but
it dearly waiting for Mr. Balfour to lead the
jriy in ti» new campaign. The tariff reform
en profess to believe that Mr. Baifour will
join Mr. Chamberlain without reserve, and not
cnuie the responsibility of offending the free
traders. Their confidence is not shared by
Mi closest political followers, who assert that
hie first duty will be to keep the Unionist party
together and defend the country against the
revival of Gladstonian Home Rule. The chief
change at court wrought by the information of
the new government will be the appointment
of a mistress of robes in place of the Duchess
of Buccieugh. Since Peel's time It has been
the practice lvi ladies-in-waiting to remain at
court withnut reference to the fortunes of the
>UEistry. The mistress of robes Inva
retires when the Prime Minister resigns office.
It has been customary to have one duchess
follow another, bat it will be difficult for the
new Prime Minister to find one on the Liberal
sjle. The old Whig aristocracy is running
cut, and the House of Lords is so one-sided
that it will hardly bo possible for the Liberals
to keep up debate on the government Bide.
For this reason Sir Henry Campbeil-Banner
nias Is urged to go to the upper house and cre
ate a new batch of Liberal peers, yet that will
be a queer beginning for a radical Ministry.
PRIZES FOR BAI FOURS FRIENDS.
The consolation prizes for the downfall of the
Zionist government go to Mr. Balfour's free
tndt friends rather than Mr. Chamberlain's

flsach and Arthur Ritchie are well earned by
pablk service and the rewards for Journalists
ire timely. Sir Alfred Harms worth at forty
tods himself a baron, whereas his lifelong rival,
Hr. Pearson, Mr. Chamberlain's bashful man
ager, is a plain, unadorned newspaper owner.
Another new baron is Edmund Beckett Paber,
chairman of the directors of "The Yorkshire
Post." a Unionist Journal which has freely criti
cised Mr. Chamberlain's tariff proposals. Poli
tics does not Interfere with social amenities.
The Duke of Devonshire's nephew, Victor
Cavendish, receives one of Mr. Balfour's free
trade honors, and Austen Chamberlain will be
a guest at Welbeck Abbey to meet the King and
Queen next week.
SALE OF IRVING'S TREASURES.
Three days will be needed for the sale of Sir
Henry Ining's pictures, books, ptage relics and
curiosities at Christie's. Among them are many
American gifts. Garrick's ring was a present
from Bdwlo Pooth, and Edwin Forrest's silver
shoe buckles from John McCullough. A land
scape by Joseph Jefferson is among the pictures,
and a portrait of Rip Van "Winkle by the same
hand. Among the books is Walt Whitman's
copy of Shakespeare, with an etching and an
autograph gift from Thomas Donaldson. There
are ten volumes of Henry Ward Becher*s works,
with an autograph In each. There is a silver
presentation cup from the Lotos Club, of Xew-
Tork, and a complete set of Edwin Booth's

GERMANY ANNOYS, AMER
ICA PLEASES FRANCE.
[Special by French C&bl* to Th» New- York Tribune.]
(Copyright. 1905. by Th« Tribune As«oclatlon.)
Paris, Dec. — The attention of the French pub
lic Is this week divided between Washington and
Berlin. The editorial comment of the leading
newspapers, the conversation in the lobbies of the
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, the talk
In diplomatic circles, In society, at the clubs,
cafes and on the Stock Exchange Is almost ex
clusively devoted to discussion of President
Roosevelt's message to Congress and to Prince
yon Billow's .speeches in the Reichstag. There
is no concealing the fact that the German Chan
cellor's statements arouse throughout France
discontent and Irritation. Due allowance is
made for Prince yon Billow's language in regard
to the necessity of Germany's being able to
defend herself alone without the aid of allies
and of the recent strained relations with France
and the present coolness in respect to England,
expressions which Frenchmen attribute to the
Imperial Chancellor's desire to secure from Par
liament additional taxation for military and
naval purposes. What annoys Frenchmen is to
find the German Chancellor still harping on
Morocco with what they consider to be sore
headed peevishness.
TREND OF FRENCH PEELING.
The trend of French feeling Is voiced to-day
by a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
says:
"What ran the German government now com
plain of? We have made since the month of
June every friendly advance possible. We have
been wishing to meet Germany far more than
half way. We have consented to all reason
able, and in certain cases excessive, concessions
that the Berlin Cabinet has demanded of us,
but Germany during the whole time has not
yielded in a spirit of conciliation a single point.
Moreover, the German Chancellor persists in his
111 will and 'mauvaise volonte' toward France
and holds forth vague threats In regard to the
forthcoming conference at Algeciras. German
diplomacy still declines to answer the explicit
questions put by France as to the exact cause
of her dissatisfaction. The Chancellor's ac
cusations in regard to the portion of the
French press desiring to create difficulties for
Germany an£ the efforts of the same organs
to make of the Anglo-French Morocco con
vention an act of unfriendliness toward Ger
many cannot hold water, for all impartial ob
servers must feel convinced no nation in Eu
rope follows a foreign policy more conservative
or more peaceful than that of France to-day "
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE WELCOME.
As an agreeable contrast to the general dissat
isfaction with Prince yon Biilow's speech, which
to the majority of Frenchmen comes as a wet
blanket after all the efforts to conciliate Ger
many, is the satisfaction, not to say enthusiasm,
elicited by President Roosevelt's message, the
strong, manly, personal tone of wTiieh and also
the occasional use of the word sovereign, the
employment of which in the official language of
the Republican Chief Magistrate made Presi
dent Loubet open his eyes with surprise when
he read his newspaper yesterday which con
tained a clear summary of the message to Con
gress, hits on the head the nail of French pop
ularity. "I want to congratulate you on your
President's splendid message," is the common
•form of greeting just now heard by hundreds of
Americans in Paris from their French friends.
President Roosevelt's efforts to put a brake on
excessive military and naval budgets are re
garded here somewhat in the same light as his
proposal to n«: a reasonable rate limit for Amer
ican railroads. In certain quarters President
Roosevelt's ideas in reference to pacification and
arbitration cause eager discussion. It Is Inter
esting to obtain appreciations of that portion of
the messag9 from the President of the French
parliamentary arbitration group, D'Estournelles
de Constant, who, with Leon Bourgeois, is the
permanent French delegate to the Hague tri
bunal. When questioned on the subject by your
correspondent to-day he said: "What I most
admire in President Roosevelt's message is the
way he dwells in such perfect measure on true
patriotism, having for Its base respect for right
and justice. His idea of making rights respected
at the sacrifice, If necessary, of the last drop of
blood, but at the same time to respect the rights
change from Shakespeare to modern comedy Is
probable. The programme Is already shifted at
the Haymarket, where Charles Hawtrey appears
with Nina 'Boucicault and Fanny Brough In
Cosmo Gordon Ler.nox's "The Indecision of Mr.
Kingsbury." an adaptation of a French farce
which excites much thoughtless laughter. The
dull dramatic season Is relieved by the vagaries
of George Bernard Shaw, who write» too many
letters and may" be convicted of the folly of
talking too much, like any ordinary club bore.-
FOOTBALL ACCIDENTS.
While the continuous success of the New-
Zealand team Is likely to revolutionize Rugby
football by substituting open field work for mass
play and hard shoving, the new methods have
not secured Immunity from accident. Three of
the best players — Thompson. Johnston and
Smith— have been so seriously disabled that they
cannot take the field again In England, and
Wallace, one of the fleetest and cleverest three
quarters, Is temporarily knocked out by a heavy
fall. The captain and seven other players had
been previously injured, but have reported at
Blrkenhead for the Cheshire match to-day. The
final International ccntest with the Welsh team
next week will be a severe test when the colonial
team Is crippled. The enormous attendance at
these matches is aiding the movement for chang
ing the rules in making the game more Interest-
Ing to spectators by Increasing passing, running
and open play generally.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN BACKGROUND.
There has been little discussion of foreign af
fairs during the week. No leader writer affects
to understand the chaos prevailing in Russia.
President Roosevelt's discussion of t'ne Monroe
I>octrlne meets with the favor of the English
press, and the practical effect Is shown by the
rise of Central and South American securities.
The German Emperor is not expected to gain
anything from the Morocco conference, with the
majority of the powers against him. With the
new government coming into life and Mr. Bal
four at Manchester to-day attacking it before
It Is born and contrasting it with the decade of
Unionist administration, foreign questions are
snuffed out; so the week ends with a brilliant
display of Balfourlan tactics in defence and
counter-attack, and with the resumption of the
Dean of Westminster's lectures on Biblical criti
cism at the Abbey and the Savage Club dinner
to the American and Japanese ambassadors as

of others, la true patriotism and true morality.
President Roosevelt does not content himself
with a mere philosophical declaration, often
suspicious In the mouth of the head of a state,
but he insists on the second assembly of the
Hajrue conference, and prepares a programme
for that conference, in which he wisely Insists
not upon the reduction, but the revtaonable and
prudent study of the concerted limitation of
military expenses, that until now have been con
stantly increasing. President Roosevelt in this
message once again shows European govern
ments their real duty and true interests in seek
ing to force them to substitute a reasonable un
derstanding for their present differences, which
are threatening for each one of them, and whic]|.
if continued, can only be profitable for socialism^
and anarchy."
AUTOMOBILE DISPLAY.
The eighth annual automobile salon, opened
at the Grand Palais yesterday by President
Loubet. far surpasses any of its predecessors,
not only from the artistic, but from Industrial
points of view. The President on entering the
salon proceeded first, according to custom, to
the stand of the Richsrd-Brasier Company,
which won the Gordon Bennett Interna
tional Cup. After visiting the exhibits of
the Panhard, Bollee, Renault, Darracq, Char
ron. Delahaye, De Dion and other French
makers and the German Mercedes. President
Loubet made a ten minutes' stop at the
exhibit of the American firm of Hotchkiss,
also at the Italian firm of Fiat and the English
firms of Napier and of Rolls Royce. The dominant
characteristics of the 1906 models are. first, that
pressed steel frames are now universally
adopted, and in most cases are narrowed at the
front to permit of easy turning; second, that
the rear wheels are placed at the extreme end of
the frame so that the whole weight is well bal
anced and hangs inside the four wheels; third,
the great improvement and simplicity in the
valves and spray nozzles for carburetters;
fourth, the forced feed system generally adopted
for lubrication; fifth, the invention of automatic
starting apparatus., largely due to prizes offered
by M. Henry Deutsch and the French Academy
of Sports; sixth, touring cars lighter in weight,
yet stronger and more trustworthy, than ever
before. It is noted that the 1906 models are so
much alike m general constructional lines and
appearance that experts can scarcely tell them
apart otherwise than by taking a front view of
the radiators. The French public evinces the
most enthusiastic interest in the automobile
show, which is not only for autocars, in the great
palace, but also for autoboats and balloons, in the
vast hothouse establishments of the city of Paris
along the banks of the Seine. Altogether, it is
a tremendous success.

EVACUATING HARBIN.
Stories of Riot and Disorder at
Vladivostok Exaggerated.
Che-Foo, Dec. 9, 6 p. m. — A merchant who ar
rived to-day from Harbin by way of Vladivos
tok reports that when he left Harbin nine days
ago the railway was operating regularly. He
arrived at Vladivostok after a journey of two
days.
At the time of his departure from Harbin
the employes of the postal telegraph lines were
on strike, but the military telegraphers were
working as usual. He reports the stories of
destruction of property by rioters at Harbin
as incorrect, though some demonstration was
made by unintelligent people who failed to un
derstand the significance of the Emperor's re
cent proclamations. These demonstrations have
not taken the form of riot.
The evacuation of Harbin and other places
along the railway continues as fast as the trans
portation facilities will permit the removal of
troops. The military has been constantly pre
pared to resist any disorder that might possibly
arise. Exaggerated reports have been pub
lished In the Far Eastern papers concerning the
situation at Vladivostok. The report of disor
ders was untrue. Private letters received by
Che-Foo merchants, who axe in continuous com
munication with Vladivostok connections, fall
to reveal any attempt to renew disorders.
Steamers are constantly plying between Che-Foo
and Vladivostok. Telegraphic communication
between Che-Foo and Siberia has been inter
rupted during the last two weeks.
Conversations with persons coming from Har
bin apparently show the causes of possible dem
onstrations at points along the Siberian Railway
to be the same which the visit and investigation
of an Associated Press correspondent at Vladi
vostok on November 15 revealed. The underly
ing difficulties there were as follows:
Many of the reserve troops at Vladivostok be
came restive after the conclusion of peace and
desired to return home. They failed to appreci
ate the difficulties and even the impossibility of
transporting them home quickly. These troops
evidenced in a more aggravated form the dis
satisfaction of the American volunteers In the
Philippines at the conclusion of the Spanish war.
Following the Russian Emperor's proclamation
of freedom the enthusiastic citizens of Vladi
vostok held mass meetings to celebrate his ac
tion. After the public rally the predominant
unintelligent element of the reservists, excited
by the demonstration but not appreciating Its
significance, sought the permission of their offi
cers to attend the meetings, which were liberally
advertised. This permission was refused, the
officers being cautious and believing It Inadvisa
ble to allow large numbers of this class of sol
diers to congregate. The unruly spirits among
the men resented the refusal, and, aided by the
revolutionary element present In Vladivostok as
elsewhere, inflamed the troops to such an extent
that disorder was threatened unless the military
authorities allowed the soldiers Indiscriminately
to attend the celebrations. The desired permis
sion, however, was not given. A boisterous
