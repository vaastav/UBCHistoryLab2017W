PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
PROSTRATION OF BUSINESS AND SUGGESTIONS

To the Senate and House of I2ep-

Since tie corrverang of Congress one
yearago, the nation has undergone a
prostrotjaa m busmess and mdustnes,(akled,
raca as has not oeen witnessed with us
for many years. Speculation as to the

ment, received the remainder -of the
amount due to the United States' under
the) convention of Simonesky. : I Submit
the propriety of applying the income of
a part, if not the whole of this fund, to
the education in the Japanese language
of a number of young men, to be ' under
obligations to serve the government for
a specified time as interpeter w- at the
legation and consulates in Japan. A
limited number of Japanese youth might
at the same time be educated in our own
vernacular, and mutual benefits would
result to both governments. The im
portance of having our own citizens com
petent and familiar with the language of
Japan, to act as interpreters and in oth
er capacities connected with the legation
and consulates in that country, cannot
readily be over-estimated.
THE MIXED COMMISSION AWARD.
the insurrection. It appears equitable
that an opportunity should be offered to
citizens of other States to present their
claims, as well as to those British sub
jects whose claims were not admissible
under the late commission, to the early
decision of some competent tribunal.
To this end I recommend the necessary
legislation to organize a court to dispose
of those claims of aliens, of the nature
referred to, in an equitable and satisfac
tory manner, and to relieve Congress and
tlie departments trom the consideration
of the questions.
The amount awarded the Government
of Great Britain by the mixed commis
sion, organized under the provisions of
the Treaty of Washington, in the set
tlement of the claims of British subjects
arising from acts committed between
April 18th, 1861, and April 9th, 1865,
became payable under the terms of the
treaty within the past year, and was paid
upon the 21s day of September, 1874.
In this connection I renew my recom
mendation, made at the opening of the
last session of Congress, that a- special
court be created to hear and determine
all claims of aliens against the United
States, arising from acts committed
against their persons or property during
NEW FOUNDLAND.

THE STRIFE IN CUBA.
The deplorable strife in Cuba contin
ues without any marked change in the
relative advantages of the contending
forces. The insurrection continues, but
Spain has gained no superiority. Six
years of strife give the insurrection
prominence that cannot be denied. Its
duration and the tenacity of its adherents.
together with the absence of a manifeta
tion of the power of suppression on the
part oi fcpain, cannot be controverted.

to be able to announce the arrangements
of some of the important questions be
tween this government .and that of
Spain, but the negotiations have been
protracted. The unhappy intestine dis
sensions of Spain command our profound
sympathy and must be accepted as per
haps a cause of some delay. An early
settlement, in part, at least, oi , the
question between the governments is
hoped. In the meantime, awaiting the
results of immediately pending nego
tiations, I defer further and fuller com
munication on the subject of the relations
of this country and Spain.
NATURALIZATION AND EXPATRIATION.
I have again to call the attention of
Congress to the unsatisfactory condition
of the existing laws with reference to
expatriation and the election of nation
ality, i Formerly, amid conflicting opin
ions and decisions, it was difficult ex
actly to determine how far the doctrine
of perpetual allegiance was applicable to
fcitizens of the United States. Congress
by the act of July 27th,' 1868, asserted
the
fundamental principal of this govern
ment. Notwithstanding this assertion
and the necessity of frequent applica
tion of the principle, no legislation has
been had .dhiimg what acts or formali
ties shall work expatritation, or when a
citizen shall be deemed to have re
nounced oTto have lost his citizenship
The importance of such a lefination is'
obvious. - Thd representatives of - the
United States in foreign countries ore
continually called upon to lend their aid
and the protection of the United States
to persons concerning the good faith or
the. reality xjf whosa citizenship there is
.t least great question, in same cases

cussion. iiegisinnon on tnese anu simi'
lai questions, and particularly defining
when and under what circumstances ex
natriation can be accomplished, or is to

this connection; I earnestly call the at
tentioii of Congress .to the difficulties
arising from . fraudulent natirralization.
The United States wisely, freelv, and
Hberally offers its citizenship to all who
may come in good faith' to reside within
itahmila, on. their complying .with cer
tain prescribed reasonable .and simple
formalities and .conditions. .AmonR the
'highest duties of .the government is that
Car& should be
a right, carrying with it, such
support from the Kovernment should not
be fraudulently obtained, and snouid be
bestowed only upon full proof of a com
pliance with the Jaw. There have been
frequent instances of illegal and fraudu
lent naturalization and of the unauthor:
teed use of certificates thus improperly
obtained. '-In some casea the fraudulent
chaiiacter; ot tlie natiiralization has ap
