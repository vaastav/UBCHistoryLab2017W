A LEGISLATIVE JOURNAL.
The H'llsboro Banner advocates the
plan ol the legislature providing for the
ily publication of its journal of pro
ceedmgs for the purpose of furnishing
the people information as to what their
representatives are doing. The Grand
Forks Herald endorses the plan with the
quaiidua ion thai the report be concise
and the reservation lhtt the speeches of
members »e elimin .ted. The Alert wauld
say that it does not all in with tho idea
or plan in any respect. We do not think
it uecessary in thi« age of newspaper en
terprise. There is no doubt but that the
newspapers in smarclt will of theirown
accord and enterprise furnish better
ports of the proceedings than any official
publication would be, and in every respect
as correct. Wo are not in favor of the
territorial legislature enteriug into com­
petition in the publishing business with
the newspapers at Ltisrnarck, nor do we
favor paying one of those newspapers a
bonus irom the public lunds for publish
lag an "official report" when they will
furnish a better one upon their own re­
sponsibility and from their own resour
ces. Such a pu licalion if furnished gra­
tuitously oilier than being paid for ut of
the peoule's treasury, should bo sent to
every citizen of the territory. There
would be no rights ol discrimination in
favoi of one ai.d against anotuer in its
distribution. If a subscription price were
demanded then tli", people wouM prefer
to subscribe for the Tribune or Journal,
cach of which will contain a goou repori
of the proceedings and other news matter
besides.
THE FOSTER tOUNJV EMBROKLIO.
The voting precinct of Hellw iff in Fos
ter county seems to be responsible lor the
wrtngle in the county seal question to
sucti an extent that the county enmmis
sioners would be justified in revising '.lie
name by dropping tie "wig" syllable.
Such a change might not accord with tbe
popular idea of euphony but its a| pro
prialeness would be too apparent to ad­
mit of discussion. The only fault we
have to find with the old boaid of com­
missioners is the luck of forethought in
naming thai precinct. They ought to
have foreseen that a name compounded
'»f a place which offers no inducements
to immigration and a hirsuto appendage
winch even church detcons reject would
sometime raise he—il in the county, as it
dii'. the first opportunity. The usually
urlane and candid Hays, of the New
Rock ford Transcript, exhausted the vo
cabtlary of billingsgate the first issue af­
ter the official count upon the canvassers,
and'he imperturbably meek Wjard, of
the Carringt News, after having turn­
ed the other cheek also shows signs of
putting on the gloves, metaphorically
speaktiir, and going into the ring
The facts seem to be that after waiting
the ful. time allowed by tbe statute the
canvassing board proceeded according to
law to oake the official canvass of all the
returas that had been made, which in«

cinct, county or slate to ne.'lect to hold
an election, therefore, in the ab-ence of
any legal evidence or notice that an elec­
tion lias been held tne canvassing board
miiy legally presume neglect to hold an
election. The neglect of a political priv
liege may be presumed but a crime or an
unlawful act cannot. VVe think it a well
stttled principle of law that a person fail­
ing to exercise a political right or privi
le^e is presumed to have waived it. It
would be an unlawful net and a crim to
prevent a perstn legally entitled to vote
trom exercising that political privilege
but it ii not on unlawful act or crime for
him to neglect or refuse to vote. The
tme principle would apply to 'in aggre­
gation of legal voters.
If the people of Hellwig precinct held

and no return was made, as il is asserted
lucre was not, tiien^tiie fault must be
siinewlicre between tho two extremes,
between the poll and the county cierk,

to convey the returns to the county clerk
to explain, for the law holds him respon­
sible for the delivery of the certified re­

no interest in the matter farther than it is
a subject of general interest under a iaw
applicable to every county in the territory
with reference to elections and a circum­
stance that may occur in any county.
THOROUGHLY 00 OF POLITICS.
Perhaps no person on ihe continent is
more provoked or more sincerely regrets
the quaint alii iration "Hum, Iiomanism
and Rebellion," ttian the Rev. Burchard
himself w'ho ave utterance to it. That
il was none innocently on his part there
can be no doubt, but that does not repair
the damage. Those four ingeniously ar­
ranged words blasted the hopes of Blaine's
fe and the object to which he has been
working for mote than a quarter of a
century. This of itself is a source of in
expressible regret to the aged minister
who i3 said to be a man of very sympa
tUetic nature. He is seventy-two years of
age and has been a minister lor fitly
yeais, during which ministry he has al­
ways sua aint-d very pleasant and frater­
nal relations with the Catholic church.
In Ms usual sermons or upon an ordinary
occasion he might have said the same
thing and no one would ever have th »ught
any more about it, but in this casu it was
heralded from one side of the continent to
the other almost before the sound of his
voice in which it was expressed iiedout.
In one breath be made himself immortal
in the 1 itical history of the country for
the consequences that followed, but an
immortality that will be "he banc of his
lifu. He is more an object of pity than
of cons.ire, and for humanity's sake the
papers ought to let up on him. His own
mortification is punishment enough and
any additional -ir pes laid upon him
is persecution and savage vengeance.
It ib very correctly estimated that this
little combination of four words turned
15,000 votes in New Tork state from
Blaine to Cleveland in effect defeated
Blaine and elected Cleveland put 100.
000 fede al office holders out of a job and
consequently made lnm 100,000 implaca­
ble enemies ylio will curse hiin as long
they live, and jet not one of them as
unselfishly and honestly desired the sue
cess of Mr. IJIaine as he. All who were
not pecuniarily interested in the election
of Mr Blaine will soon come to look up­
on and laugh over this singular and lu
crous affair as a joKe, and ttie sooner
tbe ettei for all concerned. To com­
plete the joke Cleveland ought to appoint
Rev. Burciiard minister to Rome. He
would no doubt be glad of any mission
that would take him away from the im
mediate surroundings that keep alive anil
deepen bis mortification and unutterable
chagrin. There is no danger of him ever
taking part in another presidential cam­
paign. There is nut another man in
America so thoroughly and eternally oui
ot poi'tics as Rev Burciiard.
A REVIVAL OF THE FO IDLE AD*
MISSION LUNACY.

em her elect to the territorial couucil,
Hon, A. S. Jones, of Hutchinson county,
if correctly reported, takes the ground
that the question o: division and admis
sion "is left to thepeoplcof the territory,
through their representatives In the leg­
islature, to decide fr themselves, since it
cannot be expected that a nation with a
democratic bead will take the initiative
Btcp," etc He furthe'snys "The most
important step, and the very first one the
coming legislature should take, should
be to pass tiill calling a constitutional
convention, at which a constitution
should be framed for that part of Dakota
lying south of the 46ih parallel, and a
state government be formed, complete in
all its functions. Then, with her duty
authorized and accredited representatives
she couid go bravely up to the do-*r of
tbe union and knock, as did the state of
Michigan, and the door would be opened
unto us."
About a year and a half ago some ex
tremiats in South Dakota started out nn
der the lead-rship of United States Iis
trict Attorney Hugh J. Campbell and
with tho motto "Fe«r God and take your
own pari" to set up a state government
for that section of the territory, which 1«
to a constitutional convention being held
at Sioux Falls in September, 1883, and
the formation and adoption of a con­
stitution. Among the delegates to that
conven'ion from llulhinson county ap
p«ars the name of A. Sheridan Jones,
who is presumptively the name person as
A. S. Jones, member elect of the council
from that county.
When the lime for the convention came
their enthusiasm had cooled down so that
they concluded not to elcct a set of state
officers in advance of r.dmission, hold
their own courts and throw Uniled States
marshals into jail. They cor. tented them­
selves with forming a constitution and
asking admission into the union. The
constitution was formulated and present
ed to congress last wmier and possibly
now might be found in a pigeon hole ol
some committee room if it has not been
used for lighting cigars. Congress ig­
nored it with silent contempt, and in view
of this past and recent experience of Mr.
Jones in enfoicing admission into the
uiion it is a lit le surprising that he
should give expression to sucb sentiments
on the subject as those quoted atove.
The questions involved and settled in
the admission of Nebraska in 1S6G-7 set­
tles beyond reasonable controversy the
questions so persistently raised and re­
peatedly disputed by the IIra advocates
of enforcing the admission of Dakota oi
any pari of it into the union, as shown ny
Judge Snannon in his reply to Mr Camp­
bell, and were it not that ths came from
a member elect to the highest legislative
body in the territory il would hardly be
necessary to combat tho proposit ion.
In tbe discussion of the question of ad­
mitting Nenraska into tbe union the illu-
Irioussenalor from Massachusetts, Charles
Sumner, said "Nobody doubts that con
uress, in providing for the formation of a
constitution may affix conditions. This
has been done from tin. beginning of our
history. There is no instance where il
has been omitted. They are in your stat­
ute book, constant witnesses to the power
of congress, unquestioned and unques­
tionable.
Ou the same subject senator EdmunJs,
one of the most profound constitutional
lawyers of the age and nation, made the
br ii ami sweeping declaration: "We
have aright to create stales we have a
right totovern territories we have 41
rigut to sweep llieiri away."
In a decision of the supreme court ot
thestateof Nebraska upon political rights
claimed under t'ie constitution alter its
adoption and before the state was admit
ted by congress into the union the court
asserts ihe self-evident proposition that
"a state and territorial government could
not possibly exist at one and tho same
time" Further, "What we choose to
cull a state constitution was, at most, a
proposed instrument, and of no more
force until admission than blank pirch
ment Those who had been chosen state
officers had no offices to fill, and were
private citizens, governed by the laws
and officers of the territory." Still fur
ther the court says in this dicisioi: "The
legislature of the territory owes its exist­
ence to the organic act of congress, pas­
sed in 1S54, which empowers it to legislate
upon all rightful subjects of legislation.
To undertake to subvert the very gov
eminent under which it assembles and
acts is not a righttul subject or legisla
lion on the contrary, it is revolutionary."
Tbe court also quotes tbe following from
an opinion of the attorney general of the
United States on thi3 subject. "Terri
torial legislatures cannot, without permis
sion from congress, pass laws authorizing
the form ition ot constitutions and stati
governments. All measures commenced
and prosecuted with a design to subvert
the territoiial government, without ihi
consent of congress, are uulawful."
The mistaacn idea that Michigan fore
ed her admission into the union, an idea
which originated with Hugh J. Camp­
bell anil was by him disseminated among
the 1t ople of south Dakota, has serious!}
misled the pe pie upon the subject.
Michigan's pretentions to statehood wer«
never recognized by congress. Although
it occurred when the idea and dectrine of
slates rights were at tie zenith under tbe
powerful advocacy of John C. Calhoun,
even that illustrious "nullifier" of ihe
la,u-s and rejecter of the sovereign powers
of the national government ould not
swallowsuch nullification as that assumed
iiy the usurping stale government ot
Michigan, and he voted againsi receiving
a petition purporting to have come from
the state legislature because "io teceive
the petition would amount to a recogni­
tion of Michigan as a state," in which he
was sup iorted by Uamel A'ebster, Henry
Clay, John J. Crittenden, and other illus­
trious senators.
The proposition of councilman elect
Jones, is therefore in defianceof theopin
ion of the above named men as also that
of Sumner and Edmunds, the supreme
court of Nebraska and the attorney gen
tral of the United States. The matter of
formu.g a state constitution is one wh'ch
the territorial legislature has no power to
authorize or control. It has no power to
sty who shall torm such constitution nor
todetine tne qualifications which will le
gaily entitle a penton to vote upon the

By joint reaction the legislature might

than this l^nnterference in the mallei
would prejudice rather than ai 1 divisi .n

A COLD DAY FOR IHE PROHIBI­
TIONISTS.
A meeting of all tbe temperance organ­
izations in Dakota is called to be held at
Uuron the 17tn and 18th of this monlh,
the object of which is stated to be to ma­
ture plans of operation to secure legisla­
tive and congressional legislation thin
winter. SucL plans are also being made
in all parts of the country. The coming
winter will prob ib be the coldest on*
the prohibitionists ave ever experienced.
Its advocates liavo alienated the sympa­
thy and assistance of the republican pat
ty by running a candidate at the recent
election against the tears and entreaties
of the republican party managers, who
look up.^n the defeat of Mr Blaine as
mainly resulting fiom the waste of other­
wise republican ballots upon St. John.
In view of the past presidential cam­
paign it would be like adding iosult to
injury for the prohibitionists to ask the
republican members of legislative bodies
to help ttiem. The republican party has
been coqueting with the prohibitionists
lor several years, and with the well known
heartlessness of the coquet the prohibi­
tionists "went back" on the lepubhcacs
at a time when of all others it hurt the
wofrst.
In this ma'ter there is but one of two
courses to pursue in the futnre, either for
the republicans to allow themselves to be
swallowed up by the prohibition pan or
forever divorce themselves from it. There
is no sympathy or affinity between the
prohibitionists and the democratic party,
lor opposition to sumptuary laws is the
chief corner stone of the democratic par­
ty. There is no danger an affiliation
between these to parties until "ihe lion
and the lamb shall lie down together,"
and the delicate question for the republi­
can party to con-ider is whether to make
war upoii the piohibition party or make
an ally of it. 1'he question is not which
Lorn of the dilemma is best to uctept but
which is the worst to avoid.

The Question of Per cent,
A few weeks ago Rev. S.N. Griffith
delivered a lecture al the Bnptist Chapel
on tbt subject of interest in which be em­
braced a wide range iu the domain o: per
cenlage and to .«ome points in the latter
the Alert took issue with lnm. Since
that time some person over the nom de
plume of"* has been firing back
at us through the colums of the Capital.
Last week we dismissed the subject with
a paragrapn, as it is too long range to con
testa position witti a person who en
trenches himself among the stars, and es­
pecially the fixed stars as these seem to
be. Were it not that this is an important
as well as an interesting question we
should give it no further attention.
Hut we propose uow to bring our dis
putant within a reasonable range, biing
him down to earth, smoke him out as it
were. For this purpose we shall take tin
conditional aim of the hunter WHO, UL
certain as to the character of his game,
fired with the desire to hit if it was a
deer and miss if it was a ealf. We will
therefore assun.e that the writer of the
artie'es referred to is none other than the
Rev. Griffith hiin»elf. As a rule we do
)t discuss questions with a petsen in
ambush. There arc two -od teasons for
this. One is we might catch a tartar and
ti.e other is that when wc take the trouble
to corner our adversary we want the pub­
lic to know wno ne is.
In his first article the writer sub­
stantial}' concedes nearly everyr point of
objection we raised except that of per
cent per annum, an mils that he did not
have Mr. Blame's statistics when prepar­
ing tbe lecture, also admits the correct­
ness of Mr. Blaine's gold basis by adopt
ing it, arrives at the same aggregates of
valuation that we did and at substantially
the same per cent of increase for the de­
cade ending 1880, the increase in Con­
necticut being 5 6 per cent and in Min­
nesota 334 per cent. The former he says
is 2 3 per cent per annum and the latter
15 77 per cent per annum. We obtained
the rate per annum by dividing the ag­
gregate by 10, or removing the d« cimal
point one digit to the left which brings
the same result, namely, 2 56 per cent per
annum increase for Connecticut and S3.4
for ilinesota.
This mode of obiai.iing the rate per
cent per annum Mr. Griffith (assuming
that be is a deer) says is not correct and
he calls in his table of logarithms to prove
at it is a a in
terest on the brain and applies lbat rule
to all his calculations involving per cent
age. He seems to ignore tbe distinction
between interest and percentage. He is
making it an abtruse question involving
equations and logarithms where only the
simple rules of arithmetic are required.
Who ever heard of compound percentage,
compound percent of increase in weultb,
compi.un'd per cent o' increase in popula­
tion The theoretical rule for compound
interest does not apply to this question at
all. In this case there is no more author­
ity for compounding the per cent of in­
crease from year to year thun from monlh
to month and from day to day.
Cumpound interest is only a theory and
does not enter into practical and legiti­
mate business transactions. It is an out­
law in the society of business and can
only be obtained by circumventing the
Uw.
Suppose A lends $100 and takes his"
note due one year after date bearing in­
terest at ten per cent. Suppose neither
principal nor interest is paid for seven
years and one hundred days, how much
would th.n be due, principal aud inter­
est Jlr. Griffith would say $200, but
there is not a court between tilt- two
oceans that would sustain uim in such a
computation. Ten per cent on the $100
principal for each year and at that rate
for the fractional part of a year is all that
any court wou aliow Mr. Sbylock on
the note, and if the legal rate of interest
in the state where such a transaction was
had was ten per cent the attempt to com­
pound the interest would be usury. The
courts have uniformly set down on com
pound interest.
Tbe following proposition is given in a
separate art cle and we imagine by the
same erson to whom we have dsvoted
tbe preceding port'on of this article
A gentleman interested in the present
discussion of per cent, hands us tbe fol
lowing: If a man's money douoles in
ten years what per cent per annum is be­
getting Ten per cent? No. A little
ovei seven per cent: e. g., !og 2 301030,
div. by 10=* .030103 cor. num. 10717. If
a man's money doubles in ten years it is
100 per cent, for ten years, but "only .0717
per cent, each year.
Well, at first glance that appears to be
a stunner. We accept tbe proposition
without objection but deny the correct­
ness of the demonstration. Our friend
should remember timt in no proposition
id compound interest to be implied or un
derstood. To be considered it must be
expressed. Simple interest is tne rule and
compound interest the exception, and we
think our mathematical friend will agree
with us that the ru'.e is always to be fol
lowed unless otherwise expressed in the
proposition. Therefore when thequ
tion is asked "It a man's money doubles
in ten years what per cent per annum is
he getting?" the correct answer is "ten
percent," *nd not "a little oyer seven
per cent," because the iatter would be ap­
plying tbe rule for compound interest
wnere there is no authority for it If 'be
question were asked, "If a man's money
doubles in ten years at compound interest
what per cent per annum is he getting?"
the answer ht gives would be correct.

Well, noxv, Mr. Alvin Hildretb, Yank­
ton, D. T., the only reason your sugges
tiou docs not paralyze us is that it is old.
If you imagine this is new the question
suggests itself, Where Have you been the
last several yiars? If you have just come
iuto the territory you arc a little lresh in
assuming to give anew name to that part
of it which has given Dakota all thefi»me
it has or ever had. You have detached
with your incisors more than you can
masticate, Mr. Alvin Hildn th, Yankton,
D. T. You are laboring under a pie
sumption. You are trying to wag the
dog with the tail trying to bore an auger
hole with a gimlet. You should reflect
on the uncertainty of a sure thing. Da­
kota is good enough name for us. For
your sectioc. how would Confederation of
Cow Counties do, eh
The Dakota Legislature.
