Thl 1 a mutter to which I w ill Spain advert
Immediately associated with the financial
subject dicuscd In thi Important question
what legislation is netile.1 rewrardlnir tho na
tional currency? Tho ainrrcicutc amount of
lKin.1 now on deposit In the Treasury to sup
port the National Hank circulation is alout
.l'i.im,n.i. Neurly f Jii.imo.iKi of thi amount
consists of three iter cent, w hich. a already
stated. aro.pHyablo at the pleasure of tho liov
ernmont. and are likely tn In- called in w ithin
loss than four year, unles meantime the
surplus revenues shall bo diminished. Tho
probable effect or such an extensive retire
ment of securities, which urc the basis of the
National Hank circulation, would be such a
contraction of the volume of the currency as
to produce vrave commercial embarrass
ment. How can the danirer he obviated?
Tho mist effectual plan ami one whono adop
tion at th curliest practicable oportunity. I
shall heartily approve, has already tx-en in
dicated, ir tho revenues of the next four
years shall lo kept substantially commensu
rate with the expenses, tho volume of circula
tion will not Ik- likely to suffer any material
disturbance, but on tho other hand, inhere
shall tc irreat delay in roducimrtaxation.it
will iM-oome neccyary cither to substitute
some ot her form of currency In place or Na
tional liank notes, or to make important
changes in the laws by whlbh their circulation
is now controlled. In my Judjrment.the latter
course Is far preferable. I commend to yonr
attention tho very interesting and thought rul
fuirjrestions on this subject which apiear in
tho Secretary's report- The objections which
he urres a-int the acceptance of any other
aecurltle than tho obligation of the Govern
ment Itself a a foundation for National Hank
circulation seem to ino insuperable. For
avertlnr the threatened contraction two
course haTe been sua-rovicd. either or which
I probably feasible. One 1 the isuance of
now bon.t hvlnr many rear to run. hcarina
a low rate of interest ami exchangeable upon
spectned terms for those now outstanding- The
other couro which commends Itself to my
own judg-inent as the better one Is the enact
ment ofa law orohihltlnsr the tax on circula
tion and permittlnir the bank to issue notes
for an amount equal to ninety per cent, of tho
market value Instead of ag now the face value
ofiheir deposited bond. I ajrroe with tho
Secretary in the belief that the adoption of
this plan would afford the necessary relief.
Tho trade dollar, col nisi for the purpose of
trsfhc in countries wbesktlver pasM-d at it

to embarrass our currency system. 1 recom
mend that provision fortheir reception by the
treasury and mint as bullion at small per
centaire abore the current market price of

Th", octetary of the Treasury advised a
consolidation of certain of the customs dis

the collection of Internal revenue by section
3141 of the Kerlsed Statutes, The statistics on
this subject which are contained in bis report

as an Important measure of defense. The

of an interior coast line of water ways across

Kiver and throurh C'iiih; Cod. I feel bound
to impress upon the attention of Congress tho
necessity of continued protrrcss in the recon
struction of the navy. The condition of the
public Treasury, a 1 have already intimated,
makes the present an uuspicious time for put
tinif this branch of service in a state of effi
ciency. It is is no part of our Hliey to create
ami maintain a navy able to coe with that of
the other Kreat powers of the world. We
have no wish for foreign conquest, and the
peace which we have lonjr enjoyed Is in no
seeminr danjrer of interruption, but that our
naval strength should Iks made itdoqate lor
tho defense! of our harbors, the protection of
our commercial interests and the niaiutotmnce
of our national honor, is a proposition from
which no patriotic citizen can withhold his
assent.
THE roST-OrFCK DEPARTMENT.
The report of the I'ostmastcr-tieneral con
tains a rratitying exhibit of the condition and
prospects or tho interestinr branch of the
public service committed to his cure. It ap
pears that on June . issi, the whole numlier
of post-offices was 47,Ni:i, of w hich l.fKU were
estublislioil during the previous fiscal year.
The numlier of offices oHTHting- under
tho system of free delivery was 154. At
theso latter offices the post aire 011 local
mutter amounted to $4.1'.Ci,siO...2, a sum ex
cecdinr by ? l.tKl.mi.lll, the cutirecost of tho
carrier service of the country. The rate of
postaroondrop letters passing throurh these
offices is now fixed bv law ttt two cents iM-r
half ounce or fraction thereof, lnofliees where
the carrier systf 111 has not been established,
the rate is one-half as larre. It w ill bo re
membered that in lSTkl, when free delivery was
first established bylaw, the uniform tdnple
rate postnre upon hn al letters was fine cent,
and so it remained till 17:!, when in those
cities where carrier service was established it
was increased in order to defray the expense
or such service. It seems to ine that the old
rate may now with propriety be restored, and
that, too, even nt the risk of diminishing, for
a time at least, Hie receipts from posture Unn
local letter. I can see no reason why that
purticular class of mail matter should Ikj held
accountable for the wntirc cost, of not only
itown collection and delivery, but the col
lection and delivery of ail other classes, and I
am confident, after full consideration of the
subjoct.that the reduction of the rate would bo
followed by sucli a rrow inr accession of busi
ness as to "occasion but slight and temporary
loss to the revenues of the post-office.
POSTAL Ti:i.K2R Al-HS.
The rostniastor-ticneral devotes much of
his report to the consideration, in Its various
aspects, of the relation or the Government to
the telerraph. Such reflection as I have liecn
utile to rive to this subject since mv lust nn
mini messare lias not led me to change the
view which 1 then expressed in dissontinr
from the recommendation of tho Postmaster
ticnernl, thnt the Government assume the
same control over the telcrruph which it has
always exorcised over the mall. Admitting
that its authority in the premises is as ample
as hu been claimed tnr it, it would not. in iny
judrmcnt, U; a wise use of that authority to
purchase or assume the control of existinr
telerraph lines, or to construct others with a
view ot enterinr into a rcncral competition
with private enterprise. Tho objections
which may le justly urred artiinst cither of
these projects, and. indeed, nrainst any sys
tem which would require un enormous in
crease in the civil service list, do not, how
ever, apply to some of the plans which have
lately provokiil public comment and iliscus
sion. It has bi-en claimed, for example, that
Conrress mlrht wisely authorize the Postmaster-General
to contract with some private per
sons or corporations tor tho transmission of
messares at sjiecltied rates uiid under
Government supervision. Various Mich
schemes or the samo rcncral nature, but wide
ly difierinr in their fuweial characteristics,
have la-en surretel m the publics prims,
and the nrruments by which they havo boon
supported und opposed have doubtless at
tracted you f tnent ion. It is likely that tho
whole subject will bo considered by you nt tho.
present session. In the nature of thinrs
it involves so many questions r detail that
your deliberation would probably be aided
sliirhtly, ir at all, by any particular surrostioii
winch 1 now submit. 1 avow my belief, how
ever, that the Government shallbe nuthori.od
by law to exorcise some sort of sujwrvision
over iuter-state telerraph communication,
and I express the hope that for nttaininir that
end, some measure may In: devised which will
receive your approbation.

The Artornoy-lieneral criticises in his report
the provisions of the existinr law tlxinr tho
fees of Jurors and w itnesses in the Foderal
Courts. These provisions are chictiv con
tained in the act of February 2ti. 1X), t'hourh
some of them were introduced into that net
fnun statutes which had been passed many
years previous. It is manifest that such com
lensaiion us mlrht. when thete laws were en
acted, have been just and reasojiahle would,
in many Instances, be Justly n rarde.1 at the
present day as inadequate. I concur with the
Attorney-General, in the llior that the stat
utes should lie revisiil bv which these fees are
reruluto.1: so. too, or District Attorneys and
Murshuls. They should bo paid wholly by sala
ries, instead of in part bv lees, as is now the
case. The chanre woulii prove to le a meas
ure of economy, ami would discourare the
institution of needless und oppressive legal
proceedinrs. w hich it is to tie feared have in
some instances been conducted for the mere
sake of personal ruin.
" , THK INTKUIIMI DEPARTMENT.
Much intorestinr and varied information I
contained in the rcort of the Secretary of
the Interior. I particularly cull your atten
tion to his presentation of certain phastsof
the Indiun.questlon; to his rocommenduoions
for the repeal of the pre-emption andtitnlx-r
culture acts, and for more strinront lerisia
t ion to prevent frauds under the pension laws.
I have previously referred to the nlarminr
stnte or illiteracy in certain portions of tho

Tho l tah Commission hits submitted to the
secretary or tho Interior its second annual re
port. Asa result of it la I -us In supervisor
the recent election in tho Territory pursuant
to the act of March !,1.S2, it appears that the
person by thaj act di.squuliflcd.to the numt r
, about LI.(W. were exclml.-d from the polls,
ibis fact, however, afford little cause for
oonrrat ulation, and I fear that it i far from
indicatinr any real and substantial proms
toward the extirpation of polygamy. All of
tho members of the Legislature are Mormons
and there is rrave reason to believe that they
are in sympathy with the practices that this
(iovornmont is seeking to suppress, and that
Its efforts in that rcrard will be more likely to
encounter their opposition than to receive
their encouragement and support. Even If
this view aboiili happily be erroneous, the
law under which the Commissioner have
teen acting should Ik? mude more effective by
the Incorporation of some such stringent
measures as they recommended and were in
cluded in bill No. TW on the calendar of the
Senate at Its last m-ssion. I am convinced,
however, that polyramy has become so
ftronrly intrenched in the Territory of Utah
that it Is profitless to attack with anv but the
stoutest weapons which constitutional legisla
tion can fashion. I favor, then fore, the re
peal of the act. I'pon tho existing Govern
ment depend the assumption by tho National
legislature of the entire political control of
the Territory and the establishment of a Com
mission with such power and duUes as shall
be delegated to it by law.

pursuit of general agriculture is only made
practicable by recourse to irrigation, while
successful irrigation is impossible without
the aid afforded by the forests In contributing
to the regularity and constancy of the supply
of waters. During the past year severe suf
fering and great loss of property have been
occasioned by profuse floods, followed by pe
riods or unusually low waters in many of the
great rivers of the country. These irregulari
ties were, in a great measure, caused by the
removal from about the sources of the
streams In question of the timlierby which
the water supply had been nourished and pro
tected. The preservation or such a portion of
such forest on the national domain as essen
tially contributed to the equable
flow of important water courses ia
of the highest consequence. Impor
tant tributaries of the Missouri, tho
Columbia and the Saskatchewan rise in the
mountains of Montana, near tho Northern
iKtundaryof the I'nitcd States, tet ween the
llluckfcct and Flathead Indian lleservations.
This region Is unsuitable for settlement, but
ii)on the rivers which tlow from it .Icociids in
the future agricultural development of a vast
tract or country. J lie attention or Congress is
called to the necessity of withdrawing from
public sale this part of the public domain and
establishing there a forest preserve.
INIirSTRIAL EXHIBITIONS.
The Industrial Exhibitions w hich have been
held in the United States during the present
year attracted attention in many foreign
countries, where tho announcements of these
enterprises had been made public through the
foreign agencies of the Government. The In
dustrial Exhibition at lioston, and the South
ern Exposition at Louisville, were largely
attended by the exhibitors of foreign coun
tries, notwithstanding the absence of any pro
fessional character in these undertakings.
The Centennial Exposition to be held next
year at New Orleans, in commemoration of
the first centenary of the first shipment of cot
ton from a port of the Tinted Suites bids fair
to meet with like gratifying success. Under
tho act or Congress of the 10th of Februarv,
isxj. declaring that Exposition to lie national
and international in its character, ull foreign
Governments with which the United States
maintains relations have been invited to par
ticipato. The promoters of the important
undertaking have already received assurance
of the lively interest w hich it excites abroad.
THE DISTRICT OK COLl'M BIA.
The report of the Commissioners of the Dis
trict of Columbia is herewith transmitted. I
ask for it your careful attention, especially
for those portions which relate to assessments
of urreai s of taxes and the water supply.
CIVIL SERVICE.
The Commissioners who were appointed
under the act of January IS, SJ, entitled "An
act to regulate and improve the civil service
of the United States," entered promptly upon
the discharge of these duties as soon us tho
rules framed in accordance with the spirit of
the statute were approved and promulgated
by the President. It will le observed 'that
they discountenance any political or religious
tests for admission to the pnbiio service to
which the stutute relates. The act is limited
in its original application to the classified
clerkships in the several Executive Depart
ments at Washington, numbering about u.OOU,
and similar positions in custom districts and
post-offices, where us many ns fifty persons
are employed. A classification of these posi
tions analagous to that existing in Washing
ton offices was duly made before tho law went
into effect. Eleven custom districts and
twenty-three iMist-ottices were thus brought
under the- immediate operation of the statute.
The annual report of the Civil Service Com
mission, which will soon lie submitted to Con
gress, will afford the means of a more definite
judgment than I am now prepared to express
as to the wants of the new system. I am per
suaded that its effects thus far have proved
iKMK'flciul. The practical methods appear to
lie adequute lor the ends proposed, and there
has la-en no serious difficulty in currving
them into effect. Since the Mth of July
lust, 110 iorsoii, so far ns 1 um aware,
has been appointd to the public ser
vice in the classified portions thereof
at any of tho departments or at any
of tho post-offices and custom districts above
nuincd. except those certified by tho Commis
sion to lie the most. coinM-tent on the basis
of tho examinations in conformity to the
rules.
THE PRESIDENTIAL SfCCESSION.
At tbo time when the present Executive en
tered upon his office, his ileuth, removal, res
ignation, or inability to perforin his duties
would have left tho Government without a
constitutional head. It is possilble. of course,
that a similar contingency may again arise,
unless tho wisdom of Congress shall provide
against its recurrence. The Senate at its last
session, after full consideration, passed an act
relating to this subject, which will now. 1
trust, commend itself totho approval of both
Houses of Congress. The clause of the Con
stitution upon which mil st depend any law
rcgulatinr the Presidential succession prv
scfits also for solution other quest ions of oar
amount importance. These questions rolutc
to the proK-r interpretation of the phrase,
"inability todischurge the powers and duties
of said office,' our orgunlc law providing
that when the President shall suffer from
such inability the Presidential office shall de
volve upon tli( Vice-President, who must him-'
self, under like circumstances, give place to
such officer as Congress may by law appoint
to act as President. 1 need not here
et forth the numerous and interest
ing inquiries winch are suggested by
tiieso wonlv of tho Constitution. They
were fully stated In my tlrst communica
tion to Congress, and have since been the sub
ject of frequent deliteration in thut body. It
is greuGy to le hotted that these momentous
questions will find some Seedy solution, lest
an emergency may arise when lonrer delay
will lie impossible, und any determination,
allieit the wisest, may furnish cause for
anxiety and alarm,
THE VETO POWER.
For the reasons fully stated In my last nn
nual message, I repeat my recommendation,
thut Congress propose an amendment to that
provision of theConstltution which prescribed
the formalities for the enactment f laws
whereby. In respect to bills for the appropria
tion of public money, the Executive may lie
enabled, while giving his approval to particu
lar items, to Interpose his veto a to such
others as do not commend themselves to his
jadgmcnt.

A Sinking Mountain.
One of the most extraonlinfirv of tho
many disturbances of rartls crust
which have occurrcfl ilurini; the last
two or three years is the sinking of the
Mountain of Naiba, in Algiers. This
mountain, which is, or wa.. about twice
as hih a. the Crow's Nest on the Hud
son, is said to be gradually descending
into the bosom of the earth, a deep ex
cavation being formed all around it as
it settles. There are several instances
on record of volcanic mountains having
risen out of the earth or the sea, and a
few of mountains which have sunk into
the earth. The Japanese hare a legend
that the great volcanic peak of Fusi
yama rose suddenly out of the earth,
and it is known that in 17o0 the volcano
of Jorullo, in Mexico, rose in one night
out of a cultivated plain. In 1881 there
was a similar occurrence in San Salva
dor, a volcanic hill rising suddenly out
of the middle of the Lake of Ilopango.
But, in these cases the phenomena of
the rising mountains were accompanied
by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
So the recent disappearance of 'volcanic
islands and the tnrustin tip through
the bottom of the sea of sixteen new
volcanoes near Java were the accompa
niments of a great convulsion of the
earth's crust. But the sinkim; of the
Algerian mountain, it appears, is not
ft r A. t Kp a t-t I-Ac anfl id nftl f Vi k I
result of aVolcanic eruption. The sub
terranean props of the mountain seem
to have given away under its weight,
and it is subsiding "into the ground. X.

It is a popular belief in some parts
of England that the lost body of a
drowned person may be found by setting
adrift a loaf of bread containing mer
cury." The loaf is supposed to float

lTHMC REPORTS..
Glances nt the Annual Statements of So.
retarlca Folger and Llacolu, and Poat
master-General Gresham,
TUB TEEA.SUK?.
Washixotox, Deo. 8. Tho report of
Secretary Folger for the fiscal year eading
June 30, 1SSS, will show that the total
revenue receipts for the year were $398,-2S7,5S-2;
expenditures, 408,133, leav
ing a surplus, revenue of $82,879,444.
This is 7,300,000 more than Mr.
Folger estimated that the surplus
would amount to in his last annual report
Compared with the previous fiscal year the
receipts for 1S33 have decreased 12,664,367.
The expenditures show an increaso over the
year before of S7,5'20,697. The expenditures
of the WarDcpartmeut increased 85,400,000;
for the Navy Department, 5250,000, and for
pensions nearly $5,000,000, while the inter
Cat on the public debt decreased almost
512,000,000.
Since the last annual report the act of
March S, diminished the sources of
internal revouue, and changed the tariff law
so that the estimate made a year ago must
be entirely'revised. Then the receipts ex
pected from Internal revenue were $145,
uoo.OoO. Now the estimated revenue is
SliiO. 000,0 00.
By the payment of $207,000,000 of the
public debt the charge for interest will be
greatly reduced. It Is probable that the re
ceipts will be about $350,000,000 for the
fiscal year 184, while the expenditures will
amount to 5205,000,000, leaving a surplus
ot $85,000,000 over and above the sinking
fund.
During the last fiscal year the bonds re
tired amounted to $134,009,750. Since then
$38,374,000 of three per cents have been
paid, and $40,000,000 more have been
called. Of this last sum, $5,000,000 has
been met already, and is included in tiro
$38,374,000.
The "Secretary will again call the atten
tion of Congress to the fact that the receipts
of thij-tiovenimcnt are greatly in excess of
its needs. The dangers of this large surplus
to tho money market will be dwelt upon,
nnd the Secretary will say that there is no
method of disbursing this surplus except by
payment of the public debt Payment of
the public debt, however, is now injurious
to the National banking system, and if
permitted to go on, even this year, as it lias
during the last fiscal year, tho existence of
a gixxt many National banks is threatened,
and this means a sensible contraction of tho
currency.
In discussing tlie mode of reducing the
revenues, the Secretary will oppose the
alxilition of tho internal revenue tax. He
will recommend a still further reduction of
customs duties, after a proper inquiry shall
have develoied what articles can beststaud
the reduction.

the number of postmasters appointed by the
President is 2,105. Tho expenditure
for clerk hire at New York and Chicago
is 18.2 per cent of the gross re

than is necessary. The relations of the

Story to the Ground They Are ricked

Fifty Other Badly Frightened Females
"Keneued by the Heroic Firemen.
CuicAf'o, Doc. The people upon the
upper floors of Nos. 163 and 170 Market
street near the center of the cast front of
that enormous structure, were driven almost
frantic at five o'clock Saturday afternoon by
a sight of 6moke slowly rolling through the
elevator shaft At that time there wero
about fifty women at work upon the fifth
and sixth floors. Every one of them at
once went crazy, and without any thought
began the most frantic efforts to escape.
in the first stampede every one escaped
from the upper floors but eight girls and
the foreman of the sixtli floor, who were cut
off from the elevator stairway by the smoke
and heat These nine people were in a
horrible trap, nnd the only escape was down
the iron ladder built upon the outside of the
Market-street front
After a wild dash toward the rear, the
nine assembled at the window that opened
out upon the fire-escape. By this time tho
alarm had been given and the firemen were
In the street below the panic-stricken girls.
Had they simply waited, all would hava
been well, but their wild terror forbade any
thing but action. Frances FairweaUier was
the first to venture upon the fire-escape,
leaving her most intimate friend, Kitty 1111
pert, standing in the open window, with all
the rest crowding bark of her. Just as Miss
Fairweather made the -first steps of her de
scent, her friend in the window let go het
hold upon the Iron ladder and leajicd straight
down from the window. The plunge was a
horrible one, and the poor girl's body
reached the earth head foremost, dashing
out her brains upon the stone sidewalk.
Frances Fairweatiier's eyes were turned up
ward when her companion made that wild
Jump. The sight completely unnerved her,
and in another second she, too, was kins;
crushed upon the cruel stone below. After
one horrified exclamation a strong fireman
raised the coqise of Kittie Hilgertfrom the
jiool of blood and brains about it, and carried
it to a place of safety. The same poor kind
ness was done for her companion, and the
firemen turned their attention to the other
seven people, part of whom were still at the
windows aliove and the rest making their
deseent The firemen quickly mounted to
their aid, and all were safely rescued. Tho
last two were taken from the smoke just In
side the window, and virtually carried
down the ladder. One of them was Annie
Ryan and the other wan Lizzie Fair
weather, whose sister had dropjed from
the ladder when Miss Hilgert made the in
sane leap. The two dead girls were inti
mate friends, having been almost constant
ly companions since childhood. The par
ents of both reside in Sheboygan, Wis.
During the first few moments of the fire
the crowd filled Market street in front of
the building. There was an immense
crowd present, and when a reinforcement
of police arrived they were crowded back
upon the wooden sidewalk opposite the fire.
The extra weight was too much, and about
twenty feet of the rotten structure fell down
to the old grade of the street No one was
hurt, but one or two ladies fainted when the
smash came.
A number of firemen were injured, but
none seriously. A short ladder was erected
at the foot of the fire escape, and one ot the
girls who came down dropped when she
reached the top of this ladder. Both she
and a member of Truck Company No. 8 had
a fall to the ground, but neither of them
were hurt This circumstance undoubtedly
saved the life of the young lady. The cause
of the fire is not definitely known. The
loss will reach In the neighborhood of S200,-
