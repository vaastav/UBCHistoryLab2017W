tn vlow of the reports which huvo

it wiso to propose to her niajesty's gov
Oi'mnent In Fobruary last that an agree
ment for a closed soasou should be made
I ending the negotiations for arbitra
tion, which then seemed to bo approach
ing a favorable conclusion.
In my last annual message I stated
that tho basis of arbitration proiosed by
her majesty's government for tho ad
justment of tho long pending contro
versy lis to tho seal fisheries was not ac
ceptable. I am glad now to be able to
announce that terms satisfactory to this
government havo been agreed upon,
and that an agreement as to the arbi
trators Is all that is nocessary to tho
completion of the convention.
AMKKICAN MEATS IS EUKOPE.
The law of the last concress provid
ing a system of inspection for our meats
intended for export, and clothing the
president with power to exclude for
eign products from our market in chso
the country sending them should per
petuate unjust discriminations against
any product of the United States, placed
this government in a position to effect
ively urge the remoyal of such discrim
inations against our meats It is grat
ifying to be ablo to state that (lormany,
lh!iitnark, Italy, Austria and trance, In
tho order named, have opened their
ports to Inspected American pork pro
ducts. Tho removal of these restrio-
tions in every instance was asked for
and given solely upon the ground that
wa had now provided a meat inspection
that should be accepted as adoqiliile to
the complete removal of the dangers,
real or fancied, which had been previ
ously urged. Tho state department,
our ministers abroad, and tho secretary
of agriculture, havo co-0erateil with
iinnagging ?eal for the accomplishment
of this great result. The outlines of an
agreement have been reached with Ger
many looking to equitable trade con
cessions in consideration of the free im
portation of her sugars, but the tone
lias not yet arrived when this corres
pondence can bo submitted to congress.
THE NEW OK LEANS LVNfHINl!.
The lynching at Now Orleans in
March last of eleven men of Italian na
tivity by a mob of citizens was a must
deplorable and discreditable incident.
It did not. however, have its origin in
any general animosity to the Italian
people, nor any disrespect to tne gov
eminent of Italy, with which relations 1 public order,
were of tho most friendly character. The Chinese governm-nt lias declined
The fury of tho mob was directed i to roc dvo Mr. lilaii' as the minister of
against these men us tlio supposed par- j the United States, on tlio ground that,
ticipar.ts or accessories on (ho murder j as a participant while a eetiator in thu
of a city officer. 1 do not allude to this enactment of the oxUtin; legislation
as mitigating in any degree this offense j against tho introduction of Chinese la
against law and humanity, but only as borers, ho has Is-eonie imfi-i- mlly and
atleeting tho International questions ;
which grew out ol it.
It was onco represented by tho Italian
minister that several of the men killed
were Italian subjects, and a demand
was mado for tho punishment of the 1
participants and for an indemnity to the (
families of tboso who were killed. It is
to bo regretted that the munner in j
which these claims were presented
were not such as to promote a calm
discussion of the question involved; but
1111s may wen uo aiiriouu-u uj ine ex
citement and indignation which the
crime naturally evoked. The views of
this government as to its obligations to
foreigners domiciled here were fully
stated in the correspondence, us well as
its purpose to make an investigation of
the affair, with a view lodetersuino the
obligations of tlio United States.
Some suggestions growing out of this
incident aro worthy the attention ot
congress. It would, I believe, be com
petent for congress to make offences
against the treaty rights of foreigners
domiciled here cognizuhlo in the feder
al courts. This hus not bocn done, and
tho federal officers and courts have no
power to intervene in such cases cither
for protection or puuishment. It seems
to me to follow then, that the officers of
(he state charged with olieo and ju li
cial lw.vors must bo regarded in such
sense as icuerui agenis, aim so m.ise
this government answerable for t heir
acts in cases where it would Is; answer-
utile if the United States had used iu
eoiis'llniioiial power to define and pun
ish crimes against treaty rights.
THE THOCHI.E WITH C'HlI.L
The civil war in Chili, which began
In January last, was continued, but for
tunately with infrequent and not I in
portant armed collisions, until August j
2t h, when tho congressional forces
landed near Valparaiso and, after a
bloody engagement, captured that city.
Uresident iialmHceda at once recog
nized that his cause was lost, ami pro
visional government was speedily es
tahlished by the victorious party. Our
minister was prompt.lv dirocted (o rec

The late outbreak against foreigners
In various parts of tho Chinese empire
bus been a cause of deep concern, in
view of tho numerous establishments of
our citi.er,!) in the interior of that coun
try. This government can do 110 les
than insist upon a continuance of the
protective and punitory measures w hich
tho Chinese government lias heretofore
applied. No effort will be omitted to
protect our citizens peaceably sojourn

mation Indicates that wliut was lirst re
garded as an outbreak of mob violence

larger form of a:i insurrection against

The general interest in the opera-

Tlio aldest advocates of free coinug.j

In their prediction that tho purchases

would at onco bring tlio price of silver

that licr.elioial remits upon trade and

think must 13 very clear to everyone;
nor should it lie forgotten that for eve

We could no, hope to maintain an equal-
ity in 1 ho purchasing power of the gold j
and silver dollar in our own market,
and abroad the slump gives no added
value to tin; bullion contained in coins,
The producers of the country have the
highest interest that every dollar, coin
or paper, issued by the government,
shall boofcouul value. If there is one
worth less than other, its sure and cer
tain errand will lie to pay them for their
crops, products and toil.
The producers of silver are entitled
lo just consideration, but they should
not forget that the government is now
buying and putting out of the market
w hat is the equivalent of the entire
production of our silver mines, which
is much more (ban they themselves
thought of asking two vears ago.
The business of the world divides the
use of both metals, but I do not see any
prospect ot pain, and much of loss, by
giving up tho present system, in which
a full use is made of gold, and a large
us.; of silver, for one in w hich silver
alone will circulate. Such an event
would be al once fatal to the further

The presence of a large cash surplus
In tho treasury has for yearn been the
subject of unfavorable criticism, and
furnished an argument to those who de

KKEE MAU, DELIVERY.
Right thousand miUii of new postal
service has boon established iiion rail
roads, the car distribution to sub-stations
in the great cities has been in
creased about 12 per cent, while the
percentage of errors in distribution has
111 thu past yeur been reduced over one
half. An appropriation was mado for
the purpose of experimenting on free
delivery in the smaller cities und towns.
The results of these experiments have
been so satisfactory that the postmaster
general recommends, and I concur in
the recommendation, that the free de
livery system be entended to towns of
."i,000 populutiiiu. Mis discussion of tlio
inadequate facilities extended under our
present system lo rural communities,
und his suggestion lo give theso com
munities u fuller participation in the
lienetits of the postal service are worthy
of your careful consideration. It is not
just, that the farmer who receives his
mail ul the neighboring tow n should not
only lie compelled (o send to tlio st
office for ft, but to pay it considerable
rent for a box In which to place it. or
wait his lime at a general delivery win
dow, wliile the city resident has his
mail brought to his door, it is slated
that over o4,iHK) neighborhoods are, un
der the present system, receiving mail
lit postolliccs where money orders und
postal notes are not issued. The exten
sion of this system to these communi
ties is especially desirable, a loo pat
rons of such ofliccs are not possessed of
the other facilities otlored in more isip
ulous communities for the transmission
of small sums of mouey.
I have in a message to the preceding
congress, expressed my views as to 11
mollified use of the telegraph in connec
tion with tho postal service.

DEPARTMENT Of AliKK T I.TI RE.
H the establishment of the depart
ment of agriculture as regarded by anv
one as a mere concession 'o tho unen
lightened demands of a worthy class of
people, that impression has been most
effectually removed by the great re
sults already attained. Its home influ
ence has been very great in disseminat
ing agricultural and horticultural in
formation; in stimulating and direct
ing a further diversification of crops;
in detecting and eradicating diseases of
domestic animals: and more than all. in
the close and informal contact which it
has established and maintains with the
stx - k raisers ot the whold country.
r or t.-n years protests and iH'titions
iiHn this subject fiom the packers and
stoekraisers of the United States have
been directed against these restrichon
which so seriously limited our markets
and curtailed the profits of the farm. It
is a source of general congratulation
tha( success has at lust been attained,
for the effects of an enlarged foreign
market for these meats will be felt, not
the farmer. rot in our public
finances and in every branch of trade,
It is particularly fortunate that the in-
creassHl demand lor lood products re
ulting from the removal of the restric
(ions of our meats and from the reei
procial trade arrangements to w hich I
have referred should have come at a
lime when the agricultural surplus i
so largs. Without the help thus th
rived lower price wonUl have pro-
vailed. The secretarr of agriculture
estimates (ha( (he restrictions uiion the
importation of our (ork products into
Furope lost us a market for 2i). U"o,iliM
worth of these ensluc's annually.
The grain crop of tlos year was the
Inrgi t In our history. .V peroont grent-
'.- than last year, ami jet the market
that has been opened and tho larger dv
mand resulting from short croiis In r.u-
rope hare sustained price to Indian
extent that the enormous surplus of
meat and breadstiitfs will bo marketed
at good prices, bringing relief and pros
perity to an Industry that was luucn de
pressed. It Is not inappropriate, I
think, here to suggest that our satisfac
tion in the contemplation of this mar
v4 is addition to the nationul wealth
is unclouded by any suspicion of tho cur
rency by which it is measured and in
which the farmer is paid for tlio pro
duct of his llelds.
I Tlio president here endorses the
work of the civil service commission,
und urges legislation for the protection
of tho lives of railroad employes, and
thou takes up the proposed change in
the manner of electing the president.
This change he vigorously op(oses. on
tho ground that it would put the three
departments of the government at the
mercy of corrupt political methods,
lie declares (ha proposed change to be
a menace to the stability of tho govern
ment. He ud vi-es the uppoiul ment ol
a commission to consider the matter ol
the evils connected with tho election
system. I
To tho consideration of these very
grave questions I invite not only the
attention o! congress, but that of all
patriotic citizens.' We must not enter
lain the delusion thut our peoplo have
ceased to regard a free ballot and equal
representation as the priee of their ul
legiance to laws and to civil magis
trates. I have been greatly rejoiced to notice
many evidences of the increased linill
cation of our people und of a revived nu
tionul spirit. Tho vista that now oiens
lo us is wider und more glorious
than ever before. Crat ifcalion
and amazement struggle for supre
macy us we contemplate the population,
weaith und moral strength of our coun
try. A trust, inomenlouu in its influ
ence upon the world is for a brief time
committed to uts and we must not lie
faithless to its tirst condition the de
fence of the free and equal inlluence of
the eople in choice of public officers
and iu control of public affairs.
