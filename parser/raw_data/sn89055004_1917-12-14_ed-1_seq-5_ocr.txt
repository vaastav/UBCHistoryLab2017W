President Declares Our Sole Ob
ject Now Is to Win
the War.
UNITED TO GAIN VICTORY
Every Resource of the Nation Must
Be Co-ordinated in the One Object
to Pursue the War to Ultimate
and Complete Victory.
Washington, Dec. 4.—President Wil
son in his message to congress pledged
America to war to victory and asked
that Austria-Hungary be listed among
America's enemies to remove this "em
barrassing obstacle that stands In our
way." The message follows:
"Gentlemen of the Congress—Bight
months have elapsed since I last had
the honor of addressing you. They
have been months crowded with events
of immense and grave significance for
us. I shall undertake to detail or even
to summarize these events. The prac
tical particulars of the part we have
played in them will be laid before you
in the reports of the executive depart
ments. I shall discuss only our pres
ent outlook upon these vast affairs,
our present duties, and the immediate
means of accomplishing the objects
we shall hold always in view.
"I shall not go back to debate the
causes of the war. The intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us
by the sinister masters of Germany
have long since become too grossly
obvious and odious to every true Amer
ican to need to be rehearsed. But I
shall ask you to consider again and
with a very grave scrutiny our objec
tives and the measures by which we
mean to attain them ; for the purpose
of discussion here in this place is ac
tion, and our action must move
straight towards definite ends.
Must Win the War.
"Our object is, of course, to win the
war; and we shall not slacken or suf
fer ourselves to be diverted until it is
won. But it is worth while asking and
answering the question: When shall
we consider the war won?
"From one point of view It is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
matter. I do not doubt that the Amer
ican people know what the war is
about and' what sort of an outcome
they will regard as a realization of
their purpose in it. As a nation we
are united In spirit and intention. I
pay little heed to those who tell me
otherwise. I hear the voices of dis
sent—who does not? I hear the criti
cism and the clamour of the noisy,
thoughtless and troublesome,
see men here and there fling them
selves in impotent disloyalty against
the calm, indomitable power of the na
tion. I hear men debate peace who
understand neither its nature nor the
way in which we obtain it with uplift
ed eyes and unbroken spirits. But I
known that none of these speaks for
the nation,
heart of anything. They may safely
be left to strut their uneasy hour and
be forgotten.
No Peace by Compromise.
"But from another point of view I
believe that it is necessary to say
plainly what we here at the seat of ac
tion consider the war to be for and
what part we mean to play in the set
tlement of its searching issues.
"We are the spokesmen of the Amer
ican people, and they have a right to
know whether their purpose is ours.
They desire peace by the overcoming
of evil, by the defeat once for all of
the sinister forces that interrupt
peace and render it impossible, and
they wish to know how closely our
thought runs with theirs, and what ac
tion we propose. They are impatient
with those who desire peace by any
sort of compromise—deeply and indig
nantly impatient—but they will be
equally impatient with us if we do not
make it plain to them what our ob
jectives are and what we are planning
for in seeking to make conquest of
peace by arms.
Menace Must Be Crushed.
"I believe that I speak for them
when I say two things : First, that
this intolerable thing of which the
masters of Germany have shown us
the ugly face, this menace of com
bined intrigue and force which we now
see so clearly as the German power,
a Thing without conscience or honor
or capacity for covenanted peace, must
be crushed and, if it is not utterly
brought to an end, at least shut out
from the friendly intercourse of the
nations ; and, second, when this Thing
and its power are indeed defeated and
the time comes that we can discuss
peace—when the German people have
spokesmen whose words we can be
lieve and when those spokesmen are
ready in the name of their people to
accept the common judgment of
the nations as to what shall hence
forth be the bases of law and of cov
it.

Washington. — The committee on

Inaugurated a new branch of its serv
ice, which is to serve as a bureau of
Information on all woman's war ac
tivities.
The new bureau Is acting as a Gen
eralized medium of communication be
enact for the life of Che world—we
shall be willing and glaj to pay thé
full price for peace, and pay It un
grudgingly. We know wh*t that price
will be. It will be full, impartial jus
tice—justice done at every point and
to every nation that the fcoal settle
ment must affect, our enemi *a as well
as our friends.
Final and Convincing Lesson.
"You catch with me, the voices of
humanity that are In the air. They
grow daily more audible, more articu
late, more persuasive, and they come
from the hearts of men everywhere.
They insist that the war shall not end
In vindictive action of any kind ; that
no nation or people shall be robbed or
punished because the irresponsible
rulers of a single country have them
selves done deep and damnable wrong.
It Is this thought that has been ex
pressed in the formula 'No annexa
tions, no contributions, no punitive In
demnities.' Just because this crude
formula expresses the Instinctive judg
ment as to right of plain men every
where, it has been made diligent use
of by the masters of German intrigue
to lead the people of Russia astray—
and the people of every country their
agents could reach, in order that a
premature peace might be brought
about before autocracy has been taught
its final and convincing lesson, and
the people of the world put In control
of their own destinies."
Right as the Arbiter.
"But the fact that a wrong use has
been made of a just idea is no reason
why a right use should not be made of
it. It ought to be brought under the
patronage of its real friends. Let it be
said again that autocracy must first be
shown the utter futility of its claims to
power or leadership in the modern
world. It is Impossible to apply any
standard of justice so long as such
forces are unchecked and undefeated
as the present masters of Germany
command. Not until this has been
done can Right be set up as arbiter
and peacemaker among the nations.
But when that has been done—as, God
willing, it assuredly will be—we shall
at last be free to do an unprecedented
thing, and this the time to avow our
purpose to do it. We shall be free to
base peace on generosity and justice,
to the exclusion of all selfish claims to
advantage even on the part of the vic
tors.
of
a
tors.
To Win War Our Present Task.
"Let there be no misunderstanding.
Our present and immediate task is to
win the war, and nothing shall turn us
aside from it until it is accomplished.
Every power and resource we possess,
whether of men, of money, or of ma
terials, is being devoted and will con
tinue to be devoted to that purpose
until it is achieved. Those who de
sire to bring peace about before that
purpose is achieved I counsel to carry
their advice elsewhere,
entertain it. W r e shall regard the war
as won only when the German people
say to us, through properly accredited
representatives, that they are ready to
agree to a settlement based upon jus
tice and the reparation of the wrongs
their rulers have done. They have
done a wrong to Belgium which must
be repaired. They have established a
power over other lands and people than
their own—over the great empire of
Austria-Hungary, other hitherto free
Balkan states, over Turkey, and within
Asia—which must be relinquished.
Must End German Autocracy.
"Germany's success by skill, by in
dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise,
did not grudge or oppose, but ad
mired, rather,
herself a real empire of trade and in
fluence, secured by the peace of the
world. We were content to abide the
rivalries of manufacture, science and
commerce that were involved for us in
her success and stand or fall as we
had or did not have the brains and the
initiative to surpass her. But at the
moment when she had conspicuously
won her triumphs of peace she threw
them away, to establish in their stead
what the world will no longer permit
to be established, military and political
domination by arms, by which to oust
where she could not excel the rivals
she most feared and hated. The peace
we make must remedy that wrong. It
must deliver the once fair lands and
happy peoples of Belgium and north
ern France from the Prussian conquest
and the Prussian menace, but It must
also deliver the peoples of Austria
Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans,
and the peoples of Turkey, alike in
Europe and in Asia, from the impudent
and alien dominion of the Prussian
military and commercial autocracy.
To Manage Their Own Affairs.
"We owe it, however, to ourselves to
say that we do not wish in any way to
impair or to re-arrange the Austro
Hungarian empire. It is no affair of
ours what they do with their own life,
either industrially or politically. We
do not purpose or desire to dictate to
them In any way. We only desire to
see that their affairs are left in their
own hands, in all matters,*great or
small. We shall hope to secure for the
peoples of the Balkan peninsula and
for the people of tlfe Turkish empire
the right and opportunity to make
their own lives safe; their own for
tunes secure against oppression or in
justice and free from the dictation of
foreign courts or parties.

trary to the principles we have pro
fessed to live by and to hold most
sacred throughout our life as a na
tion.
, .
"The wrongs the very deep wrongs,
German People Deceived.
"The people of Germany are being
told by the men whom they now per
mit to deceive them and to act as their
masters that they are fighting for the
very life and existence of their em
pire; a war of desperate self-defense
against deliberate aggression. Nothing
could be more grossly or wantonly
false, and we must seek by the ut
most openness and candor as to our
real alms to convince them of its false
ness. We are in fact fighting for their
emancipation from fear, along with
our own--from the fear as well as
from the fact of unjust attack by
neighbors or rivals or schemers after
world empire. No one is threaten
ing the existence of or the indepen
dence or the peaceful enterprise of
th German empire.
Not Again to Be Trusted.
"The worst that can happen to the
German people is this, that If they
should still, after the war is over,
continue to be obligated to live under
ambitious and intriguing masters In
terested to disturb the peace of the
world, men or classes of men whom the
other peoples of the world could not
trust, it might be impossible to admit
them to the partnership of nations
which must henceforth guarantee the
world's peace. That partnership must
be a partnership of peoples, not a mere
partnership of governments. It might
be impossible, also, in such untoward
circumstances, to admit Germany to
the free economic intercourse which
must inevitably spring out of the other
partnerships of a real peace. But
there would be no aggression in that;
and such a situation, inevitable be
cause of distrust, would in the very
nature of things sooner or later cure
itself, by processes which would as
suredly set in.
Wrongs Must Be Righted.
, . of
"The wrongs the very deep wrongs,
committed in this war will have to be of
righted. That of course. But they
cannot and must not be righted by the
commission of similar wrongs against
Germany and her allies.
"The world will not permit the com
mission of similar wrongs as a means
of reparation and settlement. States
men must by this time have learned g
that the opinion of the world Is every
where wide awake and fully compre
hends the Issues involved. No repre
sentative of any self-governed nation
will dare disregard It by attempting
any such covenants of selfishness and
compromise as were entered into at the
congress of Vienna. The thought of
the plain people here and everywhere
throughout the world, the people who
enjoy no privilege and have very sim
pie and unsophisticated standards of
right and wrong, is the air all govern- a
ments must henceforth breathe if they
would live. It is in the full disclos
ing light of that thought that all poli
cies must be conceived and executed In
this mid-day hour of the world's life.
People Have No Say.
"German rulers have been able to up
set the peace of the world only because
the German people were not suffered
under their tutelage to share the com
radeship of the other peoples of the
world either in thought or in purpose,
They were allowed to have no opinion
of their own which might be set up as
a rule of conduct for those who exer
cised authority over them. But the
congress that concludes this war will
feel the full strength of the tides that
run now in the hearts and consciences
of freedom everywhere. Its conclu
sions will run with these tides.
"All these things have been true
from the very beginning of this stu
pendous war ; and I cannot help think
ing that if they had been made plain
at the very outset the sympathy and
enthusiasm of the Russian people
might have been once for all enlisted
the side of the allies, suspicion and
distrust swept away, and a real and
lasting union of purpose effected. Had
they believed these things at the very
moment of their revolution and had
they been confirmed in that belief

affairs towards an ordered and stable

"From every point of view, there
fore, it has seemed to be my duty to
speak these declarations of purpose, to
add these specific interpretations to
what I took the liberty of saying to the
senate in January. Our entrance into
the war has not altered our attitude
towards the settlement that must come
when it is over. When I said in Janu
ary that the nations of the world were
entitled not only to free pathways up
its files at the disposal of the general
public. The direct object in estab
lishing the new bureau is to provide

was thinking, and I am thinking now,
not of the smaller and weaker nations
alone, which need our countenance and
support, but also of the great and pow
erful nations, and of our present ene
mies as well as our present associates
in the war. I was thinking, and am
thinking now, of Austria herself,
among the rest, as well as of Serbia
and of Holand. Justice and equality
of rights can be had only at a great
price. We are seeking permanent, not
temporary, foundations for the peace
of the world and must seek this can
didly and fearlessly. As always, the
right will prove to be expedient.
Declars War on Austria.
"What shall we do, then, to push
this great war of freedom and just to
its righteous conclusion? We must
clear away with a thorough hand all
impediments to success and we must
make every adjustment of law that
will facilitate the full and free use of
our whole capacity and force as a
fighting unit.
"One very embarrassing obstacle
that stands in our way is that we are
at war with Germany but not with, her
allies. I, therefore, very earnestly rec
ommend that the congress immediately
declare the United States in a state of
war with Austria-Hungary. Does it
seem strange to you that this should
be the conclusion of the argument I
have just addressed to you? It is not.
It is in fact the Inevitable logic of
what I have said. Austria-Hungary is
for the time being not her own mis
tress, but simply the vassal of the
German government. We must face
the facts as they are and act upon
them without sentiment in this stern
business. The government of Austria
Hungary is not acting upon its own
initiative or in response to the wishes
and feelings of Its own peoples, but as
the instrument of another nation. We
must meet its force with our own and
regard the central powers as but one.
The war can be successfully conducted
in no other way.
As to Turkey and Bulgaria.
"The same logic would lead also to
a declaration of war against Turkey
and Bulgaria. They also are the tools
of Germany. But they are mere tools

gated under section 4067 of the Re

terms of the acts placing restraints
upon alien enemies. It is likely that
as time goes on many alien enemies
will be willing to be fed and housed
at the expense of the government in

the purpose of legislation I have sug

will supply the omission. What I am
perfectly clear about is that in the

whole attention and energy should be
concentrated on the vigorous, rapid
and successfnljirosecutlon of the great
task of winning the war.
"We can do this with all the greater
zeal and enthusiasm because we know
that for us this as a war of high prin
ciple. debased by no selfish ambition
of conquest or spoliation ; because we
know, and all the world knows, that
we have been forced into it to save the
very institutions we live under from
corruption and destruction. The pur
poses of the central powers strike
straight at the very heart of every
thing we believe in ; their methods of
warfare outrage every principle of hu
manity and of knightly honor; their
intrigue has corrupted the very
thought and spirit of many of our
people; their sinister and secret diplo
macy has sought to take our very ter
ritory away from us and disrupt the
union of the states. Our safety would
be at an end, our honor forever sullied

permit their triumph. They are strik

The Mystery Explained.
Clifton Hess, an employee of the
Pennsylvania railroad at Shelbyville,
Ind., relates the Indianapolis News,
looked out the window of the freight
depot the other day and noticed a
woman. A half hour later he looked
again and still saw the woman. She
had changed her position only slightly,
moving down the railroad track a few
feet. She seemed to be strolling leis
urely along, covering about a foot a
minute.
Curious to determine the reason for
her actions, Hess walked outside to
get a better view. Then it was all
explained. The woman had a big
Rhode Island Red rooster with a
string tied to his leg. There had
evidently been à leaky car of wheat
along the railroad, and the rooster, ob
livious to all else, was calmly filling
his craw while the woman kept up
with the procession.
Later on during the day the good
news must have spread, for there ap
peared on the scene several other
chickens with owners attached to
them by strings. As the ground be
came clean the procession slowly
moved from view.

EFFORTS WHEN STORM STALKS
IN DISASTER'S WAKE.
Injured Men, Women and Children
Buried Under Ruins of Shattered
or Burning Buildings Perish
From Cold and Hunger.
Halifax, N. S.—A raging blizzard
swept over stricken Halifax on Friday.
So fierce was the storm that rescue
workers were forced to suspend their
operations in the devastated section.
It is believed certain that all the in
jured buried under the ruins of shat
tered buildings have perished of cold
and hunger.
Battered by a lilting wind and blind
ing snow, the plight of the survivors
of Thursday's holocaust is little short
of desperate. The windows and doors
of virtually every house in the city
were shattered by the explosion which
wrecked the Richmond section and
devastated a large part of the water
front.
boards gave little protection against
the elements, and attempts to heat
buildings into which the snow 14 stead
ily drifting seemed hopeless.
The city was again in darkness Fri
day night except for the illumination
afforded by a scanty supply of oil
lamps, and unless these* were carefully
screened they were extinguished as
as lighted, by the gale which
whistled through* the crude shutters.
Only a small percentage of the build
ings had even this slight protection
from the storm.
The suffering of those who escaped
Injury was 1 »creased by the fact that
every available blanket, quilt and com
fort had been requisitioned for the
hundreds of injured in the temporary
hospitals. Many of these are so grave
ly wounded their only hope lies in the
best of care. Serrious fears are felt
that cold, shock and exposure will re
sult in an outbreak of pneumonia.
There is enough food on hand for
immediate needs, but it will last only
a short time unless additional supplies
are received. Hundreds of bodies have
been taken to the morgues, and rescue
squads are constantly finding new vic
tims buried under tons of debris un
of
Impr« vised barricades

| til the blizzard forces them to cease
of
work. Tbqre is every reason to believe
that many more will be recovered.
No concerted effort has been made
as yet to compile a list of the dead, as
every effort is being made to identify
those who perished. The condition of
many of the bodies makes this exceed
ingly difficult, and a large portion of
those who lost their lives will be buried
as "nameless dead." There is no rea
son. however, to change the estimate
of 2000 dead and 3000 injured.
Fires Under Control.
The fires which had been raging for
twenty-four hours in the north end
were brought under control early Fri
day, and the city is no longer menaced
by a conflagration.
While soldiers, sailors and volun
teers were searching the ruins of the
north end on Friday business was en
tirely suspended. The leading citizens
devoted their efforts to organizing
work of relief, and substantial prog
ress was made in this respect.
