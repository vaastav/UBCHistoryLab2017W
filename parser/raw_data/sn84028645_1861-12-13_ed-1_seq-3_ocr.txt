Washington. Dec, 11. About sixty gentle
men were present at the Republican caucus.
Finally the pending resolution of Representa
tive Binehum was unanimously adopted. It
provides for the confiscation of all property of
rebels in arms, and of all who aid and abet
them, and the unconditional emancipation oi
their slaves.
Mr. Sherman of New York took tbe ground
that we never oould put down this rebellion with
the bullet; that we must employ the slaves to
dolt.
Mr. Pomeroy. from Mr. Seward s county, ae-
precnted strife. He wanted the Republican par
ty maintained, and said that we ongbt not to
find fault with the Administration; that we
should blame ourselves; that we had abandoned
oar party; that there was no longer a Republi
can party In New York, Pennsylvania or Ohio.
Messrs. Julian and Dunn ol Indiana, in the
same strain, closed the debate, which showed
unmistakably that tbe House will striKestraigni

Gen. McClellan baa issued an order directing
the officers, in charge of military prisons in
this city to confine no civilian who is not regu
larly committed by a magistrate, and no soldier
except a deserter or those arrested by patrols,
without special ordera from headquarters.
This will be the means of checking a very
eerious offense. -
Thirty-seven rebel prisoners ot tbe two nnn
dred and fifty recently released, having arrived
at Norfolk, a corresponding nunwer ot onr own
prisoners have been forwarded North by tbe
rebel authorities. It is understood that Col.
Corcoran and the "other officers designated as
hostages for the safety of the pirates, will not
be released except in exchange for the pirates.

It ia nrobable that the first military execution
for desertion will tke place speedily. Piivats
Johnson, who deserted from Company D, Lin
coln Cavalry, is now on trial. The proofs
against him are conclusive. He was endeavor
ing not merely to gel away from our army, but
to go over to the rebels. It is understood that
an example will be made of him. Toe trial
will probably be conoluded to morrow. '
Last nient tne troops aiong ine center oi our

Gen. McClellan informed them an attack by the

"To Hon. F. P. Blair, Washington:
Yours of the 4th instant la just received.

everything we do or intend to do.' Itwat

Mr. Blair of Mo., from the committee on
Military Affairs, reported a bill authorizing tbe
raising of a volunteer force for the belter de
fense of Kentucky.
Mr. Wickhffo, who several days ago introduc
the bill, proceeded to ehow tbe importance
pasting it Kentucky, be said, was to be
great battle around of this war - Tbe peo
of that State hoped soon to see the day
the Invader's foot would be expelled from
territory which is now invaded. Property
been ruthlessly destroyed oroarried off;
homesteads have been made desolate, bridges
burned, etc.; and it is to pioteot the State
while ihe army is marched elsewhere that the
volunteer force is required.
Mr. Wiokliffe also said that he had received
from tbe Military B-jard of Kentusky an orgeat
application to call on the War Department and
for just such a corps as the bill provided -He
had brought the subject to the attention of
President and tbe Secretary of War, and it
met not only with their approval, but with that
all the Cabinet. ..-.- . . ;
Mr. Maynard spoke of a reoent sojourn in
tbe part bt Kentucky so much ravaged and laid
waaie by tbe rebel troops, and would allude at
future time . to the distressing condition of
affairs ia Eastern Tennessee, which he had
a time the honor to represent. His people,
said, had been left unprotected ty the Gov
ernment, notwithstanding tbeir devotion to Ihe
Union. He held it to be a duty to protect loyal
men not only In Tennessee and Kentucky, but
South Carolina and everywhere, aa much
as in Pennsylvania and the adjoining
States. . . " -

of the takJnrof tbo Heatbrnv fjotnmisslotiers,
Masesv and tilidell. from ths British mail steam
er Trent. An Indignation meeting was promptly
held, and resolutions were earrisa dv acclama
tion denoouoing the insult, and calling npon tbe
government to maimnin too uiguuj vi tuo uog.
Some prominent merchants spoke against pre
cipitate action, and said the matter bad better
be left to the government. ..loe teciiog 91. in
donation, however, was general.

Tbe shin Helen from Charleston arrived here
to-day, with a cargo ot rosin and turpentine.
Tbe flansa brines the London Times of tbe
28tb,: which .contains the 'aeoountof the meet
ing In Liverpool. Tbe following ' placard was
pasted on 'Cnange: i..--- . -i . a
"Outrage on the Britfah flag! Southern
CommiMioners forcibly removed from a British
mail steamer! .A public meeting will be held
in cotton sales room at three o'clock." "
The room was crowded to excess. Tbo chair
was occupied Jay James Spencer, who road the
following resolutions:
Rtsolvtd, That this meeting, having beard
with indignation that an American Federal ship
of war has forcibly taken from a British mail
steamer certain passengers peaceably under the
shelter of our flag, from one neutral port to an
other, do earnestly call npon tbe government to
assert tbe dignity of the British flag by requir
ing prompt reparation for this outrage.
This resolution waS received witn great en
thusiasm, Tho resolution wss advocated by
tbe chairman, who considered that he was ex
pressijg tbe feeling of the people when he said
it was tbe duty of the people to press on tbe
government tbe Imperative necessity of vindi
cating tbe honor and dignity of tbe British
name and flag.
Mr. John Campbell considered there was rea
son to doubt whether the facts related and act
ed on by this meeting wero in reality a breach
of international law, ana reterrea to opinions 01
tbe law officers of tbe crown, aa being In some
measure inclined to show that suoh a step as
taken with respect to tbe Southern Commission
ers, was justifiable nnder the existing state of
international law; and urged the propriety of
postponing tbe consideration or tne suojeet tin
to-morrow.
Mr. Law sustained Mr. Campbell's views. :
Tbe chairman suggested that, to meet the
objection of Mr. Campbell, to strike out the
wtrds "by requiring prompt reparation for this
outrage;"", and thus amended, the refolution
passed almost unanimously. -
Several merchants exorcised their views after
the adjournment, that the meeting and its action
was premature. .- ' ' - '' ,wl V t: .' '
