FOR THE' SCHOOLGIRL
FROCK THAT COPIES FASHION OF
HER ELDERS.
Attractive and Economical, It Will Be
Pleasing to the Mother aa Well
aa a Delight to the 8mall
Wearer.
Even the little tots are disporting
themselves In the contrasting material
costumes that were so much in voguo
In the eighties. Tbo fashion has one
thing to recommend It, and that Is Its
economy where old clothes are to be
made over. Part of Jane's and of
Willy's frock would make a quite new
looking suit tor Willy. Or a good skirt
could be made to serve duty for a tu
nic of new material. Aa every mother
knows, children are hard on their
sleeves.
The tunic In the patterns may be
made with either long or short sleeves
and with a*plain hem or a scalloped
bottom.
The pattern makes allow
ances for both, and this really gives a
woman two patterns for the price of
one.
The writer recommends the long
•leeves and, If one has the time, scal
loped bottom with a narrow bias fold
of a contrasting color stitched
the edge of the scallops.
The material used here is a striped
and a plain gingham, and the blouse Is
stitched to the waistband and
with an outside belt. For dress wear
there should be a dainty white lingerie
collar.
Now that grown-ups wear plaited
and gathered dresses the small ladies
want to do the same—or their mothers
want them to, which amounts to the
same thing. Perhaps the. prettiest
way of putting in gathers on little

Smocking is easily learned, and it
makes a very pretty decoration to
smock white frocks with colored cot
ton, or blue or pink linens and cottou
with white embroidery cotton.
If a mother does not wish to take
the trouble of making a skirt and
tunic according to this pattern she can
easily omit the tunic skirt.—Washing

Panne Velvet Stylish.
It looks as If panne and mirror vel
ve.t would be more stylish than the or
dinary silk pile velvet for the after
noon and evening dresses this season.
Of course for the conservative woman
ordinary velvet and velveteen will be
worn for suits and gowns also. It ts
just a case of shiny, surfaced velvets
being more fashionable, Just as they
are for millinery styles. In the woolen
materials vicuna, which looks like a
very fine eponge fabric, is very smart
for the long outside afternoon coats;
It is to bo had tn magnificent color
ings—deep pansy, heliotrope, wine, old
blues, deep greens and browns. After
noon dresses are combinations of chif
fon and mirror velvet, though here and
there are very good taffeta models
made wlntrlfled by bands of metal lace
and of fur. Bands of velvet replace
fur on some of the less pretentious
models.
Crepe Collar Darned in Yarn.

TWO GOOD CLEANING HINTS
Best Method of Removing Mildew
From White Goods—For Paint
8tains on Clothing.
For removing mildew from white
material take one teaspoonful of chlor
ide of lime and one teaspoonful of
washing soda. Put this and the mil
dewed article into two quarts of cold
water and let it boil for about four
hours; then skim off the scum, add two
pailfuls of cold water and let It stand
over night, with the article well cov
ered. If this is not long enough, put
the article back again and soak it until
the .mildew entirely disappears; then
rinse well and wash In the usual way.
Be sure to take off the scum, for that
is what burns the material in so many
of the recipes given.
To remove paint from clothes use
equal parts of benzine and ammonia,
rubbing with a cloth on the wrong way
of the nap to get out all the paint.
Then hang the garment on the clothes
line to dry in the open air. When dry,
If no trace of the paint Is seen, bru^h
the cloth in the proper direction. When
using benzine keep away from fire.

SUPERIOR RURAL ROAD WORK
Suggestions to Communities for the
Construction and Maintenance of
Country Highways.
That full value may be received for
the money appropriated for road pur
poses and that the best results ob
tainable may he secured it Is essential
that thé right than shall be placed In
charge of road work. He should be
selected not only because he actually
knows more about good roads than
any other person In the community,
but also because he can get the best
results from the money furnished. It
Is not sufficient, however, to let the
matter rest with the appointment of
a road overseer. He should receive
the whole-hearted support of the com
munity In the work. It should be seen
to that under the conditions and with
the money furnished the community
Is getting what It has a right to ex
pect In the way of road improvement.
It Is well to remember that if for any
reason an Incompetent man is placed
in charge of the work the responsi
bility for failure rests upon the com
munity. There should be no other
consideration, therefore, in selecting a
road overseer than that of securing a
man with the ability to perform the
duties required. It should be realized
that good roads have much to do with
the prosperity of a community and
that united action In the right direc
tion Is the surest and quickest way to
secure them.
Where the road overseer has had
but little experience in road work, or
where some new and difficult problem
Is presented to the experienced man,
the office of public roads and rural
engineering of the U. S. department
of agriculture when requested, will of
fer advice and suggestions for carry
ing on the work and how best to over
come the difficulties.
To secure a satisfying road of any
type, it is absolutely necessary to re
member: First, drainage; second,
drainage; and third, drainage. The
earth road, properly cared for, will
answer satisfactorily for the traffic of
many rural sections that cannot af
ford the better type3 of roads; but
the earth road must be well drained.
After this fact Is well understood,
two other requirements may be tallen
up—the location of the road and the
reduction of grades to a general aver
age of 5 per cent.
With the exception of sandy roads,
which are easiest for traveling when
damp, all roads must have proper side
ditches to carry away the surface wa
ter. In order to lead this surface wa
ter to the ditch, the road surface must
have a crown, or rounded roof, high
est In the center and sloping toward
the side ditches. A very easy and sat
isfactory way to keep earth, clay, and
gravel roads crowned, by the use of

Farmers' Bulletin 597, copies of which
may be obtained upon application to
the department. *
After the road has been crowntfd
and the crown is kept in condition by
the wise use of the road drag, it
should be seen to that ditches are kept
free from weeds, etc., and that they
are deep enough to carry off the
ter which runs Into them,
cases a wide, shallow ditch is best.
Deep ditches are dangerous to traffic.
At spaces of every few hundred feet
along the roadway a culvert of
kind should bp placed to carry away
the water which has gathered in the
ditches.

USE CARE WITH ACID SILAGE
Plan of Feeding to Keep Cows in Good
Physical Condition and Induce
Good Work In Dairy.
A good deal of corn Is put into the
silo every year before it Is properly
matured. This year this Is particu
larly true. Early frost, or fear of be
ing overtaken by it has Induced
many farmers to cut their corn while
it had little but stalks, the ears being
quite undeveloped. This often makes
acid silage and cows do not do as well
on It as they would on well-matured
corn.
Where a man has to feed this kind
of ensilage he ought to be careful not
to give too much at a feeding. A
small ration of this tender corn will
be eaten with great relish, there being
practically no waste. To balance the
ration and furnish a satisfying meal
there should be as much hay given ad
the cows will eat up clean, not at the
same time as the ensilage is fed, but
at another time of day. Then, too,
some ground feed will go very well
to supplement still further the unbal
anced ration provided in the corn.
This should not be especially laxa
tive In its nature; the cows are get
ting laxative food enough In the en
silage. Cornmeal seems a good feed;
or ground oats make a rich ration.
Such a plan of feeding ought to keep
the cows in good physical condition
and enable them to do good work In
the dairy.
FEEDING CALVES SOUR MILK
Experiment of Department of Agricul
ture Shows 8coura Are Due to
Uncleanly Conditions.
By recent experiment the depart
ment of agriculture seems to show
that scours are not due to sour milk
but to uncleanly conditions,
milk Is not allowed to stand for any
great length of time and not allowed
to become unclean It is as nourishing
to the young calf as sweet skim milk
and as rapid gains were made In one
case as In the other.
It was further shown that sudden
changes from sweet to sour and from
sour to sweet made no apparent
change in the calf, although the calf
was only a few days old.
found by experiment, however, that
sour milk does not prove so favorable
in winter as in summer.

tion we must leave with breed enthu
siasts, says a writer in an exchange.
Considerable proof can be adduced
by both sides, but in the final analysis
the question resolves itself into a
choice of individuals within the breed
and their development, due considera
tion being given to the buyer's per
sonal preferences and opportunities
of purchase of good individuals.
We would hesitate to dispose of a
good producing herd of one breed and
replace it with another without giving
the matter most careful thought. The
disposition of the milk, the prices the
surplus animals will bring, and the
cost of making the change should be
fully considered.
RECORD KEEPING PAYS WELL
Everything Must Be Determined in
Light of Scales, Babcock Test and
Cost of Production.
Before the results of modern herd
records were known, dairy cattle
were admitted to the herd books, and
bought and sold, chiefly on their out
ward appearances. There was no
standard by which to determine the
relation of form to production. A
nice-looking cow was the one which
brought the most money. What con
stituted such a cow was largely a mat
ter of opinion or prejudice.
With the introduction of herd rec
ords opinions came to be valued in
direct proportion to one's understand
ing of the relation of form to produc
tion. Everything must be determined
in the light of the scales, the Babcock
test and the cost of milk production.
Temperature for Churning.
Milk containing less than 20 per
cent of butterfat cannot be churned
at a temperature below 50 degrees, bul
milk containing 85 per cent or mors
can be churned at lower temperatur,
with good results.
