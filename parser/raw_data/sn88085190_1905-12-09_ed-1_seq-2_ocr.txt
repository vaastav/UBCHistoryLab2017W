ROOSEVELT
TO CONGRESS
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. s.—President
Roosevelt's message to congress was read
in both houses at noon.
The more important portions of th«
message follows:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives :
The people of this country continue to
enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there
will be ebb and flow In such prosperity,
and this ebb and flow will be felt more
or less by all members of the community,
both by the deserving and the undeserving.
Against the wrath of the Lord the wis
dom of man cannot avail; in times of flood
or drought human ingenuity can but par
tially repair the disaster. A general fail
ure of crops would~~hurt all of us. Again,
if the folly of man mars the general well
being, then those who are innocent of the
folly will have to pay part of the penalty
incurred by those who are guilty of the
folly. A panic brought on by the specu
ative folly of part of the business com
munty would hurt the whole business com
munity. But such stoppage of welfare,
though it might be severe, would not be
lasting. In the long run the one vital
factor in the permanent prosperity of the
country is the high individual character of
the average American worker, the average
American citizen, no matter whether his
work be mental or manual, whether he be
farmer or wage-worker, business man or
professional man.
In our industrial and social system the
interests of all men are so closely inter
twined that in the immense majority of
cases a straight dealing man who by his
efficiency, by his ingenuity and industry,
benefits himself must also (benefit others.
Normally the man of great productive ca
pacity who becomes rich by guiding the la
bor of many other men does so by en
abling them to produce more than they
could produce without his guidance; and
both he and they share in the benefit, which
comes also to the public at large. The sup
erficial fact that the sharing may be un
equal must never blind us to the under
lying fact that there is this sharing, and
that the benefit comes in some degree to
each man concerned. Normally, the wage
worker, the man of small means, and the
average consumer, as well as the average
producer, are all alike helped by making
conditions such that the man of exceptional
business ability receives an exceptional re
ward for his ability. Something can be
done by legislation to help the general pros
perity ; but no such help of a permanently
beneficial character can be given to the
less able and less fortunate, save as the
results of a policy which shall inure to the
advantage of all industrious and efficient
people who act decently; and this is only
another way of saying that any benefit
which comes to the less able and less
fortunate must of necessity come even more
to the more able and more fortunate. If,
therefore, the less fortunate man is moved
by envy of his more fortunate brother to
strike at the conditions under which .they
have both, though unequally, prospered, the
result will assuredly be that while damage
may come to the one struck at, it will
visit with an even heavier load the one
who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole
we must all go up or go down together.
Control of Corporation* Made Necessary
Yet, while not merely admitting, but In
sisting upon this, it is also true that where
there is no governmental restraint or sup
ervision some of the exceptional men use
their energies not in ways that are for
the common good, but in ways which tell
against this common good. The fortunes
amassed through corporate organization are
now so large, and vest such power in those
that wield them, as to make it a matter of
necessity to give to the sovereign—that is,
to the government, which represents the
people as a whole —some effective power of
supervision over their corporate use. In
order to insure a healthy social and indus
trial life, every big corporation should be
held responsible by, and be accountable to,
a sovereign strong enough to control its
conduct. I am in no sense hostile to corpo
rations. This is an age of combination
and any effort to prevent all combination
will be not only useless, but in the end
vicious, because of the contempt for law
which the failure to enforce inevitably pro
duces. We should, moreover, recognize in
cordial and ample fashion the Immense good
effected by corporate agencies in a country
such as ours, and the wealth of intellect,
energy, and fidelity devoted to their service,
and therefore normally to the service of the
public, by their officers and directors. The
corporation has come to stay, Just as the
trade union has come to stay. Each can
do and has done great good. Each should
be favored so long as it does good. But
each should be sharply checked where it
acts against law and justice.
So long as the finances of the nation are
kept upon an honest basis no other ques
tion of internal economy with which the
Congress has the power to deal begins to
approach the importance of the matter of
endeavoring to secure proper industrial con
ditions under which the individuals—and
especially the great corporations—doing an
interstate business are to act. The makers
of our national constitution provided espec
ially that the regulation of interstate com
merce should come within the sphere of
the general government. The arguments In
favor of their taking this stand 1 were even
then overwhelming. But they are far
stronger today, in view of the enormous
development of great business agencies,
usually corporate in form. Experience has
shown conclusively that it is useless-to try
to get any adequate regulation and super
vision of these great corporations by state
action. Such regulation and supervision can
only be effectively exercised by a sovereign
whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the
field of work of the corporations—that is,
by the national government. I believe that
this regulation and supervision can be ob
tained by the enactment of law by the Con
gress. If this proves impossible, it will
certainly be necessary ultimately to con
fer in fullest form such power upon the
national government by a proper amendment
of the constitution. It would obviously be
uswise to endeavor to secure such an amend
ment until it is certain that the result can
not be obtained under the constitution as
it now is. The laws of the Congress and 1
of the several states hitherto, as passed
upon by the courts, have resulted more often
la showing that the states have no power
In the matter than that the national gov
ernment has power; so that there at pres
ent exists a very- unfortunate condition
of things, under which these great corpo
rations doing an interstate business occupy
the position of subjects without a sover
eign, neither any state government nor the
national government having effective control
over them. Our steady aim should be by
legislation, cautiously and carefully under
taken, resolutely persevered in, to assert
the sovereignty of the national government
by affirmative action.
This is only In form an innovation; In
substance It is merely a restoration; for
from the earliest time such regulation of
industrial activities has been recognized in
the action of the lawmaking bodies; and all
that I propose is to meet the changed con
ditions in such manner as will prevent the
commonwealth abdicating the power It has
always possessed, not only in this country,
but also in England, before and since this
country became a separate nation.
Many loopnoies la law 1! Jfaoninir.
It has been a misfortune that the national
laws on this subject have hitherto been of
a- negative or prohibitive rather than an
affirmative kind, and still more that they
have in part sought to prohibit what could
noc be effectively prohibited, and have In
part In their prohibitions confounded wbat
should be allowed and what should not be
allowed. It is generally useless to try to
prohibit all restraint on competition,
whether this restraint be reasonable or un
reasonable ; and where It is not useless It
is generally hurtful. Event* have shown
that it is not possible adequately to se
cure the enforcement of any law of this
kind by incessant %ppeal to the courts. The
Department of Justice has for the last four
years devoted more attention to the enforce
ment of the antitrust legislation than to
anything else. Much has-been accomplished;
particularly marked has been the moral
effect of the prosecutions'; but it is in
creasingly evident that there will be a vtry,
insufficient beneficial result in the way of
economic change. The successful, prosecu
tion of one device to evade the law immedi
ately develops another device to accomp
lish the same purpose. What Is needed is
not sweeping prohibition of every arrange
ment, good or bad, which may tend to re
strict competition, but such adequate super
vision and regulation as will prevent any
restriction of competition from being to
the detriment of the public—as well as
such supervision and regulation as will pre
vent other abuses in no way connected with
restriction of competition. Of these abuses,
perhaps the chief, although by no means the
only one, is overcapitalization—generally it
self the result of dishonest promotion— be
cause of the myriad evils it brings in its
train; for such overcapitalization often
means an inflation that invites business
panic; is always conceals the true relation
of the profits earned to the capital actually
invested, and it creates a burden of Interest
payments which is a fertile cause of im
proper reduction in or limitation of wages;
it damages the small investor, discourages
thrift, and encourages gambling and specu
lation ; while perhaps worst of all is the
trlckiness and tfierhonesty which it implies—
for harm to morals is worse than any pos
sible harm to material interests, and the
debauchery of politics and business by great
dishonest corporations is far worse than
any actual material evil they do the pub
lic. Until the National Government obtains,
in some manner which the wisdom of the
Congress may suggest, proper control over
the big corporations engaged in interstate
commerce—that is, over the great majority
of the big corporations—it will be impos
sible to deal adequately with these evils.
I am well aware of the difficulties of the
legislation that I am suggesting, and of the
need of temperate and cautious action in
securing it. I should emphatically protest
against improperly radical or hasty action.
The lirst thing to do is to deal with the
great corporations engaged in the business
of interstate transportation. As I said in
my Message of December 6 last, the immed
iate and most pressing need, so far as
legislation is concerned, is the enactment
into law of some scheme to secure to the
agents of the Government such supervision
and regulation of the rates charged by the
railroads of the country engaged in inter
state traffic as shall summarily and effec
tively prevent the imposition of unjust, or
unreasonable rates. It must include putting
a complete stop to rebates in every shape
and form. This power to regulate rates,
like all similar powers over the business
world, should be exercised with moderation,
caution, and self-restraint; but it should
exist,- so that It can be effectively exercised
when the need arises.
Wo Unnecessary Interference.
The first consideration to be kept in mind
is that the power should be affirmative and
should be given to some administrative body
created by the Congress. If given to the
present interstate commerce commission or
to a reorganized 1 Interstate commerce com
mission, such commission should be made
unequivocally administrative. I do not be
lieve in the government interfering with
private business more than is necessary. I
do not believe in the government under
taking any work which can with propriety
be left in private hands. But neither do I
believe in the government flinching from
overseeing any work when it becomes evi
dent that abuses are sure to obtain therein
unless there is governmental supervision. It
is not my province to indicate the exact
terms of the law which should be enacted;
but I call the attention of the Congress to
certain existing conditions with which it is
desirable to deal. In my judgment the most
Important provision whic- such law should
contain is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power to de
cide, upon the case being brought before it,
whether a given rate prescribed by a rail
road is reasonable and just, and if it is
found to be unreasonable and unjust, then,
after full investigation of the complaint, to
prescribe the limit of rate beyond which It
shall not be lawful to go—the maximum
reasonable rate, as it is commonly called—
this decision to go into effect within a rear
sonalble time and to obtain from thence on
ward, subject to review by the courts. It
sometimes happens at present, not that a
rate is too high but that a favored shipper
is given too low a rate. In such case the
commission would have the right to fix this
already established minimum rate as the
maximum; and it would need only one or
two such decisions by the commission to
cure railroad companies of the practice of
giving improper minimum rates. I can
your attention to the fact that my proposal
is not to give the commission power to
initiate or originate rates generally, but to
regulate a rate already fixed or originated
by the roads, upon complaint and after in
vestigation. A heavy penalty should be
exacted from any corporation which falls to
respect an order of the commission. I re
gard this power to establish a maximum
rate as being essential to any scheme of real
reform in the matter of railway regulation.
The first necessity is to secure it; and un
less it is granted to the commission there
is little use in touching the subject at all.
Certain Schemes for Giving Rebates.
Illegal transactions often occur under the
forms of law. It has often occurred that
a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to
buy a large quantity of some commodity
and then after it has been bought an open
reduction is made in the rate to take effect
immediately, the arrangement resulting to
the profit of one shipper and the one rail
road and to the damage of all their com
petitors ; for it must not be forgotten that
the big shippers are at least as much to
blame as any railroad* in the matter of
rebates. The law should make it so clear
that nobody can fail to understand that any
kind of commission paid on freight ship
ments, whether In this form or In the form
of fictitious damage, or of a concession, a
free pass, reduced passenger rate, or pay
ment of brokerage, is illegal. It is worth
while considering whether it would not be
wise to confer on the government the right
of civil action against the beneficiary of a
rebate for at least twice the value of the
rebate; this would help stop wbat Is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should be
stopped, for they have now grown to such
an extent that they are demoralizing and
are used as rebates.
An Honest Agx«Ha««t Wanted. ,
The best I possible ;5 regulation of rates
would, of course, be .that , regulation j secured
by an honest agreement among the railroads
themselves ito % carry % oat the j law. Such s a
general agreement would, for / instance, at
once - put a stop to thel efforts •of any one
big i shipper » or i big I railroad % to | discriminate

rival; ; and such j agreement would : make I the

necessity for j giving this 1 further £ power is
by no means as great as the necessity for
giving the commission or , administrative
body .- the - other i powers I f have > enumerated
above; : and It may well be Inadvisable to
attempt to vest this particular power in the
commission or other administrative body
until It already possesses and Is exercising

tant of f all the powers «I 1 recommend—as
indeed the vitally important power—that to

of: hostility.., to the railroad's. •On ethical
grounds, on grounds of j right, such hostility
would be intolerable; and on grounds of
mere national self-interest we must remem
ber that S such | hostility would tell against
the welfare not merely of some few rich
men, but a multitude of . small investors, a
multitude of railway employes, ■ wage-work
- ers ; and most severely against i the interest
of the public as a whole. I believe that
on the whole our railroads have done well
and not ill; but- the railroad men I who
wish |to do * well should : not ; be exposed to
competition with - those . who have ;no i such
desire, and the only way to secure this end
Is to give to some government S tribunal
the, power to see that justice Is, done by
the unwilling: exactly' as it is gladly done
by the willing. Moreover, if some:govern
ment - body is given . increased: power the
effect I will be to furnish authoritative an
swer on behalf 'of the railroad whenever
irrational clamor against it is raised, or
whenever charges made against |it are dis
proved. I ask this . legislation not only in
the Interest of the public but in the interest
of the : honest railroad man - and the , honest
shipper alike, for it is they who are chiefly
jeopardized! by the practices lof their • dis
honest competitors. This legislation should
be enacted in a spirit as remote as possible
from hysteria and rancor. If. we of , the
American body politic are . true to the tra
ditions we have inherited we shall always
scorn any effort . to make. us I hate any man
because he Is rich,. just as much as we
should scorn any - effort to . make ,us look
down upon or treat contemptuously any
man because he jis poor. We judge a man
•by his conduct—that is, by his character—
and not by his. wealth or intellect, g■ If he
makes his fortune honestly, there is no just
cause of quarrel with him. Indeed, we have
nothing but the kindliest *- feelings of l ad
miration for the successful business man
who behaves decently, whether he has made
his success by building or managing a rail
road or by shipping goods over that ' rail
road. ; The big j railroad men and big! ship
pers are simply Americans of the ordinary
type who | have developed to an extraordi
nary degree certain great business qualities.
They are neither better nor worse than their
fellow-citizns of \ smaller means, r;. They are
merely more able in certain lines and there
fore : exposed to certain - peculiarly - strong
temptations, q These temptations t have I not
sprung newly into being; the; exceptionally
successful among mankind have always been
exposed to them; but they . have - grown
amazingly In power as a result of the extra
ordinary development of industrialism along
new lines, and under these new conditions,
which the lawmakers of \ old could j not fore
see and therefore could not provide against,
they have become iso serious and menacing
as to demand entirely : new ' remedies. It
'.s in the interest of the best type of railroad
man ■ and : the best ; type of: shipper no less
than of the public that there should be gov
ernmental supervision and regulation of
these great business operations, for the
-same j reason ' that rit Is. in - the ' Interest of
the corporation which wishes -to l treat Its
employes ' aright that there > should ~ be an
effective > employers' -*- liability act, Kor I an
effective system of factory /laws to pre
vent the abuse, of women and children. >^
Will Prevent Much Temptation. '
All such legislation frees the corporation
that wishes '- to \do well: from being driven
Into doing it, in order to compete with its
rival, which prefers to do : 111. s We desire :to
set iupCa '• • moral standard. There can %be
no delusion more fatal 'to the; nation than
the delusion : that • the standard |of I profits,'
of business I prosperity, is sufficient jin judg
ing any business or political j question—
rate legislation to * municipal government,
business* success, whether for the j individual
or for the nation, is a >good thing only so
far as it is accompanied by l and develops a
high standard of conduct—honor, • integrity,
civic i courage. The kind -of • business - pros

that :- puts ,Jan H Inordinate a value ton mere

\ Transportation is ail important.
The question of transportation lies at
the root of all Industrial success, and the
revolution : in % transportation % which has
taken place I during i the \ last \ half century
has been •- the i most ' important f factor lin
the growth of the 1 new Industrial condi

: > Capital and labor Problem.
The question of securing a healthy
Belf-respecting and mutually syn
thetic attitude as between employeran,
employe, capitalist and wage worker ?,
a difficult one. All phases of the labor
problem prove difficult when approach^
But S the underlying principles, the r X :
principles, in accordance with which tZ
problem must be solved, are entirely
simple. We can get justice and right
dealing only if we put as of paramour
importance the principle of treating a
man on his worth as a man rather than
with reference to his social position, his
occupation, or the class to which he
belongs. There are selfish and brutal
men in all ranks of life. if they are
capitalists their selfishness and brutality
may take the form of hard indifference
to suffering, greedy disregard of every
moral restraint which intererferes with
the accumulation of wealth, and cold
blooded exploitation of the weak; or if
they are laborers, the form of laziness
of sullen envy of more fortunate, and
of .willingness to perform deeds of mur
derous violence. Such conduct is just
as reprehensible in one case as in the
other, and all honest and farseeing men
should join in warring against it where
ever it becomes manifest. Individual
capital, and individual wage worker, cor
poration and union, are alike entitled
to the protection of the law, and must
alike obey the law. Moreover, in addi
tion to mere obedience to the law, each.
man, if he be really a good citizen, must
show broad sympathy for his neighbor
and genuine desire to look at any ques
tion arising between them from the
standpoint of that neighbor no less than
from his own; and to this end it Is es
sential that capitalist and wage worker
should consult freely one with the other;
should each strive to bring closer the
day, when both shall realize that they
are properly partners and not enemies.
To approach the questions which inevit
ably arise between them solely from the
standpoint which treats each side in the
mass |as the enemy of the other side
in the mass is both wicked and foolish.
In the past the most direful among the
influences which have brought about the
downfall of republics has ever been the
growth of the class spirit, the growth of
the ; spirit which tends to make a man
subordinate i the welfare of the pubilc
as a whole to the welfare of the particu
lar class to which he belongs, the substi
tution of loyalty to a class for loyalty
to the nation. ">.
-"•- 1 Control -of : Insurance Companies.
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations whose
business has extended so far beyond the
jurisdiction of the states which created
them |as to preclude strict enforcement
of supervision and regulation by the
parent states. In my last annual mes
sage I recommended "that congress care
fully consider whether the power of the
bureau of corporations can not constitu
tionally be extended to cover interstate
transactions in insurance." Recent
events have emphasized the importance
of an early and exhaustive consideration
of this question, to see whether it is
not possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been aw*
to furnish against corruption of the na
grant - kind which has been exposed. «
has -i been . only too clearly shown that
certain men at the head of these large
corporations take but small note or me
ethical distinction between honesty ana
dishonesty; they draw the line only tw»
side of what may be called la-, hon"i;
the kind of honesty necessary in order
to avoid falling into the clutches of we
law. Of i course the only complete rern
edy for this condition must be founa m
an aroused public conscience, a msne'
sense of the ethical conduct in the cm
munity at large, I and especially an**
business men and in the great prows
sion of j the law, and in the growth or *
spirit i which condems all dishonest},
whether ;in rich man or in poor ma» :
whether it takes the shape of brlDer.
or of blackmail. s But much can be flow
by legislation which is not only drasu
but i practical. There is need for aw
stricter ; and i more uniform regulation 01
