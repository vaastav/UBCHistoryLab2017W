Tlic resident's Message, j
We have tho pleasure of laying before
uar renders in full, this morning, tbe -'j . u
written, interesting ana able wesg v.
president Grant to Congress.1' ,s'one
of tie rnostSimportant documents ever is
B'nei by the Executive hl tte Atnerj
.;au people. It is concise in its statement,
sufficiently det.iied, bold in utterance
and firm in tone, and as a whole will meet
the approbation of the country.
It opens with cougratulations'upon the
Peaceful rolation that exists at home, and
that the gr ind work of reconstruction is
nearly icoomplished and a united country
is soon to be ours, indicating the cohesive
principles upon which it rests, and the
enduring foundation upon which the
superstructure has been raised. The re
view of our foreign relations is candid
and well considered, and of a character to
commend it to the good sense of the
intelligent masses of the people. The
foreign war is carefully treated, eviucing
i liberal and catholic spirit, expressing
an earnest desire that peace shall soon h
. stabliidied. The rights of Amerie.uu
. itizens abroad have been protected, and
the appeals made in their behalf have
been promptly recognized. Having at
hpart the promulgation of the principles
if Republican institutions and the plant
ing of free Republics, the President early
reconied the new French Republic.
An epitome of the Cuban insurrection is
onri :-',ely given, with a statement of our
if;l;kikuM thereto and the oppression of
Ameiiirttt citizens gowiog out of the long
protracted contest and the unstable con
dition of efftiii'8 in that country. The
.)rrani-ition of tbe Pence Conference and
the reasons for its postponement is ex
plained, with tbe K isertion of bii full be
lief an;l i-r.lorseioeut of the Monroe Djeu-
iUOIlt.
Tht acquisition of Sau Domingo and
it unmorcinl value is discussed t
length in an able and forcible D inner,
with an apparent e.-irne.st t'oiivipi I'm tlmt
it i'i t'v lilty of Congress to fully and
tirmly irivtstigitte this question, and re-rt'inimiul-4
ibf c.iily appointment of
i-oiamir'siou to negotiate for its pa-sintr
un.ler tl full control of our Government.
1 his portion ot tno messnffe is lull of m-
it'ict, and it appears to us from its ear
net and fervid discussion must bring the
...n vision to all that in all relations ii is
an imporfsnt subject of consideration at
tbe prp-Mit time, lest the losing of this
opportunity may prove disadvantageous
tj the nation, even to the imperiling of
its ti ibility, and should a final decision
b.i uivt'ii adverse to its annexation, that
it will f ill into the possession of fonin
p-HVt-rs thst know and appreciate its posi
tion and importance. We are pleased to
.i.-i? ton pertinacity with which the Presi
dent pursues the subject, as our views
have been in favor of securing tnis vulii
nble territory as American domain. We
stood alone almost among the press of
New England on this question at the
time that the treaty was before the Senate
at the last session of Congress, and sin
cerely hope that our Senators may appre
ciate the views and arguments of thej ex
ecutive upon this point which leads on to
the highway of national prosperity.
A judicious allusion is made to Mexi
can affairs, and the terrible condition of
China and tbe murderous spirit uinni
tested, with a recommendation of tbe in
tervention of the nations to modify the
barbarous spirit, and infuse into their
civilization the essence of the principles
of peace, and the natives to friendly re
lations. The Alabama claims are considered in
a conciliatory spirit, recommending that
a commission be established to collect the
public and private claims growing out of
tho outrugts committed, believing that
the British, although now firm, will come
to see the injustice of their position upon
this question, as well as to be prepared to
preseut and urge these claims to full set
tlement, should eventual necessity de
mand it.
The tone of the Message, while it is
ftrro, is far more moderate than Gen. I3ut
tier in his celebrated Boston speech a lew
days since, would have us believe. It is
now very evident that bis ntt. ranees
were not the foresh ado winy s of the views
of the administration.

suggestion, will commend it to the mas

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and Souse of Representatives
A year of peace and general prosperity to this
nn inn baa passed smce the last assembling of
Congress. We have through a kind Providence
been blessed with abundant crops and have been
anared from comnlications and war with foreign
nations. In our midst comparative harmony has
on restored. It is to be reerettea. however,
Luat the free exercise of the elective franchise has
by violence and intimidation been denied to citi
zens in exceptional cases in some of the states
lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people
has thereby Deen reversed, ine states oi Vir
ginia, Mississippi and Texas, have been restored
to representation in our national councils, u-eor-trla.
the onlv state now withont representation.
may confidently be expected to take her place
there also at the beginning of the new year, .and
then, let us hope, will be completed the work of
reconstruction with an acquiescence on the part
of the whole people in the national obligation to
pay the publio debt, created as the price of our
Union, the pensions to our disabled soldiers and
sailors, ana tneir wiaows ana orpnans. Ana m
the changes to the constitution which have been
made necessary by a great rebellion, there is no
reason why we should not advance in material
prosperity and happiness as no other nation did
after so protracted and devastating war. Soon
atter the existing war broke out in Europe the
protection of the United Btatea Minister in Paris
was invoked in favor of North tfermans domi
ciled in French territory, instructions were is-
lowed bv an extension of American protection to
the citizens of Saxony, Hesse. Baxe-Cobourg-Go-
tha, Columbia, Portugal, L raguay, tne iwmimcan
Republic, Ecquador, Chili', Paraguay and Vene
zuela in Paris. Tne charge was an onorons one,
requiring constant and severe labor as well as the
exercise of patience, prudence and good judgment.
It has been perfume 1 to theeotire satisfaction of
this Government, and, as 1 am otticially informed,
equally so to the entire satisfaction of the Gov
ernment of North Germany. As soon as I learn
e i that a Republic had been proclaimed at Paris
and that the people of Prance had ac
quiesced in the change, the Minister of tbe
United States was directed by telegraph to re
cognize it and tender my congratulations and
those of tbe people of the United titates.
The re-establi8bm?nt in France of a system of
government disconnected with the dynastic
traditions of Europe, appeared to be a possible
prrqect for the felicittttious i.f Americans. Should
tbe present struggle result in attracting the
hearts of the t ranch to our simpler forms
ot lepreientatiTH government it will be a
subject of still further satisfaction to
our people. While we make no etfort to impose
our institutions upon the Inhabitants of other
countries, and while we adhere to our traditional'
neutrality in oivil contests, we cannot he indiffer
ent to the spread of American political ideas in a
great ana highly civilized country uke f ranee,
Ve were asked by the new government to use
our good rffices jointly with those of European
powers in the interests of peace. The answer
was made that the established policy and the true
interests ot trie united states lor Dane tnem to
interfere in European questions jointly with
the European powers. I ascertained infor
mally and niiofhciiily that the government of
North Germany was not then disposed to listen
to any such representations from other powers,
and though earnestly wishing to see the bles
sings of peace restored to the belligerents,
with all of whom the United States
are on terms of friendship, I declined on
the part of this iruvernment to take a step which
would only result in injury to our true interests
without advancing the object for which our in
tervention was invoked, dhouid the time come
when toe action ox the United (states can hasten
tbe return of peace by a single hour, that action
will be heartily taken. 1 deemed it prudent,
in view of the number of persons of German and
French birth, living in the United States, to issue
soon after official notice of a state of war had
bten received from both belligerents, a proclama-
mation denuinir the duties ot me united Mates
as a neutral and tbe obligations f persons re-
siuinff within its territory to oDserve tneir laws
and the lavs ol nations. This proclamation was
followed by others as circumstances seemed to
call for them. The people thus acquainted in
advance of their duties and obligttious have as
sisted in preventing violations of toe neutrality
of the United States.
CCSAN AFFAIRS.
It is not uuderstuoi that the condition ot the
insurrection in Cuba has materially changed since
the close ol the last sttsion of Congress. In an
early stage of tbe contest, the authorities of 8pain
inaugurated a system of arbitrary arrests, close
conhuement, and of military trial and execution
of persons suspe ted of complicity with the in
surgents, and ol a summary embargo ot their
properties aud tbe sequestration el their revenues
by the executive warrant. Such proceedings, so
tar as tbey attt-eted the persons or property ot
citizens of the United States, Were in violation
of the provisions of the treaty of 17S5 between
the United otatea and bpaiu. ti epresent itions
of injuries resulting to several persons claim
ing to be citizens of tin United States, by reason
of such violations were made to the Spanish Gov
ernment, Prom April, 1809, to June last, the
Spanish Minister at Washington had . been
clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing
such wrongs. That power was found to be with
drawn in view, ss i'. was eaid, ot the favorable
situation in which the Island ot Cuba then was,

iously to a fleet the relations bei-.venthu Uiited

in this way. The claim of the Col. Jlo)d Aspin

vessel, was referred to arbitration by mutual
cuutcnt. and has resulted in an award to the Cm
Udfctated for the owners oi the iarne of $i'J,702.oO

amples stiow that the mode which the United

fact to Uongress and invite its action on the sub
ject. 1'AC CUfU -UEME.
The Ions deferred Peace Conference between
Spain and the allied t-outh American Ueoublics
has been inaugurated in Washington under the
auspices of the United btatcs, pursuant to the re
commendations contained in tne resolution ot the
House of representatives ot the 17th of Decern
ber, lBbb, the Executive Department of the gov
ernment ottered its friendly offices for the promo
tion of peace and harmony between t pain and
the allied Uepublics. Hesitations and ob-tacles
occurred to the acceptance of the oner ultimate
ly, however, a conference was arranged and was
opened in this city on the 29th of October last, at
which 1 autnorizea tne secretary of state to pre
side. It. was attended by the Ministers of Spain,
Peru, Chili and Ecquador. la consequence ot the
absence of a JKepiesentative from Holtvia the
Conference was adjourned until the attendance
of a Plenipotentiary from that .Republic could be
secured, or otner measures could be aoopted to
wards coinpafSing its object. The aliietf ud
other Republics of r-panish origin on thia louti?
nent may see in this fact a clear proof of our sin
cere interest in tneir welfare, ol our desire to see
them blessed with good governments cauable ol
maintaining ordernd pre-erving their respective
territorial iutegrity, and of our sincere wit-h to
exieuu our own commercial anu coiai rela
tions with them. The time is not prob-ibly ftr
distant when in the natural course of events the
European political connection with this continent
will cease. Our policy should be shaped in view
ot this probability so as to ally the commercial
inteiets of the fpanish American States more
closely to our own, and thus give the United
nitres an tne pre-eminence ana u tbe advan
tage, which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams and Mr,
tiay oi ntemptated when they proposed to join in
BAN DOMIItoo.
During the last session of Congress a treaty for
the annexation of the .Republic of fcan Domineo
v mo vuitcu euuo), junta io receive tne requi
site two thirds vote of the Senate. I was thor
oughly convinced then that the best interests of
mis country commerciallv and m-jtTiniw A.
manded its ratification. Time hs only confirmed
me in this view. I now firmly believe that
tne moment it is known that the United
States have . entirely abandoned the pro
ject of accepting as a part of its territory the Is
land of San Domingo, a free port, will be rego
tiated for by European nations. In the bay of
Samana a large commercial city will spring up,
to which we will be tributary without receiving
coiTBspunuing oeuencs, ana tbere win be seen
the follv of reiectin? n otpa. a . nriTa
The1 Government of San Domingo has
voluntarily sought this anneati n. It is a
weak power, numbering probioiy lesa than
12l),t)0u souls, and yet possessing one of the richest
localities under the sun, and capable of support
ing a Domuation or ui.ut u.vihi .r ixumin in ininn
The people ot San Domingo are not capable of
maintaining themselves in their present condition
and must look for outside support. They yearn
for the protection of our free institutions and
laws, our progress and civilisation. Shall we re
fuse them I ihe acquisition of Ban Doming! is
desirable because Of lt ueno-rnnMnHl nntiitinn. Tt.
commands the entrance of the Carribian and the
Isthmus transit of commerce. It possesses
the richest soil, the best and most capacious har
boig, the most salubrious climate, and the most
valuable products of the forests, m in ob and anil of
an? of the West India Islands. It possession by
us wiil 1 a few years build up a coastwise com
merce of Jmmense magnitude which will go far
towards restoring to us our lost merchant marine.
It will give to us those articles which we consume
greatly, and do not produce, thus equalizing our
exports and imports. In case of a foreign war it
will give us command of all the Islands referred
tc, and thus prevent an enemy from gaming
himself a rendezvous on our coast. It will pro
tect our coast trade between the States bordering
on the Atlantic and those boiderjng on the Gulf
of Mexic j, and to tbe Bahamas and tne Antilles.
Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign
counti iea to get by from Georgia to the west coast
ot Florida. San Domingo with a stable government
under which her immense resources can be devel
oped, will give remunerative wages to 100,000 la
borers not now upon the Island, ; This labor will
take advantage of every availance and means of
transportation to abandon the adjacent Islands
and seek the blessings of freedom and its conse
quences, each inhabitant receiving the reward of
his own labor. Porto Eico and Cuba will have
to abolish Slavery as a measure of self preserva
tion to retain their- laborers. San Domingo wiU
become a large consumer of the products of
uuruieru uuias ana manufactures. The cheap
rate at which her citizens can be furnished with
food, tools and machinery, will make it necessary
that the contiguous islands should have the same
advantage, in order to compete in the production
oi sugar, couee, tooacco. tropical irons, etc., and
will ODen to us a wider market for our nroducta.
The production of our own supply of these ai tides
will out off more than one hundred millions of our
annual imports, besides largely increasing our
exports. - With such a picture it is easy to see
uuw uux large ueuc aoroaa is ultimately to be ex
tinguished. - With a balance of trade against nx.
including the interest of bonds held by foreigners
and money shipments by our citizens traveling
in ioreign tanas equal to tne enure yield ol nreci-
ous metals in this country, it is not so easy to see
how this result is to be otherwise accomplished.
The acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence
to the Monroe doctrine. It is a measure of na
tional protection. It is asserting our just claim
and controlling influence over the great commer
cial tratho soon to flow from west to east by way
of the Isthmus of Darien, which is to build up our
mercuans ana marine service, it is to luruish
new markets for the products of our farms, shops
and manufactories. It is to make slavery uneup
p or table in Cuba and Porto Kico at once and ul
timately so in Brazil. It is to settle the unhappy
condition of Cuba and end an exterminating con
flict. It is to provide honest means of paying
mux honest debts without over-taxing the people.
It is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries
of every day life at cheaner rates than ever befhra.
and it is in tine a rapid stride towards that great
ness wnicn tne inteuigence.industry and enterprise
of the citizens of the United States entitle tnis
country to assume among nations. In view of the
importance ot this question I earnestly urge upon
Congress early action expressive of its-views as to
the best means of acquiring San Domineo. Mv
suggestion is that by a jint resolution of the two
nouses oi congress tne JSxecuttve be authorized
to appoint a commission to negotiate a treaty
with the authorities of San Domingo for the ac
quisition of that island, and than an appropri
ation be made to defray tbe expenses of such
commission, and the question then be determined
by the aotionof the two Houses ot Congress upon
a resolution of annexation as in the case of the
acquisition of Texas. So convinced am 1 of
the advantages to flow from the acquisition of
San Domingo and of the great disadvantages I
might almost say calamities from the non-acqui-
si uon, that I believe the subject has only t be
investigated to be approved.
BELAT1CSS 'WITH MFXICO.
It Is to be regretted that our represeutatious
in regard to the injuroua t-tfecta, especially upon
the revenue of the United "States of the policy of
the Mexican government in, exempting from ex
port duties the products ot a large tract of its
territory on our borders, have not only been fruit
less, but that it is even proposed in that c mntry
to extend the limits within which the privilege
adverted to has been hitnert;) enjoyed. The ex
pediency of taken into your serious coastdera
tion proper measures for counteracting the policy
referred to will, it is presumed, engage your earn
est attention. It is the obvious interest especial
ly of neighboring nations to provide against the
impunity of thoe who may have committed high
crimes within their border, and who may have
ought refuge abroad. or this purpose ex '.ra
dition treaties have beon concluded with several
of tbe Central American Republics and others are
in progress. . The set.se cf comms is desired as
early as may be convenient upon the proceeding
of the commifcuion an tli otawaa Vertex ul-
la, a communicated in my message of March
4th. lHli'J. March 1st. 187U, ana March a 1st. 1H7U
It has not been been deemed advisable to distri
bute any t.f the money which has been received
from that government until i'ongress shall have
acted upon the subject.
CHTNF.SE MASSACRE.
The massacre ct the French and KassUn resi
dents at Tien Tsien, under circumstances of great
barbarity, were auppnsed by some to have been pre
meditated, and to indicate a purpose among tbe
populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese
empire. The evidence falls to establish such a
supposition, but shows a complicity by the local
authorities wi h the mob. The government at Pe
km, however, seems to have teen disposed to fulhl
its treaty obligations so tar as it was ab.e to co so.
Unfortunately the news of tbe war between the
German States and Prance reached China toon
after the massacre. It would appear that the
popular mind become possess d with the idea
that this contest extending to Chinese waters
would neutralize the christian inrluencs and
power, and that the time was coining when the
superstitious ma-s might expel all foreigners aud
restore tbe Manoarian influence. Antioiiuitintr
trouble from this cause, I invited France and
Noith Germanv to make an authorized eu-pen
sion of ho.-to Hies in the east where they were
temporarily suspended by an act ot the com
munders, and to act together foi tbe future pro
tection in China of the lives and properties ot
Americans and turoeaus.
7UEATIEF,
Since the adjournment of Congress the r-ilitloa
Hon of the treaty with Great Britain for uboliob
ing the mixed courts for the suppreiou of the
slave tra.de have been exchanged. It is believed
that the slave trade is now coutinud to the east
ern coast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken to
Arabian markets
1 r c ratification ot tbe nittunuiziUou conven
tion between Great Britain and tbe United Slates
has al,o been exchanged during the recess, iiud

MOl'MAB Y LINL-.
iu Apul l.iH, while ctgaKcd iu looatiug u mili
tary reservation near 1'einbina, a corps of En
glnccrs discovered that the commonly retcived
boundary line between the l.'nittd Mates aud the
British possessions at that p ace is about 1,700
feet touth of the ttuc position of the4'Jth parallel,
ana that the line, when run on what is now sup
posed to bo the true position of that parallel,
would leave the furt of the Hudson Bay Company
at Peiubiu and withiu the territory of the United
States. This informa'jon bciog commumcnted
to the Brit sh irovernment, I was requested t
coni-eiit and did consent that the British occupa
tion ol the fort of the Hudson Bay Company
Bhotild contiuue lor the present. I deem it im
portant, however, that this part ol the boundary
line &h mid be dunuilcly hxei by a joint c uuiuis
sion of the two governments, and I submit here
with estimates of the expense of such a oool
mitslon on the part of the United btatas, aud re
commend an appropriation for tht purjKise. The
land boundary has already been fixed and marked
from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the
Georgian Bay. It should be now in like manner
marked from the Lake o( the Woo ls t the sum
mit o 'he Reeky Mountains.
ALABAMl CLAIMS.
1 ivgrtrt to say that no conclusion ha.1 been
reached for the adjufctuifnt ot the claims against
Great Britain growing out of the course adopted
by that government during the rebellion. The
Cabinet of London So far as its views have t een
expressed, does not appear to be will id g to con
cede that Her Majesty's government was guilty
of negligence, or did, or permitted any act during
war, by wh'ch the United States has a just cause
of complaint. I therefore recommend to Congre-s
to authorize the appointment of a commission to
take proof ot the amounts and t be ownership of
the c'aims, on notice to the repretetitative oi Iler
Majesty at Washington, aud that authority be
piven for the settlement of thea claims l the
Unit-d ftates, so that the governmet,t Khali haw
the ownership of tbe private cl'tiui, as
well as the ropon-ible control of ail tne de
mtnds against ureat Britain. It cannot be ne
cessaiy to add that whenever Her Majesty's gov
ernment ba'l entertain the desire lor a lull and
friendly adiustment of these claims the United
States will enter upon their consideration with an
earnest de-ire for a conclusion consist nt with the
honor and dignity of both nations.
CAXAPA AJiO TIIK FISHKHIKS.
The course pursued by the Canadian authori
ties towrd the fishermen of the United Sta'es
during the past season has not been marked by a
friendly feeling. By the first article of the Convwn
tiouof 1818. between i rett Britun and the United
States, it was agreed that the inhabitants of the
United States should have forever, in common
With British subjects, the right of taking hV-h in

t is not known that any condemnations have
oeen maae under this statute, snouia tne au
thorities of Canada try to enforce it.it will become
my duty to take such steps as may be necessary
to protect the rights of the citizens of the
United States. It has been tlaiiaed by Her
Majesty's officers that the nshiner vessels of the
united states nave no right to enter tne open
ports of the British possessions, - in North
America, except for the purposes of shelter and
reparing damages, or purchasing wood and
obtaining water. That they have no right to
enter at the British Custom Houses, or to trade
there, except for the purchaee ef wood aud
water, and that they must depart withiu 24
hours after notice to leave. It Is not known
that any seizures of a fishing vessel, carrj leg
the Unitea States flag has been made
under this claim so far as the claim is lounded
on an alleged construction of the Con
vention of 1818 cannot be acquiesced iu by the
United t-talcs. It is honed that it will not be
insisted upon by Her Majesty's Government.
DuriBg the conference which preceeded the
negotiation of the Conveation of 1818, the
British Commissioners nronosed to expressly
exclude the fishermen of the United States
from the privilege of carrying on trade with
any of His Brltanic Majesty's subjects residing
withiu the limits assigned for their use, and
8iso tht it should not be lawful for the vessels
of the United States engaged in the said fish
ery to have on board any goods, wares or mer
chandize whatever, except such as may be
neceesary for the prosecution of their voyages
to and from said fishina grounds, and any ves
sel of the United States which shall contravene
this regulation may be seized, condemned and
confiscated with her cargo. This proposition,
which is identical with the cone tract ion now
put upon the language of the Conventien, was
emphatically rejected by the American Com
missioners, and thereupon was abandoned by
the British Plcnipotentnvy, aud article oue, as
it stands in the Convention, was substituted.
If, however, it be said that this claim is founded
on provincial or colonial statutes, and not
npon the Convention, this Government cannot
but regardthem asjunfriendly, and in contraven
tion ot the spirit, if not oi the letter, of the
treaty, for the faithlul execution of which the
Imperial Government is alone responsible.
Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be
made by the Canadian authorities in the com
ing season, to repeat their ucneighboriy acts
toward our fishermen, I recommend you to con
fer upon the Executive the power to saepend,
by proclamation, the operation of the laws au
thorizing the transit of goods, wares and mer
chandize in bond across the territory of the
United S aces to Canada, and, further, should
each an extreme measue become necessary, to
suspend the operation of any laws whereby the
vessels of the Dominion of Cansda are permit
ted to enter the waters of the United States.
THE NAVIGATION OF THE ST. LA WHENCE. :
A like unfriendly disposition has been mani
terted on the Dart of cauada in the maintenance
of a claim of the right to exclude the citizens of
the United States irom the navigation ot the bt.
Lawrence. This river constitutes a natural
outlet to the Ocean lor eignt States, with an ag
gregate population oi aDout n,buu,uuu lnnaDii
ants, and with anaggregate tonnage of 6,011,36"
tons noon the waters which discharge into it.
The Ioreign commerce of our ports in these
waters is oDen to British competition, and the
maior nart of it is done in British bottoms. If
the American s amen be excluded from this
natural avenue to the ocean, the menopoly of
the direct commerce ot tne Lake ports witu
the Atlantic would be in foreign hands ; their
vessels on transatlantic voyages having an ac
cess to our Lake ports which would be denied to
American vessels on similar voyages. To state
such a Dronoaition Is to refute its justice. Dur
ing the administration of John Ouincy Adams,
Mr Clay unquestionably demonstrated the na
tional right of the citizens of the United States 10
the navigation ot this river, claiming that the
action of the Congress of Vienna in opening the
Rhine and otber rivers to all nations, showed
the mdgmeut of European larlsts and states
men that the inhabitants of a country through
which a navigable river Dasses have a natural
right to enjoy ihe navigation of thai river to and
into the sea, even though passing through tbe
territory of another power. This right does
not exclude the co-eaual right of the sovereign
possessing the territory through which the river
dcDonenes into tne sea to maKe sucn regula
tions relative to the police of the navigation as
may be reasonably necessary, but those regula
tion should De iramea in a uoerai spirit oi com-
itv. and should not impose needless burdens
upon the commerce winch hi? the right of tran
sit. it. has tpn fount la practice more advan

agreement. Ihe United ntates are ready to

Clay was just when the population ol ti.e biates
Uorderinpr on tne shores of the lakes was only
3.4UtMMu. it now derives greater force and equity
from the increased population, wealth, production
and tonnate ot the estates on tne Canadian fron
tiers, bince Mr. Clay advanced his argument in
behalf ol our tight, tbe puncipal of which he con
teuded, has been frequently and by various
nations recognized by law ai d treaty, and has
been extended to several otuer great rivers.
By the treaty concluded at Mayence iu 1831
the Khiae was declared free Irom the point where
it is tint naviirabld to the sea. By the conven
tion between Spain and Portugal, concluded in
183,), tbe navigation of the Uouro, throughout its'
whoie extent, was made free for the subjects ot
both crowns. Iu 1853 the Argentine Comedera-
tton by treaty then opened the free navigation of
the Parana and Uraguay to the inerchaLt
vessels oi ail i at ions, iu Lti.id tbe Crimean war
Closed by a treaty which provided for the free
navigation of tne Danube. In 1858 Bolivia by

prm uples of national law, as highwajsor chan
nels, opened by nature for tbe commerce of all
nations. In liSU the t araguay was made free by

Ol 11 J jjiilElK. t.
Ota depressed commerce i a subject to which
I called o ir special attention at the last session
and suggested luui wc wm, in the luturc, nav
to looii more to tho countries South of us, and
to China and Japan for its renewal. Our repre
sentatives to all these governments have exerted
their influence to encourage trade between the
United States and the countries to which they
arc accredited, but the met exists that the carry
ing is done aloiost entirely iu foreign bottoms,
and while this suite of affairs exists we cannot
control cur due share of tho commerce of the
World, that between the Pacific States and
China and Japan i- about all the carrying trade
conducted in American vessels, l would recom
mend a liberal policy toward that Hue of Ameri
can steamers, oue that will msiirc its eucces
and even increased usefulness.
The cost of building iron vessels, the only
ones that can compete with f oreign ships in
the carrying trade, is so much greater in the
United States than in Foreign countries, that
withoutiiomc assisiauce Irom the government
thev cannot be successfully built here. There
will be several propositions laid before Cou
grcss in the course ot the present session, look
ing to a remedy for this evil, even ifit should be
at some cost to the National Treasury. I hope
such encouragement will be given as will secure
American snipping on tne nign seas ana Amen
can ship building at home.
STATE DEFABTMENT.

giess The building now occupied by that de
partment is a frail structure, at an inconvenient
distance Irom the Executive Mansion and the
other departments It Is 111 adapted to the pur

to aecommodate the archives, and is not tire

struction, and the absence of a supply of water

of safety for the building or i's contents in case
of tbe accident of a fiie. Its destruction would
involve the loss of the rolls containing the orig

historic records of the Revolution, and
of the confederation of the whole series
of diplomatic and consular archives siuce
the adopt on of the coustitrition, and of
the many other valuable r cord and papers left

depository oi tne governmental archives,

I recommend to your consideration the
propriety of referring to the Depart

more appropriately to belon, all powers and
duties iu relati n to the territories with which
the Department of State is now charged by liw
or Usage, and from the Interior Departmeut to
the War Department the Pension Bureau, so
far as it regulates the payment of soidiors' pen
sions. I would lurther recommend that the
payment of naal pensions be transferred to one
oi the bureaus ot tne JNavy uepartmenr.
FINANCIAL AFFATBS.
The estimates lor the expenses of the Gov
ernment lor the next fiscal year are $is,2M,346
less than for i ho current one, but exceed the
aonronriation 'or the present year for the
same items 88,972.127.58. In this estimate, how
ever, is included $3:1,333,273.37 for public works
heretofore beguu under congressional pio
visions and of which only so mm h is asked as
Congress may choose to give. The appropri
ation for the same works lor the present hsoal
year wa $11,931,518.1)8. .
The average value of gold as compared wit h
national currency f jT the whole year of 1S69
was about 134, and lor seven months of 1870
the same relative value has been abont 115.
The approach to a specie basis is very gratify
leg, but the fact cannot be denied that the nil
stability of the vuliie of oar currency is preju
diced to our prosperity, and tends to keep up
prices to the detriment of trade. The evils of
a depreciated and fluctuating currency are to
great inat now wncn tne premium on goia nas
fallen so mnch it would seem that the time as
now arrived when by a wise and prndent legis
lation Congress should look to a policy which
would place our currency at par with gold at no
distant day. , f
llEVENCE RKFOriM. '
The tax collected from the people has been re
duced more than $30,000,000 per annum. By
steadiness in our present course there is no
reason why in a lew short years the national
tax gatherer mav not disanDear from the door
of the citizen almoit entirely with the revenue
stamp dispensed by postmasters in every com
munity ; a tax upon liquors of ad sorts, and to
bacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjust
ment of the tariff which will pnt a duty only on
those articles which we could dispense with,
known as luxuries, and on those which we use
more of than we produce, revenue enough may
ne raisea alter a lew years oi peace uu
ennsennent reduction of indebtedness
to fulfil all eur oblieations. a farther reduction
of expenses, in addition to a reduction of in
terest account may d reuea upon w maao m
practicable. JUevenue reiorm, if it means this,
has my hearty support. If it implies a collec-i
tion of all the revenue for the support orthei
Government, for the payment of principal anr!
interest of the public debt, pensions, etc.. by
directly taxing the people, then I am against
revenue reform, and confidently believe the
people are with me.
If it means (allure to provide the necessary
mesns to defray all expenses of the Govern
ment, and thereby repudiation of the public
debt and pensions, then I am still more opposed
to such kind of revenue reform.
Revenue reform has not been defined by any
of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems
to be accepted as something which is to supply
every man's wants without any cash or effort
on his part. .
A true revenue reform connot be made iu a
day, but must be the work of national legisla
tion and time. As soon as the revenue can be
dispensed with, all duties should be removed
from sugar, coffee, tea and other articles of
universal use not produced by ourselves. The
necessities of the country compel ns to collect
revenue from oar imports. An army of asses
sors and collectors is not a pleasant Sight to
the citizen; but that of a tariff for revenue is
necessary. Such a tariff, to far as it acts as an
encouragement to home products, affords em
ployment to labor at living wages, in contrast
to the cheap labor of the old world, and also
the development of home resources.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
Under the act of Congress of the loth of Jnly,
1870. the armv has graanallv been reduced, so
that on the let of January, 1871, the number of
commisonea officers ana men win not exceca
the nnmber contemplated by that law.
The War Department building is an old struc
ture, not fireproof, and entirely inadequate in
diminsions to our present waiitf . Many thou
sands of dollars are now paid annually for rents
of private buildings to accommodate the vari
ous bureauB of the department. 1 recommend
an appropriation for a new War Department
building, suited to the present and growing
wants of the nation.
The renort of the Secrctarv of War shows a
very satisfactory reduction in the expenses of
tne army tor tne last nscai year, c or aetans
you a:-e referred to his accompanying report.
THE NAVT.
The exnenses ot the navvfor tbe whole of the
last vear. from December 1st. 1869. the date of
the last report, are less than 19,O00.0Oj, or about
$1,000,000 less than they were the previous
year. The expenses since the commencement
of this fiscal, that is since July 1st, show for the
five months a decrease of over $2,4uO,000 from
those of the corresponding months oi last year.
The estimate for the current vear was $28,205,-
671 37, those for next year is $20,683,317, with
$955,100 additional for necessary permanent im
provements. These estimates are made closely
for the mere maintenance of the naval establisn
ment, as it now is without much in nature of
permanent improvement, ine appropriations
made bv Congress for the last and current years
were evidently intended by Congress as suffi
cient only to keep tne navy on its present loot
ing, bv repairing and refitting of our old ships,
This policy must of course gradually but surely
destroy the navy, and it is in itself far from
economical, as each vear that it is pursued the
necessity for more repairs in ships and navy
vards became more imperative ana more costly.
and our current expenses are annually increas-

KDCCATION ,ASD AORlCtXTTaK.
The subjects of education and agriculture are
of great interest to the success of our Republican
institutions and to our happiness and grandeur as
a nation. In the interest of one a bureau has
been established in the Interior Department.
The Bureau of Education and in the interest of
the other a sepai ate Department, that of A ericul-
ture. I believe that ereat saneral eood is to flow
from the operations of both of these bureaus if
properly fostered. X cannot commend to your
careful consideration too highly, thejreport of the
commissioners of Education and Agriculture, nor
urge too strongly such liberal legislation as to
secure their efficiency.

On Sund-iy evening at about half-past
seven, a barn containing a smull quantity
of bay and other combustible materials,
a few feet in tho rear of the druur store on
ihe eat--t ciJe of the park, was diaeovertd
to be on fire. The congregations asem
bled in the different plucis of worship,
nori other citizens immeaiately rushed to
the spot, some to render ast-i-danee in pro-
tec' iug tho other property in the vicinity.
and others merely to hxk on. As no fire
engina was owned in town, nor fire hooks
or 1 ulderr", except a vry few owned by
private individuals, aud on account of tbe
scarcity of war.r iu the welln and cisterns,
aud with uo puhlio reservoir or water
8urplv. it was for some time feared
that
a general conflagration, embraeiug tbe
dwellings and stores north and south,
would mock all the tff.irts'thit could be
made in its reistanco.
Tbe barn was soon consumed, the
flime in the meantime extended to the
building owned by Dr. C. Smith, the up

for his family residence and dentistry,

The direct losses by the fire are est i-

aai furniture, f 4,500 to f 5,000, insured
3.500 ' Mr. Kellogg's drug store goods j
partly si ved, lo covered by insurance;
Mr. Kellogg' clothing and Mr. Pills' ji w
clry probably mostly saved; Mr. Cran
dall's printing materials and household
goods valued at $5,000, tbe power press
destroyed, and other materials, to a great
extent, rendered uselee, insurance f 3,500;
Mr. Peck's building and furniture, valued
at 3,800 to 14,000, insurance f 2,600.
Besides these losses, the injury to the
bank building is estimated at 200 or
more, and tbe loss by Dr. Wakefield, F.
ILSheppard & Co., and TLos. Hngbes,
in damage done to goods by removal is
estimated at $200 each, besides material
damage to property in tbe building own
ed by Mr. Graves.
Tbe new brick building of the Fair-
haven National Bank, which stood but
fifteen feet north of the drag store, being
nearly fire-proof, escaped but with little
injury, and served as a protection to- the
dwelling of Dr. Wakefield, bat a few feet
farther north, and others in the same di
rection altho' it required constant effort
to protect the windows which had not re
ceived tbe blinds that bad been ordered.
The block owned by Mr. Graves, 10 feet
south of Peck's block, wca saved, and
with it the adjacent bnildicgs, including
dwellings and stores on the south, by
some heroic citizens who fought the de
vouring element with most extraordinary
exertions, having only their hands and
pails of water and two small instruments
with hose used rs window-washers and
forsprinkling gardens, until the arrival of
the fire engine from Castleton with its
firemen, who arrived just in time to ten
der their material aid in saving so large
an amount of property, and who will not
be forgotten by our grateful citizens.
There are various conjectures concern
ing the origin of the , but tbe prevail
ing opinion is, in view of all tbe facts.
that it was the work of incendiaries.
But for the slate roofs on the buildings
near by, and the stiUnecs of the evening,
with tbe fire proof bank building on the
north, the conflagration would have been
terrible.
A village meeting bad already been
called for Monday evening, for election of
6fficers of tbe corporation and otber busi
ness. Tbe provision of water and a fire
engine will probably not be much longer
neglected. A.

Castleton. The "Westover HoteL'
an ancient landmark of seir m century,
located near tbe corner of Main and Sem
inary streets, which was consumed br
fire, was insured in Ludlow Company
lor $4000 by M. J. Francisco of Rutland,
Agent This bouse has a seventy years
history as a hotel, and its proprietors
have been A. W. Hyde. S. Reed. ITrde
Westover, R. H. Mortis, S. S. Skinner,
William C. Hyatt and Frank Sanford.
Mr. Westover owned and occupied it for
nearly thirty-three years as a proprietor
and successful landlord. Mr. Loveland's
building, which was moved away to save
it from distraction" was insured in the -Vermont
Mutual Insurance Company for
$400. He has been offered $300 for the
site but asks $400, which is at the rate of
$1000 per acre. Our people generally
desire that a business block should be
erected on the vacant corner. The men
of wealth and business iu Castleton should
give this matter attention at once.
-A farmer in our town has for sale
the product of the present season, of a
farm of between three and four hundred
acres, 70 tons of hay and SCO bushels of
oats. The farm is a good one aitnoogn
located some distance from the village.
Another who has 700 acres, who usually
etores iu his barn, which is the largest in
the country, about 200 tons of bay, did
not cut tbe past season only a third of a
crop, and is compelled to send 40 cows
from tbe farm tc be kept for tbe winter.
The fourth reservoir of cue hundred
hogsheads is nearly completed on Main
street. It took two hours for the new
engine "Eagle" to exhaust one of tbe
reservoir on Friday last. Our village will
at an early day be in good condition for
extinguishing fires, ttere is, however, a
short supply of water.
The people cf Csstleton are under
obligations to the General Assembly for
their continued aid to the Normal School
located here. They were neither disap
pointed or displeased at the fate of the
UState Police Bill, as it was regarded both
tyrannical and oppressive, although a
petition was quietly circulated here prey
ing for its enactment, but thirty names
were obtained.
Rev. E. G. Williams, Principal of
the Normal School, has been quite ill for
two weeks past, but is now gradually im
proving. The oil painting alluded to a few weeks
since as being presented by a husband to
a worthy wife ss a birth-day gift, was pro
cured at an expense of $500, and cot $200
as then stated. The gifted artist resides
at C is tie ton.
A few of our people are eager to
throw off their coats with shovel in hand
and throw dirt for the contemplated canal
between Whitehall and Rutland.
On Sunday evening about seven
o'clock, an alarm of fire resounded through
our village, religious meetings of the vil
lage was iu progress at three of the
churches and the congregations were
speedily in the street. The question
arose where the fire was. Some supposed
at Castleton Corners, others at Hydeville
or Fairhaven. It proved to be a destruc
tive fire at Fairhaven. Oar two engines
were quickly on the road, and it is report
ed they performed good service in finally
staying the conflagration. B. W. B.
