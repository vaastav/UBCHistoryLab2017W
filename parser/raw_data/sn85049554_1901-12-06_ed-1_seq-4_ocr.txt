7 BIG CATTLE SHOWS.
''*'chlcago has entertained a greater
crowd of farmers, cattlemen and ranch
men this week than has been seen on
lier streeta for years, the occasion being
the two great live stock shows, the In
tematlonal Live Stock Exposition and
the National Live Stock Exposition.
Thousand* of farmere and cattlemen,
ranchmen with broad sombreros and
high top boots, whose homes are where
they hang their hats, and m»n who have
grown rich and own large tracts of
land and great herds of cattle, have been
enjoying the opportunities offered. Dele
gates and visitors have been so numer
ous that Secretary Wilaon Bpoke of them
as acres of people.
In the big exposition buildings speci
mens. of the finest cattle, hogs, horses
Mid other animals have been seen at
their best. Their owners have been
striving for honors and prizes, and for
the lion's share of attention from the
4
gaping crowds of city folk.

What surprises many of the city folk
Is that then who, by their dresfe, would
stteta to be In need of th« price for food
or drink will step up to the auction
stool and bid 16,000 and more for a single
bullock, then dig down Into their boots
or generous pockets and produce a bank
roll which "can spare the thousands
without losing Its size.
The exposition has been declared by
com* judges to be the largest and finest
of its kind in the history of the live
stock industry, and incidentally it ha*
traded to show that Chicago is the great
cattle center of the world, and that it Is
the financial And shipping heart of the
Industry.
tCOROHY IN LI8HT AND FUEL
The economies that are constantly be
ing effected Hi the use of fuel and light
are noteworthy and satisfactory fea
turss of the present progressive era. The
other djfty reference was made to a new
ly Invented soft coal stove that will con
sume smoke and revolutionise heating
in this direction. New ligtrtlng plants
with gas from gasoline are supplanting
the old coal gas fixtures. In town a cin
gle house or an entire block may be
vPeaply heated *nd lighted from one
plant.
The recent development of many oil
elis has led to the use of this oil as a
fuel tn new direction* It Is announced
that the Santa Fe railway has. ill .Its
-engines in California equipped with oil
burners and Is consuming at present
about 600,000 barrels of oil a year. The
Southern Pacific by the end of this year
.. .will have 932 engines in service, and all
«.wlll be using oil as fast as they can be
converted into oil burners. When com
pleted these engines will consume near
ly 5,000,000 barrels a year. It is possible
that newer methods may even effect
economy in the amount consumed.
It would seem from the present out
look that the supply of ihis fuel oil is
.assured for many years. The Texas field
i-.y
Ufa* Bfcauraont still shows surprising
results. 9- F. Close, who. has Just re
turned from that section of the state, is
quoted by the Algona Upper Des Moines
as stating that up to date about 10*
wells have struck olL They are all in a
tract a mile square, called Spindle Top
r-
Hill, about four mllea out of Beaumont.
These will average 1,060 feet in depth.
The main pipe is twelve inches, but the
last few )iundre4 feet are drilled in solid
'.' rock and the hole Is on Of tlx inches
across "Whin oil is ttruclrlt comfcs but
with terrific force. It is thought the oil
would without any plplnfcs above the
(VsurtSoe of the ground go 200 feet high.
The first gusher opened still flows with
undiminished velocity, yielding 100,000
barrel's a day.
Ifcta Texas oil is used for ftiel'now, al
tfco the Standard Oil Company tests
Show it contains SO per cent of illuml
nattngotfland 15 per cent,if asphalt. It
will be. worth 9# cents a barrel to make
Illuminating oil of, and sells now at 30
cents a barrel. It to used' in factories
and similar institutions. Furnaces have
fceeh arranged by which it Is forced into
'a generator by steam and then turned
Into a gaa that burns without smoke or
smell. All who use it are saving over
two-thirds on their fuel bill besides haV
ing a clean and pleasant fuel to handle.
The poifats which commend these new
departures in lighting and heating are
first ^f all cheapness, and then cleanll
ness sad ease in handling. Such deslra
Me features are bound to effect ft revo
lution.
lAVINfl, DIP(HlT8 AND BANKING IN.
A CREASE,
The banking statistics of the United
States and of the European-nations are
such ts to show great increases in the
amount of money and deposits, here and
abroad. The report of the comptroller
of
lcfa£rfehcy
shows tbit" the various
state, national, savings and private
,i banks and trust companies have over
|8,G0t,000,000 on deposit, a sum So enor-
jhitai that it is hard to grasp."
Comparing the volume of business of
the savings banks of the United States
wlth those of the Shiropean countries,
the report shows that In the matter of
deposita the UnHed State^ as for years
j*stt«aad»at the head, with 2,810, W0,
W. Iki «wntry With the next largest
sunewt of savings deposits Is Germany,
with $1,900,000,000. Auatrla-Hungary
follows, With $l,i!01,240,000. The savings
deposits In the banks of Francc and the
Ubited Kingdom are $864,220 000 and
5829,020,000, respectively. The unly oth
er countries with savings deposits of
$200,000,000 or over are^ Russia, Belgium
and Switzerland. ft1
The average amount to the credit of
depositors In savings banks is greatest
in the United States, namely, $406.23.
The average in Canada is $340.24 In
Austria-Hungary, $221.59 Denmark,
$168.80 in Switzerland and Australia,
$153.84 and $153.30, respectively Servia
and Greece, $150.64 and $150.32, respect
ively Spain, $142.13 Norway, $124.96,
and Russia, $100.!!4. In no other country
doasi the average deposit exceed $100.
The greatest average deposit per In
habitant is shown in Denmark, the
amount being $77.88. In Switzerland the
average is $65.06 Germany, $37.^4 Nor
way, $37.16 Australia, $36.60 Belgium,
$31.76 United States, $31.22 Austria
Hungary, $27.08 Sweden, $25.36 France,
$22.18 Great Britain, $20.62.
While the average amount hell by de
positors is greater In our nation, the fig
ures show that In the average amount
per inhabitant there are six European
nations ahead of us—a fact which shows
there is great need of educating ur peo
ple in the mattter of savings. ...
Relative to the banking powerJof the
world, the comptroller uses as a -baals
for his estimates the figures for 3.890 giv
en in the 1898 edition of the late M. G.
Mulhall's Dictionary of Statistic?, which
volume states the amounc Is approxi
mating £3,197,000.000. The banking pow
er of the United States has been aug-r
mented since 1890 by £1,249,00-),000, art
increase of 121 per cent. Aggregating
the banking power of the United King
dom and the Unlr.ed States with the es»
timated power of continental Europe
and other countries, an increase since
1890 is shown of £1,926,000,000, or 60 per
cent. In other words, the world's bank
ing power increased from £3,1)7,000,000
In 1890, to £5,128,000,000 in 1901.
In noticing these statistics one can not
help recalling the predictions cf Bryan
and the silver! tea, that the record would
be the other way, because of the reign
of the gold standard* on which theBe fig
ures are baaed.
*''-k SUCCESSFUL MAN'S OPINION.
The. life of an editor is a strenuous one
at best. From morning till night he Is
beset by special interests, largely per
sonal, peeking favors, and when he has
the courage to publish the truth as he
sees it he is sure of more strenuosity on
the following day when the complaints
are made. But often therfe comes float
ing into his office from sources least ex
pected brief words of encouw-gement,
such as the following, which drive away
all clouds and m«ke the life "oorth liv
ing. Mr, B. Plersol, a very successful
merchant and banker and an old resi
deflt of Rockwell, Iowa, remits $5 to the
T.-It with the following brief expres
sions of his vie we:
Rockwell, Iowa, Dec. 6, 1901.—Times
Republican—My Dear Editors: Here
with enclosed find draft for $5, the
amount of your demands on me. Many
thupiMt to you and your untiring efforts
to give the public: a good, clean, newsy
paper. I am one of your earliest sub
scribers. I have known the paper under
its various managements and, if you
will pardon me for the flattery, I must
say that It is fully up to, and In some
respects excels past publications. So

IOWA OPINIONS AND NOTES.
•fhe Falrflefd ]dger puts it in this
way: "There will be agitation this win
ter for the abolition of the petition fea
ture of the mulct law and the substitu
tion of the secret ballot. Why? In or
der that men who are afraid to go on
record on the saloon question may sneak
in ufcder the canvas."
THfe Carroll Herald notices that "the
county fair in Iowa is beginning to be
an extinct animal. It survives in some
quarters where the conditions are help
ful to a debilitated system. But it Is
gradually passing away and the chances
are,that it will be known in the future
only in the fossilized form."
In revising Jt® criticisms of education
al institutions the Nevada Representa
tive Is of the opinion that "the board of
control has come out of this scrimmage
with a very lame apology for grossly
unfair conduct."
The Newton Journal is of the opinion,
as it reads the glowing accounts of foot
ball games, that "when parents send
their children to college these days they
itiay expect them, if they become popu
lar, to receive honors for muscle and not
fer^thelr brains."
"The foot ball game' and the cigaret
are pretty good friends of the under
taker," declares the Waterloo Reporter.
In its estimate of the president's mes
sage the 81oux City Journal says:
"Thruout the paper there is a high mor
al tone, evincing a Just estimate of the
responsibilities tlbat fall to the lot of an
exalted public position. It would be
well if congress could imbibe this spirit
and give it dominance in legislative
work."
According to the Cedar Rapids Ga
sette, ''after reading the message care
fully the reda and trusts of New Jersey
will be able to arrive at the conclusion
that their rendcizcoUs is likely to be
raided."
The Eldora Herald observes that "the
republican party put the Chinese exclu
sion law on the (Statute books and there
has at no time been any reason to doubt
that the present .republican congress
would re-enact the law, notwithstand
ing the shouting' In certain quarters."
In noticing thut there will be a num-
ber of pardon cases before the Iowa leg
islature, the Clarion Monitor expresses
the belief that "as a rule It is a good
plan to go slow in granting freedom to
men who have been' convicted of serious
crimes, l^aws are passed for protection
of the public, and if men will violate
them they should pay the penalty."
Tho Burlington Gazette declares:
"The Chinese question Is not a new and
untried one. The country understands It
thoroughly from the experience of the
people of the Pacific coast. There are
already too many Chinese in the United
States."

|Important Decisions!
INSURANCE—NOTICE OF LOSS.
A substantial compliance with the
terms of a Are Insurance policy us to
notice and proof of loss is all that
Is required, and when notice of the
loss is given, even If it is not sworn
to, and an adjuster Is sent to investi
gate the loss, unless .a verification or
farther Information Is demanded by the
company, the objection that the notice
of ljoss is not verified Is waived. 66
Pacific Rep. (New Mexico, Judge Mills)
635.
DISBARMENT OF ATTORNEY.
In proceedings to disbar an attorney
at law for official misconduct, neglect
on the part of the attorney to notify
a client of the collection of money, or
neglect to Immediately pay over money
collected, may In certain circumstances
be reprehensible but it is not alone
sufficient ground for disbarment, if
there is an absence of fraud, trickery or
deceit.—66 Pacific Rep. (New Mexico,
Judge McMillan) 545.
WARRANTIES—ACETYLENE GAS,
An Interesting case on the subject
of the proper measure of damages for
breach of warranty recently arose in
the case of Tyler vs. Moody, decided
by the supreme court of Kentucky. The
plaintiff brought an action against the
defendant to recover for damages for
personal injuries caused by an explo
sion of gas generator for the manu
facture of acetylene gas, sold him by
defendant. It was claimed by the
plaintiff that the defendant "guaranteed
and represented to him at the time of
said sale, and as a part of the con
tract, that the machine, and the use
thereof in generating acetylene gaa,
was, and would be entirely safe, and
that no damage or Injury would or
could result therefrom. The court
held that the damages recoverable for
such a breach of warranty included
damages for personal injury to thq
buyer from an explosion of the ma
clnc, such damages being the naturaj
and probable result of a breach of the
warranty. 53 Central Law Journal,
422.
DIVORCE—CUSTODY OF CHIL­
DREN.
Articles of separation were signed by
parents, giving the custody of their
child, a girl of ten years, to the mother.
The latter subsequently obtained a di
vorce in Oklahoma, and, returning to
New York, married. The father
brought an action for divorce, charg
ing adultery in living under Buch mar
riage, and the Oklahoma divorce was
declared Invalid. After such decision
the mother continued to live with sec
ond hUBband until the case was af
firmed by the court of appeals, when
she ceased to cohabit with him. She
contracted such marriage, believing the
divorce was valid. The mother was
able to suport Rfid educate the child,
and the latter desired to remain with
her. The father morally was no better
than the mother. Held, that as the In
terests of the child will be best con
served by remaining with her mother, a
decree so awarding her custody, with
permission to the father to see her
weekly, will not be disturbed.—772 New
York Supplement, 456.
DRUGGISTS—DUTY AS TO MEDI-
CINEB.
A' druggist is held, in a Pennsylvania
case, not to be guilty of negligence In
selling to customers proprietary Medi
cines in the package and under1 the
label of the proprietor or patentee,
without making an analysis of the con
tents.—53 L. R. A., 329.
CEMETERIES—RIGHT TO REMOVE
BODY.
A man who has consented to the
burial of the body ot his deceased wife
in the lot of another Is held to have
no right to enter upon the lot and re
move the body.—53 L. R. A. (Maine),
288.
THE PREFERABLE CANAL ROUTE.
[Chicago Tribune.]
If the Panama canal people had been
willing to sell on reasonable terms—say
$40,000,000—the isthmian canal commis
sion might have recommended the adop
tion of that route. But they stood out
for over $100,600,000. That sum would
make the total coat of construction of
the Panama canal greater than that of
one by the Nicaragua route, which the
commission estimates now at $190,000,
000. The Frenchmen have made a' mis
take by making the purchase of their
interests impossible. Whether they can
raise the money to flnleh their canal is
more than doubtful. If finished it would
not, when forced to meet the competi
tion of the Nicaragau canal, pay operat
ing expenses. The commission finds that
the Panama route has some advan
tages. The coat of operating and main
taining the canal wlil be $1,860,000 less
than by the other route. On the other
hand, the Nicaragua canal will be more
advantageous for all commerce save
that originating on the west coast of
South America. The commission esti
mates that with adequate force and
plant the Nicaragua canal can be com
plete^ In eight years, two of which will
be required for preparation. Probably
more time and money than have been
allowed for will be needed to complete
the work, but if the estimates are cor
rect an expenditure of $190,000,000 will
be spread over six years. This annual
expenditure of a little over $30,000,000
will not be a severe strain on the finan
cial resources of the United States., It
will not call for the levy of new taxes. It
should not be used as an argument
against the repeal of war taxes which
are producing revenue far In excess of
the needs of the government.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
"A strung ioi ino swallows to
coino back," sakl my lady, turning to
smilo at mo as I rodo on lior off side.
It would have been strango Indoed If
thore bad been swallows in tho air, for it
was the end of December. The roads
wero frost bound and the trees leafless.
The east wind, gathering force in its rush
across the Essex marshos, whirled before
it the last trophies of Hainault forest and
seemed as it whistled by our ears and
shaved our facos to grudge us the shelter
to which wo were hastening. Tho long
train behind us—for the good timos of
wheh we had talked so often had come—
were full of the huge flre wo expected to
find at tho inn at Barking, our lost stago
on the road to London. And if the duch
ess and I bore tho cold inoro patiently it
was probably bocause we had more food
for thought and perhaps thicker raiment.
"Do not shako your hoad," she con
tinued, glancing at mo with inlsohief in
her eyes, "and flatter yoursolf you will
not go bock, but will go on making your
self and some one else unhappy. You will
do nothing of the kind, Francis. Before
the spring oomes you and I will rldo over
the drawbridge at Coton End, or I am a
Dutohwomanl"
"I cannot see that things are changed,"
I said.
"Not ohangod?" she ropllod. "When
you left, you wero nobody. Now you are
somebody, if it be only in having a sister
with a dosen serving men in her train.
Leave it to me. And now, thank heaven,
we are here! I am so stiff and cold you
must lift me down. We hare not to ride
far aftor dinner, I hope."
"Only seven miles," I answered aa the
host, who bad been warned by an outrider
to expect us, came running out with a
tall at his heels.
"What news from London, Master Land
lord?" I said to him as he led ub through
tho kitchen, where there was indeed a
great fire, but no chimney, and so to a
smaller room possessing both these lux
uries. "Is all quletf"
"Certainly, your worship," ho replied,
bowing and rubbing his hands. "There
never was suoh an accession, nor more ale
drunk, nor powder burned—and I have
seen three—and there was pretty shouting
«t old Ring Harry's, but not like this.
Such a fair young queen, men report, with
a look of the stout king about her, and
as prudent and dlsoreet as if she had
changed heads with Sir William CeclL
God bless ber, say I, and send her a wise
husband!"
"And a loving one," quoth my lady
prettily. "Anion 1"
"I am glad all has gone off woll,"I
continued, spesking to the duobess aa I
turned to fbo biasing hearth. "If there
had been blows, I would fain have been
here to strike one."
"Nay, sir, not a finger has wagged
•gainst her," theIsndlord answered, kick
ing the logs together "to speak of, that
la, your worablp. I did bear today of a
little trouble down in Warwickshire, but
it Is no more than a storm in a washtub,
I am told
"In Warwlokihiref" I sAld, arrested In
the act of taking off my cloak by the fa
miliar name. "In what part, my manf"
"I am not clear about that, sir, not
knowing the oountry," he repllod, "bat I
heard that a gentleman there had fallen
fotil of ber grace's ordors sbout ehuroh
matters and beaten the ofleers sent to see
them carried out, and that, when the
sheriff remonstrated with him, he beat
him too. Bat I warrant they will soon
bring him to his senses."
"Did you bear his name?" I asked.
Then was a natural misgiving in my
mind. Warwickshire was large, snd yet
something In the tale smacked of Sir An
thony.
"I did hear It," the host answered,
soratehing his hsad, "but I cannot eall it
to mind. I think I should know It if I
heard It."
"Was it Sir Anthony Cluddef"
"It was that very same name!" he ex
claimed, clapping his bsnis in wonder.
"To be sure! Yoar worship has it pat!"
I slipped book Into my elosk again ond
snatched up my bat and whip, but the
duchesh wss as qoiek. She stepped be
tween me and the door.
"Sit down, Franolq!" she said imperi
ously. "What would you bo at?"
"What would I be at!" I cried, with
emotion. "I would he with my unole. I
shall take horse at ohoe and rid& Watwlok
sblre way with all speed. It is possible
that I may be in time to avert the conse
quenoes. At least 1 can see that my cousin
oomes to no harm."
"Good lad," aha said placidly, "you
shall start tomorrow."
"Tomorrow?" I cried Impatiently. "But
time is everythlnf, madam."

Nothing! No mors than if the thing had

You will do this for me?" I exclaimed,
leaping up and taking her hand, for I saw
in a moment the wisdom of the course she
proposed. "You will get me"—
"I will get you something to the pur

her hand, "though I have to take Master
Secretary by the beard!"
Late, as I have heard, on the afternoon
of Nov. 80, 1658, a man riding between
Oxford and Worcester with the news of
tho queen's death caught sight of the gate
way tower at Cston End, whioh is plainly
visible from the road. Though he had al
ready drunk that day as much ale aB
would have sufficed him for a week when
the queen was well, yet much wants moro.
He calculated he bad time to atop and
taste tho squire's brewing, which he
judged, from the look of the tower, might
be worth his news, and he rode through
the gate and railed at his nag for stum
bling.
Half way aoross the chase he met Sir
Anthony. The old gentleman was walk
ing out, with his staff in his band and bis
dogs behind him, to take tho air before
supper. $be matt, while he was still a
hundred paoea off, began to wave his hat
and shout something whioh ale and ex
oltement rendered unintelligible.
What is the matter?" said Sir Anthony
to himself, and he stood still.
"The qneeu la dead!" shouted the mes

"Aye, sure!" he ejaculated after awhile,
and ho took off bis hat. "Is it true,

"As true as that I left London yestor

threo days on tho road and had drunk ot
every liostol and at half the manor houses
between London and Oxford.
"God rest her soul!" said Sir Anthony
piously, still In somewhat of a maze.
"And do you come in! Come In, man,
and take something."
But the messenger had got his formula
by heart and was not to be defrauded of
any part of It.
"God save tbequoon!" he shouted, and
out of respect for tho knight ho slipped
from his saddle and promptly fell on his
back in the rood.
"Aye, to bo sure, God save the queen!"
echoed Sir Anthony, taking off hla hat
again. "You aroright, man!" Then he
hurried on, not noticing the messenger's

of such importance, and he was so anxious
to tell them to hia household-tfor the
greatest men have weaknesses, and news
such as this comes seldom in a lifetime—
that he strode on to the house and over the
drawbridge Into the courtyard without
looking behind him.

There was a cheer, a fairly loud cheer,
but there was ope who did not join in it,
and that was Petrpnllla. She, listening
at her lattice up stairs, began at once to
think, as waa her habit when any matter
great ot small fell out, whether this would
affect the fortunes of a certain parson far
away. It might, it might not. She did
not know. But the doubt so far enter
tained her that she dame down to supper
with a heightened color, not thinking in
the least, poor girl, that the event might
have dire consequences for others almost
as dear to her and nearer home.
Every year since his sudden departure a
letter traim Frauels Gludde had come to
Coton—a meager letter, whleh had pasaed
through many hands and reached Sir An
titonj' now through one channel, now
throngh another. The knight grumbled
and sfrore over these letters, which never
contained an address to whleh ao answer
could be forwarded, nor said raueb, save
that the writer *as well and sent hie love
and duto and looked to return, all being
well. But, meager aa they were and loud
aa he swore over them, he put them reli
giously away Id an oak ohest in his parlor,
and another always put away for her share
something elae, which waa invariably in
closed—a tiny swallow's feather. The
knight never aaid anything about the
feather, neither ashed the meaning of Its
presence ner commented upon Its absence
wben Petronllla gave bim back the letter.
But for 4ays after each of these arrivals
he would look mush at his daughter,

more regular in bidding her attend him

Bhe wasted away. But she did take a more
soribUB and thoughtful air in these days,
whioh she never, God bless ber, lost after
ward. There came from Woottoa Wawen
and from Henley in Arden and from
CookbiU gentlemen of excellent eetate to
woo her, but they all went away discon
solate after drinking very doeply of Sir
Anthony's ale and Btrong waters. And
some wondered that the good knight did
not roundly take the jade to taak and see
ber settled.
But he did not. So poaalbly evon in
these days he had other views. 1 have
been told that, going up once to her little
obamber to seek her, he found a very sin
gular ornament suspended inside her lat
tice. It was no other than a common clay
house martin's no6t, but it was ao deftly
hung in a netted bag ahd so daintily
swathed in mesa alwaya green and the
Christmas rosea and anowdropa and violets
and daffodils,whieh decked it in turn wero
always so pure and fresh and bright—as
the knight learned by more than one
stealthy visit afterward—that, coming
down tho steep steps, ho could not see
clearly and stumbled against a cookboy
and beat him aoundly for getting in his
way.
To return, howevor. The nowa of the
queen's death had scarcely been well di
gested lit Coton, nor the mass for her soul,
which Father Carey celebrated with much
devotion, been properly criticised, before
another surprise fell upon the household.
Two strangers arrived, riding, late oil'
evening, and rang the great bell while all
were at supper. Baldwin and the porter
went to see what It was and brought bark
a message Which drew the knight from
his choir as a terrier drawe a rat.
Yon are drunk!" he shouted, purple
emergencies. "How dare you bring cock
and bull stories to mo?"
"It is true enough!" muttered Baldwin
sullenly, a stout, donr man, not much
afraid of his master, but loving him ox
cecdingly. "I knew him agin myself."
Sir Anthony strode firmly out of the
room, and in the courtyard near the great
gHto found a man and a woman standing
in the dusk IIo walked up to the former
and looked him in the faco. "What do
you here!"' he said In a strange, hard
voicc.
"I want shelter for a nlglit for myself
and my wife, a meal and some woi'dswith
you—no more," was tho answer. 0!lve
mo this," tho stranger continued, "which
evory idle passerby may claim at Coton
End, and you shall see no more of me,
Anthony."
For a moment tho knight seemed to
hesitate. Then ho answered, pointing
sternly with his hand: "There Is tho hall,
and supper. Go and cat and drink, or
stay!" bo resumed. And he turned and
gave some orders to Baldwin, who went
swiftly to tho hall, and In a moment came
again. "Now, got What you want tho
servants will prepare for you."
"I wantvspeech of you," said the new-:
comor.
Sir Anthony seemed about to refuse,
but thought better of it. Eou can como
to my room when you have supped," he
said in the same ungracious tone, speaking
with hla eyes averted.
"And you—do you not take supper?"
"I have finished," said the knight, al
beit he had eaten little. And ho turned
on his heel.
Very few of those who eat rouna the
table and watdhed with astonishment the
tall stranger's entranoe know him again.
It was 18 yeara sinoe Ferdinand Cludde
had last sat thore—sitting thare of right.
And the 18 years had worked muohchange
In him. Whon be found that Petronllla,
obeying ber father's messago, had disap
peared, he said haughtily that his wife
would sup In ber own room, and with a
flashing eye and curling lip bade Baldwin
seo to it. Then, seating himself in a place
next Sir Anthony's, he looked down the
board at which all sat silent. His sarcas
tic eye, bis high bearing, his manner—the
manner of one who had gono long with
his life In his hand—awed tbebo simple
folk. Then, too, be was a Cludde. Father
Carey was absent that evening. Martin
Luther bad one of those turns, balf sick,
half sullen, which alternated with bis
moods of merriment and kept his straw
pallet in some oorner or other. Tbero was
no one to come between the servants and
this dark viaaged stranger, who was yet
no stranger.
He had his way and his talk with Sir
Anthony, the latter lasting far into the
night and produoing odd results. In the
first place, the unbidden guest and his
wife staid on over next day and over
many days to come and seemed gradually
to grow more and more at home. The

knight began to take long walks and rides
with bis brother, and from each walk and
ride camo baok with a mora gloomy faoo
and a ourter manner. Petronilia, his oom
panlon of old, found herself set aside for
her uncle and east, for society,-on ^ordi

with the brilliant eyos, whose odd changes
from grave to gay rivaled Martin Luther's,
and who now soared the girl by wild
laughter and wilder gibes and now moved
her to pity by fits of weeping or dark
moods of gloom. That Uncle Ferdinand's
wifo stood in dread of her husband Pe
tronllla soon learned and even began to
share this dread, to shrink from his pres
ence and to shut herself up more and more
closely in her own chamber.
There was another, too, who gww to bs
troubled about this time, and that was
Father Carey. The good natumd,- easy
priest received with joy and thankfulness
tho news that Ferdinand Cludde had seen
his errors and re-entered the fold, but
whon be had had two or three interviews
with the convert bis brow, too, grew
