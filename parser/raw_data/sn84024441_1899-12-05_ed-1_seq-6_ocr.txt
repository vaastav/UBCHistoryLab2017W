TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1899.
A Grent Mnte Paper.
The message of the President of the
United States to the Fifty-sixth Congress,
presented and read In tha Senate and House
of Representatives today, is a document
which will live In history as one of the
ablest as well as one of the most Interest
ing and voluminous stats papers which has
ever emanated from the Executive Mansion.
On the strength of such a hasty glance at
Its recitals, arguments, and recommenda
tions as we have been able to give It since
the text was given to the press this morn
ing, we are much Inclined to call It a great
message. We have no doubt whatever that
it Is truly and fully so in many respects.
Of course it Is Impossible not to note
and to regret the radical -change of faith
and opinion shown by President McKlnley
in his remarks urging the Congress to
fasten the single gold standard collar on
the necks of the American people. But we
are charitable enough to remember that it
would have been impossible for him to
stand out against the whole power of his
party as the one blmetallist among its
controlling men. "Sure, Paris was worth a
mass!" said Henry IV, in explanation of
his defection from Protestantism. In much
the same way Mr McKinley may regard a
second term In the White House as com
pensatory for a departure from the princi
ples and pledges of an earlier day. There
is much humanity in all of us, and on this
particular occasion The Times will not
volunteer to cast the first stone.
The President congratulates Congress on
the prosperous state of the country, on the
fact that the combined exports and im
ports of the year past have been greater
than in any year of our history. He says:
"Our exports for 1S99 alone exceeded by
more than a billion dollars our imports and
exports combined in 1ST0. The imports per
capita are twenty per cent less than in
1ST0, while the exports per capita are fifty
eight per cent more than in IS70, showing
the enlarged capacity of the United States
to satisfy the wants of its own increasing
population, as well as to contribute to
those of the peoples of other nations." Mr.
McKlnley is entitled to feel and to express
a high degree of gratification and thank
fulness for a condition of progress and
prosperity which results from the revivify
ing effects of a national war undertaken
for humanity, which reunited the country
in the bonds of a common noble purpose
and brotherhood, and which brought the
United States at one bound from a condi
tion of remote provincialism to the status
of a great imperial world power.
The strength of the Treasury is com
mented on with evident pride. The deficit
for tho fiscal year amounted to IS9.111,
G59.67. The Secretary of the Treasury es
timates that at the end of the ensuing fis
cal year this will be changed to a surplus
of i0,000,000. On December 1, 1899, the
available cash balance in the Treasury was
$278,001,837.72, of which $239,744,905.36 was
in gold coin and bullion. The Xovember
bond purchases for the sinking fund,
amounting to $18,40S,COO, are referred to.
Tho premium paid aggregated $2,263,521,
and the saving of Interest was about $2,
85,000. Congress is asked to amend the
National Banking act so as to permit the
organization of banks -with a capital "of
$25,000, the present minimum being $50,000.
Mr. McKinley strenuously urges that "to
support the existing gold standard," the
Secretary of the Treasury be vested with
discretionary power to sell United States
bonds and to employ other means to the
end. "While there is now. no Com
mercial fright which withdraws gold
from the Government fl the
situation points to the present
as the most fitting time to make adequate
provision to ensure the continuance of the
gold standard." The Intelligent reader will
not fall to remember that the Bank of
France for long years maintained parity in
a much more scientific and effective way
than that of giving a finance minister un
limited power to increase the national debt
at will; but we shall not discuss the matter
here.
Encouragement and aid for the Ameri
can Merchant Marine is recommended, and
the humiliating conditions which call for
reform are referred to. This is a question
as to which means and not ends will give
rise to difference of opinion.
The question of legislation In restraint
of trusts Is treated at some length and in
apparent agreement with popular views on
the subject. The recent decision of the
United States Supreme Court -in the Ad
dyston Pipe Trust case, seems to render it
possible for Congress to place a strong
check upon the growth of combinations in
restraint of trade, without much difficulty.
The message on this topic appears to have
the true ring and it would be hardly fair
to throw doubt on its bona fides.
The section devoted to foreign relations
Is Interesting. It tells of various wars,
revolutions, and so on, among our Amer
ican neighbors, sundry commercial agree
ments and treaties; .refers to the Nicarau-
eua Canal project and the confusion ol
Tights and interests under concessions from
that state,- and renews tomer represent-
tlons as to the Importance ot the work. The
extension of our trade with China is treat
ed as a matter for congratulation, and the
President says with decided significance:
"Our trade -with China has continued to
grow, and our commercial rights under
-existing treaties have been everywhere
maintained during the past year, as they
will be In the future." This Is good,
straight from the shoulder, and worth a
ream of diplomatic circumlocution. It
means the open door for America, peace
ably or otherwise, as plainly as 'anyone
could ask. The Paris Exposition is mildly
boomed, and the Alaskan bdundaiy ques
tion handled rather gingerly. The war in
South Africa Is "regretted, and the state
ment made that if, before the outbreak of
hostilities, the combatants had asked for
the good offices of the United States, the
same would have been found available.
The troubles in Samoa and their amicable
settlement through the partition ot the
group between the United States, Great
Britain and JGermany, are all clearly set
forth.
Mr. McKinley is to be commended for
the clearness and justice of the position
he assumes in regard to our position in
Cuba. Reaffirming his adherence to the
pledgesjnade to the Cuban people, he says
that this .nation has assumed grave re
sponslbillty before the world for the fu
ture good government of Cuba: "The new
Cuba yet to arise tram the ashes of the
past must needs be bound to us by ties of
singular intimacy and strength it Its en
during welfare is to be assured.
Our mission, to accomplish which we took
up the wager of battle, is not to bo ful
filled by turning adrift any loosely framed
commonwealth to fact; the -vicissitudes
which too often attend weaker states whose
natural wealth and abundant resources
are offset'by the incongruities of their po
litical organization and the recurring oc
casions for internal rivalries to sap their
strength and dissipate their energies."
The piece de resistance of the message
is the portion devoted to the Philippines.
The President handles this topic freely,
frankly, and with splendid force. He re
cites the history of the acquisition, of the
insurrection, and of his efforts to quell
it; reminds Congress that it is not yet en
tirely crushed, and that until it shall be
the military arm will have to be supreme
in the archipelago; refers to the forthcom
ing report ot the Philippine Commission,
which will be sent in as soon as received,
and promises notice when the time has
come for the establishment of civil govern
ment, consideration ot plans for which he
recommends at the early convenience ot
the nation's lawgivers.
We have only attempted to skim over
tho message, omitting many subjects In
cluded in It, for future discussion. As w'e
have before said, it is a strong and able
state paper, and we are unable to find a
weak-kneed line In it on any ot ths matters
which Involve the iionor of the flag or the
interests or Imperial position of the United
States anywhere on the face of the earth.
Still Trnr.klnjg Asjnlnnldo.
If Brigadier General Young does not have
Agulnaldo safely caged'beforc many days.
It will not be for want of trying. At lat
est advices the Tagal leader was believed
to be hidden In a mountain pass both ends
of which are fortified. If our troops come
up with him, ho will hardly make much
ot a fight. Battle Is not to his taste, but
friendly negotiation Is. He will be very
apt to offer some liberal proposition of
barter or sale as a condition precedent to
surrender.
Agulnaldo has never been able to disa
buse his mind of the Idea that ultimately
the United States would buy him off. Spain
gave him four hundred thousand dollars to
stop rebelling and leave the Philippines.
Why should not America, vastly richer
than Spain, give him five or six millions
with the same object In view. If this Ma
lay conspirator had only known a little
mere about the Anglo-Saxon character, he
would have realized the hopelessness of
his hold-up scheme of revolution and prob
ably It would not have been attempted. He
merely rebelled In order to sell out to us
as formerly he did to the Spaniards.
The chances for Aguinaldo"s capture ap
pear now to be excellent, but it is yet pos
sible that he may die fighting when finally
cornered. It is only a possibility, but one
to be regarded with equanimity. He would
be a very uncomfortable prisoner to have
around.
Relitrion on the Stnire.
A prominent member of the cloth has
risen in his New Tork pulpit to protest
against the representation of religion upon
the stage. After admitting that the the
atre may be the ally of the pulpit, ,and
acknowledging that it has some advantages
over the church, because it is not dog
matic, the preacher roundly assails the
play whose motive is religious, for the
staled reason that the object of the per
formance is to make money. The censor
further declares that the loftiest senti
ments of the human soul should not thus
be made the subject of commercial traffic. .
The worthy clergymen elaborates his dis
course by objecting to the performance
of religion in the glare of the footlights,
because, according to bis ideas, it tends to
promote skepticism. From his point of
view, it threatens to bring religion into
contempt. "The stage Is no true mirror of
life," he proclaims. "A mirror reflects
real things absolutely, but the stage merely
gives a reflection ot an Imitation. -Love
affairs and intrigues, ambition and social
conduct, -may- be properly put upon the
stage, for we are all able to understand the
necessary exaggerations. But we all know
how the portrayal of a religious hypocrite
on the stage has the tendency to prejudice
us against religion." The preacher pro
ceeds to specify some ot the scenes and
characers in a recent play with a strong re
ligious color, to which he is opposed on
the grounds already outlined.
The mission of the church, as it Is un
derstood, Is to eliminate the evil that is
inherent in mankind, not by exploiting
good to the exclusion of its opposite, but
by bringing them into such contrast that
human naturo will be repelled by that
which is vicious and espouse that which is
virtuous. If the stage has its faults, the
church has its hypocrites, but the true art
ot the one and the true faith ot the other
are not thereby In the least affected.
It is more than difficult to understand
how religion can be brought into contempt
by such representations as lave recently
been given and to which the worthy
churchman unquestionably .refers, and upon
which he hangs bis text. Had there been
the slightest-.attempt to "burlesque religi
ous ideals, to cast ridicule on true religious
aspirations, this ecclesiastical outburst
against such dramatic productions would
be Justifiable, but It is through these -very
productions that the playhouse seems to
have become the ally of the pulpit, as 'the
reverend critic has granted 'that it some
times is.
And, indeed, we might ask, 3s it not aa
agreeable shra of the times thai tho nnhltr
which has been no fr.nor.! yr.A
late tor aa aliegerj growing skepticism, ,U
willing ta patronise plays founded upon
Btrong religious themes and that the same
public has made them profitable to thoss
who nave given their art, thought, and
money for the productions, thus -paving the
way tor more dramatic enterprises ot a like
character?
But a strong demurrer Is filed; beci'use
the stage is said to be false, as a mirror ot
life, to reflect a mere imitation of the
things that happen- In the complex rela
tions of society. There are those, how
ever, who will beg to differ from thls.opln.
ion. Perhaps the stage has not even yet,
with Its marvelously long strides toward
perfection, reached its best development;
but as to its fidelity In depleting the joys
and the sorrows 'and the emotions of hu
manity, there might tie called to testify
the thousands of good men and women
who have viewed certain scenes from the
homespun dramas that have been for a
long time popular through a mist of tears.
The multitude have entered so heartily
into the Etories told behind the footlights
that they have temporarily lost themselves,
have smelted the new-mown hay, laughed
at the rustic wit, and grieved over the pa
thetic chapters just as they would" have
done had the characters been genuine and
the auditors In old 'New England instead
ot in the cushioned chairs of a city theatre.
Religion and morality were strong ingre
dients of these dramas, and the pulpit was
sufficiently liberal to credit them with, the
reformative influence, candidly admitting
that In many respects they were stronger
than sermons or church forms In their
touching and homely appeals to the way
ward. How many were actually turned
into the paths ot rectitude by such plays
will never be known, but there Is every
reason to believe that the influence of such
plays for good was not without Its fruits.
A further veto is entered by the pulpit
critic against the portrayal on theatrical
boards of a religious hypocrite, the natural
inference from his words being that he
fears the result and influence even upon
the orthodox; on similar grounds he might
offer opposition to the introduction of any
character with disreputable motives and
evil ways; if the good cannot survive the
competition and contrast with the bad, it
must perish. To carry the objection to Its
extreme and absurd limits would exclude
from nil except sacred literature any refer
ence to the evil genius or Immoral hospi
tality ot Beelzebub himself; the exploitation
of the words or actions ot any individual
whose words or actions failed to conform
strictly to tho Decalogue. Again, It re
sembles Inconsistency to attack the stage
because it does not hold the mirror up to
nature and then Insist that public sentiment
shall place an embargo on the theatrical
use of, to quote the learned critic, "one of
the loftiest sentiments of the human soul"
the sentiment ot religion. And there is
a shade of absurdity in the censure of the
theatre because It makes commercial traf
fic. Even the church must have revenue to
continue its ministrations, to perpetuate its
creeds, and to extend its -work In all the
earth; without moaar, ,the rhrtrrh ii as
powerlees as any secular; erite-rpr,l5evr.
The broad-minded, whether they be de
nominational or not, will scarcely accept
the somewhat detached reasoning of the
worthy metropolitan preacher as a cogent
argument on the merits of the case. It is
difficult to discover where there has been
any sacrilege committed or intended in
weaving religious ceremonies and theologl.
cal threads Into the woof of great plays
that teach a vivid moral lesson to those ot
sufficient comprehension to grasp the sig
nificance of the story.
The Senate no sooner meets than death
claims one of Its members. Senator Hay
ward of Nebraska died lhIsmornlh'g'al"sIx
o'clock after a somewhat protracted Ill
ness. A vacancy Is occasioned which will
be filled by appointment. It has been gen
erally thought that, in the event of Senator
Hayward's death, former Senator William
V. Allen would be returned to his old seat;
but some reports from Nebraska suggest
that Governor Poyntcr might resign and
take the place himself. Probably Mr.
William J. Bryan could have it it he wish
ed, but he is understood to view political
office at the present time with somo dls-
f av or.
We trust that the vindictive charges
against Senator Clark ot Montana, and
which are believed to be the work of a ma
licious and often defeated rival, are not
receiving tolerant consideration in any
quarter merely because Mr. Clark happens
to be a Democrat. Equally ugly things
have been said about the best and purest
Republican living today. Need we say that
we refer to the Hon. Marcus A. Hanna? He
ought to know how it is himself, and put
his delicate foot on any tendency to make
fish of one patriot and flesh of another.
Since the Queen has received the Ameri
can hospital nurses at "Windsor and treated
them with distinguished honor, there will
be a widespread desire among society
young women to try a little war in South
Africa. Another hospital ship would be a
very popular thing just now.
International Amlty.-
(From the New Orleans TimesDemocrat.)
The friendship between the United States and
Great Britain was practically ratified when Salis
bury's refusal to join the Continental powers in
their proposed intervention between the United
States and Spain in the early part of the year
189S gave a quietus to that contemplated move
ment; and there has been nothing but inter
changes ot courtesies and. civilities, and continual
expressions of friendly regard between the two
great representative nations of the Anglo-Saxon
race since that time.
Dansrer of Free rVcstrums
(From the Philadelphia, Record.)
The death in Germaniown of s child who, it is
believed, was poisoned by swallowing free samples
of pills carelessly thrown into the house enforceea
upon the attention of the municipal authorities
a meet dangerous practice. Free samples ot all
sorts of nostrums are almost dally thrown about
at random where children can get possession of
them. It is not enough 'to -punish -those whose
criminal carelcssnss may cause death. The door
to door distribution of patent jnedicines ought to
be prevented, or at least eo regulated that the
dangerous compounds could not-posslbly fall -into
the hands of children.
Transport Passage,
(From the Chicago Journal.)
The IVar Department's only answer to the state,
ments that the Mananeue hod to be baled out
with buckets for twelve days to keep her afloat is
that the men who circulated the stories were
"not used to the hardships ot a seafaring life."
Probably not. About the time a man got used to
the hardships ot a seafaring life aboard one of
the Quartermaster Department's transports he
would be ripe for the undertaker.

MEETING QftJHE CABINET.
Danish- Mner 3aa Circulation In'
Port Rico atb Be Retired. i
The session ot thenCablnet today -was de-'
voted to discusslxigythe question of cur
rency for the Jslandjof Porto Rico. It was,
generally conceded uby the members ot
the Cabinet tha fotto "Rico will become a
"part of this couatrjt. and the sooner the
currency of the-island Is mads Identical
with the currency ,of thlscountry the bet
ter. l '.
At present Porto Jtican currency is on a
silver basis, and, it is alleged, fluctuates
from 2 to 5 per cent, causing the merchants
much trouble, and placing them at the
mercy of brokers and money changers. In
dealing with other countries the Porto
Ricans, it was said, are always at a dis
advantage because of their currency.
It was the opinion of all the members of
the Cabinet that the question be referred
to Congress, with the suggestion to act as
soon as possible.
One member of the Cabinet said: "There
seems to be no doubt but that Porto Rico
will soon be a part of this country and
will naturally have to have the same mone
tary system. There is some opposition on
the part ot a few tit the natives to giving
up their money, as there is always in giv
ing up their religion. This objection, it is
thought, will be overcome.
"While there is no definite plan as yet
tor replacing Porto Rican currency by the
currency ot this country it Is probable that
the Porto lUcaa money will be made Into
bullion and In place" of It the money of
this country will be placed in circulation
on the island. The basis of retiring the
Porto Rican money will have to be deter
mined by Congress. It is hoped that this
question will be settled at once."
The Secretary of State brought the ques
tion of the Samoan treaty before the Cab
inet and the hope was expressed that the
Senate would ratify the treaty at an early
date.
TESTTMONIAi; FOB. SCHLEY.
Beautiful Rmblemntlc Flsrnre Made
From Spanish Silver Coins).
BALTIMORE, Dec. D. Some time ago a
movement was started by Washlngtonlans,
Phlladelphlans, and Baltlmoreans, to pur
chase the silver coins which were found
upon the Spanish ships after they bad been
sunk off Santiago on July 3, 1898. The ob
ject ot the gentlemen who succeeded in
purchasing these coins from the United
States Government, was to have them
molded into a testimonial, to be presented
to Rear Admiral Winfleld Scott Schley af
ter he shall have returned from his pres
ent command on the South Atlantic Sta
tion. The design for the testimonial has been
submitted and approved by the committee,
which consists of Charles F. Ftoulke, ot
Washington; former Postmaster General
Gary of Baltimore, Henry Ives Cobb, at
Washington, " and Theodore Marburg, oX
Baltimore. The man whose design ha3
been accepted Is Mr. Charles J. Pike, in
structor at the Rembart School of Sculp
ture, at the Maryland-Institute.
Mr. Pike has designed a centerpiece iep-
resenting Columbia receiving Cuba, Porto
Rico and the Philippines unto tier bosom.
Four figures are represented In the scheme.
Above all towers the stately figure of Co
'umbia, who, with extended arms, wel
comes the newly-added colonies. Cuba is
shown as a full-grown woman, proud in
her crown of undeveloped wealth. Porto
Rico, undeveloped, but aspiring, is a
maiden, tall, erect and confident, looking
with trustful eyes towards her mother, Co
lumbia; and the Philippines a girl, kneel
ing in submissive 'attitude, her face turned
I with pleading expression toward the cen
tral figure, indicating at the same time re
bellion, sorrow, and bope.
These figures are supported upon a pe
destal upon which. are depicted the fasces.
emblem of authority. The American
eagle, with outstretched wings, forms an
emblematic part of this beautiful and orig
inal group.
At either end of the centerpiece are two
large, irregular seashells, suitable for
either fruits or flowers. These Bhell3 are
supported by dolphins. Four figures, hold
ing torches, will be an acquisition to the
service, forming in themselves candelabra
to surround tho centerpiece.
It is not known when Admiral Schley
will return from the southern seas, but
when he does, he will receive in this the
most unique testimonial which has yet
been presented a hero of the Spanish
American War.

TROUBLES OF THE jTAKPKrUi.
'Receiver Appointed lor the Kew
York PaBllsnlnar House.
NEW TORK, Dec 5. The State Trust
Company, which, as trustee ot the" unpaid
mortgage on the business ot Harper &
Brothers, entered into possession under a
-clause ot the mortgage of all the assets of
the corporation covered by the mortgage.
was appointed temporary receiver by Jus
tice GUdersleeve of the supreme court,
yesterday, In order to protect tste rest of
the assets. The appointment was made on
application of Directors John "W. Harper,
J. Henry Harper, Henry Sleeper Harper,
James Thome Harper, Horatio R. Harper,
and James Harper. Francis C. Cantlne
was named as referee, before whom cause
may be shown on March 28, 1900, why the
corporation should not be dissolved. The
receiver is empowered to carry on the bus
iness. So opposition to the motion was
made by the attorney general, who ap
peared by Clarence W. Francis.
The petition which Is sworn to by John
W. Harper, first vice president, gives an
account of the financial condition of the
corporation. The firm from which the cor
poration grew was "founded in 4817, Mr.
Harper states, and was incorporated in
1896. the corporation agreeing to take over
the debts ot the firm. Before the corpora
tion was created, an inventory was made
ot the assets of the firm, which showed a
value of $6,100,000, without taking into
account the value of "S. Harper's Maga
zine." "Harper's Weekly," or "Harper's
Bazar."
The company was capitalized at $2,000,
000, and a first mortgage for $3,000,000 was
issued, upon most of its property. An ef
fort was made later to take up the mort
gage bonds, but $2,800,000 are still out
standing obligations. The debts of the old
firm have been continued or paid off by
borrowing money on the credit of the cor
poration. Since the formation of the corporation,
says Mr. Harper, the business has been
conducted at a reasonable profit, but the
returns have been barely sufficient to pay
the Interest on the obligations. Large ex
penditure has been required for additional
machinery and plant, electrotype plates.
and other additions to the fixed assets, so
that since the Incorporation, the obliga
tions have kept increasing. The indebted
ness Is $3,163,212.19. ot which $1,700,000 13
due on payable notes, in nearly every In
stance, six months from the making, and
their maturity runs along at various dates
until May 7, 1900. On the demand notes
to J. P. Morgan & Co.. for $850,000, secured
by the mortgage bonds, payment was not
demanded until they were long overdue.
The corporation was unable to meet tbera.
There are sundry accounts owing by the
corporation which are now due, or will
shortly become due, amounting to $285,
6S1.26. The amount ot the assets Is given
as $6,282,716.
EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO.
Mr, Clevelnnd Endorses the Taske
jree College Endowment Fund.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. A meeting for the
purpose ot arousing interest in the plan to
raise an endowment fund of $500,000 for the
Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute,
at Tuskegee, Ala., which Is devoted to the
education of negroes, was held In the Mad
ison Square Garden Concert Hall last night.
Former President Cle eland was to have
presided, but was unable to be present
and sent a letter Instead. Carl Schurz took,
his place. The hall was crowded. After
calling the meeting to order Mr. Schurz
read Mr. Cleveland's letter, which wa9 as
follows:
"It has frequently occurred to me that
in the present condition of our free negro
population In the South and the Incidents
often surrounding them we cannot abso
lutely calculate that the future of our na
tion will be always free from dangers and
convulsions, perhaps no less lamentable
than those which resulted from the enslaved
negroes less than forty years ago. Then
the cause of trouble was the Injustice of
the enslavement of four millions, but now
we have to deal with eight millions who,
though free and invested with all the rights
of citizenship, still constitute in the "body
politic, a mass largely affected with Ignor
ance, slotbfuicessv and a resulting lack of
appreciation of the obligation ot that citi
zenship. "I am, so certain that these conditions
cannot be neglected and so convinced that
the mission worked out by the Tuskegee
Institute presents the best hope for their
amelioration, and that every consideration
matfes Immediate action important, wheth
er based upon Christian benevolence, a love
of country, or selfish material Interests,
that I am profoundly Impressed with the
necessity of such prompt aid to your ef
forts as will best Insure their success.
"I cannot believe that your appeal to
the good people of our country ill be un
successful. Such disinterested devotion as
you have exhibited, and the reasons already
accomplished by your unselfish work, ought
to be sufficient guarantee ot the far-reaching
and beneficent results that must follow
such a manifestation of Christian charity
and good citizenship, as would be apparent
in a cordial and effective support of your
endeavor.
"I need not say how gratified I am to be
able to indicate to you that such support
Is forthcoming. It will be seen by the
letters which I enclose that already an
offer has been made, through me by a
benevolent lady in a Western city, to con
tribute $25,000 toward the endowment
fund."
The letter concluded by saying that the
writer could see danger In the ignorance
and sloth ot the black man ot the South.

BABBI CALISCH OFFENDED.
Unplenxant Scene at nn Elk' Cere
mony in 1'eterifbursr, Va.
RICHMOND, Dec. 5. Whether or not'
the 30ul Is immortal, was the question
upon which a rabbi and a Baptist preach-
er were at cross purposes in Petersburg,
on Sunday. The lodge of Elks of that city
was holding its annual lodge ot sorrow
in memory of dead members, and Rabbi
E. N. Calisch, ot Richmond, was one ot
the orators. He took the Immortality of
the soul as his subject, and said that there
was no authoritative voice to bear witness
to that immortality, although all hoped
that there was a lite beyond.
The Rev. Dr. W. Battle, of Petersburg,
was shocked by the utterances of the rab
bi, and Instantly rose to reply to them.
He quoted passage after passage from tho
Scriptures to prove that the rabbi was
wrong, but when he reached the one be
ginning, "I am the resurrection and the
life," etc.. Dr. Calisch arose, seized his
hat and overcoat, and started hurriedly
and angrily out of the building. It after
ward developed that the last member of
the Petersburg Elks to die was a Hebrew,
and Dr. Calisch thought Dr. Battle was ot
the opinion that the deceased member was
lost because he did not believe in Christ.
All efforts failed to pacify him.
ALFBED THE GREAT'S -GB AVE.
Hyde Al.liej- the ItCKtlnc Place ot Ills
Ilellcii for 3Iany Years.
(From the l'all Mall Gazette.)
Alfred the Great, "that immovable pillar
of the Western Saxons," as one of his own
kinsmen called him, and "the most perfect
character In history," as he Is styled by
Prof. Freeman, died a thousand years ago.
It Is fittingly proposed to celebrate the
memory of the hero-saint of the Anglo
Saxon race upon the thousandth anniver
sary of the traditional date of his death.
namely, October 26, 1001. Meanwhile, schol
arly efforts are being made to verify even
further than has yet been done the really
surprising amount of information as to his
personality and career, and to speed his Teal
lame along the channels of English and
American conversation.
The case of Alfred, says Mr. Warwick
Draper In the "Antiquary," can be no ex
ception to the rule by which mankind takes
a keen and reverent Interest In the burial
places of Us great dead. Before the mys
tery thickens or false notions misplace ig
norance. It seems well to say at once what
can be said as to the burial place ot AI-J
fred. It is-a point ot his biography which
has escaped the attention of recent writers.
The very date of his death Is now a
question. Long tradition has. until re
cently, given it as October 28, SOI. Both
Freeman and J. R. Green are content with
this. But the point has been carefully
examined by Mr. W. H. Stevenson, who is
convinced that October 26, S99, Is the reli
able date. The date of October, k-99. is
declared to be confirmed by a piece! of
nearly contemporary evidence in the form
of a manuscript rightly pretending to be
written In the thirteenth year of Edward
(Alfred's successor), and the year nf lhe
Incarnatlon 912. Mr. Stevenson Ingenious
ly explains away the "901," under which
the event is entered in the Parker man
uscript on grounds of paleography. The
layman may be forgiven for scarcely feel
ing grateful for this discovery, but he is
bound to admit that Mr. Stevenson seems
fairly to have proved his case.
Alfred, at any rate, died, closing his mar
velous reign of strenous and manifold en
ergies. No authority mentions where he
died; the place was probably his home at
Wolvesey. In Winchester, where two years
before he had hanged a crew of Danish
sea-dogs. We have no hint of the prox
imate cause of his death, by which we
might infer that he succumbed to any se
rious attack of the mysterious malady
which had remained a thorn in the flesh
to him from the day of his marriage
feast. His bodily frame may well have
been- exhausted by his labors.
The chronicle says nothing as to his
burial place, but most of the remaining
authorities agree upon Winchester, and no
other place has ever been suggested. His
kingdom's capital, where .his soul tad
chiefly labored, was fitly the resting place
61 his mortal remains. The so-callei
"Annals" say that he was burled "In the
church of St, Peter," and "that his tomb
is still extant, made ot the most precious
porphyry marble." William ot Malmes
bury (twelfth century) also relates that he
was burled in the Episcopal Cathedra!
that Is, the Old Minster, on the site of the
present pile, but that his body was removed
later to the New Minster, which stood im
mediately to the north of the Old, well
within the precinct ot the present cathe
dral close. This latter does not seem to
have been founded by Alfred, although he
had bought land for a chapel and dormi
tory, and left Instructions to Edward to
complete the projected monastery. It is
not mentioned In Alfred's will.
According to the elaborate acount in the
"Hyde Register" of the building ot the
New Minster, it was Edward who had the
remains of his father solemnly transferred
thither from the Old .Minster. There it
Tested for two centuries, which saw the
tide of Norman invasion. William the
Conqueror, indeed, against whom Abbot
Alwyn and the monks of New. Minster had
striven at Hastings, seized their estates
for two years. Under Henry I serious hos
tilities seem to have broken out between
the two clerical establishments, with the
result that in 1121 the faithful few who re
mained in the New Minster removed them
selves and their precious relics to a new
home in the Benedictine Abbey situate at
Hyde, outside the north wall of the city.
beyond the meads where "Guy" Earl of
Warwick, is said to have conquered Col
brand, the Danish giant."
Hyde Abbey remained the resting place
of Alfred's relics for many centuries. It
Is between the bare level sward which
marks where "New? Minster was and the
strangely wasted site of Hyde Abbey that
the pious student ot Alfred's memory must
choose.
