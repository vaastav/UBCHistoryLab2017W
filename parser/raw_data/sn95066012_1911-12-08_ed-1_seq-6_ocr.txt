RED CROSS SEAL8
Money Will Go To Help Fight Tu
berculosis Red Cross Christmas Seals date
back in their origin to "charity
stamps," first used for the soldiers'
relief funds in Uoston in 1SS2, during
the Civil war. After the war, this
method of raising money was dis
continued in this country for a gen
eration, although It found vogue in
Portugal, Switzerland. Austria.
fcYaace, Spain. Denmark, Norway.
Russia, Sweden, and other European
countries. There are now several
hundred different types of charity
stamps used in all parts of the world,
as many as forty being used In Aus
tria for children's hospitals alone.
Stamps or seals were first used to
get money for the anti-tuberculosis
crusade In Norway and Sweden In
IW4. After being used in these coun
tries for three years, as a direct re
sult of the interest of Jacob Hiis in
this movement, the Delaware Anti
Tuberculosis association, headed by
Miss lOmily I Dissell the Hod Cross
Society of Delaware, combined in is
suing a Tuberculosis Stamp. So suc
cessful was this campaign that near
ly $J00(t was realized and the next
year, in 1908, the American Hed
Cross was induced to Issue a Nation
al Hed Cross Tuberculosis Stamp.
From this sale, $133,000 was realized
that amount being almost doubled in
1809. Last year, for the fust . time,
Ike sale was organized on a compre
hensive basis, taking in all parts of
the .United States, and $310,000 worth
wore sold. In 1911. the slogan for
the campaign Is "A Million for Tub
erculosis from Hed Cross Seals."

The President's Trust Message
President Taft's message on the
trusts is a clear indication that prog
ress Is being made toward a solution
of the question. Not that we may
hope for much at this session of Con
gress for that body must first talk it
self out and also prepare for the polit
ical exigencies of the presidential
campaign. But the message itself re
veals the effects of the recent public
BPitatinn of the issue. One may see
c
reflected in it the gradual crystaliza
tion of the most intelligent public
opinion; and this fact tends to con
lirm the view that the government
suit against Mr. Roosevelt's model
trust, the I'nited States steel corpor
ation, did more to forco a salutlon of
the general problem than any single
administrative act since the anti-trust
law was passed in 1S90. !
The president's recent speeches in
the West on the trust question were
better forgot tf-n, now that this very
able and weighty state paper is be
fore the country. In those addresses
Mr. TaTt assumed, not unnaturally
perhaps, thiit no supplementary legis
lation could be secured at least along
such lines as he could approve and
his position seemed unsatisfactory by
reason of its wholly stationary as
pect. He advised no amendment of
the law, recommended no new enact
ments and seemed, content to leave
everything to the courts. As a matter
of fact, he had previously taiten a
much more progressive attitude, quite
different from that of his recent wes
tern sueeches, In his special messane
of January 7. 1910; and the president's
friends will be pleased to observe tnat
he now reverts to that message and
builds upon it a constructive policy
that must challenge serious attention,
even if it must fail in winning the in
dorsement of all studentB and agita
tors of the question.
The defense of the supreme court
decisions In the oil and tobacco cases
is more acute and lawyer-like than the
similar defense In the western speech
es; and so, too, the exposition of the
court . decrees reorganizing those
trusts revealB the working of the pres
ident's legal mind at its best. As for
the effectiveness of those decrees in
restoring genuine competition. In spite
of the prorata distribution of stock
ownership In the new companies. It
Is apparent that opinion in general re
gards the outcome with deep skepti
cism. The presidents confidence that
competition will really be restored Is
certainly not shared by the tobacco
' Independents," who this very week
have appealed to the United Mates
supreme court to review the work of
the circuit court of the district of New
York. But as this Is a point which
only experience can resolve beyond a
doubt, one needs only to note the
president's optimistic argument,
pausing, of course, to catch his direct
allusion to Mr. Roosevelt's recent ar
ticle on the trusts, in the passage:
Those critics who speak of this dis
integration in the trust as a mere
change of garments have not given
consideration to the Inevitable work
ing of the decree and understand little
the personal danger of attempting to
evade or set at naught the solemn In
junction of a court whose object is
made plain by the decree and whose
inhibitions are set forth with a detail
and comprehensiveness unexampled
in the history of equity jurisprudence.
The Important feuture of the mes
sage is the president's renewed recom
mendatlon of the enactment of a feder
al Incorporation law, which was the
basis of his discussion of the trust
question In the message of January 7,
1910. He repeats with emphasis what
he said then as to the desirability of
this legislation, urging that events in
the past two years have confirmed the
opinion then expressed. In this con
nection, Mr. Tart takes pains to say
that corporations of great size and cap
able of engaging successfully In the
foreign trade are necessary to the
country's prosperity. Mere size Is no
offense against law or morality. "The
denunciation of conspiracies In re
straint of trade should not and does
not mean the denial of organizations
large enough to be Intrusted with our
Interstate and foreign trade. It has
been made more clear now than tt was
then that a purely negative statute
like the antitrust law may well be sup
pigmented by specific provisions for
the building up and regulation of le
gitimate national and foreign com
merce." In short, Mr. Taft's policy Is
the retention and enforcement of the
antitrust law of 1890, in order that no
corporation may unduly restrain trade,
control prices or create a monopoly
In whole or In part, supplemented by
a statute specifying what business
methods are unfair and Indicative of
an unlawful purpose, and also by facil
ities for the lawful conduct of big
business under federal regulation.
For the federal charters which the
president now recommends would vest
so much power of supervision and con
trol over the corporations created that
a substantial form of federal regula
latlon would be established. He now
goes farther In this direction than he
did In the message of Janu..ry, 1910.
He very nearly mee;s the wishes of
George W. I'erklns In tdvlslng the de
velopmcnt of the bureau of corpora
tions Into an effective agM'cy for the
supervision of Interstate business.
Those who have rend Mr. Perkins'
speech at Youngstown. ()., will l.o

In her anxiety to sot a good table,

violations of the law as would be prac-j

mission might well be invested also!
with the duty already referred to, of '
aiding courts in the dissolution and
re-creation of trusts within the law.
It should be an executive tribunal of.
