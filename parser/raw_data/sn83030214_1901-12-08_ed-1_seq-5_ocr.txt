PHILBIN AFTER WALLACE.
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY INVESTI
GATING CHARGES THAT BUILDING
LAW VIOLATIONS HAVE
BEEN JSVINKED AT.
The recent controversy between Buildings
Commissioner Wallace and a number of archi
tects and builders has finally been taken into
the courts. Incidentally, District Attorney Phil
bin has promised to Investigate alleged miscon
duct on the part of the Commissioner.
On the application of Frank T. Noble, a tax
payer, Justice Beach in the Supreme Court
yesterday issued an order directing Commis
sioner Wallace to appear before him and shovv
cause why a peremptory writ of mandamus
should not issue to compel him to carry out
the provisions of Section 105 of the Building
Code. The order 1b returnable on December 11.
The order further directs Commissioner Wal
lace to show cause why- action should not be
taken to prevent further violations of the law
in the construction of the building at the south
east corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane. The
petitioner further asks that the owners of the
building in question be compelled to comply
with the law.
While Mr. Noble appears as the petitioner, he
represents a large number of architects and
builders who are dissatisfied with the manner
in which things are conducted in the Buildings
Department.
In his petition for the writ Mr. Nobie says
that he is interested in the outcome of the mat
ter embraced in the petition. He then says that
James G. Wallace, under the provisions of the
"reater New- York charter, was duly appointed
a commissioner of buildings with administra
tive jurisdiction in the Boroughs of Manhattan
and The Bronx.
Mr Noble cites Section I<>s of the Building
Code, which provides that wh?n the height of
a fireproof building exceeds twelve stories, or
more than ISO feet, all outside window frames
and sash shall be of metal or of wood covered
with metal, and that the inside window frames
and s;i«h doors, trim and other interior finish
may be of wood, covered with metal, or of wood
treated by some process approved by the Board
of Buildings, to render the same fireproof. Mr.
Noble asserts that this section has never been
repealed, changed or amended, and is still in
efiect and that the building at Broadway and
Ma'den Lane is being constructed in absolute
violation of its provisions. The petitioner as
serts that Commissioner Wallace was properly
informed of the alleged violations of the law, but
that he has failed to act. —^-j
Several days ago District Attorney Philbin
wrote a letter to Commissioner Wallace, inform
ing him that if the alleged violations were going
on they should be stopp-d at once. In return
Commissioner Wallace inclosed a report of an
inspector in his department to the effect that no
violations existed. Mr. Philbin is awaiting the
report of an investigation he has set on foot,
and if the evidence warrants it he will place the
case before the grand jury.
Commissioner Guilfoyle, of Brooklyn, declared
that he had not voted in favor of the plans for
th<» building in question, and an investigation
of the record shows that he did not.
Mayer- & Gilbert, attorneys for Mr. Noble,
promise a sensation when the case comes up for
argument. Mr. Mayer was formerly counsel for
the Buildings Department.
TERMIXAL BILL MAY BE VOID.
ALLEGED CXCOXSTITUTIOXALITT OF THE
STATUTE FOR IXCREASIXG FACILITIES
AT THIS END OF THE BRIDGE.
An alleged defect has been discovered in the
McCarren bill authorizing the changing of the
Manhattan terminal of the Brooklyn Bridge. On
account of this the act is believed by the Board
of Estimate to be unconstitutional. The State
Constitution provides:
"No private or- local bill which may be passed
by the legislature shall embrace more than one
subject, and that shall be expressed m the title."
The bridge terminal bill apparently embraces
two distinct features, nan.ely. one for the exten
sion of the terminal facilities, the other for a
franchise for the elevated roads, which may be
limited to terminal facilities at the City Hall
station or may go to Harlem over a new route.
In view of the probable defect in the law, it is
said that Controller Coier will advise that no
action be taken in the Board of Estimate on the
terminal plans.
MOUXT TERXOX'S GIRL BURGLAR.

Mary, who is a Creole and small for her ago,
was arraigned before Judge Bennett and remanded
for trial until to-morrow. She will be held fur the
grand jury on the specific charge of looting the
house of Mrs. Samuel Hettinger at Xew-Rochelle.
All of the booty was found in her possession. Mary,
who was traced by the imprints of her French
heeled shoes, which were found around the house
she plundered, said:
"I didn't steal anything. The things were given
to me."
Among those who the police say have been
robbed by Mary Thompson are the following: Mrs.
Samuel Hettinger, Horton-ave., New-Rochelle;

AX ARAB WAIF IV PASIB.
From The Paris Messenger.
A little Arab boy. from Bethlehem of .ludea. has
been found wandering destitute in the streets of
Paris. He is only fifteen years of age. and has
passed through some strange adventures in search
of his father, who left Bethlehem to seek his fort
une in Paris a long time ago, and has not since
been heard of. The lad mapaged to get down to
the coast and get engaged as cabin boy on' a ship
bound for France. On landing he proceeded to beg
his way to Paris, where he has been found by the
i)oliee. sleeping and starving, on a seat on the
Boulevard Menilmontant. This ycung Bethelhemite
had no notion, cf course, what Paris was like. It
bears no resemblance to Bethlehem, snd a father
is not so easily found. The police are taking care
of this homeless wanderer from the Holy Land.

IT BITES TWO PEOPLE AND SEVERAL CA
NINES BEFORE IT IS KILLED.
Bloomneld, N. J., Dec. 7.— Great excitement was
caused by a dog which ran wildly through the
business portion of the town this afternoon. The
streets were crowded with women and children, and
when the do? made its appearance they dodged
Into doorways and other places of safety.
The animal bit several other dogs, and then
dashed at Frank Smith, an employe of the Lacka
wanna Railroad, and bit him on the leg. Smith
ran to a nearby druir store, where the wound was
cauterized. Charles Green, a twelve-year-old boy,
was next attacked by the dog, and was bitten on
the hip. William H. Hall, a letter carrier, was
next attacked, but escaped being bitten. He kicked
the animal in the side, and sent it rolling into the
gutter. Patrolman Charles Durning appeared at
that moment and shot the animal five times be
fore he killed it. The dog is believed to have been
mad.
JUDOE DUNNE DECLARES they WERE wot
GUILTY OF CONTEMPT.
Chicago. Dec. 7.— Andrew M. Lawrence, manag
ing editor of "The Chicago American," and H. S.
Canfield, of the staff of that paper, who were sen
tenced recently by Judge Hanecy to forty and
thirty days, respectively, in the county Jail for con
tempt of court, wore discharged from custody by
Judge Dunne to-day.
In granting a writ of habeas corpus to the re
lators the court said that the case hinged on
whether the case on which "The Chicago Ameri
can" commented had been disposed of by Judge
Hanecy or was still pending.
Judge. Dunne held that the case in question had
been finally disposed of by Judge Hanecy when he
gave his decision from the bench. The fact that
the clerk had not entered the order when the com
ment on the decision was printed and published,
therefore, does not show that the case was Btill
pending. The act of entering the order on the
record was merely a ministerial act. Judge Dunne
said.
Judge Dunne, admitted that the articles and
cartoon to which Judge Hanecy objected were
clearly calculated to intimidate and coerce the
court, had the court not already rendered its de
cision. Judge Dunne admitted that the cartoon in
evidence was probably libellous, and the articles
possible so.
Harsh criticism. Judge Dunne remarked, is one
Of the incidents and burdens ot" public life. "I see ,
no reason," he said, "why a Judge should be of- .
fered a different remedy for attacks in the public
prints that a President, or a Governor, or a Con- j
gressraan. Criticism of a public official, if just. r
will do good: if unjust, will do harm." :
In concluding, the court said: "I am clearly of
the opinion that the language used in open court
by Judge Hanecy amounted to a final order dispos
ing of the case under consideration; and, that being
a linal order, under the doetrino of 'contempt' as laid
down in this State by our Supreme Court in the i
case of Storey vs. the People, the relators had a
right to comment on and criticise that decision, even
to" the extent of libelling the honored and respected
judge who rendered that opinion, without exposing
themselves to prosecution for contempt of court.
The following is Judge Hanecy's comment on
Judge Dunne's decision:
'■Judge Dunne had the power so to decide, but
he did not have the right. Any judge has the
power to let every prisoner out of the peniten
tia.-ies but they have not the right, nor does any
body expect that they will."
The contempt case and the habeas corpus hearing
which followed grew out of an effort made by
'•The Chi'Mgo American" to secure an order for
quo warranto proceedings to compel the People s
Ga~, Light and Coke Camrany to show by what
right they operated in Chicago.
Judge Hanecy refused to allow the quo warranto
proceeding, and. following this refusal, "The Amer
ican" printed articles and a cartoon strongly inti
mating "that the Judge had been unduly influenced,
and that when he again came up for election ne
would discover that the people had no confidence
in him Judge Hanecy cited Lawrence and Can
field with others of the paper, for contempt, and
found Lawrence and Canfleld guiky.

THE KENTUCKY GOVERXORSHIP CONTEST.
FORMER OFFICIALS SUED FOR MONET SPENT OH
■ STATE TROOP? AT THE CAPITAL IN 1900.
Frankfort Kv., Dec. 7.-Lawyers representing
Attorney Genera Breckinr for th- common
wealth, have filed suit in the Franklin Circuit
Court asainst former State Treasurer U alter R
Day and former State Auditor John S. Sweeney
and the assignees of their official bonds, to re
cover S2SI2S. with interest, from February 1. 1900.
It is alleged In the suit that the money was spent
illegally by the Republicans in maintaining State
troops at Frankfort during the contest for the
Governorship between the late William Goebel and
W. S. Taylor in January. February and March,
1000 Sweeney and Day were Republicans, and
held office until forced by a decision of the Ken
tucky Court of Appeals to surrender to the Demo
cratic claimants. The warrants of Sweeney as
State Auditor and the checks of Day as Treas
urer show the payments of this amount of
money to former Adjutant General Collier and
others.

CONFEREN'-t WITH INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION GIVEN UF.
St. Paul, Minn.. Dec. 7.— The Railroad Warehouse
Commission to-day held an executive session, at
the close of which the secretary, A. C. Clausen,
sent to the Interstate Commerce Commission a let
ter cancelling the appointment made for a confer
ence of the two commissions for next Tuesday in
Washington. The letter to the Interstate Commis
sion merely stated as the reason for the change
of mind on the part of the commission that it
had been found Impossible to secure the presence
of Attorney General W. B. Douglas. The real
cause, however, is said to be the refusal of Gov
ernor Van Sant to go, together with an Interview
published in a newspaper friendly to the Gov
ernor, declaring the journey to Washington a "wild
goose chase." .
Governor Van Sant this afternoon received a let
ter from Governor F. F. Rogers, of the State of
Washington, acknowledging receipt of the Minne
sota Governor's letter, and stating that he had al
ready ascertained from the Attorney General that
Washington had a clause in its constitution pro
hibiting general monopolies, but no special pro
vision as to the union of railways. He promisee
hearty co-operation to the extent of his ability.

adventures in Oriental waters, having narrowly
escaped foundering, the transport Sheridan Is
safe in port. With several Congressmen on
board, and a larg»* number of sick and dis
charged soldiers, the Sheridan left Manila fifty
one days ago. bound for San Francisco. She had
been at sea only a few days when she ran into
a typhoon that nearly sank her. The fury of
the storm was terrific. When It abated the
Sheridan tried to make headway, but the engi
neers reported to Captain Pierce that the ma
chinery was disabled. The transport drifted for
a time with the currents of the sea, and almost
went ashore on the Japanese coast.
On October 10 she reached Nagasaki much the
worse for wear, and was put in drydock. The
passengers were transferred to the Warren, sent
from Manila for the purpose. Then the War
ren went aground and the passengers again
changed ships, this time going on board the
Hancock. That steamer bumped on a reef in
the inland sea. but, after a delay of twenty-tour
hours was towed off and resumed her voyage,
reaching here uninjured a few days ago.
After being thoroughly repaired, the Sheridan
left Nagasaki and made the run to thia port m
seventeen days and frve hours.
