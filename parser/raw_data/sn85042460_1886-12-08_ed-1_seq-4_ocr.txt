The President's Message.
A careful reading of Mr. Cleve
land 's message canrot fail to impress
th c mind of the impartial with its
general excellence. In many of its
features even prejudice will not be
able to construe it otherwise Own
very favorably. It is one of the
ablest state papers spread before the
people for a long time. It is not only
a most comprehensive document, but
it is as sound and able as it is broad
in its grasp. There are few of the
views set forth that will not touch a
warm cliord of sympatliy in the
American heart. In diction, style
and method it is a complete answer
to those who, in their own ignorance
of the man, sneer at the President as
one who filled well the office of Sher
iff of his county. The sneer is not
only unamerican to a lamentable de
gree, but it is unworthy any man pre
unming to call himself an American.
The very cornerstone of our institu
tions is laid on the broad.linn ground
of the political equality of all men.
But, to proceed with the message.
It first deals with the matter of our
foreign relations. This is treated i »
externa and with the utmost care.
The President discusses with the
broad, calm air of a real statesman
the relations of the United States
with many nations. The most im
portant are those with Great Britain
on the fisheries; those with China,
on the question of restriction, and
those with Mexico arising out of the
affairs of the crank, Cutting.
In discussing these, and all other
foreign relations, while Mr. Cleve
land studiously avoided all buncomb
stump style of discussion, and all
show of undignified bluster, he holds
high aloft and with a firm hand the
national flag as a thing worthy of the
hig best respect among the peoples of
the globe—a thing not only worthy
ot respect, but one which must be
accorded the very highest measure oi
respect. He points to American citi
zenship as a privilege which will
Kuard sacied the possessor of it in
all paits of the world. There is no
faltering nor cringing in any tone of
these utterances in the ears of a
world assembled to hear what the
Great Republic of the New World,
through the mouth of her chief mag
istrate, has to say to kings, tzars and
emperors.
The next matters of prime import
ance taken up are the finances and
the tariff. These questions are treat
en in a manner that certainly must
meet with the entire approbation of
all the people. The present sched
ule of taxation is one based on the
exigencies and conditions inci
dent to the Civil war, and to
the enormous debt which bur
dened the nation at its close.
There are at present no such neces
sities for the raising of colossal reve
nues. The debt is as far reduced as
it can be at present, and the portion
remaining unpaid and unpayable is
provided for by the regular operation
of the sinking fund. When the next
section of the debt is redeemable in
181U there will be abundance of
money to redeem the bonds. When
the last batch of bonds mature in
li*0" the same provision will meet
that demand. As at present ar
ranged there is a surplus oi revenue
ali-jvc natural expenses of nearly
♦100,000,000. This is a heavy bur
den on. the people, which should be
removetl at the earliest possible op
portunity. Yet in all tariff reform,
the rights and interests iostered un
der the present system, some of them
which are outgrowths of its worst
features, demand careful attention.
A conservative tariff revision is the
policy of the Piesident.
Agriculture and labor are to a great
extent cognate terms. It is a most
gratifying thing to find the Chief Kx
exutive of the nation turning his
mind from what the Republican poli
ticians used to call "practical poli
tics," that is njvians by which to con
tinue that party in power, to these
vital interests of the people—of the
■whole people, without regard to
geographical section or social class.
The basis of national existence and
prosperity are agriculture and labor.
These vital questions command a
largo and wise recognition at the
hands of the President.
Another popular strain struck in
this masterly paper is tbe rehabilita
tion of the Navy and the defences of
the cities of the coast. The present
state of b»th is a disgrace to a great
nation, and a standing invitation to
every petty state on the globe to in-
Bult our Hag. Chile has a couple of
rains which are so constructed and
bo armed that they could destroy
every city on the Pacific coast, and
there are no means provided afloat or
ashore to resist their attacks.
Then follow a number of routine
matters, such as the postofflce, etc.,
etc., which are all fully treated. The
need of increased postal, judiciary
and other service in the growing parts
of the West are all urged upon tho
attention of Congress. The Indian
question is taken up with the same
comprehensive grasp as the other
matters of national import.
The President's attitude on the
public lands is a portion of the mes
sage which will be read with unal
loyed pleasure by all good citizens.
It urges the remodeling of the lawH
so as to preserve all the lands left of
the great national domain for the
actual use of actual citizens who wish
to become actual settlers.
Those who in ignorance think, or
iv partizan prejudice say, that Cleve
land is inimical to the interests, or
deaf to the just demands of the sol
diers of the Union, will find no con
firmation of such views, or pretended
views, in the section of this paper
where that subject is diecusssed.
To be thoroughly honest, there are
three points on which we can see
some discontent and criticism may
arise touching the views expressed
by the President. Two of these arc
matters of somewhat local scope—
the Chinese and silver. <>n the first
he is rather guarded to meet with a
sympathetic response from the Pa
citic coast. Still he manifests a de
sire, and we think he means it, to
prevent their further introduction
to this country. On the silver
matter, if his suggestions were
fully carried out, so as to reach
the old Democratic method of free
coinage, it is dillicult to 6ee why any
trouble should arise on that head.
The thiid of these points is civil
ser vfce. Like all sensible men of
practical views who have come into
close quarters with this matter and
seen its every-day workings, there is
little doubt that it sits heavily on the
executive stomach. But Cleveland
finds the law on the statute books
and feels in duty bound to enforce it,
in the spirit of its makers, if it ever
had any spirit in it other than the
purpose of retaining the Republican
office-holders in the seats they had
occupied for a generation. There is
only one thoroughly Democratic
mode of procedure with this law,and
that is to sweep it into the limbo of
things lost on earth at as early a mo
ment us can be.
The message will be read all over
the Union with much interest and
general satisfaction. Its comprehen
sive and lucid sentences will be deep
ly pondered. It is a document which
not merely the party to which Mr.
Cleveland belongs, but of which the
whole people may justly feel proud.
It is a scholarly, statesmanlike, ele
gant and profound state paper.
Mr. Lynch's Popularity.
Some comparisons having been in
trodiieed between the vote for Mr.
Lynch and some of his esteemed con
freres on the ticket, although fully
aware of the quality attaching to all
comparisons, we are disposed to make
one or two for the benefit of thoee
who do not see facts as they arc.
Confessedly the place to test a
man's popularity is where he lives
anil is best known. Making such a
test the good opinion in which Mr.
Lynch*! neighbors hold him, is a
thing to gratify any man. Here in
the city of Los Angeles, he ran side
by side with Hon. S. M. White, ac
counted among the moßt phenomen
ally popular men of the town. An
other decidedly popular young man
on the Democratic ticket was John
T. Gaffey. The candidate for
Governor is one of the most popular
men in the State. Now, taking the
vote for these four men, and it
stands for the city of Los Angeles:
Lynch 2523, Gaffey 2516, White 2508,
Bartlett 2325. Gaffey had the en
dorsement of one or two other nomi
nations and got the benefit of being
on their tickets. White, together
with all the rest of the county candi
dates, had the aid of the Labor tick
et, a very strong pull. Yet in spite
of it all, Lynch was ahead of both.
In any political race in this commu
nity the man that keeps anywhere
near "Steve" White is not hated " by
a large majority," nor is he hurt by
any malice that seeks his overthrow.
Results of the Election.
Mr. Workman's majority for the
Mayoralty is a very handsome one,
being about a round half thousand.
We regret very much to be obliged
to say that Mr. Cohn is defeated for
Tax Collector. He is a most com
petent man at such matters, and
could have rendered excellent service
to the city. In this regret there is
the consolation to know that the suc
cessful Republican who wins the
prize is a most estimable gentleman,
and a competent person for the duties
of the place.
The vote for Treasurer is exceed
ingly close. By the face of the re
turns Mr. Ballade seems to fall be
hind in the sum of about ten vote 3.
There was some irregularity in the
polling-place of the Courthouse pre
cinct. The two tallies marked a dis
crepancy, and it might be well for
Mr. Ballade to demand that the votes
be recounted under a rigid supervis
ion. The ballots are said to have
been scattered and smeared with ink
in a row that took place during the
progress of the count.
Elskwherk in the Herald to-day
will be found a Bpicy story of how
Gen. Vandever held a seat in Con
gress from 18(11 to 180 Mby the gross
est chicane. He boasted of this on a
recent occasion ia an interview print
ed in a Republican journal of this
city, and said he would "worry Lynch
LOS ANGELES DAILY nEKALD, DECEMBER 8. 1880.
as he had worried Byington." lie
will find
"That tho case being altered,
That altera the case."
The lower house at the period re
ferred to was almost all Republican.
He will not find the Democrats
so complacent about his filling
a seat which belongs to some
one else. The smooth, sanctimoni
ous and hypocritical old General will
not be able to "wrong Lynch" to any
great extent in the present year oi
grace when the Democratic House
needs every vote that justly belongs
to it. In 1861 the Republican House
had no such exigent circumstances
around it, but the General held the
fort by gross wrong. He will not
do it again. A man who commit! a
crime is very likely to try it again,
but he often fails in the second at
tempt, because the public are "on
to him."
Fine Corn.
Mr. J. H. Martin, of Los Nietos, ex
hibited iv the Hkkalu oilice seme spe
cimens of com, besides a large quantity
of English walnuts. The corn consisted
of three varieties, a few ears of white
Sonora, fourteen inches long, containing
seven hundred and eighty-two
grains to the ear; also White Flint, thirt
een inches long, with seven hun
dred grains to the ear; Large Yellow,
with fourteen inches, with eight hun
dred grains to the ear. Mr. Martin
showed walnuts from eight-year-old
trees which measured eight inches
around. He received the lirat premium at
Ihe Downey fitir; also at the last county
fair held iv this city. This corn and the
nuts were raised ou Mr. Martin's own
I place, one mile north of Fultou Wells,
aud shows the good quality of the laud
'in this section. To any one that will
visit it Mr. Martin will do the honors so
that he may see for hiinseif one of the
garden spots of Southern California.

TRACT have subdivided SEVENTY ACRES of choice hill property into
LARGE VILLA LOTS
And are offering them for ashort time at acre prices aud on very reasonable terms. The
owners do not "want the earth," and they are willing to sell at a very moderate advance
on first cost, preferring to let early buyers have au opportunity to make something in the
rapid rise in values which is sure to come.
The Nob Hill Tract
Lies just six minutes'walk from tbe present terminus of jhe Second-street cable line
and will be only one block from tho live wheu its contemplated extension to the city
limits tikes place. Ou tbe other side the tract adjoins the new CITY LAKE PARK,
and will be only one block from the Motor road ou Seventh street.
The streets will be graded as soon as the weather will permit, and it Is confidently
expected that work will shortly be commenced ou several handsome residences.
PROF. J. A. FISHER, now of tho John Hopkins University, Baltimore, writes that
he is now perfecting the plans for tho creation of a buildi ug for Kirkwood Seminary, on
block D of the Nob Hill tract.
Some beautiful lots remain unsold, and those who wish to buy for speculation or a
home are invited to inspect this tract.
