the manufacturing Eectiou (f the country,
the lubor and producta cf which are protec

e^t possible commendation ol tbe President's
recent wi3e and just tnedBage.rec mmeuding
tbe removal of the tarill on the oeccesiries
of lif ?, and the retention of the tax on whis?
ky. But the Solons composing the Virginia
legisature, representing the people of an
agricultural State,tbe people whose labor
and products are not protected by the exist
high tariff, so far from agreeing with tho did
tinguished educators above meetionedonthe
sutject referred to, differ with them entirely,
take directly opposite ground.-, and instruct
Virginia's representatives iu Congress to
vote for the repeal of the tax on oleomarga?
rine, po us to removeeven the little protection
that tax affords Virginia butter makers, and
to take the tax off whisky, so us to make
tint moral, mental and physical poison

auch thiugs can be, now-^-dujs, without ex

that, the latter id protected against foreign
competition by a high tariffon wool.whilethe
former, in the sale of hi.i hides, has to com?
pete with the cattle rulers of the entire
world. la thereaoy justice in that? And
jet iLhi is only a fair sanrp'e cf tho iuju&
;ice of the existing tu:iff. Then, too, to
rshow the injurious effect of such a tariff
upon (be labor of the country, it is only neo
es^ary to mention the fact that while this
country exports millions of dollars worth of
leather acd leather goods, its exports of
wool and wooleu goods amount to compara
lively little or nothing? Being enabled to
get uotaxed raw material, American tan
utrs and leather goods manufacturers cen
engage in profitable but-iness, caD employ
large numbers < f bauds, at.d can compete
successfully with fort ign rivals in the mar
ketsof the world. A> 1 that tbe voters of
this country reed to inako them demand the
removal of the duty on raw material
and the neceesarit s of life, is that they shall
understand t1??" *uhj*-c? of ili?> tariff.
The Washington Republican sayb: "The
Alexandria gazsttb puts 'Zack' Chandler
in tho U. 9. Saaate." Oh.no! The Ga
ZETi'k doesn't do any auch thing. The
Gazrttk doe3 say that Senator W. E
Chandler is the m*a who sant to Mr. Hayes
the i!i->. atco : ''You have 185 votes and are
elected." The proof ihat tbe Republican.
anewspfpir printed at the national capital,
and nami d the "National'1 Republican too,
isi ?ora-1 of that fact, is by n> means con
duc;v3 :?> that pa >er's reputation for gen
eral iutoliigence. If tho Republican will
take tho trouble to interview Mr. Chandler
on tho suhj--c*,i: will learn thai th: Gazktte,
in this, as in most othtr things, is right.

And yet tbe Virginia legislature has passed

The Washing i on Republican 8aj's lne

what be thought of the fact that a!i tho re
publicans in the Virginia legislatura had in?
dorsed General Mahone as the future leader
of their party, said he was surprised at it, as
it was direc'iy at variance with the previous
expressions of some of them, and that he
still believed, notwithstanding the action
referred to, that several of them were really
opposed to General Mahone and would
prove to be fo. He said he was certain that
action was not in accord with the feelings of
their constituents and would not be i-cs
tained by the party throughout the State.
Respecting the probable course his party in

An Indiana Ghost.?Bartholomew ccun
ty, Ind., and particularly that part of it in
the vicinity of Hope and Hartsville at d Cc
lnmbus, has for four or live weeks past been
shivering at ghosts and their unannounced
appearance. In December, ISS-j, George
Cooper was foully murdered, and next
morning bis mangled and mutilated body
was found by the roadside, about half way
between Hartsville and Columbus. It hat
never been discovered who committed the
murder, aud the tragedy had been almost
forgotten until it was revive 1 abr.i! four
weeks ago by the appearance of Cooper'*
spirit at the place where his body was
found. At that time Andrew Hitchcock
was driviDg a livery team belonging
to BeDnett Patterson, of Columbus, on
his way to Hartsville. When the wood
where Cooper's body was found was reach?
ed, tho team suddenly stopped, and then
violently lunged toward the road.-ide, al?
most upsetting the buggy. Hitchcock na?
turally looked to see what bad frightened
the horses, aud was himself so Feared that
his hair sloe d straight up, aud he became so
weak tbat he could scarcely retain bis hold
on the reins, for there at the roadside stood
Cooper's ghost staring blankly into space.
The afl iijMed horses were not stopped nor
their : ;ie. d nlackened by Hitchcock until r e
arrived at bis destination. Hitchcock drove
sixteen ..- i.ts out <.f bis way to get back to
Columbu-i rather lhan le uin by tho direct
road and run the rink of ?gaiu beiBg con?
fronted by the ghost. Sioco.that time the
same appa'ition has been seen, no fewer
than fj'jr or five repu n'n'e farmers having
been frightened out of iht ir wi s by thesud
den appearance, like the ghost cf poor
Hamlet'.-' father, cf this Bpcclral visitor.
There seems to <e no special hour for the
visitation, the gboet having b-en seen ac?
cording to rej.oit ?.s early as 11 o'clock at
night and ua lute as 4o'clock iu :be morning,
while one weli known and reputable gentle?
man, Josbu3 Hincb, declares shatbesaw
the appariiiou oace at midday. Tho Harts?
ville road is now seldom travelled afier dark
save by a few of the more fearless. Perhaps
tho most interesting feature of this story,
es; ecially to those who in spite of evidence
are incredulous, is an expressed belief by
not a few people that the murderer will
eventually be made known by the spirit of
the murdered man

A Warning.
Two weeks Bgo we announced that Mr.
Stretchley Cbinn, of Middleburg, had been
fleeced by a sharper ; since that time we
have learned what are reported to be seme
of the facts in the case, and publish them :
"It seems that a young mau, claiming to be
an Agent for the sale of grain fans, ap?
proached Mr. Cbiou and endeavored to in
duce him to act as local agent for the sale of
the faos. Mr. China promptly refused, but
the sharper persisted until he got him to
consent to receive a lot of fans and store

Bold he was to receive $10 Mr. Cbinn.
however, assured the maD that ho would
no; exert himself much to sell them. But
the man insisted that this would get them
introduced into the community, in charge of
an influential citizen and that was all that
was needed, for eo valuable were the ma?
chines that the people would soon haste to
purebn-e, &c. Having thus made a very
fair verbal contract, the sharper suggested
tbut Mr. Cbinn give him something to
ah ow for it, at the same t ma producing a
form of contract which he submitted to Mr.
Cbinn. It being ur-arly dark Mr. C. could
not see very well, and ;> quested the plausi?
ble party to read it, for him. Of course he
was very obliging, and read a contract
which was quite satisfactory to Mr. C, who
ttei sigrei his name to it and the hap?
py swindler got away fiom that vicinity in a
m rry. Mr. C. also kept a copy of the con?
tract which he laid away carelessly and
failed to lind it whin he wanted it; but
when he opened the family Bi >le to read a
chapter, there lay the contract. He took it
up and read it carefully, and for the first
titat learned its true character. Ho then
saw that he had signed a contract to take
end pay for a largo number of the fanning
mills. Ho at once hurried in search ofthe
sharper and found him in Warrenton (we
be icve) and had him arrested ; but so solid
w?s the bond that he could not break it or
g-t away from it. Tho swindler finally
agreed to compromise by reducing the
number of mills to 25, which Mr. C. accept?
