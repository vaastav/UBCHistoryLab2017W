It is all duo to the Thanksgiving holi

there was likewise a decrease ns com-
l > urod with the corresponding week of
1880. It would scorn , therefore , that the

OUTLOOK poit TITI :
A convention roprosonttnff the
pic of North Dakota will assemble al
Jamestown to-day. The object is t < :
laku action for advancing the cause ol
Stateho6d , and it is expected that the
convention will express the sentlinenl
of the people of North Dakota on the
question of division. Indeed , there i'
nothing it may do more important than
this , for there appears to be remarka
ble obtusnncss on that point among
eastern members of congress , repub
licans as well as democrats. It is said
that they tecall the vote of two years
ago , when North Dakota gave a major
ity against division , and seem un
willing to bo persuaded that
the motives which dictated that
opposition have since bjeti eliminated ,
Hence tlio importance , of a clear ox-
prcssion'by the Jamestown convention
on the question of division , and no doubt
is entertained as to what that expres
sion will be. North Dakota is as heart
ily in favor of division and opposed to
the democratic onc-stito scheme , if all
trustworthy infornintion is not at fault ,
as South Dakota. It is most important ,
however , for the moral effect upon con
gress and public opinion , that her people
ple should make formal declaration of
this fact , nnd this it is expected will bo
done by the Jamestown convention.
Meanwhile those in Washing
ton most deeply Interested in
the question of tlio admission of the
territories do not regard the outlook
for anything being done this winter as
at all promising. The situ itioa is com
plicated. Springer's omnibus bill , pro
viding for the admission of Dakota as a
whole , Washington , Montana and New
Mexico , is pending in the house. The
bill of Senator Platt , to admit South
and organi/.o North Dakota , which was
D.issed by the senate , is also in the
house. Enabling acts for Washington ,
Montana and North Dakota are pend
ing in the hcnato , the first it'imed terri
tory ahead and blocking progress by
reason of the proposed annexation of
the Idaho panhandle. Intelli
gent opinion is that , the only one
ot these that lias a ghot of
a chance of becoming a law this winter
is the omnibus , or four-state bill , witli
the Platt bill incorporated asan amend
ment.
So far as there has been any expres
sion of democratic sentiment in Wash
ington on the territorial question it is
found to still favor the admission of Da
kota as one state and the Inclusion of
Now Mexico with the other territories
which it is proposed to admit. Mr.
Springer , tlio chairman of the house
committee on territories , insists upon
his programme , and ase noted some
dajs ago Mr. Ruidall would enlarge it
by including Utah. There is ver
little probability that the senate
will consent to the admis
sion of New Mexico , for while that ter
ritory has the necessary population ,
much of it is not of a character to be
entrusted with statehood. Utah is of
course out of the question , but it is not
probable that the suggestion of Mr.
Randall will bo favorably regarded by
even any considerable number of demo
crats. It is clear that so far as the party
in control of the house is concerned po
litical considerations arc btill potent in
determining their attitude on this ques
tion , nnd if anything is done at the
present session it will bo brought about
by concessions on the part of the senate.
The demand for concessions , however ,
may bo greater than can bo justly com
plied with.
It is expected that the James
town convention will bo productive of
good results , nnd if it accompUsh noth
ing more than to convincoTJongross
that the people of Dakota are in favor
of division , it will bo of great service.
But there will need to bo a greater
pressure brought at Washington than
can proceed from a single convention ,
and the suggestion that the territories
named for admission send delegates to
the national capital to act together in
furthering their demand for statehood
is worthy of serious consideration by
the people of these territories. The agi
tation must bo vigorously maintained.
Meantime there are conditions pre
liminary to statehood which all those
territories must comply with , and they
should lose no time in doingso. Other
wise oven an extra session of the next
congress might avail them nothing.
Tin ; rnnASuni' nnrom\
The most important statistics con
tained in the annual report of the secre
tary of the treasury , which was laid before -
fore congress yesterday , wore antici
pated by the report of the treasurer of
the United States and iho synopsis em
braced in the president's message. It
may bo worth while to repeat , however ,
that for the ttscal year 1SSS the or
dinary revenues of the government ex
ceeded the ordinary expenditures to the
amount , in round numbers , of one hun
dred and nineteen million dollars. Of
this actual surplus eighty-throe millions
were applied to various purposes , in
cluding the purchase of bonds for the
binkfng fund , leaving a balance as
surplus at the end of the fiscal year ,
Juno 30 , of a fraction over thirty-six
million dollars. The estimates for the
current fiscal year contemplate a sur
plus applicable to the purchase of bonds
of one hundred and four million del
lars. With the present excess of rovo-
nuoovor expenditures maintained the
government would bo enabled to re
deem in advance of maturity all of tlio
four-and-a-half and four pjroont bunds
outstanding , and make a saving to the
treasury thereby , but. the secretary
shows that there would bo a very con-
bidorablo loss to thu people. Moreover ,
a settled policy of maintaining excess
ive revenues to bo applied to the
purchase of bounds would neces
sarily tend to advance the premium , bo
that in the east thu government would
have to pay nearly the whole ol thu in
terest which will acdruo upon the pub
lic debt. In the opinion of the secre
tary , whlaji will bo very generally ac
quiesced in , "to continue taxation with
no other use for its proceeds than such
tin investment is a cruel waste of the
people's money. " Suoh a policy could
liavo the approval only of the bond
holders.
The secretary travoli ever the v/oll-
t roil don ground regarding a reduction
of taxation , proven ting nothing now
either In the way of argument or fact.
Respecting1 silver ho repeats his recom
mendation of last year that congress
shall fix the maximum of silver which
shall belong to the government , and
provide that \\hon \ the amount WM ? ex
ceeded by live million dollars the pnr-
clm o of silver bullion should co.no
until the amount owned -jy the govern
ment should bo again reduced to the
prescribed maximum , or by canceling
United States notes to the amount of the
evce s over the maximum. The very
small nUo-nllnn which this plan received
when first suggested by the secretary of
the treasury is not likely to be enlarged
now , in view of the fact that the gov-
incut's ownership of silver was1 largely
decreased during the pist ioar ,
and the danger which Secro-
tiry Pali-child apprehends from
a continuance ot the present policy
regarding silver appears to grow
steadily less. There is no Indication of
a crisis resulting from a popular revolt
ngnin t silver , as the secretary " ven
tures to predict. * ' That idea may pre
vail in Wall street and the region in
fluenced from there , but it will not bo
found elsewhere.
. There are some good recommenda
tions in the report regarding n reform
ot abuses in the customs service , and it
would seem that congress might give
attention to most of these without ref
erence to future changes in the tvrilT
schedule. Sumo of those abuses have
existed for years , working injury both
to the government and to honest im
porters , and the culpiblo neglect of
congress to provide for their removal
should not bo continued. Congress at
its last session made an appropriation
to enable the secretary of the treasury
to more efficiently enforce the immigra
tion laws , and he believes that here
after the landing of persons prohibited
by the statute can bo prevented. The
inadequate enforcement of the laws has
been the cause of much of the outcry
against immigration , and once they are
properly enforced there will bo little
cxciibo for an anti-immigration move
ment. Other portions , of the report re
late to matters in which the general
public has but little interest.
* '
In spite of the assertions innde'by St <
Louis cattlemen at the icccnt investi
gation it appears that the result of the
Chicago manipulations has really been
to cheapen meat to the consumer.
Reports from eastern cities show that
whilst there is aslight increase in tender
loinsnnd choice i ousting joints them is a
material decrease in the rates for the'
other parts of a beef. There had
been , prior to the appointment of ti con
gressional committee , many wild state
ments in in my papers : il > out the wrong
done to the consumer all over the states
by the unscrupulous ring that bought
range beef cheap and sold it dear. The
last half of the accusation is undoubtedly
false. But it is possible that the other
half is well founded. It is logical
enough that a combination that has
driven all other purchasers out of the
field of competition would fix prices to
suit itself , and would recoup itself for
its fair dealing to the consumer bv un
fair treatment of the producer. There
has been a tendency towards such a
solution ot the problem of getting rich
fast without using the consideration of
the public. It may well bo that the
price which the producer receives for
his range beef affords him only a bare
subsistance and leaves a margin of mill
ions for the combine. Unfortunately in
an era when there is a rage for low
prices amounting almost to frenzy , such
a system evokes an indignation on the
part of the public , which is more than
satisfied with the present state of
things.
But wo must remind our readers that
any departure1 from justice cannot be
winked at without subsequent suffering.
Nemesis dogs the footsteps of an unjust
public no loss than of an unjust man. It
is essential to the well-being of the
great northwest , the true range coun
try , that the profits of the range should
bo divided as widely as possible. Wo
may see in the present condition of
Franco the evils of a system which per
mits the concentration of wealth in a
few hands. Money gained by the accu
mulation in a single hand of business
that should have boon shared among
many is almost invariably abused , not
used. It is used for investment and re
investment , and each fresh outlay is
not the conquest of wild lands , and the
creation of now cities , but the adoption
of processes by which articles can bo
produced at less cost , tit the expense of
labor , At present wo point with pride
to our colossal canning establishments ,
but if wo understood them bettor wo
might view them with alarm. It is not
just that Phil. Armour should squeeze
millions out of the cattle men of the
ranges , and It is not safe to allow him
to do it. Wo may have to resort to the
Athenian oyster shell some day.
EIQIIT years ago California had a popu
lation of about eight hundred and sixty-
live thousand , while curiously enough
Nebraska had a population of about Half
that number. Basing the present popu
lation of California on the vote cast at
the late presidential election , its people
ple number one million three hun
dred thousand. The present population of
Nebraska , instead of being six hundred
and fifty thousand , one-half of Californ
ia's , numbers one million one hundred
thousand as estimated by the votes cast
on November 0. This certainly would
indicate that Nebraska 1ms not only
outstripped California in population
during the past eight years , but is
likely to pass the golden state within a
very short time.

Tliero have been rumors tor some time
past that the Rock Island would enter Lin
coln the coming season , and the indications
nro strong that tlio rumors will prove a
reality. Indeed , there mo some evidences
that go to prove that the load means busi
ness. A shoit time ugo ono of the ab
stractors of tins citv was engaged
to fuinish abstracts of title to .some
seventy-five or eighty pieces of Lin-
coin real estate. The gentleman refused to
give the location of the land or tell for whom
tlio abstracts wore to bo prepared , but fiom
another source it has been learned th.it they
are for the Rock Island i.ulroad company.
Hesidcs , no other road is so apt to build into
Lincoln at this time. The land for winch
Iho abstracts arc wanted are favorably lo
cated for an entering line and depot
giounds. The land is also located at the
point thought to be the most favorable for
the Rock Island to enter the city. Fiom the
evidences at hand there uro good reasons for
the citi/cns of the city to anticipate the com
ing of this road during the next year. This
will give Lincoln another boom that will
riyal that of a year ago ,
FESTIVAL , OP Cn\NUK\ .
The Jewish citizens of Lincoln celebrated

of the orthodox Jewish church , conducted
the services , nnd they were beautiful indeed.
One of the most atlractivo parts of Iho ser-
Tice was a procession of tifly children , each
carrying a banner upon which was msciibed
the name of the festival , surmounting which
wasncioss upon which were eight lighted
candles. A chorus of llfty voices , led by tlio
rabbi , sang an apnropnato lijmn while ihe
procession marched mound Iho hall. At the
conclusion of the ceremonies nil sat down lo

occasion. 1'ully 1 ! > 0 poisons cnjo\edlhoio

The burning of railroad trains with tlio
consequent loss of life during the last few
years seouis to have pretty thoroughly awak
ened the people of the whole country to thei
necessity for some safer method of boating
coaches than by llros within them. The Km-
piic state was Iho first to take hold of the
question In a practical way , and , from pres
ent appeal nnces , its good example is soon to
bo followed by others. The inilroad com
missioners of Vermont have recommended
the enactment of n similar law , while Miniio-
nesota and othci states arc coming into lino.
While this may be oonsidoied a long step
forward m the offoit to make railway travell
ing safe and comfortable , is theio not just ns
much danger of fire from kciosene oil , In
case ot a wreck i If a car is thrown from the
track is there not an almost nbsoluto cer
tainty of tire when there nro live or six burn
ing lamps in It tilled with nuch a dangerous
substance to bo spread over the interior of

MINNEAPOLIS , Dec. 4 ( Special Telegram
to TUB BKK.I When Charley -Mitchell was
in Minneapolis two years ago ho met Patsy
Cardiff in a plovo contest and failed to "do"
the Minneapolis man ns easily us ho In
tended. When leaving ho remarked that
the next time he came hero ho would whip
"that d - d Irishman. " Mitchell and Kil-
rain will probably appear hero this winter :
Cardiff was asked his opinion of Mitchell.
"When Charley Mitchell comes to Minne
apolis , if he comes at all , I propose to have a
htllo interview with him , " said Patsy Cardiff
to-day. "I have llttlo respect for the Kil-
rain-Mitchell exhibitions. I prefer witness
ing a contest between pugilists when they
are in dead earnest. Hut what I want to say
isthat when Charley Mitchell was hero taefoio
he made the declaration ilmt if ho over
came hero agnin ho would whip mo. Now I
don't ' think that any Charley Mitchell can
whip me , nnd I am only too anxious to face
him once more m the siiuaro ring. Mitchell
is n good boxer and a hard hitter , but ho is
