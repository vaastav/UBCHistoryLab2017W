WA8HINOTOM, Dec. 2. TAwo comments
were made to-day on the annuat menage
reftPraldcnt WlUon to Concrete
f Representative Fes (Ohio), chairman
of the Republican Congressional. Commit
tee: "The message was a series of con.
- tradlctlonn. The president Uri down gen-
i ral principles which are commendable in
many repecta and then suggests methods
of application of these principles which
an complete nullification of his Idea. I
f like his strong tone about enforcement
fftVr, but dls'lko other portions of the
sacra which deprive his recommenda
of Its force. Ho Indicts the prln
f of a protective tariff and then In
vokes If In behalf .of tho dyeituff In
dustry. "Ills suggestion about, democratization
of labor Is the first step toward 'Rus
sian KovletUm. If- labor In Its own
right must have a part In the direction
of nil Industry, then of Its own right It
will demand a majority of that control.
JDf suggestion for the licensing of Inter-
tftftt business la impossible,
tractive thought In the entire mesrage.
It does not contain a word about
economy or the preservation of law and
order, two of the most Important matters
Dorore the country.
Senator King (Utah) : All will agroe
that the Interests of labor should receive
the moet friendly and sympathetic con'
slderatlon. but In my opinion the Amerl
can people are not willing that an Inter
national organization shall have author
ity to control or In any manner Interfere
with our Internal and domestic affairs.
Labor Is essentially an Internal matter.
Senator Underwood (Ala.) : I ap
prove of the message and think It Is up
to the President s fine standard.
Senator UUchcock (Neb.) : Few mes
sages have touched upon more advanced
questions or pointed the way to more en
lightened remedies for exlstlng'evlls. On
the whole the Presidents messago Is
hopeful and recalls to Congress a num
ber of nutters It has neglected to act
upon.
Republican Leader Mondeu twyo.) :
I found myself In agreement with a con
siderable portion of tho views expressed
and tho recommendations made. I was
particularly Interested In tho fact that a
number of specific recommendations were
for the enactment of legislation or the
development of policies already approved
by action of the House or Its commit
tees.
Speaker GUlett (Mass.): I confess I
didn't see any trace of tho President In
the message, and I think that Is a com
pliment to, the President.
Representative Campbell (Kan.) ; ir
the President wroto the messago It Is
the weakest state paper he has ever
preaentod. He gave Congress neither In
formation nor suggestion for the solu
tion of any Important question.

Continuing Its deliberations behind
ciostd doors, the conference discussed
all phases of the tank assigned to It
for more than six hours. Pians tor a
permanent system of mediation or arbl
tratlon of labor disputes, as suggested
by thu President, wero considered. Im

without an attempt being made to put

Stanley King ot Boston, spokesman
for the conference, said the Informal
discussions without stenographic record
probably would continue through the
week, to get all the information possible
before the (delegates, after which prepa
ration of a report would be undertaken.
A committee from the conference.
composed of Secretary Wilson, Herbert
Hoover, former Attorney-General Greg

Michigan Authorities to Tear
Up Basement Floor.
Special DitpaM to Tns Sex.
Lawton, Mich., Dec. 2. Prosecutor
Adams of Van Buren county to-day or
dered men to dig up tho basement floor
in the Tabor home to ascertain whether
there are moro bodies underneath the
pile of shingles where the body of MIs
Maude Tabor, covered with salt and
Jammed Into a trunk, was found Sun
day afternoon by her sister, Mrs. Flor
ence Tabor Crltchlow.
At the request of Van Buren county
authorities the San Francisco police to
day began a search for Mrs. Lester Ta
bor and Walter Tabor, mother and
brother of Maude Tabor. A third per-
oared to buy from abroad and not put
barriers In tho way, tho argument con
tlnucd.
Must Adjust economic Life.
"Whatever therefore may have been
our views during the growth of Ameri
can business concerning tariff legisla
tion," tho message said, "we must now
adjust our own cconomlo life to a
changed condition growing out of the
fact that American business Is full
grown and that America Is the greatest
capitalist In the world."
In this the President Is believed to
have laid the foundation for one plank
of tho Democratic platform of next year.
However, tho President renewed his
recommendations for legislation to pro
tect with high tariffs tho chemical and
dye Industries of the countries born of
war necessity and not yet full grown.
In the message Is included again1 rec
ommendation for favorable consideration
of the plan for providing a small per
entiiKo of the veterans of the war with
land under the same conditions for the
eo'dlers as before. Aid to farmers to
stimulate the production ot the necessi
ties of life Is also urged In the messago.
ho political restlessness throughout
the nation Is, according to the message,
due to the causes which are superficial
ather tlnn deep rooted. It is largely
due, In Mr. Wilson's opinion, to falluro
lo reach formally a basis of peace with
Germany though the war Is long since
actually past and trade re'atlona, even
with Germany, have been resumed to
ome extent "Heartless profiteering"
and the machinations of agitators have
something to do with It, too, tho mes-
-liigo sum.. However, in aeaung wnn
mis situation, the President urged Con
cress not to be "Impatient or drastic.'
The enactment of more legislation de
signed to lower living costs wou'd help
ttreatly In the solution of tho problem, It
was declared.
The mesage concludes with n warn-
'ng that the billot Is the Instrument of
cform In tho United States.
"Let those beware who would take the
ihorter road of disorder and revolution
-ild the President "The right road Is
he road of Justice and orderly process.'

preciating standard.
Senator Smoot smiled: nnd bo did
Senator Thomas. But the latter an
nounced later that ho was going to mnko
a speech on the monoy question In n few
days. It was Intimated that ho will
produce some of the sound money argu
ments of 1906 and following campaigns
and deliver them with merely one
change tho substitution of the word
silver for gold, and vlco versa.
The Smoot bill provides that legal
tender character shall be given to sold
certificates so that thereafter gold cer
tificates may be Issued In denominations
of l and fa. This, he explained, If
necessary because the high value of
silver Is driving It out of tho country
a,nd out of circulation. But this Is not
all. The steadily rising price of sliver
has now made the metal In a djjllar
worm more as mental thin as money;
so thro Is tendency to melt up the dol
lars that nro In circulation and sell the
silver.
Washington. Dec. 2. Increase of
