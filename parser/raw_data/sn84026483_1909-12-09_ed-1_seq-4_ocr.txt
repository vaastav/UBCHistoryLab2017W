ThE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
President Taft's first annual
message was read in both houses
nf Congress Tuesday ana Doth
houses adjourned until tomorrow
The President's message would
take up some 20 or more columns
of The Kobesonian. but the aver
&se reader would stumble
through some six columns with
out interest, when perhaps faint
interest would be aroused by
reference to the situation in
Nicaragua. Reference is made
to the two Americans recently
nut to death by order of Presi
dent Zelaya and the termination
of diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government, and it is stat
edthat the government is intend
ing to. take such future steps as
maybe found most consistent
with its dignity, but no specific
recommendations regarding the
crisis , in Nicaragua are made.
After wading laboriously through
others columns one finds some
thing really interesting about
thePostoffice Department deficit,
-which is- caused largely by the
low rate of postage on second
class matter newspapers, maga
zines and miscellaneous periodi
cals. The actual loss growing out
of the transmission of this mat
ter atl cent a pound amounts to
about $63,000,000 a year, while
the average cost to the govern
ment of the transportation of
this matter is 9 cents a pound.
The average distance over which
newspapers are delivered is 291
miles; while the average haul of
magazines is 1,049. In 1907 sec

imposing upon magazines and
periodicals a higher rate of post

than newspapers, contain a much
higher proportion of advertising
