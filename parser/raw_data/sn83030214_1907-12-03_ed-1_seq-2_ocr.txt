It made its way to the anteroom, for on each
Elde of the little leader there towered a mas

man of the Republicans, and James holding the
same honor for the opposition.
When the Speaker entered he faced a wildly
shouting body of legislators, which would not
be subdued until the gavel had descended many
times on the marble table. Mr. Cannon spoke
as follows:

AN ILLUSTRATION
OF THE HIGH QUALITY of the INSTRUMENTS OFFERED IN THE
PIANO SALE
NOW TAKING PLACE AT AEOLIAN HALL
CHICKERING Upright at $375
CHICKERING Upright at $195
r ■ grasp the full significance of this illustration it must first be understood
I that a piano is never oxtered for sale at Aeolian Hall unless its condition is
-*- such as to warrant the Aeolian Company's recommendation.
This being the case, it becomes apparent that a piano like the Chickering,
which can be bought at Aeolian Hall for as little as $195, constitutes a bargain
in the truest sense of the word.
Logically, the same relation between high intrinsic value and low price
exists throughout the entire stock of instruments offered. Hence the Chick
ering at $375 is obviously qi a quality and in a condition far superior to what is
found in Exchanged Pianos sold' elsewhere.
THE SALE INCLUDES:
5 Webers 6 Steinways 4 Sfecks 6 Chlckerfngs
4 Kranich & Bachs 4 Wheelocks 2 Gablers 6 Halites Bros.
and over 50 other miscellaneous uprights ranging in price from
SftO Up.
Ir.variab'y those who attend th? Special Sales at Aeolian Hal' are
impressed with the wonderfully fine condition of the pianos exhibited.
Prices published by other houses on Exchanged Pianos may sometimes
be lower, but the actual value cf the instruments themselves cannot con
pare xvith those at Aeelian Hall. '<'•' '-■'* •
The explanation iiss in the fact that the Pianola^ Piano brings us
Exchanged Pianos of a far better grade and quality than are received
by other concerns. •,
It is now generally recognized that at Aeolian Hall the purchaser receives
far grejitr value for whatever sum he spends than he can possibly obtain elsewhere.

defend the country and be honest with it.
The successful Republican candidates for the
minor official costs of the House were then
elected, and committee named to inform the
President and the Senate that the House of
Representatives had convened.
At this stage of the proceedings the cus
tomary Democratic protest against the adoption
of the rules of the last House was expressed
by Mr. Williams and Mn. De Armond. of Mis
souri, with one Republican, Mr. Cooper, of Wis
consin, to the edification of the eallerles. The
former contented himself with a formal dissent,
but the latter indulged in fiery declamation
against "tyranny and oppression." As the
speakers and every one cite expected, the rules
were adopted. •
DRAWING FOR SEATS.
The excitement of drawing for seats followed,
and to this end the floor was desert ed and the
members gathered in rows behind the railing
about the back of the ball. A huge box contain
ing nearly four hundred niarbles, rattling and
clicking, was brought from the background, but
not before Sereno E. Payne. John Sharp Will
iams, J. Warren Keifer, General Bingham and
General Isaac Sherwood, a returned and aged
member from Ohio, obtained the privilege of
choosing their seats. This was done out of
deference to the places occupied by Representa
tives Payne and Williaans as floor leaders and
in consideration of the age and st rvice of Rep
resentatives Keifer, Bbigham and Sherwood.
The clerk shook the box several times and
the lottery was begun. The number represented
by Mr. Burleson, of Texas, lirst was grasped
by the hand of the blindfolded boy who was
assisting:, and the smiling lawmaker walked
proudly down the centre aisle and dropped into
a seat of vantage. Then came Representative
Goldfogle. of New York, and Representative
Rodenburg, of Illinois. All <>f thene hurried to
the front of the rows and sat with great com
fort in the chairs near the Speaker. Repre
sentative Lafean obtained Representative Hep
burn'? place and gallantly gave it up to its for
mer owner. Representative Tawney also was
fortunate in coming again into his own, while
Representatives Oicott. Burton and Alexander,
after some skirmishing, found themselves at
home in their former locations. The entire New
Y..rk delegation obtained desirable places, trie
Republicans being grouped in the left centre,

with the exception of Representatives Porter
and Andmis. who are on the last aisle. Mr.
Porter's name was among the last to be called,
and some interest was manifested as to which
side he would choose. Through the courtesy
at Mr. Alexander he was conducted to a chair
on the Republican fide, amid the applause of
some of his colleagues. Bourke Cotkran trans
ferred himself from the back to the front row.
while Representative Fitzgerald is worse off
than any other New Yorker because of hie
distance from the Speaker. The "Cherokee
Strip," on the Democratic side is again neces
sarily employed by the Republicans, twenty
three of whom were forced over to undesirable
places on that Bide. After all had been seated,
fortunate or unfortunate, the House adjourned
out of respect to the Alabama Senators, Messrs.
Morgan and Pettus. who died in the recess.
ALDRICH RETICENT ON CURRENCY,
Says He Has No Idea What Confess
Will 80.
fTrom The Tribune Bureau. 1
Washington, Dec. 2.— When Senator Aldrlch hur
ried into the President's office at 11:30 o'clock this
forenoon the members of CoagTW and visitors in
the anteroom Fat up and took notice.
"He has come to frame up currency legislation
with the rresident." Raid one of the Congressmen.
"When Aldrich comes there's something big on
the carpet;" exclßimed another.
But when the Senator hurried out three minutes
after his arrival they al! pave a sigrh of disap
pointment.
"We diiln't say a word about money," raid
Senator Aidrtrh. with one of his pleaaut smiles,
"Do you think there will be a new currency law
passed this session?" he was asked.
■'Ho« can I tell?" lie replied, with a smile. ."I
have not had time to talk about the matter with
a single bouL I haven't the remotest idea what
will be done, so do not care to discuss the mat

As Senator Aldrieh was about to leave the White
House Senator Kean offered to take him nlonsr in
his caniage.
"I've got to walk." replied the Rhode Island
Senator. "I've got a cold and want to exercise It
out. Got It the other day ridiny about in Senator
Proctor's wheezy old automobile."
"That oug-ht to teach you a Irnaon. keep away

W HURRY ON FINANCE.
Leaders in Congress Believe Emer
gency Has Paseed,
■ [From The Tnbuno Bureau. 1 «
Washington, Dec. 2.— General discussion of the
financial conditions and of legislation pertain
ing thereto among leading Senators and Repre
sentatives reveals the fact that there is a con
sensus of opinion that within thirty days there
will be a greater amount of money than the
banks can conveniently handle, and that there Is
absolutely no occasion for emergency legislation-
It Is believed that there will be a contraction of
business all along the iine, a curtailment of
manufacturing and production, not nece ssarliy
serious, buTample to release a considerable^por
tion of borrowed capital now employed, with the ,
result that the bank reserves will grow rapidly.
The leaders in Congress do not. therefore, con ;
template early financial legislation, insisting
that it is too important a subject to be dealt
with hurriedly, especially when the occasion
for prompt action ha 3 passed «.d it Is_ in
timated that no additional enactment is likely
to occur before spring. Of fo"^..^l^f o "^..^ l^

measure to offset Mr Burton's *-«PM!jtment
at not obtaining a seat on Way. and Means.

Mr. Bcveridge'B Bill Likely To Be
Buried in Committee.
[From The Tribune Bureau. 1
M-a^incrton Dec 2 -Senator BeverWge. of Indi
ana has Pr"pa«d and will submit to the Senate
at a "ulUbli opportunity a bill providing for a
comnilsSon of financial and business expert,, not
mTmbors of < 'ongres. to examine the schedules g
the Dlngley tariff and make recommendations to
Congress of su.h changes as seem advisable. In
cldenially Mr. Beveridge, who has some emphatic
views on the necessity of tariff revision, is making
a valiant flgbt to obtain the seat on the Finance
Comimttee made vacant by Mr. Spooner's resigna
tion.
Mr. Beveridge wi!l probably address the Senate
on the subject of his bill, and It is possible that
Fom- of the Democrats m.iy seize the occasion to
discuss the tariff, but the indications are clear
that when the measure is referred to the Commit
tee on Finance It will not again see the light of
day, and it is regarded as probable that Mr. Beyer
idge's efforts to become a member of that commit
tee will prove unavailing.
It is declared by the Senate leaders that Congress
will never consent to delegate Its authority to re
adjust the tariff schedules to any commission at
experts, and that efforts to induce it to do so must
prove futile. It will be recalled that In one of his
cany messages the President recommended tha
j creation of a tariff commission such as Mr. Bever
idge now suggests, but tho recommendation w-aa
quietly Ignored by Congress.
THIRD TERM TALE DENIED
No New Statement^ Made by the
President.
[From Tha Tribune Bureau.)
Washington, Dec. Representative Hinshaw. of
Nebraska, carried around a first class sensation
for half an hour to-duy. Then it turned out that
the st-nsa^tion didn't amount to much, after ull.
ilr. Hinshaw is an enthusiastic third termer and
comes from a district where, he Bays, tho voters
are resolved to tie the President hand and foot If
necessary to put him. into the White House for an
other four years. In a fivt minute talk that the Ne
braskan bad uilh the President to-day he told tuo
Executive that the people of his state and district
hoped he would run in order to give them a chance
to show him their admiration and loyalty. The
President and Mr. Hinshaw also discussed some of.
the administration's policies. .
When Mr. Hinshaw emerged from th,e Presi
dent's office he said that in reply to his remarks
on the third term the President had exclaimed:
"I don't Intend to deviate one iota from what I
have already said."
To Mr. Hinshaw this was portentous in the ex
treme, for It looked to him as though there was
no hope of the President running again. The
Kebraskan visited the Capitol after he left the
White House, and there repeated "the President's
latest third term announcement."
In about an hour the tale got back to the White
House with the usual frills, ■ and there it was
promptly and emphatically set down as a mistake.
"The President was discussing his policies, and
not tho thifd term question, when he made use of
those words," said Secretary Loeb after seeing the
President. "Mr. Hinshaw merely got things a
trifle mixed up in his micd."'
Later in the day, when confronted with the of
ficial denial from the White House, Mr. Hinshaw
acknowledged that perhaps he had .misunderstood
the President after all.

[From The Tribune Bureau.]
Washington, Dec. Although Representative
Peter A. Porter, of New. York, was not allowed
to ta,ke pait in tho Republican caucus, the offi
cial "Congressional Directory" Just issued in
variably lists him as a Republican. His name
appears in three parts of the directory, and in
each case th« significant "R" follows. His se
lection, without a protest from hfs party, of a
seat on the Republican side of the House, to
gether with the official list, is taken to mean
that Mr. Porter will hereafter have to be recog
nized as a Republican.
Representative Ernest F. Achesorj, of Pennsyl

to vote audibly on Saturday in favor of admit
ting Mr. Porter, said to-day that ho considered

SEN I TE COMMITTEES.
31 r. Kuot To Be Chairman of
Rules — Other Assignments.
[From The Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. Dec. 2.— The Republican caucus of
the Senate to-day adopted a resolution authoriz
ing its chairman. Senator Allison, to appoint the
committee on committees, and he was immediately
besieged by Senators who sought to obtain recog
nition of their claims to preferment. Mr. Allison
will not announce the composition of. the commit
tee for a day or two. but in the mean time the
assignment of the moro important places will be
pretty well determined. Senator Hemcnway. of
Indiana, is slated for the vacancy on Appropria
tions caused by the failure of Senator Wetmore to
obtain re-election before the convening of Con
fMM. It is believed that llr. Hcmenway's long
experience >jn the Appropriations Committee of the
House will render him especially useful on this
committee.
Senator Knox is slated for the chairmanship of
the Committee on Rules in place of Mr. Spooner.
This is regarded as one of the most dignified com
mittees of the Senate, and, while its work is not
arduous, there are occasions when it becomes ex
tremely responsible. As chairman of this com
mittee it will fall to Mr. Knox to assign tho rooms
In the Capitol, and he will have entire charge of
the ceremgntes attending the inauguration of the
President and Vice-President.
Tho seat on Finance made vacant by Mr.
Spooners resignation will doubtless go to Mr.
Hopkins, of Illinois, although Senator Beveridge
would like the place.
The desirable seat on Foreign Relations which
Mr. Spooner MWtftl will presumably po to a
WVst'-rn man, and Senator Knute. Nelson, of
Minnesota, is conducting an active campaign to
get it, while Senator Perkins, of California, is also
under consideration.
The absence of Senator Millard leaves Senator
Platt the ranking member of tho Committee on
Intei-oi-eanlc Tanals, but as Mr. Platt is atta ..■hod
to his present chairmanship, that of Printing, i;
is presumed that Senator Kittredge will succeed
to the chairmanship of the former committee.
An effort will be made to hold tho chairmanship
of the Committee f.n I/!>rary for Senator Wetmore,
whose re-election next month is regarded as as
sured.
