LLUSTRATED HOLIDAY MINER.
A Rt liable Collection of Facts for
Residents and Immigrants.
In conformity with its usual custom the
Miner will issue a Holiday edition which will
far surpass any picvious effort in the newspa
per line ever attempted in Montana. The H«l
IDAr Mines will be a complete encyclopedia
of the almost boundless resources of ibis mag
nificent Territory and will present in a condens
ed form the present status of eveiy Industry
pursued within its borders. Especial pains will
be takeu to give reliable data concerning its
great mineral wealth, its agricultural resources
and unequalled stock raising facilities, togeth
er with its early domestic and political history,
and of all other matters through the intelligent
presentation of which a correct estimate may
be formed concerning the marvellous richness
of this unrivalled Territory. One of the promi
nent features of the Holiday edition will be
carefully compiled statistics which will show
the rapid growth and development of the Terri
tory and its present standing as a wealth pro
ducing section of the Great West. The ablest
writers In the Territory have been engaged to
contribute to Its columns,;and no pains or ex
pense will be spared to make it tue most
haustive, reliable and interesting compendium
of facts ever presented to the Montana public.
Theediiion will be issued in a convenient lorm
for reference and preservation and willbeprc
usely illustrated, containing, among others,
cuts of the prominent mills, smelters, churches,
stores, public buildings and private residences
in Silver Bow county, together with a splen
didly executed view of Hutte City. It willcon
tiin thirty-two pages with lour columns to the
page, making in ail one hundred ami twenty
eight columns of choice illustrations and enter
taining and reliable reading matter, in new
type and fine book paper. It is proposed to
make it an invaluable acquisition to
the library of the merchant, miner, agricultur
ist, mechanic, speculator, and to a ! others in
the various businesses of life. It is desired tha
every portion of the Territory shall be repre
sented in its columns, and to this end we re
spectrally invite contributions from the many
frieuds of the Miner throughout Montana. Ten
thousand copies will be issued. Orders from
home or abread wili receive prompt attention.
Single copies 20 cents. Six copies SI; twenty
five copies; S-l; fifty copies, ^7; owe hundred
copies, $12.50. A satisfactory reduction will he
made on orders for larger numbers.
TH3 ENLARGED MINER.
It is with a pardonable d*gree of pride the
publishers of the Miner present to its read

vertiziug space and a desire to present to the
reading public the current news of the world
in its columns render this step imperatively
necessary at the present time. This is the
third enlargement of the Miner and we can
assure its frteuds that it will uot be the last |
if the growing business interests of Butte and ;
those of the Territory require the still further j
expansion ef its columns* The Mikbb will j

erous public. A complete font of new type |

aid as soon as the immense Holiday edition !
of the Miner is struck off it will be used up
on the Daily and Weekly. Arrangements
have been completed by which we will be
able to give daily full telegraphic reports. In
addition to these no efforts will be spared to
make the Miner a first-class newspaper in
every respect. We take this occasion to ex
tend to our numerous pattons our thanks for
the generous support wmc>. -uey have ae
5 rded it.
A Washington dispatch of the 7th states
that Frelinghuysen is to be Secretary of Slate
and Brewster Attorney General, and that
there will be no other changes at present in
the Cabinet. The nominations of Freling
tuyseu and Brewster will be sent in to-mor
row.
The extraordinary loss of life from the
burning of a theatre iu Vienna again calls
public attention to the necessity of construct
ing public buildings with a view to the pre
vention of such catastrophes, by providing
ample meaua of egress and well lighted pas
sages.
What the good name and credit of Mon
tana business men may not sutler by the tail
ure reported in the dispatches to-day, it is I
proper to state that the bankrupts are not in
fact Montana men, but camp followers along
the Northern Pacific, hading from St. Paul
and doing business at Glendive.
The Pope has been granted permissioa to
make four new saints. At the consistory
held at Boue on the 2d inst-, after a short al
location, the Pope asked the dignitaries as
sembled whether thsy approved the project
for canonization of the following-named four:
Labre, De Rossi, Laurent and Glaire. Unan
imous approval was expressed.
An interesting breach-of-promise case is in
progress in New York—Miss Ulluian, of i
tbat city, vs. Mr. Meyer, of Richmond, Vir
ginia. The parties are Jews in higb life.
Meier saw the pretty Ida, and loved, and be
lieved that he was beloved. After engage
ment. however, the fair ou* told him that she
did not love him, but acting on the advice of
her mamma she accepted him as a good
catch. This aroused in Meyer the demon of
investigation, and he discovered Miss Uli
man's "ice-crenea young man." She may
have had a theatre young man, a buggy
riding young man, and no doubt such con
veniences ior hops, picnics, oyster suppers,
etc., although the evidence does not disclose
thorn. Now, the moral of this feast ia that
conveniences of this kind are liable to make
trouble, and the "fair sect," as A. Ward
would remark, should manage to dispt nse
with them.
FINANCIAL MATTERS.
The report of Comptroller Knox is an ex
ceedingly Interesting document from one of
the recognized ablest financiers of the coun
try. The total number of National banks in
operation Öct. 1st, were 2,1121. The estima
ted losses to creditors from failures of banks
during the eighteen years since the passage of
the act, was $6,240,000; average annual loss,
about $349,000. The Comptroller calls at
tention to the opportunity bankers haye for
the derange ment of the circulating medium
Bonds deposited by national banks to secure
circulation have been frequently called by
the Secretary, and the banks may therefore
have occasion to withdraw them after the in
terest has ceased, and it it important that
they continue to have this privilege on de
posit of lawful money as now provided by
law. If banks, either National, State or
private bankers, should at any time desire to
derange the money market, they can do so
independent of any legislation by Congress,
by calling in their demand loans. Such a
course would be more easy of accomplish
ment than depositing legal tender notes in
the Treasury, and would be mach more
effective. If, however, Congresj shall deem
it advisable to prevent the banks from depos
iting in the Treasury for this purpose, larger
: ainouuls 0 f co iu or other lawful money, then
! 4 ()f th( , ^ of June> 20i m4) may
be so amended as to require those desiring to
withdraw bonds to giTe reasonable notice of
tueir intention before completing the transac
tion.
The comptroller, without suggesting legis
latiun, merely points out where it is needed.
We cannot withstand the power and influ
ence of the national banking interest, but he
suggests wherein the system can perpetuate
itself without, prohibitory legislation. The
banks, under tlie'present laws, renew their ex
istence if they so desire, and in the absence
of prohibiting legislation, many of them un
j doubtedly w ill, on the expiration of their
present charters, organize new associations,
will elect nearly the same stockholders as be
fore, and will then apply for and obtain from
the complro 1er certificates authorizing them
to continue business for twenty years from
the respective dates of their new organiza
tion. Certificates in such a course of pro
cedure will he peifeclly legal, and indeed,
I under existing laws, the comptroller has no
discretionery power on the matter, but nec
essarily sanctions the organization of such as
sociations as shall have conformed in all re
spects to legal requirements.
The Democratic platform adopted at Cin
i cinnati last year declared for: "Ilonest
! money—the strict maintenance ot the public
faith—consisting of gold and silver and paper
convertible iuto coin on demand." This was
esteemed hostile to the national banking sys
tem, and Democratic stockholders in those
institutions were assessed for a campaign
| food to be used in promoting ihe election of
; a Republican President. It is a power in the
j R Q d that dominates Congress, and cannot be
j ® as Ry overturned until the bonds of the gen
] eia ' government, which form the basis of the
j system, shall have been completely extin
! gmshed. The only point to which the Comp
j troller directs attention is the danger from
disarrangement of the currency ihrbugh con
traction which may be accomplished liy the
withdrawal of hank circulation. He states
t*' e increase in the circulating medium to be
*350,000,000 sine* resumption. This consists
coin, gold and silver certificates, natioual
destroyed
bank notes and legal tenders. The prosper
ity of the country indicates that its present
volume is commensurate with the business
wants of the country. If any large portion
of it should he immediately withdrawu from
circulation financial distress would inevitably
follow. It is important, then, that the vol
ume should De a fixed quantity, to he aliect
ed only by the requirements of business.
A matter intimately connected with this
subject, but to winch the Comptroller does
not call attention, is the profit arising from
trrency, the advantage of
which is Buff gained by the national banks.
The November statement of the public debt
shows that the matured bonded indebtedness
•f the country is over $11,300,000. It is all
over eight years past maturity, and is proba
bly lost. The fractional currency is carried
on the books at nearly $15,5000,000. TLe
treasury books ha-e been coirected by esti
mating over $7,000,0&0 lost or destroyed, but
the probability is that almost the entire
amount is of that character. The debt of
the United States bearing no interest is $484,
750,000. The probability is that at least one
haif of this amount will never be presented
for redemption. II requires bat a cursory ex
amination of financial matters to show the
immense'prefit arising from this source, fiom
which the government and people should de
rive tho full benefit and nut private corpora
tions.
The types made us say yesterday that the
enlarged Daily Miner was the largest daily
paper published east of Chicago. The notice
was written " west of Chicago," aud in the
hurry incident to enlargement the error went
iuto the edition without collection. The San
Francisco Bulletin aud Salt Lake Tribune
a i e the two largest papers in the region spok
en of, and by spreading the Daily Miner
upou either of tliesa sheets it is easy to see
how much they are oyersized.
Gorham appears to have "got left" In the
organization of the Senate. A few days*

decisiou by tl.e course of my distinguished
friend from Vermont, eminent as a leader of

private worth. Upou his motion, the present

Ti
STOCKS.
The decline which has been noticed In the
quotations ef the Alice stock in the New
Y ork market for some time past has been re
markable, and has originated a fear in our
midst that the reputation of this, which we
claim to be the richest mining camp en the
continent, might suffer abroad on account of
such depreciation. The latest quotations of
the Alice are, December 1st, f$.8C asked, no
bidders, and there is on the streets to-day a
report which gains credence from former low
quotations, that a large block ef Alice slock
stock sold yesterday-in New Y ork al $2.85
Considerable speculation is indulged in con
cerning the cause of this decline—whether
the principal holders are unloading the stock
or making a deal, or whether the market for
mining stocks has been flattened by the de
clire of the Robinson Consolidated and other
Leadville properties. Alice stock at $2.85 is
a good buy, and raining men hero would
gladly invest in it at that price. The entire
at that figure would represent an actual
cash value of $1,140000 for two good mines,
and improvements costing over half a mil
lion dollars. If any lesson is to he deduced
from this condition of things it is, that the
New York Stock Exchauge is a poor place to
work Butte mines. The Lexington mine
was recently sold for $1,000,000 and a certain
percentage of the stock to Be issued thereon.
Shares of stock in this mine are quoted ou the
Paris market al $52, which would placej the
ratable value of the mine at $5,200,000. Id
the event that the buyers of this should
never realize oti their investment, it is quite
possible that the accomplished Parisian
would want no more of stock in Bntte mines.
There is in the matter more than appears
on the suiface. The interests of every man
in the community are, to a greater exteut
than is commouly appreciated, involved in
these matters. The owner of real estate
does not like to he confronted with any sus
picion that his property is liable to shrink in
value oue-half. The holder of undeveloped
mining property does not like to contempla-#
a stale of things that will forbid the sale of
his property or shut him out from getttng
pecuniary assistance lor development. The
laborer and mechanic cannot regard with
any degree of satisfaction a state of affairs
that will check improvement or tho working
of the mines. The business man cannot
complacently contemplate a field where he is
liable to have to deal with impoverished cus
tomers. The whole i f us are vitally inter
ested that there shall he confidance in the
minds of foreign capitalists to send their
means here for investment. It will be far
better for us «hen it becomes the fashion for
men to bring their capital here rather than
send it. The idea that mines can be listed
upou some, stock board aud worked by out
side companies is most pernicious to the com
munities where the mines are situated. It
may he advautageous to a few shrewd manip
ulators, but it is disastrous to the reputable
business men, mechanics, laborers and mine
owners cf a camp.
The New Yolk Truth speaks of the action
of the Philadelphia Stock Board iu striking
from their list a number of swindling mining
schemes, it mentions mines having nothing
but a load of debt and a spavined mule. Of
the management of ruin-s seuerally appear
ing ou stock boards it says : "But the real
management of the mines is not governed by
the bona fide stockholders. The output is
regulated entirely by the varying require
ments of the stock jobbing gang, who never
dream ot making money by the legitimate
returns of the mine, but in turning over the
slock. If it were a mere matter of the pub
lic and the operators ia rly dealing with each
other, the advantage gained by one or the
other would not call for much attention.
But as the case now stands, the opetatois
have the entire puli, aud oniy secure their
victims by resorting to unqualified roguery.
The "pool" dictate to their representatives at
the mines, and do not hesitate to wreck a
property in order to depreciate the stock. The
stockholders are helpless."
The Sait Lake Herald, commenting on the
President's suggestion for the suppression of
polygamy, fays : " It is evident, however, that
he does not understand the question, or he
would not. make the suggestions embodied in
his remarks ; for neither of the provisions
that he recommends, embodied in laws,
would (prove of material benefit iu efforts to
suppress the practice of polygamy." That is
about t>>e size of it ; it is obviouslv rather a
Ti illicit it matter to get at the facts that trans
pire in a Mormon endowment house,
A Washington dispatch of the 7th gives the
following statement of the probable admis
sion of Campbell as Delegate from Utah;
President Arthur's vigorous utterances upon
the Mormon question give unalloyed satis
faction to the Pacific Coast people and all
other opponents of polygamy, and will pio
bably have a decided influence ou the result
of the pending contest in regard to the ad
mission of Campbell as an anti-Mormon
Delegate. It is considered highly probable
that the Republican members of the House
will solidly sustain bpeaker Keifer in the
position taken by him to-day iu favor of
Campbell and these combined influences
will also, it is believed, be reinforced by
many Democratic members whose abho-
rence of Mormonism will lead them to for
go the possible advantage of embaraassing
the Republican Speaker, which is apparent
ly the purpose of the opposition led by ex
Speaker Randall, so that on the whole
Campbell's admission seems to be pretty well
assured.
A New Yerk dispatch of the 7th says : The
Post's Washington special says: Western
CoriLiessmen, notably the represen:atives
from bullion producing States, are violently
opposed to the recommendations of ■ he Pres
ident and Secretary Folger, that coii are cf
silver do! lars be stopped, and silver certificates
b* withdrawn. Representative Bellord, of
Colorado, speakuig for thL sentiment says
such a policy will alienate the bullion States,
against which it discriminates. It will be as
unpopular there, as a suggestion to rep.-ai die
duty ou iron would be iu Fennsylva- ia. K
President Arthur desires to make war on my
State, 1 shall not support him in his polity.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
A synopsis of this document, containing all
the general public care to read, appeared in
our last issue. The full text is of unusual
length, and is a pains-taking document, en
tering minutely into the minor affairs of the
government. The message appropriately
opens with the calamity that had befallen
the American people in the assassination of
President Garfield, and speaks of the gratify
ing tributes of sorrow received from the na
tions composing the federation of mankind.
Ti e harmonious relations of this government
with foreign nations arg rsfrrred to, and iu
this connection the Yorktown celebration as
an evidence of international good feeling.
The bi-metallic congress at Paris is referred
to briefly, and without, any expression of
views upon its labors.
The lengthy portion ef the message devo
ted to foreign relations is unimportant furth
er than showiug the efforts of tho govern
ment to protect the rights of naturalized
American citizens abroad and the advance
ment of the commercial interests of citizens
dealing with foreign countries. It appears
from tho following extract that the lailway
interest has rtceived valuable governmental
aid in its schemas in Mexico : "The govern
ment has lost no occasioa of encouraging the
Mexican government to a beneficial realiza
tion of the mutual advantages which wilt re.
suit from more intimate commercial inter
course and from opening the rich interior of
Mexico to railway enterprise."
The reference to the inter-oceanic canal
merely recites our treaty obiigatious with
Columbia, aud the subsequent proposition of
that Stats to European powers to guarantee
the neutrality of the canal, without entering
upon any discussion of that question from
the standpoint enunciated by the Monree
doctrine.
Mention is made of the sending of a spec
ial envey to reconcile the differences between
Chili and Peru.
A regret is expressed on account of the
withdrawal of the lines of communication
between Brazil and this country, which is
merely a delicate hint in aid of the parties
now seeking a subsidy for a steamship line to
Brsziliau ports.
The statement is made that the Emperor of
Japan contemplates the establishment of a
constitutional government, a remarkable step
towards assimilating with Western systems,
and which cannot fail to bring that country
into closer relationship with ourselves.
Ti # message views with concern the replen
ishment of the decaying native population
of the Sandwich Islands from outward
sources to a degree which may impair their
native sovereignty and independence. With
out suggesting any remedy for the inevitable
ownership and domination of those islands
by the Chinese, it. merely alludes to the
fact.
The adoption of the new code of interna
tional rules to prevent collisions at sea is
recommended.
Attention is called to the action of the na
tional board of kealth iu instituting measures
to preve lit the introduction and spread of con
tagions and infectious diseases.
f he report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury is transmitted with Presidential com
mendation. The view» and interests of Wall
street seem to predominate and shape the
views of the piesent administration. The
repeal of the law requiring the coinage of
$2,000,000 in silver per month, is recommend
ed ; also the early retirement of the silver
certificates aud the repeal of the act requir
ing their issue. The concurrence of the
President in these Treasury views shows him
to he an extreme menometaliist, and liiat the
hopes of the silver producing countries must
rest with a conservative Congress rather than
a monopoly serving administration.
The custom house antecedents of the
President leads him to devote much space to
the sources of our revenues from customs,
without, however, any recommendation upou
the subject.
llefer-uce is made to the action of the
former Secretary of the Treasury iu contin
uing the matured bouds of the government
at 81, per cent, interest, and the following
eelio of the wishes of Wall street upon this
subject appears in the message : "Unless the
bonds can he funded at a much lower rate of
interest than they now hear, I agree with
tlie Secretary of the Treasury that no legis
lation respecting them is desirable."
The message predicts that, at the present
rate of decrease, the natioual debt will be
extinguished in ten years, aud suggests that
the penile be relieved of some of the bur
dens of taxation, and urges especially tbe re
peal of the law by which bauks and bankers
are assessed upon their capital and deposits.
These suggestions are uo doubt based upon
the views of those who esteem a national
debt a nationat blessing, and who desire that
there shall ever remain government bonds
upon which to hypothecate for banking pur
poses.
The message suggests a revision of the tar
iff, and in that connection says that import
ant changes should be made with caution that
a due regard may bo paid to tbe confi'eting
interests of our citizens. That is, those that
are enjoying monopolisa should not be radi
cally disturbed. Tbe President is a protec
tionist and can be relied on by the manufaV
turing interest.
The message concurs in the recommenda
tion of the Secretary of War that the army
should be increased to 30,900.
The Iudiau troubles of the past year, with
which tbe public are familiar through the
public journals, are detailed in tbe message.
The message treats the Indian question at.
great length, and seems to favor a continu
ance of the peace policy, so called, which has
predominated for several years. It recom
mends that the local laws in force in settle
ments contiguous to Indian countries be
made applicable to the Indians, and that there
he an allotment of laud in severalty and upt
alienable to Indians for their present welfare
and permanent advancement. These are the
identical views promulgated by Commissioner
Price recently.
In transmitting the report of the Postmaster
General, the following reference is made to
the indictments against persons formerly
connected with the postal service: "I have
enjoined upon the officials who are charged
with the conduct of the cases on the part of
the government, and upon the eminent coun
sel who, before my accession to the Presi
dency, were called to their assistance, the
duty of prosecuting with the utmost rigor of
the law all persons who may be found
chargeable with frauds upou the postal ser
vice."
The message recommends the modification
of tl.e system of courts of the United States,
on account of tho increase of population and
consequent increase of court business.
The situation iu Utah is fully discussed,
and the necessity of wiping out the beastly
iuiquity in that country urged. It is recom
mendsd that the law be modified so that a
wife may be a competent witness against her
husband, aud that a certificate of the solemn
ization of all marriages in the Territories be
required to be filed with the Clerk of the Su
preme Court.
'llie necessity of education, though not
contemplated under tbe system of the gener
al government, is dwelt upon, aud a recom
mendation made that whatever fund may be
dedicated to this purpose be distributed ac
cording to the ratio of illiteracy.
The message throws in a few lines upon the
subject of agriculture.
The President seems to be aware of crook
edness in tbe Pension office, from tho fact
that $235,000,000 Is the amount wslimated to
be required for pensions, and says: "The
great temptation to the preseutation of ficti
tious cla.uis is afforded by the fact that the
average sum obtained upou such application
is $13, leads me to suggest the propriety of
making some special appropriation for the
prevention of fraud."
The President Uevotos a large space in his
message to tho discussion of civil service re
form, ou the basis enunciated by him in his
letter of acceptance. The qualifications of a
good officer aie set down as probity, industry,
good sense, good habits, good temper, pa
tience, toil, courtesy, tact,, self-reliance, man
ly deference to superior officets, ami manly
consideration for inferiors. A wide knowl
edge of books or prosapfitude in answeriug
questions at a competitive examination do
nut bring out these qualities. The message
re « ommeuds the. adoption of the English sys
tem, the main.feature of which is to induce
the educated young men ef tlie country to de
vote tiieir lives to public employment, by an
assurance that having once entered upon it
they need never leave it, aud that after vol
untary retirement they shall be the recipients
of au annual pension. The message recom
mends a tenure of oliica, which is substanti
ally a life tenure; a limitation of the maxi
mum ag" which an applicant can enter the
service, whereby all men in middle life or
over, witli some exceptions, are rigorously
excluded; a retiring allowance upou going out
of »llice. The views of the President upon
tliis subject are decidedly aristocratic, and
wiil not meet with favor with the American
people until their ideas shall have become so
revolutioniz'd that they are ready to accept a
monarcliial form of government.
The message calls attention to the question
that engrossed alleu* ion during the illness of
(he late President in regard to the construc
tion to he placed upon the constitu
tional term "inability," and at what
exigency tha Vice President shall succeed to
office, and suggests that the subject receive
tLe thoughtful consideration of Congress.
Taken as a whole, the message is a fair in
dex - f the established character of its author,
it is full of matter for the consideration of
Congress, but contains but little of suggestion
or an expression of the views of the President
up n the topics suggested. The little of sug
gestions that does appear stamps the President
as one to be relied on by the va»t moneyed
and corporate interests of the country. If it
had been prepared iu Wall street tiie messag#
could not have takeu stronger grounds in be
half ■ f these inte ests. The message itself
shows a remarkable and intimate knowledge
of the affairs of the government. It has much
tht ring of »routine paper from a subordinate
iu one of the Departments. There is nothing
in the document beyond tlie capacity of a
Department clerk. It speaks of matters re
quiring legislation In a sort of perfunctory
manner, leaving in most cas*s tlie maimer in
wiiich such legislation is to lie effected a sub
ject for future consideration, fcjo far as the
Présidant has permitted his views to appear
he is a mouometalist, a protectionist, and an
aristocrat iu his ideas of government.
The prophesied pestilence from planetary
conjunctions may be thought to be showing
some signs of fulfillment on account oi tlie
prevalence of small pox throughout the
country at the present time. A Chicago dis
patch of the 5tli says: A dispatch from St.
Louis says T. W. Hatch, said to be Secretary
of the California Board of Health, writes to
tlie St. Louis health commissioner, that the
State has quarantined against Chicago and
tLat trains on the Central Pacific Railroad
nave introduced small pex in five counties
along the line in California, ami in every case
the disease has been traced to Chicago ar
rivals. Iu St. Louis there is a great deal of
small pox, tweuty-six cases being repotted
from quarantine. In relation t# this dipatch
the Chicago authorities say they have no of
ficial information of the fact, and are in
clined to doubt it. They say, however, that
if San Francisco quarantines against Chicago,
then they will quaraatine against New York
out of necessity. The small pox is Indeed
very prevalent here, and has broken out in
many first-class lecalities of late. Two thous
and people were vaccinated at the Health of.
five to-day, and they were forty-nine deaths
from the horrible disease last week. A small
pox epidemic is feared and there is a genuine
scare.
