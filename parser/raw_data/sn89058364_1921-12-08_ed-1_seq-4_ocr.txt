love 1 him, I
love Mm," Ac
nes Allen said.
And as she
was alone in
her room, and
as no one could
hear her,
naturally there
was no answer
to her state
ment which she had repeated several
times.
She was speaking of George Far-
well George was so good looking
with his wonderful blue eyes, Na
brown hair, his fine erect figure.
Wherever she saw men the" thought
how Insignificant they looked beside
George. She was
glad that sift
thought that
way. She. hoped
others thought
that way about
the men they
cared for. Then
everything would
be so smooth and
so simple.
She wanted
everyone to like
her George Im
mensely. But It
would be embar
rassing If every
one thought just
the same about
him as she did.
The wedding
was to be Christ
mas afternoon. Then they had
planned to go to their own new little
home w;hidi they had just . finished
furnishing and firing up. They were
going to have their own little Christ
mas tree there quite by themselves,
and their friends had left their wed-,
ding presents and their Christmas
presents there, though almost all of
the former they had seen, of course.1
"Are you almost ready?" It was
Mrs. Allen cnlllng up the stairs. j
"Almost, mother dear," she an
swered. i
"TouH be late," her mother called.
"I'll hurry," she said. . . j
"Do you want any help?" !
But she had taken longer than she
had thought. Yes, If she didn't hurry
she would be late! Still she would
have George all her life now. How
wonderful It would be! She wondered
If that was why brides were so often
late because they felt they had so
mucU time I
It was a gloriously happy thought
to realize how much time she had.
She was only ten minutes late. The
few friends were at the Christmas
day wedding. And her bouquet was of
hoily and mistletoe. She had always
said she would love to have such a
wedding bouquet. It would be so
merry and Chrlstmasy and such a
happy, gay kind of a bouquet.
George had consented of course. H
agreed to everything she said, be
cause he loved her so, and she was so
fair with him, too, because she loved
lilio so!
The ceremony was over. They
drove away In a low sleigh with
Jingling bells to the ' small house.
There, by theniseh'es, they opened
presents. V'hnt a glorious time they
had. ;
And she had a little surprise for
him. 'Just a little bit of a surprise.
But she knew he would like it.
"Open that box, there, George," she
said.
He opened It.
And looked at some collars, many,
many collars, all much too big for
him.
. "When I was buying my wedding
clothes In town that time, George,
I remembered
that you'd spoken)
of a wonderful
kind of collar you
liked. I remem
bered the name
oo. I was t
little puzzled
when the man
asked rae your
size. I told him
though that as
long as he had
the right kind
the size didn't
make any differ
ence. When he
asked me if you
were big or small
I told : him yon
were big, of
course I
- - "Why, George,
what U the matter? Won't they fit
yon? Is the size so Important r
"My darling little girl," he laughed,
"what does It matter what the size
Is. That, Is It does matter about
wearing them I'm afraid, my love. But
to think you thought of me even
when yoii were getting the wedding
fineries rind remembered the name of
the collak -
"They're my' Christmas collars, he
exclaimed, "and HI put them away
In the box with the Christmas bouquet
we're going to sate. Such a Clirlst
mas gift from a dear little bride
should never be mangled by any
laundry!" '
"Whit a silly I am," she laughed
gaily, f
"Buj such an , adorable silly.

ITIiOBiST HOSPITAL

FACTS ABOUT CORN
of
TRUSTEES AGREE TO SELL THE
INSTITUTION AT COST
New Methodist Hospital Offered to
Veterans Bureau For Treatment
of Dis fried Soldiers Figures of
Cost Being Compiled For Submis
sion To Officials Church Willing
To Surrender To Soldiers.
The board of trustees of the Meth
odist Hospital in Memphis at a meet
ing Friday agreed to sell the hospital
to the government at the price rep
resenting tne actual cost of the dtod
erty. Agreement to sell the institu
tion was expressed in a resolution
setting forth the considerations of
the proposed sale and the anxiety of
the church to co-operate with the
government in the rehabilitation of
the men who served in the war The
resolution was adopted by Unani
mous vote, 19 of the 24 members be
ing present.
Leslie . M. Stratton, treasurer, of
the board. , was selected as the of
ficial representative of the hospital
trustees at the conference to be held
in Washington today, 'when, it is be
lieved, the question of the purchase
of the institution by the veterans'
bureau will be settled. Mr. Stratton
will go to Washington clothed with
sower to sell the hospital on the
basis of the cost price, as agreed
upon at the meeting of the trustees.
The exact cost of the hospital will
be ascertained by Mr. Stratton and
the Eev. L. H. Estes. secretary of
the institution.
The resolution adopted bv the
board makes it clear that the agree
ment to sell the institution has re
suited entirely from the desire of the
church to do the right thing by the
disabled soldiers and sailors of this
territory. There is no other consid
eration, according to the board, and
under no circumstances would the
hospital be sold or its sale even con
sidered except in case of great public
need, such as is evidenced at present.
ihe ilrst proposal ot the erovern
ment to buy the property came some
weeks ago from Col. R. U. Patterson,
medical adviser of the veterans' bu
reau, following his visit to Memphis
with Col. C. R. Forbess. director of
the bureau, on November 11. Col.
Patterson then recommended pur
chase of the Methodist hospital prop
erty. .
The proposition to buy the hospital
was not made direct to the board, it
is said, and it is not believed to be
the final offer of the covernment.
At least, the trustees do not consider
it as such, and on several occasions
Mr. Stratton has stated emphatically
that the Methodists will accept no
price that is below the actual cost of
the institution.
In anticipation of the approaching
meeting in Washington. local busi
ness men, members and officials of
the American Legion and others in
terested in the project are sitting
tight in the boat, watchine: each de
velopment with interest. These peo
ple have not played their last card
in the effort to secure adequate hos
pitalization" of the ex-service men of
this territory, and if the present deal
falls through, they declare they will
g"o ahead with the fight and try to
ipersuade the veterans' bureau to
erect a new institution, or make ex
tensive repairs and additions to the
old marine hospital.
However, it was learned that the
transfer of the Methodist institution
to the government was regarded as
practically certain.
HARDING WILL DROP
AMERICAN VALUATION
bsLJ
President Harding's message to the
new Congress next week, it was de
clared in high official circles, will
deal principally with two subjects
the tariff and the merchant marine.
Of the tariff, Mr. Harding is ex
pected by those close, to the White
House to say that its revision and
passage at the earliest possible date
is urgently necessary.
Concerning merchant marine ques
tions, Mr. Harding is expected to take
a definite stand for the granting- of
some sort of ship subsidy, probably in
the nature of preferential rates and
routes, as supplementary to granting
of free tolls to coastwise shipping
through the Panama canal. It was
expected also in the same quarters
that the "president would discuss sec
tion 24 of the Jones act, dealing with
the abrogation of trade treaties by
the executive. Study of the situ
ation was said to have developed a
feeling on the part of the administra
tion officials that it would be diffi
cult, if not impossible, to carry out
the provisions of this section. ,
Tariff amendments, leaders in
sisted, will occupy the important 'po
sition in the message. It was as
serted that the president would ask
that rates in the House bill, now in
the hands of the Senate finance com
mittee, be fixed on the old basis of
invoice varues rather than on the
House provision of American whole
sale valuation.
Mr. Harding went into details of
the legislative program for the next
session at a dinner attended by Sen
ators Lodge, of Massachusetts, Re
publican leader: Curtis, of Kansas;
Penrose, of Pennsylvania, and Wat
son, of Indiana. It was understood
that the president requested and the
Senate leaders agreed that the allied
debt refunding bill should be taken
up immediately and rushed through
to passage. -
As a result of the agreement reach
ed at a late hour, Mr. Harding: was
expected to omit reference to the
funding measure in his message. It
was stated, however, that the presi
dent had personally requested all
senators with whom he had confer
red in the last few days to lend their
assistance in having the bill enacted
into law. - '

(By T. F. Peck. Commissioner
Agriculture.)
For the past six wetks the Depart
ment of Agricultuie ;nas received
hundreds of letters from students in
the grammar and high schools of the
state asking about corn. Presuming
that all read their home parer, we
have prepared the following facts
about corn and giving to the papers
for p'ubication:
The greatest food nlant in the
world is that known as American
Indian corn. In production volume
it is exceeded by only one food article
potatoes.
Over 90 per cent, of all the corn
grown in the worhl,is erown in the
United States, the production each
year now averaging over 3,000,000,
000 bushels. The forecast for the
production of corn this year in the
United States is 3,200,000,000 bush-,
vis. aw production in ivzv was
nearly 3.400.000.000 bushe s.
Tennessee contributed to the pro
duction of corn last year about 93,
000,000 bushels, and the estimate of
the production this year is neary as
much. The United States Depart
ment of Agriculture forecasts fix the
quantity this year at about 90,000,-
yuu.busneis.
At one time in the history of the
United States, .Tennessee was the
leading state in the production of
corn. In 1840, according to the
United States Census Bureau, this
state produced more corn than any
state in the Union.
Afteh 1840 the growth and settle
ment of the states of the Middle
West Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, fMis
souri. Kansas, Nebraska and others
was so rapid that this state was
outstripped as a corn-producing
state, but its contribution now is no
insignificant amount.
According to the Bureau of Cron
Estimates of the United States De
partment of AgrWulfture. the pro
duction of corn bv the 12 leading corn
states last year 1920 was as follows:
Iowa, 473300,000 bushels: Illinois.
294,168,000; Nebraska, 255,528,000;
Missouri, 198,880,000; Indiana, 184,
072,000; Texas, 17430,000; Ohio,
162,099,000; Kansas, 137,535,000
Minnesota, 118,125,000": South Da
kota, 105,600,000; Kentucky ,100,
650,000; Tennessee. 93,100,000.
It will be seen that last year. Ten
nessee ranked tweltft in the pro
duction of corn.
Practically all the corn prdduced in
the United States is consumed in this
country, the most of it being fed to
livestock. Less than 10 per cent, of
the crop is exported.
Other countries produciner corn in
the order of volume of production
are: Austria-Hungary, Argentina,
Rumania, Mexico, Italy, Egypt and
Russia. '
It is (renerally agreed by students
of the question that corn as a plant
is of American origin. When Colum
bus discovered America in 1492,
maize was in common cultivation, it
was at once introduced into other
parts of the world, reachin? Europe,
Africa, China and Asia Minor early
in the sixteenth century. I
