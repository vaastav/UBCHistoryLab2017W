f.U" Vears have demonstrated that this is not
only an expensive charge upon the government,
but a dangerous menace to the ntonal

it is true that a greater uart of this is usd to
upply deficient revenues, considerable por
tion was required to ma.ntuln the gold reserve.
if no further legislation is to be had. to correct
mis mid the policy of selling bonis is to be
cmUillu; d. ttien congress should give the sec
retary ot the treasury authority to sell bonds
ut long or short periods, bearing, a less rale of
interest than is now authorized by law. The
president says:
Ki-cuin men ilat Ions.
"I earnestly recommend as soon as the receint s
of the government are quite sufficient to pay a.l
me expenses or tne government, that when any
culled States n jt-s are presented for redemn-
lou in goid aud are redeemed in gold, suci
notes shall be kept and set apart and only paiu
ut in e change for gout. This is an
obvious duty. If the holder of the
United States note prefers the gold
md gets it from the government
ne shouid not receive back from the govern
ment a United States note without paying gold
n exenange ior it.
That amounts, to the president's mind, to giv
ng an interest tearing debt, a government
boud. for a non-interest bearing detit. a United
.-states note. Tue government should ba re-
ieved from the burden of prjvidin all the
roid required for exchanges aud exports. This
ought to be stopped. With an era of prosper. ty
nut sumcient receipts we mav fel no immediate
mbarrassim-iH. but the danger vvia bo ever
present.
ihe president invites careful consideration
for the detail plan of the secretary of the treas
ury to protect the fold reserve. He concurs
with him in the recommendation that national
anks be allowed to issue notes fo the fact
aiueof their bonds deposited: that their em
ulation tax be reduced to one-half of one Pel
ent., and national banks mav be established
with a capital of -r.'.i.o hi. He also re-.'onimends
hat tae issue ot national bank notes be re-
tricted to the denomination of ten dollars aiu
upwards und that they be required to redeen
heir notes in gold.
The Cuban Qnextion.
Turning to foreign affairs, the president de
otes much space m his m -ssa re to a consider
ationoi tue t'u an question, which he says, is
the most imxxtnunt problem with which om
government is now called upon to deal in its
foreign relations. Summarizing lha hist iry ot
foriuer outbr. a ;s, the president comes down to
the present insurrection, sjieaking of its re
markable increase, its t nacious existence
a.'aiust enormous for.-es massed by Spain th
widespread destruction of property and the
disiegard 01 th'; civilized cHie oi
war on both sides, lie says these conditions
give rise to gravest a pprehensions. There is
no desire on our part to profit by Spain's mis
fortunes, and we have only the desire to see
Cubans enjoying that measure of self-cjntrol.
.vuicn is the inalienable right of man. of lh -concentration
policy of Weyler he says: "ll
has utterly failed as a war measure. It is not
civilized warfare it is extermination."
Our tioveriimeiit's Protest.
Against this nbuso or the rights of war, the
pre ldent says, h'j has felt constrained, on re
peated occasions, to enter the firm and honest
protest of this government. He outlines his
instructions to Minister Woodford, whictj were
in substance to impress upon the Spanish gov
ernment the sincere wish of the United States
to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by
reaching a pcuc- fill and lasting result, just ani.
honorable to Spain and to ihe Cuban p.'op.e
it was also asked whether Spain of her own
volition should not make proposals for settle
ment and it was said that we could not contem
plate an indctinito period for the accomplish
ment of this result.
The Spapiah Reply.
The Spanish reply to Mr. W'oodford, was. in
the president's opinion, in the direction of n
better understanding, it admitted our friendly
purposes and deep interest, and declared thai
ihe new government was bound to change oi
policy that should satisfy the United States aim
pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this
. nd political reforms will be put into effect auu
military operations conducted on humane
a lies. It was suggested that Spain be
:cft free to conduct military operation
cud grant political reforms while- the
United States for its part should enforce neu
tral obligation i and cut off the assistants
which the insurgents, it as asserted, reeciveu
from this country. Karly and complete pacifi
cation is hoped for.
The president declares that the Spanish dis
position to charge us with failure to meet in
ternational duties is baseless, ani points ti
the etforts this government have mudo at the
cost of millions, and by the employment of the
.idministrative machinery of the nation to per
lorin its uuty well. He also says that the fact
tiiat no military expedition or armed vessei
has left our shores has been diplomatically
represented with Spain. Promising that
throughout all the horror and danger to our
peace, the United States has never abrogateu
.is right to detenmn-j its policy as to Cuba, tn
president points cut that, of untried measures,
.here remains only : Recognition of the insur
gents as belligerents, recognition of the indc
liendence of C tiba. neutral intervention to enu
the war by imposing a rational compromise l-e-tween
the contestants, as intervention in fav r
of one or the other party.
No Forcible Annexation.
He says: "I speak not of forcible annexa
iion, for that can not be thought of. That by
-w code of morality would b criminal aggres
sion. Taking up the question of belligerency,
ihe president quotes at length from President
Grant's message of December 7, IzTh, wherein
ao declared that the c(.nJii ion in Cuba war
anted neither the recognition of independence
.ior the reco.'nition of belligerency. He adds
.nai. moreover a recognition of bellig
erency would confer upon neither
.jarty to conflict a status not theretofore act
ually possessed while it would weigh heavily
m Spain's behalf, giving her the right to searcii
on the hi h seas and extending her maritime
rights to the margin of our territorial waters.
For these reasons," says the president, "
regard the recognition of the belligerency of
the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and there
fore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter
iH'det nwd wise, as a matter of right and dutv.
the executive will take it."
llopclui Ciiaiijr Spanish Policy.
He points to the hopeful change in the Span
ish policy to the pledge of reform and to the
abatement of the horrors of war as reasons
against intervention on humanitarian grounds.
The firsl acts of the new government lie in the
honorable paths it has outlined; the policy of
r..p.ne and extermination has been reversed
:ind broadciemen.:ies proffered: measures have.
been taken to relieve the horrors of starvatio n
The Dower of theSpan.sli armies, it is as
serted, is to be used not to spread ruin and des
olation, but to protect the resumption of agri
cultural industries. The president, sketches
the autonomy scheme of the Spanish govern
ment, and says that it is honestly due to Spain
that she should be given a reasonale chance to
realize her expectations, and to prove the as
serted etliciacy of the new order of things to
which she stands irrevocably committed. He
points to the many concessions already made,
to the modifications of the horrible order of
concentration, to the release or tee "com
petitor" prisoners, and the fact that not a
single American citizen is now under
arrest in Cuba. He savs the near future will
demonstrate whether a righteous peace is likely
to be attained, if not. the exigency or further
and other action by the United States will re
main to be taken. Sure of the right, the gov
ernment will continue its watchful cares over
every American citizen and its efforts
to bring about honorable peace ana.
ivs the President: "If it shall nere-
after appear to be a duty imposea
bv our obligations to ourselves, to civilization
and humanity to intervene with force, it shall
lc without fault on our part, and only because
the nece.-sity for such action will be so clear as
-- Tr.--.nd the support ana approval 01 xn
He S3 vs that the disDUte between Jannii and
Hawaii over the Immigration question is now
in a satisfactory stage of settlement by negotia
tions; that our government has not intervened,
and that it is learned that Japan is now con
fident in the intention of this government to
deal with all possible ulterior questions affect
Ine her interests in the broadest spirit of
friendliness.
tvnlinl ArUt-ritan Cora plenties.
Reference Is made to the failure of Mr: Mer
ry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on
account ef the ofligiutulis Of that country to
tao tiF?l tit the Oreater Republic of Central
Ame ica. As there is no legal authority at
present to accredit him td the diet; Mn Baker,
the present minister !tt, Managua; has be di

(Jodfrey Hunter Is satd to, be. JikcHvise1 . accred
ited to Honduras, a member of the Greater Re
public, and his case is awaiting action.
The Nicaragua Canal.
The Nicaragua canal is spoken of as of large
importance to our country, and the promise is
made of further reference "to the subject, which,
in the report of the commission now at work,
is sent to congress.
International lli-Metaliism.
The president says of the ihternatiorial rrion
etary commission thati notwithstanding dil
igent effort; the eriroys nave failed
srt far to secure an agreement. 3 Ratifica
tion is expressed at the action 3f France
in this matter in joining in our effects; and it is
said that the negotiations are still pending!
Meanwhile the envoys hare not made their
final 'eperts. believing that the doubts raised in
certain quarters respecting the feasibility of
maintaining parity between gold and silver may
yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes
that their labors may bring about an interna
tional agreement.
Reciprocity Negotiations.
Mf Kass -ii, of Iowa, is said td be no cdiJ
ducting negotiations with several trovernffients
for reciprocity arrangements- Under the tariff
act. and if is believed that by a careful exercise
of the powers conferred by the act, some griev
ances of our own and other countries in our
mutual trade relations may be removed or alle
viated and me volume of our commercial ex
changes enlarged.
The president earnestly urge's the: inipro6
nleilt of otir merchant niarine, the inferiority of
which, he says, is humiliating to the national
pride.
Protection of Seal Life.
Reference is made to the recent conferences
at Washington on the subject of the protection
of seal life, the results or which place beyorid
codlfdversy. it is said, of the duty of the "gov-;
ernments concerned to adopt measures without
delay for the preservation of the herds. Nego
tiations to this end are now in progress.
International Arbitration.
International arbitration is declared by the
president to represent the beat sentiment ot the
civilized world and treaties enlbodyitifj thesa
uuniune principles on broad lines, without in
any way imperilling our interests or honor, will
nave lis Gjiisiani encouragement.
J lie l' Is Expos. t ion
A liberal appropriation is bespoken in order
iiatuie united states may make a creditable
xhiblt at the approaching Paris exposition, in
vhich the people have shown an unprecedented
interest.
The Navy.
Under the head of the navy, the president
points 10 me necessity ior speedy legislation
to procure the armor for the three battleships
now uuuumg. wnicn would be otherwise use
iess, lie speaks in terms of praise of the dual
ity of our ships, and thinks that the time has
now arrived when the increase to which the
country is committed should for a time take
the form of increased facilities commensurate
witn tne increase or our naval vessels
Lack of Puck i'acil.tieg.
He refers to the lack of docks, and urges that
three or four of the largest docks be provided
on the Atlantic, at least one on the Pacific
caast, and a floating dock in the gulf. There
saould also be ample provision for munitions
of war and an increase of officers aud enlisted
men. Additions are -also necessary to navy
yards, and as there are now on the stocks five
.arge battleships it is recommended that an
appropriation be made but for one more battle
nip on the Pacific coast. Several torpedo
ooais are also necessary.
la-i;ilHlion Needed for Alaska.
Attention is called to the need for prompt
-cgislation as to Alaska and the extension of
civil authority within the territory. There is
n ,ed for surveys and for the establishment of
another land office at some point in the Yukon
valley, for which an appropriation is asked,
Military rorce is also necessary and the estab
lishment of some sort of llexible government.
If the startling reports as to the probable
shortage of food for the miners be fully veri
tieJ. every effort should be made at any cost to
carry mem reaer. ,
Affairs in the Indian Territory,
The message deals at some length with the
unsatisfactory condition of affairs in the Indian
territory. The large w hite element is said to be
A ithout protection and without schools or oth
cr rights of citizens; leading Indians have ab
sorbed great tracts of lands and created an
aristocracy, and the friends of the Indians be
lieve that the best interests of the five civilized
.ribes would be found in American citizenship.
Failure of the Dan es Commission
Reference Is made to the failure so far or tho
Dawes commission to secure the consent of the
u ibes to an extinguishment of the tribal titlee
iind a division of the lands. It is said that
should the tribes still fail to ratify the agree
ment that some legislation should be had by
congress.
The Quarantine Laws.
The president approves the recommendation
of the secretary of the treasury for an exten
sion of the quarantine laws, and also suggests
the appointm jnt or a special commission to as
certain the cau e of yellow fever.
The Khiihhh 1'acitie Railroad.
Speaking of the pundin-r sale of the Kansas
Pacific railroad, it is said, that if no better
oidder is received than the upset price flxed by
:he court, the government would receive only
.-J.fiOO.ooJ on its claim of nearly 13.0 0.00(1. Ho
oelieves that the government has the authority
io bid on tue road, and nas directed tne secre
tary of tho treasury to make the deposit of
:.W0.0 u r Hire I to qualify as a bidder, and to
id at the sale a sum at least equal to the prin
cipal of tne aeut to in3 government.
Congress Sliould Legislate in the Case.
He suggests, however, that in a matter so im
portant as the government becoming a possible
wncr ol tne railroad, congress should enact
some legislation to define its views. It is clear
o him. however, that the government should
not permit ihe property to be sold at a price
ess than one half the principal of its debt and
' '-fifth of its entire debt, principal
and interest
The Civil Servicf.
i he president devotes the last chapter of his
message to . h i civil service, the practicd im
provement of which, he says, has long been a
-ubject of earnest discussion, and which has of
.ale years received increase! legislative and ex
ecutive approval. During the past few months
the service has been placed upon a still
firmer baiis of business methods
and personal merit. While. the
right " of deserving veteran soldiers
lo reinstatement has been asserted, dismissals
for merely political reasons have been carefully
ruarded against; the examinations improved
and made practical, and a distinct advance
nas been made by living a hearing before dis
missal upon all cases where incompetency is
cliarged or demand mode for the removal of
officials. This last has bsen done with
out impairing the power of re
moval, one of the vital safeguards
of the system. Much remains to be done be
fore the system can be perfected, and the pres
ident says that he shall not hesitate to exempt
cases which he thinks have been improperly
included in the classified service, or include
those which, in his judgment, will best promote
the public service. The system has the ap
proval of he people, and it will be his endeavor
to uphold and extend it.
Retrenchment Suggested.
In conclu ion. the president admonishes con
gress not to encourage the increase of the esti
mates for the maintenance of the government.
They would admit of decrease in many branches
and it is a commanding duty to keep the aopro
priations within the receipts of the govern
ment! and thus avoid a deficit.

THE WORM TURNS.
Suffering; Ilnninntty Will Not Always
Tamel r Submit to Affability.
Tdie affable nafesenffer bad been aearchina
for a victim for a long time. He bad made
exclamations wnen reacting nis paper, in xne
hopes that it ivoujd attract the attention
of some one and git' 6 nidi the opportunity
to show his power as a cohversatiotiaiisti but
all his little ruses failed. The people who
sat near him seemed to be wholly centered
on themselves, but still he was not com
pletely discouraged. He looked about him.
and, selecting one man to whom he thought
he might be able to impart much interesting
information, he began operations by re-
markiner:
Pardon me, but you look very much like
a man 1 know.
The man who was addressed looked over the
affable passenger gloomily, and, recognizing
the type, he replied, in tones that would
lause the thermometer to sink, even in the
Klondike:
"Yes. that is Dossiblv so: but at the same
Time you must excuse me, for vou look ex-
lctly like a man I don't want to know."

A striking confirmation of the truth of
the saying: "It is an ill-wind that blows
no one good" is found in the new routing
of the "Sunset Limited." Heretofore it has
started from New Orleans westward. This
season, on account of the prevalence of yel
low fever in some Darts of the south. Chica
go has been decided Upon as the terminus,
the route being over Chicago & Alton,
Chicago to St. Louis; St. Louis, Iron Moun
tain & Southern, St. Louis to lexarkana;
lexas & Pacific, lexarkana to H.1 Paso;
Southern Pacihc Company, Ll Paso to Cali
fornia destination. The train runs twice a
week, leaving Chicago 1:30 p. m. every
Tuesday and Saturday, and St. Louis 10:20
p. m. same days. Eastbound the same
trains leave San Francisco 5:30 p. m. Mon
days and Thursdays, and Los Angeles 10:30
a.m. luesdays and t ridays.
"Sunset Limited" is a magnificent train,
completely vestibuled and running through
solid, comprising a library and smoking car
ior -gentlemen with barbershop and bath
room; a combination ladies' parlor and
compartment car, with well-stocked library,
and ladies maid in attendance; two of the
finest sleeping-cars, and a dining-car, in
which perfect meals are perfectly served.
The dining-car service is a la carte pay for
what you order and prices are reasonable.
A trip across the continent in this train
could not but be a delight at any time, but
during the winter months there will be spe
cial satisfaction in the certainty of a semi-;
tropical climate, picturesque and novel
scenery, fast time, and no snow blockades.
And best of all, no extra fare is charged for
transportation on "Sunset Limited,' only
the regular Pullman rates prevailing for
sleeping-car accommodations.

"No, John!"
The words were spoken gently, yet
firmly. Had I been older and more ex

and I was vain enough to think that

i entreated her to take back those
cruel words; but she would not listen.
I begged I implored, but she was in
exorable. Yet she was kind. She mere
ly told me that nothing I could say
would move her. It was for my own
gjod, she said, and some day I would
thank her for it.
Her calm, cool manner angered me,
and, forgetting the deference due the
fair sex, I threatened violence.
She looked at me reprovingly and
shook her head. She did not fear me
in the least. Torture beyond endurance
by grief and anger, I burst into un
manly tears.
At last she was aroused. Drawing
herself up to her full height, she said,
in angry tones: "No, Johu Henry, you
