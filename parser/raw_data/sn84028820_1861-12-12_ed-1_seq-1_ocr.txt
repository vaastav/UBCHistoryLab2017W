PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
feUow CWunu oftSm Baud and
ffout of RcprttattaUvt:
FOREIGN INTERVENTION.
In the midst of unprecedented political
troubles, we have cause of great gratitude
to God for universal good health, and most
abundant harvests. You would not be
surprised to learn that in' the peculiar exi
gencies of, the times, our intercourse with
foreign nations has been attended with
profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon
our own domestic affairs. A dislojsl por
tion of the American people, have, during
the whole year been engaged in an attempt
to divide and destroy the Union. A na
tion which endures factious domestic di
visions, is exposed to disrespect abroad,
and one parly or both, 4s sure sooner or la
ter, (o invoke foreign intervention. Na
lions thus tempted to interfere, are not al
ways able, to resist the counsels of seeming
'expedience and ungenerous ambition al
though measures adopted under such influ
ence, sseldom fail to be unfortunate, and
injurous to those adopting them. The
disloyal citizens of the United Slates who
have offered the ruin of our country in re
ward for the aid and comfort which they
have invoked abroad, have received less
patroDSge and encouragement than they
probably expected. If it were, just to sup
pose as the insurgents hare seemed to as'
same, that Foreign nations in this case,
disregarding all moral, social and treaty
obligations, would act solely and selfishly
for the mosl speedy restoration of com
merce, including specially the acquisition
of cotton, these nations appear as yet, not
lo have seen their way lo their object more
directly or clearly, through the destruction
than through the preservation of the Un
ion. If wo would dare to believe that
Foreign nations are actuated by no higher
principle than this, I am quite sure a sec
ond argument could be made to show them
that they could reach their aim more read
ily and easily by aiding to crush this re
bellion, than by giving encouragement to
the prinoipal lever relied on by it. The
exciting of Foreign nations to hostility
against us as already intimated, is the em
barrassment of commerce. These nations,
however, not improbably saw from the
first that it was the Union which made as
well our foreign as onr donmestic com
merce. Thev can scarcely fail to perceive that
the effort for disunion produces the existing
difficulty, and that one strong nation prom
ises more durable peace, and more exten
sive valuable and reliable csmmcrce than
can the sama nation broken into hostile
fragments. It is not my purpose to re
view our discussion with foreign States,
becausa. whatever might be their wishes or
dispositions, the integrity of our country
and the stability ot our uoverumem main
ly depend, not upon them, but upon the
loyalty, patriotism, virtue and .intelligence
of the American people. The correspond
ence itself, with the usual reservations, is
herewith submitted. 1 venture to nope u
will appear that we have practiced pru
dence and JioeraniT lowaras ioreign pow
ers, averting causes of irritation, and with
firmness maintaining oui own rights and
honor.
THE PUBLIC DEFENCES.
Since, however, it is spparent that here,
as in every otner oiaie, loreigu unugcro
... . . J;n?.t.! T
necessarily attend domestic aimcuuics, x
recommend that'adequate and ample meas
ures be adODted tor maintaining ice puu-
lic defences on every side, while under this
general recommendation provision for de
fending our coast line reaony occurs to me
mind. 1 also in tne tame connection, asa
the attention of Congress to our Great
Lakes and rivers. It is believed that some
fortifications and depots of arms and mu
nitions. with harbor and navigation lm-
rjrovements. at well selected points upon
r. ... . . .1
these, would oe oi great impormuco in iuo
National defence aud preservation. I ask
. I . I s-1 .
attention to tbe views oi tue secretary
of War, expressed in his report upon etbe
same subject.
RAILROAD RECOMMENDATIONS.
I deem it of importance thnt the' loyal
regions of East Tennessee and Western
North Carolina should be connected with
Kontucky and other faithful parts of the
Union bv railroad. I therefore recom-
& militarv measure, that Congress
provide for tne construction oi sucu
as rpeedily as possible. Kentucky will no
- - -
doubt co-operate, and tnrongn uer igia-
lature make tbe mosl judicious seiecuuu
of the line. The northern terminus must
connect with some existing railroad, and
bether the route shall be from iexington
orNicbolasville to Cumberland Gap, or
from Lebanon to the Tennessee line in
the direction of Knoxville, or some still
difierent line, can easily be determined.
Kentnckv and the General, (iovernmeni
eo-operating, the work cen be completed
in a very short time, and when done it will
be not only of vast present usefulness, but
also an available, permanent improvement
worth' its cost in all tbe future.
TREATIES NEGOTIATED.
Some treaties designed chiefly for
interests of commerce, and having so grave
Tjolitical imbortaBce. hare been negotiated
and will be Submitted to the Senate for
their consideration. Although we have
failed to induce -some of the commercial
powers to adopt aNlesirable melioration for
the riffor of maratime war, we hareAr re
moved all the obstacles from the way
this humane reform, except such as are
merely of temporary and accidental occur
rence.
THE PERTHSHIREâ€”CHINA.
to
I invite your attention to the correspond
AT1M hatween her Britanic Majesty's Min
ister accredited to this Government, and
the Secretary of State, relative to the de
tention of tbe BritisD. snip rennsuire,
June last, by the U. 8. steamer Massacnu
setts, for a sutraosed breach of the block
ade. As this detention was occasioned
an obvious misapprehension of tbe facts,
and as justice requires that we should com'
mit no belkerent act not founded inetnet
right, as sanctioned by Public Law, I' re
commend that an appropriation be made
satisfy the reasonable demands of
ewners of the vessel for her detention.
repeat the recommendation of my prede
cestor in his annual message to Congress
in decetnber last, in Tegard to the disposi
tion of the surplus which will probably re
main after satisfying the claims of Ameri
can citizens against China, pursuant to the
awards of the Commissioners under tbe
act of the 3d of March, 1859,, If however
it should not be deemed advisable to car
ry that recommendation into effect, I would
suggest that authority be given for invest
ing tbe principal, over the surplus referred
to, in' good securities, with a view to the
satisfaction of such other just claim of onr
citizens against China as are not unlikely
to arise hereafter in tho course of our ex
tensive trad e with that empire.
PIRATES.
By the act of the 5th of Aug. last Con
jrress authorized the President to instruct
tne commanders oi suitaoie vessels, io de
fend themselves, and to capture pirates.
This authority has been exercised in a sin
gle instance only, r or the more enectnai
protection of our extensive and valuable
commerce, in the Eastern Seas, especially,
it seems to me that it would also be advi
sable to authorize tbe commanders of sail
ing vessels to recapture any prizes which
pirates may make of United Slates vessels
and their cargoes, and the Consular Courts,
established by law in Eastern countries, to
adjudicate tbe cases in the event that this
should not be objected to by the local authorities.
HAYTI AND LIBERIA.
If any good reason exists why we should
persevere longer in withholding our recog
nition of the Independence and Sovereign
ty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to
discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaug
urate a novel policy in regard to them
without the appointment of Congress, I
submit for your consideration the expedien
cy of an appropriation for maintaining a
Charge d Anairs near each of these Mntes.
It does not admit of a doubt that impor
tant commercial advantages might be se
cured by favorable.treaties with them.
OPERATIONS OF THE TREASURY.
The operations of the Treasury during
the neriod which has elapsed since your
adjournment, have been conducted with
signal success, xne patriotism ot tue peo
ple has placed at the disposal of the gov.
tbe large means demanded Dy tne puotic
exigencies. Much of the national loan has
been taken by citizens of tbe industrial
classes, whose confidence in their country's
r'll- .1 1 C It.!, .mi. t OT-'n iaKca-
ence from its present peril, have induced
them to contribute to the support of the
government the whole of their limited ac-
rr.L- i... r i:.

and energy in action.
Tbe revenue from all sources, including
loans for the financial year ending on the
30th of June, 1861, was $86,835,900,027,
and the expenditures for the same period,
including payments on account of the pub
lic debt, wore $84,578,034 34, leaving a
balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July
of $2,276,665 80 for the first quarter of
the financial year, ending bep. 30th, lBbi.
The receipts from all sources, including
the balance from July first, were$162,532,

maining three quarters of the year, and for

ing the demands contemplated by them,

retory of the Treasury.
It is gratifying to know thai tne expen
ses made necsessary by the rebellion are
not beyond the resources of tbe loyal peo
ple, and to believe that the same patriot
ism which bas thus tar sustained tne gov
ernment, will continue to sustain it, until
peace and Uuion shall again bless tbe land.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
,
I resDectfullv refer to the report of tbe
Secretary of War, for information respect
ing the numericial strength of the army,
and for recommendation baving-in view an
increase of its efficiency and tbe well being
of the various branches of the service en
trusted to bis care. It is gratifying to
know that the patriotism of tbe people is
equal to the occasion ; and that the num
ber of troops tendered" greatly exceeds the
force which Congress authorized ma to
call into the field. I refer- with pleasure
to those portions of his report' which make
allusion to the creditable degree of dici-
pline already attained by our troops, and
to tbe excellent sanitary condition oi tue
entire army.

THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.

the
The renort of the Secretary of the Navy
presents in detail the operations of that
branch of the service, and the activity and
energy whic hhas characterized its admin
istration. and tbe result of measures to in
crease its efSdeney and vximtx. Such
nave been the additions by construction
and purchase, that it may almost be said
a navy has been created and brought into
service since our diuculues eoi
Besides blockading- our extensive coast,
squadrons larger than ever before assem
bled under our flag, have been pnlafloat
-and performed deeds which have increased
f . t.?iij9
our naval renown., i wouia invite sptxuu
attention to tbe recommendation of the
Secretary of the Navy for a more perfect
organization of the navy, by introducing
additional grades in the service.
xne present organization is ueiecuTo
and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions
submitted by the department will, it believ
ed if adopted, obviate tbe difficulties al
luded too promote harmony, and increase
the efficiency of the Navy.
SUPREME COURT.
There are three vacancies on tho Bench
of the supreme Court; two by the decease
of Justices Daniel and McLean, and one
by the resignation of Justice Campbell I
have so far forborne making nomniations
'. - r -I,
to nil these vacancies, for reasons i win
now sUte. Two of the outgoing jnoges
resided within the States now overrun by
revolt, so that if successors were appointed
in tbe same localities they could not serve
upon their circuits, and many of the
most competant men there probably would
not take tbe personal hazard of accepting
to servo even bere upon tbe supremo oencn.
I have been unwilling to throw all the
appointments northward thus disabling
myself from doing justice to the oouin on
tbe return of peace although 1 may remars
that to transfer to the North one which
has heretofore been in the South, would not
with reference to territory and population
be unjust.
During the long and brilliant judicial
career of Judge McLean, bis circuit grew
into an empire altogether too large for any
one judge lo give the Cdurts therein more
than a nominal attendance, rising in pop
ulation from 1,470,000 in 1831 to 6,151,-
405 in 1860. Besides this the country
has generally outgrown our present Judi
cial system. If uniformity was at all in
tended, tbe system require idh aw uie
States shall be accommodated witn circuit
Courts, attended by Supreme Judges while
in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas
Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon
have never bad any such Courts. Jor can
this be well remedied withont a change
of tho system, because the adding
of Justices to tbe Supreme Court enough
for the accommodation of all parts of the
country with Circuit Courts, would create
a court altogether too dangerous for a ju
dicial body of any sort, and the evil of it
bo one that will increase as new otates
come into the Union. Circuit Courts are
useful or they are not useful. If useful no
State should be denied them jh not ugeiui
no State should have them. Let tbem
beprovidaf for all 6Y sbTilfcdjB to alL
Three modifications occur to me here,
which I think would be an improvement
upon our present system. Lei tbe Su
preme Uourt De OI conveuieu uuiuuu
in every event. Then, first, let the whole
country be divided into Circuits of conve
nient size, tbe Supreme Judges to serve a
number of them corresponding to their
own number, and independent Circuit
Judges be provided for all the rest; or sec
ondly, the Supreme jnoges oe reueeu
from Circuit duties, and uircuu juuge
provided for all the circuits; or, thirdly,
dispense with Circuit Courts altogether
leaving the judicial functions wholly to
the District Courts and an inaepenueui
Supreme Court,
THE STATUTE LAWS.
T resnectfullv recommend to the con
sideration of Congress the present condi
tion of the statue laws, with the hope that
Concrress will be able to find easy rem
edy for the many inconveniences and evil
which constantly embairassthose.'engaged
in the practical administration oi tnera.
1 ... . t r
- Since tbe organization oi tue uovem
ment Congress has enacted some '5000
acts and ioint resolutions, which fill more
than 6000 closely printed pages, and are
scattered through many volumes, waoy
of these acts have been drawn in naste sou
without sufficient caution, so that their
provisions often obscure in tbomselves or
in conflict with each other, or at least so
duublful as to render it very difficult for
even the best informed persons to ascer
tain precisely what the statute law really is.
It seems to me very lmporioui mum mo
statnte law should be made as plain and
intelligible as possible, and be reduced to
as small a compass as may consist with
the fullness and precision of the will of .the
legislature and the perspicuity of its lan-ruao-e.
These well done would, I think,
greatly facillate the labors oMbose whose
duty it is to assist in the administration of
. - ... .... 1 c
the laws, and would oe a lasting oenent to
the pople by placing before them in a more
accessible and intelligible form the laws
which so deeply concern their interests and
their duties.
I am informed by some whose opinions
I resneet. that all the acta of Congress
now in force and a permanent general na
ture, might be revised and re-written so
to be embraced in one volume, or at lensi
two volumes of ordinary and convenient
size; and I respectfully recommend to
Congress to consider the subject, and if my
snrrgestion be approved, to devise such
plan as to their wisdom shall seem most

NORTHERN CLAIMS IN REBEL STATES.
One of the unfavorable consequenses
the present insurrection ,is tue entire sup
nreajiionln many places of all ordinary
means of administering civil justice by tbe
officers, nd in tbe forms of existing law.
This is the case in whole or in part in all
the insurgent States, and as -our armies
advance upon and take possession of parts
of those States, the practical evil becomes
more apparent. There arena fcjnrls
officers to whom tbe citixens of other States
mav annlv for the enforcement of their
lawful claims against citisens of the insur
gent Stales, and there is a vast amount
debt constituting suca claims.- some nave
estimated it as high as $100,000,000, due
in large part from insurgents in open rebel
linn to loval citizens, who are area bow
making great sacrifice in the discharge;
their patriotic duty to support us uovernment.
Under these circumstances I bare
been urgently solicited to establish, by
military power, courts to administer sum
mary justice in Buch cases. I bsve thus
far declined to do it, net beeause l bad any
doubt that the end proposed, the collection
of debt was just and right in' iteelf, bnl
because 1 bave been unwilling to go beyond
tbe pressure of necessity in tbe usual ex
ercise of power. bus lba powers of Con
gress, I suppose, are equal to the anoma
lous occasion ; and therefore, 1 refer tbe
whole matter to Congress, with the hope
that a plan-may be devised for the admin
istration of justice to all such parts of the
insurgent Slates and teiritories as may be
under control-of the Government, whether
by-a voluntary return to allegience and or
der or by the power of our arms. This,
however, is not to be a permanent institu
tion, but a temporary substitute, and to
cease as soon as tho ordinary courts can be
re-established in peace.
CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
It is important that some more conveni
ent means should be provided if possible
for the adjustment of claims against tbe
Government, especially in view of their
increased number by reason of the war.
It is as much tbe duty of tbe Government
to render prompt justice against itself in
favor of citizens as it is to administer the
same between private individuals. The
investigation and adjudication of all the
claims in their nature belong to tho Judi
cial department; besides it is apparent
that the attention of Congress will be more
than usually engaged for some time to
come with great national questions. It
was intended by tbe organization ot tne
Court of Claims mainly to remove this
branch of business from tbe halls of Con
gress; but while the Court has proved to
h offAotire and valuable means of inves
tigation, it in a great degree fails to effect
the object of its creation for want of power
to make its judgement final. Folly, aware
of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of
the subject, I commend lo your careful con
sideration whether this power of making
judgement final may not be properly given
to tne uourt reserving tne ngut oi appeal
on questions of law to the Supreme Court,
with such other provisions as experience
have shown to be necessary.
POSTMASTER GENERAL'S REPORT.
I ask attention to the report of the Postmas
ter General; the following being a summary
statement of the condition or the Department.
The revenue from all sources during the fiscal
year ending Jono 30th, 1861, including the an-
. a AnA AAA A
nual permanent appropnauen oi ior
the transportation of free mail matter, was $9,
049,296,40, being about 2 per cent, less than the
revenue of 1860.
The expenditures were 3,606,709 dollars and
11 cents, shoving a decrease of more than 8
per cent, as compared with those of the previous
year, nnd leaving an excess of expenditures
over the revenue for the last fiscal year of over
557162 dollars and 71 crnU. The gross reve
nue lor the year ending June 30th. 1863, is es
timated at an increase of 4 per cent, on that of
1861, making 8,683.000 dollars to which should
be added the enrnings of the Department for
carrying free matter, viz: 700,000 dollars, mak
ing 9,382.000 dollars. The total expenditures
for 1863 are estimated at 12,523,000 dollars,
leaving an estimated deficiency of 3534,000 dol
lars to De suppirea irom tne .treasury in auai
tion to the permanent appropriation.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The present insurrection shows,
tne extension oi tnis uismci across me i uiu
raac River at the time of establishing the Capi
tal here was eminently wise, nnd consequently
that the relinquishment of that portion of it
which lies in the State of Virginia was unwise
and dangerous.
I submit for your consideration the expedien
cy of regaining that' part of tbe District, and
the restoration of the orieinal .boundaries there
of, thro negotiations withjthe State ofj Virginia.

PATENT OFFICE. PENSION OFFICE.
The demands upon the Pension Office will be
largely increased fey the insurrection. Numer
ous applications for pensions, based upon the
casualties of the existing war, have already
been made. There is reason to believe that
many who are now upon the pension roll and
in receipt of the Bounty of the Government,
are in the ranks of ihe insurgent army, or giv
ing them aid and comfort. The Secretary of
the interior has directed tne suspension ot tne
payment of the pensions of such persons upon
proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that
Cin tms.i authorize that officer 4o cause the
names of such persons to bo stricken from tho
pension rolls.

THE SLAVE TRADE.
The SJtecotioo of the laws for thyrujrpreawoa
of the African Slave' Trade has been confiined
to the Department of the Interior. It is a sub-
i'ect of congratulation .that the efforts which
lave been made for the suppression of this in-
uuuiau iramc nave recently oeen attended trim
unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out
for the slave trade hare been seized and con
demned, two masters engaged in the trade, and
one person equippingthe vessel as a alaver.haTe
been convicted and subjected to the penalty of
fine and. imprisonment, and one captain taking
up a cargo of Africans oa board hi vessel, has
been convicted of the highest grade of offence
under our laws.- the punishment of which is

THE TERRITORIES.
created by tbe last Congress, have, been
organized, and civil administration has been in
augurated therein, under auspice especially
gratifying, when it is considered that, the leav
en of treason was found exbttingin soma of
these' new countries when the Federal officers
arrived there-
The abundant natural resources of these Ter
ritories, with the security and protection afford,
ed by organized Government, will doubtless
invite to them a large immigration when peace
shall restore the business of the country to its
accustomed channel. I submit the resolutions'
of the Legislature of Colorado, which evince the
patriotic spirit of the people of that territory.
So far the authority of the United States has
been upheld in all the Territories as it is hoped
it will be in the future, I commend their inter
eats and defence to the enlightened and gener
ous care of Congress. I recommend to the fa
vorable consideration of Congress, the interests
of the District of Columbia. The insurrection
has been the cause of much suffering and sacri
fice to the inhabitants, and as they hare no rep
resentative in Congress, that body should not
overlook their just claims upon the Government.

THE BLOCKADE.
In Ihe exercise of my best discretion I have
adhered to the blockade of tne ports neiu nj
the insurgents, instead of putting in force by
proclamation the law ol Congreia enacted at
the late session for closing those ports: also
obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the
obligations of law, instead of transcending, I
have adhered to the act of Congress to confis
cate property used forinsurrcctionary purposes.
If a hew law upon the same subject shall bi
proposed itsproposition shall be duly consider
ed. The Union must be preserved, and hence
all dispensable means must be employed.
We sbonld not be in haste to determine what
radical and extreme measures, which may reach
the loyal as well as the disloyal are indispensable.
CAUSES OF THE REBELLION.
The Inaugural Address nt the beginning
the Administration, ana I no message io oon
rrwnnt ihe late HDechtl Session were both main
ly devoted to the domestic controversy out of
which the insurrection and consequent war
have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or
substract to or from tbe principles or general
purposes stated and expressed in those docu
ments. The last ray of'hope for preserving the Un
ion peaceably, expired at tbe assault upon Fort
Sumter, and a general review f what baa oc
curred since may not.be unprofitable. What
was painfully uncertain then, is much better
defined and more distinct now. and the prog
ress of events is plainly in the. right oi"1,10"."-
The insurgents confidendy claimed a strong
support from north of Mason's and Dixon s line,
and the friends of the Union were not free rrom
apprehension on this point- This, however.

GEN. SCOTT.
Since your .last adjournment Lieut. Gen.
Scott ha retired from the head of the army.
During hi long life the nation has not
been unmindful of his merit, yet on calling to
mind how faithfully, ably and brilliantly, he
has served the country from a time far back ia
our history when few of the now living had
been bora ana ibencetorwara continually, a
cannot but think that we are still his debtor. I .
submit, therefore, for your consideration what
lurtber-raarE or recognition is due to mm ana
ourselves as a grateful people.
GEN. M'CLELLEN.
"With the retirement of Gen. Scott, came tie
executive duty of appointing in his stead a General-in-Chief
of the Army.
It is a fortunate circumstance that neither is
council nor country was there, so far as 1 know,
any difference of opinion as to the proper per
son to be selected. The retiring chief repeat
edly expressed his judgment in favor of Gener
al McClellan for the position, and in this' ths
nation seemed to give an nnanimous concur
rence. The designation of Gen. McClellan, iV
therefore, in a considerable degree the selection:
of the country as well as of the. Executive, and
hence there is better reason' to hope there wilr
be given him the confidence and condial support
thus, by fair implication,. promised, and with?
out which he cannot with so full efficiency serve
the country.
It has been said that one bad General is bet
ter than two good ones, and the saying is true
if taken to mean no more than that an array is'
better directed by a single mind, though infer
rior, than by two superior ones at variance and
cross purposes, and the same is true in all joint
operations wnereia tuose.engagea can nave none
but a common end in view, and can' differ only
as to the choice of means.
In a storm at sea none on board can wish the
ship to sink, aud yet not unfrequentlyJall go
down together, because too many will direct,
and no single mind can be allowed 16 control.
A WAB AQAIKST THE PEOPLE, LABOB UI) CAITTAI..

first principles ofpopular govern men t.the rights
of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is
found in the most grave and maturely consid

IS me GUUlce ui uu AfutibtU evil, iimjuih.u;
itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible re
fuge from the power of the people.
In mv present position. 1 could scarcely" be
justified were I to omit raising a warning voice
against this approach of returning despotism.
It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a general
argument should be made in favor of popular
institutions, uul were is uuo point wiw iuiwh:
nections. not so hackneyed as most others, to
which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort
to place capital on an equal footing with, ir not
above labor in the structure of Government. It
is assumed that labor is available only IB
connection with capital, that nobody labors un
less somebody elso owning capital, somenow
by the use of it, induces him to labor. This
assumed, it is next considered whether it is best
that capita shall hire laborers and thus in
duce them to work by their own consent. Or
buy them and drive them to it withont their
consent. Having proceeded so far, it is natur
ally concluded that all laborers are cither hired m
laborers or what we called slaves; and further
it is assumed that whoever is once a hired la
borer is fixed ia that condition (ot -life. Now
there is no such relation between capital and la
bor rs assumed. Nor i3 there any Saeh thing
, - y.. " . t a-ij:
as n Ireeman uemg nxeu ior me in toe cunui-
tion of a hired laborer. Both of these as
sumptions are false, and all inferences from'
tbera are groundless. Labor is prior to and in
dependent of capital. Capital is only tho fruit
of labor, and could never have existed if labor
had not first existed. Labor is the snperior of
capital, and deserves much the higher eonsid
ation. Capital has its rights which atfe as wor
thy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it
denied that there is, and probably always will
be, a relation between labor and capital pro
ducing mutual benefits. The error is in as
suming that tho whole labor of community ex
ists within that relation. A few men own cap
ital, and that few avoid labor and with their
capital hire or buy a few to labor for them.
A large majority belong to neither class, Bti;
ther work for others nor have others working
for them. 14 most of the Southern States a
majority of the whole people, of all colors, are
neither slaves nor masters, while in the North
ern a large majority arc neither hirers nor hired,
but men with their families, wives.-sons, and
daughters work for themselves on their farms,
in their houses, and in their shops, taking the
whole product to themselves, and asking no fa
vors of capital on the one hand nor of hired la
borers or slaves on the other. It is trot forgot
ten that a considerable number of persons min
gle their own labor with capital tfiat is they la
bor withtheir own hands, andalso bur or hire
others to labor for them; butthis is only a mix
ed and not a distinct class. No principle slated
is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.
Again; as has already been said, there is not
of necessity any suchthmgasthe freehiredlabcrJ
cr being fixed for that condition for life. Ma
ny independent men eve rwhere in these State,
a few years book ia their lives, were hired la
borers! .... ...
The prudent, penniless beggcr in the world
labors for wages awhile, and saxes a' surplus
with which to buy tools or land for himself,
and then labors' .on. his own account, and at
length hires another beginner to help him.
This is the just; and geneross, and prasnerous)
system, which opens the way to all, g'veshop
to all, and consequent energy, progresrfnwd fra
provemeat of tha condition of all. No rota
living are more worthy to be trusted than those
who toil up or on from poverty, none less, in
clined to take or touch ought which they have
not honestly earned. Let them beware of sur
rendering a political power which they already
possess and which if urrcndered, will surely
lTT.i tni-loss the door of advancement agaiBst
such as they, and to fix new disabilities and
burdens upon them -until all of liberty shall be
