Idaho, under the Act of Congress of
March 8, 1879.
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1907.
How many paragraphs or col
umns of the president's message
have you perused?
And now the storm center is at
Goldfield. A democratic governor
has called upon a republican presi
dent to send U. S. troops into the
camp to preserve order, and the
president has had them sent. Some
similarity to the Couerd'Alenecon
dition some years ago, only so^ far
the bull-pen has not been installed.
The first number of the Boise
Sunday Times is on our table full
of good reading on live home topics
and displaying a fine advertising
patronage. An excellent press ser
vice makes the Times a good daily
for one day in the week, but unlike
the Sunday issues of other dailies,
it is not padded with trash. We
wish the Times the success the
efforts of its enterprising publishers
merit.
Improvements at the Albion
Normal School.
The editor of this little sheet
had occasion to visit the Albion
State Normal School last week
and was pleased to note that
institution is in a more flourish
ing condition than it has been in
former years although it has
steadily progressed under its
present management. Its entire
faculty seems to be giving the
patrons and pupils of the school
entire satisfaction, and there is a
zeal and spirit in the school which
speaks strongly in its favor.
The completion of the second
floor of the new girls' dormitory
provides ample room for all the
young ladies attending and both
it and the boys' dormitory are
in fine condition and well man
aged.
By an agreement with the
trustees of the Albion Public
School District the trustees of
the Normal had a model school
built on its grounds and provides
teachers for the public school to
be paid with the revenue of the
district. By this arrangement '
the Normal has a good practice
school for its more advanced
pupils, and the towu basa better
public school than heretofore, !
without having to provide a new
building. This model school ^
building is a model for ueatuess
and convenience, to be electric
lighted and steam heated.
An
electric lighting plant for all the
school buildings and the two dor
| mitories is now being installed.
I The rapidly increasing popula
j tion now going on in the settle
ment of the southern portion of
the state, by reason of its great
reclamation enterprises, making
Albion the most desirable loca
tion for such a school, a reason
which could not be advanced for
locating it there when it w'as
established.
And speaking of the manner in
which this section of Idaho is
now being settled, the writer will
cite as an instance, that he stop
ped on his way home, at Rupert,
one of the towns under the Mini
This town, with
splendid farms all around it, was

Now it is a substantially built
place, with a postoffice of the

out parks, large stores and fine
business blocks and handsome
residences.
doka tract.
And Heyburn and
Burley, two other quite as pre
tentious towns, respectively three
and five miles distant, and of
about the same age. These are
all on the Minidoka Government
project, while below them are the
two, south and north side Twin
Falls Carey Act tracts, now the
wonders of the west.
New Officers For Boise U. S.
Land Office.
The nomination of Fred V.
Tinker to be receiver of public
money at the United States land
office at Boise was sent to the
senate Thursday', to succeed E.
E. Garrett, whose term expired a
little over a year ago.
The nomination of Tinker was
made last spring upon the recom
mendation of Senator Borah, but
was withdrawn upon the request
of Attorney General Bonaparte
who wished Garrett retained in
the office pending the trial of
Senator Borah on the charge of
timber frauds.
Tinker lives at Idaho City and
has been engaged in mining for
several years.
It is also reported that Addison
T. Smith, the present register in
that office, who has resigned to
resume his former position as
private secretary for Senator
Heyburn, will be succeeded by
William Balderson, editor of the
Statesman. These will both be
very acceptable appointments to
those having business with the
office. Both of thegentlemen go
ing out have proven themselves
very capable and efficient officers.

with subsidiary money, and yet our
nation sits by and sees nearly all
the product sold to foreign govern
ment, who at once coin it and pass
it out to their subjects at nearly a
hundred per cent advance on its
cost.
Suppose things were reversed.
Suppose Great Britain was a large
producer of silver and the United
States was forced to buy from her
the silver needed in the arts, for
subsidiary coinage and for the Phil
lipines, how long would she bb sell
ing it to us at half price?
Suppose our government should
tomorrow decide, that in as much
as gold was so rapidly falling in
value, it would be but fair to recog
nize silver at $1 per ounce? What
would be the effect? Day after to
morrow the cable would bring us
news that silver was worth $1 per
ounce all over the British isles, the
continent and Mexico, and day after
tomorrow the same news would
come from India, Japan, China and
Rio Jeneiro. And what would be
the effect? The Orient would need
no more gold, neither would South
America; the gold reserves would
be strengthened just that much.
Had such a law been passed two
years ago and accepted by the New
York bankers in 'good faith, there
would have been no panic.
When a man became timid and
went to draw out and lock up his
little or big deposit, and the bank
began to shovel out to him silver—
as they would in France—he would
have suddenly changed his mind.
Our trade with China greatly ex
ceeds in amount annually our sil
ver product. She would be glad to
take all that we can produce even
up to $100,000,000 per year. India
is a perpetual absorbant of silver
and always needs more than she
can get. The restoration of silver
would be everything for our orient
al trade; it would be a great pro
tection to our banks; if restored it
would be the money hoarded by the
poor even as it now is in France.
We believe too, that could Presi
dent Roosevelt be persuaded,
through our ambassadors and min
isters, to sound foreign government
on the proposition of remonitizing
silver that four out of five of the
replies would be favorable. We be
lieve, too, that had congress, four
teen years ago, instead of striking
down silver as basic money, decreed
that it should be received, the bars
piled away and silver certificates be
issued upon them, there would have
been no need of an elastic currency
now. And the difference to the
miners of the west would have been
quite $400,000,000 and it would
have helped the east vastly more
than the west.—Goodwin's Weekly.
