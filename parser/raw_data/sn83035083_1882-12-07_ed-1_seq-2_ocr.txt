A SHOCKING AFFAIR !
Frank i'rayne Miases tnc Apple,
and Snoots Miss Von Herclin
tl.ro oi; I. the Head, Killing;
Her Instantly.
Cincinnati, November 80th. This '
afternoon at the Coliseuhi Theater, in
the fourth act of the play, Si Slocum, i
Frank Frayne, in shooting an apple
off the head of Ruth Slocum, person
ated by Miss Annie Von Behren, miss
ed theapple and shot Miss Von Behren
in the head. She died in fifteen min
utes. Frayne was arrested immedi
ately. The curtain fell and the play
stoppen. The audience supposed the
victim was only slightly hurt. Frayne
used a rille of 82-eaithre, and execu
ting a backward shot. The catch snap
of the rifle was imperfect, nn I slipped
just as the hammer fell and blew the
cartridges out backwards.
Wheu the curtain went down, after
the fatal shot, excitement behind the
scenes was so great as to create alarm
lest a panic might ensue among the
audience of 2300.
Fray ue's cries and lamentations were
so violent that he was heard before the
curtain. Manager Fennessy was too
much excited to say anything, but he
sent a friend to the front to say that
the accident was slight, and that tlie
play would not proceed farther. The
audience then retired in order, though
one lidy fainted.
Manager Fennessy took charge f
Frayne, and though the latter de
manded to be locked up, he got Mr H.
Heuck to go betore Judge Higley, of
the Police Court, and give bond for Dis
release from arrest. The bond was
fixed at $5,000. Frayne's mental con
dition was such that one or two of his
friends kept a close watch over him at
his hotel. The theater closed tonight
and nrobablv will not be opened this
week.
A coroner viewed the body of Miss
Von Behren, and it was then removed
to the undertaker's, where it will lie
until word is received from her friends
in Brooklyn. It is said sbe was en
gaged to be married shortly to Frayne.
The cause of the accident was the low
ering of the barrel by a fault in the
spring catch. Frayne's shirt was
burned by the powder, and a part of
the shell was driven backward.
The ball entered the forehead two
Inches above the left eye and half an
inch to the left of the median line.
The apple on her head rested on a hat,
aud the bottom of the apple was four
inches above the girl's head, though
with the make up of her hair and hat
it appeared mucli nearer. The shot
was Frayne's usual back shot, using
the mirror. The place where the ball
struck the j'irl's forehead was in a
plumb line below the center of the
apple. The rille used was a 32-calibre
breech loader cartridge ritle, of the J.
Stevens pattern, Blade for Frank
Frayne, and used by him six years in
this act. He says the spring catch,
near the breech of the barrel which
holds it down, after loading broke or
failed, and that the stroke of the ham
mer on the cartridge threw the breech
up aud depressed the muzzle at the
moment of liriug so as to throw the
ball downward. About six years ago,
at Wood's Theater, iu the same piece,
with his wife, who has since died,
acting the part of " Ruth Slocum," he
shot one of the stage stipes in the foot.
The rifle was an old fashioned Ken
tucky gun, and the ball, before strik
ing the man's foot, passed through
the apple and a heavy butt of oak wood
placed behind it to stop it. He then
explained how careful he was in ex
amining his rifle on such occasions,
and how safe it was iu his bauds ; ami
how he used to employ a navy revolv
er aud shoot apples oil' several people's
head till the authorities forbade it. He
also explained that out of sight of the
audience the breech of his gun was
held tight to the proscenium jamb by
a clamp aud screw, which he carried
for that purpose. It appears that he
omitted this precaution of late. Pop
ular feeling here is sympathetic with
the man, but bitter against his busi
ness. Fraynesays he will never shoot
again.
Annie Von Behren was the leading
laiiy of the Company, and was less
than twenty-live years of age. Her
native place was Brooklyn, and she
had been on the stage about three
years. The Coliseum Theater is closed
tonight, of course.

St. Louis, December 4 An edito
rial letier in the Post-Dispatch from
Washington, written by Jos Pulitzer,
referring to the Star Route matters,
aud especially to Stephen VV. Dorsey,
gives some se'-ret history of the case,
obtained, the writer says, from per
fecily authoritative though confiden
tial sources. When it was first known
that Mr. McVeagh really meant, to
have Dor y indicted ind presented.
Dorsey came from bis sheep rauebe in
New Mexico . and went to the White
House. General Garfield told Dorsey
not to give himself any uneasiness
about the outcome, but to return to
his raiiehe and feel sure that he (Gar
field) would be his friend ; but iu spite
of all this McVeagh proceeded with
his ease. A retained detective and
special counsel collected testimony ami
drew, upon piomise of immunity, from
a smaller member of the ring, a con
fession of guilt which was sure to con
vict Dorsey. Alarmed by the reports
of McVeagh's doings, Dorsey returned
iu the Spring of 1881 to the l,ast.
While in New York Mr. McVeagh
ictu tliy procured a warrant (or Dor-
sfiy's arreet. The warrant v:is utiooi
lo he issued, but Horsey had his secret
agents everywhere, and bo beard ol
tne move by telegraph. He saw his
peril. There was only one man who
could save h;m. He took the next
train to Washington and arrived there
late at night. He went from the de
pot to the White House ami appealed
to Garfield to save him. Garfield then
sent for McVeagh. What there ensued
may be inferred from the fact thai ttie
warrant for Dorsey s arrest was never
served, but withdrawn. The incident
is historical, and known to be true by
Blaine. It lias never been published,
but it is true, and McVeagh will not
dare to deny it.
i mMM
THE North Side Rolling Mills, at
Chicago, have shut down for want of
work, throwing out of employment
1,800 to 2,000 men, The opinion gen
erally prevails that the talk about
shutting down in the iron and steel
works of the country is a scheme got
up for the purpose of causing a drop in
wages and the price of coal and pig
iron, and to frighten Congress into
continuing the present exorbitant du
ties, or to still further increase the bur
thens of the people. But whatever
may be the cause ol the scare, it is
ipiite manifest that the high tariff tax
which now prevails, and which there
is little or no prospect of being chang-
pl for a year or so, affords no " pro
tection" to the thousands of working
men who are tli row n out of employ
ment whenever there is a panic in the
country.
The richest man iu Mexico Is de
clared to be au Irishman named Patri
cio Milmo, whose possessions are val
ued at $10,000,000. He liveH on a high
tableland comprising about 100,000
acres, which is some 3,600 feet high,
the sides of it being rocks and parpen-!
dicular. His residence is a handsome
stonestructure furnished in royal fash-
to pay from $10,000 to $25,000 ransom.
Recently he caused the approaches to
this piece of tableland to be so altered
as to couvert the place into a sort of
citadel, accessible only by a narrow
path, which is obstructed by an iron
gate of enormous proportions.
N. Y. Herald, November lti.
SBAtll ON POUTEB.
It has been known for some time
past that General I r. S. Grant, having
studied the case of General Filz John
Porter, concluded that the charges
against General Porter were untenable.
In this the ex-President but followed
the findings of the Scbofield Board.
A sense of the long injustice under
which General Porter has suffered for
now a score of years has stimulated
General Grant to publish an article in
which he gives the grounds for his
present opinion. Of this article but
the main points can be given here.
Says General (Irani :
"General Porter's alleged miscon
duct was embraced in three separate
cases of disobedience of orders one on
the :27th of August and two on the
29tb of August - and in having retreat -edinue
.cssarily from the enemy, by
that endangering other portions of the
army With which be was co-operating.
It will be seen that though the offenses
were alleged to have beeu committed
in August of 1801!, he was continued in
command of an army corps until some
time in November following, taking an
active part in the battles of the day
following the date of the last charge,
and in command of the defenses of
Washington ou the west bank of the
Potomac, and also at the battle of Au
tietam, some weeks later. It would
look at first very singular that an offi
cer so wantonly derelict iu the per
formance of lfts duty as General Porter
was alleged to have been ou the 27th
and 29th of August, should have been
continued in so important a place of
command as an army corps, when so
much was at stake as there was on the
30th of August, aud in the defenses of
Washington, aud iu the later battles
in Maryland when the invasion of the
North was threatened. These facts
would indicate to au unprejudiced
mind that the charges against Porter
were au aftef-thought to shift the re
sponsibilities of failure from other
shoulders aud to place them upon him"
General Grant then reviews the facts
brought out iu the evidence before the
Scbofield Board with characteristic
directness aud cogency. In the course
of his review he says :
'A literal obedience to the order of
the 27th of August was a physical im
possibility. It is further shown that
General Porter was desirous of obeying
it literally, so far as was practicable,
but was prevailed upon by his leading
Generals against whom a suspicion of
disloyalty to their commander or to the
cause has never beeu entertained to
do what his own judgment approved
as the best thing to do ; to make a
later start with a view of arriving at
his destination as early as it was possi
ble for him to arrive there, and to give
his jaded and worn troops two hours
more of ueeded rest."
On this point the following state
ment from General Grant is oi great
significance :
" 1 question very much whether
there was au engagement during the
w ir, or a series of engagements, con
tinuing over as much time as was con
sumed in the battles about Bull Ruu
In August, 1802, wheu not only one
but a number of Generals did not ex
ercise their discretion as Porter did ou
this occasion, aud with far less justifi
cation," With regard to the second case
namely, the first or joint order of the
2'.th of August, "to establish commu
nication with Pope. the fact that
Porter was left with 10,000 men to face
Lougstreet, newly arrived in his front
with 2o. 000 men, whom Pope believed
to lie far distant, is sufficient to account
tor the order not being obeyed. Fur
ther, so successfully did Porter engage
Lougstreet that the latter was caused
' to take Wilcox's Division from in
front of Pope iu order to strengthen
the line confronting Porter."
" Thus," says General Gtaut, " Por
ter, without sacrifice of meu aud with
out eudaugeriug auy interests, did
more for Pope's relief than if lie had
gone directly to that General's assist
ance. To have done so would proba
bly have sacrificed his corps without
any benefit, aud jeopardized the Safety
of Pope's army. So far as I have in
vestigated the case and I have studied
it, I think, pretty thoroughly I see no
tact to base the charge of retreat upon.
1 do not see that any argument to
prove this is necessary, because any
reader of history may be defied now to
find where and when General Porter
retreated during the t ime specified."
Upon the " 4:30 p. m. order" Gener
al tyrant enters into fuller detail, as
this ' is the principal one aud the one
that baa most deeply impressed the
general public." As maintained by
i he prosecution In the court-martial of
: SG2, to the apparent satisfaction Of the
Court, the situation of the beligereut
forces vas on that day, iu numbers and
position, as follows, namely : Pope,
with 33,000 men, facing Jackson, with
22,0 H) men, while Porter, with 10,000
men, was drawn up obliquely across
Jackson's right llauk, Porter's right
being towards Pope's left. With this
alleged disposition of the forces there
was some color iu the opinion which
held Porter responsible for hot, attack
ing the "enemy's llauk and rear."
But the facts now accessible to the
world, aud known at the time to Gen
eral Porter, show that the actual situ
ation was, says General Grant, as
shown iu tlie following diagram :
As shown by this diagram. General
Grant continues, Porter was not in a
position to attack the right flank of
Jack-on, because he was at least three
TOi lei- away and not across his flank as
claimed at the court martial. With
Longstreel's piis -nce, to have obeyed
that older lit would have been obliged
with 10,000 men, to have defeated 25,000
mi n n a rho.-et position before he
could have moved upon the llauk of
the enemy, as the order directed. Re
marking upon Geuer&h Porter's appli
cation, now before Congress, asking
thai be may bo restored to the rolls of
the army with the rank that he would
have if the court martial had never
been held," General Grant says:
' This, in my judgment, is a small
part of what, it is possible to do iu this
case and of what ought to be done.
General Porter should, iu the way of
partial restitution, be declared by Cou
gress lohave been convicted on mista
ken testimony, and, therefore, to have
never been out of the army, This
would make him a Major General of
volunteers until the date might be
fix- d for his muster outas of that rank
after which he should be continued as
a Colonel of Infantry and Brevet
Brigadier Grueral of the United States
Army from the date of the act, when
he should be placed upon the retired
list with that rank."
General Grant explains that he
means no criticism upon the Court
which tried General Porter, nor upon
the officers with whom he served."
It is easy to understand how in 1862,
under severe reverses iu the field, the
public were ready to condemn to
death if d ed he auy officer against
whom even a suspicion might be raised.
Till within a year Grant himself be
lieved the judgment on General Porter
was just. In conclusion, Geueral Grant
says, iu words we cannot refrain from
quoting :
" If a solemn and sincere expression
of my thorough understanding aud be
lief in the entire innocence of General
Porter will tend to draw the public
mind to the same conviction, I shall
feel abundantly rewarded for my efforts
It will always be a pleasure to me as
well as a duty, to be the instrument,
even in the smallest degree, of setting
right any man who has been grossly
wronged, especially if he has risked
life and reputation iu defense of his
cauntry. I feel, as stated on a previ
ous occasion, a double interest in this
particular case, because directly after.
the war, as General of the Army, when
I might have been instrumental iu
having justice done to General Porter,
I and later, as President of the United
States, when I certainly could have
done so, I labored under the firm con
viction that he was guilty ; that the
facts of the receipt of the .30 oWer
were as found by the Court, 'and that
I the position of the troops aud.u umbers
! were as given in the first of these dia-
grams. Having become better inform
i ed, I at once voluntarily gave, as I have
I continued to give, my earnest efforts
j to impress the minds of my country
men with the justice of this case, and
I to secure from our government, as far
as it could grant It, the restitution due
to General Filz John Porter."
The (iarfield Claim.
Washington, December 2. Claims
were allowed by the Garfield Board of
Audit as follows : Professional services
of Bliss, $0,500; Agnew and Hamil
ton, $5,000 each ; Reyburu and Boyn
ton, $4,000 eac i ; Edson, $3,000. The
bills for services aud supplies were all
settled, as were also the bills for the
extra services of the Government em
ployes, Stewart! ( 'rump being allowed
but $;u0, Private Secretary Pruden
$200, etc. The total appropriation to
pay the claims against the estate was
$57,500, of which $35,500 was specially
appropriated lor the physicians, etc.
The amount was $8,000 less than the
amount appropriated, aud the allow
ances for outside claims are about $4,000
less than the amount .available, making
a total balance of about $19,000 out of
the entire appropriation.
Protection.
One of thestrougest points Gen. Butler
made in his canvass of Massachusetts
was his exposure of the humbug of
protection. The workiugmen of Low -ell
cheered him to the echo when he
showed them how that they all paid
twice the value of every garment they
woae, in order to enrich the manufac
turing monopolists. His victory, there
fore, means a good deal more than
than Republican dissatisfaction with
the machine. It is significant of an
awakening of the people to one of the
greatest fallacies that ever beguiled in
telligent meu. Brooklyn Eagle.
One day last week Governor Foster
called several times at the White
House, but was unable to obtain an
audience with the President, who was
engaged iu writing his annual message,
aud Foster leit for New York on rail
road business. It is said his missiou
was to protest against Marshal Hen
ry's removal. He considers it unjusti
fiable. He considers Henry innocent.
He thinks, however, that Arthur had
to choose between losing Brewster aud
losiug Henry, and that under the cir
cumstances he acted wisely. The
Marshal himself keeps a stiff upper
lip, aud very sensibly declines ,to talk
for publication.

Correspondence.
On Saturday last Mr. John Bill,
was digging in a well for Mr. Eugene
White, when a two-years old colt, in
attempting to leap across the top, fell
Into the well and onto Mr. Riltz. The
well was about twenty feet deep. Mr.
Riltz was considerably bruised, but
not so bad as he might have been un
der the circumstances. He succeeded
in getting out without receiving any
broken bones. The colt was not bro't
out alive. In its struggles it caused
the dirt to cave In until it was nearly
coveted, only its head and neck being
free. The pressure soon put an end to
its life. It seems some horses in the
same field with the colt chased it aud
caus -d it to take the fatal leap.
Mrs. Libbie Conrad lost, the past
week, a valuable horse. The animal
ran against some sharp pointed object.
cutting a severe gash iu its body, from
which it died.
Mr. Adam Shultz, in the south part
of the township, also lost a valuable
horse from some peculiar disease. It
is said the animal held its head high
and would walk over or against every
thing that came iu its way.
Mies Mary York returned home from
Farmingtou. She will remain during
the Church revival which is in pro
gress here. She assists at the organ,
and after the revival here she will en

Thanksgiving service was held in
the Disciple Church. Service opened
with singing by the choir, followed by
the reading of the 147 Ps, by Rev. J.
Redinger. Rev. Mr. Moore, of the M.
E. Church, spoke from the text : " He
hath not dealt so with any nation," a
part of the 20th verse of 147 Ps. He
spoke of this as being pre-eminently a
Christian nation, recognizing God, as
the giver and dispenser of all good,
both temporal and spiritual ; a people
recognizing this fact, aud as loyal citi
zens, it was fit that they should come
together iu accordance with the proe'.a
mation of the President aud the Gov
ernor to render thanks for the many
blessings we have enjoyed as a nation
during the past year. He spoke of the
abundant harvest as being more than
was expected. That this country was
rapidly approaching the time when it
would be the store house of nations
from which they would draw largely
their supplies ; of thecommercial pros
perity of the people and the stability
of our institutions. We had abundant
reason to be thankful for the manner
iu which the people, in the majesty of
their power had rebuked and crushed
machines, combinations and cliques,
which had endeavored lo control and
shape the pclitical affairs of the country
There had been no retrograde move
ment in the churches, but a steady ad
vance all along the line. What many
mistook for infidelity was nothing
more than the reaching out of the
mind after new truths and the rejec
tion of many things which had been
taught in the past, but no Bible truth
had beeu rejected. It was a very ap
propriate and excellent discourse for
the occasion. We have only hinted at
some of the leading thoughts, without
trying to give the connection or lan
guage of the speaker. The house was
well filled and the siugiug good.
Among the marriages last week we
notice that of Mr. J. Knapp and Miss

Correspondence,
Farmers iu this vicinity are about
done husking corn, which yielded
much more than was expected.
Wheat is coming in at Mishler's ele
vator quite lively, at $1 per bushel, al
though farmers are holding back some
on account of low prices. Some over
$4,000 has been paid out this month
(Nov.) for grain at this place.
Mr. M. B. Mishler has shipped this
season nearly 1000 bushels of clover
seed. He is now paying $5 per bushel
and choice lots a few cents more.
Parties are now shipping from here
a large quantity of Aspen wood which
is to be made into toothpicks and
wooden ware.
Mr. C. Ij. Brumbaugh is stocking up
his lumber yard quite extensively and
selling several car loads per week.
The cheese factory has suspended for
the winter aud will start again early
next spring.
This cold weather makes the coal
trade brisk. Those using Couuotton
Coal seem to like it very well, especial
ly the blacksmith coal, of which there
is a great deal sold here.
A good country store is very much
needed here. It would be a good open
ing for some enterprising bufliness man
as there are large ijuantitiesof country
produce that could be shipped from
here if some one would do it. xx.
People are beginning to wonder what
has become of the report of the census
of 1880, which it was promised would
be completed in a shorter Lime th-tii
ever before. Nearly two years and a
half have elapsed since the taking of
t le census was commenced, aud yet,
beyond a naasss of bulletins issued l y
the census office to a few favored indi
viduals the public are iu the dark in
regard to the material condition of the
country, to ascertain which so much
of the people's money has been ex
pended. The statistics furnished by
the report, if it ever comes, will have
lost much of their freshness and in-terest.

FOR RESTORING GRAY HAIR TO ITS
NATURAL VITALITY AND COLOR.
It is a most agreeable dressing, which
is once harmless and effects!, for pre
serving the hair. It restores, with the
i;loss and freshness of youth, faded or gray,
light, and red hair, to a rich brown, or deep
black, as may be desired. By its use thin
hair is thickened, and baldness often
though not always cured. It checks falling
of the hair immediately, and causes a new
growth i;i all cases where tlie glands are
j not decayed; while to brashy, weak, or
! otherwise diseased hair, it imparts vitality
I and strength, and renders it tillable.
The Via on cleanses the scalp, cures and
prevents tiie formation of dandruff; and,
; by its cooling, stimulating, and soothing
j properties, it heals most if not all of the
i humors and diseases peculiar to the scalp,
keeping it cool, clean, and soft, under
I which conditions diseases of the scalp and
: hair are impossible.
As a Dressing for Ladies' Hair
The Vioor is incomparable. It is color
less, contains neither oil nor dye, and will
not s:ii! white cambric. It imparts an
agreeable and lasting perfume, and as an
article for the toilet it is economical and
unsurpassed in its excellence.
