The relations of the United Statas srith

The year has been an eyentfalbne, juavrtV
ncssmg two great nations, .jspeakmg,, ppe

by peaceful arbitratioiia, :dispeAof Jag J
eiawuiog, ma uauie, ul aaj tnue, turjng
those nations into bloody conflicts, it,Au
example has thus been se which, if sue
cessful in its final issue, may bet'fvllowed
by other civilized nations, and be the '.'final
means of returning to productive' ndusiry,
millions of men now waiutainejlfo settle
the disputes of nations by' thetay9ne't and
broadsword. I transmit herewith 'a 'copy
ot the treaty alluded to, which has - Leon.
cuuciuueu since me aajourument oi VOH
irress. with her Britainie Maiostv. Snd' n
copy of the protocol of the conferences of I
cj - - j j w . . rw4
the Commissioners by whom it was "riego -
tiated. This treaty provides methods for
adjusting the questions pending between
the two nations. Tho various questions
are to be adjusted by arbitrations. ' l
,: THE NATIOXAL DEDT'"' V'!'
has been reduced to the extent of eighty-
six millions fifty-seven thousand one hun
dred and twenty-six dollars and eighty
cents during the year, and by the negoti
ation of national bonds at a lower rate of
interest, the interest on the public debt
has been so far diminished that now the
sum to be raised for the interest account
is nearly seventeen million dollars' less
than on the first of March, ISM. It was
highly desirable that this rapid dimuniton
should take place, both to strengthen the
credit of tho country, and convince " its ci
tizens of their entire ability to meet every
dollar of liability without . bankrupting
them, liut in view of the accomphfch-
menf of these desirable ends and of : the
rapid development of the resources of the
country, its increasing ability to meet
large demands and tho amount-already
paid, it is not desirable that the present
resources of the country should coutiuue
to be taxed in order to continue this rapid
payment. I therelore recommend a
modification of both.
TAItlFK AD JXTEKXAL TAX LAW'S.
I would recommend that all taxes from
internal sources be abolished, except those
on spirituous, vinous and malt liquors,
and tobacco in its various . forms from
stamps. In readjusting the tariff I sug
gest that a careful estimate be niadp of
the amount of surplus revenue collected
under the present laws, after providing for
the curcnt expenses of the government,
the interest account and a sinking fund,
and that this as a surplus be' reduced in
such a manner as to afford the greatest re
lief to the greatest number. There are
many articles not produced at home, such
as medicines and compounded essences,
from which very little revenue is derived,
but which enter into general use. n AIL
such articles I recommend to be placed
on the free list. Should a further redue
tion prove advisable, I would then recom
mend that it be made on those. articles
which it can, without disturbing Iiomapro-,
daetion, or reducing tho wages of Auwrn
can labor. I have not entered, into fig
ures, because to do so would be to . repeat
all that is laid before jou in the: reporb of:
the Secretary of tho Treasury. -; J? :n

POLITICAL DISABSLITIES.
More thaq six years having elapsed
since he last hostile gun was fired between
the armies then arrayed against each oth
er" one for the perpetuation,' and the oth
er of tlie'oe-struct ion of the Union, it
may' be well considered whether it is not
ticic that the' disabilities imposod by the
Fourteeth Amendment should be remov
ed ; that the ahienclnier.t does not exclude
the ballot, '"but only requires the disability
to "hold office of Certain classes, when tho
pur 5fy of flic ballot and secure majorities
are sure to ; elect'officera' reflecting the
views of the majority;," I do not see the
advantage or propriety of excluding men
from office merely.-" They were, before
the rebellion, men of standing and chara
cter sufficient to" bp' elected to positions
requiring them to take an oath to support
the Constitution, and admitting to eligi
bility those entertaining the same views,
but of less standing in their communities.
Ikniay be said the former violated an oath
while the latter did not. ; The latter did
not have -it in their power to do so. If
they had taken this oath it' can not be
doubted they would have broken it as did
the former class. . If there are any great
er criminals distinguished a"rove nil others J
for the part they took in opposition to the

Wluxt is a Gentleman!
In the course of au address to the Leeds
i uung wen a uuristiau Association, de
livered lately by the Bishop of Manches
ter, his lordship said: .. ,i. .-
j "Some peopie think ; gentleman'
means a man of independent fortune a
man who fares sumptuously every day ; a
man who need not work hard for his daily
Dread. - rone oi tlies thinks makes a gen
tleman ; not one of them, nor all of them
together. I haTo known men when I was
brought closer in contact with working
men than from my changed position, I
am brought now, I have known men of
the roughest exterior, who had been ac
customed all their lives to follow the plow
hnd look after horses, as thorough geutle
men in nean as any nooicman tlint ever
wore a ducal coronet. I mean I have
known them as unselfish, I -have known
tnem as truiiiiui, i nave known tnm as
sympathizing ; and all these qualities go
to make what i vnoerstand by the term a
gentleman.' It is a noble privilege which
has been sadly prostituted, and what I
want to tell you is that the humblest man
in Leeds who has the lowest work to do,
if his heart is tender and pure, and true.
can be, in the most emphatic sense f the
worda gentleman."'
4 ITIetlilist Preacher Dies, Lear
ius In an Old Trunk.
For startling sensations Clarke county
is the champion county of Indiana. We
arc scarce recovered from the sensations
of the Park family murder and the . hang
ingt)F the negro murderers, when another
extraordinary affair, of an entirely differ
ent character, however, startles us by its
stranceness. Ilev. Kezin Hammond was
a noted local preacher of the Methodist
Church, and resided for many years at
Charlcstown Ind. He died some four
weeks ago, after a'lingering illness. Dur
ing his lifetime he. bad been a prudent,
economical man, LutLy no uieuns miserly
in disposition, for he gave liberally ti all
commendable objects. .
It was known that he was quite wealthy
in real estate his wealth being the result
of the advance in the value of his lands,
which were judiciously purchased in local
ities where improvements were steadily
going forward. But ut the time of his
death not a very large sum of money was
found among his effocts ; nor had his fam
ily any knowledge that he had other funds
than what his bank account and .his pock
et book showed.
The administrator of the estate was pro
ceeding by due course of law to settle its
affairs, and this made an inventory of the
contents of his lato residence in . Charles-
tawn necessary- This inventory was be
ing proceeded with on Thursday last, when
an old, but tolerably large trunk was found
stowed away in a closet under a pair of
stairs on the first floor of the house, and
within the bed-room occupied by the de
ceased daring his lifetime. This .old
trunk was drawn from its dingy quarters.
and was literally covered over with dust
and cobwebs. Its great weight, however,
attracted particular attention, and as no
key could be found with which to unlock
it, the lock was broken.
And now comes the singular part of the
story. Oil raising the lid of the trtink it
was found that the body of tho box was
literally filled with gold ud silver coin
and government bond;?. . A ..grandson, of
the deceased informs us that there were
twenty-Cve thousand dollars In gold and
silver,-and ten thousand dollars in govern
ment bonds. . Mrs. Ilammoud, who sur
vives her husband, says that daring the
raid of Gen. John Morgan through Indi
ana. Mr. Hammond drew all his money
from the bank and other Bonrces, and
placed it together in this" old trunk, which
be secreted where it was found.- She had
supposed, however, that after the danger
from Morgan and liu men-had. passed, he
naa again aepositcu tne money irom
jvhence it had been drawn ; and ' although
it was known to hor that the trunk was in
the closet, she never dreamed of the im
mense treasure it contained. . - ; . :,
The money was counted by the proper
parties, and then carried to Jeflersonvilie,
where it was deposited for safe keeping io
the Citizens National Dank. At the time
of his death Rev. Mr. Hammond was prob
ably the wealthiest Methodist minister in
the West, except, perhaps, Bishop AmesJ
We arc informed that his - estate is esti
mated at not less than three hundred. and
fifty thousand dollars. . It is not often tliet
a minister of the gospel has so fortunate a
run of luck in the accumulation of wealth.
Mr. Hammond several times a few days
before his death, attempted to tell his
family something that seemed to-bear with
weight upon his mind ; but he was too de
bilitated either to talk or write. Several
times he was noticed to 'point'' anxiously
toward the closet, and it is now thought
his desire was to communicate to his. fam
ily the place where his treasure was hidr

: The secret for securing . the, best prico
lies in proper dressing, alter securiog good
fatetock. Thin, beney poultry, with
craws stuffed firet before killing; isscarce

et such stock brings butJUtla or nothing.
. Turkeys, chickens, .ducks and gece
should be ,'dry-picked," and great care
must be had that the skin is not broken.
Scalding is not altogether condemned, but
scalded poultry never looks so well, and
if not thoroughly cold beforo packing it
is likely to become slimy and tainted. It
is fair to say that the . difference in - tho
prico of scalded and dry-picked poultry is
from two to eight cents par pound; No
further trouble; of dressing m necessary
after tbe picking is done, as tlnw.v poul
