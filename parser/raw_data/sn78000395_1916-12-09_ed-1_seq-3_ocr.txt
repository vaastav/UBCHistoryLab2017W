THING SWORTH WHILE.
EXERCISE FOR BI-'„\UTV.
The woman who does her own
housework is usually worn out at thp
end of the day. She is apt to con
elude, therefore, that exercise is not
a word intended for her. She could
hardly make a greater mistake, how
ever. A woman needs a half hour's
rest near the middle of the day, it
is tru^e. hilt she needs also systematic
':nd stimulating exercise.
One reason why women are so
fatiarued at the enrl of the day is that
they lack i.iuscle tone. Half an hour
of brisk exercise suited to the par­
ticular needs of each individual, ati'l
taken regularly, followed by a coir!
dash of water, will serve to keep the
whole muscular and nervous systerr
In tone. It also works wonders in
keeping pyes bright and color good,
something that all women desire.
NEW VEILS.
Colorefl veils float everywhere, and
le it said that the floating colored
veil is more becoming than the close
ly drawn -one. A veil of leaf-green
hexagonal mesh has a sprawling leaf
pattern hand-run in the mesh and is
worn with a turban crowned with
overlapping green velvet leaves. A
cerise veil of square mesh with a
ramage design has been selected bv a
woman with perfectly white hair "but
a charmingly fresh complexion, and
the effect is enchanting.
CLEANING SUEDE CLOVES.
Suede gloves generally defy the
home cleaner. Tf only slightly soiled
they can be cleaned with art gum. I
which sells for 5 cents at any station
ery shop. Sometimes rubbing them
with a block of magnesia will do the
business: or they may be washed with I
com meal or finely grated stale bread.'
It is unwise to use a liquid cleanser
on suede gloves.
SCORCH STAINS.
All traces of the damage done by
too hot an iron may be quickly re­
moved by dampening with peroxide
of hydrogen, then pressing and put­
ting in the- sun to dry.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 8.—"Increased
fost of living" brought, employes of
I the Broderick and Bascom Rope
company, including Seattle and New
York branch plants, 10 per cent salary
increases, dating from last July 1.
TO TREAT CORDUROY.
Never press corduroy, however,
badly wrinkled it may be, but turn it
on the wrong side, and dampen thor­
oughly, hanging it up to dry, where
it will not wrinkle. You wil! find it
restored to its original freshness.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 8.—The
cost of living is higher in the United
States, which is at peace, than it is
in England and Frace, which are at
war.
This declaration is made by Charles
Edward Russell, writing in the Pub­
lic Ledger on prices of foodstuffs in
this country and abroad.
"Meat is generally dearer in the
United States, where it is produced,
than in England, where it is im­
ported. even in war times," writes
Russell.
Meat Varies Little.
".Meat prices have not risen much
in France since the war began. We
have known, meat prices to climb
more in two years of peace in the
United States than they have risen
in two years of war in France."
In attempting to discover the rea­
son for this condition, Russell dis­
covered that while meat is cheap in
France, there are no financial "mel­
ons" cut for the benefit of stockhold­
ers in packing houses. No irm has
declared a stock dividend of $80,000.
"00 from accrued profits of the meat
business, as the Armour company did
in October, nor has any French pack
'ng house corporation issued $25,000.
000 in nice, fresh, new stock for its
stockholders along with a 25 per cent
dividend which exactly pays for the
stock, as did the Swift company Re­
cently.
Government Kills Animals.
The reason for lo wmeat prices and
absence of juicy "melons" for pack­
ing house stockholders, according to
Russell, is bee* 'ise in France the gov­
ernment does all the slaughtering of
animals for food does it at cost and
for all comers. The French cattle
raisers send their cattle to the govern­
ment and the government kills them
under the. highest scientific condi­
tions and turns the meat over to the
retailer, who can sell it only at
a.price

FASHION HINTS
There are three frocks that the
woman tired of dark blue will be in­
terested in hearing about. First, the
skirts are several inches longer than
last season's frocks, and there is a
notable fullness in the long leeves.
and in each one of the ttiree there 19
the ubiquitous touch of fur. One, of
mustard colored broadcloth, had a
perfectly plain bodice, fnished at the
neck with a wide standoffish kind of
collar trimmed with skunk tails in
front in liep of a cravat. At the nat­
ural waist line there was found a
delicious shade of blue satin, quilted,
and from the back came a narrow
belt of the cloth, which tied
very
low
in the front. The ends of the belt were
finished with an attractive ornament
Pockets on either side were also trim­
med with the skunk fur. Until the
weather becomes very cold a dress ot
this description can be worn without
an extra wrap, but effective acces­
sories are a muff of skunk fur and a
bag trimmed with the same pelty.
Of bottle green panne velvet and
gray chinchilla fur was the second
frock, that looked for*all the world
like a smart *coat suit. In this frock
the bodice was also very plain, but­
toning down the front with four
rather large buttons. Two narrow
belts hugged the waist closely in the
front, but were interrupted in front
of the hips with peplums of the vel­
vet bear trimmed in a small pattern.
The peplum reached halfway to the
knees and was edged with the chin­
chilla. A deep turnover collar of the
fur and narrow cuffs formed the
only other trimming on this smart
coat dress.
The third frock of this trio was
fashioned of chestnut colored broad­
cloth.
The bodice of this frock was also
very plain. The only thing to break
the plainness wa§ a narrow band of
embroidery that extended below the
waist line at least six inches. The
wide standoffish collar was formed
of fur, as were the cuffs. A wide
crushed gir»le of the broadcloth
fastened at the side with an oval
buckle. The skirts of all three were
very simple, merely hemmed, with
tho exception of the bottle green
panne velvet, which had peeping be­
low the very edge of the skirt a nar­
row fringe of exactly the same color.
CIGAR GIRLS
WIN STRIKE?
DETROIT, Mich., Nov. 29.—Strik­
ing cigar girls have been jailed be­
cause they dared to violate an in­
junction and the Detroit Labor News
makes this cutting comment on the
causes of the s*rike:
"Very good evidence that the strik­
ing cigar girls have not been receiv­
ing a living wage, is evinced from
the fact that- the three little girls
who were sentenced by Judge Col
lingwojjd to spend 15 days apiece in
the county jail for contempt of court,
have gained on an average ^f 11
pounds each, after having received
three square meals a day."
DETROIT, Mich., Nov. 29.—Con­
ferences have been asked for by em­
ployers of the striking cigar girls
and the situation looks good for a
settlement. If the strike is settled it
is probable that the injunction pros­
ecutions will be dropped.
Less than half of«one per cent of
the population receive one-fifth of the
national income.
fixed by the government.
As a result, Russell finds that in
France there are no packing house
problems or profits nobody stands
between producer and consumer, tak­
ing toll from bo'^i.
Good Meat Certain.
"Suppose, for instance, the govern­
ment of Illinois was to undertake all
the meat slaughtering done in that
state," writes Russel!. "It would, of
course, erect the most sanitary
slaugherhouses, adopt and follow the
most scientific precautions, and care­
fully inspect all animals it killed. We
should then be sure we were not eat­
ing lumpy jaw, tuberculosis or trichi­
nae. It would slaughter for all com­
ers at cost, and the producers of the
west would send in their herds, as­
sured that they would get the actual
returns without deductions for melons
or' stock 'ssues. All retailers would
get their meat at cost price and with­
out discrin 'nation, standing-upon ex­
actly the same footing.
Melons AVould Buy Plant.
"The amount of the -melons recently
cut by two packing concerns in Chi­
cago would provide the state with the
greatest and best slaughtering estab­
lishment In the world. Under our
present system, this money has heen
taken from producer and consumer.
No #ne can suggest any ieti rn pro*
ducer and consumer have had from
it or. ever will have—except the satis­
faction of knowing now where it has
gone
to."

THINGS TO EAT.
TOASTED MUFFINS.
The whole wheat or cornmeal muf­
fins are baked while getting Satur
days dinner. Sunday morning spill
them and put in oven or on broilei
to toast. One must be careTul not
to leave them in too long or they wiJi
burn. They must be watched.
Fruit butter can be made from
dried peaches, apricots, prunes
or
raisins and should always be on
hand, not only to keep "the butter
bill down," but it makes a pleasant
change.
COLD SLICED LAMB.
The thin outer part- of the shoulder
was used for last evening's dinner and
the thick part is sliced thin for today.
Cut only what is needed, place on
plate and garnish with parsley a no
the celery heart.

egg whites, pinch of salt, one tea
spoonful vanilla, whipped cream

cold milk and add to the scalded

10 minutes, stirring constantly until
thickened. Melt chocolate, add hot
water, stirring until smooth, and then
add to the cooked mixture. Fold In

crust, toast quickly a li^ht brown,
butter and cover with thin slices of
rather new, rich cheese spread over
a very little made mustard, place on
a pie tin or plate in a hot oven till

teaspoonful of soda. Beat into milk
until dissolved one and two-thirds

it is brittle when dropped into water

the fire and stand in a vessel of very

LEAGUE IN EFFORT
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—The de­
partments of agriculture, commerce
postoffice and many members .of
congress are leagued Wednesday in
an effort to check the high cost of
living. Theirs efforts, are the direct
result of appeals from the publi.
General boycotts, food distatorshlp,
a food embargo, government price
control—all th^se are recommended
in a mass of messages to President
Wilson, cabinet members and con
gresssmen.
The agricultural deparment Is
working on plans for an increased
crop yield as an effective remedy.
The commerce branch reported "some
progress" Wednesday in pondering
food cost and distribution problems.
Th$ postoffice department advanced
.a proposal to make necessities more
reasonable—and less costly—through
the parcel post.
Meantime, there is a vast senti­
ment for a gpvernment commission
to fije prices. Representative Fitz­
gerald is snowed under with approv­
als of his idea and believes he can
force the proposal through.
