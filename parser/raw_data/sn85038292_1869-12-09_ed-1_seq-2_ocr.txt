lid tbatthis bill was the result of pa

The President's luao
The President's Message wee sent, in
manaacript, to Congress a short time after
that body assembled on Monday last. It is
the topic of general discussion, nod meets
with universal approbation by repnhlioaaa.
It contains some business like suggestions,
but on the whole it is a weak document and
contains some glaring inconsistencies: for
example, while the President argues that
Knglaad mast be held for conseqaential
damages for prematurely recognising the
Confederates, he nevertheless, in his Cuban
argument, concedes ell the British govern
menl claims when he aaya: “This nation
is iti own judge when to accord the right of
belligeronlcy.” The awsaage is too long
for our columns and wa will only give a sy
nopsis ofil token from the Baltimore Oa
zeite.
President Grant, is hit annual ex*
sago, expresses the profoundest grati
tude for thingi gcu early, and states
thut though the efforts of Congress have
not been as successful as desirsblc, still
they were quite as mueh so as could
reasonably have been anticipated.
Recommends that Georgia (which
has not adopted the Fifteenth Amend
men t) be reconstructed AO as to turn
oul white delegates and replace them
by blacks, who were illegally elected.
That Virginia, having done all that
was required, be admitted.
That an immediate resumption, if
prncticublc, is not desirable, and that
fluctuations in gold be stopped by an
thoriilng the Treasury to enlarge its
stock operations by redeeming legal
lenders fur gold at n fixed price and
selling them again if applied for.
That overdue Government 6 per cent
bonda bo swapped for 4| per cents., if
the thing can be managed.
That, as the revenue is already larger
than is needed, and promise* to increase,
the cxborbitant tariff bo not interfered
with for present.
That, for the same reason, the Income
Tax, at 3 per cent, be continued for
throe yenrs longer.
.That the dignity of (he office of Com
missioner of Internal Revenue be made
commensurate with the importance of
the gentleman who fills it.
Thst although this Government eym
pathises with Cuba, belligerent righta
cannot be accorded to the Cubans until
the coolest warrants it.
That an interoceanic canal be built
at Darien, il it can be done by private
enterprise.
That as he did not feel anlborixed to
detain the Spanish gunboats, hn tiad
them up in law courts.
Thst the Alabama questions be set
tied so soon ms Knglaad appreciates the
gravity of their character and removes
the sense of unfriendliness to this coun
ty manifested during its simple for ex
istence.
Thst for the purpose of roltiratiog
our relations with Chinn, the imports
tion of Chinese coolies be prohibited.
That to enable us to fulfil our obliga
tions, the whole public debt should be
declared payable iu coin.
Thai as the Tenure of Office could
not hare been intended to embarrass
the. president, it had better be repealed
That to quiet the Indians, whom he
calls the nation s wards, and prevent
strife, all the tribes be exilod to remote
reservations.
That is the fraokiog privilege is aim
ply an abuse, it be rcpealsd.
The Message then compliments the
munificence of Congress, recommends
liberal appropriations to the Agricultu
rsl. Bureau and increase 1 pay to the
Judges of the Supreme Court. It al
ludes gracefully to the patixiam end
statesmanship of members of Coogrsas,
wisely, however, abstaining from the
mention of particular names, and close*
with a promise of a rigid adherence
to aod strict enforcement of lews, in
cluding amendments, no doubt.

1 if 1 dure tu uddrvss you. Isms mao at the
brink of the gravo aad my Boat aball fioon meet
with iu Maker. It matters, therefore, but lit
tle to me wbat people may think. 1 apeak the
f troth, the full truth, when 1 say lam an iono
. cent maw. I did nut kill tint woman. Bat
• before I leaf* tbis world I fuel it my duty to
make some atatemeoU yet to your Excellency.
Mrs. Parker has swore "that Mias Stinuockc
bad told her that the Doctor had given her
sowsthing to make her sleep/' aad that I
•book my head* and said, "I didn't give her
any thing Uk make her sleep."
Mrs. M. Shind. l has swore "that 1 had told
l her Miasßtiuuueke had usked me for something
, to pat her to sleep, bat that I refused to give
| it to hcr saying she was too weak."
I Permit m some words ia regard to both
| statements. I here repeat I did not give Miss
Stinoecke a parlUmimr medicine to make her
sleep. All aka got from me was two grains uf
I tartar-emetic and ten grains of pul vis ipecacu
anha. But Mia a well known fact, aut only to
physician*, but uiuo to almost every parson
1 who aver took aa emetic, tbal such a combine
i Una of tartar-emetic with ipecacuanha bat the
effect—after the vomiting ia ofsr-le make a
person sleep, the ipecacuanha then operating
t as an aulMpasrieeai. When Miss Slinnecke,
therefore, after she bad vomited, asked me to
. give her something to make her sleep, I may
1 have mU4—onljr ia order to stop her asking—
I ‘ the medicine which I have given you will
make you sleep," knowing myself, very well,
that it is the usual consequence of an emetic
compounded of tsrtar-emetic and ipecacuanha
to cause sleep. And Miss Stinnecke. taking
• my words jnst as they were spoken, and witb
-1 out knowing the connection of my thoughts,
could then have told Mrs. Parker "that the
Doctor bad given her something to make her
p sleep," Your Excellency will know very well
‘ that it is sometimes the sad dul vof a physician
nut to tell bis patients, especially his lady pu
, tients, the full truth, in order to appease and
calm their imprudent asking and troubling. I
distinctly recollect thst when Miss Slinnecke,
[ im tit evemimy, asked me for someth mg to nut
her to sleep, 1 refused to give it to her; as Mrs.
Shindcl has testified.
; Id regard to the charge made against me
. that 1 had poisoned Miss Stinoecke with prus
sic acid, 1 bore swear before Uod that Miss
Stinoecke nstwr got one drop of prnasic acid
from me. I never bought prussic acid in Har
risburg. lam a mnn possessed uf so marked
a face—beside* tbis wearing gold spectacles of
\ a form not commonly worn here in America—
that every person woo ever saw mo once will
recogoixe' me at once. And in addition to tbis,
I assure your Excellency that I—till to the fu
i neral of Miss Slinnecke, in Baltimore—not onlv
■ never wore a hard eilk iat, but also had no't
1 even, till to that time, la my yes eeeeion such a
hat. Mr. Herron, of Ifarrbbarg, therefore, is
I mistaken if he thinks that I bought prussic acid
from him.
5 Yonr Excellency will kindly allow me boro
to tell how ibis whole cue was brought up
against me. As soon as it turned out that Miss
Stinoecke had left a will making me her sole
I heir, people began to talk; I had poisoned
Miss Stinoecke in order to get her money.—
Many, very many, persons grudged mo this
fortune, kour Excellency can be assured, Aad
> it mot item for lit money / would never Kate been
, indicted. Already, long before the trial, and
long before there existed an alleged ror/jue de
• Kefs, it was perfectly certain to the mind of
. the people here that I bad committed a mur
der. All the witnesses of the Commonwealth
who swore against me want upon the witness
; etivad with the certain opinion in their mind
that I was a murderer, aod bad poinoned this
woman. They did not ask, in the first place,
"Did this woman die by poison ?" They said
so—" Dr. Scboßppc has poisoned this woman :
how can we new fix this case V*
‘ I* • poor foreigner, without influential
friends aad powerful connections, whereas the
| word of my pnblic prosecutor was of great in-
Hence with the pnblic opinion. An Immense
' prejudice was raised against me. Even intel
ligent men were not free of tbis. So, for in
, t*nce, remarked ez-Jndge Watts, long before
the trial, "They shonld nut try Ur. scbceppe
' >t nil; be ought to be hanged right away 1, 1
, am convinced your Excellency will not term
such words "justice," for the faw says "crime
■ball never be jtresrmed."
W hen the trial came on my prosecutors un
derslood most skillfully bow to operate with
• the pnblic opinion. Deople were stirred np in
i order to press the pnblic opinion upon the
jury. In so doing my proaecotors most per
fectly succeeded, for the inry, daring my trial.
> was in a continued illegal communication with
the people, a the statement of the constable
who attended the jury on my trial has shown.
A mob was kirad ana placed under the window
of the room wbera the jury had retired to make
ap a verdict, who yelled np, "llang that d—d
Dutchman I"
Knowing that I was hiaocent, I was quiet
and calm during the trial, for I trusted the law
would protect me. 1 measured the circum
stances and matter here with tue same measure
I was used to apply to things in Europe. But
I have been must dreadfully disappointed, and
shall now nay with my Ufa for a crime which
has never been committed at all. It was said
at the trial by one of my prosecutors to the
jury. "Do yon think that that fellow (mo)
would have married that lady T" Bat tbis was
not the question. The question was s "Did
this lady die by poison T* No mao possessed
of a fair aad naprejudiced mind will xay that
it kaa been proven that Miss Slinnecke died by
poison. The law requires this proof before it
is allowed to take my life.
I know, your Excellency, you are a gentle
man of an honest character and of a fair aod
jev, mind, and I am convinced your Excellency
would never allow that innocent blood beaked
I rrpoee the highest confidence in yon. Yon

The work on the Parklon and Man

The eontraelois, Messrs MeGukeu,
Shower & Co., have a force of about
eighty men at work on the eastern or

that about one mile of the most difficult
part of the road has been graded Mr.
Joseph Oitt’s engineer corps isengsged
in surveying aud leveling the lino ol
the road. The contractors desire to
complete the grading before next Au

the appearance of our town by erecting
fine dwellings, but have by their exam

Mr. Joseph Sharrer brought to town

It is one of the most singular freaks of

reasons, it is believed to have been
brought forth alive. The two ears on
the buck part of the head are united so
closely that they are only separated by
a kind of partition, iluth bodies arc
perfect; two of the legs aro crossed
over the backs of the pig. There is
nothing unsightly about it. It bus been

siderable comment and ■•peculation
Sumo said it was another Fenian scare,
while others contended that the troops
had been called out to watch Cubans
The real object, it appears, was uot sum
peeled outside of the initiated.
A short lime since, it will be re
membered, the officers of the Internal
Revenue Department made a raid upon
the illicit distilleries iu the Fifth Ward,
and seised a number of stills Hereto
fore the officers, when attempting to
make seizures in this section, have been
assaulted and beaten in the most brutal
manner. The Government resolved to
break up this wholesale illicit distilling
business, nad the order for the military
to hold themselves in readiness to march
at a moment’s notice was fur the pur
pose of making one fell swoop on the
distillers of the Fifth Ward. It is
needless to say that the distillers were
completely taken by surprise, and when
the troops arrived ou the ground they
found them busily at work io the va
rious sheds, stables, cellars, Ac. There
were upwards of five hundred regulars
marched through the city at 6 o'clock
this morning to the locality in question.
They were all fully equipped, having
six days' rations and aixty rounds o
cartridges Operations were immediate
ly commenced in Little street by the
revenue officers, who were under com
mand of Major General Ploasontoo, 00l
lector of the 4th Internal Revenue Dis
trict, N. Y. He planned the expedition
iu question. He was accompanied by
four deputies and fifty men. These
deputies were armed with axes, and
designated by white satin badge*, worn
upon the lappels of their coats, with the
words “ Internal Revenue Department.”
Some of the distillers endeavored, to
get away with their effects, but they
wore overhauled by the troops, who were
guarding at evfcry available point.
The forces consisted of Co. M, First
U. 8. Heavy Artillery, of Fort Hamil
ton, and three other companies of the
same garrison; 200 nun from Gover
nor’s Island; 100 men from Fort Wads
worth, S. L.;ouu company from Willet's
Point. The battallioo from Governor’s
Island was under command of Lieuten
ant-Colonel Kiddo, General Abbott com
manding the Wiilet’a Point forces. In
Water street Co. M Ist Heavy Artillery
formed u barricade with arms sucked,
extending across the street, while
videttes were thrown out in advuoo of
main guard. Here five barrels of whis
key were torn out from some small
wooden structures aud were carted to
the Navy Yard as rapidly aa possible,
while crowds of men, women and ohil
dreo stood gazing attentively at (be
work. The scene was a strange oue.—
Around the doom of the bar-rooms, and
oo the street corners in groups, rough
looking men were earnestly disouasing
the position of affairs. From appear
aoee n majority of the men had been
engaged in the business, and had been
confident of their power to reeist any
attempt to break it up. The sadden
raid of such a power upon them this
morning seemed to have entirely un
nerved them, and thov made no resist
aoce. Towat ds noon there were minors
of an organised fore* being gotten op to
resist the military, bnt nothing definite
could be ascertained about it. Up to
noon, 13 stills and 160 barrels of whis
key bad been seised The larger por
tion of the whiskey was emptied into
the gutters, sod the air was redolent
with whiskey.—AT Y. hxpre* s.

The Income Tax.
The New York Shu takes General
Grant to tusk oo learning that be in
tend* to recommend the re-enactment
oftbel.iw imposing (he inquisitorial
and odious income lax. It says :
The income tax wa imposed at a
time of the greatest danger (his country
has every known. The people did not
like it, but they submitted (o it for the
sake of National safely and success.
The law was universally regarded ns a
war measure, or it could uot have been
passed ; and the 119th section of the
act itself contains a most emphatic
pledge that (he tax ou income should
cease with the war. says :
“And 6c it further enacted, That the
taxes ou income* herein imposed shall
be levied on the first day of March, and
be due and payable on or before (be
thirtieth day o April iu each year, tin
til and including the year eighteen
hundred and seventy, and ho lonjerV
Now, when President Grant began
his administration, ho appointed Air.
Stewart, Secretary of the Treasury, in
total ignorance of (he law which forbade
(hat gentleman to accept the pluc . We
should hope that a similar want of in
formation might not mislead the Prosi
dent iu regard to the income tax It
is by no means certain, however, that
knowledge will teach him wisdom in
this case any more than it did then
He began by requesting the repeal of a
law which had stood on the statute book
(illy years, io order ilia; bis jKjrsoiial
friend and pecuniary benefactor might
take office under him. U would not be
very surprisiug, therefore, were he now
to advise Congress to violate the sol
emnly pledge faith of the nation
But should ho do this, be will com
mit an enormous wrong. We have
tbowu (hat iu the internal revenue act
which contains the provisions relating
to the income (ax, the national I*ogislu
ture promised the pimple that the tax
should cease to be levied after 1870
“ [’atit and including the year titjhtecn
hundred and seventy, and no lunger
are the words, Instead of a recommen
dation from the President that the law
be reenacted, it would be bis duty, iu
case Congress should vole to continue
it, to veto the bill. Thu Government
of the United Stales, powerful as it is,
must uot be at liberty to disregard its
pledges to the people, just before those
pledge* were made five or six years ago.
No statute of limitations runs against
the public, by which the rulers of the
laud cun escape the just performance of
their promises.
