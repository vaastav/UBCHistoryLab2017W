CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY DEC. lh IST4.
' ■
The First National Hank of IT tub
owes the Govenmieut about $100,000
and cannot pay. Another steal from
the people.
Ai.KXAirocß H. Str.i'ui*i>isi weighs
only eighty pounds. Averdupois, he
may he considered the light weight or
Congress*.
i in: Santa Gnu Sentinel says Jim
Mi Clatcuy is mado up of throe bun
dled pounds of beef and one ounce of
brains. This make-up would do for
our unliable friend across the way,
minus the brains.
t'oxoßKss starts in on the Southern
Pacific Kailioad. We hope It will stay
on the track. If the power* over
at Washington will stop spending
money on the Indiana of Arizona and
invest it in the Southern or Texas Pa
cific. Railroad, they will soon so civil
ize tlie Apaches that no harm will
ever be done by any of them.
Hevorts from all parts of the coun
ty are full of promise. The acreage
which will be seeded this season will
more than double that of any previous
year since thesettlement of ;he valley.
The amount of small grain we shall
harvest will bo largely In excess of
former years, if tho crops are us good
as anticipated. If the largo wheat
acreage seeded in San Fernando valley
yields a fair crop, of which there is
now no reason for doubt, we shall har
vest wheat enough next year to sup
ply the home market with flour. Our
advices are that many thousands of
acres in this county will be set out iv
young trees and vines between now
aud the Ist of .March. The valley is
rapidly lilting with people and pros
perity reigns everywhere.
Here is an item which steady
drinkers should read and temperance
organizations use as an argument why
all men having policies of their lives
should be tetotlers: The Connecticut
Mutual Life Insurance Company re
sisted the payment of a policy on the
greunrt that the insured had
violated his agreement by the
excessive use of liquor, and
thereby assisted himsdf out of
the world. It was in evideuce that
the deceased had drank brandy at the
rate of a bottle and a half a day, be
sides large amounts of wine and other
light drinks. It was a strong case for
the company but by way of encour
agement to moderate drinkers and to
give the facts we must state that the
jury found for the plaintiff, and the
company found itself out aud injured.
Tiie Council did not show a strong
disposition to consider the petition to
leave the railroad depot where it is at
present located. The petition was re
ceived and placed on file without dis
cussion. We can see "no reason for
changing the opinion expressed in the
Herald of yesterday morning that it
would be just as well to move the
depot as per agreement between the
Council and the railroad representa
tives some weeks ago. Nothing is
clearer than that a new location must
be selected at an early day, aud as
that location has been agreed upon
and the railroad company have com
menced work on their new buildings,
why discontinue an improvement
which, though it may not be abso
lutely necessary at this time, all ad
mit that the timo is near at hand
when the demands of commerce will
render the change imperative.
The farmers built the Salinas and
Monterey Railroad. They placed their
shoulders to the wheel and all worked
together. They did not find it such a
hard or" difficult job wheu all were
united and determined to push the
work to completion. The people of
Los Angeles and San Bernardino
counties should profit by the example
of the Monterey farmers. The build
ing of the Los Angeles and Independ
ence Railroad will not be as great or
difficult an undertaking for the people
directly interested as was the Salinas
and Monterey road for the little band
of sturdy Grangers who built it. The
necessity for our road is a hundred
times greater than theirs and the value
of our road will be a hundred
times greater than theirs. Our people
can build the much needed riad. All
that is required is unity of action and
a determination to push tho work
along.
Jest while we are reading in the
President's Message that a better
sUte of feeling exists in the South
and that hostilities between the white
and colored people of that distressed
region appear to have closed, the tele
graph flashes the news that trouble
exists between the races at Vieksburg
and in a fight twenty negroes were
killed. This sort of thing is unpleas
ant to read, but we shall have such
paragraphs until tlie colored people
learn to regard the Southern people—
their old masters_ as their truest and
best friends. It is stated that in some
portions of tlie South societies and or
ganizations composed of colored men
are breaking away from the influence
of the carpet-bagger and are seeking
advice aud friends among those who
were once their masters and owners.
This Is a sensible move. The carpet
bagger is an adventurer, and he cares
not what difficulties and privations
he imposes on the negro, so he secures
office and self-aggHUulUemenL The
native Southerner 1* the coloevd tuan'a
truest friend after wll, and'stan l l«y
them when tho Northern office-seek*
ing adventitfcr will leave them to bo
shutdown in riots he himself incites.
The President's Message.
The President's Message of which
the readers of the Hfratt> were pre
sented with the main features yc-ter
day morning, is a shorter though
much more sensible document than
thepresentChief Executive ha'syet laid
before Congress. Tlie views on tne
taxation question are in accordance
with the opinions expressed by the
Secretary of Treasury. J'ln* opin
ion that (he revenue will have to be
increased will not meet with general
lavor. Increased revenue means in
creased taxation, and the people ore
long weary of that load. On the
whole, the niessafce Isasensihle paper,
containing many sound suggestion*.,
on the national finance problem, and
the proposed return to specie pay
ment. The President appears to have
all at once realized the fact that the
great majority of the Chinese who
come t© this country are not free
agents coming of their own accord,
but slaves, coolies, brought here by
their owners and used as slaves. This
fact has long been known to the peo
ple of California, and we are pleased
to know that it has finally reached
the .President. That part of the mes
sage which deprecates the custom of
coercing negro voters in the South
by capitalists is very well so far as it
goes, but the President should not
havo stopped where he did on this
subject. He should have deprecated
aud called on Congress to put a stop
to the liabit of Federal oflicers of co
ercing not only the colored voters of
the South, but thousands of white
voters in tlie North. He should have
lokl how Government uavy yards
were stocked with men who could not
hold their situation a moment after
refusing to vote the Administration
ticket, and how every employee in a
Federal office is coerced out of his
vole. But Grant has sent out a sen
sible message—an unusually sensible
one for him.
An Act of Cruelty.
Philosopher Pickett is still in dur
ance vile. His ofl'ense was contempt
of court, and the man who ordered
him to prison was Justice Wallace.
This man Pickett, whom every resi
dent of San Francisco and nearly
every old resident of the State knows
personally or by reputation as " Phi
losopher Pickett," is an eccentric
man—so eccentric that one is almost
justified in the conclusion that his
mind is a little off balance at times.
He is a man of more than average
talent and of good heart and kindly
disposition. He has no enemies ex
cept Justice Wallace, and he has
many friends. One day his irregu
larly constructed mind prompted him
to assume the seat of Justice Crock
ett and maintain his right to hold it,
until he was forcibly ejected by the
officers. For this he was sent to
prison, aud for this he still remains in
prison. Judge Ckockett is a good
and humane man, and it is strange he
does not intercede for Pickett's re
lease. It would be a generous thing
for him to do. The majesty of the law
has been vindicated, and certainly the
dignity of the Judge ought to be satis
tied with the long imprisonment of a
man whose eccentricities havo long
marked him as one of strange, almost
unsound, mind. As for Mr. Justice
Wallace, there is nothing to be said
except that should he ever again ask
the people to give him an otlice, his
cruel and relentless treatment-of poor
Pickett will bo remembered against
him to his disgrace and discomfiture.
THE MERCED TRAGEDY.
Attempt to l.j mil tUe ."Murderer, but
He Escapes -Tlie Mob Become Fran
tic nnd Sack tne "Argns" Office.
Mekced (Cal.), December Bth. -The
town is all excitement, in consequence
of the shooting of Edward Madden,
editor of the Tribune, by Harry Gran
ice, yesterday. Last night crowds
gathered on the street, who meant to
deal summarily with the murderer,
but the Sheriff, anticipating the con
dition of affairs, had removed the
prisoner to Hoffman's Ranch, one
mile from town, in charge of two res
ponsible sub-officers. The people
found out that the prisoner had uuen
removed. About 9 o'clock informa
tion reached them as to his where
abouts. The mob mounted on mus
tangs, went out tohisplace of conceal
ment and demanded him of the
officers. One of the officers was in
bed with him and had him handcuffed,
one of the cuffs being placed upon his
own person, to guard against any
possible escape. The two got out of
bed and ran out of doors into the night.
It seems that the prisoner here made
his escape. Reports tire numerous as
to how ho made his escape. All the
officer*! are now in search. The town
is full of parties who have come from
abroad to learn the particulars of the
tragedy.
Last night the mother of the de
ceased arrived, and the remains were
taken to Stockton to-day, where they
will be interred iv the family lot. A
great many accompanied the cortege
from here.
The crowd went and broke into the
jail after the prisoner had been re
moved. They then went to the Argue
office and upset things generally, iho
office looks like a wreck this morning.
It seems that Steele made a bill of sale
of the property to Wigginton, the
banker here, who held a mortgage of
$2,500 on it at the time of the affray.
Madden was universally esteemed.
He was unarmed. Granice is the step
sou of Steele, the editor of the Ai-'/h--,
he is young and of little account. He
was instigated by Steele, no doubt.
The citizens waited on Steele last nigh t
and gavo him twenty-fours hours to
get out of town. He left immediately.

Washington, December 7th.— The
report of the Secretary ofthe Treasury
recapitulates the transactions sttena
ing the refunding of the debt, Suc
cessful bidders have taken up nil the
bids and hold options for the rest
until February Ist. Tbe Sinking
Fund isover92ojOOr/,OW) behind.
The Secretary not only takes strong
groundsill favor of specie payment,
hut sets forth :i definite plan tor reach
ing the same. He recommends the
repeal of the Legal Teixltr Act itt I
fixed day. Al to OUttttacts thereafter
made, aiid except an ihe ollleial sala
ries and ordinary expenditures of the
Government under existing appropri
ations, the .Secretary rooem mendsthai
authority be given for the immediate
Issue of convertible bonds bearing a
low rale of interest. n v asks that a
lay may be fixed for the resumption
of. specie payment not more remote
than three years; at the end of that
time the Secretary to be autlrorized to
raise gold by selling back bonds to
such nninimi i rts may hecome neces
sary from time to time to keep the
treasury in a condition to redeem
greenbacks rts presented. It is recom
mended that fractional currency be
replaced by silver, and to accomplish
this the'SeTfotiiry' dtsired to set al!
tho Mints at v/ork coining silver, antl
that, as rapidly as produced, tlie frac
tional Currency be called In and de
stroyed, beginning with the smallest
denominations. The Secretary also
asks that the coinage of gold be made
free in the United States as it is in
Loudon, iv order to prevent the expor
tation of bullion for coinage. In re
gard to printing nil varieties of (iov
ernment notes, bonds and stamps, the
Secretary recommends that the whole
he done exeht-ively at the Treasury
I leparUncnt. The Government lias
all the necessary machinery, obtained
at a gi cat cost, and all the necessary
facilities. It can perform the work
at the same, or at less cost than pri
vate tirms, when the cost of transpor
tation by express is considered. Aside
from these minor considerations the
Secretary regards the question of
safety as one of great importance. The
Government should control the busi
ness at the end of the present con
tracts, or as soon as they can be legal
ly terminated. lie recommends that
all the worn of this nature be •per
formed in tbe printing division of the
Treasury. The Secretary recommends
free banks as a part of the plan for tlie
resumption of specie payment, and
this branch of the sdbjecl is much
elaborated. Concerning internal rev
enue the Secretary recommends that
the tax be taken oil' of bank checks,
watches, cosmetics and drugs; and to
meet tiiis loss, an additional tax of ten
cents per gallon lie imposed on whis
ky. This will raise the revenue a lit
tle greater than is now reaii/.ed from
the articles enumerated.
The practical workings of putting
tea and coii'eo on tlie free list have
been fully examined by the Treasury
Department. Carefully prepared ta
bles of the prices in foreign markets
and tiie prices to consumers for a pe
riod subsequent to the taking off of
the tax show that while the country
lost from ?fi,000,000 to ?12,000,000 from
the decrease of revenue on account of
tbe removal of the tax, it is simply
add (1 to tho price in foreign markets
and has not benefited consumers here
in the least. He recommends the res
toration of this tax.
The attention of Congress is called
to the great danger to the revenue
attending all attempts to modify the
penalties which have heretofore exist
ed and which the Treasury has sought
to enforce. The Secretary is no believer
in the system of moities, and does not
desire its restoration in any shape, but
he expresses serious doubts Whether
any benefit has followed certain mod
ifications of penalties for the violation
of custom regulations.
Tlie Secretary does not regard tho
Treasury Department as a proper
place for the adjudication of cotton
cases. They are for the most part of a
complicated character, and require the
taking of much evidence and a judicial
investigation. He therefore'recom
mends that all cotton cases be with
drawn from the jurisdiction of the
Treasury nnd turned over to the
Courts.
Till: TAKIIT AKD I'UM.IC BUILDINGS.
Upon the question of tariff the Sce
ivtary, Without entering upon much
discussion, says at present it is only
necessary to treat it purely as a ques
tion of revenue, and not one either of
protection or free trade. In the inter
est of business he does not think any
changes should lie hastily made, and
if Congress desires to revise the present
rates, he recommends that a Commis
sion be appointed to take the whole
subject into consideration, with in
structions to report to the next Con
gress.
Great economy is recommended in
the expenditures for public buildings.
The Secretary recommends that Con
gress go over the appropriations and
estimate? for these works with great
care, with a view of reducing some
and wholly suspending others. He
expresses the belief that the needs of
the Government do not require such
elaborate and costly structures as have
of late been erected, but that plainer
and at the same time subsiantial
buildings will answer every purpose
and save many millions. He thinks
there is needless extravagance iv fur
nishing public buildings, and that
much greater economy should be prac
ticed in all directions. In this mutter
he has transmitted the estimates which
have been already carefully revised,
but he earnestly requests Congress to
unite with him in scanning them still
more closely, with a view to their fur
ther reduction.
lowest limit op economy.
The force of the Department has
been reorganized and diminished ex
actly in accordance with tlie laws and
appropriations of last session, but the
Secretary thinks the lowest limit of
economy consistent with a prompt and
efficient performance of public busi
ness has not yet been reached. As to
all plans for increasing the public in
debtedness by aiding private enter
prises of any kind, tlie Secretary does
not believe the present condition of
the Government justifies extending
aid in any form.

Another Account.
VICKSBtTRO, December 7th.—ln the
engagement to-day with the negroes
twenty were killed, twenty wounded
and thirty to forty prisoners. Oliver
Brown, a white man of Snyder's Bluff,
was killed. The origin of the trouble
is a dispute that has been going on
lately between the Taxpayers' Associ
ation and the city and county officers.
The Sheriff was acting without a bond
and the Board of Supervisors refused
to order a new one. Several officials
being under indictment and the citi
zens despairing of relief, last Wednes
day in a body proceeded to the court
house to demand the resignation of a
number of the county officials, who all
lied except the Sheriff; Crosby, a ne
gro, who resigned on Saturday. In a
card, slgrted "Crosby," he called on
the Republicans of Warren county to
support him. He denied the author
ship of the card. This morning the
negroes advanced on the town by six
roads, with the results already stated.
They numbered about 750. Several of
the captured negroes havo stated to
reporters that they were ordered by
Sheriff Crosby to come to the city.
Negroes are raiding in the county.
Resolutions were adopted at a meeting
of citizens this evening recommending
the citizens to refrain from violence
against Crosby and merely attempt to
remove him from office legally.
