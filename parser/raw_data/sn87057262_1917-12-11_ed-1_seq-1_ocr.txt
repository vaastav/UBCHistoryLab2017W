LONDON, Dec. 11.—Violent denun
ciation and charges of terrorism were
made against the Cossack rebels by
the Bolshevlki today. Proclamations
issued at Petrograd and reported in
dispatches here, declared the Cos
socks had mounted guns on top of
houses at Rostoif "for the purpose of
terrifying tlfe population."
Trotsky charged that General Dut
off, of the triumvirate of Cossack gen
erals including Korniloff and Kaledine
was "committing acts of violence and
oppression in the Ural section."
At Moscow it was reported there
were grave fears of an outbreak—pre
sumably open revolt against the Bol
shevikl. Moscow is the stronghold of
Cossack strength and an attempt to
throw off the Trotsky-Lenine yoke

however, were reported to have mutin

There was evidence today that the
Bolshevlki government is beginning to
get panic stricken over the gradual
grip which the Cossacks are acquiring
over Russia's great stores and her rail
roads. They forsee isolation of Petro

continues.

STOCKHOLM. Dec. 11.—Fighting
in the streets of Moscow between

to advices from Haparanda today.
The Swedish consul general at
