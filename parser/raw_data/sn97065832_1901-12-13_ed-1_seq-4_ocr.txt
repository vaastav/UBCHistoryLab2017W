r^Well, we want, just as a matter
of form, to hear from the court of
inquiry in the Schley investigation.
We have heard from the people
already.
Another English naval vessel
has gone to the bottom. If the
bloomin' Britishers can't keep
their tubs afloat on an ordinary
cruise what would become of them
if a manlike Schley got after them?
Who says trusts are unkind?
One of them is going to sell coal
to the Germans for a dollar and a
half a ton less than we have to pay.
Of course this is just because the
people over there can't afford to go
any higher.
The people of Buffalo seem to
be determined to pay the bill rath
er than to have any further talk
about it, and it speaks volumes
for -the people of Buffalo that they
are able to pay it, although the
Fan-American failed to pan.
Wiien were you out to church
service last? Stop and think the
matter over. If you are not a re
gular attendant, go next Sunday.
Maybe it'll seem hard to do it, but
go—go anyway. It'll do you no
harm, may do you some good, and
you'll fell better for having attend
ttd. Never mind the clothes you
wear, you'll be made welcome.
Go to church next Sunday.
Well, Teddy Roosevelt isn't it
so slow if he really means what he
says about government aid in irri
gating the arid west. But he
.would havts shown good judg
ment by recommending the stop
ping of such leaks 'in the treasury
as are caused by the Philippine
fiasco and other colonial ventures,
and using the money for the pro­
motion of some such beneficial
plan as his irrigation scheme. Our
Philippine expense account for
one year would construct a string
of reservoirs that would suprise
It's easy—this being an editor.
Only last week THE UNION'had an
offer from some sort of a bureau
down in Washington to furnish as
all our editorial matter for ten
cents per week! Think of getting
brains at ten cents per week!—A
sort of a free coinage of opinions
for so small a sum. Thanks 1—
THE UNION turned the generous
o2er down. When we can't edit
our paper we will get out of the
business.However, some of the
boyS right here in the Hills bit at
the bait and are using this "can
ned goods'' as orginal.
No kind reader, THE UNION has
not "renounced Bryanism,"as one
suspicious reformer judged from
our leading, editorial of last week.
But as heretofote, THE, UNION does
not believe in attempting an im
possibility by making the cam
peiga cry ol 1904 "imperialism and
Philippine independence." There
are real i#Sttes lo"tie to, real eviels
to eorribat and live questions to
champion^ Imperialism is not one

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's message
to congress takes its place among
the historic documents of the
nation as one of the longest of its
kind. In some ways it is an able
and commendable paper, and in
others it is not. It lacks the ag
gressiveness and fearlessness of
its author, and in this regard failed
to meet the expectations and hopes
of many. It indirectly favors the
ship subsidy steal, though it does
not openly advocate the passage of
that piece of proposed legislation.
It is framed with an eye to a "good
Lord and good devil" policy on the
trust question, in that it opposes
meddling wifh or altering the
present high tariff law—the ack
nowledged breeder of trusts and
combines.
President Roosevelt's ideas look
ing to the crushing out of anarchy
and giving the federal courts juris
diction in cases of assassination or
attempted murder of federal of
ficials is commendable and will
meet with the hearty endorsement
of every lover of law and order.
On the question of trusts the
president advises the "utmost
caution" in legislation, with no
specific recommendation to con
gress as to what should be done to
protect the masses from trust ex
tortion. Yet he favors govern
mental supervision and control of
great corporations "within reason­
able limits." He fails to suggest
the "limits" and leaves the prob
lem as nearly unsolved as it was
before he discussed it. The tariff,
which breeds trusts and fosters
them in their robbery, he declares
should be left alone, as any change
would be '-unwise." There is lit
tle satisfaction or hope for relief in
this section of his message.
If made in sincerty and the hon­
est cooperation of congress can
be secured, his recommendation of
government construction of reser
voirs and main ditches with a view
to irrigating the arid lands of the
west is most commendable.
Whether or not it is a bid foi
western support in 1904 time will
tell, but THE UNION heartily hopes
that it is made in all sincerity and
that something substantial will be
dpne* in the matter. Millions of
acres which today are vast wastes
could be reclaimed throught irriga
tion and made to blossom as the
rose. Houses would dot the hills
and valleys of the west where to
day are found few evidences of
twentieth century civilization.
The president's?! recommen
dations regarding the construction
of the Nicarauguani caaal, the sus
taining of the time-honored Mori
roe doctrine and the laying of a
trans-Pacific cable are commend
able aad will meet with hearty
support of democrats and republi
cans alike~in congress. They are
truly American measures.
His view as to the closer
1
and
more rigid restriction of undesir
able immigration, as well as his
favoring the .ra-eattctment of the
Chinese exclusion law, are worthy
the support of the official repre
sentatives of both political parties.
He does not declare point blank
for the proposed ship subsidy
steal, but "favors the upbiidingr of
thd American merchant marine."
The fault with the subsidy bill has
been that this "tip-building of the
merchant marine'' at government
Wpense as proposed by Senator
Hanna, would simply be a gift of
millions of the peoples money each
j/sar to the shipping trust,of which

chairtablc enough to give this
trust—the most gigantic and far
reaching of its kind in the world
millions of dollars annually to "en
courage" it.
The president's recommennation
as to doing all possible to keep in
toxicants from the aborigines in
this country and calling upon other
nations for co-operation along the
same line abroad, is a proper posi
tion. Yet he might have properly
gone a [step further and included
other classes of our population.
An Indian is bad enough at best,
but let him get hold of a jug of
whiskey and he's—well you khow!
In many ways President Roose
velt's message is a commendable
one, but on live issues like trusts
and the policy which forms their
basis and furnishes them their
protection it is somewhat disap
pointing, when one stops to con
sider the characteristics which
