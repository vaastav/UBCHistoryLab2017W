London*, Dec. 3.— The correspondent nf
the 'limes telegraphs as follows from ili
rosbima, Japan: 1 have just returned
from the seat of war and had a conversa
tion with Viscount Alussa Muneruitau, the
Foreign Minister, in regard to the mis'on
duct of the Japanese at Port Arthur. 1
Inlormed him that I had watched the Jap
nneese array enter that town. The Chi

terminate them. The Japanese were fur- j
tber excited by fioiiing the mutilated re
mains of the Japanese prisoners. Some
of these prisoners had been burned alive.
1 saw no resis'ance in the town during the
next four days. The Japan#se pillaged j
the whole town and killed almost every i
man. Vecf few women or children were !
killed. Those who were killed were prob- i
ably killed unintentionally. I saw scores of
Chinese prisoners pinioned, stripped and
shot, hacked with knives, ripped open,
disemboweled and dismembered. Many
were partially buried.
The foreign Miuister expressed himself
ns intensely surprised and grieved.
Hitherto, be brideci, the Japanese army
had been admired for in bumauity and
discipline. He was unwilling to believe
it possibla that they acted as reported, or
to expr*fl:i an opinion on the sul>jec;, until
b detailed ofliclal rf-port arrived. Mean
while he airhi.rized n.e fen say that he was
certain the Government was sincerely de
termined to «ct on principles of humanity
and civilization, and was firmly resolved
to maintain the honor of Japan and refute
Chinese .-landers. lam satisfied the Gov
ernment desires nei'her to conceal the
trurh nor to permit slanders.
A Chefoo dispatch to the Times says:
It is rep rtrd that the Japanese fleet is de

lie is a brave and nompp'ent officer, and
i* assisted by several foreigners. The
Chinese people fear that if peace is made
the disbanded trcops will commit outrages.
In a few days' time all traffic north will
close. The Japanese will have to act
quickly if they intend to attack Peking.
The last reliable reports received in Che
foo state that Japan has informed the
American Minister that ahe. is willing to
negotiate if China sues for peace. This
China has done, so an armistice is likely
to be arranged.
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.
Steps Were Taken Some Time Ago
to Protect Americans.
Washing mon, Dec. 2.— lt is stated
positively at thn department of State that
there Is no fresh reason for apprehension
touching tbe safety of American residents
of Peking, and that United States Minister
Denby has not rnado any appeal to the
department for protection since his origi
nal dispatch sent some time ago and re
ferred to at the time in the Associated
Press dispatches, in which he stated that
sbonld the Japanese troops attack Peking
the safety of the foreign residents might
be threatened and it would be well to send
a force of United States marines to protect
the legation. As is customary in such
cases this dispatch was promptly com
municated to the Isavy Department and
fifty marines were ordered to be trans
ferred from the other vessels of the
American fleet to the Monocacy at Tien
tsin, near by Peking.
Id addition Admiral Carpenter was in
structed to put himself in communication
with Minister Denby and to use his
discretion in doing everything necessary
to ensure tbe safety of the American
residents. All nf this took plnco some
*.ime ago, and since then Mr. Denby has
juade no further application for protec
tion. He is at liberty any time to trans
fer bis legation to Tien-tsio, where it
would be almost under the guns of the
Monocacy, anil in fact he was authorized
to d" this at a very early stase in the
war, when the Chinese showed symptoms
\I disaffection at the first reverses sus
tained by their armies. The legation
would certainly be much safer at Tien

t»in than at Peking, as it is impossible for
even the light-draft Monocacy to navi
i gate the river up to the latter cily at this
season of tbe year. But the fact that Mr.
Denbv, although the means of cnmmuni
! cation are open, has not recently asked for
' aid from the department, is regarded as
* vidence that he feels no apprehension at
I'ivsent, and this view is supported by the
cable advices from Chee Foo to the
tflect that, encouraged by the prospect of
a restoration of peace, many of the foreign
residents of Pektu who had taken refuge
; at Tieo-taio were returning to Peking.

PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.
Another Proposition to Be Trans
mitted to Minister Denby.
Tokio, Dec. 2. — I'eace negotiations are
proceeding. The Minister of Foreign Af
fairs lias handed to United States Minister
Duun a counter proposition for transmis
sion to United States Minister Denby.
Owing tv the secrecy surrounding the
\ negotiations it Is impossible at this stage
>to discover tbe exact nature of this
j counter proposition, but it is supposed
I to differ from Minister Denr>y's
original proposition mainly ia respect to
the amount of the Indemnity asked by
Japan and in the addition of cettaiu oner
; ons guarantees for tne faithful execution
iof China's pledge. It Is rumored that one
| of these guarantees is the continuation of
i the Japanese occupation of Port Arthur
until the treaty conditions are fulfilled,
but it is apprehended such a demand may
involve Great Britain, to wbich nation
suet, occupation would be obnoxious.
London-, Dec. 3.— A dispatch from Ber
lin states that China has accepted the
English offer of a 4% per cent loan of
£1.200,000.
TO STAND OFF RUSSIA.
Cause of England's Haste to Sign
the Japanese Treaty.
Tacoma, Wash.. Dec 2.— ln an inter
view in tii. Ledger Capiain John Panton,
R. N. R., master of the Victoria, says it is
current gossip and generally believed on
"the othfcr side" that England had a deep
object in hastening to 6ign a treaty with
Japan several mouths ago, after Japan
had won several victories. The supposed
object was to form an alliance with the
power likely to control the Korean situa
tion io order to prevent Russia Irom Rain
ing power in the strategic quartet of the
globe— strategic particularly from Russia's
point of view, since her chief Siberian
port, Vladivostok, is blockaded with ice
half the year. By remaining friendly
with Japan it is fully bplieved that Eng
land will keep the Czar out of Korea.
Many people in the Orient are beginning
to think, Captain Panton says, that China
has adopted and is now nutting into prac
tice the advlcb given to Viceroy Li Hung
Chang by General Gordon of the British
army, after the Taiping rebellion. His
advice was that if an enemy ever invaded
China to retreat, retreat, retreat, until the
enemy's troops wer« well ia the interior,
and then to turn the Chinese hordes upon
them and annihilate tnem. Captain Pan
ton says: "The result of this war is hard
to forecast. If it is true that the Chinese
are carrying out Gordon's advice, which
seems quite probable, they will yet swamp
the Japanese; yet if the Chinese allow
such places as Port Arthur to be taken one
cannot tell what to expect. Port Arthur
was a Gibraltar. It had new guns from
Europe only a few months ago, and was
supposed to be impregnable. It looks as
ir the Chinese mandarins and taotais
wanted to throw the Manchurian dynasty,
and were playing into Japan's hands.
Everybody in the Orient is disgusted with
the. way things are going in China and the
rotten state that that country is in. It is
common gossip that the mandarins and
taotais draw money in large sums from
the Government for ammunition, shot and
shell, and to maintain their tronps, and
that they snand most of the money for
themselves or board it for future use. It
is the, most rotten state of affairs that was
ever seen in any country in the world.
"Anybody who has a 'pult' with a man
darin can get a position ol some kind For
instauce a farmer with a pull may be put
in as captain of a vessel in the navy. This
condition of things permeates China
through and through. Over there it is
called the "mandarin squeeze." That
term applies to what would be calleJ a
•rake off' in this country. Large contracts
for Government supplies are let, it j B
understood, with th» understanding that
the offloials get a good percentage of the
contract price from the contractors.
Sometimes the supplies are not purchased
or in very small quantities.
"It seems to be-pratty well settled that
the Chinese had used ud all their powder
and ammunition when the fighting bad
finished at tha battle of Yalu River. It
China's fleet bad plenty of ammunition, It

should have sunk the whole Japanese
fleet unless the Japanese ran away. The
Japanese were wiliing to quit fighting, not
knowing the Chinese were out of powder
and shell. Had they known it then they
might have demolished the Chinese fleet.
No, l don't think Li Huug Chang is in the
scheme to overthrow the Government, if
one exists. He has been handicapped by
China's conservatism and apathy to mod
ern improvements and modern ways of
fighting."
SENTENCE REMITTED.
General Swain Will Now Go on the
Retired List.
Wasuingtox. Dec. 2.— By i.direction of
the President, Secretary Laruont to-day
made an order remlttinc; the unexpired
sentence of Brigadier-Genera! David 0.
Swain, Judge A<ivocate-General of the
army, and directing him to take station ia
Washington City, awaiting further orders
from the department. It is understood
General Swain will take a leave of ab
sence and will be placed on the retired list
December '12 next, when he will nave
reached the ase of 62 years.
In the latter part of 1884 charges were
brought against General bwaim by A. F.
Bateman, a stockbroker with whom the
gentleman had had dealings. Bateman
had borrowed money from General Swaim
and given his note for the amount. Later
he claimed the debt bad been wiped out
by certain stock transactions. General
Swaim denied this and transferred the
note to a third p irty, who was asked to
bring suit on it. This man brought the
case to the attention of the Secretary of
the Nuvy, who declared a court-martial,
which found the general guilty of conduct
unbecoming an officer and sentenced him
to t-Uspeusion from rank and pay for one
year. President Arthur refused to accept
this sentem-e and returned the report to
the court, when they made it more severe
and resubtuitted it. Three times it was
returned to them by the President, and
finally the court sentenced General Swaim
to suspension on half pay for twelve years.
SHREWD DR. FLOWER
Worked Many Big Schemes Be
fore His Arrest.
Taken to Chicago to Answer a
Charge of selling Much
Worthless Stock.
Chicago. Dec. 2.— R. C. Flower, ex
preacher, Christian scientist find land
speculator, was brought to Chicago to-day
from Texas, where he was arrested last
week, and locked up in the County Jail
charged, in conjunction with I'resideut
Smith, with obtaining $45,000 by false
pretenses. Detectives who have been on
his trail, following him from Maine to
Texas, say he is the smartest iu;m lucy
ever encountered. They hase traced his
history and say he is tha head of a medi
cal institute having its headquarters at ob\)
Colambus avenue, .Boston, where it is
claimed he practices Christian science.
He lives when at home in a palatial resi
dence on Commonwealth avenue in that
city.
Dr. Flower, as he is called, was arrested
Saturday night in East St. Louis. A de
tective was on his way to Gaiveston, Tex.,
with requisition papers for him when the
two met aud the doctor was arrested.
Flower Dad waived requisition in Galves
too and ottered to accompany an officer to
Chicago, but be was disagreeably sur
prised in £ast St. Louis when the man
from Chicago appeared. Flower had in
bis possession tickets for himself and wife
for Indianapolis, and was on the train for
that city wheu taken. General Manager
Sutherland of tbe Moouey and iiolaud
Agency says his dealings with Foster are
typical of the sort of business he has beeu
conductive for tbe past few years. It is
claimed Flower and Paschal It. Smith,
who assisted him in his ventures, met N.
C. Foster, a Wisconsin lumberman, in
Clrcago July 8, 1893, in connection with a
land deal.
If Flower's case comes to trial the at
tempt will be made to prove that the doc
tor then represented to Foster that the
Deming Land and Water Company
owned 1500 acres of land in and near Dem
ing, N. Mex., valuable franchises for irri
gation privileges and an artesian well, all
of which was, worth more than the capital
stock of the company— $700, 000. The
stock was represented by Flower and
Smith to have been fully paid up. and tlie
claim is made that they induced Foster to
pay them $45,000 on a contract upon
wbich they agreed to give Foster one
third of the common stock, one-third of
the preferred stock and one-third of the
bonds of the company. Foster is said to
have found the property to be worthless.
It is claimed Flower represented that he
owned 9000 acres of land in Virginia that
be would give Foster for his interest in
the Deming Land and Water Company.
Foster paid S3OOO or more ou the strength
of the abstracts, but it is said a subsequent
examination of the records in Virginia
showed the abstracts to be false. Foster
then communicated again with Flower,
who gave him an abstract of 12,000 acres
of land in Kentucky, which, liKe the V r
ginia paper, proved to be false.
Many other stories are told of alleged
sharp practice on Flower's part whereby
be has gathered up large sums of money.
ENGLAND TAKES A HAND.
An Official Hearing of the Armenian
Outrages.
London, Dec. 3.— The Daily N«we this
morning says it is believed that Prime
Minister Rosebery is willing to grant an
official bearing to the Armenians iv Lon
don on the Sassoun sffair. A dispatch to
the Daily News from Constantinople says
it is reported that the E.»rl of Kimberly,
the British Foreign Minister, has made
strong representations to Rustom Pasha,
the Turkish Emba9sador to Great Britain,
on the contents of the Forte's circular,
and has insisted upon an honest Inquiry
being made into tbe outrages and the
necessity of belter government in Ar

TROUBLE IN SIGHT
All Will Not Be Serene in
Congress.
VIALS OF WRATH READY.
Will Undoubtedly Be Uncorked
on Grover's Head.
FINANCES TO START THE FUN.
But There May Be a Diversion in
the Impeachment of Judge
Ricks.
Washington, Deo. 2.— The second ses- j
sion of the fc'ifiy-ttiird Congress begins at
noon to-morrow. I3eycud the passing of
Use regular appropriation bills, it seems
probable little in the way of legislation
will be accomplished at the short session,
althoueh several important propositions
will doubtless be pressed to the front.
Among the members of the dominant
party in the House, over half of whom
were defeated fur re-election, is a great
deal of bitter feeling against the Adminis
tration for real or fancied grievances. It
will be the purpose of the Democratic
leaders to consider as far as possible the
display of resentment, but the Republicans
will spare no pains to provoke nnd goad
their defeated adversaries into letting
loose their vials of wrath.
If the President outlines a financial
scheme in his messaee to-morrow, as in an
ticipated, It will probably furnish the oppo
nents of his banking and financial views
their desired opportunity. In the course
of the session it is understood the Nica
ragua Canal project wiil be brought promi
nently forward. At the opening of the
Congress, however, routine matters will
ke kept to the fore to stave off as far as
possible unpleasant references to the elec
tion, which would prove distasteful to the
majority, but this policy can be only par
tially successful, an the latitude allowed in
debate upon bills will throw" the doors open
to remarus on any subject.
Before the adjourn ment for the holi
days it will be nece-sary to pass an ap
propriation to carry out the tariff bill
provision levyine a tax on incomes, the
collection of which begins January 1, and
while it will no doubt meet with much op
oosition and lead to a general review of
the arguments against such a tax, tl.-e
great impression is that it will pass by a
large majority.
The impeachment of Judge Ricks of the
Northern District of Ohio wiil also fur
nish a 'liver-i ii before the holidays if the
Judiciary Committee, which investigated
the charges, should present a resolution
of impeachment and it should carry. The
trial woa;d occur la ihe bt-u'ate, cue Chief
Justice presiding. Impeachment pro
ceedings are rare and novel, and this one,
the first since the trial of President
Johnson, would attract no little at
tention.
To-morrow, If a quorum Is present in
the House after the calling of the roll,
DOthing will be done, probably, beyond
the reading of the President's message.
No definite programme has been arranged
for the remainder of the week. The Com
mittee on Appropriations, however, has
two bills almost prepared— the pensions
and fortifications bills— and they will be
reported on Tuesday, so that work upon
them can be entered upon Wednesday.
The Senate will be called to order Mon
day at 12 noon, when the last session of
the fifty-third session of Congress wil^
begin. The Vice-President is in the city
and will preside. The session will begin
with a full calendar, the result of commit
tee action during the long session, and it
contains at least 200 item*, covering a wide
range of matters. Nothing has trans
pired to indicate which of the 200 Items
will receive first attention, whether they
will be taKen lv their order or whether
the calendar will be followed at all.
Much interest is felt among Senators of
all political beliefs in the President's mes
sage and in the recommendations which
the .Secretary of the Treasury will make on
finnncial questions. These wiil have much
to do in Girecting the course of the Sen
ate. If there are recommendations for
radical departures on financial methods
they are sure to lead to much Bp?ech-niak
ing early iv the session, and later to form
the basis of committee action.
Significance is also attached to Senator
Voorhees' declaration that he will ask the
Finance Committee to sit on Tuesday.
Tuesday is the day for the regular meet
ing of this committee, but it does not ordi
narily meet so promptly after the assem
bling of the Senate. Chairman Voorhees
declines to stnte the object of the meeting
further than to say it is being held for the
purpose of permitting an exchange of
views among the members. If the Presi
dent's message is received Monday the
executive recommendations conld of
course be taken up, but as there has been
no positive assurance as to when the mes
sage would come in when the meeting
was decided on it would appear the chair
man had other objects in view. It is pos
sible his purpose may be to arrange a
policy upon the supplemental tariff bills.
These bills have ali been reported by the
committee, but it may be considered neces
sary to discuss them further before decid
ing upon a plan of action.
The Democratic majority of the Finance
Committee is on record in favor of the
passage of the bills, and it Is not improb
able the early action of the committee is
sought to frustrate any attempt to prevent
consideration. This is not altogether sur
mise, for it is known that some of the so
called conservative Senators have advised
that a general party conference be held
after the Senate convenes for the con
sideration of this question. The expe
rience of the last session showed that
whenever caucussps wore held the con
servatives carried their points. Hence
there is reason for the prompt action of
the friends of the supplementary bills.
There appears to be nothing outside of
financial or tariff questions likely to excite
a ripple during the week, and it is not cer
tain that whatever may happen later in
the session there will be much in these
linen to disturb the general serenity of the
Senate during the next few days. After
the receipt of the President's message, and
when it gets to business, the Senate may
take up the calendar in regular order, or
it may proceed to consider out of order
some of the more important bills which
have been reported, such as those for the
admission of Arizona and Xew Mexico, or
the bankruptcy, anti-option or Nicaragua
bill.
In any event the daily sessions of the
week will be short, with the probabilities
strongly in favor of an adjournment from
Thursday to Monday of tbe week follow
ing. _.
THERE WILL BE A QUORUM.
Statesmen Rapidly Invading the
National Capital.
Washington, Dec. 2.— The hotel regis
ters show tiiai there will doubtless be a
quorum of members of both Houes in
their seats to listen to the Presidential
message to-morrow. During Saturday and
to-day Senators and Representatives have
been brought to the city on every train,
and to-night the hotel corridors are filled
with politicians, aud they talk of politics
as they have not done since last August.
McCREARY'S MEASURE.
He Will Modify His Bill for a Finan
cial Committee. ;
Washington, Dec. 2.— Representative
McCreary of Kentucky will modify to some
extent and reintroduca his bill for a finan
cial committee, which he presented at the
last session of Congress. The bill at
present provides for a commission to
examine into the depreciation of silver
and inquire if it is due to tbe apprecia
tion of gold. Mr. McCreary's modification
will provide that the committee shall make
a thorough examination of the currency
and the banks and banking system, the
commission to consist of three Senators,
three Representatives and three men to be
named by the President. The modification
he thinks will take the bill before the
Banking and Currency Committee, where
he may secure more favorable action than
before. ■
MR. MAQUIRE ON DECK.
Ready to Resume His Fight Against
the Funding Bill.
Washington, Dec. 2.— Representative
Maguire in on hand eager for the railroad
fi»nt to begin. He expresses great confi
dence that the funding bill will be beaten.
One of the measures that will receive his
earnest attention is the Nicaragua canal
bill. He says the West and South must
now unite on this as well as upon matters
of national finances.
FREE SHIPS NEEDED.
Argument of the Commissioner
of Navigation.
Mr. Chamberlain Says American
Enterprise Is a Century Ahead
of the Law.
Washington, Dec. 2.— The annua' re
port, ol the Coctraissionflr of Navigation,
Eugene F. Chamberlain, is mainly nn
argument for free ships, based on the
maritime standing and policies of tbe
United Mates ami other nations. He says
that the American enterprise is a century
ahead of the law, for Americans own
more stoamshiDs forbidden by tn» registry
law to wear American colors than they
own steamships in foreign trades under
the stars and striD»s, and that the admis
sion of such vessels to Ao»erican registry
is desirable to advance our maritime
rank. In thirty years only one American
steamship has once visited Hamburg, the
greatest Continental pen, and last year
only two sailing-vessels eutared there.
Every bushel of grain which left New
York for Europe last year was carried
under a foreign fi ig. Of 11.000 vessels
passing the Suez Canal in the last three
years only six had been American. Every
civilized nation but the United States
allows its citizens the use of the flag of
that nation over vessels in foreign trade
wherever bought, having learned that
otherwise they will buy vessels under
foreign flags, charter such vessels or
abandon navigation altogether to foreign
rival-).
Tbe report shows the extent to which
Americans have adopted these courses,
and the country's consequent loss of marl
time prestige and profit. Other nations,
according to tbe Commissioner, \ realize
that from the freedom of the seas a pro
hibitory registry law cannot act as a pro
tective tnnff for shipbuilding, so they
have abandoned it. Those undertaking
to promote ship-building resort to subsi
dies. Free registry and subsidies are not
conflicting: propositions, one encouraging
navigation, the other shipbuilding. The
report says only 3 per cent of the British
merchant marine receive any Government
compensation, and that discriminating
flag taxes have been abandoned by mari
time nations, as they Invite retaliation,
which nullifies prospective benefit*.
Amendments to the vet tonnage and
tonnage tax laws, the abolition of registry
bonds, and an extension of the power ot
the Secretary of the Treasury to mitigate
or remit penalties on sailing vessels are
recommended.

A VICTIM HIMSELF.
Duncan Not the Agent of the In-

Chicago, Dec. 2.— lt appears that Ed
gar W. Duncan of Salt Lake City was Dot
the attorney or agent of the Investment
Company at Dnbuque, lowa, but an ap
parent victim himself' to toe extent of
$650. The Humphreys, who arranged for
the loan on their property, got only $550
in cash, and the balance in stock of the
corporation. Mr. Duncan took the
warranty deed, in the ordinary course of
business, payine the face val ue for it, and
giving ii counter contract to return the
deed when the $1200 was repaid. When
he ascertained the Humphreys had not
received the whole sum advanced by him,
he withdrew the note from the National
Bank of the Republic, and assumed it
personally.

The report that there has been a conflict

LABOR'S FRIEND.
John Burns, M. P., Is in
New York.
_^— _
WELCOMED AT THE WHARF.
Union Leaders Warmly Greet
Him Upon .Arrival.
HIS MISSION IN THIS COUNTRY.
Will Observe the Condition of Wage-
Workers and Study Ameri
can Politics.
New York, Dec. 2.— Among the pas
sengers on the Cunard steamer Etruria,
which arrived here this morning;, was
Johu Burns, M. P., the great socialist and
labor leader of London. A delegation
from tne labor organizations of New
York City met him at quarantine. The
delegation consisted of E. F. McSweeney,
Assistant Commissioner of Labor; Samuel
Gomper9, president of the Federation of
Labor: Chris Evans, secretary of that
organization, and William O'Brien, the
walking-delegate.
Mr. Burns is accompanied by two
fellow-members of Parliament — David
Holmes, who represents the town of
Burkey, in Lancashire, and who is presi
dent of the Weavers' Association and a
John Burns, M. P.
delegate to the conference of the Federa
tion of Labor, and John William Benn,
member of the London County Council
and M. P. for St. George's East. Mr.
Benn is deeply interested la temperance
affairs.
"I cannot talk fairly of American af
fairs," said Mr. Burns to the Associated ,
Press reporter, "for it would take years
for me to become familiar enough with
them to do so. I have been watching the
labor movement in America as closely as
I could at a distance, and I have concluded
there must be a little more of the milk of
human kindness injected into labor affairs
if they are to progress as 1 would like to
see them progress."
On the dock were gathered about two
hundred members of the local labor unions,
who cheered loudly for "John Burnß" as
be walked down the gangplank. Then an
informal reception was tendered him, aud
Mr. Duoiar of Typographical Union No.
6 made a brief speech of welcome.
In responding Mr. Burns said it was an
agreeable coincidence that he, who had
been so strongly identified with the docks
in England, should make bis first speech
in America on a dock, with the rattle of
trucks and the swash of the waters in bis
ears.
The party proceeded on foot to the
Colonnade Hotel along West street. On
many of the corners were gathered groups
of dock-laborers and cattlemen, who
cheered for Burns as he approached, and
many of them, who had ome from Lnn
(lod, greeted him with the old cry of the
London dock strike, "How are you,
John P" to which inquiry Mr. Burns re
sponded by stopping and ehakiug hands
with them.
Later in the day Mr. Burns received a
number of newspaper men and talked for
an hour. After relating how Mr. Holmes
and he had been selected by the Labor
Federation at Norwich to represent that
body in the American conference at Den
ver, he said their duty was to convey the
felicitations of English labor to that of
America.
Of hii own visit he said be came first, to
observe the condition of the labor move
ment in America and in what respects it
differs from that in England; and second,
as a member of Parliament, to visit Con
gress and get a grasp of American politi
cal affairs.
The workings of the Labor Department
under Carroll D. Wright were of great in
terest to him, and as a co-councillor he
hoped to have the opportunity of inspect
ing the various municipal departments of
the great cities of America, particularly
New York aud Chicago.
But above all, he declared, it was for
trade unionism that be was to work. He
believed ultimately the principles' of the
trade union would be universally regarded
as necessary for carrying out any move
ment for buman progress.
Mr .Burns' attention was called to a
recently published statement that he bad
said American workmen were "no Defer
than African slaves."
"That statement," he replied, "is a
superstructure of misconstruction based
on a misunderstanding of what I said."
Then be explained that his remarks had
concerned the condition of the Hungarians
and Italians at the coke region as depicted
in cur blue books ;md which, if true, he
added, is a disgrace to any civilized
country on the face of the globe. Mr.
Burns will leave New York on Wednes
day and will spend six weeks traveling
throughout the States.

THEIR BOASTIN G CEASES.
The Taylors Not So Ready to Go
Back to Lynn County.
St. Joseph, Mo., Dec. 2— Sheriff Car
son received advices this afternoon from
Sheriff Barton of Lynn Couuty stating
that be would arrive here to-morrow and
take the Taylor brotheis, the alleged mur
derers of the Meeks family, back with him
for arraignment in the Lynn County
courts on Tuesday. When trie Taylors
were told that they were to be taken back
they became seriously alarmed, and ttie
elder brother expressed great fear that
they might meet violence. He also stated
that they would ask for a change of venue
at once, as they are satisfied they cannot
secure a fair trial at home. The brothers
6how a decided tendency to weaken now
that they know they will be taken back,
and the boasts they nave made all along
to the effect that they wantid to be tried
in Lynn County have fallen flat. The
Lynn County Sheriff will come with a
heavy guard and thinks he will have n>>
trouble to defend his prisoners. It is
though* the prisoners will be taken
secretly out of St. Joseph and go to Lynn
County in a roundabout way.

London. Dec. 2.— A St. Petersburg dis

provinces. It is expected all such prose
cutions will be dropped and the order for
the expulsion of German officials and
workmen from Russia will be rescinded.
SPLIT IN THE RANKS.
Populists Fail to Act on Kolb's
Inauguration.
The Extra Governor Did Not Consult
Any of His Party Leaders
and Caused Friction.
Montgomery, Ala.. Dec. 2.— ln spite
of her dual government Alabama has en
joyed a peaceful and quiet Sunday. Most
of the visitors, including the twenty-six
companies of State troops, left the city
soon after midnight last night.
The council of the Populist leaders, for
which a call was issued last week, was not
held. It has developed that there is a de
cided BDlit in the Populist ranks on the
inauguration move. It has leaked out that
the members of that party in the Legisla
ture were nnited against the inauguration
of Captain Kolb and did all in their power
to keep bis supporters away from the city
yesterday.
It is said Kolb determined upon bis
inauguration scheme without consulting
any of bis prty leaders, and that it has
unquestionably produced friction in the
ranks.
The Democratic leaders here believe
Kolb wants to put himself on record.
They believe hit scheme is to send a mes
sage to the Legislature demanding a fair
election-contest law. He will, as Gov
ernor, give Warren S. Reese a certificate
of election as Senator and will Usue simi
lar certificates to the four or five contest
ing Congressional candidates.
Governor Oates will sign the certificates
of (he gentlemen declared to be elected,
and Kolb hopes that the Republicans and
I'opulists in the House will settle the con
tests and thereby virtually recognize bis as
the proper credentials.
Another meeting of the Kolbites is called
for to-morrow. No one can tell at this
time what will be done after the message
is sent to the Legialatuie until the meeting
to-ruorrow determines.
