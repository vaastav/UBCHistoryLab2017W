MANY LEADING MEN TALK.
[The president's message, complete, as
read to con -Tress, will be found on the fifth
ud sixth pages.]
Washington, Dec. 4.— lt is not often
that the public awaits a president's
message with the intense interest which
has been manifested in the document
today sent to congress. The message
was listened to with close attention in
both houses, and the views of members
on the document are pertinent and in
teresting at this time.
Ex-Speaker Reed said: "I dislike to
comment on the message, because it
would not be seemly to do it in ade
quate terms. It is exceedingly disap
pointing, both in matter and manner. It
is largely made up of a wearisome res
ume of the reports of his secretaries,
which they have hardly improved by
condensation. On the Hawaiian ques
tion we are left as much in the dark as
ever, and must wait the news of the
next steamer just as we have been
waiting so long. The part of the
message which relates to the tariff
is most surprising. It asseverates
that the house committee in charge of
that subject has formulated plans and
devised methods of taxation which, as
a member of the committee, I have not
even heard proposed. It is a rather
unusual sensation to learn of the deeds
of the committee, not in the committee
room, but from the president of the
United States. Has that committee
ceased in form to be composed of both
parties, and has it, without even the
formality of a word in open committee,
informed
THE PRESIDENT
of its determination in such way that
the president eau officially communi
cate it to the house? How long has it
been part of our system that the com
mittee of au independent branch, and,
above all, the committee which con
trols the nurse, shall report to congress
through the president? Is this the re
sult of the rumored blending of the ap
pointive with the legislative power?
' "It is bad enough to have a tar
iff bill made up by a little coterie,
but to have it communicated to the
president before it reaches even the
committee, still less the house, shows a
determination to be moved by no facts
and modified by no arguments which
makes apparent the absurdity of ap
pointing Republicans on the committee
of ways and means at all."
Mr. Springer, of Illinois, chairman of
the last committee on ways and means,
and of the banking and currency com
mittee of the present congress, said:
"In reference to the tariff the message
is clear and forcible. In this the message
will receive the cordial commendation
of every Democrat in the land, and of
many others who realize that our pres
ent protective system is injurious to the
best interests of the people.
"In reference to the cuirency the
president very hopefully anticipates
that a survey of the situation after pub
lic confidence is restored will lead to a
permanently
. SOUND CURRENCY.
"This view of the subject excludes
definitely and forever the policy of a
return to the alluring and temporary
expedient of state banks of issue. The
president is evidently, opposed to the
repeal of the 10 per cent tax un the cir
culation of state banks.
"In reference to Hawaii, the presi
den taKes the only course which is con
sistent with international honor and
comity."
Mr. Holman, of Indiana, said: "It is
an able and forcible document. The
earnest expectations of economy con
trast strongly with the messages hereto
fore presented."
Mr. McCreary, of Kentucky (chairman
ofthe foreign affairs committee)— is
an able and appropriate document. It
furnishes much valuable information.
He presents our foreign affair--, monet
ary matters and the tariff with great
ability.and I think his recommendations
are generally good.
Mr. Oates. of Alabama — 1 listened
attentively. It abounds in details, and
is full of information about the depart
ments, but rcaites few rejcaimenda
tions.
Mr. Dolliver. of lowa— The message
Is iv most respects formal. In the mat
ters of public interest that are in dis
pute the message lacks any satisfactory
expression.
IN KESi'ECT TO HAWAII,
the president conceals from congress all
Information that it important, and seems
to know really less about the situation
than is known to the general public. As
to silver, the president lacks the courage
to state hi? view?, and commits the

the question ot, issuing bond 3 to main

lani; gives the majority of the ways and
means committee away on the income
tax. and agrees with Hancock that the
tariff is a local issue, and asks the peo
, pie not to kick.
MR. ISYXVM, OF INDIANA,
(a member of the ways and means com
mittee)—lt is a very concise, but clear,
statement of the multitude of questions
cengress will be called upon to consider.
The principal views presented meet my
unqualified approval. lam especially
pleased with the tariff question, and the
courageous maimer the president came
to the support of the committee, as
tariff reform could not be accomplished
without the support of the administra
tion.
Mr. Pickler. of South Dakota— The
assertion of the president that there are
great and gigantic frauds in connection
with the pension rolls and a large noni
ber of fraudulent pensioners upon the
rolls i is wholly unsubstantiated by
Mr.' Caldwell, of Ohio— Tbe presi
-1 dent indicates that every pensioner re
j ceived his pension by fraud, and defends
I his action in suspending pensions with
out giving the soldiers a hearing, by as
serting that it Is the French method.
He still maintains his un-American
policy regarding the restoration of
Queen Liliuokalani. His recommenda
tion of an income tax upon corpora
tions will not only decrease the wages
| of the workingmen, but increase the
cost of the product to the consumer.
Mr. Bouttlle, of Maine— li is the first
t executive document which directly im
pugned and charged malfeasance in
office, and practically treason, upon a
United States minister against whom
nothing was charged by the adminis
tration up to the time his resignation
was accepted. The people of London
may be aware of the policy which the
' ruler of the United States pursues and
his authority for making war, tearing
j down and putting up governments, but
we do and putting up governments, but
do not.
Mlt. PAYXIi. OP NEW YORK,
, Member ot the Ways and Moans Com
mittee—The message is a remarkably
disappointing document. It is mainly
devoted to a resume of the reports of
the several departments, to which the
president seldom adds an opinion of his
own. On important matters it gives us
little information. Un Hawaiian affairs
it gives us no information. His an
nouncement of the internal revenue
feature of the plans of the ways and
means committee is astounding. This
is the first information the minority
members have had that any conclusion
had been reached. If reports are cor
rect, the people of Loudon are in
formed on this important matter much
earlier than members of the committee.
The question now seems to be whether
all legislation must originate at- the
White house.
Mr. Dingley, of Maine— The mes
sage is voluminous in its resume of the
details of the work of the several de
partments and wearisome in its recapit
ulation of the smaller incidents of the
affairs; but on the one great foreign
question which congress, as well as the
country, ought to know the exact situa
tion, to wit: Our relations with Hawaii,
the message is as silent as the grave
beyond a repetition of the announce
ment made by Secretary Gresham. In
stead of some recommendation on the
currency question, we have simply
-delay' suggested as to silver, and
silence as. to the plau to restore the state
banking system and to provide for cur
rency wants in the future.
MR. DALZKLL,
of Pennsylvania (member of the ways
and means committee) — The president
says that "after a full discussion our
countrymen have spoken in favor of
tariff reform, and have considered the
work of the accomplishment to the
hands of those who are solemnly pledged
to it." I infer that by the latterlexpres
sion the presideut means the majority
of the ways and means committee, and
by '-tariff" reform" the proposed mongrel
bill given to the press a week ago. lt
would seem that the president has not
yet heard the news from Massachusetts,
"New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
When lie refers to the reduction of tariff
charges on the necessaries of life 1 sup
pose he has reference to champagne and
brandy. The fact that the president re
asserts the time-worn and so often, and,
under the operations of the McKinley
law, so emphatically disproven asser
tion that a protective tariff increases the
cost of goods to the consumer, shows
what a hide-bound theorist tlie president
Khat a hide-bound theorist the president
is, and how facts weigh nothing with a
tariff reformer. On the whole, he must
be a most devoted admirer or the presi
dent who can find in the message any
strengthening of the Democratic posi
tion on the tariff question.
Mr. Hepburn, of lowa, said: "The
i message is a business paper, devoted
i mainly to the. business of condensing
he statements and recommendations of
the secretaries. Necessarily it is tedious
and dreary. The discussion of the Ha
waiian policy is disappointing. He
favors tariff reform, but whether it is
tariff reform of the variety of 1888 or
1592 is left in doubt. Ido not think the
message will add to the president's
fame or harmonize the contentious in
bis party."
SENATOR VOORHEES— -
In the main the message is a sound,
strong document. 1 have not examined
it critically, and cannot go into details.
I think it vrUl be well received by the
country. BS^Sp
Senator McPherson— lt is excellent
all the way through. J was especially
pleased with the recommendations in
regard to the general finances and the
tariff and as to the principles involved
in the tariff ui''.
Senator Murphy— lt in a good mci-
Eftge.
Senator Palmer — The suggestions
arc generally in the line of Democratic
thought. The paragraph relating to
Hawaii merely showed the president's
intention to take the question up again.
I have no especial objection to what he
says regarding pensions, but I have an
idea that his impressions are wide of
the mark concerning fraudulent pen
sions. 1 don't know how it is among the
colored ex-soldiers of the South, but my
information leads me to believe that ie
the North not 2 per cent of the pensions
are fraudulent.
Senator Kyle— Tbere was nothing
striking in the message, though it'con
tained some good points. 1 was pleased
with his recommendations for an Income
tax, but what he said about Hawaii aud
bis recommendation concerning the Is
suance of bonds were not to my liking.

AMERICAN HOUSE OF LORDS FILLED
WITH FLOWERS.
AN AUSPICIOUS OPENING.
Entire Session of the Senate Oc
cupied by the Reading ef the
President's Message — Senator
Dolph Will Tail- on the Ha
waiian Qnestion Today—lnter
est in the Message.
Washington, Dec. 4.— The first sen
est in the Message.
'ashtxgton. Dec. 4.— The first sen
ate session of the Fifty-third congress
convened at high noon today, pursuant
to the constitutional provisions. "The
inaudible and noiseless foot of Time"
had apparently tripped lightly through
the lives of senators during the brief
vacation period, and brighter faces
greeted one another than when thirty
odd days ago, tired, and showing signs
of a parliamentary struggle unequaled
in the history of the government, the
representatives of the states left the
national capitol. All traces of that
memorable battle seemed effaced, and
the greeting amongst the senators bore
the evidence of warm traces of that
ie battle seemed effaced, aud
ing amongst the senators bore
nee of warm fraternal friend
ship and personal regard.
The umber presented a handsome
appearance, arrayed in Us winter ap
parel. A Brussels carpet, pleasing to
the eye and soft to the tojch, had sup
planted the light Chinese matting which j
covered the floor during the recent ex- j
traordinary session. Highly polished
desks and chairs awaited senatorial use, j
while the happy owners of sixteen smil
ing little faces sat on the steps on each
side of the vice president's rostum eager
to carry out the wishes of the senators.
On some of the desks were floral de
signs and flowers whose fragrance
sweetened the atmosphere and lent an
additional charm to the scene. On the
desk of the vice -president reposed a
basket of red roses, while a handsome
FI.OKAL HORSESHOE
awaited Senator Voorhees, the gift of
admiring Indiana friends who also re
membered his colleague. Senator Tur
pie. A large bunch of roses lay on the
desk of Senator Dolph and the doughty
champion of the white metal. Senator
Stewart, was the recipient of a basket of
beautiful Marechal Niels.
Senators Harris, Berry. Proctor,
Hansbrough and others were also fa
vored with flowers, Inthe galleries a
large crowd had gathered to witness
the opening of the session, and the
bright colors in the ladies' gowns and
bonnets were the more conspicuous be
cause of the somber-hued background.
As the massive clock over the main
entrance announced the hour of 12
o'clock the blind chaplain was led
up to the vice president's desk, and
after an eloquent prayer, while all
senators present" remained" standing.
Vice President Stevenson -called the
senate to oraer. At the suggestion of
j Senator Sherman the roll of the senate
was called, and fifty-six members re
sponded. The usual resolutions notify
ing the house of representatives of the
meeting of the senate, and the resolu
tion for a committee of two senators to
join a similar committee of the
house to wait upon the president
of the United States and iuform
him that congress had assembled
and was ready to receive any communi
cation he may desire to make, were of
fered aud agreed to. The chairman ap
pointed Mr. McPherson (Dem., N. J.)
and Mr. Sherman (Rep., O.) as the com
mittee on the part of the senate. After
a resolution had been adopted that the
hour of
DAILY MEETING
of the senate shall be 12 o'clock m., on
the motion of Senator Harris, a recess
at 11:10 was taken for one hour, to en
able the committee to wait on the presi
aent. At the expiration of the recess,
at 1:10 p. m.. the. senate resumed its
session, and a message from the bouse
of representatives informing the senate
that a quorum of the house was present,
and of the appointment of a committee
to join a similar committee of the sen
ate previously appointed to wait upon
the president. Then another recess of
twenty minutes was taken upon motion
of Mr. Harris (Dem., Term.) Promptly
at 1:33 the senate resumed its session,
and Mr. McPherson. of the committee
to wait upon the president, appeared at
the bar of the senate and announced
that the president would immediately
communicate with the house In writing.
Secretary Pruden at once stepped
forward and delivered the message, and
it was laid before the senate by the
vice president.who directed its reading.
The secretary of the senate, Mr. Cox.
then began the reading of the message.
All present, with few exceptions.gave
close attention when the reading was
begun. Senator Cameron seemed at
first more interested in a newspaper
when the secretary began his arduous
task, but soon laid it aside, and after
wards listened intently for a short time.
Senator Dolph gave attention to his old
file of Dills for a few minutes, but
•.PRICKED UP HIS EARS
as the reading reached the Hawaiian
paragraph.
Senator Gordon found opportunity to
prepare a brief bill during the progress
of the reading, while Senator Hoar was
apparently more interested in a news
paper than iv the first part of the mes
sage.
There was a general changing abont
in the seats of senators, when that
Fortiori of the document dealing with
lawaii was approached. Many of the
senators had, however, auticipathy the
secretary's reading by turning in their
printed copies to this portion, so that
very few of them, apparently, observed
that the page containing the president's
brief communication on Hawaii was
turned without being read by th* sec
retary.
Senator Kyle was one of the few sen
ators who followed the reading suffi
ciently close to observe the omission,
and he called attention to the oversight
by sending up a note.
Alter this incident there was an evi
dent falling off in Interest on tbe part
of senators, but attention was briefly
revived when the paragraph concerning
bonds was reached. When this para
graph was passed, senators graaually
left their seats and drifted out into the
clonk rooms, so that, by the time the
reading had been two-thirds concluded
there wete only twenty-five concluded
here weie only twenty-five senators iv
he chamber, and a majority of

The vice president responded that the
portion of the message relating to Ha
waii had been inadvertently omitted by 1
the secretary, and directed that it be
read. This was done, and Mr. Dolph
gave notice that he would on tomorrow
address the senate on that part of 'he

Washington, Dec. 4.— The encircling
galleries of the house, except those re

vacant, were filled to overflowing with,
the eager and expectant persons when

ascended the rostrum at high noon today |
and rapped the regular session of the* ]

"Mexican Soldiers: Today we direct

we speak the same language and seek

arms at your own will. You lived in

had a wife that took care of you and
your children, that greeted you with
caresses. From night until morning
you were confined in jail, and after

WHAT ROME WANTS.
Anxious to Ilave an American
Ambassador.
' Rome, Dec. 4.— Referring to the re
fusal of J. J. Van Alen of the ambassa
dorship to Italy, the Journal d' Itaiie
"expresses . the . hope that President
; Cleveland » will not long delay the ap
pointment of a new ambassador. Tte
paper adds that when the Italian gov
ernment made its Washington legation
an embassy it aid so on the formal
promise of the United States govern
ment that it would dp likewise in respect
.toils legation at Home. ...
' ' This, Secretary of State Gresham in
formed Baron Fava, the Italian ambas
sador at Washington, six ; months ago,
Mr. Cleveland would certainly be the
first to recognize. A longer? delay in
the fulfillment of ? this promise, the
'paper concludes, will not be in harmony
with the excellent relations existing be
tweeu Italy ana tbe UuiW_ States.

GOV. LEWELLINGS REMARKABLE AP
PEAL FOR THE POOR.
VAGRANT LAWS TO BE IGNOBED
"Let the Dawn of Christmas Day '
See the Rock Pile and Bull
Pen and the Crime of Being
Homeless Obsolete in All Kan
sas Cities." Writes the Gov
ernor to the Police.
Kansas City. Dec. 4.— A special to
the Times from Topeka, Kan., says: .
One of the most remarkable circulars
ever issued by the executive of any
state was sent out by Gov. Levelling
today. The letter is addressed to all
boards of police commissioners in Kan
sas, and practically renders nugatory all
vagrant laws. After reciting the hard
ships of the poor in olden times.speaking
specially of the reign of Elizabeth, and
in France just previous to the revolu- |
tion, the governor reviews the present
condition of affairs among the poorer
classes in the country. He scores the
laws now on the statute books, which
call the man out of work and penniless
a "confidence man." Speaking of the
vagrancy law of Kansas, he says:
"It separates men into two distinct
classes, different as those who are pen
niless and those who are not, and de
clares the former criminals. Only the
latter are entitled to the liberty guar
anteed by the constitution. To be found
in a city 'without visible means of sup
port or some legitimate business' is the
involuntary condition of some millions
at this moment, and under the law we
proceed ??•.
«■ TO PUNISH THEM
for being victims to conditions which
we as a people have forced upon them."
- The circular then continues as fol
lows: "I have noticed in police court
reports that 'sleeping in a box car' is
among the varieties of this heinous
crime of being poor. Some police judges
have usurped a sovereign's power, not
permitted the highest function of the
states, or of the nation, and victims of
industrial conditions have been per
emptorily 'ordered to leave town.'
"The right to go freely from place to
place in search of employment, or even
in obedience "of a mere whim, is part of
that personal liberty guaranteed by the
constitution of the United States to
every human being on American soil.
Even voluntary idleness is" not
forbidden. If a Diogenes prefer
poverty, if a Columbus choose
hunger and the discovery of a new race,
rather than seek personal comfort by
engaging in 'some legitimate business,'
lam aware of no power in the legis
lature, or in the city councils to deny
him the right to seek happiness in his
own* way, as long as he harms no other
person;*";*?'- *-"-.-■—•- .*■*
„-.""If, men commit offenses, let them
arrested and punished, whether rich or
. poor; hut let simple poverty.cease to be
; crime." r "" .? •*-•--* .-'.--. * ."•
. "In some cities it is provided by ordi- i
nance that if police court .fines are not i
paid or secured, the ' culprit shall be ■
compelled to work out the amount as '
municipal slave; and 'rock piles' and
'bullpens' are provided for the enforce
ment of these ordinances. And so it
appears that tills slavery is not imposed
as a punishment, hut solely as a means
of collecting a debt.
"Such city ordinances are in flagrant
violation of constitutional prohibitions.
The'rock pile' and the 'bull pen', should
never have been used [ in degrading the
friendless and poor. Let these twin
relics of the departed auction block era
cease to disgrace the cities of Kansas.
"And let the dawn of Christmas day
see 'the rock pile' and the 'bull pen' and
the crime of being homeless and poor
obsolete in all the cities of Kansas gov
erned by the metropolitan police' act.
"It is confidently expected that their
own regard or constitutional liberty and
their humane impulses will induce po
lice commissioners to carry out the
spirit as well as the letter of the fore
going suggestions."

MINISTER WILLIS TALKS.
WHY HE HAS NOT CARRIED OUT HIS
INSTRUCTIONS.
THE SITUATION HAD CHANGED
Certain Contingencies Arose
Which Compelled Him to
Wait for Further Washington
Advice— Royalists Much Dis
pleased at the Soldiers
Under Arms in Hawaii.
Port Town send. Wash., Dec 4.—
The barkentine Klickitat, Capt. Cutler,
arrived from Honolulu with advices to
Nov. 20, four days after the steamer
Alameda sailed for San Francisco.
In . an interview published in
the Evening Star, Minister Willis is re
ported to have said: "You are author
ized to state that no change in the pres
ent situation will take place for several
weeks. I brought with me certain in
j structions from the United States gov
ernment on the Hawaiian situation.
Since my arrival contingencies have
arisen about which neither : the
United States government nor myself
was aware when I left Washington. I
have thought best in exercise of the
discretion allowed to submit those mat
ters to Washington before proceeding
further to carry out my original instruc
tions. No one need fear trouble.and no
lawlessness will be permitted,"
This statement gave the annexation
ists much satisfaction, and the royalists
were much displeased. On account of
the many' rumors current of contem
plated action of the queen's supporters,
the provisional government found it
necessary to keep two companies of
soldiers under arms for several nights
after the Alameda sailed. The editor
of the Evening Star requested Minister
Willis to submit a statement to the
public to allay the general feeling
of uncertainty. In a published inter
view Mr. Willis said: "Yes, 1 believe
that the time has come when it is right
and proper for me to use my discretion
in this matter. You are authorized to
say for me that no change in the pres
ent situation will take place for several
weeks." flfSi. 'fif-fl f-zYYi
Mr. Willis then made the statement
quoted above, and added : *"I for
warded mv dispatches to Washington
by today's steamer, and until I receive
an answer to them no change will take
place in the present situation, nor will
any be allowed."
•-What do you mean by the expres
sion, 'nor will any lawlessness be al
lowed?'-" 'YYYXfZf
"I mean just this— that until the
time comes for me to carry out my
instructions, the peace and good order
of this community will be kept
undisturbed in the interests of hu
manity; that any attempt made by.any
person or persons to make trouble will
be promptly checked and punished.
Yon.' may' put the" matter *"* more
plainly and- -say- -that even if .ike
provisional -** government- _c= discharges
all , its • troops today, no lawless
ness would 'be 3 allowed _■'.*_ for one
moment under the pesent situation of
affairs. The whole Hawaiian question
is now in abeyance, and nothing that
the newspapers can say or do will alter
the situation one iota. I make this
statement on my own responsibility,
and in.the hope that it will allay. .the
present excitement. No one need fear
trouble, and no lawlessness will be per
mitted." .:**> . ■":>;■■•
After this statement rumors began to
fly about that the queeu's supporters
would make a final rally iv her behalf.
The crews of the United States men-of
war Philadelphia and Adams were held
in readiness to be landed on a moment's
notice.' Thequeems advocate came out
the uext day with a denial of the Willis
interview, saying he was misquoted,
and by inference gave encouragement
to the idea that Willis had or. would re
ceive an imperative order to restore the
queen. The newspapers containing
Blount's report had not reached the
islands when the Klickitat sailed.

FIRM'S SECOND BIG FIRS,
A fire started in the third floor of the
building occupied by the Powers Dry
Goods company, corner of Fifth an<(
Wacouta streets, shortly after 8 o'clock
last night, and caused a loss of 100,000,
the greater part of the damage being
from water.
The flames were first discovered by
Paul H. Gotzian. of C. Gotzian & Co.,
who happened to be in his office, directly
across the street from the scene of tba
fire. An alarm was turned in over the
A. D. T. wire,, followed a few moments
later by an alarm from Box 32, located
at No. 12 engine house, on Rosabel
street near Fifth. The fire, when first
noticed by Mr. Gotzian, had gained con<
siderable headway, and before the fire-
men reached the scene the flames were
pouring from the windows on the third
floor of the building on the Wacouta
street side. Chief Jackson, as soon as
he arrived, turned in a general alarm,
and in a few moments six streams were
pouring a flood of water into the build
ing.
'■ By good work the, flames were con
fined to the floor on which the fire'
started, but so fierce was tbe blaze that
the stock of notions which occupies the
entire floor was totally damaged. '- The
smoke filled the two upper floors, and'
for a time it looked as though the fire,
had spread and the upper part of thej
building would be gutted. This was
prevented by the excellent work done
by the department, and in half an hour
the flames were under control. The im
mense volume of water which was 1
poured into the building on the .third
story soon leaked through, and the sec
ond and first floors were a sheet
of water. -5 On the second floor
the stock of .white . goods, linens, laces,
hosiery and?*, furnishing goods, .were
damaged by the. water, which 7 worked
through the ceilirig like an ; --April
showier. Down onlthe- stoek -of ->■ dress
goods and silks on? the first floor the
•water dripped in a lively manner, and,
although au attempt was made to move .
the more valuable silk stock to another
part of the room, the water seemed to
follow the removal, and the stock was
badly damaged. The fourth floor is de
voted to manufactured : goods and the
factory, and, although. the stock .was
badly smoked, the damage will not be
heavy, owing to the class of goods.
The origin of the fire is not known;'
the members of the firm and the em
ployes who were last to leave the build
ing being unable to account for the
cause. J. F. Powell, the night watch
man, arrived at the store shortly before
6 o'clock, and half an hour later the
store was closed, and the doors locked.
Powell says he was .through the build
ing at 7:30 o'clock, three-quarters of an
hour before the fire was discovered, and
that there was no sign of fire. He then
went to the basement, and wrote a 1
couple of letters, and was just starting
to make another rouud of the building
when the fire department arrived on the'
scene. The inflammable character of the
notion stock evidently hastened the fire,
and that the building was not gutted is
due to the manner in which the depar-
-ment worked and the construction of
the building, which is known as slow
burning. An investigation made by
members of the firm after the fire had
been extinguished, elicited nothing
which would indicate how, the fire
started. A. J. Powers said that the
only explanation he could give was that
mice aud matches caused iv From the
statements made by Mr. Gotzian and
the members of the department who
were first on the scene, it is
thought that the fire started near,
the desk of A. H. Warren, who has a 1
small office on the third floor iv the no
tion stock.. Every precaution has been
taken by the firm to guard against tires,
there being no gas or stoves in the
building and no lights* after 0 o'clock,
except a lantern carried by the night
watchman. The idea advanced that the
fiae started from an electric light wire
was found to be without foundation, as
the lights were turned off at the s witch
on the first floor at least two nours be
fore the fire started.
A. J. Powers, asked as to the loss,
said that he was not able to fix the fig
ure. The notion stock, which he thought
was valued at about 160,000, was a total
loss. The stock ca tlie second floor,
made up of white goods, laces, fornisii
ing goods and hosiery, valued at from
170,000 to $80,000, was not injured by the
fire, but the damage by water was very
large, probably to the extent of one
third or one-half the value. On the : -st
floor the stock of dress goods ana s^ks
had been badly soaked, aud althc
some of the goods had been y '■:■ >v
ered by tarpaulins it was '.riot
until after they had been well watered.
The fire came at a very busy season,
there being r.t least 8-0,000 worth of
goods ready la bill and 'hip, in various
parts" of the building, "neariy all of them
being on the second ami third floors.
The firm carried insurance amounting
to $300,009, all of whicii is placed by
John C. Shandrew, of the firm or Prince
& Shandrew, who had charge of the
insurance.. The building, which .is
owned by Noyes Bros. & Cutler, was
not badly damaged, the loss being not
to exceed $5,000. covered by insurance.
This is the second time the firm has.
suffered serious loss. On Thanksgiving
day, IS'JI, their building on East Fonrth
street was gutted by fire, the loss being
in the neighborhood of £200.0 Mi, and in
order to collect the amount the firm was
obliged to bring suit against the insur
ance companies.
