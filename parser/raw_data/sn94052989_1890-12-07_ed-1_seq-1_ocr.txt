Sr«lal to The Moasisa Calu
London, Dec 6.— The Cist business trans
acted at the Nationalist meeting to-day was
the reading of Gladstone's letter in reply to
the committee. Gladstone, In his letter, ac
knowledges the receipt of two resolutions
adopted by the Irish caucus, and says, in
part, that the question raised by the publi
cation of his letter to Morley was the ques
tion of the leadership, which is separate,
and has no proper connection with home
rule. " When the Irish paity settles
this question in such a manner as will
enable me to renew my former relations
with the Irish party, it will be my desire to
enter without prejudice into confidential
communication, as the occasion .nay serve,
upon all amendments and suggestions of im
provement in my plan for a home rule
jitsnn Jiciartti]/.
measure. I assure you it Is my desire to press
forward at tlie first favorable opportunity a
jusraud effective measure for borne rule. I
n cognize and earnestly seek to uphold the
DTDEPSSDEXCE OF THE IRISH PARTY,
No less t'.ian that of the Liberal party,
and I acknowledge with satisfaction the
harmony prevailing between the parties
since IS£'J. Wlien the presentdiffi.ul-y is re
moved, 1 know of no reason to autieinate its
interruption. I lock forward witli confi
dence, as do my colleagues, to the formation
and prosecution of a measure, which in meet
ing all just claims of Ireland, will likewise
obtain the approval of the people of
Great Britain. Finally, I will remind
you that apart, from personal confidence,
there is but one guarantee that can be of
real value to Ireland; it is that which was
recently pointed out by Harcourt when he
called attetitiou to the unquestionable po
litiral fact tllat no party or no leadercould
ever hupp to carry a scheme for home rule
that did not have the cordial concurrence
and support of the Irish National party."
STORMY PRO! KKIiIKGS.
Tlie readme of the letter was greeted with
(beets by the section of the party opposing
l'arnell and ironi'-al cries by his supporters.
A stormy del ate followed.
Barry, Sexton and Hejly made a deter
mined attempt to bring about a final settle
ment of tie quction. They insi-ted that
there should oe an imni diate division of
the members on the main qu^st on before
the meeting, namely, the retirement of l'ar
nell from the leadership.
Finally Sexton gnve l'arnell his ultimatum
to the effect that if a deoi-ioa on the ques
tion was delayed by Parueli after G o'clock
this evening the majority would hold their
own meeting and depose him fromtiie office.
A scene of great excitement followed and
at 2 :45 o'clock a recess was taken for half
an hour.
*■ PAHITBIX'B HOT TEMPER.
When tlie meeting reassembled tlie report
of the coufeirinj,' delegates was road at
length.
Mr. Abraham and John O'Connor rose
from their seats sinmllaueously, when Par-
BeU declared the latter had the floor.
Abraham persisted in aD effort to move a
resolution, but could not amid the clamor.
He then banded it to Justin McCarthy, who
arose from his seat and was apparently
about to read it when Parnell gra-ped the
resolution from his hand, saying he would
not receive it.
A tremendous uproar followed and when
quiet was restored Parneli said tlutt until
Uiß party deposes him he would remain
Chairman.
PKBSOHAX ABUSE.
Barry retorted : "You are not our Chair
man," and added that Parnell was "a dirty
trickster," which caused smother uproar.
Arthur O'Connor appealed to his friends
to show every possible respect to the late
leader.
McCarthy said he had only risen to a point
of nder. .Some one handed him a paper
ami the Chairman struck it out of his hand.
Parnell said bs took it from McCarthy,
but the latter Instated thai the paper was

Parnell is removed. This, he said, proved
l'aruell's contention that ii was impossible
to kc t B direct answer fiom Gladstone, lie
believed Ireland would resem this.
A TSEMKH9OOT DFBOAB.
Tiniotliy Uealy caused another tremen
dous row by shouting: "Wl.o is to be the
unstress of the party?" Cries of "Shame!"
came from all parts of the ioun, and Parnell
referred to Hi aly as "a cowaidly little
scoundrel who dared iv an assembly of
Irishmen to insult a woman."
Abraham got the floor and said that since
l'arnell refu-c-d to resign, the members
would be WHiiiing in respect tv tlieniirlves
il they looser delayed in bringing matters
to an i-sue, the Chairman having ignomiai
ously treated and torn McCarthy's resolu

tion, but repealed tliat it would he shame
lul lv allow tlie minority to continue inak

posed an amendment that PalucU's Chair

Another squabble ensued, and Parueli de

whereupon lleaiy shoiiW "Bravo." ,
"Healy," said l'ain.U, " I WO nt stand |
much ;uore from you. An auirndiucnt is

eluded, "to nt once record their decision— if
not here, then elsewhere."
AXTI-PAKN'£LI.ITKS WITHDRAW.
Parnell— You kno.v it is uot an amend

Justin McCarthy took the floor. lie said
lie had hoped up to last night that Parnell
would still help tliem out of their terribla
difliculty. lie was disappointed, and it
would l>u a wasteof time to discuss the mat
ter further. He suggested that all agreeing
with him withdraw.
Justin lluutiy McCarthy followed the ma
jority, savins he was sorry for the decision,
but he. must go with tl: em.
Purnell was left in the room with John
and William ReJmond, Leamy, O'Kelly,

THE MIXOIiITY MEETING.
After the withdrawal of McCarthy and
the other anti-Parneli members the sup
porters of l'arnell adopted resolutions ex
pressing rearet at Gladstone's refusal to
state his views on the questions submitted
to him, aud then ratified the re-elecliou of
l'arnell as Chairman.
Ni.liin argued tiiat the Parneliites would
hold the key to the position aid concluded
by saying that whatever was Parnell's posi
tion in th.- next two or three years ho would
bo ranked with O'Connell as the greatest
Irishman of tho last three ceutuiics.
[dicers.]
The others having spoken, Parnell said:
"These deserters, knowing we Won K°i''g
to Ireland to-motruw, clamored for a de
cision, because they dreaded the lightning
of pi biic opinion in In-laud. Gentlemen,
we have won to-day. [Loud cheers.] Ai

John O'Connor's resolution was then put
and carried by acclamation, aud the meet

THE OPPOSITION.
The opponents of Parnell, who withdrew

learning what had been clone Gladstone ex
claimed: "Tniiuk God, home rule is saved."
GONE TO NEW YOIiK.
Chicago, Dec. 6.— The Irish envoys left
for New York this evening. Shortly before
tneir departure, Dillon, on behalf of himself
and his associates, said to an Associated
Press representative: "We have,
up to the present time, maintained
.-i.euco and abstained from inviting
any expression of opinion on the
sitUHtion at home out ol respect fur
the deliberations of our colleague*. We
have to-uay, however, received assurances
that the Parliamentary fund Association

EngiUh Physicians Eeeard Koch's Discovery
With Distrust.
Lokdoh, Dec. 6.— The first enthusiasm
over Kicli'a discovery is distinctly waning.
It was natural that the French should re
ceive any good thing from Germany with
more than suspicion; but English doctors
are now assuming an attitude of pessi
mism. Koch's methods they admit may te
most useful for a diagnosis," but as yet they
cannot conceive them to be curative, nut
even for lupus, and many doubt whether
they are preventive. Tlie truth Is that
Koch has heen cuiupelied by circumstances
which he could not com ml to reveal his
discoveries before he was himself aware of
their extent. There is not a shadow of
jealousy among the faculty in Great Britain,
such hi there is in l'nrif, but there is dis
trust :;nd disinclination to ncceut Koch's
disci. verips as satisfactory till they are
proved by further experiment*.
Nkw VoiiK, Dee. 6.— The Mail and Ex
press 1 Edinburgh special says: At a meet
ing of tho Medico Chlrurgical Society, Dr.
Phillips described the results of the treat
ment of the stbeb lymph. Iv phthisical
patients. In tlie less advanced stages of con
sumption, night sweats disappeared, expec

weight, and there were other evidences of
the action of the- remedy on tubercles.
Wherever tuherculosus Is situated* the lymph
found its way speedily to the seat of the dis
ease. Professors Gairdner, Stewart and
Braken ridge gave enthusiastic testimony to
the efliciicy of the Koch treatment.

on the Koch treatment to-day, the Parisian
medical faculty concluded it was still diffi

Paris, Dec C— The Taiiff Committee

POLICE AT A MASQUERADE.
Hulluqultl'g notorious Grunt - Avenue
[>•>:,... Ball Raided.
The dance-house of N. It. Holmqnist at
21(j Grant avenue wns raided last night by
the police during tho pro^res* of a masquer
ade ball. The proprietor, bar-keepers, door
keeper and musicians were taken into cus
tody by Sergeant Whitman and po~se. Of
ficer Coonan h-d attended the affair as a
private citizen, and at a signal the other
officers went in.
Whitman asked the proprietor if ho had
the proper license for conducting the ball.
He said that he Had not. nor did he have a
permit from the Chief of Police. He fur
ther declared that the liolice could not ar
rest him, because, he had been so informed
by bit lawyer. Counsellor Clarke. About
tliis time the Venuses, courtier?, cavaliers,
pliost-danccrs and cupids were struggling
through a small duor to escape.
The police disrezarded the advice of
Counselor Clark. There were eight, men
nrrestcd and the bail was fixed at $500 cash
in each case. Tim ordinance of the lionrd
of Supervisors (1H58) bearing upon the sub
ject requires that a license of S-00 be paid
for such balls, after the pcrmis-sion of the
Chief oi Police has b»en obtained. The
men wero uuahle to givo bail, aud were

BOUGHT A RACJS.
Written Confession cf :he Owner of a Famous
Bullion.
Chicago, Dec. 6. — A Bansor (Maine)
special s-ays: It is no secret lien? that in the
great Etallion race of the famous Nelson-
Alcryon— ihe case now under consideration
by the National Association — C. 11. Nelson
bought and paid for three beats which gave
huC&taliion the championship in the stallion
world. He paid tee day before the race to
Noble, the owner of Alcryon, $1000 in cash
and two checks of 82000 each— ssooo in all—
which amount be pot back as winner of the
race, Koble getting $2600 additional as «in
ner of the second money. Alcryon was
taken the night before the race to a shop
near the trad.-, his raciriß shoes were milled
eft' and lie was shod with heavy shops, to
which be was not accustomed. The lraud
was discovered, and as is well known, both
men and horseii were expelled. Nelson
made a clean breast of the whole matter,
nnd i he association is in rossession of his
confensicm in writine and has abo the
checks in id and returned to Nelson.
New Vohk. Dee. 6.— The Hoard of Re
view of tiie. National Trotting Association
rendered a decision in the case, to-day ex
pelling NVbon an I the horse Nelson from
tho association. Acetfrupanylne the decis
ion was the confession made by Nelson.
The confession states that Nolson had his
liorso entered in the race that came off at
Beacon Park, Huston, on September j;(,
1880. Frank Noble, tlie, reputed owner of
Alcryon, made an overture to NeNon to
arrange the rttsult of the race and divide tho
winnings. Nelson refused. Next day,
within two hours of the race, he learned that
Budd Doble, who was to drive the horse
Nelson, was unable to be there, fin asked
John Splari to drive, but Splan refused, and
next day told Nelson that he had been paid
£500 by Noble not to diive Nelson. The
upshot was that Nelson had to drive him
self, although be says he was much heavier
than the regulation weight, and ihis, with
the bad tracK, constituted a .serious handi
cap to the horse. Just after the race an in
timate friend if hi- came to him and said be
had been seriously concerned about tlie out
come of tlie «;nt-.st, and had promised in
case of the race bein^ awarded to Nelson
that Noble might have the premium won by
the victor. Nelson says he knew this friend
was Influenced by a desire to pro'ect his
(Nelson's) horse in in combinations, and so
he agreed to the arrangement. Neleon won
tiio race and Noble took the money, Ssof.ni;
won by Nelson, and the Second money.

THE UNION PACIFIC.
Questions Ha&et Cocsideraticn at a Meeting
of the Executive Ccmmitte?.
New Toiik, Dec. <>.— The Executive Com
mittee of the Union Paeiik- Uailwa; held a
meeting at the office of Jay Uuuld to-day.
Gould said, nfier the meeting: "The qnes
tion of considering Hie flouting debt of the
Union Pacific has not been altogether the
subject of the Executive Committee* delib
erations. The Union I'acific is all rich',
and the e;iniint;s of the load are creator than
ever. The natiiic of the meeting 10-day was
largely to discuss the advisability of Ciilliiiß
a conference of tho various railroad Presi
dents. The object of the conference would
have no other significance tlian the promo
tion of harmony and good fellowship among
railway oflicials, so that they would lie a
unit in the event- of demoralization in rates.
Sacs a conference would bo a power in pre
cluding the possibility of the recurrence of
any suit of demoralization. Many days will
uoi pass before that conference will be held."
D«W-Jonea quotes an operator in Union
Pacific as Baying: "it sterns reasonably cer
tain that (joulJ did not buy any "great
amount of stock. lie did something of
valun to the company in connection with
the floating debt, although 1 hear the amount
proves larger than he anticipated. If the
Union Pac-ilic recently owed anything like.
S-O,(>0o,(:00 it to quite certain the amount
cannot bo liquidated without removing the
stock still further from any hope of divi

Ni:w YoiiK, Die. 0. -The Conn.iercial
Bulletin says: it w;:s discovered yesterday
that a large uiiiiiber of Cie insurance com
panies have made ui> their minds that the
next legislative ses.-ioa of California may
come and go, so far as they are concerned,
without the Interference of any expensive
attorneys for insurance Companies. The day
for blood money paid to attorneys to iu
fluetiCP the California legislator has gone
by. they think, and if any subscription at
all is gotten up for I his purpose it is safe to
fay the majority of the lire insurance com
panies will not to "in it." The "courtesies"
shown California lawmakers iv the past
cost more money than they were worth, and
the companies will take a i.i^h moral plane
next season. Noihiut: is so conducive to
the adoption of a high moral plane by insur
ance companies as the kuowlcdge that they
did not Kei the worth of tUeir cusli when it
was illicitly iuvested.
MIZNEK-S RECALL.
Ccmmenti cf the Hew York Tribune on ths
B.irrui d.a Aff ir
Nkw Yoiik, Deo. C-'ilie Tribune says
tho B;ir:undla affair has involved tile re-
Uiemeut of Minister Wizner with a crushing
iind «cll-mciite<l rebuke from Secretary
Blame. The official correspondence discloses
two important facts which wereuotrevealel
in the earlic&t accounts of this unfortunate
and discreditable trnnsactiuu. The first U
the intervention of tlie United States naval
officers, aud the second is the menacing
language used by the Guatemalan author
ties after the attempted surrender and kill
ing of Carrundia. Mi/ncr's conduct is
placed in a very bad light by these dis
closures. The Minister displayed through
out the negotiations a lamen'tablo lack of
judgment. Instead of showing tact and
discretion he sought to ingratiate himself
into favor with the Guatemalan authorities
by aiding and abetting their intrigue against
a political rival. This was a most deplora
ble blunder and a sorry exhibition of Ameri
can diplomacy.

INDIAN GRIEVANCES.
Reuitof a Catholic Priest's Visit to the
Eosiile Camp.
Pine Uidce Agency (S. Dak.), Dec. G.—
A ■ perilous :i mission ns a wan of God lias
undertaken for ninny a dny in the interest
of averting great Lkodshed was completed
yesterday, when good Falber Jute, the
Calliolic priest whom General limoke re
quested to go out and tulk with the ram
pantly hostile lr.diaus, returned lo the |
agency, lie »ai tiie only white man who
might even think ulevrr making the trip and
living to get back. The- reverend fatlier wtis
accompanied by Jack Bed Cloud, who west
by reason of being the widely respected son
of tin- famous < hief.
Ten miles from fin hostile camp they were
halted by pickets and conducted lo the camp
under the cover of Winchesters. A conler
ence followed. There were present Two
Stroke, Turning Bear, Shoit Hull, High
Hawk, Crow Dog, Kickine Bear, E;ii:le Pipe, j
Bia Turkey and High Pipe. Father Jute
opened Ihe council by asking the chiefs tj
state their grievance*.
CESWro RETIT.X3.
The replies were -...-:.....■■. as follows:
"We object to the recent census returns
made by Lee. His enumeration would not i
jiive food Miftirieut for us to live on. Lee I
puU us down many less ior eiich tepee than
the tepee contains. We sjall starve. We
shall liave huh big eat before s arving tititf-»
comes. After thai we shall fUht our lust
light, and tlie whiteman shall lee more blood
and more dead than ever before. Then we
shall tjo to tiio last hunting-ground hapi>y.
If the white man did not meaK to cheat us
out of food the Great lather never would
liHve sent soliiiets. There is no need of
soldiera if the Great Father Intended to be
fair with us. ;
BBOKE3 PBOIHSKS.
"The Great Father has dr.no another
wrong. He lias put a new boundary line
between the Roftebud hud I*l lie Kidjje agen
cies thiit makes man; of u> li - n\e cur homes
ami ci\e them 10 otners. The Great Father
broke an old treaty when he did this. We
can no longer believe the (Jreut Fnliier. He
says to us: 'Chi'dten, you shall never be
moved again unless you (rant to he moved,'
ana then he goes ri^ht away and move-, us.
We arc done with promises, and now wo
pake a promise that we will rj^lit, and the
Great Father will lilid that Wo will not
break our promise.
"We will now lie very plain with you,
Christian Father, and tell you another thing,
something of which you may have already
thought: We are not coming in now, and
will not lay down our rilles becauu we aie
annul of the consrquenees. We have done
wrong and we know it. If we stop now we
will be punished. The Great Father will
send many of us to his big iron house to
stay many moons. We would die."
FATHZB JUTE'S ADVICE.
Father Jute urged them to be peaeoable,
and explained that the soldieis were not
present to harm the Indians, but to protect
the agency; that Hie rations h.id b?en in
creased, and if they ctmie in General Brooke
would telegraph to Washington und grt per
miasion fur them to stay on this agency, as
they desired. So far as the depredations
were concerned, the Fatlier t«ld them they
had bett'-r stop committing them and they
would be more easily forgiven. Finally ho
urged the chiefs to come back with him. To
this some of the older ones made favorable
answer, but the young ones, who were
heavily in the majority, said "No." Hut
the old men finally agreed that they would
come in to Father Jute's house, four miles
northwest of the sgency, this morning aud
there meet General Brooke, and tell niin ill
person just what they bad loM Father Jute.
This brought on » renewal of bitter opposi
tion from the majority.
Finally the young chiefs cooled off and
Two Stroke, addressing Father Jute, said:
"Hold your hands up to the Great Spirit
and tell us, as though you were about to
start ou the journey to the last hunting
grounds ol the red man, whether what you
say to us from General Brooke be true,
and that we will not be. hnrmed if we cotuo
in simply lo talk to General Urooke."
Father Jute said he complied with the re
nuest. All the chiefs then extended their
bands toward heaven, and with great so
lemnity promised they would come.

transmitted to Congress a letter from Majar-
Geueml SchvfleKl and a mass of official cor
respondence. General Schofield iv liis letter
snys: "There can be no practical disarma
ment of Indians except by making them ac
tually i nsonerb of war and holding them
under such restraint that it would be impos
sible for them to securo anna or ammuni
tion. This would sefiu lo require a change
in the general policy followed in the treat
ment of warlike tribes of Indians, as it
would continue military control over those
who may havo been subdued until such con
trol becomes manifestly no longer necessary,
and this, it is suggested, may possibly be
done by joint action between the W«r oud
Interior departments in such manner as not
to interfere with measures of the Interior
Department which are decmrd best for the
civilization and material welfare of the In
dians."

Washington, Dro. G.— Secretary Troetor
transmits to Congress Lieutenant-Colonel
Benyaurd's report on the preliminary exam
ination of the Sun Rafael lliver, in compli
ance with the provisions of the Rivet and
Harbor Bill. He reports that rtie San Ra
fael if unworthy of improvement. Briga
dier-General Chief of Knyiueers J. L. Casey
cotu-urs in the opinion.
Benyaurd says the so-called river is only a
sluugh, navigated at high tide by small sail
ing vessel', plying between San Francisco
and San Knfael. There is nothing exported
fruin San Rafael. The. Imports consist of
lumber, coal, sand, lime, hay and general
merchandise. More dependence is placed
•cpon the railroads connecting San Rafael
w till Tiburon. It Is on the northerly side of
the bay, where connection is made by ferry,
Although a considerable amount is carried
by ve.-sel». Tins tiansporiation was proba
bly somewhat Increased during the past
year. It is desired that a depth of fix to
seven feet at low tide be given, and that the
chmnit'l be widened in order to accommodate
a linger chiss of vessels, both steam and
sailing. This Improvement would necessi
tate the dredging of the chauuel and banks
of the slough, straightening it ut ceitain
points by cutting across the bends, and the
dredging and maintenance of the channel
through the mud lints beyond its mouth.
Ti.is itniJtovement, if made, could not t>e
considered permanent, and there wi uld be
required from year to year additional dredg
ing to maintain a channel.

SCHOOL REFORM,
Emperor William's Attack on Higher Edu
cation Sharply Criticized.
German Newspapers Rsent His Fling at
Journalists— Koch's Experiments With
His Diphtheria Cure.
Copyrighted, 1860, by the New York Associated
lTess.
Berlin. Dec. G.— The Keirhanzeiger cives
passages from Empiror William's recent
speech on school reform. One point the
Emyieror especially emphasizes is, the time
lost in higher public schools in cramming
youths with Latin and Greek instead of the
German language and German history, es
pecially the growth of German Institutions
and the idea of national unity. "Modern
history," he declared, "if rightly taught
would become infinitely more valuable than
the chronicles o£ antiquity." How, he asks,
were so many young Germans seduced from
the path of political virtue? How was it
that Germany produced as reformers of
society so many men who are nagging at
their own government while commending
the governments of oilier nations? It was
simple ignorance arising from defective edu
cation on tlio genesis of modern Germany.
The higher schools must mend their methods.
They must make their studies bear upon
practical life, reJace tho boys' book-work
and give more time for healthy recreation
and training of the body. The present sys
tem tended toward the overproduction of
higlily educated people. Journalists, he
said, were bigh-scbool products run to sevd.
He approved the sayiug of Bismarck ancnt
the arbiturionten proletariat, whom ho called
"hunger candidales," and from whom tho
ianks ol journalism were largely recrui:ed,
forming a class dangerous to society.
Finally, he declared lie would not lieeuse
any more high schools until their methods
were amended.
The newspapers generally sharply r p spnt
the Emperor's references to journalists.
The National Gazette fays that Instead of
their being " burger candidates," many higb
Slate officials are only too willing to ex
change their pi.sts for positions on the press
if they can get the'ii.
The latest dcveloi ments of Koch' 9 dis
covery of a cure for diphtheria and te
tanus have been limited to test experi
ments with animals until yesterday, when
the remedy was applied to several human
subjects through th» transfusion ot blood
front auiiiiuls not susceptible to diphtheria
bacillus or tetanus. It was found that the
blood of rats and wioe ha'i a destructive
effect on the virus of diphtheria, while the
blood of rabbits transfused, had a similar
effect ou tetanus. 15efore iransfu-uou, the
bl«od must be freed from coagulant ana
otherwise prepared.
Proferaors Ziemss<>n and Bauer, in lectur
ing before the Munich ileuical Society, ex
pressed themselves as opposed to the u^e of
Koch's ljinph in private practice until the
chances ol a cure aro better demonstrated.
A patient in a Vienna hospital who was un

A NIGHT WITH WAUIUN.
The Trite nnd the False Svkliiih of Elo
cntlun Ii- in .i, 1 1 .t . .!
It was a quarter past 8 o'clock la*t night
when the distinguished reader, lecturer Hud
author. E. 13. Warmm, A.M., made his au
pearauce on tlie platform of the Meiropol
itun Temple to tieat those who had assem
bled to hear him to one of his delightful
Delsarte talks. Daring the course of his
remarks lie said that California audiences
did not appeal to appreciate the idea of
punctuality, and thiit while he considered
it a breach of void manners to commence to
sjieak before his audience was seated, he
also c> nMdered it equally a treacli of good
manners for those v. ho dune late to keep
the i-uuctual ones from hearing what w.is to
be said, and that during the remainder of
the course he would cuuimence at sharp 8
o'clock.
The hall was not as well filled as it might
have been, or as it undoubtedly will be at
the next lecture, which takes place Tuesday
lii^lit, December Utli, but the audience was
an intillectual our, and fully Hupreeiated
the happy manner in which the speaker
treated the subject. This was evinced by
the hearty laughter and tumultuous ap
plause which was elicited by his home
thrusts. His subject was " True and False
Elocution," and the manuer in which it was
treated showed that the speaker was thor
oughly skill.d in analysis. His exordium
was nn illustration of the evil effects
of imitation and a warning to avoid
mechanical ana borrowed mannerisms.
They seldom fit. Beechei and GongU were
both given as instances of eloquence,
wherein the latter violated every rule of
elocution. For either to have assumed the
style of the other would have been to have
made the offender ridiculous. Ho told of »
visit he had made to hear a celebrated elo
cutionist who spoke in the Tremont Tem
ple, Boston. One of the poems recited was
"Jennie McNeil," of which he gave one
stanza as it was then rendered ami as it
should he. The result was ttiat Uic house
was convulsed with laughter.
What was wanted in presenting a subject
of any kind to an auditneo was assumption
and not assertion. The feelings of the
author must be assumed. An assertion of
the will is the result of a falling inflexion,
and vice versa. Elocution is a high art. A
statue must notshow the tool of the sculptor,
neither must a speaker show himself.
It is so with all art, and no actor practices
before an audience. The school of 1) -lsurto.
wants no books: it needs words and ilieir
meaning or sii;niticati in. The Deisarte sys
tem will give one word G25 different Boni
fications. He exemplified this by reciting
from "Paul Revere, "Sheridan's liide,"
"Barbara Freitchie" ' and other ran
dom pieces, nnd it was simply wonderful
to note the effect the different renditions had
when applied to the subject, hlocution is
not the work of so many lessons, or weeks
or months of study, but is the work of
years, ami is then seldom attained in its
perfection. The human voice is the ino=t
delicate instrument to pluy upon, but when
it is thoroughly attuned it adapts itself to
the prevention if not tha cure of lung and
bronchial troubles. School-teachers hug
the false Ideas from ignorance, and teacti
them, not knowing huw to control their own
voices.
He said that the greatest actor of the age
had told him that he regretted his ignorance
of true elocution. The fulse cannot use tho
natural tone of voice. He imitated a teacher
of elocution, who, upun alighting from a
car, said to a bystander, " Can you direct
me to the Town Hall?" and said tho mo
ment the mau sp»ke lie knew he was tho
teacher of elocution, for he carried the sig-i
in his face. A lady who had been giving
lessons to a minister finally cave up m de
spair lor the reason tluit she could not get
him to pray uiannnatically. Some teachers are
continually teaching then pupils to makeges
tures and strike attitudes, and finally the
pupils get so that they cannot make a mathe
matical statement without striking an atii
tude. Let the gestures and the attitudes
come natural. Always make lli6 garment
to fit, and remember that it is the control of
belf that controls the audience. Teaching
when and where to make gestures put him
in miiiii of a man whose manuscripts were
interlarded with "cry here." There is a
natural motion foruvery emotion, but some
people think that perspiration means in
spiration. He had learned from experience
that it is the empty wagon thai makes the
most noise.
There must be expression before there can
be impression, and there is a great difference
between reading and reciting. Many per
sons sacrificed art for the sake of effect,
because they saw it would "take" with an
audience He gave humorous illustra
tions of si'iue of the efforts of this
class. Joe Jefferson, he said, was
oue of tho few who was perfectly
natural, and whesq Voice lit the same time
could be heard distinctly all over tne audi
torium, aud ho followed closeiy the princi
ples of lMsnrie by feeling the character
which ho portrayed. During the evening
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Mr. A\arnian gave fal»e and true int»rpreta-

In facial appearance Mr. Wannan very

every word nttered distinct in every part ot

tunities to hc-ar him, and tiie occa-iious will
be of intellectual refinement as well as in
the highest degree amusing. No one can
listen to him and not have their eyes opemd
to glaring defects in the present system of

At the morning session of tha alliance.
President Hull ot the Missouri State Alli
ance explode^ a bomb regarding tlio Ma
cone-Polk-LivtuKston Investigation, which
came near splitting up tlie convention. Hs
secured the. floor and declared titat he had
not signed the committee report yesterday
became it was not satisfactory" to him.
He started to read from in. uuscript li is
objections! but Alacune's adherents
raised objection?, saying that the
matter had been cloaed yesterday. A
treir.endous clainpr folowet, but
finally, |Ilali'a friends prevailed, and ha
read his report lie had not signed tlio
committee's report for several reasons: Be
cause it censured President Polk unjustly
for writing the Norwood letter; because it
exonerated Macune, although he openly ad
mitted befcre the eommlttef that he had
gone to Georgia anil formed a combination
among the alliance legislators in tlie inter
est of Pat C'alliouu for United States Sen
ator; because Alacuue had also admitted that
Calhoun lad loaurd him $2000; because
Maeiuie further admitted that hu remained
sixteen days in Qeonria lobbying for Cai
houii's election; and because Maeune had
admitted that lw had, for the past year,
tiaveled on transpai lation tarnished him
by the West Point Terminal Company.
Proof had also been adduced of the policy
of the National Economist and Georgia
Alliance Farmer being in the interests of
corporations and muuopolists. ThU chango
had been so marked as to have confirmed Lhe
au^uicion of outside financial influence.
Tlie reading of this document was /c 1»...
lowed by a tremendous hubbub. Finally,
as B compromise, Livingston of Georgia
secured the adoption of a motion making the
continuance of the investigation a special
order. '1 his evening it is understood a com
promise has bi-eu arranged, llajl agreeing
to withdraw his paper in tlie interest of
harmony.
At the evening session Dr. Macnne nd
drefteed the convention briefly, denying the
truth of some of the statements made by
Hail. Then Hall s lid that while h« with
draws the written explanation made by him
tie dues not change his original opinion.
Tliis speech was greeted with mingled ap
plause and hisses.
President Folk's suggestion fora National
Legislative Council was adopted. The,
committee on tlie President's message made
a report in favor of retaining nn official
residence in Washington and making his
salary $3900. This was f.ilopted, the action
being in direct opposition to Macune's
recommendations. Before the eveniug ses
sion adjourned, however, it was resolved to
indorse tlio National Economist.
