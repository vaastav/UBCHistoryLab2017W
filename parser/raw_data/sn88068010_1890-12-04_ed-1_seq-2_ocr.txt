The erudite Mr. Rider, of the
Brunsivicler. heartily endorses the
appointment, recently made by Gov.
Francis, of Judge Geo. B. McFar
lane, of Mexico, Mo., to one of the
supreme judgeships. The endorse
ment seems to be based principally
on the fact that Mr. Rader '-has met
Judge McFarlane at the bar." A
curious public would like to know
which paid for the drinks.
It is said that Senator Ingallji, of
Kansas, has denounced the methods
of Peacock Reed s speaker of the
bouse, and is opposed to any charge
in the rules of the senate that will
facilitate the passage of the force
bill. If this is true we are inclined
to believe that there is some good in
Ingalls, which must be located in
his heel from the length of time it has
required for it to reach his mouth.
Official returns of the Illinois
vote show that the house will stand:
Democrats, 77; Republicans, 73;

stands: Democrats, SJ3; Republi
cans, 27. On joint ballot the alli

of power. It is difficult to tell who
will succeed Senator Farwell in t :e
United States senate, but whether
that grand old man, G-n. John M.
I'aimer, is sent to the senate or not
he certainly deserves to be. He is
a man of pure principles, and is to
day the noblest statesman in the
slate of Illinois. The Sucker state
could do herself no greater honor
than to send Gen. Palmer to the sen
ate.
Tue old chestnut about Blaine'9
resigning is being cracked again.
Mr. Blaine is enjoying public life
too much just now to retire from
the secretaryship. Beside James G.
Blaine is not a man to let go the
public pap, for without it he would
be as ill at ease as a fish out of wa
ter. Before he ever resigns he must
see a boom on which he will hope to
ride into the presidency. The fact
that Ben and Jim are at outs will
have nothing to do with er. Blaine's
resignation, for Mr. Blaine is master
of the situation so far as the little
president is concerned.

JcikjE Sherwood in delivering the
opinion of the supreme court of Mis
souri rendered the following sensible
decision: ''That when two reruns
are jointly indicted for an offense,
one should not be permitted to agree
with the prosecuting attorney to turn
state's evidence, and swear away
the life or liberty of his associate
in crime, in consideration that he be
discharged frcm the iodictment and
go free." In the light of justice we
regard Judge Sherwood's decision
on joii.t connection in crime as emi
nently correct. When two men,
steeped alike in some dark deed, are
arraigned for trial, the one, in order
to gain his own liberty, would will-
swear away the
criminal.
