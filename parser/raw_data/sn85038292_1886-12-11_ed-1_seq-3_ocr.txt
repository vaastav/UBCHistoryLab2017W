Do not throw coal ashes in the streets, nor
allow any member of your family or employe
to do so. They are not only blown into the
doors and windows of your neighbors, and
thus become an annoyance, but it is a finable
offence under a city ordinance.

There was a rumor in Westminster last
Monday that Thomas Caltrider, who had been
shot by Rezin B. F. Warehime, at Mechanics
ville on Sunday, November 28, had died of
his wounds. The report was entirely un
founded, and Mr. Caltrider is doing well, with
every prospect of speedy recovery.
Last Saturday President Cleveland appoint

To day closes the fifth week of Court, and
yet the civil docket has scarcely been touched.

The damage to our press, which broke two
•weeks ago and compelled us to avail ourselves
of the courtesy of the Sentinel in working off
our edition, was promptly and effectively re
paired by Mr. John A. Shower, our skillful
local machinist, at his establishment, corner
of liberty and Green streets, this city. A
printing press is a complicated piece of ma
chinery, and it is not otten that others than
those engaged in their manufacture, with the
necessary facilities in a press factory, can re
pair a break. We cordially recommend Mr.
Shower to all who have need of his services.
His shops are an invaluable addition to West*
minster industries.
The fall of snow has delayed the taking of
photographs of buildings in Westminster, and
this will necessarily delay the issuing of the
Directory. The Directory will certainly con- '

Odd Fellows’ Hall, Albaugh Building,
Orndorff Building, Advocate Building, Mon

is desired to have St. John’s Church, St. Paul s
And the Dunkard Church, and about four
or five private residences, and several more
business houses. The cuts wiU cost $9.00
•each, and those ’who are thinking over the
matter will please decide to-day as it is de
sired to have the photographs taken before
more snow falls. Those wanting two cuts
will get a reduction. By having a consider
able number made, we hare been enabled to
get them at a lower figure than first supposed, j

A Mysterious Fire.
A fire of mysterious origin occurred in this
city about 8 o’clock Wednesday night last, at
the residence of Rev. Chas. A. Reid. Mrs.
Nelson Mitten, a neighbor, detected smoke
in her house, and in looking out for the cause
*aw smoke issuing from the roof of Mr. Reid s
house. The alarm of fire was quickly given,
and soon the fire department was on hand.
The family being at church, the house was
.opened ;U)<l ike fire speedily extinguished.
Tne fire only needed air to have done great
damage. It originated in a bureau in a second
etory back room, where there had not been a
fire for more than year. The supposition is
that a match must have been ignited by open
ing or shutting a drawer, or by a mouse. Ihe
report of a lamp exploding is incorrect, as
there was none in the room at the time. Mr.
Eeid’s loss is about $75 in furniture, carpets,
bed and table linen and other contents of the
bureau. A hole was burned m the floor and
the wails damaged by water and smoke, Tbe
building was insured m the Carroll county
company, and Mr. E. Manning, the secretary
nod treasurer, viewed the property on Thurs
day morning and at once gave orders for re
pairs. The repairs will not likely cost over
$25.
PATAPSOG ITEMS.
Temperance Meeting-Large Hogs, &c.
A temoerance meeting was held at the Pa
tapsco M. E. Church on Saturday evening last,
the object of which was to arouse * a temper
ance sentiment in our neighborhood, ana to
, obtain members and a charter for a division
i of the Sons of Temperance at our place. Dr.
Charles Billingalea, of Westminster, the G.
. W. P., Wm. L. Whittington, of Anne Arun
del county, and Rev. W. C. Babcock, were
the speakers. The meeting was opened by
singing and prayer, after which Dr. Billings
lea was introduced. He said that the tem
> perance issue was-at hand, and the time had
| come in this country when every citizen of
1 both sexes was called upon to take sides.
That there was no middle ground and should
be no neutrality in the issue. The liquor men
were organizing and holding secret sessions
> and we must organize also in every district,
town and hamlet, and be ready when the fight
comes. And the best way to do it was to or
ganize divisions of the Sons of Temperance
all over the country. He appealed to the
audience, which was large and respectable, to
know upon which side of this great issue they
would be found acting. He spoke of the
origin of the Sons of Temperance and of the
good effects of the society in moulding public
sentiment. He spoke earnestly and laid a
strong foundation for Mr. AV hittington, who
followed in a forcible and truthful exposition
of the evils of intemperance. He had come a
long way for no other purpose than to try to
show to his fellow man the evils of strong
drink, and to recommend a remedy. The
liquor traffic in this country was fraught with
so much evil, and was the growing cause of
so much misery that no human language
could defend it and no conscientious man
could sell it to his fellow-mau to ruin and de
grade him. No drunkard can enter the king
dom of Heaven, therefore it damns the soul.
He said whiskey was made to support a class
of lazy fellows (the liquor seller) who grow
fat upon the hard earnings of the poor labor
ing man. He drew a contrast between the
boy sent to the store with twenty-five cents to
buy sugar, muslin or stockings and thq one
sent with the same amount to the rum shop
to buy whiskey. In the one case the family
had the benefit of the money. In the other
it was worse than thrown away. It was use
less, however, to waste time to prove the evils
of strong drink, as every sensible person knew
its tendency. And no person ever became
better off by using alconolic drink, and no
argument under heaven could be produced to
prove it beneficial.
How to cure it: The best way he thought
was for the people to place themselves under
some restraint or in some position wherein
they could use an influence to improve public
sentiment and thereby elevate the human
family. He thought that the organization of
, temperance societies throughout the country
wherein the members thereof could hold stated
meetings and inculcate a temperance senti
ment would exert the greatest influence in
that direction, and that a division of the Sons
of Temperance in this neighborhood would
be of great benefit, wherein the energies and
influence of beautiful woman, conscientious
men, and down to fourteen year old boys,
could be enlisted in the cause. Rev. Bab
cock closed the exercises in a few very ap
propriate remarks. He showed that the great
expenditure of money for intemperance even
among the laboring classes, and the wage
workers, bred most of the discontent now so
rife in the country. After which several per
sons gave their names as charter members of
a temperance organization.

While riding home in a buggy, and near
their residence, on December 2d, Hon. S. H.
Hoffacker and wife met with an accident by
the breaking of a spindle. Their horse began
to run, but Mr. Hoffacker succeeded in stop
ping him, but not until a fence rail had made
its way through the top of the buggy, just
above the heads of the occupants. The buggy
was a total wreck, but Mr. and Mrs. Hoffacker
were uninjured.
J. H. Blocker, our merchant, seems to be
doing a thriving business this season in grain

last week killed five hogs, fourteen months
old, that weighed respectively 500, 4SZ, 480,

The service was impressive and should be
followed by all who have children to conse

proper place for the service as well as that
of the Holy Communion.

When the year was divided by the Romans
into ton months, this division was called De
cember, in referenpe to its numerical place in
the calendar. It is from the Latin decern ,
meaning ten. By the ancient §axons it was
called Winter-monat , or Winter-moptbi but
after their conversion to Christianity, tljey
designated it as Heligh-nionqt, or Holy
month, fro the anniversary which occqrs
in it of the birth of Christ. From the sme
gircucostance the modern Germans distinguish
it by the epithet of Chrwf-iuonat. In this
month occurred the old Roman Saturnalia ,
a period marked by general license and mer
rymaking. The same is now our Christmas.

mended the prisoners to the mercy ot the
court. The verdict differed from the general
sentiment of the community, most people who
heard the testimony believing that the accus
ed were gnilty of manslaughter, and regarded
five years imprisonment as ample punishment
The affair grew out of a political disagree
ment, and the killing was done in a fight.
On Saturday the prisoners received the
judgment of the court The hour for sentence
was" not known, as it depended upon the
action of the counsel for defense, and the
court house almost looked deserted as com
pared with its appearance during the progress
of the trial.
About 11 o’clock Mr. Pearson, accompan
ied by a representative of the Advocate,
called at the jail to see the prisoners, and
. found them surrounded by eight or ten of
their relatives, who had been with them dur
ing their trial. They looked a hundred per
cent, better than on the day previous, when
they listened with depressed spirits at the
able argument of State’s Attorney Henning,
as he contended for a verdict of murder in the
first degree, and afterward waited nervously
for the conclusion of the jury. In reply to
questions as to what they thought of the ver
dict, they said that they regarded it as unjust,
but concluded not to lake any further legal
steps and would accept whatever sentence the
court saw proper to pronounce and serve
their terms like men.
As the visitors were leaving the jail Mr.
Pearson received a telegram from Messrs.
Heuisler and Cook, iu reference to withdraw
ing exceptions noted during the trial, and re
turned and told the prisoners to prepare for
Shortly before 12 o’clock Mr. Pearson ap
peared in court, and stated that counsel for
defense concluded to withdraw all exceptions.
At this Judge Miller requested Sheriff Lyrico
to bring in the prisoners, and a few minutes
later they stood in the dock. When asked
by the court whether they had anything to
say,both Burke and Kennedy answered “No. ’
The judge then imposed almost the extreme
penalty of the law, sentencing them to seven
teen years and six months in the penitentiary,
1 conceding only six months out of respect to
the jury’s recommendation of mercy, eighteen
years being the limit of imprisonment for
1 murder in the second degree. The entire
proceedings did not occupy three minutes,
and the prisoners were back to their cell in
the jail within ten minutes from the time they
1 left it.
The prisoners did not expect such a sen
tence, thinking the jury’s recommendation
' would certainly count for something in their
! favor. Their friends spent Sunday with them.
On Monday morning the prisoners were
1 taken to the penitentiary by Deputy Sheriff
Zeiber. They were taken on the 7 o’clock
train, and thus avoided a crowd at the depot,
which certainly would have collected had
the hour of their departure been later. At
Baltimore, too, the crowd assembled at Hil
‘ len Station was avoided, by leaving the train
‘ at Union Depot. The report in the Baltimore
papers that Kennedy broke down and wept
; bitterly on the cars is declared by Mr. Zeiber
to be utterly without foundation.
The prisoners are now safely confined. For
; good behavior they get a reduction ot two
months on every year, and by complying with
, the rules their sentence can be reduced to
about fourteen years.
NOTES.
John Burke, father of John Burke, Jr., is
i much depressed by the verdict and sentence.
He is well advanced in life, and is possessed
of a considerable fortune. John is his only
i child, and he will likely be long in his grave
, before his son is liberated. His money and
: home, he says, are nothing to him without
his b °y- ~. o
A row occurred at Locust Point on baturr |
day afternoon, and first reports attributed
r the origin to the bad feeling engendered be
tween the friends of Curran and Burke and
Kennedy. Pete Leary and Michael Divers,
two witnesses for the State in the recent trial,
> were run out of a saloon, and Leary knocked
; down, by Thomas Knox. The affair bad
;* nothing to do with the trial here.

NOTHING SUCCEEDS LIKE SUCCESS.
j The maxim above is one which in every
1 sphere of life a human being should always
remember, and concentrate his ideas in con
; formity with the same, and no matter what
circumstances to the contrary should at first
present themselves, they should always re
member that nothing succeeds like success.
We therefore with pride point to the fact, and
■ would illustrate that Messrs. S. Kaon, Son A
Co., the popular Dry Goods Merchants of this
city, are imbued with the spirit of our maxim,
i. Coming to our busy city but a few weeks ago
they started a big enterprise, opening an es
tablishment and displaying therein a line of
Dry Goods, Notions and Carpets which to-day
is the largest of its kind in any of the counties
in the state. By fair dealing they have in
gratiated themselves in the good graces of our
community, and as their goods are the
cheapest, their stock the largest, they have
further studied how to merit the approval of
the public, and will therefore during the
coming holidays offer, so we have been in
formed, extra inducements in every line in
their store, and especially in their Cloak De
partment. We know that no merchant wishes
to carry from season to season any stock in
that particular line, and therefore we can say
boldly that we know Messrs. Kann, Son A
Co. will offer- special prices in Ladies’ and
Cfiilfireq’s Cloaks. But to come back to our
starting point, we would'say in conclusion
that we offer to Messrs. Kann, Son A Co. our
admiration in which they have so successfully
started their new venture, and we wish them
a continued success.

Berret expresses “regret at inadvertence
in senseless, fruitless controversy” of our
eternal process. Well, Berret was further
from our thoughts than the scene of earth
quakes, of which we were writing, when we
said they were the result of eternal process
moving on. Berret quoted the latter sentence
and then intruded as follows; “This takes
our breath. Is there no balm in Gilead ?
Does not omniscience see, and omnipotence
guide?” But more later. And now he says
we have mania iu saying we were arraigned.
He says we “speak truthfully in saying he had
night-mare when he blundered across the
danger line of ceaseless, self-propelling
process.” We never could see any legitimate
reason why he intruded and obtruded, the
senseless, fruitless controversion at our eternal
process. His saying we have eternal process
on the brain is but proof that we have kept
to the point he fruitlessly attempted to con
trovert; while on his part, it has been this
thing and that thing, one thing and another
thing, something and nothing, and everything
and anything oat of which he could manipu
late a “conglomeration” which he would hurl
at us and then change base. In proof we
we give what Berret now says, as follows:
“The only point at issue is, whether polar
contraction is the cause of equatorial disten
tion or the latter the cause of the former?”
Why this point has not been mooted—can
not be—has no existence only as the result of
eternal process, hence is not pertinent to the
first issue. And if Berret hugs the belt while
we compress the poles, it would be just as
fruitless as arguing the question, “If a fence
rail has too ends, how has it any beginning? ’
For an end cannot be a beginning, and the
intermediate is neither beginning nor end. If
we say one and two make three, Berret demurs
and says n—o —not that way —two and one
make three; and so be has bandied us about
all around creation. In fact when he so hor
roringly gasped—“breath taken—more later”
—raising his first point, approaching which
we found him at another, so has he continued
till he has made a few less than the points of
the compass; and when we would have him
come back to the point that took his breath,
he says, “not at all, for after all, it amounts
to nothing at all, but eternal process, and that
is all.” And we say, if it is all after all, that
Berret has knocked all the bottom out of eter
nal process —no not at all; but according to
his own showing, eternal process knocked all
the wind out of Berret Day.

Union Bridge, Dec. 7, 1886.
Messrs. Editors :—Several weeks ago
there appeared in your paper this problem,
viz: “A and B buy 100 acres of land for
$200; one part suits A better for his purpose
than the other, and he agrees to pay 50 cents
per acre more for it Each, however, invests
SIOO. How much did each get, and what
was the price paid by each per acre?” A
week or two following its insertion the answer
appeared as follows: A took 40 acres at
$2.50 per acre and 860 acres at sl.66£*. In j
this solution the author has failed to state the
cause of the discrepencies that at sight appear,
for the difference in two prices according to
the conditions is not 50 cents, nor do the
prices make an average of $2 per acre, the
buying price. This being so, a student just
learning mathematics is not benefited much
by what has been stated. The author of it
may have forgotten this part. This proposi
tion and similar ones ought not to be passed
without accompanied with further explana
tion. The following example is one of the
same class, viz: A B and C buy 300 acres
of land for S9OO, each paying equal amounts.
B agrees to pay $1 per acre more than A and
C, $2 per acre more than A. How much does
each buy and at what price per acre ? I have
not given this example to test anyone s skill,
but as it is one of class referred to, would be
pleased if some one would give a solution and
describe the difference that exists between the
two examples. Student.
Our correspondent is mistaken. That is
not the answer. The exact answer cannot be
i given, as was stated two weeks ago. —Bns.

by which three dwellings were demolished,
the inmates barely escaping with their lives.
The cave-in covers an area of one and one
half acres, the surface having settled some
fifteen feet. The cause of the accident is
attributed to the “robbing’’ of pillars in the
mine underneath.
Reuben Hill and his three sons were killed
on Tuesday afternoon at a railroad crossing
near Laporte, Indiana. Hill’s little daughter
had one of her legs broken at the same time.
The family were in a wagon, crossing the
railroad, and were prevented from seeing ap
proaching trains by an occupied side track.
Hill’s wife died recently, so the daughter
crippled on Tuesday is the sole survivor of
| the family.
I When Jane Wheller was murdered in Cleve
! land, Ohio, last month, her husband accused
j Patrick Graves of being her murderer,
i Graves was honorably acquitted on the pre
| liminary examination, ana on Saturday he
j entered suits against Wheller for damages,
a ££ re £ at i n £ $125,000 —$100,000 for malicious
arrest and $25,000 for injured reputation.
Wheller is also under arrest for the murder
of his wife. He is over 80 years of age.
The Sunday law was enforced in Indianap
olis on Sunday, so that something to eat and
i a coffin were about the only things it was
i possible to buy. It was the retaliating work
of the Liquor League. Strangers who arrived
I in the city were compelled to go to their
j hotels on foot, as hack drivers dare not con
vey them. Cigars could not be bought at any
of the 800 stores where they are regularly
I sold and newspapers could be purchased at
only two stands.
A Syracuse (N. Y.) dispatch says: “Miss
I Winnie Davis, daughter of Hon. Jefferson
j Davis, who has been visiting Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Emery in this city for the past four
weeks, left for New York Sunday, and has

Miss Davis will visit friends in New York
during the rest of the month and it is expected
will return to Syracuse for another visit in
i January. During her stay in Syracuse she
has been the recipient of many social honors,
I u(J has a made a pleasing impression upon

Advantages op
ADVERTISING.
Advertising in the newspaper press is to
trade and business what the sun is to the
solar system, giving light, heat and motion
to all the planetary world* It is like the cir
culation of the blood in the human economy,
imparting life, vigor and activity to the sys
tem. Without it there would be no life, but
decay, stagnation and death. If the business
man wants a healthy, active, paying business,
he must advertise and certify the public of
the same. He must mention his goods, wares
and merchandise, and invite public attention
to his establishment. The holidays are ap
proaching, and many persons are thinking of
what they shall buy and where they sSallbuy
it. Now is the time to advertise. A good
advertisement will pay better than any invest
ment you can make. Try it. Our Westmin
ster merchants and business men who adver
tise most freely are the men who are most
prosperous and making money the fastest.
This is natural and according to reason.
They are seeking to increase their trade, and
are inviting everybody, through the medium
of the press, to come and examine their stock
and learn their prices. Men cannot do an
extensive business in these pushing times by
sitting down and folding their arms and wait
ing for business to come to them. They
must go to business. They must use the
means at hand to invite business, and after
they have done that they must sell their goods
at such prices as will induce their customers
to call again.
Let everybody advertise who has anything
to sell, or who wishes to buy. The news
paper is the medium of communication be
tween the people, and they should make
known their wants and desires through its
columns. If a man wants to buy or to sell a
farm or a house, a horse or a cow, or anything
else, let him advertise. It is the cheapest and
speediest way of accomplishing his purpose.
A dealer in cattle said he used to ride here
and there in search of stock, and often through
inclement weather and at great inconvenience.
He quit it aud advertised, and now he says he
can remain at home, and those who have
cattle to sell will call to see him, and he can
buy all the cattle he wants simply by means
of advertising. We met a man, recently, who
wanted a farm. He had been riding and
hunting for one in various parts of the county,
and inquiring of all the people he met as to
who had a farm for sale. We suggested to
him to advertise. He did so, and in a very
brief time he had the offer of a dozen, at a far
less expense and less effort than he had pre
viously employed to find one. This is one of
the chief uses aud conveniences of the news
paper press. It facilitates trade and business
between the people, and frequently between
those who are miles apart, and rarely see
■■■
The season for pnblic sales of personal
property is approaching. Some are wanting
to buy, in order to begin farming, and others
are wanting to sell, in order to quit farming.
No man can sell his property to the best ad
vantage who fails to advertise it in a news
paper. He may print and distribute as many
handbills as he pleases, but he cannot reach
one-twentieth of the people by handbill that
he will be able to reach through the news
paper ; nor will he be able to get as good
prices for his property by handbill as by
newspaper advertisement. If you want the
BEST PRICES for your property you must
use handbills and the newspaper also, not a
mere outline or skeleton of an advertisement,
but a full list of all the articles you have to
sell, A man may think this or that article is
too trifling or small to enumerate, but it may
be that very article that a neighbor wants,
and which will induce him to attend the sale
and buy, along with other things. Thorough
advertising is the best way to attract a large
crowd at a public sale, and a large crowd is
the best way to get good prices for your prop
erty. It will pay the cost of advertising many
times over. We have watched the effect of
advertising upon sales of personal property
for many years, and we have never known
thorough advertising to fail to bring good
prices. Some years ago a gentleman in this
county, about to discontinue farming on a
rented farm, offered to his landlord, to whom
he was somewhat indebted, all his personal
property for the sum of $1,400. VneTan Jlord
refused the offer. The owner put it op at
public sale himself, after thoroughly adver
tising it by handbill and in the Advocate, and
the property brought him $2,300, a gain of
S9OO by advertising in the newspapers. There
is nothing that pays a better per cent, than
printers’ ink used in this way. Try it and
prove it. The Advocate is a weekly visitor
to over 1,600 families in Carroll county, and
has a large number of subscribers in adjoining
counties.
If, however, you prefer to advertise your
sales by handbills only, the Advocate Office *
has a larger assortment of job type than any/
other in the state outside of Baltimore. Sef
eral large and beautiful fonts have been pijr
chased recently, which, together with cuts,
borders, Ac., are used in printing showy aid
attractive bills.
