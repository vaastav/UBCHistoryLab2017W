HOW IT LOOH.3XN HBl'SEAT.
Mr. Benjamin IIarrism and re-.
putdiciii party will soon be as discour
aged over their fence and fiaud bill
last resort as over their tariff and liu
amdal record.
The farmers1 alliance has officially,
fpccitically an! unanimously cctidemu-
ed the force bill mtt:age aid its au
thor. The country does not respond to tle
presidents' message. No moro public
meetings are tailed and no casual
gatherings applaud the force bill po
licy. Jepartraeiit reports and president's
mesaccs were this year weuk beyond
example. They apohgized for a ceu
stis which the two tir&t American au
thorities have pronounced palpably
imperfect and worthless for statisti
cal pu looses. They had uo more to say
for the tariif. law than that ic hud
been misrepresented, ami in saying bo
iney introduced misrepre.-entafions of
cunent business knowledge. The btd
lion purchase bill was defended in the
same spiritless manner. A nooitify
ing foreign policy was the basis of an
other apology. High prices tor wheat,
corn and potatoes, caused by an ex
tremely short crop, were credited to
the republicans.
Jdeport3 and messages had a sort of
hopeless, beg-your-pardou time on
every pape. No financial policy to
meet the demands of agriculture and
business was su,:gebtive. Jso te.sui-
es for giving money value to Ameri
can productions by developing mar
kets and supplying internal facilities
were claburaied or even indicated.
The reptililican party is prostrate be
fore public opinion.
leaving public opinion Mr. Harrison
turns to a force bill to capture votes
his party cannot win from the country's
free whl. Ho urges the majority he
fore it dies to put into his hands mach
inery for marh:ding an ignorant color
ed vi-te ar.d seizing the billet boxes ia
the south. '
llo and his friends wi'l grow very
.i:.iCia sere before they get the force
hill into operation. 0:i that issue
very few states will remain in the re
publican coliimn. The fanners have
raised a w.arning hand. Business
men are against violence and distnrl;
cd relations between north and south.
All the woikioinen,s organization-
are with the alliance o;i this sub

Some cf tite protectionists c?uitn
that the manufacturers of this coun

to shut out foreign articles; and yec
these same protectionists ure in favor
of subsidizing vessels to open up trade

can they compete with the world in

Senator Gorman, vrho proved him
self such'an able and capable leader
during tiie last pension of congress,
was by general coii.sfiit recognized as
i-ouiiuander in chief of the democratic
senat'Tial army as soon as it became
evident that Mr. llanison uiul -the
radica republlcaa leaders has sue
ceede I in whippn.g the weak-kneed

' B a curious coinc idence Mr. Blaine
chai.ped to be a visitor to the diplo
mauc gauery or loe bcnate, in wr.i
pany w ith the Brazilian naval ofdeers
who have been visiting us,- just at the
time when the Force bill was. being
read, and it must have required all his
self " possession to prevent the con
tempt he feels for that measure from
showing itself iu his countenance
JTr. Harrison has caused it to be
semi-oliici;lly hinted that he would
veto a free silver coinage bill should
congress pass one, but thut fact lias
not prevented a. dozen or more sena
tors and repiesentatives, at least half
of thcin republicans, from introducing
bills providing for free coinage, and
Senator Teller has stated that he has
positive assurances that such a bill
will pass the senate, and that he be
lieves it will alao go through the
llOUU.
One bill has been introduced in the
senate by a republican Senator Cul
iom which most of the democrats
would gladly vote for, if they could
get a chance. It provides for one
cent letter postage, which Mr. Har
rison, in his anxiety to talk partisan
politics, forgot to even mtnlion in his
message.
Quite a number of bills have been
introduced in the house and senate to
repeal" certain sections of the McKin
ley tariff at, one of the most notable
of which is that introduced by Kepre
santative McCreary, of Kentucky, to
put what be very aptly calls the seven
blessings of mankind, tin and tin phtte,
cotton ties, wgr'cultural implements
and edged tools, binders twine, blan
kets, worsted for men and women's
Clothing and salt, upon the free list.
T;e puma -on appropriation till for
Uie usual year beginning July 1,
lias b:-en reported to the house. It
L'l i""pii ates $135,ot'0,Tti'5, and those
well ii. formed say that it is less by
from thirty to seventy millions of dol
lars than will be required to pay the
pensions during the year. Jjook out
for music when this bill is discussed
in the house,
The h uise, after one day spent in
liUibustering and one in discussion,
passed the inter-national copj right
bill by a Vote of 130 to 95.
Persuasion, threats and bribery, cn
the part of t!ie administration, by the
promise of future patrot age, has so
far failed to get together a quorum of
republicans iu the house. Without1
that republican quorum no partisan
legisJatijn will be allotted to go
through the house.
Dr. KoV Dicoverr
The liquid employed by Dr. Koch is
perhaps only a concentrated solution
of a special ptomaines extracted from
the culture of the turbereulous hucil
lus. The action ptomaine injected un
der the skin of animals is generally
slower than tht which t'ollr.ws the in
jection of alkaloids. Dr. Koch's liquid
injected hi the same manner iu man
produces a variety of symptoms ap
pearing only after four or five hours.
This is perhaps an indication of what
it is. In titis hypothesis the ptomaine
injected consecutively during severaf
weeks into the. system would modify
the medium of growth of the tubercu
lous bacillus no as to check its develop
ment. Tha cells cf the organism,
finding no more obstacles, would re
gain strength. Thut would explain
why the ptomaine injected oIHcacious
ly under the skin remains without ef
fect when introduced through the di
gestive organs, as seems established
in regard to the substance used by
lJr. Koch. This difference of action
doC3 not exist iu a (similar degtee in
the case of metulic substances. The
future will soon teach us the truth
about the nature and real value of the
antidote used by the illustrious Ger
man 1 rofessor,and if the hope we have
cherished be not a vain one, we fchali
leicfcive before long how important,
from a social and economical stamU
point, the care of tubercultsis is. V. o
know that in the civilized woild more
than a million persona die annually in
middle age, their lives being cut short
by this terrible L-acillus. From the re
sults aUeady obtained we way hote
that nil attacks of tuberculosis, pul
monary or other, can be cheeked, at
least in t lie beginning. Dr. Giviert
