TUB LOUISIANA QUESTION BOMMAIIILT DISPOSED OF.
OpccuU DltoaUh tn Tht Chu aqo Frtoune.
Washington, D. C., Doc. C.—Tbo Democrats
of tbo House barely oocapod committing a fatal
political blunder. Their cowardice and not their
piinciplea prevented. Tbo loaders aud tbo mo.
joiity of tbeir party sought to open up tbo Lou
isiana question by raising a question no to tbu
validity of tho Kellogg Government, by, In fact,
duuyioß Us validity. Thin they proposed to do
by preventing Morey, a llepublicnn from Louis
iana, from being sworn in, and by sending lam
to too Committee on Elections. They did not
succeed. Fernando Wood, with an assurance
wbicb showed bis confidence in tbo majoiity
behind him, claimed tbo Bourbon leadership,
lie fonnd before tbo day bad ended that bla
leadership was repudiated and b!s political sa
gacity impeached, lie objected to tbo swearing
in of Morey, of Louisiana, and offered a resolu
tion referring tho matter of tbo contcet between
Morey and William D. Spencer to the Committee
on Elections, to report which of said claimant*
was entitled to the seat, Both of those gentle
men held corlifioatos from both Kellogg aud Me-
Enrty, and bo was opposed to giving either mao
a seat until tbo Committee bad decided tbo
question. Tbo Republicans wore
QUICK TO BEE TUEIR VANTAGE ABOUND,
and showed that they bad at least two men equal
to tbo rote—Blaine aud Wheeler. Blaine waa
quick upon bis foot. Tbo debate upon tbo
Louisiana question, which, it bad been trap*
posed, was forever ended, seorbed about to bo
opened. The Democrats seemed prepared to
repudiate the Wheeler compromise. UcEnory
bad douo no official act except to sign creden
tials. Lamar, to tbo surprise of all tbo old
House, came to tbo support of Wood, and en
deavored to secure tbo reopening of the
cose and tbo defeat of tbo Wheeler
compromise. Lamar’s action to-day was tbo
more surprising from bis professed conservative
views, aud bis action in tbo last Congress re
specting tbo Wheeler compromise. At least
one member of tho Wheel .*r Committee is pre
pared to state that last winter Lamar offered to
vote for tho recognition of Kellogg do facto
Governor if it was necessary to secure tbo
passage of tho resolution, which did pass, aud
which it was thought bad definitely settled tbo
Suostion, Lamar, by tils conduct to-day, ha*
onu much to lose tbo blgb esteem which fie bad
won among Republicans lor his fairness, as be
permitted partisan zeal to stultify bis own
record. Blaine saw
TUB WEAKNESS OP Z.AUAB’B POSITION,
and seized tbo opportunity to deliver one of
those eloquent and olfccllve three-minute
speeches for which bo is famous. Ho said Me-
Entry's zeal was impertinent. Ills giving a cor
lilicato was a bold, presumptuous fraud, and bo
hoped tbo dominant parly in tbo House, in tho
hot zeal of its advent to power, would not thus
ioauguiate a measure which would trample upon
Stales rights and bo an outrage upon common
deccnov. It was decided by toe House last year,
in the Louisiana adjustment, that Kellogg was
tbo legal Governor of Louisiana. Ho rented to
know now if tbe other side would now trample
upon tbo agreement so solemnly mage last win
ter, when it was undoistood that tbo Louisiana
case was to be considered settled.
Holman, of Indiana. first made a broak lo tho
Democratic ranks. Ho said tbo House knew
that (or three years Kellogg bad been tbo acting
and do facto Governor of the Stale. As to tbo
do Jure question, that could bo settled by tbe
Courts, beroaftur. He deemed it wiser, safer,
and batter that ibe name of Mr. Morey be placed
on tbe rolls and tbo member ewom in. Tbe roll
call was demanded on ordering tbe mam ques
tion. Tbo result was: yous, 133; naye, IJ4
several Democrats near tbo loot of tbo ioll-oall
voting no, and
INDICATING A SUDDEN CHANGE OP POLICY
on that aide. Mr. Wood’s motion was then
rejected without division, and ou motion of Mr.
Blame, Mr. Morey was admitted and eworn in.
There baa seldom boon a more conspicuous de
feat of a leader. Tbe Democrats diecoveted tbe
probable political effect of Wood’s action, and
tulned with tho Uepuollcaos to defeat bun. Tbo
.ouisiana question has not yet been reopened,
and tbe sceptre bas fallen from Wood’s bauds.
[ (o ttu a uociaUd i rut. 1
Washington, D. C., Deo. o.— ln tbe House
early in tbe day Ur. Wood offered a resolution
referring tbo credentials of Morey and Bpoocer
to tbe Commutes ou Elections, with instructions
to report which of them is entitled to tbo seat.
He said be did not propose to raise the question
aa to who was tbe local Governor of Louisiana.
It was nut pertinent to tbit inquiry to determine
that question, the sole aud eiciusivo queeueu
being aa to wbat form of credentials tbe re
spective claimants presented.
Ur. Blame declared that there was no more
oQlcial ground for speaking of Jobu MoEnory as
Governor of Louisiana than there was for speak
mg of the gentleman (Wood) as Governor of
New York. No depaameuk of the Government
bad ever recognized McEuery, and the House
lo*t session, by a very Urge vote, to which
many gentlemen ou tbe Democratic side of
tbe douse were consenting, and many of them
anxious that tbe resolution should pass, baj
solemnly recognized Kellogg u Governor of
Louimana, and for (ho gentleman from Now
Trork to make a stalomoM that the Governor
ship of LouHisna nan slid s tnsltor of doubt,
or waa sliil in suspense, was to place the Houso
>d a wrong position. Ho thought that (bo
Clerk would hive Lecn peifectly justified in
tearing up nn waste r-eper the credentials signed
I>T McEucrv. Ho trusted that the gentleman
from Now York did not wish to open tho whole
Louisiana case on this question.
•' lr * Wood replied that tho pipers in tho case
of all the members from Louisiana weietbeui*
eel res fiullicient answer to the gentleman s for if
there wtti no pos-udo question an to who wan
Govornor of Louisiana, why nan it that all mem*
hern irom that Htato had deemed it necessary to
obtain a certificate of McKncry. They have all
deemed it important to come hero clothed with
certificates from each oi thesa so-called Gov
ernors. ilo did not propose to raise on this in
quiry (he question an to who was or who was not
Govornor of Louisiana, T.io question (o be
determined m the fir«t place was wholhor Morov
presented credentials that cot.tied bim to a seat
on this floor.
.'lr. Wlieclor said he had trusted that tho ques
tion as to who was Governor of Louisiana had
heou set at rest, at leant until a general election,
and regretted (hat for a paltiy advantage it
sliould i.o again raised. Not onlv had Kellogg
been recognized ns Governor of Louisiana nv
tho President of tho United States and by both
Houses, hut also by tho people of Louisiana,
and by a sulctnu statute passed by its Legisla
ture at its oxtra tension held last April. Re
side;', tins man Spencer had absolutely fdre
dosed litmHelf by having mado himself a con
testant of Frcyo. Is tlic-ro on the record since
too election held in Ibi3 m Louisiana a singlo
"tlicial act of McEucry except (bis single onoof
signing llioso certificates ? Not one.
Mr. Wood remarked that the question settled
lail ncaainn bad been confined entirely to tbo
relations of the Legislature, not to the election
of Governor.
Mr. Lamar said that tlio Clerk of tho House
had made known to the lioueo tbo oxthluice of
a cmilr.ivciay, not only with reference to tbo
merits of tbo question, but with reference to tho
ptima-facio right to mt in tbs House. “Tho
ilouao nan in pomosmoq of tbo fact that there
was cuch a controversy. It might bo a very biqi
plo and a vciy intelligible question, but atill it
was u question, of law as as to whether
this coitilieato was signed hr ttio proper
Governor or not. It had been crjstnhzcd iuu> a
regular pnrharncnluty law that & question in*
prinu-fftcie riffht, aa well an tho merits
r f the cate, thouidbo referred to the Committee
on Elections.
Mr. iTaino asked Mr, Lamar whether in tbo
history of tin* House he kuu.v of any ca»o where
tho credentials, or pseudo crjclonimls, of a mem
ber, signed by a protended Governor who bad
uovor boon recognized as Governor by ony de
railment of tbo United .States, or by his own
Fti.tp. bad boon icfsrred to a commit
tee. Hu trusted that ins friend (Luamj, with
bis well-known moderation, would retrain bid
party from placing on record such an outrage,
iiot k onlyou Statu righto, of which hu (Lamar)
was eucb an csnmplai and advocate, but on tbo
lulos ot common decency as noli.
Mr. Lamarrumarkod that tbo question whether
0110 of lbo.-o | reloaded Governors w&a tbo real
Governor or not was tbo very question to bo ro
les rod to tbo Committee.
Mr. Blaine—Then 1 understand tbo gentleman
tomean that this is the lonnal opening of tho
ivholu Louisiana case, and not merely a question
as to the seat of a member.
Mr. Lamar—Tbo gentleman siinnly under
stands that a question winch tbo
C erk of tbo Hondo has remitted to the
Houso—whether or not it involves tbo other
question os to tbo validity of tbo Gubernatorial
incumbent ol Louisiana m a question waiuU
ought not to bo decided informally or by the
moro seating of a member, but ought to be
formally referred to a committed and gravely
and maturely decided.
Mr. Blaiuu aibed whether it was not a nutter
of history that last year, in whul was known as
tbo Louisiana adjustment, it was perfectly un
derstood that tbu votu of tbo Houso declaring
Kellogg to bo Governor was a final
settlement, aud whether tuo vonor
alio gentleman Horn Georgia (Stephens)
tho very Ncilor of tbu Democratic party, bad
nut voted with tbu Republicans, in order avow
edly that it might ho a final Hottlem&ut. Did
bis honorable friend (Lamtr) come iicrc now to
bead n new movement to trample on tbo utbor
sldo of tbo agreement, and ruopaa tbo whole
case '(
Mr. Lamar admitted that there bad boon a
compromise* laut seesion, and that lint compro
mise did acknowledge Kellogg as Acliug-Oovor

come up through a formal arraignment by
the Alabama Legislature. Tho Democrats
propose to try to secure tho ex

Hticli n scheme they hor.Q to reduce tho Repub

make the Senate stand s Op

from the four Stales named, which would give
(he Republicans a majority of two. com,ting
Alcorn, of Mississippi, and Hamilton, of Texas,
neither of whom is regarded ns strong in tho

that many may be saved. The operatives
in all tho collieries of tbe district
