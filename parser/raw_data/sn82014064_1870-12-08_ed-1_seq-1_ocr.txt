President** Octiagc,
Frotn the Cinetnnati Gazette.
The message treats of many departmental
tod diplomatic details, together with general
foreign and domestic questions, and Las an
uuccmmou vatiety of matters. The President
urges the anmsation of Sau Domingo with a
hat of henefite to come from It. and of calam
ities without it, which mikes out that it is vt.
tal to our national existence. Be eaya by It
we shall command the seas, all the other |a
lande, South America, and our own coast;
while without it we command nothing
and are commanded by everything; that
it will {pay the national debt with
out taxing the people, will cut off one hon
ored millions of import*, and teetore onrahip
ping and the balance of trade, while without it
he cannot see bow we can pay the debt; that
it will abolish slavery in Cuba. Bono IVco and
Brazil, will settle tbe war in Cuba, will carry
out the Monroe doctrine, and thus give that
good man rest in his sepulchre; will support
lenmillione in luxury, will give ua cheap
oesaariee, and force all tbe other countries to
tny our products, and will give this country a
rapid stride toward greatness.
Bo fears that national existence will be in
supportable without Saa Domingo, and that If
we do not take this prize some other power
will; therefore be adrivee annexation on the
joint resolution method which General BoHer
nropceed when it ap pet red that the treaty
could not command two-tb'rds of the Senate.
This mode has another unpleasant odor, from
the use made of it in tbe annexation of Texas,
to bring on a war with Mexico, which waa not
tat all necessary to the annexation.
TVe reject the President's anxiety for this
annexation, for bo believes (bataUtnose bone
fits would flow from it. Bat be is deceived by
advtstartrtwbctie asuoecrupuloasly pursuing
tbe'r o*n private speculations in tblspurcbiee
aa Gould and Fisk were when they perrnaded
him that the welfare of the country required 1
that Ihe Treasury sales of gold should be
limited so asto let gold go up and good prices
prevail.
The greater commands the less. Our conti
nent commands tbe adjacent iaies. Not ona of
them could beheld against txs save by a superior
navy, ard a superior navy would take it if we
bad It. Tbe expor * are lees than two millions,
toe people indolent md turbulent, the cli
mate unhealthy to whites; it will support a
people in luxury, because they are contest
»itb indolence stay spontaneous fruits; but it
can never be made to pay to os tbe cost of
lidding It. If snr foreign power wants to try
It. let us bid them welcome. Ou r continent
of fotly miQions commands it. Tbe world U
not turned topev-tnrvy that an adjacent island
commands a continent. And to eay that oar
fuLliedibt bangs on It is to give a poor char
acter to cur credit.

• I sir anti-able re’ilemett. The matter has
be* n barly muddled be our a:{nataag*meot.
There is no; aUt of elec'ioneering capital in
it; so we may as well deal honeetW.
Tbe fbtieg question need* a little' honest,
i earrest, stnuch forward negotiation. The
rights are by treaty, and th*re need
be t o difficulty In defining them. Tbe nou
trtosit of geode won!a not be a remedy. The
same may be said of onrrigbtto the Darin*
(too cf tbs St. Lawrence. We want diaio
itatie negotiation. We believe we have a
vabd cl»hn t o thia navigation, by the principles
cf pul be law. Tbe statement of tbe fishery
complaints, and of th* SL Lawrence question,
an m a different style from other parts of
ibemeeeage, and are probably from the De
partment of State.
Tbe President think* we moat rite op the
boje of miring ow etd££ifi| U (os poor KM
sndmnet look to those more remote. Bnt
under the operation of the same causes the
same competition wOI oast us everywhere.
Tbe right way is to remove the cause that
make® shipboßdlxifyaad nangiUog tooooatly
fer Americans.
Be ihlxxks Congrraa Jhonld legialata to re
store specie that m a few short
year* will be known
no more, and that tbe slßurp*, the noise on
spirits and tobacco, and On tariff o&lnxnriea
» bichperacna can diapemb with, will famish
euffirient revenue.
This is well; bnt snch luxuries are already
tired to the smuggling pomt; and it the tazoa
on tea, eeffee sen sugar acd on other arti
cles merer (he necessity of living were
stricken out, the] amount \ of] revenue left
wonld he )sa« than 4jty mQifona.
The Pi aeideot sayt be does not know whai
revecne reform is. This is patent. He wants
a taiiff that will enoouraga boms D rod actum,
afford living wage*, in octotrast to the pauper
labor ol the old world. Tost is tbe tariff the
Revenue Reformers are after. Hr. Wells
osysit wBl he enough to discos* (he
question of free trade or protection when oor
Ur ff i® made to protect some labor.
Tbe Pro ident declares himself ardently for
a reform in the cml service, so aa to provide
for both appointment and tenure, and relieve
Congressmen from this thankless labor of
procuring appoinrmeefs.
This ardent declaration confounds tbe flun
key journals who, upon the retirement of Sec
retary Cox, oonenzded tbs President ms op
posed to this reform, and straightway assailed
it as a sentimental purism, and announced
that Grant was now going to run the sopA'int
meats on ibe rcls of providing tor his friend*.
Qrsn. has had no enemies ao damaging as
thete swift defenders.
Tbe me&eage runs largely to detail® taken
from the drpartmentsl report?, and fibum a
deeize to make's lull piettntkUou ot the hum*
neea of the country. I( gresteet argumenta
tive force is devoted to Bas Domingo. It con
cludes with a general statement of the policy
of tbe administration, wtuch ta everythin#
5 ttat can b« wished. In this Wi statement o
i -the role that the tariff taxation should be re*
dneed in enob amy as to give relief to the
■ greatest number, is tbe very principle of tar
[ iff reform.

Waahvvtion Conttpmdaut of thr PhitaiUlphia In-
Last Saturday afternoon your correspond*
ent p»id bia reppecta to Hon. Caxl Schurx,
Exited States Senator from iliaaooru Tbs
Fsnator occupies, with big family, ao elegant
residence on F street, between Twenfj-flrft
aoo Taentt-aceond streets. which waa. during
the {art session, a favorite resort of tbe prom*
inent men of the c» unity, aa well as tbe repre
reutauves of foreign governments at Wash*
Ington, tberrc«pttoDo of the Senator being
among the most recfuTcbe of the capi'al.
As ae entered the well-stocked library of
the Settlor. Baron tod Gorolt, tbe hortfa 1
German Minister at Washington, was just
bavitg, having had a conversation *tth tbs
Senator about tbe prevent status of tbe Eu
torean war. Baron Qerolt, from advices re*
celnd at bis legation, was of opinion that tbe
reported aneceeees of tbe French nuderTrccbn
and tbs Junction of I’aladine’s and Oucrot's
armies are canards. Tbe only press despatch
which ha credits is the official telegram of
King William to his Queen, dated Versailles,
2fr*teab«r SO.
The following conversation oocurrel be>
twetu the Senator and jour correspondent
after Baron Qerolt left. It must be stated,
however, that it was in the German language,
aid that ths words osed were translated after*
ward:*
Senator Sc bun. I know the object of your
visit, sir, and can save yon tbe trouble of
B’atfrg It; you c»me here to ‘•lnterview"
me. but lam not to be interviewed. Sines my
arrival here I have been approached by some
fifteen newspaper men, who all came with tbe
same intention.
Correspondent. Senator, I confess yon have
in a mesa ore sotmised my business, but my
object waa merely to learn wbetbsr certain
statement* made lately In a number of pa*
pets concerning you were correct or not.
Senators. Well, my friend, I know what Is
coming now; go on, then.
Correspondent. In tbe first place. Senator,
is tbe nntlifebod statement true that yon have
authoritatively denied it to be your intention
to oppose tbe present administration during
the next eeselon cf Congress ?
Ssnttor S. In some re»pecta tbo statement
is trne, while in others it is incorrect. I take
the liberty to disagree with tbe administration
on tbe question of Federal iuterferecce in
Mate poutirs. as well aa on some other points;
while again, I shall support it on general
grounds, for I want it to be diatinctly under
stood that lam a Republican. Tbe position
1 occupy, however, allows me a wider field
of action than party lines seem to
fWo to otben. I bwe been assailed
y a portion of the Radical press for my
action in tho Mi*soari election, assailed on-
jnstlv, as I stand to-day by the principles of
tLo Republican party. If Missouri is loet to
that organization it U due, to a large extent,
to the interference of the government.
C. Do you intend to oppose the adminis
tration in toe Senate next session ?
Senator S. 1 am not prepared to admit
each intentions, but I thick that questions
will arise in the Senate which may produce a
direct conflict between me and the adminis
tration.
C. \Vbat do yon think. Senator, about this
so-called third party ?
Senator S- ao intelligent observer can fail
to cotice that the question of revenue reform
will he a leading parly issue before long. It
E resents a medium course* hlch will prevail
etween youx Eastern high protective ideas
and our Western free trade notions. It di
vides the two leading parties, and creates
thereby this new (bird parly. Republicans
and Democrats compose it. both willing to
abandon dead issues. This proposed new
party favors a reduction of taxes, and a
thorough civil service reform.
?to read the dei
C. What Senators do you suppose adopt
the principled of tdis so-called third party?
Senatoi S. 1 could not answer that, for we
never had a vote yet that might be considered
ateet.
C. Senators Sumner and Trumbull eeem to
be on your side of the Senate ; are they not?
Senator 8. I rarely differ with Sumner,
while Sumner made a good move toward civil
eervioe reform lastaesaon by introducing a
bill which makes it a mirdemeanor for any
member of Congress to solicit office* for otb
er«*. or interfere with the tilling of any of the
Federal offices. 1 certainly shall support that
hill, and would even go farther.
C. Do yon believe, Senator, that another
attfznpt w'dl be made by the administration
party to ratify the San Domingo treaty :
Senators. Undoubtedly: still there seems
to be but little chance for the ratification of
the treaty as i* now stands.
C. Ton made the remark that if Missouri
wts lest to the Republican party, it was main
ly due to Federal interference in State poli
tics. Judging from that remark, von enter
tain seme doott about it being loet ?
? Senator B.—Missouri in a Republican State!
be issues that have so long divided Republi
cans and Democrats had very little to do,
however, in onr late election. Missouri is the
first State that has adopted the principles of
thie third party. 1 have no doubt but that
other West era States will follow her example.
But allow me to remark that this whole mat
ter wifi spring up in Congress during the
coming session, and the pcblic will then fully
discover not only the principles of thie new
party, bat the men composing it; so let as
drop the matter.
After conversing with the General a few
minute* longer, meetly about the European
war. we left him, as we saw that other visitors
and a large mail bag claimed his attention.
