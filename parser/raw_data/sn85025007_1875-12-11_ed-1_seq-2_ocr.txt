SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11.
The Presideul aud the Whiskey
Frauds.
The Government has ot late understood the
popular impression that the ordinary United
States district attorneys were not the proper
persons to employ when the persons accused
of crime were known to be the leaders ot the
Administration party in the sections ol the
country to which they belonged, and has gen
erally employed other counsel. Hon. A. G.
Kiddle was employed in this way in the recent
safe burglary case in Washington; and in the
pending case where United States officers made
a conspiracy to release a man named Snydor,
who had robbed Ferry's dry goods ^tore, and
it is said took part of their pay in the stolon
goods, Hon. Jeremiah M. Wilsou has been
employed as spccial eouusel, instead of District
Attorney Wells. So in the St. Louis whiskey
fraud cases, which included some officials of the
Treasury Department and Gen. Babcock, of the
President's House, in its scope, ex Senator
Henderson, of St. Louis, became special attor
ney, in place of District Attorney Dyer. Mr.
Henderson, in bis argument to the jury on the
trial of Avery, an officer of the Uuited States
Treasury, at Washington, commented with
great freedom upon the support which the
whiskey ring seemed to rely upon receiving
from General Grant. On yesterday a lengthy
session of the Cabinet was held, at which the
case of Mr. Hendersou was discussed, resulting
in a telegram being forwarded to St. Louis di
r cting his dismissal. This determination, says
the Baltimore Sun, has not produced a favora
ble impression among those who sincerely like
the injunction of the President, "Let no guilty
man escape. There can be no division of opin
ion that the language attributed to Mr. Hen
derson as used toward the President was unbe
coming under the circumstances, but it is un
den-tood that Mr. Henderson disclaimed such
language, ilis dismissal will be interpreted,
whether justly or not, as a direct attempt in
the interest of Gen. Babcock. Mr. Henderson
is thoroughly acquainted with all the facts in
connection witii the whiskey ring, aud it is
mainly through his efforts that the conviction
of the persons on trial at St. Louis has been
attained. To put in a new prosecutor at this
time, and one who is not familiar with the his
tory of the ramifications of the ring, is of course
to weaken the prosecution very much, and to
be a material point in favor of Geo. Babcock.
The Attorney General has tendered to Daniel
Glover, of St. Louis, the position of assistant
counsel for the Government, made vacant by
the removai of Mr. Hendersou. Mr. Glover is
a prominent and a pronounced Democrat.
In the Virginia contested election oase Mr.
Piatt claims that at the meeting of the Com
missioners of Nansemond county, to count tlie
returns from the precinct, 2(JG votes thrown
for him by legal voters were not counted fur
him on the alleged ground that the words,
"against the Constitutional amondmont" were
printed on the same ballot with his name aud
Cist in the same ballot-box. That notwith
standing this fact and many other rejections
of lawful votes cast for him, the returns from
the whole district, when received at the office
of the Secretary of State, still gave him a ma
jority of 294 votes, which majority was over
time by rejecting the whole vote of the county
of Prince George, whioh couQty gave him a
majority ot 425 votos, the ground of such re
jection, as stated oy the State Board, being
the fact that the Clerk of said county, in copy
ing from his books the abstract of votes re
quired by law to be forwarded to the Secretary
of the Commonwealth, did fail to copy his own
name in one place ou the said return. The re
jection of the whole vote of this county and
the -00 votes in ^ansemond left Gx?ode an ap
parent majority of 131, and the certificate was
given him.
Since its last acknowledgment the Southern
Historical Society has had some valuable addi
tions to its archives. They make the following
acknowledgments: From Gen. F. H. Smith"
An autograph letter of the late Gen. George
H. Thomas, written January IS, 18G1, in
which he mukes inquiries with a view to ap
plying tor a position in the Virginia Military
Institute on the ground that "from present ap
pearances I fear it will soon bo necessary for
me to be looking up some means of support."
General Smith states that this letter was fol
lowed by a correspondence, io whioh Major
1 homas sought a position in Virginia, and
said that he had made up his mind "never to
draw his sword against a State struggling for
its constitutional rights." Governor Letcher
finally appointed him chief of ordnance of Vir
ginia, but before the commission reached him
he accepted a place a? brigadier general iu the
United States army.
Benjamin- Franklin's printing press, which
has for many years beeD in the possession of
the Patent Office, has been dccidud to be the
property ot Mr. John 13. Murray, of New
York, to whom it was presented io 1S42 by
Harold & Son, of London. It is the iuteotiou
ol Mr. Murray to exhibit it at tho Centennial
alongside a Hoe lightning press of the latest
construction.
The agricultural reports for November and
December indicate that the corn crop is one of
the heaviest ever grown io the country; the
cotton crop, it is thought, will exceed lour mil
lion bales; the tobacco yield shows an increase
of 75 per cent, over that of 1874; the potato
crop is extraordinary, botn in quality and yield,
and the crops of bay, buckwheat, etc., have
been generally good.
The following is shown by the census of 1870
to be the value of churoh property id the
United States. It will be seen that the Pres
ident has greatly exaggerated the amount of
church property held by the different ejects,
unloss, as is quite improbable, the total of
$354,483 581, which, according to the cc o>us,
they owned in 1870, has trebled in the interval
of the past five years. This total was divided
up as follows: Methodists, $09,854,121; Ro
man Catholics, $60,985,556; Presbyterians,
$53,265,256; Baptists, $41,608,198; Episco
palians, $36,514,549; Congrcgationalists, $25,
069 098; Reformed Church, $16,134,400;
Lutherans, $14,917,747; the remaining $35,
000,000 being distributed between seventeen
| other denominations
A tolegrum to the Richmond Dispatch from
Wilmington, N. C., of December 9, says:
Fourteen negroes, some oi whom are outlaws,
were arre.-tod last uight in Marion couuty, {
South Curuliua, by a party of twonty-iive reso
lute men seut out from this city, uuder corn
maud of Capt. Kline, assistant Superinten
dent of the VVilmuigton, Carolina and Au
gusta Railroad. These men are oharged with
robbing railroad trains. The men captured
formed part of the Gibson band, who are to
Marion ouuty what the Lowerys were to Rob
eson county, io tliis State. All but one for
whom warrants were had were captured, and
so complete was the surprise that uot a gun
was tired.
The appeal taken by the Attorney General
in the case of the United States vs. The Balti
more aud Ohio Railroad as to the right of way
through the Harper's Ferry property may de
lay the final settlement of the case for several
years, though au ultimate decision in favor of
the company cannot be doubted. The action
of the Attorney General is attributed to the
fact that he is not acquainted with the merits
of the case, which was instituted by his prede
cessor, whose action was pronounced ill advised
by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The latest incideut in tlie Louisiana business
is McEuery's protest against Mr. McMillan's
abandonment of his claim to the Senatorial

contestants. McMillau derived his authority
from MeEacry, and the objection made io the
Senate t j the withdrawal of his papers is the
only obstacle to the swearing in of Pinehbaok.
McEjery talks very plainly to McMillan, and
scores him for his action.

residents of the town. One oi the new cases
yesterday, noted above, is thai of a resident of
the Third ward, reported by a physician as
having been discovered in his regular practice.

Richmond, Dec. 10, 1875.
To-day the caucus met Ibr the first tiuie and
oommeuced balloting tor the United Staf.es
Senator. The whole affair was a farce, aod '
too ridiculous to deserve further notice. The
members, or a good many of them seem to
shrink from the task of making the nomina
tion, and are eudeavoriog to stave it off, if
such would be a proper expression. Senator
Quesenberry presided, aod Mr. Swann acted
as secretary. The first resolution which waB
offered, was by Mr. Criteher, to the effect that
the first ballot be takeu without designating
any candidate. Mr. Penn offered as a substi
tute to this, that no nominating speeches be
entertained, and the person receiving the
smallest number of votes be dropped a:.d not
placed io nomination at the next succeeding
ballot. Both were voted dowu, aud it was
agreed that nominating speeches be limited to
ten minutes. Then all the members seemed
to see how much fun they could have on the
occasion. Geo. Bagwell then nominated [ion.
Fayette McMullco for Uuitcd States Si uator
and urged his claims to that position in a
real speech. Mr. Critz nominated Col. VV.
11. Winn, of Hanover county, aod Mr. Pop
ham nominated Mr. Critz. The vote was then
taken, with the following result: Critz, 10;
McMullen, 4; Wiun, 4. The conference then
adjourned until o'clock. The best humor
prevailed. Mr. Armistead Carter said solemn
ly, "men are but boys of larger growth," and
it ceitainly seemed true on this occasion.
The police of Manchester have, at length,
found the man who asrau ted and wouuded
Mr. VV. T. Tinsiey, of Chisretfield county, a
fewwciksago. He is a mulatto, and about
20 years of age. At first he denied having
anything to do with it, aud siid he knew noth
ing of it. llis last statement was, thai he
knew the parties who did the deed, and he
gave the name of one, a oripp'e, who has not
strength enough to raise his feet, much less
than to knock d"\vu and beat a mau on the
highway. Lie also told the police where they
could find Mr. Fiusly's watch and pistol, and
they recovered both. He will suffer for his
crime. The people of Chesterfield hang meu
for arson, aud send them to the penitentiary
for life for highway robbery Cooley was ex
amined to day aud sent on to the grund jury.
It seems to be very generally coueeded that
the most prominent candidates for the Senate
now, are John VV. Daniel, John VV. Johnston,
John Goode aud John Letcher, aud there are
parties here who would like to bet a demijohn
of whiskey that the first named John gets it.
It-? a good thing to be named Johu now.

Thomas llt-nderson, his nephew, iu cousidera
tiou of a debt ol'lilty dollars duo by the former
to the latter, and for the fuither consideration
of a support, with the attentions of a servant
to be furnished by Henderson, during the life
of the grautor. At the time this coutraot was
entered into Moore was about seventy-six years
of age, very infirm, without a family, and
much embatrassed with debt. It was iu proof
ihat Henderson, subsequent to the execution
of the deed, paid off judgments atrainst Moore
to the amount ol' six or seven huudrcd dollars,
and he also made advancements to a consider
able amount to the support and maintenance
of Moore. There is no proof that Henderson
at the time of the execution of the deed kuew
of any indebtedness ou the part of Moore. The
bill was filed by a creditor ol the latter to va
cate the deed tor fraud. As the ease presents
some interesting questions of law we give au
extended abstract of the opiuioo of the court
as delivered by J udge Staples:
"The only question we are to consider is j
whether the deed constitutes a valid security
tor advances made and expenses incurred by
the granteo in support ol the grantor as against
creditors whoso debts wore contracted prior to
its execution. There is no question that if those
creditors had interposed before any advances
were made by the grantee in performance of
his contract acourtof equity would have vacated
the deo.t and held tho property subject to the
claims of croditors. As, however, they did not
so interpose, the question is presented in an en
tirely different aspect.
"A conveyance of property in consideration
of an agreement to support the grantor is not
regarded in law as voluntary. As it is impossi
bie to say how long tho grantor may live or
what expenses tho grantee must necessarily in
cur, it is impossible to say that the considera
tion is inadequate unless, indeed, tho services to
be rendered are greatly disproportionate to the
estate conveyed. Such conveyances are, there
fore, treated as founded on valuable considera
tion
"No rule is bettor settled than that in order
to vitiate a conveyance the fraudulent design of
the grantor must be known to the grantee.
When there is actual fraud, both parties con
curring, the deed is uttorly void ab initio, and
it is not permitted to stand as a security for any
purpose. In no instance will tho courts afford
any indemnity to a particeps criminis in case of
actual fraud. When, however, tho deed is
merely constructively fraudulent, or when the
grantee has acted bona fide, having no partici
pation in the fraud, the deed is valid as a secur
ity for what is justly due the grantee, or for
b^na tide advancements made by him subse
quent to its execution.
" This doctrine is n t only just and reasonable
in itself, but ;s supported by great weight of au
thority. In support of this view tho learned
judge cit^s and comments upon numerous cases.
Applying those principles to the case under
corsideration, he proceeds to show that Hen
derson was an innocent purchaser, having no
notice of tho debt in controversy, or, indeed, of
any indebtedness on the part ot the vendor; that
Moore's liability ns one of tho sureties of Marr
was entirely contingent, depending upon the
solvency of the principa and of his co-sureties
?all of which was uncertain, and of which it
did not appear that Henderson had the slightest
information. Besides all this, the conduct of
the complainant was well calculat- d to delude
Henderson into a feeling of absolute security.
Mo execution was ever issued upon the judg
ment against Moore; no effort nitde t->onforco
the judgment; it was never docketed; no notice
given of it, and uo e'aim asserted against the
property or against Henderson, notwithstanding
the deed under which he claimed was duly re
corded. It is very true that a creditor does not
ratify a fraud by doing nothing. And while the
contract originally may be a nullity, as to his
rights by its performance it may be very far
from b*ing a nullity; for if ho b<i not prompt in
assorting his claims the property may be so ??'
factually disposed of that ho Can never reach ii
In Qi.tirn confidence of the validity of hi* con
tract, Henderson paid large sums of money
without a word ol warning from those who
ought to havo been diligent and prompt in no
tion lie may bo guilty of fraud; but the re
cord does not show it. As a charge of fraud is
Against the presumption of honesty, the courts
require to sustain it proof of the clearest and
most satisfactory character.
"it is very true that juclgmont was recovered
against Moore before any advances wore made
| by Henderson towards the support of the for
mer; but the title conveyed by thu deed wa? not
thereby divested. A judgment constitute no
interest in the land, nor does it confer any right
of property therein.
"The legal title having rested in the granteu
by operation of the deed it was good against all
the world except the credit >rs, who might have
avoided it by proceedings instituted in duetino-.
As to them the deed was not void ab initio, but
meroly avoidable, and when vacated only void
trom the time of the decree so declaring. Kve:v
advance lu ide by the grantee for tho beneUt of
Moore was a payment of tho purchase money
uro tanto. And if these payments wore made
in good faith then their validity is not atfoet-d
by the mere existence of a judgment agYm-t t;.e
grantor, of which th*? purchaser had no noti< <?.
The latter having paid nearly tho value of the
ptoperty, and tho allegation of fraud being posi
tively denied a,id unsupported by proof, the re
suit is a reversal oi the decree and a dismissal ?i
the bib."
The counsel for appellant wore Messrs. Se..u
and Brooke, and for the appellee General Kpp*
Hunton.
