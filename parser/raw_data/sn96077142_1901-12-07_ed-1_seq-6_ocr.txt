The following Is a comprehensive sum
mary of President lloosevelt's message to
congress:
The president begins his first annual
communication with an official announce
ment of the death of the late President
McKinley, and a eulogy of his former
chlf In which he says:
"It Is not too much to say that at the
time of President McKlnley'a death, he
was the most widely-loved man In all the
United States, while we have never had
any public man of his position who has
been so wholly freo from the bitter ani
mosities incident to publio life. His po
litical opponents were the first to bear
the heartlest-and most generous tribute
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity'
In public life he united the tender affec
tions and home virtues which are all
important In the makeup of natlonul
character. A gallant soldier In the great
war for the union, he alxo shone a an
example to all our people because of his
conduct In the most sm-red and Intimate
of homo relation. There could be no
personal hatred of him. for he never act
ed with aucht but consideration for the
welfare of others. No one could fall to
respect him who knew him In public or
private life. The defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek to excuse their
criminality by asserting that It Is exer
cised for political ends Inveigh against
wealth and Irresponsible power. Hut for
this assassination even this base apology
cannot be uraed."
"The shock, the grief of the country, are
bitter in the minds of all who saw the
dark days while the president yet hovrr. 1
between life and death. At last the Ii-jht
whs stilled In the kindly eyes, and the
breath went from the lips that even In
mortal agony uttered no words save of
forgiveness to his murderer, of love for
Ills friends and of unfaltering trust In the
will of the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leaves
us with infinite sorrow, but with such
pride in what he had accomplished and in
his own personal character that we feel
the blow not as struck at him, but as
struck at the nation. We mourn a good
and great president who is dead, but
ukll oa muiii-n Bra nra llftnrf iin hv thn
splendid achievements of his life ami the
errand heroism with which he met his
death."
In the same connection he makes
strong recommendations' as to how the
nation should deal with anarchy. He
urges that the preaching or teaching of
anarchy be not permitted, and requests
congress to enact legislation that will
prevent anarchists from foreign countries
landing upon our shores. He would alfo
have the federal courts given jurisdiction
over any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president of the country, or ar.y
person who is In line for succession to
the presidency. He has no fear, however.
mat tne country win ever tail into an'
archy.
"The federal courts should be given lur
Ssdlction over any man who kills or at
tempts to kin tne president or any man
who by the constitution or by law Is In
line of succession for the . presidency,
while the punishment for an unsuccessful
attempt should be proportioned to the
enormity of the offense against our In
stitutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole
human race, and all mankind should band
against the anarchist. His crime should
bo made an offense against the law of
nations, like piracy and that form of man
Kteallng known as the slave trade, for It
is of far blacker Infamy than either. It
should be so declared by treaties among
all civilized powers. Such treaties would
jtive to the federal government the power
of dealing with the crime."
The Trusts.
C ' The president sees cause for congratu
lation tor the nation In the business condi
tions of the present, but sees In the "tre
mendous and highly complex Industrial
development which went on with ever ac
celerated rapidity during the latter half
of the nineteenth century" a serious social
problem for the present and future, lie
iors not believe that the old laws and old
customs are sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth of
the present time. He does not attribute
the creation of great corporate fortunes
to the existence of a protective tariff, "nor
to any other governmental action, but to
natural causes in the business world, od-
erating In other countries as they operate
In our own." In this connection he says:
"The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part of which Is wholly
without warrant. It is not true that as
the rich have grown richer the poor have
grown poor? r. On the contrary, never be
fore has the average man, the wage
worker, the farmer, the small trader,
been to well off as In this country an
at the present tlm. There have been
abuses connected with the accumulation
of wealth, yet It remains true that a for
tune accumulated In legitimate business

cially benef.ted only on condition of con
ferring immerse Incidental benefits upon
0,rru-w 8u-cef,ul 'H'fKlse of the type
which benefits all mankind can only ex
ist If the conditions are such as to offer
great prises as the rewards of success"
Hut while he realixes existing condi
tions, he emphasizes the fact that congress
In providing remedies must act with cau
tion, as the men and corporations "who
liaye built up our commerce and driven our
railroad across the continent have done
great good to our people, and . without
them the material development of which
we are so Jusdy proud could never have
taken place. Moreover, we should recog
nize the immense Importance to this ma
terial development of leaving an unham
pered as I compatible) with the publio
good the strong and forceful men upon

Inevitably resa. The slightest study of
bunlness conditions will satisfy anvnna
capable of forming a Judgment that the
personal equation Is. the most Important
factor In a business operation: that the
business ability of the man at the head of
any business concern, big or little. Is usual
ly the factor which fixes the gulf between
striking success and hopeless failure."
Another reason for caution In trust legis
lation which he give "Is to be found In the
International commercial conditions cf to
day. The same business conditions which
have produced the great aggregations of
corporate ana individual wealth have
made them very potent factors In Inter
national commercial competition, Busl
nesa concerns which have the largest
means at their disposal and are managed
by the ablest men are naturally those
which take the lead In the strife for com
mercial supremacy among the nations of
the world. America has only Just begun

we believe will more and more be hers. It
Is of the utmost Importance that this po
sition be not Jeoparded, especially at a time

ness energy and mechanical aptitude of

TO Ml
ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.
Inevitably endangers the Interests of all.
The fundamental rule In our national life,
therule which underlies all others, la that
on the whole and in the long run we shall
go up or dqwn together. There are excep
tions, and In times of prosperity some will
prosper far more and In times of adversi
ty some will suffer far more than others:
but, speaking generally, a period of good
times means that all share more or less
in them, and in a period of hard times all
feel the stress to a greater or less degree."
He points to the fact that In thu-pnst
"the Ignorant or reckless agitator has
been the really effective friend vf ithe
evils which he has been nominally oppos
ing In dealing with business Interests
for the government to undertake by
crude and ill-considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad would bo
to Incur the risk of such far-reaching na
tional disaster that It would be prefer
ablo to undertake nothing at all. The
men who demand the Impossible or the
undesirable serve as the allies of the
forces with which they are nominally at
war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor to ilnd out In rational fashion
what the wrongs really are and to what
extent and In what .-manner It Is prac
ticable to apply remedies."
Remedies for th Trust Erll.
But while he says the above Is true, he
yet sees many evils for which there should
be remedies provided. Of these evils the
chief is over capitalisation, "because of
Its many baleful consequences.' He says:
"The conviction of the American people
thai the great corporations, known ta
trusts, are In certain of their features and
tendencies hurtful to the general welfare,
is based upon sincere conviction that com
bination and concentration should be not
prohibited, but supervised and within
reasonable limits controlled, and In my
Judgment this conviction is right."
As a remedy for these evils he says:
"The first essential In determining how
to deal with thn great Industrial com
binations Is knowledge of the facts
publicity. In the Interest of the public
the government should have the right, to
Inspect and examlno the workings of
the great corporations engaged in Inter
state business. Publicity is the only sure
remedy which we can now Invoke. What
further remedies are needed in the way
of governmental regulation or taxation
can only be determined after publicity
has been obtained by process of law and
In the course of administration. The first
requisite Is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made public
to the world.
"Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and Joint stock or other associations de
pending upon any statutory law for their
existence or privileges, should be subject
to proper governmental supervision, and
full and accurate information as to their
operations should be made public regu
larly at reasonable intervals."
"The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organised in one
state, always do business In many states,
often doing very little business In the
state where they nre incorporated. There
Is utter lack of uniformity In the state
laws about them, and as no atate has
any exclusive Interest In or power over
their acts It has In practice proved im
possible to get adequate regulation
through state action. Therefore In the
Interest of tho whole people thn nation
should, without Interfering with the pow
er of the states In the matter Itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion over all corporations doing an inter
state business. This Is especially true
where the corporation derives a portion
of Its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency In Its
business. There would be no hxnlnhln In
such supervision.. Banks are subject to
it. and in their case It Is now accepted
as a simple matter of course. Indeed it
Is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not fro so far as is now the u-ith ih
supervision exercised over them by so
conservative a state as Massachusetts In
order to produce excellent results."
The president believes that It will be
possible to secure the needed remedies
for the trust evil under thj constitution
as it now exists, but if thir.
otherwise he recommends that a onstitu
tlnnai amendment be subm tted tnat will
co fer the povt? necessary.

Woald Kxclade tho Chinese.
The mesace t-on-alns a strong rectTi
niendation for t! e reenactment at .irn-e
of the present Chinese exclusion act In
which connection he says:
"Wages are higher to-day In the United
States than ever before In our history
and far higher than In any other coun
try. The standard of living Is .ilso higher
than ever before. Every effort of i.-trN-lator
and administrator should be bert to
secure the permanency of this condition
of th.ngs and Its Improvement wherever
possible. Not only must our labor be
protected by the tariff, but It should also
be protected so far aa It Is possible from
the presence In this country of anv la
borers brought over by contract or of
those who, coming freely, yet represent
a standard of living so depressed that
they can undersell our men In the labor
market and drag them to a lower level
I regard It as necessary, with this end
In view, to reenact Immediately th luw
excluding Chinese laborers and to
strengthen it wherever necessary In or
der to make Its enforcement entirely ef
fective." He also recommends such legislation by
an amendment to the Interstate commerce
law, as will protect the labor of one atate
from competing-with .the prison labor of
another state, and also that the e-nvam.
ment cease being a party to this competi
tion by not purchasing goods made either
vy convict m our or mat in wnicn women
and children are caused to work excessive
hours or at night.
In the labor unions of the present he sees
much that la good, In which connection he
says:
"very great gooa nas neon and will be
accomplished by associations or unions
of wageworkera ' when- managed with
forethought and when they comhlna in.
slstence upon their own rights with law
abiding respect for1 the rights of others.
The display of these qualities in such
bodies is a duty to the nation no less
than to the associations themselves.
Finally there must also In many cases be
action by the government In order to
safeguard the rights and Interests of all.
Under our constitution there Is much
more scope for such action by the state
and the municipality than by the nation.
But on points such as those touched on
above the national government can act.
"When all la said and done, iho rule of
brotherhood remains as the indispensable
prerequisite to success In the kind of na
tional life for which we strive. Kach
man must work for himself, and unlesa
he so works no outside help can avnll
him. But each man must remetnler also
that he Is Indeed his brother's keeper,
and that while no man who refuses ta

himself or anyone else, yit that each at
times stumbles or halts, that tach at
times needa to have the helping hand out
stretched to him. To be ptrtn.mt-ntly ef
fective aid must always t.ko the form of
helping a man to help himself, ana we
can all best help ourselves by joining to.
gather In the work that Is of common in
terest to all."
The Iwnalaratlon Laws.
If Dronounres our present Immigration
laws unsatisfactory. In which connection
he, say a "we need every honest and cl-
l.cient immigrant mtea to. Decline an
American citizen, every immigrant wno
comes her to stay, who bring h?re ,v
strong body, a good head and a resolute
purpose to dc his cuiy well in every way
and to brlnr un all c hlldren as law-abiding.
Uod-f taring members of tha community.''
uut he aays:
VThero should be a comprehensive law
enacted with the object of working a
threefcli' Improvement over our prcuent
syttem First, we should aim to cxcluio
absolutely not only all person wno are
known to he believers in anarcniauo prin
ciples or members of anarch'tttlj socle
ties, but also all persona who are of a
low moral tendency or of unsavory repu
tation. This means that we shoulJ re
quire a more thorough system of Inspec
tion abroad and a more rigid system of
exam.nitlon at our Immigrjtlon por's,
the former being especially tieceiuary.
"The second ob.Uct of a proper Immi
gration, law ought to be to veoure by a
careful and not merely perfunctory edu
cational teat some Intelligent capacity to
appreciate American Institutions and act
sanely us American citizens. This would
not keep out all anarchists, for many of
them belong to the Intelligent criminal
class, but It would do what In-elio In point
that is, tend to decrease tbe sum of Ig
norance to potent In producing the envy,
(urplclot:, malignant passion and hatred
of order out of which anarchistic senti
ment Inevitably springs. Finally all per
sons should t-e excluued who are below
a certain standard of economic Illness to
enter our Industrial field as competitors
with American labor. There should be
proper proof of ptrton&l capacity to earn
an American lUlr.it and enough money to
Iniuro a eiecent Hurt under American con
ditions. This wouk' ftcp the Influx of cheap
labor and the resulting competition which
gives rise to o much of bitterness In
American Industrial Vte. and It would drv
ui the springs of the pestilential social
conditions in our treat cities where an
archistic r-rg.-tnlxmk.n have their great
est poaslblilry of Cltiwth."
The Tariff.
The president does not desire any change
In the present tariff schedule except where
such may be made In reciprocity treaties,
and recommends the adoption of reciproc
ity treaties and the general policy of reci
procity as a means of opening the doors of
foreign nations to our commerce, in which
connection he says:
"Every application of our tariff policy to
meet cur shifting national needs must be
conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the
duties must never be reduced below the
point that will cover the difference betweeh
the labor cost here and abroad. The well
being of he wageworker is a prime consid
eration cf our entire policy of economic
legislation.
('SubJect to this proviso of the nrorjer
protection necessary to our industrial
wen being at Home the principle or reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. The phenomenal growth of our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
tne neeo. tor wider markets and for a lib
eral policy In deajlng with foreign na
tions. Whatever Is merely petty and vex
atious in the way cf trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom we dispose of our surplus products
In the long run directly or Indirectly pur
chase those surplus products by giving us
something in return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar
iff as to enablo us to take from thefh
those products which we can use without
harm to our own industries and labor or
the use of which will be of marked benefit
to us.
"The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be in connection
with those of our productions which no
longer require all of the support onco
needed' to establish them upon a sound
basis, and with those others where either
because of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond the reach of successful
competition.
"I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my
predecessor."
The Merchant Marine.
The president pronounces our merchant,
marine "discreditable to us as a nation and
insignificant to that of other nations which
we overtoil in othf-r forms of buslnees."
and savs we "shoutf not longer (-ubmlt to
conditions under which only a trifling por
tion of our great commerce Is carried in

He urges the necessity for strict economy
In expenditures, but that "our national
needs forbid us to be niggardly in the mat
ter of providing whatever Is actually nec
essary to our well-being."
Inter-Slate- Commerce.
He points to defects In the Interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend
ments to correct them, in which connection
he says:
"Those who complain of the management
of the -railways allege that established
rates are not maintained, that re
bates and similar devices are habitually
resorted to, that these preferences are
usually in ravor or tne large snipper, that
they drive out of business the smaller
competitor, that while many rates are too
low many others are excessive and that
gross preferences are made affecting both
localities and commodities. Upon the oth
er hand, the railways assert that the law
by Its very terms tends to produce many
of these Illegal practices by depriving car
riers of that right of concerted action
which they claim is necessary to estab
lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates.
"The act should be amended. Tne rail
way Is a public servant. Its rates should
be Just to and open to all shippers alike.
The government should see to it that
within Its Jurisdiction this Is so and
hniiM nrovlde a aneedv. Inexpensive and
effective remedy to that end. At the same
time It must not be forgotten that our
railways are the arteries through, which
the commercial llfeblood of this nation
flows. Nothing could be more foolish than
the enactment of legislation which would
...,nn.aaariiv interfere with the develop
ment and operation ot these commercial
agencies."
AarlcuHaral Interests.
The president cite, the forest legislation
of the psst and the great good of forest
preserves to th people, and rays they will
Inevitably be of still greater value. Con
tinuing, he says:
"At present the protection of the forest
reserves rests with the general land office,
the mapping and description of their tim
ber with the United States geological sur
vey and the preparation of plans for their
conservative use with the bureau of for
estry, which Is also chsrged with the gen
eral advancement of practical forestry In
the United States. These various func
tions should be united In the bureau of
forestry, to which they properly belorg.
The present diffusion of responsibility la
bsd from every standpoint. It prevents
that effective cooperation between the
government and the men who utilise tbe
resources of the reserves, without which
the interests of both must suffer. The
scientific bureaus generally should be put
under the department of agriculture. The
president should have by law the power
of transferring land for use as forest re
serves to the department of agriculture.
He already has such 'power In the case of
lands needed by the departments of war
and the navy."
Irrlaratlaa).
Irrigation in connection with the waste
lands ot the west is a question to which
the prenlcleiit gives consluerable attention,
and maaes Strong recommendations lor
government assistance In reclaiming tnt
waste lands by assisting In their irriga
tion and the control ot water rights wl.tr
ever tnat is possible, and of this ne says:
"In the arid region It Is water, not land,
which measures production. The western
halt of the United States would sustain a
population greater than that ot our whole
country to-oay It the waters that now run
to waste were saved and used lor irriga
tion. The forest and water problems are
perhaps the most vital Internal questions
of the United States.
"In cases where natural conditions have
been restored for a lew years vegetation
has again carpeted the ground, birds and
dter are coming back, and hundreds of
perrons, especially from the immediate
neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy
the privilege of camping. Some at least
of the forest reserves should afford per
petual protection to the native fauna and
llora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly
diminishing wild animals of the larger
kinds and free camping grounds for the
tver-lncreaslna numbers ot men apd wom
en who have learned to find rest, health
and recreation in the splendid forests and
flower-clad meadows of our mountains.
The forest reserves should be set apart
forever for the use and benefit of our peo
ple as a whole and not sacrificed to the
shortsighted greed of a few."
"The forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters of the
arid region. Great storage works are nec
essary to equalize the flow of streams and
to save tne nooa waters. Their construc
tion has been conclusively shown to be an
undertaking too vast for private effort.
Nor can it be best accomoHshed bv the in
dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching
Interstate problems are involved, andlio
resources of single states would often be
iraarqua.te. itvls properly a national
function, at least In some of Its features.
It Is an right for the national government
to make the streams and rivers of the
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage as to make useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
engineering works of another kind. The
storing of the floods in reservoirs at the
headwaters of our rivers is but an en
largement of our present policy of river
control under which levees are built on
the lower reaches of the same streams.
The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does other
public works. Where their purpose Is to
regulate the Cow of streams the water
should be turned freely into the channels
in the dry season to take the same course
under the same laws as the natural flow.
The reclamation and settlement of the
arid lands will enrich every portion of
our country, Just as the settlement cf the
Ohio and Mississippi vaiicys brougnt pros-
Derltv to the Atlantic states. 'Jhe in
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate industrial production.
while wider home markets and the trado
of Asia will consume the larger food sup-
Dlies and effectually prevent western
competition with eastern agriculture. In
deed, the nroducts of irriuatlon will be
consumed chletiy in upbuilding local cen
ters of mining ana otner industries wnicn
would otherwise not come into existence
at all. Our people as a whole will profit,
for successful homemaklng Is but another
name for the upbuilding or the nation."'
He counsels against attempting too much
at the beginning, but advises, that we let
experience on a small plan teach the pos
sibilities of a-realer undertakings. He also
cites the conditions- under which the set
tlers of the west are attempting to tiuuu
homes on these arid lands, and says:
"The security and value or tne nomes
created depend largely on the stability of
titles to water, but tpe majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rtndered In ordinary suits- at
law. With a few creditable exceptions,
the arid states have failed to provide for
the certain ard Jurt division of streams in
times of scarcity. Iax and uncertain laws
have made it possible to establish rights
to water In excess of actual uses or ne
cessities, and many streams have already
passed Into private ownership or a control
equivalent to ownership.
"Whoever control a stream practically
controls the land It renders productive, and
the doctrine of private ownership of water
apart from land cannot prevail without
causing enduring wrong. The recognition
of such ownership, which has been per
mitted to grow up In the arid regions,
should give way to a more enlightened and
larger recognition of the rights of the pub
lic In the control and disposal of the pub
lic water supplies. Laws founded upon
conditions obtaining In humid regions
where water Is too abundant to justify
hoarding It, have no proper application In
a dry country.
"In the arid state the only right to water
which should be recognised Is that of use.
In irrigation this right should attach to
the land reclaimed and be inseparable
therefrom. Granting perpetual water
rights to other than users without
compensation to the public is open to all
the objections which apply to giving away
perpetual franchises to the public utili
ties of the cities. A few of the western
states have already recognised this and
have Incorporated In their constitutions
the doctrine of perpetual state ownership
of water."
The Colonies.
Considerable attention Is given the col
onies, and especially the Philippines. This
section of the message begins by citing
the needs of Hawaii and I'orto Rico, of
which he says:
"In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
the territory on the traditional American
lines. We do not wish a region of large
entaies tilled by cheap labor. We wish a
healthy American community of men
who themselves till the farms they own.
All our legislation for the Islands should
be shaped with this end In view. The well
being of the average homemaker must
affotd the true test of the healthy devel
opment of the Islands. The land policy
should as nearly as possible be modeled
on our homestead system."
Of Porto lileo he says the Island Is thriv
ing as never before, and Is being adminis
tered efficiently and honestly. He deems
no legislation necessary except that con
cerning the publio lands of tne Island.
He calls attention to the fact that In
Cuba the Independent government of the
Island' will soon be In control, and In the
same connection urges strongly the reed
of reciprocal trade relat'ons with the new
nation, upon which subject he saysu
"In the case of Cuba there are weighty
reasons of morality and of national Inter
est why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar applications and I most earnest
ly ask your uttention to the w isdom, indeed
to the vital nVed. of providing for a sub
stantial reduction In the tariff duties on
Cuban Imports Into the United States.
Cuba has In her constitution affirmed what
we desired that she should stand In Inter
national matters In closer and more f rle nd
ly relations with us than with any other
power, and we are bound by every consid
eration of honor and expediency to pass
commercial measures In the Interest of
ber material well being."
For the Philippines he recommends much
In the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither too far nor
with too great haste, lie says: "We hope
to make our administration of the Islands
honorable to our nation by making it of the
highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves,
and as an earnest of what we Intend to do
we point to wnai we nave aone.
Already a greater measure of materiel
prosperity and of governmental honesty
and efficiency has been attained In the
Philippines than ever before In their his-
t0He aays we do not desire to do for the
tslandera "merely what hss elsewhere been
done for tropic peoples by even the best
foreign governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done for
any people of the tropica to make them
fit for self-government after the fashion of
the really free nations."
But the Idea ot the president Is that we
cannot leave the islands at this time, of
which he says: "To leave the Islands at
this time would mean that they would
fall Into a welter of murderous anarchy.
Such a desertion of duty on our -part
would be a crime against humanity."
But he believes sufficient progress has
been msde along the lines under which we
have been working In the Islands to war
rant us In parsing new legislation, but In
this connection he urges the need of cau
tion. He believes the time hss come when
the Industries of which the Islands are
cspable should be encouraged by granting
franchises for their development, arid of
this he says:
"Nothing better can be done for the Is
land! than to Introduce Industrial enter
prises. Nothing would benefit them so
much as throwing them open to Industrial
development. 'lne connection between
lulenesa and mischief Is proverbial, and the
opportunity to do remunerative work is
one of the surest preventives of war. Of
course no buslnesa man will go Into the
Philippines unlera It Is to his Interest to
do so, and It Is Immensely to the Interest
of the Islands that he should go In. It Is,
therefore necessary that the congrta
should pass laws by which the resources
of the Islands can be developed, so that
franchises (tor limited terms 01 years) can
be granted to companies-doing business In
them and every encouragement be given
to the Incoming of business mcq of t very
kind. . .
"Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to
the Philippine. The franchises must be
granted and the business permitted only
unifcr regulation which will guarantee the
Islands against any kind of Improper ex
ploitation. But the vast natural wealth
of the lslanda must be developed, and the
capital willing to develop it must be given
the opportunity. The field must be thrown
open to Individual enterprise, which has
been the real factor In the development of
every region over which our flag has flown.
Jt Is urgently necessary to enact suitable
law dealing with general transportation,
mining, banking, currency, homesteads and
the ue and ownership of the lands and
timber. These laws will give free. play to
Industrial enterprise, and- the commercial
development which will surely lollowwlll
afford to the people of the Islands the
best proofs of the sincerity of our desire
to aid thirn."
The construction of a Pacific cable Is
also urged, either that the government
lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and
the Philippines, or that an arrangement
be made by which the advantagea ac
cruing from a government cable may bo
aecured to tho government by contract
with a private cable company. This he
deems necessary for both- commercial,
political and military considerations.
The Isthntlam Canal.
. He calls ' attention to the nted of an
Isthmian canal, and says:
"Its Importance to the nation Is by no
meana limited merely to its materiu! ef
fects upon our business proserlty, nnd
yet with a view to these effects alone It
would be to the last degree important
for us Immediately to begin It. While ltd
beneficial effects would . peafhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific coast and the
gulf and south Atlantic states, It wouii
also greatly benefit other sections. It Is
emphatically a work which it Is for the
Interest of the entire country to beg.n
and complete as roon ns possible; it is
one of those great works which only a
great nation can undertake with pros
pects of success and which when done
arc not only permanent assets In the tui
tion's material Interests, but stand ng
monument to Us constructive ability.
of the new treaty recently concluded
with Kngland he rays: "I am glad to be
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with Great Britain,
conducted on both sides In a spirit of
friendliness and mutual good will ard re-spc-ct,
have resulted in my being able to
lay before the senate a treaty which It
ratified- will enable us to begin preparations
for an Isthmian car.nl at ar.y time and
w hich guarantees to this nation every right
that it has ever auked In connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton
Bulwer treaty, ro long recognized as In
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction and maintenance of a necessarily
American ship canal, is abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the United States
alone ebnll do the work of building and
assume the responsibility of rafeguurdlng
the canal and shall regulate Its neutral use
bv all nations on term of equality
without the guarantee or Interference
of any outside nation from any quar
ter. The signed treaty will at once
be laid before the senate, and If ap
proved the congress can then proceed to
give effect to tne advantages it secures
us by providing for the building of the
canal."
. The Monroe- Doctrine.
The president sets forth the objects of
the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in
which it has been received by other
countries, and In connection with It says
this nation has not the slightest desire to
acquire any territory at the expense of
any of our neighbors, and cites our atti
tude toward Cuba as a guarantee of our
good faith. He says also that "this
doctrine has nothing to do with the com
mercial relations of any American power
save that It In truth allows each of them
to form such as It desires." That "we
do not ask for any exclusive commercial
treaty with any other American state."
lie says of this:
"The Monroe doctrine should be the
cardinal feature of the foreign policy of
all the nations of the two Americas as
it la of the United States. Just 78 years
have passed since President Monroe In
his annual mesKnae announced that 'the
American continents are henceforth not
to be co'i.ddered as subjects for future
colonization by any European power." In
otber words, the Monroe doctrine Is a
declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any non-American
power at the expense, of any Ameri
can power on American soil. It Is in no
wise Intended as hostile to any nation In
the old world. Still less la It Intended to
give cover to any aggression by one new
world power at the expense of any other.
It Is simply a step, and a long step, to-w-arl
assuring the universal peace of the
world by securing the possibility of per
manent pace on this hemisphere."
The Navy.
The president urges the continued up
building of the navy as a means of per
forming our International duties as well as
a protection and safeguard tor our inter
national rights. He urges that our place
as a tirst-class power necessitates the
building and maintenance of a navy In
keeping with our place among the nations
of the world, and says:
"So far from being In any way a provo
cation to war, an adequate and highly
trained navy Is the best guarantee against
war, the cheapest and most effective peace
Insurance. The cost of building and main
taining ruch a navy represents the very
lightest premium for Insuring peace which
.this nation can possibly pay."
He recommends both the construction
of more ships and the addition of more
officers and men as absolutely necessary,
and says: ,
"There should be no cessation In the
work of completing our navy. So far In
genuity has been wholly unable to devise
a substitute for the great war craft whose
hammering guns beat out the mastery of
the high seas. It in unsafo and unwise
not to provide this year for several addi
tional battleships and heavy armored
cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft
In proportion. For the exact number and
character I refer you to the report of the
secretary of the navy. But there Is some
thing we need even more than additional
ships, nnd this Is additional officers and
men. To provide battleships and cruis
ers and ihPix lay them up, with the ex
pectation of leaving them unmanned un
til they are needed In actual war, would
be worse than folly. It would be a crime
agnlnst the nation.
"To send any warship agnlnst a compa
tent enemy unless those aboard It have
been trained by ysars of actual sea serv
ice. Including incessant nunnery prac
tice, would be to Invite not merely dis
aster, but the bitterest shame and humil
iation. Four thousand additional sea
men and a thousand additional marines
eho.iH be provided, and an Increase in
the officers should be provided by making
a large addition to the classes at Annap
olis. There la one small matter which
should be mentioned In connection with
Annapolis. The pretentious snd unmean
ing title of 'naval cadet' should be abol
ished: the title of 'midshipman.' full of
historic association, should be restored.
"We now have 17 battleships opproprl
ated for, of which nine are completed
and have been commissioned for actual
service. The remaining eight will be
ready In from two to four years, but It
will take at least that time to recruit and
train the men to fight them. It Is of vast
concern that we hav trained crews ready
for the rssel9 by the time they are com
missioned. Good ships and good guns are
simply good wespons, nnd the best
weapons are useless save In the hands of
men who know how to fight with them.
The men must be trained anj drilled un
der a thorough and well-planned system
of progressive Instruction, while the re
cruiting must be carried on with still
greater vigor. Kvery effort must be made
to exact the main function of the officer-
the command of men. The lending grad
uate of the naval academy should be as
signed to the combatant branches, the
line and marines."
The Army.
No Increase In the regular army la
deemed necessary at this time, but there
are several changes In that branch of the
government service which the president
recommends to congress. Chief of thee
Is the establishment of a staff department,
and of this hessys:
"A general staff should b created. Aa
for the general staff and supply depart
ments, tney should - be rilled by detail
from the line, th men so detailed return
ing after awnlle to their line duties. Itis
very under-treble to have the senior gTf
of the army composed of men who las
come to fill th positions by tbe ucreriaet
of seniority. A tystem should be adopted
by which there shall be an elimination
grade by grade of those who seem until'
to rentier the best service In the next
grade. Justice to tbe veterans of tbe
civil war who are still In the army would
seem to require ttat In the matter ot re
tirements they be given by law the earns
privileges, accorded to their comrade !
the navy."
Another recommendation which the pro-'
ident makes In connection with the army
Is lor the reduction of th "paper work"
tape." Of this he says:
"Kvery effort should be made to brine
th army to a constantly Increasing slaw
of efficiency. When on actual service, no
work save that directly in the line of such
service should be required. Tbe paper
work In the army, as In the navy, should)
be greatly, reduced. What la needed l
proved power of command and capacity
to work well In the field. Constant car
is necessary to prevent dry rot in tha
transportation and commlscary depart
ments." He also urge the enactment of legis
lation in connection with the militia anet
national guard forces or the nation that
they may be better fitted for active serv
ice In time of war, and saya: .
"Our militia law la obsolete and worth
less. The organisation and armament of
the national guard of the several states
which are treated as militia In the ap-
iruiir,a lions dy tne congress, rnounl be
made Identical with those provided for
the regular forces. The obligations and
duties of the guard In time of war should
be carefully defined and a system estab
lished by law under which tne method of
procedure of raising volunteer force
should be prescribed in advance. It la ut
terly Impossible in the excitement and
haste of Impending war to do thla satis
factorily If the arrangements have not
been made long beforehand. Provision
should be made for utilizing In the first
volunteer organizations called out tha
training of those citlzensi who have al
ready had experience under arms, and
especially for the selection in advance of
the otlicera of any force which may be
raised; for careful selection oi the kind
necessary is impossible after the outbreak
He praises the veterans of tho civil war,
the war with Spain and those who ,hav
rendered the nation valiant service In tha
Indian uprisings of the west and In the
Philippines, und counsels continued lib
erality in the nation's dealing with them.
Tbe Civil Service.
He recommends the enactment of legis
lation that will place under the ruling
of the merit system many classes ot em
ployes not now governed by It. His rec
ommendation for this is as follows:
"I recommend the passage of a law
which will extend the classified service to
the District of Columbia or will at least
enable the president thus to extend It.
In my Judgment all laws providing for
the temporary employment of clerka
should hereafter contain a provision that
they be selected under the civil service
law."
He also wishes the merit system to ob
tain in the government service in th
colonies, and says:
"Not an office should be filled In tha
Philippine or Porto Klco with any regard
to the man's partisan affiliations or serv
ices, with any regard to the political, so
cial or icrs6nal influence which he may
have at his command. In short, heed
should be paid to absolutely nothing save
the man's own character and capacity
and the needs of the service.
"The administration of these Island
should be as wholly free from the sus
picion of partisan politics as the admin
istration of the army and navy. All that
we ask from the publio servant in the
Philippines or Porto Klco Is that he re
flect honor on his country by the way in
which he makes that country's rule av
benefit to the peoples who have come un
der it. Thla Is all that we should ask.
ana we cannot arrord to be content with
less." .
Other neeoiHuesdatlosi.
Among other recommendations which tha
president makes are those asking for leg
islation that will Improve the consular serv
ice along lines outlined In bills Introduced
at previous sessions, and he rays that:
"It is true that the service Is now In tha
main efficient, but a standard of excellence
cannot be permanently maintained until
the principles set forth In the bills here
tofore submitted to the congress on this
subject are enacted Into law."
He believes the time has arrived when
the Indian should cease to be treated aa a
member of a tribe, but aa an Individual.
and racnmmanda hreaklno- un tha trlhal
funds, putting a stop to the indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allot
ments and stopping the ration ryetem. Ha
recommends also the establishment of an
industrial educational system, and an en
deavor to encourage the Indians to become
cattle raisers rather than agriculturists
where thlr lands-are unsulted to tiTd latter.
He recommends liberal appropriations for
the Louisiana Purchase exposition and an
appropriation covering expenses incurred
by the Charleston exposition in removing;
government exhibits from the Buffalo ex
position to that at Charleston.
Another of his recommendations Is for
a permanent census bureau, as It would In
sure better, cheaper and more satisfactory
work In the Interest of business, statistics,
economic and social science.
The Postal Service,
He calls attention to the growth of tha
postal system and to the fact that the an
nual deficit In this department of the gov
ernment service has been reduced to the
small sum of 13. 823,727. This, he says, could
further be Increased and possibly a surplus
shown but for the fact that many publi
cations are now securing the pound rata
as second-class mail matter which are not
entitled to the same under tha law. Of
this he says:
"The full measure of postal progress
which might be realized has long been
hampered and obstructed by the heavy
burden Imposed on the government
through the Intrenched and well-understood
abuses which have grown In con
nection with second-claas mall matter.
The extent of this burden appears when it
Is ststed that, while the second-class mat
ter makes nearty three-fifths of the weight
of all the mall. It paid for the last fiscal
year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate postal
revenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rata
pf postage, which produces the large losa
thus entailed and which was fixed by tha
congress with the purpose of encouraging;
the dissemination of publio Information,
were limited to the legitimate newspaper
and periodicals actually contemplated by
me law, no JUSl sicrpuun tuuiu vaac.
That expense would ba the recognized and
accepted cost of a liberal publio policy de
liberately adopted for a justifiable end.
But much of the matter which enjoys tha
privileged rate Is wholly outside of tha
Intent of the law and has secured admis
sion only through an evasion of Its re
quirements or through lax construction.
The proportion of such wrongly Included
matter Is estimated by postal experts to
be one-half of the whole volume of second
class mall. If It be only one-third or one
quarter, the magnitude of the burden la
apparent. The post office department has
now undertaken to remove the abuses so
far as possible by a stricter application
of the law, and It should be sustained In
Its effort."
Tha Chinese Difficulties.
He calls attention to tha satisfactory
settlement of the Chlneso difficulties of
last year, and this nation's part In tha
settlement, and says provisions hava
been made for Insuring tne future safety
of the foreign representatives, OI th
promises mado by China he says:
"The Chinese government has agreed to
participate financially In tha work of bet
tering th water approaches to Shanghai
and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign
trade In central and northern China, and
an International conservancy board, in
which the Chinese government is largely
represented, has been provided for tha
Improvement of the Shanghai river and
the control of Its navigation. In the sama
line of commercial advantages a revision
of thespresent tariff on Imports has been
assented to for the purpose ot substitut
ing specific for ad valorem duties, and an
Rineri una urrn ncni buiuhu un ma init
of the United States to assist In thla
work. A list of articles to remain free of
duty, Including flour, cereals and rloa.
gold and silver coin and bullion, hss also
been agreed upon In the settlement."
In conclusion, he mentions tha Pan
Amerlcan congress, now In session at tha
City of Mexico, end refers to th death of
Queen Vict seta and the dowager empress
of Germany, which aroused the genulna
sympathy of th people of this country,
which sympathy was fully reciprocate -by
the people of both these nations tspon
