The President's Message.
The annual Message of the President
to Congress was read in the Horse on
Monday. President Hayes pays a warm
tiibdte to Ceneral Grant and .ecom
mends that the office of C'a tain-General
of the Army be created for him. lis
urges Cxugtess to deiena the mvoiauii
itv of the Constitutional Amendment",
and to take measures for the suppress
ion of polygamy. He would have Con
gress provide for the goveninieuv t
Utah by a governor and judges appoint
ed bv the President and contii med by
the Senate, and would make all persons
piacticing or upholding polygamy ineli
gible to vole, sit on juiies or hold odice
in that Territory. He approves of the
workings of the present Civil service
system, and recommends an annual a;
oroDiiation of S:3.000 to defray the ex
penses of a Commission to devise an ef
dcieut system of competitive examina
tions. He would have each public olticei
free to express his political opinions and
to use his means for their advancement.
and also have him feel safe in refusing
all demands upon his salary for political
purposes. The first step in the reform
nf the Civil ijervice he believes must be
"a complete divorce between Congress
and the Executive m the mailer oi ap
Dointmenls."
The President recommends the further
retirement of the legal-tender notes and
that the s'lver-coi a;e law be changed
to mai.e the silver dollarequal as bullion
to the gold dollar. He advises that land
be allotted to lndia.is in severalty and
that they be glaced under the protection
of the laws of the land ; that abandoned
military posts be sold ; that the details
of officers to act as professors of tactics
and m:Ktary science at colleges and uni
versities be niude :.-om the mired list
instead of rfccl:ve list; he calls, atten
tion to the disc -editable condition of the
Naiiona' defences, and points out the
necessity for an intermediate Federal
Court of Ei rors and Appeals.
Col. John W. Fosxcr, the United
States minister at St Petersburg, has
sent a communication to Secretary oi
State, giving data of much interest con.
cernlng the condition of Russia more
particularly as regards the great com
mercial and industrial depression which
has ex'sted for the past year. The most
important part of the document is that
which relates to the grain trade of the
Czar"s vast possessions. America and
Russia have for some time been rivals
in providing food for the woild, and any
marked decrease in the hitter's export
trade must result in an approximate in
crease in that of this counfy. t rom
Col. Foster's report it appears that the
last harvest in Russia was far troni a
ull vield; also, that in many parts of
the empire the agricultural districts are
so inaccessible that much of the grain
that was grown could not be transport
ed to market, and that, in fact, the furth
er export trade of the country must de
pend upon the construct ioa of many
miles of railroad. The official publica
tion of Russian exports for the first six
months Oi this year shows that the
amount of wheat sent abroad, as com
pared with the same period of IS79, fell
off 22,043,060 bushels, and the decrease
in the erport of all cereals wasC2,i6,.!'S
bushels. The ultimate effect of this
reduction has not yet been felt in Eu
rope, or in the grain markets of the
United SU-tes; but when continental
merchants, who have been accustomed
to purchase Russian grain at Odessa
the pr oc pal port of the Ulack 6ea
come to realise that the supply in that
qua1 teris liro'ted, their orders wi'l com
mence pouring into this-country in such
great magnitude as will probably force
our ability to fill them to its utmost
limit Balto. American, Saturday.
Mr. James St2peensox, who ha
charge of the Un'ted Staies Geological
Survey in Northe' n New Mexico, has re
turned to AVashington with a report of
great interest to scientific men. He
claims io have discovered a city of an
extinct people, the dwel'ings of which
are cut in solid rock with inched ceil
in.es, and extend for th'rty to forty
miles parallel with the Rio Grande on
thn face of an apparently 'naecessible
cliff. The excavations were made to all
appea-ance witli stone implemenis, and

with, they will make a beginning, and

It's a poor sort of boy that can't
knock together a dozen boards that will
answer such a purpose.
And now suppose that you have made
your shelves, or bought them, or have
them already at hand, and have brought
together all the books which you can lay
claim to, big aud little, iraportaut and
unimportant, school books and all, how
shall the yet vacant space be filled ?
Make it a rule, 111 the brst place, to put
notmng in but what is good no dime
novels, pirate stories, 01 milk-and-water
trash by popular "series authors. One
genuine good book is worth a solid cord
such stuff. Get something that lasts;
something that you can take up airaiu
und again with pleasure ; something that
teaches while it amuses.
Let us make a few suggestions. Of
the books published we know of
nothing better to base a home libiary
upon than the several volumes of the
Wide Awake Pleasure Book. Its
contents cover a wider range of sub
jects than any other publication of the
kind we know of, and are made up of
contributions from the very highest lit
erary talent in England and America,
written expressly for its pases and
lavishly illustrated by the best artists.
Each number is a perfect treasure house.
The stories are bright, breezy and
healthy, and the poetry is of the same
character. The presence of this set of
books in a family would exert an influ
ence for good not to be lightly estima
ted. They are clearly pj in ted and beau
tifully bound.
Then add the two volumes of 'Poets'
Homes,' and the two companion vol
umes of 'Our American Artists." four
liooks without which no household li
brary is jwissibly complete.
t ina a place then for the issues in
Spare Minute Series 'Thoughts that
Breathe,' 'Might of Right,' 'Cheerful
Wolds' and "True Manliness, with the
volumes that are to come. In the line
of iiistorv there are the six volumes b
Miss Yonge, and the new series just be
gun of Lothrop's Library of Entertain
ing Iiistorv. Add to thtse 'Eves Right
and "Four Feet, Wings, and Fins' for
lovers of natural history; Miss Lillie's
'Stoiv of English Literature:' Mrs. Pear
son's HI utenberg. or the Art of Punting,'
and Hopkins"s 'Waifs and Their Au
ihois.' Let the girls, if there are any
in the family. add as thev can.the "Pansy"
books, 'Ella Farmau's 'Cooking Club, 'A
White Hand and Anna Mavlie,' and Ju
lia Eastman's series of tills' stoi it s.
while the bovs should not forget 'Good-
for-Nothing Pollv, the 'Out-of-Sc'uool
Series, and Mr. Rand's 'Pushing Ahead"
and 'Rark Cabin on Kearsarge.' And
then for filling out the shelves for tae
Utile ones, no library would be complete
without Clara Doty Rates 'C lassics ol
Rabvland.' Pansv's 'Our Darlings' and
'LiUle People in Picture and Story ; 'Ba
by Runtin?,' the 'King of l'ietuie Rooks,
Pictures for 'Our Darlings,' and 'Baby's
Portfolio. A new idea is set forth in
'X'ictures for Language Lessons,' a col
lection of beautiful pictures, to be used
as subjects for stories m homes and
schools. Each of the 2-'. pictures is
printed on heavy cardboard, t5x7.j inch
es, and contains in itself the materia!

Through the kindness of Capt Sharon,
we are able to furnish some of the sta
tistics of our wheat crop in Colerain
township: There were 121 producers.
of wheaf 151 i acies cut. producing
"1,127 bushels, averaging nea" ly 21 bush

averaged nearly 25S bushels for each
farmer. There were 1713 acres sown
the past autumn, an increase of 20-'
acres. Among the pi in final producers
of wheat we find the names of James

bound mail train left the track just after
passed the west line of Alaior Thomp

coi'ches. containing 9 persons, turned

Matthiifs Spiinger, an old lesident of
township, had one rib broken, and re
ceived severe bruises and cuts; his
daughtei, Mrs. Butler, and two small

had his shoulder dislocated and three
ribs broken. Several otheis were con
siderably hurt, including Conductor
Streator. The mail car did not "leave
the track. The mail agent was stand

thing he knew of tiie situation his.head
struck the f.ont end of the car; the jar
was so severe Viae it broke the car stove
into sma'l pieces. One old lady who

Xo Lowering the Flag, No Sur

BUT A RENEWAL OF THE OLD BAT
TLE FOR Aii OLD TIME VIC IORY.
its
The yep- 1881 will mark a new era ia our
political history, with an incoming Adm:ps
tration that cn be respected as legitimately
a possession of power with Congress even
ly divided in both branches with the States
half Democratic aid half Republican. The
Kepublican party ca anot carry through ex
treme sectional leg's'ation, bu, will undoubt
edly make insidious attacks on the Constitu
tion and the virtre of the people by profligate
use of the public revenues. The sp'nt of
centralisation is still rampant in that party
it is iu controlling tendency, aodwill be fur
thered by appeal to the selfishness of sec
lions. A magnificent government, on the
paternal plan, republican in outward form
but in rea'ity monarchical, is the haven the
ambit:ous leaders of the Republican party
are pushing for.
Never was there a c. eater necessity for ac
tivity, wacufu ness and unyielding political
lutes; ii v, mau mere now is in tne uemocrat
ic pa-ty. As an opposition party it can de-
"eat the conspirators. Its organisation must
be ma n'ained in a'l its old tm-e vigor; il
pa t f usages and traditions cherished: its ow
selected leades-s trust'M and encouraired:
membership slrensthened and educatetl in the
"a'th of the fathers. To the Democratic pari
ty is connded the exulted duty of de.eating
the efforts of men in the Rtpublictm party to
se up another lorm or government in place
of that which exis.s. Therefo.-e it is the
highest patriotism to defend and maintain oi
ganization in i's grea est eaectiveness.
Tub PitiBbukgh Host :s committed to this
p Tcio'e iu a'l its length and breadth, and
possible mo.e rigorously and unccmprom.s
