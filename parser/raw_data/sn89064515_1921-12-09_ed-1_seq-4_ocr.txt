UNCLE DUDLEY'S COLUMN
Where the Farmer Suffers
The price of farm products are down,
close to the 1914 level. That would
be" fine if other commodities were down
in proportion.
But high wages still prevail in the
cities in all lines. This means that the
manufacturer and wholesaler must con
tinue to charge the country .merchant
high prices for his goods.
The country merchant in turn must
'charge the farmer in proportion to
what he himself pays to the manufac
turer or wholesaler.
Very simple and easily understood,
but anything but satisfactory to the
farmer.
Speed up tho Christmas shopping if
you would enhance the Christmas
cheer.
Good old Santa Claus will soon be
with us again. He never passes this
town :by in his annual visits, and Aye
trust he never passes by any person in
the town or community.
But be sure that every one will be
remembered on Christmas day it' will
be well for us to .look around a bit.
There may be some one who hsis been
hit more than wo realize by the busi
ness depression under which we have
been laboring.
If there is such a person, or such 9
family, our greatest joy should be in
remembering those who are without the
means to remember themselves!
Bepeat the golden rule for inspira
tion.
3?
Just to demonstrate the depth of our
brotherly love, may you enjoy your
Christmas as we hope to enjoy ours.
Too often, the test of friendship is
a willingness to be used.
If you don't want to be known as a
nuisance, don't run around "with a
grievance.
Don't allow the other fellow to value
your Qwn time. He might embarass
you by overshooting the mark.
To be popular you should listen to
the troubles of others. They have no.
time to -waste on'yours.
If our public men could write their
own histories this country would be
overflowing with wise ones.
It takes a wise man to make a fool
of himself intentionally.
^,6
No, it isn't the short skirts that, are
becoming popular. It's wiat thejfc re
veal.
It's easy to tell a lie, but sometimes
it is mighty hard for a fellow to square
himsielf by telling another.
When a fellow's sins find him out, he
is .generally willing 1m stay in.
A
-The shortest sermons are often most
effective. They have a chance to sink
in.
-Beware of the stranger who effusive
ly offers you his hand. IJe wants you
to put something in it.
A really brave man seldom offers ex
cuses. Facts are sufficient warrant for
his action.
It's a terrible jolt tq the optimist to
find himself holding the bag.
A man should never refer to his wife
as the
4
1
'old woman.' It gives away his
own age.
We are pledged not to let out a whis
per regarding the latest engagement,
but there was nothing £&id about saut
ing it to the house tops. Guess!
When you get tired of reading about
the arms meet at Washington, you
might try making them meet at home.
Don't punch the fellow who calls
you a fool. The retort courteous would
be to thank him for acknowledging
you as his brother.

THE RETURN OF SPECIAL PRIVI
LEGE
As an incident bearing upon the
question of the re-establishment of
Special privilege at the national capital
with the return of the Republican
party to power, the Philadelphia Public
Ledger in a recent Washington spe
cial, announces the presence at the
Capital of W. W. Atterbury, vice-presi
dent and general manager of the
Pennsylvania railroad, and boldly dis
closes the purpose. of his visit as
follows:
The selection of citizens of Penn
sylvania to fill vacancies on the Inter
State Commerce Commission was dis
cussed today by W. W. Atterbury,
vice-president
and general manager of
the Pennsylvania .system, and Senator
Penrose. The senator said while no
definite recommendations'1 were made
by Mr. jAtterbury, several names were
discussed as eligible."
The Harrisburg Patriot, which for
many years has sturdily combatted
special privilege at the national capi
tal and in the state of Pennsylvania,
thus comments upon this incident:
The audacity of the thing is re
vealed with the knowledge that the
commission will pass on rates and sim-(
ilar questions in which Mr. Atterbury's
railroad will be interested. In other
words, it looks as though a prospective
litigant is to be granted the right to
suggest the judge who will sit over his
as
After calling attention to the activi
ties of Mr. Atterbury in the last Be
publican national convention and sup
port of the ticket named there, the
Patriot continues:
"This development ought to have
a vivid interest for American citi
zens everywhere. Its brazen, almost
impudent character, indicates how de
termined the Bepublican organization
is to repay its debts to the interests
which stand by in times of political
emergency."
It has heretofore been the established
policy of the Bepublican party to work
in the dark ity was the originator of
invisible government but the majority
it received in. the last presidential elec-j
tion has emboldened it to come out in
the open. Special privilege and the
spoils system are being ostentatiously
re on an an a is is re vi
an am of a
ingism and Penroseism. Will the,
people submit to this phase of "Nor
malcy.

THAT MARION ELECTION
Senator Pat Harrison, one of the
most brilliant and the best-natured
man in Congress, could not resist com
menting on the late election in Mar
ion, made famous by burnt cork, gum
and Col. Harvey. He said:
"A little while ago, there was an
election in New Mexico and next day
we heard much talk about it but we!
have not heard Republicans saying
anything about the election the other
day. Even the city of Marion, that is
famed now throughout the world for
having during the last' presidential
campaign entertained A1 Jolson, the
black-face comedian, and other actors
and great baseball players, whose ex
penses were paid by Mr. Wriglev, the
chewing-gum man, who contributed
liberally to the Republican Campaign
fund and offered to the Republican
campaign committee last yeai* all the
electric signs in all the eitiei to be
transformed from "Wrigley's" to
"Harding and Coolidge," and whose
services the Finance Committee, re
warded so liberally in the considera
tion of the tax bill by taking off the
tax on chewing .gum, whieh action
•was sanctioned and approve4 by, ?l
majority in this Chamber—I say. that
the city of Marion, which was .made
famous by A1 Jolson and Wrigley
and
George Harvey, who sat around the
front proch advising and counseling
and who since has disgraced America
and which was made famous also by
being the home of the President of
the United State.®, the other day turn
ed out a Bepublican and went Demo
cratic by a big votp. We did not hear
anything about that from the other
side."
"EVERYBODY GIVING CONGRESS
HELL"
Here is the opinion of Congressman
William B. Wood of Indiana, a stal
wart Bepublican, spoken on' the floor
of the House, November 17, concerning
public opinion of this Bepublican Con-
"I know the very serious condition'
that is prevailing throughout the land
I am only speaking the: truth when I
say that the people of Ahis country
employed in every vocation and in
every character of business are giving
this Congress hell. They are doing it
/because we have done nothing to
stimulate business. They are doing
it because we have done nothing to
give employment to the unemployed.
They are doing it because we have
done nothing to benefit the farmer
and stimulate the price of the farmers'
products.''

Washington—President Harding has
proposed to congress a definite and
comprehensive program for restoring
the United States to normalcy.
Speeding up of plans to put Amer
ica again in, a sound normal basis is
America's best contribution to a world
wide restoration, the president said,
with representatives of all the world
powers here for the arms conference
in the galleries of the house.
President "Harding informed congress
in hisjfirst annual message that "A
most gratifying world accomplish
ment," bjrthe arms conference "is not
improbable." The message was deliver
ed by the president'in person'in the
chamber of the. houe$ and in~the pres
ence of the delegates to the conference
and most *of the diplomats regularly
stationed in Washington.
At the outset, the president dis
cussed world conditions, saying "A
world restoration program" would
have to be worked out "by the nations
more directly conoerned" the United
States will help, he added, unselfishly
because tliefe is compensation in the
consciousness of assisting selfishly
because the commerce and interna
tional exchanges in trade, which
marked our high tide of fortunate ad
vancement, are possible only when the
nations of &U continents are restored,
to stable ordfer and normal relation^
ship.
N
Turning to domestic problems, the
president urgently recommended early
enactment of the. permanent tariff and
foreign debt refunding bills.
With regard to the merchant marine
Mr. Harding said it was the purpose to
present a plan which "contemplates no
greater draft on the public treasury,,
and which, though yet too crude to of
fer it today, gives such promise of ex
panding our merchant marine, that it
.will argue its own approval."
"Proper encouragement" for the co
operative marketing programs as a
means of assisting in the relief of
present conditions in agriculture was
suggested by the executive^ He also
told the congress that it should give
Its "earnest attention* to a general
policy of trapsportation of disturbed
industry and highway construction, to
encourage the spread, of the population
and i$tore the balance .between city
and coimtry.

LIBERALS WIN ELECTION
Premier Meighen of Canada De
feated on Tuesday.
Tariff Is Issue in Canadian Elections
—Liberals Win Big Victory
With Help of Women.
Ottawa—Liberal candidates, on the
crest of a landslide, swept the govern
ment party headed by Premier
IV^eighen from power in the Canadian
^general election.
The Liberals, headed by W. L. Mac
kenzie King, were running on a tariff
reduction platform, while the Meighen
party stands for protection.
Beaten in Home District.
Premier Meighen was defeated even
in his home constituency, Portage La
Prairie, Man. His opponent was Har
ry Leader, Progressive. Seven mem
bers of the cabinet were defeated.
With the polls thrown open to them
for the first time on the same basis as
men, women turned out in every pro
vince to help elect Canada's four
teenth parliament.
At the last election, ballots were
distributed to women serving with war
forces and certain soldier kin. This
year, however, women neded only the
electoral qualifications of the other
sex.
Ontario Decides.
The battle was won and lost in On
tario, the most populous of all the
provinces, and long regarded as safe
for the government. Of the 62 On
tario seats held by the government
when parliament dissolved, the Meigh
en party retain^ only 38.
Complete returns were not avail
able but sufficient information waB
at hand to show that Mr. King, Liberal
chieftain,1 would have the largest
group in the next parliament, ''and
probably a clear majority over all par
ties. He will thus be called upon by
the governor general to form a gov
ernment.
One surprise of the contest was the
poor showing made by the new Pro
gressive party, headed by T. A. Crerar.
While sweeping the Western pro
vinces, the Progressives elected only
15 members east of the Great Lakes,
according to the early showing.

work resulting from the strik3 of pack
ing house workers came from St. Paul,
Kansas City, Denver and other cities,
the first day of the strike passed quiet

effect upon normal operations.

Employers said that fewer than
1,100 of the'taore than 20,000 employed
in Chicago had failed to report and
there were two applications fcr every
vacancy.
A few of the 19 independent plants
here which had not adopted the 10
per cent wage reduction, given as the-* mu
cause of the strike by union leaders,
were not affected, but some o? them
were almost completely tied up.

chief of police that state police would
be called out on request of the Kansas
industrial court if the Kansas law pro
hibiting picketing was violated. Lead
ers of the strikers then urged the pick

packing plants. Members of the" in
dustrial court then intimated that if
there were no disorders no drastic ac
tion would be taken against the strike
leaders who bad refused to appear be

into effect.
In Denver the packing plants were
almost completely tied up by the walk
out. At Omaha one worker was at

no other disorder was reported there.

Washington—The effort to find
an acceptable substitute for the
Anglo-Japanese alliance has so
diverted the attention of many' of
the arms delegates as to throw
even the question of the naval
radio temporarily into the back
ground. Both the Japanese and
British have shown a desire to In
clude the United States in any en
tente that may replace the al
liance, and a tentative treaty draft
under consideration by somes gov
ernments concerned would pro
vide for a quadruple arrangement,,
also including France. What may
have been the attitude of the
American delegates in the behind
the-scenes developments having
to do with the proposal remains
a mystery.
Washington—The question of a
three or four-power agreement to re
place the Anglo-Japanese alliance is
demanding increased attention among
the arms delegates while they wait for
Japan to define her position on the
naval ratio.

Tangle Possible.
It is considered possible that in the
present period of waiting the two
threads of negotiations may become
so tangled in the foreign capitals as
to give the American delegation con.
siderable trouble in separating them
when the discussions are resumed. It
would not surprise some observers if
there should be an attempt to make
the final reply of one or more of the
governments conditional upon a poli
tical agreement of one sort or an
other.
The proposal for the four-power En
tente as now advanced is considered
an outgrowth of the suggestion of
David Lloyd George that the Washing
ton conefrence might well consider
merging the Anglo-Japanese alliance
into an arrangement to which the Uni
ted States might be a part. The Jap
anese have shown an inclination to
take up that proposal.

Thes& hints have never brought the
subject to the point of a formal ex

willing to go in that direction.
Neither will the American represen

but they are known to regard it as
fraught with many complicated pos

On the part of the American govern

Navy Far East Problems Linked.
Upon high authority it was said that
the naval problem as it was referred
to Tokio after the last meeting of the
Big Three, involves no proposal for
a political agreement of any charac
ter but is concerned solely with the
naval and military aspects of the
situation.
The American belief that the naval
question can be settled independent of
political issues apparently is not
readily accepted in all quarters.
A British spokesman reecntly de
clared that the British view the naval
and Far- Eastern problems were bountd
up in the same sheaf and there have
been indications of a like opinion
among some Japanese.
