New Russian Effort to Check Advance
of Von Ma'ckensen Is Seen South
. of Roumanian Capital City.'
London An event surpassing in far
reaching importance the actual mili
tary operations of the war came Sun
day in the public announcement by the
new Russian .Premier, Alexander Tre
poff, that, by an agreement concluded
in 1915 and subsequently adhered to by
Italy, the allies definitely established
Russia's right to Constantinople and
the Straits.
Simultaneously, with the fate of
Bucharest still hanging in the balance.
came the news that Russia was mak
ing heroic efforts to turn the tide of
events in Roumania, in addition to ex
erting vigorous pressure against Von
Falkenhayn in Moldavia, where the
Rnssians have gained a footing at Kir
libaba. ':'.--'''
The new Russian effort was visible
sputh of Bucharest in an important at-.
tack on l ield Marshal Von Macken-
sen's rear, which, according to the
Russian official report, was accom
panied by some success, the Germans
and Bulgarians having been driven
from Tzomana and Gostinari.' The
Russians are also successfully applying
pressure in uoorudia.
These Russian attacks on the two
extreme flanks of the central forces
may change the complexion of the
Roumanian campaign, as there is no
indication as yet that the central pow
ers have succeeded in cutting off any
considerable portion of the Roumanian
armies.

again in control of Chihuahua City
aunaay and-Villa had lied to the moun

was announced by Genral Francisco
Gonzales, commander of the Chihuahua
brigade here.
- General FranciBco Murguia, the Car

ing slowly northward from Torreon,
was also reported to have entered the
city after having defeated the Villa
column 30 miles south of Chihuahua
City. -
No Americans have been killed In
Chihuahua City by Villa, according to
a private message received here from
that city. The message said that the
only foreigners - to suffer were the
Chinese, for whom the bandits ahowed
no mercy. General Murguia and Tre

Red Tape Costs Property.
Sheridan, . Or. William H. Dins-
more, of Sheridan, will lose his claim
secured at the Colville land drawing
last spring. Mr. Dinsmore sent his
check for the first payment, which was
due, and the government refused the
check, demanding caBh.
Mr. Dinsmore was not not fled until
it was too late to deposit the required
coin, and was informed he was out of
the race. -
The claim was an exceptionally fine
one, adjoining cultivated land on two
sides valued at $100 an acre, and Mr.
Dinsmore feels the loss keenly.
No announcement regarding Mr.
Bonar Law's decision has been made.
and there are seme doubts whether he
will accept the heavy responsibility.
If he declined, it is considered certain
that the honor will fall to David Lloyd
ueorge. The continuation of the coali
tion cabinet, with some changes in its
membership and the speeding up of the
war management will be the policy in
either event.
The premier's decision to resign and
advise the King to summon Andrew
Bonar Law to form a cabinet was
taken after a day of extraordinary po

Mr. Asquith met several Unionist
leaders in consultation, including Earl
Curzon, Lord Robert Cecil and the
Earl of Derby.
Noticeable absentees from this con
ference were: A. J. Balfour,- who is
ill; Andrew Bonar - Law( J. Austen

Later in. the afternoon the premier
met many of his supporters. The
meeting lasted more than an hour, and
it is supposed that Mr., Asquith ex

insuperable obstacles to the reconcilia

most immediately the premier drove
to the palace and had an audience with

of animals suitable for use on Euro

The prices for ' horses are ranidlv
advancing, due to the fact that the
allies have taken bo many out of this
territory and shipped them to Europe,
said Mr. Flood. "Mr. Lieth will find
prices advanced even since he left here
a short time ago. I take it that the

A well-known downtown druggist
says everybody uses Wyeth's Saee
and Sulphur Compound now because
it darkens so naturally and evenly
that nobody can tell it has been ap

simply dampen a comb or soft brush
and draw it through your hair, taking
one strand at a time. By morning

to its natural color and looks glossy,
soft and beautiful. This preparation
is a delightful toilet requisite. It is
not intended for the cure, mitigation
