FORCING THE ISSUE.
There is a manifest disposition among
the leading Democrats in congress to dis
cipline Mr. Kandali. In consideration that
the country recognizes that the tariff is the
principal issue between the two leading
parties, the Democratic leaders have an idea
that the Democratic party must make a dis
inct record on this issue, Ihe senate
King Republican, of course there is no ex
pectation of anything in that quarter, in
;he house of representatives the matter
takes another phase. The Democratic ma
jority in the lower house is relied upon to
pass a tariff bill which will be an interpre
tation of the Democratic doctrine on this
issue. The difficulty heretofore, and still
existing, is Mr. Randall and his Democratic
contingent of protectionists. This con
tingent is strong enough with the Republi
can vote to defeat any bill that the Demo
crats propose in the interest of tariff reform.
It will be impossible for the next house of
representatives to pass a bill reducing the
tariff to a revenue basis unless Randall and
his followers fall into line. Now that the
president has spoken his views
so clearly and distinctly in favor
of tariff revision the Democratic reformers
are encouraged to strengthen their position.
In a recent interview Senator Maxkv. of
Texas, expressed the opinion that the tariff
reform Democrats would be justified in
throwing Mr. Randall overboard and
forcing him into the Republican party if he
continued longer to be an obstacle to tariff
reduction. Senator Maxky's opinion was
that it would be better for the Democrats to
be in a minority in both branches of con
gress and stand solidly in favor of tariff re
form than to have control of both branches
and be divided on this issue. Senator
Maxkv is not alone in this opinion. Other
Democrats take the same view of the situ
ation, and the probabilities are that by the
time the next congress assembles Mr. Ran
dall will have to play the coon act. anil
come down "gracefully in support of tariff
revision and tariff reduction, or he will have
to take up his permanent quarters on the
other side of the political fence. The tariff
is becoming too important an issue to be
trifled with, and the situation is too critical
for the Democratic party to occupy any
half-way ground.
IS BI.NUH GRASS GOVE?
A number of ranchmen recently in
Chicago have given out the alarming report
that bunch grass is fast disappearing from
the plains and that, therefore, the cattle
industry is doomed. Reports of this kind
have periodically appeared about this season
of the year and can usually be relegated to
the same inciting motive, the desire to pre
vent would- be investors lrom engag ng in
the cattle business. There is no doubt but
that in some sections of the country the
stock business is being overdone. Too
many cattle have been crowded in on the
same range, and consequently many of
them are likely to be unable to survive the
winter. But, taking the cattle region as a
whole, there is still plenty of room for new
comers. In the Northwest particularly
there is vet an abundance of room despite
the tremendous influx of investors within
the last taw years. Tha countenancing
therefor of false yports regarding the poor
Condition of theAuuna is a species of self
ishness which in the interest of the coun
try's ' development should be severely
frowned upon. So far from t#a bunch
ira-s having disappeared from the plains.it
s especially luxuriant iv Montana, Idaho and
Wyoming, and shows no signs of diminu
tion. The plains which for ages furnished
sustenance to countless herds of buffalo
should surely be able to support a much
smaller number of domestic cattle, and
there is little fear that they will not be
able to do so. But in order that there
should be ar, broad an extent ot grazing
-round as possible, and in order that one of
the most material sources of the West's
wealth should be enlarged, the various In
dian reservations should be thrown open
with as little delay as possible, and this is a
subject to which congress might well turn
its attention.
CALVES OR BABIES^
The New York Herald calls the attention
of congress to the fact that 262,000 Indians
hold 134.000.000 acres of land in the heait
of the United States. A large part of this
they have been allowed, under Republican
mismai agement, to lease out to cattle syn
dicates, while a white family is allowed to
take up only 160 acres for a homestead. it
is about time that congress was doing some
thing to protect the public domain as well
as the Indian reservations from the rapa
c.»us cattle barons. If the president's pol
icy of dividing up the Indian reservations
and parcelling the lands to the Indians in
severalty is the wisest policy to pursue,
then congress should at once proceed to put
it into execution. If congress has a wiser
plan, then let it put that into execution.
But let something be done, and let it be
done immediately. The reign of the cattle
batons should be brought to an abrupt ter
mination, and the unsettled sections of the
jountry be placed at the disposal of honest
settlers. Honest farmers are of more ben
efit to the country than cattle kings, and
baby-raising is more importance than rais
ing calves. Let us have land reform.
T ■ (OA DEFENSES.
While the far West is not directly inter
ested in the question of coast defences, she
can all the more confidently be trusted to
look upon the matter from an unbiased and
common reuse point of view. And viewing
the matter in this light the delay of con
gress in properly providing for a system of
coast defenses appears to be inexcusable.
' The statement is susceptible of proof that
any one of the third-class powers possesses
an iron clad of sufficient power to lie off
any of our coast cities beyond the reach of
such guns as we now possess and knock the
city into smithereens. It is not probable
that we will soon engage in a foreign war.
but international complications which might
lead to such a result arc at any time possi
ble. It would be much better now hi time
of peace to take measures, even at the cost
of several millions of dollars to protect
American ports than to jeopardize at some ;
time in the future, property which is even j
now estimated to be worth something like ;
five thousand millions of dollars. And not |
alone should the coast line be adequately j
protected, but our northern and northwest- J
crn frontier should be given attention. In j
that direction we are lamentably weak, and
in the improbable event of trouble with
England, would be exposed to immediate I
and disastrous attack. The whole subject
is one of vital interest to which, with far
more advantage to the country than most ,
of the discussions which take up its time,
congress might well devote itself.
INVESTIGATE IT.
The result of recent earthquake investiga
tion Is a concurrent opinion among Amer- j
ican geologists that the earth's surface is a t
very thin crust, probably not exceeding
twenty miles in thickness, and that the other |
24.960 miles of its diameter is liquid and
gaseous matter. If that liquid matter
should prove to be boiling oil. melted lead
or something humorous, as the 'likado de
fines it. it would be a most uncomfortable
reflection to know that we were protected
from its fury by such a thin shell of dirt
gravel. But as practical investigation is
the order of the day. why is it that it hasn't
occurred to somebody to sink an artesian
well to the depth of 20 miles to determine
the correctness of this scientific view of the
earth's interior? On a subject of this kind
a little bit of practical knowledge is worth
a world of theories.

HELPING IT ALONG.
Henry ' George's land movement Is
getting a boost from unexpected quarters.
The very moment the churches jumped on
it. the movement assumed an importance
that it did not merit. Nothing aids a po
litical movement so much as to be assailed
by the churches. Ever since the founder
of Christianity drew the line between poli
tics and religion, by declaring that what was
C__sar's should belong to Cesar, and
what was God's should be rendered unto
Him, there has been a disposition among
the people of all Christian nations to resent
church dictation in politics. And in no
country is this disposition more manifest
than in our own republic. If let alone, the
George laud movement will probably "die
a-bornuV." but if persecuted into promi
nence, there is no telling to what propor
tions it may grow.
BUTLER'S CLAIM.
In a speech at Lowell the other day Gen.
Butler claimed for himself the credit of
having saved the national capital from cap
ture by the rebels in 1861. lt isa little late j
to make the claim for distinction in this
matter, still it is probable that he contrib
uted his "part. But there is one thing Gen.
Butler did not save: He did not save
himself from being mulcted in damages to
the extent of $16,000 the other day by a
Washington jury for money that he had re
ceived as manager of the Soldiers' Home
and which he had failed to account for. It
so happens that just at this time the nation
is more interested in recovering the money
it appropriated for the Soldiers' Home
than it is in determining who saved Wash
ington in 1-61. The national capital is
safe enough at this date, but the money is
not.

AN IMPATIENT STATESMAN.
Congressman W. D. Hill, of Ohio, as
serts that he intends to push his bill for the
division of Dakota, and will put it through
the house. He says, in the same connec
tion, that as soon as the bill passes the
house, the people of South Dakota will set
their state, machinery in motion without
waiting for the action of the senate, lt is
a singular coincidence with these utter
j ances of the congressman, that having been
defeated for re-election as a representative
from Ohio, Mr. Hill announces his pur
pose to migrate to Dakota. The position
of senator from South Dakota is evidentlj
iv Mr. Hill's eye, and he is restive under
the delay in congressional action with
reference to Dakota's division.
_■_■
IT WOULD BE CURIOUS.
Among the speculations of the next presi
dential elections is the probability of three
candidates with the possibility of the elec
tion being thrown into the house of repre
sentatives. In that event among the most
curious features of the situation would be
the sight of Minnesota casting its vote for
the Democratic candidate and Virginia's
vote going to the Republican candidate.
Yet according to the representation of the
two states in the next congress, would be
the result in case there was no choice for ;
president by the electoral college.
THE FISHERIES TROUBLE.
It is gratifying to observe that while
Secretary Bayard maintains a fair and
dignified position in his correspondence with
the British government, relative to the fish
eries trouble, still he exhibits decided firm
ness and insists that American citizens shall
be protected from British outrages. The
British government may not have been
primarily responsible for the outrages, but
it is the duty of this government to hold it
to a strict accountability unless proper rep
aration is made. The secretary of state
cannot stand too firmly in this matter to
please the American people.

If the rumored deal between Mr. Gould

touches. It also looks as if Mr. Gould
was keeping a stock of broken down rail
roads on hand expressly for trading pur
poses. Whenever he can swap off a
bankrupt ra.lway for a valuable telegraph
franchise, he makes a shrewd deal.

A "FOKTY-NIMF.H'SH YARNS
Of the Day- \% hen the Fever for Gold
Took thousand, to the t'aclfic
Coast. • •
/•Away back in the forties, when the dis
covery of gold in California st initiated emi
gration to that country, there were three
routes pursued, overland from Fort Leaven
worth, by way of the isthmus, or Cape
Horn," said a "forty-niner" at the Mer
chants to a Globe man yesterday, "in
order to give to these gold-hunters security
a regiment of cavalry was concentrated at
Fort Leavenworth, preparatory to taking
up the line or inarch to the Pacific coast.
The commanding officer made a requisition
on Gen. Twiggs, the department com
mander, for 500 gallons of whisky. Tiie
clerk in copying it iiu.le it for 50.000 gal
lons. Twiggs, thinking the quantity en
tirely too large, directed that it be cut down
to 5.000 gallons.
"So, when the long train pulled out from
Leavenworth, each wagon had on board one
or more barrels of whisky. As these were
emptied, the barrels were left on the road
side, and it was. said that the . trail of the
command could be followed years after
wards by the abandoned barrels, which, like
so many buoys, guided the lone traveler on
his lorn: any weary journey. .
"Those who were financially well fixed.
generally went via the isthmus. Every
steamer leaving New York for Aspinwail
was crowded with people destined for the
gold fields. Many of these failing to find
gold in paying quantities, returned by the
same route. An enterprising Yankee
elected a long shed and closed in the sides,
furnished it with beds, leaving only room
enough between them for one person t <
pass. On the arrival of every steamer there
was a general rush to secure one of these,
as the demand always exceeded the
supply. On one occasion, a droll
old fellow, finding that all the
beds were taken took this way to secure
one. lie went around among the occupants
asking each one if he had seen his watch
man. Some one asked what he meant, and
he replied: 'My watchman, a California
rattlesnake with fifteen rattles and a button
which I left here in the corner, lias disap
peared and I cannot find him.' The beds
and the room were soon vacated and the
old fellow took his choice of beds and
turned in to sleep for the night undisturbed
by another occupant in the room.
"The route by the way of Cape Horn
occupied about six months in a sailing ves
sel and was not generally patronized. Ot
Hie thousands who rushed to California
how few were successful? Many lost their
lives by exposure; many returned home
poorer than when they left it. while only a
very few— not one in a thousand— made
fortunes."

The Quveu'n Name
London World.
Considering the "strained relations' with
Russia, which have marked the whole
course of the queen's reign, it is remarkable
that her first name. Alexandrina, should
have been conferred upon her in honor of
the then reigning czar, of whom the Duke
of Kent was au admirer, and who was our
faithful and close ally. George IV. was to
have contributed another name. Georgiana.
But Georgiana Alexandrina would have de
prived the emperor of the place of prece
dence, and Alexandrina Georgiana would
have derogated from the claims of the name
borne by the actual king of England, and
all his Hanoverian pied jcessors. The name
of the queen's mother was therefore substi
tuted for that of her uncle. In the com
mencement of the christening of the new
born princess, she was called Alexandrina
Victoria but the second name was speedily
Anglicized or Latinized into Victoria. A
little before William IV. 's death, there
was some flutter among official people as to
the designation undei which the queen
expectant should be proclaimed. Among
other absurd suggestions there was one that
she should be styled Elizabeth 11.

THE CA-IFB-.1.C IMVOBCR CASE.
The Father of .the Plaintiff Creates.
a >eu«*lioaa-«Lord Co Mat's Te_ti
■uony, •
London, Dec. B.— trial of the Camp
bell divorce case was resumed to-day. Coun
sel for Lady Colin Campbell asked tbat orders
be issued compelling Lord Colin to give fur
ther security for the payment of his wife's
costs. This the judge refused to graut.
Lord Colin was again called to the witness
stand. He testified that Lady Colin admitted
in July 1883, whiie ill, that she had received
two or three letters each day from the Duke
of Mailbough. She refused to show tbe let
ters to him. • She also confessed to receiving
letters from ben. Butler, When he asked
ber to show them to him, she replied, she did
not keep her letters. When Lady Colin lett
Zion house she said she was going to ber
sister's at . Beauport Gardens. He askeo
her why she went to Codagan plaoe and wrote
letters dated Beauport Garden*. Witness
thought she so datei her letters. On being
pressed by the jud-e he said he was sure be
asked ber if sire took an body home with bet
i rout the ballon the 1 previous Friday night.
Lady Colin denied that any one was witb tier.
Here Blood, the father of the plaiutitf, rose
in court and
SHAKING HIS FIST
at Lord Colin, said: "You are making In
famous charges against your wi.e. and it is
not the first time .»ou have lied regarding
her." Witness continued: Lady Conn said
to him that unless before he left the room, he
signed a paper binding himself never to
molest her again, she would an to her solic
itor. Witness said be repudiated this at
tempt at intimidation uud refused to sign
such a paper. He asked Lady Mi), sto go
with him in o another room, and alter con
versation with her they both returned to the
family council. Lad. Miles said to Lad.
Colin: "Colin desires me to say that he inane
no charges against you.". Witness expressed
his willingness to submit
THE QUESIJON OP HIP HEALTH
to a medical commission, and if t c result
was favorable he would take no vi due ad
vantage, but he stipulated Lady Colin rai.s.
abandon her correspondence with the Duke
of Marlborough. His wile then referred
him to her solicitor, and refused to see him
alone. It wis untrue that be continually
made overtures to his wife, but he did refuse
to bind himself eternally against cohabita
tion. The Judge here said that if Lady Colin
was innocent her brsband's questions were
most insulting. Lord Colin denied that he
committed adulter.. with Mary Watson. He
said he had taken action in Paris against hi"
wife under his solicitor's advice. He denied
having asked Lady Miles to apologise to Dr.
Bird for having alleged that the doctor
caused a miscarriage. Under cross
examination Lord Colin said he had never
studied surgery, but hud attended lectures iv
the college of surgeons on g.necolo.,ry and
anatomy. A letter was read from Lord C' 'In
to Dr. Bird, in which the writer said he nad
studied for a long time in tho college of sur
geons and knew a great deal about such mat
ers. Witness admitted having written thi*
letter. He refused to swear that he had not
told bis counsel that Lady Miles said bis wife
had a miscarriage.
HIS illness began
in 1871, and was afterward continued from
1876 to 1884. when be was perfectly well. He
remembered that at the trial in 1884 the jury
was asked to say whether or not he suffered
lrom a disease which could be communicated
to bis wife. At that lime he heard his coun
sel sa .• there was not a single charge of any
kind against Lady Colin. Ellen Brown and
Mrs. Duffy told bim in July, 1883, what they
had testified, and he believed their state
ments. He admitted having remonstrated
with his wife against ber overtaxing her
strength with charitable wo k. When asked
it his wife ever lied to him. he said she used
deception. He admitted that after his wife
left him at, Zion horse his brother Walter
called to see ber at Cndogan place. While
absent Lady Colin corresponded with him (
until the final rupture. He only kept one of
her letters. This letter was written in De
cember, 1-81. --It beaan with "Darling boy,"
and ended with "Your Arab." Alter the
marriage was cosumtnated Lady Colin never
said she had suffered • from something she
was unable cto understand. He did not re
member having told his wife to take precau
tions. He admit *d that he told her to con
sult with her sister, but not about anything
she told bim. When p ressed, he admitted
having said previous to the treal that he told
his wife to take precautions to
. I'RKVKST HAVING CHILDREN.
This admission caused a sensation in the
courtroom. Lord Colin further said his
means were limited. His wile provided
£1,000 to furnish the r bouse, and she Uougnt
furniture at auction sales and decorated the
bouse at her own expetise. He admitted that
Hose Baer was dismissed July 11, and not. as
she swore, the 41 bof June. He believed his
wife went to Leigh Court July 10. If his
counsel said Lady Colin rushed back sud
denly and dismissed Rose Baer, witness was
bound to believe him. [Laughter.] Lord Colin
admitted having us< d violence on Mrs. Duffy.
He further admitted that whin he asked
Lady Colin, in May, 18s3, to withdraw the
message she had sent to him that month, his
wife replied: "I will, but for God's sake
leave me a one." Lord Colin also said the
Luke of Marlborough sent presents to Lady
Colin at their marriage, and dined with her
afterward. Witness admitted that he twice
had an Infectious disease, the first time in
1870. Adjourned.
LORD SAIISBIRY. .
He Talks to the a on-ervntive Club,
.and rai*e- Cord Hurting ton.
London, Dec. B.— Lord Salisbury delivered
an address at the Conservative club this
evening. He said it was remarkable fact that
men of the greatest power aid influence had
separated themselves from the Liberal party,
and that tueir leader had thrown aside party

RUMBLE OF THE RAILS
A Eumor Afloat That Jim Hill Has Un
loaded a Block of His Man
itoba Stock.
The Eumor Given Considerable Credence
■ -'^ Among the Various St. Paul
Railroad Officials.
A Ten-Dollar Labor Hate Agreed
Upon Yesterday to St. Louis
Via Chicago.
A Glenntlc Trade Reported to Be On
Between .Jay Gould and
Robert Garrett.
There was a rumor on the street yester
day that James J. Hill, of the Manitoba
road, had disposed of a "big chunk" of his
Manitoba stock to the Burlington road.
The principals of the two lines, on being
interviewed, den ed that there was any
truth in the report, but it is given a great
deal of credence by the majority of railroad
men. , A railroad official said on being
questioned regarding the probability of
the rumor being true:
I think it very provable that such is the
case. There is no doubt that the Burlington
people would like to get a contio'ling interest
in the Manitoba road, and they would then
virtually have a through line from Ciicagoto
the Pacific coast since they are interested In
tbe Canadian Pacific. I understand that Mr.
Hill is anxious to dispose of his railroad
stock and retire from active railroad life, de
voting'bi's time to tbe breeding of blood, d
stock, in which he has always taken so deep
an Interest.
Mr. Hill's absence in the East at present
and the Interest he is taking regarding sani
tary restrictions relative to live stock, goes
far toward strengthening the suspicion that
there is more truth tliar fiction in the rumor.
The Burlington people have been anxious
to get an interest in the Manitoba line for a
long time and rumors have frequently been
set afloat to the effect that the Burlington
had got control of it. but these rumors have
always been sworn down by the officials of
the two roads. The story that Mr. Hill has
sold out a large portion of his stock is. how
ever, a different deal and one with a
greater possibility of truth than the old
time chestnut referred to above.
M. I. oni* I. bur Bates.
The Omaha, Wisconsin Central and Mil
waukee roads yesterday agreed to make a

compete with the cross country lines which
have been making a $10 rate to lit. Louis
for some time, according to the stories of
those lines. This is $4.75 below tariff and
is a $5.85 rate to Chicago. Just what
effect this move will have on the other
lines is hard to tell, but it may result in a
row.

(iould and Garrett Credited With
making' a Biz Tmd ■• *
Atlanta, Ga.. Dec. 8. — The Southern
industrial journal, Dixie, has a special dis
patch from a staff correspondent at Fort
Worth. Tex., which says: One of the larg
est and most important transactions ever re
corded is now on foot, lt is nothing less
than a trade between Jay Gould and Presi
dent Garrett, of the Baltimore Ohio road,
whereby the entire Baltimore it Ohio tele
graph system is to be transferred to Gould,
who now practically owns the Western
Un on. In return for the same
President Garrett is to receive the
Wabash system, thus giving the Bal
timore & Ohio a line to Kansas
City from Baltimore. The magnitude of
a deal of this kind can scarcely be under
stood, but it is known to officials of the Gould
system here that the Baltimore &Ohio have
long been seeking to extend their opera
tions west of the Missouri river. The in
formation is believed to be thoroughly re
liable, and it is said to be substantiated by
memoranda made by the late 11. M. Hoxte
prior to Ins death, and found among certain
papers that had been laid away for future
reference. The secret leaked out through a
party who desired to arrange with Fort
Worth capitalists to operate in Western
Union and Baltimore & Ohio stocks as soon
as there were any indications that the bar
gain has been consummated.
THE REPORT DENIED.
New York" Dec. 8. — A reporter handed
Jay Gould a copy of the dispatch statng
that a deal between tlie Western Union and
the Baltimore &, Ohio hid been arranged.
Mr. Gould read the dispatch and then took
a pen and wrote the following across the
face of it: "There is not a word of truth
in it" Mr. Bates, of the Baltimore &
Ohio, was also seen, and he denied each
and every statement made iv the dispatch.
Baltimore, Dec. 8. — Dr. Barnard, as
sistant to President Garrett, of the Balti

of it. While he would make no reply, he
said to the interviewer: "i will simply
laugh you out of the office." The officials
of the Baltimore & Ohio declared there was
nothing in it.

s oner between Milwaukee and St. Paul.
1 he other roads insisted that the St. Paul's

The hand-refusing racket as between

twenty-one years ago, when Gen. Sherman
showed his ill-temper and his ill-breeding
by refusing the proffered hand of Edwin

ceed in reviving and popularizing that
particular form of expressing personal dis
respect by selecting a funeral as the occa
sion, and a man like Senator Edmunds as
the object and example. Mr. Blame has
in the past few years extended the hand of
fellowship to men who have said worse
things of him than Senator Edmunds ever
— the men. for instance, who defeated
him in Cincinnati in 1876. It may be that
Mr. Edmunds erred, under the circum

Blame, but if so it was an error on the
right side, while Mr. Blame's refusal was
an error on the wrong side. Mr. Blame
