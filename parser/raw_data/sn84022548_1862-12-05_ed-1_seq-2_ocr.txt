No Help.
We have no help yet, and what is
wow, we hiivtj no hope of gettinjj any
right away. We hare hod (he promise
of three band within the lat four weeks,
and alt have failed us. We are alone
and of course cannot get out the Stand
ard as it should he. We shall do the
best we can, and our subscribers must he
patient. It is worse for us than it is for
them. We shall publish no paper next
week, unless we cun get a journeyman.
The fact is, there nre hut few printers in
the state ; nearly all having gone to the
war. Four have left our office alone for
the array of tho Potomac, and there is
probuhly not an officii in tho state hut
what hr.s done us well, or better.
" That's what's the matter."
1. S. Since the above was in type
help has arrived. We sliuli issue a pa
per, though late in the week. Hooray !
(3" We publish hut a email portion of
the president's message. IIo has hut lit
tle to say about the war hardly enough,
we think.
Tkntii Rkgimknt. The following is
an extract from a private letter from
Capt. Hiram It. Steele of Co. K, (Derby
Line) lOlh regiment, dated Camp Gro
ver, Offutt's Cross Road, Md., Nov.
20tb :
" We lelt our old quarters at Seneca
Lock with all the log cabins and other
improvements last week Thursday, (13th)
and came to our present camp. Our
whole brigade are now encamped togelh
r and drilling. Ours is the last regiment
and has the right of the brigade. The
new camp is pleasant and healthy and
twelve miles from Washington. We are
not attached to any division but form an
Independent brigade, under command of
Col. Davij of the 30th fllass., Gen. Gro
ver having been ordered to a more re
sponsible position.
Our Colonel Jewell is very populnr.
We are proud of him and mean he shall
be of us. Capt. Chandler has been pro
moted tu Major. I enjoy the life here
very much, like better than anything else
I ever did.
I went with Capt. Frost of the St.
Johosbury company as officer of the day,
a few days since, to a store near our
camp and seized a quantity of whiskey
and emptied it into the ground. We en
force the Maine law without any jury
trials.
We have bad no encounter with the
enemy yet. I hope you will hear a good
account of us when we do."
Dr. Huntoon will be at North
Troy on Monday afternoon, Dec. 8, and
at South Troy on Tuesday forenoon, De
cember 9 i at Coventry in the afternoon,
and hereafter can be consulted at Derby
Centre or Derby Line at most times, by
enquiring nt the Derby Line Hotel, or
at the Rev. D. S. Dealer's, Derby.
Cy In consequence of the great rise
in printing paper, the papers throughout
the country are raising in their price
adding 25 and 50 cents per year.
The Rbbicl Aumt is Viikiinia.
The Baltimore correspondent of the
New York Herald assert) that 83,000
rebel troops have been ordered from
the West and South to the defense of
Richmond against the refits of attacks
the Confederates expect to be made
upon that city. He also estimntes the
rebel nrmy to he 405,000, and that por
tion of it under the general command of
Lc to be 350,000. Of this number he
locates 123,000 in front of the army of
the Potomac j 50.000 composing the reb
el right wing along the Rappahanoek j
70,000 with the left wing under Jack
son'; 80,000 at Richmond, Fort Darling
and Saxlon's Junction, and 25,000 on
the penirs'ilii. The same authority says
there is reason to believe the design of
Lee to be to engage tie atttn im of
Burnside somewhere between Fred

one of the divisions of his army while
he marches by wiy of Warrenlon and

From the Eighth Regiment.
We are permitted to publish the follow
ing letter from F. D. ButterGeld of Co.
B, 8th regiment, now on service in the
Signal Corps to Col. Steele of Derby
Line :
Thiiiodkauxvillu, La., 1
Nov. 9, 18C2. J
Friend Steele, Yours of ultimo came
duly to hand ; I thank you for the favor
nnd the interesting matter it contained,
and will endeavor in return to post yon
in the afluirs from this distant portion of
tho great battlefield. I am at present
very comfortably quartered with others of
the signal party in the once flourishing
village of Thibodeaux, but now almost
deserted. We have a large two story
house assigned to our party, and as our
services are not required in camp, we are
taking things easy.
On the 2-ith ultimo General Weilzal's
brigade, consisting of five regiments, 3
cavalry companies and ten batteries, left
New Orleans in transports and landed at
Donaldsonville, twenty five miles above.
We expected some opposition in landing,
hut were disappointed, as we should have
had an admirable opportunity of teach
ing the rebels thut non-interference is
their best policy when our gunboats are
arrived. We quartered in the deserted
houses of Donaldsonville Suturday night.
Next morning we took up our line of
along Bnyou La Fourche on both sides
of which there is a turnpike road, intend
ing to form a junction with the 8th reg
iment at La Fourche railroad crossing
some fifty miles distant. We marched
some twenty miles the first day and en
camped in the open field at night. We
saw some guerillas during the day and
shot one captain. We were on the march
early Monday morning, first taking the
precaution to throw one regiment, the 8 1 h
New Hampshire, across the Bayou, not
knowing when or where we miht meet
the enemy, knowing thut they were in
force somewhere in tho vicinity. We
had in from the start a bri
gade, enabling us to crofs at any point.
From information obtained from some
captured rebel pickets we expected some
warm work before night. My position
was in the rear with the 12th Connecti
cut. About 12 o clock we heard the
booming of cannon. I soon received the
message that the enemy were in position
on both sides of the Bayou and for the
12lh to move forward and cross the Bay
ou to the support of the 8th New Hamp
shire. The orders necessary fur the men
to relieve themselves of their knapsacks
were promptly given and executed, and
we moved forward on the double quick
abuut half a mile and across the Bayou.
We were under a heavy fne w hile cross
ing as the enemy's batteries were endea
voring to destroy the bridge. The ene
my consisted of the 18th Louisiana and
Crescent City regiments on this side,
posted In riflo pits under cover of woods-
supported by three pieces of artillery,
commanding our approach on either side
of the Bayou. In front was an open
field in which the 8th N. II. and 12ih
Conn, formed and advanced. Tho en
gagement lasted something over an hour,
when our hoys charged nnd the rebels
skedaddled. Ve captured 208 prisoners
and one gun, and killed Col. MePhettrs.
The rebel force on the other side of the
bayou consisted of 500 militia and Shin
nies battery of six pieces, but finding our
force so large retreated after firing a doz
en shots. The two Louisiana regiments
nre veteran troops and haye fought in
Virginia, but could not stand the charge
of our biave troops. Our loss in the en
gagement was 17 killed and 74 Bounded,
that of the enemy much less, owing to
their position and our superior numbers.
I nm of the opinion tl.nt they would noi
have made a stand nt all if they hnd
known our force. I had the misfortune
to have my horse wounded by n piece of
shell and become unmanageable; cannot
quite agree with soma writers that there
is music in shell and solid shot. We met
tho 8ih Vermont on Wednesday ; they
met wilh no opposition coming up the
railroad track, hut had considerable re
pairing to do. The 8th have gone on
some 18 miles above. We have direel
communication with the city by rail and
telegraph. Tae rebels have all skedad
dled and we hear are in force above Ber
wicks' Bay ; do not know whether we go
further or not. I am in good health and
spirits. Do wish " Mac" might get time
to clean out Virginia.
Mansfield' Dispensatory says that most
of the Sarsapanlla of the shops is inert
and worthless. Dr. Ainr in r;tinn
on this drug states that not only is it in

most of the preparations from it, or bear
I ing its name. He shows, however, that
President's Message.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House
of Representatives:
Since your last annual assembling, an
other year of health and bountiful har
vests has passed. And while it has not
pleased the Almighty to bless us with a
return of peace, we can but press on,
guided by the best light He gives us,
trusting that in His own good time and
wise way, all will he well.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
The correspondence touching foreign
affairs, which has taken place during last
year is herewith submitted in virtual com
pliance with a request to thut effect made
by the House of Representatives near the
close of tho last session of Congress.
If tho conditions of our relations with
other nations is less gratifying than it has
usually been nt former periods, it is cer
tainly more satisfactory than a nation so
unhappily distracted as we are might rea
sonably have apprehended.
In the month of June last there were
some grounds to expect that the maritime
powers, which at the beginning of our
domestic difficulties so unwisely and un
necessarily, as we think, recognized the
insurgents as a belligerent, would soon
recede from that position, which has only
proved less injurious to themselves than
to our own country ; but the temporary
reverses which afterward befell the na
tional nrms, and which were exaggerated
by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have
hitherto delayed that act of simple jus
tice. The civil war which has so radically
changed for the moment the occupation
and habits of ihe American people, has
necessarily disturbed the social condition,
and affected very deeply the prosperity,
of tho nations with which we have car
ried on a commerce that has been steadily
increasing throughout u period of half a
century. It has at the same time exci
ted political ambitions and apprehensions
which have produced a profound agita
tion throughout the civilized world.
In this unusual agitation we have for
borne taking part in any controversy be
tween foreign states and between parties
or factions in suc'.i states. We have at
tempted no propagandise and acknowl
edged no revolution, hut have left to ev
ery nation the exclusive conduct and
management of its own affairs. Our
struggle has been, of course, contempla
ted by foreign nations wilh reference less
to its own merits than to its supposed and
often exaggerated effects, and the conse
quences resulting to those nations them- j
selves.
Nevertheless, complaint on the part of
this government, even if it were just,
would certainly be unwiee.
The treaty with Great Britain for the
suppression of the African slave trade
bus been put into operation with a good
prospect of complete success. It is an
occasion of especial pleasure to acknowl
edge that the execution of it on the part
of Her Majesty's Government has been
marked with a jealous respect for the
authority of the United Slates and the
rights of their moral and loyal citizens.
Tho Convention wilh Hanover for the
abolition of the Stadt dues has been car
ried into full effect under the act of con
gress for that purpose.
A blockade o! three thousand miles ol
sea coast could not he established nnd
vigorously enforced in a season of great
commercial activity like the present,
without committing occasional misUkes
and inflicting unintentional injuries upon
foreign nations and their sulj-cts. A
civil war occurring in a country where
foreigners reside, nnd carrying on trade
under treaty stipulations, is necessarily
fruitful of complaints of the violation of
neutral rights. All such collisions tend
to excite misapprehensions, nnd possibly
to produce neutral reclamations between
nations which have a common interest in
preserving peacu and friendship. In
clear cases of these kinds I have, so far
as possible, heard and redressed com
plaints which have been presented by
friendly powers. There is, however, a
large and augmenting number of doubt
ful cases upon which the government is
unable to agree with governments whose
protection is demanded by the claimants.
There are, moreover, many cases in
which the United Slates or their citizens
suffer wrongs from the naval or military
authorities of foreign nations which the
governments of those slates are not at
once prepared to redress. I have pro
posed to some of the foreign nation thus
interested mutual conventions to ex
change and adjust such complaints.
proposition has been made especially to
Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and
to Prussia. In each case it has been
kindly received, but has not yet been
formally adopted.
COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION.
Oil the 22d day of September last a
proclamation was issued by the Execu
tive, a copy of which is herewith submit
ted. In accordance wilb the purpose
expressed in the second paragraph of
that paper, I now respectfully recall your
attention to what roiy be called compen
sated emancipation
A nation may be said to consit of its
territory, its people and its laws. The
territory is the only part which is of cer
tain durability. One generation passeth
away and another generation comcth, but
the earth abideth forever.
It is of the first -mportance to consider
and estimate this ever enduring part
that portion of the earth's surface which
is owned and inhabited by the people of
the United States is well adapted to be
the home of one national family, and it
is not well ndnpted for two or more.
Its vast extent and its variety of cli
mate and productions are of advantage
in this nge for one people, whatever they
might have been in former ages. Steam
and telegraphs in intelligence have bro't
these to be an advantageous combination
for one united people.
In the inaugural nddress I briefly
pointed out the total inadequacy of dis
union as a remedy for Ihe differences be
tween the people of the two sections. I
did so in language which I cannot im
prove, and which therefore I beg to re
peat. One section of our country believe
slavery is right and ought to be extend
ed, while the other believe it is wrong
and ought not to be extended. This is
the only substantial dispute. The fugi
tive slave clause of the constitution and
the law for the suppression of the Afri
can slave trade are each as well enforced,
perhaps, as any law can ever be in a
community where the moral sense of the
people imperfectly support the law itself.
The great body of the people abide by
the legal obligation in both cases, and a
few break over in each. This I think
cannot be perfectly cured, and it would
be worse in both cases, after the separa
tion of the sections than before.
The foreign slave trade now impeiftct
ly suppressed would be ultimately re
ceived without restriction in one section,
while fugitive slaves, now only partially
surrendered, would not be surrendered at
all by the others.
SEPARATION IMPOSSIBLE.
Physically speaking, we cannot separ
ate. We cannot remove our respective
sections from each other, nor build an
impassable wall between. A husband
and wife may be divorced aad go out of
the presence and beyond the reach ol
each other, but the different parts of our
country cannot do this they cannot but
remain face to face, and intercourse, ei
ther amicable or hostile, must continue
between them. Is it possible then to
make that intercourse more advantageous
or more satisfactory after separation than
before ? Can aliens make tieaties easier
llian friends can roads a laws ? Cun trea
ties he more faithfully enforced between
aliens than laws tan be among friends?
Suppose you go to war, you cannot
fight always, and when, after much loss
on both sides and 10 gain on either, you
cease fighting, the identical old questions
as to terms of intercourse are again upon
you. There is n line straight or crook
ed suitable for a rational boundary upan
which to divide.
Trace througl from the east to the
west upon tho line between the free and
slave country an! we shall find that a
little more than one third of its length
are rivers easy to be crossed and popula
ted, or soon to be populated, thickly, upon
both sides, while nearly all its remaining
length are merely surveyors' lines, over
which people nmy walk back and forth
without any cons:iousness of their pres
ence. No part of this line can be made any
more difficult to pass by writing it down
on paper or parchment as a national
boundary. The fact of separation, if it
comes, gives up on the part of the sec
tional obligations upon the seceding sec
tion of the fugitive slave clause, along
with all other constitutional obligations
ppon the section seceded from, while I
should expect no treaty stipulation would
ever be made to take its place. But
there is another difficulty ; the great in
terior region, bounded east by the Alle
gbanies, north hy the British dominions,
west by the Rocky Mountains, and south
by the line along w hich the culture of
corn and cotton meets, and which includes
part of Virginia1, part of Tennessee, all
of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas,
Iowa, Minnesota and the Territories of
Dacotah, Nebraska and part of Colorado
has above ten millions of people and will
have fifty millions within fifty years fF
not prevented by any political folly or
mistake. It contains more than one-third
of the country owned by the United
Slates certainly more than one million
of square miles, one half as populous as
Massachusetts already is, or would have
more than seventy five millions of peo
ple. A glance at the map shows that, ter
ritorially speaking, it is the great body of
the Reuublic The other parts are but
marginal borders to it.
The magnificent region sloping west
from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific
being the deepest and also tin richest in
developed resources in the production of
provisions, grains, grasses, aud all which
proceed from them.
This great interior region is naturally
one of (be most i upon ant in the world.
Ascertain from the statistics the small
proportion of the region which has as
yet been brought into cultivation, and also
the large and rapidly increasing amount
of its products and we shall be over
whelmed with the magnitude of the pros
pect presented, and yet this region has no
sea coast and touches no ocean any
where. As part of one nation its people now
find and may forever find their way to
Europe by New York to South Ameri
ca, and Africa by New Orleans, and to
Asia by San Francisco. But separale
our common country into two nations, as
designed by the present rebellion, and
every man of this great interior region
is thereby cut off from some one or more
of these outlets, not perhaps by a phys
ical barrier, but by embarrassing and on
erous trade regulations; and this is true
wherever a dividing or boundary line
may be fixed. Place it between the now
free and slave country, or place it south
of Kentucky, or north of Ohio, nnd still
the truth remains that none south of it
can trade to any part or pluco north of it,
and none north of it can trade to any
part or place south of it, except upon
terms dictated by a government foreign
to them. These outlets, east, west and
south, are indispensable to the well being
of the people inhabiting and to inhabit
this vast interior region, which of the
three may be best is no proper question ;
all are better than either and all of right
belong to that people and to their suc
cessors forever. True to themselves,
they will not ask whero aline of separa
tion shall be, but will vow rather that
there shall be no such line. Nor are the
marginal regions less interested in these
communications to and through them to
the great outside world.
They too and each of them must have
access to this Egypt of the West without
paying toll at the crossing of any nation
al boundary. Our natfbnal strife sprung
not from our permanent part, not from
the land we inhabit, not from our nation
al homestead. There is no possible sev
ering to this but would multiply and not
mitigate evils among us. In all jts ad
aptations nnd amplitudes it demands
Union nnd abhors separation ; in fact
it would ere long force re-union, however
much of blood nnd treasure the separa
ibn might Miavo cost. Our strife per
tains to ourselves, to the passing genera
tions of men and it cannot without convul
sion be hushed forever with the passing
of one generation.
Tit a Mississippi a.ki ti;e Xoivrn
west. The Grenada (Miss.) Appeal
of Nov. 14 has an article treating of the
relations of the Northwestern States
with New England, the effect of the
war upon each section, aud the interest
of the former in the navigation of the
Mississippi. New England is repre
sented as growing rich upon the war,
from active employment furnished to its
spinners, shoemakers, shipwrights, foun
ders, nrtisans of all kinds. The West,
on the contrary, has no new demand for
its products, is shut out from the great
Southern! market, and is paying enor
mous freights to railways owned by
Eastern capitalists for transporting its
grain, flour nnd bacon to the Atlantic
seaboard. Under these circumstances
the Appeal is not surprised that the
Northwest is clamoring for the destruc
tion of Vicksburg, and the opening of
the Mississippi to commence. But at
the same time the Appeal contends that
the capture of Vicksburg will not affect
the commercial condition of the North
western States, because until Mr. Lin
coln can line both shores of the Missis
sippi, from Cairo to New Orleans, with
armed men, no trading vessel can nav
igate its waters. The Northwestern
States profess to ho fighting for the
Union, but that means nothing more
than free trade on the Mississippi.
When Vicksburg is taken tljey will find
themselves as far as ever from their ob
ject ; and as "they have no sympathy
with New England, further than New
England may aid the - West in opening
the great river to the commerce of the
West," the Appeal believes they will be
reaily to cut adrift from (he East. Af
ter these speculations the Appeal comes
to the nub of the matter as follows :
Twelve months ago a gentleman pro.
posed to the Confederate authorities to
go to Ihe Northwest, and quietly and
through the press, to urge the necessity
of an alliance between those States and
those of the lower valley of the Missis
sippi, It was then thought by our lead
ers that we would soon put an end to
this struggle, and (be Northwest, under
the supposition that we sought to deprir j
them of their most valued commercial
rights, has continued to furnish the Fed
eral Government with (he bravest and
best troop in the Northern armies. Of
late, this subject has again attracted at
tention, and if we nre not ill-informed
our government has been induced to give
it serious attention.
Southerners may imagine that they
can detach Ihe great Northwest from tl.s
Union, but they will find themselvts
greatly deceived.
Rebel Negotiations. There ap
pears to have been some truth, after all
in the recent rumors of some negotia
tions going on between leading rebels
nnd certain prominent Democrats of New
York city. In a speech delivered last
Saturday e;vening, Fernando Wood is
reported to have spoken substantially us
follows :
" Mr. Wood said he had received in
formation uud had communicated it to
tho government, that under certain cir
cumstances the South were ready to re
turn aye, from leading statesmen of ti e
South. Men of position and influence
in the southern confederacy had express
ed a desire to return under a Democratic
rule ; the past lo he forgotten, the public
debt oh both sides to be provided fur, and
they were willing to let by-goues bn b)
gones if the North would, and tho Union
once again bo restored. (Terrific cheers,
lasting several minutes)."
Feveiis. There have been an un
usual number of cases of fevers in this
vicinity the present fall the old inhab
itants say more than heretofore for many
years. Some one who has taken pains
to ascertain, finds there have been some
ninety cases in and within one mile of
Bradford village. They have not been
howevei of a malignant type, and but few
cases comparatively have proved fatal.
