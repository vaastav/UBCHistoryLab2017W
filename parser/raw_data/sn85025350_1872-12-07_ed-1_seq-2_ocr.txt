FROSTBURG. MD, DEC. 7.1872.
Death of Horace Greelev.
This event occurred on Friday eve
ning of last week, after a short period
l illness, superinduced by intense
•train of physical and mental power,
incident to an arduous political cam
paign. To this was added patient, ex
haustive watchings by the side of a
dying wife, whose death was closely
followed . by overwhelming political
defeat before the great tribunal of the
American people. Few instances oc
cur where misfortunes of such magni
tude are visited upon a .-ingle family
in such rapid and quick succession.
So deep and so penetrating has this
•udden and melancholy event affect
ad the American people, that, al
though they chose another, friends and
foes throughout the country, are uni
ted and concurrent in the fact that a
great, good, and mighty man has been
lost to the country and the world !
I.ips, erewhile so blatant of political
d -traction, arc not only hushed to
•tillness by the clods which fall upon
his coffin, but are eloquent with eulo
gy. So commanding is the respect for
the illustrious dead that the President
gracefully leaves his chair, the Cabi
net breaks its routine, and the superior
branch of the National Legislature
adjourns, to show the world how a
great people honorrs the sovereignty of
intellect.
Mr. Greeley's great abilities as a
journalist require no mention. In this
profession he has. by general consent,
long since stood at the head. His
opinions were alwavs originally and
fearlessly expressed, no matter who
rose or fell by tbc stroke of bis pen.
In the common walks of life he was
large-souled and large-hearted. He
committed errors and sustained defe >ts
but the calendar of right records a
vast plurality of his triumphs.
Ilis life was marked by the vicissi
tudes common to all who have to
struggle upward from the lower walks,
but its success was so splendid that
even the Presidency would not have
touched it with additional lustre.—
In his own mind there was grandeur
in the thought of having founded that
potential engine of public opinion, the
New York Tribune, but the more en
lighten >d j tdgment of i outing gcu
erationsof men will confer, if possible,
a more magnificent distinction by just
ly esteeming him the printer-philoso
pher of the nineteenth century.
The funeral of Mr. Greeley occurred
in New York on Wednesday at the
Church of the Divine Paternitv.—
The sermon was delivered by Ilev.
■ Henry Ward Beecher. Many persons
of distinction were present, inclu
ding the President, Vice-President,
Vice-Fresident-elect, members of the
Cabinet, Chief Justice, Senators and
Representatives. The procession was
one of the most imposing funeral pa
geants ever witnessed in New York.
The second session of the fortv
third Congress convened on Monday.
The President's Message has so far
been the leading incident.
It is a plain, official document, cred
itable alike in conception and compo
sition.
The electoral college of the State
met at Annapolis on Wednesday and
cast the vote of Maryland for Hon.
Thomas A. Hendrick, of Indiana, for
President, and Hon. B. Gratz Brown,
f Missouri.

Borden Siiaet, Dec. 5,1572.
The epizootic lias finally developed
itself in this place, notwithstanding
the efforts of Mr Morgan Thomas.
the hostler, to guard against it. Up
to this date only seven horses have
been attacked, five belonging to the
Borden Company and two belonging
to Mr. William R. Bernard, the
miller, in this place. I learn that
two hogs, belonging to Mr. George
Ke:k, of this place, died in the latter
part of last week with all the symp
toms of the horse malady represented.
On last Tuesday evening, Mr. W i.l
iam G. McMillan, of this place, was,
1 dressing a beef suspended by “rope and
blocks’’ to the limb of a tree, when >
! the limb broke resulting in that pro- |
j cions piece between the tail and horns ,
' finding its way to terra firma.

i Brain wotk costs more food than j
hard work. According to careful es- '
| lima'es and analyses of the excretions, j
three hour;; of hard study wear out \
the body more than a whole day of !
severe physical labor. Another c-vi- ;
donee of the cost of brain work is ob- ;
i tained from the fact that though the
\ brain is only one-fortieth the weight
of the body it receives about one-fifth
of all the blood sent by the heart into \
the system. Brain workers, therefore, !
require a more liberal supply of food, :
and richer food, than manual laborers, i

If I were in Calafornia, said a young
fop. in company the other evening, in- i
stead of working in the mines, I would
waylay some miner with a bag of gold,
knock out his brains, gather up the
gold and run. I think you would do
better to gather up the brains, quietly
responded a young lady. A man
should always secure what he is most

Mr. Editor ; —'That the car of pro
i, gression is rolling, the aggregating
facts of the day indisputably confirm.
;, Whether we cast our glances at the
* I religious, political, or scientific world,
' ! the impress ot advancement meets our
r j gaze, and the tendencies of all combine
tj to purify the bodies moral and civil
I and, ultimately, to unfold the grand
- | eur and beauties of creation's occult
j works. It needs no prophetic vision,
I with the accumulated experience of
4 | the past and the light of the present
! to guide the way, to divine the mighty
■ j store of grand events that the cycles
, of futurity will unfold. Allied to
these by the bonds of close sympathy,
and keeping pare with their stately
strides, are our educational facilities.
! Contrasted with the past, and we need
1 not step far backward in the "corri
! dors of time” to appreciate the itn
! mense improvement, as regards the
mental, hygienic and governmental
inffiiences.
The writer hereof, though he can
not be classed among the "old inhabi
tants, preserves a vivid remembrance
of those halcyon (?) days, when
—“lie was sent to school
To save a wit or spoil a fool."
Frowns and smiles alternate as memo
ry indulges in such reminiscences of
"auld laiig sync.” Those long, weary
hours, the consummation of which
was to extract same mental food from
abstruse old compendiums whose cc-
J lebrity were proportionate to their
1 unintelligible pi.raseologv. It instil
\ latton accelerated not iiifreqiicntlv bv
' j vigorous applications of a "cat o' nine
tails, or medium-sized sapling. Mav
no resurrecting arm ever evoke from
the murky shades of oblivion such
; scholastic jargon, to rack again the
t - cranimns of present and unborn gen
erations '
1 S Me have been led into this train of
f l retleel ions by thoughts suggest ins;
; themselves upon a recent visit to the
. j I'ublie S, nooN of o ir town, uinlor tho
| control of I’rof. R. R. S.VNNEKand his
I efficient assistants. This being the
, last week of the first term, it has been
principally confined to manuscript and
j oral examinations. The exhaustive
and close methods pursued, combined
with the generally remarkable profic
ienev displayed, elicited our warmest
admiration. One young gentleman,
particularly, in the branches of writ
ten and mental arithmetic, scored 100
per cent., or perfection, with a nearlv
similar good showing in the others, a
nicety ot finish that plainly indexes
i good material and tine moulders. The
line standard generally maintained bv
the classes, mentally and ntorallv, give
evidence of good and careful instruc
tion and discipline, and deservedly
entitles the accomplished Professor
and assistants to a more than ordinary
measure of commendation and sup
-1 port. One feature, to our mind wor
; thy of especial attention in the exam
i nit ion. was the practi a! methods
adopted ; a variation from the old sys
tem ol grinding out some confused
knowledge obtained by cramming pro
cesses. but useful, practical questions,
and appurtenant to the realities of ev
; c y day life, and calling into requisi
tes the unaided power and resources
of the students.
Where all are good, it may scorn
invidious to distinguish, vet we can
not refrain from the temptation to al
hide particularly to the remarkable
faculties possessed by the Vice Prin
cipal, Miss Lillie Browne, for her
responsible position. It is a novel,
entertaining and instructive scene to
witness a series of her geographical
and lnsterical class recitations. Using
the b'ackheard and a blank chart as
t ie bases, the system becomes a pecul
iar power in arresting and strongly
impressimg (he facts as given upon
; the minds of her pupils.
| Some other facts we would like to
notice but space forbids Frostbtitg
can point with pride to her school.-, ,
and. though lacking the heraldry !
and laudation so voluminously bestow
ed upon similar institutions in morel
prominent localities, yet, for all |
that enters into a true, solid and
practical education, we admit not su
periority, and we tender our congrat
ulations to the parents and citizens of
our town in the possession of such
advantageous management.
For its Principal we see in the pros
pective a more elevated position to j
which his talent and attainments in I
this line w ill demand him.
One other item nd we close. We
would call the attention of "w homso
ever it may concern.” ineluding our ;
"city fathers,” to the building and sur
rmndings. Some measures should le
adopted looking towards the handsome
; enclosure and proper ornamentation m
I the grounds. It is lamentable that
it has been so long and so grossly m -
; I acted. Let ns treasure what few of
i ficiencies” we have, for it seems w e
i are opposed to any farther increase
1 in that line. ***

Advice
TO THOSE ABOUT TO BUY
Sewinci Machines!
When you arc asked to buy a Sewing
Machine, ask yourself a few
questions like the
following:
Wlnt can be the reason for advising me
to get I Ins Machine ?
Do they really know any better than my
‘ self which is best, or have they a selfish in
terest in the matter?
i If I buy it and find I have not the best,
who will be the loser? Will they, or can
they, give me all the necessary instructions '
for using the Machine and keeping it in
' order?
i
i If I buy this Machine wliat assurance
' have I that I can get it repaired without
