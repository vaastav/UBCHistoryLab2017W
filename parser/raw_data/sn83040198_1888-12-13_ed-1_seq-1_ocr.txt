A new creamery at Cheeuey, Kan
sas, started up last week, and is paying
right from the start. We would like
to know that our farmers had become
awakened to the need of united action
in the starting of uch an institution.
On the 8th day of January the
Kansas legislature will convene. It is
hard t predict what it will do,as Kan
sas legislatures (of the same politics)
heretofore have not done very much
that they ought to and a good deal
that "bad'nt orter."
JLokd Salisbury's declaration in
favor of woman suffrage in England
has produced a profound impression
and several of the leading papers of
that country have earnestly indorsed
it. He says he speaks only for him
self, but there is a reason to believe
that he seeks to make the idea a Gov
ernment measure, and that it will re
ceive strong . support in the rank of.
his party. ' ,
"We have been accused," writes a
Kansas editor, "of having to eat a
great deal of crow lately. To brand
this as a calumny would give but feeble
expression to our. sentiments. We
have eaten nothing forfour days, which
our wife can prove. As a matter of
fact a crow just now, would be regard
ed as a delicacy, andit is doubtful
whether we would stick at the f eathers.
Hunger feiakes slaves of us all."
It is estimated that the poor quality
of the whisky being sent to Kansas is
contributing a large share towards
temperance. For instance, adultera
tion is going on at such a rate and as
ach succeeding consignment contains
greater quantities of water, our drink
ers will soon get used to the taste of
water and the time will only' be short
until the can take it. straight come
to it by degrees. We believe the
argument will hold togather. Ex.
Farmers of Kansas have been in the
habit of relying too much on the nati
ural richness of our soil, and thousands
of tons of manure are left in heaps
about the barns and stock pens, while
it should have been hauled out during
the winter months and spread upon the
fields. "Eternal vigilance" is the price
of agricultural success as well as "lib
erty," and the man who conducts his
farm to win is the man who does not
let a single chance to improve the pro
ductiveness of his soil escape him..
While the Woman's Congress was
in session at Detroit last week a num
ber of the ladies were robbed in the
crowded aisles each time the meetings
were dismissed and although a very
o small number of men were present the
.. police could never fasten suspicion, on
' any one. Mrs. L. S. Fox discovered
the thief by a peculiar smell which she
noticed while being robbed and pointed
him out to detectives who arrested
him and made the discovery that he
was the mos daring and. clever thief
v in Michigan, with a dozen aiases.
The traveling public will feel like
' commending the city council for pasa-
, ing the ordinance, last Monday night,
. locating the hacks and omnibuses at
the Santa Fe depot on the north side of
tbe home track and away from the plat
form where passepgers alight from
trains. The railroad company are widen
ing the platforms, putting down new
walks, and otherwise arranging matters
to make them convenient and less
dangerous to travelers. Let the new or
dinance now be enforced without fear
or favor, and there will be no - more
v ; trouble from that locality.
A DRUMMEii stopped at Columbus
Tenn., the other day and for a joke
made the remark that his sympathies
" had bjjen aroused a few days before, by
A the suffering in Jacksonville,. leaving
his listeners to infer that he had been
there. He had the room to himself for
about five minutes at the end of which
time he was confronted by two armed
men, who, despite his explanations,
inarched him off to a tent in the woods,
where , he was, compelled to stay all
night under quarantine. , Next day he
was soaked for an hour in . diluted car
bolic acid and his clothes hung over
burning sulphur, after which he was al
lowed to go. He does riot joke on that
subject any more. Ex. t
P:orLK in the west will now begin
to learn of the "beauties-of protection."
Here is an extract from a prominent
lawyer of Pittsburg, Pa. who has large
amounts of money invested in that city.
The letter is to a democratic friend in
Kansas, and bears date of November
20th, 1888. The writer understands
the situation, but naturaly cannot help
but profit by his circumstances. He
says:
"Well, I voted for your part of the
country, and as you did not vote for
yourselves, I am now free to enjoy the
prosperity which the taxation of the
west will bring to Pennsylvania. If
the west is willing to be taxed in order
that Pennsylvania manufacturies may
be run at a profit, I will just take my
share under the law of distribution
tho' honesty compels me not to vote to
levy a tax to meet our losses."
Lost and Perished.
The three-year-old boy of Hiram
Dyer well known in this county,strayed
away from the Bent Canyon camp, on
the e range in the Indian territory on
the 2nd inst., and was not found until
the 7th inst., when it died . within
fifteen minutes after being discovered.
Mr. Dyer is iu the employ of Gregory,
Eldred & Co., at their camp within
twelve miles of Camp Supply.' When
the child was missed from the camp,
a search was instituted and continued
until the next day without avail. Two
companies of soldiers and thirty Indian
scouts at Camp Supply were turned out
and they searched for several days, as
did the employes of every cow camp in
that section. Wednesday, a son of Mr.
Andrews beard a dog barking on a
range and going to the spot discovered
the child. The little dog had remain
ed with it five days and four neights.
The child was barely alive when dis
eoveredanddied within fifteen minutes.
It had strayed eight miles from' home
and had been without food or water and
exposed to the frost and cold. . The
many friends of the parents in this
county extend their sympathy. Medi

The Last Word.
The Coolidge Times has .changed
hands, Mr. L. I. Purcell, formerly of
the Newton Chronicle, has purchased
the business. Brother Kenneth V.
Snorf grows eloquent in his "good bye."
He says;
"There is the last rose of summer
its taded petals dropping from the stem;
the-last glimpse of homeland fading
from the sight of the emigrant; the last
bird of autumn as it wings its way
Southward and sings its farewell song:
the last good-bye between friends who
may never meet again this side the
valley of the shadow of death that
land where flowers never wither and
where good-byes are never heard. All
of these are sad, indeed; but for me to
bring myself to write the last para
graph for the paper for whose welfare
I have daily toiled is to me a sadder
thing, and as I bid farewell to the
many constant readers and patrons of
the Times I do so with the solemnity
of one parting forever with those near
and dear, and bear in mind the truth
and righteousness of the cause of jour
nalism and remember that truth must
conquer,' because
'The years of the eternal God are hers,'
and with this last thought to guide my
pen and give me hope for the future, I
write my good-bye."
The "Social Glass."
The entertainment given at the opera
honse Saturday night, by teachers and
students of the Central Normal Col
lege, was in every way a success. The
well known elocutionary ability of
several of the ladies and geutlemen
taking part infthe drama was assurance
to the puplic that something above the
usual amateur entertainment might
be expected, and the very large audi-?
ence which assembled was not in the
least disappointed. Prof. E. E, Wright
as BQb Brittle" captured the audience
right from the start. Mrs. Stryker as
4JJva" and Mrs. Jobson as Nettie
Xettiebey," were each perfect in their
portrayal of the characters they repre
sented; while Profs. Gaines and Hempy
and in fact all the balance of the
college people taking part in the play
acted their parts exceedingly well.
The orchestra furnished good music,
the hall was well warmed and lighted,
the ushers were attentive, and every
thing appeared to pass oft pleasantly.
Financially the entertainment was, we
learn, also a success. Tfce proceeds
were' for the benefit of the ;Y.,M. and

Quay's Methods.
There is every prospect of a lively
overhauling of republican election
methods in New York, Indiana, West
Vriginia and Michigan by the present
democratic house this winter. Demo
cratic - congressmen from the close
states who have arrived in Washing
ton in tue past few days are all eager
for such an investigation as that which
followed the counting out of Samuel J.
ruaen, ana tney aver j;tnat sucn an
inquiry 'will certainly show, .that Mr.
Harrison's majority in the electoral
college was secured by what Roscoe
Conkliug would have called "forbidden
and abhorrent means."
A conference of . democratic leaders
of the house .will be held at which the
whole subject will be discussed and a
plan of; actiou agreed upon. It is
probable that such an inquiry will be
conducted by a special committee of
the bouse, made up from the ablest
lawyers of that body. The resolution
may be drawn so as to make it call for
an inquiry into the conduct of certain
United States supervisors of election in
New York and elsewhere, but that will
be only the pretext for an investiga
tion, which will be far reaching in its
scope and will take in the hundreds of
well authenticated cases of bribery
which have come to light since election
day. A score of affidavits and some
confessions are said to be already in
possession of leading democrats and
more are being secured in all the states
where the integrity of the elections is
suspected.
AH the leading republicans who have
collected and handled large sums of
money and persons who are suspected
of receiving the Dudley circular are on
the list of the investigators. Names of
republican workers in some of the rural
counties in New York are said to be
included in very interesting affidavits
that have been received. Among
others who may be subpoenaed to ex
plaiu certain matters when the investi
gation starts are W. W. Dudley, Attorney-General
Michener, and W. R.
McKeen of Indiana; Col. Elliott F.
Shepard, John J. O'Brion and Albert
Daggett of New York; Col Henry L.
Swords of Iowa, Steven B. Elkins of
New Mexico and West Virginia, James
J. Balden of Syracuse. John Jarrett of
Pittsburg, James P. Foster of New
York, and Carson Lake of Ohio. The
affidavits, however, will be the main
dependence of the committee, and it is
expected that only side lights will be
thrown on the condition of affairs by
the testimony of these witnesses.

This Trust Business.
The railroad kings of the country
held a meeting last week to take iuto
consideration the advisability of form
ing a railroad trust. It appears J.
Gould, of the Missiouri Pacific, and
Strong, Mr. of the Santa Fe favors the
movement. .We look upon this move
on the part of the railroad companies
as a bad omen to the people. This
trust business is getting to be one of
the greatest curses that exists in this
con ntry and should receive the atten
tion of our law makers. E&ifister.
We can heartily endorse your opinion
of "this trust business," Bro. Charles,
and admire your foresight in lying low
on the subject before the late election.
4Xhis trust business" is one of the
'greatest curses" imposed upon the
Amercan people,notwithstanding J. G.
B!aiue,of Maine,sent out the weighty(?J
opinion that they were "largely
private affairs and should not be in
terfered with even by the president of
the XJnited States." It will suit demo
crats just as well if, after the "attention
of our law makers" has been called to
the evils which the democratio plat
form and the democratio party . said
should be remedied, they, the said law
milkers, (republican law makers,) bring
about the desired reform and a recon
struction of laws that will benefit the
people; it will suit us just as well as if
we had succeeded in the late election
and could bring about the desired leg
islation ourselves.

COST AlID PEOnT.
Our faith in the sugar industry of
Kansas is still strong, and we would
like to see Barton county farmers in a
position to reap the . benefits that un
doubtedly arise from the raising of
sorghum and the manufacture of sor
ghum sugar. ' Prof. E. B. Cowgill,
state inspector of the Kansas sugar in
dustry, estimates the cost ahd profitof
the business as follows:
"It is difficult to obtain accurate
fignres from the fact that the expense
from experimental work have not been
separated from expenses of manufac
turing. It is probably safe to place
the expenses properly charageable to
manufacturing including superintend
ence, la Dor, fuel and incidentals at $2
per ton of cleaned cane. The seed and
leaves are worth more than the cost-
when purchased with the cane at two
dollars per ton- so that the cleaned
cane may be put down at $2 per ton.
Add for maufacturing $2 per ton, and
we have a gross cost of product amount
ing to $4 per ton. The product as
realized iu properly equipped and skil
fully operated factories this season,
will not be far from sugar 100- pound?,
at 6Jcents, $6.25 molosses, 12 gallons
at 15 cents. $2.25 total, $8.50, cost of
cane and manufacturing, , $4; balance
4.50. A factory using 150 tons a day
would thus pay interest on a consider
able investment. When we consider
that sorghum cane grown as the farm
ers at Conway Springs and at Douglass
have grown it this season for their
factories, contains above 250 pounds of
sugar per ton, a yield of only 100
pounds seems shameful and shows
abundant room for improvement.
That improvement will be made there
is no doubt. Industry appeals to
science to point out the way and she
3hould not still her voice until cane
containing 250 pounds of sugar per ton
is made to yield in pure wnite crystals
at least 200 pounds."
Blake's Weather Predictions for 1839.
This book is ready for delivery. It
makes a book of 60 pages with 10 pages
of tables, in which the number of
inches of rainfall in each State and
part of Canada are civen for each
month of the year 1889. Also the max
imucu, minimum and mean temperature
for each month are given. The tables
also show what the average precipita
tion has been in each state for each
month for the past fifty years. It has
required over a year's labor, part of the
time with several assistants, to com
plete this boo!i. It also shows what
the weather will be in England and all
parts of Europe, as well as British
India, for 183D. leased upon these
weather predictions, a table of proba
ble prices for wheat, corn, oats and
cotton, for each month in the year, is
given. Mr. Blake's reputation for the
past fifteen years as a sientific meteor
ologist is too well known to need com
ment. He has predicted everv drouth
and wet season, and every warm, cold
or ordinary winter which has oecured
in tiiat time. Thl3 year the farmers of
Kansas have raised many million
bushels of corn more than they would
have done but for his predictions and
advice, as hundreds of them testify.
Following his advice as to the coming
season, they now have the largest acre
age of winter wheat ever sown in
Kanaas, and it is in splendid condition.
These tables show that next year will
produce the greatest extremes of
weather which have been known in
America for more than sixty years.
The floods will be great.and the drouths
still inreater. Success or failnre in
nearly every business next year will
depend upon knowing in advance what
the weather is to be. Price of the
boufc To cents. Address, C. C. Blake,

He Believes in Hell.
44 Why do more women than men go
to church? For the same reason that
more men than women go to the state's
prisons."
"Is there a hell? If there is not there
ought to be." '
4,Is. orthodoxy playing out? I think
SO. and am crlorl rf it- " -
That is, the way the Rev. Calvin S.
Black well talked to his congregation at
the Central church of Christ, in Chicago,
recently. ; .
In support of his first assertion? Mr.
Blackwell said: Men are grossertthan
women less spiritual. Women 30 to
church because they find spiritual food
there. Men go to other places to get '
food for their carnal natures. Men,
out of harmony with God's laws, don't
like to have their" consciences smitten
by sermons, songs and prayers. Men
like to do that which, pleases their
senses. Two things will equalize the -sex
in church attendance. Tne moral
code as in personal purity should be as
binding upon men as upon women. Go
ciety should be as exacting in punish
ment of men for breaches of this code
as of women. So long as society pets -
vice in men so long will meu flaunt vice
iu the face of society and neglect re
ligion. - i
4 When society decrees tar and f eath
ers for the first one that dares dabble "
in social filth 'then will - the '
have as many men as churches .
women. Tiie bible says that there is a
hell and I believe it. If not there ought
to be simply to give some rascals jus
tice in the next w orld who do not get it
in this. That there is a material hell
and physical punishment I believe not,
for the reason that flesh and blood are
of this life only. But I unquestionably x
believe in the unquenchable fire of self
reproach, the stings of uncurable re
morse; - the" bottomless pit Of despair.'
These torments are not arbitrary af
flictions from the hand of God, but
necessary results of " disobedience and
depraved character.
"Is orthodoxy playing out? I think
so and am glad of it. Orthodoxy is on-
ly what men have written and formu
lated into creeds and demanded that "
we of more light should read. Every
man should read the bibleland think
for himself and not by proxy. The
4 Historical Church' is well enough if
the history goes back to Christ and his
apostles with the testament and person
ality of Christ as the creed.
44 We live in an age of liberty and in
dividuality and must have the same
privileges in religion we have in other
things. A few churches can, no longer
monopolize all the wisdom of the bible."
Eeport of the Eegents of the University.
The sixth biennial report of the re
gents, chancellor and faculty of the
state university is before us. A care
ful review of the report impresses us
with the assurance that the regents
have an appreciation of the magnitude
and importance of their noble work,
and the full measure, of 'its require
ments. The university now presents
itself to the legislature as a university
proper, and already, young as it is, has
a recognized standing among educa
tors, in the same class with the Michi
gan university. . The regents ask only
for appropriations iu amount and for
purposes, indispensibly necessary to
the operation of the institution on the
present plan, and we believe that
the legislature will respond readily to
their reasonable request. Hitherto,our
university has received a less amount
of appropriation than any western
state institution of learning, with the
possible exception of Colorado, and has .
been accepted as maintaining a higher
gradt of instruction than any one of.
them. We are certain that the mem
bers of the legislature soon to assemble,
will find in these pages, arguments to
justify them in making proper support
of an institution whoss work has been so
successful, whootttlook is so bright,
and whosej ardent friemls are found in
every coAnty of the state. Lawrence
