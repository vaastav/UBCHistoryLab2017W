THE FIiAti AT THE MASTHEAD.
From Gov. David B. Hill's Albany Speech.
The principle cf Tariff Reform has
oxly met witu temporary defeat. soon
er or later it will ultimately triumph
in this country. president cleveland
and the Democratic pautv were right
AND DESERVED TO SUCCEED. TlSE ARGU
MENT WAS WITH US, AND TWO WEEKS' LONGER
DISCUSSION WOULD HAVE GIVEN US THE VIC
TORY. Permit me to suggest that there
MUST BE NO BACK TRACK TAKEN UPON THIS
QUESTION. The issue so COURAGEOUSLY
PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT CLEVELAND IN"
THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE MUST
NOT BE ABANDONED. Ol'll FLAG HAS BEEN
nailed to the mast and there it must
remain. Temporary disaster must not
be permitted to discourage us in our
UNSELFISH EFFORTS TO RELIEVE THE PEOPLE
FROM UNJUST AND UNNECESSARY TAXATION.
Temporary expedients will only endan
ger OR POSTPONE OUR. FINAL TRIUMPH. LET
US STEADFASTLY ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLE
of Tariff Reform, and the-clouds that
now obscure our pathway will soon pass
AWAY.
TARIFF REFORM Ml ST COME.
"Roger Q. Mills.
We must go on without a halt. It is
our mission to reduce tariff taxation and
remove the burden of th? people. We
will continue the fight for tai It! reform
until the next Presidential election and
then .iijal;i force the issue. It is the duty
of the next House of Representatives, if it
has a Democratic majority, to pass anoth
er tariff bill, and it is the duty of Demo
cratic orators and newspapers to educate
the people on the iniquity of unnecessary
taxation. The Tariff question must be
:opt to the front by the Democratic party,
whether in victory or defeat, until the
fjiirdens of the people are removed. I am
convinced that the West, especially, is
favorable to tariff reductiou, and that if
ti) issue had been raised by Cleveland in
his first message and wo had sufficient time
to educate the people the result of the
prent election would be U liferent. But
the defeat of Cleveland, though sincerely
co be regretted, will have no effect cn the
policy of the party on the tariff question.
'There will be no retreat, but a steady ad
vance. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
His message to Congress, read on Mon
day, will rank with the ablest of the State
papers that have marked President Cleve
iand's administration. It is straight lor
ward, manly, and bears the impress of
i-tatesmatwup. The country will applaud
the wise utterances of this wise and patri
otic man. If it will heed his notes of
warning and follow his counsel,the future
of our country will be brighter, safer and
happier. G rover Cleveland is stronger to
day in the affections and confidence of the
people- in defeat than Harrison can ever be
in Lis victory. The selfishness that com
passed his defeat will yet bring ruin upon
us unless the Tariff Revision, urged by Mr.
Cleveland, is made the policy of the gov
ornmenr. LROAH BUILDING IN EASTERN
NORTH CAROLINA.
The Chowan and Southern, now being
built from Tarboro to Norfolk, is expected
to be finished by next June and will open
up a new ront.1 between Norfolk and Ral
eigh. From Raleigh via Sclma, Rocky
Mount, Tarboro and Chowan and Southern,
svill be five miles farther than present
route via Wcldon. When, however, the
railroad now halting at Springhope is
pushed on to Raleigh (as it must be) this
will make the distance from Raleigh to
Norfolk by Tarboro fourteen miles shorter
than by Weldon.
The Halifax and Scotland Neck exten
sion if? under construction a3 far as Green
ville, and is to be extended next year on
to Kington and to Jacksonville in Onslow
county. This railroad is crossed seven
miles below Scotland Neck by the Chowan
and Southern, and a large town is expect
ed to spring up at their junction.
These roads together, with the railroad
now being built from Wiiliamston to Ply
mouth, will open up Northeastern North
Carolina to the State Capital.
The partially constructed railroad from
Ridgeway to Petersburg is to be finished.
This will put Raleigh forty miles nearer
Richmond and all Northern points tban
the present route via Weldon and forty
nine miies nearer than the route by Dur
ham and Oxford lately opened.
AX EDITOR A LA SULLIVAN.
Mr. Joseph P. Caldwell, editor of the
Statesville Landmark, has no special
fondness for fighting, but, if occasion de
mands, he is a tegular John L. Sullivan.
A few days ago two brothers of Mr. J. B.
Connelly assaulted Mr. Caldwell on the
street as he passed their store on his way
to dinner. He had on his overcoat. He
knocked one of them down and was chas
ing the other with a chair when he was
caught. lie got a bloody nose and a
scratch under the eye. If he whipped
two men with his overcoat on what would
he have done in his shirt-sleeves? The
Chronicle regrets to hear of the difficul
ty, but after a while people will learn that
editors will defend themselves when at
tacked, and it wont he health for the ag
gressors. The alleged reason for attacking Mr.
Caldwell was a publication that appeared
in the Landmark stating that Mr. J. B.
Connelly had been presented by the grand
jury.
- - -
i"R friend, Mr. Junius Williams, tells
us that a majority of the firms working
the turpentine business in Georgia are
North Carolinians, aud that a majority cf
those North Carolinians are from Samp
son, Cumberland and Robeson counties.
He also says that every commission busi
ness in Savannah is owned by North Caro
linians. This fact is simply another ex
ample to establish the almost proverbial
expression, "North Carolina is a good
place to be born in."' It does really seem
that our State is the very cradle of suc
cessful men. Clinton Caucasian.

Association. Tiku xceedingly appropriate
inscription for the monument was fun. till
ed by Miss Rebecca Cameron, of Hillsboro.
The cost of engraving the inscription,
some $200, was raised almost entirely by
her efforts.
The monument was executed by Mr.
Chas. A. Goodwin, Proprietor of the Ral
eigh Marble Works. It stands thirteen
feet high and is surmounted by a beauti
fully wrought urn with elegant drapery.
The caps are ornamented with delicately
carved oak leaves. On each side of the
monument is an appropriate inscription.
On the first is a delicately wrought mon
ogram consisting of the initials R. A. S.
with the following inscription underneath:
"IN MEMORI AM

The second side bears the following in
scription: 'A patriot whose honor and constan-

RESURGAM."
DESERVES WELL OF THE PARTY.
From News of Oxford.
Among the papers of the State that did
brave and noble work in tbe last campaign,
the State Chronicle stands in the first
rank. Joseplius Daniels, its brilliant and
fearless editor.never relaxed his watchful
ness and fought the white man's battle to
the bitter end. He is an uncompromising
foe of negroism and white reuecadeism
and deserves wei! cf his party. He is at
the State Capital, well equ p-ped for the
business, and should succeed himself as
State Printer. He did as much towards
gaining victory for the Democracy as any
o'h. i' uiiTi in the St -to. His time and his
purse were ut the disposal of h:S party,
and no man surprised him in the march
for Democratic victory.
To the Chronicle, and the efforts of X.
B. Bronghton. isdu" in an eminent degree
the defeat of John Nichols.
We are for Daniels for State Printer and
the Legislature will honor itself by honor
ing him.
THE II EST DEMOCRATIC
IN THE STATE.
P A PER
From the Franklin Press.)
Jo-ep Uiis Daniels, E.-q., will be a candi
date before the Legislature for re-election
to the office of Public Printer. He has held
the pffiee one term and naturally desires
an endorsement of his adn.inistratLjn,
which has been clean, op n aud honest.
He is editor of the best Democratic paper
in the State, and is due that much at tbe
hands of the party. So far as we have
learned he will have no opposition, and a
uuanimous re-election would be as graceful
as it woeld be deserving.
Sam Small spoke recently in New York
and he quoted as saing that the idea of
the Prohibitionists electing a President
anywhere in the near future was a roseate
lined delusion The Prohibitionists should
be more practical and make the fight on
the same line as in Atlanta, Ca. lie also
predicted that the Labor movement would
be stronger fiv years from now than it is
to-day.
. .
His friends throughout the State were
shocked Saturday at the announcement of
the sudden death of Judge Thomas Settle,
of Greensboro. The absence of the editor
postpones until next week an extended ac
count of the life and services of thji welb
known jurist and statesman.
A gentleman tells the Chronicle that
he thinks it looks like a great deal of cheek
for legislators, who have a free railroad
pass in their pockets and draw mileage
besides, to talk about passing a law for
bidding a Judge to ride on a free pass.
WHAT ANOTHER NEWSPAPER
MAN THINKS.
The Argus is glad to learn that Brother
Josephus Daniels, of the State Chroni
cle, is likely to be re elected State Printer.
He has done the work well for the past
two years! Moreover, his paper, the
State Chronicle ha done splendid ser
vice in the recent campaign, always freshj
interesting, instructive and bold, it added
thousands of votes to the Democratic col
umn. Its exposure of John Nichols over
a year ago paved the way for the splendid
triumph of Btinn and made it possible to
redeem the Metropolitan District. For
these reasons, among many others, the
Argus is for "Joe. DanieU" "first, last and

CONGRESS MEETS.
Vance and Ransom PresentPrp$ideiit'n
Message Read.
Special Cor. to State Chronicle.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. Congress
met to-day at noon with about three
fourths of the House present and all the
members of the Senate with the following
exceptions: Messrs. Brown, Bowen, Col
quitt, Evarts, Farwell, George Hearst,
Hi.scock, Beck, Chase, Davis, Jones, Ken
na, Morgan, Quay, Reagan, Riddleberger,
Standford and Voorhees. Senators Ran
som and Vance answered the first roll
call. The members of our House delega
tion who were absent were Messrs. Sim
mons, McClam my and Johnston. At half
after twelve, immediately after the roll
call, Congress adjourned, while a committee
consisting of Senators Morrill and Sauls
bury, and Representatives Turner, Holman
and O'Neil went to the White House to
tell the President they were ready to re
ceive his message. At about half after
one Mr. Pruden, one of the clerks at the
White Hou-e, announced that the message
had ar. ived. The Democrats cheered and
the Republicans hissed when the part re
lating to the tariff and the fisheries was
read. Mrs. Cleveland, Mrs. Folsom and
several friends were in the Executive
Gallery. Mrs. Cleveland looked unusually
pretty in a braided suit of brown cloth
with a derby hat to match. All the gal
leries were crowded to their utmost capac
ity including the diplomatic gallery which
is seldom full. The first legislative day
was occupied entirely in reading the mes
sage which was of unusual length.
THE METHODIST CONFERENCE.
A Pleasant Session in a. Most Pleasant
Eastern City.
Editorial Correspondence.
New Berne, N. C, Dec. 4th. The an
nual session of the Methodist Episcopal
CofVrenee ! b.-iug held in this delightful
city. Ti;' at ndance of piv.iehcrs and
laymen is large. Bishop Gran berry is pre
siding and State Treasurer Donald W.
Bain is Secretary of the Conference,
is well officered.
It !
The Conference is composed of a fine
looking body of men. There are men of
four-score years who have been in the
ministry many years, men in the prime of
life, and young men who are just entering
the ranks. They have all come up to the
! annual gathering from their fields of labor.
Some of them have come up through great
tribulation, privation and toil. B'it they
are a brave body of men. Tin v a: . ade
of the stuff out of which heroe- t. tde
They endure hardship as good . ..i iters.
They live not for earthly honors. They
seek not flowery beds of ease. They are
not looking for luxuries for purple and
fine linen and sumptuous fare. They are
seeking to do good and to serve their Mas
ter. Their pay is small and their labors
great, but they have put on their Sunday
clothes, aud donned their beavers, and
are, iu the main, a prosperous-looking set
of men. Some of them bear the traces of
surTeiings endorsed for the Master's cause,
hut they are not rt-tiners nor growlers. A
preacher who grumbles at his work could
not be better employed than investigating
whether or not he was called to preach.
The average salary of these preachers
is (I quote from memory) a little 'ess than
iffjOO. Oa that amount of money they
support their families, pay their way to
Conference, and move maybe from Hyde
to Burke county every two or three years.
This leaves a very small amount for the
mnvhsse f the necessaries of life- There
is no luxury in such living. The fine
clothes many of them wear are presented
to them; otherwise they would be wearing
cheap clothe.
I honor the man, who.in renpouseto the
call of the Master, leaves all and follows
Him, who goes wherever he is sent to
preach, aud who receives as pay whatever
is given. If that is not dependence upon
God for daily bread I do not know what
is. Faithful ministers of the gospel! The
State and the country cws them a greater
debt than is generally imagined. They do
more to preserve the peace than all the
policemen; to regulate society than all leg
islative enactments; to promote temper
ance than all prohibitory legislation; to
make men's lives pure and turn women's
isoirations to high and noble channels
than ail eVi combined. They are,through
the go-pel they preach, the preservers uoi
only cf peace, but the protection likewise
of the rights of property. They preach
submission to the powers that be, "the
rendering unto Caesar the things that he
Caihsar'j.1' Everywhere and nowhere
more so than in Uorth Carolina is the
faithful minister of the gospel locked up
to and respected, are, often vene-red.
The people appreciate their labors and
their sacrifices.
Whether it be the Methodist circuit
rider, the Baptist missionary, the Presby
terian evangelist, or the Episcopalian cler
gyman, it is to the true, faithful preach
er of the gospel who has done more to
brin cifiliation and education to the re
mote sections th.n all agencies combined.
He goes far ahead of the cchooi tea, her
into the unbroken forest. He carries tbe
Gospel of Light. He gives the people a
desire to know to learn to grow. He
is the forerunner of the school and of the
newspaper. In America the humble pio
neer preacher has been the advance guard
of civilisation and of head, as well as
heart, culture. la this pioneer work iu
the last century the Methodist preacher
has been second to none and that ao.
counts largely for the members and power
of the church. In America the growth
and membership of the several churches
is proportionate to the pioneer preaching
that has been done. The church that
first builds in the wilderness is the church
that holds the people and is the greatest
power. It takes unselfishness to preach
the gospel In home mission fields. It takes
willingness to "suffer aud be strong." I'd
preach in a comfortable church to a city
congregation and receive a good salary, is
all pleasant enough, but to gi out into
the "regions beyond," with no luxuries
and small pay, none but consecrated men
do this sort of work. In this Conference
there are not a few such men. They are
the real "leaders" of the Conference
they are tie kind of men who have built
up the church and who carry forward its
interests and enterprises, and they are the
men who are most entitled to honor.
The business of the body that occupies
most of the time is not of general interest.
In truth it is the reverse, and is very dry
reading. During this session there have
been addresses in behalf of mieiious, thb
Bible Cause, Paine Institute, Education,
and the other objects of the church. These
have not been altogether as interesting as
usual because there have been fewer dis
tinguished ministers from a distance pres
ent than usual. But the preachers all say
they have been profitable.
The preaching has been for edification.
The Bishop, who has a two-story braia
with a mansard roof, has preached twice
once on Thankfigiving day and again on
Sunday. He is a scholar and a thinker,
and his sermons are strong and able.
They are the sermons of a big brained
man, who has as good a heart as he has a
wise head. He is not magnetic, rather
the contrary. He is not eloquent, nor is
he ornate. He has little of the imagina
tion of Marvin or Hawthorne or Hoge.
He is not as popular a preacher as either,
but he preaches sermons of such character
as to impress his hearers for good, and to
give them something to think about, t
like his freedom from attempts at elo
quence and his simplicity, and his sledge
hammer blows.
Tbe trial of Rev. J. B. Bobbitt occupied
almost an entire week. He was charged
with wrong doing in a trade with Mr. L.
J. Potter. The case was tried by tbe fol
lowing committee:
Dr. M. L Wood, chairman; J. J Renn,
J. B. Hurley, T. A. Boone, J. C. Hartsell,
A. P. Tyer, J. C. Rowe, L. E. Stacy, J. R.
Scroggs, J.N. Cole, J. H. Cordon, J. B.
Carpenter, L. L. Johnson and S. V. Hoyle.
Dr. Bobbitt was ably defended by D. B.
Nicholson, Esq., and Rev. L. J. Holden.
The prosecution was conducted by Rev.
T. J. Cutis and Rev. R- C. Beaman. Af
ter a long trial in which much testimony
was introduced, he was acquitted.
There was much discussion about pre
paring an address to be sent out to all the
members of the church. It took wide
rang; In the course of the discussion,
Ref. P. J. Caraway made the following
most sensible remarks, li.j-gaid that he
thought addresses for the purpose of at-tackin-r
Romanism had better be let alone
as it would likely bring about controver-
! sies that would create a aemana ior moie
work th.nnthe Conference is willing to
supply. He thought the proper thing to
do was to preach the gospel and the doc
trines of the church and try to save souls
by the preaching of the word and the love
of the gospel. "God is with us in this
work and if we cannot by preaching the
word and carrying out our discipline save
men, there is not much hope in sending
out addresses."
Raleigh, Greensboro and Winston asked
for the next session of the Conference.' It
was decided to hold it at Greensboro.
One of the best things of the Conference
was the address of Rev. J. F. Crowell,
President of Trinity College. It was an
exhaustive resume of the work of theCol
(p0 its prospects its hopes and its
needs. President Crowell is a wise, indus
trious aud practical man, and will make
Trinity a great success if he has the co
operation of his church. His remarks
were well received, and had weight.
I append the list of appointments an
nounced by the Bishop. It i3 a great
porr oi;e man has to station over 200
preachers. They have to go where he
says go or leave the Conference. Their
destiuies, in a sense, are in his hands.
This great power is unusually w ielded for
the good of all. It is a wonder that more
mistakes are not made when we consider
the magnitude of the task.
