As representatives? of the people in. the

have assembled aV a time when the strength
and excellence jpi our -free institutions
and the fitness of our eKizansj, (o-enjoyi
popular rule have -been again made tnanli

ous consequences;' fraught with feverish
apprehension, and creating aggressiveness
so Intense as to approach bitterness and

When we coiiaider these incidents and
contemplate tlc peaceful : obedience and
manly submission which have succeeded :a
heated clash of. political opinions, we ilfs
cover abundanfreyidenea of a -determination
on the part of rar countrymen to abide by
every verdict Ofl the popular will, and to
be controlled at all times by an abiding
faith In the agencies: -established . for the
direction of the affairs of -their govern-"

disposition, which entitles them to demand
of those who undertake to. make and exe

service in their behalf as can only be pro

In obedience;, to constitutional require
ment, I hereby submit to the congress
certain information concerning national af
fairs, with the. suggestion of such legisla
tion as, in My judgment, Is necessary
and expedient; ; To secure brevity and to
avoid tiresome narration, I shall omit
many details; -concerning matters - within
federal control, which, by no means un
important, are more profitably discussed
In departmental reports.
I shall also-further curtail this communi
cation by onjftting a. minute recital of any
minor Incidents connected with our foreign
relations Which have' heretofore found a
place In executive messages, but are now
contained iir. -a report of the secretary of
state, which is herewith submitted:

At the ojitset oft rrternpe to the more
Important "rnjitters affecting our relations
with foreigh powers. It would afford me
satisfaction. If I could assure the congress
that the Swturbed conditions in ' Asiatic"
Turkey had-jduring the pist year; -assumed
a less hideous and bloody aspect,, and"
that, either as a consequence of the awak
"Baft
of the sr&t nations having the right by
treaty to: ttirerrere fanr-.tii-e. -protection
of those iosed to trie fageuorjnad- bigotry"
and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features
of the situation had been mitigated. In
stead, however, "of welcoming -a--softened
disposition or protective Intervention, we
have been afflicted by continued and not
Infrequent reports-- of j the , wanton, de

While nonejf of our citizens In Turkey

' though - often! In "the midst of dreadM-J

Offered to. Settle the War.
.The Insurrection in' Cuba still continues,
with all its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
been made towards the pacification of the
island, or that the situation of affairs, as
deplcfed'in my tast annual message, has in
the leas,t improved. ' ...
If Spain still holds 'Havana and the sea
ports 'and all the considerable, towns; the
Insurgents still roam at will over at least
two--thirds of the inland country. The de
termination of Spain to put down the in
surrection seems but strengthened with
the lapse ct-'time, as .is ;evincedby her
unhesitating devotion of largely Increased
military and naval forces to the task.
There i-much reason, tp beliete ..that the
Insurgents have gained :in number, char-
'acter and resources', and. are none the less'
Inflexible "In their resolve not -to -succumb
without practically securing the great ob
ject tot which .they took up arms.
If Spain has not yet re-established her
authority, neither have the Insurgents yet
made good their title to be regarded as an
Independent state. Indeed, as the contest
has gone on, the pretense that civil gov
ernment exists on the Island, except so far
as Spain ix bIe to. maintain It, has been
" practically abandoned. Spain "does keep
on foot such a government, more or less
Imperfectly,, in the large towns and their
Immediate suburbs, but, that exception
"being made, the entire country is either
given over to anarchy or is subject to tne
military occupation of one or tha other
party. It Is reported. Indeed, on reliable
authority, that at the demand of the cbm-mander-Jn-chief
of the Insurgent army
the putative Cuban government has now
g-iven up all attempt to exercise Its func-

Our Concern in Cuba.
The spectacle of the utter ruin of an
adjoining country, by nature one of the
'-mosC-fertile--antj charming;'; oft;" the . wftoie-
giobe, would engage the serious' attention
of the government and the people of the
United .States in. any circumstances. In
point of fact, they have"a concern" "With it
which is by no means of a wholly senti
mental or philanthropic character. It lies
so- near to Jjs as Jto be hardly separated
froinour-'tei-ritory. " Uf;'acual pecuniary
interest In it Is second only to that' of the
people of Spain. It is reasonably estimated
that at least from" $30,000,000 to .$50,000,000
of American capital is invWted' irh planta7'
tions and in railroads, mining and other
business enterprises on the island. The
volume of trade between the United States
and Cuba, .which in 1889 amounted to about
$6.000,000; rose in 1893 to about $103,000,000,
and in 1894, the year before the -present
Insurrection broke out, amounted to near
ly $96,000,000.. ;
' Demand for Intervention. .
' These inevitable entanglements of the
"United States with the rebellion In Cuba,
the large American property interests
affected,-! and, , considerations of philan
thropy and humanity in general, have led
to a vehement demand in various quar
ters for some sort of positive intervention
on the 'part' of 'the United States. It was
at first proposed that belligerent rights
should -be accorded the insurgents, a
proposition no longer weighed because its
untimely and impractical operation would
be clearly perilous and injurious . to our
interests. It-has -since been and is now
sometimes . contended that. the. independ
ence' of the nrisurgents should be recog
nized. But, imperfect and restricted as
the Spanish government of the island may
be, sTro tulier exists there," unless the will
of 7 the military' pnjiej) in temporary com
mand of a particular district can be dig
nified as a species of government. It is
j-jiq-y alsojsuggfested that' the United States
snuuiu uuy me umuu a suggesuuu jjuse-
sibiy worthy of consideration if there
were, any evidences of a desire or will
ingness on the part of Spain to enter
tain such a proposal. It is urged, finally,
that, all other methods failing, the exist
ing internecine-stFife?.-in Cuba should be
terminated-by., our intervention,, even at
the cost of a war between the United
States and Spain a war which its advo
cates confidently prophesy could, neither
be Jiu-ge- ta-iW'r&twrtions aor doubifuj
.ln'Its "Issue: ' -'- - ' " "":,
. A Character to Maintain.
' The correctness of -this fprecast need be
neither affirmed ilor denied. ,-The "United
States has, nevertheless, '.a character to
maintain as a. r nation which plainly dic
tates mat rignt ana not migm snouia De
the rule of Its conduct.
f " Further, - though, jthe,JTnited States is
not a nation to which peace is a necessi
ty, -is Is, in truth,, the most pacific of
powers and desires ' nothing so much as
to live in amity with all the world. Its
own ample -arid diversified domain sat
isfies all possible " longings . for terri
tory, precludes all. claims of conquest and
prevents any- casting of -covetous eyes up
on neighboring regions, however attrac
tive. .,- -
That our conduct towards Spain and her
.dp.minlons has constituted:-no exception to
this national dispositioif is made manifest
by the course of our government, not only
thus, far during the present lnsurrection,
ibtit durhig thje"iO years that followed the
rising of Yara 3n 1868. No other great
power, It may safely' be" said, under cir
cumstances of similar perplexity, would
"have manifested the-same, restraint and
J (became patient .endurance. ,
Respect for Spain.
..It may also be said that this persistent
attitude of the United 'States towards
Spain in connection with Cuba unques
tionably evinces ho slight respect and re
jcard for Spain on the part of the Amer
ican people. They, in truth, do not forget
Tier connection with the discovery of the
Western hemisphere, nor -do they under-
estlm'ate" the great qualities, of the Span- '1
lish people, nor fail to fully recognize their
'splendid patriotism- and their chivalrous
devotion' to the national- honor. They
view" with, wonder ,and. admiration the
, cheerful resolution .With.-whieh vast bod
ies of-men- are sent, across thousands of
miles- of ocean, and. an., enormous debt ac
cumulated .that, the costly possession of
the .Gem of the Antilles may still hold its
place.-in the Spanish. crown.' .'
And yet neither the' government nor the
peoplevOf. the . United- States have shut
their eyes to. .the course of events in Cuba
nor , baye . failed to realize' the extent- of
conceded grievances2, trhich- have led to
the present revolt from1 the authority of
Spain, grievances" recognized by the queen
regent ."and by the'eortes, -voiced by the
most! patriotic and -enligh tened of Spanish
statesmen without'-regard - to party, and
demohstrated by reforms proposed by the
executive and -approved by the legislative
branch of the Spanish -government. It is
in the' assumed temper and disposition of
the 'Spanish governmeat tp remedy these
grievances, fortified -io? indications of in
fluential ' public- - opinion . : )n Spain, that
this government has hoped to discover the
most- promising. -and. effective means of
composing -the present : strife with honor
and 'advantage to. Spa.i'a and with "the
achievement of .all.., the. . ostensible ob
jects of. tha. insurrecfion, . :
' -: ' ;. .A-Way iOnt 'of It. .
Kevertfieless, realizing that suspicions on
the part of .the weaker . of the two com
batants are: always.-natural and not 'al
ways unjustifiable, being sincerely desirous
in the interest of both as well as on bur
own account that the. Cuban problem should
be solved with the, 'least possible
delay, - it was intiniated , ' by this
government - to the' government of
Spain ' some months ago that - if a
satisfactory measure of home rule were ten
dered the Cuban insurgents, and would be
accepted by them upoa-a guaranty of its
execution, the United . "States would en
deavor to find a' Way?not ohjectiopable to
Spain of furnishing such guaranty.
While no definite response to this Inti
mation has yet been received from the
Spanish government, . it is believed to be
'not altogether unwelcome, while, as already
suggested, : no jeason is perceived why It
Neither. ,arty can fail to' see the impor
tance of 'early action, and both must realize
that to prolong the present state of : things
for even a short period will add enormously
to the time and labor and expenditure
necessary to bring about the industrial re
cuperation of the island. It is, therefore,
fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest
efforts for healing the breach between Spain
and the Insurgent Cubans , upon, the lines
above indicated may be at once inaugu
rated and poshed to an immediate success
ful issue. The friendly offices of the United
States, either in the manner above outlined
or in any other way consistent with our
constitution and laws, will always be at the
disposal of either party. - ,
Whatever policy may arise, our policy
and our Interest would constrain us to
object to-the acquisition of -the island. or
to any interference with it control by any
other power. ., ; ' ' -,..'.-".';

Lll esa-vina Service.
From the lifesaving service It Is reported
that the number of disasters to docu
mented vessels within the limits of its
operations during the year was 537. These
vessels had on board 4608 persons, of
whom. 4595 were saved and 13 lost. The
value" of sudh vessels . is, estimated at
$8,880,140, and of their cargoes $3,846,380,
making the total value of property im
periled $12,726,520. Of this amount. $11,
292,707 was saved and $1,432,750 was lost.
Sixty-seven of the vessels were totally
wreeked.. There were besides 243 casual
ties ta "small undocumented craft, -on
board0orwhlch there were 594 persons, of
whom 587 were saved and seven lost. The'
value of the property involved In these
latter casualties is estimated at $119,265,
of which $114,955 was saved, and $4350 was
lost. The lifesaving crews during the year
also rescued or assisted numerous other
vessels and warned many from danger by
'"signals- both by day and night. The num
ber of disasters during the year exceeded
that of any. previous year in the history
of the service, but. the saving of both life
and property was greater than ever before
in proportion to the value of the property
involved and to the number of persons
imperiled. "

other branches of public work attached to

is especially invited.
THB WAR DEPARTMENT.
Little Active Work for the
Dnrlns; the Year..-..
Army
. The' report of the secretary of war ex
hibits satisfactory conditions in the several
branches of the public service intrusted to
his charge. The ..Jimit of our military
force, as fixed by law, is constantly and
readily maintained. The present discipline
and morals of om 'army "-are. excellent, and
marked progress" and efficiency are appar
ent throughout its entire organization.
With -the exception of delicate duties in
the -suppression of . slight Indian disturb
ances along our southwestern boundary,
in. which the Mexican troops co-operated,
and the compulsory but peaceful return,
with the oonsent of Great Britain, of a
band of Cree Indians from . Montana to
the British possessions, no-active opera
tions have been required of the army dur
ing the -year past. ' '
. Changes in the method of administration,
the abandonment of unnecessary posts, and
the ' consequent -' concentration of troops,
and the exercise of care and vigilance by
the various officers charged with the re
sponsibility., in the expenditures of the ap
propriations, have resulted in reducing to
a minimum the cost of maintenance of
our military establishment. '
During 'the past year the work of con-"
structing permanent infantry and cavalry
posts'-has been continued at places here
tofore designated. -The secretary of war
repeats his recommendation that appropria
tions for barracks and quarters should
more strictly conform to the need of the
service, as judged by the department,,
rather than respond to the wishes and im
portunities of localities. It is imperative
that much' of the money provided for such
construction should now be allotted to the
erection of necessary quarters for the gar
risons assigned to the coast defenses, where
many men will be needed to properly care
for and operate modern guns. . It. lc es-

was $1,679.956 "19 'less- than that of the pre

The chief expenditures of the postal ser
vice are regulated by law and are not in
the control of the postmaster-general.' All
that he can accomplish by the most watch-,
ful administration and economy is to en
force .prompt and thorough collection; and
accountings, for public moneys and such
minor savings in .small expenditures and . in

masters and -compelling such postmasters
to make more frequent deposits of postal

les3 than that' of the last "and preceding

second-class rates, to -which ujd'eficit -is
mainly attributable. The transmission at
the rate .of 1. cent a. pound-. of serial li
braries, advertising sheets, "house or

ticular "house" or institution), sample
copies and the like, ought ' certainly to
be discontinued. A glance at the revenues

show more plainly than any -other state
ment the gross abuse of the postal ser
vice, and the. growing waste of its .earn
ings. The' free matter .cajcried rinthe;
mails for the department, offices, ' 'etc..
of the government,- and for congress. In
pounds, amounted ;to 94,480,189. If this
is offset against" buildings for postofflces
and stations, the rental of which would
more than compensate for such free postal
service, we have this , exhibit:

The' remainder of our postal revenue,
amounting to something over $5,000,000,
was .derived from box rents, registry fees,
money-order business and other similar
Items. The entire expenditures of the de-t
partment, including pay for transporta
tion credited to the Pacific railroads, was
$92,186,19611, 'which may be considered as
the cost of receiving, carrying and deliver
ing the above" -mail matter. - It thus
appears that though the second-class mat
ter constituted more than-": two-thirds of
the -total that' was carried, the revenue
derived, from it was less than one-thirtieth
of total ' expenses. The average, revenue
from each pound of first-class matter .was
93 cents, from each pound of second-class
matter 8H mills (of . the second class 52,
348,297 pounds was free matter); from each
pound of third class, 13.1 cents; from each
pound of fourth class, 15.6 cents. .
- The . growth of weight . in second-class
matter has been from 299,000,000 pounds in
1894 to 312,000,000 in 1895, and to almost
349,000,000 in 1896, and it is quite evident
this increasing - drawback 'is far outstrip
ping any possible growth of. postal revenues.-

Our mail service should, of course, be
"such as to meet the wants and even the
conveniences of our. people,; with a direct
charge upon them so light as to exclude
the idea of our postofflce' department -being
a money-making concern; but in the
face o( the constantly recurring deficiency
in its revenues. . and to .view of the fact
that we supply the best mail service; In
the world, it seems to me it is' quite time .
to correct the abuses that swell enormous
ly our annual deficit. If we-concede the
public policy of carrying papers free in
the county of publication, and even the
policy of carrying at less than one-tenth
their cost other bona fide newspapers and
periodicals,' there can be no excuse for
subjecting the service to the further ' im
mense and Increasing loss involved in car
rying at the nominal rate -of ,1 cent a

cluding trashy and even harmful litera
ture, arid other 'matter, which, under the
loose interpretation of a loose statute, has
been gradually given second-class rates,
thus absorbing . all profitable -returns de
rived from first-class matter, which pays
three or four times more than its cost, and
producing a large -annual loss to be paid
by general taxation.. If such- second-class
matter merely- paid the coat-of Its handling,
our - deficit would Usappear and a -surplus

the people still better man facilities or a
cheaper rate of letter postage. .,
, - INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. 7f S
Spent -a Hach Money, as It jed to
Take to Ran the Government,
The report of the secretary of the Interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting
exhibit of the numerous and . important
affairs committed to his supervision. It is
Impossible in this - communication - to do
more than briefly refer . to a few of the
subjects concerning which the secretary
gives lull and instructive information.
The money appropriated on account of
this department for its disbursement for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, amount
ed to mere- than $157,006,000, or a greater
sum than was appropriated for the .entire
maintenance of the. government for the
twi' fiscal years ended June 30, 1861.
"fr-; Public la-Ads.
Our public lands, originally amounting to
1,840,000.000 acres, have been - so reduced
that only 600,000,000 still remain in govern
ment control, excluding Alaska. The bal
ance, being by far the most valuable por
tion, has been given away to settlers, to
new suites and to railroads, or sold at a
comparatively nominal sum,
. The patenting' of tend, ti execution, of
railroad grants has. progressed ..rapidly
during the year, and since the '4th day of
March, 1893, about 25,000.000 acres have
thus been conveyed to these corporations.
I agree with the secretary that the . re
mainder of our public lands should be. more
carefully dealt with, "and their - alienation
guarded against by, better economy, and
greater prudence. . ' '"

-i Vj 'J Indian Affairs.
The' total Indian population of the. United
States Is 177,235, according to a census: -'blade-,
in 1895, exclusive of those within the sta.te
of New York-and those comprising, the five
civilized tribes. Of- this number,'.'' there'
are .approximately 38,000'. Children of school
age. During the year, 23,33&.Of these .were.
Arallpri tn nrhnnls -. Th o Miricrrpoa whlrh
"lias 'attended recent efforts to. extend In
dian, school facilities and' the anticipation
of continued liberal appropriations Jo that
end cannot fail to afford. the utmost. satis
faction to those .who. believe that the edu
cation of Indian "children is'a 'prime factor
in the,- accomplishment of IndiaH..-clviliza-
tion. .. ..... ..
It may be said in general terms "thai" in1
every -particular the improvement of : the:
Indiana under government -has been most.
marked and encouraging. The secretary,
the commissioner of. Indian, affairs, and the
agents having charge of Indians to whom
allotments have been made, strongly urge
the passage of a law- prohibiting the sale
of liquor to allottees" who . have taken
their lands in severalty. ---1 earnestly Join
in this recommendation,' and venture to ex
press the hope "that the , Indian .may be
speedily protected against this one greatest
of all evils to. his well-being and advance
ment. . '' -..--. -The.
condition of affairs among the five
civilized tribes, who occupy large tracts
of land in the Indian territory and who
have governments- of - their own, has as
sumed such an aspect as to render it al
most indispensable that there should be
an entire change In the relations of these
Indians to the general government This
seems to be necessary In furtherance of
their own Interests, as well as for the
protection of non-Indian residents in their
territory. A commission organized and
empowered under several recent laws Is
now negotiating with? these Indians for
the relinquishment of 'their courts and the.
division of their common lands in sever
alty, and are aiding in the settlement of
the troublesome question of tribal mem
bership. The reception of their first prof
fers of negotiation, was not encouraging
but through, patience and. such conduct on
their part -as demonstrated' that their in
tentions were friendly and in the interest
of the tribes, -the prospect of. success has
become more promising. - The effort
should be to save these Indians from the
consequences of their own mistakes and
Improvidence and to secure to the real
Indian his rights as against intruders
and professed friends who profit by his
retrogression. A change is also needed to
protect life and property through the op
eration 'of courts conducted according' to
strict justice and strong enough to en
force their mandates. . . ,
... As a sincere friend of the Indian I am
exceedingly -anxious that these reforms
should be accomplished with the consent
and aid of the tribes, and that no neces
sity may be presented for radical "or
drastic . legislation.. -1 . hope, " therefore,
that thiS commission- now conducting ne
gotiations will soon be able to report that

it : Pacific Railroads. -
f he secretary "calls attention to the pub
lieS interest's involved in -an adjustment
of .'the obligations of the Pacific railroads
toithe government 1 deem It to be an im
portant duty to especially present this, sub
ject to the consideration of the congress.
. On January 1, 1897, wtth the amount al
ready matured, more than $13,000,000 of the
principal of thfi subsidy bonds issued by
the United States in aid of the construc
tion of the Union Pacific railway, includ
ing its Kansas line, and more than $6,000,
000 of like honds issued in aid of the Cen
tral Pacific railway, including those Issued
to. the Western Pacific!- Railway Company,
will have fallen due and been paid or must
on that day.be paid by the government.
Without any reference to the application of
the sinking fund now in the treasury, this
will create men a default on the part of
these companies to the government as will
give it the right to af once institute pro
ceedings to foreclose its mortgage lien. In
addition ' to this indebtedness that will
be due January 1, 1897,--4hei-e will mature
between that-date and' January 1, 1899, the
Remaining principal of such subsidy bonds,
which must also be met by the govern
ment ' These amount . to more than $20,-000,000-
- on account of. the Union Pacific
lines, and exceed $21,000,000 on account of
the Central Pacific 'lines.
- The situation of these roads and the
condition of their Indebtedness to the gov
ernment have been fully set forth in the
reports of various committees to the pres
ent and prior congresses, and as early as
1887 they were thoroughly examined by a
special commission appointed pursuant to
an act of congress. The considerations' re
quiring an adjustment of the government's
relations to the companies have been clear
ly presented, and the conclusion reached
with practical uniformity that If thess
relations are not terminated they should
be revised upon a basis securing their safe
continuance. -.
Under a section of the act of congress
passed March 3, 1887, the president is
charged with the duty, In the event that
any mortgage or other incumbrance, para
mount to the interest of the United States
in the - property of the Pacific railroads
shall, exist and be lawfully liable to be
enforced, to direct aetion of the depart
ments of the treasury and of justice in
the protection of the Interest of the United
States by thorough judicial proceedings,
including foreclosure, of the government
liens. In view of the fact that the con
gress has for a number of "years almost
constantly had under consideration plans
for dealing with the conditions existing be
tween these roads and the government,- I
have thus far felt justified in withholding
action under the statute above mentioned.
The Union Pacific Came.
In the case of the. Union Pacific, how
ever, the - situation has become especially
and Immediately urgent Proceedings have
been instituted foreclose a first mort
gage upon those aided parts of the main
line upon which the government holds a
second and subordinate mortgage lien. In
consequence of these proceedings and in
creasing complications, added to the default
occurring on the 1st day of January, 1897,
a condition will be presented on that date,
so far as this company is concerned, that
must emphasize the mandate of the act
of 18S7 and give to executive duty under
its -provisions a more imperative aspect
Therefore, unless congress shall otherwise
direct, or shall have previously determined
upon a different solution of the problem,
there will hardly appear to exist any rea
son for delaying, beyond the date of the
default above mentioned, such executive
action as will promise to, subserve the pub
lic interests and save. tb,e government from
the loss threatened by further Inaction.
THB TARIFF.
The President's Defense-of the Wilson
' Bill.
, '- ---'-: -; - ' -i"-. - " '..--. ;
I- desire ta refer to the; liataman.t else
where, made concerning the government re
ceipts and expenditures for the purpose of
venturing upon some suggestions touching
our present tariff law and its oseration.
This statute took effect on the 3th day
of August 1894. " Whatever may be Its
shortcomings as a complete measure of
tariff reform, it must be conceded that it
has opened the way to a freer and greater
exchange . of commodities between "the
XTrdted.-. States- and- other countries, and
thus furnished a wider market for our prod--I
ucts ana manufacturing. The -only entire
fiscal year during which this law has been
in force ended on the 30th day of June, 1896.
In that' ytar our Imports increased over
those of the previous -year - more than
$6,600,000, "while the value of the domestic
product w exported and which found mar
kets abroad was nearly $70,000,000 more than
during the preceding year.
Those who insist that the coat to our
people of articles coming to them from
ab-jctad for their needful use, should only
be increased through tariff charges to
an extent necessary to meet the expenses
of the government as well as those who
claim- that tariff charges .may be
laid upon such : articles beyond
beyond the necessities of the' government
revenue and with the additional purpose
of so increasing their price in our markets
as to give American manufacturers and
producers better and more profitable oppor
tunities, must agree that our tariff-' laws
are only primarily -justified as sources, of
revenue' to enable the government to meet
-the neeessary expenses of its maintenance.
Considered as to : its 'sufficiency in this
aspect, the present la w . canr by no means
fall under Just" cori'demnatibriiDurlng-the
only complete (fiscal year, of its operation,
it has yielded nearly ..$8, 000,000 more revenue
than- Was. received from tariff' 'dotleoVto the:
pre.ee ding. year. 'nThere was,, nevertheless.- a'
deficit Between, .our receipts arid ' expendi
tures --of a? -little more than '$25,000,600. v ,.'
The situation was .sufch in. December,
seven months before the close of "the fiscal :
year,' that the1' 'secretary" of -the treasury-
fore'tota-a- deficiency of $17,O0OJ!9O. ...The
-great and increasing" apprehension : and'
timidity., Jn business circles iand::the'.-de-pression
in all activities. Intervening since
that :thne;-resulting from causes perfectly
. well -understood arid entirely- disconnected,
with our tariff law or . its operation,, .seri
ously checked the imports we would nave
"Otherwise received and readily account-for
' the. difference between the estimate of the
secretary and the actual deficiency as well
as for a continued deficit. -JEndeed it: must .
be confessed that we could hardly have had
a. more., unfavorable period than the' last
.two years for' the- collection of - a. tariff
revenue. ' ... . ' 1:
- We cannot reasonably hope that our re
cuperation from this business depression
will be sudden, but it has already set in
with a promise of acceleration arid con.
tinuance. . ' . ,;. : .
Use of the Snrplns..
. I believe our present tariff law,- if allow
ed a fair opportunity, will in the .near
future yield a revenue- which, with reason
ably economical expenditures, will over-C
eome all deficiencies. In the meantime, bo
deficit that -has occurred, or may occur,
need excite or disturb, us. TO meet any
such deficiency; we have in the treasury, in
addition to -a gold reserve of $100,000,000, a
surplus of more than $128,000,000 applicable
to ' the .payment of -the 'expenses . of the
government and which must, unless ex
pended for that purpose, remain In ...use
less hoard, or, if not extravagantly wasted,
must, in any event, be . perverted from
the purpose of Its exaction from our people.
The payment therefore, , of any deficiency
in the revenue from this fund is nothing
more than its proper and legitimate use.
The government,' thus ' applying a surplus
fortunately in Its treasury to the payment
of expenses not metty its current reve
nues. Is not at all to be likened' to a man
living vond his income, and- thus incur
ring de! or encroaching on his principal.
It is not one of the functions of our gov--ernment
to accumulate and make addi
tions to a fund not needed tor immediate
expenditure. With individuals, it. is the
chief, object -of struggle and effort The
(-application of an accumulated fund by the
government to the payment or its running
expenses is a duty. An Individual lishg
heyond his income- and embarrassing him
self with debt or drawing upon his ac
cumulated fund of principal is either un
fortunate or improvident The- distinction
Is as between a government charged with
the duty of expending for the benefit of the
people' and for proper purposes .all the
money it receives- from any source and
the individual who Is expected to mani
fest - a natural desire to ivoid debt or
to accumulate as much as possible and
to live within the income derived from
such accumulations, to the end that they
may be increased, or at least remain un
impaired, for the future use and enjoyment
affection who riiay survive him.
It is Immeasurably better to appropriate
our surplus to the payment of Justifiable
expenses than to allow It to become an
invitation to reckless appropriations and ex
travagant expenditures. -'
- I suppose It will not be denied that under
the present law our people obtain the neces
saries of a comfortable existence at a
cheaper rate than formerly. This is a
matter of supreme importance, since it Is
the palpable duty of every Just govern
ment to- make the burdens of taxation as
light as possible. The people -should not
be required to relinquish this privilege
of cheap living, except under the stress
of their government's necessity made plain,
ly manifest - . ':
FINANCIAL MATTERS.
The Weakness and Vice of Our Prea-
.-"'"-;..' " ent Methods. -
' This reference to the condition and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests
an allusion to the weakness and vices of
our financial methods. They . have been
frequently pressed upon the attention of
congress in previous executive communica
tions, and the inevitable danger of their
continued toleration pointed out Without
now reDeatinsr these details. I -cane-"- re
frain from again earnestly presenting th
necessity of the prompt reform of a sys-
tem opposed to every rule of sound finance,
and shown hv e-rrw-rienoe toe fraueht with
and shown by experience toe fraught with
the gravest peril and perplexity.
The terrible war which shook the founda
tions of cur government more than 30 years
ago brought in its train the destruction of
property, the wasting of our country's
substance and the estrangement of breth
ren. These are' now past and forgotten.
Even the distressing loss of life the con
flict entailed is but a sacred memory which
fosters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive
a tender regard for those who nobly died.
And yet there remains with us today
in full strength, as an Incident of that
tremendous struggle, a feature of Its finan
cial necessities not only unsulted to our
present circumstances, but manifestly a
disturbing menace to business security and
an ever-present agent of monetary distress.
Because we may be enjoying a temporary
relief from Its depressing influence should
not lull us Into a false security nor lead
us to forget the suddenness of past visita
tions. ,
DEPARTMENT OF AGRJCt'LTXRE.
.. Export! of Firm Products.
.The secretary reports that the 'value of
our exports of farm products during the
last fiscal year amounted to $570,000,000,
an increase of $17,000,000 over those of the
year immediately preceding. This state
ment is none the less welcome because
of the fact that notwithstanding such .in
crease the proportion of exported agricul
tural products to our total exports of all
descriptions fell off during the year. The
benefits of an Increase in agricultural
exports being assured, the decrease In the
proportion to our total exports is the more
gratifying, when we . consider that It Is
owing to the fact that such total exports
for the year Increased more than $75,000,-
000. - :.
The large and increasing exportation of
our agricultural products suggests the
giAt J usefulness of the organization
lately established In the department for
the purpose of giving to those engaged In
farming pursuits reliable Information con
cerning the condition and needs arid "ad
vantages of - different foreign markets.
Inasmuch as the success of the farmer
depends upon the advantageous sale of
his products and inasmuch as ' foreign
markets must largely be the destination
of . such -products, it is quite apparent
that a knowledge of the conditions and
wants that affect those markets ought to
result In sowing more Intelligently and
reaping with a better prba nroflt.
Concluding- Remarks.
In concluding this communication,- Its"
last words shall fee. an appeal to the con- J
gress for the most rigid -economy in the 1
expenditure of the money it holds in trust ' :proposea match between Corbett and
for the people. The war Jo -perplexing;.?,.. , MMa
extravagances Is easy, but a return to
frugality is difficult. When, however, it
is considered that those who can bear
the burdens of taxation have no guaranty
of honest care, save in the fidelity of their
public servants, the. duty of all possible
retrenchment Is plainly manifest When
our differences are forgotten and our -con'
tests of political opinion are no longer re-membered,--netlfiiig.
In ' the' retrospect , of
our public service will be -as fortunate
and comforting as "the recollection- of of
ficial duty well performed, and the mem-"
ory of a constant devotion to the Interests
of our confiding fellow countrymen. -GROVER
