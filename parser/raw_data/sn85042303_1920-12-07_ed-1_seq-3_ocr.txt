SAGK TO TUB 66TH CONGRESS
(Continued From Page One)
,L.on(l of the war came when the Oer-
iiiuu peopiu iouiiu inemseivea race 10
face with the conscience of the world
ana realized that right was everywhere
arrayed against thu wrong that, their
Kovernment waa perpetrating. Thou,
therefore, it is right to nay this wan
thu faith which won the war. Cer
tainly this la the faith with which our
Kullaiit men went into tho firld ami
out upon the seas to mako buro of
victory...
This !h Uie mission upon which de
mocracy catno into the world.
Democracy is an assertion of thu
riKlit of tho Individual to live and
to be treated Justly as against any
attempt on tho part of any combina
tion of 'Individuals to make laws which
will overburden him or which will
destroy' his equality among; his fel
lows in the matter of right or privi
lege, and I think that we all realize
that the day has come when democ
racy is being put upon its final test.
The old world is Just now suffer
ing from a wanton rejection of tho
principle of democracy and a substitu
tion of tho principle of autocracy ns
asserted in the name, hut without
the authority and sanction of the
multitude. This in the time of all
others, when democracy should prove
its purity and its splrltunl power to
prevail. . It Is surely the manifest
destiny of the United Slates to lead
In the attempt to make this spirit
prevail. .
There nre two ways in which the
l ulled States can assist to accorn-
pIlHh this (treat object.
First, by offering the example with
in her own borders of the will and
power of democracy to make and en
force luws which nre unquestionably
Just and which nre equal In their ad
ministration laws which secure its
full right to labor and yet, at the
H.'nne time, safeguard tho. integrity
i'f pmperty and piirticulnrly of that
property which is devoted to the do
wliipinent nf Industry and the ln
'creaso of the necessary wealth of the
world.
Second, by standing for right and
Justice ns towards individual nations.
The law of democracy Is for the pro
tection of the weak, and In the Influ
ence of every democracy In tho world
should be for the protection of the
weak nations, the nation which Is
struegling towards its rights and to
ward its proper recognition and privi
lege in the family of natlonB.
The United Stntes cannot refus
this role of champion without putting
the stlgmn of rejection upon the great
and devoted men who brought Its
government into existence and estab
lished it In the face of almost uni
versal opposition and Intrigue, even
In the face of wanton force, as, for
example, agnlnst the orders in coun
cil of Great Britain and the arbi
trary Napoleonic elements which In
volved us In what we knew as the war
of 1812. I urge you to consider that
the display of an Immediate disposi
tion on the part of congress to remedy
any injustices or evils that may have
shown themselves In our own national
life Will nfford the most effectual
nffsct to the forces of chaos and ty
ranny which nre playing so disastrous
u part In the fortunes of the free
peoples of more than one part of th
world.
The United Slates Is of necessity the
sample democracy of the world, and
the triumph of democracy depends
H'ipon Its success.

senuently modified ihe bill in order
to meet this objection. In the revised

tres to revise Its rules end proced

effective national budget system, t
earnestly hope, trust, thnt one of the
first Steps taken by the present ses
sion Of tho congres will he to pass
the budget bill.
The nation's finances have shown
marked Improvement during the pnst
ear. The total ordinary receipts of
tn.CHOnO.OAO, for the fiscal yonr 1920
exceeded those for 1919 by I1.S42,
nan while the total net ordtnnry ex
penses from IU.514.000.000 to $M3.

to 114.175.000.000.
There also tins been a marked de

tutions of the country ns well at In

Tills fortunate result hns relieved
the banks and left them freer to fi
nance Ihe needs of Bgrlculture. In-
lustry and commerce. It has been
due In large part to the reduction
of the public debt, especially of ths
flnnilnir debt, but more particularly
o the Improved distribution of gov
ernment securities among permanent
Investors. The cessation of th. fov
ernments borrowing except through
lOiort term certificates of Indebtedness

has been a matter of grout conse
quence to the people of the country
at largo as well or the holders of lib
erty bonds and victory notes, and
has had an important bearing on tho
matter of effective credit control. The
year has been characterized by the
progressive withdrawal of the treas
ury from the domestic 'credit market
and from a position of dominant in
flucuco in tliut market. Tho future
course will necessarily depend upon
thu extent to which economies are
profiled una upon the burdens placed
upou tho treasury, im well as upon
Industrial developments aud tho main
tenance of taJt receipts at u suffi
ciently hljfh level.
The fundamental fact which at
present dominates tho government's fi
nancial situation is that seven and
a half billions of its war indebted
ness mature within tho next two ftnd
a hulf years. Of this amount, two
and a half billions are floating debt
and five billions victory notes and
war savings certificates. The fiscal
program of the government must
bo determined with reference to these
maturities. Sound policy demands that
Uie government expenditures be re
duced to the lowest amount which will
permit the various service to operate
efficiently and that government ro
celpts from taxes and salvage be
maintained sufficiently high td pro
vide for current requirements, includ
ing interest and sinking fund charge
on the publics debt and at the samo
time retire the floating debt and part
With rigid, vigorous salvage operations
and adequate revenues from taxation
a surplus of current receipts over
current expenditures can. be released
and should bo applied to the floating
debt. All branches of the government
should co-operate to see that this
program is realized. I cannot over
emphasize the necessity of economy
In government expenditures and prac
tices which take money from the
treasury by Indefinite or revolving
fund appropriations. The estimates
for the presont year show that over
a billion dollars of expenditures were
authorized by the last congress in ac
cordance with the amounts showed in
annual compiled statements of appropriations.
This strikingly illustrates the im
portance of making direct and spe
cific appropriations. The relations be
tween the current receipts and current
expenditures of the government during
the present fiscal year us well us dur
ing the last hiiJJ of the last fiscal
year has been distributed by the ex
traordinary burdens thrown upon the
treasury act, In accordance with the
return of the railroads to private
control. Over $600,000,000 has already
been paid upon the railroads and this
act $350,000,000 during the present
fiscal year; and it is estimated that
further payments aggregating approx
imately $050,000,000 must still be mode
to the railroads during the current
year. It is obvious that these large
payments have already seriously lim
ited the government's progress in re
tiring the floating debt.
Closely connected with this, it seems
to me, is the necessity 'for an imme'
diato consideration of the revision of
our tax table.
Simplification of the income and
profits taxes has become an immedi
ate necessity. These taxes performed
an Indispensable service during the
war. The need for their simplifica
tion, however, is vpry great, in order
to save the tax payer inconvenience
anil expense and in order to mako
his liability more certain and definite.
Other and nioro detailed recommenda
tions with regard to taxes will no
doubt he laid before you by the secre-
i liirv of f)ie treiiMiirv find the eommiM-
sioner of internnl revenue.
It Is my privilege to draw to the
nttention of congress for every sym
pathy considcralon tho problem of
providing adequate facilities for the
' care nnd treatment of former members
I of tlio military and naval forces which
I are sick or disabled as a rusult of
j their participation in the war.
I These heroic men can never be paid
t In money for the service they pa
triotically rendered tile nation. .Their
i reward will lie rather In realization
! of the fact that they vindicated the
. rights of their country and aided in
safeguarding civilization. Tho nations
! gratitude must be effectively revealed
to them by the most ample provision
, fur their medical care and treatment
as well lis for their vocational train-
Ing iiinl placement. The time hay
come when a more complete program
; can be formulated anil more satisfac
i torily administered for their treatment
' and training, and I earnestly urge
, that Ihe congress give, the matter its
I early consideration.
The secretary of the treasury and
! the board for vocational education will
i outline in their annual reports pro
I posals covering medical cure and re-
habllitatlon, which I tun sure will en
I gas' your earnest study nnd com
! m uni your most generous support.
1 Permit me to emphusir.e once more
the need for uctlon upon certain mat
ters upon which I dwelt at some
length In my message to tho second
session of the sixty-sixth congress.
i The necessity for example, of encour
t using the manufacture of dyc-tuffs
i and related chemicals; tho Importance
of doln-; everything possible to pro
mote agricultural production along
economic lines, to Improve agricultur
al marketing and to make rural life
more attractive and healthful; the
ned for a law regulating cold stor
age in such a way as to limit the
time durlug which goods may be
kept In storage, prescribing the meth
od of disposing of them if kept be
yond the M-rmltted period and requir
ing good released from storage In
nil cases lo bear the date of their
receipt.
They .will ulso be more serviceable
If it wag provided that all goods re
leased from cold storage from inter
state shipment should have plainly
marked upon each package tho sell
ing or' market price at whleh they
went Into storage, In order that tho
purchaser might be utile, to learn what
profits stiSKl between him nnd the
producer or the wholesale dealer. In
deed It would bo very serviceable to
tha public If the goods destined for
Interstate commerco were made to
carry upon every pnekngo case whose
form made It possible a plain state
ment of what left the hands of the
producer, I respectfully call your at
tention also to tho recommendations
of the message referred to with re
Hard to n federal license for nil those
engaged In interstate commerce.
In brief, tho Immediate reed Is the
removal of all obstacles to tho reali
sation of the best ambitions of our
peopls In their severs I classes of em

instrumentalities by which difficulties
are to be met and removed nnd justice
dealt out, whether by law or by some
form of meditation and conciliation. 1
do not feel It to be my privilege nt
present to suggest the detailed and
particular methods by which these
objects may be attained, but I have
faith that the Inquiries of several
committees will discover the way and
the method.
In response to what I believe to be
the impulse of sympathy and opinion
throughout tho United States, I earn
estly suggest that the congress au
thorize the treasury of the United
States to mako to the struggling gov
ernment of Armenia such a loan as
was made to several of the other al
lied governments during the war; and
I would also suggest that it would
be desirable to provide in the legisla
tion itself that tho expenditure of the
money thus loaned bo under the sup
ervision of a commission or at least
a commissioner from the United States
in order that the revolutionary ten
dencies within Armenia itself might
not be afforded by the loan a further
tempting opportunity.
Allow me to call your attention to
the fact that the people of tho Phil
ippine Islands have succeeded in main
taining a stable government since the
last action of tho congress in their
behalf and have thus fulfilled the con
dition set by the congress as prece
dent to a consideration of granting
independence to the islands. I re
spectfully submit this condition pre
cedent having been fulfilled, it is now
our liberty and our duty to keep
our promise to the people of those
islands by granting them the inde
pendence which they so honorably
covet.
I have not so much laid before you
a wries of recommendations, gentle
men, as sought to utter a confession
of faith, of tho faith in which I was
bred and which it is my solemn pur
pose to stand by till my last fight
ing day. I believe this to bo the
faith of America, the faith of the
future, nnd of the victories which
await national execution in the days
to come whether in America or elsewhere.

Washington, Dec. 7. Drunkenness
continued to be the principal cause
for enlisted men of the navy for de
sertion or overstaying leave during
the past fiscal year, according to the
unnual report of Hear Admiral George
R. Clark, judge advocate general, to
Secretary Daniels today. Of 1,723
such excuses during the year, pleas
of drunkenness were entered in 384
cuses, says the report. The excuse
of "having a good time" was given in
3C2 cases. Home sickness caused 90
sailors to take "French leave," and
in eight cases the plea was entered
that the work on board ship was too
hard.
More than 41,000 cases were tried
by court martial during tho year.
The tempering of Justice with mercy
was urged by Admiral Clark.
