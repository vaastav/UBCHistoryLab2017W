COMPARATI VE STATEMENT.
The Clerks of the House and Senate
Make a Report.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The clerks of the
co5 mittee on appropriation, of the senate
and house have prepared comparative]
statements of the estimates appropria
tions of expenditures for the maintenance
ol the government for the fiscal year 1889
and 1890 from which it appears that the
increase of estimates for 1891 for these for
tbe current year is $90,867,168 and that
the increase of the estimates for next year
over Appropriations for this year of $4,
838,092,112. The total estimates of the
regulur and permanent annual appropria
tions for the next fiscal y«ar are $406,
643 315, while the total revenues a re estim
ated at $450,614,337, showing an excess
ol the estimates ol revenues over the
estimated appropriations next year of
$43,571,022. The net surplus for the
prisent year is placed at $53,532,511 or
$9,561,489 more than the estimated sur
plus for the next fiscal year. This
prospective decrease in the surplus
ie stated, too, without referèoee
to the possibility of an enactment of
the river and harbor bill, for in the esti
mates submitted by the secretary of the
treasury, there is a notable omission of
the ordinary provisions for the river and
harbor improvements. For the preserva
tion of the existing works, the sum of $237,
700 is asked, while the report of the chief
engineers sayu $31 ,533.550 can be profit
ably expended next year in these improve
ments. The statement above quoted dif
fers materially from that proposed by the
treasury department, and exhibited in the
book of esi imatee just issued for the rea
son that the postal receipts and revenues
are differently treated by the treasury and
the appropriation committees. Ass'stant

partaient has given the secretary of interior
an opinion as to the effect of the seven
teenth section ot the act admitting the
new states, which rtquiree the act of 1841,
the original pre-emption act and
the repeals the same as to the new states.
He ho de that taking the whole section to
gether the intent was not to repeal the
t
pre-i mptiou laws but to make the grant of
lands in lieu of 'he eighth .ection of the I
act of 1841, generally known as the inter
nal improvement grant, and to repeal that I
section as to the new states, that the act
ol 1841 was carried into the revised I
statutes and repeuled in 1865. That if I
congrees had intended to repeal the P re_ I
emption laws it could have done so by re- j
pealing the sections of the revi-ed statutes I
appertaining thereto, or by applying the
words so declaring and not by the repeal of I
the old act of 1841, and that the pre-emp
tion law so contained in the revised statu-1
tee, except sus to the internal improvement | w
grants are still in force in the new states.

A SHOCKING TRAGEDY.
A Professor Shot bj a Man From the
Audience.
Boston, Dec. 4.—A peculiar tragedy oc
curred in Lynn early last evening. Prof.
H. F. Sartelle, claiming a residence in Wor

cester, has for several days been giving ex
hibitions of the dime museum order in a
small wooden structure located at Wash
ington and Oxford streets.
Through foolhardiness or a deliberate
att, mpt at suicide he last evening lost his
life. The professor was exhibiting before a
small sized audience and produced for in
spection a rifle and bullet. He then loaded
tbe weapon and requested some one in the
andience to "kill" him. He made the re*
quest several times. Finally William H.
Flanagan steppe 1 forward and secured the
rifle and walked to a further corner of the
room.
Sartelle instructed him to fire when he
bad counted three. He then stepped upon
tho stage, and, facing Flanagan, counted
"one," and then said, "Aim higher; aim
D ». u , aim awunr, mm

then resumed counting. Simultaneous
with the signal of "three" Flanagan fired.
Immediately Sartelle fell prostrate. He
was killed instantly. Tbe bullet,
44-caliber slug, entered the victim's neck
just at the left ot the jugular vein. Flan
agan was arrested, but he will doubtless
be released. Many in the audience sup
posed that Jtbe falling was a part of the
trick, and left the ball without a suspicion
of tbe tragedy that bad been acted.
