The indications are that no one Is more
Clad than the Filipinos that the war Is
over.
They begin early In Mississippi, where a
five-year-old has Just shot and killed his
brother because the latter offended him.
The Republicans In Congress have the
power to put the money of the country on
a sound basis. They should exercise that
power without hesitation.
Mr. Bryan will criticise the President's
message, and so would Agulnaldo if he
were where it could reach him. The third
member of "the glorious "trinity" is dead.
The Massachusetts anti-lmpertallst who
said that he would rather be Agulnaldo
than McKInley can be assured that Aguln
aldo would probably like to change places
with him,
The Milwaukee Sentinel says that the
Senate should devise some plan to cut off
the talk in that body which is not debate.
Buch a rule would keep several senators
In perpetual silence.
President McKInley in his message twice
quoted hla Republican predecessor Harri
son as precedent and authority. Had Mr.
Bryan been made President would ho have
quoted Mr. Cleveland?
f
Word comes from Nebraska that Mr.
Jlltchcock. of the Omaha World-Herald, will
to appointed by the Populist Governor to
succeea air. itayward, who died yesterday.
Any one is preferable to the ever-crating
Allen.
The Democrats of the Bryan brand will
not like the President's message, but In the
days of George Washington there were
those who denounced his message because
they believed him to be In favor of
monarchy.
The fact that an Indlan&n secured a
well-defined "scoop on the rest of the
congressmen in the Introduction of a
financial measure detracts nothing from
the honor of the Hoosler State at the na
tional capital.
The attention of newspaper readers who
want to know about war Is now directed
mainly toward South Africa, but the look
ing doesn't do them much good. The long
distance telephone lines to the various bat.
tleflelds are not In good working order.
There could be no more auspicious season
for a President's message a prosperous
country, a dying Insurrection In Luzon and
a decree of the Supreme Court affirming the
wisdom of Republican legislation ten years
ago and the broader functions of the fed
eral government
Agulnaldo's mother says he is not suffi
ciently civilized to keep from being misled
by bad counsel from his native advisers.
Messrs. Atkinson, WInslow et al. will not
fcsrree with this tstlmate of the Filipino fig
urehead. What does his mother know
about him, anyway?
An exchange, which has been making in-
culries. finds that prominent Republicans
In nearly every Northern State are earnest-
17 in favor of a representation In the Re
publican national convention based upon
votes, as proposed by Mr. Payne, of the na
tional committee.
Now that the President has called atten
tion to the abuses of the second-class mall
provision of the postal laws. Congress
thould give the matter more attention
than it has. There Is no reason why the
postal service should be a burden to the
country simply to promote private inter
ests. There will be less unhapplness of a very
positive character In this city the next
three months If people will supply them
selves with ccal or wood for the cold spells.
During the mild periods gas can be used,
and the Council should see that people pay
for it only during the days there is enough
to keep them comfortable.
A statement In an outline of the Presi
dent's message In an evening paper, to the
effect that widows of soldiers of the war
for the Union shall receive pensions of $250
a year, will cause very general misunder
standing. What the President recommends
Is that the widow whose Income, exclusive
of brer earnings. I less than $23) a year
ehall be entitled to a pension. At present
the limit Is EC a year.
One of the most Intelligent writers of
f nanclal articles for the press, and one
who has nothing to- say of politics as it
relates to parties, says that the session of
Congress which has begun "does not ex
cite the apprehension of financial disturb
ance which usually attends the delibera
tions of that body." This is a recognition
of the wisdom of a Republican majority
which could not be found when Democratic
Congresses had the affairs of the country
In their hands. The Republican party In
Cct,2t-s may not meet the expectations
c those who believe that there should be
quite important financial legislation, but it
does not cause any apprehension In any
quarter. In other words, a Republican
Congress is trusted by the country.
tiii: president's message.
President McKlnley's message is the
longest on record, yet tho.uc who look It
over to see where it could be reduced, and
at the same time give to Congress the con
dition of public affairs and such recom
mendations as he deems Important, will
find they have undertaken a difficult task.
The United States is a large nation, with
varied Interests and world-wide relations.
The Spanish war, for which both parties
are responsible, added very materially to
the Important Interests of the government
and the duties of the President.
If It Is assumed that the President puts
the matters which he regards of the greater
Importance in the first of his message, he
holds that currency and bond legislation Is
the most Important. In his Judgment the
time has come to establish the gold basis
and to take the government out of the
business of Issuing money by extending
the operations of the national banking sys
tem so that it can respond to the demands
of the business of the country, which, dur
ing some periods, requires a greater vol
ume of circulating medium than at others.
The President would have a gold reserve
for the redemption of greenbacks and the
keeping of the two metals at parity with
each other. Thus the treasury would be a
tower of strength rather than a source of
weakness whenever financial clouds ap
pear. The President next advocates the
encouragement of a merchant marine by
Congress as a necessity of our broadening
commerce. He then takes up the matter
of trusts. He regards combinations de
signed to control production and fix prices
In a manner to interfere with fair competi
tion as evils and not the evolution of our
Industrial system. It may be an old-fashioned
theory, but the President holds it,
end quotes ex-President Harrison and Sen
ator Sherman and expresses the opinion
that Congress has the power to prevent in
terference with commerce between the
States.
Considerable pace 7s devoted to setting
forth our relations with other nations. It
is enough for the most of us to know that
we are at peace with the world and on
terms of unusual friendship with all the
nations. Some matters, like the opening of
the markets of Germany for our agricul
tural products, and the fusslness of Can
ada relative to the Alaskan boundary, re
main to be adjusted, but they are trivial
affairs. The Samoan difficulty, which has
been the cause of frequently recurring dis
sensions, has been settled.
The President' declares that the United
States must keep its pledge to Cuba and
the world to give the peoplo of the island
an Independent government. All the ef
forts of the United States must be directed
to that end. Everything which has been
done by the authority of the President has
that end In view; It Is the duty of this
government to see that the people of Cuba
are In a position to maintain a stable and
free government before its supervision is
withdrawn. In the President's Judgment
our mission is not fulfilled if we "turn
adrift any loosely framed commonwealth
to face the vicissitudes which too often
attend weaker states."
A considerable portion of the message 13
devoted to the Philippines. The President
takes the ground that the Islands are ours
"by every title of law and equity," and
that "they cannot be abandoned" unless
we are wil'ing "to leave them at once to
anarchy and finally to barbarism," and
"filng them, a golden apple of discord,
among the rival powers." For the govern
ment of the islands the president offers no
suggestion. The plan of government Is
left to the wisdom of Congress. Roth In
regard to Cuba and the Philippines, the
views of'tl.e President make the charge of
imperialism and militarism grotesque, since
all he hasdone and all he recommends
tend to establish free government, admin
istered by the people of the islands.
The President briefly sets forth the rea
sons which led him' to modify the last or
der of his predecessor extending the limits
cf the classified service. To all reasonable
friends of an efficient civil service the
President's reason for his action will be
satisfactory. He has extended to the army
and other branches of the service, to which
It Is Impossible to apply a competitive ex
amination, the system which has produced
such excellent results In the navy yards.
The President expresses the opinion that
the merit system has been greatly
strengthened by the changes which he has
made. He declares that character and
qualification shall be the prerequisites to
employment lnthe civil service In the new
ly acquired possessions.
The foregoing are a few of the more
prominent features of a message which
shows that the President Is familiar with
the varied affairs of the government.
THE TWO PARTIES AM TRI STS.
The decision of the Supreme Court affirm
ing the right of Congress to legislate in
regard to trusts, coming as It does just as
Congress is taking up Its work, will doubt
less have the effect of encouraging the
lawmaking body' to further legislation up-
on the subject. The only legislation upon
the subject was that of the List Congress
which was Republican In both branches.
President McKInley, in his message, very
appropriately, not to say adroitly, presents
the attitude and the efforts of the two par
tics In the government upon this question.
The President quotes from the message of
President Harrison in December, 1SS0, to
show that at that period Republican states
men appreciated the evils which might
result from combinations to restrict pro
duction and trade. He further calls atten
tion to the fact that the Congress to which
this message was delivered responded by
the passage of the Sherman anti-trust act.
It was evidently the opinion of General
Harrison and Senator Sherman that the
federal government has authority under ,
the Constitution to deal with combinations
Interfering with the freedom of Interstate
commerce.
But how was it with the Democrats? Mr.
Cleveland's attorney general caused it to
be understcod that the Sherman law was
Invalid and gave the country the Impres
sion that the federal government had no
sanction under the Constitution to legis
late in regard to trusts. Mr. Cleveland,
two years after the passage of the Sher
man act. in his message to Congress,
which Trepidant McKInley quotes, expressed
Joubt whether a remedy for the evil of
trusts could be found In federal legislation.
.At the same time he condemned the Sher
man act as inadequate, because of the In
terpretation of the courts. The fact Is Mr.
Cleveland, his attorney general, Mr. Olney,
and other leaders and lawyers of the Dem
ocratic persuasion were not able to divest
themselves of the long-standing Demo
cratic doctrine lhat under the federal Con
stitution the United States has no implied
powers and possesses only such as are
founded upon the strictest construction of
the Constitution. That doctrine Is now a
tradition, and a tradition that is vanishing.
The Supreme Court has decided In every
case in which unlawful combinations are
attempted in violation of interstate com
merce that Congress has power to legislate.
It has, therefore, sustained the views of
Harrison, Sherman and leading Republic
ans which are embodied In the Sherman
law and has rejected the doubts of Mr.
Cleveland and his associates, wh ch seemed
to prevent the two entirely Democratic
Congresses which followed the Congress en
acting the Sherman law from taking any
action hostile to trusts. In this latest de
cision the court has declared without res
ervation that Congress has power to legis
late against all combinations of manufac
turers which are in restraint of commerce
between the States. And now President
McKInley urges Congress, which has the
highest assurance of Its right to legislate
against trusts prejudicial to Interstate com
merce, to enact further anti-trust laws.
REPRESENTATION AND VOTES.
There Is every reason to believe that the
proposition of Mr. Payne, the Wisconsin
member of the national Republican com
mittee, to base the representation In na
tional nominating conventions upon the
number of Republican votes polled at the
preceding presidential election will meet
the general approval of the Republicans In
the States In which there Is a fighting Re
publican party. Such a change is clearly
In line with the representative Idea of gov
ernment. Except in Tennessee and Vir
ginia there Is no Republican party in the
South. There might be-under different con
ditions, but those conditions are at pres
ent out of the question. The most those
who would be Republicans In the South
can ask of the party is that they give
them, with the rest of tho country, sound
legislation and effective administration.
As it now stands, the 124 delegates from
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina,
with a minority of the delegates from the
Republican States from -the North, could
nominate a candidate for President, and
yet the Republicans in most of those States
do not have a state ticket, and would not
have a state organization if it were not for
sending delegates to the national conven
tions. While there are some good men In
the Republican party in the South, there Is
good reason to believe that they maintain
tho two or three fighting organizations
they have simply to secure the federal, pat
ronage. As a matter of fact, the contend
ing organizations are a hindrance to the
growth of Republican influence in the
South, because administrations are gener
ally so bound to those men that they can
not Ignore them and appoint to office con
servative men who enjoy the confidence
of the people among whom they live. The
Injustice of the present system appears in
the fact that the States of Alabama, Ar
kansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mis
sissippi and South Carolina, casting 200,075
votes in li. had 121 delegates in the last
national convention, while Indiana, giving
McKInley 323.74$ votes, had but thirty votes
in the nominating convention. This Is sim
ply a sample of the injustice of the present
system of representation In Republican na
tional conventions. It is so glaring that It
cannot be defended.
Mr. Payno's plan Is to give each State
four delegates at large and one delegate
for either 8,000 or 10,000 Republican votes
cast In the preceding election. Upon this
basis the seven States giving the Repub
lican candidate for President 200.076 votes
In 1S93 will have a much larger representa
tion than Indiana now has. and seventeen
more delegates than this State would have
at the rate of one delegate for 10,000 votes.
Party policy and plain Justice demand some
such change as Mr. Payne advocates. There
should be no representation that is not
backed by votes.
A contributor who knows a work of art
when he sees it and Is well qualified to
judge of Its merits, speaks approvingly
In another column of a drawing In a New
York paper by a young Inuiana artist. The
Journal had inspected this, picture with
considerable interest before its attention
was directed toward It and before It knew
the Hoosier origin of the work. It Is called
"The Turkey Girl," and represents a
young woman In very scant attire, a sheet,
to-wit, standing In her bare feet on the
cold, damp ground In what is apparently
a November evening, judging by the naked
Umbs-of the trees. She has a horn at her
lips the correspondent calls It a flute
and is engaged in blowing It for some pur
pose unknown. Half a dozen turkeys about
her feet are gazing at her in wonder and
no wonder! They probably never saw a
woman so conduct herself before. They are
good turkeys; they have a great deal of
expression and behave precisely as such
birds would on such an occasion. The girl
Is also quite pleasing as a mere work of
art, for the Journal never had any doubt
that the drawing was a bit of real art.
What it is unable to make out is what the
composition means. Why Is she a turkey
girl and what are she and the flock doing
out at that time of night? The correspond
ent says the picture is poetical. Doubtless
it is, but the Journal makes haste to say,
out of regard for the estimable rural maid
ens of the State, that the gifted young
artist drew entirely from his Imagination,
and that he never, no never in all his life,
saw the like of that scene In Indiana, and
never v'M.
The announcement that Indianapolis Is
eoon to have a new and modern hotel,
which is made upon the authority of the
gentlemen who have contracted to carry out
the project, will be received with more than
ordinary gratification. The proposed im
provement promises to be one of the most
costly and important that has been made in
this city for many years, second only per
haps to the r.ew government building, and
will supply a much-needed want. It is to
be hoped that nothing ma arise to inter
fere with the consummation of the plan.

LAW AGAINST TRUSTS
ATTORNEY GENERAL GRIGGS EX
PLAINS THE ACT OF 1SOO.
It Is Directed Only Against Illegal
Corporations Engaged In Inter
state Commerce.
HAS NOT SHIRKED HIS DUTY
SLITS nilOL'GIIT IX ALL CASES
WHERE FACTS WARRANTED.
Higher Salaries for United States
Judges Recommended 'Court of
Claims Durdened.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-Attorney Gen
eral Griggs, in his annual report to Con
gress, reviews the work of the Department
of Justice during the year and then says
that application Is occasionally made to
the department to have legal proceedings
brought In the name of the United States
against corporations or combinations of
companies that are alleged to be engaged In
forming or maintaining monopolies or agree
ments in restraint of trade or competition.
"Such actions," the attorney general 6aya,
"can be maintained only when the offense
comes within the scope of the federal
courts. Ihe only federal legislation against
combinations in restraint of trade is con
tained in the so-callsd Sherman act of July
2, lSSJ. It will be observed that this statute
Is directed only to combinations or monopo
lies in restraint of trade or commerce
among the several States or with foreign
nations. It does not pretend to go into
other branches cf business or commerce,
or attempt in any way to interfere with
thore transactions which are carried on ex
clusively within the confines of a State,
or which do not amount to what, under the
decis!on3 of the United States Supreme
Court, is understood by the term 'interstate
commerce. The federal government has no
constitutional right to supervise, direct, or
Interfere with the transaction of ordinary
business by the people of the several States
unless such business relates' directly, and
not Incidentally, to interstate commerce,
and such has been the decision of the Su
preme Court of the United States."
The attorney general discusses this sub
ject at some length, quoting freely from de
cisions of the courts sustaining his position
and, In conclusion says: "In all cases where
the facts presented to the attorney general
capablo of legal proof have established sat
isfactorily such an agrement or combi
nation In restraint of Interstate commerce
as Is contemplated by the Sherman act,
legal proceedings have been taken by him
In the name of the United States either to
dissolve the combination or to punish the
offenders by Indictment."
The attorney general also refers to the
many important questions which have
arisen in the administration of the govern
ment and affairs of our new insular pos
sessions, appends copies of opinions rendered
by him on the same.
Referring to the work of the Court of
Private Land Claims, the attorney general
says: "It will doubtless be necessary lor
Congress to provide for some tribunal
similar to this court to hear and dispose of,
upon such principles as Congress may
specify, claims of an Incomplete character
to public lands in the recently acquired
territory of the United States In Porto
Rico and the Philippine islands. As to
Porto Rico especially, early provision for
the determination of questIonsof this kind
ought to be made, and legislation ought to
be passed to provide methods and restric
tions ujider which rights in public lands
and waters In that Island can be acquired.
The rivers and streams as well as the
water front on the seaboard In Porto Rico
were formerly vested In the crown of
Spain, and the ownership of them has now
passed to the United States and can only
be disposed of in accordance with the will
of Congress. No structure or improvement
for the benefit of the towns or cities which
requires the use of the waters of the
streams or the shores of the Island can
now be made, as there Is at present no
law which authorizes any person to grant
the necessary license or permission for
even the temporary diversion of the
waters, whether navigable or not."
On the subject of judicial salaries, the
attorney general says: "It Is not an un
common thing to find a lawyer appearing
before the United States Courts in a ca?e
where his fee for one argument exceeds
the annual salary of the Judge. The judges
of the United States Supreme Court and of
the Circuit and District courts are inade
quately compensated. The same is true of
those of the Court of Claims. The courts
of the United States are everywhere in the
civilized world held In the very highest re
pute, yet their judges are paid smaller sal
aries than are allowed by the States to
state Judges In very many Jurisdictions. I
believe that an increase of the salary of
the chief Justice and associate Justices of
the Supreme Court to $20,000 a year, of the
circuit Judges to $10,000 and the district
judges to $7,500 a year would be a slmpN
measure of justice and approved by every
just minded citizen."
On the subject of Alaska, the attorney
general says: "The administration of af
fairs in Alaska, and especially the adminis

REVENUE ACT ATTACKED.
Constitutionality of the Inheritance
Tax Questioned.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. Argument was
begun to-day In the United States Supreme
Court in the cases Involving the constitu
tionality of the provision in the war-revenue
act for the taxation of Inheritances.
There are five of these cases, as follows:
High vs. Coyne, collector of internal rev
enue at Chicago: Knowlton's Executors vs
Moore, collector at Brooklyn: the Fidelity
Insuance Trust and Safe Deposit Company
vs. McClaln. collector at Philadelphia:
Murdock, Executor, vs. Ward, collector at"
New York city; Sherman vs. The United
States, from Albany. N. Y. By agreement
the hearing Is to consume eight hours, of
which time the government Is to take only
two hours.
The first hearing was given to Mr. A. M.
Pence, representing the High estate, and
he w as followed by Mr. Wheeler 11. Pa kr
ham, of the Knowlton case. Other attor
nevs to be heard in the case are: Richard
C.'Dale. Charles II. Otis. Charles E. Patter
son and John G. Carlisle, all of whom rep
resent the appellants. Solicitor General
Richards will appear for the government,
speaking before Mr. Carlisle, who will close
the hearing. Ex-Speaker Reed is counsel In
two of the cases, and it was expected that
he would be heard, but he contented him
self with filing a brief in opposition to the
law.
The' appellants attack the law on the
ground that it provides for a direct tax.
which Is not apportioned among the States
according to population, as required by the
Constitution, and that, even If not a direct
tax. it is unconstitutional because It Is not
uniform in its operation, exempting, as It
does, legacies under $10,000; that. If Inherit
ances are taxable at all. the power to Im
pose such a tax rests with the States exclusively.
KILLED AND EATEN.
A Tonne German Trader In the Ad
miralty Group, South Sen Islands.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Dec. 5.-Detalls
were brought by the steamer Warrlmoo
from Australia of the atrocious murder of
a white man and subsequent devouring of
the body by the treacherous cannibals of
the Admiralty Islands. A letter, dated
Manlapea, New Britain, says:
"Twelve months ago two youn? Ger
mans named Metzke and Molte opened a
trading station on the small Island of St.
Andrew, in the Admiralty group to the
north of German New Guinea, and. In spite
of the fact that these natives are a most
treacherous and cunning race, appeared to
get on very well with them. The two
traders decided to purchase the island.
Molte went to New Britain to arrange the
deal, leaving Metzke with ten Solomon
island boys. Upon Molte's return he found
that Metzke had been murdered, together
with four of his boys, and the bodies had
been cut up, cooked and eaten by the sav
ages." The last murder of white men in these
islands was in 1892.
EXPLANATION BY CLARK
MONTANA SENATOR MAKES STATE
MENT ABOUT THE CONTEST.
, . ,
Gets After Whiteside and nn Anony
mous Preacher Sharply Satisfied
for Senate to Investigate.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. The World s Wash
! lngton correspondent telegraphs the fol
lowing statement, dictated by Senator V.
A. Clark, of Montana:
"It may seem remarkable to those who
do not know our Populist Governor that
he should sign such a protest, having
signed my credentials after all the develop
ments in the senatorial contest at Helena.
More than this, the credentials were signed
after thorough investigation had been
made by a legislative committee and by
a grand jury, and after the findings of
both had been reported. Since then no new
evidence has been elicited. Tt those who
know Governor Smith, however, his action
gives no cause for surprise. As' to the story
of the $30,000 exposure, the circumstances,
as related are too absurd to be creditable
to any reasonable person. The evidence giv
en in the recent disbarment proceedings
against Attorney Welcome, before the
State Supreme Court of Montana, by
Whiteside and State Senator Mark, is so
conflicting and contradictory as compared
with that w.dch they gave before the
grand Jury, as to entirely discredit and
make their statements nugatory and, be
sides, the evidence of a number of the
most prominent and honorable men of the
State was prouueed to impeach the char
acters of these men for veracity. White
side is now under bond to appear before
the District Court in whose jurisdiction
he lives and will be arraigned on Wednes
day to answer a charge of having at
tempted to bribe the deputy county clerk
to give him access to ..no vaults In which
ballot boxes were stored in November,
lSdS, at which time he was a candidate
for state senator, and believed he had been
defeated. Overwhelming evidence will bo
produced in substantiation of this charge
against Whiteside. After Whiteside had
made his charges of bribery in the State
Senate I demanded that a searching in
vestigation be made. The presiding judge
charged the Jury fully to leave no stone
unturned in their efforts to reach the guilty
persons if an attempt at bribery had bec-n
made. A large number of witnesses were
examined during an Investigation lasting
two weeks. The grand jury reported that
there was no evidence upon which an in
dictment could be found.
"There is another thing which has been
misunderstood and that is that in all these
alleged cases of bribery it has not been
shown in a single instance by any evidence
that any of the parties so charged at any
time voted for me. The statements circu
lated to the effect that a preacher named
Warren testified that I had authorized him
to pay $10,000 to a friend, who, he alleged,
stood ready to vote for me for a consid
eration, has been falsely reported. All that
he did say, and that was an infamous lie,
was that I could not consider any proposi
tion of that kind myself, but would see
that it was attended to. This 'divine, dur
ing his talk with me, asked for a contribu
tion for his church, at East Helena. I gave
him a check for $100. He was very careful
to have the check made payable to him in
stead of to the trustees of his church.
After an examination of the indorsements
upon the check I am quite confident that
he pocketed the money himself and that
the church did not profit any by the con
tribution. "This contest, instituted to-day. Is the
culmination of an unprovoked, pernicious,
malicious and bitter warfare which has
been waged against me for twelve years by
parties who have used every means to con
trol not only the politics, but the execu
tive. Judicial and legislative departments of
the State, and to monopolize the vast public
business interests of the State. I am quite
willing to leave this matter in the hands
of United States senators, knowing that
upon a full Investigation I will be acquitted
of every suspicion of guilt."

Following are the astronomical data for
December. 1S99. furnished by the Washburn
Observatory at Madison: Mercury and Venus
are both evening stars at the opening of the
month: but, while the latter daily appears
higher in the southwestern fcky after sun
set, and more brilliant, the former Is reced
ing towards the sun and passes through In
ferior conjunction Dec. 5. It then becomes
a morning star, and may be seen later in
the southeastern sky before sunrise, most
favorably about Dec 24, on which date the
planet reaches its greatest distance west
from the sun. Mars and Jupiter are too
near the sun for observation the present
month; but Jupiter is becoming visible
again and may be seen as a brilliant, steady
star In the southeastern sky in the morn
ing. The principal fixed stars visible during the
month in the evening hours are: To the
west, Vega. Altair. the bright stars of the
constellation Andromeda. To the east Al
deboran, the Pleiades. Sirlus. Procyon, the
bright stars of the constellation Orion, Ca
peila. Caster and Pollux.
There will be an annular eclipse of the sun
cn Dec. 2 in the early evening, according to
the time of the western world; but no phase
of the eclipse will be visible outside of the
Antarctic. Southern Pacllic and Southern
Indian oceans. The path of central eclipse
passes near the south pole.
There will also be an eclipse of the moon

SURPRISE AT THE TRIAL OF TIII3
ALLEGED POISO.EIl.
New Evidence Tending: to.Shonr the
Defendant Harbored Enmity To
rrarda Harry Cornish.
t -
INTRODUCTION OF LETTERS
THAT WERE WRITTEN AT THE IN
STIGATION OF 3IOLINEUX.
Frfend of the Latter In willingly
Forced to Testify Attorney .
, Weeks Not Heeded.
--
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. The surprise of
the day in the trial of Roland B. Moiineaux
for the murder of Katherine J. Adams, was
the sudden introduction by the prosecution
of direct .testimony that Mollneux harbored
bitter enmity toward Harry Cornish and
A. A. Harpster, a former employe of the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club and a friend
of Cornish: further, that Mollneux sought
in a roundabout way by having an agent
writ to Harpster's former employo over
a false signature to obtain Information re
flecting on Harpster's character, that ha
might use the Information to Harpster's In
jury. This new testimony, which v. as ex
tracted from an unwilling friend of Mol
lneux, is . important not only as showing
a motive for Molineux seeking the death
of Cornish, but as confirming t! theory of
the prosecution that Mollneux wrote or
caused to be written several letters, false
ly signed, asking for drugs and medicines.
The witness who testified concerning the
letter-writing methods of Mollneux was
Rudolph Helles, of Newark. N. J., former
cashier of the Knickerbocker Athletic Club.
Helles worked beside Harpster, who was a
clerk at the club. Mollneux said he wanted
to learn something damaging about Harp
ster for the purpose of getting him dis
missed. Thereupon Helles testified he
wrote a letter to Frederick Stearns & Co.,
of Detroit, who formerly employed Harp
ster, asking for information as to Harp
ster's reputation. Heiles signed the letter
"Charles Jabs & Co." The witness testi
fied that Mollneux said Harpster had been
responsible forhls leaving the Knicker
bocker Athletic Club; that Harpster was a
"dirty loafer and the same kind of a man
as Cornish."
In answer to the questions put by Mr.
Osborne, Helles said he had destroyed the
letter he received in answer to the one
sent by him to Steams & Co. He did this
about two months after the death of Mrs.
Adams.
Helles was asked by Mr. Osborne if he
secuied the papers during the course of
the inquest, and replied In the affirmative.
DESTROY t-D A CIEW.
. "Is It not a fact that you then learned
for the first time," said the assistant dU
trict attorney, "that a letter written to
Frederick Stearns &. Co., and signed by the
bogus Cornish, had been found, and that
as soon as you read that In the newspaper
accounts of the inquest you immediately
destroyed the letter you had received, frona
the Stearns company in answer to the one
you wrote them and signed 'Charles II.
Jacobs?'
"Yes," replied the witness.
"Is it not a fact that you destroyed that
letter because you knew you were destroy
ing a clew?"
"Yes," said Helles.
"Is It not also a fact that you knew when
you destroyed that letter that the man who
had written the bogus Cornish letters to
Frederick Stearns & Co. was this man
accused of the crime?"
"Yes," again replied the witness.
' The witness was then taken In hand by
Recorder Goif, who examined him for sev
eral mlnutc-3, the examination resulting la
a reiteration of the facts brought out by
the prosecution.
Frank' C McLaughlin, an employe of
Frederick Stearns & Co., of Detroit, was
also placed on the stand. Mr. Weeks ob
jected to the Introduction of this witnesj
at this time. He was overruled, and tho
witness was asked If tnere had ever been in
the employ of Frederick Stearns & Co. a
man named A. A. Harpster. He answered
in tne ainrrnatlve, and tald that he had been
employed there about four or five years.
As soon as the name of Harpster was
mentioned Mr. WeeKs arose and objected,
on the ground that the man mentioned was
beyond the jurisdiction of this county and
that such introduction at this time was not
In any way relevant or competent. The
court overruled the objection by Mr. Weeks,
who objected seriously and persistently. He
insisted on explaining the situation, but was
not allowed to do so, and was peremptorily
sent to his seat.
LETTERS IDENTIFIED.
The witness was shown a letter, presum
ably the letter written to that firm' and
signed "11. Cornish." and was asked if he
recognized it. The witness identified it. giv
ing the exact date on which the letter was
received. It was received Oct. 21, 1S3S. An
other letter was shown and Id -anti del as
having been received by Frederick Stearns
& Co.. on Dec. 24, 1S0S. Doth letters were
offered In evidence and marked as ex
hibits. Mr. Osborne then asked the witness If
the firm made answer to the letters. The
answer was in the affirmative. Witness
said Frederick Stearns was an acquaint
ance of H. Cornish. Witness then produced
a letter press copy of the answer sent In
reply to the letter signed "II. Cornish,"
inquiring about Harpster. Mr. McLaugh
lin swore that he had known Cornish for
some time.
The first witness called lor the prosecu
tion was Dr. Edward F. Hitchcock, the
physician who was called to attend Mrs.
Adams immediately after she discovered
that she had taken the poison which re
sulted In her death. The cross-examination,
conducted by Bartow S. Weeks, was long
and severe, but the attorney for the de
fense failed to shake the testimony of the
witness in any important respect. The
statement of Dr. Hitchcock at the time of
the coroner's inquest was gone over as
though with a fine tooth comb and con
trasted with the statements made at to
day's trial. The drift of the questions
asked by Mr. We-ks seemed to Indicate
that the defence still clung to the theory
that Harry Cornif-h. who gave the poison
to Mrs. Adams, knew more about the af
fair than he was willing to admlL
