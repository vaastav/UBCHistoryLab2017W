Lavender

; Lovers
By OLIVIA B. STUOHM
(Copyrltht, 1905, bjOllrU B. SttohmV
CHAPTER XIX.
It was Juno when Wlnslow was
enco moro able to be about.
Although ha was pale and thin, he
made great effort to get strong. For
he must soon agitato tho school
project, and ho must sco Lavender. He
had received no messago direct from
Aaron Burr, and, so slow was travel,
knew nothing of the trial or Us prog
ress. He only knew thnt Uio gov
ernor general to whom ho was the
bearer of letters from Aaron Burr, was
on his way to denounce tho man, his
partner, as Wlnslow believed, In tho
transaction. Much of the mystery of
that transaction might be cleared by
those lottors but there was no hurry,
and still ho kept his own counsel.
Meantime word had been brought
him by boat to St. Louis from a friend
then established In New Madrid. The
letter ran:
"My script is scant, and It behooves
mo to make a living In these wilds.
I am going to teach the western rustics
hew to trip the light fantastic In the
little frisks they hold In the barns.
Murray, too, is here do you remem
ber hlni? His nmbition is equally high
soaring with mine; ho Is to teach the
'fiddle' (ho dare not say tho violin,
or he would have no pupils). As for
yourself go thou and do likewise,
Find somo young Ideas, and teach
them how to lihoot something, any
thing. We are all scattered for tho
present; stranded like snags along
the river. But it is not for long. Burr
will be acquitted; Goq bles3 him, and
then we will all go back In a blaze of
glory."
And Wlnslow, too, took this hope
ful view. Of course his leader, too
wise, too brainy for trickery, must suc
seed in proving his Innocence proving
that he was no traitor, no arch-plot
ter against tho nation's peaco. For
whatever light tho lamp of history may
have thrown upon It, the accusation of
Aaron Burr seemed to Wlnslow a3 a
willful bit of party slander, wrecking
the hopes and destroying the prospects
of innocent men; a fabrication found
ad upon malice, and fostered by Ig
norance and sycophancy.
And here, aa In St. Louis, ho had no
hesitation in freely speaking his mind,
with small respect for authority. If
here, too, he met with no opposition,
It was mainly duo to ignorance, not of
tho facts, merely, but of tho parties
concerned.
One ufternoon, at sunset, Wlnslow
walked along one of tho narrow by
paths which diverged from the main
road. Elder blossoms waved their
parasols of snow on either side, and
a multitude of wild roses trespassed
on the right of way. At the end of
the view rose a pllo of clouds, downy
and purple, a royal couch for tho sun.
Suddenly, In the hollow of a rail
fence, and from over the top of a
screening tangle, Wlnslow espied a bit
of blue cotton. Seen closer, this took
the form of a sunbonnet, and Inspec
tion revealed a girl's face beneath
Perched on tho highest rail, her hands
tightly clasping the bar, sho made an
attractive spot in the landscape. But
a nearer view marred tho effect, Her
face was white with dismay, her jaws
apart in fright. For In tho grass at
her feet, as If waiting her first move
ment to attack, was a snake long
mottled, ugly.
One blow of tho stout cane Wlnslow
carried, nnd tho thing, vengeful In
death, writhed with Impotent swing of
Its ringed tail. There was a pause, and
tho girl drew long shuddering
breath.
"I'm ever so much obliged " was all
she said, but the grateful slgs; lnt dig
nity to the words.
"Don't mention It, I beg," ana Win3
low stood gravely regarding her fioii
his own point of vantage,
Sho climbed from tho rail, stopping
gingerly as If to. avoid the yet quiver
ing snnko.
Wlnslow extended his hand to help
nor; sho was about to take It, for the
first tlmo closoly observing him. Then,
with a sharp cry, sho backed away
from him, and leaned upon the fenco,
staring at him with wide, frightened
eyos. "No, no," sho murmured.
Ho smiled reassuringly. "Does this
bandage alarm you? It Is nothing
x mero scratch,"
To his amazement, sho fell to sob
bing, nor faco burled in her folded
hands.
Stepping close to hor, ho said, kind
ly: "Vou are unnerved by your recent
fright; I do not want to leave you un
til you are qulto calm; shall we walk
on together?"
Still she did not answer. At a loss,
and loath to leavo her, for night was
falling, Wlnslow' porsistcd; "Other
snakes may como to tho funeral of
their fellow It Is low aud dunp here;
como,"
She seemed so young aud helpless, n
timid child. Ho ceutly touched her
shoulder "Como."
But she shook oft his touch, am?,
falsing her eyes, mot his with a look
of mingled fear and defiance, "Yo"
must nut touch me rou must no,
pcfc to bm. 9 c-n, oh, pleas W
on."
Ho made no reply, but his glane of
cold Inquiry traveled from her to th
yet writhing snake, and back asain. To
the disdainful reproach of his manner
sho hastened to say: "Yes, 1 know you
saved foe I am not ungrateful, but,
oh. no I can't forget!"
Wlnslow wa3 puzzled and not a
little angry. Was tho girl crazy? Ha
was tempted to leavo her aud return
to the inn. He was tired, tho dew
fell heavily, and his wound not yet
healed, wns aching. Ho wa3 In no
mood lor rustic coquetry nor maiden
caprice. But the lane was lonely, sun
set clouds wore now a bank of black
ness In a fast darkening sky; he ought
not to go without the offer, at least,
of escort So, curbing his lmpatlonce,
ho aald: "Pray explain; you cannot
forgot what?"
Her voice sank to an aod whisper
as sho replied: "That night in the
forest; your faee and, and his."
In a flash It occurred to him that
she alluded in some mysterious way
to the night of his struggle in the
wood. How much did sho know? It
could scarcely be less than his own
knowledge of the affair, and so he told
her. "I presume you are spenklng of
the night when I was attacked, but I
did not see you. In fact " and he
shrugged his shoulders, "I'm afraid my
wlt3 wore wool-gathering, for I saw no
body, until tho man sprang at me."
WlUi a quick Impulse to shield her
dead, he said: "Father did not know It
was you."
Horror and surprise were blendedln
his tone: "Your father? Then It
was "
Susan Miller lowered her head un
til tho sunbonnet hid her face. Mis
understanding her silence and shrink
ing, Wlnslow spoke lightly: "That
need not prevent your accepting cour
tesy at my bauds. I boar no ill-will,
I assure you."
Her eyes dilated with scorn, and she
seemed a woman row, as she faced
him proudly: "You can talk so calmly
about It; you who killed him!"
Her words cut the air like a knife,
aud his wound pained afresh with the
sting of 1L Steadying himself with
an effort: "I'm afraid I don't under
stand you," he said. "Your father
was my assailant In the forest, and you
say I killed him."
Her silence gave consent, and he
continued, qulotly: "There Is some
mistake; I did not kill him."
She repeated his words slowly, as
If learning a lesson. "You did not kill
him?" There was more conviction
than query in her tone, for she believed
him already. And then, as belief In
him came, another suspicion fastened
upon her liko a nightmare.
Sho listened, stock still, while ho
told her all he knew, adding: "My only
weapon was a pistol, which I could not
reach, had I wished to use it. You
heard no shot fired?"
She shook her head, and he went on:
"You must believe me, then. Tho
last sight I recall was tho Hash of
steel lu your father's hand."
He stood in deep thought for a mo
ment, then: "They all think me guilty,
I suppose?"
She bowed, but before ho could speak
hastened to say: "You need not be
alarmed, sir. Nono will think the less
of you; my poor father had no friends."
There was bitter shame and sorrow
lu the short sentence, and Wlnslow's
heart stirred with pity. There were
many things he wanted to ask why
her father had assaulted him, a harm
less stranger, how she happened to be
present, and other questions which
might bring light upon tho coll of un
certainty. But he would not further
hurt this orphan girl. "It Is no won
der you shrank from a hand you
thought stained with your father's
blood, but " and he leaued gently
toward her, "but you will take it now."
Sho laid her soft palm In his with
out a word. Through her slmplo mind
ran a thousand thoughts which her
tongue had no power to utter. She
saw his generosity, and was grateful
for this manna of kindness in hor
starved life. But only tho pressure of
her hand revealed hor feelings only
tho look In her eyes that, llko the
fawn's of her own wild wood, told
much for lack of speech.
"It is growing lute; do you live
far?"
"Yonder at tho end of tho lane.
"Then let us haste, or see, Charles
Wain will bo there before us."
On they went through thu sweot
sceuted night; thu narrow way seemed
hemmed in by tree ami bush and
cieoying ivy that begrudged to man
evec this tluy path,
Little was said by either. Sue's
thoughts were buny. She was sad
dened by the brooding fear that had
oppressed her since first sho knew this
man was not her fk.Um-'o murderer.
For If not he, who? None other was
near except and au ;amy tugged at
her heart as sho reallssd that Gerald,
too, was there! Her lyvev, who had
beeu threatened, prorokod, perhaps,
beyond endurance. Hd his, then,
been tho murderous knlfo or arrow
(for nono had known, nor cured to find
out which weapon had ended so
worthless a life)?
Was It, than, her promised husband
whoso blow had locked her lather's
lips whllo yet a curse contorted them?
Wlnslow interrupted hor quiet rev
erie with a laugh. "Do you know thnt
I hope boo 11 to bo a landowner? I
am golug to tako up a thousand arp
onts, but havo not yet decided upon
the location. You seo, I intend to take
plenty of time to fulfill every 1 equip
ment of these crratlo laus. The toma
hawk mode of adjustment is too primi
tive. Time was wheu pilniltlve and
honest went toscther, hut I'm afraid
that day Is past."
Sue was grieved by the reminiscence
which tho stringer's wards conjmnd
Though la different Unsuagrt Uy ex
pressed the sacs fear that Jaiea Ud
been prey to.
Wlnslotr vu saying: "It roust gtvo
quite a feeling of lmportancs this
landed proprietorship. Can you not
Imagine that beyond that clump of
trees stands a Wiw with ancestral
halls at tho enrf of the drlvo no
park and dee nro bore, we only uoed
tho JSimily plate and portraits."
Ho was trying to rouso her out of
this pathetic mood. But though sho
laughed, her mirth was forced, damp
ened not only by tho trend of her
thoughts, but by awe of this stranger.
He and Gerald Crelghton were tho only
genUemn sho had ever known. With
tho one she had no sense of inferiority.
For, as by tho power of lovo sho was
raised to h(n o lu degree, Gerald had
sunk to her level, and the difference In
station was wiped out. But slmplo
friendship has keener vision, and with
Wlnslow she was herself tho "branch'
water girl," reserved to shyness.
Near tho ash-tree In the lano she
turned. At tho end of a weedy path
squatted tho cabin. A dingy platform
was Its porch, connecting the corners
whero tho logs mot In unfriendly
union. On the step a female figure
sat with the inert huddling of the body
which no mind directs.
Wlnslow paused at tho entrance to
the garden. "You are safe now," and,
lifting his hat, he was going away.
But she stopped him with a sudden
gesture. "Mr. Wlnslow, what are you
going to do about about what people
think?"
He faced her Inquiringly: "What
peoplo think?" he repeated.
"I mean about the death of poor
dad. Everybody belloves you killed
him; are you going to tell tho truth?"
"As plain as speech can mako it," ho
replied.
liiUU, aiUObCU IA OCU UO il.on
"Would you not have It so?" he askeu,
In wonderment
And his wonder grew when she an
swered, rapidly, gaining courage with
every word: "I would not Tho only
good that would como of it would be to
clear your name, aud that, sir, It does
not need. I know these people; I
know how little they care for human
life less than this " and sho shook
the petals from a wild rose.
Then, ruefully, as she gazed at the
bared heart of tho flower: "And my
poor father's life was taken, as all
suppose, fairly In defense of your own.
Not a word has gono against you;
ain't they all proud to have you for a
teacher a friend? Then, sir, let it
rc3t there." '
She paused, ainazed at her own te
merlty: overcome "with tho rush of
words which her distracted heart
beats pushed from her as the blood
they measured.
To Wlnslow it seemed an odd re
quest odd, above all, that she should
make It. And oven as sho spoke, one
thought stood out through tho fog of
doubt; he knew now the reason for
Lavenders coldness knew why she
shrank from seeing hlni. Sho thought
