FEARFUL FIGHT BETWEEN R0-
DENTS AND A FARMER.
tatter "Wan Blinded and May Die He
Had Built a Novel Trap For the Little
Animals and Found Himself Im
prisoned In It Attacked By Hun
dreds of Them.
WILKESBARRE, Pa.. Dec. 9. At
tacked by severaf hundred fierce rats
which swarmed upon him while he was
Imprisoned In a narrow space from
which he could not escape, Robert
Crook of Falrview, a hamlet near this
elty, fought them until his strength
failed and then, unable to beat them
off. fell senseless. He had been terri
bly mutilated when rescued, and his
sight had been destroyed.
Crook, who is a wealthy farmer and
prominent In his community, had suf
fered considerable loss from rats which
Infested his barns.- They destroyed his
farm produce, ate his grain, robbed his
hennery and even ruined his harnesses
In the barn. He resorted to various
methods to exterminate the pests, but
despite all his efforts their numbers
teemed to multiply.
At length he hit upon the idea of
constructing- a monster rat trap In the
left of one of his barns. This trap was
like a big box, some 10 feet square and
about 4 feet high. Mr. Crook complet
ed It a week ago, baited it and then
left it to do its work.
When he visited it some days later,
lie found that its captives numbered
several hundred. The farmer called his
rat terrier Spot and thrust the dog into
the trap in the belief that he would
make short work of the enemy. The dog
prang fiercely to the task, but the rats,
Instead of trying- to escape, leaped up
on him by the score from all sides, and,
although he killed many of them, he
Was soon stretched lifeless in the trap.
Angered at the fate of his pet, Mr.
Crook armed himself with" two stout
cudgels and prepared to do battle with
the rats. He opened the door of the
eagre and crawled In. The wire netting
at the top came too low for him to
stand erect, so, creeping on his knees,
be laid about him with the cudgels.
At the first blow the rats flew at him
they had at the dog. He beat them
down by the dozen, but they swarmed
Upon every part of his body. They bit
bis arms and legs, tore the flesh from
bis hands and fastened upon his face.
The farmer flung himself at the door
CT the cage in a frantic attempt to es
cape. He could not open it. He had
sprung the lock on entering the trap
jnade himself a prisoner. He threw
bla weight against the door, but It did
pot yield. '
The rats had been clinging to him all
this time and tearing his flesh, and now
to frenzy he fell to using his clubs on
them again. His blows were futile. He
mowed down scores of them, but oth
ers sprang to their places. He tore
them from his face and shoulders and
stamped upon them with his boots and
swung his clubs upon them, but he
could not drive them back. His strength
(ailed, and at length the horror of his
Situation overcame his senses, and he
dropped unconscious in the trap.
Farm bands found him in that con
dition a quarter of an hour later. The
tnen opened the door and drove out the
rats, then dragged forth the farmer
and carried him to his house. His nose
and ears were gone, his face frightfully
bitten, his hands torn to the bone, and
bis eyes so scratched that the sight was
destroyed. It Is feared he may lose his
Hie.

Story Frm Watertown of a Valuable
Discovery of Gold.
WATERTOWN, N. Y.. Deo. 9. A ver
itable Klondike has been discovered at
Prospect heights, near Clayton. B. M.
Hill, superintendent of the United
States fish hatchery at that place, first
found an accumulation of glistening
granules in the bottom of a fish tank,
which, when tested, were found to be
pure gold.
Further investigation proved the
sandy soil In the vicinity of the nearby
springs to be rich in the same quality
of the precious metal, which assayed
$18 an ounce, $6 an ounce more than
Klondike gold.
Mr. Hill has filed claim papers cover
ing the mineral wealth, of 24 acres of
land near the heights and will soon
commence sluice mining to determine
whether the gold abounds -in paying
quantities.

WILL REDUC
ACTION BY FALL KIVEIt COTTON
MANUFACTURERS.
Cut Off At Least Ten Per Cent This
Step Will Affect Twenty-Eight Thou
sand Operatives and Has Uenn Ta
ken, to Relieve, If Possible, the Con
gested Stato of the Market.
FALL RIVER, Mass., Dec. 9. At a
general meeting of the Cotton Manu
facturers' association it was voted
unanimously to reduce all wages in the
mills of the city, the amount and time
of the reduction being left to a commit
tee which for some time has had charge
of the matter. It is understood that the
cut will amount to not less than 10 per
cent and that it will go into effect on
Jan. 1. The cut will affect 28.000 oper
atives in this city, who are paid an ag
gregate weekly wage of $180,000.
For some months a committee of the
association has been Investigating the
situation in this city. This committee
consisted of F. B. Chase, treasurer of
the King Philip mill; C. T. Rounsdell,
treasurer of the Shove mill: Joseph A.
Baker, treasurer of the Chace mill;
George H. Hills, treasurer of the Davol
mill, and Fred E. Waterman, treasurer
of the Cornell mill, all the above con
stituting the executive committee of the
Manufacturers' association. To this
committee was added Thomas E. Bacon,
treasurer of the Union mills; J". E. Os
born, treasurer of the American Linen
company, and Dr. R. T. Davis, presi
dent of several corporations in this city.
This committee was instructed to cir
culate a paper among the manufac
turers, as there has been for some time
a feeling that only a reduction would
relieve the congested feeling in the busi
ness atmosphere.
The market value of print cloths for
a long time has been the lowest In the
history of trade, while the demand has
been only fair. Under these conditions
the mills have been selling at a loss.
and the stock of goods has been in
creasing. The committee obtained the signature
of every manufacturer in the city ex
cept one, who is understood to be D. A.
Brayton of the Durfee mill, a private
corporation.
As no reduction could be ordered
without the consent of every mill the
committee decided to report back to the
association. This was done at the gen
eral meeting, and the committee re
ceived the unanimous approval of the
association upon its suggestion that a
reduction be made.
It Is anticipated that the prioe of
weaving a cut of print cloth will be re
duced from 18 to 16 cents.
In August, 1894, a cut of 10 per cent
was ordered, but In April of the next
year an advance by the Fall River Iron
company of the same amount necessi
tated similar action on the part of the
rest of the mills, and wages have been
paid on this basis ever since.
The attitude of the employees on the
matter can hardly be stated until they
have had a chance to talk it over, and
none of the labor leaders' will say very
much about the subject until such
meetings are held.
Probably Will Forfeit Freedom.
HARTFORD, Dec. 9. The blind con
vict, John Tyler, who was conditionally
pardoned on Monday by the state board
of pardons, has made a desperate at
tack on Warden Woodbridge and three
of his officers. He struck Deputy Bats
den with a board from his cot and
wounded Officers Edgett and Knight
with a small knife. Their wounds are
not dangerous. He is confined in a
solitary cell. Tho prisoner has had sev
eral of these freaks, and when In one of
them he is a most desperate criminal.
Chief Justice Andrews has been tele
graphed not to sign the pardon, and
the board will probably revoke their
action.
Insured For a Million.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. George W.Van
derbllt sailed for Europe yesterday. The
rumor was current in Wall street that

surance policy for $1,000,009 with a local

mium on the policy was set at $35,000.
A policy for $1,000,000 has no precedent.
The company declined to make any
statement either confirming or denying
the report, which was generally accept

Necro Murdurer Gets a Respite.

MONETARY COMMISSION.
rornirr Seoretstry l.ulrolilld Sny the
Report Will He Heady Soon.
New York, Dec. 9. Former Secretary
of the Treasury Fairchlld stated to a
reporter 11m t the Monetary Commis
sion, of whlfh he is a member, will un
doubtedly complete its report and rec
ommendation on currency reform with
in a few clays after it reconvenes next
Wednesday.
"Our report," said he, "will go to
Chairman Ilanna. of the Executive
Committee of the Indianapolis conven
tion, and I presume that he will call
the committee together at a convenient
date to pass upon the subject llnally.
Of course, I cannot say what shape
this report will ultimately take ,or to
what extent tho commission will differ
in its recommendations from the views
expressed in the President's message
as to the steps to be taken towards
reorganizing our national finances.
President McKinley has started In the
proper direction, and if he keeps right
on something sound and beneficial will
undoubtedly eventuate. He has not
gone as far as some of us believe he
should, but It is a long step forward
when one of President McKinley's be
longings and antecedents takes such a
pronounced attitude in favor of safe
guarding our finances, as is shown by
his effort to have greenbacks offered
for redemption kept In the Treasury
unless gold is given the Government
in exchange for them.
"I do not care to discuss now the
probable line of suggestion to be made
by the Monetary Commission," con
tinued Mi Fairchlld, "but it is to be
borne in mind, when comparing its
recommendations with those of the
administration, that one is dealing
with the monetary problem as a whole,
while the other is dealing with Con
gress. One is Seeking to determine
what must be done to solve the entire
problem, while the other Is confining
itself to that which may possibly be
accomplished under present conditions,
for that evidently Is what President
McKinley has in mind. No one can
tell, you know, what this Senate will
do, even with the one suggestion the
President makes."
PENSION LEAK MAY BE STOPPED.
Action Aornlnst Youdr Women. Who
Marry Old Soldiers.
Washington, Dec. 9. The House
Committee on Invalid Pensions yester
day took action to correct the abuse
of young women marrying old sol
diers and sailors for the purpose of se
curing their pensions as widows.
The practice was brought to light by
a recent investigation of the pension
rolls for the war of 1812, which showed
that wrhlle there were hut three sur
vivors on the rolls, more than 3,000
widows were drawing pensions.
The committee authorized Chairman
Ray to obtain from the Committee on
Rules an order permitting an amend
ment to the Pension Appropriation bill,
providing thait no pension shall here
after be granted to the widow of a
soldier or other person who is married
to such soldier or other person after the
passage of this act, excepting, how
ever, all soldiers, sailors, officers, etc.,
now in or who may hereafter enter the
military or naval service of the United
States.
The matter has aroused much inter
est among members of Congress, and
many who would not vote to Investi
gate or correct any other form of pen
sion abuse are ready to aid in the fight
aga'.nst what Senator Wilson, of Washing-ton,
calls the "widow business."
TO STOP FILIBUSTERS.
rinse Shown Whnt nil EOIclent Ally
We Have Deen to pnin.
Washington, Dec. 9. Secretary Gage
has submitted to the Department of
State his report upon the action of the
Treasury Department in suppressing
filibustering expeditions to Cuba.
The Secretary points out the signifi
cant fact that during two years and a
half out of 13,585 vessels plying In
Southern waters only six American
vessels, of an aggregate of 1,331 reg
istered tons, are alleged to have suc
cessfully landed expeditions from the
United States in Cuba.
Eight revenue cutters, with crews of
317 men, armed with fifteen guns, have
cruised 75.7GS miles, patrolling the
coast! They have captured seven ves
sels and 115 men; have broken up two
expeditions and have held under sur
veillance thirteen suspected vessels.
GLASS DISPUTE NOT OVER.

Pittsburg, Dec. 9. The acceptance by
the glass workers of the scale offered
by the manufacturers does not mean a
permanent agreement on all points. A.
U. Fieezee, general selling agent for
the glass manufacturers, and several
other members of the association say
that changes will be demanded In the
arbitrary shop scales, which now limit
the output, restrict the trade and con
fine apprenticeship to a narrow limit.
"The time is ripe," said one member,
"to see whether we or the workmen
will manage our factories." The wln-ilog-glass
workers balanced their books
this morning and found that their In
ternal dissensions had been costly,
their clear loss amounting to $24,000.

0UTL00KF0fl HAWAII.
FMENDS OF THE ANNEXATION
TREATY ENCOURAGED.
Think They Can Defeat the Measure
If It Is Dtscnaied In Open Senate.
Ileed Said to Be Opposed to the
Trenty,
Washington, Dec 9. There is to b
a spirited fight against the annexation
of Hawaii. The Democrats have been
rated almost unanimously against the
treaty. A large number of Republic
ans are eflso opposed to annexation
Speaker Reed Is said to be one of them.
He is credited with the statement that
the islands would be a source of weak
ness to the country. Because of the
opposition there is talk of substituting
for the treaty now pending in the Sen
ate a bill that would require only a
majority vote. It takes a two-thirds
vote to ratify a treaty.
The opponents of the treaty acknowl
edge that, while they have gained a
vote or two on the Republican side,
they have lost on the Democratic. The
announcement that Gorman and Pet
tus are with Morgan for annexation is
followed by the announcement that
Turple is also inclined that way. The
statement that Senator Hoar was
against the treaty Is qualified by the
announcement that the Massachusetts
Senator has not declared himself and
will not until after the discussion.
Finn oftfie Opposition,
The plan of the opponents of the
treaty is to have It discussed In open
session. They claim that if this is
done they can get their arguments
against annexation before the country
and bring pressure to bear on the Sen
ate against the treaty. The leaders of
the opposition state that if the treaty
Is discussed In executive session it can
be ratified In one month, but If it is
discussed openly It will be killed. It Is
their plan to prevent the treaty's rati
fication and have the Morgan bill for
annexation reported and taken up by
both branches of Congress, thus secur
ing an open debate.
The friends of the treaty, while ac
knowledging that they have not yet se
cured a two-thirds vote, state that they
have every prospect of getting it by
the time it is needed. The poll of the
Senate shows 54 votes in favor of the
treaty, 19 against it and 16 uncertain.
From this it will be seen that the
treaty needs only six of the doubtful
votes for ratification.
The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee did not consider Hawaii yester
day. To Postpone Action.
The fact that the committee did not
even discuss Hawaii indicates that the
friends of the islands are going to
postpone action for a short time. The
Senators in charge of the treaty have
concluded not to bring the matter up
until next week, although Senator
Davis intended to ask the Senate to
consider it yesterday. The delay is to
gain time so that the friends of the
treaty can work on the doubtful Sen
ators. It is also stated that many Republic
ans favoring the treaty think that if
by next week the two-thirds is not se
cured, it will be best to abandon the
treaty and take up the Morgan bill for
annexation. This bill was introduced
on June 23 and referred to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations. It ; pro
vides for annexation in the same man
ner as the treaty, and thus secures all
that could be gained by the ratification
of that agreement.
MURDERER'S NARROW ESCAPE
(Hi Attorneys Get a Writ of Error
Jnst in Time to Prevent Hanging.
Pittsburg. Dea. 9. Philip Hill, a ne
gro, was to have been hanged here
yesterday for the murder of George
Lawrence at Unity Camp on April 27.
He was not hanged, as a writ of er
ror was taken out by his attorneys, and
the Sheriff's attorney at 11.45 o'clock
lecided that it stayed the execution of
the sentence till after Oct. 1, 1893, when
the writ is returnable.
Hill's attorneys made a desperate ef
fort to And Gov. Hastings in time to
secure a respite for tho condemned
man. The Governor is in Hot Springs,
Va. The prisoner's mother sent a peti
tion to Harrisburg asking for a respite
of ninety days, that the case might be
laid before the State Board of Pardons
In an application for a commutation of
the sentence to imprisonment for life.
On learning that the Governor was in
Virginia, Hill's lawyers begged the
Sheriff to put off the hanging till la
o'clock, the legal limit. They went to
the jail at 10.10 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, however, and announced that they
had given up all hope ot reaching the
Governor.
EXCITEMENT IN HAYTI.
Public In Bitter Over the Goem
mcnt's Surrender to Germany-.
Port au Prince, Hayti, Dec. 9. Count
Schwerln, the German Minister, was re
ceived by the President yesterday p.f
ternoon. The public mind continues
agitated, and all the'regulars and the
National Guard are in readiness.
Shortly before 2 o'clock the President
Issued a proclamation to the people of
Hayti, saying that for the second time
Hayti had yielded to German force,
contrary to Its rights. The Govern
ment, according to the proclamation,
had declrVi-! t resist even to the last,
but ..' to the lack of promised
moral influence, the character of which
is not indicated In the proclamation. It
was obliged to accept the ultimatum.
The proclamation invites the Haytian
people to stop internal quarrellngs and
to labor for the raising up again of the
nation.
World's Gold Production.
Washington, Dec. 9. Mint Director
Preston's official estimate of the
world's production of gold for 1896 put?
the total at $203,000,000-, of which $53,
100,000 was from the United States. MY
Preston estimates the production foi
1897 at $238,000,000, of which the United
States will furnish $60,000,000.
CURRENCY REFORM.
Secretary Gage to Put His Bill Before
the Committee.
Washington, Dec 9. The House
Committee on Banking and Currency
held its first meeting yesterday and
outlined its general plan of action. In
view of Secretary Gage's recommenda
tion for a comprehensive revision of
currency and banking laws, a resolu
tion was adopted inviting the Secretary
to embody his views In a bill. The
committee was informed that the Sec
retary was now at work on a measure,
and that it would be available for the
committee in about a week.
Mr. Hill, of Connecticut, then precipi
tated a sharp debate by moving that
the committee act at once by reporting
to the House a bill embodying three of
the financial features which had the
President's approval. These were, em
bodied in a bill, heretofore offered by
Mr. Brosius, of Pennsylvania, and Mr.
Hill now proposed that the first three
sections be placed before the House
Immediately. The three sections pro
vided: Bank circulation up to the par
value of bonds deposited; reduction of
the tax on circulation to one-fourth of
one per cent.: the establishment of
small banks In rural communities. Mr.
Hill said that the committee would do
well not to go through the tedious
processes of considering ,and dividing
on these three propositions, which ap
peared to meet with general accept
ance, and had received executive ap
proval. Mr. Johnson, of Indiana, earnestly
opposed such hasty action.. He said
there should be time to hear from the
gentlemen forming the Monetary Com
mission and to weigh all propositions.
Precipitate action on such a vital sub
ject would, he said, seriously prejudiee
It before the House and the. country.
Mr. Mitchell,, of New York, also op
posed such speedy action. The debate
was proceeding- with animation when,
at 12 o'clock, the meeting went over, a
vote on the Hill motion not having
been reached.
The Walker Bill.
Chairman Walker announced four
sub-committees and assigned the bank
ing and currency bills introduced. The
sub-committees will begin work at once
on the bills before them. The Walker
sub-committee will have charge of the
Walker bill, which has attracted con
siderable attention In banking circles.
It proposes to introduce the New Eng
land Suffolk Bank system, adding a
government guaranty for all notes is
sued by banks, and imposing a small
tax on bank notes as a Bafety fund.
The bill of Mr. Hill also goes before
this committee. Mr. Hill Fays he has
endeavored to draw It on conservative
lines, meeting the financial ills which
most needed reform without going to a
radical .extent. He provides for an in
crease of bank circulation to the par
value of bonds deposited, , reduces the
taxation on circulation to one-fourth
of one per cent., provides for the es
tablishment of small anks in rural
communities and does away with the
restrictions on the free iBsue and with
drawal of National bank notes. Ex
cept in the last particular, the author
ot the bill feels that is he in line with
President 'McKinley's recent currency
recommendations. This sub-committee
will also deal with the bills of Repre
sentative Cox, the ranking Democrat
of the committee.
Snys Legislation la Unnecessary.
Washington, Dec 9. Some of the
leading House Republicans have con
cluded that legislation will not be
necessary to authorize the Secretary of
the Treasury to withhold from circula
tion, except when reissued for gold,
greenbacks that have been redeemed in
gold. Though the President asked for
legislation to authorize this course, it
is thought that he can do it Just as
well without authorization whenever
the revenue is sufficient.
A prominent Republican of the Ways
and Means Committee said that it was
probable that there would be no at
tempt to secure the legislation the
President suggested. Instead of that,
he said, the committee would probably
endeavor to secure the necessary rev
enue to enable the President to handle
the matter without any special author
ity from Congress.
Cotton Spinners' Waa-es) Go Down.
Fall River, Dec. 9. The Fall River
cotton manufacturers at ' a special
meeting held yesterday afternoon voted
to reduce the wages of the operatives.
The cut will not be less than 10 per
rent, and will affect about 25.000 em
ploye The cause of the reduction is
he depressed condition of the cotton
narket. which does not enable print
loth to be manufactured for the price
tow prevailing, whtoh is the lowest on
ecord.
For n Grester Foatomce.
Washington, Dec. 9. Postmaster
3-eneral Gary will wait for Congress to
take the first step In the matter of the
proposed consolidation of the post
afflces in Greater New York under one
head. .He has caused data bearing on
the feasibility of the scheme to be
gathered for the guidance of Congress,
and this will be transmitted to either
louse as soon as a resolution is adopt
ed calling for it.
Girl nnd 30,000 Mlsslnjr.
Atlantic City, N. J.. Dec. 9. Nothing
has yet been heard of Maggie Kirk
patrick, of Philadelphia, who disap
peared -om a boarding house here on
Sunday with $30,000 In Government
bonds sewed in her clothing. She Is
believed, however, to have gone to her
home. Since her 'brother's death in
April last the young woman has acted
strangely.
German Anll-Dnrglar Device.
Washington, Dec. 9. In a report to
the State Department from Leipsio.
Germany, United States Consul War
ner describes a novel German anti
burglar device. This consists of flexi
ble safety curtains made of hardened
steel tubes, properly connected, which
are invulnerable to the ordinary bur
glar's tools, for the reason that the
tubes revolve freely, and the centrebit
or other tool can find no purchase or
bold. -
MILLER STILL LEADS. ,
Plucky Cyclists Keep lTp the Strun-
Itle In the Six-Day Race.
New York, Dec. 9. Only eighteen of
the original contestants are lft in thfc
great six-day bicycle race at Madison
Square Garden. Miller is a far-and-away
leader of the big race. Rice, the '
Wilkesbarre favorite, is in second
place, but his rivals, Rivierre and
Schinneer, keep up their heart-breaklns
record and are crowding him closely,
for second position. 1 .
The marvelous work of Miller can
anly be fully appreciated when the fact
is considered that after fifty-nine hours
of riding he could take nine hours' rest
and still remain in advance ot the pre
vious world's records, for he had then
covered 1,02$ miles, whereas Schock'a
best on record for: sixty-eight hours
was only 1,022 miles. y
It may be interesting to note In con
nection with this contest that the , .
greatest distance ever covered by man
an foot in 142 hours is 6G2 miles. There '
seems every probability that with the
aid of the bicycle a record of little less
than four times this distance will be .
established.
Of all the eighteen men still left In .
the race only Gray, the colored youth,
and the Frenchman, Stephane, show .
the smallest signs of serious distress. .
Waller, who went all to pieces Tues- '
3ay, after capturing majiy records and.
setting the pace which has made this
race exceptional, waa out again last' '
night apparently ajj strong as ever. He
is still confident of being- in 'the van at
the finish.

Tine Barrj-Croot Affair.
London, Dec. 9. The Daily Chronlcli
editorially demands a thorough sifting
of the Barry-Croot affair. It admits
that the proceedings of the National
Sporting Club are "always conducted

difference between these fights and th
old-time prize fights. The Daily News,
whose editorial comments are in th
same strain, says: "We hope this great
scandal will put an end to the National
Sporting Club."
