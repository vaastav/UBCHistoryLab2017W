Wo gave on Tuesday n very fair eynop
mIs of the President's message, transmitted
by telegraph Monday night from the origi
nnl document and . not from bohemian
npecuIation. Wo give to-day an addition
a! anopsia embracing points not fully
given by telegraph. The message opens
as follows :
TothcSenutcandjromcofltpnrcscntativcK.
In transmitting to you this, my fourth
annual message, it is with thankfulness to
the diver of all good that, as a nation wo
nave ueen uiesseu lor me past year with
peace at home, peaco abroad, and a general
prosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples.
wiui uie exception 01 mo recent devas
tating flro which swept from the earth.
with a breath as it were, millions of nccu-
muiateu wealtli in tne city of Boston,
there has been no overshadowing ealamitv
within the year to record. It is cratifvlnir
to note how, like their fellow-citizeus of
tne city or Chicago, Under similar circum
stances a year earlier, tne citizens or JJos-
ton are rallying under tlieir misfortunes,
and the prospect that their energy and
perseverenco will overcome all obstacles.
aud show the same prosperity soon that
tney would nad no disaster belell tlicm.
Otherwise wo have been free from pesti
lence, war, and calamities which often
overtake nations; and us far as human
judgment can penetrate the future, no
cause seems to exist to threaten our pres
ent peace.
On the reduction of the public debt, the
President says :
The Treasurer's reports show a reduction
of the public debt from tho first of Match,
15G9, to tho present time, as follows :
From March 1, 1869,to March
1, 1870 $S7,134,7S2 84
From March 1, 1670, to
March 1, 1871 117,019,030 25
From March 1 , 1871 , to March
1,1872 94,895,34s 94
From March 1, 1672 to No-
vemberl, 1672, (Smonths) 04,047,237 84
Total $303,090,999 87
His policy for the Treasury Department
is thus tersely expressed :
The preservation of our national credit
is of the highest importance ; next in im
portance to this comes a solemn duty to
provide a national currency of fixed un
varying value as compared with gold, and as
soon as practicable, having due regard for
the interests of the debtor class and the
vicissitudes of trade and commerce, con
vertible into gold at par.
l'OST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Postmaster General
furnishes a full and satisfactory exhibit of
the operation of the Postofllce Department
during the year. The ordinary revenues
of tho Department for the fiscal year end
ed June 30, 1872, amounted to 21,915,
A'ld 37, and the expenditures to $20,058,
102 31. Compared with the previous fis
cal year tho increase of revenue was $1,
R7,380 95, or 9,37 per cent., and tho in
crease of expenditures $2,20S,0S8 93, or 9.29
per cent. Adding to the ordinary revenues
the annual appropriation of S700.0OO for
free matter, and tho amounts paid to tho
mbsidized mail steamship lines from spe
cial appropriations, tho deficiency paid out
of the general treasury was 53,317,705 94,
an excess of $389,707 20 over tho deficiency
for the year 1871. Other interesting sta
tistical information relating to our rapidly
extending postal service is furnished in
tuisreport. Tho total length of railroad
mail routes on the 30th of June, 1872, was
V7,911 miles, 8,077 additional miles of such
service having been put into operation
during tho year. Eight new lines of rail
way post ofilces have been established with
an aggregate length of 2,909 miles.
The number of letters exchanged in the
mails with foreign countries was 24.302.
500, an increase of 4,0G0,502, or twenty per
cent, over me numuenn mil, aim tne pos
tage thereon amounted to S1.S71.257 25
The total weight of tho mail exchanged
with European countries exceeded 820
tons. The cost of tho United States trons
Atlantio mail steamship service wasS220,
301 70. The total cost of the United States
ocean steamship service, including the
amounts paid to the subsidized lines of
mail steamerst was .i,o,oo 97.
SOBER WORDS FOB THE SOUTH.
In referring to the condition of the ku-
klux prisoners and the circumstances of
their trials, &c, he says :
I look with confidence to the time, not
far distant, when tho obvious advantages
of good order and peace will induce an
abandonment of all combinations prohibit
ed by the acts referred to, and when it will
be unnecessary to carry on prosecution or
innict punihiimenu to protect citizens
from the lawless doings of such combina
tions. Applications have been made to mo
to pardon persons convicted of u violation
of said acts, upon the ground that clemen
cy in such cases would tend to trannuillzn
the public mind and to test the virtue of
tnat policy. I am disposed, as far as my
sense of justice will permit, to give to
these applications a favorable considera
tion, but any action thereon is not to be
construed as indlw lag any change in my
determination to enforce with vigor such
ucvh so long as uio conspiraces and com
binations therein named disturb the peace
of the country. It is much to bo regretted,
nnd is regretted by no ono moro than my
self, that a necessity has ever existed to
execute the "enforcement act." No one
can desire moro than I that the necessity
of applying it may neveragain be demand
ed. INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
The attention of Congress will bo called
during its present session to varldus enter
prises for the moro certain and cheaper
transportation of the constantly increasing
surplus of Western and Southern products
to the Atlantlo seaboard. The subject is
one that will force itself upon tho legisla
tive branches of tho Government sooner or
later, and I suggest that immediate steps
be taken to gain all available Information
to insure equable and Just legislation.
One route to connect the Mississippi val
ley with tho Atlantic nt Charleston, S. C.
and Savannah, Ga., by water, by way o
tho Ohio aud Tennessee rivers, aud canals
and slack water navigation to tho Bavan
nah and Ocmulgco rivers has been survey
ed and report mauo oy an accompusued
engineer officer of tho army. Second and
third now routes will bo proposed to tho
consideration of Congress, namely, by tho
extension of the Kanawha and James riv
er caual to tho Ohio, and by tho extension
or me uncsapcnKc and unio canal.
I am not pscparcd to recommend Gov
crumcnt am to theso or other enterprises
until it is clearly shown that they are not
only or national interest, out tnat when
completed they will be of a value commen
surate witn tncir cost.
Referring to tho Secretary of tho Interi
ors suggestion for n national census in
1875. Ho says:
It would probubly obviate the con
stltutioiial provision regarding the decen
nial census, it a census taken in 1875
should bo divested of ull political character
nnd no re-appointment of Congressional
representation bo made under it. Such n
census, coming us it would in tho last year
of the first century of our national exis
tence, would furnish a nobio monument of
tne nrogress or tne united states during
mat century.
EDUCATION.
The rapidly increasing interest in educa
tion is a most encouraging feature in the
current history of tho country, and it is no
doubt true that this is due in a great meas
ure to tho cfibrts ot tho Bureau of Educa
tion. That office is continually receiving
evidences which abundantly nrovo its cf-
ncicncy lrom tne various institutions or
learning, and educators or all kinds
throughout the country.
'rue report ot tne commissioner contains
a vast amount of educational details of
great interest. Tho bill now pending be
fore Congress, providing for tho appropria
tion of tho nctt proceeds of tho sales of pub
lic lands for educational purposes, to aid
the States in the general education of their
rising generation, is a measure of such
great importance to our real progress, and
is so unanimously approved by the lead
ing friends of education, that I recommend
It to tho favorable attention of Congress.
TERRITORIES.
tVHhlrs In the Territories are generally
satisfactory. Tho energy and business ca
pacity or tne pioneers wno aro settling up
the vast domains not yet incorporated into
States are keeping paco in internal im
provements and civil government witn the
older communities.
THE INDIANS.
The policy which was adopted at tho be
ginning of tho administration with regard
to the management of Indians has been as
successfull as its most ardent friends antic
ipated within so short u time. It has re
duced the expense of their management,
decreased their forages upon tho white set
tlements, tended to glvo tne largest oppor
tunity to the extension of the great rail
ways through the public domain and push
ing or settlements into more remote dis
tricts of the country, and at tho same time
improve the condition of the Indians. The
policy will be maintained without any
change, excepting such as further experi
ence may show to be necessary to render it
mere eiiicient.
CIVII. SERVICE REFORM.
An earnest desire has been felt to correct
abuses which have grown up in tho civil
service of tho country through tho defec
tive method or making appointments to
office. The ofilces have been regarded too
much as the reward of political services.
Under tho authority of Congress rules have
been established to regulate tho terms of
office and tho mode of appointments. It
can't be expected that any system of rules
can bo entirely cfi'ectlve, and prove a per-
rect remedy ror tne existing evils until
they have been thoroughly tested by actual
practice, aud amended according to the re
quirements of the service. During 'my
term ot omco it snail uo my uest enueavor
to so apply the rules as to secure tho great
est twssib'le reform in tho civil service of
the Government, but it will require tho di
rect action of Congress to render tho en
forcement of tho system binding upen my
successors, and I hope that tho experience
of the past year, together With tho appro
priate legislation tiy congress may reacu a
satisfactory solution of this question, and
secure to tho public service for all time a
practical mctuod ot obtaining luitniui ami
efficient officers and employes.

Horace Maynard in Pennsylvania.
Mim.ersvili.iE, Lancaster Co., Pa.,
November 20, 1872.
Editors Chronicle : Allow me to en
dorse through your columns, Senator W.
G. Brownlow's suggestion that Hon.
Horace Maynard bo chosen Speaker of the
next House of Representatives. I can as
sure you that hero among "tho hardy sons
of toil," of Lancaster county, Pennsylva
nia me lormer constituents oi mo great
Thud. Stevens, and throughout tho whole
freedom-loving North, your able Congress
men is uo less appreciated, no less honored
and esteemed by all good mn, than ho is
ut ills own homo in Knoxville, Tenuessco.
Ho has buttled aud contended for the cause
of justice and equal rights in days when It
tried men's souis. it was not quite as
pleasant for a Southern loyalist to sit in
our National Congress, during the dark
days ot mo rebellion, as it was ror a .North
erner. Of tho few who represented sec
tions of the South, almost all wavered, and
most, us Andy Johnson did, faltered.
Some pretending loyalists and Republi
cans advocated measures, amnesty for In
stalled, and the like, in order to rcudor
their personal and social relations so much
more agreeable, and in order to bo called
more generous, more magnanimous, moro
sublime, and that sort of tiling.
Bravo noruco Maynard saw that the
path of duty and stem iustlco lav In a dif
ferent direction, and he almost alone of
our southern congressman followed It
without a murmur. And at the same time
ho was as generous, as liberal and as mag
nanimous as it wus proper to be. In the
most trying time of our country's peril,
when his fellow Congressmen of tho South,
waverlngly faltered, this great champion
of freedom, liberty and independence, jus
tice, truth, right and godliness. Hon.
Horace Maynard, alone stood firm, and to
him America owes the most crowning
uonors.
May God give to Knoxvillo another citi
zen, to Tennessee another Statesman, to
jMuijjiacnueeits anomerson, to me oppress
cd another friend, to the cause of Iustlco.
truth and right another advocate, to tho
American Union another patriot, and to
tho world another good man like Horaco
Maynard, nnd to our National Legislators
only so much commonsenseas to elect this
noble, ablo and faithful public servant
speaker ot mo next House or iicprescnta
tlvcs. John H. Landis.
