Perhaps it needed the Kaisers rebuff
to convince President Kruger that h s
mission In Europe was foredoomed to
failure hut the fact was apparent to the
rest of the world berorc he landed in
Prance At the time of the Battle of
Colenso Europe could have saved the
South African States hut it can da n th
ing now Great Britain is in the saddle
and must ride her folly out
That In subduing the little Boer Re
publics to her lust England has commit
ted a crime is known now to all man
Kind That the consequences will react
upon the criminal is as certain as the
moral law The Boers have lost their
homes England has lost her honor
The English made a strong case at the
beginning It seemed to many this Jour
nal among others that the contest was
one between British civilization and
Dutch savagery and that it would be
best for the Avorld if the former prevail
ed We were wrong for now the truth
is Known it is the English who appear
as the savages The Boers have been
robbed simply and in order that they
might be robbed thousands of them have
been murdered Eventually England will
pay the bill
President Kruger will not live long
enough we fear to sec the rehabilitation
of his people but he will not have long to
wait to sec the beginning of his revenge
His little army took the measure of Eng
lish troops and English generals for
which the world had long been waiting
lu the next war in which England en
gages he will see the knowledge ap
plied
In the meanwhile it is useless to ap
peal to nations which have time to con
sider only their selfish concerns
Oom Paul will fare no better in America
than he has fared in France and Ger
many But the day of his people will
come when their oppressor discredited
as a Christian nation and humiliated as
a military power receives the beating
which the hostile Powers of Europe now
know thanks to the Boer war they can
administer to her

Like Mr McKlnleys previous contribu
tions to the literature of his country his
Annual Message to Congress read in the
Senate and House yesterday is very nice
and very long It begins
At the outgoing of the old and the ineonlng
of tlic century jou begin the last session
of the nflv sixtli Congress with evidences on
every hand of Individual and national pros
iwnty and with proof of the crowing etnrcth
nl increasing power tor good of irepublican insti
tutions Your countrymen will Join with ou in
fiJkitation that American liberty is more flrmly
ablishcd than ever before and that love for
it and tlic determination to pretene it are more
imireral than at any former period of our lus
ior
The republic was never so ft onf lieeause
never so stroiicrl intrenched in the heart of
tlic people as now Tlic Constitution with few
amendment exists as it kit the hand of its
author The additions which base been mad- to
it proclaim larger freedom and more extended
One might wish that the President had
been a little more explicit on the subject
of the Constitution He is well able to
ehed light on a subject connected with it
concerning which he Is significantly silent
We refer to his Message of a year ago in
whieh he recognized that provision of the
Constitution which declares that all
duties imports and excises shall be uni
form throughout the United States and
warned Congress that our plain duty to
Porto Rico was to abolish all customs
taxes and admit the products of the
American island to other parts of the coun
try free of duty It is perhaps true as
ilr McKinley says that the Constitution
with few amendments exists as it left the
hands of its authors This might also be
said of the frigate of the same name
which however of late has been regarded
only as an ancifnt curiosity The old docu
ment is still a matter of interest to the
historian but of much less importance to
the practical politicians of the
era who while respecting It as a
means of promoting campaign objects or
for rhetorical purposes do not allow It to
stand in the way of their national or inter
national designs It has few amendments
of record amendments being quite super
fluous when the basic corpus Juris can be
ignored at the behest of the trusts de
fied in excluding It from Integral portions
of the United Slates or violated by the
waging of unauthorized executive foreign
war of Invasion The American people
perhaps are as yet unable to realize how
instltutional changes and resolutions in
the character of their government may be
effected without alteration of outwaid
forms
As we reviewed the Message In detail
yesterday we shall on this occasion only
attempt to discuss Its more Important
and interesting features Mr McKinley
follows bis introductory remarks with a
historical and critical essay on the Boxer
movement in China and of the disturb
ances and war which resulted He goes
at length into the causes which in his
opinion led to the outbreak and tells
Congress how he sought to avert tho in
evitable by securing from the Powers a
definition of their intentions which he
felt sure would satisfy the Chinese that
we were their friends and so placate
them In furtherance of this emollient
IKjllcy our legation guard which had
been sent to iekn in the autumn of 1859
Jwas wllhdrawn and all differences left to
lie settled by tho ordinary methods of
diplomacy The intention no doubt was
excellent but the action only inflamed
the sanity of the Chinese and made them
Iwlleve that we were afraid of them The
blunder of January 1800 was bitterly
paid for In the attack upon the legations
and he sickening horrors of the torture
and mass acre of American women and
children a few months later 3Ir McKin
JvJ cites a stirring and fair account of
the succeeding events cf the landing at
Taku the Battle of Tientsin the defeat
of the Seymour McCalla relief coluain
and of the final relief of the legations He
charges the imperial authorities with
failure to protect the diplomats and
hold- them responsible for the death and
suffering they caused
Up to this point the Message is clear
but then ceases to be brilliantly illumi
nating on the subject of cur policy and
course in China It refers to Mr Hays
note or July 3 in which the Administra
tion disclaimed any idea of being at war
with the Chinese people If any other
slew of the matter had been taken and
the fact that a stale of war existed be
tween this country and China had been
admitted the President might not have
ventured to longer depart from his plain
duty of calling Congress in extraordi
nary session to secure its endorsement
of his executive war in Asia As soin
says Mr McKinley as the sacred duty
cf relieving our legation and dependents
was accomplished we withdrew from ac
tive hostilities and from the Empire
leaving our legation under an adequate
guard p Pekin This as readers of the
Message will note is the sole leference
to an incident which at the time of its
occurrence was heralded throughout the
country as a monument to the splendid
diplomacy of the amateurs who walled
with their ccs open into Ihc neat trap
arranged for them by the Russian Charge
dAfTaires M do Wollant accepted the
Russian proposal for a cut and scuttle
without liotiee to the other Powers and
so broke the concord at Pekin The
President again gives utterance to his
well known views on the sulijeel of easy
terms for the criing and is sliocgly in
clined to favor arbitration through The
Hague tribunal in cane a basis of settle
ment cannot be speedily reached other
wise
The American people had naturally been
looking for a strong pronouncement from
Mr JUKInley on the topic of the South
African war Considering the annoving
and hectoring altitude assumed by Great
Britain in respect of our paramount rights
as the chief nation of the Western Hemi
sphere the scarcely veiled threats of the
British Government to resist the exercise
of rights on our part under the Monroe
Doctrine and its violent seizure of Amer
ican territory in Alaska condoned it is
true through Administration timidity
there was no particular reason why undue
caution should ba used in the message lo
please the Administration ally Yet we
look in vain for a sentence or a word of
sjmpathy for the gallant jwople of the two
South African Republics whose liberties
have been extinguished and whose bonus
have been demolished by Englands ruth
less hand Mr McKinley disposes of tho
whole subject in two short paragraphs in
which he says that o ir friendly relations
with Great Britain continue and that in
consequence of the war in South Africa
vexatious questions aroe through Gieat
Britains action in respect to neutral car
goes cot contraband in their our nature
shipped to Portuguese South Africa on the
score of probable or suspected ultimate
destination to the Beer Slates These
vexatious questions were amicably and
satisfactorily settled and the Message
proceeds to the consideration of other
things more agreeable to remember
But the one immcdiately succeeding can
hardly be of that class It is the subject
of the modus vivendi under which the
Canadians were allowed to annex lha
American Porcupine district in Alaska
which they had impudently and totally
without variant invaded and seized erect
ing their custom houses on American soil
and forcing American goods to pay tribute
and American miners license to their Gov
ernment This transaetiun was enc in
which it was in effect agieed that the
British should be left undisturbed in the
stolen territory that the Stars and Stripes
should be hauled down and the British
ensign hoisted and that the district should
henceforth be known as the Porcupine
district of the liritlfh Northwest Terri
tory as it is now oflieljlly described The
Message treats he delicate matter as it it
were very thin ice and skims over it as
quickly as possible It Is referred to 33
tho work cf mat king certain provisional
boundary points for convenience of ad
ministration around the head of Lynn
Canal in accordance with the temporary
arrangement of October ln The
icJus vivendi says Mr McKinley has
ro far worked without friclicn It ought
to In a case where England is allowed
everything she seized and the United
States supinely surrendered eveiytLiag de
manded
On the subject of the currency the
Presidenl congratuliles the country upon
a vast ineieasc in the number and circula
tion of national banks At some future
day when they gel word from Wall Street
and suddenly contract their circulation
perhaps that too may be ground for exe
cutive felicitation Additional legislation
is recommended to secure and fasten th
gold standard We hardly Knuw whether
this will please the Republican leaders
In the recent campaign they gathered in
a great deal of easy money from the trusts
aud financial combinations on tlic pica
that monometallism was in danger on ac
count of defective laws To make tlic
statutes in this connection insurmountable
might deprive them of a useful club
If Mr McKinley only recommends a
small reduction in war taxes amounting
to thirty million dollars- it must be re
membered that the surplus In the Treas
ury and likely to increase during the next
year under nonnal conditions will nearly
all be needed to pay campaign debts and
supply flic constantly expanding demands
of the Government The River and Har
bor bill 13 good for twenty five millions
the Panama syndicate has its glitteriug
eye on nobody knows how many more and
the Hanna subsidy Job must be provided
for at the rate of nine million dollars an
nually for ten years Hence in the mat
ter of reducing taxation it Is plain that
the Administration would make haste
slowly
A wise cccnomy in the use of public
funds Mr McKiulcy thinks demands
that Congress should pass the Subsidy
bill immediately It will take ninety
million dollars from the taxpayers and
salt that sum down In the pockets of a
dozen transportation magnates thereby
reviving our decayed merchant marine
Upon this topic the President appears
actually in earnest and almost insistent
As for the trusts ho has an Idea thai
what is needed is homogeneous State leg
islation He recalls the luminous lan
guage of his famous plain duty message
of last year in which be said that he
hoped means might be found for the
Congress within the limitations of its
constitutional power so to supplement an
effective code of State legislation as to
make a complete system of laws through
out the United Stales adequate to compel
a general observance of the salutary rules
to which I have referred
With that gem of thought we give
over it in ilr IcKlnlcyg mlsfortuu

that he seems to think it necessary to
embody In his messages a vast amount of
chiironerlo which might better be made
into an appendixor left lo be considered
by Congress in tho departmental reports
On account of his diffuscness and a ten
dency at times to smother argument and
suggestion in words he is an author of
State papers not by any means as widely
read or understood as his friends and ad
mirers could wish

The London Saturday Roview said in
a recent issue Whatever we Great
Britain have gained by the presence of
Mr Hay at the State Department may be
lost In the event of his departure it Is a
purely personal asset
Nothing could exceed the frankness of
this avowal and nothing could exceed Its
truth The American author of the Hay
Paunccfote Treaty Is unquestionably the
best friend England has in the United
States to lay Ho can do no work for
America in London comparable to the
work he has done and is doing for Eng
land in Washington
In the old days an American Secretary
of State would not have been maintained
in office on account of his usefulness to a
foreign Power especially with thai Power
England It Is different now The British
press led by the London Times almost
unanimously supported the re election of
Mr McKinley and they have nothing but
compliments for him now
Great Britain no less than the United
States will benefit from the continuance in
the Presidency of Mr McKinley said
Money the other day and the London
Stanlard added Englishmen have every
reason lo be satisfied for with Mr McKin
ley and the Republicans there 3 a much
clearer prospect of strengthened amity
and of common purpose than there would
have been with Mr Bryan and the Demo
crats
This is all true The financial Influences
which now control both Governments
would be nt peace with each other for all
time It is only necessary that the
youuger nation should understand that In
all cases of divided interest it must give
in lo its elder and the Job is done
Hurrah then for the Hay Pauncefote
Treaty and the new alliance with our
friends and benefactors of 1776 1812 and

The New York Sun views the reas
sembling of the Fifty sixth Congress with
ill concealed alarm This is judicious In
spite cf the fact that a3 a Republican or
gan it is only four years old the Sun
knows Its party thoroughly
Republican discipline is like that which
prevails in Tammany Hall The rank and
file obey the leaders to a man It it was
so in the dark days of Clevelands second
term what shall be said now when the
manna of Hanna Is about to fall on the
captains of tens of hundreds and of thou
sands on tho head of every Republican
member of Congress and his wife his serv
ant his ass and all who have influence
with him
The Treasury is wide open for two years
and three months Let there be loot
says Hanna and verily thero will be loot
Mr McKinley has a soft spot in his
heart for poor erring Spain In his mes
sage he says I feel that we should not
suffer to pass any opportunity to reaffirm
the cordial ties that existed between us
and Spain from the time of our earliest
Independence Considering how Spain in
those early days strove to shut the young
Republic out from the navigation of the
Mississippi and made herself an uncom
fortable neighbor generally also liow she
loved and used us to help her crush lib
erty In Cuba up to the time when the
Maine treachery brought matters to a
head these unbroken relations of affec
tion can hardly be recalled without bring
ing tears in their train
In his message Mr McKinley makes one
recommendation which will meet with
general approval He urges Congress to
confer upon Federal courts Jurisdiction in
cases shere outrages are committed
against subjects of foreign Gosernments
domiciled within the United States When
it is remembered that we hold other
States responsible for wrong done to our
citizens within their territories and here
tofore have denied such responsibility on
their own part it Is ralher evident that
something ought to be done about the mat

CAPITOL NOTES AND GOSSIP
Mr CramiinckerH BUI Representa
tive Crunipacker of Indiana has introduced
In the Hcupc a reapportionment bill upon
which he has devoted much work and
through which he has ingeniously devised
a scheme that would cut down the repre
sentation of the South without interfering
with Republican supremacy in any State
tint is now held by that party Indeed
the Crumpacker bill would give the Re
publicans a lead in the electoral college
which astute Democrats say would not be
overcome for several generations unless
some egregious blunder should be commit
ted by Mr McKinley or whoever of his
party should succeed him in the White
House It is evident that tho Republican
managers are much enamored cf the
Crumpacker idea the central feature of
which is the reduction of Southern repre
sentation to the basis of tho vote Instead
of the population But it U also evident
that Mr Crumpackers party managers are
not going to accept his bill Their prin
cipal reason for rejecting it obviously is
not that they do not want to attain the
mam object sought by Mr Crumpacker
the lessening of the Southern strength in
the electoral college but that they are
pcfcctly willing to permit the black men
of the South to be disfranchised In order
to have a precedent when the day comes
to deal with the suffrage question in the
new Insular possessions That is the way
at any ratethe subject Is discussed by
the Republican leaders big and little In
the conllilence of private conversation Mr
Crumpackcr3 bill would increase the
membership of the House from 317 to 363
abcit the smallest increase that has ever
beel made under any scheme of reappor
tionment If this bill should become a law
the following changes in representation
would occur Arkansas from six to seven
California from seven to eight Colorado
from two to three Illinois from twenty
two to twenty four Louisiana from six to
two Massachusetts from thirteen to four
teen Minnesota from seven to nine Mis
sissippi from seven to three Nebraska
from six to five New Jersey from eight
to ten New York from thirty four to
thirty seven North Carolina from nine
to four Pennsylvania from twenty eight
to thirty two South Carolina from seven
to three Texas from thirteen to fifteen
Virginia from ten to nine Washington
from two to three West Virginia from
four to Ave It will he observed that the
only absolutely safe Democratic States
that would share in the benefits of tho In
creased representation proposed by Mr
Crumpacker arc Arkansas and Texas
whereas the only heavy cuts that are pro
vided for are wholly in the safe Demo
cratic Stales
llnnnn mill IMntt lMnj fill During
the recess of the Senate yesterday await
ing the Presidents message the crowded
galleries feasted their eyes and surfeited
their admiration upon a spectacle on the
floor that perhaps will rank In history
among the most notable events of the
closing century In the very centre of
tbc Republican side of the Chamber the
Hon Marcus Alonzo Hunna and the Hon
Thomas Collier Piatt sat as close to
gether as their chairs would permit and
for fully a half hour indulged In sweet
conversational dalliance that evidently
was as edifying to one as the other The
carking cares of state obviouly were not
fretting the soul of either of them for
every few moments Mr Hanna would lean
back In his chair while his pudgy form
shook with merriment Several times
Mr Piatt as if emphasizing the point of
a jokelet pinched Mr Hanna squareiy
upon his rheumatic knee and Instead of
wincing or frowning Mr Hanna laughed
and lolled around in his chair as if he
verily was in a fit of merriment When
Mr Hannas turn came to tell a joke he
edged close up to Mr Piatt and encir
cling that statesmans slender neck with
the left arm held him as in a rise until
the story was told and the New Yorker
had ceased to chuckle Id give a thou
sand dollars or one of the stories Hanna
and Piatt have told each other excitedly
declared one of the numerous special
commissioners of the yellow journals who
nave come to town to start things off
right and who watched the two great
men at their anlics until he almost buret
open with qxcitcment At last accounts
an army of cager9reporters were pursuing
both Mr Hanna and Mr Piatt in the
vain endeavor to extract from them bits
of the funny stories with which they had
regaled themselves and sharpened to a
razor edge the curiosity of the crowded
galleries
M r Iettil a Goml IlNener The

prcs3 gallery bocause his speech bears
out his looks of sage and philosopher iis
tened longer and with more respect to the
official reading of the Presidential mes
sage than did any other of the seventj
six million or mure American citizens
This statement is made advisedly When
the hour arrived for the delivery of the
message not more than a third of thq
seats in the Senate chamber were occu
pied Announcement of tho reception of
the message acted almost like tho state
ment of the Chair that the Senate does
now stand adjourned The Clerks mo
notonous drone was soon drowned b the
shuflling of feet But not the shutTling of
Senator Pettus feet With great delib
eration and dignity he settled back in ills
chair carefully tuekeel his whiskers in
side of Ills vest rested his chin upon Ills
bosom ami listened Several times it ap
peared that he was about to rise and in
terrupt the reaellng with a motion but in
steuel he only mopped his mouth and brow
with a liHgo red baudana ami settled back
again to listen some mole For one hour
and twenty minutes by the watch did
Senator Pettus give careful heed lo the
leading of the document Once or twice
his nearest seal mate Senator CocKreli
who is alwajs busy looking over papers
touched him on the elbow as if to ask a
question but Senator Pettus would not be
inlerruptcd and majestically waved the
Missoitrian away Finally he seemed lu
iet enough and then tucking the reel ban
dana In a tall pocket of bia long coat he
strode into the Democratic cloak room
and was seen to push the glass door open
several limes and listen some more to the
leading of the message

The time will come but when I can
not tell when Senators wilt be elected by
a direct vote of the people tho same as
Representatives said Representative
David H Smith of Kentucky at the
Raleigh last night Last session tho
House passed niy bill providing for the
election of Senators by the people said
he but the Senate as on previous oc
casions sidetracked the measure How
ever the upper branch of Congress I be
lieve will yet yield to popular sentiment
and agree to a bill changing the present
mode of electing Senators so that the peo
ple can vote for a Senator the same as
for a Representative You know con
tinued Mr Smith that in several of the
States notably South Carolina and Texas
the popular vote really does elect the Sen
ator because the question of election is
first decided by a primary When Senators
are elected by a direct vote of the people
then and only then will corruption and
bribery be relegated to the rear

If Nason Barry of Boston is registered
at the Arlington Mr Barry is a pro

erties and recently closed a deal by which
several of the large gold mining com
panies in the West were consolidated
Mr Barry cays English and Herman cap
italists have their eyes on several rich
gold mines in the West and that a big
transfer of valuable property is 30011 to
take place The United States ho says
has the largest available supply of gold
in the world and this fact has really
alarmed Europe It the output of gold
of our mines continues said Mr Barry
and I know It will the result will be an
Intimation from the foreign capitals that
perhaps it would be a good thing to re
store pimctallism
There isone bill Congress ought to
pas3 in which my constituents are special
ly interested said Representative Gayle
of Kentucky at tho Raleigh yestcrelay
and that is the Boreing bill to divide
Kentucky into two judicial districts Tor
a number of years bills have been intro
duced in botli Houses of Congress with
this object in view The Federal business
warrants the division but local jealousies
have had more or less to do with the fail
ure of Congress to act In the matter
Some time a bill for this purpose would be
favorably reported from the Judiciary
Committee It would get on the calendar
and there it would die If the opportunity
presents itcelf this session I shall do my
be3t to get action on the Boreing hill now
pending The passage of the bill would
give President McKinley the appolntmest
of an additional judge a United States
District Attorney and an assistant a
marshal and an assistant and several
minor officials Therefore I think the

njpst lonesome section of the universe that
I ever struck remarked Luther Dyson
of New Orleans at Wlllards last night
I stopped for a few days on a ranch ii
that country and dont want to repeat the
experience The nearest postofilce wa3
eighty miles from the ranch The climate
is eo dry that one cannot even absorb an
idea The natives are a rough greasy lot
ready to fight at the drop of the hat and
sant to drop it themselves I am thankful
1 had money when I struck the place or I
would have been counting railroad ties
back to my happy home There is not a

W C Eta of Indianapolis Ind a spe

that the rural free delivery idea has caught

a great succjs It gives each granger a

are eagerly taking advantage of the oppor
tunity
I was talking with a gentleman from
Charleston S C and he tells me that the
buzzards act as scavengers in that city but
his story is not a marker to one I can tell
said Henry Turney of New York who
registered at the Shoreham last night I
lived In Constantinople for a great many
vears and as you know the Turk is a
very kind tort of being He worships the
dog nearly as much as he dors his life
Vnd this Is the reason The dogs of Con
stantinople act as scavengers for that city
There are from forty to sixty dogs in each
square These dogs have a leader They
are clannish Each pack has its own
fouare The Turk eniptle3 his rubbish into
the street and the clogs lose no time put
ting it olt of signt Should one dog leave
the square and cross to the opposiie pack
it is at once killed The degs appear to
have a hatred for every dog not beioaging
to their particular set The Turkish Gov
ernment in colel weather provides for the
maintenance of the animals Should a
stranger Mil one of the dog3 he would be
mobb d A heavy flue is also Imposed for
any injury inflicted upon the animals ThH
stste of affairs has existed for a great
lrruv ycarr am will probably remain so
until the end of Turkish history
We have three candidates who want to

AT THE THEATRES
National Way TlnTrn Et
Redolent with heart Interest replete
with clean wholesome comedy and pre
sented with a natural and splendid scenic
investiture Way Down East which
greeted its many friends at the New Na
tional last evening may Justly be ac
credited the first rank in the list of pastoral
plays Excellent as was Us presentation
upon previous visits to the National Capi
tal Ibis seasons is still more elaborate
and true to life Way Down East ful
fills the great essential of a perfect play
one wishes to sec it again and again and
with each reseeing and rehearing flnd3
new beauties and more poetry of lan
guage thought and action
The year that has elapsed since its last
Washington presentation has seen the de
velopment of a new class of theatregoers
and too many persons who properly
eschew the ordinary clap trap of comedy
and romantic drama will find in thls beau
tiful pastoral play a sermon equal to that
of the greatest divine the Ics3in of hu
man charity and forgiveness mingled with
the old heart story of love despite differ
ence ot rank Numbered in the audience
of last evening were fully two core of
local clergymen of all denominations and
creeils Nor wa3 their appreciation less
sincere their Iauehter less forced or their I

was highly enjoyed by the audiences a

Williams and Tuckers sketch Skinaya
Finish which has been seen locally on a
previous occasion makes a great hit and
serves to increase the popularity of tho
artists James J Morton who used to
work with Maud Revelle has a monologus
that is really good and would be ever so
much better if he paid a little attention
to the grammatical end of it As at pres
ent constituted Mr Morten may be said

field Alice Pierce appeared under the most
unfavorable of circumstances and yet wan
much applause for her decidedly good Imi

MacDonald and Mrs Carter She Is a
pretty miss with much more than ordinary
talent as an Imitatrlx and had she not
been so handicaped by reason of her lato

the substantial hits of the performance
Cawthorne and Forrester are seen In a
sketch A Damage Suit which allows
Miss Forrester to sing several coon songs
exceedingly well and act a3 a target for
Mr Cawthornes merry little quips regard

form of humor but succeeds in getting
laughs which of course is the desired re-
tears less human than those of the habitual I suit Maud Meredith sing3 a good clasj of
theatregoer who finds in the Blmple love songs well enough to win a large share of
story of Anna Moore and David Bartiett I commendation Smith Doty and Cole fur
that essential of enjoyment for which he nisb n gcod musical act that has the merit
has so often vainly sought in more pre
tentious offerings This is the secret of
the success of the Parker Crismer drama
it appeals to all classes the studious and
the frivolous the old and the young the
sentimental and the cynical with equal
power and effect It is undoubtedly the
greatest of recent pastoral dramas and the
grandchildren of the present generation of
theatregoers will find In it the same beau
tics which are discovered today
Another notable difference in the drama
under consideration and ethers of its Ilk
is in the company presenting it Seldom
has a better ensemble been seen locally
than that presenting Way Down East
lron the smallest to the largest the parts
are filled with people who as far as ap
pearances go might have been transported
bodily from the New England woods with
the atmosphere of the firs and pines and
hemiocks clinging to their queer- fash
ioned garments From Hi Holler the chore
boy to Mrs Bartiett the very human
mother the actors are the personification
cf 5ing original and Kelly and Ashby
close the bill with an acrobatic perform
ance that is sensational enough lo cause
the audience- much worry ns to the safety
of tho actors necks during their aerial
flights above a bounding billiard table

The
Columbia Le Voyage ra
sjuic
The Columbia Theatre resorted to the
pantomimic form of theatrical entertain
ment last night and to say that the large
andience enjoyed Le Voyage en Suisse
would be putting it very mildly This
somewhat primitive type ot dramatic
composition proved to be as potent as on
the occasion of its previous presentations
in Washington a number of years ago
The evident Intention of the present
promoters of the piece is to provide a
plentiful supply of clean enjoyable fun
and In this endeavor they have done even
better perhaps than they planned No
one in viewing this one time Hanlon play
objects to tho introduction of the time
honored slapstick as a means of produc
ing laughter Here It very properly be
longs and had the Columbias audience
of last night missed thls particular type
of innocent fun there would undoubtedly
have been a great deal of disappointment
As it was there was nothing about the
performance that could cause a feeling of
thwarted expectation
Le Voyage en Suisse boasts of a plot
and a better one than is possessed by
many more pretentious pieces It con
cerns the effort to separate an aged gen
tleman named Dwlndledown from his re
cently made wife for the purposes of the
play it is made to appear that he has
won his bride by fraudulent means This
is sufficient excuse to introduce a party
of well intentioned young men and women
who form a sort of rescuing band to carry
off the youthful Mrs Dwlndledown In
this kidnaping expedition it is necessary
to pursue the Dwlndledovvns on their
bridal tour through Switzerland and this
allows two clownish servants John and
Hob much opportunity for untiring blun
elering creating no end of ridiculous sit
uations and mirthful mishaps There are
a number of excellently done climaxes
notably a railroad collision and an aval
aneh scene
The mauagement has done much com
mendable work in reviving Le Voyage en
Suisse V quantity of scenery of the
sort that the ilrulans made familiar has
been provided while the company is capa
ble of giving a pleasing performance Two
better paiitoruiuiist than Charles Kuyer
and William would be hard to
imagine Their work is capitally done and
even their oldest tricks take the house by
tonn Several ileal specialties are in
troduced during the hi - act and If prc
icntesl oil regular vaudeville bill any
ou of them would b accepted as worthy
of high tdii Mlesc Crater remembered

number of the Parry Opera Company at
