declaration that. aliens coming to
American shores must respect Amer

A.S'lil.ViJTON, Dec. 8.?President
Harding, in his legislative message
to Congress today, said:
Members of the Congress:
So many problems are enlllng for |
solution that a recital of nil of them. ,
in the face of the known limitations'
of a short session of Congress would
seem t'i lack sincerity of purpose. It
is four years since the World War
ended, but the inevitable readjust
ment of the social and economic i
order is-not more than barely begssti.
There is no acceptance of pre-war
conditions anywhere in the world.
In a very general way humanity
harbors Individual wishes to go on
with war-time compensation for pro
duction, with pre-war requirements
in expenditure. In short, every one,
speaking broadly, craves readjust
ment for everybody except himself,
while there can be no ? just and
permanent readjustment except when
all participate.
?trough! To It fill Tent.
i tie civilization which measured
its strength of genius and the power
of science ami the resources of in
dustries. in addition to testing the
limits of man power and the endur
ance and heroism of men and wo
men?that siime civilization Is
brought to Its severest test in re
storing a tranquil order and commit
ting humanity to the stable ways of
j peace.
If the sober and deliberate ap
praisal of pre-war civilization makes
it seem a worthwhile Inheritance,
then wltls patience and good cour
age It will be preserved. There never
again will he precisely the old order;
indeed. 1 know of no one who thinks
it to he desirnhle. Kor out of the
old order came the war itself, and the
new order, established and made
secure, never will permit its recur
rence.
It is r.o figure of speech to say we.
have come to the test of our civiliza
tion. The world has been passing?
is today passing?through a great
crisis. The conduct of war itself js"
not more difficult than tho solu
tion of th*? problems which necessari
ly follow.' 1 am not speaking at this
moment of the problem in its wider
aspect of world rehabilitation or of
international relationships. The re
ference is to our own social, financial
and economic problem at home. These
things are not to be considered solely
as problems apart from all interna
tional relationship, but every na
tion must be able to carry on for it
self, else its international relation*
ship will have scant importance.
Strike* llnltrd I'rngrrns,
. . . Had we- escaped the coal and
railway strikes, which had no excuse !
/or their being and Ios.h Justification
for their delayed settlement, we
should have done infinitely better.
Hut labor was insistent on holding
to the war heights, mid heedless
forces of reaction sought the pre
war levels, and both were wrong.
The railway strike accentuated tho
difficulty of tin- American farmer.
*1 he first distress of readjustment
came lo the farmer, and It will not
be a readjustment fit to abide until
lie is relieved. The distress brought
to the farmer does not affect him
alone. Agricultural ill fortune Is a
national HI fortune. That one-fourth
of our population which produces tho
fooil of the republic and adds so
largely to our export commerce must
participate in tho good fortunes of
tbo nation, elso thero Is none worth
retaining.
Agriculturo In a vital activity in

. . . The Farm Lnbor Itureau
already hau proven Its usefulness
through farm production credits as
well as enlarged land credits. It is
< ntlrely practical to crcato a divi
sion In tho Federal land bank to
deal with production credits, with
the limitations of time so udjusted

permanent and deserved ngricul

ter and cheaper transportation.
Here is >iu outstanding problem de
manding the most rigorous considera
tion. ... In the. last half of the
year now closing the railways. btoken
In carrying capacity because of mo
tive |>ower and rolling stock out of
order, though Insistently declaring
to the contrary, embargoed his ship
ments or denied him cars when for
tunate markets were calling. Too
frequently transportation failed,
while perishable products were turn
ing from possible profit t to losses
counted in tens of millions.
I know of no problem exceeding In
Importance this one of transporta
tion. In our complex and Interde
I endent mode of life transpoHation
Ih essential to our very existence. . .
Manifestly, we have need to begin
on plans to co-ordinate all transpor
tation facilities. We should more
effectively connect up our rail lines
with our carriers by sea. We ought
to reap some benefit from the hun
dreds of millions 'expended on In
land waterways, proving our capac
ity to utilise as well as expend. Wo
ought to turn the motor truck Into
a railway feeder and distributor In
stead of a destroying competitor.
It would be folly to Ignore that
wo live in a motor age. The motor
car reflects our standard of living
and gauges the speed of our pres
ent-day life. it long ago ran down
Simple I jiving and never halted to
Inquire about the prostrate figure
which fell as Its victim. With full
recognition of motor car transporta
tion we must turn it to lite most
practical use.
Cn?t* Must t ome llown.
This transportation problem can
not be waved aside. The demand for
lower cost on farm products nnd
basic materials cannot bo Ignored.
Hates horizontally increased, to meet
increased wage outlays during the
war Inflation are not easily reduced.
When some very moderate wage re
ductions were effected last summer
with a R per cent horizontal reduc
tion In rates. 1 sought at that time.
In a very informal way, to have the
railway managers go before the In
terstate Commerce Commission and
agree to a heavier reduction on farm
products and coal and other basic
commodities, and leave unchanged
the freight tariffs which a very largo
portion of the traffic was able to
bear.
Neither the managers nor the com
mission i-aV lit to adopt the sugges
tion so we had the horizontal reduc
tion, too Sllsht to be felt by the
higher class cargocs and too little
lo benefit the heavy tonnage calling
most loudly for relict, ?
Government operation does not af
ford the cure. It was government
operation which brought us to the
very order of things against which
we now rebel, and we are liquidating
the costs of that supreme folly.
Surely, the genius of tho railway
builders has not become extinct

Is maintained throughout hearings
and In decisions handed down. . . .
Only the public group of three is free
to function in unbiased decisions.
Therefor**, the partisan i]?ombershlp
may well be abolished, and decisions
should be made by an impartial tri
