PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE i
(Continued From P-gre One.)
1521. The congress might well consider
whether the higher rates of Income'
and profits tuxes can in peace times,
be effectively productive of revenue and,
whether they can not, on the contrary.'
be destructive of business activity and
productive of waste and inefficiency.
There is a point at which in peace tim-s
high rates of income and profits taxes
discourage energy, remove the incen
tive to new enterprise, encourage ex
travagant expenditures and produce
industrial stagnation with consequent!
unemployment and other attendant du
ties.
The problem is rot an easy one. A,
fundamental change has taken piaoo i
with reference t-> position ?>f America
in the world's affairs. The prejudice
and passions endang- r--d by ?!? cades of
controversy between two schools of pol
itical and economic thought, one be
lievers in protection of American indus
tries. tin- i thor believers in tariff for
revenue only?must be subordinated to
the single consideration of tin- public
interest -n tin- light of utterly concern
ed conditions. i'efore the war American
was heavily th- debtor of the r-st of
the world and tV- interest p-iym-nt* in
had to tusk-- to f-reign countries on Am
erican securities held abroad, the ex

Th--r? are other matters of importance ' (
I upon which T urged fiction at tin- last
session of congress which arc ^t. 11 pr? ss

| neci ssary for in*1 again i" remind you'
rh.it Ihero is one immediate and very
practicable question result.ng from the
war whi'h we should Intel in t.no most,
liberal spirit. It is a matter of r?c.g
tiitin and relief to our soldiers. 1 can
d > no better than to <ini te fr< m ?ny last
message urging this very action. f
"We must see to it that "ur returned '
soldiers are assisted in ever> prn.tieablc
way to find the pines for which they
are tltted iti tie- daily work of the
country. This Can be done by develop
ing and maintaining upon an adequate
scale the admirable organization created
by the department of labor ror pfacing
men seeking work: and it can also be
done, in at least one very great Held, by
creating new opportunities for indi
vidual enterprise. The Sectetary of the
inferior has pointed ?ait the way by
which returning soldiers may bo helped
to find and take up land in the hitherto;
undeveloped regions of the country
which the federal government has J
already prepared or can readily prepare
for cultivation and who on many of the '
cut-over or neglected areas which lie
within the limits of the older states: nnd ;
1 once more take the liberty of recorn- j
mending very urgently that Ins plans,
shall receive the immediate and substan-;
tial support of congress."
In the matt?r of tariff legislation I
b. g t.j call your attention t v the statr
iiei.ts contained in my last message
urging legislation with reference to the
estimate of the eh< tnicul and dyestuff
industry irt America:
Among the industries to which special
c-'tis.delation should be given is that
of the muuuf.u tu:<- of uyestuiVs and re
lat' d ehi nuc.als. Our complete depeild

the continuance of federal participa

the di-.- tion of present agencies: th"
need of further action on the part or
the states and the federal government

With the return to normal conditions
his unrest will rapidly disappear. In
he tricantttne it docs much evil, it
? ?cms to tun that ill dealing with this
situation congress should not be impot

o remove the causes. It should endea
ror to bring our country back speedily
o a peace basis, with ameliorated living

strict mns upon personal liberty that is
? insistent wi'h ">ir rccniistructioii prob

fovernnient with powej to dial in its
mutual courts with these persons who
iy viob nt in* tin ids would abrogate our
inie-tested inslitulions. With th" free
xprcssicn of opinion and with the ad

ever fundamental, there must be no in
erfereiicc. but towards passion and mnl
?vob tice tending to incite crime and in
surrection under guise of political evol

slillotl to -this end has been recoiu

pglslative measures which would be ef- :
