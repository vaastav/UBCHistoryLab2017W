ROOSEVELT’S
LAST MESSAGE
Makes Annual Recommenda
tions to Congress,
ATTACKS ANTI-TRUST LAW
Would Curb the Truete. But Says the
Sherman Act Should Be Amended to
Permit Combinations Which Are In
the Interest of the Public—Currency
System Defective.
Washington. Dec 9 Morn than "r
(llnnry Interest was evinced In the l;\~t
regular message of President li •■;,•
velt to congress before his retirement
from office next March, which was
road simultaneously in the senate and
bouse
The document, which was temperate
In tone and about 20,0011 word* in
length, reiterated the president's poll
cies eoneerniug corporations and other
subjects of prime importance He made
no mention of the tariff
In dealing with corporations Presi
dent Roosevelt expressed the hell, t
that it was worse than folly to at
tempt to prohibit combinations Tito
Sherman anti trust act. he said work
ed almost as much hardship as good
and he strongly advocated th> substi
tution of a law that would expressly
permit combinations which were In
the Interest of the public, but would 1
permit the national government to ex
ercise full power of control and super
vision over them
Publicity, he declared, should he the
chief feature of government control
over corporations and he recommend
ed executive rather than judicial ac
tlon In putting u stop to corporation
evils.
Commenting upon the railroads the
president said they should be removed
entirely from the domain of the anti |
trust law and placed completely 1111 i
dr th.- interstate commerce eotnmis
slon He advocated Increasing the p >w
ers of this commission so that It could
exercise supervision and control ov -r
the Issue of securities as well as over \
rates
The president favored traffb agree
roents between railroad corpora'lons
and said power to make such sgre.
ments should he explicitly conferr- d
upon the railroads with permission
of the interstate commerce commission
and providing the details of the agree
ments were published In full
Summary of the Message.
A summary of the message is as fol
lows:
FINANCE -The financial standing;
of the nation at the present time is
excellent and the financial manage
wont of the nation s' Interests during
the last seven years ha* si; wn tie
most satisfactory results Rut our cur
rency system Is imperfect, and it is
earnestly to he hoped that the nr
rent y commission will he able t > pro
pose a thoroughly good system which
will do away with existing defects
CORPORATIONS—"I believe it is
worse than folly to attempt to pro
hiblt all combinations, as is don*, by
the Sherman anti trust law. 1. • ause
such a law can be enforced only im
perfectly and unequally, anil it. en
forcement works almost as much hard
ship as good.
"I strongly advocate that inst.-ad of
an unwise effort to prohibit all com
binations. there shall be substituted a
law which shall expressly permit
combinations which are In the inter
est of the public, but shall at the same
time give to some agency of the na
tional government full power ot con
trol and supervision over them
"One of the chief features of this
control should he securing entire pub
Ilclty In all matters which the publb
has a right to know and furthermore
the power, not by Judicial but by ex
ecutive action, to prevent or put a
•top to every form of improper favor
itism or other wrongdoing
“The railways of the country should
be put completely under the inter
state commerce commission, and re
moved from the domain of the anti
trust law Power to make combina
tions and traffic agreements should lie
explicitly conferred upon the railroads
the permission of the commission bo
Ing first gained and the combination
or agreement published in all its de
tails.
"The proposal to make the national
government supreme over • • * •
the railroads and other instruments of
interstate commerce is merely a pro
posal to carry out to the letter one of
the prime purposes. If not the prim
purpose, for which the constitution
was founded.
"The central government Is the only
power which, without oppression <-an
thoroughly and adequately control and
lupervlse the large corporations
"We do not object to the concentra
tlon of wealth and administration, hut
we do believe In the distribution of the
weaKkin profits to the real owners,
and In . wring to the public the full
benefit oMhe concentrated sdminlstra
tlon.
"We no more believe in that mi
plrlcism which demands absolut. lv un
restrained Individualism than w.- do in
that empiricism which clamors for a
leadening socialism which would de
strov all Individual initiative and
would ruin the country with * com
pleteness that even unrestrained indl
vldualism could not achieve
LABOR —"There must be prohibition

"There Is 110 good ground for the
distinction made In the law between
those engaged in hazardous occupa
tions and those not so engaged If a
man is killed or injured In any line
of work, l! was hazardous for him.
THE COURTS "I most earn dlv
urge upon congress the duty of In
creasing the totally Inadequate salar
les now given to our judges Ih-gln
nlng with the supreme court. ih*
judges should have their salaries dou
j bled
, "I* Is earnestly to he dc-lr°d that
I some method should be devised for
lining away with the long 1 lav* which
' now obtain In the administration of
| Justice and which operate with p *eu
liar severity against perse. 11; -f small

"The courts are Jeopardized primar
ily by the notion of federal judges who
• • * • fall to understand ami ap
ply the needed remedies for th •
wrongs produced by th>- new and high
ly complex social am! industrial civil 1
zation which has grown up in the las.
half century
"Our judicial system Is sound and
effectual at core and It remains
• • * • ss the safeguard of those
principles ot liberty and justice which
stand at the foundation of American
institutions
INJUNCTIONS ‘There is ground
lor the belief that substantial injus
tice is often suffered by employes In
consequence of the , iisiom ot courts
Issuing temporary Injunctions without
notice to them Organized labor is
chafing under the unjust res’ralnt
which comes from repented resort to

"Provision should be made that no
