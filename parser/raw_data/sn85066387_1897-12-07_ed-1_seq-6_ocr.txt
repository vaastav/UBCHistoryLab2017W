McKENNA'S ENEMIES RETREAT.
IT i- api a-ent that IHE Call has turned the attack on Judge
McKerma r.ni that its promoters are in retreat. Publicity
in sucU a matter brings the issue to the test, and publicity,
which secured wiae attention to the insufficiency of the charge-,
ended the movement.
It may now le calmly examined and treated in an admoni
tory spirit. In the attack was an inspiration opposed to
genuine Americanism. At bottom tie objections to Judge
MeKenna were based upon his self-culture and the tact that
from his childhocd to tnis n-ument he has been bravely reliant
upon himself for his advanc ment in life.
Without a wealthy or powerful patron, with no inherited
material resources, with as bieak a start in life as any Ameri
can boy ever made, he has never from the beginning taken a
false step nor a backward one. A consistent member of his
party, he was allied to none of its various machines nor found
trading with any of itsbos-ts. For personal advancement In
public life he depended solely upon his cwn presentation of the
principles of his party and his cause tv to educate the people
into their adoption. When f.entiment wbs against those prin
ciples he was :oierant to its manifestations, but continued his
campaign of education with an earnestness and fairness which
did not fail at last to bring victory to him and his party. Ob
jection was made that he had been in politics. Pray, what men
were mon in politics prior to their elevation to the bench than
Taney, Chas-e, Levi "Wocdbnry, Da\id Davis, John If. Hnrlan,
Lamar, Howell Jackson, E D. White or PecKham? It is not
that a man has bten in poetics, but his bearing therein.
It is a peculiarity of American politic* that it calls for law
yers, and Rreat lawyers, 100. This is not the casein England,
where every act of Parliament is a part of the constitution and
where there is no written fundamental law.
Here we have the system of written constitution?, Federal
and Slate, and tarty issues and legislative acts must be dis
cussed and considered in the light of their conformity to those
written instruments. This involves continual construction
and interpretation of the constitut on in politics and legisla
tion, and is a necessary invitation to lawyers to enter politics
and brine training in the rules of legal construction into tbe
discussion of policies and laws.
Hence it is that in politics a lawyer has a great field in
which to display the judicial mind. Therefore a man may
give the Inchest evidence of judicial fitness In the most active
participation in politics. All m«n who recall Judge Me-
Kenna's career will remember tnat through it all he showed
the even working of a mini judicially poised. Those who have
known him best know that he would not have hesitated to an
tagonize a policy of his own party if it were flagrantly in
capable of reconciliation to the just principlej of constitutional
construction.
It is in essence a training for the bench to have been in
that fashion in politics, and for that reason wise men In the
Presidency have never hesita'ed to take men with long re cords
iv active politics for the b?nrh.
NATIONAL DEFENSES.
REPORTS from Washington are to tbe effect that compir
atively small appropriations will be made this year tor
navy and coast defenses. Leading members of both
houses are quoted as savin? the increase of the navy wilj
probably b° limited to one battle-ship and a few torpedo-boats
and expenditures for defenses will be reduced much below the
amcuists ai-ked for by the administration.
Several reasons are assigned for the proposed reductions.
The controversy between the Government and the manufac
turers over the cott of armor plate has caused many memoers
of Congress to hesitate about providing for more armored ships
until the plate can be obtained on bet:er terms. The lack of
sufficient docks to care for the ships already built has Influ
enced others, and the lack of trained artillerymen to handle th c
guns of the coast batteries* now erected is urged as a rea«on
why i«o turlher batteries should be establish ed until the uttt*
1 cry arm of tue military service has been increased sufficiently
to man them.
In addition to the reasons cited there is the further one
that in the opinion of many Congressmen the expenditures of
the Government should be limited to strictly necessary works
until the deficit caused by the Democralic depression shall
have been paid eff and the revenue of the country restored to
the normal Republican basis. It is regarded as well nssured
that two regiments of artillery will be added to the army, the
enlist ment ol a thousand additional men in the navy will be
authorized and s me of the docks recommended by Secretary
Long; will be provided, but very little more in the way of coast
defense or naval increase will be undertaken.
This being the tone aad temper which prevail in Congress,
it is a gross absurdity to enter upon any scheme ior annexing
Hawaii If we cannot afford coast defenses on our own shores
we certainly cannot afford them on aa island 2000 miles away.
If we most delay the fortification oi ports wnere we already
own the ground on wnich to e.ect the batteries, it would be
lolly to assume the Hawaiian debt of $4 000,000 and then ex
pend another large sum to fortify Honolulu.
The great naval station the British have erected nt Esqui
raalt and the strong batteries they have constructed to defend
it constitute the only point from which the Pacific coast of the
United States need fear ageres*ion, and no guard against that
aggression would be afforded by torts or navy-yards at Hawaii.
We need a h.r.jer navy, better navy-yards, more batteries and
more guns along our own shores; and until we are able to pro
vide for them on a scale cumnn'nsurate with the importance of
our coast ciues the expenditure of money on far-off islands
would be a military folly of the worg' kind.
The re-election of Chief Lees did not come to him in the
nature of a surprise. When he kissed and made up with
Commissioner Gunst he was not doinj ii just for fun, or because
of the winning naiuie of (Junst.
If the ppectacular suijide realized what a tiresome exhibi
tion his exit constituted, in pity for the rest of the worid. who
can't help noting the display, he would consent to live for
pty's sake if nothing else.
What an opportuniiy for greatness President McKinley
overlooked in not announcing that he had changed his mind
and no longer regarded the looting of Hawaii en statesmanship.
Final adjudication of the Byttie property has occurred
again. It lias occurred so often that tne public feels ac
quainted wi:h it and always welcomes it a* an old friend.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, IS9T.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
CONSEkVATISM is the dominant characteristic of tbe
President* message. It oontains nothing of a nature to
disturb the business interests of lha country, and much to
strengthen and promote the alr.-ady well-advanced movement
toward prosperity. There will be, of course, d fferences of
opinion concerning the recommendations made in reeard to
the main issues of the time, and soineol them are justly sub
ject to criticism even from the most loyal Republicans, but in
the main the message will be read witb gratification and
approval.
The President begins by congratulating the country upon the
disappearance from our politics o! sectionalism and the parti
sanship that grew out of sectional antagonism. He then etiiers
at once neon consideration of the pressing issues of the time
and puts currency reform rirst among tne acts to be expected of
this session of Congress, this constituting the salient and mo*i
important feature of his recommendations concerning strictly
domestic policies.
The Cuban quostion is elaborately reviewed and the an
nouncement made that, while the administration does not
deem it ad vifabe nt this time to recognize either the inde
pendence or the belligerency of Cuba, it will carefully guard
the rights of American cit zens endangered by the war and
use earnest efforts to bring abuut a speedy restoration of peace
on terms that will be just and honorable to both Spain and
Cuba. As was foreseen, the President recommends the annex
ation of Hawaii, but charges Congress to provide for it in
such a way ai to prevent the "abrupt assimilation of elements
perhaps hardly yet tilted to shara In the highest fraochisea
of citizenship."
Recognition is given to the importance of an early com
pletion of the Nicaragua canal, but recommendations in regard
to it are defined until the commission appointed to make
surveys, pans and estimates shull have :e; orted. The work
of the monetary commission appointed tone.otiate an inter
national conference on the silver question is commended, and
the Prcsiaent expresses the earnest hope thai ''their labors
may result in an international agreement that will bring about
recognition ot both gold and silver as money upon bticn terms
and with iacb safeguards as will secure the use ol boih metals
upon a basis which shall work no injustice to any class o; our
citiz >ns."
Rapidly, but with sufficient f'Jllness to make his recom
mendations clear and comprehensible, the President deais
with the issues involved in the organization ot Aiatka, recip
rocity, the upbuilding of our merchant marine, the protection
of the seal fisheries, the increase of the navy and coast defenses,
the Paris exposition, the debts of the Pacilic railroads, tr.e
controversy with the Greater Republic of Central America over
the appointment of Minister Merry, tne conditions of Indian
Territory and the improvement of tho civil service.
Comparatively few of the recommendations of the Presi
dent involve issues ot party politics. Nearly all of them are
matters to whose consideration the people will come with
impartial minds. It is in that way The Call win discuss
them iv detail, each as it arises, until tbey are finally settle!.
For the present it is suOuient to say the President has added
to our record ol Presidential state papers a strong and able
document, and even those who disagree with his recommenda
tions will find in its earnestness and its vigor unmistakable
evidences of his genuine statesmaiishiu and thorough Ameri
canism.
EVIDENCES OF CONSPIRACY.
GRADUALLY the details of the corporation conspiracy to
thwart the adoption of a charter for this city are being
niadu public. An account of tlie difficulty among Mr.
BucKley's "businessmen," published in The Call of Sunday,
gives tue people a clear insight into the plans of the associated
villainies for bringing the proposed charter into disrepute. It
is evidently the intention to produce by foul means the public
disgust necesiary to render the defeat of any instrument cer
tain.
The Buckley Democrats, who now call themselves the
"Citizens' Democratic Party," took part in the last campaign
as "anti-charter Democra s." Not only did they openly op
pose the adoption of the charter eubmitted at the election of
1596 but they ran aii anti-charter candidate for Mayor upon an
anti-charter platform. These Democrats are managed by
Chris Buckley. They comprise the remnant of the political
machine with which he formerly ruled the city, but which
went lo pieces upon his indictment by the Wallace Grand
Jury and his flight to Europe.
Recorder Glynn is Mr. Buckley's stage manager. He is
charged by ?ome of bis own "business men" with having
turned their organization over to the Examiner in consideration
of future support I y that sheet. As the latter is advocating
the election of the Freeholders' ticket nominated by the Citi
zens' Charter Convention, the first contract fulfilled by Mr.
Glynn has been the indorsement by the Buckleyite- of a por
tion of that ticket. This indorsement hns produced an open
revolt. To t c credit of some of the "business men" it must
ba said they object to an alliance with the yellow journal.
They know that t at meet is a confidence organ; they know
th.it it will seil them to the associated vulanies just as it sold
its readers to the Southern l'acitic; hey Know that it must
hnve some job in supporting the charter convention Freehold
ers, for it never drew an honest breath in its life, and so they
have revolted aeaiu-t Mr. Glynn's rule. Being "business men"
the Buckley Democrats are too clever to be fooled by the
yellow sheet.
How this Democratic difficulty results, however, is of little
consequence. The combatants are few in number and possess
small influence. But the trouble they are now fomenting is of
inestimable significance to the public. It demonstra es to one
who reads between the lines that I lie Examiner is at the head of
a corporation conspiracy to defeat a new charter; that in or
der to carry out itn nefarious contract — for which, doubtless, it
will, in due time, receive a fat fee — it does not scru; le to unite
with liosx Buckley and his "business men,' 1 of whose meetings
it is now giving long and respectful reports; thai it is support
ing the Freeholders of the Charter Convention merely to give
its movement a respectable fliror; that, in short, it is putting
up a Job on tLe people not only to defeat any charter, but to
bestuiich and discredit the decent men of the Citizens' Co
mmittee who are accepting its cilice-.
The burning question now before the public is thi<: What
do the members of the Charter Commi t cof One Hundred pro
pose to do about it? Are they willing to accept the support of
the Examiner and the Buckley Democrats without questioning
their motives in forcing themselves into respectable society?
Do they wish the people to understand that this disreputable
sheet is their acknowledged organ? Is their campaign ior re
form to be made on the batii of a $30,000 contract for editorial
silence? The public is anxiously awaiting answers to these
questions. The members of the Cit zens' Committee canno'
expect anybody to vote their ticket until they have either an
swered thorn or repudiated the leadership of the scurvy crowd
which Is now heading their movement.
Cubans are assured by Spain that the autonomy granted them
is a first-class article, warranted not to rip, ravel or tear, but
somehow they do not seem to credit it. Thi9 Jack of faith i*
not to be wondered at. bnanis i tfficiais i avc been lying ever
since the war began, and if they expect to be believed now
they must give a toad.
Not that a priz?- fighter is of any importance save as a
nuisance to be abate 1, yet Stiarkey's recent remark that he has
whipped ev.-ry man on the earth worth whipping does excite
intere t. How he happened to do this without anybody having
found it nut is well nigh inexplicable.
Boys in Cincinnati schools nre being taught how to cook.
Perhaps this is a good idea. Since the girls are being trained
to every manner of work formerly done by males, it is only
fair to give the boys a show in one of the few fields now left
to them.
German Runs are trainel upon Haytl and the peop'e of
that community are beginning to cxi e.-ience a foeling of dis
comfort. However, the interference whicu Uncle Sim was to
project into the situation is still on col 1 storage.
It seems after a!l that there are two sides to the story of

ARISTOCRATIC PREACHERS.
London Tit- Hit*.
Tne recent experiences ol I'rinco Max of Sax
ony In the ranks of misMoners in tht> East-end
of Lotiduu have draw: attention to the fact
that ho is not the flr?t, oven in modern days,
of princes who have taken to the ministry of
tho church as their life* work.
Prince Max of Saxony comes from an ola
Catholic family, and came to work among
the lar,-e band (f German Catholics in the
Whitecnapel district. Speaking both German
and E lglish fluently, he has bean of great ser
vice to stranded foreigners in that overcrowd
ed part of London. Hi* sermons aie of an
average length, extempore of course, persua
sive and indicative of much thought.
There i* un exmnpeoi an English I'rinc 1
becoming a clergyman. Cardinal Yorke, the
rin l twin Roman Catholic prelate, who died in
1809, .mi- i be son 01 int.- O.d Pretender, James
1-M .Mir i Stuart, aud hence the grandson o. our
James 11. lie was the i«st Prince, direct and
legitimate, of the Stuart family, but gave up
hit political life and ambition;; tv wore for the
Calm ■lie church as a priest, and filial. be
came a cardinal.
One of the mosteffec'iveof the royal preach
ore of to-day is Prince Oscar, nephew of the
King of Sweden, who has joined tba Salvation
Army division in that country. Botn he and
h s wife, the Prlnce-s, conduct meetings in
ihj open air in Stockholm and elsewnere,
which, of c< ur«e, draw immense crowds.
I'll nee Oscar preaches and prays at these
meetings, while the Princess leads the ring
ing. He is said to have a capital voice, a very
Uucnt delivery, and to b ' especially keen upon
putting his points before his audience in the
cieareit possible manner. It may be tresh in
the memory of our readers that *orne lew
years ago the Prince attended the Jubilee of
the Young Men's Christian Association la
London anJ addressed a meeting there.
That famous man of many parts, the German
Kaiser, is suit to have more than once
"preacned" to his own privates family, though
there is no record of his having done so pub
licly from tne pulpit. hut it is well known
tint he has on several occasions given the
Court chaplains both subjects and directions
lor their sermons.
Of English peers there are several well
known members, the heads of famous families,
who are either clergymen or who frequent.
address religious meetings.
Oae of the beat-known and most widely re
spected of the M th; venerable Earl of
Devon, who is the rector of I'owderhnm. near
Exeter. His lordship had been a clergyman
for some years before, by the deatn of tne last
Earl, he became possessor of his present title.
Like most younger relative ; ol a peer's family,
he had entered holy orders as his profession,
i and in due course- been inducted into one of
| the fa.nlly livings.
The Marquis of Norra&nby, of Mulgrave
I Caste, Whiibr, is not only a clergyman who
I preacue* eloquently, bat is a private school
master of high repute in the north. Probably
j his a.id (ski to youth* of pood position have
; laid the foundation of h s effective sermons to
. older people. At any rate, few aristocratic
preachers have equal renown in Northern
England.
Lord Kadstork has long been known for his
deep interest In all kinds of evangelistic work,
He has had a wide experience of mission wortc
; in large towns and In slum districts in many
pans of the country, and there are few preach*
ers of the aristocracy who are listened 10 by
worklngmen with more respect and attention.
His sermons are marked by thoughtful treat
ment, by their clear lucidity and by their in
tense earnestness In setting form Gospel
truths
L >rd Overtoun's name is well known In
fcotland, and no Scottish peer has more prac
tical experience of preaching than his lord
ship.
BRITAIN'^ MINERAL WEALTH.
Mature.
An account of the quantity and value of the
minerals obtained from the mint 8, quarries,
brine-works, etc , In the United Kingdom dur
ing the year 1896 is given in a Bluo Book just
issued by tic lit me Office. Many fac.s 01 in
terest are co .tamed in the report, in addition
to the Ma;iMic.tl i. (formation, tat the limita
t ons of spme will "nly permit us to rei*r to a
tew 01 them. In 1890 the tow 1 output 01 com
was 196.381,260 tons; of this amount 930!)
tons were ob aincd irom open quarries. Tna
ser.ms worked in England vary irom eleven to
twelve incuc. to thirty icet in tnicknes*. and
in Scotland seams ot rannel coal Oily six
inches In thicfene«s are being worked.
Tho only mine worked tor cobnlt and nickel
ore is in Flintshire, and after being idle for
several years it has lately been reopened. The
mine nrT.rds an instance of the occurrence of
the mineral absolane with red clay in irregu
lar cavities in the carboniferous limestone.
Copper mining is rapidly decreasing in im
portance In Britain, only 9108 tons having
. i-«»n produced in 18'JG, whereas the output in
1803 was '210,000 to.is.
F.i Nt mining Mia survives at Brandon, in
Suffolk; the produce tit a few shallow mines
wonted in a most primitive fasnion suffices to
supp'v the gradually diminishing demand lor
gun flints, which «re exported to savage co'in
tr.es. Ref.-rring to cold ore the report points
out that compared with the yield of the colo
nies nad many countries the amount of gold
obtained in Britain Is Insignificant; neverthe
less mineral veins In North Wales liave irom
time to time furnished considerable quanti
ties of rich numerous auariz. In 1896 the
five mines in Merioneth ire produced 8700
tons 01 ore, from which 1352J-£ ounces of gold,
havirta a value oi £5035, were obtained. This,
however, is a muci> lower output than that of

A JEWISH LAYMAN
ANSWERS REV. F. A. DOANE
To the Tditor of The Call: In a lengthy article published recently in the examiner headed
"They Answer Nieto— Presbyterian Divines Defend Their Efforts to Convert tno Jews to Chris
tianity,' 1 noticed among others the repl que of Rev. W. a. Doane, moderator of the presby
tery, who said:
"As to my personal convictions on the'subject, I can only say that it is a part of our duty
to itriv? to convert the Jew-. One of the unfulfilled prophecies Is that the Hebrew shall ac
knowledge Christ, • • • This prophecy is beine: fulti.led now. W.ien I was a boy the
Jewish children used to spit at the name of Christ. They never do so now. One of '.he tenants
of the property near our little church is a Jew. • • • Rabbi Vorsanger, wno is the most ad
vanced of the rabbis, told the Jewish youth to become members o( the Young Men's Christian
Asscciation, and surely that looks like the fulfilling of prophecy."
I have been looking In vain for an appropriate answer to Rev. F. A. Dotne's repllque from
the pen of one or'thc other of our Jewish ministers, but— was it that they considered his argu
ments either too puerile or not worthy of notice?— no answer came forward. Fearing lest
ailenca may be construed Into aeuuioscunce, I deem it my duty as a Jew (.although but a lay
man) not to allow Rev. Mr. Donne's arguments to pass unnoticed and unanswered. W .ll the
reverend gentleman kin.iv point out to me "the unfulfilled prophecies" referring to the
Hebn-w's acknowledgment of Ckrift ?
P. ease do not cite any of the obscure passages of our prophet?, which it has been the aim
of Christian d. vii.es since centuries to construct iuto wnat you now call "unfulfilled prophe
cies"—a task which can bo accomplished only by misinterpretation, misconstruction, cross
reading, false coloring and perversion ; a matter of lact s-o plain and apparent to the one who
is able to read tne "Prophets" in the original Hebrew language t"iat any further argument on
that question becomes superfluous. There is one prophecy, though, reitera:ed and more or
less dwelt upon by most all our prophets, which leaves no room lor any misrepresentation or
false coloring, it being too plain and too distinct to allow such, and it is, "Oa that day the
Lord will be Oue and his name One." This being in direct contradiction and undeniable con
tradistinction to the reverend gentleman's "unfulfilled prophecies" as to the Hebrew's ac
know edgment of a Trinity, I will leave this subject for the present, to revert to it further o n.
As to Rev. Mr. Doant's argument to prove that his cited prophecy ii being fulfilled now,
because "when he was a boy Jewish children used to epit at the came of Christ, and
they do not do so now,' I am really compelled to put a bridle to my pen to prevent it from
using uncomplimentary ar.d perhaps offensive language about his giving to the readers of this
"enlightened ago" such frail, fl:msy and lame stuff to digest. Such areuments were good
enough during the dark middle a«e.«. when they were often made use < f frjm the Christian
pulpit la order 10 incite and infuriate the ignorant and fanatical masses and rapacious
mobs, and to furnish them with an apparent plea for massacreinir, slaughtering and burn
ing thousands of inoffensive Jews and for pillage and plunder— all done in the name of
Christ and Christianity.
As to Kabbi Yccnanger's telling Jewish youth to become members of the Young Men's
Christian Association (a claim made by Rev. Mr. Doano as another argument for the fulfill
ment of the prophecies), I onstder this as a lit companion piece of his miscoiisiructed
prophesies. The It ci ;s that when n few years ago|tne queslion^of erecting a new synagogue
was unaer deliberation, and that a gymnasinm for athiet c exercises in the basement of the
synagogue was to b'-- an additional leaiure, it was then that Dr. Voorsanger remarked that any
Jewish young man anxious to indulge in gymnastic exercises could join the gymnasium class
of the Young Men's Christian Association, which had one of the best equipped gymnasiums in
the city. That is all, and that is the fact.
Another "ye y powerful and convincing" (?) argument in favor of the fulfillment of the
prophecies is the astounding fact that one of ihe tenants of the property near Rev. Mr. Doane'i
little church is a Jew. 1 suppose this is a solid, undeniable fi.ct. But it is also a fact that a
great many of the houses- owned by Jews are teneuted by Christiaus. "O! Sancta SimpiicltHS !"
would the world be justified to exclaim, were the Jewifto make use of tuch an f rgr.ment in
favor of their religion.
The mission ol Judaism is in a great measure based upon the before cited prot>hecy. "On
that day the Lord will be One and his name One." Is this prophecy nearing its fulfillment?
Let us tee by opening the pages of history. All enlightened and unprejudiced raea of civil
ized nations agree therein that as to morals, exercise of charity, parental affect leu and filial
obedience, happy home life aud so forth, the Jews stand st least on a level with the Chris
tians. It is admitted, though, that there are loss murderers, Icfs highway robberi, less wife
beaters,less patricides and fratricides etc., to be found among the Jews than among other sects.
The PeCßlo^ue as proclaimed by Moses, tbe Magna Charta o' the civilized world, nfteratesio
nearly 3500 years is acknowledged as such by Jew and Gentll'.with the exception '.hat the lat
ter transform the Vniiy into a Trinity and transpose the S»bbath, the seventh day, to Sun
dny.the first day of the week, ignoring the tact that while the Jewish Sabbath wi s ordained by
God Almighty, Sunday as a day of rest was ordained in the fourth century at the Convention
of Nice by the order and lealership of the Koman Emperor Constantlne I, a tyrant who, to
satisfy his ambition ns a ruler, had, besides a host of other- , his own wife and his owu son
executed or put to death.
Pushing these minor (?) matters into the t acltground th'- whole question of difference be
tween Jew and Gentile may be reduced to unity, or monotheism, and trinity, or polytheism.
Rev. Mr. lioane seems to be entirely blind to the fact that sln<:e centuries gome Ch ristian secti
known as Unitarians have not only been In existence, in spite of ail efforts made by Trini
tarians to annihilate them, but have become such a powerful lactor in proclaiming the unity
nf God and have increased with such a r-.-markable rapidity that there are now nearly 500
Unitarian churches and about as many Unitarian ministers la the United States and Canada.
In England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Hungary and other countries
Unitarian churches and societies are counted by the hundreds and their members by the mil
liong. While they call themselves "Christians" they have adopted the Jewish monotheism, or
belief in a unity, and have discarded altogether the belief In a trinity or the divinity of
Christ.
Will Rsv. F. A. Donne place now his arguments for the fulfillment of the prophecies as to
the c inversion of the Jews sida by sde with the prophecy, "On that day God will be One and
his name One," when there ate millions who de facto testify and prove that this iatter
prophecy is being fulfilled before onr very eyes in spite of aU efforts and endeavors of Chris
tian Trinitarians and conversionlsu? L. Bamberger.
CORRECT ANKLE MOVEMENT FOR CYCLISTS.
(Most cyclists pay little attention to pedaling as an art. As long as they can drive their

on pressure where it is of no value does not worry them. Tne above cut shows the correct po

Captain John il. Behan, who is at the Rlggs,
was the first Sheriff ever appointed for the
county of which Tombstone, Ariz., was the
] county seat, receiving his commission from
General Fremont, who was his warm personal
friend. Captain Rohan is a small man, weigh
ing only about 125 pound?, but the major part
thereof is clean grit and wiry activity. When
he was named for Sheriff the celebrated Wyatt
Earp was also »• candidate — the same E irp that
Alfred Henry L.uvU lambasted sj lustily for
his decision in the prizefight out in California.
Earp's tailuve to get iiio place made htm Bora
with the winner, and he longed for a chance
to Eel even with IVlian.
"There was in those days," said Behnn, "a
good deal of highway robbery an,d cattle-steal

the business as a regulnr profession. This was
