Two residents of Newark, N. J., within
the past few weeks have perpetrated one
grand swindle. It appears that they visited
the bakers of Newark, and the surrounding
towns, and procured large orders from them
for flour at depreciated prices. They then,
by false representations, fraudulent letters,
and the exhibition of their large orders, pre
vailed upon Messrs. Smith, Woodbury &
Co., Jesse Hoyt & Co., and other firms of tbe
New York Corn Exchange, to eeY them
flour to the amount of nearly $30,000, at
thirty days. The flour was shipped to New
York, and it is presumed was disposed of to
various parties, tbe swindlers receiving cash,
with which, instead of paying the New
York firms, they left for some unknown lo
cality.

••Its consequences, if enforced, must renu!
in a strife so sanguinary and cruel ;*_ to lost
the name of war. It is not to be sunpoeoc

strong enough to put them down without
such resentment, we are still weaker with
it."

slightest consideration.

The London Star, in the course of some
• very indignant comments upon the subjeot
- of tbe capture of the Harvey Birch by the
t Confederate steamer Nashville, makes the
- following observations: " Nothing can be
i more barbarous than the distinction recog
i nized by tbe usage of war between private
• property on land and on water. Except in
i the actual presence of the enemy, or in the
1 case of a town taken by storm, the houses
, and goods of non-combatants are respected.
i It is justly deemed an act of wanton cruelty
1 to break into a dwelling, or to fire a hayrick,
f except for purposes of military strategy.—
- No doubt such acts are common and almost
r inevitable incidents of a campaign. They
• were committed by our own troops in the
) Crimea, in India and in China. If the spoils
- of houses, museums, and even temples could
- be traced to their destination, we fear a good
- many English families would have cause to
I be ashamed. But the license of war is one
' thing—the laws of war another. Comman
ders invariably rebuke these outrages, if
• tbey do not punish them ; and the ultimate
possessors of the plunder excuse themselves
' for its possession by stories of purchase or
discovery. It would at any rate be deemed
• a monstrous atrocity fur a civilized govern-
I I ment to • take, burn or destroy,' every build
ing in their line of march or throughout a
| given territory. Yet this is the very letter
jof instructions given to naval officers. They
are bidden to seize or sink every vessel car
rying the enemy's flag, no matter what her
size, character or occupation."
