The discovery of another grave yard
at Marietta is In harmony with the
theory generally accepted, that old
Marietta is a graveyard town. Park

A town that is good enough to live
In is also good enough to die in. Many,
many people have been satisfied to
remain even to the end of life and after.
It may be different down at Parkers

THE POLITICIAN.
The most astounding thing brought
to light by the first week of the ses
sion of Congress is the audacity of the
agents of the lobby which is trying to
prevent the annexation of Hawaii. It
is only necessary for a Senator or Rep
resentative of prominence to express
in priyate conversation the slightest
doubt of the wisdom of annexation to
have these agents announce through
such newspapers as they control or
can by hook or crook obtain space in
cash is unquestionably paid in some
instances that the Senator or Repre
sentative in question is straining every
nerve to defeat annexation. They
have thus misrepresented Senators
Morrill and Hoar and Speaker Reed.
It seems as certain as anything can be
that such audacity is in the end bound
to react upon those who employ It,
and to result in making more votes for
annexation than against it. This lob
by was started by, the sugar trust, but
there are reasons for believing that a
portion of the money it is spending so
liberally comes from the secret funds
of three foreign nations which desire
to prevent annexation, but have no
reasonable excuse for attempting to
do so openly. Some of the democratic
Senators who talk the loudest against
trusts, during a campaign, are acting
in concert with the sugar trust now.
In fact, with two exceptions, Gorman
and Morgan, all the democratic Sena
tors appear to have landed, bag and
baggage, in the lobbyists' camp. Sen
ator Davis, of Minnisota, chairman on
Foreign Relations, n bich has charge
of the treaty, is thoroughly confident
that annexation will be accomplished
through the treaty, and absolutely
certain that a bill providing for annex
ation can be passed by both Senate
and House, should the power of the
lobby be sufficient to prevent the rati
fication of the treaty. It is his inten
tion to push the matter to a conclusion
in the Senate at the earliest possible
moment.
Senator 'Chandler, chairman of the
committee on Elections and Privileges
says that committee will decide upon
its report in the Oregon case at its next
meeting and that he has no doubt the
report will be in favor of seating Hon.
H. W. Corbett, as successor to lion. J.
II. Mitchell, whote term in the Senate
expired last March. If the democrats
who hare expressed themselves in favor
of beating Mr. Corbett vote that way
he will be seated.
The House committee on Appropria
tions broke the record when it report
ed the Pension Appropriation bill to
the House last week, thus furnishing
evidence that Chairman Cannon and
the industrious members of his com
mittee intend to do their part towards
pushing the imperative business of the
session, in order to help along the pro
ject for early adjournment, which is
generally favored by republicans. The
Pension bill carries SUl.218,880, ol
which 1140,000,000 is for the payment
of pensions.
It has already been made apparent
that a serious attempt is going to be
madd at this session of Congress to
modify the civil service rules. Presi
dent McKinley haying stated in hU
annual message that he believed many
positions were now embraced by the
civil service, rules which ought not to
be, republicans in Congress do net feel
that they are antagonizing him or the
party platform in taking part in this
movement, although so good a repub
llcan us Representative Johnson, of In
diana, has told, them in a speech made
in reply to Gen, Grosvenor, of Ohio,
that he disagreed with them. Gen.
Grosvenor' s idea, which he will en
deavor to get through in the shape of
a bill, is that the only employes of the
government who should be embraced
by the civil service rules are the clerks,
whose duties are sot executive, in the
departments at Washington and em
ployes of the postal service in ah
branches. All other positions he do
sires to have thrown open and the
democrats who now fill nine-tenths of
them thrown out to make .room for re
publicans. President McKlnley's baing detained
at Caaton by bU sad duty has not in
any manner inconvenienced Congress,
as ho arranged all matters requiring
his personal attention before starting
upon his last trip to tho bedsldo of his
dying mother. Everywhere his name
is mentioned tho deepest sympathy Is
expressed for him.
The Committee onDinklng and Cur
rency has obtained permission from
tho House to sit daily during sessions
of the House, and will at once endeav
or to agree upon one or more bills em
bodying portions of tho financial
recommendations made by tho Presi
dent in his annual message and by
Secretary Gage In his annual report to
Congress. Secretary Uago has been
asked to put his ideas into a bill and
submit it to the committee.
The conservative men in Congress,
regardless of party, approve of tho
position President McKinley took in
his message, on Cuban affairs, add tho
matter will be left in his hands.

that he went to her not long ago to ask

VAN AND VON.
The Ileal Slcnlllcnnco uf the Otttch
nml Ucrnmn PrcflxcH IZttilnlrictl.
It is a common mistake of those who
speak only English to suppose that the
prefix "van" before a Dutch name
signifies nobility. In the "low coun
tries" 'that is, in the kingdoms of the
Netherlands and of Belgium "van"
has no particular meaning. Names
with "van" are to be read on shops
as well as on the doors of the most aris
tocratic niRjysiocs. TJie humblest per
sons have them ns well as the most ex
alted, and a great number of the very
oldest fnmittes are withoutit
But a Ucraiany "von1 implies no
bility, and ail persons who belong to
tho nobility prcflcx "von" to their fnm
ily names without any exception. Per
sons who do not belong to the nobility
cannot have the right to put "von" be
fore their names. A man who is
knighted for some reason, however, has
the same right to put "von" before his
family name as a person of ancient no
bility. For instance, when Alexander
Humboldt was knlghtctt- he became
Alexander von Humboldt. All his de
scendants, male and female, take the
preilcx.
Talc of the Sea.
Two American captalus were recent
ly relating their experiences on differ
ent voyages. One of them told the fol
lowing story: "About one p. m. on
March 2 my ship was proceeding under
full sail when a cloud about the size
of a man's hand was observed on the
horizon. It came on. nnd as itneared
the ship we discovered that it was com
posed of locusts. They settled on the
salts and you couldn'tseeabit of canvas
for -them. When they flew away there
was not a stitch of canvas left on the
yards." "Ah." said the other captain.
"I can quite believe that, for at about
3:30 p. m. on March 2 my vessel was
proceeding under full sail when wo ob
served a small cloud on the horizon.
A3 It approached the ship we discovered
that it was a cloud of locusts, and as
they passed our vessel we saw that
every man Jack of tiem had a pair of
No, 1 canvas trousers on.!' ,
Will Tay tho Ton-Cent Increase
Akkon. O., Dec. 11. Jas. P. Loomis,
an operator controlling several mines

will give the ten-cent increase de
manded. The operators, he asserts,
can not stand another strike.

shrewd, economical, Clothing Buyers are
specinlly invited to call and see us during
tho next three weeks. Wo must turn our
merchandise into money and to do it we
expect to make a. great cut in prices
throughout our entire stock. The goods
must go and at prices that will be a great
saving of money to Cash Buyers. Houses
with a mere 'handful' oi goods to show you
and those goods bought on credit from
middle-men can't expect to compete with
us when we carry such nn immense stock
of reliable goods, all bought from manu
facturers for Cash and selected by buyers
with years of experience, men who have
made this particular line of business a life a
study. Customers tell us we have no
competitors in in the Clothing business '
here in Marietta, and, judging from the
immense increase in our sales this season
we are compelled to believe it TRUE.
No special sales for:tone day or one week
only" to deceiveyou, but low cash prices
(less than other people's) every day in the
week and year. Wo never have been,
and never will be undersold, remember
that 1 !
Our prices on Overcoats range from $1.50
to $1G.00. Those at $5.00, $6.00, $8.00
and $10.00 are extraordinary values 1 1
We have entirely too large a stock of Odd
Pants, sizes 32 to 48 waist, and 30 to 36
length. Come and take them at your
own price. We must reduce the stock
even at a loss, so here's your chance ! !
' A full line of Neckties, fine Suspendersj
Handkerchiefs, Umbrellas, OuffButtons
