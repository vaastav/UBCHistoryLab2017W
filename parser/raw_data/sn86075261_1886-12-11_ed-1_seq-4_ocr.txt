THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
A Snynojisis of the Most Important Fea
tures of that Document,
President Cleveland opens his second
message to congress, a document of
about lti.OUO words, with the statement
that the United States government is
on friendly terms with all other nations.
Special attention is called to the extra
dition treaties with the various foreign
powers. Discussing the case of Cutting
he says: Watchful care and interest of
this government over its citizens are
not relinquished because they have
gone abroad, and if charged with crime
committed in a foreign land, fair and
open trial, conducted with decent re
gard for justice and humanity, will be
demanded lor them. \\ ith less than
that this government will not be con
tent. Experience suggests that our
statutes regulating extradition might
be advantageously amended by a provi
sion for the transit across our territory,
now a convenient thoroughfare of
travel from one foreign country to
another, of fugitives surrendered by one
foreign government to a third state.
The history of the Canadian fishery
troubles is gone over, and the matter is
recommended to early attention.
Speaking of the international copy
right lie says: I trust the subject will
receive at your hands the attention it
deserves, and that the just claims of
authors so urgently pressed, will be
heeded. It is also recommended that
discriminating duty on works of foreign
artists be abolished.
An increase of salaries is recom
mended for our ministers and consuls
at foreign countries.
The subject of coast defenses and for
tifications has been fully and carefully
treated by the board on fortifications,
which report was submitted at the last
session of congress, but no construction
work of the kind recommended by the
board has been possible during the last
year from the lack of appropriations
for such purposes. The defenseless con
dition of our sea coast and lake frontier
is perfectly palpable; the examinations
made must convince us all that cer
tain of our cities named in the report of
the board should be fortified, and that
work on the most important of these
fortifications should be commenced at
once.
1 renew my approval of the recom
mendation of the postmaster-general
that another assistant be provided for
the postoflice department.
In the report submitted by the attor
ney-general to the last session of con
gress he strongly recommended the
erection of a penitentiary for the con
tinment of prisoners convicted and sen
tenced in the United States courts; and
he repeats the recommendation in his
report for the last year. This is a mat
ter of very great importance and should
at once receive congiessional action.
United States prisoners are now con
fined in more than thirty different state
prisons and penitentiaries, s-Vua-Jeu'm
every part of ito? couiii'ry. With pris
oners under its own control, the govern
ment could deal with the somewhat
vexed question of convict labor, so far
as its convicts were concerned, accord
ing to a plan of its own adoption, and
with due regard to the rights and inter
ests of our laboring citizens, instead of
sometimes aiding in the operation of a
system which causes among them irri
tation and discontent.
The report of the secretary of tb& in
terior presents a comprehensive, sum
mary of the work of the various
branches of the public service connected
with his department, and the sugges
tions and recommendations which it
contains for the improvement of the
service should receive your careful con
sideration. The exhibit made of the
condition of our Indian population and
the progress of the work for their en
lightenment, notwithstanding the many
embarrassments which hinder the bet
ter administration of this important
branch of the service, is a gratifying
and hopeful one. The funds appropri
ated for the Indian service for the fiscal
year just passed, with the available in
come from Indian land and trust mon
eys, amounting in all to 87,850,775.12,
were ample for the service under the
conditions and restrictions of the laws
regulating their expenditure. There
v remained a balance on hand on June
30, 1880, of 81,0(30,023.80, of which
81,337,708.21 are permanent funds, for
the fulfillment of treaties and other like
purposes, and the remainder, $322,
255.09, is subject to be carried to the sur
plus fund, as required by law. The es
timates presented for appropriations for
the ensuing fiscal year amount to $5,
008,873.01, or $442,380.20 less than those
laid before congress last year. The
present system of agencies, while abso
lutely necessary and well adapted for
the management of our Indian affairs,
ami for the ends in view, was adopted
when the stage of Indian management
was inadequate, standing alone for the
accomplishment of an object which be
came pressing in its importance—the
more rapid transition from tribal or
ganizations to citizenship of such por
tions of the Indians as are incapable of
civilized life. When the existing sys
tern was adopted the Indian race was
outside of the limits of organized states
and territories, and beyond the imme
diate reach and operation of civilization
and all efforts were directed mainly to
the maintainence of friendly relations,
and the preservation of peace and quiet
on the frontier. All this is now changed.
There is no such thing as the Indian
frontier. Civilization, with the busy
hum of industry and the influence of
Christianity, surround these people at
every point. None of the tribes are out
side of the bounds of organized gov
ernment and society, except thaV'Yhe
territorial system has not betm extended
over that portion of the coiJtitry known
as the Indian territory. As a race the
Indians are no longer hostile, but may
be considered as submissive to the gov
ernment, as few of them only are
troublesome. With an abundance of
land, if furnished with the means and
implements for profitable industry, their
life of entire dependence upon govern
ment rations from day to day is no
longer defensible.
The recomendations of the secretary
of the interior and the commissioner of
the general land office, looking to the
better protection of public lands and of
the public surveys; the preservation of
national forests: the adjudication of
grants to states and corporations and of
private land claims and the increased
efficiency of the public land service, are
commended to the attention of congress
to secure the widest distribution of
public lands in limited quantities
among settlers for residence and culti
vation, and thus make the greatest
number of individual homes, was the
primary object of the public land legis
lation in thé early days of the republic.
This system was a simple one. It com
menced with an admirable scheme of
public surveys, by which the humblest
citizen could identify the tract upon
which he wished to establish his home.
The price of land was placed within
the reach of all the enterprising, indus
trious and honest pioneer citizens of the
country. It was soon, however, found
that the object of the laws was per
verted under the system of cash sales
from a distribution of land among the
people to an accumulation of land by
of

and

sons. To check this tendency a prefer
ence right of purchase was given to set
tlers on the land, a plan which culniin
a*ed in the general pre-emption act of
1841. The foundation of this system was
actual residence and cultivation. Twenty
years later the homestead laws were de
vised to more surely place actual homes
in the hands of actual cultivators of the
soil. The land was given without price,
the sole conditions being residence, im
provement and cultivation. Other laws
have followed, each designed to encour
age the acquirement and use of land in
limited individual quantités. But in later
years these laws, through vicious admin
istrative methods, and under changed con
ditions of communication and transporta
tion, have been so evaded and violated
that their bénéficient purpose is threat
ened with entire defeat. The methods of
such evasions and violations are set forth
in detail in the report of the secretary of
the interior and commissioner of the gen
eral land office. The rapid appropriation
of our public lands, without bona fide
settlement or cultivation, and not only
without intention of residence, but for
the purpose of their aggregation in large
holdings, in many cases in the hands of
foreigners, invites the serious and imme
diate attention of congress. The ener
gies of the land department have been de
voted, during the present administration,
to remedy defects and correct abuses in
the public land service. The results of
these efforts are so largely in the nature
of reforms in the process and methods of
our land system, as to prevent adequate
estimates, but it appears by a compila
tion from the reports of the commissioner
of the general land office, that the imme
diate effect in leading cases which have
come to a final termination, lias been the
restoration to the public mass of public
lands of 2,750,000 acres; that 2,730,000
acres are embraced in investigations nöw
pending before the department or courts,
ami that the action of congress has been
asked to effect the restoration of 2,790,
000 acres additional, besides which
4,000,000 acres have been withheld from
reservation, and the rights of entry there
on maintained.
I recommend the repeal of the pre-emp
tion and timber culture acts, and that the
homestead laws be so amended as to bet
ter secure compliance with and cultivation
for the period of five years from date of
entry without commutation or provision
for speculative relinquishment. I also
recommend the repeal of the desert land
laws, unless it shall be the pleasure of the
congress to so amend these laws as to ren
der them less liable to abuse. It may be
deemed advisable to provide by lei'Mp
uards and upon tl. a ] len .
tiou of vested rights and lands ^verec
thereby until patents issue. Last , a ,
executive proclamation was issued rîîrec t
ing the removal of fences whqch* enclosed
the public domain,v* tumy of these have
been removed 3m obedience to such, but
much oîy ' the public land still remains
witiviti the lines of these unlawful fences
The removal of the fences still remaining
which enclose public lands, will be eu
forced with the authority and means
which the executive branch of the gov
eminent is or shall be invested by the
congress for that purpose.
The report of the commissioner or pen
sions contains a detailed and most satis
factory exhibit of the operations of the
pension bureau. During the last fiscal year
the amount of work done was the largest
in any year since the organization of the
bureau, and it has been done at less cost
than during the previous year in every
division. On June 13; 1886, there were
365,783 pensioners on the rolls of the
bureau. Since 1881 there have been
1,018,735 applications for pensions filed
of which 78,384 were based upon service
in the war of 1812. There were 621,754
of these applications allowed, including
60,178 to the soldiers of 1812 and their
widows. The total amount paid for pen
sions since 1861 is $808,624,811.57. The
number of new pensions allowed during
the year ended June 30, 1886, is 40,857,
a larger number than has been allowed in
any year save one since 1801. The names
of 2,229 pensioners which had been pre
viously dropped from the rolls were re
stored during the year, and after deduct
ing those dropped within the same time
for various causes, a net increase remains
for the year of 20,658 names. From
January 1, 1861, to December 1, 1885,
1,967 private pension acts had been
passed ; since the last mentioned date, and
during the last session of congress, 644
such acts became laws.
The secretary of the interior suggests a
change in the plan for the payment of the
indebtedness of the Pacific subsidized
roads to the government. His suggestion
has the unanimous endorsement of the
persons selected by the government as di
rectors of these roads, and protects the
interests of the United States in the board
of directors. In considering the plan
proposed, the sole matter which should be
taken into account, in my opinion, are
the situation of the government as a cred
itor, and the surest way to secure the
payment of the principal and interest ot
its debt.
The relations of labor to capital and of
laboring men to their employers are of
the utmost concern to every patriotic citi
zen. When these are strained and dis
torted, unjustifiable claims are apt to be
insisted upon by both interests, and in the
controversy which results, the welfare of
all and the prosperity of the country is
jeopardized. Any intervention of the
general government within the limits of
its constitutional authority, to avert such
a condition, should be willingly accorded.
In a special message transmitted to con
gress at its last session, I suggested the
enlargement of our present labor bureau,
and adding to its functions the power of
arbitration in cases where differences
arise between employes and employers.
When these differences reach such a stage
as to result in the interruption of com
merce between the states, the application
of this remedy by the general government
might be regarded as entirely within its
constitutional powers.
The estimates presented for appropria
tions for the ensuing fiscal vear amount
to $5,608,873.94, or $442,336.20 less than
those laid before congress last year.
The department of agriculture, repre
senting the oldest and largest of our na
tional industries, is subserving well the
purposes of its organization. By the in
troduction of new subjects of farming en
terprise, and by opening new sources of
agricultural wealth, and the dissemina
tion of early information concerning pro
duction and prices, it has contributed
largely to the country's prosperity. The
interest of the millions of onr citizens en
CL
by.
The
The
als
The
gaged in agriculture, are involved in the j East
enlargement and improvement of the re
sults of their labors; and a zealous re
gard for their welfare should be a willing
tribute to those whose productive returns
are a main source of our progress and
power.
The existence of pleuro pneumonia
among the cattle of the various states, has
led to burdensome, and in some instances,
disastrous restrictions in one important
branch of our commerce, threatening to
effect the quantity and quality of our
good supply. This is a matter of such
importance and of so far-reaching conse
quences that I hope it will engage the se
rious attention of congress.
The continued operation of the law re
lating to our civil service has added the
most convincing proofs of its necessity
and usefulness. It is a fact worthy of
note that every public officer who has a
just idea of his duty to the people testi
fies to the value of this reform. Its
staunchest friends are found among those
w'ho understand it best, and its warmest
supporters are those who are retained and
protected by its requirements. The mean
ing of such restraint and protection is not
appreciated by those who want places
under the government regardless of merit
and efficiency, nor by those who insist
that the selection for such places should
rest upon a proper credential showing
active partisan work. It is exceedingly
strange that the scope and nature of this
reform are so little understood, and that
so many things not included within its
plan are called by its name. When civil
service yields more fully to examination
the system will have large additions
the number of its friends. I invoke for
this reform the careful and ungrudging
support of congress. I renew my recom
mendations of last year, that the commis
sioners be made equal to other offices
the government, having like duties and
responsibilities; and I hope that such
reasonable appropriations may be made
as will enable them to increase the use
fulness of the cause they have charge of,
In conclusion I earnestly invoke such
wise action on the part of the people
legislators as will subserve the public
good and demonstrate during the remain
ing days of congress as at present organ
ized, its ability and v inclinations to
meet the people's need that it shall be
gratefully remembered by an expectant
constituency.
