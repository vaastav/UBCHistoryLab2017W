The press of this country in the main,
"stands for honesty and efficiency in gov
ernment and administration; for purity
in politics; for justice, mercy, liberty,
humanity, and loyalty to country. If
there are any nowspapers recreant to
these high ideals, such are compelled to
simulate, at least, the appearance of the
virtues that they do not possess. This
condition exists because the men back of
the newspapers, like Americans in all the
other legitimate callings of life, are true
to these grand principles that are the
foundation stones and enter into the
whole auperstruction of our free govern
mentthis mighty temple of liberty, of
individual rights and responsibilities.

ANOTHER FOP GONE WRONG.
A Jadas Iscariot ia Complexion aad Pria
ciple. Editor Jodbnax: I see by the Argus
that Mr. Brindley's memory is a little
defective, as he claims that he has known
me for 30 years, and that I used to be a
Jacksonian democrat. My memory
reverts to 1871, when I became a voter,
and I am proud to say that I cast 'a
republican vote in 1871 and continually
since that time. I well remember how
many times I have been a delegate to the
republican conventions in Polk county.
I have often talked with Bra Brindlev
and looked in his face with pity, to think
bow his mind would rattle around in his
cranium like a buck-shot in a tin wash
boiler. He claims that I have always
been a champion for the poor, the
wronged and the oppressed. I admit
that I am sympathetic with those who
are cast out upon the cold charities of
an unfriendly world.
I think Bra. Brindley is a well-mean-ins;
man and does not seek to do a fellow
man an injustice, but there is a sort of a
Jadas Iscariot, silver principle about
hint that I really wish he would get rid
of. I think he ought to take something
for that pop doctrine which he advocates
aad get the knot on his neck straight
ened out. I think the warm congenial
climate of the Philippines would be ben
eftetal to him, and I would make a motion
that we start the ball rolling in Platte
coaaty and never let np until we have
landed every pop in America safely on
the sunny islands of the Philippines.
Yours forever a republican,

Pakis, Dee. . The joist peace com
mirm was in session for over four
hoars. Much of the discussion con
cerned details as to the guaranteeing of
the rights of Spanish citisens in the
ceded colonies. The debate was occa
sionally energetic, and the Spaniards,
on adjourning, appeared to be dejected.
Secretary Ojeda of the Spanish com
mission, when questioned after the
meeting as to the progress made, said,
excitedly: "I am almost mad. I cannot
iir We are making progress."
The American commissioners declined
so say anything farther than the prog
ress was satisfactory.
The history of the document, which
will certify the passing of the oldest co
lonial power in the world, and the ad
ntif til nw- na signalized in a
single sentence, "A peace treaty can
!Tuil ;JuZir.trm nat: into
lything which victors pat inro
contain an;
it"
The -i" listened for hours
with their customary patience to the
technicalities convoked by the Span
iards with their customary shrewdness
and persistency against proposals mak
ing for the dismemberment of their em
pire. Darkness had come on, and Sen
ator Irye, whose unconcealed contempt
for diplomatic quibblings excites the
amaiement of the Caatillians, had
talked out, his patience exhausted.
The burden of the Spanish arguments
was that matters outside the bare oes
-i. mmA evacuation or me Bpamsn ter
ritory, which the Americans proposed to
cover by the treaty, were beyond
the legitimate and customary scope
of a peace treaty. Behind
this bulwark Senor Montero Bios, presi
dent of the Spanish commission, forti
fied himself, bombarding bis opponents
with a supply of arguments and prece
dents wWcfi inspired the freely ex
pressed admiration of ti Americans.
SlaaUy Judge Day aummariaed the
America position in the foregoing
memorable utterance. It was given
and taken is good spirit and from that
moment the proceedings were entirely
friendly. The session accomplished
much. Eight open questions were
canvassed, seven being practically set
tled without noteworthy friction. The
commissioners decline to say what con
clusion was reached, but the bargain
for a coaling station in the Oarolinea
was not cemented and according to
areaent prospects, it is likely to fail.

Mr.

aid: "The president's message is re

cation at this time will do good, coun
teracting reports that have been spread
in Cuba by people who have not the
real interests of the country at heart.
' We have full faith in the United States
and in the just intentions of President
McKinley , and the men who have made
the revolution of Cuba aim to work
with the United States to establish a
government that will have the respect
of nations. General Garcia is well
satisfied with the interviews he has had
with American officials. The infonaa-.
tion he is giving and gathering will aid
greatly in the work of regeneration we
have in hand."

"According to trustworthy news from

born of bankruptcy and ruin. One of
the best informed men in the kingdom
assures me that the chances of a revolu

Carlism exists in three provinces only,

It is noticeable that representatives of

dation, be accepted and contract awarded him.
We further recommend that the sum of 83000
additional be allowed Mr. Steinbaugh for haul
ing the material to the building site, and that
Mr. Steinbaugh be required to enter into con
tract for the same and furnish good and suffi
cient bond. He to be allowed SO days from this
date to complete said barn, allowance to be
made for bad weather."

A Good Enterprise.
As many Journal readers know, A.
W. Armstrong is one of our best ma
chinists. He has just erected a foundry
and machine-shop, 40x44 feet, on west
Tenth street, and will be fully ready for
business by the twentieth of the month,
expecting to start out with three men
and to increase the force as business
may require. He will do all kinds of
general repair work on engines, pumps,
boilers, etc., and will manufacture
smoke-stacks and gasoline engines.
After he gets under headway he will
have gasoline and steam engines from
two to ten-horse power, to sell or rent.
His foundry will be of 5-ton capacity,
that is, one melting of iron may be as
much as five tons.
He has employed a No. 1 foundryman
for that branch of business. He intends
working in brass as well as iron.
Mr. Armstrong has for some time
been successfully engaged in running
feed-grinders and will not discontinue
tbat line of business. Farmers having a
large quantity of feed to grind, can have
it done by him at their place, thus sav
ing transportation, if they wish to feed
on the farm. Mr. Armstrong has a good
portable engine, and prices are very
reasonable.
Give him a call when wanting any
thing in his line. 2t
St. Mary's Hospital.
We extend our sincerest thanks and
gratitude to all persons who assisted us
by so liberally donating cash and other
valuables, and to all who so cheerfully
gave their services free for the financial
and social success of the fair for the
benefit of St Mary's Hospital.
