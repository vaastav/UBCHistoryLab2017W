Lecture at Lyceum Hull.
• 'u the invitatiou of the friends of Cen
texinary College, our reporter last night at
tended a lecture at Lyceum Hall, by the
Hon. Christian Roselius, in favor of re
establishing the institution as it existed be
fore the war. The committee at whose re
quest the lecture was delivered consisted of
hdward McGehee, or Woodville; K. T. Mpr
rick. of New Orleans: J. O. Fuqua, of Baton
Ilougc: I). C. Hardee, ol Clinton. Louisiana:
\V. H. Dameron. of New Orleans.
i'he lecturer commenced hy saying that
Centennary College was organized under
the auspices of the Methodist Church, a sect
tne most influential and numerous of a!! re
ligious denominations in tiie United States.
Centennary College had educated some
of the most learned scholars and leading
men in the South, and when the war broke
out ;t wag in a flourishing condition. At
home, he said, was the place to educate
the natives ot any State, where they would
he subject to the influence of parents,
brothers and sisters. Louisiana should fol
low the example of other States, and estab
lish local institutions of learning. The first
four years of college life should he spent in
the student's native State, and after that he
might be sent to Europe to complete hi.
education.
It had been asserted that the college in
question wus conducted under sectarian in
Alienees. That was not the fact, for the
system of education wus the same as ut
Yale College or the Harvard University.
\Y e had in New < Irleans as good common
schools as any in the Union, aud at these a
foundation could he laid upon which to
build a superstructure at any other State
college or university.
The lecturer expressed his regret that
there was not a more numerous attendance
ot t lie friends of the institution.
Iron Barges— Meeting nt the Chamber of
Commerce.
A full meeting of merchants and business
men was held last night in the large room
of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. John
Phelps in the chair.
Mr. Labouise, the secretary, stated that
twelve committees had reported additional
subscriptions, amounting to $A0,.7o0, which,
together with the sum heretofore received,
amounted to $-243,900, with fifteen commit
tees yet to hear from.
Mr. Summers made a speech, stating that
the. large property holders of the city who
were most deeply interested had not sub
scribed enough to pay for an advertisement
in a newspaper.
Mr. Summers then presented the charter
of incorporation, which was read by sec
tions.
The name of the company is to be "The
Mississippi River Iron Barge Company." The
capital stock is fixed at $1,000,000, divided
into twenty thousand shares ol fifty dollars
each.
There are to be fifteen directors, to be
ejected annually on the second of March
The legal domicile of the company will he
the city ot New Orleans. The company is
to commence operations when $500,000 are
subscribed, and twenty-five per cent paid in.
A committee of three, composed of Mr.
Slayback, Mr. Chaffe and Mr. Tupper, was
appointed to select fifteen directors as cor
porators of this company.
On motion of Mr. Clinton, Mr. John
1'Uelps and Mr. H. M. Summers were added
to the committee, with power to appoint
ten -more incorporators, making fifteen in
all.
The meeting then adjourned, subject to
the call of the fifteen incorporators here
after to be named.
Metairie Jockey Club.
The programme of the third day's races
is published this morning, and as the track
is becoming better from day to day the in
terest in the races will continue to increase,
ami the attendance will undoubtedly be
large to-dav.
The Temperature.
The thermometer at Louis Frigerio's,
No. 50 Chartres street, stood yesterday as
follows: At 8 A. M.,38°; at 2 P. M., 54°; at
6 P. M.. 53 . Lowest point during the
night of December 5. 30-.
Mrs. Sarah Norton thinks a woman with
the right of suffrage would be as miserable
as a man liable to bear children. She also
believes that all the women who advocate
"woman's rights" have failed in finding a
woman's place in life.
Mr. and Mrs. Enos Batrhelder lately cele
brated their golden wedding at Avon, New

that Mr. Batchelder was the bride's third
husband, she having had two others, with
whom she lived six years apiece, and by
whom she had six children.

Metairie Jockey Club Races.
Day and track, for second day, were
splendid, although the ground could have
been a little dryer. Three races brought
out a very respectable number of citizens,
most of them somewhat enthusiastic,
betting their money freely, in a small way.
We heard of few large bets, but a general
good leeling prevailed.
The first race, mile and a quarter for all
ages, club purse $300 Glenrose appeared
the favorite by odds, especially with turl
men. but they made a slight mistake, as
the sequel proved. Before the horses were
called, Lord Byron took his rider a volun
tary run around the course, which weak
er.ed that nag's chances for winning.
(*n the start Madame Dudley led off
briskly, Von Moltke second, Glenrose third.
Frank Hampton fourth, Rice's bay tillv
fifth. Lord Byron sixth and Temple last.
The Madame kept her place neatly, although
closely pushed by Glenrose and the tillv,

the disease.

REPUBLICANS ON A JUBILEE.
Serenade to Lieutenant Governor Pinrh
bnrk anil Senator Harris.
The jubilant feelings of the Republicans
of New Orleans, consequent upon the x'ie
tory in the Senate yesterday, over the com
bined forces of the faetionists and Demo
crats, found vent last night in a most en
thusiastic demonstration.
About ll P. M.. prominent and influential
members of our party, some two hundred
in a!!, accompanied by a tine brass band,
suddenly awakened spirit-stirring melodies
in trout of the residence of the newly
elected Lieutenant Governor, Hon. P. B. S.
Pinchbaek.
After two or three airs had been played.
Mr. Pincliback made bis appearance, and.
in bis usual felicitous and happy manner,
thanked those who were testifying their re
spect ior and confidence in him. He re
gretted that painting and the repairs which
his residence was undergoing prevented
h.m from inviting his friends thereinto, but
he quaintly suggested that be knew where
refreshments for the inner man could be
procured.
This suggestion resulted in an adjourn
ment to the rooms of the Louisiana Pro
gressive Cltib. where wine and wit flowed
freely, and patroitic sentiments, including
''continued confusion to the immaterial
coalition," were quaffed in bumpers.
A motion to extend the serenade to in
clude Senator A. B. Harris, of Concordia
parish, who is temporarily residing on Ram
part street, near Barracks, was cordially
acquiesced in, and headed by the band, dis
coursing martial strains, the whole com
pany proceeded thither. The welcome was
as hearty and cordial as the Senator's repu
tation warranted his friends in expecting,
and toasts and speeches soon again became
the order of the occasion.
Governor Pincliback introduced Senator
Harris to those whom he had not previously
met. and took advantage of the opportunity
to heartily indorse his consistency and ear
nestness as a Republican throughout his
public career in Louisiana.
Senator Harris commented upon the vic
tory over the Customhouse-Democratic al
liance as tlie salvation ot the party in
Louisiana: eulogized the late Oscar J. Dunn
:n eloquent terms, and stated that this al
liance was deliberate treachery to the teach
ings aud principles of the deceased Lieuten
ant Governor. He concluded by the assertion
that H. C. Warmotli as Governor and P.
B. S. Pinchbaek as Lieutenant Governor
would carry the Republican party to vic
tory in 1872 with a majority of 40,000 votes,
which sentiment was received with pro
.onged and entluisiasti' cheering.
Senators Hunsaker and Noland followed
:n a similar strain, aud added to the en
thusiastic feeling already existing.
It was well into the morning when the
party dispersed. Ali felt and expressed
the conviction that a new lease of power
had been won for the Republican party in
rh;s State, and that they could afford to
transcend their usual regular habits a little.

1.rent Miilei-ina Anions the Hunter*—
Several Frozen to Death.
fCorrespondence Lej-enworth Cali/
Concordia. Cloud county. November
-8.—From a Mr. Sohliuger, who just re
turned from the buffalo grounds some two
hundred miles west of here. I learn the
storm of Saturday and Sunday. November
18 and 19. was a terrible one on the Plains.
The party, consisting of about a dozen per
sons, saved themselves by wading in the
snow up a ravine, and at the head digging
a dug-out.
One of the party was frozen but will get
well. During Saturday they heard several
guus, and though knowing they were sig
nals of distress, could afford no succor ou
account of the blinding storm.
At Ash Grove they saw the grave of a
trapper who had been frozen to death.
There were two men trapping, and it ao
pears that the storm came upon them so
suddenly that they could not prepare for it.
The unfortunate man's hands were burned
off. The other man was found badly frozen,
but will recover.
Further down the valley the party heard
that two men and a boy were found frozen
to death. There was nothing about the
outfit by which they could bo identified.
At Wagonda the party learned that out
of a party of eleven hunters who starred
out before the storm, only three have re
turned. It is thought the balance have
perished.
The storm was so unexpected that it
caught the majority of the hunters unpre
pared for it. That many lives have been
lost, there seems to be no ilouht.

Alexis stock in the South is below par.
according to the New Orleans Republican.
which lustily protests against his contem
plated visit, and thinks it will be a cause
of genuine disgust to the Southern people
that this young sprig ot Muscovite Ciesar
ism should go among them.
There are many reasons why his visit will
not be acceptable to them. l>ut let us hope
that the fervent one is that alleged by the
Republican —an indifference to princes. In
this sense the Southern people are no more
curious to see him than to see the Aleuts his
government gulled us into buying. In
point of fact, the reception of Alexis in the
North has been exceedingly tame and com
monplace. The enthusiasm has been weak
and shoddy. No one seems much impressed
with the \10nor and dignity of the visit.
Kings' sons used to find the American people
susceptible and voally.
The times are changed. Manifestly kings'
sons are going out of date—are on the de
cline. Royalty itself is in the sere and yel
low leaf, is being plundered of its preroga
tive, aud on its travels none but fools seem
to watch its movements with complacency.
It is well. Kings and princes have been as
henbane to mankind. Greater scourges
than ignorance; more willttil. wicked and
bloodier tyrants than bigotry aud religious
lust. Let them perish. But give us a man:
a genuine, live, honest, sterling, great
souled man, be he prince or beggar, and let
our eyes gaze on him. The kind of men
that have claimed to come from the Lord
have been bogus pretenders. The world is
sick to death of its common-place leaders.
It wants a hero whose deeds shall bespeak
his royalty.
We quote from a Pennsylvania paper:
"Chicago was probably the most populous
city in the world, previous to the confla.
gration. Some fourteen millions of her 'des
titute citizens' Lave passed through this
city in the past three weeks. You can't
throw a cat in any direction without hitting
a 'sufferer.' The dodge is becoming thread
hare."

Report of Commissioner of Agriculture—

t onsidered—Resolution Offered hi Kn.
Klux Committee—The Clark and Gid*
dings Contest.
Washington, Deeember 0.—The Commis
sioner of Agriculture, in his report accom
panying the President's message, speaking
ol the needs of Southern agriculture, says;
"It must be conceded that the course of
agriculture in the Southern States has not
been conducted with that care, skill and re
gard for ultimate results which have char
acterized the operations of farmers in other
States. While their lands are continuously
devoted to cotton and tobacco until they
have arrived at a state of exhaustion, those
ot the North are continually improving
by a rotation of crops, which is
absolutely essential to the life of
the soil itself, and without which
farming and planting had better be aban
doned. These impressions have induced
me to turn my attention to these States to
seek some inode by which the influence of
this department may tie directed to benefit
them—to find out whether their imple
ments. and especially their seeds, may not
he greatly improved, and how in the distri
bution of shells and Diants we may best
reach those to whom they maybe profitably
sent."
The commissioner says that the Southern
States sutler greatly in their interests for
want of grasses, in the,use of which their
productions would he greatly increased by
rendering a rotation of crops necessary.
Clover, with its deep roots, and rye grass,
a strong grower, will well endure the
hot sun of the South.
Referring to the distribution of seeds, he
says: "I am satisfied that the mode hereto
fore pursued is erroneous: the quantity sent
is entirely too small lor even an experiment.
A pint or quart of wheat, oats or other
cereal can not be successfully grown, and
such experiments almost uniformly fail be
cause the quantity is too small, f need not
! here discuss the reasons for this: but the re
| suit is manifest to those who have tried the
| experiment. It would he far better to put
I a half or whole bushel of seed into the
| hands of one conscientious and careful per
, son than to divide the same quantity among
| ten or twenty.'
j Senate .—Senator Anthony introduced a
I bill amending the election law. making it a
