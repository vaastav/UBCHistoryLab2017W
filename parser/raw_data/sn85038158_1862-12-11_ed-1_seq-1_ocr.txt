Miscellaneous Enigma. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate
and House of Representatives:
it
it
is
Sine your lost annual airaemblinp;,
another yoar of health and bonntifiil
harvests has passod; and while it has
not pleased the Almighty to bless us
with a Return of peace, we can but press
en, guided- by the best ligVt He - Rives
as, trusting that in II is own good limo
and wise ways, all will be well.
The correspondence touching foreign
affairs which has taken, place during
the last year, is herewith, submitted, in
virtual compliance with a request to that
effect, made by tho House of Represent
atives, near the close of tho last session
of Congress. If the condition of our
relations with other nations is Ices grati
fying than it has usually been at former
periods, it is certainly more satisfactory
than a nation so unhappily distressed
as we are might reasonably have appro
hendod. ; In the month of Juno last,
there were some grounds to expect that
tho roaratime Power, which, at tho bo
ginning of our domestic difficulties so
unanimously and unnecessarily, as we
think, reognized the insurgents as a bel
ligerent, would soon recede from that
position, which has proved only less in
jurious to themselves than to our own
country; but tho temporary reverses
which afterward' befell the national
arms, and which were exaggerated by
our own disloyal children abroad, have
hitherto delayed the act of simplcjus
ticc. "' ' ' -
The civil war, which has so radically
changed, for the moment, the occupa
tions and habits of the American people,
has necessarily disturbed the social
conditions and afFuoted very deeply,
the prosperity of the nations with
which we have carried on a commerce,
that has been steadily increasing
throughout a period of half a century.
It has, at the same time, excited politi
cal ambitions and apprehensions, which
have produced a profound agitation
throughout the civilized world. In this
unusual . agitation, we have forcborne
from taking part in any controversy
between foreign States, and between par
tics or factions in such States. Wc
havs attempted no propagandism, and
acknowledged no revolution. But we
have left to every nation the exclusive
management of its own. affairs.. Our
struggle has been, of course, contemplat
ed by foreign nations, with reference
less to its own merits than to its suppos
ed and often" exaggerated effoa, and
the consequences resulting to those na
tions themselves. Nevertheless, com
plaint on the part of this Government,
even if it were just, would sertainly be,
unwise. .
Tho treaty wiih Great Britain for the
suppression of tho African 'slave-trado
hue been put in operation with a good
prospect of complete success. .- It is an
occasion of special pletsure to acknowl
edge that tli o elocution of it on the part
ot Her Majesty's Government has bean
marked by a jealous respect for the au
thority of tho United States and the
rights of their moral and loyal .citizens.
The Convention with Hanover fur the
abolition of tho StaJt dues has been
carried into full effect under the act of
Congress for that purpose
A blockade of three thousand miles of
sea-coast oould not bo established and
vigorously enforced in a season of great
commercial activity liko the presont
without committing occasional mistakes
and inflicting unintentional injuries up
on foreign nations and 'heir subjects.
A civil war occuring in a country where
foreigners reside and carry on trade,'
under treaty stipulations, Is necessarily
fruitful of complaints of the violation of
neutral rights. All aueh collisions tend
to excite misapprehensions, and possi
bly, to produce mutual' reclamations be.
tweea nations wbieh have a common
interest in preserving peace and friend
ship. In clear easea of. these kinds, I
have, so far as possible, heard and re
dressed complaints which have been
presented by friendly powers. There is,
however, a lurgi and augmenting num
ber of doubtful eases, upon whioh the
Government is unable to agree with the
Governments whoso protection is de
manded by the claimants. There aro,
moreover, many cases in which thu Unit
ed States or their oitiiens suffer wrongs
from the naval.or, military authorities
of foreign nations, which the Govern-
mA , , -ici ; .-i ! . ' 'V
menu or tneso otaiesare not at once pre
pared lo rdra.TMJuv proposed, o
some of tie foreign States, thus inter
t
ested, mutual conventions to examine
and adjust such complaints. This prop-f
osition has boon made especially to
Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and
to Prussia.. In each caso it has been
kindly received, but has not yet been
formally adopted. . I deem it my duty
to recommend an appropriation in be
half of tho owners of the Norwegian
bark Admiral P. Fordens Illolo, 'which
vessel was, in May, 1861, prevented by
the commander of tho blockading fleet
off Charleston from leaving that port
with her cargo, notwithstanding a simi
lar, privilege had shortly before been
granted to an English vessel. , I havo
directed the Secretary of State to cause
the papers in the case to be communi
cated to the proper committee.
Applications have been made to me
by many froo Americans of African do
seent to favor their emigration, with a
view to such colonization as was con
templated in recent acts of Congress.
Other parties, at home and abroad, some
from interested motives, others upon pa
triotic considerations, and still others
influenced by philanthropic sentiments,
have suggested similar measures; while,
on tho other hand, several of the Span
ish American Republics havo protested
against sending of such colonies to their
respective territories. Under these cir
cumstances, I have declined to move
any such colony to any State without
first obtaining tho consent of its Gov
ernmcnt, with an agreement on its part
to receive and protect such emigrants
in all their rights of freemen, and I have
at the same time ofLrcd to several States
situated in the tropics, or having colo
nies tlicro, to negotiato with them, snb
jeetto the advice and consent of the
Senate, to favor the voluntary emigra
tion of persons of that class to! their re
spective ierritorics upon conditions
which shall bo equal, just, and humane
Liberia oiid Iloyti are as yet the only
countries to which colonists of African
descent from here could go with ccrtointy
of being rocoived and adopted as citi
zens, and I regret to say that such persons
contemplating colonization do not seem
so willing to emigrate to thoso countries
as to some others, nor bo willing, as I
thiuk their interest demands. I be
lieve, however, the opinion among them
in this respect is improving, and that
erelong there will. bo an augmented
and considerable emigration to both
these countries from the United Statos.
. Tho New Commercial treaty between
tho. United' States and tho Sultan of
Turkey has been carried into execution.
A' commercial and consular treaty has
been negotiated, subject to . the Sen
ate's consent, with Liberia, and a simi
lar negotiation ii now pending with the
Rcpublio of If ay ti. A considerable im
provement of the national commercee is
expected to result from these measures.
Our relations : with Great , Britain,
Fritnce, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prus
sia, Deomark, Sweden, Austria, the
Netherlands, Italy, Rome, aud the oth
er European States remain undisturbed.
Very favorable relations also continuo
to bo maintained with Turkey', Morocco,
China and Japan. During tho last year,
thcro has not only been no change
our previous relations with the indpend
ent States of our own continent, but
more friendly sentiments than have
hetetofuro existed aro- bclioved to be
entertained by those neighbors,, whose
safety and progress 'are eo , intimately
connected with ours. This statemo
specially applies to' Mexbo, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua;' Honduras, Peru, and Chill.
The commission 'under the Convention
with the Republic of New Granada clos
ed Its session without having audited and
passed upon all the claims submlttted to
it.' A proposition is pending to revive
the Convention, that it may bo able
do more complete justice. . The commis
sion between the ; United. States and
Costa Rica baa oomploted its labors and
submitted its report. I have favored
the project for connecting the United
States with Europe by an Atlantio Tel
egraph, and from San Franeisoo, to eon
W e w OTr 1 . .
neot ny a racino xeiegrepn wan a wire
which is being extended across the Rus
sian Empire.
The territories of the United State
with unimportaa exceptions, bare re
mained) undisturbed by the civil war,
and they are exhibiting such evidence
prosperity ' as Justifies an expectation
that some of them will soon be in a con
dition to be organised as States', and be
constitutionally adtnittedinjto tWUnion.
Thp immense mjneral resources of some
of those Territories ought to be devel
of
to
of
oped as rapidly as possible. Every step
in that direction would have a tenden
cy toimprovo the revenues of the Gov
ernment, and diminish' tho burdens of
the people. It is worthy of your scri
ous consideration whether some extraor
dinary, measures to promote that end
can net be adoptod. The means which
suggests itssclf as most likely to be ef
fective, is a scientific exploration of the
mineral regions in these Territories,
with a view to the publication of its re
sults at home and in foreign countries
results which cannot fail to bo aus
picious.
Tho condition of the finances will
claim your most diligent consideration-
Tho vast expenses incident to the mili
tary and naval operations required for
suppression of the rebellion have hith
erto been met with a promptitude and
certainty , unusual . in similar circum
stances, and the public credit has been
fully maintained. 1 ho continuance of
tho war, however, and the increased dis
bursements made necessary by the aug
mented forces now in the Geld, demand
your best reflections as to the best means
of. providing the necessary revenues
without injury to business, and with the
Ioast possiblo burdens upon labor. The
suspension of specio psyment by the
banks, soon a fter tho commencement of
your last session, mado large issues of
United States notes unavoidable. In
no other way could the payment of
the, troops and the satisfaction of other
just demands, be so economically and
as well provided for. The judicious
legislation of Congress, encouraging the
reccivability of those notes for loans
and internal duties, and making 'them a
'legal tender", for other debts, has sat
isQedpartially at lesat, and for tho time
the long felt want of an uniform circu
lating medium, saving thereby to the
people immense sums in discounts and
exchanges.
A return to specie payments, howev
er, at the earliest period compatible
with a due' regard to all interests
should ever bo kept in view.
Fluctuations in the value of curren
ry are always injurious, and to reduce
these fluctuations to tho lowest possible
point will always be a leading purpose
in wise legislation.
Convertibility, prompt and certain
convertibility into coin, isj;;enerally ac
knowledged to be the bc$! and surest,
safeguard against them, and it ii ex
tremely doubtful whether a circulation
of United States Notes, payable in coin.
and sufficiently jargq-for the wants of
the people, can be permanently, or u eful
ly maintained. Isthcro, then, any other
mode in which the necessary provision
for the publio wants Can be mado, and
the great advantages of a safe and uni
form currency secured? -,;
' I know of none which promises so
certain results, and at the same time so
unobjectionable, as the organization of
Bank Associations nndcr a general act
of Congress, well guarded in its provis
ions. To Such associations, the Gov
ernment might furnish circulating
notes on the security of United States
bonds deposited in the Treasury.
Theso notes, prepared under tho super
vision of proper officers, being uniform
in appearance and soiiurity, and conver
tible always into coin, would at once
protect labor against the evils of a vi
cious currency, and facilitate commerce
by oheap and safe exchanges. A mod
erate reservation from the interest on
the bonds would compensate the United
States for the preparation and distribu
tion of the notes, and a general super
vision of tho system, and would lighten
the burden of that part of the publio
debt employed as securities. The pub
lio credit, moreover, would be groatly
improved, and the negotiations of new
loans greatly facilitated by the steady
market, demand for Government bonds
which tho adoption of the proposed sys
tem would create.
It is an additional recommendation
of tho measure", of considerable weight,
in my judgment, that it would recon
cile, at far at possible, all existing inter
ests, by the opportunity offered to exis
ting Institutions to roorganixo under
the act, substituting only the secured
uniform national circulation for the lo
cal and various circulation, secured and
unsecured, now issued by them. ;

information on the subject of the finan
ccs will bo found in tho Report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, to whose
statements and views 1 in7ite your
most candid and considcruto attention
The Reports of the Secretaries of the
Navy and War are herewith transmitted
Tbjso reports, though le ngtby, are
scarcely moro than brief abstracts of the
very numerous and extensive transao
lions find operations conducted through
these Departments, nor could I give
summary of them here upon any princi
ple which i, would admit of its being
much shorter than the reports them
selves. I therefore content my.-elf with
laying the reports before you, and ask
ing your attention to them.
It gives mo pleasuro to report a deci
ded improvement in tho finanoial condi
tion or the rost oinee Department as
compared with several preceding years
The receipts far the fiscal year 1S61 a
mounted to $3,349,296 40, whioh em
braced tho revenue from all the
States of tho Union for ihrce' quarters
of that year. Notwithstanding . the
cessation of revenue from tho so-called
Seceded States during the last fiscal
year, tho increaso of thu correspondence
of the loyal States has been sufficient to
produce a" revenue during tho same
year of $8,299,820 CO,' being only $50,
000 less than was derived from all tho
States of the Union .during the previ
ous year. The expenditures show ! a
still more favorable result. The amount
expended in 1861 waa $13,606,759 11.
For the last year the amount has been
reduced to $11,125,361 13, showing a
decrease of about $2,4S1,000 in the ex
penditures, as compared with the prece
ding year, and about $3,750, OOOas com
pared with the fiscal year 1860. 1 he
deficiency . in the Department for . the
pravious year waa $4,551,966 93. For
the last fiecal year it was reduced to $2,
112,814 : 57. -Those favorable results
are, in part, owing to the cessation of
mall servile in . the insurrectionary
States, and, in part, to a caroful review
of all expenditures in ihat department,
in the interest of economy; .. The effi
ciency of the Postal scrvioo U is believ
ed hat also been much improved. , The
Postmaster General also opened a cor
respondents, threUgH the Department of
State, with foreign Governments, propo
sing a convention of Postal Representa
tive!, for tho purpose of siwplifyiag the
rates of foreign postage and to expedite
the 'foreign mail. , This , proposition,
equally important to our adopted citizens
and to tha commercial interests of tin
country, has beet) favorably entertained
and agreed to by all the .Governments
from whom replies havo been received'.
I ask. tha attention of Congress tg the
suggestions of the Postroastc Gcneml
in his report respecting the further leg
islation required, In his opinion, for the
benefit of the postal servioo. . " , ' ' "
-The, Secretary of (ha Injeripr report),
ay follows in regard to the publhflndi.:
j 'Th. publio leods have qeasodjo . be
atourea i of xevunua, ; From, fhe 1st tot
July, 1861,. to'.tholOtlv Qf September;
1862,' the entiro oath receipts frotn th

land system durihghe same period. The
Homestead Law, which will take effeot
on the 1st of Januaay nxt, offers suoh
inducements to settlers that, sales for
cahh can not be expected to an extent
sufficient jo meet the expenses of the
General .Lsnd Office, and . the cost of
surveying and bringing the land into
market,"; .,, -. ,.. , , , .
The discrepancy between the sum
here stated as arising from tho sales of
the public lands and the sum derived
from the ssnm source as reported from
the Treasury Department, arises., as I
understand, from the fact that the pe
riods of time, though" opparcntly,
were not, really, coincident at the begin
ning point the Treasury report includ
ing n considerable sum now winch had
previously been reported from the Into
tior, sufficiently large to overreach . the
sum derived from the three months now
reported up-n by the Interior, and hot
by the. Treasury. ,
The Indian tribes upon our frontiers
havo, dnrinsr tho past year, manifested a
spirit of insubordination, and at scvpral
points Ivivp engaged in open hostilities
acalnst the white settlements in their
vicinity. The tribes occupying the In
dian country south of Kansas renoun
ced their allpfrianco to the United States
and entered into treaties with the in
surgents. Thoso who remain loyal to
the United States were driven from the
country.. The Chief of tho Cherokee
has visited this city for the purpose of
restoring tho former relations of the
tribe with the United States. He alle
ges that they were constrained by supe
rior force to enter into treaties with thu
insurgents, and that the United States
neglected to furnish the protection
which tin lr treaty stipulations required
In the month of August last, the
Sioux Indians, in Minnesota, attacked
the settlements in their vicinity with
extreme ferocity, killing indiscrimi
nately men, women and children. This
attack was wholly unexpected, nnd
therefore no means of defence had been
provided. It is estimated that not less
than S00 persons wero killed by the Tn
dians, and a large amount of property
was destroyed. How this outbreak was
induced is not definitely known, and sus
picions, which maybe unjust, need not
bo stated. Information was received bv
lite Indian Bureau'from diff -reut sour
ces, ubout tho time hostilities were com
menced, that a simultaneous attack was
to be made upon the" white settlements
by all the tribes between the Mississippi
River and tho Rocky - Mountains. The
State of Minnesota ' has suffered great
injury from this Indian War. A Urge
portion of her ' territory has been de
populated, and a severs loss has boen
snstaincd by the destruction of property.
The people of that State manifest much
anxiety for the removal of the tribdB bo
yond the limits' of the Stato ns a guar
antee1 opninst further hostilities. The
Commissioner ' of ' Indian .Affairs will
furnish full details. .' '
I submit for your especial considera
tion, whether our Indian system shall
not ba ' remodeled. Many wise and
good men ' have been impressed with
the belief that this ' can bo profitably
done. 1 '
I submit a statement of the proceed
ings of the ComroUhioncrs, which chows
the progrera that has boen nude in the
enterprise of' oanstrnating - he Pacific
Railroad, and thi suggests I lie earliest
completion of the r.ouii,.1 and also ' tha
favorable notion, of Congress upon the

In my Inaugural Address,: I briefly
pointed out tho. total inadequacy '.of
disunion as a remedy for the difference
between the people of the fwo sections.
I did so in languago which i I cannot
improve, and which, therefore, I beg to
repeat : "Ooe section Of our country
believes slavery is right end ought to lo
extended, while tho other bul.icvesf k in
wrong and ought riot. to. be extepded.
This is the only substantial dispute.Tr
The Fugitive Slave olause of tliB.Uonsti

African slave (rado are each as well en
forced, perhaps, as any law can evor , bo
in a community wherj the! moral . souse
of the people imperfectly tupporls- .the
law itHolf.'. The great body of the .'peo
ple abide by the dry, legal obligations
in both eases, and a few. break, over"
each; Thifl, I think, cannot-bq perfect
ly cured, and it would be worse in both
esses after the separation, of .'tho Koo
doos than beforo.; Tho foreign slave
trade, . now iiupcrfucily suppressed,
would be ultimately revived without re
striction in one section, while fugitiva
laves, now only partially . surrendered,
would not be surrendarcd, at all by the
other. - Phy.icft.lly speaking, wa cannot
removQ'oui rcspoctive sections, from

wall betwenu--them.. . A husband and
wife , may be dlvorocd ao,ij go out of tho
presence and beyond the rcaplv,of each

but remain face to Taee, and intcroourso
