LOCAL MATTERS.
Home Aoain— HV Are y Armed and
Eager for Uit Pray, —We make our bow
again this afternoon to the readers of the
Journal, after an absence of ten days,
among our country friends. This was the
lirst holiday we had for twelve months ;
and although vacation usually spoils school
boys, we have no fears it has seriously af
fected our usefulness. We return to our
task greatly refreshed, ready and willing
to do our best to interest and entertain tho
readers of our paper.
This winter, in Richmond, promises to
be lively, and to furnish matter of interest
(o the scribblers of our several newspapers,
and as our promise has been given that
none of them shall excel us in watchfulness,
we hope to make the Journal to all par
lies interesting. The Legislature meets
day after to-morrow. Numbers of mem
bers have already arrived, and while we
hope for the good of the country, the ap
proaching one will not be like its predeces
sor. We shall keep a keen lookout on its
actions, and lay them before our readers
from day to day.
While in the country, a wag remarked to
us, that if tho people of Virginia had select
ed its last legislature from among the in
mates of the various penitentiaries they
could not have been worsted. Having no
relatives in the concern, we were not called
upon to fight over the remark, and so left
the question to those who beard the speech I
and those familiar with its proceedings.
AYe trust the present one will be an im
provement on the last, and that the ono
soon to assemble will consider well tho
condition of the people of the State, and
adopt such a line of policy as will relieve
them from the many oppressive burdens
under which they now labor. The Demo
crats have such undisputed possession of
the law-making power that we hope no
question will arise in tho future as to who
is responsible for their legislation.
Our Fire Apparatus.—What we
said a few days ago upon the subject of
of purchasing a new hook and ladder ap
paratus for our fire department has occa
sioned Considerable comment among pro
perty owners and business men, and the
necessity for early action in the matter is
generally acknowledged. We would not
unnecessarily create a dollar's expense;
but when the vast wealth of the city is in
ta great measure dependent upon the
efficiency of the fire department, no discreet
person can afford lo hesitate to make such
outlay as may be required to secure abso
lute efficiency in the department.
Company " F" of the fire brigade, located
on Church Hill, has not yet been provided
with such apparatus as the interests of that
section of the city demands. A steamer j
should, as soon as practicable, be placed in
charge of that company, which is com
posed of active, capable and experienced
iiremen. And when Manchester is annexed
to Richmond, of course our fire system
will be extended over that community, and
a steamer will be required by the "Alerts."
Two of tho best steam-engines now used
by the department were manufactured in
Richmond. They can be made at as small
*'ost here as elsewhere; and when our
Council can afford to go into the expense
of additional apparatus, we hope Riclimond
mechanics will have an opportunity ot
doing the work.
To-Day and Wednesday.—To-day
in Washington, will be repeated on a
smaller scale in this city, Wednesday
next. Congress meets to-day and will re
ceive the President's message, tvhile on
Wednesday our Legislature will convene
and receive the message of the Executive
of the State. Our hotels and boarcitng
houses have had a general cleaning up,whilo
the restaurants and drinking saloons arc
increasing their supplies. Ye tiger, has
whetted his claws, combed his main,
brushed down and oiled his sleek hide,
and is ready wiih all sorts of inviting enter
tainments to seize the per diem of the mem
bers who habitually visit the den of the
aforesaid animal.
We are anticipating a real jolly time
this winter, and have ordered a couple
gross best "Eagle" pencils for the occasion.
VVe expect to devote a day or two to sharp.
ening theni and ourselves, and shall watch
eagerly for something of an interesting
character to turn up; our watch shall not
be of the Micawber style—no! no!—this
is too slow for us. We mean to keep up
with the times, and if possible catch up
with ono or two of the several "jobs" now
in contemplation. If any railroad corpora
tion or funding bill concern comes this way
this winter, we are prepared to look after
the individual, and give our readers an in
sight into his affairs. We can't be bought
with any small amount, and want it under
stood at the start our price is a considerable
one. Come on with your show, then;
we've got tickets, and mean to see the
•whole of it.

Attention, Goochland and
1-juisa !—Mr. James'T. Sutton has infor
mation of an interesting character to the
heirs of Alary O. Fontaine, deceased, who
died about twelve years ago in either Oooch

a gentleman named Duke. Although he
may be no relation of Alexis, plain Mr.
Duke may learn something if he will com

upon our several churches, thereby disap- j
pointing a number of young ladies who
' were anxious to take from tlieir wardrobes, I
bureau? and dog-houses, their new dresses, |
charming hats, Ac, &c. No sadder disap
pointment can overtake the fashionable la
dies of a city than a rainy, dismal Sabbath, j
Nevermind, young ladies, old probability ,
will yet give you an opportunity of display- J
, ing your double-skirt new store-clothes.-— !
He patient.
How ih This for High ?—The col- j
; lector of internal revenue has a pile of:
j boxes iv his ollice so high as to create a j
I wonder in the minds of his visitors as to '
| how they were piled to such a height.
Burgess says he keeps taxes in the top box,
j which accounts for the highness of it. If j
■ ' this be true, what will be the height of the
i ! one containing State taxes next year ? [
t i Auswer : Too high to be reached by men i
| of ordinary means.
A New Revolution in the Crimp
ing BUSINESS— A Richmond Afan the
Inventor. —On an election day, held in
Hichmond some time ago, Thomas Hagcr
: ty, a young Republican of this city, after !
t having cast his rote walked into a inillinc- i
J ry establishment, where he observed a he-1
millinei, with mallet and chisel, cutting :
j cloth into crimps. This, to Hagerty, I 1
j seemed a slow process, and on inquiry, as- !
' certaincd there was not a single machine !
ever patented in America for crimping pur
poses. The result of the election being |
against us, Mr. Hagerty determined to at
tempt the invention of a machine to supply
a greatly needed want. A few days work -,
enabled him to perfect ono which lias been J
recently patented, and which will do tho
work of fifty women by the ordinary pro
cess, j
Thia little but revolutionary affair has an
attachment by means of which it is screwed
to a table, and acts somewhat like a coffee
or pepper mill. The crimping knife is turned '
by a crank and catches the article to be
crimped on a wheel pressed against the
knife by means of a spring. Any number
of folds may be cut at one timo. This
little affair is very simple, and not likely to
get out of order, but with all its simplicity „
promises to create a great revolution in the .
manner of crimping. Indies who are en
gaged in this character of work need give '
themselves no uneasiness as tho amount i
lof work will increase in projxirtion to tho c
means of accomplishing it. Mr. Hagerty
has refused $50,000 for his patent. It re
joices us muchly to see a poor Republican
so fortunate. We wish more of them were ,
;in the same condition. He leaves the city (
to-morrow for the North, where he goes to
superintend tho manufacture of Hagerty's c
('limping Machine. '
Richmond Typographical Union (

i'r. -i. I.lil - .11.5.iv..
The President's Message was transmitted
to Congress to-day, and is very brief. Its .
features are Unimportant except in relation J
to general amnesty in the South, Upon
this subject, he says: ! A
"More than six years having elapsed since lat
the last hostile gun was fired between tho j
armies then arrayed against each other, one i
for the protection, the other for the de- |
struetion of the Onion, it may well be con- j w
sidered whether it is not now time that the | 7
disabilities imposed by the fourteenth j s
amendment should be removed.
"That amendment does not exclude the
ballot, but imposes the disability to hold "l
office upon pertain classes, when the pur- ■'
pose of the ballot is secure.
"I do not see the advantage or propriety
of excluding men from oflice merely be- ;
cause the)' were, before the rebellion, of
standing and character sufficient to be i
elected to positions requiring them to take !
oaths to support the constitution, and \ _
admitting to eligibility those entertaining \ a
precisely the same views, but of less stand- j "
ing iv their communities. 'ri
"It may be said that the former violated it:
an oath, while the latter did not. The »
latter did not have it in their power to do ft
so. If they had taken this oath, it cannot «
be doubted they would have broken it, as w
ditl the former class. If there aro any c ]
great criminals distinguisetl above all others n
for the part they took in opposition to the ''
government, they might, in the judgment „
of Congress, bo excluded from such I
amnesty. j
"Tins subject is submitted for your j
careful consideration. Tlie condition of the i n
Southern States is unhappily not such as
all true patriotic citizens would like to see.
Social ostracism for opinion's sake; perso
nal malice or threats toward persons enter- -.
laining views opposed to those of the old i
citizens ; prevents immigration, and the *
flow of much needed capital into those .
States. i,
"It will be a happy condition of tl.e U
country when the old citizens of these „
States will take an interest in public affairs, (
promulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote
for men representing their views, and tole- J*
rate the same freedom of expression and ..
ballot in others as is accorded to them." t
He resumed a liberal appropriation to |
carry out the Indian Peace policy ; also r
recommend that the public lands be regard
ed a. a heritage to our children to be disc
. posed of only as regained for occupation -
and to actual settlers.
With regard to Utah, he says. "In
Utah, there still remains a lemnant of bar
i barism, repugnant to civilization, to decen- "
oy and to tlie laws of the United States.— I
Tei-ritorial officers, however, have j
been found who are willing to per
form tlieir duty in a spirit of equity and
11 with due sense of the necessity of sustain-
i ! ing the majority of the law. '
• I "Neither polygamy nor any other viola
i tion of Existing States will be permitted J
i within the territory of the United States." j
"It is not with the religion of the self
styled saints that we are now dealing, but
' with their practices. They'will be pro- ■
« tected in the worship of Got! according to
' tho dictates of their conscience, but they
' will not be permitted to violate the law i
' uuder the cloak of religion.
"It may be advisable for Congress to urn- j
sider what, in the executive of the laws j
against polygamy, is to be the status of, '
plural wives and their offsprings.
j|"The propriety of Congress passing au t
' enabling act authorizing the territorial legis- j i
" lat lire of Utah, to legitimize all children
| born ptior to a time fixed in the act, might ;
|be justified by its humanity to those inno- ■
.' i cent children.
' This is a suggestion only, aud not a re-
COB mendation/'
The Cuban question is disposed of, as I
i follows:
1 "It is to be regretted that the disturbed
' condition of Cuba continues to be a source
of annoyance and anxiety.
r "The existence of a prostrated struggle
v in such close proximity to our own terri
i. Tory, without apparent prospect of an I
y early termination cannot be other
jr than an object of concern to a people who,
_ while abstaining from interference in the
affairs of other powers, naturally de
■(ire to see every country in the undisturbed
t'njoymcnt of peace, liberty, and the bless
ings of free institutions.
"Our naval commanders in Cuban wa
ters have been instructed, in case it should
to spare no effort to protect :
the lives and property of bona fide Ameri- |
'an citizens, and to maintain tho dignity of
the flag. (
"It is hoped that all pending questions |
tvitli Spain, growing out of the affair <
n Cuba, may be adjusted in C
he spirit of peace and conciliation which
las hitherto guided the true process in I
.heir treatment of such questions."

FROM WASHINGTON.
Internal Revenue Stall.lit..
Washington, Dec. 2.—The report of the j
Commissioner of Internal Revenue aggre- j
gates the receipts ot tlu fiscal year at I
♦ 14-4,000,000; estimated receipts of the !
Current year, $125,000,000.
The number of distilleries registered is j
1,043, producing 45,500,000 taxable gal-
MM. The fruit distillation aggregates 2,- I'
125,000 gallons. I 1
The total receipts from tobacco are $88,* '
."500,000, an increase of $2,250,000. The
total yield of tobacco is nearly 100,000,000 \
pounds, of which 10,500,000 pounds were i
exported. The number of cigars, cheroots,
&c, upon which tax was collected, was
1,332,000,000.
The continuance of tho present system ,
of stamps is recommended. The commis
sioner also recommended a uniform tax of (
thirtj-two cents per pound on tobacco ; a !
special tax on peddlars of fifteen, twenty
five and fifty dollars, increasing with the j '
number of animals used by them ; a special
tax of $500 on persons who sell raw or leaf
tobacco to others than those who have paid
the special tax, or who shall sell leal to I
bacco in quantities less than twenty-five
pounds. This would protect the inaiiufac- I
turers and increase the revenue. j
The abolition of the present system of ex
port bonded warehouses is suggested in the '
interest of manufacturers and the govern- .
ment. Drawbacks to be allowed upon
proof that the goods landed abroad ; loss !
at sea also entitling the shipper to draw
back.
The government has gained 3,182 and
lost 450 revenue suits. i
The seizures of property for violation of I
the revenue laws aggregate 8818,000. I
The early disposal of lands acquired by t
direct taxes is recommended. i
The commissioner, upon the results of a f
uniform tax at different rates, says: From .
the table presented in this report it will be t
seen that more than two-thirds of the man
ufactured tobacco which reached taxation 1
during the fiscal year, paid the tax of 32 i
cents per pound ; yielding four-fifths of the
revenue which was collected directly from
the article by stamps. Had a tax been ]
collected at a uniform rate of 32 cents on the (
entire product of manufactured tobacco (
which reached taxation during the last fis- I ,
cal year, the receipts therefrom would have j \
reached $30,443,061.28. 11
Added to this sum the taxes collected ou |
cigars, the special taxes of manufacturers
Of tobacco and cigars, the dealers in leaf
and manufactured tobacco, sic, the total
receipts would have been $38,401,728.79. M
Similar calculations show that the uniform I '
receipts per pound on the same quality '
would have realized the sum of $30,850,- <
888.47, and that a uniform rate of Hi cents I
per pound would have realized the sum of
$23,240,048.15.
Thus it will be seen that on the assump
tion, that the same number of pounds I
would have reached taxation had the rate j <
of ta.N been uniform either at 1(1, 24 or 32 ]'
cents per pound, a uniform rate of 32 cents ' 1
would have increased the revenue* by the ]
sum of $-1,882,821.01; while a uniform j
rate of 24 or Hi cents would have dimin
ished those receipts in the sums respective
ly of $2,728,018.71 and $10,338,859.03.
The commissioner suggests 24 cents, but ,
under the probable decrease from other
sources rather favors 32 cents per pound !
as the uniform tax.
Commissioner Douglas concludes his par
agraph regarding the uniform tax on tobac
co thus: "My own opinion is that with our
tax at twenty-four cents, taking into ac
count the natural increase of tho revenue,
as shown between the collections of pre- j
ceding years, with the advantage of tho !
legislation hereafter recommended, we
shall be able to keep up the collections
on tobacco up to those under the present
rates.
"This recommendation, however, is made
without regard to its relation to future total
revenue receipts.
"If it should be the opinion of Congress
that the yield of revenue from internal
taxes should not be materially tlecreased,
then to accomplish the desirable results ex
pected from a consolidation of the tax on
tobacco and to compensate jn part to the
revenue, the expected large loss from the
expiration of the income tax during the
current fiscal year, and the future material
loss from articles and occupations formerly
taxed, but now exempt, a rapidly decreas
ing item, of course, would advise a consoli
dation of the tobacco tax at 32 (tents per
pound."
Commissioner makes no suggestions re
garding the whiskey tax. He urges legis
lation for the disposal of damaged tobacco
which will not realize taxes, and for relief
in cases where stamps are lost from pack
ages by accident.
The accounts of 230 ex-tax collectors are
still unsettled, of which 115 have been
placed in the hands of attorney.
