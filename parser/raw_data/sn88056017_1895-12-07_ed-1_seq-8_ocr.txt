MLACKEOOT. IDAHO, DECEMBER T. IM6.
PITT6BCRG ought to get the Repub
lican National ConTention. It would
doubtless be able to smoke out all the
dark horses early.
Prom the present outlook it is doubt
ful if the Populist next year will poll
as many votes in the country at large
as the Prohibitionists.
Senator Hoar may be a trifle pre
vious but he has hit it right in hinting
that the Turks be treated as "pirates
or common enemies of the human race'
It is asserted that Indiana Populist
wish to nominate De be for Governor,
but Debs is too well pleased with liber
ty just now to crawl into a hole like that
Thebe is some little speculation con
cerning the next Democratic and Re
publican nominees for the Presidency,
but the Populist candidate is not even
worth guessing at.
The most careful observers of the po
litical situation and those who are not
afraid to report things as they think
they see them regard Harrison as the
most pomising of the Republican Pres
idential boomers, with Allison as a sec
/ ond in the race.
A Georgia judge has sentenced to jail
for contempt of court a photographer
who took a snap shot of the judge while
he was asleep on the bench during a
trial. His constituents should suggest
to that judge that there is another way
to prevent such insults to the bench.
Maher wont fight anyone but Fitz
simmons. Fitzsimmons wont fight any
one but Corbett. Corbett wont fight
anybody at all. And the Governors of
the Southern states say they will lick
anyone who attempts to fight in their
bailwicks. Pugilism is evidently in the
sear and yellow leaf.
WITH the opening of Congress last
Monday the political mill was put In
operation for the next Presidential elec
tion. Before this session ends the na
tional candidates will be in the field,
and then, of course, there will be no
"let up" in the excitement until after
the votes are counted on November 3.
A poll of the Democrats of the House
shows that fifty-six are for free silver,
forty-one ai e sound money men, and
seven are doubtful. The Republicans
have a plurality of 140 in the House and
four-fifths of them are for sound money.
There will be very little silver talk in
the present Congress.
The stories of Turkish atrocities in
Armenia may be somewhat exaggera
ted, but there is little room for doubt
that they truly represent in a general
way a situation that is a reproach to
.civilization, and particularly to that
part of it represented by England.
A recent publication by the State De
partment on the "Highways of Com
merce" estimates that at the beginning
of 1895 there were 406,348 miles of rail
way in the world valued at «33,655,350.
000. In apportionment by continents
America stands first, having at that
time 218,871 miles, or 31,394 miles more
than all the rest of the world combined
The English newspapers are very
much displeased with President Cleve
land's message to Congress. Thpy say
there is too much Monroeism in it for
them. The document may be displeas
ing to Johnnie Bull's subjects but it
has the right ring to Americans, all of
whom are ready and willing at any
time to uphold the Monroe doctrine.
Mr. Whitney has put forth a poslr
tlve statement with regard to the Dem
ocratic nomination for the Presidency.
"I am not a candidate and have not
been a candidate and must not be
sldered a candidate," says Mr. Whit
ney. Yet if the Democratic National
Convention should insist upon nomina
ting him, there is nothing in this de
cision to prevent the honor being forc
ed upon him; and a very handsome and
popular candidate he would make, not
withstanding his present refusal.

The Message.
Mr. Cleveland sent his annual
•age to Congress last Tuesday. It is a
very lengthy document, containing
about 20,000 words. But passing
tion is mode to subjects other than for
eign. The Cuban trouble is dwelt upon
gnd the proper course of this govern
ment is defined. Mr. Cleveland says
that while our sympathy must be

corded to a struggling people, we must
at the same time observe in good faith
our obligations to nations with which
we are at peace.
The greatest part of the message is
devoted to the financial question. It is
strongly favorable to the gold standard.
Silver coinage is advocated, but not un
limited and independent coinage.
The message very strongly advocates
the application of the Monroe doctrine
in the Venezuela case. He also recom
mends a speedy settlement of the Beh
ring sea controvercy with England by
the payment of 1425,000.
Improvement in our consular service
are recommended, and every public
question needing attention is touched
upon in the message.
As a whole, the message has the great
merit that it presents unmistakably the
executivs policy on the supremely im
portant questions of the hour.
FIFTY-FOURTH CONGRESS MEETS.
Thomas B. Reed, of Maine, was Elected
Speaker of The House.
Washington, Dec. 2 —The 54th con
gress was called to order to-day at noon.
The scenes in the chambers of the Sen
ate and House were animating and at
times exciting. Large crowds came to
the big Capitol to-day through a driz
zling rain. There was much interest
manifested in the presence of
members of both branches of the Leg
islature.

By 10:30 o'clock the public gallaries
were filled. Many ladies were in the
throng.
The House of Representatives passed
ed to-day Into the control of the Re
publicans, and Thomas Brackett Reed,
of Maine, again triumphantly assumed
the Speaker's gavel. The opening ses
sion was, as is usual, an anulmated and
brilliant occasion, set oft with crowded
galleries in holiday attire; intoxicating
with the perfume of hundreds of floral
tributes to popular members, and per
vaded with a spirit of jubilation and
good nature. Old famlliur faces
absent, but there were plenty of
ones to take their places. Still, the
proceedings themselves, as usual with
opening sessions, were of a routine
ture and devoid of interesting and sen
sational features.

PECKHAX .NOMINATED.
Sew Yorker to Succeed the ijite Justice
Howell E. Jackson.
Washington, Dec. 4—The President
to-day nominated Rufus W. Peckham,
of New York, to be Associate Justice
of the United States Supreme Court, to
succeed the late Howell E. Jackson, of
Tennessee. He also nominated Richard
Olney to be Secretary of State, and
Judson Harmon Attorney General.
