Washington, Dec. fl.— Présidait
Harrison's annual message to congress
wan sent to the two houses today. It
is addressed to the senate and the house
of representatives and reads as follows :
In submitting my annual message to
congress I have great satisfaction In
being able to say that the general con
ditions affecting the commercial and
industrial interests of the United
Htates are In the highest degree favor
able. A comparison of the existing
conditions with those of the most fav
ored period in the history of the coun
try will itself show that such a degree
of prosperity and so general a diffusion
of comforts of life were never before
enjoyed by our people. The total
wealth of the country in 1880 was #16,
159,616,068. In 1890 it amounted to
#62,610 000,000, an increase of 287 per
cent. The total mileage of the rail
ways in the United States In 1800 was
30,828. In IHM! It was 187,741, an in
crease of 448 per cent, and it is esti
mated that there will be about 4,000
miles of track added by the close of
the year 1802. The official returns of
the I Ith census und those of the 10th
for the 76 leading cities furnished the
liasis for the following comparison :

I am informed by the superintendent
of the ceusus that the omission of cer

ivmarkahle increase Unis shown, lii.t
after making full allowances for the
diffeiences of method, and deducting
the returns for all Industries, not In

The wage-earningt* not only «how an
Increased aggregate, but an increase
lier capita from *888 in 1880, to #647 in
1800, or 41.71 per cent. The new in
durtrtnl plants established since Octo
her 8, 1800, up to October 22, 1802, as
partially reported In the American
Economist, number 346, ami the exten
sion of existing plants 108. The new
capital iuvested amounts to$40,440,0/10,
and the number of additional em
ployes to »7,280.
The Textile World for July, 1802 ,
states that during the first six months
of the präsent calendar year lit» new
factories were built, of which 40 are
cotton mills, 48 knitting mills, 20 wool
en mills, tâ silk mills, 40 plush mills,
and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton
mills, 21 have taten built in the South
ern states. A. II. Hhephcrdsou, of lint
New York cotton exchange, estimates
the number of working spindles In the
United States Septembor 1. 1882, at
186.000. 000, an Increase of 880,000 over
the year 1801. The consumption of
cotton by tbe American mills In 1801
was 2,300,000 bahts. From 1800 to 1802,
Inclusive, there has been an increase
in tbe consumption of cotton iu Eu
rope of 92 per cent, while during the
same period tbe Increase of consump
tion in tbe United States bas laten
about !•> per cent.
The report ol Ira Ayer, special agent
of the treasury department, shows that
September 30. 1802, there were 32 com
panies manufacturing tin aud tin-plate
in the United Htates, and 14 companies
building new works lor such manufac
ture. The estimate of tlie investments
In buildings at the close of the llscal
year, June 3>, 1802, II existing condi
tions were to be counted, was »6,000,000,
and the estimated rate ol production
201.000. 000 pounds per annum. The
actual prodn thin for Ute quarter end
lng September 30, 1802, was 10,012,726
pounds,
Tbe report o( the labor comniiasioner
01 New York shows that during the
year 1801, in about 8000 manufacturing
establishments in that state, embraced
within tbe special inquiry made by him
and repreaenting 07 aillèrent industries,
there was a net increase over the year
180,), of $31,316,131 88 in the value of
tbe product, and of $0,307,026 00 in the
amonutof wages paid.
The report ol the commissioner ol
labor for tiie state ol Massachusetts
•hows that 376 industries in that state
paid $129,410,238 in wages during t<u
ye tr 1801, against $128,03 >,303 in 1809,
an increase ol $3,336,046, and that there
was an increase ol $0,803,040 iu the
amount ol capital, ami of 7308 in the
nnmtier of persons employed in tbe
ssiue period.
During the last six months of the
year 180i, aud the first months of 1802,
tiie total production ol pig iron was $0,
710,810 tous, as against 0,200,703 tons iu
the year 1880, which was the largest
anuusl production ever obtained. For
the same months ol I'•01-1842 the pro
duction of Bssseiuer ingots was 3,878,
681 tons, sn increase of 189,710 gross;
tons over the previously unprecedented
«early production of 3.888,871 gross tons :
in 18BÜ. The production of Bessemer j
steel rails for the first six months of
1808 was 772,430 gross Pins, as against ,
602.080 gross tons during tbe last six
months ol tbs year ol 1801.
The total value ol our lore gn trade
(exports and manufactu'e* during tbe I
last dscal year was $1,867,080,810, an in
crease ol $120,203,004 over the previous ;
fiscal year. Tbe average annual value,
ol our imports and , x -orte ol merchan
d ; se (or the 10 fiscal years prior to 1801
wai $1,467,322,018. It will be observed
that our foreign trade lor 1882 exceeded
this annual average value by $ 400 , 368 ,. j
391, an increase of 87 47 per cent. The ;
significance and value of this increase i
are shown by the fact that the excess in !
the trade ol 1892 over 1801 was wholly
in tbe value ol exports lor there was a
decrease in the value of imports of
$17,613.261. The value of our exports i
during the fiscal year 1802 reached the 1
highest figure in the history of tiie
government, amounting to $1.030,2.8,
143, exceeding by $14.707,338 the ex
ports of 1801 and exceeding the value ol
the Imports by $202,876,886. A com
parison ol the value of our exports (or
1892 with the annual average for the
10 years prior to 1891 shows an exce-'s of
|»5,142.671. or of 34 36 percent. The
value of our Imports of merchandise (or
1882, which was $820,4)2,402, also ex
ceeded the annual average value of tiie
10 years prior to 1801 by $125,216,940.
During the fiscal year 1892 the value of
imports, free of duty, amounted to
$167,998,658, the largest aggregate iu
the history of commerce. The value >'
imports ol merchandise entered free ui
duty in 1892 was 55.36 per cent of tiie
total value of imports, as compared
with 43.35 per cent in 1891 and 33.00
per cent in 180J.
In our coastwise trade a most en
couraging development is In progress,
there having been in the last four
years an increase of 16 per cent In in
ternal commerce. The statistics sliow
that no such period of prosperity has
ever before existed. Tbe freight car
ried in the coastwise trade of the great
hikes in 1890 aggregated28,295,060tons.
On the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio
rivers ami tributaries in the same year,
the traffic aggregated 29,404,406 tons,
and the total vessel tonnage passing
through the Detroit river during that
year was 21,684,000 tons. Tiie vessel
tonnage entered and cleared in tiie for
eign triple of Ixmdon during 1890
amounted to 18,480,767 tons, ami of
Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, making the
total for these two great shipping ports
24,422,567 tons, only slightly in excess
of tiie vessel tonnage passing through
tbe Detroit river, and it should lie said
that tiie season for the Detroit river
was but 228 days, while, of course, in
London and Liverpool the season was
for the entire year. The vessel ton
nage passing through the Sault Hte.
Marie canal, for the fiscal year 1892,
amounted to 9,828,864 tons, and tiie
freight tonnage of tbe Detroit river Is
estimated for that year at 26,001, oo
tons, against 23,2 0,619 tons in 1891«
The aggregate traffic on our railroads
for the year ÎH9I amounted to 7 >4,398,
6 9 tons of freight, compared wiili
691,344,437 tons in 189), an increase of
IH,i 64,172 tons.
Another indication of the general
prosperity of the country is found in
the fact that the number of depoHltors
in the savings banks increased from
698,870 In i860 to4,828,303 ill 180', an
increase of 58 percent, ami the amount
of deposits from #104,277,875 ill 186 I to
$1,624,844,6 3 in 1800, an increase of
02 per eent. In 1801 tiie amount of de
posits in the savings banks was #1,023,
079,749. It is estimated that 9) per
cent of these deposits represent the
savings of wage earners. The bank
clearances have for the nine months,
ended September 39, 1801, amounted
to #11,' 49,89 >,8 8. For the same
mont Its in 1892 they amounted to #45,
189,6 1,947, an increase for the nine
months of $4,140,211,130.
There never lias been a time in our
history when work was so abundant,
nor when wages were so high, whether
measured bv the currency in which
they are paid, or by l.lieir power to sup
ply the necessaries and comforts of
life. It is true that the market prices
of cotton ami wheat have been low.
It is one of the unfavorable incidents
of agriculture that the farmer cannot
produce upon orders, lie must sow
and reap in Ignorance of tiie aggregate
production of tiie year, and is pecu
liarly subject to tiie disposition wliici
follows an overproduction. Dut. while
the fact l tiave stated is true us to the
crops I have mentioned, the general
average of prices lias been such as to
give agriculture a fair participation in
general prosperity.
Tbe value of our total farm product:
lias Increased from #1,863,646,860 in 186
to #4,500,000,000 In 1801, as estimated
by statisticians, an Increase of 28 per
cent. The number of bogs .Iannary I
1801 , was 60,526,1' 6, and their value
was #210,198 925; January 1, 1892, Hie
number was 62,398,919, ami their value
$241,081,415. January 1. 180 |, tiie mini
her of cattle was 86,876,648, and the
value $644,127,0 8; January 1, 1x92, the
number was 87,861,289, and their value
»57 ,740,165,
Tariff Talk.
If any are discontented with their
state here, if any believe that Hie
wages or prices, the return for honest
toll, are Inadequate, they should not
fail to remember that there is no other
country in the world where tiie condi
tions that seem to them hard, would
not be accepted ns highly prosperous.
The English agriculturist would be
f jad to exchange tiie returns of ids
abor for those of the American
farmer, and tiie Manchester workmen
thed' wages for those of their fellows
at Fall Hiver. I believe that tiie pro
tective system which now for some
thing like 3 I years has prevailed in our
legislation lias been a mighty instru
ment for (lie development of our na
tional wealth ami a most powerful
agency iu protecting tiie homes of our
workingmen from tiie ivuslou of want.
1 have reit a most solicitous interest to
preserve to our working people rates of
wages that would not only give daily
bread, hut supply a comfortable mar
gin for those home attractions ami
family comforts and enjoyments with
out which life Is neither hopeful nor
sweet. They are American citizens, a
part of the great people for whom our
constitution ami government wore
framed ami instituted, and it cannot
be ii perversion of that constitution to
legislate so as to preserve in their
home« tiie comfort, independence, loy
ally and sense of interest in the gov
ernment which are essential to good
citizenship, in peace, which will bring
them, as iu 1861, to tiie defense of the
ting wheu it is assailed.
It is not my purpose to renew here
tiie argument in favor of a protective
tariff. Tiie result of tiie recent election
must lie accepted as having introduced
a new policy. We must assume that tiie
present tariff, constructed upon the
the lines ol protection, is to 1« repealed,
and that there is to lie substituted (or it
a tariff law constructed solely to reve
nue; that no duty is to be higher lie
cause the increase will keep open an
American mill or keepup the wages«! an
American workingman, but in every
case bucIi a rate ol duty is to lie imposed
as will bring tiie treasury ol the United
States tiie largest revenue. Tiie conten
tion has not been between schedules
but iietween principles, and it would l>e
offensive to suggest that tiie prevailing
party will not carry into legislation tiie
principles advocited by it, and tbe
pledges given the people. The tariff
bills pass,si by the house ol representa
tives at the last session were, as 1 sup
posed, even in the opinion ol their pro
moters, inadequate and justitied only by
tbe fact that the senate and house of
representatives were not iu accord, aud
that a general reviaion could not there
fore lie undertaken. I recommend that
tiie whole subject of tariff revision lie
left to the incoming congress. It is s
matter of regret that this work must tie
delayed for at least three months, for
tiie threat of great ta 'IT change* intro
duces si mu h uruoi teiuty that an
amount, not easily estimated, of busi
neia inaction ami of a diminished pro
duction will necessarily result. It ia
possible also that this uncertainty may
result in decreased revenues from cus
toms duties, for our merchants w ill make
c utious orders for foreign goods, in view
of tiie prospect of tariff reductions aud
U'e uncertainty as to when it will take
- fleet.
Those who tiave advocated a protec
tive tariff can well afford to have their
disaatr ns forecasts of a change of
policy disappointed. If a system of
customs rules can be framed that will
set the idle wheels and looms of Europe
in motion, and crowd our warehouses
with foreign made goods, and at tiie
same time keep onr own mills bu*y;
that will give us an increased participa
ti >n in the "markets of the world," or
a greater value than the home market
that we surrender; that will give in
used work to foieign workmen upon
products to tie consumed by our people
without diminishing the amount of
work to be done here; that will enable
the American manufacturer to pay to
his workmen from 50 to 100 per cent
more in wages than is paid the foreign
mill, and yet to compete in our market
and in foreign markets with tiie foreign
producer; that will farther reduee the
cost of articles of ware and food, with
iut reducing the wages Of those wli •
prndnee them ; that can be celebrated
after its effects have been realised, as
ita expectation lias been in Europe as
well as in American cities, the authors
and promoters of it will lie cnfitled to
the highest praise.
We have had in onr history several
experiences of tiie contrasted effects of
a revenue and of a protective tariff, but
this generation has not felt them and
the experience of one generation is not
highly instructive to the next. Tiie
friends of the protective system, wit.li
tindimini bed confidence in tiie princi
ples they have advocated, will wait the
results of the new expsrlment. The
strained and too often disturbed rela
tions existing between the employe and
the employer inonrgreat manufacturing
establishments have not teen favorable
to a calm consideration by the wage
earners of tiie effect upon wages of tlio
protective system. The fact that his
wages were the highest paid in like call
ing in any part of the world, and that a
maintenance of this rate of wages in the
absence of protective duties upon the
product of his labor was-impossible,
were ohacured by the passion evoked by
these conte-ts. He may now lie able to
review the question in'the light of his
per*onal experience, nnder the opera
tion of a tariff for revenue only.
If that experience shall demonstrate
that the present rates of wages nre
thereby maintained or increased, either
absolutely or in their purchasing power ;
that the aggregate volume of work to be
done in this country is increased, or
even maintained ; that there are more,
or as many, days' work in a year, at as
good or Iwtter wages, received by the
American workman, as has been the
case under the protective system, every
one will rejoice. A general process of
wage-reduction cannot, be contemplated
by any patriotic citizen without the
gravest apprehension. It may lie,
indeed, I believe, is, possible (or the
American manufacturer to compete suc
cessfully with his foreign rival in many
branches of production without the
defense of protective duties, if the pav
rolls are equalizid ; hut the conflict tlia'
s'auds Iietween tiie producer and that
result, and the distress of onr woring
men when it is attained, are not pleas
ant to contemplate. Tiie society of the
unemployed, now holding its frequent
and threatening parades in tho streets
of foreign cities, would not be allowed
to acquire an American domicile.
A Resume of the Administration.
The reports of the heads of the sev
eral executive departments, which are
herewith submitted, have very naturally
included a resume of the whole work ol
the ndminis ration and the transaction"
of tiie last fiscal year. Tiie attention
not only of congres*, but of the country,
is again invited to the methods of the
administration which have been pur
sued, and to tiie results which have been
attained. Public revenues, amounting
to $1,414,079,292, have been collected
arid disbursed without loss irom misap
propriat on, without a single defalcation
of auch importance as to at raet tiie puli
lie attention, and at a dim nislied per
cent ol cost for collection. The public
business lias been transacted not only
with fidelity, bill with progression, and
with a v ew to giv ng to tiie people, in
tiie fullest possible degree, the tienefits
of tiie service established and maintained
for their protection and comfort.
Stale Department.
Our relations with other nations are
now undisturbed by any serious con
troversy. The complicated and threat
ening differences with Germany and
England relating to Samoan affairs,
with England in relation to the seal
fisheries in the Behring sea, and with
Chili growing out of the Baltimore af
sair, have been ad justed. There have
been negotiated and concluded under
section 3 of tiie tariff law, commercial
agreements relating to reciprocity
trade with tiie following countries:
Brazil, Domingo Republic, Spain for
Cuba and Puerto Rico, Guatemala,
Salvador, the German empire. Great
Britain lor certain West Indian colo
nies and British Guiana. Nicaragua
Honduras and Austria-Hungary. Of
these, those with Guatemala, Salvador,
tiie German empire, Great Britain, Nic
aragua, f loud mas and Austria-Hungary
have been concluded since my last att
'ue sage. Under these treaty ar
rangements a free, and favored admis
sion lias been secured in every case for
an important listof American products
Especial care lias been taken to secure
markets for farm products in order to
relieve that great underlying industry
of the depression which the lack of an
adequate foreign market for our sur
plus often brings. An opening lias
also been made for manufactured prod
ucts that will undoubtedly, if this pol
icy is maintained, greatly augment our
export trade. Tiie full benefits of these
arrangements cannot be realized in
stantly. New lines of trade are to lie
opened, and tiie commercial traveler
must survey tiie field, the manufac
turer must adapt bis goods to tiie new
markets, and facilities for exchange
must be established. This work lias
been well begun; our merchants and
I................. have entered tiie new
fields with courage and enterprise. In
the case of food products, and espe
ciully with Cuba, the trade did not
need to wait, and tlit* immediate re
sults have been most gratifying. II
this policy and tiie trade arrangements
can lie continued in force and aided In
the establishment of American steam
ship lines, l do not doubt we shall,
within a short period, secure fully one
third of tiie total trade of tiie countries
of Central and South America, which
now amounts to about »6 MpMOpiOO. In
1X65 we had only aliou x per cent of this
trade. Tbe following statistics show
tiie increase in our trade with the
countries with which we have reciproc
By trade agreements from tiie date
wheu such agreements went Into effect
up to September 3 '. 1X02, the increase
being iu some almost wholly, and iu
others in an important degree, the re
sult of tiie agreement.
Tim domestic exports to Germany
and Austria-Hungary have increased
in value from $47,673,756 to $57,993,' 64,
an increase of $1 ',310,3 8, or 621.( 3 pel
cent. With American countries the
value of our exports lias increased
from $44,16 i.2Si to $54,613,608, an in
crease of $10,463,353, oi 23 67 per cent.
The total increase in value of exports
to all the countries with which we have
reciprocity agreements has been »2 \
772,671. This increase is chiefly in
wheat, flour, meat and dairy products,
and manufactures of iron and steel
and lumber. There lias been a large
increase in the value of imports from
ail these countries since tiie commer
cial agreements went into effect,
amounting to $74,294,525, hut it has
been entirely in imports from the
American countries,consisting mostly
of sugar, coffee, India rubber and crude
drugs. The alarmed attention of our
European competitors for the South
American market lias been attracted
to this new American policy and to
our acquisition and their loss of the
South American trade.
The Seel Fisheries.
A treaty providing for tiie arbitra
tion of the dispute between Great
Britain and the United States as to tiie
killing of seals in tiie Behring sea was
concluded on the 29thof Feorvary last.
This treaty was accompanied by an
agreement prohibiting pt-iagic scaling
pending the arbitration, and a vigor
ous effort was made during this season
to drive out all poaching steamers from
tiie Behring sea. Six naval vessels,
three revenue cutters and one vessel
from the fish commission, all under the
command of Commander Evans, of the
navy, were sent into the sea, all of
which were systematically patrolled.
Some seizures were made, and it iB be
lieved the catch in the Behring sea by
poachers amounted to less than 5 a)
seals. It is true, however, that in Ute
Northern I'ncilic, while the seal herds
were on their way lo their passes be
tween tiie Aleutian islands, a very
large number, probably 35,' (4 ', were
taken. The existing statutes of the
United States do not restrain our citi
zens from taking seals in the Pacific
ocean, and perhaps should not until
the prohibition can he extended to the
citizens of other nations. I recom
mend that power he given the presi
dent by proclamation to prohibit the
landing of seals in tiie North Pacific
by American vessels. As to the result
of the findings of tiie tribunal of arbi
tration or otherwise, tiie restraints can
lie supplied to the vessels of all
countries. Tiie case of the United
States for tiie tribunal of arbitration
lias been prepared with great care and
industry by the lion. John W. Foster,
and tiie counsel wiio represents this
government express confidence that a
result substantially establishing our
claims and preserving this great in
dustry to tiie benetitof all nations will
he attained.
Tli« Nic,$rMKua ('anal.
I repeat with great earnestness the
recommendation, o( whicti I have made
mention in previous mssta^es, to the
inadequate support given the American
company engaged in the construction of
the Nicaragua ship canal. It is impos
Bible to overstate the value from every
standpoint of this great enterprise, and
1 hope that there may be a recognition
in this congress to give to it an impetus
that will in-nre an early completion of
the canal and secure to the United
States its proper relations to it wheu
completed.
Tlio Monet«» y Conference.
Congress has been already advised
that the invitations of this government
for the assembling of an international
monetary conference, to consider the
question oi an enlarged issuo ot silver,
were accepted i y the nationB to which
they were issued. The con erence as
eembted at Brussels November 22, and
lias entered upon the consideration of
this great question. I have not doubted
and have taken occasion to express tha'
belief, as well in the invitations isäiied
for the conferenoe as in my public
messages, that the free coinage of si ver,
upon agreed international ratio, would
probably promote the intereets of our
people in oquahty to those of other
nations. It is too early to predict what
results may be accomplished by the
conference. If any temporary check or
delay intervene*, I believe that very
soon commercial conditions will compel
the now reluctant governments to nn te
with us in tins movement to secure the
enlargement of the volume of monev
needed for the transaction of the busi
ness oi the world.
Tin* Treasury Department,
The report of the secretary of the
treasury will attract eBpecial interest, in
view of the many misleading statements
that have been made as to the Btate of
the public revenue. Three preliminary
facts should nit only be stated, but eib
phasized, before looking into details.
They are :
First—That the pub ic debt has been
reduced since March 4, 1889, #259,074,
200, and the annual interest charges *! 1,
634,469.
Second—That there lias been paid out
for p nsions during this administration,
up to November 1, 1892, $432,564,178, an
excess of #! 14,466 307 over the sum ex
pended during tiie period from March 1,
1885, to M arch 1, 1889.
Third—That under the existing tariff,
up to December 1 about $93,000,000 of
revenue, which would have been col
lected upon imported sugars if the duty
had been maintained, has gone into the
pockets of tiie people, and not. into the
public treasury as before.
If there are any who still think that
the surplus should have been kept out
of circulation by boarding it in the
treasury, or depositing it iu the bants.*
without interest, while the government
continued to pav the very banks interest
upon the h mils deposited as security for
the deposit*, or who thinks the extended
pension legislation was a public robbery.
>r t liât the duties upon sugar should
have been maintained, I am content to
leave the argument where it now rests
while we wait to see whether these crit
'denis will take tiie form of legislation.
The revenues and expenditures for

from all sources, were:

There were paid during the year upon
the public debt $49,57 ,167 08. The
surplus in the treasury and the bank
redemption fund, passed by tiie act of
July 14, 1x9 >, to tiie general fund, fur
nished, in a targe part, the casli avail
able, and was used for tbe payments
made upon the public debt. Compared
with the year isoi, our receipts from
customs dues fell off $42/69,2!!. while
our receipts from internal revenue in
creased $6,284,823, leaving the loss of
revenue from these principal sources
$88,1,-4,418. The net loss of revenue
from ail sources was $32,675,973. The
revenues and expenditures, estimated
and actual, for the fiscal year ending
June 3', 1x98, are placed by the secre
tary as follows:

Tiie cash balance in tiie treasury at
the end of tiie lisoil year, it is eBli
mate.1, will be $20,992,377. So far as
these figures are based on estimate ol
receipts and expenditures for the remain
ing mouths of the current fiscal year,
here are uot the usual elements of un
certainty, but some added elements of
new revenus legislation, or even the
expectation of it, seriou*ly reduce the
oublie revenue during the period ol un
certainty, and during the press of busi
ness adjustment to the new condition
when they become known.
But the secretary has very wisely re
fra ned from guessing as to the effect of
possible changes in our revenue laws
since the scope of these changes, and
the time of their taking effect, cannot in
my degree lie forecast or foretold by
him; his estimate must be based upon
existing laws and upon a continuance of
existing business conditions, except ao
far as these con litions may be uflYc.ed
by causes other than new legislation.
The estimated receipts of appropria
tions for the fiscal year ending June .it),
1894, are :
Receipts ............................................'iw'an'W
Appropriations...................................
surplus of ecelpts.......................... «gunks »
This does not include any payment of
the sinking fond. The re: ommendat on
of the secietary that the sinking fund
law he repealed I concur in.
The redemption of bonds since the
passage of the law to June 30, 1892, has
already exceeded tiie requirements by
the sum of »99 ),610,681. The retirement
of bonds in the (nture before maturity
should l>e a matter of convenience, not
of compn'siou. We should not. collect
revenue for that purpose, but only use
the casual surplus. To tiie balance of
$82,860,030 of receipts over expenditures
for the year 1894 should be added the
e: timated aurplufl at tlio beginning of
tiie y-ar, $2 1,922,377; ami from this ag
gregate there must be deducted, ae
stated by the secretary, about #44,000,
000 of estimated nnexp'red appropria
tions.
The public confidence in the purposes
and ability of tiie g ivernment to main
tain the parity ol all our money issues,
whether co'n or paper, must remain un
shaken. Tiie demand for gold in Eu
rope, the consequent ills wli oh falj upon
us, are in a considerable degree the re
sult of the efforts of some of tiie Euro
pean governments to increase their gold
reserves, and thete efforts should be met
by appropriations upon our part. The
conditions that have created this drain
on the treasury gold are in an import
ant degree political, and not commer
cial. In view oi the fact t liât a gener.il
revision of our revenue laws in the near
future seems to be probable, it would be
better that any changes should be a part
of that revision rather than of a te:ii|io
rary nature.
During the last fiscal year the secre
tary purchased, under the act ot July
14, 1890, 54,336,748 ounces of silver, and
issued in payment therefor $51,106,608
in notes. The total purchase* since the
passage of the act have been 120,479,981
ounc s, and the aggregate of notes issued
#116 783,599. The average price paid for
silver during the year was 94 cents per
ounce, the highest being $1 02%, July 1,
1891, and the lowest 83 cents, March 21,
1892. In view of the fact that the mon
etary conference is now sitting, and that
no conclusion has as yet been reached, I
withhold any recommendation as to the
legislation upon this eubj et.
Tile Interior Department.

always \ ery burdensome, lias been larger

pension law, the taking of the 11th cen
sus, the opening of vast areas of Indian
lands to settlement, the organization of
Oklahoma and the negot ations for the
cession of Indian land*, furnish some ot
the pvrt'culars of the increased work,
and the results achieved testify to the
ability, fidelity and industry of the head
of the department and his efficient as
sistants. Several important agreement*
for the cession negotiated by the Iowa
commission appointed under act of
March 2, I8 a 9, are awaiting the act of
congress, l'erhaps tiie most important
of these is that for tiie cession of tiie
Cherokee strip. T iia has been a source
of great vexati n to the executive rep
resentatives, from the great friction in
ured between the settlers in their de
sire to occupy it and the Indians who
assert title. The agreement which has
been made by tiie commission is, per
haps, the most satisfactory that could
have been reached. It will be noticed
that it is conditioned upon its ratifica
tion by congress be ore March 4, 1893
Tiie secretary of the iuterior, who has
given the subject careful thou ht, recom
mends tbe ra'ification of tiie agreement
nd was inclined to follow this recom
meudatfon. It is certain that some ac
tion by which this con'roversv shall be
brought to an end and the lands opened
to settlement is urgent.
The form of government provided by
congress on May 17, 1884, for Alaska was
in its frame and purpo-e temporary.
The increase of popu ation and develop
ment of some important mining and
commercial imprests makeit imperative
that tiie law should be revised and bet
ter provision made for the arrest and
punishment of criminals.
The War Department.
The report of the sécrétai y of war
brings again to theattenton ot congress
some important suggestions as to the
reorganization of the infantrv and artil
lery arms of the service, which his pre
decessors have before urged be passed.
Our army is small, but its organization
should ail the more be put upon the
most approved modern basis. The
conditions upon what we have cal ed
the "irontiei" have beietofore required
the maintenance of many email posts,
but now tiie policy of concentration is
obviously the right one. The new post
should have the proper strategic re
lations to the only "frontiers" we no«
have, those of the West and North, and
a part of our Southern boundary. I do
not think that any questions of advan
tage in localities or states should deter
mine the location of the new posts.
The organization and enlargement of
the bureau of military in ormation
«di ch tiie secretary has undertaken, is
a work the usefulness of which will be
come every day more apparent. The
work of building heavy euns and the
construction of coast defenses lia* been
well begun, and should be carried on
without cheek.
I'oMtofftce Department.
I he report of the postmaster-genera!
shows a moat gratifying increase and a
most efficient and progressive manage*
ment of tiie great business of that de
partment. Tue remarkable increase in
revenues ia the number of postotfic*?
and in tiie miles of miil interchange
furnishes another evidence of the high
state oi the prosperity which our people
are enjoying. New offices mean ns«
hamlets and towns; new routes mean the
extension of our border settlements and
increased revenues mean active com
merce. lhe postmaster-general review
the who e period of his administra tion
of the office, and brings some of his sta
tistic.* down to the month of November
last. Toe postal revenues have in
creased during tbe last year nearly #5
000,000. The deficit for tiie year ending
June 30. 1892. is #848,341 less than the
deficiency ol the preceding year The
deficiency of the present fiscal vear it
'8 estimated, will be reduced to #1 7,V>.
423, which will not only be extinguishe'i
during the next fiscal year, but a sur
plus of nearly #1,000,600 should be
shown.
The Navy Department.
The report of live secretarvof the navv
exhibits great progress in the conslruc
tion of our new navy. When the pres
eut secretary entered upon his dutie*
only three modern steel vessels were iV
commission. The vessels since put in
commission, and to be put in commis
ston during the winter, will make a tota
of 1J during his administration of the
department. Daring the carrent vear 1*
war vessels and three navy tugs have
been launched Two other large ship*
and a torpedo boat are under contract
and the wo k upon them will be rapidly
advanced. The four monitors are awai tine
only tire arrival of their armor, which
has been unexpectedly delayed, or they
won d have been before this commission
Contracts have been let during this ad
ministration, under tiie appropriations,
for sn increase of the navy, including
new v issels and their appurtenances, to
tiie amount of #37,000,00«, Mid there
have been expended during the same
period for labor at tbe navy-yards upon
similar work $8,000,000, without tbe
smallest scandal or charge of fraud or
partiality. The enthusiasm and interest
of our naval officers, both of the «tan
Rod line, have been greatly kindled.
Tney tiave responded magnificently to
tiie confidence of congress, and nave
demonstrated to the world an unexcelled
capacity to construct in ordnance and
in everything involved in tbe building,
equ'pment aud sailing of great warships.
Tho IVimlon Uarean.
I have felt that I would uot be justified
in noting, without some new expression
of the legislative will, the report of the
commissioner of pensions, to which ex
tended notices given by the secretary ol
the interior in his report will attract at
tention. Judged by the aggregate
amount of work done, the last year has
iieen the greate-t in the history of the
office. I believe that the organization
of tiie office is efficient, and that the
work has been done with fidelity. The
passage of what ia now known as
tiie debility b 11 has, as was foreseen,
very largely increased the annua! dis
bursements to the disabled veterans of
the civil war. Tlio rstimate of h.s fis
cal year was #144,966,000, and that
amount was appropriated. A deflcienc;
amounting to #10,078,621 must be pro
v.tied (or at this season. The estimates
for pensions of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1894, is #1 6,000.000. The com
missioner of pensions believes that il
the present legislation and metliods are
maintained, and further additions to tire
pens ons are not made, the maximum
expenditure for pensions will be reached
June 30. 1894, and will be at the highest
point—#188,000,000 per annum. I ad
here to the views expressed :n previous
messages, that tiie care oi the dieabled
soldiers of tbe war of the Rebellion is a
mai ter of na ional concern aud duty.
Perhaps no emotion cools sooner than
that of gratitude, but I cannot lelieve
that this process has yet reached a po : nt
with our people that would sustain lhe
policy of remitting the care of these dis
abled veterans to the nadequate agen
cieB provided by local laws. The parade
on September 20 last upon tire s:rests o
tide capital of 361,060 of tire surviving
Union veterans of the war of the R*bel
lion was a most touching and thrilling
episode, and the rich and gracious wel
come extended to them by the I) strict
of Columbia and the applause that
greeted their progress from tens ot
ihousanis of people from all the atatrs
did much to revive the recollection of
the grand review when these men and
n suy thousand others, now in tl e r
graves, were welcomed witli grateful joy
as the victors in a struggle in which the
national unity, honor and wealth were
at issue.__
Union Pacific liailroml.
In my last annual message I called at
tention to the fact that some executive
action was necessary in order to protect
the interests of the government in its
relations with the Union Pacific railway.
The commissioner of railroads has sub
mitted a very full report, giving exact
information as to the debt, the liens
upon the company's property and ite
resources. We must deal «'ith the
question as we find it and take that
course which wil), under existing Con
di ions, best secure the intereets of the
United States. 1 recommended in my
last annual message that, a commission
hoappoin ed to deal with this que tion,
and I renew that recommendation, and
I suggest that the commission be given
full power. ___
Agricultural Departinci t.
T ie report ot the secretary of agricul
ture containe not only a most intere.'-t
ing statement of t e progressive and
valuable wo k done under the adminis
tration of Secretary Rosk, but many
suggestions for the enlarged usefnlmBs
of this important department. Ia the
successful effort to break down toe re
strictions to the free iutro iuction of our
meat products in the countries of Eu
rope, the secretary has been untiring
from the first, stimulating and*aiding
all other government officials at home
and abroad whose official duties enabled
them to partie pate in the work. Tiie
ictal trade in home products with Eu
rope in May, 1892, amounted to 82,( 190 ,
IHO pounds, against 46 9 i0,0»)0 in the
same month of 1891. In June, 1892, th
exports aggregated 85,600,0(H) pounds
against 46,000,0 0 pounds in the sain
month of the previous year; iu July
there was increase of 41 per cent, and in
August of 55 per cent over the corre
sponding months of 1891. Over 40,000,
000 pounds of inspected pork have been
exported since tlie law was put iuto
ojieration, and a comparison of the foui
months of May, June, July and August,
1812 , with tiie same months of 1891
shows an increase in the number of
pounds of our exports of pork products
of 62 per cent, and an increase of all of
fitj 1 .j percent.
, lhe exjworts of dressed beef increased
,! 37 ' il0 ' ,,u0 , pounds in 1889, to
220,5,0,' 00 pounds in 1892, or about 60
P»r cent. During the past year there
have iieen exported 394,6 '7 head of cat
tie, against 2 5,736 exported in 1889
une increased exportation has been
largely promoted by the inspection au
thorrzed by law, and the faithful efforts
of the secretary and his official subordi
nates to make that inspection thorough
