could not stand, having lost tho use of lej

followed. The nervous system was wrecked,
muscles contracted, and there was general
wasting of flesh aud muscle. At olghtccn
months of age she was placed under the
treatment of a prominent physician of Bos

bad declined to such a degree that she was in
a dying condition. This was in April, !SML
We took the child away nct'knowlng what
to do. In this drealful dilemma we were
over-persuaded by friemis to try " one bot

before It had all been taken we saw a change
for the better la her symptoms. Wo kept it
up, and have done so to this day, and will
keep It up. If the Lord wills, for many Caya

HOSE FOR THK FRIENDLESS.
Twenty-First Annual Meeting or
the Beard of Managers Encour
aclnx Reports Knlnrgtnc the
ll.me-Worlt That Ilaa sseem Done
Darlnsr the Past Year Election or
Officers.
The board of managers of the Home for
the Friendless held their twenty-first annual
meeting yesterday afternoon in the Center
church chapel. There was a good attend
ance. The report of the secretary, Mrs. Samnel
Harris, was heard. She referred to the work
done daring the past year at the Home and it
was felt that it had been a year of prosperity.
The matron has devoted herself in a most
useful manner to her duties at the Home.
Neatness and order prevail, making it a de
sirable place for those who otherwise would
roam about unprotected and nncared for.
Mrs. Harris cited several instances of the
past year where people had been taken in
and of the good that had been done. The
health of the children has been good. The
assistant matron has done her part well in
taking care of the small children in the
nursery. She teaches them verses from the
scriptures and hymns to sing. There is a
Sunday school for the children, conducted
by Mrs. Beebe, and a Bible class which is
still in the hands of Mrs. S. D. Phelps, whose
labors are highly appreciated. There is also
a class for the adults, which is conducted by
one of the members of the different church
es each Sunday. Gratitude is extended to
the press of the city for its kindness and
courtesy. One of the principal things to be
done now is the enlarging of the home. An
other addition should be made, ft is now
too small to accommodate the number of
older women. This is one of the necessities
of the coming year. The home should be
enlarged as soon as possible. This can only
be done by donations, and it is earnestly
hoped that we will not be forgotten in this
respect by our oitizens. It is to be hoped
that they will continue to donate as they
have in the past. The Home has already ac
complished a great good, and it should be re
membered in the wills of our wealthy citi
zens. As we look forward to another year
we are encouraged, tor the Jttoms is be tter
prepared than ever for its much needed
work.
Rev. Phebe A. Hanaford, who had been
the visitor to the home from the board of
managers during November, being called
upon for her report, stated that she had vis
ited the home five times and was greatly
pleased with the cleanliness, eoonomy and
thrift evident. She referred to the little
children who are tenderly cared for, and to
the aged women who are spending peacefully
their last days in this comfortable home, and
appealed in behalf of the matron that one
article for her comfort (viz: a wardrobe for
her own room, in which there is no closet)
should be donated by some benevolent per
son. She also added an earnest "Amen" to
the appeal of the secretary, Mrs. Dr. Harris,
that the amount necessary for the erection of
a home for the aged should be raised as soon
as possible, and that the Home should be re
membered in the wills of our wealthy resi
dents, as it is an institution which has al
ready accomplished great good.
The report of Mrs. MoAlister. the visitor
from the executive committee, was also read
by Mrs. Hanaford and gave many intereetmg
aetans concerning the Home, and the fore
sight and thrift of the energetic matron,
urs. wiieox.
The report of Mrs. Timothy Cowles showed
that the riome was in a most prosperous con
dition.

ensuing year :

on Grand avenue. There was a large attend
ance Cf representatives from all parts of the
State. The sessions were presided over by
T. H. L. Tallcott, Esq., of Glastonbury,
grand worthy templar. The reports of the
various officers showed the order to be in
excellent condition, there being a healthy
increase in membership. A new temple was
organized last week at Cromwell with twenty
one charter members. Means and measures
were adopted for an aggressive propagation
work and it is expected that several new
temples will be organized during the winter.

gaged on a very neat souvenir for the ball in
the shape of a book giving brief histories of
the veteran volunteer fire department and
the Veteran association, for gratuitous circu
lation. Wait for the Veteran Firemen's ball.
Tho Homeliest man on Earth.
The editor of a paper in Dubuque, Iowa,
ones handsome, was a little over six months
ago changed into probably the homeliest man
on earth. This terrible change was due to a
sudden attack of paralysis of the muscles of
one aide of the face, following prolonged
neuralgia. After electricity and the doctors
had failed he tried Dr. Bnckland's Essence of
Scotch Oats, and in thirty days was peiieotlv
cared, and lost the unenviable notoriety of
ibeing the homeliest man on earth. , : . .

THKTCK YEARS AT HARD LABOR.

of the United States court in session at Hartford to
three years' imprisonment at hard labor at Weth
ersfield. He has already served a term of three

CONTINENT At. LIFE'S ASSETS.
Insurance Commissioner Fyler places the assets
of the Continental Life 'of Hartford at $1,333,000 in
round numbers, and the liabilities $3,070,000. The
investigation has reduced the assets $1,077,000 as
compared with the company's report January 1.
The real estate is weighted with mortgages, and in
many cases the equity in the property will not net a
dollar. Tho shrinkage in the Sharp's works at
Bridgeport a'one is $175,000. Policies which have
been cancelled during the year, reducing liabilities
$--!5,0C0, will have to be restored, the company hav
ing no right to abrogate them. Commissioner Fy
ler is confident that the petition for a receivership
will be granted by the court. The hearing is as
signed for Saturday, before Judge Carpenter of the
oupreme court, rresiaeni rarsons nas been ab
sent Irom the city since his resignation last weetc.
A criminal prosecution against him is not unlikely
to result irom cue investigation.

charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to
twelve months in the Couuty jail and fined one dol

The Supreme court has handed down a deci-ion hi
the case of Thomas D. Daly vs. Edwin O. Dimock
that upsets the long accepted ruling that the evi
dence taken bef ere a coroner is solely for the use of
the State's attorney. Daly, the plaintiff in this
case,is under indicnnent for the murder of his hired
man, and his attorney a-ked to see the evidence
brought out before the coroner. Dimock, the clerk
of the Superior court, refused to produce the evi
dence aud the matter was by mutual consent sub
mitted to the Supreme court, which now decides in
tavor oi iaiy.

Reply to aa Enquirer.
To the Editor of the Journal and Courier:
In your Monday morning issue is a com
munication nnder the caption of "An En
quiry," which would indicate that the writer
was unaware that such a meeting as he con
siders desirable has been held for almost a
year, last season in Calvary Baptist church
and this Tallin Center church chapel until
the present week. A committee is now en
deavoring to secure another and still more
central place and the result will be an
TUB COURT
nounced in the Saturday papers. This meet
ing is attended by two hundred teachers and
others, as indicated by the general average.
Blanks for taking notes of illustrations, ref
erences, orientalisms, etc., are furnished at
each meeting.
Either your correspondent is unaware of
the facts of the meeting at Tremont Temple
or somewhat ambignous in expression. The
great meeting for Bible study at Tremont
Temple, formerly led by the Eev. Meredith,
D. D., and now by the Christian novelist
George W. Cable, is not held Sunday after
noons, but Saturdays, and follows the inter
national S. S. lessons, aa does the one held
in New Haven, also another fact which does
not appear upon the surface relating to the
thousands who do not know how to spend
the afternoon profitably, and that is the
large number who attend the temple meet
ings are recruited considerably from
surrounding places. The idea advanced by
your correspondent is a good one and hearti
ly coincided with by a large number of the
active Bible students of the city, as is shown
by the fact that a committee of ladies and
substantial business men of New Haven are
already supporting such a meeting. Let all
unite in pushing the work.
DR. U'BIALLEY INNOCENT.
RHse Annie Davis Swear That
She
Has Falsely Accused Him.
A dispatch from Wilkesbarre yesterday
morning fully confirms the dispatoh of a sim.
liar nature published in our issue of Decem
ber 5. Dr. James O'Malley is vindicated. He
is not guilty of the operation he is reputed as
having performed on Annie Davis. The girl
herself has made an affidavit to this effect.
According to Dr. E. S. Hayes, the physi
cian who attended Miss Davis during her
recent illness, it was while his patient was
nnder the influence of morphine that she
made the statement which temporarily
proved so injurious to Dr. O'Malley's reputa
tion.
Dr. O'Malley aud his family claim that the
entire scheme was concocted by parties who
are lealous of the doctor s professional stand
ing and influence. They emphatically declare
that while the innocence of the accused can
be established bevond the shadow of a doub:
the damage already done can hardly ever be
thoroughly repaired.
Miss Davis' affidavit with great detcil sets
forth that deponent is ol sound mind and
memory, and that she has no recolleotion
whatever of any sworn statements made by
her last month before any justice of the
peace. She declares the sworn statement
purporting to be made by her about Dr,
O'Malley of Pittston "utterly false and un
true."

great winter resorts of the Pacific coast.

The Bear Hard at Work-Ther t7se
Cleveland' message to Hammer tne
market A. Covering Movement
Toward the Close Orlngs Price
Baelc a Trifle.
. New Tore, Dec. 7.
The bears used the President's message to-day as
a means for hammering stocks. Their operations
were confined to a few leading properties, however,
Union Pacific, St. Paul, Lackawanna, Reading and
Richmond and West Point being most prominent.
These five stocks furnished the great bulk of the
dealings, while the remainder were quiet to dall
throughout. London bought a little in the morning
and there were scale orders to buy, which pi-evemed
any material decline during the forenoon, but made
the dealings irregular. The persistent attacks cf
the bears began to tell later in the day, though a
covering movement brought prices up a fraction
from the lowest figures. Among the specialties
Manhattan was sold down'on a revival of the stock
on the passing of the dividend and Wheeling and
Lake Erie 2 per cent., though most of this was re
covered afterward.
