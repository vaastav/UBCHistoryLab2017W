Bp( : cll . l . ed - This plan would apply to ad-
LnVumin 10 the , service ou] y iu it a lowest grade
c ! +( and C ? rdm e‘- V dema nd that all vacan
r e positions should be filled by
J motion alone. In these particulars it is in
conformity with the existing civil service sys
ttJoi of Great Biitain and indeed the success
which has attended that system in the
country of its birth is the strongest
argument which has been urged for its adop
tion here. The fact should not, however, be
overlooked that thre are certain features of
the English system which have not generally
been received with favor in this country even
among the foremost advocates of civil service
reform. Among them are first, a tenure of
office which is substantially a life ten
ure. Second, a limitation of the maximum
age at which an applicant can outer the service
u hereby ail men in middle life or under arc
with some exceptions, rigidly excluded; third, a
retiring allowance upon going out of service.
Ihcse three elements are as important factors
of the problem as any of the others. To elim
inate therefrom the English system would effect
a most radical change in its theory and
practice. The avowed purpose of that
system is to induce the educated vonng
men of the country to devote their lives to the
public employment by an assurance that having
once entered upon it they never need leave it and
that after voluntary retirement they shall be
the recipients of an annual pension. * That this
system as an entuety has proved very success
ful in Great Britain seems to he generally con
ceded, even by those who once opposed its
adoption. To a statute which should incorpo
rate all its essential features I should feel
bound to give my approval but whether it
would be for the best mterest of the public
to fix upon an expedient for an immediate
extensive application which embraces certain
features of the English system, but excludes
or ignores others of equal importance, may be
strenuously doubted even hy those who are im
pressed as I am with the grave importance of
correcting the evils which inherit from thefireront
methods of appointment. For example: The
English rale which shuts out persons above tire
age of 25 years from a large number of public
employments should not to be made an essen
tial part of our system. It is ouestiouable
whether the attainment of the highest num
ber of marks at a competitive examination
should be the criterion bv which applications
for appointment should be put to test, and
under similar conditions may also be questioned
whether admission to the service should be
strictly limited to its lowest ranks. There are
ve? y many characteristics which go to make a
model civil servant, and prominent among
them are probity, industry, goodness,
good habits, good temper, patience,
order, courtesy, tact, self-reliance, manly
deference to superior officers and manly con
siderations fOr inferiors. The absence of these
traits is not supplied by a wide knowledge of
books, or by promptitude in answering ques
tions, or by any other quality likely to be
brought to light by a competitive examination.
To make a success in such contests, therefore,
an indispensible condition of public employ
ment would very likely result in the exclusion of
the older applicants, even though they might
possess qualifications far superior to their
younger and more brilliant comoeti
tors. These suggestions must not be re
garded as evincing any spirit of
opposition to the competitive plan, which has
been to some extent successfully employed al
ready, and which may hereafter vindicate the
claims of its most earnest supporters: but it
ought to be seriously considered whether the
application of the same educational standard
to persons of mature years, to young men fresh
from school and college, would not be likely to
exalt mere intellectual proficiency above other
qualities of equal or greater importance.
Another feature of the proposed system
is the selection by promotion of all
officers of the government above the
lowest grade, except such as would fairly be
regarded as exponents of the policy of* the
executive and the principles of the dominant
party. To afford encouragement to faith
ful public servants by exciting in their minds
the hope of promotion if they are found to
merit it is much to be desired; but would it be |
wise to adopt a rule so rigid as to permit no I
other mode of supplying the intermediate walks
of the service ? There are many persons who i
till subordinate positions with great credit but
lack those qualities which are requisite for j
higher posts of duty; and besides the mod*- of
thought and action of one whose service !
iu a governmental bureau has beeu long con
tinued are often so cramped by routine proceed
ing as almost to disqualify him from instituting j
the changes required by the public interests,
and an infusion of new blood from time to time ;
into the middle ranks of the service might be
very beneficial in its results. The subject tin- j
der discussion is one of grave importance. The '
errors which are complained of caunot be erad
icated at ence. The work must be gradual.
The present English system is a growth of
years and was not created by a single stroke of
executive or legislative action. Its beginning i
is found in an order in the council promulga !
ted in 1855, and it was after patient and cau
tious scrutiny of its workings that, fifteen years ;
later, it took its present shape. Five years after I
the issuance of the order in council and at a |
time when resort had been to competitive ex
amination as an experiment much more exten
sively than has yet been the case in this coun- ,
try, a select committee of the house of ;
commons made a report to that j
house which declaring its approval cf the com
petitve method deprecated nevertheless any
precipitancy iu its genera! adoption as likely to i
endanger its ultimate success. During this ,
tentative period the results of the two methods
of pass examination and competitive examina- i
tion was closely watched and compared. It
mav be that before we confine ourselves upon
this important question within the stringent
bounds.of statutory enactment we may profit
ably await the result of further inquiry and
experiment. The submission of a portion of
the nominations to a central board of
examiners selected solely for testing the qnali
fications of applicants may perhaps, without re- I
sort to the competitive test put an end to the i
mischief which attends the present system of
appointment, and it may be feasible to vest in
such a board a wide discretion to ascertain the
characteristics and attainments of the candi
dates in these particulars which I have already
referred to as bring no less important than
tha mere intellectual attainment. If congress
should deem it advisable at the present session
to establish competitive tests for admission to
the service, no doubts such as have
been suggested shall deter me from
giving the measure my earnest support,
and I urgently recommend that should there
be a failure to pass any other act on this sub
ject, an appropriation of $25,000 per year be
made for tlie enforcement of section 1,753 of
the revised statutes. With the aid thus afford
ed me I shall strive to execute the provisions
of that law according to its letter and spirit.
I am unwilling in justice to the present civil ser
vants of the government to dismiss this subject
without declaring my dissent from the severe
and almost indiscriminate censure with which
they have been recently assaulted. That they
are as a class indolent, inefficient and corrupt
is a statement which has beeu often made and
widely credited; but when the extent, variety,
delicacy nd importance of their duties are con
sidered", tue great majority of the employes of
the government are, iu my judgment, deserving
of high commendation.
MERCHANT MARINE.
The continned decline of the merchant ma
rine of the United States is to be greatly de
plored. In view of the fact that we furnish so
large a proportion of the freights of the com
mercial world, and that our shipments are
steadily and radidly increasing, it is a cause of
surprise that not only is our navigation interest
diminishing, but it is less than when our ex
ports and imports were not half so large as
now, either in bulk or in value. There must
be some peculiar hinderance to the develop
ment of this interest, or the enterprise and
energy of American mechanics and capitalists
would have kept this country at least
abreast of our rivals in the friendly contest for
ocean supremacy. The substitution of iron for
wood and of ste*m for sail have wrought great
revolutions in the carrying trade of the world,
but those changes could not have teen adverse
to America if we had given to our navigation
interests a portion of the aid in protection
which have been so widely bestowed upon our
manufactures. I commend the whole
subject to tbe wisdom of congress,
with the suggestion that uo question of greater
magnitude or farther-reaching importance can
engage their attention. In 1875 the supreme
court of the United States declared unconsti
tutional the statues of certain states which im
posed on ship-owners or consignees a tax of
£1.50 for each passenger arriving from a
foreign country or, in lieu thereof, re
quired a bond to indemnify the state
and local authorities against expense
for the future relief or support of such pas
senger. Since this decision the expense at
tending the care and supervision of immigrants
has fall on the states at whose port they have
landed. Asa large majority of such immi
grants immediately on arrival proceed to the
inland states and territories to seek permanent
homes it is manifestly unjust to impose on tbe
state whose shores they first reach the burden
wicch it now bears, bor this r. aeon, and le
canse of the national importance of the sub
jet't. I recommend legislation regarding tbe
-oijiervisioii.
AI-ASKA. .
I regret to state that tbe people of Alaska
i have reason to complantthat they are as yetun
| provided with any form of government by
which life or property can be protected. While
the extent of its population docs not justify
the application of the costly machinery of ter
ritorial administration, there is immediate
necessity for constituting such a form of gov
ernment as will promote the education of the
people and secure the administration of justice.
CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY.
The senate at its last session passed a bill
providing for the construction of a building for
the library of congress, but it failed to become
a law. The provision of such protection for
this great collection of books and for the de
partment connected with it, has become a sub
ject of national importance, and should receive
prompt attention.
PISTBICT OF COLUMBIA.
The report of the commissioners of the Dis
trict of Columbia herewith transmitted will in
form you fully of the condition of the affairs
of the District. The vital importance of legis
lation for the reclamation and Improvement of
the marshes and for the establishment of the
harbor lines along the Potomac River front
is shown. It is represented that in their
present conditions these marshes seriously af
fect the health of the residents of the adjacent
parts of the city and that they greatly
mar the general aspect of the p&ik in which
stands the Washington monument. This im
provement would add to that park and the park i
south of the executive mansion a large area of i
valuable land and would transform wbat is now !
believed to boa dangerous nuisance into an at- j
tractive landscape extending to the river-front. I
They recommend the removal of the steam |
railway lines from the surface of the streets of ,
the city and the location of the necessary
depots in such places as may be convenient for !
the public accommodation; they call attention j
to the deficiency of the water supply which 1
seriously affects the material prosperity of the
city and' the health and comfort of its inhabi
tants, I commend these subjects to your fa
vorable consideration.
I’BESIPENTIAL ELECTORS.
The importance of timely legislation with
respect to the ascertainment and declaration of
the vote for presidential electors was sharply
called to the attention of the people more than
four years ago, and it is to be hoped that some
well-defined measure may be devised before
another national election, which will render
unnecessary a resort to any expedient of a tem
porary character for the determination of ques
lic ns upon contested returns.
THE “INABILITY ” QUESTION.
Questions, which concern the very existence
of the government and the liberties of the peo
ple, were suggested bv the prolonged illness of
(he late president and his consequent incapacity
to perform the functions of his office. It is
provided by the second article of the constitu
tion in the fifth clause of its first section,
that, in case of the removal of the
President from office or of his death, assassi
nation, or inability to discharge the powers
and duties of said office, the same shall de
volve on the vice president. What is the in
tention of the constitution in its speculation of j
“inability to discharge the powers and duties i
of said office ?” Is one of the contingencies j
that which calls the vice president to the exer- |
cise of presidential functions? Is the
inability delegated in its nature to long
continued intellectual incapacity or has it broader
import? What must be its extent and duration?
llow must its existence be established? Has
the president, whose inability is the subject of
inquiry, any voice in determining whether or |
not it exists? or is the decision of that moment- |
ous and delicate question confined to I
the vice president? or is it contemplated!
by the constitution that congress j
should provide by law precisely i
what should constitute inability, and how and j
by what tribunal or authority it should be ascer
tained ? If the inability proves to be temporary
in nature, and during its continuance the vice
president lawfully exercises the functions
of the executive, by what tenure does
be hold the office ? Does he continue as Presi
dent for the remainder of the four years term,
or would the eieeted President, if his ;
inability should cease in the interval j
be empowered to resume his offices, and if hav- '
ixig such equal authority, he should exercise
it, would the vice president be thereupon em
powered to resume his powers and duties as
such? I cannot doubt that these important
questions will receive your early and thought
ful consideration.
Deeply impressed with the gravity of there- !
sponsibilitics which have so unexpectedly de- j
volved upon me it will be my constant purpose
to co-operate with you in such measures as will
promote the glory of the country and the pros
perity of its people. .Signed,
Chester A. Arthur.

(Davis) called attention to the fact that the sth
of December, the day on which congress con
vened, was the fiftieth amiiversary of the dav
when Isaac Bassett, the much esteemed door
keeper ot the senate, became connected with
that body. Half a century ago ho entered the
service of the senate as a page through the in
tluenceof Daniel Webster. In all the mutations
of parties, no attempt has ever been made to
disturb Lim. “I am sure” Davis said, “the
sentiment of all sides is cordially expressed
when I wish him health and happiness in the
name of the senate of the United States.”. ..
Adjourned until Monday next.
Ilutisc.
Monday, December s.—At noon the clerk of
the house, Adams, called the body to order and
announced the opening of the session. The
roll-call showed 208 representatives present, the
absentees being Morey, locales, Mills and
Dcaster. Nominations for speaker being in or
der, Keifer was put in nomination by Robeson,
Randall by House and Ford by Murch. The
roll was called, and resulted as follows: Whole
number of votes, 285; necessary lor choice, 148;
for Keifer, 148; Randall, 129; Ford, 8. Those
voting for Ford were Brumm, Biutowh, of Mis
souri; Hazeltine, Jones, of Texas; Ladd, Mos
grave, Murch and Rice, of Missouri, None of
the candidates voted. Fulkerson and Paul, of
Virginia, (readjustees) voted for Keifer. The
result having been announced, Keifer was es
corted to the speaker’s chair by Randall and
Iliscock, and took the oath of office, which was
administered by Kelly, of Pennsylvania, as the
oldest member in point of service. The work
of swearing in members was commenced, but
Alabama being the first state called, Jones
(Texas) objected to the oath being administer
ed to Joseph Wheeler (Alabama) and asked he
be compelled to stand aside. So ordere 1.
Springer objected to the swearing in of Cutis,
(Iowa), Van Vorhies, (N. Y.), King, (La,).
Moore, (Tenm), and Chalmers, (Miss.) All of
these gentlemen stood aside. Objections were
further made to the qualifying of Wadsworth
and Van Vorhies, Dibble and Moore, (Term.)
After the work of swearing in members to
whom there was no objection was concluded,

Nautical Nonsense.
“Father,’' asked Johnny, “what is a
lop;?” “A log, my sou,” replied
Brown, stealing a hasty glance at Mrs.
8., to see il she was listening for his
answer, “a log, my son, is a big piece
of wood or timber. Why do you ask,
Johnny?” “It tells in this story about
heaving the log, and it says the ship
went fourteen knots an hour. What
does it mean by knots, father?”
“Knots, Johnny?—knots? Why, you
have seen a log—almost always covered
with knots—haven’t you ! Well, that’s
what it means—fourteen of them—the
ship got by fourteen of them in an hour.
That’s all, Johnny,” said Brown, with a
sigh of relief that he had got out of it so
easily.

A Singular Taste.
It is said that Mile. Emilie Broisat, a
very clever actress of the comedie Fran
caise, always eats her meat uncooked;
not “rare done,” but absolutely raw.
This “bold and bloody ” taste is an ac
quired one, and tbe story of its growth
is to the following effect; Several years
ago, when she first started on her artis
tic career, she was engaged in a Brus
sels theatre, wheie she received at the
beginning 350 francs a mouth. But
business was not very good, and this
salary was soon reduced to 225 francs.
No one had ever dared accuse mademoi
selle of having in those days looked after
support and protection on the outside of
the theatre, and the poor girl had, no
doubt of it, a hard struggle for exis
tence. She boarded in the family of a
butcher, but she paid so little that it
was expressly bargained that she was to
have meat only once a week—on Sun
days, What she got to eat was of the
commonest and scantiest hind, and she
soon ran down in flesh to such an extent
that her comrades used to call her a
walking skeleton. Always at night,
after driving home from the theater, she
used to pass through the butcher’s shop
on her way to her room, ami one night
she could not resist the temptation to
cut off and eat a piece of the beef hang
ing on one of the hooks. She found it
delicious, and, for the first time in a
long while, went to bed with a full stom
ach. She kept this up night after night,
always being careful not to leave marks
of the robbery, behind her, and pretty
soon her health was restored, and she
grew stouter, and acquired a taste which
has ever since remained with her.
