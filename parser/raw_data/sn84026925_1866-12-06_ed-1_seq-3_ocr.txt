The Business of the Country.
The New York Sun, of Friday, says:
Gold, stooks, manufactures, produce, and
nearly everything else saleable, are traveling
on the down grade with full steam on and
the brakes unset Yesterday gold touched
137, and all the markets were sensibly affected
by the depression. The excitemeni
in stocks came very near reaching the de
gree of a panic. Several speculators are re
ported to have been set upon their beam
ends by yesterday's tumble, and if the preseut
condition of things should continue a
few days longer, a general crash in the
speculative business will be inevitable. In
the meantime, consumers should insist upon
realizing their share of the benefits of the
tumble in the wholesale markets. Every
thing eatable and wearable has gone down
materially in the wholesale markets within
the last two weeks, and yet the retailers
have to a great extent refused to lowor
prices u single peg Buyers should bring
this class to their senses by limiting their
purohases to tbo smallest amounts consiefont
with nrnsent reouirements Pricof
kVU% ? r ---l
uiast come down in the retail markets, act]
if retailers will not drop voluntarily, they
should be foroed into it by a partial suspen
sioo of purchases.
The World, of thu same date, has the
following on the same subject:
Disguise it as they may, the busineBt
men of the country are looking each other
iu the faoe and asking the question, whai
of the future 1 Trade is stagnant From
every branch of business the report of dullness
is heard. Were the dry goods merchant
the oly one to complain, the cause for his
complaint might be determined with ease ;
but be is not alone. Within the past few
weeks, not merely dry goods, hut provisions,
books, and nearly every ktud of merchant
able commodities have depreciated in value.
The importers of dry goods have been forced
to offer their stocks for sale at auction, and
to day goods oan be purchased for a lcs.?
number of dollars io currency thau they ac
tually cost io gold Book publishers, too,
are doing but little. The fall and early
winter are their harvest time, yet a perusal
of their advertisements shows how meagre
is the show of new publications that they
make. English hooks, we hear, are driving
American books out of the market.
The reason for this, it is not our purpose
at present to suggest, but to the faot we
would call the attention of the public
Labor, too, is becoming cheaper. Yet from
every quarter couaes the cry of distress?
save from the New Kuglaud maoufacturers
who have made enough during the last five
years to support them and the States which
they represeut, for more than as many yean
to come.
The signs of tho times are not so cheer
ful as our "loyal" friends would have us
bcliove, but they need not cause desponden
cy. Sooner or later, this inflated currency
now in vogue, must sink to its proper value,
and during the process many people tuusi
suffer. Meanwhile, prudent persons wili
control their expenses as much as they can
invest their money in something which ha:
an intrinsic value, and await the good time

continue to decline. The last accounts quote prices weak
In that market, at 33 to 34 cents, a decline of six cents per
pound since the first of November. This haw produced n
I corresponding depression hero. We now quote, extremes
In speeie, 16 to 18 cents.
' Charleston, Ifov. 89.?Cotton.?1The attempt at .
working short time by the British manufacturer, and the {
consequent want of spirit in the English Cotton market,
I has a tendency for the present to lessen the value of the
staple; but unless the peace of the world Is seriously dlw?
turbed, Cotton grown in tills country during the present
. year, will be wanted at good figures. Buyers here have
shown a fair disposition to purchase, but the limited stock
j and the stringent prices demanded by holders have somewhat
contracted the business of the week. It will be nor
tlced by our statement that both the receipts and exports of
I this week show a filling off from that of the week before.
' The dally condition of the market has bccu as follows:
The week opened on Friday, the 23d ult., on a dull and declining
market, prices coining down from a half to one cent -]
, per pound, with sales of 237 hales, the rates being about 31 j
cents per pound, ior miauling uunun. Mil amuiua} uicic
, was considerable enquiry, but factors were generally declining
to place their Cotton on the market and buyers were
I compelled to pay nn advance, which about recovered the fall
r ot the previous day, the sales being 262 bales, Middling Cot'
ton closing at 31 # to 32 cents per pound. 150 bales addlI
tional changed hands during the afternoon at a slight advance,
after favorable foreign advices had come to hand. 1
On Monday, the Imprvetnent in the Liverpool market caused J
considerable demand, and holders were enabled to procure "
an advance of IX to 2 cents per pound, on the prices of
Friday and Saturday, with sales of 290 hales. Middling
> Cotton selling for 33 to 33#. On Tuesday the market
, opened flat and prices foil off a hall cent per pound, but
closed rattier firmer, with sales of 250 bales, Middling Cot
ton selling for about 33 cents. On Wednesday the market
- continued without Important change, the sales, which
' amounted to 360 bales, being at previous prices. Thursday T\
r was Thanksging Day and there was no business done. |j
Yesterday, In consequence of the decline at Liverpool, the
market fell off in price about 1 cent per pound, the sales
1 amounting to 330 bales, making the total sales of the week
1879 bales. The following arc Die particulars of yesterday's
business, viz : 15 at 29, 7 at 30,10 at 31,7 at 32, 69 at 32#,
21 at 32X, 5 at 33 and 120 on private terms. We quote Low

cents.
Corn.?There has been no nddition to the 6upply of tills
grain since last report. The stock Is limited, and purchasers
buy sparingly, expecting lower rates. The only sales
[ have been in parcels of 100 to 500 bushels encli at about
31 JO for prime Old Maryland White, by weight, sacks ln'
eluded.
Flour.?The stock of Northern and Western brands is
increasing. Buyers operate but sparingly, expecting lower
rates. We quote Northern and Western Super at 310.30
to $11 per barrel; Extra at $'1.50 to $12; Baltimore Super at
$12.50 to $13, and Extra at $14 to $15 per barrel. Extra
Georgia and Family Flour is selling at $15 JO to $18 per
barrel.
Bacon.?The declining condition of tlio Northern markets,
and the large slock here keeps the market depressed, anil ??
lots of large size difficult of sale except at very low rates.
The ordinary demand Is supplied at about 16to 17 cents per
pound for prime Shoulders, 17 cents for prime Ribbed
Sides, and 17# to 18 cents per pound for prime Clcnr Kib- y
1 bed and Clear Sides.
, Salt.?There have been received from Liverpool a shipment
of 3000 sacks. Large lots are rather difficult to move,
but the jobbing trade continues to be supplied at about prevlous
rates, say $2JO per sack for common Liverpool. I

the market, which is held at about previous figures, say 34 C. J
