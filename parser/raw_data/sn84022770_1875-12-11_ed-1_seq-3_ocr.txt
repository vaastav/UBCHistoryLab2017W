a gigantic ring, composed of three proininent
linns or claim agents in Philadelphia, which
have succeeded, by fraudulent doruuicn arc
evidence, in getting through, duriugthc pas I
few years, many thousand pension cases, in
volving over sl*ooo,ooo annually. Evidence
at to the guilt of the firms, which nrc De

to all papers sent to him by the above linns.
A large number ol persons, who appeared
on the rolls as pensioners, have made affi
davits that they have no disabilities, but
were paid so mnch to siga blank papers pre

evidence was fraudclent, but appeared ger

been regularly drawn by the ring under pow

THE SUPREME COURT ON SUFFRAGE.
Tha recent decision of the Supreme
Court affirms that v.omen are citizons,
bnt not on that account voters, referring
the whole matter to the State Legisla
tures. Of course, then, men being citi
zens, are not therefore voters. So this
poiut is settled (according to the above
decision,) that the rigbt to vote is not
founded upon citizenship. On what
then is it founded ? It must be based
on something. Let us go back a little
nnu »ee if we can discover on what it
i cats. Says one, suffrage is conferred
by the several State Legislatures. They
designate that Mr. So-and-so may go to
the polls and vote. But other citizens,
of equal intelligence and worth, shall
not enjoy that privilege. Mow, we ask
wlieuoe is this power derived of restrict
ing suffrage, of discriminating between
the right of A merican citizens. Are not
all Legislative powers derived from the
people? Certaiuly; that is ceceded.
Then we have it, iu brief, that the
American citizen has the right to vote
when, where and how, or not at all,
only as his fellow citizens may permit.
That the list of a bare majority, anni
liialatcs all claims and privileges of
minorities to tho elective franchise, a
self-constituted oligarchy, if only in the
majority, can thus nrrognte to itself nil
privileges and rights! The supposed
rights of minorities as derived from Na
ture,'are no where; Republicanism as be
ing based upon natural rights, a delu
sion dispelled by tho dictum of nn irre
sponsible majority'!
Now wo affirm that tbo above decis
ion jeopardizes the privilege of tho elec
tive franchise by men, as now exercised.
If o majority can permit men to vote
aud deprive women, then a majority enn
permit women and deprive men, of vot
ing at the polls, and it would be just as
legal, if the elective franchise, or in
other words the right of self-govern
ment, is founded on the will of a ma
jority, and not on the rights of
Nature. But let us push the argument
a little further. Who had the right to
vote before Constitutions and laws were
founded ? Somebody must havo voted
before the making of laws, regulating
who should, and who should not vote.
Of courso their rights were derived from
Nature, and thu3 all free governments
were formed to secure and defend the
natural rights of mankind, not to des
troy or overthrow them. Our Supreme
Court instead of affirming these rights,
would rather leave whatever despotism
happens to be in power, full liberty to
continue on in its despotic work.
Thanks to the beneficent order of nature
it can bo re-constituted. New judges,
actuated by the principles of right and
justice, will eie long occupy the places
of those who have so signally failed to
appreciate the rights of American citi
zens. Tho cause will move on despite
their decision, which affects the women
as much as the old Died Scott Decision
did tho slaves of the southern States.
With like result, we opine, it will but
hasten their final and complete enfran
chisement. B. F. Bkown.
ALL ABOUT THE TEBBITOBY.
NEWAUKUX PKAIBIE, LEWIS CO., )
Dec. 1, 1875. J
MBS. A. H. H. STUART, Chairman
Com. of Immigration, Olympia W. T.
Madam: Having seen from time to
time copies of letters addressed to you,
giving descriptions of the various sec
tions of farming land in Western Wash
ington Territory, but no particular
mention having been made of this part
of the country, I desire to call the at
tention of those designing to settle in
the Territory to the Upper Newaukum
valley, and that section of country ly
ing between the head waters of the
Skookum Chuck, Newaukum and Cow
litz rivers.
Having been for a number of years
engaged in the public surveys in this
Territory, I am well acquainted with its
various parts and their adaptability to
farming purposes, and consider the
above section as being equal in soil to
the best, and larger in extent than any
other west of the mountains. The bot
tom lands aro extensive and very fer
tile; the uplands are good second-rate,
and yield large crops of grain where
ever they have been tried. The soil
consists of clay loam, with no rock or
gravel; occasionally fern-openings, or
prairies, aro found. The fern is of the
large kind, and soon gives nway to sys
tematic farming. This country has un
til recently remained almost uuknown,
but as loads are opened up and access
is given to those desiring to locate, it is
found that it more than realizes the ex
pectations of those who have followed
the line of the North Pacific Railroad,
and judge only of what they have seen
along its route. Thus far, tho opening
of roads has been done by the few scatr
tered settlers who have found their way
here, and has indeed been a severe tax
upon those who have boon found will
ing to undertake it, but every year will
render the work lighter, with the in
crease of numbe.s and facilities. A
new saw and grist mill is building here,
a new road was opened along the north
fork of the Newaukum, and one previ
ously along the south fork to Klickitat
prairie, a distance of twenty miles.
It romains only a question of time as
to when this seotion will equal the best
parts of Oregon and Washington Terri
tory, in productiveness and population,
ana though many lack the courage to
undertake the clearing of a farm yet ex
perience shows that the hardest place
is to begin; persistent work will do the
rest. C. A. WHITE.
