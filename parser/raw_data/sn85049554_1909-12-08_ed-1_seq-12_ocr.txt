Chicago, Dec. 7.—"Sorry, boss, but!

This may be the new greeting of the

Officially the report of the new rules
was denied. Two division superintend
ents, A. W. Giltzow and J. C. Patter
son, said they had heard nothing of
new orders.
In substance the reported changes
in the conduct and care of the Pull
mans are as follows:
No grip that will not go under a
seat, or is in anywise in the way, will
be allowed on Pullmans. Such luggage
must be checked in the baggage car.
Porters can not carry grips or bags
to the vestibule of a car for passengers
who are about to get off.
The old rule, reported in line for re
juvenation, is the one which forbids
porters from brushing passengers oft
anywhere in the car except at the
end3.
