OLEO GIVEN
FIRST BLOW
BOUSE PASSES FAMOUS
GROUT BILL.
PROHIBITIVE TAX IMPOSED
Dairy Men Gain Point in Battle
With Manufacturers of
Imitation Butter.
Washington, Dec. 7-The house to
day passed the Grout oleomargarine
bill by a vote of 198 to 92.
The subsitute offered by the min
ority of the committee on agriculture,
which imposed additional restirctions
on the sale of oleomargarine to pre
vent its fraudulent sale as butter and
increased the penalties for violations,
was defeated by a vote of 113 to 178.
The bill as passed makes all articles
known as oleomargarine, butterine,
imitation butter or imitation cheese
transported into any state or territory
for consumption or sale subject to the
police power of such state or territory,
but prevents any state or territory
from forbidding the transportation or
sale of such product when produced
and sold free form coloraiton in imi
tation of butter. The bill increases
the tax on oleomargarine colored in
imitation of butter from 2 to 10 cents
per pound and decreases the tax on
oleomargarine uncolored from 2 to 4
cent per pound.
A long and interesting debate pre
ceded the vote, in the course of which
those who favored the Grout bill
claimed that an additional tax on
colored oleomargarine was the only
effective remedy for preventing fraud
upon the public, while those who op
posed it contended that fraud would
be prevented by the substitute and
that the real purpose of the Grout
bill was to destroy the oleomargarine
industry.
Payne, chairman of the ways and
means committee, gave notice at the
close of the session that he would call
up the war revenue reduction act prob
ably on Tuesday.

IMMIGRATION FIGURES.
growth of America's Foreign Population
Last Fiscal Year.
Washn1 gton, Deg. 7-The annual
report of the commissioner of immi
gration shows thdt during the last
fiscal year the total uumber of immi
grauts who arrived in this country was
448,572, of which' 23,200 came
through Canada. Of the whole pum
ber 304,148 were male and 144,424
females. This is a not increase over
1899 of 136,857. These figures, how
ever, the commissioner general says,
-do not show the total number of alien
arrivals, as 65,685 aliens camne as
cabin passengers. They would have
swelled the total immigration to 514,
207 had they traveled through the
steerage.
The figures show that of the whole
number of arrivals 224,700 came from
European Countries, 17,946 from Asia,
30 from Africa and 5,896 from other
places. Switzerland and Spain and
the Spanish islands show a small de
crease in immigration, while Austria
Hungary show an increase of 83 per
cent; the Russian empire and Finn
land a 49 per cent increase; Italy a 29
per cent increase, and Japan 340 per
cent increase. The total arrivals from
Japan, however, amounted to only
9,791.
W. C. T U. ADJOURNS.
Washington, Dec. 7-The National
Woman's Christian Temperance union
convention came to a close tonight,
after a very successful and interesting
week. Most of the closing day was
devoted to superintendents' reports.
A report by the executive committee
that the National Woman's Christian
Temperance Union should own and
control the official organ was aopted,
as was a resolution declaring chat the
union shoald work for the adoption of
a constitutional amendment prohibit
ing polygamy. Columbus, Ohio; Ft
Worth, Texas, and Portland, Me., each
asked the honor of entertaining the
oniventiin in 1901.
MANY WERE PRESENT.
Opening of Bids for Naval Construction
Largely Witnessed.
Washington, Dec. 7-Never since the
birth.of the .new navy has there beenl
such a gathering of ship builders and
metal kings as were assembled in the
office of the secretary of the navy at
noon today to witness the opening of
bids for the amount of naval construc
tion, which Secretary .Long denomi
nated as the greatest this or any other
country had ever seen, involving the
placing of about fifty millions. A
notable feature was an attempt on the
part of the younger and smaller con
cerns to break the line of the ones
which have constructed nearly all of
the new navy until this time.
While it is not possible at this mo
ment to forecast the results accurately,
there are indications that in at least
one instance and perhaps two instan
ces, the attempts will be attended
with some degree of success, for it
looks as if some of the work will be
bestowed upon a company which ap
pears for the first time as a bidder for
construction of armored ships. The
Pacific coast, too, presents a likely
candidate in the shape of Moran Bros.
Because of the specifications it is
not possible to tell as yet which bids
are the lowest.
Secretary Long expressed himself
as pleased with the result so far as he
could judge from a hasty reading of
the bids. He felt that on the whole
the latter were very liberal.
MISS MORRISON TESTIFIES
PROVES UNEXPECTEDLY' STRONG
WITNESS FOR HERSELF.
Denies Most of Damaging Testimony Ad
duced by Prosecution-Says Mrs.
Castle Was Aggressor.
Eldorado, Kan., Dec. 7-Jessie
Morrison today took the stand in her
own defense and in a quiet, deter
mined manner, told of her relations
with Olin Castle before his marriage,
and calmly pictured the scene at the
Castle house during the bloody rough
and tumble fight with Mrs. Castle.
She proved an unexpectedly strong
witness. Miss Morrison approached
the witness chair pale and trembling,
and began her testimony with an
effort. As she proceeded she gained
confidence and relatea her story with
out hesitation. She denied the most
damaging testimony adduced by the
prosecution. She flatly denied many
of the statements made on the stand
by Olin Castle. She declared that he
had tried to make Mrs. Castle jealous
and that Mrs. Castle had flaunted her
husband's acts in her face. On the
day of the tragedy, she declared, Mrs.
Castle had called her into her house,
as she was passing and had accused
Miss Morrison of trying to separate her
and Castle and when she denied it,
called her a liar. Mrs. Castle had,
the witness declared emphatically, be
gun the fight, slashing her with a
razor again and again and compelling
the defendant to attack her antagonist
in self-defense.
During her thrilling recital of the
two women rolling over one another
in their combat, the spectators rivetted
their eyes upon Miss Morrison. In all
her testimony Miss Morrison was di
rect and pointed and never once did
she flinch and only one time during
the cross examination did she shed a
tear. It had been feared, even by the
defense, that she would break down
a~rinb the cross examination. The
state did not succeed in making her
contradict any material point in her
testimony.
WAS MURDERED.
Grand Rapids, Mich., Dec. 7-The
mystery of the disappearance last
August of Louis Campbell, an old sol
dier of Greenville, Mich, a small city
in Montcalm county, about 25 miles
from Grand Rapids, was cleared up
this afternoon by the discovery of his
body buried in quicklime in the barn
of a farmer named A. W. Aplin. His
skall was crushed and buried with the
body was a bloodstained club. His
clothes were also found in the barn.
Just before Thanksgiving Aplin left
the city, saying he was going to this
aity to spend a few days. Campbell's
friends immediately began a search
of Alpin's barn with the result stated.
Aplin was traced to Bay City and cap
tured.
MILLS IS INVESTIGATING.
West Point, Dec. 7-Colonel Mills
has today been conducting a personal
investigation bearing upon the alleged
hazing of Oscar L. Boose, who was
a cadet in the military academy in
1898, and whose death last Monday is
ascribed to injuries he received at haz
ing. The colonel examined all cadets
and officers in the classes implicated,
so as to get at a prioper understanding
of the case. The examination was
conducted in the colonel's private
office.
JUMPED TO DEATIh.
New York, Dec. 7-Henry J. Hay
den, vice president of the New Yerk
Central & Hudson River yailroad,
jumped out of the fourth story win
dow of his residence in this city to
night and was killed. A window of
the fourth story was opein and it is
not'known whether Hayden jumped or
fell out of the window. It was
learned that deceased was suffering
from nervousness and heart trouble.
DOLLAR FOR.
:THE AMICOS
DISCUSSION OF SPECIAL PHIL
IPPINE COINAGE.
CABINET CONSIDERS PLAN
Secretary Root Will Probably
Ask Hearing on Matter
Before Congress.
Washington, Dec. 7-The cabinet
meeting today was largely devoted to
a discussion of the question of coinage
for the Philippine islands and as a re
sult it is probable that the secretary of
war will ask for a hearing on the sub
ject before one of the committees of
congress.
Nearly all the business of the is
lands is tranacted in Mexican dollars
and the army commissaries and others
supplied with United States money
are al times greatly embarrassed in
making purchases from the Filipinos
by the fact that, knowing nothing of
our money or its value, the latter
often refuse to accept it.
The proposition which seems to
have met with favor by the adminis
tration is to purchase silver bullion at
the present market price and 'coin it
into distinctive dollars having a gold
value of about 50 cents each. These
dollars probably will contain a little
less silver than the present standard
dollars.
The scheme has not yet been worked
out in all of its details, but as there is
at present a government coinage mint
in Manila it is hoped that by early ac
tion of congress the new coins may be
put into circulation before a great
while, possibly before the war is over.
The cabinet also discussea the house
bill, revising the war revenue bill act
which proposes a cut of about $40,
000,000 in the revenues. There is no
difference of opinion among the mem
bers of the administration on this sub
ject, all thinking that the cut is too
deep and agreeing that it would be
unwise in the extreme to make a cut
greater than $39,000,000.
AIMED AT POLYGAMY.
Bill Introduced for Amendment to
Constitution.
Washington, Dec. 7-Representative
Taylor of Ohio, who was prominently
identified in the movement to exclude
Brigham Roberts of Utah from a seat
in congress, today introduced a mpeas
ure intended to bring about federal
prohibition of polygamy.
It proposes a constitutional amend
ment for uniform laws on marriage
and divorce. Taylor says, however,
that his aim goes considerably beyond
the mere uniformity of such laws, and
is expressly designed to reach polyg
amy and put an end to it. He regards
this form of remedy as the most
effective and far reaching. The meas
ure was introduced after a conference
of those interested in the subject and
although Taylor is not on the judi
cary committee, which will have
charge of the measure, it was deemed
desirable to have him present the
matter and direct the active movement
which will begin in its behalf.
EXRERIIMNT FARM.
Government Will Establish One in Phil
ippine Islands.
Berkeley, Cal., Dec. 7-Under the
patronage of the United States Phil
ippine commission, an experiment
farm will be started about 200 miles
from Manila where the growth of
seeds and plants from this country
will be tested. Professor Bernard
Moses, of the commission, has written
to the University of California regard
ing the proposed work and at his sug
gestion the state institution will send
from its experiment station the re
quired seeds and plants. Work on the
experiment farm will be conducted by
Phelps Whitmarsh.
ELEVATOR WRECKED.
Large Amount of Wheat Is Badly
Damaged.
Duluth, Dec 7-Shortly after 3
o'clock there was a bad caving-in of
one of the walls of the new Peavey
annex on Rice's Point. The annex is
composed of 15 bins of concrete con
struction. They are 90 feet in height
and 33 feet in diameter and hold about
75,000 bushels of wheat. One of the
intermediate spaces was filled with
grain to within about five feet of the
top. Evidently there was some de
fect in the walls, for.it gave way at i
point some distance down from the
top. This mass in falling struck the
opposite wall of the bin and plunged a
hole in it and through this some of
the concrete debris and about 3,000
bushels of grain poured out on the ice.
REED AGAIN SICK.
New York, Dec. 7-Roland Reed,
the actor, is again ill in St. Luke's
hospital. He will again undergo an
operation for stomach trouble brought
on by an acute attack of appendicitis
a year or mbre ago. Reed is very ill
and his family, according ,to a state
menI made at the hospital, despair of
his recovery. He will be operated
unpon as soon as possible.
AN IRRESPONSIBLE DEPUTY.
Kruger Incident Caus Sharp Talk in
Reichstag.
Berlin, Dec. 7-In the reichatag to
day, answering Herr Rossicke's inter
polation regretting that Kruger had
not been received, but had been turned
away from the gates of Germany out
of regard for another country, and
contrary to the feeling of the nation,
Count von Posedowsky Wehner, min
ister of the interior, said that he
greatly,regretted that Herr Rossicke
had not given previous notice
of the question, as he would
have asked Count von Buelow to ans
wer the difficult question in person.
He added that it was comparatively
easy for irresponsible deputies to
give expression to popular currents of
opinion, but a man occupying the re
sponsible post of chancellor of the Ger
man empire and who was answerable,
not only for the peace of Germany, but
also, under certain circumstances for
the peace of the whole world, would
not allow himself to be influenced by
anch popular and sentimental waves
of opinion. For the time there was
but one course to preserve the peace,
safety and welfare and interests of the
fatherland.
A MEETING OF DUPES
LIVELY SCENES ENACTED BY INDE
PENDENCE STOCKHQLDERS.
Vote Lack of Confidence in Directors.
John Hays Hammond Tries to
Explain Situation.
London, Dec. 7-The meeting of
persons interested in the Stratton In
dependence mine today attracted an
immense attendance of shareholders,
who passed a vote of no confidenec in
the board of directors, after one of the
stQrmiest city meetings on record.
The whole meeting was disorderly.
The directors were hissed and hooted
and the words "scandalous" and "dis
graceful" and accusations of fraud
were hurled broadcast.
The Earl of Chesterfield, who pre
sided, read a cablegram from John
Hays Hammond, the American engi
neer, asking him to announce to the
meeting that Hammond's connection
with the mine dated after the shortage
of ore reserves was discovered. His
lordship proceeded to say that a cable
message received from State Geologist
Rickards of Colorado, October 20, con
veyed the first intimation of serious
misrepresentation on the part of the
old management in regard to the value
of the ores. This was not published
because it was vague and incomplete,
but, had the directors had any concep
tion of the forshadowed discrepancy of
$12,000,000, as shown in a subsequent
report of Hammond, dated November
24, they would certainly have made
Rickards' statement public.
Rickards made a personal explana
tion at the meeting and a long and
animated discussion, marked by wild
disorder and much execration, fol
lowed. Chaos reigned and amidst it a
great mass of shareholders left.
Lord Chesterfield then declared the
report carried, although the meeting
had previously voted to postpone its
consideration for two months.
WILY JOSEPH.
Chamberlain Manages to Discomfit the
Opposition.
London, Dec. 7-Chamberlain still
fills the political stage. His unexpect
ed but adroit announcement in the
house of commons today that a civil
government would be given to two
Boer republics, coupled with his
promise to limit farm burning and
other severe military measures, so far
as possible, has taken the bottom out
of the amendment of the opposition to
the address. This new phase, com
bined with the failure of the Kruger
mission and the fact that the Worces
ter Dutch congress passed off without
trouble, persuaded the public that the
South African situation is less menac
ing than has recently been supposed
and will help to accomplish the main
object oh the government, securing
consent of the parliament to necessary
financial measures.
Thus although a session is likely to
be prolonged beyond the fortnight
which the governmenit had hoped
would not be the case. it will be less
stormy than was expected.
The remark of Asquith, radical
member for East Fifeshire, this even
ing, that moving of the amendment
was justified by Chamberlain's decla
rations was about the only thing left
for the liberals to say after the col
onial secretary sat down.

Pekin Report Continued
Massacres.
Pekin, Dec. 8-Captains Wingate
and Ryder, who accozppanied the ex
pedition to Kalgan, returned today.
During their absence they visited sev
eral places to which the Germans did
not go, but they encountered no op
position.
They learned that some 12 Euro.
peans, mostly Swedish and Norwegian
missionaries, besides Captain Watts
Jones, were massacred at Kwei Huai
Cheng by orders of the toa tai and
that 100 native Christians had also
been put to death. The details of the
outrages are most revolting.
Captains Wingate and Ryder visited
a Belgian station where the priests in
charge and 3,000 converts had sus
tained a prolonged siege by boxers and
imperial troops. They were informed
that other stations further west are
besieged, not only by boxers, but by
Chinese troops acting under orders
from the authorities, and this in spite
of the assurances by the plenipoten
tiaries that the government is doing
its utmost to suppress outrages.
Chinese carrying concealed weapons
are arrested daily in Pekin.
The natives allege that December 1l
has been fixed as the date for a rising
against the foreigners in the capital.
No alarm is felt, however, as the
troops here are sufficiently numeroun
to deal with the rising should one
occur.

congress, dismisses the president's
statements with the assertion that ii
"does not contain a shred or title o1

The writer quotes from Frederic

larly his reference to the "hideous
