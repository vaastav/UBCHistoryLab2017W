lessons, we resume our onward ca

In my messnpe of the 4th of De
cember, liG5, Conpiess was Inform
ed of the measures which bad been
lnmiiuicti ivy me i.xociitivo with n
view to the eradiiiil restoration of
the Sta'e, in which the insurrection
.occurred, t-i their relations with the
(teneral Cnvcrument. Provisional
Governors had been appointed. Con
ventions called, Governors elected,
LcglMnturos nsseinbled, ond Sena
tors ami Itcprcscntati ves chosen to
the Congress of the United States.
Courts had been opened for the en
forcement of laws long in abeyance.
The blockade had been removed,
custom houses re established,' and
vii v iuii;i urn 1 1' in ninn 'Hi in
force, in order that the people illicit
contribute to tlie national income.
I'ostal operations had been renewed,
and clfort.s wore liciinj made to re
store them to their former condition
of t-niciency. Tho States them
selves ha I lieen asked to tnlce part
In the hiih (unction of amending the
Constitution, nnd of thus sanction
Ing the extinction of African slavery
as one of the legitimate results of
our in'eriiecinc.stni'rple.
T.-mwdm hrpunmrtit foumt that It
iiad '.iccoiniilislicd nearly all that was
within the scope of its constitutional
authority. Ono thlnfr, however, yet
remained to be done before the work
of restoration could lie oompleted,
and that was the admission to Con
gress of loyal Senators and Repre
scntatives from the Rt-tes wl ose
people had rebelled npninst the law
ful authority of the General Gov
eminent. This question devolved
upon the respective IIousps, -which.
LLlLWluu UHtarnaiiA Win
bv the Constitution, are made the
judges of tho elections, returns, and
qualification nf their own members;
and its consideration at once, engag
ed tho intention of Congress.
In tho meantime, the Executive
Department -no oilier plan having
been proposed by f impress emit in
nod Its ell'jrts to perleet, ns far as
was praclicabi, tho restoration of
the proper relations between tho citi
sens of the respective Slates, tho
Mates, and the rerleral Government,
extending, from time to time, us the
public, interests seemed to require,
the judicial, revenue, Biid postal sys
terns of tho country. With tho iid
vice and consent nf the Senate, the
necessary 'olllcers were appointed,
and appropriations made by Con
press for the payment of their sala

f'Ti-IIO luimber if States:
and on the lSth dav of December.
ISfjJ. it was officially declaiod to
Imve become valid as a part of the
Constitution of the United States
All or tho States in which the insur
rection had existed promptly amend
cd their Constitution, so rts to make
them conform to tlie pieut clmngci
thus t (feeled in the organic law of
the land; declared null and void nil
ordinance or secession; repudiated
All pretended debts ami obligations
created f,-r tho revolutionary pur
poses pf the i nan I reel ion; un'd pro
ceeded, In pood ralth, to the enact
ment of measures for the protcti n
and amelioration ol the? colored race.
Congress, however, yet hesitated to
admit any of theso States to repre-
mi'i h was not until near
the close of tlie eighth month of the
eesslon that nn exception was made
lu ravor or Tennessee, by the admls
fcion of her Senators And Represcn
tativta, .
I ducm it a subject of profound
regret that Congress fins thus far
Tailed to a'lmit to seats loyal Sena.
iors ami Kepresentritivcs from the
otner states, whose Inhabitant, with
tliosa of Tennessee, had 'enjrasrpd In
th rebellion. Ten States-more
thsn one fourth of the whole nm
bcr remain without representation;
t!i scats of flrty members In the
House nf Rereontatlv a i-.
. ty memboiri in the SeaaU are yet va'.
cant not by their own consent, not
'by failure or elccMon, but by the r.
ftisal of Conjrrese to accept their era
dentlals. Their admission, It Is be.
lievod, would bava aooompllebod
much towarda the renowaj nod
strengthening of our relations as
e ueople, and retnoveu sertoiis
use for anccmtent on tlie pan 01
the inhabitants of those States. It
would have accorded with the great
liirlnelple enunciated In the Declara
Hon f Independence, that no people
lougltt to bear the burden or taxation,
and j et be tleuied the right or repre
sentation. It would have been In
consonance with tho express provb
sions of the Constitution, Mist "each
State shall have at least one Repre
scntative." and "that no Slate, with
out Its consent, shall be deprived of
it equal sufjVagn In the Senate.
These provisions were intended to
secure to every State, and to the peo
ple of every State, the rlhl of rep
rcsentallon in each House of Con-
grrsi; ami so important was it deem
ed by the framers of the Constitution
that the equality of tho States in the
Senate should bo preserved, that not
even by an amendment of the Con
slitution can any State, without its
consent, bn denied a voire in tliut
branch of the National Legislature
It is true, it has been assumed that
the existence of the States was ter
minated by the rebellious octs of
tlieir inhabitants, nnd that the insur
rection haUnp been suppressed, they
were thenceforward to be considered
merelv ns conquered territories
The I.tfrislallve, Executive, and Ju
dicial Departments of the Govern
ment have, however, with treat (lis
tinciiK-ss ami uniform consistency,
refused to sanction an assumption
so incompatible with the nature ol
our liepuiilican svslem, nnd witiune
professed ol jects of the wat. Thro.
out the recent legislation of Con
press, the iindenlublo fact makes it
self apparent that these ten politi
cal communities arc nothing less than
Stales of this Union. At tho very
commencement of the rebellion, each
Ilonee declared, with a unanimity as
remarkable as it was significant, that
the war was not "waged on our port
in any rpiiit of oppression, nor for
any purpose of conquest or subjuga
tion, nor purpose of overthrowing
or interfering with tho rights or es
tablished institutions of the Stales,
but to defend and maintain the su .
prcmacy of the Constitution and all
laws mode in pursuance thereof, and
to preserve the Union with all the
dignity, equality nnd rights of the
several S' ales unimpaired; and tliut
as soon ns these objects were accom
plished the war ought to cease." In
soma instances Senators, were per
mitted to conliuuo their legislative
functions, while in other instance
Representatives were elected and Ad
mitted to seats after their Slates had
formnliy tlcclarcd their right to
withdraw from the Union, and were
endeavoring to maintain Unit right
by force of arms. All of these
States whose people were in insurrec
lion, rts States, wero included in the
apportionment of the direct tax of
twenty millions of dollars annually
laid upon tho United States by the
act approved the 6th of. August.
IfMil. Congress, by the act of March
4, 1802, ond by tlie apportionment or
representation thereunder, also rec
ognized their presence as States in
the Union, and they have, forjudi
ded. Tho samo recognition appears
in tho recent legislation In reference
to Tennessee, which evidently rests
upon the fact that the functions of
the State were not destroyed by the
rebellion, but mcr.'ly suspended; and
that the principle Is, of course, op
plicable to those States which, like
Tennessee, attempted to renounce
their places in the Union.
Tlie action of the hxecutive De
partment cf the Government, upon
this subject has lieen equally definite
nnd uuilorm, ond tlie purpose, of the
war was specifically stated In the
Proclamation issued by my prede
cessoron the H2d day of September.
ISO'J It was then solemnly pro
claimed and declared that "hereafter,
as hereioioie, tlie w ar win no prose-1
cuted for the object of practically
restoring the constitutional relation
between the United States and each
of the States and the people thereof,
in which S ates that relation 's oi
innv be suspended or disturbed."
Tlie recognition of tho States by
tlie Judicial Department of the Gov
ernment, has also been clear and con
elusive in nil proceedings affecting
them as State, bad in the Supreme,
Circuit aud Disli let Courts.
In the Admission of Senators and
U oviiii mninii v uviipvui oeni
L'litatives from any nnd all of
ea there enn be n-
, ' I" "fiie pereona who
Heprese
t Iia StntikB
,'"-?.WfWin will bo clothed with the
powers of legislation; for this could
not happen when the Constitution
and laws are enforced bv a vlirilai.t
mid ruithful Conpress. Each ltousi
is made the "judpe of the elections,
returns, uud qualihcutions of its own
uiemheis, and may. "with the con
currence of two thirds, expel a mom-
uer. v nen a rcnator or Represcn
tative presents i.is certificate of elec
tion, he may at once bo admitted or
rejoeied; or, should there bo any
question ol' his eligibility, his ere
minis miiv be reltrrcd lor investi
gallon to the proper committee. II
admitted to n seat, it must be nimn
eWilclicn sntlsmitprv to the House
ol which he thus becomes a member,
ami he possesses the renuisitu con
stitutional ond legal qunlllications.
II reluscd admission a a member
lor want of duo allegiunce to the
Government, and returned to bis
constituents, they are admonished
Uiat none Out porsons loyal to the
United States will be allowed a voice
in the Legislative Councils of tho Na
tion, and the political nower and
morul influence of Congress are thus
enecuveiy exertea in the Interests
of loyally to the Government and
fidelity to tho Union. Uoon this
question o vitally affecting the res
u. ration of the Union end tho ner-
inanoncy of our present form of Gov
ernment, my convictions, heretofore
expressed, have undergone no
chAnge; but, on the contrnrr. their
correctness has been confirmed lv
reflection and time. If tho admis
sion of loyal members to eests In the
respective lTotisee or Congress wna
wise and exuedient a vear nn. it u
no less wise and expedient now. If
tine anomalous condition is rlrhtl
IT I. tl,. r,art AMldlttott of
thi States nt the Dresent time, It
Is law ful to exclude them from repre
sentation. I do not see that the ques
Hon will bo changed by the afflux of
time. Ten years licnee, tr vnese
Slates remain as they are, the right
of representation will be no stronger
the ri v lit of exclusion will be no
0
weaker. -
The Constitution of the United
States makes it the duty of the Pres.
Idcntto recommend to the consider
ation of Congress "such measures
as he shall Judge necessary or expe
dient." I know of no measure more
Imperatively demanded by every
consideration of national luterest,
sound policy nnd equal justice, than
the admission of loyal members from
the now nnrepresentated states.
This would consummate the work of
restoration, and exert a most saluta
ry Influence in the re-cstabiiBhinent
of pence, harmony ond fraternal
feeling. It would lend greatly to re
new the confidence of the American
people In the vigor and stability of
their institutions. ' It would bind us
more closely together as a nAtlon,
And enable ns to show to the world
the inherent ond recuperative power
of a Government founded upon the
will of tho people, and established
upon Hip principles of liberty, Justice
ond intelligence. Our Increased
stienplh and enhanced prosperity
would irrefrngibly demonstrate the
fallacy of the argument against free
institutions drawn rrom our recent
national disorders by the enemies of
republican government. The admis
sion ol loyal lueiii tiers irom me
States now excluded from Congress,
by allaying doubt and apprehension,
would turn capital, now awaiting an
opportunity for investment, into the
channels or trade nnd Industry.
It would alleviate the present trou
bled condition of those States, and.
by inducinp emipration, aid in the
settlement of fertile regions now un
cultivated, and lead to an increased
produclion nf those staples which
have ndded so greatly to the wealth
of tho nation and the commence of
the world. iNew Uelus or enterprise
would bo oncnen to our progtessive
people, end soon the devastations or
war would be repaired, and all the
trnces or our domestic differences
effaced from tho luiuds ol our couu
try men.
In our efforts to preserve "tho unl
ty of Government which constitutes
ns ouo people," bv restoring the
Stales to the condition which they
held prior to tho rebellion, we sho'd
be cautious, lest, having rescued our
nation from perils of threatened ins
integration wo resort to consolida
tion; aud in the end absolute des
potism, as a remedy Tor the recur
re u co or similar troubles. 1 ho war
havinp terminated, and with it all
occasion for tho exercise of powers
of doubtful constitutionality, we
should hasten to bring legislation
within the boundaries prescribed by
Hie Constitution, and to return to the
ancient landmarks established by our
fathers for tho guidance of succeed
ing generations. "The Constitution
which at any time exists, until chang
ed by on explicit and authentic act
!? fllt.l V O
of the people, the distribution or
modification or llio constitutional
power be In any particular wrong,
let it be corrected by an amendment
in the way in which the Constitution
designates. Hut let there be no
change by usurpation; for It Is the
customary weapon by which tree
governments are destroyed." Wash
inpton spoke theso words to his
countrymen, when, followed by their
lovennl gratitude, he voluntarily
retired from the cares of public life
"To keep ail things within the pale
or our constitutional powers, and
cherish the Federal Union ns the on
ly rock of safety ," were, prescribed
by Jefferson ns rules of action to en
denr to his "countrymen tho true
principles of their Constitution, and
promote, n union of sentiment nnd
notion equally auspicious to tlieir
happiness nnd rulety." Jackson
helil that the action of the General
Government should always be strict
ly con lined to the sphere of its ap
propriate duties, nnd justly and for
cibly urged that our Government is
not to be maintained nor our Uuion
preserved "by invasions of the rights
aud powers of the several States.
In thus attempting to make our eveu
end Government e make It
weak " ue Btrengtb consists in
leaving individuals and States as
much as possible to themselves; in
making itself felt, not In Its power,
out in its nenctieence; not In Its con
trol, but in its protection; not in
binding the States more closely to
tho center, but leaving each to move
unobstructed fn Its proper constitu
tional orbit." These are the teach
ings of men whoso deeds and scrvi
ces have made them illustrious, and
who, long since withdrawn from tlie
seenea of life, have left their country
the rich legacy of their example,
tlieir wisdom and their patriotism
Drawing Tresli inspiration from their
lessons, let us emulate them in love
or country, and respect lor the Con
stitution ii nd laws.
REPORT THE SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY.
Tlie report ol the Secretary of the
Treasury affords much information
respecting tho revenuo and commerce
or the country. His views upon the
currency, nun wuu rcierence to a
proper uiijustment of our revenue
system, internal as well aa impost,
are recommended to the careful con
sideration of Congress. In ny last
annual message i expressed my gen
eral views upon these subjocta. I
need now only call attention to the
necessity of carrying into every de
pertinent of the Government a avs
tern of rigid accountability, thorough
retrenchment and wise economy.
un no oxooptionai nor unusual ex
penditures, the oppressive burdens
of texation can be lessened by anoh
a modification or our revenue laws
as will be consistent with the public
faltb, and the legitimate and necee
sary wanta of the government. -
Tbe report present a much mora
aatisraotory coneiiuon of our finances
than ono year ago the tuostaancnlnM
could Live anticipated. During the
flseal year ending the 80th ol June,
1865. the last year ol the war, the
public debt wae increased 8941,902,-
587, and on the Blst or Uctoner,
1803, it amounted to z,74U,8D4 o.
On tho 81st day of October, I860,
it had been reduced to 82,551,810,
00C, the diminution, during a period
of fourteen months, commencing
September 1st. 18G5, and ending Oc
tober 3d, 1SUO, saving ueen ejzuo,.
379,565. In the last annual report
on the state of the finances, it was
estimated tuatdurlngthe three qusr
ters of the fiscal year ending the 80th
of June lsst, the debt would be In
kreescd 118,194,047. During that
period, however, it was rednced Ml,
196,887, the receipts of the year haT-
inir been S9.UU0.0Ua more, and the
expenditures t20tt,529,235 less than
the estimates. Nothing could more
clearly indicate than these statements
the extent and availability of the
national resources, and the rapidity
and safety with which, nnder onr
form of Kovernment, great military
and naval establishments can be dis
banded, and the expenses reduced
from a wat to a peace footing.
During the fiscal year ending the
80th of June, i860, the receipts were
558,032 620, and the expenditures
t520.750.940. leavinz an available
surplus or 837,281,630. It Is estl
mated tbat the receipts ror fie fiscal
year ending the 30th June, 1807, will
be 47 3,01)1, iJSti, and that the expen
ditures will reach the aum or 8316,-
428,078, leaving In the Treasury a
surplus of 8158,033,308. For the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, it is
estimated that the receipts will
amount to 8436.000,000. and that the
expenditures will be 83.'0. 247,041
showing an excess of 885,752,359 in
lavor or the Government. These es
timated receipts may be diminished
by a reduction of excise and import
dutirs; but, after all necessary reduc
tions shall have been mado, tho rev
enue of the present and of following
years wilt doubtless be sufficient to
cover all legitimate charges nponthe
Treasury, and leave a large annual
surplus to be applied to the payment
of the principal of the debt There
seems now to be no good resson
why taxes may not bo reduced as the
country advances in population and
wealth, and yet the debt be extin
guished within the next quarter of a
century,
The report of the Secretary of
War furnishes valuable ond impor
tant information in reference to the
operations of his Department during
the past year. Few voiuuteers are
now in the service, and they aro be
ina discharged as rapidly as they can
be replaced bv regular troops. The
army has been promptly paid, caic
fully provided with medical treat
ment, well shelt red and subsisted,
and is to be armed with breech 1 nd
ing small nrms. The military
strength of the nation has lieen unim
paired by llio discharge of volun
tecrs, tho disposition of unservice
able or perishnblo utores, and the
retrenchment of expenditure. Suf
ficient war material to meet anj
emergency has been retained, and,
from the disbanded volunteers stand
ing ready to respond to the national
Fortifications on the coast and fron
tiers, have received, or are being pre-
ared for-more powerful armaments;
ake surveys and barber and river
improvements are in the course or
energetic prosecution. 1 reparations
have been marie Tor the payment or
the additional bounties authorized
during the recent session of Con
gress, under such regulations as will
protect the uovcrnmcnt irom Irauu
and secure to the honorably-discharged
soldier tho well earned ro-
ward of lus raithnilness and gallant
ry. More than six thousand maimed
soldiers have received artificial limbs
or other surgical apparatus; aid forty-one
national cemeteries containing
the remains of 104,020 Union sol
diers have already been established.
I he total estimate of .Military ap
propriations is 625,205,G69.
It is stated in tlie report or the
Secretary of tho Navy that the naval
force at this time consists of two
hundred and seventy-eight vessels,
armed with to thousand three hun
dred and fifty one guns. Of these,
ono hundred and fifteen vessels, car
rying one thousand and twenty-nine
gups, are in commission, distributed
chiefly among seven squadrons. The
number of men in the service is thir
teen thousand six hundred. Great
activity and vigilance have been dis
played by all tbe squadrons, and
their movements have been judicious
ly and elllciently arranged in such a
manner as would best promote Amer
ican commerce, and protect the
rights aud interests of our country
men abroad. The vessels employed
are undergoing repairs, or are laid
up until their services are required.
Mcst or the iron clad fleet are at
League Island, in tho vicinity or
Philadelphia, a plaeo which, until
decisive action should bo taken by
Congress, was selected by the Sec
retary or tne Aavy as tbe most elig
ible location for that class of vessels.
It is important that a suitable public
station should be provided for the
iron clad fleet. It is intended tbat
theso vessels shall bo in proper con
dition for any emergency, and it is
desirablo that tbe bill accepting
League Island for naval purposes,
which passed the IIouso of Represen
tatives at ita last session, should re
ceive final action at an early day, in
order that there may be a suitable
publio station for this class of ves
sels, aa well aa a navy yard of area
sufficient for the wanta of he services
on the Delaware river. The Naval
Pension Fund amounts ot 811.750,-
000, having been increased 82.750,
000 during the year. The expend l
turee ol tbe Department for the flseal
year ending SOtb of June last were
843,824.026, and tbe esU mates for
tbe coming year amount to 823,568,-
436. Attention is invited io the con
dition of our seamen, and the Impor
tance ef legislative measures for tielr
relief and improvement. Tbe aug
teetlone la behalf of thla deservlna
class of our fellow citUene are ear
nestly recommended to tbe favor,
able attention of Congress
Tbe report or tne rottmaitcr Gen
in
a
eral presents a most satisfactory con
ditiosi of tho postal service, and sub
mit recommendations wbicu deserve
the Consideration of Congress. The
revenues of the Department for the
year ending June 80, 1866, were 814,
386,985. and tbe expenditures 815,-
302.079. showing an excess or the
latter1 of 8965,093. In anticipation
of this deficiency, however, a special
Appropriation was made by Congress,
the act approved July 28, I860.
Including the standing appropriation
of 8700,000 for free mail matter, as
legitimate portion of the revenues
yet remaining unexpended, the aotual
deficiency for the past year is only
8265.093 a sum within 851,141 of
the amount estimated in the annual
report of 1864. The decrease of rev
enue, compared witn the previous
year, was one and one fifth per cent.,
and tbe increase or expenditures,
owing principally to tlie enlargement
or the mail service in the South, was
twelve per cent. On the 80th or
Juno last there were In operation six
thousand nine hundred and thirty
mail routes with an aggregate length
or ono hundre undd eighty thousand
nine hundred and twenty-one mitee,
an aggregate annual transportation
of seventy one million eight hundred
and. thirty-seven thousand tine hun
dred aud fourteen miles, and an ag
ereeale annual coft, including all ex
peuditures of 88,410.184. The length
or railroad routes is thirty twotiious
aud and ninety two miles, and the
annual transportation thirty million
six hundred and nine thousand four
hundred and sixty seven miles. The
leniAh or steamboat routes is four
teen thousand three hundred and
roi ly six mites, and the annual trans
portalion three million four hundred
and cloven thousand nine hundred
and sixty two miles. The muil ser
vice is rapidly increasing throughout
the whole country, and its steady ex
tension in tho Southern States in
dicatea tlieir constantly improving
condition. The growing importance
or the rorciuii service also merits at
tention. Tne I'ostofTlce Department
of Great Britain and our own have
agreed upon a preliminary basis for
a new postal convention which it is
believed will move eminently bene
ficial to the commercial Interests of
the United States, inasmuch as it
contemplates a reduction of the in
ternation.il letter postage to one hall
tho existing rates: a reduction ol
postacc with nit other countries to
and from which correspondence is
transmitted in the British mails or
in closed mails through the United
Kingdom; the establishment or uni
form and reasonable charges Tor the
sea ond territorial transit or corres
pondence in closed mails; and au al
lowance to each l'ostoflice Depart
ment of the right to use all mail com
munications established under the
authority of theother for the dispatch
or correspondence, cither iu open or
closed mails, on the same terms as
those applicable to the inhabitants or
the country providing the means or
transmission.
Tho report of the Secretary of the
Interior exhibits the condition of
those branches of the public service
rour million six hundred and twenty-
nine thousand three hundred ond
twelve acres of public land were dis
posed or, one million eight hundred
and ninety two thousand five bun
dred and sixteen acres of which were
entered under the homestead act
The policy originally adopted relative
to the public lamls'lias undergone cs
scntial modifications. Immediate
revenue, and not their rapid settle
ment, was tho cardinal feature of our
land system. Long experience and
earnest discussion have resulted in
the conviction tl at the early devel
opmentof our agricultural resources
and the dillusion ot an energetic
population over our vast territory
are objects ot'lar greater importance
to tho national growth and prosperity
than tho proceeds ot the salo or the
land to the highest bidder in open
market. . 1 he pre-emption laws con
fer upon tho pioneer who complies
with the terms they impose the priv
.Hedge of purchasing a limited portion
or "unotiored lands ' at the mini
mum price. The homestead enact
ments relieve the settler from the
payment of purchase money, end se
cure him a permanent home, upon
tbe condition of residence for a term
of years. The liberal policy invites
emigration from the old, and from
the more crodod portions of the
new world, its propltous results
are uncounted, end will ie more
signally manifested when time shall
have givcu it a wider develop
ment.
Congress has made liberal grants
or public land to corporations, in aid
or the constructions or railroads and
other internal improvements. Should
this policy hereafter prevail, more
stringent provisions will be required
to secure a faithM application of the
fund, l ho title to the lands could
not pass, by patent or otherwise, but
remain in the Government and sub
ject to its control until some por
tion or the road has been actually
built, l'orlions of them might then,
from timo to time, be conveyed to
the corporation, but never in a great
er ratio to the whole quantity em
braced by tbe grant than the com
plete parts bear to the entire length
of tho projected improvement. The
restriction would not operate to tbe
prejudice of any undertaking con
ceived in good faltb and executed
with reasonable energy, as it is tbe
settled practice to withdraw from
market the lands falling within tbe
operation of such grants, and thus
to exclude the inception of a subse
quent adverse right. A branch of
the conditions which Congress may
deem proper to impose should wo
a forfeiture of claim to tbe lands, ao
withdrawn but con Toyed, and of title
to tlie lands conveyed which remain
unsold. j

Operations on the several lines of
