ONEOF THOSE
OPPORTUNITIES
BELONCSTOYOU
A Chance for You to

Year.

EVERY CASE IS
A WORTHY ONE
Give of Your Surplus to Those
Who Are in Need and Ask
for Help.
Are YOU looking forward to
Christmas with joy? Are the twelve
months ahead provided for with the
necessities, If not the luxuries of
life? Do YOU have to wonder where
food and clothing and fuel Is coming
from. If you do not If all the hap
piness for twelve months ahead 1b In
sured, ought YOU not, If there Is a
litle extra In YOUR purse? If there
1b a little leeway between YOUR
needs and YOUR resources, ought
YOU not to help Borne of those un
fortunates to whom existence is a
struggle, and unqualified happiness a
rarity?
"Unto the Littlest."
Of such uro made up the fourteen op
portunities which The Times offers you
fourteen opportunities to do good,
fourteen opportunities to contribute to
actual need, fourteen opportunities to
establish happiness In homes where
happiness Is absent, fourteen opportuni
ties to "Do unto the littlest of these."
It is a fine thing to play Santa Claus
to your children at home. Contrast this
with the Christmas morning seen In
the homes of those who make up the
rourteen opportunities. "What is YOUH
answerT Will YOU bo content to Ignore
the appeal of these-' unfortunates, or
will YOU do as others are, doing, send
.YOUR ml to to ..help., to .make their
ChnBTnarWBhf?ahd'provld5'them-w!th
support until they can get on their feet
again? Each one of the fourteen op
portunities 1b YOUR opportunity.
Among the contributions received In
the early mall this morning was a
check for $14, with directions to apply
$1 to each of tho fourteen opportunities,
and the little note accompanying the
check read: "How any ono can fall to
contribute Is beyond my comprehen
sion." , (
Another subscriber to each of the op
portunities writes:
"Inclosed I have the pleasure of Bend
ing you my check for ?3, to be credited
in any way y'ou think best toward the
"fourteen opportunities" mentioned In
the paper. I have so much sympathy
for every one of the fourteen cases
that I wish I were able to send a
larger contribution for each. At least,
lef'me thank the Associated Charities
and the paper for their noble work, and
for the opportunity to make my own
Christmas a little brighter by helping
ever so little in the Christmas of those
less fortunate."
Another contributor writes:
"Inclosed find check for $5, which will
be used to assist old couple mentioned
in your advertised opportunities. No. 8.
wish I felt ablo to send the full
amount." .

y
Voluminous Report Has
Been Compiled by Board
of Trade Committee.
A voluminous report containing a long
list of reasons why the pay of school
teachers should not bo delayed until
tho tenth of each month, as proposed
by Henry P. Blair, has been complied
by two members of the Board of Trade
scnooi committee, and today was re
ceived at the board offices to be con
sidered formally by other members of
the committee.
A suggestion Is presented to the ef
fect that the board supply funds for
sending either Harry Hlne, secretary of
the Board of Education, or one of his
clerks to New York city to study meth
ods there, where teachers are paid
much earlier than In Washington.
The report was compiled by Mrs. Car
oline Stephens and A. J. Yoder, mem
bers of the board's school committee.
Back of it. It was stated. Is the senti
ment of hundreds of teachers, who have
appealed to members of the committee
to use their Influence in blocking the
proposal of Mr. Blair.
It Is stated In the report that teach
ers, who must pay gas and telephone
bills, will loso their discounts If they
do not receive their checks before tho
10th of each month. It also Is said that
nearly all grocers wish to be paid near
the 1st of the month instead or on the
10th. It would make It hard for many
of the teachers to obtain credit, It Is
claimed. If they could not meet pay
ments by at least the fifth of each
month.
Though It Is understood most of the
members of the committee have seen
the report, it will not be made public
until the school committee, of which
D. J. Callahan is chairman, approves It.

PASSPORT ACTION
CALLED INSULT BY
CZAR OF RUSSIAS
Ambassador Tells Taft His Government Re
gards Sulzer Resolution as Offensive.
President Urges Moderation..
OBJECTION IS TO WORDING,
AND TAFT WILL SEEK CHANGE!
The Czar of Russia, through his ambassador to this country, today
told the Government of the United States that he regarded the Sulzer
resolution, which calls for the abrogation of the passport treaty of 1832,
as an insult.
The protest against the abrogation was made to President Taft by
Ambassador Bakhmetieff on behalf of the Czar.
As a result of this most important development, President Taft is
working desperately today to have the resolution either amended in tha
Senate or else killed entirely, so as to remove the cause of the protest of
the Russian government.
Russia 1b deadly earnest abouMhc proposed abrogation, and will not
accept the action carried in the Sulzer resolution with equanimity. No
direct threats have been made to this Government, but meaning of the
RuBBJan protest is not one bit in doubt.
This means, if the Sulzer resolution goes through, that friendly re
lations with Russia will cease and that conditions of the most strained
nature may easily result
KNOX AND TAFT CONFER.
The fact of Russia's big objection
against the action of the House In
passing the Sulzer resolution came out
today after Secretary Knox had left
the White House. He was, in confer
ence with the President for noarly an
hour this morning, and Immediately aft
erward the seriousness of the situation,
became known. The White House made
no effort to conceal the facts In tha
case. ,, , .
LMt night, it became Itnon today(
Secretary' Knox and Ambassador Bakli'
uumen conicrrM wun wie retiaent lor
more than an hour. This conference
took place at the Executive Mansion,
ant nothing was given out about It at
the time. In fact every effort was made
to hush up the matter until the Senate
could be told of the pretest.
The Russian ambassador Is reported
to have told the President and the Sec
retary that Ruatla regards the pass.igo
of the Sulzer resolution in the House
abrogiUng the treaty os an unfriendly
act in ltsslf toward Russia. The am
bassador did not mince words about it,
but told tho President frankly that Rus
sia was dead against any such procedure
as this, and that It would he a wise
thing if some consideration of Russia's
feelings in the matter be given.
Causes Action.
This caused Immediate action. Earlier
In the day Secretary Knox had talked
the situation over with Representative
Sulzer, chairman of the House Com
mittee on Foreign Afflalrs. At that
time the opposition of the Russian gov
ernment was not fully comprehended,
however.
Today, however, the President went
at once into the matter. He called In
Reoretarv Knox and they talked over
the new phase of the abrogation move'
ment. It was then decided that the Sen
nt must he appealed to to modify the
Sulzer resolution, or vote It down en
tirely. It was stated at the White House this
afternoon that the Russians objected
more seriously to the wording of tht
Sulzer resolution than to nny other
feature of the matter. This is taken
by them to be decidedly raw. The Rus
sians, the While House heads were
willing to say, did not object so much
SULZER RESOLUTION
"JUST LIKE OTHERS"
Wording Modeled on Similar Act
Abrogating Previous Treaties,
Author Says.
When told that tho Ruerlnn govern
ment had objected to the language, of
the resolution to abrogate the Russian
treat, which passed the House bv a
vote of 800 to 1. Congressman Sulzer.
chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs and author of the resolution,
said:
"The resolution was identical in lan
guage with resolutions used by the
United States heretofore In abrogating
treaties with foreign nations. Rusbla
sfems to he getting quite sensitive. I do
not bi'liuve the Senate will thang the
VPrhlage of thW resolution, and I sea no
necessity of such action In the House.
"Thi Komi.. AiT.ilrh Conr.mltt. e was

and Denmark many years ago. There
is no difference In tho language, even
to the crobslng of a 'f or thy dotting

overwhelmingly defeated."
The attitude of fhalrmun Sulzer in
dicates that the Houso probably will

means by which he hoped to forestall
direct action by Congress.
The President this afternoon sum
moned Senator Cullom, chairman of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, and urged him to cause the res
olution to be so amended as to re
move the language which Is offensive
to Russia. The President held that the '
purpose could be accomplished exactly
as well by "a temperately worded" res
olution to which Russia would find no
objection.
' In the Senate.
A stir was caused among Senators to
day when it became known that Russia
had given notice to this Government!
that diplomatic negotiations on pass-l
ports had been broken off at 8t. Peters-i
burg because the House resolutions'
passed he other day was considered In-'
suiting. Senator Cullom, chairman off
Senate Foreign Relations, was called to)
the State Department and had a long
conference with Secretary Knox ovetj
the bltuatlon.
Senator Cullom on re turn In b- to thd
Capitol refused to say what had passed
between him and the President. He did
say that tho resolution to abrogate the)
tieaty would bo acted upon Monday
but thut care would be taken bv thri
Senate as to how It would be worded.
It Is understood that in the confer.)
ence with Secretary Knox, Senator Cul-i
lorn was Informed that the Admlnlstra-j
tion would no longer oppose tho pass
age of a modified resolution. Up to this
time the Administration has been un
friendly to Its passage. Strong pres
sure has been brought to bear, how-j
ever, to secure action before the holH
days, and the Administration has ap
parently given in. In view of the tsvl-l
dent Irritation of Russia over the mat-j
ter, It Is expected that the Senate will
proceed with great caution on Monday
and that whatever resolution Is passed!
It wll be worded so as not to give occa
slon for Insult. i
