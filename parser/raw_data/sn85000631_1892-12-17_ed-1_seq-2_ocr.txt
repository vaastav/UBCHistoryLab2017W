WASHBURN, NORTH DAKOTA
WORK IN CONGRESS.
Meamrra for Semite and Honae.
Washington, Deo. 12.—It seems to be
tacitly understood that the senate will not
tackle the anti-option bill In earnest be
fore the Christmas holidays, and as this
is the unfinished business it necessarily fol
lows that no other measures of Importance
will be taken up until after the holidays
except such as come up In the hour or
are taken under consideration by uuanl
IIIGIIS consent. There is ail unfinished de
bate pending on Mr. Vest's motion to
.'got hit with tin live principal tribes for
the surrender of Indian territory. There
are a number of other Indian questions
pet-din) which are liable to begin a gen
eral debate on the whole Indian question.
Members of the appropriation coiiiinlttee,
in view of the condition of the treasury,
will oppose further legislation involving
appropriations of any kind for the cession
of Indian lands at this time. It is assert
ed by members of that committee that,
including the Choctaw and Chickasaw ap
propriation of nearly $3,000,000 made by
the Fifty-first congress and held up pentl
itiir It nut action on the president special
message on this subject and the proposed
ratification of the agreement relating to
lie Cherokee strip and other agreements
negotiated by the Cherokee commission
for the surrender of Indian lands, the
liabilities in sight for the Indian lands
will Involve an appropriation of nearly
£10,000,000 If all are acted upon. Conse
quently there Is a disposition to delay ac
tion on any of them for the present.
The MeGarrahan claim to the .\ew Idrl
Mining comapny property Is the special or
der for Tuesday In the senate. A bill for
'•impelling tbo court of claims to take cog
nisance or the case under conditions favora
ble to McGiirraliaii was passed by the unan
imous vote of the senate last session and
four more than two-thirds of the house, but
was vetoed by 1'rcsident Harrison because
he believes the ci'iilitIons of the bill Ixirc un
fits! ly upon lite Culled States. Mr. Mcoar
'rnhun Is confident the bill will be passed
over the veto. If it is the persistent claim
ant will »e about *3.000,000 better oft than
now. Senator Mitchell says he will press
Ills joint resolution proposing an amendment
to the constitution providing for the election
of senators by the direct vote of the people.
It Is the second measure oil the calendar
under the rule for the consideration of bus
iness unobjected to. It is hardly probable
despite Its favorable position tlint conclu
sive action will be taken at this session of
congress. ,,
Appropriation bills will probably take up
the time of the house this week, fhe mili
tary bills liave been reported and may,,be
I'iilied
up Tuesday, while the fortification
bill will be ready for action by the house
Monday or a day or two thereafter. Proper
bills nearly completed are the District, or

The militarv. the fortifications and the Dis
trict of Columbia bills are 011 the programme
for consideration, and they may be disposed
of before the beginning of next week.

Will It Ever End?
Pittsburg, Dee. J3.—Informations are to
be made shortly against persons implicated
in the alleged poisoning plot against Home
stead steel workers and sensational devel
opments are expected. As yet the attor
neys for the Carnegie Steel company arc
reticent, as the publication came before
their plans had fully matured.
William H. Caches, treasurer the ad
visory board, canic down from Homestead
to-day, and In an Interview tsaid: "The
charge that any member of the tidvlsor.v
board was a party to any plot to poison
non-union men is as false as it is ridicu
lous. No sane man would believe that any
member of the advisory committee, clothed
In bis right mind would enter into such a
plot." Capt. K. Y. Beck, counsel for the
Carnegip Steel company, limited, and Dep
uty Sheriff Farrell left for Louisville to
night with requisition papers from Gov.
l'attison for Robert J. Bcatty, who is under
arrest there for complicity hi the Home

them the confessions of the cooks ho were
to administer the poison to the non-union
men and were to receive ¥5,000 if the mills

Dcc. 13.—The Cincinnati Pres­
bytery in secret session voted late tbls aft
ernoon upon the second and third ehargss
against l'rof. Henry P. Smith, of the Lane
Theological seminary, and he was found
guilty of both charges. These are the
charges that pertain to his viuws on In
spiration. The second charge was that he
tiAigbt contrary to the fundamental doc
trine of the word of God aud of the con
fession of faith that the holy spirit aid
not so control the inspired writers in their
composition of the holy Scriptures as to
make their utterances absolutely' truthful,
c:*
from error when interpreted
in their natural and intended sense. The
third charge accused him of teaching an
inspiration of the Scriptures in a sense
dltterent from that taught by the Scrip
tures themselves ami by the confession of
... "cse two charges were so rly
alike that It is said that the court argued
them together. The nnal vote is reporled
IS. "V charge second, guilty 36, not guilty
-0 charge third, guilty 32, not guilty 2(1.
A committee was appointed to consider
and report the penalty for the action of
the presbytery at their meeting to-inorrow.
In view of the close vote it is surmised
that the penalty of excommunication will
not be recommended, und possibly not even
more than an admonition, as the committee
is made to include several supporters of
the accused.

TROUBLE AT BELKNAP.
rWO INDIANS KILLED AT THE
AGENCY.
Troops Will Probably Be Necessary
to Capture the Disturbers—
The Trouble Commenced
in a Drunken
Fight.
Send 'Em Troops.
Great Falls, Mont., Special,: Dec. 13.—
Saturday's trouble at the Belknap Indian
ageney is said to have started from a
drunken row. Big Mouth, an Assinnaboine.
was shot and killed by a young buck. After
the killing the latter and his friends fled to
his cabin, where they barricaded the.doors
and prepared to stand off the Indian police,
who rapidly appeared on the scene, headed
by Agent .Simons. As they approached the
cabin they were fifed upon by the Indians in
side. Simons was shot through the calf of
bis leg and an agency horse killed. The at
tacking party retreated, the wouded agent
being taken to his house. No further at
tempt was made then to capture the re
bellious reds, who made the threat that they
would never be taken alive. A notlier
skirmish took place to-day and two more In
dians were killed. At a late hour to-night
no request had been made to the war de
partment for troops, though it is thought
the military may be needed to capture tlie
troublesome ones.
Helena, Dec. 18.—A dispatch from Agent
Simons, of the Belknap agency, to Cov.
Toole reads
"Send troops at once and notify the sec
retary of war. Several Indian soldiers have
been wounded and one killed."
It is believed here to-night that other In
dians have become excited and joined the
defense of the Indian who wounded Agent
Simons.
