HOAR SUGGESTS EXILE .AND
ISOLATION FOR ANARCHISTS.
Senator McComas Advocates Deportation of Aliens of That Ilk Who
Are Now in This Country Death Should Be the Penalty for
Killing or Attempting to Kill the President. In His Opinion
Legislation, He Says, Should lie Framed so Con
spirators, as Well as Assassins, Could
Be Properly Punished.
CONGRESS HAS FULL POWER
Washington, Dec 3. Senator McComas of
Maryland made an extended and carefully
prepared speech in the Senate to-day with
anarchy for his theme, and was followed
by some brief remarks by Mr. Hoar of
Massachusetts on the diflicultles in the way
of dcalirg with anarchist assassins'.
Mr. McComas's remarks showed careful
examination of the legal authorities. He
maintained that Congress had full power
under the Constitution to enact a law pun
ishing with death any person killing a
President, or assaulting the President with
intent to kill, or aiding, inciting or procur
ing such an act. He favored rigid proi
nlons in the immigration laws for the de
portation of alien anarchists.
Mi cli of the speech was devoted to an ex
planation of the dangerous doctrines of
anarchy and the extent to v.hich these
doctrines lud been propagated in recent
years.
ASSASSI.NS OF Rll.EHS
GLOlUKD IX TIIKin CRIMCS.
Senator Hoar's remarks were interesting
as coming from the enerabie chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, which will have
much to do v. 1th the framing of any legis
lation on this subject. lie aid the difficulty
was that af-slns ' Kings and rulers al
ways gloried in their crimes and were in
no wise deterred by the fe.ir of punishment.
For this reason he thought it was almost
useless to multiply punishments.
IIOAK srtitSKSTS KXlLK
AS AX EFKKCTIVC REMEDY.
The most effective remedy, he suggested,
would be to have the civilized nations of
the world agree upon pome desolate spot on
the earth's surface, to which all anarchists
who upheld assassination or the overthrow
of government should be transported.
In such a community the anarchist could
carry out his theories of living without a
government and the world would be rid of
his presence.
Senator McComas, during hi" address, said
in part:
"Within seven years President Carnot,
Prime Minister Canovas del Castillo, the
Empress of Austria. Kins Humbert and
President McKinley have been foully assas
sinated by anarchists. Our homes are still
under the shadow of the national grief for
our best-beloved President, and the heart
of the world Is with us in our sorrow.
FEDERAL LAWS IMPOTENT TO
1'IMMI THIS TERRIilLE CRIME.
"It Is humiliating to consider how impo
tent are our Federal laws to punish the
fearful crime. These tiaglc assassinations
in five countries, widely separated, in so
short a time, show that this hideous crime
of anarchy is increasing.
"To abnormal minds, possessed with this
impulse to homicide, envy and vanity give
a peculiar fascination to the idea of assas
sinating a King or President.
"Congress must legislate against this new
peril with courage, with firmness, but also
with conservatism and prudence.
"The Contitution permits Congress to en
act a law to punish such crimes against the
very existence of the Government the Con
stitution ordained."
After defining the terms of a proposed
statute fixing the death penalty for killing
1

to kill, or advising. Inciting or procuring
such acts, the Senator proceeded as follows
XATIOJi -MCST MIT DEI'E.M) OS
VAIIYIXG LAWS OF THE STATES.
"This sovereign nation is not so weak
that it must depend upon the varying laws
ot its iilllerent states to punish a criminal
who assassinates or attempts to assassinate
the President, who. the Constitution de
clares, shall take care that the laws be
faithfully executed.
"The President is within this peace of the
United States. A person assailing the Pres
ident while in the discharge ot his duties
violates this peace. If the President is re
ceiving the people of our country cr this
representatives of foreign countries. In any
clty. In any of our States, he Is at that
time within the pence of the United Statts.
If. after he pcrtorms such function, he Jour
neys to the White House, and at night,
when asleep, the car wherein he sleeps be
assaulted with dynamite. i?Jch crime is still
n, crime against the peace of the United
States In whatever State the President's
train may be. Can this be doubted?
THE ritKSIDEVT IS
ALWAYS OX DtTV.
"The President's duty is continuous, not
pretermitted. He Is always on duty: he
cannot delegate his highest functions. Until
he dies, or resigns, or ends his term, he is
ever taking care that the law be faithfully
executed. The President Is in the peace of
tho United States at all times and all
places in the Union.
"Congress may go further It may enact
laws to protect the high executive officers;
it may even protect Senators and members
of Congress.
"I am convinced it is wise to legislate now
to protect the head of the State the Presi
dent and the Vice President and the of
ficers on whom the office of President shall
devolve and now go no further. It may be
prudent to declare that this statute Is nut
to he construed to Impair the protecUon al
ready afforded by the law to other officials
of the United States.
CO.VSPIRATOItS TO ASSASSINATE
SHOLXD BE INCLUDED IX LAW.
"Congress should enact a law to give Fed
eral courts Jurisdiction to try and punish
by imprisonment for a term of years two
or more who confederate and conspire to
murder the President or Vice President, or
both, and any of the offices In line of suc
cession to the President, or who advise or
Incite any person to overthrow the Federal
Government or destroy it by force and vio

"This statute should make It a crime with
penalty of imprisonment for a term cf years
Tor any person knowingly to become or con
tinue to be a member of any association,
club, assembly where any person or per
sons advise or incite any of the offenses
before mentioned.
MAILS SHOLXD BE PITRGED
OF ANARCHIST LITERATURE.
"Such statute should make it a crime,
punishable by Imprisonment for a term of
years, for any person or persons to threaten
or to speak, write, print or publish any
works or declarations counseling, advising
or Inciting other persons to willfully kill
or to assault with intent to kill the Presi
dent. The prohibitions, crimes and penal
tics of the postal laws to suppress fraudu
lent and lottery schemes should be extended
to Include the sending through the malls
written or printed anarchist doctrines, or
newspapers counseling or advising the
crimes In the statute mentioned, counsel
ing or advising the subversion or destruc
tion by force and violence of the Govern
ment of the United States.
LAW SHOULD AIM TO PROTECT
RULERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, TOO.
"But this statute will be Incomplete un
less It Included one other feature. It should

Imprisonment for two or more, while In the
United States, to conspire, confederate to

against the law of nations.
AME.N AXARCllIfcTS S1IOI 1.1)
HE EXPELLED AXIJ EXCLIIIED.
"We should enact laws to expel and ex
clude alien anarchists. We shall, at thii
set.-ion. with unanimity, rc-eunet the Chi
nese cclu-ion act. I will cheerfully vote
to exclude the hordes of China ar.d pre
vent the competition of Chinese cheap la
bor. Far mure readily will I vote to ex
clude alien anarchists here now. We havo
naturalized .-mil even native anarchists in
our midst. With these we must contend in
another fashion. Why ..hould we not. m
well, expel alien anarchists for cause?"
The Senator also urged numerous amend
ments of the immigiatlon laws with a view
to excluding anarchists. In concluding, he
Kiid:
"In all times the body of the plain people,
whom Lincoln loved and upon whom Mc
Kinley leaned, arc its unfailing defenders.
This great people, facing the hideous peril
of anarchism, taught by their sorrow to
think straight and see clear, now rate
more highly than ever the value of their
Government, prize more than ever its bene
fits, which are theirs to enjoy and theirs
to transmit. More than ever before are
now revealed to them its blessings, its glory
and its powers."
The Senate passed a bill extending the
life of the Industrial Commission until
February 13, next, to complete the work
it now has In hand.
The committee which will consider an ap
propriate tribute to the late President Mc
Kinley was announced.
The Senate adjourned until next Monday.

HOLDS THE FRIARS KESPOSIIILE.
Representative Cooper Remedy for
Trouble in the I'liIIIpplnea.
nnruiiLic sfecial.
Washington, Dec. 5. As soon as the
House is thoroughly organized and ready to
transact business a bill for the purpose ot
carrying out the recommendations for leg
islation for the Philippines contained in the
President's mesr-nge will be Introduced. The
measure is now practically ready, but U
1-eld back until the Speaker appoints the
cenimittecs.
Representative Cooper, who was chairman
of the House Committee on Insular Affairs,
and who will undoubtedly be reappointed to
that position, has the bill above referred to
in shape.
Mr. Cooper thinks that the most Important
question to lie disposed of Is that relatinr;
to the lands owned bv the friars. He thinks
that the controversy between the ecclesias
tical orders and the natives is at the seat of
nil the trouble between the Filipinos and
the United States authorities!, and that if
the friars can be ellniiuateil from the situa
tion piiico and submiss'oii to the sover
eientv of the United States will speedily fol
low throughout the archipelago. In refer
ring to till-' matter to-dny Mr. Cooper said:
"From mv personal study of conditions in
the Philippines, and as a result of talks
with people who have lived there and who
have busine'-s interests In Manila. I am
thnrouhlv convinced that as- soon as we
can get rid of the friars the-re will be an
end to the opposition of the Filipinos to
American rule."
.MAY DELAY THE "iCEI.V TRIAL.
Technical Point linlveil. Which Is lie
Ins Considered.
Washington. Dec. 3. The prosecution in
the case of tharles Neely, charged with
postal frauds in Cuba, has met with a
check which may cause much delay in the
trial of thi.s ease.
It arpenrs that the prosecution is of neces
sity relying largely upon letteis setting out
testimony taken in the United States. Such
depositions may lie used lawfully, accord
ing to the Spanish practice. Hut the ques
tion has been raised, and has lieen dis
cussed by the Cabinet, is such a proceeding
lawful under the statute by means or
which the extradition of Ncely to Cuba
was secured?
The extradition laws are held by Neely's
friends and counsel to demand for the ac
cused the opportunity to be confronted with
witnesses against himself, or have full op
portunity to cross-examine on depositions,
as he should have under the American legal
practices.
To admit this point would be to greatly
endanger the success of the prosecution, in
the opinion of the officials here, but so far
no decision has been reached.

STRONG BULL MOVEMENT
EXCITES GRAIN MARKETS.
Continued From Pace One.
feed live stock. Many farmers raised
wheat, but produced no corn, and it is the
natural tiling for them to do to feed the
wheat, instead of paying extravagant prices
for corn. So extensive has this practice
become that comparatively little winter
wheat is moving to market, though the
crop was one of the largest ever produced.
COI'.MItV .SPECULATORS
EM'KCT "IIIG IJOI.VS."
The average country speculator thinks
wheat, as well as corn, will sell at very
high prices, and he is" therefore buying
wheat in the speculative market.
Many traders who have taken large profits
in corn are putting their money In wheat. I
ine Dig spring-wneat crop ana me recent
Indifferent export demand have kept many
Board of Trade men on the bear side of
the market, but the local professional trad
ers are getting around to the countryman's
views, now that the spring-wheat move
ment has begun to fall off.
There was a great number of buying or
ders in wheat to-day. which put prices up
over a cent a bushel. Many who bought
lower down were content to take profits,
however, and selling from this source caused
a setback in prices In the final trading. But
the expectation is that the "outside" buy
ing will be large enough to-morrow to give
the market another boost. Hard wheat here
sold at 76 cents, and May whJat in Kansas
City was up to 7T?i cents to-day. The May

The Kansas City Board of Trade floor was
crowded to-day with traders Irom out of
town who have come in to watch their
deals. One man was showing a memoran
dum of 70.C00 bushels of corn and oats bought
some time ago, showing a profit of about
JJ.OuO! A friend asked him why he didn't
sell out and take his profits.
"What's the matter with keeping it for

EXCITED BULLS CONTROL
BUSY NEW YORK MARKET..
REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
New York. Dec. 5. The grain markets
again shot upward at the opening of the?
Produce Exchange this morning, and new
high records for the crop were made.
i-nrn ncnln ndv-nnred In a stronST market
to new h.gh-record prices, while the bullish
enthusiasm which has taken hold of wheat
was augmented, producing an excited mar
ket. Under Chicago's lead, corn for May de
livery sold up to 724 cents a bushel, the
highest fiaurts in recent years, but enor
mous profit-taking during the day forced a
slight reaction at the cloe, so that the
quotations then were from A cent to
cent a bushel below the high figures.
The high price for May wheat In New
York to-day was S3?g cents a bushel, or
nearlv i cents above Wednesday's prices.
In co'rn there was no export business, and
the cash demand came almost entirely Irom
the South and Southwest-
If cables had governed the wheat mar
kets this morning Instead of public buying,
prices would hardly have shown the pro
nounced strength they actually did display
throughout the forenoon. Not only were
Knglish responses unfavorable, but foreign
houses sold wheat locally In moderate quan
tities, thinking possibly that after recent
heavv advances, and with disappointing
cable's, tlie public would be in a prollt
tnklng mood.
For evry outside sale of lone wheat,
however, there were a dozen fresh buying
orders, and the wave that swept over the
markets was us vigorous and extensive
probably as at any time on the bull cam
paign. STORY OF DIRECT SALES
FROM KANSAS TO GERMANT.
Wheat on the first sale touched August's
high point, and was quickly whirling tow
nrd 8fi cents, while corn excelled any price
In recent years. The com situation was re
garded generally as a very strong one. and
the public apparently had every confidence
in the future judging by tha way it took
hold of all coarse grains. Oats was dull
here.
A messase received from Solomon. Has.,
says that the farmers of that county have
recently made arrangements to ship all the
wheat that they do not sell direct to Ameri
can mills to co-operative associations in
Germany. The wheat Is billed direct from
Solomon to Berlin, nr.d It is. therefore, .-old
direct from producer to consumer without
passing through the hands of a single
middleman. It goes by rati from Solomon
to this city, where it goc3 through an ele
vator, which has been leased by the Ger
man associations, and it is then snipped by
steamer to Berlin.
At midday a natural reaction took place
with a decline of ?c to He in the price of
wheat and corn. On this setback con
siderable profit-taking occurred, and the
local traders, gaining courage, went short
of the market to some extent. At the same
time it was a very nervous affair, and
much selling for short account was not con-
sldcrc(i advu.

Bullishness feeds on Its own success.
Sentiment not only looks complacently on
current higher prices, but sanguinely pre
dicts further advancement in values, that
dollar wheat Is not far off, with other
grains in close relations.
Foreign markets are predicted to be soon
forced into the speculative current, but as
ct there is no evidence of this, but rather
only Interest in the spectacular develop
ments as participants. This refers more
particularly to wheaL The local trading in
corn and oats is primarily a duel between
the big professionals on the one hand and
an effort to undermine these holdings on
the other hand.
At present prices corn can no longer be

DIDNT SWALLOW THE DOLLAR.
rrisoner With Supposed Spurious
Coin Startled Police Officer.
William Murphy. 33 years old, who says
that he has no home, created consterna
tion at the Standard Theater last night by
apparently swallowing a dollar, when being
placed under arrest pending investigation
of the charge that the coin was counter
feit. The dollar disappeared. Murphy gulped,
as if making a desperate effort to swallow
something- Officer Smith of the Central
District became greatly alarmed, though.
Murphy seemed unconcerned.
Smith summoned a patrol wagon in which
Murphy was huiried to the Central District
Police Station. There Smith insisted that
he had een Murphy swallow the dollar,
whereat the latter was hurried to the City
Hospital. Doctors examined him, and asked
sympathetically whether he felt pain. Mur
phy said that he didn't feel any pain: that
he didn't know anything about the alleged
dollar.
Meantime a telephone message reached
the hospital conveying the information that
a com naei oeen rouna in tne patrol wagon.
Murphy was taken back to the police sta
tion, where he is held.
