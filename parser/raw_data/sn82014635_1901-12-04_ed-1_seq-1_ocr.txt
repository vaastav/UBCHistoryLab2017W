he doubted the effect of public subversion
of corporation finances apparently hold
ing the belief that the publication of
profits secured by these bodies would
merely in flame the agitation against
them.
The Daily Telegraph says it would have
been an Inconceivably disastrous blunder
to have opposed America's wishes in thi-s
matter and thus drive her to build a
still greater fleet than she already con
templates, which, it is safe to predict.
will, twenty years hence, making the
United States the second sea power in
the world.
The Telegraph thinks that President
Roosevelt's policy is calculated rather to
diminish than, to increase Europe's ex
aggerated dread of "the American dan
ger."
The Standard Is similarly of the opinion
that nothing in the message need in the
smallest degree excite anxiety or ap
prehension abroad. This paper comments
upon the president's uncompromising as
sertion of the Monroe Doctrine as som
what ncesary, Insomuch as there is lit
tle desire on the part of any foreign
power to extend its area of militarism
to the new world.
The message is disappointed that the
message contains no echo of the late
President McKinley's pronouncement,
"the period of exclusion is over," and
comments mainly upon President Roose
velt's unexpected moderation. The Post
says there is not a line of the anticipated
challenge to the political machine, but
rather a strong disposition to conciliate
the Republican majority.
The Daily Chronicle hopes that, al
though President Roosevelt shows great
i ' nderness for protection susceptibilities,
his proposed policy is a step in the direc
tion of free trade. The paper considers
his cautious and tentative proposals con
cerning trusts to show that the office of
president has a sobering effect even on
the most buoyant of natures.
GERMANY THRILLED
Berlin, Dec. S. The message of Pres

They Testify to Having Bor

"Washington, Dec. 3. The case of Mrs.
Lola Ida Bonine, on trial for the mur
der of James Seymour Ayres, Jr., is
expected to go to the jury the latter part
of this week. Three witnesses, intimate
friends of Ayres, were put on the stand
today and swore that they had seen a
revolver in Ayres room. Two of them.
Duncan B. Hubbard, and Thomas Ford,
had come from Michigan to testify. They
said tho revolver greatly resembled the
one in evidence. The wrapper worn by
Sirs. Bonine on the night of the" tragedy
was again the subject of discussion, the

r. '.M,!iiit Roosevelt's message to con-'
f-
l.tiy N-ws, in an editorial on
f. ,;, ,-t. sa
' "-hows a ! id man struggling with
rosting of a bulletin containing Presi
dent Roosevelt's utterances about trusts.
The shares of the steamship companies
fell 1 or 2 points on account of immigra
tion Inspection paragraph and the pro
posed development of the merchant ma
rine. Several financial journals aver that
there is no reason "why the United State
should encourage ship building. They
say that if the United States becomes
possessed of a commercial fleet, she will
have to build it. Inasmuch as the at
tempts to buy German lines of steamers
have been defeated.
President Roosevelt's words concerning
the restriction of immigration contain
an unpleasant suggestion in tho present
time of depression, when, as the Ber
liner Volks Zeitung says, tho hard times
make an overflow of laboring population
of Europe necessary. The free trade
and Liberal newspapers welcome .the
reciprocity recommendations," but regret
that President Roosevelt did not recom- j
mend specific tariff reduction. The first
impression of the president's message in
German official circles is that the re
pression of anarchists by international
agreement is much more" likely to be
carried through upon the initiative of tho
1'nited States than that of any other
expert who had testified that a careful
examination of the wrapper had failed
to disclose the presence of any blood
spots thereon.
The pistol with which James Seymour
Ayres, Jr., was killed at the Kenraore
hotel last May and for whose murder
Mrs.. Lola Ida Bonine is undergoing trial,
figured prominently In today's proceed
ings of the case. Duncan B. Hubbard
of Mount Clemens, Mich., who formerly
lived at the Kjenmore, testified that
he had seen a pistol in a bureau drawer
In Ayres' room and identified the weapon
in evidence as being very similar to it.
Thomas Ford of Sanalac county, Michi
gan, testified that while on a visit here
last January, Ayres had loaned him a re
volver. The witness described the weapon
in detail and said that the one with
which the killing was done closely re
sembled it, even to certain marks on the

Report of inmates of Penitentiary Is
Made in Knox's Message.
"Washington, Dec. S. The attorney gen
eral's annual report to congress shows
that there was an Increase of 31 cases
docketed during the year on the United
States supreme court appelate docket,
and a decrease of three in the number
disposed of, leaving SS6 remaining on the
docket at the close of the year. The num
ber of cases actually considered by the
court was 363, of which 179 were argued
orally and IE subjnitted on printed briefs.
Of the 36S appelate cases disposed of 1C
wer aftirmed. 57 reversed, 5S dismissed,
24 settled by the parties; in nine questions
certified were answered and SO were deni-.
als of petitions for writs of certorari un
der the act of March 3, 19L
The report shows that during the year
there were -i,S41 United States prisoners
serving sentences in penitentiaries; 1,611
were discharged during the year and 1.G50
were received; 41 decided and 63 were
pardoned. Of the number received 1.0S7

were foreign born; 1,620 males and 30 fe
males; 1. 171 could read and write; 32
could read only and 457 could neither
read nor write.
The attorney general urges an Increase
in the appropriation for a new depart
ment of justice building; suggssts, that
congress consider the advisability of
adopting a new and uniform system of
commutation with respect to federal pris
oners, and recommends that the salaries
of the United States judges be increased
He aiso urged legislation definlnrr the
methods by which additional testimony
may be taken before tho Spanish treaty
claims commission and asks for increased
appropriations for tho expenses of tho
commission, n airo recommends me es
tablishment of an insular and territorial
bureau of the department of justice.

TO FORGIVE AND FORGET
United States Will Not Demand
Claims of Spain for Sinking Maine
Washington, Dec. . 3. Counsel for tht
government have presented to the Span-
ish treaty claims commission a brief in
support of the motion to dismiss the
claims growing out of the sinking of the
battleship Maine. It is contended that it
was the intention of the treaty of peace
not to provide for, but to relinquish and
leave in oblivion, as settled in the tribunal
of war, the grievances referred to so ex
pressly in the joint resolution of April Jt
as "the destruction of a United States
battleship with 2ec of its officers and crew
while on a friendly visit in the harbor of
Havana."
The brief says that tho destruction of
handle. He also testified that when Ayres i Spanish lives and the loss of Spanish pos
sessions atoned for and settled any sup
posed responsibility of Spain for the de
struction of that national ship with its
oilier rs and crew.

Colon, Colombia, Dec 3. According to
news just received here, the interior of
the country Is almost entirely quiet Only
a few scattered and insurgent hands are
here and there waging general warfare.
This causes tl government no anxiety.
The triumph of the Colombian conser
vative government on the Isthmus will
doubtless incalculably strengthen the
government's hands. A peace commission
composed of Florencia Arosemea, repre
senting prominent liberals of Panama;
Manuel Amador, representing the Colom
bian government and General De La
Rosa, secretary to the insurgent general,
Domingo Diaz, which will act as guide,
has already started for the interior to
obtain an interview with Generals Diaz
and Lugo and induce them to give up the
struggle and rturn to Panama. Senor
Amador is empowered to grant a reason
able terms to General Diaz In tho name
of the government. The peace commis
sioners are expected to return to Panama
today. It is already rumored, however,
that Generals Diaz and Lugo are about
surrender. Pananome in tho department
of Panama and tho Port Tumaco. in the
department of Cuea, are now the only
points under liberal control. Consider
ing the present strength of the govern
ment upon the Isthmus, owing to the re
inforcements landed here by tho Colom
bian gunboat General Plnson, and with
tho facility with which this ship can
bring in additional forces from Barran-
quilla and other coast points, and owing
to the comparative quiet in the Interior,
it Is not unreasonable to conclude that
tho government will soon be victorious
at Pananomo and Tumaco. There is a
possibility of further bloodshed at these
places, bat General Alban's recent suc-
