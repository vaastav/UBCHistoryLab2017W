Features Worthy of Consideration.
Aside from the fact that the Herald
Square moving pictures embody the
very latest and beet subjects to be had
in the moving picture world, there are
other things interesting to the theatre
goec. They are guaranteed to be' per
fectly steady and distinct, without the
usual flicker which is so trying to the
eye. 1 bo machine is made absolutely
fire-proof, thereby eliminating tbls
source of annoyance. There are no in
termissions during which restless indi
viduals, under various pretexts, climb
over those who prefer to retain their
seats, coming back with a rush when
the next picture is started. The enter
tulnment, when qnc beg in, continues
smoothly to the end. Those who enjoy
a spicy yet in every way clean enter

Weep not for me when In the grave
You've laid my peaceful head,
Nor when returning to your home.
You've left me with the dead.
E'en when at home, O! do not weep
To see my vacant place.
Nor whisper soft my name and sigh
Because you miss my face.
Weep not for me, I am happy, safe,
At home among the blest, "
Amid the holy, blessed throng
I shall forever rest.
A few more years will pass away
And we shall pass away.
We'll meet at home in Christ's abode
And ever there remain.
Weep not for me, I am secure,
1 am saved through Jesus' blood
And all my sins are washed away
In that dear precious blood.
Weep not for me though I no more,
But trust ye in Bis word,
I am happy, safe forever mora,
I am present with the Lord.
