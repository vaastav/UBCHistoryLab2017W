Washington Dec 4The vIews of
Wahingon vew
members of both house concerning the
message are freely expressed
ExSpeaker Reed said cI Is e
ceedlnply disappointing both In matter
and manner On the Hawaiian ques
tion we are left as much in the dark
a ever and must wait till news by
the next steamer just a we have been
waiting so long That part of the mes
sage which relates to The tariff asser
vates that the House committee in
charge of that subject has formulated
plans and devised methods cf taxa
tion which as a member of the com
mittee I have not even heard pro
posed I Is a rather unusual sensa
tion to learn the deeds of the committee
tee not In the committee room but
from the president of the United States
Has that committee ceased to be com
posed of both parties and has i with
out even the formality of a word In
wor
1 open committee informed the president
of Its determination in such a way
that the president can officially com
municate i to the House How long
Jta i been a part of our system that
a committee which controls the turse
shall report to Congress through the
president Is this the result of the I
rumored blending of the anpolntlve
with the legislative power I Is bad
enough to have a tariff bill made up
In a little coterie but to have It com I
municated to the president before i
reaches e the committee Is still
worse The House shows a determina
tion to be moved bv no facts and mod
ified by no arguments which makE

THE AMEUICAS PRESS
The San Francisco Call Republi
can says Clevelands message cov
ers a great deal of ground but upon
points on which Information was look
ed for little light Is thrown In respect
to the tariff as was expected the r
cult of the elections of 1893 Is disregarded
garded In respect to the Hawaiian
problem the m ag assumes ss facts
sttement which are evidently dis
puted
Springfield Mass Union The
president stands squarely for tariff re
form of the Wilson variety but Ig
nores the lesson taught by the last
election and assumes the people are
anxious for a radical revision of the
existing schedules His allusion to
the work of aiding the people through
the work of tariff reform is mislead
ing for It Is perfectly clear the people
are suffering today as the result of a
general fear the policy which he ad
vocates i be carried out
Philadelphia Telegraph The docu
ment makes a wilderness of words
covering ev ry possible ubject before
the executive fcr his official cognizance
and gives far more attention to divers
and sundry Irrelevant and unimportant
things than i does to others which
are not only foremost in the public
mind at this time but which must be
earnestly cons dered and for time b

the whole a clear wellwritten and i
businesslike document and except on
the Hawaiian and silver questions will 1
prove fairly satisfactory to the coun
try The Hawaiian matter Is destined
to make trouble for the administration I
and Mr Cleveland appears to have a
foreboding of this but he proposes to
adhere t the policy which he ha
marked out His views on the finan
cial question are wise
St Louis Republic If the
St Loui RepublcIf message
outlines any special policy it is tat

his pen traces the name Grover
Cleveland at the bottom of the tariff

trymen a an administrator
Pioneer Press St PaulWe can find
In this message evidence only of the
unadmlrable qualities of dullness and
jealousy that leave even to his partisans I
tisans no room for enthusiasm over
the beginning of this administration
The Chicago Times general tone of
comment is unfavorable
The Chicago InterOcean says the
tone of the message is commonplace
The Chicago Record says i is a
message of economy
The Herald and Tribune both after
noon newspapers have been proscrib
ed in Mexico This afternoon the car
riers were met at the international

I do not care to do so I am a Repub

suggestions and recommendations are
not in accordance with my ideas I

jojed I
London Dee 4The News will say I
t of Clevelands message I is well
worthy of the national crisis In which
it is delivered The inference from Mr
I Clevelands facts and figures whether
Intended or not Is i is the true pol
icy to cultivate close relations with us
II seems generally agreed that the new
tariff proposals will not largely affect
I our trade with the United States
The Chronicle In the references
I to Brazil and the Behring sea In
President Clevelands message there
is nothing that might not have been
fathered by President Harrison I
Is otherwise with reference to Hawaii
In awaiting Clevelands decision the
friction that would probably have
been caused thereby by interference
at the time has been avoided but the
result Is the same
In regard to the reform of the tar
iff the Chronicle says while the presi
dent will have the good wishes of
every sound economist in the battle
he has begun i would be premature
to regard it as already won because
the biggest battalions are at present
on his side
Telegraph The portion of the
message which displays President
Cleveland at his best is the reference
to Hawaii Such a frank and honest
admission of a mistake and a declar
ation of Intention to reverse it reflects
the highest possible credit upon the
president and indirectly upon the na
tion also The president Is evidently
convinced that the American public
I would be magnanimous enough to up
hold his action and he was probably
right in so thinking
I The Morning Post President Cleve I
lands abstention from party rhetoric
at the expense of his opponents is all
the more creditable as his opportunli
ties for the employment of scathing
invectives were exceptional The
Post expresses surprise that the Ha I
waiian Incidents are mentioned in the
message without any expression of i
shame or indication I
The Daily Graphic Mr Cleveland
is t be congratulated upon his firm
ness and consistency
The Times The portions of the
message bearing upon foreign affairs
are conceived In a highly creditable
spirit Considering the chauvinism of
our American kinsfolk i is more
creditable that the president has
frankly admitted the wrong done to
I HawaI Mr Cleveland would doubt
I less be Inclined to go a deal further
I than the Wilson bill but recognized the
obstacle to progress caused by the
deficit in the Wilson bill I will benefit
the American workingmen and place
I the manufacturers upon something like
a level with their foreign conpetltors
Whether thee changes in the long
run will benefit British industry and
trade is doubtful
The Standard From our point of
view and in spite of Mr Clevelands
friendly attitude towards England we
IfrendlY also regard the proposed new
tariff as the work of an enemy Its
I natural consequence is to create a new
competitor for the old business abroad
and we can only hope the experience
and benefit of cheap raw materials
directions may lead to better things in other

Washington Dee 4A result of the
recent elections has been to bring joy
I to at least one section of the Demo
secton
I cratic party The territories which
have been knocking for admission to
the union some years now feel cheered
by the outlook Democratic delega
tions from Arizona New Mexico and
Utah are expected arrive In the city
immediately after the opening of the
session to urge upon the party in Con
gress the necessity of prompt action
on measures conferring statehood on
the territories
I seems to be an Inexorable law that
political events must move In cyclones
and the demoralization of the party
in the recent elections has warned
the older leaders of a general defeat
next year and the turning over of the
House of Representatives to the Re
publican majority as among the POd
sibilities Then too the power of the
House of Representatives ever since
the reconstruction has alternated with
mechanical regularity and if the rule
of the past Is to be a criterion to the
future the Republican hope of
Republcn supre
macy in the lower house of the next
Congress may be fairly realized
The possibility added to the other
fears which has become general in
geneal
Democratic ranks that the United
States Senate to be chosen to enter up
on the term of office March 1895 may
make that body Republican makes
the leaders anxious t gain at once
whatever political advantage it is pos
sible to derive from the new territories
Measures for the admission of New
I Mexico Arizona and Utah are now
pending in Congress and are to be
pressed to a vote without heedless de
lay The delegates from all these
territories are now Democrats and it
is confidently asserted by Democrats
of the prospective states that there
Is no doubt the United States senators
and congressmen to be elected In the
new states will be of the same political
faith and thus materially asblst to main
tain the supremacy of the Democracy
in Congress as well as mocrcy a
Congess wel a furish a sig

next presidential contest
The House committee on territories
has shown unprecedented punctuality
In disposing of these punctualty
bills for the admission of New Mexico
I Arizona and Utah all have been re
ported favorably and will
favorbly wi come up
I early for consideration in the House
Senator Faulkner chairman of the
I Senate committee on territories says
I prompt acton w111 be taken on the
statehood bills by his committee
commite
The House report favoring the ad
I mission of Utah is of peculiar interest
because of the hitherto deepseated
opposition to its admission on account
i of the predominance of the Mormon
i slement The report is prefaced by the
proclamation of President Harrison Is
I sued last January declaring polygamy
I dead In the territory and granting free
I amnesty and pardon to all offenders
previous to Nov 1 1890 who have
since led a lawful lfe The reports
and recommendations of the judges
and various commissioners are also
I quoted a great length The committee
further says many myriads of people
who heretofore have looked upon the
Mormons as moral outlaws It is be
lieved will change their opinion and
admit that a people showing the characteristics
acteristics the Mormons possess are at
least worthy of statehood with full
admission to all the rights of Ameri
can citizenship
The committee concludes as follows
AH mouths should be hushed and all
opposition silenced after the president
has amnestied past offenses after both
political parties In national convention
assembled have declared the time has
come for the admission of all the ter
ritories of which Utah Is one after
the territorial conventions of 1S92
wherein both of said great parties de
clared for statehood and hat 1 the hour
Is ripe for the admission of Utah
after the legislature of Utah lies de
clared unanimously for statehood
after the governor of the territory all
of Its judiciary all of whom are Re
publican in politics have declared in
their opinion polygamy Is abolished
and at an end after l the members
of the Utah commission created ex
pressly to crush and obliterate polvc
amy have declared their work practi

church through all its heads and of

way possible for mortals to do and to
proclaim have with bowed heads i

honor that never more In the future

THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
The following Is the full text of the
writ of habeas corpus
The applicant Wade Nicholas your
petitioner respectfully shows to your
honor that he Is unlawfully Imprisoned
and detained confined and restrained
of his liberty by Nat M Brigham
United States marshal for Utah ter
ritory at Salt Lake city territory of
Utah
That said Imprisonment detention
confinement and restraint are illegal
and that the Illegality thereof con
sists in this towit
On the 20th of Sept 1S92 your pe
titioner was arraigned for trial befor
the Second judicial district court of
Utah territory upon an indictment foe
murder at a regular term of said
court begun and held at Beaver city
Beaver county Utah and on the 24th
day of Sept 1892 It was ordered ad
judged and decreed by the judg of
said court that your petitioner was
guilty of the crime of murder and that
he be punished by Imprisonment in
the penitentiary of the territory of
Utah for the term of twentyfive

ord of any verdict found by a jury of

sage
Washington Dec 4The first ses

sembled at noon
On many desks were floral tributes
from admirers of the respective oc
cupants
VicePresident nt Stevenson had been
remembered with a large basket of
roses Bunches of roses lay on the
desks ofDolph and the doughty cham
pion of the white metal Stewart was
the recipient of a basket of beautiful
Marechal Neils
Neis
The galleries were filled and a touch
of color lent to the scene by the bright
winter toilets of the ladies present
After the vicepresidents gavel fell
the blind chaplain was led to the desk
and delivered an eloquent prayer
The roll call showed fiftysix sena
torS present After the passage of the
the House
usual resolution notifying
of thq meeting of the Senate and the
appintment of a committee to join a
like committee from the House to wait
on the president and notify him of the
assembling of Congress and one fixing
the time of the meeting at noon each
day the Senate took a recess ot one
hour to enable the committee to wait
on the president
At the expiration of the recess the
Senate reconvened and a message was
received from the House of the ap
pointment of a committee to wait on
the president
Another recess of twenty minutes
was taken On reassembling the com
mittee to wait on the president an
nounced the accomplishment of its
duty and that the president would at
once communicate with the Senate
Secretar Pruden then stepped for
ward and delivered the message t the
vicepresident who laid I it before the
I Spnntp and Secretary Cox at once be
iif reading
i All present with a few exceptions
gave close attention when the read
ing began
Dolph gave attention to his old file
of bills for a few moments but prick
ed up ears as the reading reached the
Hawaiian paragraph There was a
general changing about in the seats
of the Senators when that portion of
the document dealing with Hawaii was
approached Many Senators had how
ever anticipated the secretarys read I
ing by turning in their printed copies
After this there was an evident falling
ing off in the interest of the Senators
but their attention briefly revived
when the paragraph concerning bonds
was reached
When this had passed the Senators
gradually left their seats and drifted
Into the cloak rooms so that by the
time the time the reading of twothirds
had been concluded only twentyfive
Senators were in the chamber and the
majority of these were engaged in con
versation among themselves
The reading was concluded at 3
having occupied one hour and a half
Dolph immediately rose and said
there had been distributed in the Sen
ate printed copies of what purported
to be the message of the president In
which on page 9 he found a part of
the page devoted to Hawaii He did
not hear that portion read from the
desk He desired to know and thought
the country did also whether that
part was Inadvertently of purposely
omitted by the secretary or whether
the copies which had been circulated
were not true copies of the message
The vicepresident responded that
the portion of the message relating to
Hawaii had been Inadvertently omitted
by the secretary and directed it be
read This was done and Dolph gave
notice that he would on tomorrow
address the Senate on that part of the
message
The message was ordered to He on
the table

tary Gresham was busy yesterday

nothing can be learned but the facfi

Three Ways to Happiness
Of ways for becoming happier not
happy I could never Inquire out mare
than three The first rather an
elevated road Is this To soar away
so far above the clouds of life that
you see the whole external wolrd with
its wolf dens enamel houses and
thunder rods lying far down beneath
you shrunk Into a little childs garden
The skyward track however Is fit only
for the winged portion of the human
species for the smallest The second
is simply to sink down Into its little
garden and there to nestle yourself
so snugly so homewlss In some furrow
that in looking out from your warm
lark nest you likewise can discern no
wolf dens charnel houses or thunder
rods but only blades and ears every
one of which for the nest bird is a
tree a sun screen and a rain screen
The third finally which I look upon
as the hardest and cunningest is that
of alternating between the two The
foregoing second way Is not good
enough for man who here on earth
should take Into his hand not the
sickle only but the plow But even
by walking a man rests and recovers
himself for climbing T > y little joys and
duties for great Joan Paul RIchter
