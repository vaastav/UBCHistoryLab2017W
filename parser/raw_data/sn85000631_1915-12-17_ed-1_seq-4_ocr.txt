Cheer! Xmas is comingt The Day of the year when we
should be happy—and make other people happy. The custom of
giving gifts has often been said to become a thing of the past, but still it is growing every year,
and what better way can we find to make others happy than with a nice gift, and especially a use
ful gift. Qive a friend a gift he likes and can use--see how happy he is. There is greater pleasure,
in giving than receiving—if, you give in the right spirit, and the right gift.
There is no limit to the amount of articles you can select from a stock as large as we carry,
especially, including all the merchandise bought purposely for Xmas time.
Here you can find a suitable gift for any member of any family or for any entire family at a
reasonable price, and a gift that will be appreciated.
Suitable Gifts for the Entire Family
For Father or Brother
When undecided vwhat to buy visit us,
we are always at your service, and glad to
assist you with suggestions and ideas.
When buying one gift for an entire
family you can find no better place than
this store. There are so many things here
to select from, and just the things mostly
appreciated by a family.
Special Special
For one week commencing Dec. 13th,
we will give with $1. or over purchase of
Xmas goods, a box of sunshine Multi Bar
Wafers.
Don't forget that a box of Arn^or Plate
sox is a most suitable gift for man or boy.
Make This Store Your Xmas Store
And Remember
our stock of Fall and Winter goods is still
complete. The prices are right, and the
merchandise is the best quality we can
buy. The amount of merchandise we have
sold and, the amount of satisfied custom
ers we have, is proof of the quality of our
merchandise.
Yours for a Merry Xmas
