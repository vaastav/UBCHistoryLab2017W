PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tlio Mussago being moat ton lung for
our oolumiis, wo havo mule a synopsis of
it as follows:
Tho mossago opan.) with tlio statement
that during tha past year success has uttou
del tho effort to onforco tho laws and (lie
period Ins boon one of g3nor.il prosperity
to tho nation. Tlio disasters sustained by
Btorni and firo, though moro extensive than
usual, havo served to develop tho friend
ship of foreign nations.
Tho relations of tho United States with
foreign powers continues to be fric/idly,
and reference is undo to the settlement by
peaceful arbitration of the long standing
disputos with great Britian; and the mode
of settlement commended as an example for
other civilizod nations. Tha necessary
legislation on the part of the United States
to make operative tho provision* of tlio
treaty relating to tho fisheries, and other
matters touching tho relations of the United
States towards the British North American
possessions,is recommended.
Directions havo boen given for the with
drawal of the protection extended to Ger
mans iu Franco by diplomatic and consu
lar represenattives of tho United States in
that country sinec tho resumption of dip
lomatic relations between Franco and Ger
many.
The ratification of the consular ami nat
uraliied conventions with the Austro-IIun
garian Empire has boen exchanged.
The anocxation of the States of the
Church to the Kingdom of Italy aud tho
removal of the capital to Rouio has been
officially recognized, and in the ratifica
tion of a new treaty of commcrco which
has been oxchangcd tho contracting pow
ers havo agreod that private property at
se? shall be exempt from capture in case
of war between them.
Tho mixed commission, authorities by
tho Forty-first Congress, for adjudciating
upon the claims of citizens of tlio United
States against Spain, growing out of tho
insurrection in Cuba, has been organized.
The conference at Washington between
the plenipotentiaries of Spain and the al
lied South American Republics, presided
over by tho United States, has rosulted in
an armistice, with reasonable assurance of
permanent peace.
The course of tho Russian Miuister at
Wasiingtou, his personal abuse of govern
ment officials, aud interference with the re
lations between the United States anil
other Powers, rendered it necessary to ask
his recall. This, however, has not dis
turbed tho friendly relations between tho
Unitod States and Russia and tho visit of
the Grand Duke is citied as evidence that
there is no desire on the part of the Em
peror's government to diminish the cordi
ality of those relations.
A desiro to put an end to the bavborous
treatment of American ship-wrecked sailors
on the ocean coast led to an endeavor to
ooncludo a convention with China having
that end in view. A small party sent out
in futherance of this purpose was treacher
ously attacked at a disadvantage, aud in
the absence of explanation or apology the
forts from which the outrages had been
committed were reduced. Under the cir
eumstances it was impracticable to con'
elude tho desired convention The subject
is loft for such action as Congress may sec
fit to take.
The bopo is expressed that Mexico maj
late more stringent measures for restrain
ing lawless persons on its frontier, and rc>
lieve our Government of the difSeultief
experienced from this cause.
Action by Congress is reoommended re
garding tbo overduo installments under tin
award of tho Vonerula Claim Couimissiot
of 1866.
It is remorked as a subjoet for congrat
ulation that Brazil has taken tke initiator]
4tep toward tbo abolition of slavery
and tho rccommcndatiou is made to Con
gress to provide by stringent legislation i
suitably remedy against tho holding, owt
ing or dealing in slaves, or being iutercstot
ill slave properly in foreign lands.
The protracted strugglo in Cuba in re- j
fared lo as a souroc of tunoysncoand mix-|
ietj, and American naval commanders in !
Cuban waters have been instructed tosparo |
no effort to protect the live* and property i
of AmeMcan citizens mid maintain the dig-!
nity of (ho flag. Tlio hope is expressed ;
that all pending questions with Spain, j
growing out of affairs in Cuba, may bead
justed in aconciliatory spirit
An appropriation for the support in Chi
na niid Japan each of four American youths
to serve as part of our Ministry there und
iU to the efficiency of our diplomatic rcla
tlons is rt'comendod, Liberal measures for
the support of thj American lines of steam
ers on the Pacific arc also advised.
The reduction of tlio national debt du
ring the year Is stated at ?80,907,120 80,
and hy the substitution of bonds at a low
er rate of Interest it is claimed that the in
terest on tin) public debt is nearly $17,
000,000 less tliau on the 1st of May, 18li9.
[ii view of theso results which have
strengthened tlio public credit, it is not
desirablo that tliu present resources of the
country should continue to be taxed in or
der to continue this rapid payment, and a
modification of (ho tarifT and internal tax
laws is aecjrdingly reoommonded. Of tho
latter it is rccom mended that all taxes bo
abolished except thoso from liquors, tobac
co ami stamps. In readjusting tho tariff
tho President rocommcnds tlmt articles of
general consumption not produced at home
should lie placed on the freo list, nnd if
further reduction be advisable that it bo
made upon articles that can best bear it
without disturbing homo production.
As a proof of the President's financial
sagacity, the axiom is advanced that if "tho
question can bo met as how to give a fixed
value to our currenoy, that constantly aud
uniformly approaching par with spccie, a
very desirablo object will be gained."
For tho operations of und oxponso of
umintaiuing tho army Congress is referred
to tho report of tho War Secretary, and
loiiio recommendations relating to promo
tion are submitted.
Th? President states that there is an im
provement in tho Dumber and efficiency of
the naval force, without material increase
in tho expense of supporting it; details
briefly what tho navy has dono within the
past year, and makes recommendations as
to promotion in the service.
In tho Post Office Department a grati
fying increase of business and enlarged re- j
eeipts are anuounoed, indicating a grad
ual approach toa self-sustaining basis of this
branch of tho publio servico, though it is
not expectcd this desirablo end will be
readied at present. A union of tlio tele
graph and postal systems is oaruestly re
commended.
The President details his proceedings in
ccmncction with the enforcement of the
Ku-Klux law, basing the necessity for tho I
suspension of tho habeas corpus and pro-1
mulgatiou of martial law upon the report
of the Outrage Committee. A large num
ber of persous have been arrested by his
minions, tho President says, and because
others have abandoned their homes, it is
falliciously usutned that they aro violators
of law
Polygamy in Utah is to be put down.
Tho Mormons, the President says, will be
protected in tho worship of God according
to the dictates of their consciences, but
they sha'nt enjoy, like tho prophets of old, j
plural wives. The propriety of logitima-;
tizing, hy act of Congress, all children
born prior to a uaine fixed iu tho act, is
suggested.
Tho Indian policy of tho administration
is commended as having been attended
with favorable results?a view of tho situ
ation altogether different from that repre
sented by the peopls of Arizoua and other
of the far wes tern territories.
Tho President thinks that educational
interests my bo served by tho grant of the
proceeds of tho sales of publio lauds to the
settlers, and is of opinion that thcro is
room, for caution in tho way in which
they have been disposed of, i. e. by grant
to land-grabbing railroad corporations.
The subject of inorcased compensation
to the heads of bureaus and officials hold
ing positions of responsibility is adverted
to, and tho attention of Congress invited to
tho matter.
The President thinks that as six years
have elapsed since tlio close of the war
it might be well to consider whether it is
not now time that the disabilities imposed
by the Fourteenth amendment should bo
removed. He is unab!o to see the advan
tage or propriety of excluding men from
offico merely bccauso they were before the
rebellion of standing and character suffi
cient to be elected to positions requirtog
them to take oaths to support the Constitu
tion. and admitting to eligibility thoso en
tertaining precisely tlio same views, hut of
less standing in tbeir communities, and re
fers tbu question to tho careful considera
tion of Congress, with an expression of tho
conviction that it will bo a happy condition
of tho country when tli>! old citir.cns of the
Southern States will 'tiko an iutorjai in
public affairs,
The organization of * territorial govern
ment in (lie District of Columbia, is pro
nounced a success; ami liberal appropria
tion* nre n*kc<l of Congress for onrrjing
out a judicious system i?f iuiproveiiienis in
the ciipiml. Appropriation! are al?o a>ked
for the rebuilding of the burned govern
ment propctry ill Chicago.
Legislation for the protection of immi
grants against impositions practicud upon
them is asked for.
The oiin of the administration, the Pres
ident snys, has boon to enforce honesty and
efficiency in all tlio public offices, but that
this aim Ins fallen far short of the mark is
to be In furred from the fact that civil service
reform is pronounced the one thing need
ful to correct tlio numerous abuses. A
plan for reforming the civil service is,
the President says being devised by a
board of gentlemen ho convened under
a recent act of Congress, which he
thinks will redound to the true interests
of the public service, and the message
closes with tlio President's promise to give
this experiment a fair trial.
PERSONAL.
The child-like individual who sets up
the editorials of his rebel masters on the
Point Pleasant lloj inter, lashes himself in
to a red hot fury because we punctured liiin
in ? tender spot concerning his toadyism
and political troaoliery?says wa oheated
him nut of ten dollars. This put into
plain English means tlmt wo detected him
in a sly trick to draw money from the
State Troasury upon pretonded contracts,
and sent him off with a lloa in his ear, and
with a littlo wholesome advice uot to bo
caught in such disreputable business again
or we might put him where the dogs
wouldn't bark at him.?State Journal.
William K. Stevenson, Esq,, editor of
tho Piirkorsburg Stale Journal, and lat?
Governor of West Virginia, in the above
article, in an effort to screen himself from
tho payment of ten dollars, justly due this
office by private contract, casts an imputa
tion upon our honor, by publishing "that
ioc Jetectr.il liim in a tl<] trick to draw mo
n kj from the. State Treasury u/m pretend
ed contrails." In a wrfrd, Mr. Stevenson,
wo deuounco this as a malicious slander,
and you, sir, as a base and wilful liar; and
demand of you to make good your chargc.
When, where, and for what, did we over
present account, or accounts, against tho
Statu Treasury, for services that we had
not rendered? Until you bring tho proof
of this, we charge and,brand you as a cow
ard, a slanderer and a liar.

John Hall, Esq , publishes a letter in |
tho last Mason County Journal, addressed j
to Lewis Baker, Esq., Chairman of tho i
Demooratio Executivo Committee of this
State, resigning .his membership on the
National Democratic Executive Committee.
This action of Mr Hall, is both timely
and in good taste, aud will bo a sourco of
gratificatjon to many West Virginia Dem
ocrats.
The Parkersburg Timet is getting wrong;
it is "going over to the rebels " We look
for a general reading out of the Timn from
the Republican party. It says most em
phatically that it is 'opposed to President
Grant's re-nomination and re-election."?
We knew that Drnhosh could not but do
this. His liberal ideas would not permit,
without stultification, his support of Grant.
Tho Wheeling lntellijenccr has not tho
courage to be thus plain.

I W. E. Stevenson, editor of tho Stale
j Journal, and who onco disgraced the gub
: ernatorial chair of this State, is tho dirti
est and fuulcst-mouthcd editor and the
1 bitterest proscriptionist, and vilest oppress
! or that treads tho soil, and pollutes tlio
namo of West Virginia. He has uo moro
idea about jourcalistic decency than a "hog
has about a holiday,"
Extra (Billy) Stevenson, the repudiated
governor of West Virginia, and defunct
radical politician generally, has raised tho
question of eligibility of certain members
eleot to the reform Convention, because of
their sympathy with the South, during our
civil war. We uotico that several of our
Democratic contcmporaies are giving prom
' inenco to his jackanapical scribbling!, just
' as if he could take a common sense view
1 or form a oorrect opinion in regard to any
subject whatever. Of all arrant humbugs
that we know, this man Stevenson bears off
! the palm. Sic transit (vomit.)? States

Hon. Lyman Trumbull, Radical Senator
from Illinois, in a recent speech, uttered
i these ominous sentences:
"Tho wholo land is sick rf Radicalism.
! Tho people want poaoo and the reduotiou
| of taxes They know the Ku-Klux to bo
: myths, and they are not willing to oontin
uo tho war six yoars after tho cessation of
1 hostilities. Wo must havo peace, and the
Radical party has signallv failed givo it to
1 us."

Hen. D. W. Voorhees.
Terre Haute, Indian*. No. 27. Jinn.
Daniel W. Voorbeei. in a card published
in the Journal of ibis city, propose* an
important democratic movement. He says:
"I keenly appreciate the importance of an
authoritative expression of tlic principles
wnich are to guide us in the future as in
the pant It should lie made at an early
day in order that the organization shall bo
perfected and confidence restored by tlio
lime the approaching campaign is upon us
This, however, should he llio work of a
national convention embraciug delegate*
from all the Suites. I am in favor of call
ing such convention, at some central point
in the West, on a day not later than the
22ud of Kebuary next. The call should
b" issued by the national cxccutivc com
mittee. and delegates should be appointed
by Suite and district conventions The
business of this body should be to carefully
and patiently weigh all views laid Horn
it, and to agree upon and publish a clear,
definite declaration,of principles upon all
matters affecting the political welfare of
the people and the safely of our free insti
tutions. This being douo, it should ad
journ to the day fixed for the nomination
of a candidate for the presidency. In the
meantime, the people of the States can dis
cuss, approve or disapprove of what has
been done.
??It would be the duty of all democrats
taking part in polities to submit to the
voices of the majority If they are such
as prefer their own convictions, even to the
platform of the national convention, they
can step aside without embarrassing any
body elso. Let, us however, have politi
cal as well as personal harmony, and suc
cess is within our reach If the entire
democratic vote can be consolidated, in
spired with enthusiasm, and brought to the
polls, General Graut cannot be rc-clcctcd. |
" Ii was the voters of party that stayed at
home on the day of the late elections which
wrought such wide-spread defeat Thero
is no increase of the republican vote. I
make the above suggestion, knowing that
it is entirely practicable, and that it meets
an urgent demand of the present crisis.
I shall repectfnlly urge it upon the atten
tion of the national executive committee,
and ask for it the favorable consido ration j
of conservative men everywhere."
The Chicago Tribune, the great lladioal
organ of the Northwest, says, editorial-,
ly: ,
"Thero is no hope of the country under
the administration of Grant. It is tho
most corrupt, the most sordid, tho most
stupid, the most hopelessly joined to its
idols, the nation ever saw The people
demand a change and they will have it.
If tho Republicans cannot give it to them, |
the Democrats must."
In discussing the financial affairs of
South Carolina, the Natinn gives the ease ,
of the State Treasurer, Nilcs G. Parker,
who, it says, kept a bar in Haverhill,
Mass., before tho war. He entered the
army; settled as a carpet-bagger in Char
leston; opened another grocery; "went in
to politics;" was made an alderman; culti
vated tk? negro; failed in business; paid
thirty cents on the dollar; rose rapidly in
politics, became State Treasurer, and is
now reputed to be worth a million and has
plenty of diamonds. Put behind such ,
men the most corrupt and ignorant Legis
lature that ever caricatured freo govern
ment in civilized State, and see why tho
financial coudition. of tho State is suspected.
