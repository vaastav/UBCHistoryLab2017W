French and English nobility, purchas
ed a 4,000 acre ranch near Medora, a
village in the western part of the

i To this farm the countess is bring

doughboy of German descent, who
before being called to the colors was
employed on a farm near here,

member of the Napoleon Grey Capes,
adniiiiistered first aid to the uncon

him later in the hospital and upon
learning that his name was the same

COMMISSION FOR
LOCATING EXPO
TO MEET TODAY
UNDER ; ACT OF THB LEGISLA
TURE NOTV BELIEVED THAT A
SITE WILL BE AWARDED, UN
LSS PEN SACOLA AGREES -TO
BUILD AT ITS OWN EXPENSE
Following a visit to St. Augustine
and a conference with Hon. W. A. Mc
Williams, member of the Centennial
Exposition Commission the committee
from the city council and the Busi
ness Mens Association decided that
there is little use to go to Jackson
ville today to attend the meeting of
the commission, as it is hardly proba
ble .that, an exposition site . will be
named by the commission! !,
The act which the legislature Hass
led provided, for Ae selection of a site
but did not provide funds, as had
been believed, for defraying portion
of the cost cf sucK an exposition.
Without an, appiopriatiom fjrora 'the
state it la realized that'" the federal
government, would not make; an
iisepiiatioB - WiUtott- statoMind gf
eminent aid such an exposition as is
planned cou'd not be held.
The act also provides that the ex
position should be open by November
1920, six months before the legisla
ture meets. This would preclude tha
possibility of an appropriation being
irade by the state. It. would also be
impossible to construct a suitable ex
position in time for opening in No-
ember of next year.
Mr. McWilliams told the committee,
very frankly, that he did not believe
that one third of the members of the
legislature would vote for an appro
priation of any size for the exposi
tion.' Following the disclosures at St.
Augustine Palatka did not send a com
mittee to Jacksonville to attend to
days hearing.

Lime lis practically Unobtainable
in Belgium to-day and in many of the
mined villages, the refugees are lay

temporary shelter against the coming
winter. Others fill the chinks in

.lltogether it is becoming as much of
a comfort to the refugees as it was a
handicap to the soldiers who lived in

At Dixmude there is a little, low,

SUGAR GROWING IN FLORIDA.
One Concern Takes Option on 90,000
Acres For Raising Cane.
JACKSONVILLE, Dec. 13 Inter
est in Florida as the future sugar
bowl of the United States has al
ready become more evident since tho
publication of the resolution of the
Southern Commercial Congress, in
Savannah, endorsing this state for
federal aid to develop its sugar lands.
Yesterday a wealthy Easterner walk
ed into the office of Secretary J. L.
Wallace, of the Jacksonville real es
tate board, throuak whose efforts the
action at Savannahwas taken with the
story in his pocket. The Easterner,
associated with two other men from
that unction, had iust taken an option
on 90,000 acres of Florida sugar lands,
which they will at once pass upon as
to its fitness for sugar production,
If it is found suitable for that pur
pose they will proceed to develop it.
If it does not prove suitable to sugar,
they will secure other lands which
will serve that purpose.

SKELETON NEAR
WHITE SPRINGS.
Hunters Find Bleached Bones In An
Isolated Swamp.
VALDOSTA, Ga., Dec. 13 Hunters
near the Suwannee river, about two
miles from White Springs, Fla, were
very much surprised yesterday when
they tan upon the skeleton of a man
in a thick dump it scrub palmetto.
The find was made an whot is known
ss the Cone land.
. By the side of the bleached, but un
disturbed bones of a man, lay the re
mains of a gun . The wooden stock
had long since returned to dust, and
only the barrel remained, showing it
ts4ij,. been an old-fashioned, double
barreled" 16 -bore gun, of the muzzle
loading variety, now almost entirely
cut of date. The man's shoes were
in adecayed state where his feet had
fallen into decay.
Finding this skeleton recalled to old
residents of White Springs that per
haps fifteen years ago two men nam
ed Herndon and Hutchinson became
lost about the same time, and nothing
has ever been heard of either one of
them since. This led to the belief
that the skeleton might have been one
of these missing men. At the time
of their disappearance it was thought
that perhaps they had been murdered
cr drowned in the river.

MINIMUM LOAD TOO HIGH.
Trammell Asks Rescinding of Order
For Loading Citrus Fruit.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (Special)
Senator Park Trammell, having
been advised by protesting Florida
citrus growers and shippers that an
order has been made requiring that
refrigerator and ventilated cars
should contain a minimum of 432
boxes of citrus fruit to the car, has
entered upon active steps in an effort
to obtain a modification of the order.
He has taken up the matter person
ally with the railroad administration
in Washington and today sent a tele
gram to the regional directors of botli
the railroad and fuel administration
at Atlanta, Gn., as follows:
"I am infermed that you have
caused the railroads to issue an or
der requiring that no car of citrus
fruit be accepted unless it. contains
a minimum of 432 boxes. Formerly
300 boxes was the 'minimum, and then
it was raised to 360 boxes during the
congestion last year. I submit that
a minimum of 432 boxes to the car
works a srreat hardship and injustice
upon the growers of Florida and I
suggest and earnestly request tnat u
such order ex'sts it should immediate- .
:y be modified and the minimum re
quirements reduced."
