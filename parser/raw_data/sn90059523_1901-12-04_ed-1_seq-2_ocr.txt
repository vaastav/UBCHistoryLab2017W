has f almost ? become ; a ".. congrmed % custom :
of that body, rejected -all 'either bids re- 7

the day? considering - them* in * executive
session." ' '"A* '•■■*;-* ~"" ° " „
There were five bids, the lowest being
that of :C. J. j Swanson, of Minneapolis,
whose -figures^ 7 were $205,198.A: The other -.
bids' were; as follows: : v? Butler-Ryan com
.pany, St. ; Paul, $241,119; E. V. Johnson,

The only reason given for the rejection
of 'the bids was that ? they were.-, higher:
than the' bbatfl thought -should be.
No estimate -of^Jhe- cost of this work?
had - been '"prepared-" in § advance r by g the
! architect, but- it is. said that? the figures
j mentioned in the bids were so high as ;to ?
surprise' some of the? members. A3 - soon
as the -bids-had ?- been opensd and read,
Commissioner -Corliss | moved ■? to A reject
- them all. but the motion was. Lost 1 at that j
time, and :? the board ?;-then went ■ into
executive - session. As -there was :\ no
other business which would any
greatl amount |of time, it Js A plain that ;
there must have ? been a long, discussion
before the commission; could arrive at a
determination in-.this I matter.
: The work contemplated in -the - bids
' opened yesterday embraces the fireproof
ing work of air kinds to be done in" 1 the
"interior of 'the building, filling -between

of an ornamental character.A A? ? A
Just what j course the commission. will
now take as to this Work is mot known,"
"as it has I been' determined that, £ for ■ the

paid over to the state.'.The result:of Mr.
Eckman's-work was submitted r yesterday
to Public Examiner Pope, -- who stated
that a partial report : would be made, to
the governor! and • the state legal depart
ment. Gen. Pope declined to go into de
rails as to the contents of this report," but
said that it would show that Conroy.was
short nearly 1 $£000,"..Instead/ of $650, as
was at first reported. Mr. Eckman, it

LEGAL REMEDIES AMPLE
SENATOR- SOMERVILLE THINKS
CONSOLIDATION PROBLEM EASY.?
Senator' George - -'■ W. - -Somerville, a, of
Sleepy Eye, was at the capitol yesterday.
He has given much thought to the rail
way consolidation [question".? and believes'
that legal remedies are. ample. _ -He says:.
The law 'under which the Northern Se
curities company? charter? was issued?is
unconstitutional, 'in ? that it' confers spe
cial privileges. Alt;permits r the corpora
tion to buy stock in- various railroad
companies, and carrying that out, it might
under its charter j buy? up the stock of all
the railroad' companies "in the country,
shutting out;all,others; from ownership, in
railroads. This would certainly be a spe
cial : privilege. *-y, r ***-'- r? ■" L ' '-?.:' ?r A-
If the Northern Securities company un
dertakes to exercise " "any?.' control over
Minnesota,, railroads or. to .vote at : their
stockholders' meeting, it must come in
under the laws of -Minnesota. That could
be prevented, however, by a special act
of the legislature. AAA AA? y
' Our railroad companies receive;. certain
benefits from the : state. '" In return \ they
are obliged to render certain services.'
This consolidation.; puts them "in a posi
tion where they % may,', be prevented from
rendering. such services, and that is suffi
cient ground to'proceed for the forfei
ture of - the ; charters of ? the v railroads.
They may.also be.reached in the federal
courts through- the ; Sherman act. '■": : # ;

not be opened to r general? legislation at

The fact that moneys had been paw
out of the ! fund since he had given JBttt;

-. out; of : the difficulty was for Mr. Griggs
to "tell the court that if such a thing had
