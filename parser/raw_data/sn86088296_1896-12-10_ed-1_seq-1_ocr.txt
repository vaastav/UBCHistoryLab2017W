Washington, Dec. 7. The present's
message complete, as read before both
branches of congress today, is as follows:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representatives of the people in the
legislative branch of this government,
you' have assembled at a time when the
strength and excellence of our free insti
tutions and the fitness of our citizens to
enjoy popular rule have again been made
manifest. A political contest involving
momentous consequences, fraught with
leverisn apprehension and creating ag
gressiveness so intense as to approach
bitterness and passion, has been waged
throughout the land .and determined by
the decree, of l.-ee and Independent' suf
frage without disturbance of our tranquil
ity or the least sign of weakness in our
national structure.
When we consider these incidents and
contemplate the peaceable obedience and
manly submission which have succeed'
v cd a clash of political opinions we dis
cover abundance of determination of the
countrymen to abide by every verdict of
popular will and to be controlled at all
times by an abiding faith in the agon
cies established at the direction of the
affairs of the government; thus the peo
ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which
entitles them to demand of those who
undertake to make and execute their
laws such faithful and unselfish service
in their behalf as can only be nromnted
by a serious appreciation of the trust
and confidence which the accomplishment
of public duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional require
ment, I herein submit to the congress cer
tain information concerning national af
fairs with trie suggestions of such legis
lation as in my judgment is necessary
and expedient. To secure briefness
and avoid tiresome narration, I shall omit
many details concerning matters within

means unimportant, are more profitably

also further curtail this communication
by omitting a minute recital of many
minor incidents connected with our for
eign relations which heretofore found a
place in executive messages but are now
contained in the report of the secretary of
state, which . is herewith submitted.
THE TURKISH OUTRAGES.
' At the j outset of a reference to the
more important matters auecting our re
lations with foreign powers it would af
ford me satisfaction if I could assure
the congress that the disturbed condition
in Asiatic Turkey had during the past
year assume a less hideous and bloody
aspect, and that in answer to the

Several naval forces are stationed i
the Mediterranean as a measure of oau

our minister, prior to Buch outrages .and
in anticipation of danger demanded pro

strong evidence exists of actual
complicity of Turkish soldiers
in
the work of destruction and rob
bery, the facts as they now appear
do not permit us to doubt the justice of
tueir ciaim, ana nothing wilt be omitted
to bring about their prompt settlement.
A number of Armenian refuses hava nr-
rived at our ports and an order has lately
been obtained from the Turkish govern
ment permitting the wives and children
of such refugees to join them here. It
is noped that hereafter no obstacle will
be interposed tq prevent the escape of
all those who seek to avoid the perils
wnion threaten in Turkish dominions.
Our recently appointed consul to Er-
zroum is at his post and discharging the
duties of his office, though for some un
accountable reason his formal exequator
from the sultan has not been issued. I
do not believe that the present situation
in Turkey will be long permitted to of
fend the sight of Christendom. It so

THE CUBAN QUESTION
The insurrection iu Cuba still continues
with all its perplexity. It is difficult
to perceive how any progress has tuns far
been made toward the pacification of the
island or that the situation of affairs as
depicted in my last annual message has
in the least improved. If Spain still holds
Havana and the seaports and all the con
siderable towns, the insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of the
island country. As the determination of
Spain to put down the insurrection seems
but to strengthen with the lapse of time
as is evidenced by her devotion and large
ly increased military and naval forces
there is much reason to believe that the
insurgents have gained in point of num
bers and character, and resources, and
were never less inflexible in their re
solve not to succumb without practically
securing the great objects for which they
took up anna. If Spain has not yet re
established her authority. neither have
the insurgents yet made good their title
to be regarded as an independent state.
Indeed, as the contest has gone on. the
pretence that civil government exists on
the island, except so far as Spain is oble

government more or less imperfect in
large cities and immediate suburbs, but
that exception being made, the entire
country is cither given over to anorchy
or is subject to the military occupation
of one or the other party. It is reported
indeed on reliable authority that at the
demand of the commander-in-chief of the
insurgent army - the Cuban government
has now given up all attempt to exercise
its iuncuons, leaving mui government, con

Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted
civil Hirue, tne passions ot tne com
batants grow more and more inflamed
nud on both sides become more frequent
nnd deplorable.
They are also participated iu by the bauds
of marauders who, now in the name of
one purty and now in the name of the
other, as may best suit the occasion, har-
raBS tne country at will and plunder its
wretched inhabitants for their own ad
vantage. Such a condition of things
would inevitably entail immense destruc
tion of property, even if it were the policy
of both parties to prevent it as fur as
practicable, but while such seemed to be
the original policy of the Spanish govern
ment, it has now apparently abandoned
it and is acting upon the same theory as
the insurgents, namely, that the exieen-
eies of the contest require the wholesale
annihilation of property, that it may not
prove of use nnd advantage to the ene
my. ,
It is to the same end that in pursuance
of general orders Spanish garrisons are
now being withdrawn from plantations
and the rural population is required to
concentrate itself in the towns. The
sure result would seem to be that the value
of the plantations is fast diminishing and
that unless there is a soeedv and radical
change in oxhistiug conditions it will
soon disappear altogether. That value
consists, very largely, of course, in its
capacity to produce sugar, a capacity al
ready much reduced b.v the interrun-
tion to tillage which has takeu place dur
ing the last two years. It is reliably
asserted that should these interruptions
outinue during the current year and
practically extend, as it is now threat
ened, to the etire sugar producing ter
ritory ot the island, so much time and
so much money will be required to restore
the land to its normal productiveness that
it is extremely doubtful if capitnl can be
induced to even make the attempt. The
spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining
country, by nature one of the most fer
tile and charming on the globe, would
engage the serious atteution of the
government and the people of the Unit
ed States under any circumstances. In
point of fact, they have a concern with
it which is by no means of a wholly sen
timental or philanthropic character. It
lies so near to us as to be hardly separ
ated from our territory. Our actual
pecuniary interest in -Mus-second- oaiy- to
thnt of the people and government of
Spain. It is reasonably estimated that
nt least $30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of
American capital are invested in planta
tions and in railroad, mining and other
business enterprises on the island. The
volume of trade between the United
States and Cuba, which in 1880 amount
ed to alwut $04,000,000, grew iu 1893 to
about $103,000,000, and in 1804, the year
before the present insurrection broke out.
amounted to nearly $90,000,000. Be
sides this large pecuniary stake m the
fortunes of Cuba the United States
finds itself inextricably involved in the
present contest in otner ways, both vex
ntious and costly.
Many Cubans reside in this country
and indirectly promote the insurrection
through the press and by public meet
ings; by the purchase and shipment of
arms; by the raising of large funds, and
by other means which the spirit of our
institutions and the tenor of our laws do
not permit to lie made the subject of
criminal prosecution. Some of them,
though Cubans nt heart, and in all their
feelings and interests, linve taken out
papers as naturalized citizens of the
United States, a proceeding resorted to
with a view to possible protection by
this government nnd not unnaturally re
garded with much indignation by the
country ot their origin. I no insurgents
nre undoubtedly encouraged nnd sminnrt-
ed by the widespread sympathy of the
people ot the country who ulways instant
ly reel for every struggle for better and
freer government, and which in the ense
of the more restlesff elements of our ponu-
lntiou leads them in many instances to
active aud personal participation in the
contest. The result .is that this gov
ernment is constantly called upon to
protect American citizens, to claim dam
ges for injuries to person nnd property
now estimated at many millions of dol
lars, and to ask explanations nnd apolo
gies for the acts of Spanish officials whose
zeal for the repression .of rebellious
sentiments blinds them to the
immunities belonging to the non-
fTcnding citizens of a friendly pow-
It follows lrom the same causes thnt
the United States is compelled to actively
police a long line of sea coast against un
lawful expeditious, the escape of which
the utmost vigilunce will not nlways suf
fice to prevent. These inevitable entan
glements of the United States with the
rebellion Iv. Cuba, the large American
property interests affected, and considera
tions of philanthropy and humanity in
general have led to a vehement demand
in various quarters for some sort
f positive intervention on the part of
the United Stntes.
NO BELLIGERENT RIGHTS.
It was first proposed that belligerent
ghts should be accorded to the insur
gents, a proposition no longer urged be
cause untimely and in practical operation
lcoriy perilous and injurious to our own
nterests. It has since been and now
sometimes contended that the indepen
dence of the insurgents should bo recog-
zed, hut imperfect and restricted ns
the Spanish government of the island may
be, no other exists there unless the will
f the military officer in temporary com-
and of a particular district can be dig-
ified as a species of government. It is
now also suggested- that the United Stntes
buy the island, a suggestion possibly
orthy of consideration if there were any
ideiice of a desire or willingness on
the part of Spain to entertain such a pro
posal. It is urged, finally that if the
ther remedies fail, the existing
internecine strife m Cuba should
be . terminated hy our interven
tion, even- at the cost of war be
tween the United Stater and Spain, n
ar which its advocates eonhdently
prophesy could neither be large in its pro
portions nor doubtful in its issue. 1'he

all dreams of conquest, and prevent any
casting of covetous eyes upon neighbor
ing regions, however attractive. That our
conduct towards Spain and her domin
ions has constituted no execution to this
national disposition is made manifest by
the course of our government, not only
thus far during the present insurrection,
but during the ten years that followed
the rising at Yarra in 1808.
No other great power, it may be safe
ly said, under circumstances of similar
perplexity, would have manifested the
same restraint and the same patient en
durance. It mny also be said that this
persistent attitude of the United States
toward Spain in connection with Cuba
will unquestionably evidence nn silent- po.

yet neither the government nor the people

nave failed to realize the existence of
conceded grievances which have lcl in

disposition of the Spanish government to
remedy these grievances, fortified bv in
dications of influential nublic opinion in
Spain, that this government has hoped
to discover the most promising nnd ef
fective means of compromising the pres
ent stritc wnn nonor and advantage to
Spain and with the achievement of all
the reasonable objects of the insurrec
tion.
HOME RULE ADVISED.
It would seem that if Spain would of
fer to Cuba genuine autonomy, assure
home rule which, while preserving the sov
ereignty of Spnin, would satisfy, all ra
tional requirements of her Spanish sub
jects there should be no just reaAon why
the. pacification of the island might not
be effected on that basis. Such a result
would appear to be iu the trne interest
oi all concerned. It would at once stop
the conflict which is now consuming the
resources of the island and mnkine it
woTthh-HS, for which ever nurty mav
ultimately prevail. It would keep intact
ine nosessions ot Mpnin without touching
her honor, which will be .onsulted, rath
er than impunged, by the adequate re
dress of admitted grievances. It would
put the prosperity of the island nnd thp
fortunes of its inhabitants within their
own control without severing the natural
and ancient ties which bind them to the
mother country, and would vet enable
tiiein to test tneir capacity ror self gov
ernment under the most favorable cir
cumstances. It has been objected to
on the one side that Spain should not
promise autonomy until her insurgent
subjects lay down their arms; and on the
other side, that promised autonomy, how
ever lilieral, is insufficient because with
out assurance of the promise being ful
filled. The reasonableness of a require
inent by Spain of unconditional surren
der on the part of-, insurgent bands be
fore autonomy is conceded is not alto
gether apparent. . It ignores importunt
features of the situation, the stability of
two years duration ns given to the insur
rection, the feasibility of its indefinite
prolongation in the nature of things, and
as shown by past experience the utter
ruin of the island unless the present
strife is speedily ended: above all. the
rniiK abuses which all parties in Spain,
all brunches of the government nnd all
her leading public men concede to exist
and profess n desire to remove. Facing
such circumstances, to wiiiiiiuiii Hie prof
fer of needed reforms until the parties
demanding them put themselves at mer
cy by throwing down their arms has the
appearance of reflecting the gravest of
perils and invites suspicion as to the
sincerity of any professed willingness to
grant reforms. 1 he objection on behalf
ot the insurgents that promised reforms
un not be relied jipon must of course lie
onsidered. 'J hough we have no right
to assume and no reason for assuming
Hint anything Spain undertakes for the
relief of Cuba will not be done acording
to both the spirit and the letter of the
unilcrtaking, nevertheless, realizing thnt
suspicion and precaution on the part of
the weaker of the two combatants nre al
ways natural and not always unjustiti
able, being sincerely desirous in the in
terests of both, and on its own account
that the Cuban problem should be solv
ed with the bust possibly delay, it was
intimated by this government to the gov
ernment of cspuiu some months ago thnt
if a satisfactory measure of home rule
were tendered the Cuban insurgents and
ould be accepted by them upon a guar
antee of its execution, the United States
would endeavor to find a way not objec
tionable to Spain of furnishing such guar
antee. While no definite response to
this intimation has yet been received
from the Spanish government, it is believ
ed to bo not altogether unwelcome, while
ns already suggested, no reason is iierceiv-
1 why it should not tie approved by the
nsurgents. Neither party can fail to see
the importance of early action and both
must realize that to prolong the present
nfe of things for even a short period
ill add enormously to the time and la
bor and expenditure of money necessary
to bring, a bout the Industrial recuperation
f the island. It is therefore fervently
hoped on nil grounds thnt earnest ef-
or for healing the breach between flpain
nd the insurgent Cubans upon' the lines
hove indicated may be at once inaugur
ted and pushed to an immediate -and
successful issue. The friendly offices of
the United States, either in the manner
hove outlined or in any other way con
sistent with our constitution and laws
ill always lie at the disposal of cither
irty.
SHOULD NOT ANNEX CUBA.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our
policy and our interests would constrain
us to object to the acquisition of the isl
nnd or an interference with its control
by any other power.
It should be added that it can not be
reasonably assumed that the hitherto ex-

blessings of peace.
THE VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference be
tween Great Britain and the . United
States; their respective governments hav
ing agreed upon the substantial provis
ions of a treaty between Great Britain
and Venezuela, submitting the whole
controversy to arbitration. The provis
ions of the treaty are eminently just and
fair and the assent of Venezuela
thereto may confidently be expected. Ne
gotiations for a treaty of general arbitra
tion for all differences between Great
Britnin and the United Stntes are far
advanced and promise to reach a succes
full consummation at an early date.
CONSULAR EXAMINATION.
The scheme of examining applicants
for certain consular positions to test
their competency and fitness adopt
ed under nn executive order issued on
the 20th of September, 1805, has fully
demonstrated the usefullness of this in
novation. In connection with this plan
or examination, promotions and trans
fer of deserving incumbents have been
quite extensively made with excellent re-
suits.
During the past year thirty-five ap
pointments have been made In the con
sular service, twenty-seven of which
were made to fill vacancies caused by
death or resignation or to supply newly
created posts to succeed incumbents re
moved fo cause, two for the purpose of
displacing alien consulate officials by
American citizens, nnd four merely chang
ing the oititial title of incumbent from
commercial agent to consul. Twelve of
these appointments were transfers or
promotions from other points under the
department of state, four of those ap
pointed had rendered previous service
under the department, eight were made
ot persons who passed a satisfactory ex
animation. Seven were appointed to
places not included in order of Sent. 20th.
inim, nna lour appointments as above
stated involved no change of incumbency.
J. ho inspection of consular officers pro
vided tor by an appropriation for that
purpose nt the last session of the con
gress hns been productive of such whole
some effects tliut I hope this important
work in the future will be continued. I
know of nothing that can be done with
the light expense so improving to the
service. I desire to repeat the reepm-
mendution contained in my last annual
message or providing at public expense
official residences for our ambassadors at
foreign capitals. ..
The reasons supporting this recommen
dation are strongly stated in the report
of the secretary of state, and the subject
seems of such importance that I hope
it may receive the early attention of the
congress.
PRESERVATION OF SEAL LIFE.
We have during the last year labored
faithfully and against unfavorable con
ditions to secure better preservation of
snl life in the Behring sea. Both the
United states and Great Britain nave
lately dispatched commissioners to these
