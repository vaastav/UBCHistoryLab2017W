TVlint Will Wall Street Say 7
iKRthor amazing In it way is the' con
sensus of opinion anng Republican Con
gressmen that nothing whatever can be
Uwe at the present session to promote
the views of President MeKinlcy ami
Mr. Gape in the Hiie of defctruying tbc
pea;, nHineysnd turning over themon jy
isfiH; function of the Amorfcan Gov
enttticnt t the naltumil banks.
I itself, tine sheds a very bright, not
to jy lurid, side light upon tlic weakness
f the Presidential rnvMosc The prin
viiial ouHieutiun of Air. McKinley in ad
dressing the Congress on the lirescnt oc
ctfsion "was that the greenbacks must be
impoar.ued, or, otherwise, the Treasury
would beconf ranted wiUt t he awf ulaltsrna

Titat i he Executive recommendation was
balf-heartcd and timorous the text of
the n-es?age if proof absolute; that "the
legislators to whom it was addressed
believe that the country contemn and ab

MeKinley and Cuba.
Ttie President ilevAii a ret deal o
SfMce in his message to a dc-fion of the
Cuban prvlik-m, and not hipially to his
honT ar credit. Ich of what he )ias to
m? on the suhject nU;ht have been antici
pated, but in several respects his presenta
ti will create a sensation of pain in tte
heert of nil American citizen. Jjecause of
tlte scinHiiR evidence presented to 11s in
tltf! text, that Air. McKinley Oeh'oerately
is trying to beg the qtiet1oii, to ignore
Metorioat? tr.clb, and induce Congress
ooWectiveiy to believe talrtneiKs winch, in
tolr individual capacity, all Senators and
Members know u bedi4iitM;iuus,iiii)Iead
Jg, and subversive of the facts of ti e situa
tion as it exists today. In referring to the
tnroe and treaty of Zanjon, which ternii
itated t4e Ten Yeara War, Mr. McKinley is
carefirt not to mention the fact teat, wnile
itelMiig oonld have been fairer than the
&pHlfe reforms and self government fSr
Cuba Uii promhed. nothing In history
Uo been more dastardly than the Spanish
vialatten uf that treaty, it is of a pie:c
w&b Spanisii policy and bad faith during-iU
Ahnr.. Tlie revolutionists in 1878, were
poMHtoed a government and privileges iden
tkml with thoec accordcl to Porto Uico.
"Under the short-lived Spani.b Republic that
island had been given a remarkably Jiee
Ooverweent.. But as bPn as the Cubans
had laid down their arms- the Owtes ab
rogated the Porto Rican laws, applied the
oldsySem of despotism, and then informed
Uts Cuban that, as their country thus was
placed on the same ba&is as Porto Rico,
titer ottW not complain that the treaty of
Eaajmi had not been carried out. It was
tWs Jafmny which led to the revolution of
l9S, and the erection or the present
OaiMtn IlepulHic.
"TiJfe irewt inwrrecU.n broke out in
Febraary, 1S95. It i- not ir.y purpose at
tWs Uine to recall its remarkable increase,
er to characterize its tenacious resistance
against the enormous forces massed against
it by Spain. Tin? revolt and the efforts
to sulHhK: it carried destruction to every
quarter or tile IMand, developing wide
proportions and defying the efforts of
Spain for it suppression. The civilized
code it warfare has Imhjii fllsregardid, no
Icjs so by the Spaniards than by the Cu
ban!. Tlie American people will be
ac-tmii.slM.Hl at the statement contained n
the lati sentence above quoted. It must
have been written inadvertently, fcince
everybody knows on tlie inorft complete
and irrefutable evidence that it is not
true Wliile the Spaniards have murdered
prisoners of war, outraged and butchered
women and girl children; or uold them
openly in the market places to a beastly
soldiery, and regularly have assassinated
wounded ir.ri. their nuro and physician
when surprised in Cuban Lospitals, the
patriot defenders systematically hae re
leased Rpanlth prisoners, carefully tended
the Spanish wounded and returned them
tenderly to their lines, and have always
respected non combatant and female v'lr
tue. Tin charge made by the Pigsidenc
is of a character not to be misunderstood,
and it will not redound to bin pertonal or
official glory. And here, let it be re
marked that the message does not rerer
to the Mckeumg butchery of Goviu, the
young American correspondent, to the
frightful torture and minder of a Phila
delphia dentist in n Spanish dungeon, nor
to the imprisonment and torture of the
Competitor ciew. Mr. McKinley points
with pride lo the tardy release or Ameri
can primers generally, but does not in
dicate that hi has done or proposed any
thing in the way of indemnity, much less
punishment for the cowardly and cruel ac.s
of Spain against American citizens, in vio
lation or the dictates of civilization and
treaties.
We shall consider this branch of the
message, more in detail, hereafter. At
present it is only necessary to remark that
lir. McKinlcy does not find I bat the revo
lutiun lias attained suoh proportions and
the revolutionary government such a status
as to entitle it to recognitionof belligerency.
Either Mr. MeKinley has been kept in ig
norance or what the mass of leading n u
thotities on international law have to say
on the subejet, or he Jsdetermiucl toignore
the books, and construct a new and more
convenient code'out of his inner conscio is
ness. Equally he ignores the unquestioned
situation upon tbc island today. He gives
his own1 "view of the Sagasta scheme of
autonomy, but succeeds in glossing over
the facfc that it does not include .-elf-government,
which, however, he ays it
does. Under it there is not an Independent
act which the lucal parliament is capable
of. Every hit of nominal legislation passed
by it, is subject to veto by the Spanish
Cortes, while its proposed upper house is
to lie packed in the Spanish interest,
tbiough a majority membership appointed
by the Crown. The message praises the
alleged change from the inhuman policy
or Wcyler to one of civilized warfare nder
Blanco. This is a Utile sut prising in view
of the fact timt a mountain of testimony
comes to us every day that the murder or
pihvancr, the butchery of hospital patients
goes on unceasingly. That the President
should find it convenient to forget all
about recent Cutaiu victories, the capture
of the pott and harbor of Panes, ami the
orderly government of the Republic over
more than nine-tenths of the island, are
matters of courfe. He earnestly begs
Congress to give Spain time to reconquer
the inland, and leave the question of our
duty and honor in the premises to him
self, that the interests which hare dic
tated and still do dictate the Cuban policy
of the Administration may not be jeopar
dized in thflr Hmd or vara restate holdings.
The Treasury lleport.
The annual report of the Secretary of
the Tic-asurv is intended to show the na
tional balance sheet as it appeared at the
end of the fiscal yenr ending June 30
1897. Therefore, it Is a much more fa
vorable presentation than could have been
made if the accountb included had been
brought dr. v. n to the time of the meeting
of the Congress. We shall icvlew it only
in brief, as mof-t of Ita salient points have
been iratters of public information, and
have been discussed from time to tme
In these columns.
According to Secretary Gage's report,
the revenues of the Government, from all
sources, for the fiscal year, amounted to
$130,387 1G7.S9. and the expenditures to
S448,4',.0,G22.30. The deficit, there
fore, was $18,052,451.41. In addition to
ordinary revenues, during the year, cash in
the Treasury was increased to the extent
of $4,357,854.50, by the national bank
fund deposited under act of July 14 1890,
aud from i.-sue of 4 per cent bonds in
liquidation ol accrued interest on refunding
certificates. Securities, on account of
sinking fui-d. w ere redeemed to the amount
of $252,092.00.
The fiscal year reported upon by Mr.
Gage was the last under the Wilson tarifT
law, and the fir&t to bhow any national
reaction from the effects of the Cleveland
panic of 1693. As compared with the fis
cal year 1S90, It chowed an increase of
revenue aggregaUng $20,911,759.11. By
way of general comparison, it may be
stated that the four months during which
thcDingley bill has been in operation have
produced a public deficit of nearly $50,
000,000. On the other hand, the report
shows th&t the customs receipts for the fis
cal year ending June 30, 1S97, exceeded
thobe of the vear 189G by $10,532,374.03.
We are able to understand and agree
with Mr. Gage in his statement of past
receipts and expenditures, although, even
then, recent knowledge of his peculiar
views as to the ethics of bookkeeping
would tend to leave us In some doubt. As
to his prognoses of the budget for 1S9S
and 1899, we arc not sure that we can
be quoted as in accord with his figures
For excmple, he estimates that the receipts
from customs for 189S will be $105,000,
000.nnd.lor 1899 $200,000,000. His rea
sons for fucIl agolden prediction do not
seem to' appear on the face of the record
Customs receipts In 189G wore 51J0,
021,751.07. aud in 1897 they were $L7d,
551,12G.,'5. an increase under the Wilson
bill or $103274.98. now, in the face
if a Dingley deficit of practically ?50,
000,000 in four months, with no demon
strable prospect that the record 'or the
remaining months of the current fiscal
year will be any better, he can estimite
a tarit" revenue of $105,000,000 for 1S98,
and of $200,000,000 for 1899, is mure
than mosr people will be able to under
stand. In this connection It is worthy of
remark thf.t Mr. Walker, chairman of the
House Committee on Banking nndCurreney,
is reported as saying that tlie Dingley bill
is not a success as a revenue producer.und
that new internal revenue burdens will
have to be laid upon the backs of the
the people to make up for the great de
ficiencies it Is certain to create. Re
membering thcae things we are compelled
to think that Mr- Gage is even more on
servatlve than It was his cuFtom tg lie
when he was a banker in Chicago, in.esti-.
mating that the net revenue deficit of 1898
will only be $28,000,000, and that of 1899
only $21,G17.S85.S5.
During the year there was deposited at
the mints and assay offices, gold to the
value of $129,105,500.53, of which amount
domestic bullion figures to tlie extent of
$60,018,239.77. During the same period
tlie world's production of gold is stated iu
the rerort to have aggregated $202,950.-
000. Considering the absorption of gold
by Japan, bj Russia and other powers for
reserve purposes, it does not appear that
the free edd stock of the world lias at
all increased. Tlie Secretary refers to the
report of the director of the mint, in which
that official Teviews the decline of silver
from 1S73, Mid refers it .to the great in
crease In pioductiou. But we have not
time to stop for the discussion of works
ofTictlon or or "American humor."'
Secretary Gage's currency recommenda
tions are not any newer than they are good.
As in the case of President McKJnlsy's
mesage, they carry with themnn aroma
of frightened apology that shows how
very nervous the autumn elections of the
present year havo rendered the Admlnlsi ration-
In brief, they are as follows: Tlie
erection of an issue ancl, redemption division
or the Treasury, with it capitalization of
$125,000,000 in gold, to be used only for
redemption purposes; with the contril of
"all silver dollars "now held for redemption
of silver certificates; and all silver bullion
und dollars coined therefrom." Two hun
drcdmillion dollars of greenbacks are to be
collected and deposited in this division, to
be disbursed only in exchange for gold.
(The object of this .scheme is too obvious
to require comment. ) Then an isstw of t en
ycar refnr.din' loan bonds, and the xapid
expansion of national bank currency to fill
the vacuum caused by the destruction of
tlie people's money.
To accomplish this very intelligent trick
of the gold, bond and banking interests
Mr. Gage would allow the organization of
banks in small communities with $25,000
capital; to allow banks to issue currency
to the par value of refunding bonds de
posited with the Treasury, und to deposit
greenbacks, Treasury notes and silver cer
tificates against national bank currency
issued in exchange: and, after biich deposit
has been made to the extent of 50 percent
of capital, to allow banks to issue cur
rency to a further proportion of 25 per
cent of capital, on general assets, the
Government to guarantee the issue.
We are rnmiliar with the plan. We
have analyzed it before, and the more
we set cf It the less we like it. But,
thank, heaven, it will not work at prrtent.
Both Mi. Gage and the President are fully
aware of the fact, and, while they are
doing their best to redeem their pledges
to their proprietory control in Wall street
and London, they hardly are vacuous enough
not to read the handwriting on the wall,
which tells them that? Independent Amer
ican bimetallism will come a long time
sooner than the enactment or such legis
lation as tLe Secretary of the Treasury
would like to secure for the benefit of tha
sordid interests he represents.
In the House yesterday, Mr. Grosvenor
made a savage attack upon the merit
system in the civil service', aud demanded
iW destruction. When he subsided, Mr.
Johnson, of Indiana, another good Re
publican, arose and complained that, in
tlie previous session, Mr. Grosvenor hud.
read him a severe lecture upon the sin
of opposing anything to which the party
was committed. Mr. Johnson observed
that it there was anything to which the
Republican party was definitely com
mitted. It was the merit system. It is
happy for the advance statistician of Me
Kinley prosperity that his epidermis is
of alligator thickness and resisting power.
We congratulate and felicitate, the Hon.
Hernando do Soto .Money on his elevation
to the American Senate, in which he has,
without re-ele turn, more than seven years
to serve. He should have been there be
fore. Mr. HcKinlej deplores the idea of recog
nizing Cuban belligerency because that
would compel America to an attitude of
strict neutrality, and neutrality, iu turn,
would i'oicc us to abstain from active alli
ance with Spain against human liberty.
Sccretaiy Gage praises the work of his
Spanish police patrol in enforcing neutral
ity. All of which goes to show that this
is the most chowder-headed Administration
of hitory-
It is the present Intention of the Govern
ment to give Spain plenty of time. That
was also the idea of theKai-er in his little
difference with Haiti. The difference only
exists ir the fact that the latter consid
ered eight hours plenty of time. There ii
ground for icfiectiou in the lesson thus
presented.
The Geiuiau minister of foreign affairs is
frank. He asserts the undying love that
the entire feels for China, and adds
that such a f-mall thing as that should
not prevent his country from getting Its
'share of the sun." In this Herr 1011 Bi:
low is very muchlikeourown distinguished
Senator Tillman from South Carolina.
Spain has offered to Cuba a full measure
of autonomy. All indications are that
the offer is made in good faith. If Cuba
can enjoy the same measure of home rule
as Canada does it would be little less than
folly to reject the offer of Spain. Julius
Caesar Burrows.
And yet this man Is a Senator, and pre
sumably can read.
Promise and Fulfillment.
(From the New York Journal.)
Eighteen months ago tlie Republican na
tional convention declared that Spain had
lost central of Cuba, and that it was the
duty or our Government to exert its in
fluence actively to restore peace anl gire
indepei. dunce to the island. Yesterday the
Presidentelected on that platform, to wliich
he had personally pledged his fidelity, In
formed Congress that we ouht to give
Spain a reasonable chance to realiztfher ex

whose sui port he was committed by every
consideration of national, party and in
dividual honor.

SECeilJW REPORT
Would Retire Greenbacks and
Exalt the National Banker.
COIN- AN AMBIGUOUS WORD
Tabulated Statistics .Embodied In
the Document Hevciinu Cutter
Service lleeeives Attention -Const
and Geodetie Surwy -Sundry
Treasury Subjects Treated.
Ihe report o( Secretary of the Treasury
Lyman Gu.ge tof jthe House of Representa
tives was isubmitted yesterday- The first
part of it -Is given up to tabulated statis
tical work', the more important subject
of currency reform being reserved lor
final and exhaustive treatment. As fore
shadowed in hih New l'ork address at the
Chamber of Cdintiierce banquet, the Sec
retary presents'ela borate plans for a
radical change .'in the monetary laws of
the country. Hej begins by pointing ut
what he caHs- the menace to public ciedit
occasioied by the large volume of out
standing demand liabilities. Laying down
the undisputed proposition that tliu de
preciation of tilver, commercially, has
enormously increased the responsibility of
the government, lie acknowledges that
the logical consequences of the fact must
be boldly faced
At the end of the fiscal year there were
outstanding, the report says. S-U0.337,-570
in silver or silver certificates, end
$114,807,280 in Treasury note3. All these
dollars are cf equal dignity and value,
the Secretary thinks, because of the re
peal of tlie so-called Sherman law, the
repealing clause pledging tho government
to safeguard the parity of gold and Miver.
Conformable to UiH pledge the Gov;rn
ment makes no discrimination between
gold aw silver, or between metallic uoney
aud paper, when it comes to.collec'lng
taxes, but oil the other hand, It holds
itself ready to give the public creditor
ills option when it comes to paying out; the
holder of a promise to pay from the Qo.vrn
ment being invited to denmnd any sort of
monev he wants, In acquittance of his
claim. This undertaking, the Secretary
frankly says, requires adequate legisla
tion foi its continued execution,: espec
ially, as in addition, the department holds
itself ready, on demand, to exchange either
form of metalllo money for the other.
As trere arc $316,000,000 in outstand
ing legal tender notes redeemable iu gold
to be added tc tlie sum already enumer
ated, the total outstanding liability of the
Government, payable on demand, amounts
to more than $900,000,000. Tlie state
ment is made tiiat the traditional $100.
000,000 of gold reserve is insufficient to
meet the exigencies of the situation.
"If it be urged."' buys the Secr.-taiy,
"that tie ..tate of the Treasury Is rjlrly
satlsfuctorj now, the answer Is that a
contlnuinie of these good conditions can
not bo assured to us
As the Government at present uislsts
in supplying currency to the country by
the direct issue of its notes and by gu ir
anteeing a parity, its responsibilities &tc
corrcpondingly great."
The Secretary believe- that money Is a
greut strategist iu time of war, aud de
claies that a well-filled chest and im
pregnable credit are as important as ships,
sliore batteries, and regiments of nun.
The subject should, therefore, be con
sidered from the standpoint of national
defense.
He then proceeds to point out a .jemedy,
prefacing nfs recommendations with ; an
apology by saying that ho "considers such
relief as he suggests tentative steps In a
direction which, if properly pursued, will
lead to conditions. ultimately desirable."
Itceoumiendntlons.
A department to be known as the "Issue
and Redemption Division" of the Treasury
snould lie created. It is argued, with a fuiid
of $125,000,000 in gold at lis disposal, to
be used fbr redemption purposes. 'I lie
$20(T,000.000 of legal lender notes, known
as greenbacks, should be collected, de
posited with tills .divioion aud paid out
again onl'y in exchange for gold, which
gold should become a part of the redemp
tion fund.
Bond Issue Itecommended.
Secondly, It Is recommended that provis
ion be made for issuing 2 12 per ent gold
refunding bonds- payable principal and in
terest in gold colu. The object f this, ac
cording to departmental logic, Is to .'e'liove
"ambiguity" from our contract obliga
tions. The word "coin," it Is .inserted, is
an "ambiguous" word, though the "more
discriminatlngpublic creditor" -mderstands
U. to mean "gold coin." This, however, he
continues cheerfully, "is a conclusion of
logic rather than a statement of fact."
Then to provo that "coin" Is an am
biguous" word, and that tlie "more dis
criminating public creditor" is right in his
interpretation Of it, the Secretary declares
thac the act of 1809 solemnly pledged the
Government to pay outstanding obligations
in coin or its equivalent.
The objection that the department's plan
violates a later "solemn pledge" of the
Government tact of 1893) to continue the
use of both gold and silver js piimary
money is swept away with the remark t hat
it cannot be done and the narity main
tained. AH this leads up to the next proposition,
which is to place the issuing or an elas
tic currency in the hands of piivile cor
porations, with power to contract or ex
pand it at will.
Admitting that the canceling of the
greenbacks, etc., would coutrict the cur
rency, Mr. Gage says that "some other
form of paper money must be alloved to
fill the vacuum wliich would otherwise
be occasioned. The national bank in te
now familiar to our people is the teadlest
and most practical agent to nccoraplish
that object, and under reasonable' condi
tions it will be found responsive to the
call." r
The national banking act, he thinks,
should be amended so that the minimum
capital required would be $25,000. and
the tax n circulating notes i.ne nlf of
one per cent. The banks should be per
mitted to issue notes to the par value of
bonds deposited by them with the Gov
ernment If such bonds are the 'gold"
bonds "hereiiibefpre mentioned."
A quick waynto- get rid of the greenbacks-,
Treasuiy notes and silver certifi
cates, the Sccietary thinks, would bo to
exchange national bank notes for them
when they are presented for redemption
by banking institutions. As some of tlie
banks might not care to swap . .minod
ities of equal value, it is propi sed that
"the Sccretaiy of the Treasury fhall sub
stitute foi the greenbacks, Treasury notes
and silver certificates so-deposit.'d to se

and character aij the refunding bonds

"During tie'lpcriod or time Interven

tution of I onds the funds released thereby
shall at once be transferred by the Secie
tary of the Treasury to the Issue aud re

"After the banks have deposited such

their capital they shuU be permitted to

cent thus provided, to the extent of 25

'Extend the guaranty of payment by the

such other subtreasuries as may no desig
nated by tho ComptrolltT-of the Currency
with the appioval or the Secretary of the
Treasury. The control of such redemption
shall be under the direction of tlte omp- J
troller of the Currency and made Horn a
redemption fund of 10 per cent, in be
provide'd and maintained by the banks.
'Restrict the issue of national nank notes
to the denomination of $10 aud upward."
The Secretary feels justified in saying
that the. amendments are not of a dis
tinctly radical character. He believis the
plan w,ll give the people more credit money
for the movements of their ciops, etc., the
local bank being, in close touch with local
conditions.
The Government note he considers in
adequate to meet local conditions, .ocisting
asitdoes at a given time in fixed .unojnts.
In other words, it is not elastic.
In justification of his proposed ictlre
ment of tlie grtenbacks, the Secretary says:
"It will at once appear to many that
the proposal herein made to place "n con
ditional retirement thesum of $200, JOO.OOO
in our legal tender (greenback) i.s.ies is
a discrimination against a form of 3a per
money, which, under the influence of a
worthy sentiment, has become to ilieni a
symbol of the unity and power of the na
tion's life. A little reflection, however,
will lead to a conclusion quite to the con
trary of such an inference. The
historical fact is that it has been through
the greenback, the only unalloyed ciedit
note of the Government, that the "endless
chain" has been worked. Once disbursed,
these notes rind their way, by a purely
natural process, to the banking '.enters,
where, in case or un jmtward movement
of gold, or bectuse of any Internal move
ment of distrust, they have oeen 1 ade
a ready ngency to deplete the gold re
serve in the public Treasury. The propo
sition to retire a large portion of these
notes into an Issue and redemption di
vision, there to be held until, the public
Is willing to offer for them iu fair ex
change an equal sum in gold, Is a propo
sition to dignifv them with the honor
of actual gold equivalency, when they are
passed out, as they have hitherto been
honored with actual gold equivalency when
pushed in upon the Treasury for ucemp
tion." He dismisses the greenbacks with this
concession tc one of the co-ordinate! ranches
of the government: "There Is nothing
whatever to prevent the lawmaking power
fron. issuing at any time and in any
amount the legal-tender notes ofthe United
States to circulate as money. Snih is the
final opinion or the Supremo Court, from
which there Is no appe-il.'
1 nper money, the Secretary says, .s the
product of social evolution. Credit is the
base upon which It rests. The b-iuk .'s an
agency, the result also of pure evolutionary
movement, and "Whatever operates to
render the liank a safe, efficient and avail
able agent to the people operates to the
general piosperity.'
The report concludes as follows:

ing notes equal to 25 per cent of their

capital upon a pa-ment of 2 per cent
per annum as an insurance or safety fund
upon amounts so issued, is. as shown by
ttnT demonstration drawn from the Comp
trollers office, a proposition well within
the limits cf safety. Nevertheless, what
ever risk there Is should be assumed by
the Government, obnoxious as it may be
to the general principles of governmental
action. It is by such action that the
situation us it exists has been cvolted.
Upon the Government, therefore, rests the
duty of seeing it properly solved.
"Some years of experience along the
line suggested will prove what is an ad
equate provisional tax for the security of
note holders, and will allow Mich amend
ments as time will justify, involving as
oueof tiieir features a complete withdrawal
of the Government's guaranty from bank
note issues.''

Tlie face value of uncurrent domestic

purchased under the provisions or - no
tion 3526, Revised .Statute, for the sub
sidiary silver coinage. On the latter the
beigniorage was $42c22rj4.
The dbectoror th,cfunlnt,is.f the opin
ion that a much larger volume of frac
tional silver coin could be placed in active
circulation If the Secretary of the Tr.ae
ury were authorized to use iny Miver
bullion now in the Treasury for tne .-0111-age
of such denominations of fractional
silver coin as might be required fnm
time to time by the public in different
sections of the couutry.
It is recommended that section 3545
of the Revised Statutes of the United
States be amended so as to admit tf -arge
importations of foreign gold coin being
received at the mints and asayMffieo et
New York, and not melted, but held as
bullion.

Minor matters connected with the -Hints
are touched upon and an argument, based
on the market value, introduced against
silver as a money metal.
The present stock of gold and silver in
the United States amounts, approximately,
to: gold, ?GSG,270,542: silver, $634500,

Congress is urged to give considerati.in
to such a bill as the Department is nre
pared to suggest, providing ror the detailed
reorganization ot customs districts and the
regulation or rates of compensation to
be paid to elder officers or customs, or to
enact a brief measure giving the Secreta.-y
or the Treasury the authority, in his dis
cretion, to consolidate with contiguous dis
tricts customs districts in which the ex-pen-e
of collection shall, in any fiscal year,
exceed 25 per centum of the amointcol-
