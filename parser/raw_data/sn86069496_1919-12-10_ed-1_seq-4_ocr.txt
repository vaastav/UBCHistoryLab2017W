id, apologetic. Chairman Hays
of the Republican National Com
mittee has ordered that sound
ings of public sentiment be ta
ken in every bailiwick of his par
tisan Congressmen to determine
the extent of the reaction follow
ing the treaty's rejection. He
is showing fear that the people's
verdict may hold him and the
Senatorial reactionaries' respon
sible for 'prolonging industrial
unrest, the high cost vbf living,
burdensome taxation, the dan
ger of, international complica
tions and all the other concom
itant evils of war. There are
evidences, then, that the Sena
tors who strangled the treaty and
prevented a formal conclusion of
peace have least of all found fa
vor with the politicians of their
own party. It'is not too much
to believe that, when the signs
of popular disapproval begin to
multiply, these Senators may be
blamed by the very leaders in
cluding Will H. Hays who in
spired and encouraged them to
make ratification of the treaty a
game of politics instead of a. mo
mentous duty in behalf of their
country and the entire world. It
is already manifest that Senator
Lodge's proposal to make the;
treaty an issue in the presidential'
campaign has caused trepidation
among the "practicals" of the
r. 0. P. They do not welcome
the prospect of so plain and spe
cific a question being referred to
the people. They preier to
stake their hopes on generalities
and platitudes, They know in
advance that the voters could
easily decide which of the two
parties spoke the will and sought
the welfare of the country dur
ing the fight to adopt the treaty
and end the war.
