The eeramble for subordinate plneaa in tba House
is becoming bbotc desperate hourly. Yaw appoint

JsYil S. Brown, jr., of Tennessee, has bean reap*,

O. 'low les, ot Hiaaonri, a ho has been printing clerk
for several years, will be promoted to-morrow to
chief clerk, taking the pl ace of John Bailey, who
has held the place even aiuca the retirement of
Clinton Lloyd.

twelve \ea:s' service be gave way toa Democrat.
His entire service, covering a period of fourteen
yean, exceeded hy three yean that of any of his
predecessors, non.- of whom surpassed, if any
equalled, bim in efficiency. He retires from office
with tbe good-will, reepeel and esteem of political
fri.-mis and opponents alike. His successor was
besieged to-d.iV. alni his office was cloted tO all
comers exoepl Representatives and their friends.
One ol his taileis was Hr. l'.indall, who besought
liiiii to give a place to a friend. It was a rather
novel experience, doubtless, for the ox-8peaker,
whose nod w it for a long thne sufficient to provide

Washington, Dec. 5.?The comments of the
I)einoe,ratic Representatives on tho President's
sage uv lav ors bio M un lu voluble, according as
the men who utter them belong to one or the other
of tha factions. For it is already plain that the
majority in the House is divided into two hostile
camps?the larger being composed of the free
trailers and " tari(T n-foriii'Ts," who range them?
selves under the banner of Speaker Carlisle, and
the lesser number of men wini sympathize with Ibo
views of Messrs. Kandall, Eaton and Curtin. The
former are deeply vexed because the President did
not recommend further tariff legislation.
Colonel Morrison, who is a prominent leader of
tho Carlisle faction, said: "The financial portions
of tbe message are evasive, and stamp it a mean
spirited, partisan document. For party reasons,
the President dared not say what he believes?that
the tariff ought to be reduced?and so he shuffled,
for the sake of his party, in order to annoy us." In
thus accusing tho President of bad faith, Colonel
Morrison fairly reflects tho opinions and expresses
the sentiments of thc Southern and Western Demo?
crats generally ; for nearly all of them bilong to
the Carlisle wing of tho majority.
On the other hand, nearly all the Pennsylvania
and New-.Iersev Democrats and ethers, who agree
with them that American industries should lie pro
t. .-ti il, praise those portions of tin- -Meengo which
are most lierccly denounced by their fellow-Dem?
ocrats. Thev say, too, that had a man like Mr
Randall or "ur. Eaton been elected Sneaker, it would
have baan practicable to reform t l.e tai ill in some
in c.-sshry particulan without a general disturb?
ance of tue business interests of th>* country,
whereas it will now be impossible to do anything.
Hut the views of these men are treated with a* scant
consideration by the dominant fa- ion of the ma?
jority as if they were held and expressed by Re?
publicans.

In The Trihi vr to-day. To a Tkiium: eerie-pendent
Mr. Carlisle said : " I remember the etieunstaaoes *-r*
well. There was no ' verbatim ' report of the speech, for
no reporter was present. I saw tho account In Tlie

took an unexpected turn to-day. The work of selecting s

twelve men could not lie fouud In thc panel of eighty who,
under the ruling of Judge Willson, were competent to
serve. Tlie Jurors had formed opinions which lt would
re.pilrc strong evidence to remove, and were challenged
for cause. The challenging proceeded with great monot?
ony until the twenty-fourth Juror was reached, and he
was sworn. Winn the panel of eighty had been exhausted
only Hana were sworn. Thc defence h.ni made slr of tho
twenty peremptory challenges allowed them, ami tho
Commonwealth two of their four.
Tile defendant's counsel then stated that lt would he

rate u special veniro of 300 or 4?X) would bo BBaiai,
which would nq__fe several days. Senator Voorbees
accepted the answers given hy the eighty Jurors ex?
amined as expressive of the sentiment of the county i
and he remarked that lt was a most remarkable state of
opinion. Ho lb.night it necessary, therefore, that
a chance of venue should bi* granted.
Tho prosecution did not object, and the
motion for a change was allowed. Several counties were
proposed, bm the defence urged that a speedj trial could

Prime Minister Ferry, on Novemlicr '28, gave to the Tou
oiiiln ChadMa Committee.
That memorandum states that France had Imposed
uiMin Anani an unjust treaty, ignoring tho rights of
Chin.i; that Franco had Invaded Anum ami mani?
fested an intention to toke Bac-Ninh, the key of tbo Chi
BBjarei and that China, whllo feeling compelled to
resist aggression, appealed to tho honor of Franco so t o
act as to prevent bloodshed, lt also contains thc note of
M. Ferry to ihe Marquis Tseng, the Chinese Ambassador,
ngfBSttag that special power bo entrusted to tho mili?
tary chiefs In Tonguin to effect an understanding by which
Cliina could surrender Hac-Ntnh and 8ontay peacefully
to Admiral Courbet, and that subsequently a definitive
settlement could bo negotiated.
The Marquis Tseng, In replying to tho lnttor proiiosi
tlon, says ho regrets that Franco regards tho occ4tpatlon
of y.intay and liae-Nlnh indispensable. Ho falls to per?
ceive the necessity of lt.
The Marquis Tseng also comments upon the statement
of Prime Minister Ferry In thc Chamber of Deputies, In
.vhlch that 0?00. declared that tho French Government
dbl not bell, ve that Cliina would declare war, nor had
France any Intention of doing so; that France was de?
sirous of (Irmly establishing herself In the Bad River
Delta by gaining possession of Kout ay and liac Nlnh ;
that when that was achieved nobody would bo able to
drive her out; that with patience and her forces, she
would Le proof against everything; omi that that pru?
dent policy would load to tho settlement of tho Tonqtiln
affair. The Marquis observes that this statement pro
din cl a [i ilnful impression in Templin. If it bOO-BBS a
question ot tho possession of Touquln further m
lions would be useless, as it would bc Impossible for
China to iiicre*i thereon.
On November L*0 M. Ferry declared that tho Ideas of
the French I loveriimeiit had not changed during tho last
three years, The rreaeh polley. he eatd, waa gelded by
? he. piliniplcs which formed thc b.i-ls of the treaty of
1874. Ihe Qevetnasent desired tbe eoneoUdatton of the
French protectorate, toe free navlgattoa of the Song-Kol
Uivi-r, and security for its commercial reladona In Ton?
guin. Tbe Marquis Tseng having renewed a proposal to
III tue line of deui.ueali.il between the arml'-s 111 the
eiiiiii-uiueiii. at Hanoi, at Soutay and on the banka of the
Bed Uiver, M. I- ny pointed out that tho Kernilla Teem;
declared on August 1 ihat then were no Chinese troopsln
Tonqnln, whereupon ti. Chalieinel-Lacour. then French
-twisterol i orel.n Ail'.iirs, n-pii.nl thal there was oonso
qucuily no dancer of a conflict. If Chinese forces ap?
proached the forneesee against which tin- French were

[BT TELEURAI'U TD THK TKML'NE.'l
Nkw-II.vvkv, Dee. 5.?"That is ehiekem'i
blood," salli William Downs, of North Madison, the man
suspected of the murder of i-Lldrldgo F. Johnson, when
I '.ironer Hellman pointed out a number of blood stalin on
lils trousers and boots to-day. Nevertheless, Coroner
Hollmaii compelled Mr. Downs to surrender his spotted
clothes. Tho portions of tho trousers containing the
blond were cut out and given to ProteSSOf LU. C. White, of
Yale College, for microscopical examination. The Pro?
fessor has uot yet made his report, nor has the Coroner
oi der..d any arrests.
The th rou ir of curious visitors at tho Johnson home?
stead woe greater to-day than yesterday. Suspicion still
points toward William Downs and John Whipper us the
perpetrators of the crime. Whipper wanders about the
vicinity aa Urinal, and claims to be entirely innocent of
tho crime. Today he paid u long ami apparently sym?
pathetic visit to tho family of the murdered man.
The Mistered and hacked remains of Eldridge F. John?
son lay all day long stretched ou a bier tn one of tho front
rooms of the houae. Tho local deputy sheriffs haunted
the house and conversed mysteriously with each other,
but succeeded lu evolving little that was new. Tho
family wen-iiii-onsolu'ile in their irrlef. The begrimed
charcoal makers caine to offer their coudolcm.-,
but only officials arid reporters were allowed to
s.-c the remains. The ehareoal heap on which the body
was lin-own utter the murder, with the purpose ..f-buruiug
it b.-i'ore morning, baa beeu demolished; but the blood
?patters arc still ob the sorroundlnastonm and boshes.
Tue later Inspect inn* of the spot have shown that after
Johnson had been killed his body was first placed for
concealment under the brow of an overhanging ledjte,
about 200 feet from the pit. Deep pool* of blood are even
now visible under this rock. Then the bolly was dragged,
heait downward, beek lo the coal henp. The murderer,
with his tout, punctured the moss embank?
ment of the pit, threw In the hole John?
son's bloody hat and two huge cobble Stones
that were covered with blood and th.; murdered man's
hair. The right foot of Johu-*ou, which had been chopped
off In the fla ht, was mini.-to till tlie cavity. Wero lt uot
for the fact that tliecobblo stones choked the hole the
flic would luivc burst out. and lu accordance with tlie
murderer's Intention consumed I ho opium and all evidence
of the minder save the blood ou thejyuuad. The dis?
covery of the blood on the clothes Of William Downs ls
considered as almost convincing proof that he at least
wis concern.-.1 in the murder. But he h.w ulwuys ap?
peared such a mild-ii.unuc red in-rsoii, though a drunkard,
that bis ai (liialniuiices cammi believe that without the
assisi.imo of the moro savage ami cunning
suspected man, John Whipper, he could have accom?
plished the deed. Whippers conduct immediately after
lue murder waa eomewnat suspicious. lie hadoontra
dictorv stories to the sin riffs and appeared very nervous.
But since Ihe first day he has adhered to the limple state?
ment ihat he did not leave his hut Sunday night. Downs,
however, appears tu be in mortal terror of tho approach
of any one lo hts house, aad has not left lt all the week.
Corouer ls..lillian, with a New-Yorker, supposed to lie tbe
detective for whom -tate's Attorney Doolittle tele?
graphed last evening, vislti d this morning the uouse oc?
cupied !>y Downs and lils wife. Hot ii wen- put under
oath and examined aa to their whoieatioum last Sunday
night, mid as to their habit and the occasion of the
alleg-d chicken killin*. Alibough giving tue Idea that he
learned some Important facts, Coroner Bodman refused
to divulge their nature. The coroner amt the medical ex?
aminer have both expressed the opine u that uot more
than one of the wounds on the head was lufjicted by au
uie, but that any one of them was iicces-arily fatal. Tho
funeral of the murdered mau will take place to-morrow

LOWER COMMUTATION RATES
A CUT OF 50 FEB CENT ON THE CKNTKAL.
AN IMPORTANT CHANOK TO TAKT. FPFKIT ON JAN?
UARY 1?OOO!) IffMI ON RKAI. KST 1TB.
A radical reduction in commutation rates haa
beru decided upon by the New-York Central Kallroad
Company, affei tine Lotti the Hudson River and the Har?
li m divisions. It wll^^uto effect on January 1, 1HM4.
The reduction will amount to from 40
to .10 per cent of the preterit eoiiiraiit-r
tlon rates on thene roads. It will make such rate* on the
New-York Central system lower than those on any other
road 1 ailing out of New-Vork. The ofliiBBB ?t the com?
pany lielieve that this action will attract many persons to
tho towns along the line of the road, and Hence the
tendency will lie to enhance the valuo of real estate In
those localities.
There has been considerable criticism of the commuta?
tion rates charged by the New-York Central,
and the matter was the subject of resent in?
vestigation by tho Btate Railroad Cominis
sloueis. It ls understood tlutt Chauncey M. IX-peW
has for some time advocated a more liberal policy, aad
that largely through him the proposed reduct!..:- has been
accomplished. Assistant Oeneral Pa**enger Ascot
Richards bas been anxious to make tbe change, and since
lt was authorized he has worked hard to arning.; tbe de?
tails of tbe new system. An Important feature of tha
new system will bo tho Issuing at any time of coupon
books, good for one mouth, three months or a year. Thu
general nile among the railroads as regards commuter* la
only to issue commutation books on the first day of any
month.
Heretofore the Central road bas issued commutation
books, containing coupon* for loo trine, good for three)
mouths. The long tuna allowed on these h.siks has been
the Justification for the charge, which some persons have
declared tobe higher In comparison than the charge* on
other lines. In fad, the old syatem was more liberal on
tide account to the commuter who travelled only
occasionally than to the commuter who
went to and from New-York every day. The
managers of Ihe Central, however, have recognized that
to the latter class they must look for the building up of
thc towns along the linc nf tln-ir road, an nu.nv n .
