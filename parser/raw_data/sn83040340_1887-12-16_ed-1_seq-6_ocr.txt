KANSAS PROHIBITION. KANSAS RAILROADS. uuMint mititvifcwtu. $Q&
The Called States 8ipnm Court Sus
tain the Constltatlonalltr of the Kaa
M Prohibitory law.
Washington. Dec ft Tho Supreme
Court ot the United States yesterday gavs
a decision in the cases of Jacob Muglcr
against the State ot Kansas and tbe Stale
against Ziebold. The decision of the lower
court was affirmed in the Hugler cases and
reversed in the Ziebold case. The effect
is to declare valid the Prohibition law in
Kausas. Tho opinion was by Justice Har
lan, who said:
The general question in each case is ithethe
the Prohibition statutes of Kansas arc in con
flict with that clause of the Fourteenth amend
ment which provides that "No State shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge ihe
privileges or immunities of citizens of the Uni
ted States, nor shall any State deprive any per
son ol lite, liberty or property without due pro
cess of law."
That legislation by a Stato prohibi;icg the
manufacture within her limits of intcxicatlng
liquors, to be resold or bartered for general use
as a beverage, does not necessarily infringe
any right privilege or immunity secured by
the Constitution of the Unted States is
made clear by the decisions ot this court,
rendered before und since Ihe adoption of
the Fourteenth amendment It Is. however,
contended that although the State may pro
hibit the ma uracturo or intoxicating liquors
for sale or barter within her limits tor general
use as abeverage, no Convention nor Legislature
has the right under our form or Government
to prohibit any citizen from manufacturing for
his own use or for export or storage any arti
cle of food or drink not endangering or affect
ing tho rights of others. The argument mado
in support of the first branch of tbis proposi
tion briefly stated Is: That, in the implied
contracts between the State and tho citi
zen, certain rights are reserved by the latter
which are guaranteed by the constitutional
provisions tor the protection of life, liberty and
property against deprivation without due pro
cess ot law and with which the State can not
interfere: that among those rights is tbatol
manufacturing for one's own use of either rood
or drink: that, while according to the doctrines
of the commune, the State may control the
tastes, appetites, habits, dress, food knd drink
ot the citizen, our system or Government,
based upon tho individuality and intelligence
of the people, does not claim to control him ex
cept las to his conduct to others, leaving him the
sole judge as to all that only '-fleets hiuseir.
It will bo observed that the proposition and
tho argument made in support of it cquallj
concede that the right to manufactu.-e drink
for one's personal use is subject to the condi
tion that such manufacture does not endan
ger or affect the rights of others. If such
manufacture docs prejudicially affect the
rights and interests of tho community, it fol
lows from tho very premises stated bj coun
sel that society has the power to protect
itself by legislation against the injurious con
sequences or that business.
Uut by whom or by what authority is it to be
determined whether the manuf.-i' ture of partic
ular articles of drink, either for general uso ol
for the personal use or the maker, will injurious
ly nffect the public. Power to determine such
questions, so as to bind all, must exist some
where, clso society will be at tho mercy of the
few who, regarding only their own appe
tites or passions, may be willing tc
imperil the peace nnd security ot the
many, provided they are permitted
to do as they please. Under our system thai
power is lodged with the legislative branches
of the Government. It belongs to that depart
ment to exert what arc known tjlc police
powers of the State. It must cterniIie yrmi
arily what measures ere aprirol)riate ami need-fulforth-5
protection of !aeT public morals, the
public health or tbe pnblic safety.
As the courts must obey the Constitution
rather than the law-making department ot Gov
ernment, it must upon its responsibility, de
termine whether in any particular case these
limits have been passe '. The courts are not
bound by mere forms, nor are ttey to be misled
by mere pretenses. They arc at liberty in
deed, arc under a solemn duty to look at the
substance of things whenever they enter upon
tho inquiry whether the Legislature has trans
cended the limits or its authority. If, there
fore, a statute purporting to have been enacted
to protect the public health, the public morals
or tbe public safety, has no real or substantial
relation to those objects, or is a palpable inva
sion of rights secured by the fundamental law,
it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, und
thereby give effect to the Constitution.
Keeping in v.ew these principles, as govern
lag the relations with each other of the judicial
und legislative departments ot the Government,
it is difilcult to perceive any ground for the ju
diciary to declare that the prohibition by Kan
sas of the manufacture or sale within her limits
or intoxicating liquors' ror general use there as
a beverage is not fairly adapted to the end ol
protecting the community against the evils
which confessedly result from the excessive
use of ardent spirits. There Is here no juslia
cation for holding that tho State, under the
guise merely ot police regulations, is aiming to
deprive the citizen or his constitutional rights.
It therefore, a State deems ihe absolute pro
hibition ot the manufacture and sale within hei
limits of intoxicating liquors for other that
medical, scicntiiic and manufacturing purposes,
to be necessary to the peace and security of so
ciety, the courts can not without usurping leg
islative functions, override the will oi the pc
pleas thus expressed by their chosen repre
sentatives. It is a fundamental principle in out
institutions, indispensable to the preservation
of public liberty, that one cf tho separate de
partments of Government shall not usurp pow
ers committed by the Constitution to another
department
With reference to the assertion that the pro
hibition ot the manufacture and sate of liquot
deprives liquor dealers of their property with
out due process of law. the court lays that all
property under the American form of govern
ment is subject to the obligation that it shall be
used so as not to injuriously affect the rights ol
the community and thereby become a nuisance.
The State of Kansas had a right to prohibit the
liquor traffic. It did not thereby take aw ay the
property ot tbe brewers. It simply abated
a nuisance.
Tor the reason stated, says Justico Harlan,
we are or opinion that Mugler, tbe plaint id
In error, ha; not been denied by the judg
ment of the Supreme Court of Kansas any
right privilege or Immunity secured to him
by the Constitution of the United States, and
Its judgment in each case is accordingly af
llrmed. Wc arc also or opinion that the Cir
cuit Court of the United States erred in dis
missing the bill, the bill or tbe State in her
suit against Ziebold and Uagelin. The decree
in that rose is reversed and the cause remand
ed, with directions to enter a decree granting to
the State such relief as the act of March 7, 188),
authorizes.
Justice Field concurred in the opinion as
it related to tbe two c.iscs in which the
Stato of Kansas was defendant, but dis
sented as to the case of the Stateof Kansas
against Ziebold. He agreed, he said, to sc
much of the opinion as sustained the va
lidity of the act of Kansas prohibiting the
sale of intoxicants which were manufact
ured in the State after the passage of the
net He was not prepared, however, to say
that the prohibition of the manufacture of
such liquors, if intcndel for exportation,
could be sustained, nor that the State could
forbid the sale under regulations for the
protection of health and morals of tho peo
ple of any article which Congress inibt au
thorize to be imported. He was not ready tc
admit that Now York or nny other Coast
State could defeat an act of Congress. Nei
ther could he concur in the validity of the
l.tth section of the Prohibition act
ol Kansas because he believed it
authorized tho destruction or property
without due process of law. He could not
i-o upon what piinciple the Legislature
alter closing the biewcry could Older the
destruction or liquor which it admitted
might be valuable for medicinal or mechan
ical purposes. Nor cutld ho sec why the
protection of the morals of the Stale re
quired the destruction of bottles and oihcr
utensils after the liquor hud been emptied
from them.

Annual Keport or the Itallrnad Commla
loners Railroad Ilaltdinx 1b the 8tate.
Toi-eka, Kan., Dec UL The Kansas State
Railroad Commissioners submitted their
annual report to tbe Governor yesterday.
The following is a summary ot the report:
To Hon. John A. Martin:
Sir: We have the honor to submit to yon in
pursuance ot the requirements or the law. this,
the fifth annual report of the Board or Kailroad
Commissioners of this State.
This report embraces the statements and re
ports ot the different companies engaged in tne
operation ot lines of railroads In this State mado
to this office in pursuance to statutory require
ments and which exhibit in detail the doings in
transportation and the financial result or rail-
rord operations in Kansas ror tbe year ended
June , 1S87, and also statistical tables com
piled from tbe reports.
The board has from time to time, as oppor
tunity has been afforded, inspected the rail
roads of the State with a view to ascertain
their condition and the manner in which they
are operated. With a few minor exceptions.
they have been kept in good order and condi
tion. Most or the new roads built in the State
the past two years have been built in a very
substantial manner and with a view to their
ruture economical operation.
Up to November 1, tbSi. there had been built
during the preceding r-art or the year SfiO miles
ot new railroads within the State. During the
same period the present year there were ,Ci0
miles built. It may bo interesting to trace the
progress ot railroad building in Kansas the past
Tour j ears.
The total mileage reported to this office for
the year ended June 39, )(&!, including narrow
gauge track and exclusive ot side tracks, was
3.883 miles, including side tracks, -l.:M3.
For the j ear ended June 30, 18SI, the mileage
of m tin line in Kansas reported was 4,058 miles.
Increaso or main tracks ror the year, 153 miles.
Total mileage, including side tracks counted as
single track, 4,57-1 miles. Increase tor the year,
iib miles. It should bo noted that fractions of
u mile arc excluded in these statements.
The total mileage reported Tor tho year ended
June 3J, 1.S85, main line. 4,16-1 miles. Increase
ror the year, 13J miles. Total mileage, includ
ing side tracts, 4,j0. Increase, ltd miles.
Total mileage reported for the year ended
June 30, 18NB, 4.703 miles. Increase for tho year,
rT miles. Total mileage including side tracks,
r-,337 miles. Increase. K)7 miles.
Total mileage main line reported for the year
ended June :i), 0.5IS.99 miles. Increase ror the
car. l,Sl".1.') miles. Length of track, including
sidings computed as single track, 7,353.04 miles,
Increase for tho year, 1.0 tvn miles. m
It must be borne in mind that the mileage of
ficially reported to this office for the year ended
June 3 1 last did not embrace all the new road
actually built up to that date, but only so much
as had been finished nnd turned over to the
operating department or tho different compa
nies by whom, or Tor whom, the same was built
In railroad building the ptst two years, Kansas
has led every other State and Territory. As
suming that by the close of the present calen
dar year the total completed mileage of K.in
sas railroads will equal H.nU) miles, it will be
seen that nearly 4,000 milcj of this havi boen
built within two years.
Uesldes the vast extens'ons or railroads In
every direction within the State, a work or di
rect importance and interest to tho people or
Kansas, carried on by parent home corpora
tions, is rapidly progressing beyond our
boundaries; railway systems having their cen
ter, as it were, in Kansa3, arc extending their
arms into adjacent and even remote States and
Territories into the South to the Gulf, into
the vast regions of the Southwest, into Colora
do and beyond. The accomplishment of these
great enterprises can not but result in im
mense bcnellt to tho people of Kansas.
Notwithstanding the large increase made to
the railroad mileage of Kansas within the past
two years, tho western part ot the State is as
yet but meagcrly supplied, ir that part or the
State continues to develop and to grow in the
same ratio the next few j cars as it has in tlib
past three and that it w ill there can hardly be
a doubt a very considerable addition to the
railroad mileage will bo needed.
The past year, notwithstanding the railing off
in agricultural production, has witnessed a very
considerable gronth in railroad business and
earnings. This U due in u measure to the
immense a-nount or railroad material Tor new
construction that has been carried over the
roads of the State, upon :U of which the freight
is collected nnd charged up to the construction
account. The building of waterworks and
street car lines, which has proceeded in every
considerable town of Kansas, has also consider
ably swollen the volume of freight trade.
These, of course, can not be depended oil as
permanent source of business and railroad rev
enue. The total gross earnings or all railroads re
porting to i his office (except the Salina, Lin
coln & Western, which we have been unable tc
obtain, and which would but slightly vary tbe
tljurcs) are:

Increase 1977 over 1880 4,857.2)7.0
Of this increase in tonnage the pa t year com

are due to increased demand and consumption
of manufactures, lumber, the various classes of
building material, coal and merchandise and
other articles; and but 55J,G53 tons due to in
crease of tonnage of grain, agricultural pro
ducts, flour and meal, and animals.
In respect to tho classes of freight last
named, the tonnage car: led In 1837 fell below
that of 1-85, by an,va tons. The production,
carried by the railroads tor the year ended June

Nbw Yohk, Dec. 8. The Tribune contains
a long interview with Hon, James O.
Blaine on President Cleveland's message.
Itisaa .follows: VI katabeen reading an,
abstract of the President's message and
hare been especially interested in the com
ments of the London papers. These papers,
all assume to declare the me-isage a free
Irado manifesto and evidently are anticl
piting an enlarged market for English
fabrics in the United States as a cosse
queues ot (he President's recommenda
tions. Perhaps that fact irtateped JLbo char
acter of the message more clearly thW aay
worJs of mine can."
' "You don't mean actual free trad o with
out duty !" queried the reporter. v
"No," replied Mr. t Blaldc, "nor do' tho
London papers mean that They simply
mcan that the President has recommended
what In the United Stales is known as a
revenue tariff, rejecting tho protection
features as an object and not even permit
ting protection to result freely as an inci
dent to revenue duties."
"Idon'tknow that I quite compiehend.
that last point," said the reporter.
"I menu," said Mr. Blaine, "that for tbe
first timo in the history of the 'United
States the President recommends retaining:
the internal tax in order that the1 tariff may
be forced down even below the fair reve
nue standard. Ho recommends that tbo
tax on tobacco bo rctiined, and thus that
many millions annually shall bo levied on,
a domestic product, which would far ,bct
tercomo from a tariff on foreign fabrics."
"Then do yoa mean to imply that you.
would favor tho repeal of the tobacco
tax!" "Certainly; I mean just that," said Mr.
Blaine. "I should urgo that it be done at
once, before the Christmas holidays.
It would in the first place bring great
relief to growers of tobacco all -ovci-the
country, and would matcrially
Iessenlho price or tbe article to consum
ers. Tobacco to millions of men is a
necessity. The President calls it a luxury,
but it is a luxury in no other sense than teu
and coffee arc luxuries. It is well to re
member lhat the luxury of yesterday be
comes a necessity of ;to-day."
"Well, then, Mr. Blaine, would you ad
vise the repeal ot the whisky taxi''
"No, I would not Other considerations
than those of a financial administration nren
to bo taken into account with -regard to
whisky. There is a moral side to it L
would use tho tax to fortify our cities on
the seaboard. In view or the powerful let
ter addressed to tho Democratic party oi
the subject of fortification by the late Sam
uel J. Tildcn, in lb35, 1 tun amazed tlfat no
attention has been paid to the subject by
tho Democratic administration." .
"But," said the reporter, "you don't"
tliink wc are to have a war iu any direc
tion!" "Certainly not," said Mr.. Blaine.
"Neither, I-presume, did Mr. Tilden when'
lie wroto his remarkable letter. But we:
should change n rcmoto chance into au ab
solute impossibility if our weak and ex
posed points were strongly fortified. If to
day we had by any chance such a war as.
wo had with Mexico, our enemy could pro
cure ironclads in Europe that would men
ace our great cities with destruction or lay
them under contribution."
"But would notour fortifying now possi
bly look as if wo expected war I"
"Why should it any more tLan the f orti
cations made seventy or eightj years ago
by our grandfathers when thty guarded
themselves against successful attack: front,
the armament or that day. AVo don't neces
sarily expect a burglar because we lock our- '
doors at night, but if by any possibility a
burglar comos it contributes vastly to our
pcaceot mind and our souud sleep to feel,
that he can't gel in."
'But after tho fortifications should be.
constructed would you still maintain ther
tax on whisky?"
"Yes," said Mr. Blaine. "So long aa.
there is whisky to taxi would ttax it, and
when the National Oovernmentsiiould havo
no use for the money I would divide tbrt
tax among the Federal Union with the
specific object of lightening the tax on real,
estate. The houses and farms of thewbole
country pay too largo a proportion of tee
total taxes."
After a few moments silence Mr. Blaino
added that in his judgment the whisky tax
should be so modified as to permit all who
U3cd pure alcohol in the arts or in mechan
ical pursuits to havo it free of tax.
"Besides your general and sweeping op
position to the President's recommenda
tion have you any further specific objec
tion i"
"Yes," answered Mr. Blaine, "I should
seriously object to the repeal of the duty on,
wool. The repeal of that would work great
injustice to many interests and would se
riously discourage what wc should earn
estly encourage, namely, the sheep culture
among farmers throughout the Union. To
break down wool growing and be depend
ent on foreign countries for the blanket un
der which vvc sleep and the coat that covers
our backs is not a wise policy for the Na
tional Uovcrn meat to enforce." I
"Do you think if the President's recom
incndations wercr adopted it would incrcase
our export trade!"
"Possibly in some few articles of pecu
liar construction it might, but it would in
crease our import trade ten fold as much in
the great staple fabrics, in woolen and cot
ton goods, in iron, in steel, in all the thou
sand and one shapes in which they nroi
wrought How are we to export staple
fabrics to the markets of Europe and how
arc we to manufacture them cheaper tha
they do in Etitopa unless we get cheaper
labor than they have in Europe J''
"Then you thiuk that the question or
labor underlies the whole subject!"
"Of course it docs," replied 3Ir. Blaine
"It is, in fact, the entire question. When
ever we can force carpenters, masons, iron
workers and mechanics in every depart
ment to work as cheaply and live as poorly
iu the United States as similar workmen in
Europe, we can, of course, manufacturer
just as cheaply as they do in England and.
Fiance. But I am totally opposed to a
policy lhat would entail such results. To
attempt it is equivalent to a social andi
financial revolution, and that would bring
untold distress."
'What about the existing surplus !"
"The abstract of the message 1 have
seen," icplied Mr. Blaine, "contains no
reference to that point I therefore make
no comment further than to indorse Mr.
Fred Grant's remark that a surplus is al
ways easier to handle, than a'Celicit"
The reporter repeated' the question!
whether the President's recommendation
would not if adopted, .give us tbe advan
tage of a larger increase in exports thaor
hCi-etofore.
"I only repeat," answered 3Ir. Blaine
"that it would vastly enlarge our imports
while the only export it would seriously in
crease would be our gold and silver. That
would flow out "bounteously, just as it did
under the tariff or 1S4G. The President's!
recommendation enacted into law would,
result as did an experiment la drainage of
a man who wished to turn a swamp into a.
productive field. He dug a drain to a neigh
boring river, but it happened, unfortunate
ly, that the level of the river was higher
tt.Q tbe level of tbo swamp. The conse
quence seed not be told."
