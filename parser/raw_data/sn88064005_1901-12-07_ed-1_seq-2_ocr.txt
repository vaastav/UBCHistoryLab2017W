THEE:MOODY RESOLUTION.
Congressman Moody, of Massa
chusetts,bhas introduced a resolution
in Congress calling for an examina
tion into the abridgment of the right of j
suffrage in this State. Of course
thereZisyconsiderable speculation
to the final outcome of the matter.
Inasmuch.as it appears tobe an in
dividual rather than a party move,
we do not attach much importance to
it. Congress has its full share of
cranks and fools as Mark Hanna
says, and we opine Moody is one of
the freaks.
Be this as it may, the day is not
far distant when the peculiar suffrage
laws of Louisiana, Mississippi,South
and NorthCarolina will be subjected to
Congressional action and we believe
when that time'comes the:opinion of
Senators Caffery and McFnery will
be affirmed, that section five is un
constitutional As between the two
evils, uareduction of our present rep
resentation ainCongress or the her,
rors of universal and unretricted
negro snffrageeweifeel p 'hesitancy
in saying that the good people] of
Louisiana would"gladly 'part with
five itxths;of their Congressmen
rather than return to theoldjorderj of
thmigs.
We may as well be candid among
ourselves and admit thatjthe famous
Section 6]whichlso effectually elimi
nates the negro as Can e'ector is a
barefacedjfratid, purposely designed
to circumvent another partisan fraud
the 14th and 15th Amendments to the
United States Constitution.
If the departedispirits of Thad
Stevens andOliver P: Morton can
return abd sway the feelings of the
Republicans now;in Congress we wil
be punished for thus undoing their
efforts to, set black.heels on white
necks.
TBYING AN OLD DODGE.
The Sugar Trust evidently has
started a literary bureau and its
screeds remind us very forcibly of the
old lottery gang. The "dear peo
ple" is the favorite string; just lis
ten to this fragment of a "poem"
you sugar cane growers and see
where you come in:
I'm agoin' ter keep on hustlin', talkin',
pleadin' with my friends,
Aint no sense in lettin' others gain thar
selfish privet ends.
rm agoin' ter write termorrer to my Con
gressman 'nd say
Thet he oughter do his best ter kill that
tax without delay !
Feller-farmers, do your utmost-whether
you grow beets or not
To repeal the tax on sugar-yon can but
improve your lot !
Cheaper sugar helps your pocket, greater
blessings you can win
When we've three-cent granylated-that's
whar youn an' I uem in!

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt has sent his
first message to Congress. It is an
able paper and contains much that
we can heartily commend, especially
is this so with regard to upholding
the Monroe doctrine, restricting for
eign immigration and aid in develop
ing the and districts of the West.
When it comes to the discussion of
our relations with Cuba he takes a
stand which means the destruction of
our sugar interests. He says:
"Elsewhere I have discussed the
question of reciprocity. In the case
of Cuba, however, there are weighty
reasons of morality and of national
interest why the policy should be
held to have a peculiar application,
and I most earnestly ask your atten
tion to the wisdom, indeed, to the
vital need, of providing for a sub
stantial reduction in the tariff duties
on Cuban imports into the United
States. Cuba has in her Constitu
tion affirmed what we desired, that
she should stand, in international
matters, in closer and more friendly
relations with us than with any other
power; and we are bound by every
consideration of honor and expedi
ency to pass commercial measures to
the interest of her material well
being."

In speaking of the work in con
nection wrth the Plaquemine Locks
the Iberville South has the following
to say, which will be of interest to
the Attakapas people.
The laying of the matresses about
alf mile above town is a larger
piece of work than is generally
thought, A force of about eighty
men have been constantly employed
for nearly two months carrying on
this work and will during the early
part of the week sink the first mat.
The mat which is now almost ready
to be sunk is eight hundred feet long
and two hundred feet wide. Five
large barges of rocks arrived Tues
day. The mat is made of willows of
about two inches in diameter which
are packed and bound in bundles of
about twenty, and which bundles are
subsequently firmly fastened together
by an interlacing cable. The rocks
are distributed as equally as possible
upon the thus composed mat just be
fore it is sunk.

evidently made of the right stuff.
He knows the proper amount of
respect that is due his official posi

Last year Steve L'Hommedieu, a big
race horse tout and a son of Belial,
pulled his gun on the Pinkerton's in
New Orleans and was arrested for
disturbing the peace. He was pa

return this season Judge Hughes had
him arrested and puc in jail, keeping
himithere all night in spite of a flood
of entreaties to parole him.

It is an old saying, "You can't
keep a good man down," and we see
it well exemplified in the case of our
friend H. P. Lane of that splendid
paper, the Ruston Leader. A short
time ago he undertook to publish a
live daily in that slow town. It was
a paper that would do credit to, a
place twice the size of Ruston, but
he got no advertising patronage.
Realizing that he was publishing a
nonpareil paper m a great primer
town, he quit-but not for long. He
has come back with a . little three

full of life and news, and still a lit

The reader of this paper will be pleased
to learn that there is at least one dreaded
disease that science has been able to cure
in all its stages, and that is Catarrh.
Hall's Catarrh t'ure is the only positive
cure known to the medical fraternity.
Catarrh being d constitutional disease,
requires a constitutional treatment. Halls
Catarrh Cure is taken internally, acting
directly on the blood and mucous surfa
ces of the system, thereby destroyilg the
foundation of the disease, and giving the
patibnt strength by building up the con
stu tion and assisting nature in doing its
work. The proprietors have so much
faith in its curative powers, that they
offer One Hundred Dollars for any ease
that it fails to cure. Send for list, of tes
