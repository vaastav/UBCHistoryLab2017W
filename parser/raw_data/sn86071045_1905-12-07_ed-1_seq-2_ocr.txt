Meeting of Congress
The preliminaries of the meeting of
what promises to be an interesting ses
sion of Congress were remarkably
quiet. The Republicans met in caucns t
last Saturday, and continued Joseph G.
Cannon of Illinois as speaker, and the
Democrats met and continued John
Sharp Williams of Mississippi as their
"floor-leader"; and Speaker Cannon
made but few changes in the Com"
mittes, selecting Mr. Tawnev of
Minnesota to succeed Mr. Hemenway
as chairman of the Committee on Ap
propriations. A part of Mr. Cannon 8
address to the caucus was as follows:
"It wonld be a bold man or party that
would do anything by legislation or
threat thereof that would tend to de
stroy or check the progress of our
people and their universal and success
ful achievements in all branches of in
dustry in the country.
"The changes in the methods of pro
duction and commerce, so salutary and
beneficial, involving as they do the ex
traordinary nse of combined capital,
emphasize the necessity for preventing
agreements in restraint of trade, and
the regulation of commerce among the
States and with foreign nations.
"The consensus of opinion of the
people is that Congress has the power
by amendment to the law to" provide
better remedies for real abuses exist
ing, so that the producers and consum
ers can find a more speedy and less ex
pensive remedy than we now have. In
this opinion I for one concur. The
burden is upon Congress, and our party,
having power is primarily responsible."
Both Senate and House will run
along for the next two years under
about the same leadership as in the last
% Congress. The large number of new
men will take the places that are
assigned them and will probably adapt
themselves to the legislative harness
- without much kicking or balking. In
the House the whote number of repre
sentatives has beeti increased from 356
in the last Congress to 386 in this. The
Republican majority in tbe House has
been increased from 34 in tha last Con
gress to 114 in this.
Gen. J. Warren Kiefer of Ohio has
returned as a member of this Congress
after an absence of twenty two years.
He was Speaker of the 47th Congress;
and at the meeting Monday was allow
ed to selecfhis own seat
■H The Senate in the coming session will
run along with three empty seats.
Mitchell of Oregon, and Bnrton, of
Kansas, will remain away from the
sessions, because of the little difficulties
they have become involved in with the
legal branch of the Government.
Neither of them will venture to show
himself in the Senate because they are
~ aware if they do so, their right to be
there will be challenged.
The third vacant seat will be due to
the failure of the Delaware Legislature
to elect a successor to Senator Ball. It
is the expectation that Senator
Burton will soon relieve the Senate of
its embarrassment concerning him, by
resigning.
On Monday, at noon, Clerk Mc-
Dowell called the house to order,
Messrs Cannon and Williams were
nominated for Speaker, Cannon receiv
ing 248 and Williams 128 votes, All
the old clerks and officers were re
elected and sworn in; and the old rules
adopted, after a humorous discussion,
but those hide Bound rules are said to
be no joke.
Vice President Fairbanks opened the
Senate, the newly elected members
were sworn in and a committee appoint
ed to wait on the President, with the
House Committee.
On Tuesday the President's Message
was read in both houses. It is a long
and able document, a synopsis of which
appears on our first page.
Yesterday Mr. Townsend of Michigan
introduced an amended form of the Esh-
Townsend rate bill, which passed the
last House, in the House. The bill
embodies the President's views on the
subject, empowers'the Interstate Com
merce Commission to examine the
books and accounts of the railroads, and
Establish maximum and minimum rates,
with appeal to the Supreme Court.
Russian Affairs.
The people of Russia seem to be slow
ly but surely drifting into political
chaos. There are at least three factions
there—the Reds or Radicals or Social
ists who want to pull down or upset
everything; the Moderates, led by Witte
and the Czar, who wish to establish a
• Limited or Constitutional monarchy
but who seem to mov« too slowly to
head off the radicals; and the old Grand
Ducal or Autocratic faction who wish
things as they were and find fault with
the Czar for not using the force yet at
his command.
The mutiny in the army and navy at
Sebastopol, last week, was quelled by
force, and is said to have cost the lives
of 5000 men, but disaffection is reported
in the army and navy at all points in
cluding the Royal guards at the Czar's
country palace, and besides this the
Government has run short of money,
the railroaders, telegraph operators and
postal employees are on a strike,
and things look "blue" in Russia.
The St, Petersburg correspondent of
the Paris "Matin" describes the sinister
aspect of the Russian capital. He savs
that patiols are everywhere, that the
doors and windows of houses are closed,
that stores are barricaded and that Cos
sacks are camping in tbe streets.
IT is worthy of note that none of the
great states have been carrying a sur
plus fund in their treasury anything
like that of Pennsylvania. Illinois
funds in the Treasurer's hands at one
time range from SIOO,OOO to $3,000,000.
New York's general fund is something
over i|4,000,000 and the canal fund a
little over #3 000,000, but may be in
creased to $15,000,000 or $20,000,000;
this, however, is for a specific purpose.
Ohio's funds for deposit averaged sl,-
849,000 last year. Missouri has a little
over $2,000,000. Massachnsetts's de
posits range fcom |1,000,000 to $5,000,-
000. If Pennsylvania's fund was kept
within reasonable measure of the State's
needs the danger of a great surplus be
ing available for political or personal
manipulation would be moat effectively
removed.
THE demands of the Powers regard
ing the finances of Macedonia, a prov
ence of Turkey, were acceded to by the
Sultan, yesterday, and the foreign fleets
will withdraw from Turkish waters.
Auother butchery of Hebrews was re
ported from Odessa. Russia, yesterday.
The killing was done by a mob called
"Hooligans," and nobody dared move
the corpses which were left lying in the .

Tlie Vaccination Decision.
The opinion rendered by Attorney
General Carson to the State Superin
tendent cf Instruction concerning the
mooted conflict between the compulsory
education law and the school vaccina
tion law disposes of the controversy,
but leaves a hiatus in the legislation.
Mr. Carson very plainly explains that
there is no-disagreement between the
statutes, because one imposes a duty
upon the parents, the other a duty upon
the teachers, both of which can be
obeyed without conflicting with each
other. The compulsory education law
requires that parents shall send their
children to school When a parent has
done so he has performed all the duties
required of him under that act. The
other law prohibits teaAers from ad
mitting children who have not been
vaccinated. This statute does not im
pose any duty upon parents. There is
no provision making vaccination com
pulsory. Consequently between the
two legislative stools the intent of the
legislators falls to the ground.
Obviously this gap cannot be per
mitted to remain open. It will become
the duty of the Legislature at the
earliest possible moment to amend the
vaccination act so that it will accom
plish what it was intended to accom
plish. It would be incongrnous if in
the double effort to secure the educa
tion and vaccination of all children
within the State a legislative oversight
should permit the disregard of both
statutes.—Ex.
THE execution of Mrs, Rodgers, for
the murder of her husband, at Windsor,
Vermont, is fixed for tomorrow, Friday.
THE political crisis in England reach
its climax, Monday, wbeu Balfour and
his cabinet resigned, and the King ask
ed Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to
be Premier and form a new cabinet.
THE Cuban elections resulted in the
re-election of President Palma.
Attorney General's Killings.
Attorney General Carson rendered
the following opinions in response to re
ports from State officials and others
connected with the State government.
To Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion N. C. Schaeffer—That under the
compulsory education law a fine cannot
be imposed upon parents or guardians
for the non-attendance of pupils who
have been excluded from the public
schools on the ground that they do not
present a certificate of successful vaccin
ation.
To Maj. Levi G. McCauley, Vice
President of the Soldiers Orphans'
School Commission -That the benefits
provided for children of soldiers, sailors
and marines of the various wars cannot
in anv possible way apply to the grand
children of such soldiers, sailors and
marines.
To State Fish Commissioner W. E.
Meehan—That under the act of 1905
classifying the species of fish in such
parts of boundary lakes the commission
has the power to seize and confiscate the
nets in all cases, where the owners can
not be found or apprehended.
To Banking Commissioner J. A. Ber
key—That the practice of the depart
ment in ruling that the mortgages and
judgments of building and loan associa
tions cannot be used as collateral for
borrowed moneyis sound.
End of tlie Foot Ball Season.
At Princeton, N. J., last Saturday,
the West Pointers and the Middies en
gaged in a ferocious game of foot ball,
ending at dark in a tie—6 to 6. Presi
dent Roosevelt, ex-Pre«ident Cleveland,
J. P. Morgan and many other promi
nent men witnessed the game. The
audience was estimated at 25.000.
Same day at the Crystal Palace
grounds near London, 80,000 people
gathered to see a game between the
crack team of England and the New
Zealand champions, the latter winning.
The New Zealandero have attracted
great attention, not only by their brilli
ant series of victories, but because they
have developed the game to a stage be
yond what was known there. The last
great charged was effected by the Welsh
clubs, who introduced four three
quarterbacks instead of six. The 15
players were divided into eight for
wards, two' halfbacks, four three
quarterbacks and one fullback. Tlie
New Zealanders play seven forwards
only, and with eight men behind play a
very fast, hard-passing game with ac
curacy and speed. No team hitherto has
been able to cope with them.

five summers had passed over the head
of Mrs. Martha Biehl, widow of Peter

LINCOLN'S FOREFATHERS.
A Strain of 7roKeily Kuans Through
Their History.
Abraham Lincoln's forefather.* were
pioneers—nitn who left their homes to
ppen up the wilderness and make the
way plain for others to follow them.
For 170 years, ever since the first
American Lincoln came from England
to Massachusetts, in 1033, they had
been moving slowly westward as new
1 settlements were made iu the forest
They faced solitude, privation and all
the dangers and hardships that beset
men who take up tlieir li jrnes where
3f)iy beasts aud wild men have had
fionies before, but they continued It)
press steadily forward, though they
lost fortune and sometimes even life,
itself ill their westward progress.
Back iu Pennsylvania and New Jer
sey some of the Lincolns had been moil
of wealth and influence. In Kentucky,
where the future president was horn
pa Feb. |2, 1809, his parents lived iu
deep poverty. Their home was a small
log cabin of the rudest kind, and noth
ing seemed more unlikely than that
their child, coming into the world in
such humble surroundings, was des
tined to be the greatest man of his
time. Trup to his race, lie also was to
be a pioneer, not, indeed, like hit. an
cestors, a leader into now woods and
unexplored fields, but a pioneer of a
nobler and grander sort, directing the
thoughts of men ever toward the light
Hint leading the American people
through difficulties aud dangers and q
mighty war to peace and freedom.
The story of this wonderful man be
gins and ends with a tragedy, for his
grandfather, also named Abraham, was
Kiiled by a shot from an Indian's rifle
while peaceably at work with his three
eons on the edge of their frontier deal
ing. Eighty-one years later the presi
dent himself met death by an assas
sin's bullet. 'Bio murderer of one was
a savage of the forest; the murderer of
the other that far more cruel thing, a
savage of civilization. —St. Nicholas.
FLATTERING RULERS.
Their Weak l'oluta Pass lanotjc(l),
Xapuleoa'a Marksiunnaliiii.
Rulers have always been flattered,
from Canute's time downward, it be
ing, it would seem, an unwritten law
thai .t monarch's weak points should
pass unrecognized. Napoleon 111. once
said, iu consoling a friend who chanced
10 be shooting with him for his poor
marksmanship:
"You lieed not fret about It. The em
peror (by wbieh he meant bis uncle, the
great Napoleon I ) was even a worse
shot than you are. The ouly time they
liut a gun in his hand he killed a poor
I ;mnd end went away thinking he had
killed a stag,
"In tliose days the stag, whenever
brought to bay. was left for the em
peror to kill. One day, however, the
emperor was not to be found, and the
master of the staghouuds finished the
j.niuial with his knife. Just then the
emperor came in sight.
'•They hurriedly got the dead stag on
Its i"!;j, propping it lip with branches,
etc.. and handed the emperor the 'cara
bine of honor,' as it was called. The
emperor tired, and of course the stag
fumbled over, but at the same time
('tern was a piteous whine from one of
the hounds, which had been shot
through the hoad.
"The emperor wheeled around, un
conscious of the mischief lie had done,
saying to one of the aids-de-camp,
'After all, I am not as bad a shot as
they pretend";'"
