GRAFTON POLITICS
ANDJTOW RUN
Form An Interesting Topic* For a
Traveling: Man Who Scores
44The Rambler" There.
A Telegram reporter has this bit
of news from a traveling man concerning
the way politics are run
down in Grafton. Here is the story
i CJ?ICU IU IUC i cyui lci .
"I had some work down In one
corner of Taylor county which required
me to remain there over two
Sabbath days. I was stopping at a
small farm house In a turn of the
road and one of the most isolated
places on earth It appeared to tne
those two long Sabhath days. I
naturally looked up something to
read and on ' thorough search T
found some school books, two farm
journals and the Grafton Leader. It
was always troublesome for me to
become interested in school books
and so I began on the Weekly Leader.
I soon became very much taken
with an article over the name of
'Rambler.' In which he was roasting
the Grafton mayor and council
for many misdoings and especially
the mayor for having connection
with and protecting certain indicidaals
and street shows. In the next
issue which T found contained a
column and a half scoring the mayor
on various matters and in particular
T remember about being implicated
in some speakeasies along with the
chief of police. I concluded, therefore,
that Grafton muftt be a pretty
gay town and its mayor a fine fellow
and made up my mind to stop
off there on the first opportunity.
A short time ago I was coming In
from the east one Saturday evening.
My train was late and I admit T had
one treat ahead and felt pretty
tough. When T awoke it was late
and my head feW Hke I~ had just
been knocked over the ropes. My
bottle was empty and water ttinted
like quicksand going down my
throat. It ait once began to wonder
where T could get a tip to quench
the thirst when 'Rambler's 'press artides
came fresh In my mind and I
decided to hunt up that dolly mayor

The first witness was Benjamin

and Scott had a discussion In
the engine room over the diameter
of a valve, Scott contending it was
1 1-4 inches and Ridgeway saying
it was 1 1-2 inches. Then they
went np stairs to the ware room to
have James Connors decide the matter.
Cottrlll followed them and as
he arrived Ridgeway called Scott a

a fatal wound. Cottrlll's evidence
did not seem especially strong

of Grafton. Wihen I got on the
streets the church bells were ringin
gand people both old and young
were going both up and down In
droves, evidently to church, and the
town seemed as quiet as a country
village. I walked up and down and
finally bumped into one of the police.
T asked to see the mayor and
was lead through a hall and up
stairs but we failed to find him. In
answer to the officer's questions If
r had lost something .etc., I told my
business and was told the only way
T could possibly get a drink was to
consult a physician and get a prescription
and that was a doubtful
case. Piqued at this disappointment
T then asked the officers where all
rue speakeasies ana last places were
located which the mayor had been
reported as harboring and I went on
to explain where I had got my information.
To my surprise I was
informed there was nothing of the
kind in the town nor had not been
since the present mayor had been in
office. I was further informed that
this writer 'Rambler* was simply a
scape goat for a gang of politicians
who had been rooted out and was
taking this way to try to make the
citizens believe, if possible, that the
other side was as corrupt as the fellows
they had turned out. I went
back to my hotel, gathered by grips
and got out of that town on on the
first train swearing that If the Grafton
Trader had a wider circulation
that "Tom Pepper's renown as the
biggest Mar that ever lived would

TELLS OP HIS VISIT TO CANAL

. IBy Aasocitiad Press.}
WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dec. 17?
A special message was sent by President
Roosevelt to Congress today on
the Panama Canal.
President Roosevelt relates the
history of his visit, where he went,
what he did and the observations he
made of the work on the canal that
has already been done. Each daV
from 12 to 18 hoars were spent in
going over and Inspecting all there
was to ibe seen and In examining various
employes.
Work of the French.
"At the outset." he says, "I wish
to pay tribute to the amount of work
done by the French Canal Company
under very difficult circumstances.
Many of the buildings they put up
were excellent and are still in use,
tho, naturally, the houses are now
getting out of repair and are being
used as dwellings only until other
houses can be built, and much of the.
work they did in the Culebra cut,
and some of the work they did In '
digging has been of direct and real
benefit. This country has never
made a better investment than the
$40,000,000 which it paid to the
French Company for work and betterments.
including especially the
Panama Railroad.
"An Inspection on the ground at'
the height of the rainy season served
to convince .me of the wisdom of
Congress in refusing to adopt either
a high-level or a sea-level canal.
There seems to be- a universal agreement
among all people competent to
Judge that the Panama route, the
one actually cnosen. is mucn superior
to both the Nicaragua and Darlen
routes."
The President then tells of the
preliminary work being done on the
ranal. of
The Successful Sanitation,
the hospitals and their treatment,
of bis finding the health showing to
be remarkably good, and of the
diminution of. mosquitos due to scientific
extermination.
"The first great problem to be
solved." says the President, "upon
the solution of which the success of
tthe rest of the work depended, was
the problem of sanitation. This
was from the outset under the direction
of Dr. W. C. Gorgas, who Is to
be made a full members of the commission.

of the commission remains I

He tells of the Improvements In '
Panama and Colon, dwells on the (
Colon water supply and Colon's |
pavements, tells o fthc established
police system of the zone, and describes
the care of employes. He
states the quarters are good and
satisfactory, the food Buppltes good
snd that there Is no cause for com- |
plaint about either. He dwells on f
Chinese and other labor and states |
that In the main the commission
will have to rely for the ordinary
