to congress laid down the administration's plans for national da
teline. He told Ills hearers It was necessary to have a new and
broad doctrine for pan-America. With sharp words he arraigned
the Americans, who by sympathy for foreign belligerents had en
dangered the neutrality of the United States. His outline of plans
for defense and need for them was received In silence. Ills de
claration of a new pun-American doctrine was received with the
deepest interest and applause. The house galleries were packed
hours before the president's arrival. Rumor of a woman suffragist
demonstration brought out extra guards. Mrs. Gait and party had
seals in the executive gallery and watched closely while the presi
dent spoke. When he urged merchant marine legislation there
was so much applause that ho was forced to stop for a moment.

WASHINGTON, Dee. 7. A doctrine
of pan-Americanlsmof full partner
ship between the nations of the
Western Hemisphere in world affairs
as proclaimed by President Wil
son today in bis H'1"1 annual address
to Congress, the theme of which was
preparedness by the United States to
defend not only its own independence
but the rights of those with whom It
has made common cause. The nies
bukh was lead by the President to
the Senate and House assembled In
Joint session In the chamber of the
Hoiine
Porto Rico bills which failed of final
passage at the last session; conser
vation legislation; a law giving feder
al aid to Industrial and vocational
education; and the creation of a com
mission to inquire into tne transpor
tation problem.
Naturalized and native born Ameri
cans who, sympathizing with belli
gerents abroad, have plotted and con
spired to violate their own country's
neutrality were scathingly denounc
ed by the president, and congress was
urged to provide adequate federal
laws to deal with such offenders.
Internal taxation was proposed as
the means of providing the money
Kverv recommendation embodied In i necessary to add to the naval and
L' ' .... ... .... ! ...in... ...1.11..1.... o.. ..........
thu rWnmeiit had to do witn compre
hensive plans for strengthening the
national defenses. The program In
cluded the army and navy plans al
ready made public by Secretaries Gar
rison and Daniels; legislation for
government owned merchant ships;
a rural credit law; the Philippine and
military establishments. Sources of
I ax in ion suggested were incomes,
gasoline, naptha, automobiles and in
ternal explosion engines, fabricated
iron and steel, and a stamp tax on
bank checks, extension of the war
revenue hill and continuance of the
present tariff on sugar were recom
mended, and the sale of bonds opposed.
This message was the longest Mr.
Wilson has ever delivered to Con
gress., He began with ji statement
that since he last addressed Congress:
"The European war has extended
Its threatening and sinister scope un
til it has swept Into Its flame some
portion of eyery quarter of the globe,
not excepting our own hemisphere,
has altered the whole face of Interna
tional affairs, and now presents ' a
prospect of reorganization and recon
struction such as statesmen and peo
ples have never been called upon to
attempt before."
The United States has remained
neutral, he said, because It had no
interest in the causes and because It
was the duty of the nations or the
western hemisphere to prevent col
lective economic ruin. i
The president -pointed to the attt
tudo of the United States towards
Mexico as proving that this country
has no selfish motives in Its Inter
est In countries In Central and South
America. There was a time, be sold.
when the United States looked upon
Itself as a sort of guardian of the
republics to the south as against the
encroachment or efforts of political
control from Europe.
"But," he added, "It was always
difficult to maintain such a role with
out offense to the pride of the peo
ples whose freedom of action we
sought to protect, and every thought
ful man of affairs must welcome the
altered circumstances of the new day
