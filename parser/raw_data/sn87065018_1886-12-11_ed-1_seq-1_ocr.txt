SWEET, SO SUITE.
By the New MissisBippian Horse
Reporter.
Of beautiful rooms he had rented a suite,
For a nice little cottage just over the struite
Held a dear little maiden so winsome and
nuite
Whose smile made his heart like a churn
dasher buite.
He moaned and he moped and but little did
ulte,
For his heart hunger scorned the rough
bread and muite;
But a sight of that girl made his gladnes
compluite.
He turned horn the world, from its sin and
decuite,'
From iriendship so fickle and pleasures so
fluite.
He had entered Love's ring w'ith no thought
of detuite
Till the foot of her lather him harshly did
gruite
On that part of his pants—\mt I'd blush to
repulte
Though that kick should have cooled off
Love's passionate huite,
He loved but the harder that maiden pe
tuite.
He belonged, it is true, to the city's eluite,
And her pa wa6 a farmer who raised corn
and whuite,
Yet the proud maids of fashion with cool
ness he'd truite,
And always with rapture this girl he would
muite,
And in spite of the danger
Of her father, the granger
They'd have run off and wedded
Though greatly he dreaded
The license, three dollars, his purse would
depluite;
But a terrible thought turned him white as
a shuite—
He could not wed a girl with such awlu
big fuite !
MISSISSIPPI BILLS BEFORE CON
GRESS.
Now that Congress is upon the point
of reassembling, it will be interesting to
note what matters of legislation relating
to the States of Mississippi and Ala
bama are already pending before it.
First, in Mississippi there is a bill
authorizing the Mississippi and Louis
iana Bridge and Railroad Company, of
Natchez, to construct a bridge over the
Mississippi river at or near Natchez.
The main channel span shall not be less
than 700 feet wide in the clear, to be
placed at right angles to the direction
of the current, aud the spans on either
side of the main one shall not be less
than 375 feet. The bill was introduced
by Mr. Walthall.
A bill introduced by Mr A an Eaton,
provides for a bridge over Bayou Bar
nard, near the town of llaudsborough,
provided it have a draw 7 of not less thau
thirty feet.
Mr. Catching* has a bill before the
Senate making the counties of Tunica,
Coahoma, Bolivar, Washington Sun
flower, Sharkey, Issaquena aud Warren
the Western division of the Northern
Judicial District of Mississippi and
providing for the holding of court at
Vicksburg on the first Monday of each
January and July.
Vicksburg is also proposed to be
benefited by the erection of a building
there to be used for the United States
courts, postoffice, custom office and in
ternal revenue office. This building is
to cost not exceeding $100,000.
Corinth is to come in for an improve
ment in the shape of a road to the Na
tional Cemetery at that point. The bill
introduced by Mr. Walthall appropri
atas $10,000 for a macadam, gravel, or
partly gravel and partly stone road.
Mississippi is also interested in a bill
authorizing the construction of a bridge
the Mississippi at Memphis by
across
the Kansas City and Memphis Railroad
and Bridge Company. The provisions
of this bill arc somewhat similar to the
authorizing a bridge at Natchez, re
one
feired to above.

In my last annual message to the
Congress, attention was directed to the
fact that
THE REVENUES OF THE GOVERNMENT,
exceeded its actual needs, and it w'as
suggested that legislative action should
be taken to relieve the people from the
unnecessary burden of taxation thus
made apparent. In view of the pres
ing importance of the subject, I deem
it my duty to again urge its considera
tion. The income of the government,
by its increased volume and through
economies in its collection, is now
more than ever in excess of public
necessities. The application of the
surplus to the payment of such portion
of the public debt as is now at our
option, subject to extinguishment, if
continued at the rate which has lately
prevailed, would retire that class of
indebtedness within less than one year
from this date. Thus a continuation
of our present revenue system would
soon result in the receipt of an annual
income much greater than necessary to
meet 'government expenses, with no
indebtedness upon w hich it could be
applied. We should then be con
fronted with a vast quantity of money,
the circulating medium of the people,
hoarded in the Treasury when it should
be in their hands, or we should be
drawn into wasteful public extrava
gance, with all the corrupting national
demoralization which follows in its
train.
But it is not the simple existence of
this surplus and its threatened atten
dant evils which furnish the strongest
arguments against our present scale of
Federal taxation. Its worst phase is
the exaction of such a surplus through
a perversion of the relations between
the people and their government and
a dangerous departure from the rules
which limit the right of Federal taxa
tion. Good government, and especially
the government of which every Ameri
can citizen boasts, has for its objects
the protection of every person within
its care in the greatest liberty consis
tent with the good order of society and
his perfect security in the enjoyment
of his earnings, with the least possible
diminution for public needs. When
more of the people's substance is
exacted through the form of taxation
than is necessary to meet the just
obligations of the government and the
expense of its economical administra
tion such exaction becomes ruthless
extortion and a violation of the funda
mental principles of free government.
The indirect manrer in which these
exactions are made has a tendency to
conceal their true character and their
extent. But we have arrived at a stage
of superfluous revenue, which has
aroused the people to a realization ot
the fact that the amount raised profes
sedly for the support of the government
is paid by them as absolutely, if added
to the price of the things which sup
plied their daily wants, as if it was paid
at fixed periods into the hands of the
tax-gatherer
Those who toil for daily wages are
beginning to understand that capital,
though sometimes vaunting its impor
tance and clamoring for the protection
and favor of the government, is dull
,
:
of
and sluggish till touched by the magi
cal hand of labor it springs into activi
ty, furnishing an occassion for Federal
taxation and gaining the value frhich
enables it to bear its burden, i*nd the
laboring man is thoughtfully inquiring
whether, in these circumstances and
considering the tribute he constantly
pays into the public treasury as he sup
plies his daily wants, he receives his
fair share of advantages.
There is also a suspicion abroad that
he surplus of our revenue indicates
abnormal and exceptional business
profits, which under the system which
produces such suplus increases without
corresponding benefit to the people at
large the vast accumulations of a few
among our citizens, whose fortunes,
rivaling the wealth of the most favored
in anti-Democratic nations, are not the
natural growth of a steady, plain and
industrious republic. >
Our farmers too, and those engaged
directly and indirectly in supplying the
productions of agriculture, see that day
by day, and as often as the daily wants
of their households recur, they are
forced to pay excessive and needless
taxation, while their prouducts strug
gle in foreign markets with the compe
tition of nations, which by allowing
a freer exchange of productions than
we permit, enable their people to sell
for prices which distress the American
farmer.
In readjusting the burdens of Federal
taxation a sound public policy requires
that such of our citizens that have
built up large and important indus
tries under present conditions should
not be suddenly and to their injury
depriveed of the advantages to which
they have adapted their business ; but
if the public good requires it they
should be content with such considera
tion as shall deal fairly and cautiously
with their interests, while the just
demand of the people for relief from
needless taxation is honestly answered.
Due regard should be also accorded
in any proposed readjustment to the
interests of American labor. This
regard and attention should be awarded
them not only because labor is the
capital of our workingmen, justly en
titled to its share of government favors,
but for the further and not less im
portant reason that the laboring man,
surrounded by his family in his humble
home, as a consumer is vitally inter
ested in all that cheapens the cost of
living and enables him to bring within
his domestic circle additional comforts
and advantages.
The relation of the workingman to
the revenue law's of the country, and
the mannner in which it palpably in
fluences the question of wages, should
the justifiable
not be forgotten in
prominence given to the proper main
tenance of the supply and protection
of well-paid labor, and these consid
erations suggest such an arrangement
of government revenues as shall re
duce the expense of living, while it
does not curtail the opportunity for
work, nor reduce the compensation of
American labor and Injuriously affect
its condition and the dgnified place it
holds in the estimation of our people.
But our farmers and agriculturists—
those who from the soil produce the
things consumed by all—are perhaps
more directly and plainly concerned
than are any other of our citizens in a
just and careful system o* Federa
taxation.
I recommend that, keeping in view
all of those considerations, the increas
ing and unnecessary surplus of national
income annually accumulating be re
leased to the people by an amendment
to our revenue laws, which shall
cheapen the price of the necessaries of
life and give freer entrance to such
imported materials as by American
labor may be manufactured in merket
able eommodites.
The sum paid upon the public debt
during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1886, was $44,551,043.36. During the
twelve months ended October 31,1886,
3 per cent, bonds were called for re
demption amounting to $127,283,100 of
which $80,643,200 was so called to
answer the requirements of the law
relating to the sinking fund, and $46,*
639,900 for the purpose of reducing the
public debt by application of a part of
the surplus in the Treasury to that
object. Of the bonds thus called $102,
269,540 became subject under such calls
to redemption prior to November 1,
1886, the remainder, amounting to
$25,013,630, matured under the calls
after this date.
In addition to the amount subject to
payment and cancellation prior to
Nov. 1, there were also paid before that
day certain of these bonds, with the
interest thereon, amounting to $60,
002,350, which were anticipated as to
their maturity, of which $2,664,850 had
not been called, thus $1,007,341,800 had
been actually applied prior to the 1st
of November, 1886, to the extinguish
ment of our bonded and interest bear
ing debt, having on that day still out
standing the sum of $1,113,443,112. Of
these amounts $86,848,700 were still
represented by 3 per cent, bonds. They,
however, have been since Nov. 1, or
will at once be further reduced by $22,
606,150, being bonds which have been
called, as already stated, but not re
deemed and cancelled before the latter
date.
During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1886, there were coined under the
in
of
of
ly
of
of
COMPULSORY SILVER COINAGE
act of 1878, 29,838,905 silver dollars, and
the cost of the silver used in such
coinage was $23,448,960.01. There had
been coined up to the close of the
previous fiscal year, under the provi
sions of the law, 203,882,554 silver dol
lars.and on the first day of December,
1886, the total amount of such coinage
was $247,131,549.
The director of the mint reports that
at the time of the passage of the law
of 1878, directing this coinage, the
intrinsic value of the dollars thus
coined was 941 cents each, and that on
the 31st day of July, 1886, the price of
silver reached the lowest stage ever
known, so that the intrinsic or bullion
price of our standard silver dollar at
that date was less than 72 cents.
The price of silver on the 30th day
of November last was such as to make
these dollars intrinsically worth
seventy-eight cents each. These dif
ferences in value of the coins represent
the fluctuations in the price of silver,
and they certainly do not indicate that
compulsory coinage by the government
enhauces the price of that commodity
or secures uniformity in its value.
Every fair and legal effort has been
made by the Treasury Department to
distribute this currency among the
people. The withdrawal of United
States Treasury notes of small denomi
nations and the issuing of small silver
certificates have been resorted to in
the endeavor to accomplish this result,
in obedience to the wish and senti
ments of the representatives of the
people in Congress. On the 27th day
of November, 18S6, the people held of
these coins, or certificates representing
them, the nominal sum of $166,873,041,
and we still had $79,464,345 in the
Treasury, as against about $142,894,055
in the hands of the people and $72,885,
376 remaining in the treasury one year
ago. The Director of the mint again
urges the necessity of more vault-room
for the purpose of storing these silver
dollars which are not needed for circu
lation by the people.
I have seen no reason to change the
views expressed in my last annual
message on the subject of this com
pulsory coinage, and I again urge its
suspension on all the grounds contained
in my former recommendation, rein
forced by the significant increase of our
gold exportations during the last year,
as appears by the comparative state
ment herewith presented, and for the
further reasons that the more this
currency is distributed among the
people the greater becomes our duty to
protect it from disaster ; that we now'
have abundance for all our needs, and
that there seems but little propriety in
building vaults to store such currency
when the only pretense jor its coinage
s the necessity of its use by the people
as a circulating medium.
THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF
WAR
gives a detailed account of the admin
istration of his department, and con
tains sundry recommendations for the
improvement of the service, wiiich I
fully approve, The army consisted at
the last consolidated return of 2103
officers and 24,946 enlisted mpn.
The expenses of the department for
the last fiscal year were $36,990,903 38,
including $6,294,305 43 for public works
and river and harbor improvements.
I especially direct the attention of
the Congress to the recommendation
that officers be required to submit to
an examination as a preliminary to
their promotion. I see no objection, but
many advantages, in adopting this fea
ture, which has operated so beneficially
in our navy department, as well as in
some branches of the army.
The subject of
COAST DEFENSES AND FORTI FC AT IONS
has been fully and carefully treated by
the board on fortifications, whose re
port was submitted at the last session
of Congress, but no construction, work
of the kind recommended by the board
has been possible during the last year
from the lack of appropriations for such
purposes. The defenseless condition of
our seacost and lake frontier is perfect
ly palpable.
I hope effective steps will be taken in
that direction immediately. The val
uable and suggestive treatment of this
subject by the Secretary of War is earn
estly recommended to the consideration
of the Congress.
In September and October last,
THE HOSTILE APACHES,
who under the leadership of Geronimo,
had for eighteen months been on the
warpath, and during that time had
committed many murders and been the
cause of constant terror to the settlers
of Arizona, surrendered to Gen. Miles,
the military commander who succeeded
Gen. Crook in the management and
directing of their pursuit. Under the
terms of their surrender, as then re
ported, and in view of the understand
ing which these murderous savages
seemed to entertain of the assurances
given them, it was considered best to
imprison them in such manner as to
prevent their ever engaging in such
outrages again instead of trying them
for murder.
THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF
THE NAVY
contains a detailed exhibit of the con
dition of his department, w ith such a
statement of the action needed to im
prove the same as should challenge the
earnest attention of the Congress. The
present navy ot the United States,
aside from the ships in course of con
struction, consists of—
1. Fourteen single turreted monitors,
none of which are in commission, nor
at the present time serviceable. The
batteries of these ships are obsolete,
and they can only be relied upon as
auxiliary ships in harbor defense, and
then after such an expenditure upon
them as might not be deemed justifi
able.
2. Five fourth rate vessels of small
tonnage, only one of which was de
signed as war vessel, and all of which
are auxiliary merely.
3. Twenty-seven ships, three of
which are built of iron, of small ton
nage, and tw'enty-four of these w'ooden
vessels.
It is estimated by the chief con
structor of the navy that only three
will be serviceable beyond a period of
six years, at which time it may be
said that of the present naval force
nothing worthy the name will remain.
The affairs of
THE POSTAL SERVICE
show marked and gratifying improve
ment during the last year. A particu
lar account of its transactions and con
ditions is given in the report of the
Postmaster General, which will he laid
before you. The reduction of the rate
of letter postage in 1883 rendering the
postal revenue inadequate to sustain
the expenditures, and business depres
sion also contributing, resulted in an
excess of cost for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1885, of eight one-third mil
lion dollars.- But proper measures of
economy have so satisfactorily limited
the growth of expenditure that the
total deficiency in fact fell below that
of 1885, and at this time the increase
of revenue is in a gaining ratio over
the increase of cost, demonstrating the
sufficiency of the present rates of
postage ultimately to sustain* the ser
vice. This is the more pleasing, be
cause our people enjoy now both
cheaper postage, proportionately to
distances, and a vaster and more costly
service than any other upon the globel
The continued operation of the law
relative to our
CIVIL SERVICE
has added the most convincing proofs
of its necessity and usefulness. It is a
fact worthy of note that every public
officer who has a just idea of his duty
to the people testifies to the value of
this reform. Its staunchest friends are
found among those who understand it
best, and its warmest supporters are
restrained and protected by its require
ments. The meaning of such restraint
and protection is not appreciated by
those who want places under the gov
ernment regardless of merit and effi
ciency, nor by those who insist that
the selections for such places should
rest upon a proper credential showing
active partisan work. They mean to
public officers, if not their lives, the
only opportunity afforded them to at
tend to attend public business, and
they mean to the good people of the
couutry the better performance of the
work of their government.
It is exceedingly strange that the
scope and nature of this reform are so
little understood, and that so many
things not included within its plan are
called by its name. When it can yield
more fully to examination the system
will have large additions to the num
ber of its friends.
Our civil service reform may be im
perfect in some of its details, it may be
misunderstood and opposed, may not
always be faithfully applied; its designs
may sometimes miscarry through mis
take or intent; may sometimes tremble
under the assaults ot its enemies o
languish under miguided zeal of im
practicable friends, but the people of
this country will never submit to the
banishment of its underly principle
from the operation of their govern
ment. They will not abandon the
surest guarantee of the safety and suc
cess of American institutions.
l.JI invoke for this reform the cheerful
ungrudging support of the Congress. I
renew' my recommendation made last
year that the commissioners be made
equal to other officers of the govern
ment having like duties and responsi
bilities, and I hope that such reasonable
appropriations may be made as will
enable them to increase the usefulness
of the cause they have in charge.
In conclusion, I would earnestly in
voke such wise action on the part of
the people's legislators as will subserve
the public good and demonstrate dur
ing the remaining days of the Congress,
as at present organized, its ability and
inclination to so meet the people's
needs that it shall be greatfully remem
bered by an expectant constituency.

I have been on an excursion to the

"My wife went with me," he added, but
that was not the most astonishing part
of his statement This was the strange
assertion: "The whole » trip only cost

make that single quarter of a dollar go
so far? This was my inquiry. He has
a horse and he has a carriage; they
gave him his conveyance. At an easy

through Massachusetts, and up

Did he tell the truth? I

For &
week or so before he hitched up for the
excursion his wife hovered over the
kitchen stove preparing

lunches, and in the body of the light
wagon was packed away provender for
the horse. So they journeyed. Man
and beast had each a plenty, and not
one night on all the w r ay, going or com

mocks that they took along in which to
dream the nights away out of doors; for
all along the route open farm-house
doors invited them in not only to shelter
but to good, substantial supper and
breakfast tables. People spend hun
dreds of dollars on excursions to similar
resorts, go flying, stilling in hot and
dusty railroad cars to mean garrets in
fashionable hotels, and know not a
tithe of the real pleasure that attended
this jaunt.
But how was that quarter spent? The
good wife had no share in that. Much'

streets of Boston are wearing on the
