The message sent to congress yesterday
by President Cleveland Is devoted almost
entirely to foreign and financial affairs.
It is written in the usual heavy. Involved,
turgid, Cleveland style, and will hardly
pmva lively or interesting reading
to the general public. The administration
has been so severely criticisod during the
)**st year that the document Is in the na
ture of a defense, and a somewhat labored
11.tempt to show that what lias been done
has been In accordance with the beet ideas
of statesmanship. As to whether the evi
dence presented is conclusive proof that
the government has been under the direc
tion of wise men. who have been suited to
the tasks given them, there will be very
decided differences of opinion.
The president, ln opening, rejoices that
Argentine, In return for getting Its wool
free into this country, has seen fit to ad
mit some of our products under lower
duties, but fails to mention the fact that
the amount o f these products Is small as
compared with that exported to Argentine
and other South American countries under
the beneficent Blaine reciprocity treaties
whtch were abrogated by the Wilson-Gor
man bill He comments favorably upon
the satisfactory condition of the Internal
affairs of certain foreign nations and ln
touching upon the Waller one. gives the
impression that It has been managed to
the satisfaction of tho administration. It
■eems to he sufficient to have the French
government say that it tried and con
victed the ex-consul, but as to what there
wss to aupport the chants* sxain-t him
la not y ot. forthcoming, and. from the eon
tented of mind In which the presi
dent appears to be over the matter, it will
not be forthcoming for some tim«.
Mr Cleveland injects a little of his free
trade doctrine Into a brief review of our
trad« reUU >ns with Germany, relt-ratin,;
s ime of wall worn phrases about a
free exchange cf commodities, and the im
periling of our footing lr»"Asternal mar
he's. especially Ir Germany, but springs
a little surprise upon his reader* by
filially confessing that the products dis
criminated asxir.st by the fatherland are
cattle and other food product* which have
been judged to be deleterious to health
Just why the tariff Is mentioned at th's
p ;nt Is not evident. Neither is It quite
clear why he mixes up American Insur
ance comjvaaies and their branches abroad
with the tariff laws and thej- effects upon
international trade.
The me««u;e i;.J at*s that there ha*
been some correspondence between tho
United States and Great Britain on thr»
V*netu«la boundary >n. and the ad
ministration has very properly voiced the
sentiments cf the Amer! 'an people In ap
prising her majesty's government that the
traditional ard e&tabl shod ; iley of this
government is opposed to Increase by any
F iropean p aer of its territorial
s'ons on these cor'inertia; that th's policy
is as well fc !>d In prin ij-ie as It is
strong'.y support 1 by numerous prece
dents; that .v* a c justice the United
S'a'es Is bo'.'i.l pro" >st aeair«! the en-
Is rg ement of the area of British Guiana In
dcrogv n of " r «d ag*'r.«t tV

arbitrary line through the territory In de
bate and to 3- a-e that it w .51 t- ; v. t to

tblrt. Th s declaration of principles has a
Monroe ring to It. b t it is to be feanr.t
there must hive t**n a « ik nlr.g when
Great Britain was asked far 4 an
swer as to wh«: 1 - * « » nil arbitrate.
The demand was mafle in Jut* it is now
J Vocmber, a-ni no reniy Is for h -onvng A
similarly firm attlruJe. !: Is inUaatod,
was productive of equally ta-.* ble reauits
in the Corinta affa.r. The president says

government did nothing but Iwslt on while
Ni~-tratr:* was paying OT»r f?MW to re
p» r the In* ;red d'gnity of a worthless
British '•nnswl.
In ; n to the slight and rather in
appropriate allusion to the tariff In con
nection with the exe'osfon of Amerlrsra
ca"le ar J Ins .ranee companies from Ger
many, another short reference hi made to
It in a way that 9*rr,'.ft~n the president 1s
abundantly well satisfied with the work
ing* of the so-called reform law. "We
may well be to earnest effort
In this direction," he eays, "when we
recall the *l< pi already taken toward
improving oi,r economic and financial
situation, and when we appreciate how
well the way has been prepared for
further progress by an Intelligent paf>tt!*f
Interest on these subjects." Just why we
should feel encouraged is not explained In
detail, and the trnpnnvment In our eco
nomic and financial condition Is not set
forth in a way that will satisfy the people
who have b<*en witnesses to the financial
and industrial distress of the past eighteen
months. And not a few will be tempted
to ask what the president would style the
new tariff law, if he designates the old
law as one Inefficient for the purpose of
revenue.
Fully one-hslf of the message Is devoted
to a study of our financial condition, with
an argument In favor of retiring the green
back, a presentation of the details of the
br.n'i sales, In which the responsiolllty for
them is thrown off on an tncompeUrnt con
gress, and a final giving of reasons why
the country should not enter upon the free
coinage of silver. This part of the docu
ment Is written with more or less elabora
tion and it Is impossible to comment upon
It briefly. As was to be expected, Mr.
Cleveland Insists that our revenue receipts
have nothing to do with the maintenance
of the gold reserve, on the difficulty of
preserving the Integrity of which he
writf-n at great length. In hOidinK this
view he very plainly misses the funda
mental trouble with the treasury, prob
ably for the simple reason that he dcesn't
care to view IB in the right light.
While the law says that the greenbacks
received by the treasury shall be reissued
it does not say that this shall be done Im
mediately, and as a matter of fact. It never
waa done immediately until the revenues
of the government began to fall below the
necessary amount. But sine* Carlisle has
been secretary greenbacks no sooner cam*
Into the treasury than they went out
again to pay current expenses. The truth
Is that while the bond issues have been
ostensibly for the benefit 6f the gold re
serve, a large part of the proceeds have,
a.-, matter of fact, been devoted to the pay
ment of the expenses of the government.
When bonds were sold the gold proceeds
wen; deposited to the credit of the reserve
fund. But when .the gold began to be
drawn out the greenbacks with which it
was drawn were paid out to meet current
expenses.
Under ordinary conditions these green
hacks would have been retained for a time
ln the treasury until there was a demand
for them, and then they would have been
paid out in exchange for gold. But the
lack of reserve made It necessary to pay
out the greenbacks as fast as they were
received for current expenses, and thus
thp Volume of greenbacks ln circulation
was always kept at the maximum, and
the treasury had nothing to attract gold.
That lack of revenue was the real cause of
the secretary's trouble is ahown clearly
enough by the fact that It never happened
before. \t'hile the revenues were in excess
of expenses the government never had any
difficulty in maintaining the gold reserve,
but as soon as they fell below. i:s mears
of getting gold was gone, because it had
to pay out the greenbacks as fast as It gu|
them for current expenses.
The president touches on various mas
ters, foreign and domestic, of consider
able importance, but the most interest will
be taken '.n the remedies he proposes for
getting the government ont of the predica
ment It is row in financially A great
many of his snggestlons aa to the currency
are worth careful consideration, and will
no doubt receive It, b?it it is hardly prob
ahl© that congress will view the financial
s tnation exactly as he do<*s, or will apply
for the relief of the country the remed.es
whi<-h he prescribes.

The Post-lntelligencer has received a
letter from a voter, who attaches his name
to it, of which the folluwing is an extra-t:
"I And that there are many voters.
sotne of them intelligent busings who

with wst>»r as T**rf. of a plan t 3 supply
for tnanufart'jrtnr purposes, ar, 1
for »?rr.« re«jr>n someNody Is trying to
malm the people believe that unless the
c'y spends JI.SS.T*) at once tbe city a
rights cannot be preserved, and that tt
will f-rever l~se the control of the Cedar
river water supply. This la absolutely
rot tm The city '*an condemn five years
fr-m n->w Just as well as now; the awar 1
of 4irr«"s will be mide then, as now, by
a Kirg county Jury, and none but an ap- j
primal of actual value could be had. The
city 1 •?<* none of its power of condemna
ti n, t *it ra'her Increases It, since It will
then go bef re the courts with a great
ptiMic necr-ssity, which no mm dare swear
exists now.
Ni corporation can get a on the
city. because the city owns the entire sys
tem of distribution, and no corporation
«n bring water Into the city, lay a pipe
or put up a wire for the supply of power
without a franrhise from the city. No
franchise need be granted unless the cor
poration consents to acknowledge the
city's rights.
The charter provides (Art. IV., sec. 17):
"No bill for the grant of any franchise
shall h« finally w.thin thirty days
after its Introduction."
This afT>rds ample opportunity tor pub
licity, arid, if necessary, a legal step suf
ficient to compel public attention.
The charter further provides (Art. IV.,
■ec. 24):
"Every grant of a franchise, right or
privilege shall besubject to the right of the
city council at any time thereafter to re
peal. change or modify the said grant, and
every ordinance miking such grant shall
contain such a reservation of th« right of
the city council to repeal, amend or mod
ify said ordinance, wlih due rf-gnrd to th<*
right* of the parties and the Interests of
the public."
The city is, therefore, imply protected
against any corporation proposing to In
troduce electric power, because It cannot
opera'e without a franchise, and the terms
of that franchise must be publicly known,
fur it cannot be rushed through In one
session.
The people have been scared by and are
running away from a bogey which is as

terror of an interest-bearing debt.
The reported Illness of the pope is giv
ing rise to speculations as to his probable
successor and in Washington City the
name of Satolli is being mentioned in con
nection with the pontifical office. His
friends give as reasons for his elevation
the following: The high favor In which
he stands with Leo XIII.; the turning of
tiio Catholic church, through Leo's Influ
ence, toward popular government; the op
portunity afforded the newly made cardi
nal to study that form of government at
tirst hand; his being raised to the cardin
alate at this time, when the pope's health
is visibly declining; his sympathy with
Leo's policy, and his capacity to continua
It; his skill as a diplomat, as shown by his
euccess-ful adjustment of delicate and dif
ficult contentions Ln the church In Ameri
ca; his age, guaranteeing years of vigor
ous service; his nationality, which gives
him strength over even so strong a man as
Cardinal Gibbons. Birth and long experi
ence in Italy, the home of the church's
headship, and the opportunity to stiaiy the
modern democratic movement In the Unit
ed States are certainly factors which
might work powerfully in the direction of
selecting Satolll, but past experience has
shown that fitness Is not always a sure
guaranteo of election.
The latest meaning of the words 'let
ter" ami "deposited in the mails" has been
defined recently by the United States su
preme court in the case of George Goode,
a Boston letter carrier, convicted of ab
stracting a decoy letter from the Roxbury
branch of that city and sentenced to three
years in the penitentiary. Upon these
points the court said In its opinion, that
a letter within the meaning of tue law was
a package that bore the outward sem
blance of a letter and came into the pos
session of the defendant in his official ca
pacity; that a letter was deposited ia the
mail, to all legal intent, when it was
placed In any compartment ordinarily
used for holding mail at any stage of Its
progress from the sender to the receiver.
That It did not reach the box from which
Goode abstracted It In the regular chan
nel had no influence upon the quality or
character of the letter. Of course, said
the court, if It had been dropped on the
floor of the office or laid upon a desk, it
could not be said to have been "deposited
ln the mail."

13.176 miles r.f surface street railways In

THE STATE PRE^S.
Elbe Union is the newer* state paper.
It is not very large, buflt starts out mod
estly, and wita every appearance of un
derstanding its business.
White River Journal: Csh the city of
Seattle afford to pile up another million
dollars* indebtedness for something we
can get along without? Is the question
for taxpayers to them*- Ives before
t.ley add to over $7<W a day interest.
Columbia Chronicle: English farmer*
ar? considering the question of adopting
protection for agricultural products. They
find that free trade is ruinous to their in
dustry. It begins to look as if the entire
world was going to adopt protection.
Ellens hi irg Dawn: We are sorry to
l<»arn that Brick Pomeroy's Advance
Thought, the Missouri Commoner and
Our Nation s Crisis, all good Populist pa
pers, are no more, having died for want
of financial support. Shame,'where is thy
blush.
Spokesman-Rev.pw: Although England
proper has an area of but ab.922 square
miles, as compared with square
miles In the state of Washington, the lit
tle island kingdom now carries its laws
and uniform into possessions and depend
encies aggregating 5,315,597 square miles.
Cheney Sentinel: The Spokane News,
which succeeded the Tribune, is dead. It
was a Populist parter. We have nothing
to say about it. We have seen the Pop
papers during the past year suspend in
such manner and numbers as to remind
us of the rats that swim from the sink

offer.
Waitsburg Times: If all indications are
true, the coming year will see an increase
in the output of American gold mines
which, even if it does not approach the
Kaffir expansion, will strongly affect the
American market. There is already a
marked impetus in the gold mining dis
tricts of Mcxntana and farther West, and
next yeur will be likely to more than du

Tacoma Ledger: The present overpro
duction in ultimatums recalls an Incident
which occurred within the charmed circle
of Tammany Hall. Thgre was a very de

committee. The committee Anally divided
after a bitter dispute, and a majority re
port was presented uuder the caption
"Our Ultimatum." The minority Indig

the classics, returned presently with a
minority report entitled "Our Ipso Dixit."
CLALLAM COUNTY.
Ferndal*. Humboldt Co., Cal., Nov. 31.
To the Editor: 1. How far is Port Ange
les, Clallam county, from Seattle. 2. Is
Clallam county considered a good agricul
tural county?, 3. Is the climate salubrious 1
4. What Is the annual rainfall at Port
Angeles? 5. Also average summer and
winter temperature? 6, How far is the
Quiilayute country from Port Angeles? 7.
Give names of newspapers published at
Port Angeles. T. R.
1. Port Angeles is eighty miles .north
west of Seattle.
S. The Dungeness country, lying In the
eastern portion of Clallam county. Is con
sidered exceptionally rich agricultural land,
and has been extensively farmed during
the past forty years. The crops are uni
formly good, and Victoria furnishes a con
venient market. Figures will probably
convey the best Idea as to the fertility of
Dungeness l soil. Potatoes have measured
1,000 bushels to the acre, and an average
yield is 600 bushels. Wheat will run 115
bushels to the acre, and often stands seven
feet high In the field. Oats yield 165 bush
els, and other cereals in proportion. Fruit
trees, especially prunes, plums, apples,
pears and cherries, bear prolifirally. The
Quiilayute country, lying in the west end
of the county, is also very fertile, and
the extensive prairies are ready for the
farmer without any preliminary expense.
The country lying In the central portion of
the county must first be cleared of its
heavy timber before it can be utilized for
agricultural purposes.
3. The climate is salubrious, th® death
rate being exceptionally low, probably ow
ing to the fact that the temperature is
uniform, and also to the absence of swim;) 3
or marshes.
4. The United States weather bureau at
Port Angeles reports the average rainfall
per annum to be 29 inches.
5. Tht» average temperature In the sum
mer is 56 degrees, and in the winter 42
degrees.
f>. Qulllayute is seventy miles west of
Port Angeles, .and can be reached by trail
or steamer.
7. The Port Angeles newspaper* are the
Tribune-Tlmea, Democrat-Leader and Si
moon.
THE BAIIK OLYMPIC CASE.
Port Blakeley, Dec.- 2,
To the Editor: I noticed in your paper
of yesterday an article In regard to some
trouble that had taken place between my
second-mate and myself. You were prob
ably not informed correctly in regard to
tho facts of the case. I would like to
state that the reason the case was settled
was not a case of being frightened on
my part, but in order to get any
Justice my vessel would ha.ve to be de
tained here a week at least I understand
affairs of this kind happen quite frequent
ly here, and always just the time a sUip
is ready for sea. so that a shipmaster for
want of time has no opportunity to de
fend himself. I think it would be for the
Interest and reputation of your rjty to
have such a condition of affaire reme-iiej,
