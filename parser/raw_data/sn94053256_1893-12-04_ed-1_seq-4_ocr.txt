Bicvele prices are taking a tumble like
everything else in the hard times nnd it
has been evident for some time that this
year's prices would not be maintained for
another season. It had been expected
that the drop would not be made until
spring when the retail trade opens, but
the Overman and Warwick companies of
Springfield after cerefnl consideration of
the question have taken the lead in the
matter by putting the price for the t4
models at $125. The reduction in price is
possible in part because the large outlay
involved in a radical change of model will
not be necessary. The change will not be
accompanied with any sacrifice for quality.
The new price will not go into effect till
January 1.

JUDGE ROOT'S HOUR.
THE MEYER CASE.
I of
and
The Defendant Record In Other Cities m
Strong Feature of the Prosecution H
Wm Charged In Chicago With Attempt
ing to Take Bis Wire's Uf.
New York, Dec. 4. The Meyer trial for
murder by poisoning was begun today in
the oyer and terminer before Justice Bar
rett, who has not figured in sensational liti
gation for some years. The interest in the
case is entirely in its technic. Dr. Henry
. Meyer has, if what is charged against
him can be proved, disdained all sentimen
tal and romantic accession in the creation
of a cause celebre. The interest in him rests
entirely upon his skill as a destroyer of hu
man life, if he is guilty.
That which the prosecution, which is
backed by all the mighty resources of the
Mutual Life Insurance company, will try
to prove is that in the first place Dr. H. C.
W. Meyer, his wife Maria and one Ludwig
Brandt, in the latter part of isyi nnd in the
city of Chicago, entered into a conspiracy
to defraud certain insurance com names.
Policies were takeu on Brandt's life In
favor of his legal representatives at the
time of his death, and then Mrs. Meyer
went through a ceremony of marriage with
Brandt, under the name of Gustave H. M.
Joseph Bauin, in order to become a bene
ficiary under the policies. There was at
that time, so far as known, uo intent to do
murder, and Brandt was an accomplice to
the fraud. Their plan, if it can be proved
that they had a plan, at the time was for
Brandt s disappearance, the substitution of
body for his and his resurrection for a
division of the spoils. It has been said,
though it may not be proved on the trial.
that this was the means ox livelihood ol
Meyer and firandt.
The Latest Conspiracy.
In March, lsiti, the trio and another man
named Wimmers, who is said to have
turned state's evidence since, came to New
York aud took the east side ground floor
flat of 320 East Thirteenth street. Shortly
afterward the alleged accomplice, Brandt,
called, under the name of Bauin, on Dr. S.
B. Miudel, then of First avenue andEighth
street, for treatment for what he called
and the doctor diagnosed as chronic dysentery.
ror several weeks he lingered, quite un
suspicious of his alleged confederate in the
fraud, r or all these weeks Dr. Mindel con
tinued to treat bitu for dysentery. Then
be died and was buried in the Lutheran
cemetery, aud the survivors of the house
hold on the ground floor flat suddenly
flitted.
The conspiracy of fraud and murder, if
such it was, seemed to have succeeded, for
Dr. Mindel hail innocently made out the
papers necessary" for the widow to get her
money. But the Mutual Life had had its
suspicions aroused by the incautious ap
pearance of Dr. Meyer with "'Mrs. Baum
when she came to get her money, and its
chief inspector, Daniel G. Gillette, was
sent hunting evidence ''with a fine tooth
comb."
A Ftmoiu Poisoner,
Detective Gillette soon found out that
Mrs. Bauru's" officious friend was the
most famous suspect poisoner in the country.
He had been arrested aud tried unsuc
cessfully in Chicago for poisoning his first
wife and the husband of a woman named
G elder man, who became bis second wife.
He had been charged with attempting to
poison her before he deserted her. He had
beeu accused of admiuistenng nitroglycer
in to aanan whose life was insured in his
favor and taking him out rowing on a hot
summer day with the purpose of bringing
him back dead of "sunstroke.'' The
Equitable company had refused to pay a
policy of 5,000 which he had on the life of
a woman whose proof of death came from
Toledo.
The exhumation of Brandt's body nat
urally followed these discoveries. District
Attorney Nicoll's pathologists and chem
ists examiued it aud said that they found
proof of the administration of at least 30
grains of antimony. The symptoms of
poison iug by this drug are similar to these
found in dysentery.
The arrvsis of Dr. and Mrs. Meyer were
made m Detroit, where they were living in
July hist.
Dr. Meyer will be put ou trial alone. It
is expected that the man Wimmers aud a
woman named Mary Nei s, who, it is said,
was selected as the victim of the Toledo
case, will prove the chief witnesses against
him.

London Anarchists Croated a IjTcljr
In Trafalgar Square
Lon don, Dec 4. The good and bad peo
ple of London were treated to a sight
rarely seen in England. It was little less
than anarchy bidding a bold defiance to
the law, and the authorities making a dis
play of police calculated to strike terror
into the hearts of the evil minded.
It all came about through the announce
ment made by the anarchists that they in
tended to hold a meeting in Trafalgar
square.
Such a thing could not be tolerated, said
the Right Hon. Heury Asquith, and be
promptly issued instruct! out to the police
ordering the chief commissioner. Sir Ed
ward Bradford, to take the steps necessary
to prevent the meeting from taking place.
The anarchists thereupon declared thetr
Intention of holding the meeting spile
of the authorities. They made good their
threat, too, for they gathered there, though
the four sides of the square w ere black with
police, mounted and on foot.
This display of force caused many thou
sands of people to flock to the neighbor
hood of Trafalgar square, aud the front of
the National gallery was soou so packed
with people that it was utterly impossible
for a vehicle to pass through the crowds
unless assisted by the mounted police. The
gathering of these crowds was just what
the nnarvhisu wanted, and it enabled them
to do more toward spreading their fiery
literature and tht -why ventilating their
dynamite doctrines ; Ian any meeting which
they could have held upon the square would
have done. Male aud female anarchists
mixed among the thousands of people as
sembled aliout the square and began hawk- I
ing anarchistic literature, which, owing to
the novelty of the situation, found a ready
sale among the people assembled.
Finally a large aud excited crowd of an
archists aud socialists collected inside the
square. Among them were noticed many
of the lower class of foreigners French
men, Germans, Russians, Spaniards and
Italians many of them wearing slouch
bats and red neckties, thus causing con
siderable excitement iu the neighborhood.
Nicol, the anarchist leader, was a promi
nent figure. The police by twos and threes
kept moving about the square, and thus
they compelled the anarchists to move on,
apparently determined that no addresses
should be made.
At exactly 10 minutes past 3, as if by pre
arranged signal, a number of anarchists
made a rush for the steps at the foot of the
Gordon statue, and one of their number
immediately began to make a wild address
to those who had rushed up to the steps
with him, but the anarchist orator had
hardly uttered his first sentence before a
number of policemen charged up to the
spot and dislodged the reds from the steps,
scattering them iu all directions in the
most lively manner.
Eventually the anarchists on the square-
became so demonstrative that a further
detachment of 50 policemen was sent to
the square, and with the officers already
there assembled they formed a double
cordon around the Nelson monument.
Shortly after the police made a determined
charge and cleared t he square.
Later m the afternoon a large body of
anarchists made a dangerous rush down
Parliament street with the intention of
reaching Scotland Yard, the headquarters
of the police, which was said to have been
left with only a small guard of policemen,
but the superintendent of the division of
police promptly dispatched a strong force
of mounted and foot police there, the
horsemen reaching that point before the
anarchists, aud with the assistance of the
police on foot the dangerous mob was scat
tered after much scu tiling.

husband acknowledged his wrong and of
fered to deed his first wife a farm and al
low her $100 a mouth for the support of

consented to do.

First la Importance Is tho Wllsoa BOl,
,'v but Them An Several Other Important
y Subjects, Including the Hawaiian Ques
tion, to Corns Bcfor Both Houses.
''Washingtox, Dec 4. Interest in the
resrular session of congress, which con
vened at high noon today, centers at the
bouse wing of the capitoi, where the new
tariff bill is on the way. An enormous
pressure for legislation of all kinds pub
lic and private, beneficial and otherwise
will exist from the first, but as soon as the
decks can be cleared the tariff bill will have
the right of way.
The extraordinary session showed the
purpose not only of eliminating the silver
question, but advancing the tariff problem
four months on the road to solution. The
Wilson bill will be introduced in the house
the latter part of the week probably
Thursday. On that day the 10 days al
lowed by the rule under which the tariff
bill was filed during the recess will expire.
The McKinley bill was not reported to the
house until April 16.
If the Republicans attempt to prevent
the reporting of the bill this week on the
ground that the 10 dsys allowed them
should not be deemed to have begun until
the Democrats of the committee furnish
the estimates of the revenue to be derived
from the bill, these estimates as yet not
having been completed, the claim can and
probably will be set up iu opposition that
the order under which the Republicans
were allowed the few days iu which to
make their report was a recess order, and
Its terms not having been complied with
the order failsat the opening of the regular
session and the stat us quo is restored.
Tariff Deficit, 60,000,000.
The estimates of the revenue to be de
rived from the tariff bill are completed and
will be submitted today. They, show that
the deficit tn the revenue on a basis of a
governmental expenditure of $550,01)0,000 a
year will be about $i5,000,000, which must
be raised from increased internal revenue
taxes or an income tax.
It is not probable that the tax on whisky
will be increased more than 10 cents per
gallon, which will increase the revenue
from this source 10,000,000.
Although it was at one time last week
practically decided in an informal way to
impose a tax on the incomes of corpora
tions aud legacies, there has been a change
of sentiment, and it appears almost certain
that a straight tax on individual incomes
over $5,000 will be recommended.
Even if the Wilson bill is reported this
week, it is not expected that the debate
can begin until next week. Realizing its
tremendous importance, the committee do
sires to give the members as much oppor
tunity to examine its details before the
debate begins as is commensurate with
prompt action. There has been some in
formal discussion among t he minority
members as to the conduct of the debate,
and the general disposition see met! to be to
allow two weeks for general de twite aud 10
days for debate under the five minute rule.
The holiday recess will probably begin
Thursday, Dec 21, so that if the tariff de
bate begins Dec 15 it caunot be completed
before Jan. U0.
Hawaiian Case Will Come tTp.
The proceedings tn the house this week
cannot be accurately forecast. It is expect
ed that the death of Representative O'Neill
of Pennsylvania, "the Father of the
House,' will be announced immediately
after the convening of congress aud that
an adjournment of both houses will follow
out of respect to his memory. It may be,
however that the announcement will be
withheld until after the reception and read
ing of the president's message. If it is not,
the message will be read on Tuesday. The
Torrey bankruptcy bill has the right of
way as soou as the preliminaries are over.
The general belief is that it will hold the
right of way until the tariff hill or some
thing else of more urgent importance ap
pears to antagouize it.
It may be that the Hawaiian affair will
cut some figure in the proceedings during
the week. A resolution willing for the pa
pers in the case is alnmsi sure to be intro
duced, and it might come up in still anoth
er way if the news from Hawaii, which is
expected via Auckland on the Tth, should
be of a sensational nature.
The urgency deficiency bill and the New
York and New Jersey bridge billv which
were left with conference reports pending
, when congress adjourned at the eud of the
called sessiou, will probably be disposed of
during the coming week. Iu addition to
the tariff many other mat ters will crowd
forward at the earliest possible moment
for consideration.

in football and will use their influence to
have the playing "rules amended so that
this Reason's rouh work will not be re
peated. The general sentiment at Yale
favors the immediate ami unconditional re

proved so hard on the eleven the past few

stands in readiness to join a movement to
thoroughly reform the present playing
rules.

Work Before the Semite.
Washington, Dec 4. The extra session
disposed of all the preliminaries generally
ueccssary at the opening of the long ses
sions; consequently there will be none of
the usual reasons why congress may not
begin business promptly upon convening
today. The commitiecs of both the senate
audthe house, having beeu appointed at the
bcKinuing of the extra sessiou, reported
many bills which are now on the caleudars
of the two houses and iu positiou to be con
sidered when it bhall be the pleasure of the
members to take them up.
There are between . and tw bills aud
resolutions on the senate calendar, so that
it can liegin legislating immediately after
the receipt of the president's message if
such course should be deemed desirable.
A large majority of the:; bills are of
minor importance and relate to private
pension and other claims gainst the gov
ernment for small aim-nut.-. These will
be disposed of with dispatch in a majority
of instances wheti taken up. Many iTf the
resolutions refer to subjects w hich were
incidental to the silver re km I bill, and
with that measure out of the way they
will in all probability be dropped.
There are, however, a lew lulls ot general
importance, such as Senator II ill's federal
elections bill, the bill reported by Senator
Voorhees to increase the circulating notes
of national banks. Senator Morgan's con
current resolution for the appointment of
joint committee of the two houses to
consider financial questions. Senator Stew
art's two resolutions the lirst for a com
mittee to inquire if any senators are stock
holders in national Imuks, and the second
relating to the independence of the co-ordinate
departments of t he govern ment;
Senator Peffer's resolution concerning in
terstate commerce and Senator Palmer's
regarding pensions to nonresidents.
It is impossible to say which, it any, of
these measures will be taken up during
the first week of the session. It is consid
ered probable that none of them will re
ceive as much attention as the Hawaiian
uuestion, which is not now before the sen
ate In any shape, but which is almost sure
to be brought before it in some way before
the close of the week.
It Is probable that a number of resolu
tions of Inquiry will be introduced asking
for all the papers in the case. Including the
instructions to Minister Willis, and there
will undoubtedly be a full discussion of
the entire subject if not during the pres
ent week, later in the session. The exact
shape in which this subject will come up
for consideration will depend somewhat
upon the portion of the president's mes
sage beating upon this question.
It Is also probable that there will be
some executive business during the week,
as there will be several recess appoint
ments to office to be confirmed.
Over a Score of Kicker Killed on the Grid
iron This Year.
At least 25 youni; men have been killed in
America and England while playing foot
ball this year aud lust, aud hardly a day
passes now that the name of a new victim
is not announced. At Delavan, Wis., Nov.
4. John Peterson, a mute, tackled one of
the Beloit team, fell heavily and died of
concussion of the brain in an hour.
A week later Hugh Sanssa, a student of
the College of the City of New York, while
running with the ball, was downed by half
a dozen of the Elizabeth Athletic club's
team, and his neck was broken. The same
day Addis Herrold of the Richmond (Ind.)
Y. M. C. A. was caught iu a scrimmage
and his skull fractured. Physicians pro
nounced him fatally injured. On Nov. 18
vmond Carew k1 Toledo fell with the
ball, the Adriau colU-o team formed
nvraiuiu ou iot or mm, nnd ne died a few
hours later from an injury to the spine.
Two other players were seriously hurt in
the same game.
At Farmington (Conn.) John White,
while plaving wit h l ale seniors, was
thrown with territic violence, other players
fell on him. and his body was paralyzed.
James F. O'Brien of Manhattan college
died in New York Nov. J4 from injuries re
ceived in a firottiall scrimmage Oct. 11.
Kobert ChriMy was killed at Wooster, O.
Nov. Malice apparently entered into
none of the above accidents, but in many of
the big college games this year players
have been brutally struck with the hst.
jumped ou and even bitten by memliers of
opposing elevens. Such wanton brutality
should be eliminated from the game.inthe
opinion of nil lovers of healthful, honest
sport.
A Very Remarkable Shooting Match.
In a recent match between J. A. B. El

a side, and the men shot at 1"0 pigeons
each. Class killed W and Elliott 03. The
