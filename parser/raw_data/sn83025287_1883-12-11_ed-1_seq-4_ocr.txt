Thebk is an opportunity now for the
Governor of Pennsylvania to call another
extra session. Tr,e last one lasted only
eleven month?, and several important
matters still need attention.
Secretary Folger is billions again and
oil' from duty, aad the unhappy Mr. New
is monarch of the vaults where the surplus
th it troubles Mr. Blnine is bagged up.
Folger is in such bad health that he might
as well resign, and he probably would if
he wore not too "bilious" to be willing to
gratify Arthur and Chandler to that ex
tent.
The loiter of Comptroller Roche, read
at the meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday, rehearsed a thrice-told
tale, and again the fact was demonstrated
that. St, Paul is the lowest taxed city of
any importance in the country. Much
iteration is required, it seems, to produce
vibration within "greasy" ears—and at the
best such a medium of understanding is
pervers?,
The legality of the subpoena that has
been hawked all over the world after x-
Senator Spencer is now clouded with
doubts of its lawfulness. Wylie, the great
star route judge, is befogged about it, and
asked for arguments. The fact is the
performance is one of Brewster's blunder
buss moves. Now they have got Spencer,
they don't want him, and take this method
to get the case off their hands.
Attorney General Bbewsieb appeared
before Judge Wylie in the Kellogg branch
of the star route trials, and his business
there was to ask for delay. He urged con
tinuance on the ground that his witness
Walsh was not present. Who knows why
he is absent but Brewster? If he had
wanted him thore ho could'have him. Kel
logg's lawyers were furious at the prop
osition of the Attornov General, but the
court said ha could not decide sO grave a
matter until he had slept a night on it. So
the farce goea on.
The Chattanooga Times meets the Re
publican charge that Mr. Carlisle was a
sectional candidate by compiling the fol
lowing list of southern papers, having con
siderably more than half the daily circu
lation of the south. The New Orleans
Times-Democrat, the New Orleans Pica
yune., the Memphis Avalanche, the Nash
ville American, the Chattanooga Times
the Atlanta Constitution, the Mobile Reg
ister, the Birmingham Aye, the Nashville
Banner, the Augusta Chronicle, and Con
stitutionalist, the Macon Telegraph, the
Richmond Dispatch and the .Houston Post
favored the selection of Mr. Randall as
speaker. This shows the humbug of the
"oolid south" charge most effectually.
Senator Edmunds decapitate! himself
j-eaterday, and, Mr. Anthony will become
President of the senate, although he is not j
andnever can be p3356339d of 1&3 pays'.
oii vigor to properly meet the require
ments of the position. It requires a oon
sideratl9 strain of imagination to place
this action up">n the groani of a compli
ment to tba "Father of th 9 Senate
whose porioJ of usefulness has long
passed. Moreover it is trifling with a
grave and important matter. In a.certain
contingency, always to be borne in mind
the President of the Senate becomes the
acting Executive of the nation, and should
tho emergency alluded to arise, Mr. At
thony is not now, if indeei he ever was, at
all qualified to occupy the station. There
is no greater humbug than the prevailing
sentimental ''Senatorial courtesy."
In the discussion that has arisen over
Mr.* Blame's surplus distribution scheme
nothing has come out of a more damaging
character than to find it cordially ap
proved by ex-Senator Pomeroy of Kansa?,
of whom it has been truthfully said, he
could talk virtue with more glibness and
practice corruption with greater , success
than any other man seen in public life for
many years. Pomeroy, who was one of
the Republican saints ten years ago, was
caught in the act of baying votes to se
cure his reelection to the senate. Such a
man would naturally snuff opportunities
for plunder in the Blame scheme of die
tribuiing the whisky.- tax, : . and nothing j
would give him greater glee than a chance
for a new "divide." What a Savory crowd
of vultures the adoption of the Jim Blame
•idee" would bring to the front. *^. v
AIiTUVIi, SURE AS FATE. r'*°~&.
The Republican National committee
meet at Washington to-morrow to choose a
chairman, to fix the time and place for
holding the nominating con
vention, and other business
appertaining to the nomin
ation for President. As the members of
tho committee have journeyed from their
homes to the capital they have been sub
jected to interviews directed chiefly to
inquiry concerning! the individual most in
I favor among the members of the party for
the candidacy. Summing these up
as a whole, the outlook i
is very decidedly in • tho
direction of C. A. Arthur. "Whatever of
i concentration there ie, and there seems to
be more than is usual at this distance of
time from Ihe sitting of the convention,
it is entirely upon Arthur.
Tlie stalwarts are understood to be a
unit for retaining the plan of representa
-1 tion operative in 1880, and decidedly op
posed to any increase in the number of
de-legates, which upon the basis of four
years ago is 820, requiring 411 to nomi
nate. The Southern States have 500 dele
gates, and these it is unequivocally stated
by . high stalwart authority, will,
every man of them, come up for
Arthur, and that .vis a basis so
strong that to secure the remainder is not
regarded as an impossible task by any
means. Those upon the inner circle count
seventy-two votes sure from New York,
which certainly simplifies the task. * Gov
ernor Foster, for some consideration, is
claimed as having pledged the vote of
Ohio, which brings to the Arthur forces
more than enough for the nomination.
Votes are claimed for him from Pennsyl
vania, Illinois, Indiana, lowa, Wisconsin
and Minnesota, to say nothing of the
eastern or New England states, from which
section it is claimed votes are already
pledged through Chandler and other ma
chine office holders.
The Half Breeds are reported to be in a
state of great perturbation and serious
alarm at the prospect. The redoubtable
Frye, of Maine, Mr. Blame's chief bottle
holder, and others associated with him,
bave devised a scheme to have the basis of
representation changed, to decrease that
from the southern states and increase that
of the northern states, in the hope that by
such a flank movement the Arthur column
may be weakened. This is esteemted to
be a Blame movement, and as the stal
warts have a majority of the committee,
the success of the scheme is not in doubt.
A day or two more and the strength of the
stalwart grip will show its full power. In
the language of a prominent stalwart
Republican, "there v>ill be no trouble
about ii. Arthur is going to be the nom
inee, sura as fate.".
UNADULTERATED CBEEK.
Mahone and Riddleberger ambled into
the Republican senatorial caucus yester
day, the most lovely, cheeky beings on
earth. As Senator Bntler is not paired
with Don Cameron, for the purpose of re
organization, these worthies hold the
the balance of power, and they propose to
use it for the purchase of patronage for
political use iti Virginia. It became
known early last week that a number of
Republican senators, including Edmunds,
Morril); Plumb, Ingalls and Hawley were
committed to the policy of retaining. the
present officers of the senate in order to
escape the odium of a disgraceful dicker
with Mahone. The two Virginia senators
stood off undertaking to dictate terms un
til it was absolutely apparent to them
that in the temper of an influential group
of senators their vaunted balance of power
was useless. So 'they come forward with
sweet and brazen protests of the most
ardent desire for Republican harmony—
Mr. Gorham too, finding himself beaten
comes into line and says he will not be a
candidate for secretary at the expense of
party harmony. So these pure patriots
shuffle their cards, play injured innocence
and rehearse in pathetic strains their tale
of the political situation in Virginia. Rid
dleberger, with an * audacity that would
blanche the swarthy cheeks of Satan,
speaks of the "disoonragemerit" of f^,e
negro voters at ','ue state eleCtiOn, but with
J?lv»per nature he says their courage would
return at 'the presidential election and
bring triumph to the Republican party.
The attrocious knave has the impudence
to make this statement to intelligent sen
ators, in .the face of the truth that
at the late election more negro votes were
cast in Virginia than ever before, that in
every instance where the brutal tactics of
Mahone and his cut-throat, repudiating
gang were bravely withstood, there was the
freest, fairest election possible. Despised
and contemned as they are, the Virginia
senators are upon the backs
of the Republicans and they cannot shake
them off. What their new tactics will
avail them remains to be seen, but that it
is merely a ruse to place their levies for
resources for the purpose of shameless
corruption is as apparent as sunlight.
They stoop to conquer, and thus place all
the better class of Republicans at a dis
tressing disadvantage. From this point
forward the Republican party must carry
M^hone, but its baok will be broken h-v
the viie and.loathsome burden.
BOOK NOTICES,
OUR CHRISTMAS IN A PALACE. By Ed
ward Everett Hale. Paper, 12m0., So cents.
Cloth $1. Funk & Wagnals, 10 and 12 Dey
street, New York.
It is unanimously conceded that Mr.
Hale has no superior in this country as a
writer of short stories. Those who have
read his later works, and especially this
one, will go farther and claim that he has
no equal. His humor is irresistible in its
freshness and refinement, and a. kindly
heart and teeming mind guide his pen in
a train of thought where both the child of
leisure and the busy man of the world may
find wholesome delight. The stories in
this book are distinct, each being com
plete in itself; but they are knit together
in an ingenious manner which we shall not
forestall the reader's delight by divulging.
Something better than this volume for
reading aloud '. by the fireside may be
written in the future; but it is certain that
the present cannot boast of it. A story so
delightfully told and so appropriate for
these stirring Christmas times, would cer
tainly be a welcome gift to any one,
The long promised new German paper
has just made its appearance in St. Cloud
—"Die Minnesota." The Times says: ''No
doubt Messrs. Stockemann &, Schilplin will
issue a spicy paper."
THE ST. PAUL DAILY GLOBE, TMESDAY MOKNIftG DECEMBER 11,1883.
CURRENT COMMENT.
r v The ablest views of the President's message
appeared in the Republican papers of the City
of Brotherly Love. Ihe : Philadelphia Times
speaks: "Though less juicy thun a jug, Mr. -
Arthur's message is not as dry as a powder
horn." Though more ''proper" the Press is
not on rappant, as it wore: To Chester A. Ar
thur, Washington, D. C: Your e:teemed com
munication of the 3d inst. is receded. W :
agree ■with you that the outlook for this great
and glorious countiy is exceedingly flattering
and that everything is lovely. Still we believe
you omitted an important item from the docu
ment in failing to assure Corgcess and the coun
try that Frank Hatton must go.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch delivers a stun
ning "left-hander" ia the following: If Mr.
Blaise never realized before that ho was out of
politics ho must have been convinced of it by
j the contemptuous reception given by his own
party to his pet proposition to divide tho whisky
tax among tho states. It has fallen "with a
dull, heavy thud." No one notices it. except
to give it a kick in pissing. It goes down to
oblivion with Blame's South American policy,
vi.d with the Mulligan record of this chronio
statesman."
The Steubenville (Ohio) Gazette is panic
stricken enough to t:;ke refugo in the cyclone
cellar. "The fact that 3lr. Carlisle comes from
the south," it cries, ''is too awful for anything.
With Mr. Carlisle leading tho Democrats in the
House and that bloody rebel Mahone, of whom
no one can speak well personally, as tho leader
of the Republicans in the senate wo suppose the
best thing we can do is to throw up our hands
an d let the False Prophet take the country.
The fiftieth anniversary of Cardinal McClos
key's entrance upon ecclesiastical life will oc
cur January 12, 1834. The clergy of the arch
dioceso of New York have taken steps to pre
sent him a memorial upon the completion of his
jubilee. The memorial is to be in the form of a
pulpit of white marble, to be placed in the ca
thedral. The total cost will be from $7,000 to
$1.0,000, of which sum $S,CCO has already been
subscribed.
The manufacture of new rubber overshoes
out of old ones is becoming an important indus
try. They are sent to the factories, melted,
and made up in the usual way. They look as
good ai any, but compare in durability to those
made from fresh material as shoddy cloth to
now woolen cloth. They are made mostly into
tho cheaper class cf goods. While the business
is scarcely a year old, there are over 500 tons of
old overshoes used in this way.
A cubiotjs case occurred in New lork the oth
er day, when a man was drowned without water.
An individual considerably under the influence
of liquor was seen to fall from the pier into' the
East river. He saved himself from being sub

the pier. His head did not go under water at
all, yet whan rescued he was found to be dead.
Although in co doing she has broken a rule |

should have married a rascal, to die wretchedly,
but adds that the episode was true history.
Postmaster General Greshah has been

The Michigan legislature never has a chap
lain, as the constitution of the state prohibits
any form of religious service in either house.
Evidently the framers of the constitution were
of the opinion that the legislative bodies could
administer the affairs of state without having
their work prefaced by stump speeches to
heaven.
At Cleveland, Ohio, a day or two since, a
railroad locomotive plunged into the river
through an open draw-bridge, and the fireman
was drowned. The same day the Connecticut

HE Bit RELIEF SOCIETY.
Yearly Meeting; Held at Zleu's Temple De
cember 9 th—Annual Report.
San day afternoon a meeting was held in
the Mount Zion temple, it being a yearly
meeting of the Hebrew Relief society.
H, S. Haas, president of the society, pre
sided. He opened the meeting with a
speech. He informed them that he was
elected last year president of the society
against his wishes, bat that having become
president of said society he made his mind
up to do all he could for the relief of the
poor. Daring the year three hundred
Russians had been provided for, who were
driven from their homes; they found shel
ter in this city through the assistance of
the president, with the aid of the liberal
contributions of the members -of the
society. Of the three hundred Russians
who have been provided with shelter, there
remained but six families who are sup
ported by the society at present; the rest
are all making a living for their families.
and a number of them have been able to
provide themselves with a homestead. Dur
ing the year 369 money orders were given
out amounting from $1 to $50; amount
received, 1,400; paid out, $1,270; balance
on hand, $130. Poor of all classes, men,
women and children have been helped, not
alone with money, bat with homes, fuel,
c othing and provision?, and employment
had been found for many. Mr. Haas has
found it a great trial in relieving bo many
i sufferers. Mr. Haas was again elected for
' the ensuing year by the unanimous vote of
all the members present.

BOABD OF EDUCATION.
A VERY TALKATIVE MESSIOyOF THE
HODV LAST AIGJn :
All Hie Members have Explanations to
Mate—The Question of a. Building Su
perintendent Raises a Wrangle—Person
»l Explanations Relative to iho Gutzlan
tots—School Faculties for St. Anthony's
Hill. .
The board of education held a meeting
last evening which lasted till eleven
o'clock. The amount of business trans
acted was not unusually great, but was of
that peculiar character that required a
good deal of talking. All the members
were present except one.
AMENDMENTS. t
Fcr some time the boards hasadvertisad
for certain changes to bo made ia the
manner of letting contracts. The proposed
amendments were very long and were read
by sections, and finally all that part re
ferring to contracts was adopted.
Another proposed amendment wa3 ad
vertised in regard to a superintend
ent of buildings and repairs. The object
or purpose of this part of the proposed
amendment is to make it the duty of the
board, at its regular meeting
in February of every . year,
to appoint .a superintendent
of buildings and repairs aDd fix his salary.
Ihe duty of the superintendent is to super
vise and superintend the erection and re
pairs of all buildings contracted for or re
paired by the board, to examine and in
spect all work done and material famished
therefor; to report all cases of non-per
formance, or mal-performanca of con
tracts, either in the erection or repairs of
buildings, or in the furnishing or delivery
of fuel, or other property or supplies.
This superintendent is to have no
authority conferred on him
by the board or by any committee, or
member of the board, or furnish any ma
terial for the school buildings.
The reading of these amendments was
followed by a long discussion, in which all
the members of the board participated,
during which all the difficulties the board
labored under, and bow it had been cheat
ed by other men who in years gone by bad
been appointed superintendents to over-
Bee the work of erecting school buildings,
the furnishing of supplies, etc.
During the discussion, or talk
the members very naturally
ran outside the record and talked of other
matters not directly under consideration.
In this way Dr. Murphy referred i- a gen
eral way to the faot that we had had super
intendents who did not know the C. 2 • ronce
between dry hard maple wood and pine
slabs, and continuing this train of thought
said the board had been cheated in the
measurement of wood The doctor used
thi3 language in a general way and applied
it to no one in particular. Mr. Don
ne'y, in replying to the doctor's
remarks wholly misunderstood them and
mistakenly applied em to the person
that is furnishiug the wood for the public
schools, and declared that the doctor had
stated what was not correct when he said
this contractor for wood did not give good
measure. As soon as Dr. Murphy could
get the floor he explained that he did not
say what Mr. Donnelly appeared
to suppose he said. He
wholly disclaimed such ' expression and
did not desire to be represented as mak
ing use of suoh a statement, but this did
not satisfy Mr. Donnelly, who still ap
peared to hold fast to the idea that the
doctor referred to the . present contractor
for supply iDg wood, which was not the
case.
Other members gave their views and all
had something in their minds against
these kind of superintendents. Some
wanted men who were architects, and oth
ers were opposed to architects, who, they
said, would walk around giving orders
in white ' kid gloves. These
members wanted a man as superintendent
of the construction of buildings that was
not too big to take hold and hang a door
or do any other little thing that needed
immediate attention, and that if attended
to in time would save a good deal of ex
pense, whijh would follow if neglected.
Mr. Harvey Officer did not want a man
who acted as superintendent to go around
puttying in glass' and attending
to 6uoh little things. That was
not the purpose of the amendment at all
and if such a person as had been indicated
was selected the purpose of the amend
ment would be wholly defeated. Ob a
vote being taken the matter of superin
tendent was referred back to the special
committee.
PLANS SELECTED.
The committee to whom was referred
the plans of the now buildings, reported
that it had selected tho plans of Messrs.
Gauge and Millard for the new buildings
proposed; also the plans presented by Mr.
Berlandi for the addition to the Hnmbolt
and river school, and the report was
adopted. H£|
THE GOTZIAS LOTS.
At a former meeting of tha board sever
al lots in what is called Biegel's addition,
that belonged to the late Adam Gotzian,
were purchased. Since that' statements
have been circulated that seme members
of the board made a profit out of the par
chase. Thin matter was brought up at the
meeting . held a week ago, and was
at that time referred to a
committee to investigate. Last evening
the subject was called up and a general ex
planation was made by all who were in
strumental in making the purchase.
Mr. Wilgus called on Dr. Sohiffmann to
explain, and in doing so took occasion to
state hia connection with the matter and
declared his willingness to make an affi
davit that he received no com
mission whatever, and had no
promise, or expectation of receiving
any from any source. He oourted an in
vestigation,
Mr. Officer declared (.hat he would not
vote for an investig^ ij- when no investi
gation was required.
Dr. Schiffmano finally took the floor and
stated that he should have done so before
but for the fact that other members of the
board had filled up the time with speeches
upon the subject so that he had no chance.
He explained about the committee con
sisting of himself, Gilbert and Wilgus, go
ing out to see the lots, and all
about the negotiations for the
property, and claimed that the lots were
good one?, very suitable for the purpose,
and exhibited a plat showing the location.
Mr. Gilbert also explained about the
manner in which the property was bought
and stated that no one had received a com
mission. He felt as Mr. Officer had ex
pressed himself, that there was nothing to
explain. The matter was accordingly
dropped.
thb PBurrraG.
A communication was presented from
H. P. Hall, secretary of the Globe Print
ing company, in regard to the award for
printing made at the last meeting of the
board. This paper suggested that in
favorably considering a bid seeming to be
the lowest a misapprehension occurred, as
the _ bid in question covered but a few
specified items and those of the class that
might be put at a minimum without Jo*?,
while by the limitation of specification the
opportunity was offered ! for charges for
printing without the check of a fixed con
tract. • The matter was referred to the
committee on supplies.
. MOKE SCHOOL FACILITIES.
Mr. Gilbert urged upon the members of
the board that the peoplo on St. Anthony
needed moro school facilities. Population
was extending oat on Grand avenue, and
throughout that whole section of country
to the western city limit?. The people out
ihere needed a large addition to the Web
ster ■ school, and a four-room j
building on Grand avenue. In his
opinion the Neil school building
was Deeded the least. Mr. Oppenheim ar
gued in favor of moving the Neil building
out on Grand avenue, where ha thought it
would be snffiuittnt for several year 3, when,
if required it could be replaced with a
large and satisfactory building. The mat
ter was finally referred to the inspector
from that ward.
MISCELLANEOUS.
The committee on supplies was instruct
ed to tender to Kenny & Hudsei $!
in full for their bill. .
It seems that i i the plans of the High
school, building stairs in one of the upr>sr
apartments were provided for, but nothing
was said about them in the specifications.
The contractor thinks he is not under any
obligation to put them in, and so the su
perintendent, -Mr. Millard, referred the
matter to the board,and this body referred
it to a committee consisting of Officer
Schiffman and Kerker.
The matter of a bell and lightning rods
for tho High school. was referred to'the
committee on High school.
The finance committee was instructed to
borrow $15,000 with which to pay the
teachers for the past month.
! The board then adjourned.
Meeting of the Board of Fire Com
missoners.
At the regular meeting of the board of
fire commissioners last evening, Mr. Dela
no, president, was in the chair and the fol
lowing business was transacted:
Commissioner Prendergast, of the com
mittee on houses and furniture, reported
that the furnaces and heating apparatus of
the New Central fire hall had been put in
and would be in readiness this morning.
Superintendent Jenkins of the fire
alarm telegraph reported that he had
placed a telephone in the house of the as
sistant chief. He was instructed to pur
chase one eighteen inch gong for $150, for
the Central Fire hall, and one fifteen inch
at $125 for use in one of the engine
houses. He was further authorized to use
thirty-foot fire alarm poles in the outskirts
of the district.
A number of bills connected with the
expenses of the department including
$300 for a horse and 493.93 for hose,were
proved.
It was decided to send the fonr-wheeled
hose carriage of the Minnehaha steamer
with her to her new West St. Paul resi
dence, and place the new four-wheeler with
the new steamer, which latter was con
tracted to be delivered here Dec. 16.
It was voted to purchase 1,500 feet of
new rubber hose, and to test the durability
of the life of hose by running it at the
most central steamer without the custom
ary cleaning.
It was voted to test a new invention for
a 'heater" on the new steamer, which
is ran with naptha in
stead of coal on which
a Minneapolis fire department engineer
has secured a patent and which is being
successfully and economically used on
several steamers in that city. On motion
this matter was referred to Commissioner
Palmer, committee on machinery, with
power to act.
The matter of the members of the fire
department wearing their entire uniform
whether on duty or off duty, excepting
when being in attendance on weddings
and funerals or engaged in work that

The Meteors.
The engagement of Evans, Bryant and
Hoey's "Meteor*," was inaugurated at the
Grand Opera house last night to a good
sized audience which was kept in a roar
ing good humor until the fall of the cur
tain. The performance is of the olio or
variety character, and the spe
cialty acts introduced are
I right, clever and entertaining.
The trouble commenced with an enter
taining sketch by Ed. and Maud Werner,
who introduced several bright songs and a
number of airs from familiar operas. The
vocal numbers were very enjoyable and
they were greeted with applause. Mr.
James F. Hal; followed with an amusing
character sketch, after which the French
twin sisters were introduced in their song
artd dance specialties. Their vocal per
formances were highly entertaining, and
as exponents of the light fan
tastic they are most graceful.
The musical mokes, Bryant and Hoey, then
treated tho audience to their enjoyable
musical sketch, ia which they extracted
music from everything from a pig's tail to
a cow bell. The cornet playing by Mr.
Bryant was especially artistic, and it re
ceived a couple of deserved enoores. Lit
tle Eva French gave a song and recitation
in a very tidy manner, when the Fletcher
trio were introduced in their fancy skat
ing act.
This was one of the most clever and en
joyable features of the programme, and it
is well worth peeing. They were the re
cipients of cordial applause. Conroy and
Dempsey followed ia their very amusing
specialties, consisting of songs, witticisms
and puns. They were recalled several
times and may consider themselves en
doriad.
The fun concluded »i!h a farcical
sketch called the "Bock -;rat." Jfr.
Chas. E. Evans impersonate -i it charac
ter, and as a manifestation c f frozan gall
it lays over.the deck. The sketch intro
duced a tramp, Chinamen, darkey and
several others who contributed to the fun,
which is like greased lightning. Mr.
Evans gets in his lace work in beautiful
ehap3 and the entire business is intensely
funny. The same bill to-night.
THE OHIO SESATOESHIP.
Darbin Ward Wast-, a Secret Ballot—
Payne's Cha&crs Improving.
[Special Telegram to the Globo.l
Cleveland, Dec. 10.General Durbin
Ward was in the city yesterday. He is
growing more confident of his chances to
£11 Senator Pendleton's shoes. Ward's
friends held a meeting in Columbus Thurs
day. The principal topic that was dis
cussed was the importance of having
a secret ballot. All those
who were present were strenuous
in the advocacy oi it. Some one in the
interest of other candidates has filled Dor
bin's ear with a cunning tala about the
advantages of a secret ballot, until he ac
tually believes that it is absolutely to his
interest to have a secret vote. The move
ment in favor of Henry B. L Payne contin
ues to grow in volume and force. It is
recognized by thoughtful Democrats
in all parts of the state
that he is the candidate
of the men who carried Ohio. It wat
claimed by some of the sanguine members
of Pendleton's household that Carlisle's
election as speaker would help their chief
but it has about as much to do with the
Ohio senatorial fight as the length of Ohio
cornstalks ha 3 with the price of butter in
Paris. ' .

[Special Telegram to the Globe.]
Washington, Dee. 10.— Friends of Rid
dlebsrger and Mahone says that their posi
tion is misunderstood with respect to the
reorganization of tho senate. It is a fact
that Butler, of South Carolina, is not
paired on the question of reorganization
| with Don Cameron. This will give Riddle
| berger and Mahone the balance of power.
But they are not disposed to use this
balance of power for the purpose of fore-
I ing upon Republican senators any can
didate for office who is not
acceptable to the Republicans. Nor is it
their purpose to cause any disagreeable
issues. Mr. Gorham, moreover, it can be
stated, upon good authority, does not wish
to be a candidate for the office of secre
tary unless ho can receive the cordial sup
port of the Republican senators, but there
is no disposition on his part to cause any
division in the party. Senator Riddle
bergerspeak3 confidently of the pros
pects of anti-bourbon success
in Virginia next year, and
says that Mahona is also confident. The
oolored Republican voters, who are more
easily discouraged in state elections and
more inclined to remain away from the
polls, act very differently at a national
election. "They as greatly fear the elec
tion of a Democratic president," said Mr.
Riddleberger, "as a protectionist does a
free trader, and it is not expected that
there will be any difficulty in bring
ing out the colored vote." He says, more
over, that if the northern Republicans
have misunderstood the result of
the last Virginia election, and that if the
returns are properly studied, it will be
seen that the white readjustee vote was
increased over the vote given for Governor
Cameron. There is no reason to think
that this increase will be lost in the presi
dential year and with the colored vote
there is good reason to believe in anti-
Democratic success.
THE NATIONAL BEFOBLIOAN CONVENTION.
Farther consideration of the plan of
Senator Frye for the restriction of repre
sentation in the National Republican con
vention from states which do not cast Re
publican electoral votes, shows that the
plan will not be adopted by the commit
tee next week. One of the active com
mitteemen said to-day: "Mr. Fry plan
ia in substance a modification of the plan
of Martin, of Kansas, which was voted
down at the last meeting of the
committee. There will be no purpose so
far as I can learn to modify the system of
representation. It is too late to do that.
Moreover, the changes suggested might
conflict with interests which we do not un
derstand. To restrict the representation
in the states indicated would be to put un
necessary limitations upon Republicans.
It would be to say that the Republican
vote in those states has reached its maxi
mum, and the Republicans need
not exert them3elve3 to do
any better. Moreover, if Arthur
is a candidate the south is the field where
he naturally would expect to secure dele
gates."
"Does the committee understand that
Arthur is a candidate?"
"I have no doubt of it," was the reply;
"and it will be the effort of Arthur's friends
to secure the convention in the east. That
appears to me to be the only real contest.
The choice thus far lies between Philadel
phia and Indianapolis. One hundred
Philadelphians are expected here
Tuesday. Arthur's friends are feeling
their way in New York to ascertain wheth
er, without any factional opposition, he
can secure the delegates there. We have
yet to hear the result. There seems to be
a disposition on the part of some of Ar
thur's friends who are opposed to the
Sherman influence to say, 'We have had
enough of the Ohio idea. Lot Ohio go.
We can carry New York and can elect a
president without Ohio.' So far as I
have observed in the west the
attitude towards Arthur is simply of tol
eration." *
John Sherman does not conceal his hos
tility to Arthur. There is much difference
of opinion among New York congressmen
as to Arthur's strength in New York. Sen
ator Miller is quoted as saying this: "Gen.
Arthur's weakness in his own state is very
great, and he cannot secure the delega
tion or any considerable part of it."
Mr. Miller's voice is for Blame and he be
lieves that Blame would get a? many of
the New York delegates as Arthur would
under the new rule of election by congres
sional districts. Frank Hiscock tells his
friends that in his district Blame is strong
and Arthur weak, and that Arthur cannot
get any delegates there. A Democrat re
presents the great Blame county of New
York, the Westchester district,
and word comes from there
that not Arthur but Blame delegates
will be elected from that district whether
Collector Robinson says yes or no to it.
It is very certain that if Arthur cannot get
the hearty support of the New York dele
gation he will not be a candidate. Some
of the committeemen are very confident
that Blame aspires to the nomination.
Some of his old friends speak earnestly
and openly in his favor.
"Is Logan a candidate ?" was a3ked of
the cornmitteeman.
"He undoubtedly is, but he does
not seem to be making any
organization. He, of course, expects his
own state and would undoubtedly get it,
although he ha 3 some strong opponents.
He would be apt to get some delegates
from the south, but I do not hear that he
is working for any."
CABINENT CHANGES. '
The renewed talk about changes in the
Cabinet has a two-fold origin. The ru
mors are founded in the desire of certain
politicians to secure the places, and in the
wish of many who have no candidates to
have the head of the department of justice
and of the treasury, active politicians. In
all the intrigues for the presidential nom
ination it is doubtful if either the secretary
of the treasury or the attorney general have
been taken into the confidence of the
friends of any of the leading candidates.
There are some things that indicate that
the president would be pleased to have
these offices filled with more active poli
ticians, but it is very doubtful whether he
has anybody in view. One we aid not be
I very rash to doubt all reports that he in
tends to remove them. It is pretty clear
that it is not for Mr. Wbarton Baker, of
Philadelphia, to issue the mandate that
Folger and Brewster must go.

Senator Edmunds was not present. The
following letter from him was received:
To My Republican Brothers:
Gentlemen: At the close of the last
session, when a large number of Republi
can senators-elect had no voice in the se
lection of the president pro tern, and when
none of those then in office re-elected
could be chosen for the place, you did me
a great honor to place me in that
office. I felt that had your range of
choice been as great as it now is, another
senator would have been your choice,"as
he would mine. The difficulties then exist
ing are now removed and I gladly hasten to
return to your hands, unembarassed, the
position of trust the senators imposed up
on me and I invite you to proceed to elect
another president pro tern. With grateful
thanks for the unsought proof of the con
fidence shown in me, I herewith wish to be
relieved. Faithfully your 3.
[Signed, Geo. F. Edmonds.
