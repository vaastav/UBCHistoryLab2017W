Ab AntC'Klectlen Message.
The very general and well merited
criticism upon the prcsldent'a message- U
that It la a very dull document, net
enlivened by nny original recommenda recemmenda recommenda
tleno, and consisting mainly of the com cem com
pllatlen of the reports of his secretaries.
It is better, of course, for a president te
aay nothing than te talk nonsense, but
from the ene who sits at the head of the
table In the oxecutlve council the country
is accustomed te leek forsemethlng fresh
it net Btartllng, though it Is by no means
certain that what Is novel Is always
meritorious. Mr. Arthur being a poll
tlclan, by Instinct and training, rather
than a atatesman.lt Is net te ueexpccteu
of him that he would go much further
than he docs, nor that In thlsmesssagc
en the ove of another presidential fac
tion, in which he Is a candldate-he
would commit himself with much te
merity en the questions which ngltate
the country and divide his own party as
much as any ether.
Our foreign rolatlens being entirely
amicable and devoid of sensational Inter
est, both In the roview of the pest year
and in Immediate prospect, the president
could easily devete nearly ene-half of his
message te our foreign relations wmieui
saying anything of great Importance cr
challenging contradiction.
As usual, Interest In the message cen'
trea In Its exhibit of the financial opera
tlens and condition of the government'
It shows that our receipts last year weie
ene hundred and thirty-four millions of
dollars In excess of the expenditures and
that most of this was applied te the
payment of the national debt, the rapid
extinction of which threatens a contrac
tion of the currency, an unsettling of the
national banking system and imposes
undue burdens upon the geuoratlen that
has already borne most of the war bur
den. Besides, the fact that very seen all
the national debt that Is matured will be
paid makes It certain that at the present
rate of taxation and revenue tlfbre would
accumulate within the next ten years
from three hundred and fifty te four
hundred millions of dollars in excess of
the requirements of the sinking fund and
the eiivment of all matured bends. Te
meet this exigency there must be a re
ductlen of taxation enacted or new
schemes of expenditure projected. The
president tries te avoid this issue ; he
retreats from the position he took last
year in favor of a reduction of taxation
and Intimates that the surplus money
might be profitably applied te strength
ening the sea coast defenses and the re
habilltatlen of the navy. As the country
has been sickened by the profligate
expenditures upon naval affairs during
many years of Republican maladminis
tratien, this recommendation of the
president will likely meet with little
favor ; it will euly recall the fact that
Mr. Arthur's naval .secretary is Win E.
Chandler and that he Is "sly."
The president's recommendntlen of a
reduction In postage en diep letters, in
accordance with the reduction en ether
matter, Is sensible, nnd there ia little in
his treatment of the miner subjects' of
bis message te excite special cemmenda
tien or criticism. He handles the civil
service reform very gingerly ; and like-
wlse the civil rights question. His
appeal for nntl pelygamic constitutional
amendment is a confession of the failure
ofallprevlous Utah policies, and tnay
suggest a sentimental issue for discussion
lu Congress aud in the next presidential
campaign.
Tlie Uorerner's Vete.
Governer Pattison's veto message
afforded very entertaining reading te
everyene except the members of the
Legislature, who cannot be supposed te
have found very much satisfaction in it.
It is net surprising that thy disap
proved and proceeded at once te p.is3 the
appropriation of their ten dollars a day
for every duy of the session, by the
necessary two-thirds majority. Yet they
would have been wiser it they had con
cluded te go without their money. The
governor's position that they did net
earn anything, slnce they did net de the
ene thing they were assembled te Je, and
whlcti the constitution required them
te de, will undoubtedly ba very
acceptable te their constituents, what
ever doubt there may ba as te the
strength of its legal foundation. The
members of the Legislature may claim
that they are entitled te be paid, under
the Jaw, for the time they nre In session,
and that they cm no moie beiequlred
toagree te npportienmeut bills which
they cannot appreve than a Jury can he
compelled te bring In a verdict when
itsmerabers cannot satisfy their judg
ments with ene. The force of the reus
enlng from this comparison would be
much'greater if the Jury sat six months
deliberating en a verdict, failed te agree,
and then proceeded te reacli a icady
agreement in voting themselves ten del
Iarsa day for their Bessien.during which,
moreover, they had enjoyed frequent vu
catiens from their duty.
Senater Coxe conslders that thu gev
erners dectrine that the Leglslatme
should net be paid until It has passed
the npportienmeut bill is a very danger
eus ene, slnce practically It Is saying te
the venal members that they cau make
the two thousand dellata, which is nearly
the accumulation of their pay, by voting
for a bill which they de net approve.
The governor's position risks thlsdanger;
but as the members had it In their
power te pass the appropriation bill
ever bis veto, it proved rather te
be a possible than real danger.
Aud it can hardly be expected that If the
governor had n right te say that the
Legislature should net be paid, the dan
ger resultlng from his exercise of his
prerogative, due te the venal character
of certain legislators, oeuld net be ex.
pectedtodeterhlm,
The message is certainly entirely
unique among state papers. Ne Legisla
ture state or national, has ever bofero
been addressed with such frank nnd
severe expression of exocutlve disappro
val. There is no escape from the con
viction en the part of any outslde the
Legislature that jje much at least of the
denunciation as was Ylslted upon the
appropriation of ten dollars a day, for
days when no sorvlce was rendered, is
entirely just. Tiiore are a number of
members who voted for the appropria
tion of a sum sufficient te pay evcry
member ten dollars a day for evcry day,
who de net themselves Intend te take
compensation for days when the wert
net In attendance , but they have given
less scrupulous members an opportunity
of which they will avail themselves te
take such compensation : and there is
ue Justification for their opening the
treasury te unscrupulous plunderers.
The resistance which the governor has
effered te tills raid will certainly meet
with public favor ; aud the Legislature
will fake Its money.loaded with a weight
of popular disapproval, which will make
It a heavy burthen Indeed te such as care
for public oplulen.
A? Is generally the cue, the report of
the secretary of the treasury Is a mere
interesting, comprehensive nnd valuable
document than the president's message.
Ile deals at length with the question of
revenue, taxation and public expenditure
which 13 at once the leading issue before
the country, the one of greatest concern
te Its material interests, the most com
plicated aud that upon which all parties
are divided. It is curious te note the
wide divcrgonce of views between the
president and his financial secretary.
While the former, true tetliefundamen
tal principles of his party, rejoicing in
large revenues and lavish expenditures,
declines te recommend any material
diraunitlen of taxation, Secretary Pel.
ger unquestionably favors abolition of
the tax en fermented liquors, and a low
erlng of the duties en sugar, molasses,
and ether articles of general consump
tion. These who have net read the president's
uie& go are iu a big majority.

tion $1,130,321.
The secretary discusses the disposition
of the trade dollars at considerable length
and recerameuds that they be called in at
their nominal value ami melted. In sup
p rt of this recommendation the secretary
peiuts out that the reading of the law
which etiumeratcd the trade dollar among
the silver coins of the rutted States, tlxcd
its weight aud tlnencss and made it a crime
te counterfeit it taught the people that
the trade dollar was a coin of their sov
ereignty and for the redemption of which
at an unabated value the government was
bound. The whole issue of trade dollars
was 835, 900, 1 10, but it is estimated that a
large proportion of the issue has been
melted up, from cue te two millions having
disappeared in manufactured articles, and
many millions having geno te the crucible
In China. The secretary proposes te
redeem tha trade dellara with standird
dollars and show hew it may ba done
without aey dangerous inflation of the
currency.

On November 1, 1S83, thore wero iu

ever all firmer ye.irs Itotures made en
October '2 of thu ear Uew an aggrogate
natuual bank capital of 8509,099,737. an
mcrease of 820,593,731 during the jear ,
a circulation of $314 931,575. u surplus of
$102,000,432 and individual deposits of
81,019,437,700, bith of which are m do de do
creaio ; leans of 81,303 HO, 700 and i-pecie
of 8107,917.053, both of which are aa in
crease. Tbe national banks held, as
security for circulation, 8332,577,300 of
United States bends, a rednctien of
89.G13 350 during the year. Taey held
8201,327,730 of United States 3 per cent,
bend as a baiis of eucuhtieu. All of the
Ititer are likely te be called for ptyment
dartug the next four or llve years, unless
the surplus revenue cf tlie country in dis
missed. There is little or no profit
en circulation based upon 1 and I J
per cent. beuJs nt the present
premiums therefer. A continued
paymeut of the 3 per cents, will probably
result in a Urge reduction of tlie bank
circulation, unless oemo counter stimulus
is applied. The secretary discusses this
subject nt great length, Dturtiug with the
asnmptien that thu national banking
system is lekM upju with favor by the
gieater part of the people, and that there
is almost a umveihal desire te coutinue the
circulation of national bank nves as a
convenience and beneflt that would net
well be dispensed with. He recommends
that the internal revonue tax of 1 per cent,
per annum be taken oil and that the banks
be .illewcd te circulate 00 per cent", upon
the average maiket value for twelve
months prier te the deposit of the United
Statm benda deposited ou security, enab
ling a bank te eb'aiu circulation en the
premium paid for bends as well an upon
the par value of thein

The Boeretary says thore is likely te boa
continuing surplus iu the treasury se long
as the present revonue laws remain and
notices two prepositions for the disposal
of the surplus. What is known as the
Wharten Darker plau te parcel it out
among the stale-', hu says, has net se ap
proved Itself te the common hoiike of the
peeple as cow te call for olaberato statu
ment of reasuiis why it sheulu net be
adopted nnd adds that it is net a lcgitiraate
function of the federal government te ralse
meney uy taxation te be denated te the
states ei te thus me muney already raised
mthatwiy. The ether preposition he
neticru Is or a payment from the surplus te
certain of the states which have net had
their full propjrtien et meney under the
distribution act of 183fi. The soerotary
dismisses this preposition by showing that
the distributiea of 1830 was in the nature
of a lean, of which ropaymeut could be
demanded, u'-d sayu that the custom has
been te iibe the sutplus iu the reduction el

In the Senats
Tue Seuate did nothing all day except
te take recesses and await tlie action of
the Heuse. The chamber wm thronged.
Senater Coepar read a speech in oppesi
tiea te tlie governor's obieatiens. which he
Lsaid wero pitiful in their Iittlouess ami
outrageous iu their suggestion. The
dectrine that logisIateMshould be paid for
bills passed wm felly. The veto assailed
the indopendonco of the Legislature anil
stultified the previously expresscd viens
of the governor. Coxe disputed the riRht
of the governor ta critlcise a corerdinato
branch of the government and he decliued
te be puuished by any master exeept the
peeple. Le said the governor's dectrine
was dangerous ; that he had no rijrht te
say whother the work of the legislators
was worthy of pay. It was revolutionary.
The govorner bad made a sordid appeal te
a ba?e passion. Gorden replied te Loe's
speech. He claimed that the Legislature,
having failed ta execute a mandate of thu
constitution, w.-u net ontitled te pay. The
vete did net say that the measure of work
was the measure of my, but that the act
of 1974 was intonded te pay legislators who
obeyed net tbe govorner but the constitu
tion. Humes, Haas, Greer, Patten, Ken Ken
uedy and Davis speke against the veto and
Laird for it. The Senate then pawed the
bill evor t! e governor's vete by 37 te 4
