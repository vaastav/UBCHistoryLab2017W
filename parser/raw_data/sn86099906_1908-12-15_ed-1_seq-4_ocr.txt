NEGRO SOLDIERS
WHO CONFESSED
JEESSAGI3 TO CONGRESS
BROWNSVILLE MATTER.
ON
Recommends Reinstatement of Sol-
diers Who Revealed Truth About
Outrage at Brownsville Boyd
Connors Investigation Reported.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 15. Based
upon the investigation by Boyd Con
nors of the outrage committed at
Brownsville by soldiers of the'25th
Infantry, President Roosevelt today
sent a special message to the senate
bearing upon the subject of the re
instatement of members of the Pen
rose battalion in the army, in which
he recommends that those men who
originally held back information
showing the guilt of their comrades,
but who have since divulged the
truth, be reinstated in the army. The
message declares that the investiga-
tion shows that practically all of
I Companies C and D had knowledge
' r T Vi ottn rlr r rt tYt n ttwtm q 1 tli rt frVi
VL VU i I'll ,Jtlit UltUUU)U
these men denied any such knowledge
at the time of the first investigations
of the affair. Recommendation is
made by the message that the secre
tary of war be empowered to rein
state within a year such of the dis
charged soldiers as he may find
worthy. The report of the Boyd
Connors investigation is sent to the
senate with the message.
Wanted Something Quicker.
Some few years ago I issued a pol
icy on the life of a man who was far
from being a model husband. I called
for the premium every -week and rare
ly get it without a grumble from the
wife. The last time I called she said:
"I ain't going to pay you any more.
There's Mrs. Smith only had her old
man in M.'s society three months, and
he's dead, and she's got the money
I'm going to put my old man in that,
so you needn't call again." Liverpool
Mercury.
Falling In Love.
I do not doubt that as the world goes
on a deeper sense of moral responsibil
ity In the matter of marriage will grow
up among as. But it will not take the
false direction of ignoring these our
profoundest and holiest Instincts. Mar
riage for money may go, marriage for
rank may go, marriage for position
may go, but marriage for love, I be
lieve and trust, "will last forever. Men
In the future will probably feel that a
union with their cousins or near rela
tions is positively wicked; that a union
with those too like them In person or
disposition is at least undesirable; that
a union based upon considerations of
wealth or any other consideration save
considerations of immediate natural
impulse is base and disgraceful. But
to the end of time they will continue to
feel in spite of doctrinaires that the
voice of nature is better far than the
voice of the lord chancellor or the
royal society and that the Instinctive
desire for a particular helpmate Is a
surer guide for the ultimate happiness
both of the race and of the individual
than any amount of deliberate consul
tation. It Is not the foolish fancies of
youth that will have to be got rid of.

Knew the Sound of Wood.
There was an argument on a cricket
field in a village near Nottingham,
England, which interrupted the game
for some time. The match was being
played between the local tradesmen
of the village. All went well until
the bowler, who was the village non
stable, a man over sis feet tall, sent a
ball which bumped up from the
ground and hit the village butcher,
who was batting and who was ex
ceedingly fat and perspiring freely, on
the head. The wicket keeper, a re
markably thin and agile man, who
was the village grocer, caught the ball
and yelled, " 'Ow's that?'
"Hout!" shouted the village baker,
who possessed only one eye.
"HI say now!" roared the fat butch
er, who refused to have it so. "But
hit 'it me on the 'cad."
"Hi don't know where hit 'it you,"
responded the umpire, who was the
village undertaker, "but Hi knows the
sound of wood when Hi 'ears hit, so
hout you go."
The Tricksters.
"Political tricksters always give
themselves away," said a congress
man. "Their methods remind me of
the two men who wanted to sell their
corpses for dissection. These two men,
miserably clad, called on the dean of
a medical college in New York.
" 'We are both on the verge of star
vation, sir,' the spokesman said. 'We
are well on In years, and it is clear
that we haven't much longer to live.
Would you care to purchase our bodies
for your dissecting room?'
"The dean hesitated.
"'It is an odd proposition,' he mut
tered. "'But it is occasionally done,' said
the spokesman in an eager voice.
"'Well, said the dean, 'we might
arrange it. What price do you ask?'
'"Over in Philadelphia,' said the
spokesman, 'they gave us $40.' "New
