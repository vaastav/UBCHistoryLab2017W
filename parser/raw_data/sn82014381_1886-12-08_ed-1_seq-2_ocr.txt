THE MESSAGE.
The President's message is a straight
forward State i>a]>er. There is neither
concealment nor ambiguity about it. Par
tisans can have no difficulty whatever in
understanding precisely the policy he fa
vors for the country. On questions, there
fore, relating in any way to the tariff; or
touching the silver debate, there is no ne
cessity for any discussion, since he reiter
ates views which he has consistently main
tained. These matters will quite sufficiently
al>sorb public attention when they are
taken ap by Congress.
Very largely the manage i; occupied
with synoptical presentation of the facts
reported to the Executive by the several
departments. These are exposed dearly,
nnd the sum and substance of the most
important will thus be more widely dis
seminated among the reading public than
could be expected if the people were re
ferred to the extended department reports.
However much there may he of division
of sentiment upon the means proposed of
narrowing the surplus revenue, there \fi\\
be general approval of the presentation of
the subject to the people as one of fore
most importance. He commends the.sug
gestions of the I'ostniaster-General for di
rect service with the Argentine Republic
—a need that is felt keenly by our com
mercial business ; for the extension of the
free-delivery system, and that there l>e
pursued no mistaken policy of economy in
securing every postal need the interests of
the people and of trade demand, since
even postal outlay from which no money
return to the Department can be reasona
bly expected, may prove the very stimu
lant our foreign trade most needs.
He speaks a good word for prison reform,
so far as United States prisoners are con
cerned, who are now confined in nearly as
many prisons as there arc Stales. He cor
rectly argues that reformation will he fur
thered, and prison discipline l>e madeinore
Si i.il t<i the prisoner and the interests
ni society, and the government of the Ke
pnblic be better conserved by the segre
gation of the prisoners of the United States
from all other classes, and their .subjection
u> uniform discipline.
TJie argument is strong which lie pre
sents — and which lias l>een advanced
under previous administrations—against
further recognition of the Indian trilK'^;ts
foreign powers, and in favor of bringing
the Indian under the direct operation of
the laws,and holding him amenable to the
rt possibilities, :is well as entitling him a
recipient of the benefits of our system, just
a- rapidly as civilizing influences fit him
for such :i condition. This journal has
long held that there should be
legislation tending to the individual rec
ognition of the Indian and the abandon
ment of tribal distincKon in dealings of
the Government with the remaining
aborigines, since they are now so hemmed
in by cmlitttien that it is the bight of
inconsistency to hold.then aloof as petty
nations, rjther than treat them as wards
of the Government to be fitted into the
economy of our system by training, educa
tion, and firm bat kindly discipline in Ihe
industrial arts of peace.
The recommendations of the Depart
ment of the Interior ne approved, looking
to better protection of public lands, and
the more faithful devotion of the same to
the interest* of tetrad settlers, as well as
guarding them from niflM*>poliz,ition in
l:uvo tracts Iv few persona
The President with some warmth de
fends his coarse regarding sped*] pension
legislation, disclaiming anvdesin to limit
in tin' least just recognition of meritorious
service by the defenders, in the field, of
tliis great Bepuldie. Hut lie insists upon
justice being 'lone the deserving without
yielding to the claims and political influ
ences of those who seek for unjust discrim
ination.
The payment of the claims of the Gov
ernment against the Pacific Railroads he
advises -houlci be secured according to a
policy that will most certainly assure the
payment of principal and intere.-t, and to
that end the suggestions of the Secretary
of the Interior are approved.
A timely reminder is interjected in the
consideration of the 'ainjr question, that a
lit spirit >liou!il be cultivated by both
capita] iimi labor, and the antagonism that
cripples them be avoided, by the cultiva
tion of the true Americiu sentiment that
recognizes the brotherhood and equality of
American citizenship, and lives to highest
purpose in loyalty to our institutions.
The civil service laws and regulations
are approved, their necessity and useful
ness defended with vigor, and their opera
tion cited as the best evidence of their
wisdom. In defense of the system, he de
clares it to be his conviction that if the
people of this country ever submit to the
banishment of its underlying principle
from the operation of their Government,
they will abaDdon the surest guarantee of
the safety and success of American institu
tions. This positiveness and warmth on
the part of the President will greatly en
courage the friends of the reform, and
ought to stimulate our loyalty to the sys
tem.
Generally the message discloses our for
eign relations to be satisfactory. The hope
is expressed—fortified by the statement
that China will probably meet us half
way—that there will be a speedy settle
ment of the vexed Chinese question, by
which the desirable limitation upon Chi
nese immigration will be attained.
The promise is made of clear exposition
at an early day of the position of the Ad
ministration u|>on the fisheries question in
the light of negotiations pending, looking
to a satisfactory settlement. The Presi
dent wisely and firmly advises the continu
ance of reciprocal relations with the Ha
waiian Government, and in so doing meets
the l>est commercial sentiment and wisest
thought of the Pacific coast. He recom
mends the extension of the present treaty
relations, and the retention of the advan
tages they give us, in what he happily
terms " this outpost of American com
roeree." As was to have been expected
this recommendation has already met with
the disfavor and sneers of influences that
have*a selfish liusiness interest in disrupt
ing a relation so advantageous to the trade
of the Pacific.
We are inclined to think the President
has given undue importance to the Cutting
episode, but the sentiment expressed that
the Government should be extremely jeal
ous of the rights and liberties of American
citizens ' abroad, will be applauded.
Nothing gives more of character and dig
nity to a nation, than its boldness and
firmness in guarding sacredly the persons
and property and the civil- rights of its
citizens in foreign lands.
I'pon the subjects of the financial condi
tion of the country, the state of the public
debt, the extradition and copyright ques
tions, reciprocity with Spain and some
other subjects dwelt upon, it is not neces
sary at this time to comment. As a whole,
the message is a temperate and dignified
document, too long for popular reading,
probably, but clear and incisive, and leav
ing the country in no doubt concerning the
policy to which the Chief Executive ad
heres.
THE STOCK DEAL.
The crash of failing stock broker con
cerns in San Francisco is the one sound of
the hour. No clear-headed business wan
expected anything less than disastrous col
lapse to follow close upon the heels of the
stock gambling craze. The "boom" in
mining stocks began without any good
business reason whatever. Beyond the
fact that in one Comstock mine a new
working level had been abandoned and an
old and neglected one reopened, there was
nothing whatever to warrant the sudden
inflation of values. The real value of the
mining property on the Comstock lode re
mained the same after the boom began as
before, only the fanciful price, which is no
value, registered any seeiaing appreciation
of worth. Yet, knowing this fact, know
ing that there had been no new discoveries,
no uncovering of ores warranting the send
ing of the stock of any mine on the road
to par value, thousands of people rushed
in and purchased for a still greater rise. A
few shrewder or less confident than the
nmgneo sold while the fever heat prevailed,
and realized small fortunes. Hut in every
such case some other and many others suf
fered, or are to suffer by reason of the
gains of the few. In fact the sum of hu
man misery is augmented far beyond any
thing indicated by the mere financial loss.
For in hundreds of cases the mania to
reap rewards disproportionate to invest
ment, led to the pouring into the maw of
the devouring monster of gaming the hist
farthing; to stripping the home of even
the necessaries of life in order to procure
means to lay upon the altar of legalized
theft. For it is clear most largely
the methods employed in stock gaming
fall nothing short of theft. Take these two
cases, and let the distinction be pointed
out if possible, by the most acute logician.
A is employed by B in the transaction of
his business as a clerk er cashier. While
acting in that capacity, A takes from his
employer's vaults sums of money, and con
verts them to his own use. The Courts
decree A to be guilty of embezzlement,
which is but another term for larceny, and
BO A is properly put into the regalia of a
thief and sent to a State Prison to expiate
his crime. But B employs Cto purchase
for him certain stocks then for sale in the
market at a given price. But C, instead)
retains the nioue*, and when somewhat
later B calls for his stock, or directs that it
be sold, (' inform! him that he is unable
to comply, and has suspended payment.
That is to say, he him pocketed the money
of his client, never having invested a cent
of it in the certificates of value. The case
is no different where the purchase is made
upon a margin : that is, the client advances
each and the broker agrees to use liis
credit to purchase a certain number of
shares. Tiic sto^k falling to a point below
the margin, the broker may pocket what
ever he receives of the client, and agmfteb
more as he can induce him to put up to
keep his supposed margin good. The
world knows that not in three cases in ten,
possibly in so few cases as to make it phe
nomenal, is there actual purchase of the
stock ordered. Hence it is that we see
statements made of suspension, in which
the bankrupt firm or broker lists bis liabil
ities to his clients at the valuation of the
stock at the hour of suspension, but his as
sets contain no memoranda of the property
of the client supposed to be in the pos.
session of the agent. However the Courts
and the law of the street may construe
these as " busiuaß " transactions, they
never can be made to stand the test of
good morals in the court of human judg
ment, that demands of the employe or
agent that he shall actually purchase and
hold ready to deliver that which he baa
undertaken to do.
The Alia says, editorially, it "don't
think baptism hurts anybody." Has its
editorial head tried it?

Henry George's Reply to Corrigan—
An 1 '.astern Blizzard—A Girl-
Slayer to be Hanged.
I SPECIAL DISPATCHUS TO THE EECOED-CNION.J
A I..YHOK OF WEEKS.
Henry George's Weak Keply to Arch
bishop Corrigan.
New York, December 7th.—Henry
George, late Labor candidate for Mayor of
this city, has addressed an open letter to
Archbishop Corrigan, of the Catholic dio
cese of New York, in reference to the re
cent pastoral letter by the latter, in which
he took occasion to warn his people against
the land theories of George. Nearly all of
the letter in reply is devoted to contro
versal discussion of George's well-known
theories on the question of private owner
ship of land. Aside from that, the most
significant part of the letter is as follows :
"That part of your pastoral to which I
refer has been taken by the press as placing
the Catholic Church in the attitude of a
champion of private property in land, and
is certainly calculated to create the impres
sion that the doctrine that all men have
equal and inalienable rights to use this nat
ural element, is opposed to and condemned
by the Catholic faith. Since I am not a
Catholic it might seem hardly befitting in
me to deny your right, as an" Archbishop,
to clothe your political and economic opin
ions in the garb ot official religious teach
ing ; but I may perhaps be permitted to
call your attention to the fact that such
right has been expressly denied by high
Catholic authority, and to the further fact
that the very opinions which you officially
stigmatize as opposed to Catholic
teachings are openly avowed, not
only by Catholic laymen and priests, but
by prelates of official dignity not inferior
to your own. Perhaps, also, I may be per
mitted to observe that the quotation you
make from the Encyclical of Pope Leo
XIII. in nowise bearsout the interpretation
you put upon it. Instead of condemning
as a dangerous theory the doctrine that
human rights to the use of land are equal,
it on the contrary condemns only those who
assail the right of property which is sanc
tioned by its natural law,"and Ihis restric
tion, which excludes land, is still further
enforced by the Pope's characterization of
the property of which bespeaks—a charac
terization that dearly applies only to that
species of property which is the result of
human exertion."
WORK OF THE LEAGUE.
Boldnen of Dillon's and O'Hiien's Utter
ance s.
New York, December Bth—a. m.—The
Tribune's London special says: Two features
of the Irish situation are thesudden energy
with which the National League plan of the
campaign is developing and the alarm which
Dillon and O'Brien's proceedings cause
among the English Liberals, O'Brien's ex
cursion to Cork was signalized by a re
markable speech, and an open declaration
of the method by which he means to bring
the landlords to terms. The most ingenious
part is perhaps that by which all the costs
incurred by the tenants in resisting evic
tions are to be paid out of the rents in the
hands of the trustees. Dillon goes still fur
ther, and threatens vengeance.whenevertbe
Parnellites come into power,on those bailiffs
Judges and police who now execute the
law. This is what startles the English
Liberals. The Daily Xeus appeals to Dillon
to withdraw his threats, and urges the
Nationalist party to repudiate them. "If
he does not, the English Democracy," says
this journal, " will never subscribe to the
policy of revenge." Archbishop Walsh's
complaint about jury-packing has been
speedily followed by what the Pall Mull
Gazette considers the vindication of the
Castle authorities. The Protestants and
Catholics qualified to act as jurors are
nearly equal, and their numbers on the
panel are also nearly equal.
Workinginen Organizing.
PiTTSBiRii, December 7th.—The Commer
cial Gazette is aulhority for the statement
that a National Tariff Association is being
formed among the workingmen of the
country. By the time the Presidential
election of 1888, it says, thousands of clubs
will be in existence in the North and five
of the Southern States. The organization
was started in Tennessee. Georgia and
Alabama. In the coming year organizers
will be placed in the field iii Virginia and
West Virginia. These are the only Southern
States in which the fight will be made. In
the North each State will be canvassed. In
Massachusetts an organizer has already
been appointed, and clubs will be organized
in every town and village. State organiza
tions are being placed in other Northern
States. The organization will in no way
antagonize the Industrial League of Phila
delphia, or the Protective League of New
York, while it is to be entirely independent
of either.
Decision In a Railroad Case.
Chicago, December 7th.—Judge Gresharu
rendered his decision in the now famous
Wabash Receiver case this afternoon, in
the suit of the bondholders of 1877 and
1579 for the foreclosure on a!J lines of the
Wabash system east of the Mississippi
river, and also Beers' bill for the foreclo
sure of the mortgages on the Chicago di
vision. Grcsbam gave a lengthy opinion,
reviewing the whole case from the time the
receivers were appointed in 1884 to date,
together with the lease by the Wabash
Company to the St. Louis and Iron
Mountain Company, The Court held that
the mortgages should be foreclosed and the
present receivers removed. Leave v;as
therefore given to the mortgage bondhold
ers to file a bill in the United States District
Court at Springfield asking for a receiver
(or the property. It was held that the ap
plication for the appointment of a receiver
for the Chicago division of the system
could be filed here, and would be enter
tained. They were, it was held, entitled
lo such receiver, and that their case, from
the showing made, was good.

supporting Mrs. Rice's story of last Friday,
and emphatically declared that there is rio
truth in Wilson's story. They both say in

with Mr. Blame's production.
The Eastern Blizzard.
Boston, December 7th.—The wind-storm
here has lasted all day, and lias been ac
companied by a heavy "fall of snow, which
has interfered seriously with travel in the
streets. It is feared that many disasters
have happened at sea, especially as the
Signal Service gave no warning of the ap
proach of the storm, and signals were not
ordered up until the storm was here in full
force. On Cape Cod the wind attained a
velocity of fifty miles an hour. The storm
seemed to approach from the ocean, and in
some respects is one of the most remark
able ever known on this coast.
The Milwaukee AnarchUtg.
Milwaukee, December 7th.—To-night
the jury in the riot and conspiracy case of
Paul Grottkan and Albert Moessenger re
ported that they could not agree, after bal
loting for twenty-four hours, and were dis
charged. It is said the jury had decided
to acquit Moessinger, but as the latter had
been jointly indicted with Grottkan, an
acquittal for one and a disagreement as to
the other could not be rendered.

Seminole Indians in the everglades are
said to be putting on their war-paint, on
account of the way they are treated by a
band of white men who have a camp near
Lake Okechubee. The white men for sev
eral months have been killing hogs and cat
tle of Indians'. Shots have been exchanged
several times between the white plunder
ers and the Seminoles, and settlers have
become so alarmed that many have moved
their families to the islands on the coast.

CANADA.
The Fisheries Oneation.
Toronto, December 7th.—A special dis
patch from Ottawa to the Mail, the Govern
ment organ, says it is not the case, as ca
bled from London, that the Dominion
Government has sent an agent to Washing
ton to assist in negotiating a fisheries
treat}', nor has it modified its demands or
claims in any way. Canada stands on the
basis of the treaty of 1818, and is quite
satisfied to remain there for the present.
While favorable to a renewal of the fish
eries treaty at any time, yet Canada is not
the party suffering from the Abrogation of
that treaty, and does not feel called upon to
sacrifice one just right to have it renewed.

London, December Sth—a. m.—President
Cleveland's message has been received by
the English press which that chorus of
applause which they habitually bestow on
his efforts. Tories, Liberals and Independ
ents vie in praising his moderation, good
sense and statesmanlike qualities. They
have done their best to extract from his
financial points hints of his policy favoring
free trade against what the Daily Xetvs calls
" the insatiable greed of protection." But
British hopes that America means to adopt
British ideas are growing faint.
Gladstone Dors Not Yield.
New York, December 8th —a. m.—Glad
stone's speech and action at the recent
meeting will greatly strengthen him in the
country generally, and more especially in
those constituencies now represented by
Unionist members. The proceedings are
certain eventually to produce a division in
the ranks of the dissident Liberals. Signs
of this are already apparent. Gladstone
will probably decline to drop into the
trap Hartington has baited for him by in
viting him to denounce the Irish Leagues.
It is evident that a dead set is going to be
made against Gladstone to»force him into
discountenancing the Parnellites. Unless
Gladstone's most intimate friends are
deceived, the Liberal leader is as firm in
his convictions on home rule as ever.
The probable course of atfairs at the next
session of Parliament will be a stand-up
tight between the Whigs and Tories, com
bined for coercion, and the Gladstonites
and Parnellites ag^jnst it.
l>ne* KofOlMHi Cause Diphtheria '*
Diphtheria has been unusually prevalent
in Connecticut the past year, and the Slate
Board of Health has been trying to learn
the reason. There has been no general
epidenirc, but the disease has been en
demic in Stamford, New Canaan, Green
wich, Meriden and some other places. But
the only report that the Board has received
that has the merit of any discovery respect
ing this disease has been a verbal and in
formal one trom Meriden, which will be
amplified with a formal and detailed state
ment. It will be quite liktly to attract the
attention of all physicians. There have
been a good many cases in Meriden, and
some of them could not be traced to any of
the causes —such as uncle.'nliness and tilth
presence—to which the disease is ascribed.
It was noticed that not a single fatal case
occurred in the town in any house where
gas or candles were used. In every case
the family in which it appeared were in the
habit of "using kerosene exclusively. In
quiries made elsewhere showed the same
results. In one case in Meriden the kero
sene lamps were removed and candles sub
stituted for light, and there was immediate
improvement in the patient. But by acci
dent a night or two later a kerosene lamp
was brought into the sick chamber and left
burning all night. The patient nest day
grey.- worse ami died.
A very careful inquiry based on this dis
covery will be made. It may be nothing
more than a coincidence, but already it has
been learned that persons stricken with
diphtheria in the vicinity of kerosene reiin
crics rarely recover. The State Board of
Health is inclined to the opinion that a
very important discovery may have been
made in the ;i!iology of this scourge. —

A New Cn\zs.—Collecting silver spoons
is, some one declares, a popular form of
European shopping by American ladies. A
spoon is purchased iv every city which the
traveler visits, and the name of the city
engraved on the bowl of thespoon. Nearly
every country has a different style of spoon,
and in England, Ireland and Scotland every
city has Us peculiar mark which must be
j placed on nil spoons made within it.
What is said to be a fact not generally

THE FOLSOM PRISON.
Warden McComb'x Keport to the Prison
Directors.
General John McComb, Warden of the
Stale Prison at Folsom. in his report to the
State Board of Prison Directors, says :
The appropriation for the support of the
prisoners for the last fiscal year was made
on the basis of the year preceding. Since
that time, however, the number of prison
ers at the close of the fiscal year was by
133 greater than it was at its commence
ment. This cause, joined to the fact that
the income from the sale of products did
not equal the amount estimated by the
Legislature, rendered a deficiency inevit
able.
The money necessary to carry on the
management of the prison was obtained
from the National Bank of D. O. Mills &
Co., of Sacramento, at the rate of 7 per
cent, per annum. To meet this indebted
ness it will be necessary to ask for an appro
priation by the Legislature to cover the
principal and the interest to May, 1887—
about $12,900. It will be necessary to
ASK FOB AN ADDITIONAL APrROPI:IATION
For the support of the prison for the
thirty-eighth fiscal year, as it will he im
possible to meet each month's expenses
with one-twelfth of the sum already appro
priated. I estimate the probable deficiency
at about $1,000 per month, making $12,000.
As the majority of the prisoners are serv
ing long sentences, and there is no falling
off in the number of commitments, there
will be a larger population to support dur
ing the next two years, and as there prob
ably will be no revenue from the labor of
the prisoners, sufficient in amount to ma
terially decrease the expenses, and as the
amount that may be earned is a matter of
great uncertainty, it will require an appro
priation of $120,000 for each of the fiscal
years—thirty-ninth and fortieth.
This does not imply that the prisoners
will be idle for even a single day, as they
can all —aside from productive labor—be
occupied in building an addition to the cell
building and in the construction of other
improvements, such as walls, sewers and
roads; also, in gardening, farming, wood
chopping, and in the manufacture of cloth
ing and shoes for the use of the prisoners.
In my judgment
NO PRISONER SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO BE
IHLE,
Except as a punishment. It does not re
quire very great ingenuity to invent work
for prisoners when there is a stone quarry
on the premises, and I do not anticipate
any difficulty in keeping all the prisoners
busily employed. However, in addition to
the resources named, there is also the pos
sibility that the Natoma Water and Min
ing Company, through its successor, the
Folsom Water Power Company, will call
for the labor of the prisoners to aid in the
completion of the canal, as the decision in
the Superior Court is adverse to the State.
If the case should be decided against the
State in the Supreme Court, the probability
of a demand for the payment of the num
ber of days' labor must be considered.
It is not too soon to look forward to the
time when most of the improvements will
be completed, and when it may be neces
sary to find satisfactory employment for
the prisoners who cannot be used as me
chanics. The purchase of an additional
tract of land will furnish that employment
in raising the grain and vegetables needed
for the prison, thus lowering
THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE PRISONERS
■\Vithout bringing their labor in competi
tion with free labor by the sale of the pro
ducts. An old-time prisoner commended
my efforts to establish a small farm among
the rocks surrounding the prison, by saying
that the work would produce better results
than merely raising a crop—that the re
formation of a criminal could best be
accomplished by teaching him how to
maintain hirusclf by honest Jabor, •' and,"
said this philosopher, " there is no better
way of giving that lesson than by showing
him that with his own hands and a few
simple tools he can get his living from the
soil; he does not need to run the risk of
being shunned by those who suspect him
of being an ex-convict, or to have the hu
miliation of a discharge by his employer
when the exposure of his history is made,
for he can go to some spot that is open to
him for settlement, clear a piece of land,
and get enough from the sale of the wood
to carry him through till he can realize on
the little patch he has planted, and so go
on, with better prospects for the next year.
Many a man would do this if he knew
how. and could command the patience to
wait, but here he can see it demonstrated—
the piece of chaparral that he helped to
reclaim is now growing a crop of wheat or
barley."or is bearing grapevines, or is cov
ered with vegetables, and he can easily
reason that the same results will follow his
efforts when working for himself. Almost
any prisoner wijl take
DELIGHT IN THE WORK XV WHICH HE CP.EATES
soMKrmjJt;, *
And once you get a man fascinated with
work on a farm, he has partly taken him
self out of the criminal class. Let him
discover that he can be his own employer
and make an honest living, and he will be
apt to complete his reformation." If no
other good result should follow the em
ployment of some of the prisoners in the
•occupation of farming, at least they will
help to diminish the cost of their support.
I regret to have to announce the demise
of two officers of the prison during the
year just closed—Professor James Gaulev
and Captain R. S. Bugg. Professor Gauley
was highly esteemed by officers and prison
ers, and all who knew him. He was per
sonally endeared to me by his many lovely
traits of character. The gentle disposition
of Captain Bugg won friends for him on
all sides. The people of the neighboring
town testified their grief by closing their
places of business to join the funeral pro
cession.
In the statistics of the prison population
will be found several tables which have
been prepared to meottbequestiors that are
frequently asked by visitors, and some
times by officials of other prisons, or by
representatives of bureaus of statistics.
One comparative table.
SHOWING THE INEQUALITY OF SENTENCES
For the same crimes, will commend itself

tion is invited to the report of the Physi
cian, Dr. F. C. Durant, to whom I am
greaily indebted lor his cheerful assistance
in carrying out all measures for guarding
against the probable approach of any dis
ease from neighboring settlements, or from
originating on our premises. The remark
able healthfulr.ess of the prison population
is cause for congratulation ; there is no
longer any foundation for the reports about
the insalubrity of the climate of this belt of
the foothills. Of the seven deaths from
diseases not one can be attributed to any
disorders caused by a residence in this lo
cality.
My thanks are due to Captain Chambers,
and "the other officers of the prison, for un
tiring devotion to duty, and tor hearty sup
port in every undertaking. To you" gen
tlemen, I wish to make acknowledgment
of my indebtedness for many acts of cour
tesy and unvarying kindness. My unani
mous re-election is appreciated as a very
grtnt compliment, but-the delicacy of the
course of the majority of your Board lifts
the action above the plane of personal coru
plircent, and ranks it as an unselfish and
commendable tribute to a principle.

THE CITRUS FAIR.
Its Importance ag an Educator and as
Bearing L'pon Immigration.
[S. F. Bulletin, December 7th.]
On the 13th g/ the present month a great
Citrus Fair is to be held in Sacramento. It
is held some days earlier than a former one
at that place, because the oranges are ripe
and are ready to be gathered, and of course
are in prime order for exhibition. It is a
curious fact that oranges grown north of
the bay of San Francisco ripen from three
to four weeks earlier than in the southern
part of the State. A citrus fair on the 13th
of December would be quite premature in
the country south of the bay of Monterey.
If anything can be gathered from the pre
dictions ot those well up in the business of
citrus growing, this will be one of the most
important fairs ever held in this State.
Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Sacramento, Butte,
San Joaquin and some of the mountain
counties will be represented at that time.
One of tfie most important resnlts will
be the turning of attention to the great nat
ural resources of the northern part of the
State. Now it may be set down with the
utmost certainty that wherever in the State
a ciimate is found where the orange and
lemon come to perfection it is a good cli
mate for settlers. In fact, there are no bad
climates in California. But a climate mild
enough to bring the orange to perfection
was ior a long time supposed to exist only
in the southern part of the State. The
increasing orange crops attracted atten
tion. Invalids who had been to Florida and
were disappointed, turned their atten
tion toward the great counties of l.os
Angeles, San Diego and San Bernar
dino. That immigration continues. It
will be a good thing if it continues
for years to come. There is a great
deal of room in southern California. A
million of people more would hardly be
sufficient to turn the unoccupied land into
fruitful farms. Not a great deal has been
done as yet in making the whole country
acquainted with the resources of the north
ern counties of the State. When a citrus
fair was held last year of only such fruits
as were gathered in these great counties
nearly everybody was astonished. If such
fruits could be grown there, and that, too,
without any special effort, was it not a fair
inference that these counties ought to be
just as attractive to settlers as those further
south? The real difference appeared to be
that the resources of one part of the State
had been thoroughly advertised while the
resources of the other part had not.
If, then, the Citrus Fair to be held in
Sacramento next week is made the occa
sion of a more extensive publication of re
sources, a great point will have been
gained. We would not have one immi
grant less go to southern California, but
would have some thousands more go to the
great counties north of San Francisco.
Perhaps citrus-growing will not become a
leading industry in these counties. That
may be only an incident. If it is a profit
able business there will be no lack of vent
ures in that line. One thing is certain.
The great fruit region—that is, as to variety
—will extend northward clear up to the
Oregon line. Citrus fruits will not do well
in all these counties. But for at least four
degrees north of this city they will come to
perfect maturity in all the warm valleys.
So much was demonstrated a year ago.
Probably a clearer demonstration will be
made at the coming fair. The apple, plum,
peach, apricot, pear and grape are at home
in all these northern counties. Not only
are the first oranges brought to the market
in the early winter, but the tirst cherries in
the early spring come from a district
nearly a hundred miles north of this city.
Facts like these are worth more than all
theories. There is no need of speculating
on probabilities. When the fruit-grower
brings in his ripe cherries in April and his
ripe oranges in Cecember, and not only a
few samples, but carloads, we have to do
with facts and not theories. There are
some other facts that ought to be better
known. Northern California, besides hav
ing one of the best climates in the world,
is a picturesque country. Its mountains,
hills, valleys, forests, lakes and living
streams are a source of perpetual enjoy
ment to all those who care for scenery and
for the wealth of natural resources. All
this can fairly be said without abating any
interest in southern California. The cur
rent of immigration to that part of the
State is now so strong that it will take care
of itself. It has been wisely directed. The
great hotels built and projected, the over
land excursions wh'eh till these hotels
with winter guests, are all powerful stimu
lants to immigration. The railroads also
have done great things for that part of the
State.
What would be the result if the same
concerted effort were made to attract immi
grants to northern California? It could
hardly be lees satisfactory. In the new
impetus given to local railroad building it
is assumed that every important county
north of San Francisco will be reached by
railroad, and that every large valley will
be reached in that way. There are the
great counties of Lake, Meudocino and
Humbol'U soon to be opened up by rail
roads. It is safe for immigrants to antici
pate these improvements. They are sure
to be made. In the greater part of the
great northern district the question of irri
gation is of iar ie;>s comparative importance
because there is moisture enough to grow
all cereal and fruit crops from the winter
rainfall. One has only to look over the
rain tables of the last few years to see how
well established this proposition has be
come. These, then, are some of the re
sources of this great district now inviting
population. Water in abundance, diversi
fied and picturesque scenery, climate, nat
ural resources without stint, and large areas
of unoccupied land to be had at a moder
ate cost. Surely, if theeitnis-growers about
to be represented in the fair at Sacramento
make a fresh proclamation ot these facts
they will do a good work for the State.
Eruption of the Shin Cured.
Brockville, Ontario, Can., Dec. 2, 1885.
I have used Urandretii's Pills for the
past fifteen years, and think them the best
cathartic and anli-bi!ious remedy known.
For some five years I suffered with an erup
tion of the skin that gave mo great pain
and annoyance. I tried different blood
remedies, but. although gaining strength,
the itching was unrelieved. I tinallv con
cluded to take a thorough course ot Brand
reth's Pills. I took six each night for four
nights, then five, four, three, two, lessening
each time by one, and then for one month
took one every night, with the happy re
suit that now my skin is perfect! v clear and
has been so ever since. Ed. Vexniy.
