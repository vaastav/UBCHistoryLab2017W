P0IS0H0US MEDICINES
EPORTED B
Adulterations of Food, Drugs and Milk for Oc
tober and November Unfit Food Con
demned and Destroyed.
K. A. Duncan, Food Commissioner and
Analyst, devotes the bulk of his report
for October and November to poisons
and dangerous ingredients in patent
medicines.
Out of nine food samples examined
he found five adulterated, and out of
forty-four samples examined is 55.55,
and that of adulterated drugs 45.45 per
cent.
Following are the details:
POISON LABELING.
The drugs examined were of prepara
tions usually designated as "patent
medicines" and were composed of cough
syrups, baby soothing syrups and "pain
killers."
The object of this investigation was
to determine the presence or absence of
morphine and to require a statement of
the dangerous ingredient on the label.
The .question of the enforcement of
this section of our food and drug law,
as well as the rules and regulations of
the Board of Health, respecting the
labeling of "poisons", came up in re
placing of poison labels on the prepara
tion called "Liquozone".
Tn this case, I required our druggists
to place poison labels on the package,
interpreting this section of our food
and drug law to mean a statement of
the dangerous quality, as well as name,
of the dangerous ingredient.
In the case of cough syrups, the pres
ence of morphine would be classed as a
dangerous ingredient, but the amount
is so small that it is improbable that
any harm would result from its use.
The indirect harm which may result,
such as the formation of the "morphine
habit ' ' from the use of morphine prepa-
! rations, is not necessary for me to bring
up.
The proper interpretation of the sec
tion is what I respectfully call to your
attention. Is it sufficient simply to
state the name of the dangerous ingre
dient, or is it also necessary to call at
tention (as by poison or other means)
to the dangerous quality?
There are a number of preparations
ou the market which contain dangerous
ingredients as a part of the formula,
and a decision on the cough syrups
would also settle the question for the
other preparations of this character.
INSIDIOUS COUGH SYRUPS.
Cough syrups containing morphine
without a statement of its presence or
dangerous quality are catalogued as
below by Mr. Duncan:

Throat Coughs
A ticking in the throat;
hoarseness at times; adeep
breath irritates it; these
are features of a throat
cough. They 're very de
ceptive and a cough mix
ture won't cure them.
You want something that
will heal the inflamed
membranes, enrich the
blood and tone up the
system .. .. .. . .
Scoffs Emulsion
is just such a remedy.
It has wonderful healing
and nourishing power.
Removes the cause of
the cough and the whole
system is given new
strength and vigor .. ..

, Two samples of baby soothing syrups
were found to contain moruhine.
"Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup,"
manufactured bv Curtis & Perkins, New
York.
"Baby Soothing Syrup," manufac
tured by Western Chemical Co.
In reference to this sample, I may
say that a statement of the presence of
morphine is given in terms of the
French Pharmacopeia. I consequently
call this preparation adulterated, as a
clear statement of its contents is not
given on the label in terms of the
United States Pharmacopeia.
Miscellaneous samples containing
morphine:
"Dr. J. Collis Brown's Chlorodyne,"
manufactured by J. T. Davenport,
London.
"Pain-killer" (Perry Davis), manu
factured by Davis & Lawrence Co.,
New York.
A sample of drug was examined at
your request and verbal report made on
same.
FOOD INSPECTION.
Foods examined were as follows:
One sample honey; no adulteration.
One sample each of cloves, cornstarch
and butter were examined; no adultera
tion being detected.
Three samples shrimps were examined
and found not fit for food.
One sample lemon extract. Popular
brand, manufactured by Novelty Mills,
San Francisco, was found adulterated in
not containing any oil of lemon.
One sample vanilla extract, Popular
brand, manufactured by Novelty Mills,
San Francisco, was found adulterated.
This sample" was a compound of a mix
ture of artificial vanilla and courmarin,
no extract of vanilla beans being
present.
Approximately 100 packages of mis
cellaneous foods were condemned and
ordered destroyed.
ACTION TAKEN.
At the meeting of the Board of
Health yesterday afternoon. President
Pinkham submitted the question ot
Liquozone for decision. Correspondence
with the manager of the company man
ufacturing the article was read, in
which President Pinkham declined to
recognize testimonials from obscure
sources on the mainland.
The reply of the medicine man con
tained a thread of legal proceedings
against the Board of Health.
It was stated by the president that,
as the article contained sulphurous and
sulphuric acids, the food commissioner
! saw no reason why the order tor label
ing the stuff as poison should be with
drawn. It was voted that the Board stand by
tho order.
MILK BLACK LIST.
Mr. Duncan reports. having examined
l 84 milk samples in October of which
two were below standard, and 60 in No-
j vember of which seven w ere below stan
dard. Those furnishing the inferior
milk were F. Martens, private party, F.
IF. Farm, F. Correa, Miyikawa, F. Me-
deiros, J. Lucas and v. Souza.
LIBERT is FETED
(Continued from Page 1.)
out successfully will be responded
to
by Mr. A. E. Murphy.
Our Holy Father Pope Pius X and
our Moly Mother the Church, may His
reign be beneficent and long and may
She grown in influence, extent and
power to which I respectfully ask His
Lordship to respond.
The first was responded to by Judge
Robinson, who paid a glowing tribute
to the history of the Catholic Church
and to Christianity for the blessings it
had brought to the world, and ended
with praise for Bishop Libert and
Father Valentin, expressing thanks that
they had returned in such excellent
health.
"The President" was responded to by
Mr. R. C. Stackable, who referred to
the first toasts to a president in the
latter part of the eighteenth century,
in honor of George Washington, then
forty years later to Jackson, then to
Lincoln, then to Oarfield and now to J
that preeminent master of statecraft,
Theodore Roosevelt. He said the ban- !
ouet was essentially a church gather- i
ing to pay respect to the head of the j
Catholic tJhureh in Hawaii. He said
that or.e of the greatest things ttli
United States had maintained is the es
tablishment of religious liberty wher
ever the Stars and Stripes fly, . and
Roosevelt would no more tolerate an
infringement upon the religious liberty
of the American people than he would
tolerate interference with any of the
American principles of government.
"Hawaii the Land We Live In," was
responded to by Governor Carter. He
said in part:
"I want to take you into rrty con
fidence, although,- this is not a con
fidence game. (Laughter). But I want
to tell you of an acquaintance whose
wife conducts a boarding school for
boys. She bowed to a gentleman on
the street one day and immediately
saw she had made a mistake. How
ever, she spoke to the gentleman, say
ing. "I wish to take you into my con
fidence, but I thought you were the
father of one of my boys. (Laughter).
"I left the notes of my speech at
home. I had them all nicely prepared
but they are right now on my library
table, so you see I'm left high and
dry.
"The first thing I want you to do
is to respond silently, if you please.
to a toast to the absent ones. It is
a hackneyed toast, and given at all
banquets, but we all have absent ones
of vv. in we t-an think. As I look up
and down the faces here, all so happy
in tliii t-wist. iin.l see the luxury or
the table, hear the tinkling: of the
glasses and sve the brilliant shades of
the flags. I am reminded of a place
away from here and of some who can
not partake with us tonight. I am re
minded of those true heroines who are
toiling among the afflicted ones at Mo
lokai. and I ask you to drink a silent
toast to those devoted sisters and broth
ers who toil there so faithfully.
"On an occasion of this hind I think
it is well to retrospect a little. I
recognize that this is a celebration of
the Catholic Church in Hawaii. I think
there is, a great deal in the history of
Hawaii to be learned from the work
done by the Catholic Church in these
islands. There is certainly a great deal
of encouragement and a great deal of
inspiration to be gained from it.
"Probably the work that is now be
ing done does not satisfy all of the
component parts of that church prob
ably does not satisfy some of the more
restless ones. They would like to see
this or that done and more advance
made.
"One of the greatest lessons is its
silent work; no retrogression but steady
advancement and with but one object
in view always.
"In the history of the church here
in Hawaii, I was reminded of an in
cident in the days of Kaahumanu,
when she had centered in her hands
all the power of government as re
gent, and her power was despotic. At
that time she attempted as most sov
ereigns more enlightened than she have
attempted, to issue an edict which
prevented any but white people from
attending the Catholic church. She
did not realize as Napoleon did that
where the dominion of religion begins
there the earthly dominion ends. The
church and state are separated, and
any sovereign not recognizing that is
bound to make a mistake as Kaahu
manu made her mistake. So, too, any
church which attempts to interfere
with the state makes a mistake. A
community is happy, indeed, where that
state of affairs exists where both the
church and state are harmonious.
"Leaving the past of Hawaii, let us
come to the present. The Territory, to
my mind, has almost unknowingly
come into a new era. It is to me ex
ceedingly gratifying .to see the way
open for progress and advancement
in our little Territory. We have lately
had word from Washington, that it
is not against the regulations of the
Immigration Department for the Terri
tory to assist immigrants and small
farmers to these shores; providing they
are in good physical condition. It had
been supposed before that no assisted
immigration could be obtained. The
ruling from Washington gives the op
portunity to this Territory to open the
J way for making this land the land of
the blest. TO BRING PRODUCERS
!
I HERE. HUMAX BEINGS!-(applause)
ELIGIBLE TO BECOME CITI
ZENS. j "Your fathers who have Iivied in
these islands for many years, know
every nook of it. They recognize there
j are valleys that are beautiful beyond
; description, which should teem with
I human beings. These islands instead
of having but loo.OOO people, ought to
have, and will have, 500,000 within a
reasonable time. (Applause.)
"Xot only are we opening into a
new era in that regard, but yesterday's
message from President Roosevelt
shows he has given us a great opening
in regard to financial matters.
"The productions of Haw-aii will al
ways be tropical productions, and we
will always be in competition with
Porto Rico and the Philippines. We
were the first to be annexed and when
the United States took us in they had
not then the decision of the Supreme
Court which provides that the United
States could possess such lands, and so
we came in as an integral part of the
United States and were annexed.
Therefore, the same tax tariff exists in
Hawaii as in every part of the Union,
and we contribute our quota to the
mainland. In recognition of the fact
that Congress put Porto Rico and the
Philippines in a position where they do
not contribute anything of their rev
enues to the United States, and if
Uncle Sam is to majke a success of
these islands, the experience of other
countries in controlling possessions
must be taken advantage of, and the
laws must be adjusted to meet condi
tions. "WE MUST HAVE SPECIAL LEG
ISLATION' TO MEET THESE CON
DITIONS. Uncle Sam never made a
failure of any job he ever undertook.
Whenever he strokes his whiskers and
puts his hands to the plow things have
got to move. He will not stop here.
There will be progress in Hawaii.
"When we point out to hrm what our
needs, are and can makfe, these is
lands blossom, we simply do our duty
as American citizens, and give Con-i
gress an opportunity to enact legisla
tion which will bring prosperity and
happiness to these islands. Most peo
ple do not realize to what extent this
tribute amounts. Every man, woman
ind child in this Territory contributes
$7.99 per annum to Uncle Sam. There
is no set of people that is so situated
to meet such a tax. Rhode Island and
Connecticut have about 6600 square
miles, about our size. If you strip
Rhode Island and Connecticut of its
vast population down to loH.OO and tax
those people to the extent of Jl.OOO.Of'O
a year, those hard-headed, patriotic
Yankees will kick to beat the band. I
don't believe those people there could
stand up to any such a tax as we have
done in Hawaii. We ask Congress to
say that a portion of the revenues
from the taxes go into our treasury to
be expended as Congress sees fit say
three-quarters of a million dollars
every year for twenty years. Here is
an opportunity to secure an appropria
tion for twenty years. Therefore, it is
worth twenty times the effort to get
that money.
"I want to congratulate you upon
your committee of arrangements and to
thank you all for the pleasure I have
hid in being here tonight and in being
able to offer my respects to the head
of your church in Hawaii."
Bishop Libert, who closed the speech
making, said that when he was a boy
he had two great objects in life. One
was to see Rome and the ottter the
Tnpe. When he was sent from Europe
to Hawaii he gave up all hope of ever
hn-iTr eifh- of hi objects attained."
