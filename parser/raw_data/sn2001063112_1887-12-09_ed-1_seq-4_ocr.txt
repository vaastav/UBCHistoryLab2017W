.Bismarck Tribune: An Aberdeen
dispatch says that there were only
three votes cast against division at
I'ierre at the recent election, and now
over forty leading citizens sign the call
for the anti-division convention at
Aberdeen. This shows one of two
things either a great number failed
to vote, or else there has been a chauge
in the sentiment of a large number of
divisionists. l) ubtless both proposi
tions are true.
Or, thirdly, that a good many signed
that call as a Mitchell man did. He
was asked to put his name to a paper
on the assurance that it was all right
to sign it. He didn't read the docu
ment or know its contents, but seeing
a number of familiar names already
down, he added his, and was surprised
a day or two later to see himself pub-,

The Atlanta Constitution represented
a divided household (luring the recent
prohibition struggle there. In com
menting on the result one of its editors,
("apt. E. 1'. ilowell, says:
I am as much opposed to the indis
criminate sale of liquors as 1 am to the
prohibition which Atlanta has had.
This lias been my platform, and I have
tried to make myself clearand positive
on this point. To the people of Atlanta
I will say again that 1 heartily favor
all proper restrictions of the sale of
liijuor. To this I am pledged, t,nd to
this the go. a::ti prohibitionists of the
city are pledged, and to this I, with
them, will stand.
While Henry W. (irady. the other
member of the stall, asserts:
When everything else I have said or
done is forgotten 1 want the words 1
have spoken for prohibition in Atlanta
to be remembered. 1 am prouder of
my share in the campaign that has
ended in defeat than of my share in
all other campaigns that have ended in
victory.
(len. .lumper has committed the un
pardonable sin. He has taken an atti
tude in favor of admission as a whole.
As a result division papers are actually
talking of kicking him out of the G.
A. K.
The above, from the .Sioux Falls Ar
gus-Leader, is a sample of the argu
ment used by theanti-divisionists. Mr.
•Jumper's offense was not that he held
certain political views, but that he
prostituted his position in a purely
non-partisan organization to help a
local scheme. However, as .lumper has
apologized, his alleged friends ought
not to continue to call attention to
him.
'The national prohibition convention

sharply defined between the two par
ties, there were 111 votes cast for the

The Sioux Falls Argus-Leader makes
some personal comparisons between
the prominent divisionists and the
signers of the one-state call, and cites
some very good men among the latter.
Hut unfortunately for the force of the
Argus-Leader's analogy every man
but one or two quoted by it is a demo
crat, and every last- one of these is
either a federal or territorial office
holder. or is a candidate for a federal
or territorial office. If the gentlemen
of the other side will own up that the
Aberdeen movement is a purely demo
cratic affair, there will no longer be
any room for argument. It is the dem
ocratic policy to admit Dakota as a
whole, or keep her out altogether, and
we don't expect anything else. lint
we shall continue to object to the dem
ocratic wolf masquerading in the
sheep's clothing of pretense that it is
the "people" of Dakota who are behind
this latest move.

There can be no question as to the
authorship of the president's message
to the llftieth congress. Grover Cleve
land's personality stands out in every
tedious sentence, in every turgid ex
pression, as in the sturdy independence
of the views advanced and the ill-con
cealed purpose of the writer to put
forth a platform on which the demo
crats can win next year. It is a la
bored effort to combine a campaign
document with an evident honest de
sire to see some plan adopted by which
the present financial condition can be
improved. Taken all together, Presi

courage in approaching one of the most

be mere technicalities but it seems to
us that in so vital a matter as this, in

How She Wnrbleri.
She was taking a
trip on the railroad,
and the. day was a
perfect charm. She
rested her head
gainst the window
to gaze'on the land
scape warm. She
looked far away to the meadows, far
away to the charming whirl, and the
draft through the crack the window
lifted each pendant curl Was it a
dream or a vision or a scene in the
green far off? For she sighed with a
gentle murmur and then was convulsed
with a cough. list then came a friend
to her elbow, a companion who came
to rejoice, and she turned with a smile
to greet, her. but low! she had lost her
voice. Yes just in that little second,
as her eyes on the landscape gloat, that
draft through the open crevice had
closed up her delicate throat. And
alas! in a nearing city she was to sing
on the stage that night. What could
she do so voiceless but to weep at her
pitiful plightV Now the friend who
had watched her dilemma drew forth
from her satchel a cure. St. Jacobs
Oil it was labeled a remedy famous
and sure. An external use on the
throttle, well rubbed to remove the
cause, she will always carry a bottle,
for she sang that night with applause.
"New York. N. Y„ July G, 1SST. You
may rely on what 1 told you about the
positive cure by St. Jacobs Oil. which
remedy I used on ray wife (profession
ally known as Patti Hosa). In Hart
ford, after doctors stating she could
not recover before four weeks, St.
Jacobs Oil cured her in three clays, and
she has not had a pain since. Her com
plaint at that time was nerve neuralgic
rheumatism, and 1 can assure you she
was a great sufferer. I have never
failed in advising all whom I have met
that were complaining to use St. Jacobs
Oil. If this letter is of any value vou
are entirely welcome. Very resp'y, It.L.

Discussing couditions of city pros
perity, the Sioux City Daily journal
editorially says: "Advertising pays
where growth is desired. If a mer
chant has all the trade ho desires, lie
has no need to pay the printer money.
If the manufacturer has all the busi
ness he can handle, he does not need
to advertise. If a city has reached the
standard of its hope, and does not want
to be any more of a city than it is, and
had just as soon see a little grass in
the
main streets in the lazy summer
weather, why then it is the veriest non
sense for it to advertise for what it
does not want. But where other con
ditions exist advertising may be used
to excellent advantage. There are a
good many people who hold to the no
tion that the local press has exclusive
responsibility in the matter of adver
tising the city. Dubuque has had a
bridge celebration, and outside of a few
small dodgers the advertising of the af
fair was left to the courtesy of the
local newspapers. That is quite a pre
vailing fashion with reference to such
things, and it ought not to be so. The
newspapers should contribute their
share in all such public enterprise, but
beyond that, more than upon the aver
age industry of the city, no claim
should be enforced against them.
Signs of Feminine Warfare.
WASHINGTON, Dec. S.—The wife of
an ex-member of congress from Minne
sota is expected here to play a leading
role in society during the winter. Dur
ing the last clays of her husband's term,
not many years ago, she made it her
business to say a great many abusive
things concerning a prominent Minne
sota lady, and those sayings have come
to the ears of the injured and aggieved
party. If the wife of the ex-congress
man is wise she will defer her visit, be
cause there is a league formed which
might make herstay rather unpleasant
and she would not reign as an unques
tioned queen. Those little spitful
things which women say about each
other sometimes react, and become
dangerous as boomerangs. But women
will be jealous of each other and, be
ing jealous, they are frequently tin
wise.

A Clear Cut Aualysli of the Document.
NKW YORK. Dec. 8.- -The Tribune of
today contains a long interview with
the ll".n. James G. Ul.iine on l're.-ideist
Cleveland's message. It WHS taken in
short hand under the direction of the
Tribune's Paris correspondent and
sent by cable last night. It is as fol
lows:
"I have been reading an abstract of
the president's message and have been
especially interested in the comments
of London papers. For th" first time
in the history of the I'nited States the
president rcoommendn retaining the
internal tax in order that the tariff
may be forced down even far below
tho revenue standard. lie rccommends
that the tax on tobacco be increased
and thus that many millions annually
shall be levied on a domestic product
which would tar better come from a
tariff' on foreign fabrics
"Then do you mean to implj that
you would lavor the repeal of the to
bacco tax
"Certainly. 1 mean just that,"said
Mr. B. "1 should urge that it be done
at once, even before tin' Christmas hol
idays. It would in the first, place
bring great relief to the growers of
tobacco all over the country, and
would, moreover, materially lessen the
price of this article to consumers. To
bacco to millions of men is a necessity.
"Well, then, Mr. Blaine, would you
advise the repeal of the whisky tax
a'SOf."
"No, I would not. Other considera
tions than these of financial adminis
tration are be taken into account
with regard to whisky. There is a
moral side to it. To cheapen the price
of whisky is to increase its consump
tion enormously. There would be no
sense in urging the reforms wrought
by high license in many states if the
national government, neutralize the
good effect of making whisky within
the reach of everyone at twenty cents
a gallon. Whisky has done a vast deal
of harm in the I'nited States. So long
as there is whisky to tax I would tax
it, and when the national government
should have no use for the money I
would divide the tax among the federal
union with the specific object of
lightening the tax on real estate. Tax
on whisky by the government, with its
suppression of all illicit distillation
and consequent enhancement of price,
has been a powerful agent in the tem
perance reform. 1 should also seriously
object to the repeal of the duty on
wool. To repeal that would work
great injustice to many interests and
would seriously discourage what we
should earnestly encourage, namely,
the sheep culture among the fanners
throughout the union."
"Then you think the question of la
bor underlies the whole subject?"
"Of course if does," replied Mr.
Blaine. "It is, in fact, the entire ques
tion. Whenever we can force carpen
ters, masons, iron workers and
mechanics in every department to
work as cheaply and live as poorely in
the United States as similar workmen
in Europe, we can, of course, manu
facture just as cheaply as they do in
England and France."
"Yes, but might not the great farm
ing class be benelited by importing
articles from Europe instead oi buying
them at higher prices at home?"
"The moment," answered Mr. Blaine,
"that you begin to import freely from
Europe vou drive our own workmen
from mechanical and manufacturing
pursuits. In the same proportion they
become tillers of the soil, increasing
steadily the agricultural products and
decreasing steadily the large home de
mand which is constantly enlarging as
home manufactures enlarge. That, of
course, works great injury to the
farmer, glutting the market wiih his
products. I would reduce the revenue
by prompt repeal of the tobacco tax,
and would make here and there some
changes in the tariff, not to reduce pro
tection, but wisely to foster it."

A Compliment to Gray.
The following dispatch undoubtedly
refers to Mr. Chas. II. Gray, at one
time with the REPUBLICAN:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. Charles II.
Greer, who was nominated by the re
publicans in caucus for postmaster of
the house of representatives, is a resi
dent of Mitchell, D. T., a partner in the
Mitchell Daily REPUBLICAN, and was
named as a recognition of Dakota's
claim upon congress. His name was
suggested by Delegate Gilford, and his
nomination made by acclamation. It
is a Dakota victory and at once stamps
a republican endorsement upon Dako
ta's request for division aud statehood.
Mr. Greer is a well known newspaper
correspondent here, representing the
St. Paul Pioneer Press,
is an influential
republican, a young man and "one of
the boys" in newspaper row. He did
not solicit the compliment and is being
congratulated upon his endorsement.

Mr. Joi.es. in a short speech, stated the
object of the meeting was to select a

I'sing Union Heer.
MII.WAI KKI:, Dec. 8.—A report has
been circulated in this city that the
brew iug lirms of Chicago and Milwau
kee had organized a pool to oppose the
brewers' union. Some of the brewers
deny that llyri'e is any pool. Secretary
Eisner, of the Brewers' union, said the
local brewing liruis were trying to
"eject" beer made at Kliukert's Racine
brewery from the city. When, two
weeks ago, the brewers' association de
cided not to recognize the union there
after, the union resolved that as Klin
kert'sbriwery made the
only union beer,
it should be used in preference to anv
other.
"In two ears," said Secretary Eisner,
Mil waukee will be a temperance town
i! this light is kept up between the
union aud brewery bosses. 'That de
cision of the supreme court is bad for
the bosses. It the bosses fight the
union every man will vote the temper

ticket.

Better tlian Doctors' Stuff.
The doctors may all talk, and they may
blow and say they can cure this and cure
that, but when it comes to telling any
thing about a man's stomach they're not
there. I have come to the conclusion that
the less medicine a man puts into his
stomach the better for himself. Since I
have quit taking medicine I have been all
right. If I had kept on putting an apoth
ecary shop under my vest I might now bo
out where the birds are singing and the
leaves are rustling. The best medicine
for a man is a good, healthy meal. That's
^Tliat I am talciug now. It beats pills,

Wunro and tlie N\,w Then.
American acht elub has barred out
from its contests tho wonderful little steam
yacht the Now Then, owned by Mr Nor
man L. Munro, of New York, on the alleged
ground tliut she is not of the proper class.
Mi". Munro doesn't hesitate to say, however,
thac the real reason for this action on tho
part of the elub is the simple fact that the

But ho promises to have a bigger and a faster
