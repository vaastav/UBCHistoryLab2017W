THE COMING STORM.
The bourbons of France, it was said,
never learned anything and never for
got anything. The bourbon protection
,ista of the United States difier some-
What from their French brethren. They
SV never learn anything but they forget
everything that fhey ever have learned
in the fool's school of experience. They
gave full vent to their greed in the tarifl
act of 1883. Ignoring the counsels of
the moderates they cut as deep as greed
could dictate and they passed a tariff
law in which every selfish interest that
wanted a monopoly of the home market
had its will,
What was the result?
The defeat of the party on the tariff

ciaries literally bought the election.
They raised the largest campaign fund
that was ever spent in politics. They
bought votes as drovers buy sheep.

Mark the prediction:
The campaign of 1904 will be on the
tariff issue and 4,he republican party,
controlled by the trusts and tariff benefi
ciaries, will be defeated.
There has been considerable specula
tion as to why the Buffalo physicians
who attended the late President McKin
ley failed to avail themselves of the op
portunity to Send their bills to Senator
U&nna and receive their pay without
waiting for their money. The general
opinion is that the doctors think they
will be more liberally recompensed if
tbey wait until congress votes them a
lump sum of $100,000 or so, which they
can diyide among themselves instead of
letting shrewd Mark Hanna pass upon
their claims. It is likely, too, that
view of the criticisms passed upon their
treatment, and its results, the medical
men feel a delicacy in naming the
amount desired for their services. Con
gress is never penurious in rewarding
pooh creditors, and the physicians are
no doubt wise in waitiDg for their pay.
Perhaps they bear in mind that $100,000
was appropriated to pay the doctors
who attended President Garfield in his
last illnfess.—Post.

THE MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's message to Con
gress may be commended even by those
who differ politically with the President,
there being a basis for criticism rather
in what is left unsaid than in what the
President has allowed himself to outline
definitely as constituting his recom
mendations of policy.
The general tone of the message is
dignified, patriotic and conservative.
In most instances it is characteristic of
Mr. Booseyelt and, therefore, to this
extent fulfills popular expectation.
Where the message fails in such respects
it is easy to perceive the effect of influ
ences which, in all likelihood, the Pres
ident was unable to resist as a Republi
can and to which he yielded bis obedi
ence to the point of refraining from thfe
fullest and freest expression of his in
dividual views.
There must necessarily be some disap
pointment that Mr. Roosevelt, whose
personal convictions are so well known
to the American people, has been con
tent with so mild a recommendation
concerning the trusts. His advocacy of
publicity of trust affairs is good as far as
it goes, and sound-thinking persons will
agree with him that "the mechanism of
modern business is so delicate that ex
treme care must be taken not to inter
fere with it in a spirit of rashness or ig
norance." But the President might
well have been more assertiye in sug
gesting measures with regard to a sys
tem which, not properly regulated,
works much of evil to the people.
There is a widespread conviction in
the minds of the American people," the
President's message itself declares,
'that the great corporations known as
trusts are uncertain of their features
and tendencies hurtful to the genera
welfare." Yet the message seems to im
ply a keener solicitude for the interests
of these great corporatiohstfian for the
people's good. The machine pressure
on Mr. Roosevelt is apparent here.
Espeeially was the President negligent
in failing to treat frankly and fully of
the very root of all that is evil in the
trust system, the tanfi protection of the
trusts, the tax paid by the people,
which has created monopoly and which
alone makes possible the maintenance
of monopoly at the people's continued
cost. The wrone of the high protective

tariff is now Known to the people of this
country. They cannot regard as "in
fant industries," iucapable of existing
without subsidy, the great American
manufacturing corporations which are
now underselling all competitors in for
eign markets. They see plainly that
there is absolutely no excuse for the
maintenance of an oppressive tariff for
the "protection" of these giant corpora
tions. The only effect of such a tax
on the people is to increase corporation
profits in this country and to perfect the
monopoly eDjoyed by such corporations
owing to the fact that competition is
made impossible. The President's rec
ommendation of the policy of reciproc
ity fails utterly to satisfy the American
Deople on an issue so important. And
even this recommendation is so hedged
about with warnings not to unduly dis
turb the present tariff as to lose what
little strength it might otherwise have
In the matter of our colonial posses
sions the President's message leaves the
situation unchanged and as vague aB
ever. We do not know whether Mr.
Roosevelt contemplates the ultimate
dignity of statehood for Hawaii, Porto
Rico and the Philippines. We do not
know whether he would recommend in
stead the holding of these islands as
dependencies, simply, with no prospect
of their peoples arriving at American
citizenship. He declares that "our aim
is high," but he does not specify in defi
nite termB what that aim is. There is
absolutely no new light on the Repub
lican policy with regard to our colonies.
As to the Philippines, the President's
greatest fear, repeatedly expressed, is
that we may unwittingly give them la
greater degree of self-government than
is good for them.
The message rightfully makes a forci
ble recommendation fdf^TCgfelation to
suppress anarchy. This recommendation
follows Mr. Roosevelt's touching review
of the assassination of the late Presiden
McKinley by the anarchist Czolgosz.*
The urgency for the prompt and rigor
ous crushing of anarchy as a malign and
incongruous element in American life is
strongly stated and will meet with in
stant popular approval. So, also, as
maintaining the traditional American
attitude, will the President's .reiteration
of the Monroe Doctrine as the cardinal
feature of the American foreign policy
be approved by the American people.
The unusual prominence given in ari
and navy affairs in the message is
to President Roosevelt's deep and in
telligent interest in the two branches ot
the American militant service. As As
sistant Secretary of the Navy he be
came potently familiar with our condi
tionB of sea power and manfully shared
in preparing the American Navy for its
splendid achievements during the war
with Spain. As a Colonel of volunteers
he served in the American Army through
out that same war and thus completed
his fitness for such a discussion of army
and navy needs as is now found in his
message. The recommendations made
in this field aie entitled to peculiar con
sideration as coming from an American
President who speaks with more than
the conventional knowledge of the.
American Army and Navy.
President Roosevelt's first annual
message, submitted to the Fifty-seventh
Congress yesterday, is now before the
American people. It is commended to
tbeir earnest attention. As a political
utterance it is a carefully considered
expression of Republican policy. Its
tone indicates that Mr. Roosevelt has
already come under the restraining -i
fluence of the party leaders and
largely surrendering himself to thei
views.—Republic.
TAXATION AND CONSOLIDATION.
The Sioux City Tribune has the fol
lowing pertinent comments on the
questions of equal taxation and con
solidation of the big railroad interests,
and the basis upon which it was done
Ask the average Iowa tory for an
argument against assessment of rail
road properties on the cash value ob
tained! by totaling the market values
of the Btocks and bonds, and it's a
hundred to one that he will reply:
"It'B impossible. They fluctuate too
much. Why, look at the day when
Northern Pacific went to 1,000. What'll
you do with the quotation for that
day?"
Of course this is not an argument
but Bimply one of those hard ques
tions which it) is taid a certain class
of persons can aBk to confound the
wisest man. The natural reply is that
a flurry in a particular stock on a sin
gle day, nffecting the prices of a few
shareB, i9 not to be taken as either
establishing or breaking down a rule
that if the average quotations for a
yfear were secured, that day's record
would have no perceptible efiect on the
result. Moreover.it is to be said that
the public could well provide penal
ties for this Bort of stock gambling.
But a complete answer to the ques
tion has been given in the publication
of the details of the Hill-Harriman
settlement. It appears that in that
settlement the amount of securities of
the two big systems involved is great
ly increased. Hill and Harriman took
the "market quotation" of their se
curities BB representing real values and
issued a new lot of securities on this
basis. Great Northern being valued
at $178 per share, they issued the new
dtock on this basis that is, 1.78 shares
of the new for eyery share of the old.
Northern Pacific being quoted at about
$115 per share, they issued 1.15 shares
of the new for each shares of the old
Beries. That means pretty good con
firmation of the theory of capitaliz
ing market values, doesn't it? It is
an indorsement of the exact proposi
tion from the greatest railroad finan
ciers in the world.
But that was not all. In fixing up
their settlement, the Harriman inter
ests explained that on Blue Thursday
they had been forced to buy large
amounts of Northern Pacific at much
more than it was worth, a few shares
up as high as $1,000. Of course tbey
didn't make their settlements on this
basis but still they did settle for a
good deal at more than it was worth.
They demanded that they be reimburs
ed for these debts of the gambling ta
ble—that was what it amounted to—
and what was the result? Fifteen mil
lions of new stock was given them
to make good their losBes in that cor
ner.
There is a proposal whose audacity
is startling. Warring interests went af
ter each other with their razors. They
ruined the people who were caught
"short" on stocks which that day were
boomed. Hundreds of little fortunes
and a good many not so little, were
wrecked' that day.- Was any provis
ion made for these unfortunates who
•were ground between the upper and
the nether millstones? None whatever.
But the two giants of speculation,
having fought their battle to a draw
and ruined pll who chanced to stand
in their way*, now come together, -di
vide the swag—and issue $15,000,000 of
additional stock to the side that gam
bled most heavily! It may be said
that it is no concern of the public for
how much these gentlenen qhoosei to
capitalize their companies. But is it
a concern of the public. The people
Who ride on cars and who ship goods
on railroads will be saddled for all time
with the burden of .fixed charges on
that additional $15,000,000. .. To slave
the wounds incurred in a day's war
fare of these Molochs of finance pos
terity is charged with this burden.
And yet must we listen respectfully
to these over-nice advocates of'the ele
gancies who would tell UB that we must
not tax these companies on the basis
that they themselves establish? Is it
not evident enough to every thinking
man that the arguments advanced
against this fair and equitable system
are only advanced in bad faith and for
the purpose of beclouding the minds of
people who have not the time or dis
position to study it in detail?

For Fun.
No one sells them for amuse
ment. It is a serious, important
business on both sides. A drug
store should have two missions:
One, to furnish drugs that can be
relied on the other, to furnish
them for what they are worth.
Drug stoies exist for the public
good. Knowledge, experience
anid progressive methods should
mark their management. We
endeavor to keep step with the
progress of the age, to meet every
requirement ot the'Community,,to
conduct a store that shall stand
for all that a drug store should.
We wish to serve those who
want accurate service, high
