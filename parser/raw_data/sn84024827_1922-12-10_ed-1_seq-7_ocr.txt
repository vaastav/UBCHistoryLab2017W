HIS MISSION IN
PEACE MESSAGE!
i
!
Believes He Accomplished All
Three of Purposes for
Which He Crossed Sea I
I
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 9. (By the f
Associated lress) Georges CUmeu-j
ceau, the grizzled French war pre-!,
mier, today ended his "formal" speak j
ing mission to America before the j
Philadelphia Forum in the academy j
of music with the broad intimation ! .
that he believed he had accomplished I
all of the three purposes for which j
he forsook his cottage by the sea
in Prance.
Of two of the, he evinced. He
was confident he had convinced
America that France was not amn
itaristic nor an imperialistic nation.
He was equally sure he had spread
conviction that France intended to
pay lie debt t,o America not imme
diately perhaps, but ultimately.
' He quoted again a paragraph from
President Harding's annual message
to. congress yesterday as an indica
tion that the third point bringing
America back to the side of France
nuu fiiUKianu also wan twin? ar-i
complished.
The paragraph was the pdesident's
comment on the four power pact
which the executive said had brought
"a new confidence in the maintained
peace" and which he suggested
"might be made a model for like
assurances, whereevet in the worii
any common interests are concerned"
"Io told your chief, "Clemenceau
continued "that when he pondered
on what I had said to him, I be
lieved his feeling would find its
way toward us. And I believe it has.
But I don't know what the diplimats
will make of it."
It ,was again his "peace message,"
that Clemenceau delivered to the
representative audience that faces
him in the gayly decked academy of
music.
But it was a plea for peace based
on France's ideals and these ideals,
ha declared, France would defend
to the last drop of her blood, even
if she had to defend them alone.

Why I Use
Buying
In my capacity as housewife I am
the general manager of a household.
Upon me devolves the duty of mak
ng rather large purchases which leads
into another duty that of the eco
nomical expenditure of the house
hold funds.
My husband reads very assiduous
ly what he calls "trade papers."
These papers pertain almost entirely
to his business. He says he could not
get along without them because they
keep him posted on matters -which
come up in his business life every
day.
In running my household I find
that the newspapers and the maga
zines are my "trade papers." The
advertisements tell me nearly every
thing I wish to know about the pur
chases I should make. Like my hus
band who spends hours upon hours
engrossed in his trade magazines so
that he may conduct his business
more successfully, I study with care
the advertisements in the newspapers
and the magazines which I have
found out enable me to conduct my
business, which is my household,
more economically and successfully.
In doing my neighborhood buying
I think that I am able to choose the
store that gives me the greatest value
for my money. My choice is always
the one where I am sure to get the
advertised goods 'I ask for and where
I am not told: ''Here is something
else just as good." I buy advertised
goods because experience has taught
me I save money thereby.
It has been my observation that

Hawaiian Democrats
Celebrate Victory
HONOLULU, Dec. V. (By the
Associated Press) Democrats of the
territory of Hawaii today celebrated
the recent election of William P.
Jarett' as delegate to Congress with
I a luau, or Hawaiian feast, at which
seven tons of assorted food was
served, and to which everybody was
invited.
j The luau was said to be the largest
given in the territory since the days
of the Hawaiian monarchy-
Jarett's victory at the polls in No

Advertisin
the storekeeper who handles adver
tised articles sells more goods and it
isn't hard for me to figure out that if
the dealer wants to make only a fair
profit he can sell me goods cheaper if
he sells a great many goods than if he
sells a smaller amount. Coincidently,
I have noticed that dealers who do
handle articles which are advertised
seem to grow and expand.
I have often wondered if it isn't
because the goods which they see on
their own shelves remind them con
stantly of the forward-looking work
which is being done by the manufac
' turer of those goods, thus setting an
example for greater industry.
I know that if I want to buy a bar
rel of flour or a very large sack of
flour I can buy it cheaper than I can
buy a ten or twenty-five pound sack.
My storekeeper can do the same thing
in buying his merchandise. I have
heard my husband talk often enough
on the. question of small profits and
rapid turnover to know that it isn't
the dealer who makes the long profit
that gets ahead but the one who
makes the small profit and turns his
capital over and over. But this is
not the only benefit I get in buying
from a storekeeper who sells his cus
tomers goods which are advertised.
The goods I buy are fresher and
newer and I feel that because many
of them have been advertised for
years they arc more dependable.
For how could people continue to
buy them if they were not? And how
could the manufacturers continue to
advertise them if they did not buy?

Take Salts to flush Kidneys,
and neutralize irritating
acids.
Kidney and bladder irritations of
ten result from uric acid, says a
noted Bkin authority. The kidneys
filter this acid from the blood and
pass it on to the bladder, where
it may remain to irritate and inflame
causing a burning, scalding sensa
tion, or setting up an irritation at
the neck of the bladder, obliging
you to seek relief two or three times
during the night. The pufrer is in
constant dread; the water passes
stometimes with a scalding sensation
and ia very profuse; again, there is
difficulty in voiding it.
Bladder weakness most folks call
it, because they can't control urin
ation. While it is extremely annoy
ing and sometimes very painful, this
is often overcome, Get about four
ounces of Jad Salts from your phar
macist and take a table spoonful in
a glass of water before breakfast;
continue this for two or three days.
:This will help neutralize the acids In
! the urine so it no longer is a source
of irritation to the bladder and urin
ary organs, which then act normal
again,
j Jad Salts is inexpensive, harmless,
and is made from the acid of grapes
and lemon juice, combined with lith
ia, and is used by thousands of folks
who are subject to urinary disorders
caused by uric acid irritation. Jad
Salts is splendid for kidneys and
causes no bad effects whatever.
Here you have a pleasant efferves
cent lithia water drink, which often
quickly relieves bladder irritation.
