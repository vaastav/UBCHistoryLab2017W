Merchants, financiers, and business
men of all political parties express ap
proval of the President's message.
The Republicans will, after January
1st, have 16 Governors, again of two,
and 19 State Legislatures, a gain of
four.
The next House of Representa
tives will consist of 184 Democrats
and 141 Republicans. Mr. Speaker
Carlisle, the free trader, is already
tssured of his re-election.
The illuminations and jubilations at
the South, in honor of Democratic
success, continues from day to day.
It is the first time the South has had
a chance for a real old-fashioned hur
rah since it tried to break loose from
the Union.
The Electoral Colleges of the sev
eral States met last week Wednesday
and cast their votes for President and
Vice President. Blaine and Logan re
ceived 182 votes," and Cleveland and
Hendricks 219. This purely formal
declaration of a result already known
attracts but little attention, domina
ting conventions have usurped the du
lies intended to be performed by the
Electoral College, and a reform that
would do away with this clumsy and
unnecessary system would be gladly
welcomed.
There are now in the Senate 38 Re
publicans, 36 Democrats and 2 Read
justers, Mahone and Riddleberger,
After the 4th of next March the Sen
ate will be more decidedly Republi
can. -Farley, from California, and
Slater, from Oregon, both Democrats,
will be succeeded by Republican Sen
ators. The elections in the other
States that choose Senators next
winter will not effect the relative par
ty representation in the Senate, un
less Illinois, whose Legislature is al
most exactly divided between the two
parties, elects a Democrat in the place
of Gen. Logan. It is possible that
no Senator will be chosen by the Leg
islature elect. In that case Gen. Lo
gan would doubtless have a majority
in the next Legislature. But even
with a Democratic Senator lrom Illi
nois in place of Logan, the Senate for
two years from the 4th of March
next will contain thirty-nine Republi
cans; Mahone and Riddleberger, of
Virginia, who have acted with the
Republicans, and thirty-five Demo
crats. The terms of Fair, of Neva
da, and Mahone, of Virginia, will end
with the Senate beginning the 4th of
March, 1887. Fair, who is a Demo
crat, is likely to be succeeded by a
Republican. Mahone's place may or
may not be filled by a Democrat. If
it isr the two parties will remain in
e same relative strength in the Sen
ate the last two, as they will be in
the first two years of Mr. Cleveland's
term.
"" Mrs. James IT. PolT who 'Is now-
81 years of age, recently speaking of
the time wuen sue was lady, of the
White House, said that she enjoyed
that period of her life, and looked
back upon it after 40 yeare with pleas
ure. She is fond of recalling inci
dents or Mr. Polk's administration,
' and is proud of his career. She says
she regards the annexation of Texas
and the results following the Mexican
war, that is, the acquirement of the
Californias. New Mexico, and all
those Territories so rich in mineral
ore, as some of the most important
' events in the history of this country.
In fact, she thought Mr. Polk's ad
ministration was second to none, and
she would not even except the results
obtained by Mr. Jefferson. She says
history i3 now proving be advantages
gained by these accessions, all due to
Mr. Polk's administration.
It is reported from Chicago that
Mr. Brand is disgusted with politics
and will not contest the disputed sen
atorial seat. In view of the foul
work that, seemingly, was done iu
his name, no homrable man could
take any other course. By contest
ing the scat, the Senator non-elect
would have burned his fingers. As it
is, he may be regarded as "a brand
plucked from the burning."
The organ of the Independents in
Massachusetts, the Boston Ilerald,
seems to jise . to the situation quite
sensibly, when it tells the Indepen
dent Republicans what they have
done in the following words : It must
be understood that the administration
which is to come in by the aid of In
dependent votes is a Democratic ad
ministration. It is understood in Utah that the
first step which the Democrats will
take, when (bey once obtain full
power, will be to ' admit Utah as a
State. This would give two-United
States Senators' and a'dcT"sITghfly to
their strength in the lower House.
The Mormons are all Democrats.

A Good Paper. The Youth' Com-

WASHINGTON LETTER,
Wasihsgton, D. C
Dec. 1, 1884.
"I
At noon to-day both houses of Con
gress were called to order by their re
spective presiding officers, and the
work of the secoud session of the
forty-eighth Congress was at once en
tered upon. Thousands filled the gal
leries, while other thousands, unable
to obtain entrance, filled the halls and
lobbies. For an hour or more be
fore the houses were called to or
der, the scene on the floors was of a
most lively and interesting character.
As Senators or Representatives came
in they were greeted most cordially
by their brother members, and one
could hardly imagine that for more
than five months many of those en
gaged in earnest, hearty greeting, and
the interchange of earnest, honest
civilities, had been charging each oth
er with every conceivable crime or sin
of omission and that in a few days
again, even on these very floors where
so much honest, hearty, whole-souled
welcomes are being extended, they
would be indulging in like charges of
wrong
It is certainly a cause of congratu
lation to know that while political dif
ferences are so great, and the discus
sions of these questions are so bitter
at times, our law-makers do not per
mit these differences to interfere with
their personal relations, and that
there is a generous admiration for
each other existing between manyr if
not all of them.
There are but few changes in either
Youse. In the Senate, the saddest is
that caused by the death of the yen
erable and venerated Senator An
thonv, of Rhode Island, and on the
House side, the man who will be most
missed will be Hon. W. H. Calkins,
of Indiana, who resigned to accept
the Republican nomination for Gov
ernor. He was a conspicuous figure,
embodying not only a perfect ideal of
a man phjsically, but intellectually
and socially.
After the calling of the roll com
mittees were appointed to wait upon
the President, who, a't 12.30, sent in
his message, the reading of which
was at once entered upon, and upon
its conclusion both Houses adjourned.
The reception tendered Gen. John
A. Logan and his most estimable
wife on Saturday evening last, was
one of the handsomest testimonials
to sterling worth, pure patriotism and
lofty public and private character,
ever tendered in this city. It was a
grand ovation paid by their personal
friends, regardless of political opin
ions or prejudices, on their return to
the city. The spacious parlors of the
General's residence on Iowa Circle,
was crowded for two hours or more
by the thousands of those who admire
the General and his wife in all the
walks of lite. They have a warm
place in the hearts of all who have
manly and womanly worth.
Some penny-a-liners here have start
ed the word that the Republican Sen
ate will resist Cleveland s appoint
ments outside of his immediate advis
ers the Cabinet Ministers. This is
the sheerest fol-de-rol in the world.
The Senate will give the new adminis
tration a fair trial, and oppose no
reasonable changes. The right of the
President to put men at the heads Of
bureaus and in the chief offices who
are in sympathy with him politically
is recognized. A determined stand
will, however, be taken by Republi
cans against any attempt to repeal
the civil service law, or to make it pf
no effect, unless a better measure is
offered to take its place.
For the first time since July, 1879,
the monthly public debt Btatem$n
snows an increase. xnis is occa
sioned by the amounts advanced to
pension agents for the December pay
ment, which amounts to $8,000,000,
the December 1st interest nmountJ
which amounts to $2,230,864 and a"
decrease in the receipts for the month
of $4,000,000. The treasury surplus
is $141,000,900.
Maj. Ben. Perley Poore, the veter
an Washington correspondent, ; is
writing a book entitled "Sixty Years
at the Capital." A portion of the
work, which is to be published by a
Philadelphia subscription-book pub
lishing house, is already in press.
Now, if ex-Senator Tabor, of Colo
rado, could be induced to put his lour
weeks' experience in the Senate into
print, with Maj. Poore's book, and
Mr. Blaine's ''Twenty Years in Con
gress, the public would be well able
to judge how different lengths of ser
vice in Washington politics effects a
man.
Last winter Congress appropriated
twenty-five thousand dollars to assist
in defraying the expenses of the cere
monies attending the dedication of the
Washington Monument, and fixed
the 22d -. of February, 1885, as the
time for the event. It appears that
none of our wise legislators have con
suited the almanac, a3 Washington':
birth day next year falls on Sundav
It will be necessary for Congress dur
ing us present session to correct lb
matter by fixing another date. The
cap-stone of the monument will be
set some time during the present week
which will be a substantial completion
oi tne structure. !
The House Appropriations Commit
tee was in session, a good deal of the
time last week, and as a consequence
it nas its worn pretty well advanced
Several bills will be readv. before the
holiday recess, and the remainder will
be presented soon thereafter.
A bill will Boon be lntrodnced in the
House, by Representative Follett
providing for the abolition of thopres-
ent system of deputy marshals: and
supervisors of election. MrFojlett
will also introduce a resolution callins
upon the committee of expenditures
in tne uepartment or Justice to in
vestigate the conduct of United
States marshals and their deputies at
tne late elections in Uhio.
Secretary Lincoln took occasion in
his annual report to rap Chief Signal
Umcer tiazen over the knuckles for
his persistence in going out of his
way in his report and trenching upon
the prerogatives of the War Depart
ment to niae tauits in the manage
ment of the Signal Service Bnrean
If Gen. IJazen were not held in check
a little, he would entirely neglect Lis
own Dusiness and try to manage ev
erybody else's.
A large number of Southern Mem.
bers of Congress will urge that the
usual holiday recess be made to be
gin early enough to permit Senators
ana Members to attend the New Or
leans Exposition. As the time fixed
ior tne opening is the 16th inst., it
would make the holiday recess unu
sually long and weaken the hopes that
many members have of reachine and
transacting a good deal of legislation,
wmcn n is uesireu shall be put through
at this session. Speaker Carlisle has
announced himself as opposed to anv
such early adjournment.
It is stated that the President has
consented to formally onen the New
Oi leans Exposition, and that most of
his Cabinet will accompany him on
that mis-iion to the Crescent City on

West Randolph In Flames.
An extensive fire visited West Ran
dolph on Saturday, the 6th. It caught
in the basement of W. E. Lamson's
furniture store. Tne alarm was
promptly given and Fountain Engine
Co. promptly responded. It was at
first thought the fire could be con
trolled, but the oils and inflammable
material carried the flames into the
partitions and the building was
doomed. It was at once cleared as
well as possible. The adjoining stores
of J. D. Mitchell and N. M. Draper
on the north, and E. A. Thomas, J.
G. Mann & Co., H. M. Wires, etc.,
were cleared out, as it was evident
nothing could be saved. The stores
of Tewksbury & Sons, Samuel Bass
DuBoi3 & Gay's block were hastily
protected as well as possible and in
the end, by hard fighting, saved. The
fire soon spread to the French block
and from that to S. M. Flint's block.
An effort was made to check the fire
on the Blue Store, but without suc
cess. Aid was summoned from North
field, Montpelier and South Royalton.
The Central Vermont railroad prompt
ly sent special trains for these engines.
The South Royalton company, and a
fine one, too, was there in 18 minutes
after leavins home. In spite of all
exertions the flames burned the en
tire square between Main and Pleas
ant streets and Merchant s row, in
cludes the Cottage hotel. The ag
gregate loss cannot be far from $75,
000, and it is a severe blow to the
prosperity of the village, but the bus
iness men are plucky, and the work of
re-buildmg will soon be commenced.
Mr. Dodge, of the Cottage hotel, tel
egraphed for a contractor and archi
tect before his building was in ashes,
and will at once re-build, probably a
large brick house, such as the place
has always needed. He has set a
good example to the other business
men.

During the year of 1882 an aggre
gate of 156,499,000 tons of coal were
brought to the surface in Great Brit
ain, of which quantity. 99,189,000
tons were applied to mechanical pur
poses, and 57,309,800 tons were em
ployed for heating purposes only
The number of tons devoted to van
ous specific objects was as follows
paper making and tanning, , 939,000
tons: water works, 2,191,000 tons
breweries and distilleries, 2,817,000

The most remarkable piece of tel
ephoning yet attempted has just been
accomplished by the engineers of the
International Bell Telephone Co., who
successfully carried out an expen
ment by which they were enabled to
hold a conversation between St. Pe
tersburg and Bologne, a distance of
5.465 miles. Blake transmitting and
Bell receiving instruments were used
and conversation was kept up, not
withstanding a rather high induction
The experiments were carried on dur
ing the night when the telegraph lines
were not at work. I he Russian en
gineers of this company are so con
fident of further success that they
nope shortly to be able to converse
with ease at a distance of 4,665 miles
but to accomplish this astonishing
feat they must combine all the condi
tions favorable for the transmission
of telephonic sounds. If it is found
possible to hold audible conversation
at such extraordinary distances, it is
possible that this fact will be speedily
improved upon, and it will be possible
to converse freelv between London
and New York, and by and by be
tween London and the antipodes.

A Marvelous Story
TOLD IN TWO LETTERS.
FROM THE SDMsK&.'SfcSr
Gentlemen: My father resides at Glover,
Vt. Be has bee a great sulTerer from Scrof

b marvelous effect
Ayer s Sarsaparilla
has had In his case. I think hts blood must
hare contained the humor for at least ten
years ; bnt it did not show, except in the form
of a scrofulous sore on the wrist, until about
live years ago. From a few spots whieh ap
peared at that time, ft gradually spread so as
to cover his entire body. I assure you he was
terribly afflicted, and an object of pity, when
he began using your medicine. Now, there aro
few men of his age who enjoy as good health
as bo has. I could easily name fifty persons
irhp would testify to tho facts in his case.
Yours truly, W. M. PHILLIPS."
FROM THE FATHER:
duty for me to stato to yon tho benefit I
hare derived from the use of
Ayer s Sarsaparilla.
Six months ago I was completely covered with
a terrible humor and scrofulous seres. The
hrfmor caused an btoessant and intolerable
Itehlngi and the Unj1nka so aa to causa
the blood to flowHrf'many places whenever
I moved. My sufferings were great, and my
life a burden. I commenced the use of the
SARSiPAniLLA In April last, and have used
It regularly since that time. My condition
began to improve at once. Tho sores havo
all healed, and I feel perfectly well in every
respect being now able to do a good day's
work, although 73 years of age. Many inquira
what has wrought such a cure in my case, and
I tell them, as I have here tried to tell you,

A Nexo Advance After Half a Century's
Progress and Success.
The Bosten Weeklv Journal, which promises
to enhance in the -year 185 the gtorlins reputa
tion which it has won and worn in tlio past as
the popular and representative iamilv newspa
per ot New England, will be sent to single Bub
scriber for the year at the low rate of one do liar,
or less than two cents a week. No reduction in
quality or quantity.
Ten copies and one extra to the jtel'er UP of a
club, $10. Twenty copies and two extra to getter
up of a club, $20. One copy tree to every ten
subscribers.
The reduction which has been made in the
price of the Boston Journal lroin 9 per annum
to G per annum, and of the ISoston Weekly
Journal from $1.50 per annum to $1 per annum,
making this the cheapest Snm England newspa
per, has been so well supplemented by added ex
cellence in news and talent that the liberality of
the step has been more than warranted in the
reputation and patronage extended. In prool
of this it is only necessary to note how the Uis
tinctive position of the Boston Journal has been
everywhere recagnized in comments and cita
tions during the twelve months past, and how
ttie demand for tho dailv nnd weekly has reached
more than a hundred and sixty thousand in a
single day.
t or a cost oi less than two cents a week the
reader can secure a weekly newspaper contain
ing thirty-six ample columns, giving literally all
the news of the week ; special gleanings and gos
sip of interest to the population of the New
England suites; theindustri.il avocations, agri
cultural, mercantile, maritime, manufacturing
and transportation ; special reports on markets,
trade and labor; timely and valuable informa
tion on financial and speculative prospects;
rambling talks and essays upon home topics, as
well as correspondence from all parts of the
world by our own correspondent of established
repute; ail the vital politic s of the day, abroad
and at borne; congressional matters; spicy polit
icaljottings; vigorous editorials, embodying fact
and opinion on live topics and events; original
stories, poems and sketches, associated press
dispatches lrom all parts; valuable household
information which will be appreciated by all,
and gossip notes on affairs of tashion, literature,
art and society.
Owing to various and manifest causes the year
1S35, as viewed through the mission of the Jour
na I, promises to be of momentous interest; the
Old World foreshadowing strange complications,
and menancing war, pestilence and political up
heaval; the New World, awaking to novel devel
opments and possibilities- it shall be our mis
sion to outline each, and to so proportion the
news and opinion of all as to lit tho perspective
of an intelligent citizen of New England. The
great popular movements in Great iintain, the
remarkable concessions to land tenants, the ag
itation on the franchise bill and the using tide of
feeling that threatens to submerge tlie House ot
Lords will be noted with interest during the com
ing year, as well as the other typical foreign top
ics in which our citizens find what has for their
republic mort than a foreign significance, it is
in our home and political life that the Journal
will be particularly solicitous for ils readers.
The fierceness of tbe national election campaign
in which we have borno no inactive part, the
new aspect of parties and new alignment of par
ty organs seem to have left many at a loss for po
litical landmarks. The Boston Journal has,
hewever, maintained its stability as the only
morning and evening paper in the metropolis of
New England that is au exponent of Republican
ism, anu our readers may look to see it till the
more loyal to those principles which have inten
sified the life of the Kepublic during a quarter of
a century past. The operations in Congress, the
current agitations for trade and tan 11' adjust
ment, the reforms in the civil service and dan
gers of party corruption in the government of
cities will receive the keen and renewed atten
tion which they demand this year. In addition
to these, the relations with our Northern and
Southern neighbors, Cunt! da and the Republics
of Central and South America, particularly the
growing intimacy with Mexico, as stimulated by
the reciprocity treaty and by millions of New
England capitol for railroad commumcati u, will
anora suggestive taemcs ior inquiry anu coin
meat. While giving a systematic aud compre
hensive reflex of all these subjects as recorded
from day to day, the Week y Journal will show
peculiar and intrinsic features adapted to its
readers. The departments specially designed
for the farmers, t aders and householders of
New England, which have been developed dur
ing the Dast vear. will b, still further perfected;
and others which are designed lor tho pleasure
and profit of readers will be initiated. An able
writer on journalism has said that a weekly pa
per often has in it its power to surprise even the
assiduous reader of the daily paper by tbe clear
and intelligent manner in which it can dispose
of the conflicting news and speculations of the
telegraph and give in an orderly and readable
style the residue of fact. This the management
of the Weekly Journal aims to keep in view, and
it shall deem neitner tne oesi graces ot incite
nor the most pleasing form and garb too costl
for the mattcrits readers desire.
In the daily issue a feature will be made of
news relating to an clean sports, ana cut ci tit and
impartial reports of base ball games and other
many amusements in which the general public
is interested will be given regularly tnrougn tne
season.
