?p" Wo are sorry to hear of the prevalence of
euch an alarming form of Diptheria in Green?
ville. It has proven fatal in many instances,
and a great deal still remains, not only in the
town, but in the country, and rather strangely,
iia attacks have not been confined to children,
as is. usually the case, but many grown persons
have suffered considerably with the disease.
95$* The Legislature seems very loath to go
kite- any kind of work, having only the two
qjaestions before them, of reducing the State
debt, and levying the taxes for the present
fiscal year. Both of these subjects they avoid*
but there are strong chances or s heavier tax
levy this year than last They have instructed
our Senators and advised our Representatives
in the United States Congress to support Stun?

School at Yorkviile, S. G. ghis School has
been, in operation since 1855, and now deserv?
edly has one of the best reputations of any
school South, not only for its discipline, but
for the thoroughness of the courses. It is very
moderate in its prices, and Col. A. Coward, the
Principal and Manager, is a thoroughly educa?
ted gentleman, and a very successful teacher.

88r We have received a communication on
the Peidmont Cotton Factory, which we would
advise our readers to notice carefully, as it
shows what is going on in our sister county in
the manufacturing line. This factory has 200
horse powerr and promises to be quite a success,
Having as its President Col. H. P. Hammett, a
fine business man, who has bad a great deal of
experience in? the manufacturing line, and
who, we have no doubt, will make the Feid
mont Company a success. Can't Anderson
Build one also ? This is certainly the best in?
vestment we can make, and the means by
which we can retain our money at home.
Patrons of Husbandry.
The inclemency of the weather prevented a

About four hctndsed bales of cotton were
shipped from the depot at this place on Mon?
day last, but this scarcely made an impression
on the burge quantity still on the platform and
gfooodL We ate glad' to see the railroad com?
pany making some effort to get it removed, as
it is very inconvenient to have it delayed to all
parties, especially to the merchants.

Homicide.
We learn from passengers on the Monday's
train, that a homicide of an aggregated nature
occurred at Walhalla on the Saturday preced?
ing. There seems to have been a drunken tow
between some negroes, in which Mr. Bruce
Breazcale, white, interfered. After a very few
words between him and Lee Hunter, a col?
ored man of that place, he discharged a pistol
at Hunter, which resulted in his immediate
death. Further particulars we have not heard.
The Valuation of Dogs.
Ou reference to the statistics published last
week, it will be seen that there are 2,974 dogs
(presumably, of various breeds,) in Anderson
County, on which the owners are willing to
pay a tax for the support of our benign rulers.
These canines are valued at $8,657, or an aver?
age of less than $1.25 per capita. Now, we
have before us a list of the taxable property in
Laurens County, which shows that there are
3,186 dogs in that county, valued at $15,980, or
an average of $5 per head. What makes the
difference? Are the Laursns dogs more
valuable than ours ? We are among those who
believe that everything Anderson raises and:
produces is fully equal to kindred productions
from any quarter whatsoever, and we are in?
clined to think that the assessment is a down?
right reflection upon the many curs and yelp?
ing hounds of this region. The Board of
Equalization should be empowered with au?
thority to rectify such a flagrant indignity;
upon this valuable species of property. Will j
the Laurensville Herald explain the rea?
son for the over-valuation of dogs in that vi
ciulty ?
Another Chance to Secure Immigrants.
Rev.. Robert Neumann, of Castle Garden,
Jtew York, has recently arrived in rids State
?or the- purpose of ascertaining tbe wants of
the people in the matter of immigration. In
consequeace- of the distress in the North and
Northwest, caused by the-recent financial crisis,
which has curtailed the means of livelihood
for immigrants, and resulted in a dearth of
employment at this time generally, there is a
large number of very desuable German, Irish
and Italian immigrants, who can be induced to
occupy the fields an? industries of the South,
if the proper steps are taken. These people
are all hardy and industrious, and their coming
would be the means of developing the material
prosperity of the South. Such an opportunity
may not occur soon again, when our ci tizens
may put into practical operation the theories
so long urged for the redemption and regenera?
tion of the State, by the introduction of skilled
labor and an increase of the white population.
These immigrants are destined to be distributed
in various parts of tho country, and tbe for?
bidding aspect of monetary affairs, together
with the meagre chance of securing remunera?
tive employment in the North, induces them
to look to the South as affording the most invi?
ting prospects for peaceful homes and adequate
employment for the support of their families.
The hindrances to immigration are among
the things of the past. Falsehood and mis?
representation as to politieal bias of the South?
ern people no longer deter the foreigner from
seeking an asylum in our midst The presence
of an authorized agent from Castle Garden,
the great depot of immigration for the United
States, soliciting aid and co-operation to bring
the foreigners to South Carolina, shows that
the attention of the world is being directed to
this region as affording superior inducements,
and the time ia not far distant when "he tide
will turn towards the South, which will be peo?
pled from all lands and nationalities. Then will
our resources be developed, and in material
prosperity the long-abused and despised South
will regain her former prestige, wielding a
power and influence in the contiol of public
affairs only equalled by the history of the
past.
It remains for our people to begin the work,
and we are glad to know that Rev. Mr. Neu?
mann and others are being encouraged in their
efforts to bring immigrants to our State. In
this connection, we take pleasure in publishing
the annexed address of Maj. F. Melchers, of
Charleston, to the citizens of South Carolina,
setting forth the plan of operations, aud point?
edly affording tbe opportunity of realizing at
once what so many of our people have long
desired, namely, the introduction of farm la?
borers and mechanics from other countries :
Rev. Mr. Robert Neumann, Missionary of
Castle Garden, New York, having come to the
South, under the direction of the Commission?
ers of Immigration of New York, for the pur?
pose of seekiug a new field for the immigrants
arriving daily, is desirous of placing a few
hundred families in South Carolina.
Under the auspices of the German Society
)f Charleston, the undersigned, therefore, calls
apon the planters, farmers, and others, who
lesire to have some of these laborers, to write
immediately and designate what kind of labor?
ers they wish ; whole families or single labor?
ers, Germans or Italians craftsmen or farm
laborers.
Planters who have land for sale at low prices,
who desire to give a portion of their land
free to immigrants, will also please state it, as
i portion of the immigrants have money
enough to start a farm, if they get the land
gratis, or on a long credit.
An opportunity presents itself here to draw
the iong-desired immigrants to our State, and
f all act promptly, several thousand good men
nay come here.
The undersigned is ready to devote his time
For this purpose, and only desires the co-opera
;ion of the citizens of the State.

Loss of the Steamer Ville du Havre.
The public are again shocked by another
lorror in the shape of a great loss of life at
sea. Scarcely has the harrowing scenes of the
shipwreck of the Atlantic faded from our
nemory, with its great loss of life, when the
jicture is again vividly presented to our view,
md each time the consequence of shameful
leglect and carelessness on the part of the
>fficers and crew of the ships?in the first in
ttance, by running against a. rock very near the
shore; this time by running: into another ship.
The sad catastrophe occurred near Cardiff, and
;auscd the loss of ninety-three lives, and so far
is known, only twenty-six were saved I The
Scotish vessel, Loch Earn, was sighted some
iftcen minutes before the accident, but by
some unaccountable carelessness on the part of
;he officer in charge of the Vilie du Havre,
there was a collision, the prow of the Loch
Barn running into tbe centre of the former,
md sinking her in a short time. Aro these
men not guilty of homicide, and would not
their punishment accordingly correct these
dreadful calamities ?
Chief Justice ef the United States.
The press throughout the country does not
seem much pleased with the nomination of
Gen. George H. Williams to fill the place of
Chief Justice Chase. Mr. Williams has filled
the place of Attorney-General of the United
States for some time, and has given very gene?
ral satisfaction, but few seem to think him a
proper person to occupy the chair of Chief
Justice, many reasons being alleged as to the
impropriety. Some think that he has not suffi?
cient ability; some that he lacks in experience;
others, that representing Oregon, he should not
hold so important a position, ou account of the
sparcity of its population. The New York
Sun says: "A selection unfit to be made."
The New York Star: "President Grant has
done many strange things?-but this is the
strangest." New York World: "A piece of un
defensible favoritism." New York Commercial
Advertiser: "Gen. Grant might liave nomina?
ted some other man who would have given
more general satisfaction to the country." The
York Times : "The President has risen above
mere party considerations in filling the post."
New York Express: "A lawyer of greater ex?
perience and professional training is due the
post." Philadelphia Press : "Ho has never
been called a great man, but he has always
been a safe one," &c., &c.
? A letter has been received in Charleston
from an official in Washington, stating that
the national authorities have designated, that
port as the place in which the surrender of the
Steamship Virginias will be reeeived from the
Spanish Government.
The President's Message.
The fifth annual message of President Grant
was submitted to Congress on the 2nd Decem?
ber, a synopsis of which we present to our
readers in thiB issue. It is sufficiently com?
prehensive, and treats of the many topics of
interest to the United States, making various
recommendations and suggestions, and calling
attention to many points to which Congress
should give its early thought and action. The
document shows much reflection and labor,
and whilst not agreeing in all points, we think
many of his suggestions wise ones, and if per?
fected; will bring improvement to the people.
Our space will only allow us to touch on some
of the most important subjects referred to by
the President. He considered the last year,
until latterly, one of great national prosperity,
and hopes and believes that the two great ca?
lamities which have befallen us will soon blow
over, and will leave the country probably in a
better condition than it was. The first of these
which he refers to is the "Virginius outrage."
In this he thinks Spain has been very much to
blame, but also thinks she sees her fault, and
is willing to make full reparation, and believes
the protocol which is now before Congress and
the Spanish Assembly, will be adopted, and is
an honorable settlement of the unpleasantness
of both nations.
The second calamity referred to is the panic,
or stringency in the money-market which has
existed the last three months. This may be a
"blessing in disguise," and he thiuks the great
advantage to be derived from it, is the resump?
tion of specie payments. The President has
his heart fully set on this matter, and if possi?
ble intends to accomplish this object ere long,
believing that all our troubles come from the
fluctuation of currency, and that this will be
corrected by making the basis gold instead of
the credit of the United States. To effect this
purpose, several plans are proposed. Some
think that the United States Treasury should
take up all the surplus funds in the Spring and
keep them until Fall, thus making the govern?
ment keep the money when it is not needed,
and pay interest when it derives no benefit.
The P'resident thinks that the issuing of
enough national bank notes on good security
to meet the full demand for money, would
greatly ease the stringency, and thee redeom
them when they could, as money became more
lax. In this we do not agree. One of the
greatest causes of the depreciation of green?
backs, is the great excess of this currency over
gold and silver coin in circulation; and if the
amount is increased, as a matter of course it is
harder to keep the two at a proper equality,
and we think the only means of obtaining
steadiness in the money market is to stop the
enormous exportation of gold from the coun?
try?to lessen the amount of paper currency,
and for the national government to take strin?
gent measures to prevent this locking up of
the currency at will by certain rings, consisting
generally of large monied corporations. He
thiuks that if savings banks were scattered
through the South, they would greatly assist
the money market, as they would offer suitable
and safe depositories for the wages of day la?
borers. If he were here he would find that
they had less to deposit with banks than any
other set of people, and their indebtedness
generally take it up as fast as they earn it.
The Constitution and amendments should
have prompt and due attention by Congress,
for our greatest bulwark of freedom and inde?
pendence is reposed in it, and if this is not
regarded and kept in proper condition, tyranny
will soon take the place of liberty, and despo?
tism of republican principles. The first amend?
ment proposes a different mode for election of
Presidej I and Vice President. Congress con?
sidered this last session, and refered it to the
Committee of Privileges and Elections to draft
some new method of election. The second is
proposed by the President, and authorizes the
Executive to approve of certain portions, and
disapprove of others, in the same measure
adopted by Congress. We are heartily in
favor of thi6 amendment, for as it now stands,
the President must frequently veto a whole
measure on account of some material fault,
probably but in a single clause, and that por?
tion vetoed will go back to Congress, and if
carried by a two-thirds vote, then it becomes a
law. We hope Cengress will take action on
this. He also desires as a provision of this,
that Congress shall not enact any new laws
during the last twenty-four hours of its sitting,
so that the Executive may approve or veto
these measures understanding^; the third
amendment proposed is in substance, that when
the Executive calls an extra session of Con?
gress, that it only act upon matters submitted
by him in writing to that body. We do not
see the necessity of this being made a constitu?
tional provision, as a law on it wonld be suffi?
cient.
President Grant has very sound ideas on the
bankruptcy laws of the United States, believ?
ing them to be fraught with more evil than
good, and thinks they should be wholly re?
pealed, or greatly remedied during the next
session. He calls again for the general amnes?
ty for the Southern people, and enlarged civil
rights for the negroes.
There are many other points which should
bo noticed, such as the condition of the navy,
the increasing population of the country, tho
admission of Colorado as a State, &c, &c. , but
we will desist this time.
Louisville Courier-Journal.
This iB a first-class newspaper, enjoying a
national reputation and circulation, while its
columns are always enlivened with an unusual
quantity and variety of reading matter, includ?
ing every branch of news, besides original
Btories and novelties. The issue for December
3rd begins a series of lectures on Bible history,
by Rev. Stuart Robinson, D. D., who has re?
vised the lectures, which were originally deliv?
ered in Louisville, for publication. The emi?
nent author is now traveling in the Holy Land,
gathering additional material and making
extensive researches, with a view of extending
tho Beriefi of lectures, which will appear from
time to time. This series is alone worth the
subscription price. Besides these superior
inducements, the proprietors will distribute
$5,000 in presents to the subscribers of the
weekly edition, on the 1st of January next.
We propose to club the Louisville Courier
Journal (weekly) and the Anderson Intelligen?
cer one year for $3.50, which is cheaper than
ever before offered. Subscriptions ought to
begin at once. j

The Piedmont Cotton Factory.
The location of the above Factory is on the
Saluda River, (which is the dividing line be?
tween Greenville and Anderson Counties,) ten
miles below the city of Greenville, and within
one-half mile of the track of tbe Greenville
and Columbia Railroad. The tract of land
belonging to it contains about 600 acres, and
extends to the track of the Railroad, and a
turn-out and depot is to be built upon the land*
The river running through the land divides fit
about in half?one half being in Greenville
and the other half in Anderson County; and
the water-fall where the Factory is to be built
is in about the centre of the tract. The ap?
proaches to the Factory are of easy grades, so
that elegant roads may be made to and from. it.
The water-power is a most excellent one, es?
pecially so in consequence of the abundant
power and the cheapness with which it can be
controlled; and the improvements and build?
ings erected at it will be entirely free from
danger of being damaged by freshets. The
dam across the river, 300 feet long and 5 feet
high, is built upon the solid shoal rock. The
abutments to the dam, which are of masonry ^
are also built upon the shoal rock; and the
canal to convey the water to the wheel at the
Factory, 250 feet long and 20 feet wide, is cut
through the rock, no timber being used in it
until it reaches the pen stock in which the
wheel is placed. The main Factory building,
which was planned by a first-class Mill En?
gineer in New England, is to be built of brick
on a stone foundation, and is 254 feet long by
50 feet wide, and three stories high, with a
basement story on the riverside of the building
254 long and 34 feet wide. There is a tower iu
front, 16 feet square, in which the main stair?
ways will he constructed. There will also be
a Picker-House constructed near the end of
the main building, 50 feet long by 30 feet
wide, two stories high, also of brick on a stone
foundation.
The building has been planned and adapted
to accommodate the machinery which is in?
tended to be put inco it, by the Mill Engineer,
who has been upon the ground, and who has
thoroughly examined the location, and com?
bines all the modern improvements and con?
veniences in the construction of cotton mills,
which experience has proven to be necessary
to tho production of the best quality of goods
at the least cost of production. Permanency
has also been carefully studied, but nothing of
ornament or show. The Mill Eugineer is un?
der contract with the company to furnish all
the plans and specifications for the entire en?
terprise, and to see personally that it is con?
structed in accordance therewith, and to guar?
antee success, so far as the successful working
of the mill and the production of first-class
goods are concerned. There will be no joists
in the building, but at spaces of eight feet
apart there will be a beam across the building.
10 by 15 inches, supported on columns, and
upon these beams a floor will be laid with
three inch plank, and another floor laid across
this, one and a quarter inches thick ; so that
the floor will be four and a quarter inches
thick. The roof is to be of the style known
as tho flat roof, the pitch being only one-half
inch to the foot?by this raeaus there will be
no garret room. There will be 250 windows in
the building, besides doors. The entire build?
ing will be warmed with steam, both as a mat?
ter of economy and safety.
The whole Factory will bo driven by one
turbine water wheel, 70 inches in diameter,
which will take about 10,000 cubic feet of wa?
ter per minute, but as there are at least 30,000
cubic feet of water per minute in the stream at
the lowest water, there is an abundance of
power to drive two or three more factories of
the size of the present one at the same place,
and with the same dam and canal. The ma?
chinery to be put into the factory is as follows;
4 pickers or lap machines; 96 thirty-six inch
Wellman cards; 8 railway drawings; 8 draw?
ing frames, of two heads each; 4 slubbers of
72 spindles each; 8 fly frames of 112 spindles
each ; 7,000 spindles; 4 spoolers of 100 spin?
dles each; 4 warpers; 4 dressers; and 208
looms. Air of the best and latest improve?
ments, so that when completed it will certainly
in all its appointments be the best cotton fac?
tory, constructed to make the kind of goods
contemplated, in the Southern States, if not
in the world.
The Company is considering the propriety
of making standard shirtings and sheetings
upon one half of the machinery, and plaids
upon the other half, similar to the Alabama or
Augusta plaids, but as to this they have not
determined; if not, the whole mill will be run
upon standard shirtings and sheetings.
The product of the mill will be about 10,000
yards of cloth per day, which will weigh about
3,000 pounds, and with the waste added will
require about 2,500 bales of cotton per annum.
The cost of the entire property when com?
pleted is estimated to be $200,000, which is
quite as low if not less than a similar establish?
ment can be built for in New England, as all
building materials and labour is not more than
one-half the price here that it is at the North,
the freights on machinery only being against
us. It wil require about 200 operatives to run
the Factory, who, with the families connected
with them and the employees in the various
departmente connected with the business, will
bring together a population of from 500 to 600
persons, who will reside permanently in the
Factory village. There will also be at the
place, grain and saw mills, stores, &c.
About one hundred hands have been con?
stantly employed upon the work during the
past summer and fall in the construction of the
dam, saw and grist mills, masonry, cutting the
canal, making bricks, quarrying stone, getting
lumber, building houses, &c, aud early next
spring it is contemplated to commence the
construction of the main building and to push
the work forward to completion as rapidly as
it can be economically done.

The Conviction of Tweed.
The recent conviction of Wm. M. Tweed,
indicted for fraud and corruption in office, is
an event of no ordinary significance. He is
now undergoing the just imprisonment imposed
for his willful disregard of the duties belonging
to a trusted official, and an embezzlement of
the public monies on a gigantic scale. Only a
few years ago this man was tho controlling
political magnate in the great metropolis of
this nation, and for a time there seemed no
probability of his grasp upon the public purse
being loosened. But justice, though delayed
and thwarted, overtook him at last, and there
were bold and fearless men, irrespective of
political ties, who pursued him with vigilance
and untiring assiduity, until finally the curtain
falls upon a convicted criminal, entering the
walls of a prison to expiate the awful crimes
and misdeeds against society. The circum?
stances around him make this a notable event,
since he is yet a millionaire, and can count
his gold by thousands. But these are of no
avail, when the righteous indignation of the
people is aroused. The warning in Tweed's
case should be heeded by corrupt politicians
and unscrupulous office-holders all over the
country. Time brings many changes, and the
man who is basking in power and patronage
to-day may be overthrown to-morrow. It was
Tweed's own party, in a great measure, that
secured his conviction. Others might profit
by this lesson, for the honest element of the
country may yet assert their rights, and brush
aside every unfaithful steward of the people.
Even in the South, where men think there is
to be no end of their unbridled corruption, the
fate of Tweed may have an early imitation, in
many instances. We give a full account in
this issue of the exploits and history of the
great criminal, to which we direct attention.

A Drainage Meeting.
A public meeting was held in the Court
House on last Monday. Owing to the Masonic
meeting which took place about the same time,
and other causes, the attendance was slim.
The spirit of the meeting, however, was excel?
lent.
On motion Mr. W. A. Lesley was called to
the chair, and J. R. Glazener requested to act
as Secretary.
On motiou of Maj. Russell a Committee of
five was appointed to draft business for the
meeting. The Chair appointed the following
gentlemen to constitute said committee, viz:
T. A. Rogers, J. G. Ferguson, J. W. Brown,
W. T. Bowen, and Hardy Gilstrap. On mo?
tion Maj. Russell was added to the Committee.
After a short absence the Committee made
the following report as a memorial to the Leg?
islature on the subject of drainage.:
To the Honorable, the Senate and House of Rep?
resentatives in Legislature assembled:
The memorial of the citizens of Pickens
county, S. C, in public meetiug assembled, res?
pectfully shewetk?That there has been a good
deal of sickness in the Southern portion of the
county along the Anderson line, and extending
northward, arising from malaria, produced, for
tho most part, from undrained bottom lands,
lying on the Eighteen Mile Creek, Brushy
Creek, and other streams in the Southern half
of the county,?that we have reliable informa?
tion of an extensive aud alarming amount of
sickness, arising from the same causes, perva?
ding many portions of our sister county (if An?
derson. Realizing the threatened dangers to
ourselves, and sympathizing deeply with our
suffering fellow-citizens of Anderson, we desire
to unite our efforts with theirs, in memorializ?
ing your houorable body, to pass a general
drainage law, as a matter of hygienic and ag?
ricultural public importance ; and would sug?
gest the following conditions as calculated to
effect the object desired:
1. That the Board of County Commissicners,
with two physicians, shall constitute a Board
of Health for each county.
2. That upon the petition of two-thirds of
the land-holders, living on any of the water?
courses, whose lands are to be drained, said
Board of Health shall constitute a Jury of Sur?
vey, who shall view the premises; and if the
drainage of said lancL is deemed necessary or
conducive to the general health, as well as de?
manded as an agricultural necessity, shall or?
der an engineer or surveyor to lay out a route
for the main ditch or canal, through said lands,
having the right to enter upon any person's
land for said purpose.
3. That the said Jury of Survey shall be au?
thorized and required to remove, or cause tcrbe
removed, all natural or artificial obstructions
in streams or water-courses, when necessary for
the purposes of drainage, and at the expense: of
the landholders ; Provided, however, that if the
obstruction consist of a dam for milling oj
manufacturing purposes, the owner of said dam
or dams shall be required, under the direction
of the Jury of Survey, to put in a flood or sand
gate, and keep said gate open from Saturday
evening till Monday morning of each week in
the year, except during the months of July,
August and September. And Provided, furt/ter,
That in any case, where it becomes necessary,
for an effective drainage of said lands, the said
