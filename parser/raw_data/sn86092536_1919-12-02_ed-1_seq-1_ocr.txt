WASHINGTON*. Pec. 1.? The ciivcrn
mpnt'ii note to Mexico, made public here
today at the hour of its delivery in
Mexico City, renews the request for th
immediate release of William O. Jen
kins. the American consular agent Im
prisoned at Puehla. and bluntly charges
Carranza with attempting to becloud
the issue.
In the sharpest language yet ad
dressed to the Carranza government,
and probably more pointed than one
government usually addresses to an
other In a formal diplomatic communi
cation, the United States says it regards
Mexico's plea of judicial reasons * for
not releasing Jenkins as "more ex
cuses,''" and gives notice that it will
not be drawn away from the main fa^ts
and into a discussion of "irrelevant and
unimportant matters."
The attitude of the Carranza govern
ment In the matter, the note says, has
been to "assume a wilful indifference
to the feelings of the American people,
and the conclusion drawn by the gov
ernment la that Mexico has sought te
divert the attention of the American
people and the Mexican people as well
from the fact that I'uebla. second larg
est city In Mexico, is overrun by ban
?, dits, while the civil authorities are
negligent.
STo Ultima torn.
No ultimatum was served! and no time
was given In which this government
expects Jenkins to be released, and
neither was there any statement in the
note as to what the course of the
4|?nericaj> government would be if the
renewed request for his release is de
nied.
! After a conference with Secretary
, l-.an.Mn>; late today. Chairman Porter <? t"
the house foreign aTiirs committee
expressed the opinion that "the state
j department means business this time."
Chairman Porter indicated that lie was
I in thorough accord with the govcrn
; tin nt's j.tvsei t policy in d'-aling with
, the .Mexican situation,
j Chairman Porter was with Secretary
j Lansing with half an hour discussing
the Mexican situation in general, and
later appeared hopeful of a solution of
i the trouble.
Danger to JJ. S.
| "The danger t ? the United States of
t this condition of continual unrest and
?feclim; of hostility toward the United
| States In Mexico." Mr. I'orter said.
, "lies in the fact that it provides a fcr
j tile llcld for anti-American propaganda
t and i von*fur a base ofr attack upon the
I Unit* d States by any foreign country
J that effi cted a combination with Mox
| ico. 1 >y this the spirit, if- not the let*
j ter, of th<- Monroe doctrine would he
violated.
I "Property rights have been violated

j constitutional the confiscatory provi
sions of the Mexican fundamental law
j against which we have taken a strong

where can we stop? Suppose 1 ha/.'I
and Argentina and flormany and otlv-r
nations adoptid such a eonllscatorv law
Our intercuts abroad would be wiped
out.
"Kor three years or more I have icon
firmly convinced that > itlo r nnitcahh

the United States is inevitable. I have
heard nothing here that leads tue to

BEING ADVISED TP ED Oil STRIAE
CHARLESTON*. W. Va.. Pec. 1.?Few j
mines were working In the Kanawha
district today. Reports from the office I
of the Kanawha Coal Operators' Associ- I
ation indicated that there are still S3 j
mines working in this district. The (
secretary-treasurer of district 17 stated j
that so far informaton had reached the
headqu&r.ers of tho United Mine Work
ers that there were only two mines in
thy Kanawha fields open?the Solvay ,
Collieries company's operations and |
I Kingston and Westerly, which have |
been in operation all during the strike !
.owing to contracts made with the com- j
! pnny last summer.
| Secretary T. L. Lewis of the New j
. River Coal .Operators' Association, said ;
I Monday would be a better day in that j
! district than Saturday, judging from '
, reports on hand. On Saturday, the New ?
' River fields loaded 18.ISO tons or |
I per cent of the normal day's loading, i
t These figures came from the official j
j leading sheets of the Chesapeake & Ohio i
; railway. j
Or. Saturday the coal loadings In the |
Kanawha district were estimated at !
i 22.000 tons or about 50 percent of nor- '
mal by the Kanawha Coal Operators' j
! Association.
Sensational Charge,
j "Sixty percent of the mines in the,
Fairmont district are operating today." j
Secretary T. L. Lewis of the N? w River
, Coal Operators' Association said, "but it
is true that some of these arc not work- i
; ing with a full complement of men.
; "The provider^ of district 17, accord- j
| ing to reports coming direct from the,
? Fairmont district," continued Mr. Lewis
I "is in that district today for the pur- I
pose of inducing the men who are work- :
ing to go on a strike.
"It is a fact that the officers of dis
trict 29 in the New River fields are
j openly advising the men to strike in
direct opposition to tin- final decision of

more stringent even than those applied
ilurinc the war. were ordered into effect

Moved hy reports of diminishing coal
stocks ami growing danger of distress
:n numerous sections, the government
sought no compromise with str.king

Local Arrangements.

WASHINGTON", Dee. 1.?Attorney
General I'almrr called upon the Ameri-1
can people tonight to "refuse to be |
stampeded by threats, of lack of coal !
into concessions which will insure un- j
rresor sbl> lugti prices in all commodi- j
lit s for at least throe years to come." |
A statement of the government's at
titude was made by the attorney gen
eral in a telegram io ihe chamber of
commerce at Moberly. Missouri, from
wtin h had come a rciuest that another ?
conference of operators and miners be
called.
upyuDCii VUM*??VOVV.
Mr. rainier opposed further confer-!
etui s. saying the wacc increase propos- I
.1 liy Dr. Garfield equalized the aver- ?
age miner's wipes with the present high i
eost of living without increasing the!
price of coal. This, ho snid, was fair
to the miners and protected lite public.
"The cost of living is now at the high I
point." Mr. rainier said. "To grant the j
demands of the minors would make the !
cost of living still higher. The n?-w j
wage would run three winters, and j
therefore would maintain a higher cost i
of living for sub;-tavJially throe years.
Such a situation cannct be tolerated.
Endorses Garfield Plan.
"In addition to this Dr. Garfield sug
gested a consultative body to investi
gate more completely the whole situa
t.on, to be composed of representatives I
in equal number of the miners and j
operators, nnd to be presided over by i
the secretary of the interior. Such a j
body would investigate, among other
things, the profits of the operators. If .
these should be found' to be unreason
ably high, the public should receive the
benefit in a decreased price of coal
after the miners have had their wages
finally adjusted on a fair basis. I un
derstand this plan is acceptable to the |
operators. If the miners return to work
and agree to this plan, a way would be !
, immediately open for permanent set
tlement.
. Miners Got Increase.
"In the meantime, however, the
operators have posted the advance in
wages proposed by Dr. Garlield, so that
workingmen will immediately receive
the benefit of this increase. The pro- '
duelitdi of co.-.l now closely approxi
ff'y per Vint of normal, and I1
have confidence that a sufficient num- |
l.?-r of miners will comply with the j
v r ites of their government and re-j
sputid to the needs of the people to ?
increase litis production in the near fu- j
lure to a point which will supply the i
demand, if economy and conservation J
in industry are employ* d.
"Any other plan to reopen negotia
tions for new wage scale between the J
miner: and operators would bo futile '
ami v mid delay rather than advance
produeiion. As long as the leaders of j
the miiiers'. organizations believe that ,
lh< ir unlawful strike will force the
public into n rendition ol suffering and
loss which will compel further In
? ?ress'-s of wages, continued conferences
on the subject will only result in influ
encing miners not to return to work.
"Ilio situation calls for the steadfast
..ttppoit by the public of the govern- ?
iin-niV position as announced- by L>r. i
'hull Id. The public should refuse to i
be stampeded by threats of lack ot fuel i
into com-s.-ions wiiiclt w ill insure un-;

POINDEXTER FIGHTS
FOR SOUTH DAKOTA ;
State Presidential Preference ?
Conventions May Favor
General Wood
PIERRE. S. D.. Dm. t.?At the cloM .4
of ft day of conferences and political
activities in connection with the presi
dential preference conventions here to
morrow, Senator . Miles Polndextcr of
Washington, a Republican candidate. ?'-<i
rented a theatre and addressed a mass
meeting in furtherance of his candl- ' ;
clary. . t
Earlier he had charged that four men
controlled South Dakota Republican
polities and were "running things til'?* ,$
suit themselves." This brought a
declaration from Governor Norbeck that .?*
he favored the candidacy of General ???
LponarJ Wood.
"I am \fc r General Wood for two
reasons," the governor said. "First, I
believe in the man: second. I know that
the Republican voters of South Dakota ?
want him." ?..V,ri
The conventions to endorse party
nominees for president will be held to
morrow. and incidentally candidates ftif
state offices, in addition to expressing ">?
preferences for federal offices.
At the outset of his address Senator
Poindoxted declared that leading douto
Dakota Republicans told him "it
useless" for him to attempt to bring his i1
candidacy before the Republican con
vention because the ""delegates word
overwhelmingly in favor of Major G<y^
oral Wood. He discussed the new state
law which provides that state proposal
conventions shall nominate candidates
for the primary election and also md?
endorse "arty candidates for president.
Senator I'oindexted said that, al
though a lawyer, "he could not say that
he und 'rstood it." The law declare)}
that candidates endorsed for office
proposal conventions should discuss is
sues involved with any other candidate
or candidates who seek the office .??"??
independents. nv-TvM
In this connection he suggested that,
as General Wood is considered certain
of csndorsemcnt tomorrow, he t,
ready to return to South Dakota to dUr?
cuss presidential issues with the get!-' i
oral, "should Wood become an avowed iff
candidate for president." ? -
