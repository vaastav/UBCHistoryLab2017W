MERCI rail's INVASION OF KNG
LAND.
General ?Mercier's speech in the French
Senate urging the French Government to
make preparations for the Invasion of
England when that event may be thought
opportune, is a very curious illustration
of French character. ?He gave no reasons
why the preparations should be made ex?
cept that it is entirely practicable, and
that it -would impose upon England the
necessity of keeping herself in the same
state of preparedness for -war that the
Continental Powers of Europe are under.
This -would seem to be a strange way of
proving his case, as it would put England
Into such a state of preparation as would
make the French invasion futile if at?
tempted. The only ray of hope for the
French In an invasion of England, if they
?could succeed in landing troops upon .her
soil, -would ponsist in the fact that France
has an immense standing army always
ready ?or action, while England's military
resources consist in a gallant, but an un
drilled militia. If, however, France is to
take such a measure as -will force Eng?
land to levy an immense standing army
like that of France, what would be accom?
plished by landing one hundred thousand
French soldiers in England? They would
be destroyed before succor could reach
them.
Nin?*ty-six years ago Napoleon collected
at Boulogne Sur Mer that splendid army
of Frenchmen with which he fought the
hattie of Austerlitz. with the intention of
shipping them across the channel ?-hlle
the English fleet was away. But ?Nelson
caught the French and Spanish fleets that
were to guard the crossing at Trafalgar,
and destroyed them, and ?Napoleon, divert?
ing his schemes of conquest from England
to Austria, marched his army suddenly
off to the Danube and inflicted the terrible
disaster of Ulm and Austerlitz upon Aus
ir?a.
Merciers projects -would turn out like
?Napoleon's if he could get the. French
people to seriously consider tljem. The
English have crushingly defeated the
French whenever they have met them in
the last eight hundred years, and this has
been many times, and they will defeat
them again whenever the French force a
conflict. The mercurial, absinthe drink?
ing Frenchman cannot stand -up against
the sturdy, beef-eating Englishman, and
lie will ride for a fall whenever he forces
an issue with the Englishman in the fu?
ture
The [Frenchman's incessant snarling at
the Englishman is like the imitation of a
tice dot; with a big ma-stift However quiet
and unobtrusive lie may be, yet the lice
can never forget that he is a mastiff, and
that fact remains a ?standing injury to the
lice. So it is -with the Frenchman. He
can never forget that he has been pro?
voking contest.?* -with the Englishman for
eight hundred year.-*, and that he has been
ignoxnlnlously trounced whtnever he has
met the Englishman, and that fact rankles
in his bosom. He is like the jittle fellow
that unsuccessfully fought the court-house
bully fourteen times and announced hi.s in?
tention to light him again, saying in an
fcw-r to the remon-strance that he would
be beaten again. "But 111 be getting in a
fair way for a settlement." This seems
to be the Frenchman's philosophy, but he
will never get a ?miement -except by sub?
mitting to his thrashing.
A SEW ???p?.
We printed an Associated Press dispatch
yesterday to the effect that Charles M
Walter, secretary ?,f the Middle-or-the
Road Populists, of Indiana, had issued a
call for a conference to be held at Indian?
apolis December -d. thsx being the first
*"tep, he ?ay.s. in the formation of a new
national party, to embrace all the reform
elements. "This city," said he, "win be'
the cradle of a new r.ahonal party that
will embrace tbe Social Democrats, Silver
Republicans and ?Reform Democrats."
JW*. ?aid the other day, in commenting
on the conference between Mr. William J
Bryan. Mr. ?Charles A. Towne and Mr!
Frederick T. Dubole. that, in our opinion
'.hie conference Iras with a view to orcen
xlaaj such a pajty as Secretary Walter
refers to. It remains to "be seen, however,
whether or not these jrentlemen will take
part directly or indirectly in tne Indian?
apolis conference. OBe that as it may, such
a party will logically be formed, and will
play a more or l?-ss conspicuous part in the
politics of this country. Mr. Bryan and
Mr. Towne and Mr, Dubois belong to that
class of politicians, and they would- feel
more'at home In an 18-karat Populist par?
ty than anywhere els., for they believe in
Government control of transportation lines
and trusts and the extension of the princi?
ple of paternalism as widely as possible.
We do "not say this In harsh criticism. It
is certainly no crime to be an honest Popu?
list, and we always respect an honest
man, no matter how far we may differ
with him. We say that there ought to be
a well defined Populist party In this coun?
try, because ?nere Is a considerable num?
ber of Populists throughout the length
and breadth of the land, and they are
neither at home in the Re'publican party
nor In the Democratic party. They need
a party of their own, and as this is a
free country they ought to have it.
?But we are. unalterably opposed to any
alliances-between the ?Populist party and
the Democratic party, for these two par
tics are, in principle, as far removed as
the east is from the. west. Populism is a
mild form of Socialism, and if there is
anything under the' sun that Democracy
Is opposed to it is Socialism. The Social?
ist believes in as much law as possible; j
the Democrat believes in as little law as is
consistent with the protection of society
and individual rights. Democrats and
Populists can never meet on common
ground, and all attempts to bring them
into affiliation are worse than futile. That
was the great mistake of the revolution
of 1S96. The Democratic party put aside
its own principles, adopted the princi?
ples of Populism, then formed an alliance
with the Populists, and the result is rup?
ture and demoralization.
The only salvation of the Democratic
party is incomplete separation from Popu?
lism and Populists. We want to see the
herding process go on, and so we are glad
to hear that the. ?Populists, Socialists and
Silver Republicans are going to organize
a new party. We want to see them get
together, and we want to see them draw
into their ranks all who believe in their
party principles. ?Next, .-we want to see all
the Democrats get together, and we want
to sec all who believe in Democratic prin?
ciples join that organization. As for the
true Republicans, they are already togeth?
er, and you can depend upon it that they
will stay together. A general shaking
up and sorting out in the political field is
the need of the times, and there are indi?
cations that it is about to 'become the or?
der of the day.
TO THE PRESIDENT'S CREDIT.
"It strike? one,as somewhat singular,"
says the Boston Globe, "that the Presi?
dent can devote seventeen columns to his
annual message _nd yet never mention the
vast laboring masses of the Union, except
in the general way with which we are
all familiar."
For our part we think it is to the
President's credit that he did not indulge
in the usual-political clap-trap about the
laboring man. We yield to none in respect
for the honest workingman. and we want
to see him do well. But we despise clap?
trap and insincerity wherever they ?mani?
fest themselves, and there is more of such
clap-trap and insincerity in connection
with the labor question than any other.
Every politician who makes a stump
speech goes into hysterics about the down?
trodden workingman, and pretends that if
he is elected he is going to do something
'to better ' theWorkjiiigman's condition.
Every political organ talks the same sort
of stuff, and we-have no doubt that self
respecting workingmen have long since
become thoroughly disgusted with it. They
know just how insincere it is; they know
it is for the purpose of hoodwinking the
workingman and getting his vote. We
say that it 15 to the credit of President
McKinley that he did not deal in such
buncombe fiTTiis late message to Congress.
_Why should the President in his mes
sage single out the laboring man and re?
commend that the Government do some?
thing in his behalf? Or why should he
single out the farmer and recommend
that the Government do something in his
behalf." Or the merchant, or the banker,
or the manufacturer, or any other class
of citizens? The "very suggestion is at
variance with the fundamental principles
of this Government. Class legislation is
an abomination, and ought not to be tol?
erated by the people. Let the Govern?
ment hold its hands off, let it open the
way, and give to each and every citizen
the same opportunity that each and every
other citizen has to ?make a living and do
business and accumulate, and the people
will take care of the rest.
HOAV NOW?
Congre?ss is again in session and the
Democrats have strong representation in
the Senate and in the House. Mr. Bryan
said, during his canvass, that if he should
be elected, the first thing he would do
after his inauguration would be lo cal?
Congress together in extraordinary ses?
sion, and that he would then recommend
tbat the ' Filipinos b? given their inde?
pendence and Uie promise of protection
from the United States forever against
foreign Invasion.
It will be In order, therefore, for some
representative of Mr. Bryan in Congress
to offer such a resolution. Indeed, we
shall not be surprised If a resolution to
that effect is offered. But if so, will the
Democrats in good Xalth support it? Are
the conservative Democrats in Congress
now ready to give the Filipinos their in?
dependence, to haul down the United
States flag, to bring the troops home, to
give up the interest that we have in those
islands, and yet pledge ourselves to ex?
tend the Monroe doctrine to that remote
quarter, and, without exercising any au?
thority over the islanders?, give them oui
moral and material support in any diffi?
culties they might have "with the powers
of the world?
We do not believe it. Mr. Bryan's Philip?
pine theory was as visionary as hhr sli?
ver theory and h's trust theory and a!
the other theories of which he has
dreamed. ? The Philippine question is a
practica] question, and it must be dealt
with In a practical way. We said time
and again during the campaign, and we
say it now, that it is simply impossible yet
for the, Government to adopt any specific
and. abiding poiiey towaA tie Philippine
> Islanda. We must ?soh-e the problems as
we come to them one by one.

The following interesting article, which
is in line with some observations of ours
in another coIumn> js from.the Chicago
Chronicle:
"It will Interest Democrats to learn that
tho "Mr. "Washburn, of Boston, who has
issued a call for the creation ?e?f a new po?
litical party whoso main object shall be
the election of Mr. Bryan to the Presi?
dency, is an officer of the national organ?
ization of the People's party, with which
Democrats have recently beeen in affilia?
tion. Mr. Washburn intends to get along
without Democrats in his new party ex?
cept as they may openly and without re?
serve subscribe to tlie principles of his
new reform party.
"Probably this movement rtjsults from
the recognition of the fact that one man
isl'not likely to be the candidate of the
Democratic party indefinitely. Mr. Bry?
an's occupation as a speaker and lec?
turer seems to be ?well adapted to a per?
petual candidacy, and tho temper c'? the
Topulists is such as to make that party a
convenient instrument ?for his purposes..
He can lecture for a livelihood and run for
the Presidency every four years as a di?
version.
'.'It is noteworthy also that Mr. Wash
burn in his pronunciamento refers to Mr.
Bryan as the actual founder of a new
party, and as such declares him to be
greater than any other party organizer
that the country ever has known. Demo?
crats w-ho have been voting for Mr. Bryan
with the idea that he is a Democrat will
find in his frank confession something
to think about. If he has created a new
party and given it principles and aims
different from those o? the parties tha*e
existed before he became a candidate it is
certain that that party is not Democratic
and that many things have been done in a
political way of late under false colors.
"With the affairs of the People's party
Democrats have nothing to do. If that ex?
traordinary aggregation of philosophers.
reformers, financier.-- and statesmen has
really concluded to stand alone the re?
habilitation of the Democratic party
should be greatly simpliii?e-d. i'f it shall
insist upon a monopoly of Mr. Bryan's
time and talents many ?Democrats who
never have supported him will be gratified
and all Democrats who know when they
have had enough of anything will be re?
lieved."
This is all the more significant seeing
that the Chronicle, during the late cam?
paign, gave the Democratic ticket a most
cordial support. But the Chronicle evi?
dently numbers itself among those "who
have ha?l enough of Bryan."

NEW YORK. Dec. 6?"Take home a
?marmoset in a box," might have served
as a travesty on the proverbial "fry" sign
at the fair for..he Mothers' and Bables?
Hospital, which was held at the AValdorf
Astoria yesterday.
'Live stock in the cons?rvatory off the
Waldorf's big ballroom was a new thing.
and a gay crowd flocked to see the "zoo,"
?which was the feature of the fair. There
were rows of cages and pens, which hous-ed
everything from a dove to a donkey. The
"zoo" began at the south end with a robin
redbreast in a cage. There were whydah
finches, African finches, canaries, white
and Java ' sparrows, bullfinches, white
doves, paroquets, Java squirrels and chip?
munk" squirrels..
One row was devotid to cats?prize cats
With silky coats, Angoras, tortoise shell
and white. There were aquariums in va?
riety, mice circuses with white mice, m<_n
keys, marmosets and blooded dogs. Th_?
donkey and many of the dogs were raflled
for in the evening.
?Bonbon, a French bulldog, worth $-00,
with chances at II. was one of the most ap?
plauded dogs. Baby, a fox terrur, won as
many hearts as the marmoset, and an
English setter from the Bloodgood kenneis
rivalled. In the affections of the pretty
girl attendants, a hunting dog whom they
affectionately named Rubber.
The "zoo" presented at all times an ani?
mated, scene.
"Take a chance On a Cocker spaniel?"
cried a girl in a _*ale green gown, and
when the. patrons refused, she wailed.
"Oh. wh3' won't you?"
The children who were at the bazaar in
hordes thought that X.ah's Ark had come
to life.
"How old are these cats?" demanded a
(smail Miss in black velvet, and when the
keepers of the "zoo" plead ignorance, the
youthful connoiseur departed scornfully.
The orchestra played softly all the af?
ternoon, accompanied by the gentle music
of the donkey, the monkey and the paro?
quet.
BET OX RUBY'S WEIGHT.
Louis A. Berney. ? diamond dealer, paid
a visit to John Daly's resort at Long
Branch iti August. 189!", and made a bet of
?100 even with William L. Marks about
the weight or" the ruby in the Iatter's ring,
which was valued at {5.000. Berney had
little cash at the time and as security for
the $100 put up a valuable ring containing
a diam?n?, ruby and sapphire.
Marks, who resides at the Arist?n. Xo.
1730 Broadway, insisted that he won the
bet?which was that the ruby in his ring
did not weigh two carats?and he retained
possession of Berney's ring. 'He subse?
quently sold it to a politician of this city
for ?TS.
Berney sued 'Marks to recover the ring
ot* its value, which he placed at $213. The
action was tried before Municipal Court
Justice George 1?\ Roesch yesterday, who
gave a decision In favor of Mr. Berney.
but. after listening to experts on the value
of diamomi? and precious stones fixed the
value of the ring at $175.
?MOLASSES ADCLTEILVTED.
Immetiiate action will bo taken by the
Board of Health to discover if adulter?
ated] molasses is being sold in the city.
This movement is the result oi an agita?
tion in behai'f of pure molasses that is
now going on in Xew Orleans.
Little di the pure article reaches here,
according to wholesale dealers, who say
there is no demand for it except from a
few grocers. (Nearly all ask for the atlul
terattKl article and sell It for the pure.
Glnco.se is tti3 most used adulterant. There
are, however, brands of molasses that
are highly bleached With poisonous chemi
cais.
According to the latest report of the
Department o? Agriculture in Washing?
ton??, great part of the molasses output
is adulterated with glucose, sorghum and
other agents. To make the molasses
light in color it is put through a bleaching
process w-hit'h requires the use of per?
oxide di hydrogen, bone black, sulphur?
ous acid, metallic sulphites, sulphuric
acid; sulphur fumes. ' chloride of zinc and
other chemicals.
"Molasses?," as sold here, is nothing
but glucose syr?p with a tlavoring of mo?
lasses, lt L" sold fi.r from eighteen to
twenty-one cents a gallon. The pure ar?
ticle retails for about thirty-five cents a
gallon. There is less profit In it than in
the spurious article, so the retailers buy
the latter.
At the office of Henry R. Hobart and
Company, .wholesale dealers, at No. 120
Front Street, I was told that there is
comparatively little demand for the pure
morisse..
"Wo sell the 'mixed' article to nearly
all our customers." said one of the rirm.
"Of course, we. have the pure molasse.-,
bute there is comparatively little demand
for it. The mixed is simply a prepara?
tion of fifty per cent, glucose and mo?
lasses, lt is harmless and most consum?
ers do' not know the difference, ln my
opinion, fully ninety-five per cent, of the
molasses that is sold here is adulterated.
Only the highly colored or ?bleached ar?
ticle is harmful. We do not handle ?t.
The reason the retailers prefer the mixed
molasses is that there is more profit in
lt.
BOER'S COM ENG.
On the outskirts of New York city a
colony of Boers is to be established.
Seventy families, who have resolved not
to live under trie ?British flag, are to form
a settlement between Hicksville and Syos
set, in Nassau*county.-and apply to the
richer farm lands there the industry that
has enabled them to win sustenance from
the barren African'veldt.
A tract of land which will permit the
allotment of from five to twenty-five acres
to each of ?the seventy families has heen
purchased by the committee. A member
of tha real estate firm yesterday con?
firmed the fact of the sale, but declined
to enter into details of the amount of
l_nd involved or its exact location.
The first members of rhe colony are
expected to arrive here on December 2.v':h,
coming by way of Delagoa Bay and Mar?
seilles. They will be followed soon by the
other.??.?
