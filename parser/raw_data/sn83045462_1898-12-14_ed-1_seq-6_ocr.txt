I h. I nited States gives th ? world an
earnest of its intentions toward th. n-w
ix ssessions ami an evidence of its nliil.ty

acter ..r th m-n It is sending to th. m for
official sendee. They are men of tlior.uigh
training and of long experience. Th-y
have acquit! i| themselves here at home in
posts i f difficulty and importance. They
are imbued w ith the spirit of their country.
They go in uniform and to adminlstei
military gov rnment. hut not a government
of tyranny or of corruption. The civil
rights of th- people win not he abridged ,.r
imperilled by them. They well understand
and sine, rely respect all the differences be
tween the civil power and the military
power, and may lie relied upon, while rep
resenting and exercising the latter, r.ot to
treat the former with the slightest indig
nity.
Will not this in itself go very far toward
solving -he n w problm? It ought to.
Spam s difficulty, both in Cul>a and the
Philippines, gr.-w out of the bad govern
ment she imposed upon the people and the
unscrupulous agents she employed to ad
minister it. Ther* is no reason to believe
otherwise Her greatest trouble were in
' uha. and the Cubans are not by nature a
turbulent people. They rebelled bjcause
their country was never permitted to bene
Ht by any potty that was adopted for it.
Corruption ru.ed both in the courts and at
the customs houses. A bribe was a certain
Masport to official notice, and. provided it
was large enough, to official favor. Are
th-re any people anywhere possessing spirit
and self-respect who would not rebel
against such conditions?
Am-rican control means the obliteration
of all that. The welfare of the people will
ba th. first consideration. The Cubans are
to benefit by Cuba's progress, the Porto
Ricans by Porto Rico's progress, and the
Fi.ipinos by the progress of their archi
p>-ago. The courts and the customs houses
will be clean, and corrupt officials reaching
cut in every direction for plunder will not
infest the land.
Is not this reasonably certain to produce
confidence, and that, in turn, gratitude and
co-operation? ls there any reason to beli-ve
that Cul?. Porto Rico, or the Philippines
will be a hotbed of insurrection after their
ills hav? been cured and their people prop
erly r membered?

Mr. Bryan-the title of colonel scarcely
fits him now?acts with celerity. The wry
day he lays down the sword he takes up
the pen. and in effect announces his re
sumption of political leadership. He like
wise immediately heads for Washington,
and upon arriving here will, of course,
confer with his supporters ami lieutenants
about th. line of policy to be adopted.
His own id.-a Is that the issue with the
administration should be raised after and
not before the peace treaty has been dls
po"...i ,lf advocates ratification of the
treaty, holding, very correctly, that only by
means may we hope to take the whole
matter into our own hands for settlement
Then he proposes raising the question of
f*mm^nt for the new possessions. Con
gres* is to reaffirm its resolution as to in
dependent government for Cuba, and add
to that ? dec.aratlon of like imiM.rt respect
in* l'orto Rico and the Philippines. He
echoes Mr. Hoar's cry of no vassalage
People must not be held by force by this
government. Governments derive their Just
powers from the consent of those who ^,re
governed.
I his is high l>m delicate ground for Mr.
an to take. Nothing could be clearer
thm-i that the government that Cuba, l'orto
Rico and the Philippines is to enjoy under
the American tl.,g will be infinitely superior
t.. that which was provided by Spain. What

to IS former subjects. And as they
' se in the sca.e it is certain to be toward
prater blessings. Put how about the hun

The House aixi rate exchanged com
pliments yesterday which the people of the
District dimply appreciate. The House
pas>?*d in short order the annual appro
jrt-i *tton bill, thus sending it to the Senate
before rhe holidays, which, during a short
?ettk>Q. is a feat of considerable conse
quence Th* budget is now in go?.nl shape
for that process of increase in the Senate
which is annually to be counted upon to
brii.g 'he measure more nearly to meet the
?eed* of the capital in its growth. Al
though the bill as it stands is larger than
?ver before In its present stage, it is yet
below the current law and still further be
low next year's real requirements. iiy
thus placing tlie District bill in the hands
of the Senate at the head of the procession
of the regular supply bills its chance of a
full consideration is increased and corre
spondingly the chance of hurried, unsatis
factory work upon it itf the fu^ end of the
session is decreased.
While th) House was thus affording the
B*-nate an opportunity to do its share to
ward the District's growth by giving it an
early "go" at the appropriations, the Sen
ate was passing the bill for the erection of
a municipal building for the District. Thus
the two project? crossed each other, going
in opposite directions. The reasons which
operate to applaud the promptness of the
House in handing the budget over to the
Senate are equally in force in connection
with the municipal building bill in the
House. That measure reaches the District
committee early in its session's work and
it ought to be put in good shape for con
sideration before the session's legislation
shows s?*riotis signs of congestion.
The bill is of prime importance to the
District and represents a serious need
which is perhaps appreciated by every rep
resentative who has ever had occasion to
visit the municipal offices. Such a visita
tion could not tail to convince even the
most economical legislator that the Dis
trict should long ago have been provided
with decent accommodations of its own for
the transaction of th? public business. The
moneys r?aid out for rent have thus far
mounted up into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars, approximating the sura which it
is now proposed to spend on the construc
tion of a new building. As a business prop
osition this bill should appeal to every
member of Congress.
Hut there is something more than busi
ness principles behind the bill. There is
necessarily a certain sentiment which sug
gests the incongruity of maintaining an
establishment of the importance of the Dis
trict offices in a hired house, inadequate
in -ize and appointments and a standing
cause of mortification on the part of the
public-spirited citizens. Visitors to Wash
ington are shown the Capitol, tho White
House, the departmental buildings, the Li
brary and are impressed with the grand
eur of the spectacle. They are then, per
haps, if the humiliation cannot be avoided,
shown the District building and are told
that therein are housed the offices of the
capital city's government. The government
ar.d the District can well afford jointly to
erect a municipal office which shall be as
great a credit in its way as the Library, as
great a convenience as the proposed Su
preme Court building.
Spain, the Elaine and the Message.
Spain demurs at the reference to the loss
of the Maine in the President's message and
.promises to appeal to the powers to right
a wrong which she claims has thus been
done to her. She is. as usual, wholly in
the wrong in this attitude. She should and
probably will find no sympathy abroad in
her complaint. President McKinley was
confronted with the task of presenting to
Congress a history of the events of the
congressional year. The greatest item of
that record was the war with Spain and
no view of the case can possibly obscure
the fact that the destruction of the Maine
in Havana harbor was a factor of first con
sequence in hastening if not in actually
causing the outbreak of hostilities. The
President's survey of the facts would have
been grossly incomplete if it bad not in
cluded the fact of the appointment of a
court of inquiry and its finding. It was
due to posterity that this phase of the af
fair should have been set forth in its proper
relation.
That court found, after exhausting all
the means for inquiry at its disposal, that
there was overwhelming evidence that the
battle ship had been destroyed by an ex
plosion from without. The court did not go
further, to ascertain or to guess by what
agencies this explosion was caused. This
/item did not really lie within its field of in
quiry. It .sufficed for the country to know
that the ship was not. as the Spanish au
thorities claimed, destroyed by an acci
dental explosion within her hull. When
that fact was presented, with proof that
appealed to every mind as conclusive, the
nation arose and proceeded to the task
which it had for some time hesitated to
undertake. Unquestionably ninety-nine of
every hundred Americans fully believed
then, as they believe today, that the de
struction of the Maine was a treacherous
crime, committed by persons unknown, but
certainly Spaniards.
Spain now contends that the President
has gratuitously insulted her by referring
to the disaster in his message as an ad
judicated fact. She proposes a commission
composed of neutral ag? nts who shall in
vestigate the loss of the ship and tix the
responsibility. Tho objection to this pro
cedure is that the United States cannot ac
cept the work of such a board under the
circumstances unless it shall take up the
matter where the court of inquiry left it,
and, acting upon the assumption that the
court's finding was proper, seek to ascer
tain the exact agency which caused the
outside explosion. To submit to a board so
constituted and inspired the initial question
of whether the explosion was exterior or
interior would be to cast discre dit upon the
body of naval officers whose verdict has
been accepted by this nation and has been
made by the people one of the causes of
war.
The people of this country are satisfied
as to the fact. They would be glad to
know who pressed th. button which ex
ploded the mine which destroyed the Maine
and killed American seamen and officers.
They would be glad to know, in addition,
just how far this deed was countenanced
by Spanish officials, either personally or
officially. They do not ask for further pun
ishment of this crime. But in the name of
justice they would welcome a complete ex
position of the facts. They will not, how
ever, repudiate their trusted investigators
by conceding the right of any body of neu
trals, however constituted, to inquire into
the question which they have answered so
emphatically.
V Temple of Justice.
The Senate's action yesterday in pass
ing the bill providing a site for a new Su
preme Court building was a logical se
quence of the recent fire at the Capitol
which nearly destroyed the law library and
files of priceless records. Senator Morrill,
on whose motion the bill was passed, has
long urged this measure, as he for many
years contended for the new Congressional
Library building. The splendid success
which has been achieved through the lat
ter effort warrants the belief that the
House will be ready now to listen to the
appeals for a counterbalancing structure
north of the library site to accommodate
the badly crowded and insufficiently housed
court. It seems now more probable than at
any previous time for many years that the
government will 8<*m pr?>ceed with this long
delayed work of providing a proper house
for its highest court. Should Senator Mor
rill succeed in pressing his bill through the
House and should the building be con
structed within his lifetime?an event which
is to be fervently desired?he will have
wrought for himself a monument, or rather
a i?air of monuments, which will speak elo
quently of his fame for decades to come.

The Office Iuvestittatlon.
Senator Vest has apparently abandoned
his project of securing a joint Investigation
into the Washington post office construc
tion. as proposed by the resolution offered
by him last week. Yesterday he offered
another resolution, in the same terms,
which provides for an investigation by the ,
Senate committee on public buildings and \
grounds alone. The Senate passed this
resolution today. In view of the shortness
of the present session, it is probable that
positive results will be secured by this
method more certainly than by the other,
although the latter has the advantage of
Involving both houses in whatever Is un
dertaken In this regard. The building: as it
stands palpably needs close scrutiny, espe
cially as It may be accepted as a type of
the work which has been done and is being
done elsewhere by the supervising archi
tect's office. It is advisable that the gov- j
ernment's legislators learn the lessons |
which this structure teaches as soon as
possible, to guard against repetitions of the
errors which are complained of in this case, j
as well as to repair whatever blunders may ;
have been committed here. To this end it
is desirable that some responsible body
should get at work at the earliest possible
moment to .sift the facts and the charges
connected with the building and to ascer
tain the truth. If there have been mal
administration, bad workmanship, im
proper practices, inadequate designing, in
competent supervision and the like, the
sooner the public and the Congress know
about it the better. Authorized to pro
ceed before the Christmas holidays the Sen
ate committee on public buildings and
grounds will have over a full month in
which to conduct the inquiry, if that time
should be necessary, and a month further
in which to formulate the disclosures, pre
pare a bill correcting the faults discovered,
and to press for action by both houses to
meet the emergency which uiight thus be
created. For such purpose the Senate com
mittee can work alone as effectively as the
two committees working jointly, if the
House will accept the findings of the Sen
ate committee.

A National Anniversary.
From the New York Mail and Express.
The recommendation which President Mc
Kinley wrote last in his message, as if to
gi\>} it additional emphasis, is one to pio
vide for the fitting celebration, in 1900, of
the centennial anniversary of the founding
of the city of Washington as the perma
nent capital.
The act locating the capital was approved
July 1?>, On September is, 171KJ, Presi
dent Washington laid the corner stone of
the Capitol with Masonic ceremonies. In
May, IH00, the archives and personal prop
erty of the government were moved from
Philadelphia to Washington. Ail there was
of Washington at the beginning of the cen
tury was the still unfinished Capitol, the
President's house, the condition of which
roused the housewifely indignation of good
Abigail Adams, and a few straggling build
ings ut Georgetown. Nevertheless, on the
assembling of Congress in the new build
ing on November 17. 1800, President Adams
sent a message full of cheerfulness ami
congratulation, closing with this fervent
invocation:
"May this territory be the residence of
virtue and happiness' fn this city may
that piety and virtue, that wisdom and
magnanimity, that constancy and self-gov
eriynent, which adorned the great charac
ter whose name it bears be forever held in
veneration! Here and throughout our
country may simple manners, pure morals
and true religion flourish forever!"
The centennial anniversary of this inter
esting historical event ought to be marked
by a fitting celebration, and the Presiaetn's
suggestion has already resulted in a bill
which has been presented in the House by
Mr. Dingley, and in the Senate by Mr.
Hoar, making a proper appropriation for
the purpose, and providing for the appoint
ment of congressional committees. The
President also appropriately suggests "the
establishment of a handsome permanent
memorial to mark so historical an occasion
and to give it more than local recognition."
The recommendation should be all that is
needed to carry the bill to enactment.
