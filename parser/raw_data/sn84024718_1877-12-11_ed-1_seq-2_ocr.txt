■vatiTe Nominating Caucus.
ENRY C. ALLEN OF SHENAN
SOSIINATED FOR SPEAKER,
onservative members of the
Delegates met in their Hall
Tuesday night to nominate a
i for Speaker of the House ol
i. Dr. E. C. Robinson of Nor
elected chairman, and P. H.
>f Pulaski, Secretary. On tht
c roll, 02 members answered,
'alker of Northumberland of
i fejilowjng resolution, whicL
nof Mr.Hardesty of Clarke,wa>
He table by a vote of 60 to 32
cd, That all members of thi
if Delegates who were electee
ition to the regular nomine©
onservative party be exclude<
rti'cipation in the conferences o
servative members,
raves of Bedford offered the foi
which on motion of Mr. Hai
Clarke wss also laid on the ta
ved, That all members of th
of Delegates who are not tru
natives, are respectfully requeste
s from this caucus,
aucus then proceeded with tli
3 of nominating a Speaker,
'owler placed before the caucus
ie of Judge Allen, and spoke at
n eulogy of him.
Idmunds, of Halifax, in a glow
highly-eulogistic speech put In
tion Maj. Marshall Hanger' foi
ition of Speaker. In doing so
led to that gentleman's known
ations for the position, and urged
that he had filled the place for
S acceptably to all the members,
,t at no time more than the pres-
Virginia need such an officer.
Coghill, of Amherst, made a
speech seconding Mr. Hanger's
ition. He said that Mr. Hangei
pon the platform, and asked il
lUlen could do more. He had
■utchfield, Sheffey, and Kempei
Speaker's chair, and would say
r. Hanger as a presiding officer
ual to any of them.
Ficklin, of Buckingham, express
self as being in favor first of Mr
;, but learning that that gentle
yould not be a candidate foi
r, was glad to give his support
, Hanger. He intended to go
as any gentleman honorably
in the matter of re-adjustment
i not forthat reason see why ht
go against Mr. Hanger—whost
is, integrity, and parliamentary
could not be questioned.
Col. W. W. Henry of Richmond ably
supported the nomination of Mr. Han.-
ger, and in the course of his remarks
effectively pictured Mr. Hanger presid
ing over the last State Convention, ane
bringing order out of chaos there, and
asked that this faithful servant be prop
erly rewarded.
Speeches in support of Hanger were
made by Edmunds of Halifax, R. A.
Coghill of Amherst, J. B. Ficklin of
Buckingham, C. A. Bohannan of Mat
thews, W. W.Henry of Bichmond, and
John Echols of Augusta ; and in sup
port of Allen by Isaac C. Fowler ol
Washington, James Barbour of Cul
peper, T. G. Popham of Rappahannock,
H. H. Harrison of Sussex, and Dr. S.
H. Moffett of Rockingham.
The vote resulted in the nomination
of Allen by a vote of 52 to 46.
The first act of the re-adjusters was
thus to deprive the State of the services
of Maj. Hanger as Speaker, who is uni
versally acknowledged to be one of the
best who has ever filled that position.—
He was defeated because he was in favor
of paying what Virginia justly owes.—
"Aristides the just" was ostracized by
Ihe Greeks. Human nature is about
ihe same in all ages and countries, and
heace history so frequently repeats it
self. The defeat of Hanger for the cause
which produced-that result, is the flne-t
compliment which could be paid him,
1 tit it is a reproach to a majority of tbe
members of the House of Delegates, and
will tend to impair the credit of the
State.
Important Legislature.
As the Lynchburg Virginian says,
the present Legislature will, in some re
spects, be the most importaut that has
assembled.sinco.the war. Elected with
the expectation that it will devote itself
to the institutien of a system ofthe most
rigid economy, with a view to relieving
the people of unnecessary burthens,
while, at the same time, it guards the
honor of the State, its action will be
scrutinized with uncommon vigilance.
'I'he people are in no mood to tolerate
idle and indifferent representatives, nor
to view them wasting time and spend
ing money to no purpose. They are ex
pected to re apportion representation on
the minimum basis suggested in the
constitutional amendments, without re
ference to the interests cf ambitious gen
tlemen who may seek to be returned.—
Besides, the interests of the State de
mand that the debt question shall be set
tied—settled not only in such a way as
will take it out of party politics and de
prive demagogues of the aliment upon
which they feed, but settled in a man
ner to preserve the honor and credit of;
the State. Whether all the men elected |
to this General Assembly are as thor
oughly imbued with the importance ot
itiese subjects as they ought to be, re
mains to be seen ; but we hope that the
press, the honest press .of the State, will
keep ai\ eye on them, and let the people
know who are faithful and who are
l.iitbless to duty in this supreme hour of
ihe State's trial and extremity.

from the new apportionment made by
the Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion: The total school population is
483,701, and the total apportionment is

Another Brakeman Killed.—On
1. c Western Division of the Ches. &
G.iio Railroad, on Wednesday last,
Chas. M. Johnston, a brakeman, fell
b'tween the cars and was killed. On
Tiiursday night his remains were taken
to Charlottesville where they were
buried from the Baptist Church on Yri
(Uy. He was a brot ler of Mr. Albert
.1.-ljnston, Clerk at tne Central Hotel in
Cbqslottesville,
Judge TYilliani McLaughlin.
This eminent Judge closed the full
term of his Court iv Augusta on Wednes
day last, after a laborious session of about
thirty-five days. In that time he entered
about five hundred decrees, (more than
a fourth of which were final,) and dis
posed of every case on the law docket
which was ready for trial. We may
say, indeed, that he swept the docket,
for there were but two chancery causes
in his hands which were not decided ;
and these were retained because they
involved important principles w,hich
'were also in issue in a suit in Rock
bridge, which was set for argument at
an early day. He, therefore, retained
these causes, that he might have the
oenefit of any new lights, which might
iie thrown on the matters at issue by
the discussion in that case.
"\\i._ri Judge McLaughlin assumed,
his seat en the bench, he found the
docket of Augusta county encumbered
by hundreds of old causes, which had
been instituted nearly half a century
ago in the old district Court of Chance
ry, formerly held at Staunton. He had,
therefore, not merely to dispose of the
current litigation, but to encounter this
immense mass of arrearages of business
which had accumulated in the old Chan
cery Court. It was a Herculean labor,
but he has accomplished it by close and
We understand that since Judge Mc-
Laughlin took his position on the bench,
he has rendered over seven thousand
lecrees and decided law cases almost
without number.
The bar of his Circuit being able,
teamed and vigilant, his judicial action
iias been subjected to the closest scruti
ny. Appeals have been applied for in
Umost every case where the unsuccess
'ul party thought there was a reasona
ble chance of reversal. Yet, we under
stand that of the thousands of decisions
that he has made, not more than
seven or eight of his decrees and judg
nents have been reversed, and in most
>f them there was divjsioij among the
Judges of the Court of Appeals.
This.speaks well for his judicial tal
ent and accuracy. To a sound discrim
inating judgment, he unites a quick
perception, a wonderful memory, and
laborious habits of investigation. It
would seem that he neve? forgets any
thing. The decisions of the Court of
Appeals are always fresh in his memo
ry, and when he once examines a cause,
ill tbe facts and principles involved re
main indelibly imprinted on his mind.
En the discharge _of his judicial duties,
be is not only prompt, industrious and
tble, but all his action is characterized
by strict impartiality. Truth and jus
dee ai\> his only aims. His opinions
aie brief and terse and always to tht
point. No one ever knew him to makt
any.ambitious attempt at display on th<
bench. He gives his decisions, and his
reasons for them, in the fewest words
' consistent with clearness of expression
Such a judge is of incalculable valut
to any circuit, for, so long as he hold;
a position on the bench, the people have
an assurance of the prompt, faithful
and able administration of justice.
As Judge McLaughlin's term is now
' about to expire, we believe we expres:
the opinion of ninety and nine out o
every hundred of the people of Augusta
when we call on the Legislature, by at
unanimous vote, to re-elect Judge Mc
' Laughlln to the position which he ha:
' occupied *'or the last seven years, witl
so much honor to himself and advan
1 tage to the public.
Meeting of Re-adjusters—Secession from
the Meeting.
Saturday, just after the adjournment
of each house of the General Assembly,
and before the members had dispersed
the Cterk read a call for a meeting of
the re adjusters, tobe held in the hall
of the House at ~X o'clock. Shortly be
fore 8 o'clock that night the hall was
crowded. There were present members
of both branches and both parties, to
gether numbering about one hundred
and twenty-five, and many spectators.
Senator C. T. Smith, of Nelson—the
lime fixed for the conference having
passed and no motion towards organi
zation having been made—called the as
sembly to order and nominated for
chairman Senator Quesenberry, of Car
oline. The question was put by Mr.
Smith and declared carried.
At that moment Mr. Barbour, ad
vancing up the middle aisle nearly to
ihe Clerk's desk, behind which Mr.
Smith stood, demanded to be heard.—
He said that he had endeavored to gain
the attention af Mr. Smith before the
vote was taken, but had failed. His
purpose was to remonstrate against
any such proceedings as "had taken
place, and to say that this was intended
to be an adjourned meeting of re-ad
justers ; that it was called according to
agreement by the chairman of the re
adjusters' former meeting held at the
Exchange Hotel on Tuesday evening;
that Mr. Harrison, of Sussex, was that
man, and the proper party to call the
conference to order; and that he hoped
the gentlemen not in sympathy with
the cause would not interfere with or
obstruct their business.
Mr. Harrison, of Sussex, said that
this meeting was called upon his notice.
It was intended to be not a caucus of
the Conservative party, but a meeting
of the Conservative re-adjusters of the
House aud the members ofthe Senate
entertaining the same views. It was a
couferference of the Simon-pure read
justers, and it was his province to call
it to order, the first conference having
adjourned subject to his call.
Senator Smith claimed to be a re-ad
juster; elected by his people as such,
and honestly believing that the public
debt of Virginia ought to and could be
re-adjusted.
Mr. Smith requested Senator Ques
euberry, who had been elected chair
man, to take his seat, but he deslared
that, under the circumstances, he would
not do so. He then nominated sue
cessively Speaker Allen, Dr. Moffett,
aud James Barbour, who all declined to
act, the latter declaring that Harrison
only had the right to call that meeting
to order. After considerable sparring
and excitement, some one moved to ad
journ, but Mr. Smith said th meeting
could not adjourn, because it had not
been organized.
A call was then made for tbe Sjmon
pure re adjusters to retire to the Ex
change Hotel, and as they went out
great disorder reigned in the hall.
The seceders met in the old billiard
room and were called to order by Mr.
Harrison. Mr. Fulkerson was elected
permanent chairman, and Messrs. Rob
inson of Norfolk and McCaull of Pu
laski were chosen secretaries. The pro
ceediugs were private ami the members
of the Press excluded.
After the withdrawal of ths secedefs,
those who remained organized by the
election of Senator C. T. Smith as
chairman and Mr. Hairstou us secre
tary.
Mr. Brooke of Fauquier said that he
was greatly perplexed to know what
course to uersue. .He was a read
juster, and had been invited there
to meet other readjusters, aud knowing
'that there jy.ere several significations of
—STAUNTON SPECTATOE AND GENERAL ADVERTISER.—
that term he thought the object ofthe
conference was to ascertain the various
views with the purpose ofharmoniz
ing them. Upon arriving he found
everything in confusion. He found a
large party leaving the hall, they
claiming to be tbe onlyj Simon-Pure
readjusters.
Mr. Brooke, while an uncompromis
ing readjuster, didn't know that he
agreed with them ; didn't know their
opinions at all. He thought that it
would have been better for ail to remain
together, at least until there had been a
comparison of views, aud then, if ne
cessary, they could have retired with
ciean hands. Mr. Brooke procedeu to
explain his own views, and expressed
a wish to hear othirs; it to be under
stood that no binding action was to be
taken.
General Talieferrro said that they
were placed in a peculiar position.
They had been invited to meet the re
adjusters there, and those who invited
them had gone off and left them. It
was a violation of Virginia hospitality.
It was as if they had beeu invited t» a
man's house and the host had gone off
and left the guests.
Mr. Smith called Mr. Koiner to the
chair and offered several resolutious,
which, however, were not acted upon.
General Echols said he was placed in
a very unpleasant position, as his case
was somewhat similar to Mr. Brooke's.
He deeply regretted the steps taken by
the gentlemen who had withdrawn from
this meeting. On a good many points
he agreed with those who had with
drawn, but he was in favor ofa confer
ence of all the Conservative members,
and he would remain in this meeting
I otilv with tlie understanding that he
should not be bound by anything that it
might do. Before he concluded to be
come a candidate for the House he wrote
a letter to a very prominent banker of
the city of New York for the purpose of
learning if the bondholders would re
ceive a proposition looking to the adjust
ment of the public debt. His answer
was that the banker coujd speak for the
northern gentlemen who held a large
portion of our bonds, and that he was
satisfied that the Europeans would do
likewise, and would enter into an ar
rangement by which they would be able
to obtain an interest of three and a half
or four per cent, per annum.
General Anderson said he expected
when he came into this hall that there
would be a conference of all members of
the Conservative party, and there would
be a general expression of opinion in
reference to the adjustment of the debt-
He gave his views'ahout the same &s ex
pressed in the platform.
General Anderson offered the follow -
i Resolved, That a meeting of all mem
bers of the General Assembly- in favor
of using ail houorable means to bring
about a readjustment of the public debt
be CijUpd to meet in the hall of the
House of Delegates at ? X o'clock P. M.,
■ursday next, for the purpose of
ring on that subject,
resolution was adopted.
Dispatch says; The trouble of
Saturday night was rather the result of
misunderstanding than of any studied
design. The notice for the meeting, as
read iv the House, did not have Mr.
Harrison's name to it. It did not state
that it was an adjourned meeting Qf re
adjusters. It did not indicate the pur
pose. Many thought that it was for the
nomination of State officers, and people
of all parties and of all readjustment
shades of opinion believed they were ii>

The Governor's Message.
The last annual message of Gov. .las.
L. Kemper was presented to the Gene
ral Assembly on Wednesday last. It is
an able and well-written document,
and of considerable length, and would
occupy about ten columns of one space if
we were to publish it iv full. As but
few would take the time to read a docu
ment of such length, and would prefer
a synopsis, we avail ourselves of that
furnished by the Baltimore San as fol
lows :
Tbe Governor commenced his mes
sage with the declaration that there is
cause lor profound congratulation that
the worst evils possible to befall the
State from any human source have been
successfully tided over and says the evi
dence cannot be resisted that the future
of Virginia is full of hope. He adverts
lo the fact that iv Juiy, 1869, the polit'-
oal restoration of Virginia was consum
mated by the acceptance by the people
ofa constitution which, however other
wise obnoxious, yet restored to them
selves the control" of their own govern
ment, and censures what he terms "new
and disastrous policies" fastened upon
the Common wealth : First, that of di
vorciug the State government from the
; control of the public works, by which
not only were the best assets and secu
rities of the public credit squandered and
sunk, but auother disastrous result is
that the main arteries of internal com
merce have been surrendered to a con
trol which is alien if not uufriendly fo
the development of Virginia's own
marts of trade.
Secondly, Governor Kemper niain
taius'that another, if not equal injury,
resulted from the passage of what is
Known as the fuudiug bill, which, he
declares, "deprives the State of all con
troi over a large portion of its annual
revenues lor more than the period of
the present generation." Under tha op
erations of tlieseuew policies the t.iover
uor say* nothing less than extraordina
ry cautiou, economy aud vigilance has
sufficed to meet current expenses, to en
force the laws, and to hold society to
gether. These troubles have been en
hanced by the monetary panic of 1873,
which locked up ihe inadequate circu
latiug medium, increased the hardships
of taxation and hindered the collection
of taxes, and inevitably postponed the
financial restoration ot the State.
ln estimating these difficulties Gov.
Kemper ihinks there is cause for rejoic
ing that Yirgiuia has struggled success
fully through them all and he saye he
speaks deliberately and advisedly in
affirming that the worst is over.
For more than a year the great mone
tary panic has been steadily and visibly
receding. The taxable values and an
nual revenues give every promise of
continued aud progressive improvement
while iv all pratieable directions, and,
as far as the existing laws permit, the
public expenditures have been corres
pondingly reduced. During the last
tour years not only have ihe public
scoo'a and charities been maintained,
law ami order upheld, avid the authori
ty of the government preserved in its
vigor, but the sum of §5,275,053.42 has
been paid on account of the State, and
the outluuk for tbe future is encouraging.
While alarming conflicts between capi
tal and labor have shaken the founda
tions of society elsewhere no ripple of
lawless exoitemeut lias disturbed any of
the currents of business in Virginia.
The receipts I'roai laxatou tor the fis
cal year IS7U 7 were $2,505,387.17, whilst
the average for the last eight fiscal years
would have been greater but for tne
difficulties iv changing lrom one system
of liquor taxation to another, the tax on
consumption by the new process having
oeeii suspended for a cousiderable period
in a federal court. The disbursements
for the year were §2,505,357, as follows:
Expenses ot the government, §007,303;

ernment for the last fiscal year was less
than tor any year since the constitution
took effect, aud less by §88,583.08 tliau
tlie average aunuai expenses of tne last
eight years on the same account, and
this despite the fact that the criminal
expenses, which are wholly beyond exe
cutive control, have continued to in
crease in an extraordinary manner.
Gov. Kemper says that of all the va
garies and extravagances of the period
we live iv none exceed the misippre
hetisions which have obscured the tiuau
cial condition of Yirgiuia. "It is," he
says, "to be deplored that interests so
complicated, sensitive and sacred as
those of State faiih and credit should
ever be bedraggled in the ephemeral
excitements of personal und partisan
politics. Tne principal sum ofthe debt,
the ai rears of interest thereon, and
the annual deficiency iv tbe treasu
ry, have all been subjects of the wildest
exaggeration ; while the market value
of the public bonds has been depreciated
and Ihe popular mind bas been discour
aged try miscalculations as to the ability
of the Btate to carry its debt, which are
in the ltfst degree erroneous, fanciful
aud extravagant."
Tbe Governor then recapitulates the
State debt, which he says at the begin
ning of the preseut tiseal year was:
Principal, '529,350,810.70; arrears of in
lerest since the passage of the funding
bill, and which coiistitutes so much
non-interest bearing debt, §4,188,141.33,;
total debt at begiuniug of present fiscal
year, $33,538,958.00 ; the entire debt as
sumed by the funding bill was §30,478,-
-040.40 ; increase of debt in six years
§3,01i0,2|(i (}'); showingati average yearly
increase cf only §510,216.00; The
State yet retains several interests
iv internal properties other than the
water line, which if sold and the pro
ceeds invested iv the new funded bonds
of the second class would retire $1,900,-
-000 of the existing debt, leaviug the out
standing indebtedness of the Slate $31,-
-038,058.
Gov.'Kcnper contends that it is as
clear as mathematical demonstration
that if thi? Legislature shall leave the
general features of the preseut revenue
system untouched, meiely correcting
patent defects in matters of detail, the
current revenues of the State treasury
wiil hereafter suffice to pay full interest
in the future on the entire outstanding
debt, and then gives the reasons for this
opinion. The adoption of bieuuial leg
islative sessions alone reduces the Stale
expenditures §100,000 perauuum, bring
ing the annual deficiency down to §410,
030.10. The balance ot thjt revenue, the
Governor says, needed to cover this re
duced deficiency is already guaranteed
by tlie new revenue measures devised
by the Last General Assembly. The
method now iv force for taxing tbe con
sumption of alcoholic and malt liquors
is an experiment which its authors have
not claimed to be free from defects, and
although more time is required for giv
ing it full aud effectual operation in
many portion* of the State, yet the re
turns already made demonstrate beyond
questiou that, upon the obvious defects
of the measure being corrected, the in
creased revenue to no derived from it
cannot fall below a half million of dol
lars annually. This is no conjectural
estimate ;it is the result which is irre
sistibly proved by the actual working
of the new system under many disad
vantages.
"it is not to be supposed," Governor
Kemper says, "that either creditors.or
others will hereafter seek to renew the
idea, long since exploded, that Virginia
will ever become liable for the debt of
West Virginia, or for any part of it.—
Assuming that at tho close of the war
the two Virginians were joiutly and
severally bound for the whole of the
original debt, nevertheless, by the ex
press terms of the funding-bill contract
as acceded to by the creditors, Virginia
can never become liable for any part of
'West Virginia's third' except by virtue
ofa settlement hearafter to be conclud
ed between tlie two States. Clearly and
unquestionably such a settlement is im
possible to be fydd without tbe co-opera
tioq ami assent of Virginia. 1 1 we ever
become iiable for any part of the debt t
thus remitted to West Virginia, then it
will be no otherwise than by her own
voluntary act that Virginia will incure
that liability. Until the coming of the
millennial era, it may scarcely be sup
posed that one State will volunteer to
assume the burdens of another State."
Gov. Kemper reiterates at length the
opinion, wliich he has in severrl messa
ges endeavored to enforce, that however
unwise and unfortunate the passage of
the funding bill, yet "the contract em
bodied in it, and executed in pursuance
of it, is inviolable and irrepealable, and
it is the bounden duty of all to stand to
the decision of the highest State court
affirming its validity," and he contends
that "any further agitation for the pur
pose of invalidating it is a wrong to the
good name of Virginia, and an injury
to every interest of her people." He,
however, vindicates the motives of those
who act upon opposing opinions, and
declares that there|is not and there nev
er has been any organized party of re
pudiation in Virginia. Excepting an
almost inappreciably small class of
thinkers, the great body of those who
resist the execution of tbe funding bill
bave no idea of resisting tbe payment
of the debt. Gey. Kemper declares that
no device or subterfuge, however inge
nious, designed to obstruct a particular
provision of tbe funding bill, could be
regarded with less disfavor by the judi
cial mind than an open and direct vio
lation of the contract it contains. Any
measure, of whatever kind, intended to
impair the receivability of the coupons,
would be regarded as impairing the ob
ligation of the contract, and would be
met with the condemnation ofthecourts
ail the more decisively on account of
its indirection.
The Governor says it is happily de
monstrable that no necessity can arise
in Virginia, even under tbe plea of self
preservation, to evade the operations of
this law. If the debt proper of each
1 State be aggregated with its municipal
and local indebtedness, a comparison on
that basis will show that, relatively to
' population and resources, the people of
Virginia owe less than those of many
other States. It will be found that the
rate of taxation in this State ia less than
in almost all others. Even if the new
method of taxing liquors should yield
no increase of revenue, still the defi
ciency in the treasury would be covered
by a sum equal to a tax of ten cents on
the 100., or of thirty cents on each
inhabitant ofthe Commonwealth. The
allegation that the State cannot main
tain Its existence and carry its debt is
not only wholly unsupported, but con
clusively contradicted by the facts.
Tbe remaining objectors to the fund
ing bill are those who assert that Vir
ginia owes no debt, using as an argu
ment that the State has been conquered
by arms, and that the conqueror, haw
ing dismembered it aud destroyed more
than half of its taxable values, has be
come liable for its ante-bellum debts.
To this Gov. Kemper interposes the
argument that assuming Virginia was
conquered by arms, its autonomy was
destroyed; tlie conqueror reinvested it
with its original powers of raisiug reve
nues by taxation, and restored to it the
very improvements and properties
which represented the consideration of
its debt.
The Governor refers to the conference
with the pubiic creditors of the State,
held November 10, 1874, at which the
creditors consented to postpone one
third of the interest on the debt for ten
years. "This Legislature failed to act on
the oropositiou, and the debt agitation
has since gone on with increasing inju
ry to the State. The Governor thinks
the same concessions would be tendered
now, th< ugh the necessity has passed
away, as tne condition of the State, he
claims, has improved and will continue
to improve. Moreover, a readjustment
which is feasible and honorable, and
which is far better than auy heretofore
proposed, can now be had. So soon as
the State shall proceed to pay, as it can,
full current interest on the debt—so soon
as its ability and its will to continue
such full paymeutshall be made evident
to the financial world—Gov. Kemper
bas assurance that then a loan may be
negotiated at lour per cent., and in a
sum sufficient for retiring the wnole of
the debt. By taking this direct road to
readjustment tbe burthen of the debt
will be diminished one-third iv a way
consistent with the traditional reputa
tion of Virginia.
Gov. Kemper suggests various statu
tory and constitutional reforms by which
the taxes may be reduced. He says tne
accounting business of tbe government
has run into needless enlargement aud
complication, aud the capital is over
crowded with unnecessary officials and
employes ; lie would have the clerical
force materially cut down, and the re
mainder paid at the cost fixed for cor
responding work by the fair competi
tions of private business. He suggests
a special commission, with authority to
employ the best experts and practically
to reorganize the departments at the
capital.
Among other heavy burthens on the
treasury, which can at once be reduced,
are tho=e imposed by the peuitcntiaiy
and the lunatic asylums.
Tiie annual criminal expenses last
year aggregated §177,M0, against (65,429
annually for the ten years preceding the
war. The Governor thinks it may be
proper for the State to pay the expenses
in felony cases, but there is no good rea
son why all other criminal charges
should not be borne by the counties and
corporations; aud, if this change be
made, it is safe to assume that the crimi
nal charges will be so reduced by local
influences and interests.
Gov. Kemper says in his judgment it
is as practicable as it is desirable to re
turn to the ancient and honored county
court system of justices, originally ap
pointed and commissioned by the exe
cutive, themselves filling vacaueies in
their own body and serving without
pay.
A stringent revision of the revenue
system is urged. In permanently re
forming it, care should be taken to lodge
the power of appointing commissioners
of tbe revenue either with the auditor
or the courts. Tlie appointment of a
State board for equalizing the assess
ments of lands is also recommended.
The Governor says if the oyster beds,
which are absolutely the property and
ungranted domain of the Common
wealth, are not to be preserved and tax
ed as other property, then they should
be disposed of at once, either by lease or
sale. He also says the school system is
the creation of organic law. The con
stitutional obligation to maintain it is
not questioned. In all of his official re
lations to that system he has endeavored
to support it fairly, efficiently, and in
the spirit of its founders. But if it is to
override all other interests, however
momentous or sacred; if the claims ofthe
school department upon the funds' in
the genera! treasury constitute a lien
paramount to every other; if the exist
ence of the goverment, in an emergency,
is to be dependent upon the leniency of
that department, then tbe sootier it Is
shorn of its dangerous supremacy the
better.
an Incident of the Flood. —The
Richmond State relates the following:
"An old colored man named Sidney,
who was living in a little cottage near
Granite, above the city, went to his
roost Saturday night in blissful ignor
ance of the heavy torrent which was
sweeping down from Lynchburg, and
in the night, while the old man slept,
his house was floated off. Luckily it
was lodged against some trees in the
river, and was not dashed to pieces.—
When the occupant —he was alone —
woke on Sunday morning he looked out
from his ark and thought at first that
he was Noah, but when he found that
he had no animals, and no wife, and no
sons and their wives in the ark, he
thought he wasn'„ Noah, but was some
body in an awful bad fix. Then Siduey
commenced to pray and sing, and every
now and then call "for help. But there
he remained, with the rushing, roaring,
billowy James all a,ro;ind him, until
Tuesday, when some boatmen rescued
him. He says he had little or nothing
to eat, and that he spent the lonely time
in fasting and prayer."
Marriage License obtained by
Perjury.—John B. Graves was before
the Police Court of Richmond, last
Thursday, charged with committing
perjury in making oath before the clerk
ofthe Hustings Court that Annie Eliza
Humphreys was over twenty-one years
of age, for the purpose of obtaining a
marriage license to marry John E. May
bush, who was also arraigned charged
with subornation of perjury. Both of
the parties were sent on to the grand
jury.
