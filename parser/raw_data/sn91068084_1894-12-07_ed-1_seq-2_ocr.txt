Those who do not subscribe
for the Fishkrmax & Farmer
will soon be asked to do so. Our
list of city subscribers is large
but by no means as large as it
ought to be.
A newspaper is one of the chief
necessities of every town, but a
newspaper cannot prosper unless
it is encouraged and liberally
patronized by the people.
The Fisherman & Farmer
has been published ovci eight
years. It has managed to liye
fairly well, but it has not receiv
ed the encouragment and pat
ronage it has deserved.
We have had much to discour
age us, many difficulties with
which to contend, and a long and
patient struggle, but with hard
work we have manatred to sur-
vive while others have failed.
We have faithfully advocated
Democratic principles, have la
bored earnestly for the upbuild
ing of the town and with earnest
endeavors have done all in our
power for the promotion of every
interest of the city and its people.
Now. friends, we ask you to
give us your hearty co-operation
and support. With it we pledge
ourselves to make the Fisiikr
max & Farmer a more credita
blc representative of our town.
If you are not a subscriber then
you should at once have your
name placed upon the list; if not
an advertiser you should feel it
a duty to patronize us in this
way thereby helping yourself
as well as natronizintr one of the
enterprises of your town.
We need money with which
to carrv on biu iness. and we ned
your support.
Shall we have it, or snail we
not?
lulenton must have factories
if it wishes to prosper. Factor
ieswill briu"-wealth to both the
town and surrounding country.
Why not some of our monied
men make a start in that direc
tion ? There are many small
industries that would flourish
here.
Too long have the advantages
of Kdenton been ignored. Too
long have we boasted of our ad
vantages and then waited for out
siders to develop our resources
11ns should not be so. We
should be willing to make good
our protestations by our deeds.
Now let s make a start. Home
capital should at once organize
and establish some industrial en-
. " ATM -lit' 1
o c- -
and inviting, others will come,
and soon the city will grow rap
idly in population, in commerce,
in industrial enterprises and in
manufacturing importance.
We must go forward with
greater strides.

Congress convened 011 Monday
last. The Presidents Message
is a very lengthy document and
covers a great variety of subjects.
Closing his message the Presi
dent expresses a desire to co
operate with Congress in perfect
ing any legislation that tends to
the prosperity and wellfare of
our country.
The next General Assembly
of North Carolina will convene
011 Wednesday, Jan. 9th, 1S95.
Its political complexion will be:
Senate 23 Populists, 17 Re
publicans and 10 Democrats.
House 47 Democrats, 40 Re
publicans and 38 Populists.

BROWN'S IRON BITTERS
Harry Skinner's majority over
Branch is 2,964, he having re.
ceived 16,510 votes and Branch
13,546 so declared by the State
Board of Canvassers.
The nominees for Chief Justice
led their respective tickets. The
vote for Shepherd is 127,593 and
for Faircloth 148,434, making
the latter's majority 20,841. The
total vote cast is 276,027. Two
years ago the total vote was
280,500. The falling off in the
vote was not so great as was
thought. Justice Shepherd came
in 8,000 votes ol getting as many
votes as did tov. uarr. ine
Republicans and Populists two
years ago polled 143,524 votes.
They thus gained this year 5,000.
Thus two years ago 2,457 votes
were cast for the Prohibition
candidate for Governor, while
this year the Prhibitionists had
no candidate. Walter Clarke
got 272,970 votes, or 4,000 less
than the total cast.
In Wayne county, the home of
Marion Butler, Democrats are
being boycotted. The princi
pals of Mt. Olive and Pikeville
schools havinir voted the Demo-
1
cratic ticket, their Populist pat
rons have withdrawn their child
ren and say that Democrats must
look to Democrats for their sup
port. They are even withdraw
ing the amounts pledged to Uieir
pastors thus carrying the feeling
into the churches.
SUGGESTING REFORMS.
Wilmington St3r.
The Raleigh News and Obser
ver of Thursday last contained a
paper by Judge Clark, of the Su
preme Court, suggesting laws
that ought to be enacted by the
Legislature of North Carolina
and by Congress. There are
nine of these suggestions.
The first favors the passage of
a law by the Legislature limit
ing the rate of interest for the
use of money to six per cent.
The second favors the prohi
bition of railroad passes or tele
graphs francs to State officers or
members of the Legislature, as is
provided for in the new constitu
tion recently adopted by the State
of New York.
The third favors the adoption
ofa constitutional amendment
providing for the election of U.
S. Senators by the people.
The fourth favors the owner
ship by the Government of the
telegraphs and telephones with a itics from the party in power
view to making them a part of 1 and thusth solidity of the 111a
the postal service, and the con- j chine would be broken,
ueetiou of the postoffices of the 1 There is much to be said in
country by telephones. j favor of the election of post
The fifth favors the election of
postmasters by the people
The sixth favors a change in
the election laws of this State
and recommends the establish
ment of at least three polling
places in each township, to save
time, thus securing a fuller vote,
at less expense, and quicker re
turns, thus tending to prevent
fraud and contributing to a better
expression of the will of the peo
ple. The seventh recommends some
changes in the criminal law to
expedite trials of criminals and
to insure justice. He contends
that under the laws as framed
now the guilty man has too many
chances for escape and thus so
frequently escapes, the result be
ing resort to lynch law by the
people, who have lost confidence
in the courts and have become
weary of the law's delay and fail
ure. The eighth suggests that the
Judges of the Courts be given
supervisory power over the
length of speeches by counsel,
thus saving time and much 'ex
pense to attendants upon the
courts and to the State, as was
formerly the case in this State
and is now in every other State
111 the civilized world, he says,
except Iowa, where when coun
sel begin to address the jury the
judges go out and play billiards.
The ninth suggests a code com
mission, not simply to codify the
laws of the State but also the
opinions of the courts, which are
quoted as law, thus simplifying
the law and condensing it into
a few handy volumes.
He gives reasons for all of
these suggestions, which will
command attention, the last three
especially on account, if nothing
else.ot the judicial position which
he holds, and his opportunities
for ascertaining and studying the
defects of our judicial system.
In advocating the election of
post-masters and of United States
Senators he symply gives expres-
siontoa sentiment which has
be;n growing and eainiup-l
strength in this country for some I
years. It has grown so strong j
as to have been indirect;, adopt- j
ed in some iustances both as to !
Senators and postmasters. In the j
State of Illinois, and we think
one or two other Western States,
the people in their conventions
express their choice for Senators
and the members elected to the
legislature are thus instructed
and feel bound to vote in accord
ance with the will of the people
whom thej' represent as thus
expressed.
It is only a question of time, if
there should be no constitutional
amendment' providing for an
election by the people, when the
Illinoise method will be gener
ally adopted, which will be prac
tically an election by the people,
for it amounts to an instruction
to the members of the Legisla
ture. It has made so much progress
in the case ot postmasters that in
many instances appointments
have been made on the strength
of the greatest number of names
presented by applicants, other
things being equal, and in some
instances it has been decided to
let the contest be settled by elec
tion. The petitions which applicants
get up and carry to Washington
with them are nothing more or
less than a form of election, the
citizen simply signing his name
instead of casting his ballot, the
difference being that the petition
with the most names on it might
be pigeon-holed if it didn't suit
the Senator or Senators who
manage these things, while if
election were the method the
candidate having the largest
number of votes would go in, and
couldn't be froze out by a Sena
tor who couldn't control him or
didn't have any use for him.
Those who look to civil service
to reform the governmental ma
chinery would find this one of
the very longest strides in that
direction, for it would at once
take out of the hands of the ad
ministration that comes into
power the appointment of 70,000
postmasters and the dismissal of
that many more regardless of the
fitness of the appointees or of the
incumbents removed.
There would also be 70,000 men
less running to or sending peti
tions or advocates to Washington,
and that much very expensive
and wearying and vexatious
work taken off the hands of the
President, the Postmaster Gen
eral and his assistants, and that
much time saved for them to de
vote to the duties of their offices
which ordinarily require all the
time they can find. Then the
service would not be as partisan
as it is under the system of ap
pointment, and could not be
made a part of the political ma
chine as it has been and will be
while the postmasters hold their
places as a gift of the party
manipulators. They practically
control all the postmasters ap
pointed which means that the
party in power controls 70,000
postoffices. But under the elec
tive system many districts might
have postmasters of different pol-
j masters by the people and also
of the election of U. S. Senators.
