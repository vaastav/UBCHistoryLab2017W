There has been, however, a substantial com pit •

j :U, The progress made during (he list vear in

I est is very gratifying. The amount of t per

to N.*v. £l. (STS, is SUKV*tMMXk and H per cent
bonds, i\mmoly known as u an equal
amount have been, orwi l be, redeemed as calls
mature. It has been the policy of
tin; department to place the I per
cent, bond* within easy reach of every Citizen
who desires to lnve-t his savings, whether small
or great, m these securities. Ihe secretary ot
the I eusnry recommends that the law bo s ,
niodihed that small sums may ho invested, ami
that through tin; poatolflces or other agents of
the government, the freest opportunity may he
given in all parts of the country for shell Invest
ments. Thu host mode suggested is that the de
partment ho authon/.ed to Issue certificates of de
posit of tin- denoininalion of £lO, hearing Interest
at the rut: of :| litj per cunt, per snnuiii. and eon
vertlhle at any tune within one year after their

ported hy suitable regulations, wo ild enable any
person, readily, without cost or risk, to convert
Ins money Into an luteresl-hanrlng security
of the I tilled Rimes, and the money so
received could he applied to the redemption of
the <1 percent, bonds. The coinage of gold dur
ing the last fiscal yi ar was fad VhH lIKO, tip- coin

In clrciilalion, and the balance gH.Mgp.tiOZ is still
in the possession of the government. With to
ganl to the art tinder which the coinage of silver
proceeds, It has been the purpose of the secretary
to faithfully execute tin; law and to atlurd a fair
trial to the measure. 11l the present financial
condition of the country, I sin persuaded that the
weilare ol legitimate business and industry of
every description will bo best promoted by ub
staining from all attempts to make radical
changes In existing fiiiiimlal'leglsJutiou. I.et tl
be understood that during the coming year the
business of the country will lie undisturbed hy

i tribes and of that branch of the public service vv Inch

I Hens with their neighbors fnendly and peaceful,
j two local disturbances have occurred, which were

} confined to a comparatively small number of hi
-1 duns. The discontent among the Hatmock* win* I*
: led first to some a-ts of violence on the part of
j some members of the tribe and finally to
lan outbreak, appears to have been
! caused by an uumrtieiency of lo**d on the rcserva

the inadequacy of the appropriation* made by
I emigre** t v lb** want of the Indians at a time
I when the Indiana wort; per vent eil from supplying
i the deficiency by burning. After an arduous pur
! suit by the troops of the United States, and sev
: era! engagements, the hostile Indians were re
duced to subjection and the Urger part of them
• surrendered * themselves as prisoners. In this
connection I desire to call attention to the ree
ommemflilloii made by the secretary of the lute
rlo . that a sufllcler t fund be placed at the dis
posal of the executive, to be u-ed with proper ac
countability pt bis discretion, fn sudden emer
gencies of the Indian service. The oilier case of
disturbance was that of the abandoned Northern
i hev.-lines, who suddenly left their reservation
In the Indian Territory and marched rapidly
through the States of Kansas and Nebraska in
the direction of their oi l hunting grounds, com
muting murders and other crimes on their way,
From documents accompanying the report of the
secretary of the interior, it appears that a disorder
ly hand was as Hilly supplied with the necessa
ries of life as the 4 Too oilier Indians who remain
ed quietly on the reservation and that the dis
till ha nee was caused by men of a restless and
mischievous disposition, among the Indians
themselves. Almost the whole of this hand have
surrendered to the military authorities, and it Is
a gratifying fact that when some of them hud
taken refuge In the camp of the Itod flood Sioux
with whom they bad been on friendly relations,
(lie Sioux held them as prisoners and readily
gave them up to the olllcers of the fulled Mates,
thus giving now proof of the loyal spirit which,
alarming rumors to the contrary notwithstanding,
they have uniformly shown ever since the wishes
they expressed at the council of Sept 1877, had
been compiled with. Both the sec
retary of the Interior and secre
tary of war unite In the recommendation
that provision he made hy congress for the organ
ization of a corps of mounted Indian auxiliaries,
to he under the control ol the army and to be
used for the purpose of keeping the Indians on
their reservations and preventing or repressing
disturbance on their pint I earnestly concur in
this recommendation. It is believed that the
organization of such a body of Indian cavalry,
receiving a moderate pay from the government,
would considerably weaken the ruthless element
among the Indians by withdrawing from it a
number of the voting min and giving them con
genial employment under the'government, it
being a mullet of experience that the Indians in
our service, almost without exception, tire faith
ful In the performance of the dalles assigned ti
them. Such an organization would materially
aid the army in the accomplishment of a task for
which its numerical strength Is sometimes found
| InsiitHcient. But while the employment of a
lorce lor the prevention or repression of Indian
iron hies is of occasional necessity, and wise
preparation should bo made to that end, greater
reliance must be placed on humane and civiliz
ing agencies for the ultimate solution of what Is
called the Indian problem. It may be very dill!

unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the re

of societies specially interested in the subject has
recently met at Baltimore, and facts developed,

EDUCATION.
The report ol the commissioner of the bureau
of education shows very gratifying progless
throughout the country in all the interests com
mitted to its care. Of this important office the
report is especially encouraging, with respect to
the extension of the advantages of common
school systems in sections of country where the
gtuerai enjoyment ol the privilege of free schools
is not yet attained. To education more than to
any idher agency we are to look a
the resource for the advancement of
the people in the requisite knowledge
and application nf their rights and respimslhlii

the enactment of appropriate measures by congress
for the purpose of supplementing with national
aid local sysleinsof education in the several states.

The attention of congress is again invited to
the condition of the river front of the city of
Washington. It is a matter of vital Importance
to the health of residents of the national capital,
both temporary and permanent, that the low
lands in front of the city, now subjec
to tidal overllow, should tie reclaimed,
in their present condition these Mats obstruct the
drainage of the city and are a dangerous source
of malarial poison. The reclamation will im
prove the navigation of the river by restricting
and consequently deepening its channel, and is
also of importance when considered in Conner
lion with tlie extension oflhc public ground and
the enlargement of the park West and south ol
the Washington monument. The report of the
board of survey heretofore ordered by a com
mittees of congress on the improvement of the
harbor ot Washington and (ieorgetown, is re
spectfully commended to consideration. The re
port of the commissioners of the District of Cos
lumbia presented a detailed statement of affairs
of the District. The relative expenditure.- by the
United Slates and the District lot local purposes
is contrasted, showing that expenditures by the
people of the district greatly exceed those of the
general government. Tim exhibit is made in con

the defective pavements aud sowers of the city, which
is a work of immediate necessity and in Ila same
connection a plan is presented for the permanent
funding of tho outstanding securities of tie- district.

justice request attention to tin- discrimination
made by congress against the district

support of the public schools and ask that the

Prohibition in Maryland.
Maryland is not a place wnere we
should expect to find ultra-tempuranoe

fact that prohibition of the liquor traffic
exists in four counties of that slate,
wholly, aud in five counties in part.
The prohibition is complete in Caro
line, Calvert and Kent counties, and
Talbot county in four districts out of
live, according to the Baltimore Sun,
have adopted prohibition by vote, and
the other district the grand jury has
practically enforced it hy refusing li
cense. Flight districts out of nine in
Somerset county, twelve out of four
lecn in Dorchester, three out of six in
i titeen Anne's, are prohibition districts.
In Baltimore county prohibition pre
vails iit Woodberry, Mount Washing
