FUOM WASHINGTON.
[Special to tue Courier-Journal.]
Wasm sorox. De •. 9.—Mr. Eandall, of
t'ennsj l vania. made à very severe onslaught
on the President s message to-day, wherein it
•was attempted to whitewash the late Board of
Public Works. Tie - President had attempted
to convince Congress that Boss Shepherd and
lus associates had n<>t incurred a debt exceed
ing $10.INK),000. Mr. liandiill to-day took up
the figures luruisi.ed by th'- Board of Audit,
which demon*»: te that the District debt
really exceeds >2' ,000,000. The special cham
pion of th<- tre-iden', little Hide, of Maine,
attempted to reply to Mr. iî-.tndu ll, but it was
an utter failure, * lUndall asserted that he
lad the otiieial t.v res for the statement made
by him, and lied .led anybody to demonstrate
his inacnracy, Mr. Hale, having charge of
the resolution which a thirds the opportunity
for Mr. llaudah's attack, called the previous
.question, aiidthu- '»oil all further debate.
'Ire not lieing aide to answer the facts as pre
sented gainst th Pr. dib nt, therefore pur
sued the only w. y to stop unpleasant dis
closnresJ which -, to choko Mr. Bandall off.
As was very pertriiuiitiy remarked, the time
is coming when the truth can't be suppressed,

It is also believed that the subject will
come up in some way or other in Congress,
tnd will probably kad to a debate in which
many ol the issues of lire last general elec
tion will be review d. Tliere are very decided
indications also tl at the Bepublican Congress
men here are seriously alarmed at the pros
pect of a large Southern Democratic vote for
President in IST* , and are resolved to take as
nan y Southern States as possible by the
throats, and so reconstruct and annnl their
State Governments as to tix their vote two
years hence to an absolute certainty. Louisi
ana, Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi, are
all believed to be in danger from these des
perate conspirators. Their object is to carry
the Presidential election, whether by lair
means or foul: and to this end everything
else will be subordinated.
THE FINANCIAL QUESTION.
There was some collision to-day between
;he Ways and Means Committee and that on
Banking and Currency, as to which should
have control of the question of the volume of
legal tenders and the resumption of specie pay
ment, winch was discussed in the President's
message; Lu! it was finally agreed that both
committeei should deal with the subject in
their own way. Private ti uancial advices from
New York suite that the President's message
exerted no influence whatever on values, and
that the fall in gold is due altogether to im
proved advices man Great Britain. Bankers
.here laugh at Grant's idea ol naming an early
day for resumption.

A SI RANGE STORY.
A FACT OB A FICTION FROM FLORIDA.
[From the New York Times.]
An old lawsuit has come to an untimely end in
Florida. During the war, when the 'Federal
fleet was menacing Tampa Bav, a certain Fred.
Halsemann, an old planter of Hillsboro county,
anxious, like the reet of his trilie, to be "let
alone," thought that the famous everglades
would be the safest place to stay, and accordingly
disappeared into their tangled recesses. He took
with him his wife and their youngest child, a boy
live years old. The wife and mother got sepa
rated in some way from the two others, and luck
ily happened to wander back to her home. Three
years went by. The war was over. The older
sons had returned from service in the Confeder
ate army and were working the plantation on
shares with their former slaves. During all this
time nothing had been heard of the missing pair.
They were mourned for as dead.
tine day, in the spring of 1807, a man appa
rently about thiitv years old, leading by the hand
a boy of live, ran joyously up to the verandah of
the plantation house, and began a series of vio
lent kirsings ot the aged mother in Israel, who,
with the aid of large type and spectacles, was
reading her Bible there'. His demonstrations of
affection were interrupted by the screams of the
old lady and the blows of the eldest son. Both
struck the intruder painfully. He tried to speak,
but was obliged to »levote all his energies to the
task of finding a soft spot to fall upon at the end
of the parabola which the son's last well-aimed
blow marie him describe in the air. He ros', be
wildered and bruised, just in time to be knocked
down again by a select assortment of younger
sons and negroes, whom the sound or the scullle
bad called to the spot. As ho fell, something
tumbled from the pocket of his ragged coat. It
was a picture of the widow. The dead planter
had carried it with him when he plunged into the
swamps.
There was a general outcry, and a demand for
aa explanation. The story* of the new comer
was in brief, this : He was Fred. Halsemann.
Iu his wanderings through his vast hiding-place
he hud fallen into a foaming spring. When he
clambered out, his son ran away, as if in fright.
He ran alter him with surpris'mg speed, ihe
chilu, when caught, screamed for its father. It
was long before lie could be persuaded that the
young, fresh, vigorous man who climbed out of
the spring was the aged, decrepit, white-haired
man who had fallen into it a moment before. The
lather at first could not appreciate the change.
He saw that his bands were no longer wrinkled,
that his beard was brown 'instead of gray, that
his step was firmer and his eye keener, but the
suddenness of the tr&nformation dizzied him.
All at once the truth Hashed upon him. He had
fallen into the Fountain of Truth which Ponce
do Leon sought in vain amid the Florida swamps !
He hastened back and ptnngod his son into the
spring. It was an unlucky deed.
The tradition about the fountain has always
been that its wonderful waters changed age to
vigorous manhood and maile ulready-existent
youth immutable so long as life lasted. The
t i-adition proved true. He hatl become young.
His son stayed so. The boy was five years old
when tlie potent waters touched him, aud ho
showed no signs of giowtli beyond that age, in
mind or body, »luring the three years they spent
l ost in the labyrinth. They lived mainly bn alli
gators, which, when young, are very good eating.
When they killed an old one it was their custom
to plunge it, while a spark of life was still leit,
into the Fountain of l'cuth. Thus it became
young again, and their fastidious palates were
satisfied. Finally, after many vain attempts,
the two got cut of the wilderness in which they
had been so long lost. Tlu-y happened to come
out near the old Imme, aud hastened to it.
This was the man's story. It is not to be won
dered at. perhaps, that he told it to a cirole cf
scoffers. Tlie picture was taki-n from him. His
accurate recollection of the life of the missing
planter was accounted for on the hypothesis that
lie had met lum iu the swamps and had heard
tire details from his lips. He was accused of
stealing the picture. It Degan to be whispered
that he had probably murdered Halsemann. He
was told to go. He went, taking the boy with
lrim. He reappeared in a week afterward, at
Tampa, alone. The child, he said, had died of
n ight and want. He began suit for possession
of the Halsemann plantation. When the trial
came off he rested Ins case on three points : The
resemblance of tlie boy to the child vlio had dis
appeared in lttil : his own ready recollection of
tno miuutnc of Halsemann's life, ami lus ability
to pilot anybody to the Fountain of Ponce De
Leon.
The first two points were admitted, but the re
semblancu vas attributed by tire defense to a
chance coincidence, and the" knowledge of the
past, to a presumed intimacy between the planter
aud the pretender, while both were lost m ever
glades. When men meet each other, under such
circumstances, they tell everything. The most
trivial details are eagerly related aud heard for
the sake of wilding away the monotonous hours.
So the argument ran, fairly enough. The third
point was rtatly denied. Acting on a suggestion
of the court, the claimant went with a large party
iu search of the miraculous spring. After some
weeks of wandering, they came back without
having found it. Still this failure did not absolutely
disprove the claim. The most practiced wooils
meu have often gone astray iu Southern Florida.
When the case went to a jury, the latter disa
greed. So did the next one impaneled, aud tlie
jiext. The last of the three, however, came very
near giving a verdict for the plaintiff.
This was mainly due to the admirable manage
ment of his counsel at that time, lion. John A.
Henderson, the Democratic candidate for Con
gress at the recent election. The claimant's
gratitude to Henderson was the indirect cause of
lus death. This occurred ou the 3d of Novem
ber. During the acuffio at tlie polls, whore he
was distributing Democratic ballot*, he was shot
through the body. Somebody lifted his head.
He gasped, " I am—and died. The present
possessors of the estate, whose title has been
settled by his death, aver that at the last moment
remorse overtook him, and he tried to say. "I am
not Halsemann." but was too weak to finish the
sentence. On the other baud, his friends declare
that with his last breath he asserted the justice
of his claim, by trying to say,"I am Hal-emanu."
This, however, is ail conjecture. The puzzle re
mains without an answer : Was he Halsemann,
or was he some other man ?

While a Brooklyn preacher is pitching into tliea*

Globe play-house in Bosten have, to some extent,
imitated the pew system. One hundred seats
have been sold outright iu a kind or fee simple,
to ba held by the buyers, tlieir airs and assigns
forever. The price paid was S1000 per scat. Un
like pew-holders, these owners of seats will have
no voice in the management of the establish
ment ; though we should be delighted to learn
that one of the privileges of the hi tie estate is a
right to hiss, whenever the doings behind the
curtain really demanded hissing. Our American
public is the politest iu the world.
We suffer ourselves to be bored to the very
verge of deliquium ; we stand had nflisie, bad
music, bail acting, and bad lecturing with a pa
tience which doesn't argue so much our polite
ness as our phlegm. The average American
auditor will bear and forbear forever. He knows
a thing to be bad. but he will not take the trouble
to express his opinion. He is defrauded of his
money ; anil all he does is to stay away in future.
But w'e »lo not want him to stay away. We want
him to go. We want pit, box. gallery, pulpit, anil
the whole stack of settees full, and the show
worthy of so much profitable patronage. It
would be of good import, if all who purchase
tickois would remember that they are buying the
opportunity of amusement or of instruction; aud
it they get neither, that they are just as much
swindled as if the man in the ticket office had
stolen their pocket-books. Dear patient public!

MODERN SILVER WARE.
It was but a little before the American revolu
tion. about 1760, that silver table-spoons began
to exclude those of wood, horn and pewter from
the tables of the quality in England, and even
tea-spoons of silver are said to have been rare
before the time of Queen Anne (1691 to 1713).
To this day, if 1 am rightly informed, no spoons
of solid silver, large or small, much less silver
forks, are to be found in common use among the
"plain peuple" (with rare exceptions) of any
European country. In the United .States, on the
contrary, it is unnecessary to inform the Ameri
can reader of Scribner that, as a rule, the farmer
is but thriftless, and the mechanic but a jour
neyman, whose spoons aud perhaps forks are not
of solid silver. The journeyman furnishes his
table with plated articles of this class, or at
worst britannia, aud only the rude day-laborer
contents himself with tinned or pewter ware.
Plated tea-services, castors, salvers, pitchers, la
dles, cake and fiuit baskets, etc., are too com
mon to be noticed, unless wanting, on the tables
ot those iu easy circumstances. Olid it is no rare
distinction if they are of solid silver. In fact,
for bridal gifts nothing less than solid silver is
thought respectable, and in this way, so univer
sal has the custom ot bridal gifts become, hardly
any comfortable young coupio now begin house
keeping without a fair show of genuine table sil
ver, so far at least as spoons, forks, butter, fruit,
pie and fish knives, napkin rings and such tri
ties.
The beauty of the »jrdinary American table,
with its snowy damask and china, sparkling out
class, and lustrous utensils of silver, all disposed
m the tasteful symmetry native to tlie American
housewife, is a* power.' aud one that goes too
near the si wings of moral as well as æsthetic
culture to be lightly esteemed by the most seri
ous obeet ver. The dev, lopment of this crown
symbol of domestic refinement is worthy oi
our attention. A critical journal has remarked
that an American lady's idea of dinner is a hand
some service of silver and china, with two or
three vases of choice hot-house flowers. I suiv
isse it was a typical American lady, among the
"plain people, too, who stated to me the ele
ments of a meal as sire understood it, in the
following series : First, order (including elegance
and good attendance ;) second, intellectual con
versation, and lastly, something to eat.
Plated ware originated iu England about the
middle of the last century, the first application
having been made to small articles in 1742, by
Thomas Bolsover, a Sheffield mechanic. The new
elegance brought within the means and suppoaed
properties of tire middle »-lass, took the name of
"Sheffield plate," not from the process of plating,
lmt from the silverware of which it was an imi
tation. Plate, in this sense, is not our Saxon word
•ognatc witli fat. but wai borrowed from the
Spanish piatn\ silver), and applied to all utensils
made of the precious metals, in whatever form.
To elderly readers "Sheffield plate" will still
hare a familiar sound, for uuiler this name the
beauty of silver was first popularized in America,
aud to a far greater extent than even in England.
Probably tlie Sheffield and Birmingham manufac
turers of plated ware atone period »'XjMirted more
goods to tnis country than they sold at home.
A further and greater advance was mado in
1838 by the invention of electro-plating, or rather
the practical application of the method, which
had been known, but strangely neglected, for
thirty years. At one s roke plating was greatly
reduced in cost, its applications indefinitely ex
tended. and its offc-ta incomparably improved.
Everybody in America, is now familiar with the
ordinary wares of our numerens eloi'tro-plating
companies, and there is hardly a cottage worth
two Hundred dollars in the country where such
wares are not to be found; although the rich
plating of the Elkintous. in England, anil the
Gorhams, iu America, is too high in first cost for
the strictly popular demand.
Within "halt a century the business of the
American silversmith was mostly confined to
making spoons to order for jewelers, who rarely
purchased more than one or two dozen at a time,
for particular orders. About 1825 it was notic*-d
that the silversmiths began to venture into the
manufacture of light sjioons for general sale
throne h a »'lass' of cheap jewelry peddlers, who
are »'ill well remembered by natives of the New
England of tha f period. Tlie Providence manu
facture had begun to be extended and brought
into national relations by the enterprise of a
young goldsmith named Jabez Gorham, who
adapied his work to the general requirements of
the trade, anti made his way with it m tlie Bos
ton market by underselling and outpushing the
unmercantile mechanics of his craft. The droll
account the old gentleman, who died about five
years ago. nsed to give »if his semi-annual mar
keting iu Boston, is more expressive tliau a gen
eral description could be. of tlie very modest
status of the now imposing stiver trade of our
chief cities : how the Boston jewelers assembled
at his lodgings, pursuant to notice, that they
might be all admitted at the same moment, with
out partiality, to view and dinde the little trunk
ful of new jewelry spread out ui»on his bed !—

They have a high suspension bridge in Bristol.
England, from the top of which there is but a
step to the next world. Ten persons have taken
this step since the bridge was built, and as the
way seemed to lie so tempting, the authorities
resolved to guard it. The toll-taker looks into
the eyes of the passengers, and thus endeavors
to pierce their secret thoughts. He is supposed
to read human nature like a book. Lately a
young girl paid him a penny as toll and smiled
sweetly as she passed. This smile amused the
toll-taker's suspicions that all was not right with
the girl. He told a watchman to follow, and the
girl having gone some distance, tlie watchman
started after her ou a run. The girl saw him
giving chase and she ran. She climbed the rail
ing of the bridge, got down on the outside,
grasped the floor, and swung by her hands over
the abyss. The watchman says she smiled at
him when he came up. He rushetl forward and
attempted to seize her, just toucLed her hands
and sue dropped. That made ten. The jury of
inquest were unable to decide whether it was a
case of deliberate suicide or whether the girl was
frightened at being chased and just stepped out
of the way of her pursuer.
Mary Ann Robinson nee Snnndie marched into

Robinson was and inquired the meaning of the

was Mrs. Mary Ann Robinson nee Smmdle and
had come to take possession of her husband's
hearth and home. At the same timo she drew a
pistol and examined it critically. Mrs. C. T. Rob
inson No. 2 grabbed her sun-bonnet aud ran out
of the house, leaving No. 1 in peaceful possession
without the tiring of a single shot or the pulling

at least one occasion, solicited business on the
landing for the Bulletin, I hereby iuforrn
the steamboat community that I am the only
authorized River Agent of the Bulletin on the
Levee. Geo. J. Duncan.
The Mary Houston leaves at 5 P. M. to-morrow

from our exchanges.
From St. Louis Republican, Dec. 10th :
'J he general opinion of boatman last evening
was to the effect that colder weather would ensue.
Iu this event, the channel now in such bail con
dition, will grow "uo better fast " The pros
pects for good navigation from this part South
during this winter are far from flattering, and a
hard winter for boats and boatmen is predicted.
Trot out ths soup-house on the levee.
A correspondent writes : "Can you tell me
what's crabs ?" As the question is asked to the
wat r department of this paper we can, sir. A
crab is a name <pven to an order ot crustaceans,
essjiecially of the genus cancer, but is some
times applied to smaller animals, not quite so
crusty.
The river at this point has fallen five inches
since our last report, The channel Is fast be
coming more dangerous to water craft, and navi
gation, except for the smaller craft of boats, must
soon succumb to the situation unless something
turns up to give more water to Cairo. Rates
have advanced slightly. The figures to New Or
leans are 70 cents per barrel on floor and 35 cents
per hundred on pound freight. To Vicksbnrg 70
cents on flour. To Memphis 50 cents on flour.
Business is good.
The H. C. »aeger, from New Orleans, arrived
with 52(J tons of miscellaneous freight.
Why the rates to points Month have not ad
vanced with more speedy steps is a rebus. Ship
pers certainly have no reason to complain at pres
ent ligures. A barrel of Hour may now be car
ried to New Orleans by boat as cheap as it can
be transported by wagon to Carondelet.
The Paragon grounded again on her down trip,
but got off with little loss of time, but it is
thought she will have to rub to reach Cairo.
The Atlantic and barges will have a fair trip
of freight. But the barge line will not advertise
another tow until the weather looks more favor
able. lor a rise.
The Jno. Kyle, for New Orleans, leaves posi
tively at 5 P. M. from wharf-boat foot of Market
street. The Atlantic and Mary Alice and barges
get off for New Orleans this evening.
Cincinnati Commercial : "It takes a man of
considerable nerve to invest the round sum of
$80,000 in a large and splendid steamer for the
Cincinnati and New Orleans trade these trying
times in the river interest. Capt. Albert Stein
has expended fully this amount in the production
of liia elegant side-wheel passenger Steamer
Charles Morgan, just completed aud ready for
business."
