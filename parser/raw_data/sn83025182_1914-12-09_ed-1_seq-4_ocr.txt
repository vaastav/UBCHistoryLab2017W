CRADLE SONG.
Lord Gabriel, wilt thou not rejoice
When at last a little boy's
Cheek lies heavy as a rose,
And his eyelids close?
Gabriel, when that hush may be,
This sweet hand all heedtully
I'll undo, for thee alone,
From his mother's own.
Then the far blue highways paven
r\Vith the burning stars of heaven
He shall gladden with the sweet
Hasting of his feet—
'•Feet so brightly bare and cool,
[Leaping, as from pool to pool
f§- From a little laughing boy
IS, Splashing rainbow joy!
Gabriel, wilt thou understand
a .How to keep his hovering hand?—
Never shut, as in a bond
From the bright beyond?—
•v..
Nay, but though it cling and close
Tightly as a climbing rose,
Clasp it only so,—aright,
Lest his heart take fright.

The dusk is hung with blue.)

mileage of this state which shows
that the ninety-nine counties of Iowa
have a total of 104,027 miles of pub

LIGHTING CHRISTMAS TREE.
Christmas trees are usually young
growth of spruce or balsam, although
other evergreen trees are sometimes
used. As these trees are very resin
ous they are easily ignited by lighted
candles suspended from their
branches. Once a twig Is ignited the
entire tree flares into a sudden blaze
which is difficult to extinguish. For
this reason miniature electric lamps
are now being used for Christmas tree
lighting.
The tiny electric lamps are arranged
in long strings which can be suspends
ed and festooned from the tree and
there is not the slightest danger of
their setting the -hranqjhes on fixe. The
lamps are made in all colors and in
a great variety of shapes. Many of
them are made to represent birds,
fruits, men, animals, etc. One string
of the lights i9 enough for a small
tree and other strings may be added
according to the size of the tree. The
cord is provided with an ordinary
screw plug which fits any electric fix
ture. The lights can be snapped on
and off as desired. In this way the
Christmas tre© is a thing of beauty
and a Joy throughout the holiday sea
son, without the danger of fire.
BATTLE OF CREDIT ISLAND.
One hundred years ago, in Septem

through the woods not far from the to find
present site of the city of Daven

small company of British and In

force under Lieutenant John Camp
bell was checked three miles above
Rock Island by a party of Sacs and

THE OLDEST OF FOUR
By Anna Bell Marlowe.
12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Price 60
Cents
Published by Grosset & Dunlap, New
York.
Few writers for girls have obtained
the immediate and large following that
has been accorded to Amy Bell Mar
lowe. Although she has written -but
five books, her name Is rapidly be
coming a household word wherever
there are young people, and thousands
of girls are asking when will her next
book be published?
The answer to this tremendous pop
ularity is not far to seek. Each of her
stories is not only clean and well
told, but it has a vigor and? freshness
that grips from start to finish.
In her new book, "The Oldest of
Four," (Grosset & Dunlap, New York)
Miss Marlowe tells of the doings of a
wideawake American girl who sudden
ly finds the cares of thj household
thrust upon her shoulders. Her father
has disappeared In a wreck at sea,
her mother is ill, and her three young
er sisters look to her for comfort and
aid. Natalie is a born writer, but she
has other things to do in order to
make both ends meet and how she
finally wins out in her struggle makes
reading no girl will care to miss. The
book is well bound antf handsomely
illustrated.
Mr. 8ears Left $17,000,000.
Burlington Hawk-Eye: Mr. Sears,
the founder of the mail order house
of Sears-Roebuck Company, recently
died and we are told, left a fortunf
of approximately $17,000,000, quite a
tidy sum, even in these days of great
fortunes. The Hawk-Eye has no fault
with Mr. Sears thrift and
business acumen but It does deplore
the fact that so many people here and
elsewhere, attracted by glittering
catalogues, are so ready to patronise
mail order houses and to send their
money for goods and all from teh
communities wherein It was earned.
We hold fast to the opinion that it Is
the falsest kind of economy that
tempts the buyer to shun his home
market and seek the wares of the
outside concerns. There Is nothing
to gain and everything to lose by
such trade methods. "We will admit
that to us all the average catalogue
is singularly attractive and ensnar
ing but we contend that the catalogue
habit is about as disastrous a one as
the avearge citizen can fall victim to.

NEW YORK, Dec. 5—No unfavor
able developments followed the much
dreaded partial opening of the stock
exci!ange-
The bond market com-
menced surprisingly steady and many
quotations showed considerable
strength, which happy result was fore
shadowed in my previous weekly let
ters. Foreign liquidation was not an
important factor, although some sell
ing was occasionally noted. In fact so
positively encouraging was the experi
ment of partial opening that the ex
change for the first time since the war,
issued official quotations on stocks sell
ing at or above the minimum prices.
This very practical display of confi
dence, which should be encouraged,
will doubtless have a widely beneficial
result. It will tend to establish opin
ion as to values. It has already dem
onstrated there is no such wholesale
liquidation in prospect as at one time
feared and it paves the way for an
early resumption of trading in stocks
ion the exchange. The action of the
bond market may be taken as a fair
indication of how th« stock market
would act when reopened and there
is no longer any seiioas occasion for
delay In gradually removing the pres
ent restrictions. There are intima
tions that the London stock exchange
may be opened by the middle of the
month, provided permission pf the
British government can be obtained.
It is now over four months since
the New York stock exchange closed,
and no business organization in the
United States has made greater sac
rifices or greater efforts for the pres
ervation of our national finances than
the members of that body, either in
dividually or collectively. Of course,
they have been largely guided by in
telligent self Interest as well as by an
appreciation of the consequences
which might have followed the debacle
arising from the war had it not clos
ed. Nevertheless, everyone in the
financial district well knows that the
stock exchange was quite as much in
fluenced in its action by consideration
of national interest as by Its own im
mediate affairs. Wh°n the emergency
came, far-sightedness, sound judg
ment and public spirit promptly push
ed self interest to the rear and the
New York stock exchange through
prompt and unselfish action prevented
the gravest financial crisis this coun
try has ever seen from running into
incalculable disaster. Now that this
danger has completely disappeared
and become only a matter of history,
this fact is no secret and is mention
ed not as a boast, but merely as a mat
ter of justice to an Institution that
has had to hear much more than it's
share of abuse, and whose shortcom
lugs and mistakes are infinitesimal
compared with the services which it
has rendered to the business commun
ity. Many of those who loudly railed
against our various exchanges are
now only too glad to see them resum
ing normal activities.
The local money situation shows
nirther improvement. Funds are ac

essarily Involved the risks of too sud
den ease and too much Inflation, in
view of the large amounts. of emerg
ency currenfty and clearing house cer
tificates still outstanding. Fortunate
ly both of these forms of currency
are being retired as fast as possible
and as the reserve banks get into
more perfect working order their con
trol over the money situation will in
crease and the danger of unwhole
some inflation will vanish. The in
evitable increase of money and credit
will however prove a powerful aid to
business revival, and if long con
tinued, cannot but have a great stim
ulus, not only upon trade butj also up
on investment values. The tremend
ous extent to which credit facilities
have been expanded is not yet fully
realized, and until the money market
has adjusted itself to this heavy in
crease in bank reserves our bank of
ficials will have to exercise much dis
cretion and restraint if they intend to
prevent am undesirable expansion of
credit. Care will, also be needed to
conserve the domestic gold supply,
which is large and widely scattered all
over the country. Our best safeguards
are to persistently retire redundant'
currency and to develop the export
trade as much as possible. Our ex
ports have already recovered wonder
fully from the war, partly owing to
the big foreign demand for our food
stuffs, and partly to the urgent In
quiries for war materials from the
various belligerents. One government
official has already stated that the war
will add $500,000,0*00 to the foreign
commerce of the United States.
Violent fluctuations must be expected
to accompany the derangement of in
ternal trade. The world has largely
adjusted itself to. the war basis but
as soon as peace comes, another sharp
readjustment will follow. The great
industrial nations, England and Ger
many, will return to work with intense
eagerness to recover what has been
lost. Competition will be keen and
prices low. This new rivalry for for
eign markets promises to exceed any
thing the world has ever seen and
what effect that condition will have
upon the United States Is yet to be
determined. Possibly there will be
an inrush of imports, particularly un
der our new tariff. At the same time
our exports of merchandise might
temporarily decline.
Trade at home Is dull. Reduced
bank clearings, declining railroad
earnings, contraction in building, ac
companied by an unusual number of
business failures, all furnish unwel
come testimony in this direction. But
let it be thoroughly understood, these
statements represent conditions that
are passed. The tide has turned. The
country must look forward to the con
structive effects of a sound banking
system, to a period of easy money and
to the sustaining effects of a good
harvest. The stock market will be the
first to reflect these better condi
tions, and were it not for the war
American securities would be selling
many points higher than they are to
day. If It proves true that this mar
ket has fairly discounted the war—
and we think It has—then American
securities are entitled to a substan
tial recovery, provided the fortunes
or misfortunes of war do not prevent.
There is one other factor on which
much hope is being based, and that is
that the interstate commerce commis
sion will yield to intelligent public
opinion and also to the desires of the
administration by granting some por
tion of the railroads' request for an
advance in rates. Should a favorable
decision be forthcoming this month,
as is anticipated In some circles, the
event will have a distinctly beneficial
effect upon business sentiment gen
erally. The restoration of business
confidence would be greatly accelerat
ed by such tangible evidence of the
cessation of official hostility to big
business. President Wilson's coming
message to congress will be awaited
with much Interest.
Investment purchases have been
largely held back for the last four
months, and savings must have ac
cumulated considerably fn conse
quence. There is no serious foreign
liquidation now in sight and, as
there are no safer or better paying
investments in the world Just now
than Americans, it follows that there
should be sufficient domestic and for
eign buying to offset any probable
liquidation on foreign account. The
investment demand at home* Is stead
ily growing with the Increase of con
fidence, and the larger dealings In
bonds, short term notes and public
utilities are a visible expression of
this improvement. At present prices
the better class of railroad shares and
certain industrials are paying Invest
ments, considering the outlook for
easy money.
