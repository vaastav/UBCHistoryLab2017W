NEWS OF THE WEEK.
NEWS OF THE WEEK. ENDING DEC. 10, 1862.
It is now five weeks since lie rcmo
val of McCiollan. and the appointment of
a commander who was to fight, not ling
er ; who was to bring us a brilliant vic
tory and end the war. The enemy refu
ses to be captured, refuses even to be
routed. The falsified predictions and the
blighted topes of the busy macLiuators
have become the derision of the country,
and may soon become its scorn., ,.
The super?erviceab!e Halleck, in that
Sybelline letter of October 28th, said
that three weeks have elapsed, and yet
he has not moved. Every day since has
brought, new proof that .the young Gen
eral was right when, he pointed to his un
filled reipisixions for shoes aiad clathing
for his men, and that the same delinquen
cies have hindered. Burnside.
At last a rumor comes that the Admin
istration have, agreed to meddle no more.
But watch well the weather-vane on the
White House, which answers to the cur
rent, of public clamor. It is self-registering,
and bere is marked the removal of
a General there a winter campaign, if it
eost a thousand score of men. The county-seat
critics at their warm firesides will
soon tell us. .As yet they have not dared
to make an attack on Burnside, though
he has had five weeks. , .
.The Baell Court of Inquiry has gone
to Nashville to be near the witnesses who
eould not be spared from the army.
General Bosecrans has stationed a brig
ade at Ilallettvillo, where its force could
he conveniently calculated, overpowered
aisl taken. This is what we call oceupy
ing the country. ' The new German regi
ment under Colonel Tafel, is among the
eaptives.-
A new incident has' occurred ia New
York. A writ of habeas corpus was
issued to General Banks, requiring the
production of a eoldier who was alledged
to be improperly detained in tie army
The Assistant District Attorney of the
United States appeared on behalf of Gen
eral Bunks, and. made return to the writ
as follows '
. First that the tody of the aforesaid soldier
was then ea board the Northern Light,
and on its way to tlie Narrows the tran
sport having saileJ froia her dock before
the Genera! was served with the writ Sec
ond, that, the General himself had set sail
on the same errand with his soldiers at
1 p. m. Notwithstanding these obstacles
to a literal compliance with the writ, Gen.
Batiks desired .iLe Judge to understand
that he entertained the greatest respect for
the mandates of the civil courts, and would
do all that lay irr Lis power to obey the pro
cesses emanating therefrom ; he would there
fore direct that the soldier alluded to be put
on shore from the Northern Light, before she
left tU Bay, and leavs it to him to present
himself in obedience to the writ. .
General Banks has sailed from New
York and gone South with the expedition
some time in preparation.
The President's Messages.
It has been usual with country papers
to publish the President's Message, while
it has been nearly as usual for their sub-
scribers to pass it by unread. The Ua
BAXA Union will not publish the Mes
sage entire, conscious that this omission
will oblige most cf its readers, and as
sured that those who care to read it will
find it plentiful elsewhere. We shall
describe some of its contents and remark
upon them. The topics treated of are
such as could be readily forseen,and the
manner of their treatment, has alone re
mained the subject of interest.
There are points in the Message which
no careful reader of history, and no lover
of law and order, can assent to as true;
and there are arguments in support
these points entirely fallacious, and yet
one " cannot rise from a perusal of
Message without a 6trong sense of Mr.
Lincoln's general desire to promote
puhlie welfare and to ensure peace ; and
with one exception, with a general sense
of his' honesty: Six months ago, this
feeling in regard to Mr. Lincoln,
.almost universal, and there-was a gcnwal
readiness to. concede to him the posses
sion of good intentions and a sound judg
ment. The,-unwilling conviction
been forced upon a great .many minds,
that he has yielded up his own judgment
to the dictation of others, and that
has done so in opposition. to his can cx
preyed convictions."
,
' j
-
of
the
has
ho
We shall first notice what we have to
eomnentl, d then separately notice tht
subjects of Finance and Slavery. His
financial notions. are very naturally cru
dities, perhaps taken from the Treasery
Report, not yet before the puba. His
treatment of the slavery question is
meant as a middle ground between .Lis
Radical adherents and hh Conservative
opponents, and will please none, except i
those who always think as the President
thinks.
Out foreign " rclationVremain undis
turbed with all nations ; although eases
of complaint growing out of the block
ade, have occurred on the part of nations
whose cupidity leads them. !no systema
tic attempts at "Tunning" it. ' We should
rathe sa j, a single nation, for England
alone has shown this systematic cupid
ity... Our cation also has complaints and
reclamations to make against the several
nations which claim to be injured. The
President therefore proposes a joint Con
vention with each nation, to investigate
and settle all contested matters. This
fair and equitable mod's will meet, or
should meet with concurrence at home
and abroad.
If that mode should be adopted, and it
should be found, as an average result,
that the claims of our citizens against
any foreign government equalled their
claims against the United States, we beg
to suggest a plan by which we can play
quits and save the Treasury.. It will be
remembered perhaps by some by very
few however that France during her
Revolution of '93, committed spoliations
on our commerce, for which our Govern
ment made reclamation on behalf of our
merchants. The spolition could nei
ther be justified, nor our claims denied
by France, but she had a claim against
the United States for violation of a treaty
of alliance, offensive and defensive, made
with us ia the beginning of our Revolu
tionary War, as w' had failed to join her
in a- later war with England. We could
not deny the failure on our part, nor ex
cuse it otherwise than by alledging our
weakness at the time. We got rid of
the claim made against us by agreeing to
pay the Epoliatcd merchant ourselves,
five millions of dollars. This promise
we never kept, but cheated our mer
chants out of their money by delay, and
finally told them that the claim was too
old and so we saved that sum to the
Treasury ! That is an American prece
dent, and certainly it must be right! If
any one thinks that this is not good
morals, let him read the Message through
and he will there find it laid down that
! a " nation consists of its tail, it people,
and its laws;" certainly, then, a nation
may use up its people and even kick its
laws aside, and be a good nation still.
(If any one shall think that this pas
sage about France is one that he did not
look for, our explanation is, that timely
reprehension of bad faith may he a use
ful thing; and-wa have a aotioa that
some of ear earning sea in- cabinets may
be pu2zfed to square accounts, and in
clined to look in the file for precedents.)
The President then gives a brief syn-:
opsis of the General Post Office, which
shows good management in that Depart
ment, with great improvement in its
revenues compared with its expenses. It
is a gratifying circumstance to note in
the Postmaster-General's Report, that he
attributes some of the success to a change
of incompetent officers, and that mere
rotation in office has not been the rule.
, The President notes the disappearance
of all revenue from the sale of lands,
referring it to the Homestead law, as
is falsely called, but without any recom
mendatioB for its repeal. It is a strange
thing for a nation involved in debt, bar
rowing money and levying heavy taxes
to meet its enorB&ous outlay, to choose
such a time to give away its public lands,
and particularly to persons who may
claim from some foreign minister an ex
emption from bearing arms.
The office of President does not
necessity endow its occupant with finan
cial knowledge, and more than one
these occupants have, in the course
our history, found it convenient to lay
their own party faults upon the Banks,
which are the mere agents of trade, and
a part of commercial movements. Mr.
Lincoln is not by any means exempt
1 from this fault, when he tells the Con
gress that "the suspension of specie
payments by the Banks, soon after the
commencement of the last session, madt
large Usues of Untied States note unavoid
able." - Now it is too soon yet to be for"
gotten that when the Government had
been meeting some pressing demands
the rate of twelve per cent., and
Congress had authorized a loan of two
hundred and fifty millions of dollars
six per cent, bonds or on Treasury Notes,
the Banks of New York and other cities
came to the aid of Government, and took
fifty millions of this loan in six per cent,
bonds, and afterwords took another fifty
millions, and the Banks had also been
by receiving them as money. And when
the raising of further supplies to meet
public expenditures, was pressing,
question was whether to sell bonds at
discount, and continue to deal in money
and leave trade undisturbed, 01 to issue
irredeemable Treasury Aots, to be dealt
out at por, and suffer prices in eonnnerce
to take such" range as the in&atrdn might
produce.
. Public opinion was greatly divided",
and the choice fell ia favor of the latte)
- ! mode. The Treasury notes answered
j time, ae they always, do when the quan-
'
it
of
of
of
at
on
the
the
a
for
j
tity is moderate, but were sure to bring
augm&ntcd prices in everything, as we
have now seen. There was so general an
acquiescence in. this decision at the time
that no one has any right now to cast
severe blame on the course taken." But
Mr. Lincoln needed, not to couple it with
suspension of specie payments by the
Banks as a consequence of their act, and
by no mean is he justified in claiming
nvAil it f - Vita 'tfi ri vnn 1 sin voanntf n c
satisfying partially and for the time, the
long felt want of an uniform circulating
Hiedium, saving thereby to the people,
immense sums in discounts and exchang
es;" certainly, if a man chooses to think
so, he may gratify himself with perceiv
ing that he buys with Treasury notes,
exchange for remittance payable at the
' ... . i ' i
point in tne same medium at a very tow
rate, but let him purchase a draft for
coin, ia New York, and he will not be so
much gratified with the saving he is
making. Instead of paying a premium
of one per cent, at most as formerly, ho
will pay thirty-five per cent. A medi
um of uniform circulation is a fallacy,
and cannot be had in the United States.
The difference of exchange between pla
ces is the expense of transporting coin;
and with express companies, reaching
throughout the country, exchange can
never be dear. For the purposes of cir
culation, all we need is local Bank paper
convertible into coin with certainty at
the place of issue.
Therefore Mr. Lincoln's project,- or
rather his adoption of Mr. Chase's pro
ject set forth last year,, of " an organiza
tion of banking associations, under an
act of Congress," which he deems so
unobjectionable will not serve the pur
pose he expects from it, and besides there
is an utter want of power in Congress to
enact such a law tinder the Constitution
" as it was."
.Mr.. Lincoln's recent Proclamations
the Edict of Emancipation the suspen
sion, of Habeas Corpus and the declara
tion of Martial Law, are passed over
without notice, except a slight allusion
to that of Emancipation, which he virtu
ally supersedes with new plane,. and then
says he will still carry it out..
He declares again as he had said be
fore, that Slavery is the cause of the pres
ent war. He, and others like him, have
caused many men to think so, and have
thus prepared them to insist upon the
destruction of Slavery as a war measure.
If Mr. Lincoln had said that the war on
Slavery by States, or by people in States
that have nothing to do with it, had
caused a spirit cf resistance which had
led to war, he would have been more
accurate historically; but historical ac
curacy is a thing for the future.
He proposes to amend the Constitution
of the United States, so as to declare,
first, that all slaves made free by the war
shall be free ; second, to give- Congress
power to provide for emancipation with-
i the. States, by paying the owners of
slaves the value of them ; third, to pro
vide for the colonization of free colored
persons by transportation to other coun
tries. The first proposal is a clear ad
mission that the acts of Congress confis
cating slaves, and his threatened Eman
cipation are nullities in law.
. The next proposal, to purchase and
emancipate the slaves of such States as
may agree to it, is an assumption that
Slavery is such an evil that it should be
got rid of, at the common charge, by an
exercise of power somewhat like that of
eminent domain. We agree with Mr.
Lincoln, that the North is as much re
sponsible as the South for the present
existence of Slavery, by the encourage
ment given to its labor, and therefore, if
it be such an evil, it should be got rid of
at the common charge. But there will
be a great unwillingness to transfer the
police powers of the States to Congress
in this particular, and a greater one to
incur such a debt as the purchase WDuld
make. If the States see fit to adopt his
proposal, it will be an action in the reg
ular form of amending the Constitution
and with such consent of the nation that
no room will be left for complaint, more
than in any other lawfully settled mat
ter. The Proclamation of Emancipation
was declared to be a military measure to
end the war, and that it is to be enforced
on the 1st of January, 1863. This am
endment of the Constitution is to end the
war, and is a much cheaper way, says
Mr. Lincoln, than war itself. Now Mr.
Lincoln has either meant that his Proc
lamation shall rest in abeyance till the
people have fully acted on his amend
ments, which could not possibly be done
in less than one or two years; or if he
meant that this shall all be achieved
within the remaining days of December,
else he will proceed on the 1st day
January with his Proclamation, he has
meant to palter with us by offering
impossible remedy.
Mr. Lincoln's argument in favor of his
compensated emancipation is, that buying
off the trouble in this way is cheaper
than continuance of war. Here again
an inconsistency. He does not propose
to suspend military operations and await
the decision of the people on his amend
mcnt, therefore the whole cost of war will
be incurred anyhow. And then to obvi
ate the objection that he anticipates
the increase of our debt, he says that our
future increase of population will always
be- making the debt relatively less,
there will be a larger number of people
to pay it. This is a fair sample of the
readiness with which Mr. Lincoln" can
deaf in fallacies and seem to deceive him
self. To prove this position he shows
that our population has a progressive in
crease at the rate of thirty-five pw.cent.
in each ten ycarsj and that in the year
1900 there will be one buiiJredmillions
of population. Now this is a very curi
eus argument, as Mr. Lincoln had dis
tinctly proposed to pay for the slaves
with Government bonds bearing six per
cent. Interest, payable annually.-- Now
this annual charge will be pressing on
the people during all the interim; this
is' all that concerns the'peoplc of to-day,
and it is a matter of little moment to us
what may be the exact proportion of
debt to such person thirty-eight years
hence y. our care is with the burdjea, of
to-day, and that will be at least sixty
millions of annual interest to thirty
millions of people, counting . every arc
and sex. And as if to tax our credulity
to the utmost, and to place the fact "of
blunder beyond the point of incrodulity,
be talks to us thus:
' " If we had allowed our old national debt to
run at G per cent per annum, simple inlerest.
irom the end of our Revolutionary struggle
till to-day without paying anything on either
principal or interest, each man of us would
owe less upon that debt now than each man
owed uiion ic then, and this becar.se our in
crease of men through the whole period has
been greater than G per cent., and has run
faster than the interest upon the debt." .
He had just labored to show by census
tables through seventy years, that our
population has grown at the rate of three
and a half per cent, a year, and then
assures us that- if we had let the debt of
the Revolution run steadily on without
payment of interest, the debt would be
actually less in proportion to each man
than at first ; that is, six per cent, a year
grows more slowly than three and a half
per cent. ! .,
We will not pursue the matter further.
There are other points in the Message
from which we dissent, butfln argument
upon them would occupy more space
than we can spare to it.
The Secret Out!—A Policy at last!
of
is
to
as
The Secretary of War, Mr. Edwin M.
Stanton, has told us what we are fighting
for ; see his annual report the end of it :
The slaves are all to be set free. "A
population of four millions with slight
assistance from the army, will under pro
per regulation and government be of great
assistance in- Tvulding the territory once
recovered."
" If protected upon tint linds llicy hate
heretofore cultivated, with some organiz -tion,
and with small detachments of loyal
troops, they would not only produce much
of what is needed to feed onr armies and
their trains, but they would forever cut
off from the Rebellion the resources of a
country thus occupied."
"Protect (lie laboring population, who
are the majority in the greater part of the
South, in the possession of the land and its
product, and this great advantage will be
transferred to as." -
"As so6n as the coast is tboroughlv
Oct upieu, U.IU- i!G jfcvjiic vryftttcu, iiauc
will revive. Cotton, rice, sugar, and
. i i . r ..jr
other products, will be exchanged ly the
producer for what he noeds. Their wants
will be supplied direct from the Northern
factories I and the cultivation of the great
staples will enable them to pay for what
they use."
"No great territory has been perma
nently reduced without depriving the
leaders of the people of their lands and
property. It is these that give power and
influence."
Thus we have it : the negroes are to be
protected in the possession of the land,
and in the products of the land, and our
armies are to watch them ! they are to be
organized into governments, and they are
to carry on a free trade with the North
our armies are to be supported there by
food raised there under the eyes of de
tachments of troops ! the armies will be
come picket guards to a negro camp, and
see to the raistng of cotton, rice and su
gar ! This is putting down rebellion
and while the negroes need protection to
keep them in possession, the war is not
ended. Our volunteers are enlisted for
three years or duriny the war. If they
thought that "during the war" was less
than three years, they made a mistake
it means three times three years, if the
four millions need " a slight assistance
from the army," and if the volunteers die
out, there is the conscription every nine
months to fill up the ranks !
We have got a policy ! All hail, Great
Bombardinian ! The nation is awake
thy brilliant rising, and in the language
of your prophetic master, you " cannot
escape history" if you would.
There are three classes who disapproved
the removal of General MoClelkn, viz: the
rebels in the South, peace Democrats in the
North and the anti-Americans in England.
The foreign news published this morning tells
what such friends as the Londou Times sny
about the matter. Cin. Guz.
This may be all true, though it rests
on bad authority. There are three clas
ses who disapprove the removal of Mc
Clellan : that class who prefer to have the
army movements managed by Generals
the field, and not by lawyers at Washing
ton : those who wish to maintain law and
order, and by those who are opposed
underhanded machinations for a sinister
purpose. '- ; - - '
The removal is approved by three clas
ses : by the mere enemies of slavery, who
wifh to pass for patriots : by toady editors
who wish to curry favor with power: and
by impatient' ignorance, that is never con
tent unless it is making a rush.
They Broke it First.
Ix times of peace when the hum of
cheerful industry fills the land we have
but little need of a Constitution then
"Jupiter may visit the Ethopians"
but when fierce passions rise vhen re
bellion rears its head, the Constitution
before engaged in settling petty quarrels
ri.-cs into surprising grandeur as the su
preme law of the land armed with the
powers of a mighty nation and commands
the peace;-' then J upitcr-rcmonnta "his
throne, armed with thunderbolts. -, -.-.
"Plain as ' this proposition is we hear
sane sensible law-abiding men talk of
laying the Constitution aside until the
rebellion is suppressed. They forget that
the Coustitution and laws are our only
authority for this" war,' and our only" sanc
tion for shedding blood, without which it
becomes lawless' murder, deserving the
execration of mankind. Whatf a thief
steals your horse ! Do you, because he
has broken the law first, break it again
and steal his, or do you invoke the sanc
tions of the broken lay, call iipon its
officers and pursue and punish the thief?
There never was a time when all who love
thir country were urged by so many motives
to sec that the Constitution " receive no
detriment"fromopen cnciuiesor pretended
friends. Now that the storm is upon us,
let us not desert that good old ship, the
Constitution, for the loosened plank of
some party platform, but let all hands
be called on deck, and let clear eyes keep
the lookout, and steady hands guide the
helm, "and she will yet come out staunch
and strong, with her precious freight of a
nation's hopes.

More Cincinnati Brigadiers.
The friends of Cul. N. 0. MeLcan will Le
gratified to learn that he has been nominated
by the President as Brigadier-General. He
won the honor by hard serv.ee and ga.lant
conduct in the Geld. Cin. (Jtiz.
No doubt his friends are delighted
and particularly hi wife. The notion
attempted to be put forth that Mr.
McLean won the distinction " by hard
service and gallant conduct in the field,'
is pure fudge. There are Colonels in
the field who have served much longer,
of much more merit and knowledge, and
who have seen much harder service, who
are not promoted. These things depend
upon puffing, and teasing and squeezing,
and then besides it is a great thing to
belong to Cincinnati, and to have many
friends to be "gratified" .
To S. Medary, Esq.
Dear Sir: I see that you have advo
cated in the Crisis the holding of a Pcm
ocratic Convention on the 8th of Janu-
uary. For the sake of the small matter
of success in the next election, and get
ting rid of bad candidates, most likely to
be chosen if the nomination should be
hurried. I hope that you will be content
with a postponement to .July 4th, if not
' to August or September. The fact is, the
, -. li.'
8th Of January has something about It
j that I would rather keep out of sight.
I
You muct not scare the Conservatives;
and you know that some of them will
have a recollection that your old Ilero
General Jackson was the first man who
ever declared Martial Law in the United
States j and the first who ever suspended
the writ of Habeas Corpus, and impris
oned a Judge for Lssuing it-and the
precedent might be a little in your way,
while denouncing Lincoln for the same
things. Let us take some other day for
awhile wait until we get into a war with
England, and then we can go back to the
glorious Eighth with a lusty vigor and a
glowing heart.
