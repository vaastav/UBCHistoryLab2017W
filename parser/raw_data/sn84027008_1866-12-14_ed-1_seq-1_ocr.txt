Soul Uer ii Loyalists.
A special despatch to the Baltimore
Sim says:
The "Southern Loyalists" met last
evening, and had in consultation with
them Messrs. Stevens, Sumner, et al.
of that ilk. Thc latter advised thc
"Loyalists" to get up a petition of
Southern loyalists to Congress, ask?
ing that the Southern States be treat?
ed as territories, provisional govern?
ors appointed, etc.
Hon. Hamilton Ward, of New
York, will introduce a bill in thc
House to-morrow providing for set?
ting aside tho present State Govern?
ments of the Southern States, thc
appointment of provisional govern?
ors by the chief justice, formation of
State constitutions aud governments
by conventions of delegates elected
by the people who are citizens of the
United States, except certain classes
who are designated as perjurers, gue?
rillas, murderers and editors of rebel
newspapers, who shall bc forever dis?
franchised.
The New York Tribune's corres?
pondent gives the following account
of their condition and proceedings:
The Southern Republican Associa?
tion met this evening, at their rooms
on F street, the Hon. Thomas J. Du?
rant, President, in I'JC chair. Sixty
members were present, each Stato
being fully represented, except North
Carolina and Arkansas, though twen?
ty-five citizens of thc former State
are'now on their way to Washington,
to participate in the deliberations of
the society and to care for the inte?
rests of the State during the session
of Congress. The association having
been counseled by leading members
of Congress, at a previous meeting,
as to the most expeditious method of
dealing with thc unreconstructed
States, the meeting of to-night was
given wholly to the discussion of this
question. Tho association declared
unanimously in favor of universal
suffrage; that the present State go?
vernments ought by Congress be de?
clared nullities, and that Congress
should devise some means of govern?
ing these districts or ?tetritories
through a loyal element. It is safe
to say the general sense of the mem?
bers present favored territorial go?
vernments for those districts South;
though some advocated that Con?
gress pass enabling acts and authorize
and protect the loyal people, irre?
spective of color, in these districts,
in forming new governments; others
contendiug that Congress had the
power to form thc governments. Two
propositions.were presented a:> plans
for re-organization and referred to
tho Committee of Twelve, who have
the preparation of suggestions for
Congress under consideration. The
first of these, by Judge Saffold, of
Alabama, was to authorize the ap?
pointment of two commissioners by
the United States District Judges in
each State, to constitute an advisory
board with said judge, to be a part of
the court or board which would carry
into effect an enabling act. Thc
second proposition was by Judge
Sherwood, of Texas, for Congress to
appoint commissioners for each State
to prepare a State Constitution, to
be approved by Congress, and submit
it to tho people for ratification. Dr.
Sidney, Corresponding Secretary, in?
troduced a delegation of colored men
from each of the several organiza?
tions in this city, who desired thc
co-operation of thc association in a
demonstration to be made next
Thursday in this city in favor ol'
colored suffrage. It was, on motion,
voted to join in the proceedings of
that day. The meeting adjourned at
a late hour to meet to-morrow night.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. -
The New York Express says:
We aro likely to have about as
many Constitutions in these United
States ns the French Directory made
for Franco, in their short-lived reign.
The world turns up but little new.
The radicals of this day are tho very
same as thc Jacobins of France and
the Greek and Roman radicals, that,
in the end, destroyed their republics,
and subjected them all to despotism.
There is nothing new in politics.
Every item of political new3 printed
daily is as old as 500 B. C.
Tile Intention.
Some few weeks ago a gentleman
from Jefferson County, Mississippi,
addressed a letter to Horace Greeley,
asking him, as one of thc leaders of
thc Republican party, what tito in?
tentions of the party wore with re?
ference to tl e South. Mr. Greeley
very courteously and promptly re?
plied in the following lotter:
ROCHESTER, New York, October
27, 1866.-DEAS Sm: Your letter
iiuds mc away from home, engaged
in our political canvass. Leaving,
with many others, I must answer hur?
riedly.
1. I know of uo considerable influ?
ential . ulioii of tho people, North or
West, who expect or desire any gen?
eral (or other) confiscation of South
em property. I am personally ac?
quainted with most abolitionists of
note-Gerrit Smith, Charles Sumner,
Governor Chase, etc., and not one of
them favors a policy of confiscation.
Thad. Stevens and Gen. Butler may
be exceptions, General Butler being
a nev/ convert from thc Democracy.
2. Even the tax on cotton-though
I thiuk it falls (especially) mainly on
the consumer, not the producer-is
certain to bc taken off very soon. It
is sustained only because ol' the need
of a local revenue.
3. I am very sure that no Southern
man who remains quietly at home
and attends to his business will ever
be troubled because of bis part in the
late rebellion. Assassins and house
burners may, sometimes, be prosecu?
ted; but oftener those who professed
to be unionists than those who were
rebels.
4. I think the general prevalent
sentiment of thc North was adverse
to any exaction of the South, with
regard to political rights for tho
blacks, till after the New Orleans
riots effected a decided change, and,
I think, it is uow the moro prevalent
opinion here that the better portion
of the Southern whites will never pro?
tect the blacks from outrage and mur?
der at the hanels of the low caste
whites, and that the right of suffrage
for the blacks, is indispensable to
their safety.
5. I think you mislead yourself by
a misuse of terms, when you talk of
the "equality of the whites and
blacks." In five New England States
their Constitution and laws make no
difference, and know none, between
whites and blacks; and yet, I think,
there is far less intercourse between
the whites and blacks in Boston (for
instance) than in New Orleans.
You do not ask me for advice out?
side your question, yet I venture to
proffer this counsel : Let the South?
ern States resolve to establish and
maintain, henceforth, a thoroughly
good understanding with tho South?
ern blacks. Encourage the latter to
hold conventions and select their best
men to confer with your best men,
resolved that a perfect, good under?
standing between the two races shall
be had.
I trust there is no more trouble
ahead; but in any case, such an un
derstandiug is of the gravest impor?
tance to all. Yours truly,
HORACE GREELEY.
IMPORTANT DECISION.-lu the Cir?
cuit Court of this County, yesterday,
in the case of Hooe r.s\ Tilston, in
which the plaintiff sued for the reco?
very of city property sold during the
war under a decree of Judge Under?
wood, Judge Thomas decided that,
by the provisions of the Constitution
of the United States, Congress could
not forfeit more than the life estate
of the party charged with the offences
stated in the Act of Congress provid?
ing for the confiscation of tho pro?
perty of persons engaged in the re?
bellion, and that as Daniel F. Hooe,
against whose property the proceed?
ings were instituted, had departed
this life, the plaintiff, his devisee,
was entitled to tho recovery of the
property. An appeal from this deci?
sion was taken, and the case will be
decided by the Supremo Court of tho
United States.

FAXLURE OF THE COTTON CROPS IN
NORTHERN GEORGIA.-A correspond?
ent of the Nashville Banner, writing
from Milledgeville, Ga., on the 5th
instant, says:
"We have finished picking cotton.
Never has such an event occurred
before, at thi.<-*ime of tho year, in
tho history cf lie country. The
drought and rust, and an early frost,
ruined our prospects for an average
crop of the snowy staple. We will
make a third of a crop-no more.
Below us, in some parts of Miller and
Decatur Counties, the worm finished
what thc rust and drought spared.
Owing to the shortness of the crop
of cotton, many of our farmers have
become discouraged, and sold out, to
try other pursuits."
? <. -?-?
The Tennessee Legislature has
passed a resolution to adjourn on thc
17th instant, and xueef siguin on the
. 1st of January.
Test Oaths.
Thc Nashville Union and Dispah lt,
j speaking of the decision of the Su
j promo Court on thc test oath., has thc
following excellent remarks:
Test oaths are choice engines of ty?
ranny. Under their cover, it is possi?
ble for thc party holding power to
commit any enormity. Thc principle
admitted, it can be made universally
?applicable. If, in forming our free
Government, tho fathers meant any
j one thing moro than another in the
list of inestimable franchises which
make up civil liberty, it was security
from proscription for opinion's sake.
They revolted from a Government
where the people had suffered umlei?
test oaths. They had no thought
that tho scheme of Government which
their toil and sacrifices had won
should contain a vestige of the odious
principle which sanction .J them.
They were careful to exclude it from
the Constitution, and never intended
that fair interpretation should find it
there. Not until within the last five
years in this country did any man
pretending to statesmanship think to
seek for it, and no man who had even
dared to speak '.vas thought to w ish
to use it. Tho frightful thing that
has been throttled by the ?Supremo
Court was an outgrowth of the civil
war-an appliance of tho mad ambi?
tion which provoked the contest,
prolonged the struggle, and now x>re
vents the return of pence. It is an?
tagonistic to free institutions. If it
prevails, they cannot stand. If wc
are to have liberty, it must be ex?
punged from the statute book. If it
is not, this once admirable Govern?
ment is to bc ruled in future, by a
succession of factions, each one in
turn increasing thc sweep and the
force of the oaths of exclusion it will
propound, until freedom is destroyed.
During hostilities, there was some
pretext for an oath of allegiance as a
measure of military precaution, but
it became a broad farce, useless for
any good purpose, and demoralizing
in its tendency. Buta political test
oath, such as that which now debars
a large mass of the people of this
country from civil affairs, is a monster
that caji never be tolerated by a free
people.
What action Congress and other
legislative bodies will take under this
decision remains to bo seen. It has
been charged that thc President, in
his message, advocated the applica?
tion of tho test oath to members of
Congress, but we do not perceive
that a fair reading authorizes such a
construction. We are certain that he
did not mean it in the sense that the
radicals in that body do. It is now,
perhaps, his duty to officially inform
Congress of the ruling of the Supreme
Courtjon this grave and vital ques?
tion, and recommend its appeal. At
any rate, it is tho duty of the con?
servative men in Congress and every?
where in the nation, through every
avenue of public opinion, to demand
that tho verdict of thc court of last
resort shall be respected.
Piton LOUISIANA.-A special de?
spatch to thc New York World, ?f
Monday, says:
Hereafter the classification of cot?
ton in New Orleans will be in confor?
mity to the Liverpool classification,
and quotations will be made and
published in accordance therewith.
It has been reported in Northern
papers that tho agent of the Freed?
men's Bureau at Bayou Sara was
murdered by rebels. Inquiry has
developed the fact that the deed was
actually committed by a Union man.
Deceased was highly esteemed by
people generally.

In the United States House of
Representatives, on tho5th inst., Mr.
Lawrence, from Ohio, from the Com?
mittee on the Judiciary, reported a
bill relating to the qualification of
jurors in United States Courts. This
measure relates to thejj selection of
juries in the prospective triaLs for
treason, and provides that a man
shall not be disqualified from being
a juror on account ci having formed
opinions from newspaper reports or
rumors, provided that the Court is
satisfied that he will render a verdict
I according to law and evidence.
THE RELIEF QUESTION IN GEORGIA.
It was no doubt a great relief to the
House of Representatives to get rid
of the relief question. The bill, as it
passed, may bo summed up in a very
few words; it repeals the stay law
so far as it authorizes the creditor to
collect one-fourth next January, and
postpones the time to January 1st,
1868,"when one-third may be collect?
ed, and one-third on tho first of
January, ltJGD and 1870. This, we
believe, is tho material feature of the
bill.-Milledgeville Union.

Thirty persons, charged with coun?
terfeiting, were arraigned before the
United States Court, in New York,
on Monday.
WHITE LABOE.-Thc Memphis Ap?
peal says the. system of white labor
which has been inaugurated by seve?
ral Southern communities, will surely
tend to develop the greatness of the
South, and if adopted by all the
States, will eventually populate this j
section with thc same proportion of j
the North. It will remove thc in?
dolent black Lem our midst, and
give us an energetic people who will,
in the course of time, put vigor and
life where the present freedman is
but an incubus. It will make main
radical changes, to be sure, but the
children of these white European
laborers will be educated by our peo?
ple, and their opinions willboformed
by thc teachhigs that surround them.
This, then, will bo an element not
only of vigor, but of strength to tho
South, and if carried out properly is
tho only method by which wc can
eventually out-vote thc North.. We
have tho territory, and only lack the
population to do it.

Thc Tribune has this Washington
despatch :
"It is stated here that last evening
Secretary Seward called on Mr. Thad?
deus Stevens at his rooms, and had
a long private interview with him.
The statement causes a great deal of
comment here, and much speculation
is rife to know what it all meant. The
above gentlemen have not been on
friendly relations with each othor for
several 3-ears. It is rumored that
Seward is repentant, like Raymond,
and wants to come back into the
bosom of the radical party. Others
think that Seward was sent by Presi?
dent Johnson to make overtures of
compromise."

WORDS OF VIT Ali INTEREST
Will the thousands who read columns of
frivolous verbiage every day devote five
minuter to the perusal of a few facts which
concern them nearly? Our text is Health,,
and wo will put our commentary into a nut?
shell. Weakness is indirectly the cause of
all sickness; for if nature bc strong enough
to resist the morbid influences which pro- 1
duce illness, of course they are powerless.
Seek strength, therefore. Invigorate and
regulate the system. When the quicksil?
ver ranges from 80 to OR degrees in the
shade, the most athletic are enfeebled and
thc weak arc prostrated. It is at such a
time that such an invigorated as HOSTET?
ET R'S STOMACH BITTERS is urgently
needed. What are the effects of this rare
vegetable tonic? Would that all who have
known its benefits could condenso their
experience into this paragraph. They
would tell the healthy, to protect their
lOalth they must use this great safeguard
against the debilitating influences. They
would exhort tho weak to discard all un
medicatod and impure stimulants and cling
to this wholesome and unfailing tonic and
alterative as tho shipwrecked mariner
would cling to a raft in a stormy 00a. They
would, of dyspeptic pangs relieved, of ap?
petite restored, of shattered nerves re?
strung, of headaches cured, of disordered
functions regulated, of hypochondria dis?
sipated, of miasmatic diseases baffled, of
fever and aguo cured, of liver complaints
arrested, of heat, privation and toilde?ed,
of hope re-animated and cheerfulness
restored. Such are the effects of Hostet
ter's Bitters. Dec 26 ti?
