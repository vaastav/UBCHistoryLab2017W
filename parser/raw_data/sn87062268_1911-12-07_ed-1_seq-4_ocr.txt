Silver Service
Presentation Ashore.
It was not th Intention of Tho
Journal nor are we now disposed to
have any controversy with the silver
service committee as to where the ser
vice shall be presented to the Battle
ship Florida. -
It the committee deems it best to
present the service ashore instead of
aboard the ship, that is satisfactory to
The JournaL ' v
"We simply throught that aboard the
ship was the proper place for one
thin-, and that the-exceptional oppor
tunity it would afford for getting a
motion picture; of Pensacola harbor
with the battleship in it was some
thing that the city could hardly afford
to pass up.
Such a picture made at the San Car
los hotel will: to us be very attractive
of course, but,, much as we think of
the beautiful San Carlos, we hardly
presumed a motion picture concern
would find sufficient material in the
picture of a hotel to induce picture
theatre patrons over the United States
to pay money to look at it when, pre
sented. . 1
On the other hand, a motion picture
ef the harbor, in mid-winter under a
bright Florida sun, with the battle
ships lying there at anchor, with hun
dreds f small craft playing about
them, with visitors thronging the
decks of the boats and ships, and with
the silver service being presented on
the broad deck of the battleship such
a picture The Journal thought
would be one which, would advertise
Pensacola's biggest asset and be worth
the trice of admission to all of the
thousands of picture-theatre patrons
who would be glad to pay to see it.
However, the matter seems to be
settled. The presentation will be made
on terra Anna, and the committee we
know will make the affair the great
success that it should be and will be.
Carnegie's "greatest men" did not
include our bachelor governor who
gave complete satisfaction as judge at
a baby show.
President Taft's
nr
message.
President Taft's message to congress
Is one well worth reading. It is well
worth reading for two reasons, first, it
It a well-written and forceful docu
ment, and second, It shows that he
seeks to evade the subject to which
the country is alive to today.
To The Journal it looks like he is
attempting to attract the public eye to
a proper regulation of the trusts, be
lieving that the tariff question will be
forgotten by this popular fad of trust
regulation.
The argument that President Taft
offers sounds reasonable and if his
recommendations as to trust regula
tion are successfully carried out, the
tllhli Trill Tint Yta unfoli-lir rloalt tl-4Vi
but his ideas are not new and have
been advocated by many others.
But trust regulation is not what the
people want at this time. President
Taft knows this as well as any other
person in America. He knows that it
is a "reduction in the tariffs that the
people want and will demand in spite
of his attempt to throw them off the
track on a recommendation of laws
that will operate against undue mo
nopolies. "We will not attempt to condemn the
message. It was a good one as far
as it went, but his failure to recom
mend a tariff revision disappointed,
we are sure, many of his best friends.
His failure to touch upon the one
important subject will not affect con
gress, however. The Democrats are
determined and the fact that thepresi
dent Ignored the tariff reform question
will not in any way Interfere with the
program.

later, Dix. We helped to elect Gov
ernors Wilson, Harmon Bass, and

AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION
FOR CHRISTMAS GIVING
Editor Pensacola Journal.
It has Just come to the knowledge
of the writer that the small pupils of
a well known private school have
banded themselves together for the
purpose of helping other and less for
tunate children enjoy the Christmas
festivities in a way long to be remem
bered. These children, God bless them, have
already raised a, small sum of money
by each one Contributing five or ten
cents which will purchase fruits, can
dies and nuts, and from now on until
Christmas these big-hearted little ones
propose to collect their discarded toys
and playthings and have them dis
tributed among' the families of the
poor, so that not a single child may
awake Christmas morning to find an
empty stocking.
What one school is doing may be
done by all of the schools in the city,
if there is some one in each room to
lead the Golden Rule movement.
Again, why not?

WHAT THE PEOPLE
OUGHT TO KNOW OF
r&itor Pensacola Journal.
Why was the water main put on
Davis street from Lee to Jordan, on
Jordan street to Twelfth avenue and
on Twelfth avenue to Strong street,
twenty-live blocks? This would af
ford fire protection to a few blocks on
.Alcaniz and Davis streets and Seventh
avenue and a few houses on the north
ern part of Twelfth avenue which are
already protected by a hydrant about
Avery street by a water main coming
from Fourteenth avenue across to
Ninth avenue- Perhaps thirty houses
w!.ich are not in reach of fire protec
tion might toe reached in this way. If
the water main could have been laid
on Seventh avenue to Scott street, and
r cross to Mid down Alcanis street, we
would have ninety houses on Hayne,
90 on Alcanis. perhaps 40 on Davis, 30
on Seventh avenue, 30 on Sixth ave
nue and 19 on Eighth avenue. In all,
nearly three hundred houses, while the
other way around woutd not reach
more than fifty houses at th most
We find about twelve blocks of unoc-

cupied lots on the southern part of
Twelfth avenue and about four more
on the northern part on the east side.
Then we have the "Fairnie Hill place,"
four more blocks, V-sides tiie streets
thaUaro enclosed. This will have to
be divided into lots in order to Bel! it.
Then ,we find about ten blocks on the
north side of Jordan street, all of
which are held for sale. This would
make 30 blocks, or 6U0 lots. These
lots, on account of domestic use of
water, fire protection and advantage
in insurance would certainly be in
creased in value fifty doila.rs each,
which would nipan thirty thousand
dollars, a free gift to the person who
owns them.
This is not all. One man who
bought a house and five lots near
Scott street some three years ago has
had his taxes raised each year. The
tirst year about $5, the second year $10,
and the third year $20. The . next
question is, how much was the taxes
raised on these vacant lots held for
speculation? ,
Thia was a northern man. Have all
the occupied lots been subjected to in
creased taxation or is his a special
case on account of being a northern
man.
Is this the way to induce immigra
tion to this city?

Lightning Kills Few.
In 190tf lightning killed only 169 peo
ple in this whole ' country. One's
chances of death by lightning are less
than two in a million. The chance of
death from liver, kidney or stomach
trouble is vastly greater, but not if

In addition to the above there are
quite a number of lay delegates, be
sides a large number of visitors who,
while not members of the conference,
are here for no other purpose than to
attend the meetings of the body and
many of them have business connected
with the conference. It is also proba
ble that quite a number of the min
isters who did not answer to their
names yesterday morning either were
already in the city or arrived later in
the day. Add to all of these the num
ber of visiting ministers and others
who are here in the interest of the
various connectional causes and this is
about the largest gathering of the
kind on record.
SECRETARY RE-ELECTED.
Rev. A. J. Lamar, who has served in
this capacity since the death of Rev.
J. M. Mason, several years ago, was
again elected conference secretary. He
immediately announced the selection
of his assistants as follows: G. Fon
taine, E. L. Crawford, A. E. Barnett,
C. H. Motley, II. S. Ellison. H. T.
Strout, H. M. Andrews J. C. James and
D. W. Haskew. and his selections were
ratified by tho conference.
The bar of the conference waa fixed
to include the space in front of the
columns supporting the gallery. This
bar is for the members of the confer
ence, but visitors are cordially wel
comed to attend all of the meetings
and ample seats for their accommoda
tion have been provided.
The hours of 8:30 and 12:30 were
fixed upon as the hours for meeting
and adjourning.
Communications.
After the standing committees,
nominated by the presiding elders, had
been elected, the following communi
cations were disposed of as follows:
Communication from the publish
ing committee of the M. E. Church,
South, was referred to the committee
on periodicals; communication from
the Sunday School department was re
ferred to the Sunday School board;
communication from the joint board
of education of the Alabama and "North
Alabama conferences was referred to
the conference board of education;
one from the Epworth League board
was referred to the Epworth League
committee; one from the board of
church extension was referred to the
conference board of church extension.
Report of Joint Commission.
A question which has been coming
up at every session of the Alabama
conference for a number of years was
touched upon at this session, when the
report of the joint commission from
the Alabama and North Alabama con
ferences, appointed for the purpose of
discussing the consolidation of the
Southern University at Greensboro,
Ala., and the Birmingham college, was
presented. This question has at one
or two sessions in the past called
forth some heated discussions and
hard controversies, but seems now to
be practically a dead issue, as it seems
impossible for the two conferences to
reach any agreement satisfactory .to
both.
The report recommended that the
joint board b continued, according to
the regulations already adopted; that
the board of trustees of the colleges
be elected by the conferences upon
the recommendation of the joint com
mission; that the' commission be in
corporated and that the boards of trus
tees of the respective colleges be vest
ed with the legal authority to act
legally for the conferences and to
have the authority to sell any prop
erty and transfer deeds to any college
property, etc.
E. L. Crawford, who when the fight
for and against consolidation was on,
was recognized as one of the leaders
of the opposition to the doing away
with the Southern University at
Greensboro, Introduced a resolution
relative to the report and the resolu
tion, together with the report of the
joint commission, was referred to the
board of education.
In his resolution Mr. Crawford
quoted the resolution adopted by the
H&ilh Alabama conference rescinding
the action of a previous session of the
Alabama conference on the matter.
Tho resolution also provides that the
Alabama conference will endeavor to
co-operate in making a greater college
at Birmingham, after the Woman's
College at Montgomery has been got
ten thoroughly under way, but would
let the matter rest for the present.
Hospital Commission.
Rev. J. E. McCann, chairman of the
hospital commission, read the report
adopted at a meeting of the commit
tee held in Montgomery Scrt. 27th.
The report shows some hospitals al

Rev. W. F. McMurry. D. D., secre
tary of church extension, and ono of
the foremost men in Southern Method
ism, having been Beveral times voted
upon for a bishop, was introduced and
addressed the conference. Dr. Mc
Murry said that he just dropped In to
attend the. conference for tho twenty
first time.
He spoke for sometime upon the
work of the board of church extension,
and, being a very entertaining and
forceful talker, his address was listen
ed to attentively and was enjoyed by
all who heard it, besides being in
structive. He complimented the Ala
bama conference, saying in the work
of church extension it stood fourteenth
from the top. He showed that 321 of
the C43 church buildings in the confer
ence were built partly with church
extension money.
He mentioned the great demand for
aid from this board in the southwest
and urged that it be given. He said
this section afforded an empire for
Methodism and contained unlimited
opportunities. In this connection Dr.
McMurry said that the lack of interest
in church work on the part of the
young people today was accounted for
by the lack of churches in which they
could work. "When sou contribute to
church extension." said the speaker,
"you are contributing to the very
foundation of the gospel and of the
church of God."
