Washington, Dec. 7.—In his annual
message, read to congress, President
Taft said:
To the Senate and the House of Rep
nsentatives:
The relations of the United States
With all foreign governments have con
*fllnued upon the normal basis of amity
CDd good understanding and are very
generally satisfactory.
Europe.
The American rights [in the fisheries
on the north Atlantic coast] undo* the
fisheries article of the treaty of 1818
have been a cause of difference be­
tween the United Stated and Great
Britain for nearly seventy years. The
Interests Involved are of great impor­
tance to the American fishing industry,
and the final settlement of the contro­
versy [by the permanent court of ar­
bitration at The Hague] will remove
source of constant irritation and com­
plaint. This is the first case involving
•uch great international questions
which has been submitted to the per­
manent court of arbitration at The
Hague.
Negotiations for an international
conference to consider and reach an
arrangement providing for the preser­
vation and protection of the fur seals
In the north Pacific are in progress
with the governments of Great Britain,
Japan and Russia. The attitude of
the governments interested leads me
to hope for a satisfactory settlement of
this question as the ultimate outcome
of the negotiations.
The Near East.
The quick transition of the govern­
ment of the Ottoman empire from one
of retrograde tendencies to a consti­
tutional government with a parlia­
ment and with progressive modern
policies of reform, and' public improve­
ment is one of the Important phenome­
na of our times. Constitutional gov­
ernment seems also to have made
further advance In Persia. These
•vents have turned the eyes of the
world upon the near east. In that
Quarter the prestige of the United
states has spread widely through the
peaceful influenccTOf American schools,
universities and= missionaries. There
la eivery reason why 'we should obtain
greater share of the commerce of the
near east since- the conditions are
more favorable now than ever before.
Latin America.
One of the happiest events in recent
pan-American diplomacy was the pa­
cific, independent settlement by the
governments of Bolivia and Peru of a
boundary difference between them,
which for some weeks threatened to
cause war and even to entrain im
bitterments affecting other republics
less directly concerned.
Our Citizens Abroad..
This administration, through the de­
partment of state and the foreign serv­
ice, Is lending all proper support to
legitimate and beneficial American en­
terprises in foreign countries, the de
free of such support being measured
by the national advantages to be ex­
pected. A citizen himself cannot by
contract or otherwise divest himself
of the right, nor can this government
ascape the obligation, of his protec­
tion in his personal and property
Irlghts when these are unjustly in­
fringed In a foreign country. To avoid
ceaseless vexations It is proper that in
considering whether American enter­
prise should be encouraged or support
ad in a particular country the govern­
ment should give full weight not only
to the national as opposed to the Indi
jrldual benefits to accrue, but also to
]the fact whether or not the govern­
ment of the country in question is in
Its administration and in its diplomacy
faithful to the principles of modera­
tion, equity and Justice upon which
Alone depends International credit in
diplomacy as well as in finance.
The Monroe Doctrine.
The pan-American policy of this
government has long been fixed in its
principles and remains unchanged.
With tha changed circumstances of the
TJnlted States and of the republics to
the south of us. most of Which have
great natural resources, stable govern­
ment and progressive ideals, tha ap­

prehension which gave rise to the
Monroe doctrine may be said to have
nearly disappeared, and neither the
doctrine as it exists nor any other doc­
trine of American policy should be
permitted to operate for the perpetua­
tion of irresponsible government, the
escape of Just obligations or the-insidi­
ous allegation of dominating ambition?
on the part of the United States.
My meeting with President Diaz and
the greeting exchanged on both Amer­
ican and Mexican Mil served, 1 hope,
to signalize the close and cordial rela­
tions which so well bind together this
republic and the great republic imme­
diately to the south, between which
there is so vast a network of material
interests.
I am happy to say that all but one
of the cases which for so long vexed
our relations with Venezuela have
been settled within the past few
months and that, under the enlight­
ened regime now directing the govern­
ment of Venezuela, provision has been
made for arbitration of the remaining
case before The Hague tribunal.
On July 30, 1909, the government of
Panama agreed, after considerable ne­
gotiation, to indemnify the relatives of
the American officers and sailors who
were brutally treated, one of them
having, indeed, been killed by the
Panaman police this year.
This government was obliged to in­
tervene diplomatically to bring about
arbitration or settlement of the claim
of the Emery company against Nica­
ragua. which it had long before been
agreed should be arbitrated. A settle
ment of this troublesome case was
reached by the signature of a protocol
on Sept. 18, 1909.
Many years ago diplomatic interven­
tion became necessary to the protec­
tion of the interests in the American
claim of Alsop & Co. against the
government of Chile. The govern­
ment of Chile had frequently admitted
obligation in the case and had prom­
ised this government to settle it. Then.'
had been two abortive attempts to do
so through arbitral commissions, which
failed through lack of jurisdiction.
Now, happily, as the result of the re­
cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov­
ernments of the United States and of
Chile, actuated by the sincere desire
to free from any strain those cordial
and friendly relations upon which both
set such store, have agreed by a proto­
col to submit the controversy to defin­
itive settlement by his Britannic majes­
ty Edward VII.
The Nicaraguan Trouble.
Since the Washington conventions of
1907 were communicated to the gov­
ernment of the United States as a con­
sulting and advising party this gov­
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another and in
turn by all of the five Central Amer­
ican republics to exert itself for the
maintenance of the conventions. Near­
ly every complaint has been against
the Zelaya government of Nicaragua,
which has kept Central America in
constant tension or turmoil. The re­
sponses made to the representations of
Central American republics as due
from the United States on account of
its relation to the Washington conven­
tions have been at all times conserva­
tive and have avoided, so far as possi­
ble, any semblance of interference, al­
though it is very apparent that the
considerations of geographic proximity
to the canal zone and of the very sub­
stantial American interests in Central
America give to the United States a
special position in the zone of these
republics and the Caribbean sea.
I need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these re­
publics, efforts which are fully appre­
ciated by the majority of them who
are loyal to their true interests. It
would be no less unnecessary to re­
hearse here the sad tale of unspeak­
able barbarities and oppression alleged
to have been committed by the Zelaya
government. Recently two Americans
were put to death by order bf Presi­
dent Zelaya himself. They were offi­
cers in the organized forces of a rev­
olution which had continued many
weeks and was in control of about
half of the republic, and as such, ac­
cording to tne modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations, they were
entitled to be dealt with as prisoners
of war.
At the date when this message is
printed this government has termi­
nated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government for reasons made
public in a communication to the for­
mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires and
is intending to take such future steps
as may be found most consistent with
its dignity, its duty to American in­
terests and its moral obligations to
Central America and to civilization. It
may later be necessary for me to bring
this subject to the attention of the
congress in a special message.
In the Far East.
In the far east this government pre­
serves unchanged its policy of support­
ing the principle of equality of oppor­
tunity and scrupulous respect for the
Integrity of the Chinese empire, to
which policy are pledged the interest­
ed powers of both east and west.
By the treaty of 1903 China has un­
dertaken the abolition of likin with a
moderate and proportionate raising of
the customs tariff along with currency
reform. These reforms being a mani­
fest advantage to foreign commerce as
well as to the interests of 'China, this
government is endeavoring to facili­
tate these measures and the needful
acquiescence of the treaty powers.
When it appeared that Chinese likin
revenues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers in connection with a
great railway project It was obvious
that the governments whose nationals
held this loan would have a certain
direct interest in the question of the
carrying out by China of the reforms
In question. The administration deem­
ed American participation to be of
great national, interest. Happily, when
It was as a matter of broad policy ur­
gent that this opportunity should not
be lost, the indispensable Instrumental­
ity presented itself when a group of
American bankers of International
reputation and great resources agreed
at once to share in the loan upon pre­
cisely such terms as this government
should approve. The chief of those
terms wae that American railway ma­
terial should be upon an exact equality
with that of the other nationals join­
ing in the loan in the placing of-or­
ders for this whole railroad system.
After months of negotiation the equal
participation of Americans seems at
last assured.
In one of the Chinese-Japanese con­
ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there
was a provision which caused consid­
erable public apprehension in that
upon its face it was believed Id some
quarters to seek to establish a monop­
oly of mining privileges along the
South Manchurian and Antung-Muk
den railroads and thus to 'exclude
Americans from a wide field of enter­
prise, to take part in which they were
by treatj' with China entitled. After
a thorough examination of the conven­
tions and of the several contextual
documents the secretary of state reach­
ed the conclusion that no such monop­
oly was intended or accomplished.
This government made inquiry of the
imperial Chinese and Japanese gov­
ernments and received from each offi­
cial assurance that the provision had
no purpose inconsistent with the poli­
cy of equality of opportunity to which
the signatories, in common with the
United States, are pledged.
Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continue cordial, as
usual. The arrangement of 1908 for
a co-operative control of the coming
of laborers to the United States has
proved to work satisfactorily. The
matter of a revision of the existing
treaty between the United States and
Japan which is terminable in 1912 is
already receiving the study of both
countries.
The Department of 8tate.
I earnestly recommend to the favor­
able action of the congress the esti­
mates submitted by the department of
state and most especially the legisla­
tion suggested in the secretary of
state's letter of this date whereby it
will be possible to develop and make
permanent the reorganization of the
department upon modern lines in a
manner to make it a thoroughly ef­
ficient instrument In the furtherance
of our. foreign trade and of American
interests abroad.
Under a provision of the act of Aug.
5» 1909, 1 have appointed three officials
to assist the officers of the government
In collecting information necessary to
a wise administration of the tariff act
of Aug. 5, 1909. As to questions of
customs administration they are co­
operating with the officials of the
treasury department and as to matters
of the needs and the exigencies of our
manufacturers and exporters with the
department of commerce and labor in
Its relation to the domestic aspect of
the subject of foreign commerce.
As a consequence of section 2 of the
tariff act of Aug. 5,1909, it becomes the
duty of the secretary of state to con­
duct as diplomatic business all the
negotiations necessary to place him in
a position to advise me as to whether,
or not a particular country unduly dis-.
criminates against the United States
In the sense of the statute referred to.
Government Expenditures and Rev,-,
enues.
Perhaps the most important ques­
tion presented to this administration
is that of economy in expenditures and
sufficiency of revenue.
The report of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures for the
current fiscal year ending June 30.
1910, will exceed the estimated re­
ceipts by $34,075,620. If to this deficit
are added the sum to be disbursed for
the Panama canal, amounting to $38.
000,000. and $1,000,000 to be paid on
the public debt/ the deficit of ordinary
receipts and expenditures will be in­
creased to a total deficit of $73,075,620.
This deficit the secretary proposes to
meet by the proceeds of bonds issued
to pay the cost of constructing the
Panama canal. I approve this pro-|It
The Panama Canal.
The policy of paying for the con­
struction of the Panama canal not
out of current revenue, but by bond
Issue, was adopted in the Spooner act
of 1902, and there seems to be no good
reason for departing from the princi­
ple by which a part at least of the
burden of the cost of the canal shall,
fall upon our posterity, who are
enjoy it, and there is all the more rea­
son for this view because the actual
cost to date of the canal, which is now
half done and which will be completed
Jan. 1, 1915, shows that the cost of
engineering and construction will be
$297,766,000 instead Of $139,705,200, as
originally estimated. In addition to
engineering and construction, the oth­
er expenses, including sanitation and
government and the amount paid for
the properties, the franchise and the
privilege of building the canal, in­
crease the cost by $75,435,000 to' a
total of $375,201,000. The increase in
the cost of engineering and construc­
tion is due to a substantial enlarge­
ment of the plan of construction by
widening the canal 100 feet in the Cut
lebra cut and by Increasing the di­
mensions of the locks, to the under­
estimate of the quantity of the work
to be done under the original plan and
to an underestimate of the cost of la­
bor and materials, both of which have
greatly enhanced In price since the
original estimate was made.
Government Economy.
order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year I directed the
heads of departments In the prepara­
tion of their estimates to make them
as low as possible consistent with im­
perative governmental necessity. The
result has been, as I am advised by
'W
the secretary of the treasury, that the
estimates of the expenses of the gov­
ernment for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1911—that is, for the next
fiscal year—are less by $55,663,000
than the total of appropriations tor
the current fiscal year and less by
$94,000,000 than the estimates for that
year. So far as the secretary of the
treasury is able to form a judgment as
to future income, there will be no
deficit in the year ending June 30,1911,
but a small surplus of $712,000.
In the present estimates the needs
of the departments and of the gov­
ernment have been cut to the quick.
For the purpose of securing informa­
tion which may enable the executive
and the legislative branches to unite
In a plan for the permanent reduction
ot the cost of governmental adminis­
tration the treasury department has
instituted an investigation by one of
the most skilled expert accountants in
the United States. The object of the
investigation is to devise means to in­
crease the average efficiency of each
employee. There is great room for im­
provement toward this end, not only
by the reorganization of bureaus and
departments and in the avoidance of
duplication, but also in the treatment
of the individual employee.
Under the present system it constant­
ly happens that two employees receive
the same salary when the work of one
is far more difficult and important and
exacting than that of the other. Su­
perior ability is not rewarded or en­
couraged.
Civil Pensions.
As the degree of efficiency in all the
departments is much lessened by the re­
tention of old employees who have out­
lived their energy and usefulness it
is indispensable to any proper system
of economy that provision be made so
that their separation from the service
shall be easy and inevitable, it is im­
possible to make such provision unless
there is adopted a plan of civil pen­
sions. We cannot, in view of the ad­
vancing prices of living, hope to save
money by a reduction in the standard
of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change
Is made in that regard an increase
rather than a decrease will be neces­
sary, and the only means of economy
will be In reducing the number of
employees and in obtaining a greater
average of efficiency from those re­
tained in the service.
Frauds In the Collection of Customs.
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds in the
collection of the customs revenue at
New York city, in which a number of
the subordinate employees in the
weighing and other departments were
directly concerned and in which the
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining company and others. The
frauds consisted in the payment of du­
ty en iiiKlrrvreights of sugar. The gov-
!k recovered from the Amer­
ican Uefining company all that
it i- s'r vn to have been defrauded of.
The sr. r.) w.-s received in full of the
amrunt c\ie which might have been
recovered by civil action against the
beneticinry of the fraud, but there was
an excess reservation in the contract
of settlement by which the settlement
should not interfere with or prevent
the criminal prosecution of every one
who was found to be subject to the
same.
Criminal prosecutions are now pro­
ceeding against a number of the gov­
ernment officers. The treasury de­
partment and the department of jus­
tice are exerting every effort to' dis­
cover all the wrongdoers, including the
officers and employees of the compa­
nies who may have been privy to the
fraud. It would seem to me that an
Investigation of the frauds by con­
gress at present, pending the probing
by the treasury department and the
department of justice, as proposed,
might by giving immunity and other­
wise prove an embarrassment in se­
curing conviction of the guilty parties.
Maximum and Minimum Clause In
Tariff Act.
Two features of the new tariff act
call for special reference. In order
that the maximum duty shall be charg
ed against the imports from a country
is necessary that the executive shall
find on the part of that country not
only discriminations in its laws or the
practice under them against the trade
of the United States, but that the dis­
criminations found shall be undue—
that is, without good and fair reason.
No one is seeking a tariff war or a con­
dition in which the spirit of retaliation
shall be aroused.
Tariff
Readjustment.
The new tariff law enables me to ap­
point a tariff board to assist me in con­
nection with the department of state in
the administration of the minimum and
maximum clause of the act and also to
assist officers of the government in the
administration of the entire law. I be­
lieve that the work of this board will
be of prime utility and importance
whenever congress shall deem it wise
again to readjust the customs duties.
If the facts secured by the tariff board
are of such a character as to show gen
erally that the rates of duties imposed
by the present tariff law are excessive
under the principles of protection as
described in the platform of the suc­
cessful party at the late election I
•hall not hesitate to invite the atten-
t*lpredicated
necessity for action there­
on. Nothing, however, halts business
and interferes with the course of pros­
perity so much as the threatened revl
sion of the tariff, and until the facts
are at hand, after careful and deliber­
ate Investigation, upon wfflch such re­
vision can properly be undertaken, it
seems to me unwise to attempt it.'
a War Department.
In the interest of Immediate econ­
omy I have required a reduction in
the estimates of the war department
for the coming fiscal year which
brings the total estimates down to an
amount forty-five millions less than

ihe corresponding estimates for last
year. This could be accomplished only
ky cutting off new projects and sus­
pending for the period of one year all
progress in military matters. For the
same reason I have directed that the
army shall not be recruited up to its
measures can hardly be more than
temporary, for I am sure that the in­
terests of the military establishment
•re seriously in need of careful con­
sideration by congress.
The secretary of war calls attention
to a number of needed changes in the
army, in all of which I concur, but the
point upon which I place most em­
phasis is the need for an elimination
bill providing a method by which the
merits of officers shall have some ef­
fect upon their advancement and by
which the advancement of all may be
accelerated by the effective elimination
of a definite proportion of the least
efficient.
The military and naval joint board
have unanimously agreed that it would
be unwise to make the large expendi­
tures which at one time were contem­
plated in the establishment of a naval
base and station in the Philippine Is­
lands and have expressed their judg­
ment. in which I fully concur, in fa­
vor of making an extensive naval base
at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and
not in the Philippines.
The Navy.
The return of the battleship fleet
from its voyage around the world in
more efficient condition than when it
started was a noteworthy event of in­
terest alike to our citizens and the
naval authorities of the world. The
marked success of the ships in steam­
ing around the world in all weathers
on schedule time has increased respect
for our navy and has added to our na­
tional prestige.
It Is a regrettable fact that the
higher officers are old for the respon­
sibilities of the modern navy, and the
admirals do not arrive at flag rank
young enough to obtain adequate train-
curtailment of recommendations for
naval appropriations so that they are
thirty-eight millions less than the cor­
responding estimates of last year, and
the request for new naval construction
Is limited to two first class battleships
and one repair vessel.
The secretary of the navy has inau­
gurated a tentative plan involving cer­
tain changes in the organization of the
navy department, including the navy
Legal. Procedure.
The deplorable delays in the admin­
istration of civil and criminal law have
received the attention of committees of
the American Bar association and of
many state bar associations as well us
the considered thought of judges and
Jurists. In my judgment, a change in
public procedure, with a view to re­
ducing its expense to private litigants
In civil cases and facilitating the dis­
patch of business and final decision in
both civil and criminal cases, consti­
tutes the greatest need in onr Ameri­
can institutions. 1 do not doubt for
one moment that much of the lawless
violence and cruelty exhibited in lynch
lngs are directly due to the uncertain­
ties and injustice growing out of the
delays in trials, judgments and the exe­
cutions thereof by our courts.
Injunctions Without Notice.
"We believe that the rules of proce­
dure in the federal courts with respect
to the issuance of the writ of injunc­
tion should be more accurately defined
by statute and that no injunction or
temporary restraining order should be
Issued without notice, except where
irreparable injury would result from
delay, in which case a speedy hearing
thereafter should be granted."
I recommend that in compliance with
the promise thns made appropriate leg­
islation be adopted. Moreover, every
such injunction or restraining order
issued without previous notice and op­
portunity by the defendant to be heard
should by force of the statute expire
and be of no effect after seven days
from the issuance thereof or within
any time less than that period which
the court may fix unless within such
seven days or such less period the in­
junction or order is extended or re­
newed after previous notice and 'op­
portunity to be beard.
's Anti-trust and lnt.r.Ut. Comm.™.
Laws.
The'jurisdiction of the general gov­
ernment over interstate commerce has
led to the passage of the so called
"Sherman anti-trust law" and the "in­
terstate commerce law" and its
amendments. The developments in the
operation of those laws call for a dis­
cussion and some suggestions as to
amendments. These I prefer to em­
body in a special message.
