Great Ranolie* in Texa*,
According to Dr. William 11. Maxwell,
New York City superintendent of schools,
and Dr. John J. Cronin, assistant chief
niedicsil inspector of the board of health,
it hits been demonstrated that surgery
can transform a had hoy into a good one.
This achievement, among others equally
beneficial, was the result of an operation
performed recently upon a pupil from a
school on tli<* lower east side, whose name
is withheld. Primarily the operation was
resorted to. not with the notion of im
proving the lad’s moral character, but for
the removal of a physical defect. For a
long time the hoy. who if about 14 years
old and the son of poor parents, had been
incorrigible in and out of school. After
the operation, which was for the removal
of adenoids, there was a surprising
change in the hoy. He became more cheer
ful, lost his surly manner, and, without
threats or coercion, hut merely in re
sponse to a kindly suggestion, he stopped
smoking cigarettes, a habit to which he
had been addicted. lie also developed a
quickness of apprehension and a readi
ness to study and is now considered a
model pupil.

Sl*ler* Who Will Work on Biineh.
An Adamless Eden in Texas is the
dream of Mary F. Hayden, the Chicago
novelist, who is arranging to establish a

ty, Texas. She has acquired title to
5,000 acres and is at work on the plans
for her colony. Woman colonists may
have husbands if that condition cannot
be avoided, but the males must be a
mere notch on a stick so far as the af
fairs of the colony are concerned. The
founder will endeavor to procure from
the Texas Legislature permission for
women to exercise the right of suffrage

the name of the wife. Everything that

raising and other kindred farm and ranch
pursuits.

EXPLOSION HURTS ELEVEN.
Flames Rnrn Over Several Acre*
at West Lynn, Mass.
A boiler explosion In the four-story
factory of the P. J. Harney Shoe Com
pany at West Lynn. Mass., destroyed the
factory, started a fire which swept over
several acres, burning three other fac
tory buildings, the Boston and Maine rail
road station and a number of small dwell
ings, besides causing injuries to eleven
persons. That there was no loss of life
is attributed to the fact that the explo
sion occurred just before the time for the
factory operatives to begin work. The
financial loss is estimated at $450,000.
Of the injured six are at the hospital.
None will die, it is believed. The first
firms to be burned out or wrecked by the
explosion were; P. J. Harney Shoe Com
pany. Tufts & Friedman Shoe Company,
H. P. Hood Creamery. Boston and Maine
West Lynn railroad station. Jacobs
Leather Stock Company and the M. J.
Worthley Shoe Company. The force of
the explosion burst the four machinery
loaded floors of the Harney factory and
lifted the roof. The wreckage spread
outward, shattering the walls of near-by
structures and aiding the spread of the
flames, despite the heavy storm of snow
and sleet. In a brief space of time the
West Lynn station of the Boston and
Maine railroad was on fire. Unchecked
by the gap occupied by the railroad
tracks, the flames reached structures on
the other side, licking up first the leather
stock factory of the Jacobs company and
then sweeping through the district cov
ered by small wooden tenements.

had been broken in three places. A
bloody spoke was found near by. She
recovered consciousness later, and said
her assailant was a white man, about 25
years old. The description fits that of

pany I. Engineer Corps, who escaped the
previous day from the federal military
prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.
JURY FREES EMMA RIPKE.
Refuse to Convict Knna* Girl of
the Murder of Frank K. Potts.
The jury in the case of Emma Uipke,
the Hanover (Kan.) girl charged with
the murder of Frank K. I‘otts on the
night of Oct. 15 last, returned a verdict
of not guilty. The case hinged on the
question of whether Potts committed sui
cide or was shot by the girl, and the evi
dence introduced to show that Potts had
frequently threatened to commit suicide
apparently outweighed that of the prose
cution.

CONFESSES FOUL ACT.
HALF-WITTED MAN ADMITS MUR
DER CHARGE.
David Cnrtla Telia Officer* that He
Slew Dona Gilman in Suburb of
Dayton, O.—Figrorea on Extent of
San Franciaco Fire.
“Yes. I did it; I am the murderer of
Dona Gilman.” Coolly and without the
slightest sign of emotion or remorse, Dan
Curtis made this confession to County De
tective Mcßride. Coroner Kline, Detec
tive Coleman of the Pinkerton agency
and Prosecuting Attorney Nevin. in the
prosecutor’s office in Dayton. Ohio. After
the confession had been made to the offi
cers Curtis broke down and cried like a
child. He was questioned closely as to
the truth of his story and declared posi
tively that he was the murderer and was
glad to make a confession to relieve his
mind. Curtis is 27 years old and earned
a precarious living selling newspapers.
He is half-witted and at times has labor
ed under delusions that he was a great
detective. Among newsboys Curtis was
known as “Baby Dave.” Many of those
who knew him allege his story is partly
the result of his own disordered imagina
tion and that he really had no connection
with the crime. Dona Gilman, a 20-year
old girl, was attacked and strangled to
death Tuesday evening, Nov. 20, within
fifty yards of her home on Arlington
Heights, a suburb of Dayton, while re
turning home from work. Her body was
discovered by her 10-year-old brother, Col
lins, two days later, lying in a vacant
lot nearly opposite the Gilman home. Her
fellow employes at the National Cash
Register Company subscribed $4,000 as a
reward for the capture of the murderer.
TOWN RUINED IIV FLOOD.
Deluge Sweeps Away Business Part
of Clifton, Aria.
Confirmatory news comes of the al
most total destruction of the business sec
tion of Clifton, Ariz., and the loss of
at least sixty lives in a flood that swept
down the San Francisco river and Chase
creek. Mrs. Joseph Throm, her hus
band, and children were caught in a fall
ing building. The woman was killed.
The other members of the family had
narrow escapes. One of the saloons
which was washed away carried several
men into the torrent and all are believed
to have drowned. A woman and a child
were lost in a small restaurant which
was dashed to pieces in the flood. A
number of small frame buildings in which
people were known to be living were also
destroyed. It is feared that a number
of families perished. The works of the
Arizona Copper Company in that sec
tion were filled with the wreckage of
buildings, bowlders, and mud. Damage
was done iu North Clifton, several stores
and many residences being washed down.
Patterson’s addition was almost entirely
wiped out. East Clifton was greatly
damaged and many buildings were de
stroyed. In South Clifton less damage
was done. Clifton is a town in Graham
County, southeastern Arizona. The place
has a population of 3,500.

I' hy Ex-. Judge Webber of Minnesota
Took Ills Life by Hanging.
Ex-Judge B. F. Webber, twenty-four
years on the bench of that district, com
mitted suicide yesterday by hanging in
New Ulm, Minn. Fear of the poor
house, although his wealth was estimated
at SIOO,OOO, drove the jurist to take his
life. Large medical bills for the treat
ment of his wife, who has been a para
lytic for years, led the former judge to
believe that his accumulations of years
of arduous work on the bench and at the
bar would be dissipated shortly. Mr.
Webber was to have been the guest of
honor at a banquet tendered him by the
Brown County Bar Association, in honor
of his long service on the woolsack, from
which he resigned only a few weeks ago.

finally have paid undoubtedly in the
neighborhood of SO per cent of the amount
of insurance involved.”

NO MORE WHITE SUGAR.
New Pure Food Law Will Knock Out
the Highly B eached Article.
The pure food law that goes into effect
Jan. 1 is far reaching in its provisions,
but if carried out will without doubt
result in much good to the community
and will probably lessen in a measure
the stomach troubles so prevalent. There
will be no more white sugar offered for
sale after the new law becomes opera
tive. There will be loaf and granulat
ed sugars as at present, but the color
will be a dull yellowish white, not very
attractive to the eye, but much more
healthful than the article known to trade
for fifty years or more as “white sugar.”
Washing bluing is used to impart the
snow white color and Uncle Sam has
decided that it is better for the health
of the country to put aside the washing
bluing and get back to first principles.
Tinned vegetables, notably tomatoes,
green peas, and some kinds of string
beans will not have the appearance of
having been so freshly picked as for
merly. but the coloring will be natural.
Xo effects in coloring will be permitted,
except that provided by nature. Mar
malades and preserves, that tempt the
eye before the palate, will not be quite
so attractive, and if there is a slight
scum on the jar, skim it off and say
nothing. It is simply proof that pre
servatives have not been used.
Mustard, which generations of the
people have come to regard as yellow—•
never having seen any that was not
adulterated—will be gray and butter
will be nearly white.
Tinned meats will probably lose their
popularity, for it is expected the prices
will be about doubled. Some of the so
called tinned meats and game offered are
made of a combination of corn meal and
condiments that look inviting, but have
very little food value. They are put up
at small cost, have a delicious flavor, but
they are not meats and game, and it is
not expected housekeepers will buy tin
ned cornmeal when they know just* what
it is as told by the label on the can.
The new law makes no reference to
eggs and the cold storage brand can be
disposed of as the integrity of the dealer
decides. Refrigerated meats and bread
stuffs are not mentioned in the law.
After Jan. 1 all goods shipped from
factories will go out with a guarantee
that they are as represented; that there
is no false labeling. The penalty for
% lolating a law is not more than one vear
in a federal prison or SSOO fine or both,
and for a second offense the penalty is
doubled.

TAFT CALLS THEM MURDERERS.
Secretary on Negro Soldiers Who
Killed at Brownsville, Tex.
President Roosevelt's action in dismiss
ing from the army three companies of
negro troops in the Twenty-fifth infantry,
as a penalty for the outrage at Browns
ville, Texas, is warmly defended by Sec
retary of War Taft in his annual report.
The report, after pointing out that the
President's order has been severely criti
cised because it condemns the innocent to
undeserved punishment, thus reviews the
incident:
"Out of a battalion of 170 enlisted men
in the army of the United States, from
nine to twenty men formed a preconcert
ed plan to revenge themselves upon the
people of a town in which they were sta
tioned for the insults they felt that the
townspeople had heaped upon them. In
accordance with the plan, they left the
barracks under cover of darkness—-about
midnight—and proceeded to discharge
their weapons into the houses of the
town for the purpose of killing those
against whom they felt a grievance.
“They came near killing someone or
more of the three women and seven chil
dren who were sitting or sleeping in two
of the lighted rooms into which they fired.
They, in fact, did kill one man. wound
another and seriously injure the chief of
police. They accompanied their firing
with expressions indicating the malice
which prompted their action. There can
be no doubt, therefore, that the squad of
men who moved together from the fort to
the town and did this shooting were
guilty of murder, and murder in the first
degree.”
Sugar Trust Fined.

the rules of the central council, but all
witnesses said that no such agreement
existed at the present time.

The socialist congress at Limoges,
France, rejected a motion favoring insur

The interpretation of the recent munici
pal elections in England, held by the
Unionists, is that they prove a strong
anti-government feeling and a decided set
back for labor candidates and municipal
socialism. The latter had held the bal
ance of power in London for three years.
Premier Campbell-Bannerman told a
deputation of liberal and labor members
of the House Tuesday that the matter
of old-age pensions would soon be taken
up as one of the government’s policies. He
thought that the scheme would favor
thrift and independence. Chancellor of
the Exchequer Asquith also agreed to
this proposition.
During the inaugural banquet of the
new lord mayor of London, Sir William
Purdy Treloar, the Marquis cf Richon,
who was the heief speaker, dealt with
the Congo State abuses and cruelties,
and declared that if Belgium did not put
things to right soon Great Britain would
consult other powers, with a view to a
concert to remedy existing evils.
Replying to the deputation composed
of men representing various creeds and
parties w r ho complain of the atrocities
committed in the Congo Free State, the
British foreign secretary. Mr. Grey, said
that if the Belgian government failed to

would inquire of the other powers what
their views were and seek a concert of
action.
The Canadian government has notified
the United States that the postal treaty

to second-class mail matter, the object
being to exclude from Canadian territory

if new regulations are formed to shut out
such objectionable publications, anew
treaty will be entered'into.
Owing to the continued disorder and
unsafety of foreign residents in Morocco,
the Spanish and French governments
have now sent warships to Tangier, and
it is expected that a British squadron
will follow. A crisis is threatened by
the granting of increased powers to Rais
Uli, the bandit. The European powers
are acting harmoniously and will send
troops ashore under one commander in
case the Moors take a hostile course.
In the Belgian chamber of deputies at
Brussels the minister of foreign affairs,
referring to i.he recent warning from offi
cers of the British government, concern
ing alleged Congo abuses, said that Bel
gium would pursue a line of action dic
tated by her own interests without regard
to British interference. On Wednesday
the socialists moved to refuse the terms
of King Leopold’s will, bequeathing the
Congo to Belgium on condition that the
royal domains be maintained after its
annexation.
A sign that the Russian government's
preparing to bold elections for anew
douma is the action of the Senate in in
terpreting the election law without ap
peal. It has declared that railroad em
ployes who inhabit buildings owned by
the government cannot vote, and this will
exclude 170,000 workmen from the fran
chise. It includes machinists, signal
men, guards and repairers. The decision
also removes 8,000 employes of factories
owned by the War and Navy Depart
ments. The Senate has also made a
sweeping reduction in the peasant bank.
The object of these rulings is to secure
more acceptable returns from the next
election than from the last one.
After M. Jaures had announced in the
French Chamber of Deputies that his
party was weary of the church and state
controversy, and had decided to support
the government, a vote of confidence re
sulted in 416'ayes and 163 noes. This
means that the chamber will support the
government in a firm policy of execut
ing the separation law as it stands. The
minister of education assured the cham
ber that no negotiations would be had di
rectly with the Vatican, and that plans
were on foot to assist the local and dio
cesan religious associations in organiz
ing their dependent houses of worship.
A decree issued by the Czar shows the
government’s program to be the separa-t
tion of the peasant question from all
other branches of political agitation. It
proposes to remedy the peasant's griev
ances without reference to the action
the douma. The plan is to permit an 7
peasant to abandon his share in the coa.
men ownership of village land and be
come an individual freeholder. Its ex
pected effect in the coming elections is to
return a large number of independept
peasants to the douma. The labor party
leaders violently assail the governm&it
for thus attempting to solve the labd
problem without the advice or consult
of the legislative branch.

members of the lower house, who died
since the last session. The reading of
the message in the House consumed two
hours and twenty-five minutes. During
the major portion of the time Representa

TREASURY FULL OF GOLD.
Secretary Shan't. Report Show*
Country’* Great Prosperity.
The unprecedented prosperity of the
United States is reflected in the report
of the retiring Secretary of the Treas
ury. Mr. Shaw, whose statistics were
filed with the House.
Never before has there been so much
gold in the United States treasury, ac
cording to the report. On Oct 15 there
was $871,893,899.77 of the precious
metal stored in the vaults. Of the
5.380 chartered national banks, 448
failed and 1,743 were placed in volun
tary liquidation, and since the estab
lishment of the national banking sys
tem in 1863. statistics show that cred
itors of these insolvent institutions re
ceived 78 per cent of their claims, on
an average. The money in circulation
in the United States now amounts to
$2,736,646,628. or $33.08 per capita.
The outstanding principal of the public
debt on June 30 was $895,159,140, an
increase of SBOO. Including the issue
of Panama bonds the public debt Nov.
1 was $925,159,250,
The past fiscal year shows the larg
est customs receipts in the history of
the country. Over $3,000,000 was col
lected in customs.
In speaking of the weakness of the
currency system, Mr. Shaw says that
the harvest of 1906 strained well nigh
to the limit the credit possibility of the
country, and as to his action at the
time, which met much criticism, he
says;
“The government quarantines against
yellow fever; it sjtends millions to pro
tect the people against unwholesome
food; it inspects banks in the interest
of depositors, and does a thousand oth
er things to safeguard the people
against disaster of various kinds. This
policy of governmental supervision re
ceives universal approbation. Believ
ing it to be the duty of the government
also to protect the people against finan
cial panics, which in this country have
caused mc.re mental and more physical
suffering than all the plagues known to
man, and recognizing that under our
system no possible co-operation can be
secured among banks, each independent
of the other, and finding these institu
tions in the interior sending their mon
ey to be loaned on call in the cities, and
the reserve of the country, even in the
idle season, very low, the Secretary of
the Treasury undertook the vask of
making some slight provision for the
inevitable. He withdrew from the chan
nels of trade $00,000,000 and locked it
up. This was accumulated in part by
excessive revenues and in part by de
liberate and premeditated withdrawals.
His only excuse for withdrawing the
people’s money when they did not need
it, and when its presence invited spec
ulation, was to have it ready to restore
when they did need it, and when its
absence would bring certain disaster.”
Secretary Shaw points out various
ways in which the dealings of his de
partment with national banks could be
put upon such a basis as to act as a
preventive of panics here and abroad.
In this connection he says: “If the
Secretary of the Treasury were given
$100,000,000 to be deposited with the
banks or withdrawn as he might deem
expedient, and if in addition he were
clothed with authority over the re
serves of the several banks, with power
to contract the national bank circula
tion at pleasure, in ray judgment no
panic as distinguished from industrial
stagnation could threaten either the
United States or Euroi>e that I could
not avert”
The Secretary’s report is issued in
the revised spelling form, as advocated
by President Roosevelt.
The manager of the Burlington lines
has notified all clerks, stenographers and
technical workers that if they join a union
they will be discharged.
An official of rhe Pennsylvania railroad
announces that work will soon be started
on a great power plant and dam, just
west of Harrisburg, on the Susquehanna,
to electrify the Pennsylvania railroad be
tween Philadelphia and Pittsburg.
The demand of the trainmen on the
Reading railway for a ten-hour day was
rejected by General Superintendent Tice.
The men were told that as an increase
in wages had been granted nothing more
could be expected for the present.
President Earling of the St. Paul road
confirms the report that his company is
to build a cut-off between the northern
division and the valley division, thereby
shortening the line to the northern penin
sula, by way of Star Lake, by more than
fifty miles.
The ruling of the interstate commerce
commission that a railroad may not issue
transportation in exchange for advertising
in newspapers is to have a legal test
through a case brought by the Monon.
President McDoel has ordered the con
tinuance of contracts for transportation
in payment for advertising.
The firemen and engineers of the New
York Central lines have reached a settle
ment with the officials by which all will
get a substantial increase in wages and
a ten-hour work day for all branches of
the service. A similar advance in other
branches of '.he service was expected.
At the close of the fiftieth year of con
secutive payments of dividends the Penn
sylvania Railroad Company placed its
stock upon a 7 per cent basis, which is 1
per cent higher than had been paid since
1900. As the capital of the company has
grown the number of stockholders has in
creased to about 45,000.
The Delaware, Lackawanna and West
ern railroad has given an order for three
locomotives which will be as big again
as the largest now in service. These
monsters are to have sixteen driving
wheels and will haul a train of 150 load
ed cars over steep grades.
The general strike of switchmen on all
of the twenty-three railroads entering
Chicago, which was threatened, was call
ed off pending further negotiations be
tween the union and managers. The union
leaders later accepted the offer of 3 cents
an hour advance and left the remaining 3
cents asked for to be decided by arbi
tration.
In the election of James T. Ilarahan
as president of the Illinois Central rail
way by a vote of 8 to 4 in a special meet
ing of the directors at New York the
other day, came the climax of the finan
cial rivalry between E. H. Harriman and
Stuyvesant Fish; thus Harriman realized
his ambition to control a transcontinental
railroad system, the Illinois Central be
ing the one missing link in making such
a system profitable.
Frederick Rutter. a clerk, was suffo
cated and Andrew Erickson, also a clerk,
was injured probably fatally in a fire in
a three-story tenement house in Smith
street, Brooklyn.

CHICAGO.
Business generally exhibits no loss of
strength, although the period has ar
rived when a falling off in new de
mands is natural. That the volume of
production and distribution sustains
an unprecedented aggregate is affirmed
by continued gains in freight earnings
and by a total of bank exchanges this
week establishing a higher record than
any heretofore. Eastern demand for
accommodation is rcpsonsible for the
prevailing firm discount rate, but the
return of currency from the interior
soon may make easier conditions in
money. It is noted that local offerings
of commercial paper have moderated,
indicating that financial requirements
arc mainly provided for until the turn
of the year.
Some heavy consumers find it more
difficult to obtain necessary supplies
and difficulties in transportation have
extended, making deliveries within a
reasonable time almost impossible.
Itailroad efforts to relieve the conges
tion are handicapped by the severe
weather in some sections, yet it is seen
that new equipment is coming forward
more extensively and tends to make
the outlook less discouraging to ship
pers.
Retail activity is much stimulated
by tbe presence of many visitors and
the demand for seasonable and Christ
mas goods steadily expands. Whole
salt* orders for spring lines compare fa
vorably with those of this time last
year, and country advices testify to an
enhanced buying power and gratifying
headway in sales of winter merchan
dise. Manufacturing operations meet
with no impediments, except such ass
arise from scarcity of labor and ma
terials.
Failures reported in the Chicago dis
trict number twenty-six, against twen
ty-two last week and thirty-four a year
ago.—Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK.
Colder weather, combined with the
approach of the holidays, has greatly
stimulated retail trade at most points
and the outlook favors a record break
ing Christmas trade. The car shortage
continues, though grain deliveries in
the Northwest are freer, but on the
whole the paucity of railway facilities
is seriously affecting many sections,
and in consequence some foundries iu
the St. Louis and Cleveland districts
have been compelled to close. Manu
facturers are busy the country over,
the pressure being so great as to cause
a considerable number of plants to
work night and day. Labor still con
tinues scarce, and wage advances are
recorded generally, but the tendency
to avoid higher wages seems to be un
dergoing continuous expansion. Money
is high in the cities where tin* demand
is extensive, but most interior towns
appear to be plentifully supplied, hence
country bankers arc seeking commer
cial paper.—Bradstreet's Mercantile
