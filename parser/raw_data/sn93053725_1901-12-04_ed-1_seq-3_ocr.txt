A very pretty wedding occurred; at
the home of Mr and Mrs G. M. Grilley
on Main street at noon to-day when
their daughter Ella and Dr J. F. Holy
rod were united in marriage by Dr
Anderson, pastor of the First Congre
gational church of Waterbury. The
house was prettily decorated for the
occasion with flowers, ferns and potted
plant3. The costumes of the bride
and bridesmaid were very beautiful.
Both the groom and bride are well
known and popular young people in
th3 section and are members of the
Young People's society of St Paul's
church." . They were the recipients of
many pretty tokens of esteem from
their many friends. After a short
wedding reception Dr and Mrs Holy
rod left on the 2:40 train for a wed
ding tour to New York" and Port Jef
ferson. On their return they will re
side In the apartments now occupied
by Dr Holyrod.
"The storm was rather fierce in this
section last night. The trolley cars
were anything but on time. The side
walks are still in a bad condition and
people will have to be careful, in plac
ing their steps.' The people in this
section would like to know whether the
sidewalks are to be cleaned by the
Welton family as in the past. In for
mer years the sidewalks and paths
across the street were cleaned with a
horse and plough owend by the II. L.
Welton family. To defray the expenses
of thi3 work subscriptions were col
lected from the different residents by
George Stevens. Sometimes the pro
ceeds of these collections .were turned
over to St Paul's church. Mr Stevens
has not an yet put in an appearance
for the collections and the people are
wondering whether the old plan, which
worked to perfection, will be aban
doned. They hope that it will be con
tinued as It will be of the greatest
benefit to the community.
The pool match at Bride's pool room
last night was very interesting owing
to the closeness of the score. The
Berbecker & Rowland and the Cutlery
shop teams were rather evenly match
ed, and It wa-s only after a hard
fought game that the former won by
the close score of 100 to 97. Some
brilliant shots were made by the play
ers of both teams. G. Lang made
the biggest score for the winners, while
William Draper carried off the honors
for the knife shop. . The teams were
composed cf the following players:
Berbecker & Rowland. G. Lang, James
Haxton. B. Walsh: knife shop, Wil
11am Draper, Charles Draper, L. Dy
son. Don't forget that the necessary
blanks may be received from Postmas
ter George H. Ford so as to hand in
EUbscrlDtion-3 to the McKiniey National
Memorial association which is plan
ning the erection of a monument at
Canton in honor of him whom the
hand of a. deadly assassin deprived the
nation a short time since. Every per
son should contribute his mite toward
the erection of thismonument to the
deceased president. It Is not expect
ed that the people will contribute large
sums for this purpose, but that every
person will contribute a little to show
his esteem for him whose memory will
linger forever in the minds of the peo
ple of thi3 great nation.
At the home of Mrs B. D. Welton
to-morrow evening the St Paul's par

MEMORIAL RESOLUTIONS.
Presented in Honor of Late President
McKiniey.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Not in
many years have the members of the
house listened with such rapt attention
to the annual message of a president
of the United States as they did yester
day to the reading of the first message
of President Roosevelt. Every word
v;a.3 followed intently from the an
nouncement of the tragic death of
President McKiniey in the opening sen
tence to the expression of the closing
wish that our relations with the world
would continue peaceful. The reading
occupied two hours, but not over a
dozen members left their seats until it
was concluded. Several times there
was applause, and at the conclusion
there was an enthusiastic demonstra
tion on the Republican side.
On motion of Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio
that portion of the message relating
to the death of the late president was
referred-to a committee to consist of
one member from each state . to join
a similar committee of the senate to
consider and report by what token of
respect and affection it may be proper
for congress to express the deep sensi
bility of the nation to the tragic death
of the late president. The" speaker ap
pointed a committee, headed by Mr.
Grosvenor, and then as a further mark
of respect the house adjourned.
It was not until the session of the
house closed that the weary clerks
were able to catch up with Monday's
deluge of bills and' begin sorting the
further deluge of yesterday.
! The president's annual message to
congress went In this j-ear for the first
time In print. The two copies for the
two houses were printed on paper of
the same size as that which was used
heretofore for the written copies,
though the paper is a heavy white in
stead of the blue tint which has been
inuse. Each copy was richly bound
In brown morocco, with stiff covers,
with simple gold border and lettering,
the words on the front being, ''Mes
sage of the President of the United
States."
The senate listened to the first mes
sage of President Roosevelt and adopt
ed a resolution directing the appoint
ment of a committee to co-operate with
a like committee from the house to con
sider by what token of respect and af
fection congress might express the sor
row of the nation upon the tragic
death of the late President McKiniey.
The message was delivered soon after
the senate met. The reading occupied
nearly two and a half hours and was
listened to with marked respect by the
senators. The first portion, dealing
with the Buffalo tragedj-, excited the
most profound interest in the" senate.
At the conclusion of the reading of
the message Mr. Foraker, senior sena
tor from Ohio, presented the McKiniey
resolution, and as a further mark of
respect the senate adjourned.

Gominsssion Auction.
A new business just started which, strange .Jthougu it may appear to
day, is of interest to every citizen of Waterbury and vicinity, aud will be
found to be a great boon to a great in any. I will now explain in detail the
purpose of this institution. If you desire at any time to dispose of any of
your furniture or household goods of any description, bric-a-brac, diamonds,
jewelry or discarded clothing in good condition, or if in business and you
wish to dispose of any surplus stock Or shopworn goods, and to get it done
quickly and at a fair price, all you need do is to drop me a postal card,
asking me to call, or come to my office and leave your order and I will,
Avithout delay, send a reliable person with team for any articles you wish to
sell, and on my regular auction days, Thursdays and Fridays, dispose of
them to the best advantage I can, even if some of the articles be worth five
cents only, deduct a small commission, aud deliver to each customer prompt
ly the proceeds of such sales, with a full account of each transaction the day
following the auction.
By this method you will be enabled to roach the consumer direct and
withoutany unnecessary delay or publicity, as all business will be confiden
tial. In addition to all this you will doubtless receive three times as much
as yo'ii could get from any secondhand dealer.
' While those who wish to sell will have the best opportunity to do so
here, bargain seekers will bo equally sure to receive many an article that
they need at a saving to their pockets.
By strict integrity and careful attention to the wants of my patrons, I
intend to gain the confidence of the public. Meanwhile I am prepared to
give ample security for any or all articles sent to the auction room.
'Respectfully yours,
JOSEPH SABSOVICII, Auctioneer.
P. S. The first auction sale will b e held on Thursday and Friday, De
cember 19 and 20, from 2:30 to 10, o'clock p. m., and every Thursday and Fri
day thereafter from 2:30 to 10 p. m., at the Brass City Furniture Co's store,

uuys before the sale so that I may have ample time to advertise.
