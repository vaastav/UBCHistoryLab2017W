Xo lniortnnt | measure linn over been 1 I
enaeted by confess without meeting |
with frivolous objections. The proposed
l > . stal savins * system la.no exception to
this rule. The free delivery of letters
nnd tht ? postal money order were In
augurated In spite of tlie protests of the
mossbaek element of the country nnd
even the establishment of national hanks
was opposed by bankers who now re
gard them as the bulwark of our ilnan-
clal system.
The main objections to postal savings
hanks usually focus In two questions :
How shall the money deposited be safely
Invested ? What will be the effect of
establishing postal savings banks on tin ;
existing savings bank system ? The llrst
question suggests another question , Why
has the government never been tioubled
with the Inveatment of Ihe money wb'eh '
It borrowed from bankers on interest
bearing bonds ?
If the government has managed to
kocp safe the hundred ) ? of millions ot
mom-y borrowed from -capitalists at
home nnd abroad on securities drawing
from II to 0 per cent Interest without
providing for Its * Investment why , should
the government bar Itself from borrow
ing ; money from the common people who
would be Kind to offer their savlnsiit to
Its keeping for I/ ! , or even - per cent
because there Is no place to Invest the
money ? The government has now mini ;
than .f. > ( K,000.0X ) ( ) lylnj ; Idle In the treas
ury and yet nobody In or out of congress
has yet proixwed to Invest any part of it
at Interest. The most liberal estimate of
the iniixliinnn amount of deposits which
would accumulate at any time hi a lim
ited postal savings bank Is $1100.000.01 )0 ) ,
or about 15 per cent of tile apn-0ate
deposits of existing private savings
hanks. If these Institutions can not bear
the strain of losing from 10 to 15 per
cent of their deposits they must bo wc.tk
Indeed.
The apprehension that government
competition with Its limitations on tlu >
amounts receivable from depositors and
Its low rate of Interest will be fatal to
tlie continuance of the existing savings
banks Is groundless. If It were well
founded it would bo the strongest argu
ment In favor of the postal savings bank
system. That system is advocated
chiefly for the protection of the wage-
workers whose industry and thrift ena
ble them to lay by a part of their earn
ings to acquire a homo or for the emer
gencies of sickness or enforced idleness.
1'liis class of people have been tlie prin
cipal sufferers from bank failures and
are always least able to bear the losses
intlicted by bank mismanagement or
dishonesty. If the government can protect -
tect these people fully at an expense of
from ? "i,0X,000 ( ) to ? 0,000,000 , per annum
paid out as Interest for strengthening
its financial system , tlie money will be
profitably Invested.
It Is safe to assert that postal savings
banks will in no way come Into competi
tion with existing banks In the money
loaning business or In the purchase of
mortgages and other securities. That
function should never be exercised by
the government cither through the po&r-
olllce or the treasury. On Ilici contrary ,
postal savings banks can be made a ma
terial help to tlie hanking system by
using tlie postotllces as a repository of
the greenbacks. Instead .of retiring the
greenbacks , as advocated In some quar
ters , or Imprisoning them in the treasury
as proposed by others , the greenbacks
can be absorbed as the reserve for the
repayment of postal savings deposits.
Instead of being concentrated In th > >
great money centers , the greenbacks
would thus be distributed over fae en
tire country through from 7,000 to 10,000
postctilces , preventing the repetition of
the endless chain by which the treaHiiiy
could lc ) drained of Its gold In a fuw
days. While being absorbed by tin-
postal savings banks the greenbacks
would remain available for circulation
among the masses. This feature would
In itself make the postal savings bank
system invaluable as an adjunct to the
treasury.
NA Tl Off A I , QUA IIA X T1A B.
Senator Caff cry of Louisiana , who
had tin annoying experience with state
quarantine regulations during the yel
low fever outbreak , has Introduced a 1)111 )
In the senate for placing quarantine reg
ulations exclusively In the hands of the
federal authorities. President McKinley
deemed this matter of sulliclent Impor
tance to give it a place In Ills message
ami it is also referred to In the report of
the secretary of the treasury. The latter
refers with approval to the opinion of
the surgeon general of the marine hospi
tal service that
national quarantine reg
ulations should bo made paramount to
those of the states and that there should
bo legislation that will prevent Interfer
ence with national regulations by state
or local authorities. The secretary of
the treasury says that the necessity for
Interstate quarantine has been forcibly
revealed during the recent epidemic of
yellow fever In the south and ho sug
gests that the law should bo so framed
that it will bo within the province of the
secretary of the treasury promptly to es
tablish a qui.nintlne station without re
gard to the state or local quarantine at
whatever points and at any time that ho
may deem It nccr&mry for the public
safety to take such action.
It Is saltl that the yellow fever visita
tion was more costly than a financial
panic to the people immediately af
fected by It , because of the commercial
paralysis It entailed. This was duo to
the unueccHsarily rigid state and local
quarantine regulations , which operated
gem-inlly to put a stop to trade , while at
the same time causing a vast amount of
Individual annoyance , hardship and IOHS.
Dr. Drake , the chief Burgeon of the
Southern railway , says the most unrea
sonable quarantine regulations were Im
posed. One slate quarantines against
another state and one town against an
other town. Quo or two small villages
In Alabama and Mississippi quarantined
even against the world. Travel was In
terfered with or wholly suspended ; com
merce AVIIS paralyzed throughout Ala-
liainn , SIIsslsslppI , Umlslana and Texas
and greatly hampered In all contiguous
states. The mails were stopped nnd
moro than once destroyed by local
authorities. It has been estimated that
the loss from business stagnation In New
Orleans nlono amounted to n.000,000.
Such fucta certainly seem to conclu *
uhotv tho. nccesulty fr | n. clinngo
ami a * Dr Drake says they form n tell *
Ing object lesson which must convince
the stnnnchcftt supporter of state auton
omy that the federal government should
take ontlro nnd complete control of quar
antine. Homo opposition to Jills IS 4' > bo
expected , but the sentiment Uinf" has
been developed In favor ot * a national
system oC quarantine , under the nbsoluto
control of the government , Is so strong
and nowhere stronger than In the south ,
where opposition would ordinarily bo
looked for thnt It appears safe to say
that the proposal to place In control of
the federal authorities all quarantine
regulations against certain diseases will
be adopted by congress.

The Carter bill providing for the
twelfth census , which will bo tiikon In
1000lll come up for consideration in
the senate this week. It Is expected
that there will be a very sharp contest
over the question whether the merit sys-
iem shall bo applied In nuking appoint
ments' for coustit work or the large army
of employes In this service shall bo se
lected by senators mid representative"- "
In other words , whether the census bu
reau In 1SKX ) shall be given over to the
spoilsmen or subjected to civil service
regulations , as are other branches of tlie
public son-Ice. The Carter bill contem-
pinion the former condition and the
friends of civil service reform In congress -
gross will undoubtedly make a very
earnest effort to amend the measure lu
this particular.
The lice has already expressed the
opinion that the merit system should be
applied In the appointment of clerks for
census work and it is pleasing to find
this view supported by so competent an
authority as Mr. Robert I * . Porter , who
was superintendent of tlie clovenui cen
sus. In an article In the current number
of the North American Review Mr. Porter
ter points out the faults of the present
census system , which lie thus enumer
ates : Inadequate time for preparation :
a hard and fast law rushed through the
day before the adjournment of congress ,
calling for innumerable statistical in
vestigations and inquiries , many of
which are useless and Impracticable
and .some of which are Impossible ; sup
plemental questions for the twenty mil
lion or moro schedules , called for by con
gress ninety days prior to the actual
enumeration ; placing upon the shoulders
of the superintendent , whose mind
should bo fully occupied with his experts
In planning the work , the responsibility
of the appointment of an otllce force of
several thousand clerks. Mr. Porter
says that congress can lemedy these de
fects by making the census n permanent
olllce of the government and applying to
it precisely the same rules and regula
tions as to the employment of clerical
help as are in vogue In other depart
ments. There is no doubt as to tlie
soundness of these suggestions. They
iiro In harmony with the opinion of tlie
iblest statisticians in the country. "It
will be better iu my opinion , " says Mr.
Porter , "to draw the clerks for the
twelfth census from the classified serv
ice , but chiefly because by so doing It
will strengthen the faith of the public
in tlie census. "
It is not to be expected that this testi
mony of experience will have any
ueight with the spoilsmen in congress ,
but it ought to have Influence with the
friends of civil service reform and stim
ulate them to make a determined effort
to prevent control by the spoilsmen of
clerical appointments for tlie nest de
cennial census. Unless this Is done there
may bo dlfllculty In securing an entirely
capable man 10 superintend the work.
TllK X.IT10RA1' II0.1HI ) OF TRADE.
This body , which Is presumed to be
representative of the commercial inter
ests of the United States , will meet in
annual session this week. It is a body
which ought to exert a great deal of In
fluence , being composed of practical bus
iness men , and if It has not been notably
influential upon public sentiment it is
due to the fact it has not generally given
that careful attention to strictly bus
iness problems which Is expected of it
and has given too much consideration to
matters supported mainly by Impracti
cable theorists or persons in pursuit of
purely selfish Interests. The subjects
which such a body may properly con
sider are neither very numerous nor dllli-
cult to be defined. Its function Is to
consider what may IM done by legisla
tion to promote commerce , foster indus
tries , secure financial stability and de
velop the material resources of tlie coun
try. It may properly concern itself with
the question of building up a merchant
marine , with railway regulation , with a
uniform bankruptcy law , with expansion
of tlie export trade , with commercial
reciprocity and such other matters as
have a distinct relation to business
affairs. If it shall do this the delibera
tions and suggestions of the National
Hoard of Trade will command ( Attention
and carry weight.
We quito agree with the New York
Journal of Commerce , that If this body
Is to speak on these and kindred
topics with all the authority which
belongs to such an organization it
must avoid the advocacy of hchemes
justified neither by public neces
sity nor by the general senti
ment of business men. Among thc.se Is
the proposed creation of a department
of commerce nnd manufactures , wlthka
cabinet olllcor at the head of It and vari
ous existing bureaus of the Treasury
nnd other departments as Its component
purls. There is no real necessity for any
such department , because then ) is noth
ing which could 1m done under It that
cannot bo as well done by the agencies
now employed. The erection of a new
department would Inevitably Increase
the expenses of the government without
producing compensating results. An
other matter which the National Koiml
of Trade may wisely let alone Is the pro.
l > osed creation of a permanent tariff
commission. We nro aware of the fact
that this proposition has a great many
supporters among business men , upon
llio theory that a permanent commission
would have a tendency to take the tariff
question out of politics , but thl is no
obvloiihly a delusion that no argument
Is needed to point ; It out. Not only Is It
absolutely certain that the tnilff ques
tion will 'always bo made an Issue be
tween parties but It is equally well us-
mired th.it cyiau'esji will JievCf mirnm-
Oer to n coylf ssloii Us t'oiiitllutloiml

The proposed eoinmlnslon would bo nn

Secretary w1T3J > n is not less deserving
of credit beftrRJtt'he Js'iiot the first to eo
that whatever Is done for the uplifting
of the American farm homo must con
cern the whole family and not merely a.
part ; In other words , that the rural
housekeeper Is nn essential part of the
rural home mid household economy n
science almost equal In Importance to
the broader science of husbandry. Ills
commendation of the effort to Introduce
Into schools for girls , and women Home
systematic teaching t > f the arts which
are practiced In the home Is sincere and
thorough and It will be seconded by
everyone familiar with the subject.
If Secretary Wilson dews nothing more
than arouse the public to deeper Interest
In that which Is actually being done In
the agricultural colleges and special
schools for the science of household
economy , that chnpter.oC his report re
lating to the farmer's home will not have
been .written In vain ; Much Is being
done for the. boys who re to be the
farmers of the future and of this the
public Is fairly familiar. Hoys are being
taught what to do and how to do It , anil
more than that , they are learning the
principles upon which the science of ag
riculture nml lui bandry are based , BO
that while doing the right tilings they
will go on studying the book of nature
and adding to the general stock of knowl-
edge. Now in much the same manner
the work of educating girls lias been
taken up In the agricultural and mechan
ical schools of the country , ami teaching
tlie nrts of the , homo is accompanied by
Instruction In the sciences relating
thereto. "The teachers of domestic
science , " says Secretary Wilson In Ills
report , "are not content 'to. ' follow a dull
routine of household drudgery in thch
teaching. They are appealing to the
scientist and specialist In lines whlcl
touch the home life to explain the prin
clples on which" homo' , practices shouh
rest and to show them how Intelligent
taste and sUill can inake the homo a

Among the problems of today which sim
ply shriek for settlement Is whether tin.
promlso to "obey" shall bo rooted from the
marriage service. Matters have gene so far
that at the request ot the brides the words
arc frequently omitted by overawed clergy
men , and the omission is not by any means
a careless gratuity to feminine whims. The
modern woman means business.
Science Is not Just yet ready to fully lllu
initiate this problem. Ono French thinker has
decided that the American woman Is the su
perlor typo of the race and the most flnlshui
work of the country's civilization. She has
become better than the men by the leisure
they have created for her and the use she
makes of It. Her Intelligence develops am
extends while theirs Is specialized nnd con
centrated. They are the workers nnd she
the leader.
On the other hand , the strict Investigators
are disposed to assert that the male organl
zatlon Is essentially superior , moro complex
and moro capable. Some of them have sal <
that the roaecn n man was born n boy am
not a girl Is that the conditions of pre-ova
potency caused a higher development.
Thus the question of rightful claim to in
tellcctual a.nd moral mastery , when It leave
the old references to the history ot grca
men and women and the advances Into th
