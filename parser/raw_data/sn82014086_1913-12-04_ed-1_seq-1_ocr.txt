From Seven Federal Generals Villa Declares They
Would Expect No Clemency Huerta Still Obdurate.
Juar.. :U.i.:o. Dec. 3. A new era
began in northern Mexico today.. It
marked the peace l'nl occupation by the
rebels of the territory abandoned by
llwru's federal troops.
With 2,000 rebels. General Ftancis-c.-
YilU, enroute from Juarez to the
n-ncjMiwd city of Chihuahua, passed
Through Alwiiiiada. miles south of
the border, mid camped w .Montezuma,
thirty miles further south. Five thou
sand' more rebels will .loin him on the
wav and with a combined force of 7.000
men he will enter the state capital,
tltere to establish what will be the
-lemnora-rv miUtary headuaxters of the
constitutionalist partK.
Garrison of 1,700 at Juarez.
The departure of the rebel forces
from Juarez with their equipment was
i,-,aae on four trains, a garrison of
;,7i"i coldier having been left behind
x'.i fruard the border town. As far as
:imuda Villa has restored the tele
graph. The railroad runs to Monte
zuma .where it is interrupted by burn
d bridges. It i to be reconstructed
Tithin a few days.
Whether General Carranza, Che reo
orniaed head of the revolution, also
win go to Chihuahua, seemed to be in
doubt, although Villa said he expected
arranza's forovs to cross from Son
era to concentrate the men for cper
fctiom further south.

not wait to receive, tna.kes possible
the rebel occupation of the city without
a light. The fact that Mercado sent
commission to Villa through Fred

trim was regarded by the rebel leader
as a mask to enable Mercado to. get
way.
No Word from Federal Generals.
&o far the rebels and federals have
h.d i'o parleys of any character, and
Villa paid he thought, lluerta's officers
would not evpeel clemency from him.
"o word was received today from the

Hope of Reducing Cost of Living in

Argentina imposes a dutv on semo

both the president and congress of that

repeal of this provision of their tariff
law. such action has not been taken.

U. S. Soldiers Instructed to Arrest
Mexican Federal Officers.

Ojlnaga on the border a squadron of
the Fifteenth United States cavalry

thorities were instructed to arrest any
Mexican federal officers who might at
tempt to cross the border.

colonels, who had been held -at Port
Bliss for violation of the neutrality
law, were released.
HUERTA UNYIELDING,
Will Do His Part as Long as the
Fighting Continues.
Mexico City, Dec. 3. The enuncia
tion Tif Washington's policy appears
not to alarm President Huerta, espe
cially since he long ago abandoned
hope of anything but opposition from
the United Statea. He said today:
"I have no intention of yielding.
Should this lighting in Mexico con
tinue for years I shall continue to do
my part in it if I am still alive."
General Huerta declared that the
country was self-supporting and that
forced loans, if made necessary, would
enable him to resist indefinitely. So
long as he was able to obtain Amer
ican oil he did not 1-egaxd the shut
ting off of native oil from the rail
ways as vital.
CONFIDENCE- AT WASHINGTON.
Government Officials Believe Patience
Is to. Be Rewarded,
Washington, Dec. S. Government of
ficials here were more than ever con
fident today that the infinite patience
which the United Statea has shown
in its treatment of the Mexican prob
lem is soon to be rewarded by a solu
tion brought about by operation of the
great internal forces now engaged in
a final struggle in Mexico. Such a
conclusion has been the one principal
object of the American administra
tion. There was no change recorded today
in the disposition of American mili
tary or naval forces in Mexican wa
ters. The navy department announced that
the 700 marines which arrived at Pen
sacola, Fla., yesterday on the Prairia
had been kept aboard ship because
there was not sufficient quarters
ashore at present for all of them. The
plan is to keep some of the men per
manently aboard ship.

.strong detachment of infantry and a
large quantity ort' ammunition and sup

Dallas, Texas, Dec. 3. With three
out of their banks as a result of tor
rado and innumerable small streams
rivers the Trinity, Brazos and Colo
rential rains -which began Monday
night and still continue, the flood sit
uation in central Texas has assumed
serious proportions.
Within a territory 200 miles in length
and 100 miles in width almost all of
the lowlands are under water; approx
imately 16,000 persons have been driv
en from their homes; scores have
been rescued from tree tops and float
ing wreckage; several railroads have
been forced to suspend operations, and
muoh damage has-been done to prop
erty. Seven Lives Lost.
Seven persons are known to have
lost their lives. Yesterday five mem
bers of the family of W. C. Polk, a
farmer, were drowned at Belton, and B.
F. Lacy and a man named Manley -met
the same fate near Dallas late today.
Manley lost his life while attempting
to rescue marooned victims at the vil
lage of Grand Prairie.
10,000 Homeless at Waco.
Waco, on the Brazos river and in the
center of the flooded area, reported the
most serious situation today. Sec
tions of that city known as South and
East Waco are under water, and it is
estimated that more than 10,000 resi
dents were made homeless. In Waco
property damage is estimated in ex
cess of $"5,000. The military compan
ies stationed there have been ordered
on duty by Goversor Colquitt, and ball
cartridg-es have been issued to the
guardsmen for use in the event of loot
ing. So far there has been no disor
der. Train service out of Waco was de
moralized by washouts. Officials of the
Texas Midland, operating- between En
nis and Paris, reported the entire sys
tem tied up. Near Elgin the soft road
bed caused the engine and baggage car
of a Houston and Texas Central pas
senger train to overturn. No one was
seriously hurt.
People Marooned in Trees.
In the Leon river bottoms, near Tem
ple, a ninnbp of men. women and
children, stil were marooned late to
day, after spending 24 hours in the
trees, and tonight it was uncertain
when improvised boats could be navi
gated through the swift flowing water.
Near Dallas this afternoon boatmen
rescued a dozen persons from trees in
tlie Trinity rivr bottoms, and earlier
in the day boats took refugees from
trees near Waxahachie and at other
points.-
Marlin, the training- site of several
major lea.guc baseball teams, is prac
tically surrounded by water, and the
town of Hetty, on the Texas Midland
railroad, is inundated to a depth of
from one to three feet, most of the in
habitants having moved to Terrell with
such of their effects as they could hur
riedly gather.
Three Men Afloat on Log.
In Waco and other large towns in
the flooded districts charitable organ
izations are caring- for those made
homeless, while in the smaller vil
lages more fortunate neighbors are pro
viding shelter for those driven from
their homes. As a result, except in
isolated cases there has been but little
suffering from hunger and exposure.
The Colorado river at Austin, after
falling during- last night, rose again to
day, coming up at the rate of six feet
an hour for a time tonight. Three uni
dentified men, riding on a log, floated
down the river at dusk, one getting
into a tree far out from shore and the
other two on top of the partially sub
merged grandstand of the baseball
park. Boats were sent out to rescue
the men, but were unable to find them
in the darkness.
FALL RIVER UNIONS
VOTE AGAINST STRIKE.
Leaders Declare There is Opposition to
Strike in Winter.
Fall River, Mass.. Dec. 3. Union
texU-J.- operatives voted tonight against
calling a general strike in the cotton
mil's to enforce their demands for an
increase in wages of 12 1-Z per cent.
Five union organisations held special
meetings. Four declared against in
sistence on the demands, while the
fifth, the weavers, among whom the
agitation for an increase started, vot
ed 436 to 361 in favor of striking. As
the rules of the Weavers' union require
a two-'thirds vote on a strike, the vote
was without effect.
The unions demanded that the wage
increa.se be granted by December 8.
claiming that recent dividends by two
milLs indicated that the manufacturers
could afford tile raise. The Manufac
turers' association rejected the de
mand. Union leaders said that tonight's act
ion indicated principally the opposition
of the workers to going through a
winter strike.
SPENCER INSISTS
ON HAVING EGGS.
Murderer Upbraids Sheriff for Denying
Him That Luxury.
Chicago, Dec. 3. Henry Spencer,
sentenced to be hanged December 19
for the murder of Mrs. Mildred Allison
Rexroat, today expressed two desires
one that his body be cremated and the
ashes scattered in front of the court
house where he was tried; the other
for eggs.
Owing to the high price of the latter
Sheriff Kuhn has eliminated them
from the cuisine of the jail at Whea
ton, where Spencer is confined. Spen
cer upbraided the sheriff for limiting
the diet of a man who "has only 1
days left to eat In."
Dressmaker Murdered in Bed.
New York. Dec. 3. Mrs. Agnes Guth,
who as Madam Guth ran a West Side
dressmaking establishment, was mur
dered as she lay in bed at her home
tonight. She had been stabbed twice
In the back and once in the chest.
According to -the police, a man with
whom she had lived for the past year,
and whom she had introduced as her

Eight Separate
Investigations
BOSTON'S HOLOCAUST IS TO BE
WELL PROBED
GRAND JURY ON SCENE
Visit Cheap Lodging House in Which
28 Inmates Perished Owner De
clares That the Fire Was Set.
Boston, Dec. 3 The fire which snuff
ed out the lives of twenty-eight home
less men in the Arcadia Hotel, a low
priced lodging house in the South End
district early today had become the
subject of eight separate investiga
tions by nightfall. Some of these were
aimed at determining where lay re
sponsibility for the conditions which
made the loss of life so large, and
others were directed toward devising
measures to protect hundreds of other
men forced by circumstances to seek
shelter in similar places.
Grand Jury Visits Scene.
Most important of the day's inquir
ies was that begun by the Suffolk
County grand jury. Directed by Dis
trict Attorney Joseph C. Pelletier, the
jurymen paid a visit to the hotel while
the ruins were still smouldering.!
Thejr saw the remains of cots laid
side by side in a general dormitory on
the fifth floor and narrow, box-like
rooms on floors below in which privacy
was obtained by inmates for a few
cents more than was paid by the dor
mitory occupants.
The cause of the fire was not de
termined. Most Deaths Due to Suffocation.
A large quantity of painters 'mater
ials, District Attorney Pelletier said,
was found in a closet on the second,
floor but, apparently it had not been
touched by the flames. Later the
jury went to the city hospital morgue,
where' Medical Examner Timothy J.
Leary pointed out that in nearly every
instance death had been caused by
suffocation although in two or three
cases, it was evident that fire ended
the lives. Other lodging houses in the
vicinity were afterwards inspected by
the jury in order to see how those
houses were conducted in reference to
the safety of the occupants at night.
Fourth Mysterious Fire There.
Other investigations were the offleial
inquest by Medical Examiner Leary;
inquiries by the fire commissioners;
the building commision and the board
of health; the city police department;
the state police: and personal re
search by Mayor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Lyons of Brookline, president
of the firm which operated the Arcad
ia as part of a chain of lodging houses
in Boston, New York, Brooklyn, New
ark, and Jersey City, believes that the
fire started under the stairs in the
main hallway. Within a few months
three other mysterious fires have been
discovered there, he said,
"This fire was undoubtedly set," he
added.
Total Finances of Victims. $1.47.
None of the men found burned to
death had been identified tonight.
Of the injured taken to the city hospi
tal, William Sullivan and George F.
Adams, died during the day.
Search of the dead developed little
to assist in identification. It revealed
the financial circumstances of the men
when only $1.47 was gathered from the
effects of all the victims.
Homeless Men Roam Streets.
Several hundred human derelicts
roamed the streets tonight without a
place to lay their heads. Mayor Fitz
gerald ordered limits placed on the
number of guests to be accommodated
in each of the lodging houses and
many were left without a place to go.
It was estimated tonight that more
than five thousand men in poor cir
cumstances resorted to these low price
lodging houses for sleep each night.
MANN FEARS THAT
IT PORTENDS WAR.
Republican Leader Discusses Army
Volunteer Bill.
Washington, Dec. 3 After a discus
sion into which Republican Leader
Mann injected the Mexican situation,
the house today passed the Hay Army
Volunteer bill that in varying forms
has been talked of at the capitol for
many years.
The bill, which now goes to the sen
ate, wuld put war volunteer forces, on
an equal footing with the regular army.
It would provide that whenever in the
president's judgment war is imminent
or actually exists, the president may
organize volunteer regiments for war
purposes. The men, instead of enlist
ing for a short period as in past wars,
would enlist "for the war." The pres
ident would appoint all the officers not
more than four regular officers to be
appointed to any one volunteer regi
ment. The volunteer force thus formed
would supplement the existing na
tional guard of militia, with which the
bill would not interfere.
Representative Mann's remarks on
the Mexican situation featured the de
bate. Declaring that of course Chair
man Hay of the military committee,
the administration and all others con
nected with the bill would vigorously
deny that the measure was presented
now because the government was pre
paring for a war with Mexico, he re
called that just before the Spanish
American war the appropriations com
mittee presented a bill to put $50,
000,000 in President McKinley's hands.
"I took a minute then to say," added
Mir. Mann, "that at least there was one
man in the house who was not at
tempting to deceive himself while all
the others had said that this was not
in expectation of war, but to prevent
war. I fear that the same situation
arises now.
"I should greatly regret war with
Mexico," he continued. "I have no
complaint to make of the president's
attitude in his dealings with Mexico,
although I confess I can see no end
to the road which he is now pursuing.
He said yesterday that the Huerta
government in Mexico would fall soon.
Very likely. I think any government
in Mexico which does not receive the
moral support of our government will
not last a great length of time and I
doubt whether any government in
Mexico constituted by the so-called
constitutionalists or the other revolu
tionists will last with or without the
support of our government."

mit Dr. Knabe to address the alu
dents. He said that Dr. Roberts had
readily agreed to giv way to Dr.
Knabe. .
"When I put the question to Dit.
