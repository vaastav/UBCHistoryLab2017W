There are many pleasing color

For Grandma, there is a love­
ly lavender robe, which will
prove most becoming to her
white hair.
Grandfather would like some­
thing darker—a deep blue com­

an Indian design, or a service­
able gray.
They are only $5.50, and this includes two frogs and two cords
for trimming.

Children's Bath Robes
For the younger men of the family plaids and the Indian
patterns are very good, and the conventional and floral designs
will appeal to Auntie or Sister.
The boys will like the Indian patterns, with a gay red cord
at neck and waist and two frogs to match.
But the girls will prefer a pretty plain pink, bound with satin,
or a handsome Persian design in brown and tan.
And the tinies will crow with glee at the bunnies
and bears, or the boy and his dog, dancing in every
direction over the little robe.

Mamma will appreciate it, too—she knows how comfy they are

LICHTEN DENIED
CITIZENSHIP BY
FEDERAL COURT
Turned Down Coldly For Voting
For Soviet Resolution at
New Ulfli Convention.
In the campaign to prevent unde­
sirable persons of foreign birth from
becoming citizens of the United
States, Joel Lichten, secretary of the
local Painters' union, and one of the
least offensive men we have- ever
known, is the first victim. He was
denied citizenship in Judge Morris'
court last Friday morning after ad­
mitting that he had voted in favor
of the resolution of sympathy for
Soviet Russia at the New Ulm con­
vention of the Minnesola State
Federation of Labor.
Beyond the trade union movebent
Mr. Lichten and The Labor World
have little in common. We widely
differ with him on many subjects
Perhaps if we had suffered under
the yoke of oppression as he has
done we would entertain his views
on political and industrial questions,
and we doubt if we would be as mild,
patient and considerate as he is. In
speech he is without passion or ma­
levolence. In manner he is gentle
and kind. In thought he is tolerant
and considerate. These are not usual
characteristics of dangerous enemiea
to our country or its institutions. It
would have been better had the fed­
eral authorities chosen a more glar­
ing subject for the denial of citizen­
ship.
Loyal During War.
During the war, Mr. Lichten loy­
ally supported the United States. He
introduced a motion in his local
union for the purchase of $500 worth
of Liberty bonds. He also presented
a resolution directing the treasurer
to buy quantities of War Savings cer­
tificates and Thrift stamps to be sold
to the members. He personally pur­
chased Liberty bonds of every issue
and still possesses them. He regis­
tered under the draft and did not
claim exemption as an alien, but
asked only for such classification as
was given to marri'ed men. He sup­
ported President Wilson and was
zealous in his defense of America's
stand in the war as defined in the
fourteen points. Throughout the
war he was loyal, not disloyal. He
made no boast of patriotism, but he
nendered patriotic service to the
country. Classed as a radical be­
cause of his views on political and
economic questions, but usually con­
servative in action and always prac­
tical his only crime is that he has
zealously labored to improve the
condition of his fellow workers and
all the people.
Exiled From Russia.
Joel Lichten was born in
Zdunskawola, Poland in Russia on
July 3, 1886. As a youngster he be­
came affiliated with the Polish
Socialist party, the dominating demo­
cratic political organization in Poland,
which was foremost in the fight for
the political independence of that
country. Because of his activity in
behalf of political independence, the
Czar's government had him posted,
and to avoid exile to Siberia, he
escaped from the country into Den­
mark and from there to Sweden.
In Sweden Mr. Lichten identified
himself with the trades union move­
ment and took an active part in its
operations. He worked as a painter
and traveled considerably over Eu­
rope, where he learned to speak six
different languages. In January,
1914, he came to the United States
and settled in Duluth. Having a
transfer card from the Painters union
of Stockholm, he became a member
of the Painters' union of Duluth, in
which organization he has since taken
an active part, serving it as secretary,
as delegate to the Federated Trades
Assembly of Duluth, and to conven­
tions of the Minnesota State Federa­
tion of Labor. He also became a mem­
ber of the Socialist party in America,
but withdrew therefrom when the so
called left wing came into control.
SATURDAY- •THE LABOR WORLD -DECEMBER 6,1919.
Declared His Intention.
Mr. Lichten declared his intention
to become a citizen of the United
States in June, 1916, and made final
application for fun citizenship In
April, 1919. Since his arrival in the
United States he has been a law abid­
ing citizen. He is not a member of
the I. W. W., or any other political,
industrial or social organization com­
mitted to the overthrow of the United
States government. He at all times
has strongly advocated changes in
government by evolutionary processes
through political action and Jie has
opposed revolutionary changed, and
particularly by so-called direct action.
He has made it a point to identify
himself only with" law abiding and
lawful organizations of men and
women.
The Soviet Resolution.
At the convention of tne Minnesota
State Federation of Labor, held at
New Ulm in July, a resolution having
reference to the Russian situation
was introduced and acted upon at
the second day's session. This resolu
tion read as follows:
"Resolved, that the Minnesota State
Federation of Labor hereby express
its sympathy with the Soviet Russia,
denounce the Allied efforts at subjec­
tion and their erection and support
of the Mannerheim and Kolchalc gov
ernments and the worldwide campaign
of lying propaganda directed at the
Russian Soviet government, and de
mand immediate withdrawal from all
Russian territory of Allied troops, the
cessation of support to the Manner
I heim and the Kolchak and other re
actionary government."
The committee on resolutions, to
which the Russian Soviet resolution
was referred, recommended the fol­
lowing substitute for the original
resolution:
"Resolved, that this ^convention
favors the recognition of a truly
I democratic form of government in

Defined Sovictisxn.
Mr. Lichten voted in favor of, and
talked in favor of the original resolu­
tion, in which he made no reference
to Bolshevism or extended any sym­
pathy to the Bolsheviki, but in which
he defended the principal of Soviet
ism in Russia as he understood it. He
declared that the Soviet system of
government was peculiarly Russian
and had existed from the time of
Peter the Great. About the only
change between the gyesent Soviet
government and the Old Soviet he
held, was in the fact that the fran­
chise was now limited to those per­
forming useful and necessary labor
to society.
Now, when Mr. Lichten's applica­
tion for citizenship was up for con­
sideration, he was questioned by R.
K. Doe, representing the U. S. Depart­
ment of Labor. Mr. Lichten's wit­
nesses were John E. Jensen, a fellow
painter and president of the Federated
Trades Assembly of Duluth, and W.
E. Towne, president of the Allied
Printing Trades Council. Mr. Jensen
is known as a conservative among
labor men and the people of Duluth
generally, and Mr. Towne is classed
as a radical. When Mr. Lichten ap­
peared before Mr. Doe he was ques­
tioned substantially as follows:
Put on tbe "Pan*'
Q. Are you a Socialist?
A. Yes, by conviction.
Q. Did you vote for the Bolshevist
resolution at the State Federation of
Labor Convention, held at New Ulm,
July, 1919?
A. Not for the Bolshevist resolu­
tion, but for the resolution requesting
the withdrawal of troops from Rus­
sia and expressing isympathy with
Soviet Russia.
Q. Did you attend the Mooney
convention held at Chicago, 111., Jan­
uary 14-18, 1919?
A. Yes, I attended as a duly
elected delegate from the Federated
Trades Assembly of Duluth.
strike resolution?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Did you recommend the en­
dorsement of the resolution to the
Federated Trades Assembly upon your
return from the convention?
A. In my report to the Federated
Trades Assembly I gave a full account
of what transpired at the convention.
There were no recommendations in
the report.
Q. Did you make a speech at the
Court House Square on Labor Day,
in which you stated that we should
not have gone to Europe to fight for
democracy when we have not democ­
racy at home?
A. No, I did not. I only referred
to, or I quoted President Wilson's
message to Congress, in which he said
that it was important to have more
democracy in industry.
Is Not an I. W. W.
Q. Are you an I. W. W.
A. No. I never was.
Q. Do you approve of the actions
of the I. W. W.?
A. No, I have never approved of
their actions.
Q. Do you approve or Sabotage?
A. No, I have always opposed
Sabotage.
On the morning of Friday, NoveiA
•ber 28, Mr. Lichten appeared with his
witnesses before- Hon. Page Morris,
judge of the United States District
Court at the Federal Building, Du­
luth, Minn., and the proceedings in
his case were as follows:

MOUNDSVILLE, W. Va., Dec. 4.—
Nearly 200 miners voted to return to
work at the mines of the Mineral
State Coal company and when their
committee called at the office to notify
the management to this affect gun
men ordered them off the premises.
The coal owners told the miners
they would not meet them, and min­
ers living in. company houses are be­
ing urged to sign individual contracts
in which they agree not to join the
miners* union while in the company's
employ.
This contract is similar to the one
used by the Mitchman Coal and Coke
company, this state, which was up­
held by the United States supreme
court in 1917. The court sustained an
injunction by Federal Judge Dayton
who restrained union organizers fro
inducing men who signed this con­
tract to join the union Judge Dayton
held, in effect, that when a man,
through necessity, surrenders an
American right, this action will be
upheld on the theory of "sacredness of
contract."
The situation in this city has been
called to the attention of Attorney
General Palmer who is informed of
the Mineral State Coal company's in­
terference with the production of coal.
As yet no federal injunction has been
issued against the company.
to have spoken in its favor. Judge
Morris turned to the applicant and
asked, "Did you Mr. Lichten at­
tempted to reply and got as far as
"Yes, but—" when he was interrupted
by Judge Morris, who said, "Do not
appear any more in this court while
I am here. You better go back to
Russia. It will be better lor both you
and the United States."
Denied a fair chance in court, Mr.
Lichten takes this opportunity of de­
fining his position in the following
language:
Lichten Defines Position.
"I was born under the yoke of op­
pression. I was exiled from my na­
tive land, where I engaged in the
fight for freedom. I came to the
United States, because it was taught
to me from the cradle that here men
were free. I was not in the country
very long "before discovered that
the working people, although politic­
ally free, were dominated by the same
kind of masters that rule the work­
ers of the old world. I found here
the working men and women organ­
ized in trades unions to better their
conditions. I immediately affiliated
with the trades union of my trade
and I have worked always in a law-,
ful manner and always law abiding
to make the conditions of my fellows
better than they are.
"Since my arrival here I have stud­
ied the American plan of progress.
I first learned that the tactics of the
American laborer must be different
than those of the laborers in Rus­
sia for the reason that laborers here
were politically froee and they had
it within their power to better their
conditions and to improve their gov­
ernment by the proper exercise of the
rights enjoyed by them under the
Constitution of the United States. In
Russia the workers could not use tne
tactics of the American workers, be­
cause they were not politically free,
and hence, were prohibited by the law
of the land and by governmental ty­
ranny from making progress, except
by fighting for it in such ways as
appeared to them expedient.
In America it Is Different.
"What would be perfectly proper in
Russia under political tyranny, would
be decidedly improper and unlawful
in democratic America. I have taken
an active part, although not a citi­
zen, in political affairs in the United
States since my arrival here. I have
learned that by economic weii-oemg
depends largely upon the political
aspect, so I have largely centered my
activities as a man on the side of
politics. I was a member of the So
ciolist party when I was new to the
country. When I saw that party
clinging to the old world methods, 1
Q. Did you vote for the general left it, and became an independent
While I could not vote, I used such
influence as I possessed in the elec­
tion of men to public office, whom
thought were forward-looking and
had some real sympathy for the work­
ers. I was particularly active in the
election of W. L. Carss, the union
labor, candidate for congress, and in
the election of William F. Murnian
as city commissioner. I have taken
part in school board elections, and I
have longed and hoped for the day
when I could be made a. full fledged
citizen of this country so that I could
enjoy the rights of franchise therein.
Stands For the U. S. A.
"I am opposed to the overthrow of
the United States government, al­
though I favor many changes and
the passage of many laws that will
protect men in their rights and that
will give to workers a greater meas­
ure of industrial freedom.
"I am opposed to violence, to direct
action, to sabotage, or to the use of
any unlawful method in improving the
conditions or securing the rights of
labor. I would be opposed to Soviet
ism in the United States as I would
favor It in Russia. I am opposed to
the dictatorship in any form and I
made my application to be a citizen
of the United States, because I wa3
opposed to dictatorship, and in order
to become a part of a country found­
ed upon a principle of democracy.
"Had I been permitted, I would
have so informed Judge Morris, but
he cut me off abruptly and dismissed
my case on the mere say so of the
local naturalization official of the De­
partment of Labor. I maintain that I
am entitled to citizenship and I am
not guilty of any thought or offense
against this country of its laws/'
