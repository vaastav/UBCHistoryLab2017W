Among the exhibits offered by the
State in the trial of William F. Bickel,
late cashier of the lat<> .Minnesota Say-
i 1 1 14 s hank, jvas a promissory note
signed by William Bickel, dated July
21, LS96, to the Minnesota Savings
for $1,250, due in ninety days, on
which there was a payment indorsed
.>:" $1,000 Aug. 20, 189t>. The note was
what Is known as a collateral note.
containing the usual recital that there
■en deposited with the note as
security "Note $1,000, M. I). K."
"M. 1). K." are the initials of .Moses
Kenyon, then and for several years
and now bank examiner of the state
of Minnesota, charged by the law of
this state with the duty of investigat
ing the condition of all banks, ex
amining their securities to see if they
olvent, and to see that the officers
of the bank are not playing ducks-and
a with the money of the deposi
tors. As such officer, finding had con
ditions of management, it is his duty
and he has the power to either compel
an immediate rectification or a receiv
ership. No where that we can find is
there giver him any margin of discre
tion. William Bickel, we need hardly
say, was at that time vice president
<■:" the Allemannia bank, which subse
quently assigned, and he went to that
bank from the Germania, which he
had successfully steered into condi
tions that compelled an assignment
after he transferred his financing abil
ities to the Allemannia. In all these
banks, and in whatever others he
could get access, he was a very gener
ous and Industrious borrower, with a
fine contempt for collaterals. He Is
now, we understand, doing a banking
business in California, with three
gdlden I>a 11k for his office sign.
It thus appears that William Bickel,
r. chronic borrower, held a note of M.
I). Kenyon, bank examiner of the state
of Minnesota, for $1,000, which he put
up as collateral to his own note for
$1. -•:>'• to the savings bank over which
his son, well, we will say. presided, and
of which the father was a trustee. To
whom ih«' "M. D. K." note was pay
able does not appeal-; hardly to Bickel
senior; probably to some bank with
which he was or had been connected.
Wini >n it was made is also unknown,
but it is evident that it was paid to
or the equivalent of payment was re
ceived by the savings bank Aug. 20,
1896. That is undoubtedly what the
indorsement of "paid on the within,
$1,000" means.
The Minnesota Savings bank, in
which M. D. X.'s note for $1,000 had
been hypothecated. by the senior Bickel,
closed its doors on it? numerous de
posit ors or, Jan. ]S. 1897. at the expira
tion of the sixty days' notice it had
previ iusly given its alarmed depositors
when they demanded their money. The
legislature was then in session, and it
appointed a committee of senators and
representatives to find out, if they
c on 1 ,|. how it came about that the ex
aminations of the bank examiner did
not examine; how it was possible that
banks could get where they
couldn't pay their depositors more
th:iM .i few cents on the dollar while
the state had an officer and assistants
•tect the beginnings of misconduct
and stop it. Among the evidence pro
cure.; |>y that committee is a report
made to the bank examiner, Kenyon,
by 1. •••!■■■;!■.-!]. his assistant, of his ex
aniin.iiion into the condition of the
Minnesota Savings bank.
This rep trt bears date Oct. 7, ISOS.
It '■• rfcldse'S herewith schedules and
statements as to the true condition of
this Sank." It closed with the state
inert thai "it all depends on the value
• real estate and loans if the. as
sets ate sufficient to pay the depositors
in- lull and it is impossible to give any
t valuation of the same." As
note was that of John F. Baker
and A. S. Kittson for $22,410 and an
other was Hazel Bickel's for $I^Bo6,
Mr. Lonegren was justified in declining
to attempt to give any "correct valua
tion" of the assets.
But, and this is the kernel in this
nut, although this report was made to
Bank Examiner Kenyon on Oct. 7,
1 395, he did not file it with the governor
until Feb. 6, 1897, three weeks after the
savings bank had gone up. Then and
! not before did he transmit the exami
: nation made by Lonegren fourteen
i months before to the governor. Dur
; ing all this time, and during the time
when M. D. X.'s note for $1,000 was in
that bank, he suppressed the report of
| his assistant, which informed him that
i the collaterals of the bank were so
; doubtful that he could not give any
; estimate of their value. Kenyon made
i no further examination of its condi
■ tii.n from that date until the failure.
j During all th*se months he permitted
bard-working men and women, clerks,
seamstresses, small dealers, to continue
putting their savings into this sink
hole, while his assistant's report
showed him that its condition demand
ed instant attention. This neglect
would have been culpable enough in
aml*uf itself; what does it become
w hen the fact appears that M. D. K. was
apparently a debtor of William Bickel
senior, one of the trustees of this bank,
to the extent of $1,000, and a debtor of
this bank to the same extent by virtue
of its holding that note as collateral?
The circumstances seem to call for a
more explicit explanation from Mr.
Kenyon than he gave the legislative
committee for not filing Lonegren's re
port.
WAITIXC I'OK THE BOSS.
Tin- people of St. Paul ought to ap
point a special day uf prayer and
thanksgiving to celebrate their escape
fit. in the misfortunes and punishin. Nts
that might have fallen upon them had
not the committee on streets of the
board of aldermen wisely determined
to await the return of .Mr. Thomas
Lowry from the East before acting on
the street railway ordinance that has
passed the assembly. We shudder to
think of what might have happened
had the representatives of the people
actually taken the hazardous step of
consulting the wishes of the people
without reference to those of the street
railway in general and Mr. Lowry in
particular. The outbursts of wrath of
the doughty young German emperor
when his will is thwarted would have
been nothing compared with the sur
prise and anger of Mr. Lowry and Mr.
Mu n n had they learned that action had
been taken on the street railway ordi
nance during his absence. It was to
the very brink cf this precipice that
the zeal of the assembly had brought
the people of St. Paul. They are thrust
back from it by the strong and saving
arms of Mr. Shepard and Mr. Sanborn
and other aldermen who have a bet
ter realization of the wrath to come.
Under the cool and politic counsel of
these gentlemen the board of alder
men decided to wait for orders. Jt as
certained the probable date of Mr.
Lowry's return and gladly determined
to risk no chances, but to wait and
accept its instructions from his own
lips. You cannot be too careful when
you are acting under the orders of a
superior. The best intention of a man
is liable to incur, in such cases, the
displeasure of bis boss, and then there
is no telling what visitation of wrath
may fall upon his innocent head. Who
knows but our street railway service
might have been cut off altogether, or
the city hall moved bodily over to the
headquarters of the Twin City Rapid
Transit company, in Minneapolis, if
our aldermen had not thus hastened
to place their votive offerings upon the
altar of an offended diety? We sug
gest the propriety once more of a
special day of thanksgiving, and that
a public collection be taken up to pro
sent to the members of the board of
aldermen some substantial testimonial
as a recognition by the people of the
services that they have rendered In
forcing their ill-regulated associates
to await the coming of Lowry, lui
perator. J

TO TAKK Oil' TIIK STARCH.
It is apparent that those who have
regarded the attack on the civil serv
ice law in congress as a mere ebulli
tion of a little knot of spoilsmen with
nobody behind them have underesti-
I mated altogether the strength and
meaning of the movement. It is true
that there is no immediate danger of
j the outright repeal of the law. It is
j equally true that there is probably a
majority in the present congress in
favor of emasculating it. There is
\ still enough wholesome dread of public
i opinion to keep most of the representa-
I tives under cover while this fight is
j going on. They do not dare come out
openly and say what Grosvenor and
his followers say. that they want to get
rid of the reform system altogether
and put the offices where they, will do
the most good for their party. They
do want to compass the same end by
indirect means, and they will do this
unless the public is watchful and in
sistent.
Their desire is that expressed by
Gov. Black, of New York state, to
"lake some of the starch out of the
civil service law." Black and Tom
Platt's legislature did that v.cry ef
fectually in that commonwealth, so
that today the reform system has been
as far wiped out in the Empire state
as its constitution will permit. Now
a similar move is made upon the re
form at Washington, although it is to
be managed more judiciously and
cloaked more effectually, because .Mr.
McKinley has placed himself squarely
on record as in favor of the reform sys
tem. We have, therefore, the propo
sition advanced that the law is to be
"modified." Dissatisfied members will
not seek Its total repeal, but they will
just make a few changes to remove
objections that will make it bear a
little less hardly upon the hungry
horde whose ravings at Washington
since the inauguration have surpassed
anything ever seen in the history, of
this country.
This reminds one Irresistibly of the
THE SAINT PAUL GLOB 3: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1897,
predictions concerning tariff legisla
tion that were current in the Republi
can press between November and
March, that we were not going to
have any restoration of McKinleyism j
or any excessive duties imposed. Such I
an Idea, we were told, was farthest
from the Republican thought. The
voters, however, had commissioned it
to make some changes in the tariff act,
and it would be obliged to give the
country a "moderate law." Th-at mod
eration took the form of the Dingley
bill, the most extraordinary, extrava
gant and prohibitive tariff ever known
to the United States. The same sort
of moderation will dictate the terms
of a civil service act, if any shall be
passed. Under the guise of correcting
inconsistencies and modifying minor
regulations, such bill will, as far as pos
sible, sweep away every protection and
every safeguard established by reform,
and once more put up the offices for
sale to the highest bidder. There should
be nothing to surprise the people in
this prospect. It is inevitable that par
ty government by the ideas which dom
inate the Republicanism of today
should be out of sympathy with re
form. It is ruled by commercialism.
Its purpose in legislation is to make
some people prosperous at the expense
of others. That is the logic of the
protective system. It would be a
freak of nature were a man who holds
this view to completely reverse him
self by saying that the party in pow
er ought not to have also the offices
and all the spoils of power.
The civil service law is in actual dan
ger. Its friends will do well not to
confide too much in what they have
considered its impregnable intrench
ment in public favor. Congress and the
Republican party, driven by appetite
and necessity, care little for that. The
greatest advance made in federal leg
islation and practice in the last half
century will be nullified if the people
do not thrust before their representa
tives the dangers and penalties which
will fall upon them if they proceed to
the work now most congenial to their
hearts, that of "taking the starch" out
of civil service reform.
-
HOW TERRIBLE OF THEM.
A special dispatch from Washington
to the Globe expresses the sorrowful
indignation of the friends of Hawaiian
annexation at the unpatriotic and sel
fish attitude of Its opponents. They
are shocked at the fact that "there
Is a big money-spending lobby here,
deliberately engaged in an effort to de
feat the annexation treaty." They tell
us, moreover, who these dreadful cor
rupt men are. Prominent among them
are the Oxnards, of Nebraska. These
gentlemen, horns, hoofs, forked tails
and all, are actually said to have gone
to the national capital to work against
an arrangement that threatens an in
terference with the operations of the
beet sugar industry, in which they
have a large capital invested. Such a
thing is actually unheard of in our
legislation, and even the apology that
they are acting under "an impulse of
self-preservation" hardly covers their
iniquity.
The pure patriots who want to force
the Hawaiian people into an alliance re
pugnant to them and incompatible with
all the traditions and interests of the
American republic are appalled at the
black impropriety of this action. If
the Oxnards and others in the same
line of business were to go down to
Washington now, as they did a year
ago and as they go to the halls of
state legislatures, to demand protection
for their industries.to ask for heavy dif
ferentials on imported sugar and to pro
pose modest bounties equal to the en
tire cost of production for the domestic
product, that is an entirely proper pro
ceeding. That, also, we suppose, is done
from an "impulse of self-preservation,"
but it is part of the American system,
consistent with all our ideas, and the
eminent gentlemen who favor annexa
tion would not have a word to say I
against it. When precisely the same
sort of interest, appealing to the same
motive and working through the same
instrumentalities, chances to protest
against the Hawaiian job, it becomes a
"big money-spending lobby." Then we
have no longer any right to consider
such lobbying as "a corrupt practice,"
but we must view the matter "from i
the broad view of international law, |
and as a matter of party policy." When i
we watch the Republican party at its j
antics we have to modify Mr. Lincoln's
expression, and wonder how it can ex
pect not to fool all of the people all
of the time, or all of the people some
of the time, or some of the people all
of the time, but how it imagines it can
impose on anybody or fool any of the
people any of the time.
Of the hundreds of commendatory and
appreciative letters received by the
Globe few ever find their way into
its columns. Acceptable as they are
in proving that the independence and
fairness of the newspaper are not with
out their reward, they are considered as
in a measure confidential, and their
publication a species of boast to which
the Globe is not given. The follow
ing, however, is made an exception to
the rule because it indicates that the
people appreciate the idea of journal
ism which the Globe has set before
them, and feel that it is fulfilling its
mission:
To the Editor of the Globe.
Over three years have elapsed since I sub
scribed to the Globe, which I find the best
and truest paper in the Twin Cities. The fact
Is It is more like a catholic newspaper than
any other, and in Its news everything is
streugbt. It does no crooked work, as some
papers do. An instance is the investigation
of the state prison, which is the best thing
that the Globe ever did. I must say
that it is the fairest newspaper in the North
west.
I send you my best regards for your work
in the past and my wishes for the very best
luck that God may give you, and I will 1-e
--niain a life subscriber to your paper as long
as the St. Paul Globe exists. Yours truly,

SII'RGNE COURT QUITS.
Minneapolis Protest Against Free
Xuturnllzation Papers.
The supreme court will probably
have no more Wednesday evening ses
sions for the naturalization of foreign
born citizens. For several weeks the
court did a i ushing business, the ap
plicants for "second papers" coming
over from Minneapolis by the hun
dreds. They were obliged to pajr the
$1 fee to the clerk of district court in
Minneapolis, while Clerk Dar Reese, of
the supreme court, with his usual gen
erosity, threw off his just fees. It was
found, however, that this coming to
St: Paul to secure second papers caused
considerable confusion in the work of
the different ward and precinct coni
mittees — and now they don't come any
more. The St. Paul embryo subjects
of Uncle Sam can be accommodated
at the office of the clerk of the dis
trict court, without money and without
price.
AROUND THE HOTELS.
Former St i 1 livui er Resident Is Home
From Alaska.
G. T. Barrett, a former resident of Still
water, who has been following the fur busi
ness in Alaska shice 18T9, came in from the
West yesterday on the Great Northern over
land train and announces that the business
is nearly petered out, but that ho has found
gold and oil-seeking much more profitable.
Seeking for furs, Mr. Barrett has been all
along the Alaskan (■oast from Sitka to Un
alaska, or Dutch Harbor, and along the
Yukon river as far as St. Michael's. He re
ports that crude petroleum has been found
in great quantities on the Pacific shore of
Alaska, near the Malaspina glacier, due south
of Mt. St. Elias. The whole Copper river
district, he believes from bis observations,
is rich in oil and gold. Barrels and barrels
of oil, he says, are running to waste at the
point mentioned, and already the Standard
Oil company has had representatives on the
ground securing claims. The Copper river,
he says, reaches the Birch creek district,
where gold abounds, and the trails and passes
are comparatively easy. The district is about
as far from Klondike as are the towns of
Dyea and Skaguay.

J. B. McCue Ii.IU In Front <>i a
Stret-t tar.
J. B. McCue, living at 1025 Burgess
street, narrowly escaped serious, if "not
fatal injuries, in a street car accident
at Tenth and St. Peter street, shortly
after 7 o'clock last evening. He was
driving south on St. Peter street quite
rapidly, and reached the intersection
of Tenth street at about the timt, an
east-bound Rondo car came along.
Fearing he could not cross safely ahead
of the car, McCue turned his horse
quickly onto Tenth street, but, by the
sudden swerve, was himself thrown
from the seat directly in front of the
car. The fender was pushed over Mc-
Cue's head, pinioning him to the
ground, but fortunately the motorman
had sufficient control of- the car to stop
it before the wheels touched McCue's
body. The injured man was taken
from the dangerous position and re
moved to Heller's drug store, where he
was attended by Dr. Martel. He had
several painful cuts about the head,
and part of his hair had been scrapped
off by the dragging under the fender,
but it is thought that he is not dan
gerously hurt. A carriage took McCue
to his home.
HEI.MOX OF PIONEERS.
.Jubilee Social to Be Held in St. Paul
.lan. 8.
The Minnesota Territorial Pioneers will
have what they call a jubilee social at the
state capitol in the house of representatives
on Saturday evening. Jan. 8. This date was
chosen on account of the full moon and
the late trains Saturday night. All old set
tlers In the state, male and female, are cor
dially Invited. This means those who came
on or before May 11, 1&>8, the date the terri
tory became a state. There will be music,
singing, speaking and talking, and plenty of
unadulterated sociability, all as free as Min
nesota ozqne. .It is asserted on pretty good
authority that all pioneers who attend may
experience a warm time In the old town that
night.
Many members of the Territorial Pioneers
settled in Minnesota before some members
of the Old Settlers' association did. For in
stance, George W. Mortimer, of -1*1(9 Whitall j
street, was born here fifty-eight years ago; j
served three years in the First Minnesota
regiment, but was not old enough to join the
Old Settlers' association, which includes only
men who were twenty-one years old Jan. 1,
1850. There are Territorial Pioneers who have
lived here over sixty years, and are not
eligible to the Old Settlers' association. Hon.
Lorenzo Hoyt is the youngest old settler.
He is past seventy. The Territorial Pioneer
may be a hundred, but he can't be but a
few minutes under forty years old. The Old
Settlers do not include the women, the Pio
neers do.

sued transportation for the officers who will
participate in the election of a successor to
Col. Shandrew of the Third regiment, which,
according to an order from Adjt. Gen. Muehl
berg, will be held at the capitol Saturday.
It is' tie opinion of national guardsmen that
Maj. Van Duzee will be the officer chosen.
Either Capt. Bartlett, of B, at Anoka, or j
('apt. Persons, of 1). at Zumbiota. it is
thought will be elected to succeed Maj. Van
Duzee, while the name of Cap 1 :. G. C. Teare,
of G, at Duluth, is also a strong possibility.
Capt. Teare is a West Point man ; has been
lieutenant of the Twenty-fifth infantry, and is
a popular guard officer.
He served as county attorney for S>r. Louis
county for two terms, and some of his friende
are working hard to secure his election to
succeed Maj. Van Duzee.

PENDING APPROPRIATION BILL.
It Provide* for the Support of the
Commiwlon, and Will Be Fully
Discussed.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.— The house
today, after a session of about two
hours, adjourned out of sympathy for
the president, whose mother was buried
at Canton this afternoon. The time of
the session was devoted to the consid
eration of the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill. It was de
cided to postpone the consideration of
the item providing for the maintenance
of the civil service commission, until
after the other features of the bill had
been concluded. It was apparent from
the remarks made today that the entire
subject would be exhaustively debated.
There is seemingly no disposition to
curtail the discussion and it probably
will not be concluded before the holi
day recess. So absorbing: la the topic
that almost the entire time today, de
spite the fact that the consideration of
the question had been technically post
poned, was consumed in debate upon it.
Mr. Bingham, in charge of the meas
ure, in reporting the bill in committee
of the whole stated that the widest lat
itude would be allowed for debate,
even if it should run over the holiday
resess. He asked, however, that the
provision of the bill relating to the civil
service and the debate thereon should
go over until after the consideration of
the other features of the bill was con
cluded.
Mr. Bingham's request was agTeed to
and an hour and a half was set aside
for general debate on the rest of the
bill. Mr. Barrett (Rep., Mass.) took the
floor and made some general remarks
in support of the civil service law.ln the
course of which he referred to the
slender minority against the civil ser
vice law when it passed the house in
ISB3. The vote stood 155 to 47. Messrs.
Cannon (Rep., 111.) and Bingham (Rep.,
Pa.) reiterated their opposition to the
bread extension of the law by execu
tive orders. The latter explained that
the law was passed under suspension
of the rules, practically without debate
and never contemplated an extension by
executive orders that would cover 87,
--000 government employes.
M: Dockery (Dem., Mo.) discussed the
amazing growth of the expenditures of
the government during the recent years.
The ordinary expenses of the govern
ment, exclusive of the public debt. in the
last eight years exceeded those of the
preceding eight years by $1,000,000,000 in
round numbers' In view of this fact
there were only two ways, he said, to
bring the receipts and expenses togeth
er. Either taxation must be increased
or the expenses must be curtailed. If
the expenses were not to be reduced
congress alone could not accomplish
much without the aid of the executive
branch of the government. Despite the
president's appeal in his message for
economy, the executive branches of the
government had submitted to congress
estimates for appropriations of $27,000,
--000 in excess of the appropriations for
the current year.
At this paint the committee rose and
Mr. Grosvenor addressed the chair,
saying: "Mr. Speaker: As is well
known the funeral exercises of the
mother of the chief magistrate of the
nation are to take place at this hour
and therefore conforming to the action
of the senate, and as a token of our
sympathy and respect for the president,
1 move that the house do now adjourn."
The motion was unanimously carried
and at 1:45 the house adjourned until
tomorrow.
The special committee of Republican
representatives in congress, who are
seeking to change the civil service law
held its first meeting today and out
lined its action. It was determined to
divide the work between two subcom
mittees, one to draft a bill changing
the law, and another to gather evidence
on the defects of the present law, its
extension beyond the original purpose
of the law, etc. The purpose of the lat
ter committee is to make flear to the
house when the subject shall come up
that a change is imperative. Chairman
Grosvenor named as the subcommittee
to frame a bill, Messrs. Hepburn do.),
Pearson <N. C), and Evans (Ky.), and
as the subcommittee to examine into
defects of the law. Messrs. Tawney,
(Minn.), Odell (N. TC), and Steele (Indj.
Their work will begin at once.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.— The senate
was in session just fifteen minutes to
day, adjournment being taken until to

McKinlty, who is today in attendance
upon the funeral of his mother. The
motion to adjourn was made by Mr.
Hoar (Mass.). "All senators, 1 ' said he,
"are aware of the great calamity that
has overtaken the chief magistrate of
the nation. He is today in attendance
upon the funeral of his mother. Out

SAWVKR SEES A WHOLE LOT,
But He Declares He Han Quit Pol

Special to the Globe.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.— Ike Wing, of Ash
land, and ex-Senator Sawyer, of Wisconsin,
I are stopping at the Shoreham. Senator Saw
' yer, who was the manager of political af-
I fairs in Wisconsin for a quarter of a cen
! tury, says: "lam the happiest man that ever
went into politics and got out alive. I have
no enemies to punish, and I have no oppor
tunities to reward friends. Hence, I am
calm and serene."
"Who will be the next governor of Wis
consin?"
"I don't know; but I am sure it will not
jbe one of the Hoard-La Follette-Haugen
! crowd. I shall take no part in the matter,
but I know that none of those old "Bennett
law' fellows can be nominated, because they
would be beaten out of their boots. All of
the candidates for the senate will look out
for a strong gubernatorial candidate. If
j any of the boys think I am opposing them.
I they are mistaken. I am absolutely out of
politics."
"Who will be the next senator from Wis
consin?"
"Some good Republican, of course. It may
be Quarles or Payne or Ike Stephenson. I
am too old, and am tired of it all. I think
that Ike Stepheuson is well located geo
graphic-ally In the northeastern part of the
state. If he should go to the senate ho would
not make many speeches, but he would saw
wood all the time, and make thing 3 hum.
He is a good man."
Of course Senator Sawyer Is out of poli
tics; tout his views axe aa good a* the face
value of his checks; for he Is as keen and
alert on political affairs as ever he was.

Canadian Timber Policy.
TORONTO, Ont, Dec 14.— 1t Is learned
from excellent authority that the Ontario
government's proposed timber policy will not
provide for the manufacture of all saw log 3
in Ontario. The government will prove that
this is legally impossible. They will instead
propose a remedy by means of stumpage
dues, which will yery much increase the
cost of logs for export. This will have, prac
tically the same effect and will obviate any
possibility of trouble in the courts.

Aie annexation of the Hawaiian islands; and,
Whereas. That annexation would be tanta
mount to the admission of a sla^e state, the
representatives of which would necessarily
work and vote for the enslavement of labor
in general ; therefore, be It
Reßolved, I?y the American Federation o!
Labor that, we disapprove of annexation; and,
Resolved, That we ursit the I'niud States
senate to reject the treaty of annexation, and
to take such other Bteps as may nu neces
sary to maintain amicable relations with Ha
waii.
Andred Furuseth made a warm
speech opposing the annexation, and
George E. McNeill suggested that the
I substitute be amended ko as t<> pro
vide for the incoming executive coun

j tion to annexation. The substitute h*
amended was adopted. The resolutions

CONTINUOUS ACTION.
Gen. \\ i-Mt niiK-of l's ISrlKiuif lvc|»f
Huny by Trlbeniueii .
SIMLA, Dec. 14.— According to offi
cial dispatches from the Northwestern
frontier, the inarch of Gen. West
mascotts brigade from the camp at
Cher-Khel Into the Sturi-Khel country,
was in continuous action. The enemy
closed up on the rear guard and kept |
firing at short range with great spirit.
The British losses were heavy and in- J
eluded Lieut. West, of the Gurkhas. ;
who was killed, and Lieut. Champiar,
who was wounded.
The whole march down the Bara. val
ley since the sixth instant Ims been
marked by incessant fighting, but th.
force has behaved admirably. The
route was difficult in the extreme.
through rain, mud and snow. Along
the river the course was Impeded by :
ravines and boulders and the Icy cold
stream had to be forded kmv deep
twenty times. Twelve thousand trans
port animals with numerous Sikhs
wounded, encumbered progress. The
casualties yesterday were about fifty
and today about ten. The enemy has
been severely punished in the recent
encounter. The disaster to Gen. Kemp
ster's rear guard, that was cut off by
the. tribesmen on Saturday near Sher-
Khel, was due to tha animals becom
ing entangled in the rice fields at dusk.
To increase the difficulty, the drivers
and carriers op?ned kegs of rum and
became hopelessly drunk. Many of
their followers were benumlind by the
icy stream and their feet bruised by
the boulders. Several men are still
mtesing.

CONSULAR REFi 'KM.
One of tin* most important! rep
presented and adopted was that of
Jonathan A. Lane, of Boston, on tin
reform of the consular service. The
report advocated the extension of the
civil service rules t f > cover the consular
service to the end of securing
business men In the service rather than
purely political appointees. Anotner
Important recommendation was that
hereafter Importers be compelled to at
test their Invoices before a magistral ■
i>:' the country from which the koo«i*
are shipped, In addition to their oath
before the United States consul. In
this connection, it Is alleged thai
eral million dollars are lost, to the
government annually by under \
tion in goods paying an ad valorem
duty, the oath before a United St.at.s
consul not being binding In the country
-•f export, and theiv consequently be
ing no method of punishing those guilty
of this form of deception, it was fur
ther stated by the report that many "f
Hi*- largest exporting houses In foreign
<•■ unt rWs have their own agents In this
country who connive at this violation
of law.
A report was adopted from the com
mittee "ii uniformity of state laws.
This especially looks to the unifying
of commercial laws In the various
states. There is at present so great a
variety among the banking lawa and
laws relating to commercial paper that
much confusion results in th.- conduct
of inter-state business. Several of the
states have abrogated 'h f - iav\* relat
ing to days of grace on commercial pa ■
per, and there aiv many other varia
ti< ns which make it almost impossible
for business men to 'any "ii transac
tions outside their own states without
the aid •>( a lawyer at the othei
