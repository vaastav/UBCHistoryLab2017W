.The President's Message
PRESIDENT TAFT breaks the record for brevity, with Ms annual message
that is, for recent years. The earlier presidents got through in less, hut
McKi nifty used to string them out some and Roooovelt wrote whole encyclo
pedias, dictionaries, gazetteers, medical treatises, literary essays, aad sociological
libraries to congress on his official note paper at the beginning of every session
and every few days thereafter.
President Taft's idea is that not more than one big subject can be expected te
soak into the congressional mjnd at one sitting. He will probably- write- a Rease-.
veltian volume before he exhausts Ms subjects, but it will be administered in safe
doses, and not turned in with a force pomp. The first dose is 6000 words, printed
today.
In this connection it is well to remember that the story of the creation of the
world is told in 300 words, which shows that the gentleman who forgot to copy
right his masterpiece, the book of Genesis, must have been an artist at condensing
his narrative as well as a remarkably successful politician. One thing sure, Gen.
Moses never wrote on space rates.
President Taft's first advice to congress is to kt the Sherman anti-trust act
alone neither to amend nor to repeal it. He is willing that certain new legislation
to supplement the law be enacted, especially laws providing for voluntary federal
incorporation of concerns doing an interstate business, establishing a national cor
poration commission, and more clearly defining unlawful acts and methods.
The message will be read with particular interest by lawyers, but every citizen
who tries to keep up with the course of national lawmaking and discussion ought to
get the gist of it at least. The president goes quite fully into the late decisions of
the supreme; court in the tobacco and oil cases; shows their real effect; demon
strates that they read no new'meaning into the law but merely follow well astao
lished precedent; and describee how one of the big corporations proceeded against,
the tobacco combine, has gone to work under the direction of the court to dissolve
itself into constituent companies which, in the nature of things, according to the
president, must either become active competitors or else drop behind in the indus
trial march. Injunctions prevent individual stockholders from acquiring monopo
listic control inside three years.
The president makes clear that mere size should not in itself be regarded as
a condition inimical to the public welfare, but only such features should be inter
fered with as tend unduly to restrict industry or commerce, or to prevent whole.
some competition. Combinations based on. lawful aad rational considerations,
whose effect is to reduce costs of production and promote effkiescy, without unda
interference with competitors, are not to be regarded as a menace.
The message sent in today is entirely devoted to regulation of corporations,
indicating that this subject will be one of the first and most important to be
taken up by congress at this session.

Green Turtles As. Witnesses
MY FIRST LOVE ike Hu'.'b
By Merits Sapbir. ShorfStory
L
WHAT, THEK, is a turtle? Is it as aaimaL or is it a reptile? And if it
ic a reptile, is it also an animal? Is man an animal? Is a snake an
animal? Is a common housefly an aakaal? ibeee questions, knotty as a
rats' neat, are just new burdening the courts in Hew York, with so solution ia
sight.
There ia a deep philosophical principle unefered, and the whole fabric of laws
and ordinances intended to prevent "cruelty to aaimak" may be dependent on the
final deasiM in this Xew York case. A ship arrived from southern waters with
a miscellaneous cargo, including 65 live green turtles. The captain had taken pre
caution against the turtles escaping en route, by piercing the flippers of the beasts
and running a rope through them; he also made the five soup meat lie on its back
all the way to New York, which, even for a turtle, must have been stretching the
rest cure fad rather to the point of ennui.
Arriving at New York, the "prevention of cruelty to animals" people got after
the skipper, and hauled him up before a magistrate, who promptly ruled that the
ship captain had been guilty of violating the law, and must be punished. The law
yer for the ship captain contended that a turtle is not an animal, but is classed by The
naturalists as a reptile. Tbe prosecution then presented numerous authorities to ' flSlfc-
show that the plain intent of the law was to prevent cruelty to any Hving creature
except man. Whereupon the defence cited the case of the lobster, which is uni
versaDy prepared for eating by being thrown alive into boiling waterhe forced the
prosecution to admit that it bad never heard of a charge of cruelty to lobsters.
The turtles have been arrested and are being held as witnesses. They are
probably as well able to sit on their own case as any of the other animals on the 1
two contending sides.
Question arises, where shall the line be drawn? Where can man say that
intelligence and sensibility end and living creatures leee their right te having their
feelisgg considered?. Birds are low in the animal soak, yet they seem to suffer
sharply. Fishes and reptiles are extremely sensitive to injury. Many flowers suffer
and wither and die at a careless touch. The lowest growths in sea and air, visible
to the unaided eye, seem to possess nerves.
What would you think about it, if you were a turtle?
OJ'AS-BBRBNY is the name of the
happy Hungarian country where,
under the tutelage of my mentor,
rabbi Leblsch, I made my first entry
into the world of science. Rabbi Le

yelled: "Ton will neither learn to read

old." On the other side, he prophesied
that Sanele, whose letters looked as if
they ware engraved, was bound to be

scientist. The whims of fate .are
strange, however, for. when 36 years

which separated our homes and In
which our sweet words of love mingled
agreeably with the rustle of the leaves.
In the midst at the fields was a

enjoyed, though they were far from
being ripe. The corn gave us its shade,
the tree its green fruits and our love

looking at one another like a picture
of two Chinamen I remember -from my
natural history drinking tea umler a
tree. If a noise was suddenly theard
among the leaves Frumetel Jumped up
and cried in a voice that trembled with
rear: "it is mama!"
It was nothing, however, but our
goat, which was also in the habit of
visiting the corn field for less romantic
reasons. But soon afterwards I would
Jump up and whisper: "jOh, my God, it's
rabbi Leblsch!" But It would only be
some boy who came to steal seme of
the unripe fruit of the tree.
Our love suffered a terrible shock
when the time came to cut down the

rah-rah boys are wearing them four

fourths in the brim. This is what it
means to have George, who does not
care for dress, to reign in London in
stead of Edward:
The Fmrey-Wuxzy.
The fuzsy-wtntzy hat, the hat with
whiskers, the velvet hat, the hat
known technically as the scratch-up
bat, are other current manifestations
of the successful efforts of the hatters
to Introduce strange and outre cus
toms into the men's hat business. Ac
cording to the leading trade Journal
of the hat Industry in the United States
it is the purpose of the manufacturers
and retailers of hats to endeavor in the
future to make 'such radical changes
in the new hats offered from season
to season that it will be quite impos
sible for a man to pull out his last
fall's soft hat and wear it In the spring
months that intervene between the
derby and the straw hat.
In other words, a systematic effort
is being made to change the style of
men's hats as distinctly, if not as radi
cally, as the milliners change the
styles of women's hats from season to
season and from year to. year. It can
hardly be charged even by the moat

to read my hieroglyphics. You under
stood what I wrote, fortunately, while
I myself did not.
Yes. charming Frumetel. we are made
for one another! Destiny, rabbi Le
blsch and Joseph Pal's sheepskins suc
ceeded in separating us. First loves
are rarely crowned with success.
I was forbidden to go near any
library and knew nothing of either
Fontaine or Werther. I had never seen
any lave letters, for I knew nothing
of any literature except my Latin and
Hungarian grammars. Helotee and
Abelard. Dante and his beloved, Char
lotte. Mignon and all other heroines of
love were strangers to me Still I lived
y own love story and became a
Romeo. ..
My uncle and Frumetel's father were
the Montagues and Capulets of Loyas
Bereny. An old feud held the families
apart, a quarrel which had its founda
tion in the competition for the skins
of the sheep that died in the folds of
Joseph Pal. the squire of the village.
My uncle hated to lose these, but very
often FrumeteVe father got them, be
cause the price he offered was higher,
and every time this happened it in
creased my uncle's hatred. But trifles
like these never kept lovers apart.
Frumetel was tbe only daughter df
old Beers. Simple and modest, she had
been raised among the geese and had
grown before anyone noticed it. Every
Friday she dressed her red hair as if
for a high festival, and she appeared
in the synagog Saturday mornings, her
short and stout body clothed in a long
ome gown, ner lest, which x rami ad
mit were rather large, encased In yel
low shoes and her hair tied with a
black silk ribbon. When I saw her
thus a tender passion arose within me,
every thought of the sheepskins disap
peared and I saw nothing but her. In
my excessive happiness I . could have
kwsed even rabbi Leblsch and his pipe
stem. I, was with my 10 years a vpry
handsome fellow. I was the Alclblades
of the village, the dandy among my
comrades and the Caesar o their bat
tles. To appreciate me fully you ought
to have seen me in my Saturday
clothes!
I had long been sighing for a blue
suit and at last, thanks to a peddler
of cloth, my wish was gratified- Un
fortunately this same peddler Mid not
have enough cloth of tbe same color,
and my uncle did not think it mattered
much that the front of my suit was
light blue and the back of a very much
darker shade of blue. The result was
that, seen from the front, I looked like
the sky In May, and from behind, like
the same sky in November. With this
suit I wore as a crowning glory a black
velvet cap, edged with white lamb's fur.
This cap was exceedingly large and al
most met in front of my face, the two
corners of an immense linen collar,
which protruded from my coat, beyond
my eyes.
Thus attired, I appeared at the
svnagoc. fullv convinced of my own
irresistible powers to charm Frumetel,
and I immediately read in her ees a
dais we went there for the last time to
deplore our misfortune, for there was
near Lovas-
Bereny. no olive grove, no friendly
care, no forest of cocus palms to shel
ter our ardent love OHr misery, there
fore, was boundless, and. having had
a good cry together, we decided that
mere was nothing left but to exchange
secret messages of love.
So I was forced to write. I had
promised to do so and Frumetel expect
ed me to keep my promise soon. My
colleague, the caligrapher Sanele, was
to be Cupid's messenger, and I was-to
give him half of my lunch every day
for his faithful services, a great sacri
fice, for the lunch consisted of a big
slice of bread geenrously covered with
prune marmalade. It was not without
a great deal of sighing that I paltTnlm
his due.
Two days passed before I was able to
finish my first letter, for I had not the
slightest idea what to write to the
beautiful Frumetel. At last I' had a
divine Inspiration. Every five or six
weeks rabbi Leblsch wrote a letter to
his wife, who was then living in Pa
lata. I resolved to copy one of these
letters, and succeeded In getting hold
of one of them, which was written in
most poetic Hebrew Oriental terms:
"To the excellent. Just and pious
Dame Chane, a pearl among women and
the treasure of her fireside. To the
fertile spouse, the beloved of my soul,
the Joy and pride of her children,
whose memories will last for centuries
untold. Greeting!"
After this long preamble came the
following short letter:
"I write you that I have absolutelv
nothing to write about I am in the
best of health and hope to hear the
same from you. Sometimes I have an
attack of my old pains, and remain,
"Your faithful husband,
"Your Little RabW Leblsch."
I copied the letter word by word,
simply substitulng "Frumetel" for
"Dame Chane."
Three days later the answer came.
It looked very strange I hurriedly
opened the pill of well chawed bread
In which it ws enclosed. Imagine my
disappointment when I could not read
a word Juliet's letter to Romeo was
a veritable Cattesrat of lnsk shots wtth
y a fe wlines between.
How was I to decipher this message
of love? I simply could not. But what
did it matter, after all? Were not all
these Ink marks made by her little
hards? Was that not enough? I was
happy. Nevertheless, I never gave up
my attempt to read it, and this caused
my downfall I was caught by rabbi
Leblsch, who snatched away the pre
cious letter and read it.
How he did, I am unable to under
stand even today, but when he had read
It he began to tear his hair and yell
like a wounded boar. A moment later
I felt the pipe stem dancing on my
back.
But love, all powerful love, did not
fail me then, for when I saw my be
loved's message in his profane hands, I
became furious, rushed at him. knocked
him over, took away his pipe stem,
broke it in two and threw it out of
the window
tors are at work for a change. A news
paper published in Rome recently
Jtrlnted a symposium giving tbe opln
ons of 1000 European artists and
sculptors on the problem of men's
dress. Eight hundred and 40 of the
1000 declared in favor of a radical
change- Curiously enough, a great
majority of these protested most ve
hemently against the unnecessary but
tons that adorn the backs and tbe
sleeves of men's coats.
The "Prince Albert" has disappeared
before the attack of the now ultra
fashionable morning coat. The morn
ing coat is nothing more or less than
the old-time black cutaway. Its ap
peal to the man of the hour appears
to lie In the fact that it is an adapt
able garment. For Informal wear or
for business a man may don a morn
in$r coat, wearing with it a derby hat
fold collar, four-ln-hand tie and calf
shoes. Then; for a formal occasion, the
same coat will do duty, the accessories
being a poke or wing collar, an ascot
or a once-over cravat, white stiff shirt
and patent leather shoes, the whole be
ing surmounted Dy tne siik top nat.
And thus is shattered the tradition of
old that never, never would it be prop
er for a man to wear a derby hat with
a tail coat The times change and
manners change with them. '
Shoulders Out ef Style.
In every day clothes even the most
careless observer cannot fail to see
that shoulders have gone out of style.
The same tailors who a few years ago
built Out huge extensions, rectangular
in form, over the sloping shoulders of
an enemic mollycoddle, now pinch and
pare to give the square-shouldered
athlete the appearance of a consump
tive in the last stages of his dread
disease. It Is English, you know.
A distinguished1 authority on men's
wearing apparel lately hazarded the
prediction that within five years' time
the styles 'of clothes cut In the United
States and England would come to a
common plane.
He says that England is toning up
and that America is toning down and
that within a few years nobody will
-be able to tell an American-mjade suit
from a British-made suit, except by
reason of the fact that Americans sew
seams that He flat, while the British
tailor inevitably sews a seam o that
It will pucker. Whether or not the
puckered seam will become fashionable
in America as a result of the toning
down process Is a problem for the fu
ture. One thing seems certain, and that
Is that the American man will continue
to insist upon a crease down the front
of his trousers, a transparent preten
tion of newness that fools nobody and
which keeps some millions of men en
gaged daily in hoisting their "pants"
over the knees.

to the comfort of the male animal. It

deavor is worth your tim3 the- effort
a great success and a potent factor
for good here and everywhere- The
premium on the effort has been paid

Editor El Paso Herald;
I have Just read your masterly edit
orial on -Unwise Lenders oL, Better
Men" in Saturday's Orf. The prin
ciples of union labor are granite mon
uments of truth, but the folly of in
toxicated power of organised' monopo
listic foolishness as told in the crim
inal story of the McNamara confes
sion should be a warning to all civili
sation to steer clear of socialistic
anarchistic movements.
