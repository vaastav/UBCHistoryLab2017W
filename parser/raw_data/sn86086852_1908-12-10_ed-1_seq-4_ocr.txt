FARE
WELL!
Last Message of Roose
velt to a Conven
ing Congress
Document Wholly De
void of Anything
Dramatic
Corporations, Courts,
Forests and Other
Matters Discussed
Washington, Dec. 9. —What is ac
cepted as President Roosevelt’s fare
well message was presented to con
gress yesterday, and in it there is
noted nothing calculated to give it
classification as a memorable docu
ment. It follows the conventionalities
of such a paper. There can be no
telling when the Philippines should
be accorded self-government, he says,
though that time must surely come.
Fortifications there and in Hawaii to
protect harbors from assault land
ward arc urged; competent young of
ficers in army and navy should be
jumped over the heads of “elderly in
competents.’' he affirms; good trusts
should be sanctioned but corporations
regulated; railways should be placed
entirely under the interstate commis
sion and removed wholly from the do
main of the anti-trust act; employes
should obtain a larger share of inter
est in business; telegraph and tele
phone companies should be placed un
der the interstate commission; a
strong centralizing spirit is mani
fested by the president; the injunc
tion is defended; postal savings
banks advocated; an employers' lia
bility law defended; “half holiday
during summer” for all government
workers is urged —half each day or
only on Saturdays is not stated; the
doubling of all judicial salaries is de
manded, and a score of other themes
discussed.
Finances.
‘ The financial standing of the na
tion is excellent,” says the president;
but our currency system is imperfect,
and it is earnestly to be hoped that
the commission will be able to pro
pose a thoroughly good system which
will do away with existing defects.
From July 1, 1901, to Sept. 30. 1908
there was an increase of money in
circulation of $902,991,399, an in
crease per capita of $7.06. Within
this time there were several occasions
when it was necessary for the treas
ury to come to the relief of the mar
ket by purchases or redemptions of
bonds; by increasing deposits in na
tional banks; by stimulating addi
tional issues of national bank notes,
and by facilitating importations from
abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur
rency system made these proceedings
necessary, is the conviction of the
president.
During the past seven years there
has been a net surplus of nearly one
hundred millions of receipts over ex
penditures. a reduction of the inter
est-bearing debt by ninety millions,
in spite of the extraordinary expense
of the Panama canal, and a saving ot
nearly nine millions annual interest
There have been no new taxes and no
increases of taxes; on the contrary
some taxes have been taken off:
there has been a reduction of taxa
tion.
Corporations.
“I believe that under the interstate
clause of the constitution the United
States has complete right to control
all agencies of interstate commerce,”
says the president, ‘and I believe
that the national government alone
can exercise this right with effective
ness so as both to secure justice
from, and to do justice to the great
corporations. I believe that it is
folly to attempt to prohibit all combi
nations as is done by the Sherman
anti-trust law. I advocate a law
which shall permit combinations
which are in the interest of the pub
lic. but. shall at the same time giv*
to some agency of the national gov
ernment full power of control and
supervision. One of the chief feat
ures of this control should be se
curing entire publicity in all matter?
which the public has a right to know,
and furthermore, the power, not by
judicial but by executive action, to
prevent or put a stop to every form of
improper favoritism or other wrong
doing.
“The rarrways should be put com
pletely under the interstate com
merce commission and removed from
the domain of the anti-trust law. The
power of the commission should be
made thoroughgoing, so that it could
exercise complete supervision and
control over the issue of securities as
well as over the raising and lowering
of rates. As regards rates, at least,
this power should be summary. The
shareholders, the employes and the
shippers all have interests that must
be gaurded. It is to the interest of
all of them that no swindling stock
speculation should be allowed, and
that there should be no imprgper is
suance of securities. There must be
no defrauding of investors, oppres
sion of farmers and business men who
ship freight, or callous disregard of
the rights aud needs of the employes.
Rates must be made as low as is
compatible with giving proper returns
to all employes from highest to low-
est, and proper returns to the share
holders; but they must not, for in
stance. be reduced In such fashion as
to necessitate a cut in wages or the!
abolition of the proper and legitimate 1
profits of honest shareholders.
• Telegraph and telephone com
panies engaged in interstate business
should be put under the jurisdiction
of the interstate commerce commis
sion.'’
Ce tralization.
The proposal to make the national
government supreme over, and there
fore to give it complete control over,
the railroads and other instruments o
interstate commerce is merely a pro
posal to carry out to the letter one of
the prime purposes, if not the prime
purpose, for which the constitution
was founded, says the president. It
does not represent centralization. It
represents merely the acknowledgment
of the patent fact that centralization
has already come in business. If this
irresponsible outside business power is
to be controlled in the interest of tn.
genera! public it can only be controlled
none way; by giving adequate power
of control to the one sovereignty cap
able of exercising such power—the na
tional government. Forty or fifty sepa
rate state governments can not exer
cise that power over corporations doing
business in most or all of them.
The president says he believes that
'he more farsighted corporations are
themselves coming to recognize the
unwisdom of the violent hostility they
have displayed to regulation and con
trol. Concentrated power is palpable
visible, responsible, easily reached,
quickly held to account.
Labor.
As far as possible the president
hopes to see a. frank recognition of ihe
advantages conferred by mach'inery,
organization, and division of labor, ac
companied by an effort to bring about
a larger share in the ownership by
wageworker of railway, mill, and fac
tory. In fanning, this simply means
that we wish to see the farmer own
his own land; we do not wish
to see the farms so large that
.hey become the property of ab
sentee landlords who farm them by
tenants, nor yet so small that the
farmer becomes like a European peas
ant. Every increase in the number o
small stockholders in corporations is
a good thing, for the same reasons;
and where the employes are the stock
holders the result is particularly good.
Very much of this movement must be
outs de of anything that can be accom
plished by legislation. Postal sav
ings banks will make it easy for the
poorest to keep their savings in
sa.ety. The regulation of the national
highways must be such that they shah
serve all people with equal justice
Corporate finances must be supervised
so as to make it far safer than at
present for the man of small means to
invest his money in stocks. There
must be prohibit on of child labor,
diminution of woman labor, shortening
of hours o: all mechanical labor; stock
watering should be prohibited, and
stock gambling so far as is possible
discouraged. There should boa pro
gressive inheritance tax on large for
tunes. Industrial education snould be
encouraged. As far as possible we
should lighten the burden of taxaCon
on the small man. We should put a
premium upon thrift, hard work, and
business energy; but these qualities
cease to be the main factors in accum
ulating a fortune long before that
fortune reaches a point where it would
be seriously affected by any Inheri
tance tax. It is right that the nation
should fix the terms upon which great
fortunes are inherited. They rarely
do good and they often do harm to
ihose who inherit them in their en
tirety.
There should be no paltering with
tae question of taking care ot the wage
workers who get killed, crippled, o
worn out. The majority of wage
workers must have their rights se
?ured for them by state action; but
one national government should legis
iate not only lor all employes oi
the national government but Tor all
persons engaged in interstate com
me: ce. The object sought for could he
achieved to a measurable degree, as
tar as those killed or crippled are con
cerned. by proper employers’ liability
laws. As far as concerns those who
have been worn out. attention is called
to the fact that steps toward providing
old-age pensions have been taken in
many private industries. These may
be indefinitely extended through volun
tary association and contributory
schemes, or through the agency- of sav
ings banks, as under the Massachusetts
plan. The president says to congress
to pass a model employers’ liability
law for the District of Columbia; and
“I renew my recommendation made in
a previous message that halfdiolidays
be granted during summer to aJI wage
workers in government employ,” adds
the president, who also advocates the
8-hour day on all federal work.
Judges’ Salaries.
“I most earnestly urge upon the
congress the duty of increasing the
totally inadequate salaries now given
to our judges. On the whole there
is no body of public servants who do
as valuable work, nor whose moneyed
reward is so inadequate compared to
their work. Beginning with the su
preme court the judges should have
their salaries doubled. It is not be
fitting the dignity of the natkxn that
its most honored public servants
should be paid sums so small com
pared to what they would earn in pri
vate life that the performance of pub
lic service by them implies an ex
ceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.”
It is to be desired that some meth
od should be devised for doing away
with the long delays which obtain in
the administration of justice. Much of
the intolerable delay is due to “im
proper regard paid to technicalities
which are a mere hindrance to justice.
In some noted recent cases this over
regard for technicalities has resulted
in a striking denial of justice, and fla
grant wrong to the body politic.”
Gompers’ Attack.
Last year, before the house com
mittee on the judiciary, labor leaders
formulated their demands, specifying
the bill that contained them, refusing
all compromise, stating they wished
the principle of that bill or nothing.
They insisted on a provision that in
a abor dispute no injunction should
issue except to protect a property
right, and specifically provided that
the right to carry on business should
not be construed as a property right;
and in a second provision their bill
made legal in a labor dispute any act
or agreement by or between two or
more persons that would not have
been unlawful if done by a single per
son. In other words, this bid legal
ized blacklisting and boycotting in
every form legalizing, for instance,
those forms of the secondary boycott
which the anthracite coal strike com
mission so unreservedly condemned;
while the right to carry on a business
was explicit.y taken out from under
that protection which the law throws
over property. The demand was
made that there should be a trial by
jury in contempt cases, thereby most
seriously impairing the authority of
the courts. All this represented a
course of policy which, if carried out,
would mean the enthronement of
class privilege in its crudest and
most brutal form, and the destruction
of one of the most essential functions
of the judiciary in all civilized lands.
The violence of the crusade for this
legislation, and its complete failure,
i lustrate two truths which it is essen
tial our people should learn. In the
first place, they ought to teach the
workingman, the laborer, the wage
worker, that by demanding what is
improper and impossible he plays into
the hands of his foes. Such a crude
and vicious attack upon the courts,
even if it were temporarily successful,
would inevitably in the end cause a
violent reaction and would band the
great mass of citizens together, forc
ing them to stand by a 1 the judges,
competent and incompetent alike,
rather than to see the wheels of jus
tice stopped. A movement of this kind
can ultimately result in nothing but
damage to those in whose behalf it is
nominally undertaken.
The wageworkers, the workingmen,
the laboring men of the country by
the way in which they repudiated the
effort to get them to cast their votes
in response to an appeal to class
hatred, have emphasized their sound
patriotism and Americanism. The
whole country has cause to feel pride
in this attitude of sturdy independ
ence, In this uncompromising insist
ence upon acting simply as good citi
zens, as good Americans, without re
gard to fancied —and improper—class
interests. Such an attitude is an ob
ject lesson in good citizenship to the
entire nation.
Court Dacisions.
i There are certain decisions by vari
ous courts which have Ik en detrimen
tal to the rights of wageworkers. This
i is true of all the decisions that decide
j that men and women are, by the con-
I stitution, “guaranteed their liberty”
i to contract to enter a dangerous occu
pation. or to work an undesirable or
improper number of hours, or to work
in unhealthy surroundings; and there
fore can not recovt r damages when
maimed in that occupation, and can
not be forbidden to work what the
egislature decides is an excessive
; number of,hours, or to carry on the
work under conditions which the legis
lature decides to be unhealthy. The
most dangerous occupations are often
the poorest paid and those where the
hours of work are longest; and In
many cases those who go into them
are driven by necessity so great that
they have practically no alternative.
Decisions such as those aTuded to
above nullify the legislative effort to
protect the wage-workers who most
need protection from those employers
who take advantage of their grinding
need.
Provision should be made, says
the president, that no injunction or
temporary restraining order issue
otherwise than on notice, except where
irreparable injury wotTd otherwise re
sult; and in such case a hearing on
the merits of the order should be had
within a short fixed period, and, if
not then continued after hearing, it
should forthwith lapse. Decisions
should be rendered immediately, and
the chance of delay minimized in
every way.
Forests.
The forests can only be protected by
the state, by the nation; and the lib
erty of action of individuals must be
conditioned upon what the state or
nation determines to be necessary for
the common safety. The lesson of de
foristation in China is a lesson which
mankind should have learned many
times already from what has occurred
in Oiher places. Denudation leaves
nakea soil; then gullying cuts down to
the bare rock; and meanwhile the
rock-waste bunes the bottom lands.
When the soil is gone, men must go;
and the process does not take long.
This ruthless destruction of the for
ests in northern China has brought
about, or has aided in bringing about,
desolation, just as the destruction of
the forests in central Asia aid in
bringing ruin to the once rich central
Asian cities: just as the destruction
of the forests in northern Africa helped
towards the ruin of a region that was
a fertile granary in Roman days.
Shortsighted man. whether barbaric,
semi-civilized, or what he mistakenly
regards as fully civilized, when he has
destroyed the forests, has rendered
certain the ultimate destruction of the
land itself. In northern China the
mountains are now such as are shown
by the accompanying photographs, ab
solutely barren peaks. Not only have
the forests been destroyed, but be
cause of their destruction the soil has
been washed off the naked rock. The
terrible consequence is that it is im
possible now to undo the damage that
has been done. Many centuries would
have to pass before the soil would
again collect, or could be made to col
lect, in sufficient quantity once more
to support the old-time forest growth.
In consequence the Mongol desert is
practically extending eastward over
northern China. The climate has
changed and is still changing. It has
changed even within the last half cen
tury, as the work of tree destruction
has been consummated. Now that
there is no vegetation, the barren
mountains, scorched by the sun, send
up currents of heated air which drive
away instead of attracting the rain
clouds, and cause their moisture to be j
disseminated. In consequence, instead
of the regular and plentiful rains which
existed in these regions of China when
the forests were still in evidence, the
unfortunate inhabitants of the defor
ested lands now see their crops wither
for lack of rainfall, while the seasons
grow more and more irregular: and
as the air becomes dryer certain crops
refuse longer to grow at all. In addi
tion to the resulting agricultural dts
tress, the watercourses have changed.
Formerly they were narrow and deep,
with an abundance of clear water the
year around: for the roots and humus
of the forests caught the rain water
and let it escape by slow, regular seep
age. They have now become broad,
shallow stream beds, in which muddy
water trickles in slender currents dur
ing the dry seasons, while when it
rains there are freshets, and roaring
muddy torrents come tearing down,
bringing disaster and destruction
everywhere. What has thus happened
in northern China, what has happened
in central Asia, in Palestine, in north
Africa, in parts of the Mediterranean
countries of Europe, will surely happen
in our country if we do not exercise
that wise forethought which should be
one of the chief marks of any people
calling itself civilized. Nothing should
be permitted to stand in the way of
the preservation of the forests, and it
is criminal to permit individuals to
purchase a little gain for themselves
through the destruction of forests
when this destruction is fatal to the
wellbeing of the whole country in the
future.
Inland Waterways.
Action should be begun forthwith,
during the present session of the con
gress, for the improvement of our in
land waterways—action which will re
sult in giving us not only navigable
but navigated rivers. We have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars upon
these waterways, yet the traffic on
nearly all of (hem is steadily declin
ing. This condition is the direct result
of the absence of any comprehensive
and far-seeing plan of waterway im
provement. The plan which promises
the best and quickest results is that
of a permanent commission authorized
to coordinate (he work of all the gov
ernment departments relating to water
ways, and to frame and supervise the
execution of a comprehensive plan.
The time for playing with our water
ways is past. The country demands
results.
The president urges that all our na
tional parks adjacent to national for
ests bo placed completely under the
control of the forest service of the
agricultural department, instead of
leaving them as they now are, under
the interior department and policed by
the army. Congress should provide
for superintendents with adequate
corps of first-class civilian rangers.
The president urges postal savings
banks and a parcels post. Better aid
to the national educational department
is advised; war on tuberculosis and
other diseases is applauded: and the
president recommends that legislation
be enacted placing under the jurisdic
tion of the department of commerce
and labor the government printing of
fice. At, present this office is under
the combined control, supervision and
administrative direction of the presi
dent and of the joint committee on
printing of the two houses of congress.
It has 4.069 employes and spends from
$r,.000.000 to $7,000,000 a year. The
president advocates the immediate ad
mission of New Mexico and Arizona as
states and calls the attention of con
gress to the importance of the prob
lem of the fisheries in the interstate
waters. The fisheries of the Missis
sippi, the Ohio and the Potomac are
in a bad way. For this there is no
remedy except for the United States to
control and legislate for the interstate
fisheries as part of the* business of in
terstate commerce. The federal stat
ute regulating interstate traffic in game
should be extended to include fish.
Foreign Affairs.
We have behaved, and are behaving,
towards other nations, as in private
life an honorable man would behave
towards his fellows.
Panama Canal.
The work on the Panama canal is
being done with a speed, efficiency and
entire devotion to duty, which make it
a model of all work of the kind. No
task of such magnitude has ever before
been undertaken by any nation; and no
task of the kind has ever been better
performed.
Recommendation is made for the
extension of the ocean mail act, of 1891
so that satisfactory American ocean
mail lims to South America, Asia, the
Philippines and Australasia may be
established.
Hawaii.
We have begun to improve Pearl
harbor in Hawaii, for a naval base and
to provide the necessary military forti
fications for the protection of the is
lands, but the president can not too
strongly emphasize the need of appro
priations for these purposes of such
an amount as will within the shortest
possible time make those islands prac
ticably impregnable. It Is useless to
develop the industrial conditions of
the islands and establish there bases
of supply for our naval and merchant
fleets unless we insure, as far as hu
man ingenuity can. their safety from
foreign seizure. One thing to be re
membered with ali our fortifications
is that it is almost useless to make
them impregnable from the sea if they
are left open to land attack.
The Philippines.
The Filipino people, through their
officials, are making real steps in the
direction of self-government. The
president hopes and believes that
these steps mark the beginning of a
course which will continue till the Fil
ipinos become fit to decide for them
selves whether they desire to be an
independent nation. But no one can
prophesy the exact date when it will
be wise to consider Independence as a
fixed and definite policy. It would be
worse than folly to try to set down
such a date in advance, for it must de
pend upon the way in which the Phil
ippine people themselves develop the
power of self-mastery.
A Hint to Cuba.
The president again recommends
that American citizenship be confer
red upon the people of Porto Rico. In
Cuba our occupancy w r ill cease in
about two months’ time; the Cubans
have in ordt rly manner elected their
own governmental authorities, and the
island will be turned over to them.
Our occupation on this occasion has
asted a little over two years, and
Cuba has thrived and prospered un
der it. Our tamest hope and one de
sire is that the people of the Island
shall now govern themselves with jus
tice, so that peace and order may be se
cured. “We will gladly help them to
this end; but I would solemnly warn
them to remember the great truth that
the only way a ivople can permanent
ly avoid being governed from without
is to show that tlu y both can and will
govern themselves from within.’’
The Army.
As regards the army the president
calls attention to the fact that whMc
our junior officers and enlisted meu
stand very high, the present system of
promotion by seniority results in bring
ing into the higher grades many men
of mediocre capacity who have but a
short time to serve. No man should
regard it as bis vested r ght to rise
to the highest rank in the army any
more than in any other profession. It
is a curious and by no means credit
able fact that there should he so often
a failure on the part of the public and
its representatives to understand the
great need from the standpoint of the
service and the nation, of refusing to
promote respectable, elderly Incompe
tents. The higher places should he
given to the most deserving men with
out regard to seniority.
National Guard.
Now that the organized militia, the
national guard, has been incorporated
with the army as a part of the national
forces, it behooves the government to
do every reasonable thing in its power
to perfect its efficiency. It should be
assisted in its instruction and other
wise aided more liberally than hereto
fore. The continuous services of many
well-trained regular officers will be
essential in this connection. Such of
ficers must be specially trained at
service schools best to qualify them
as instructors of the guard. Hut the
detailing of officers for training at the
service schools and for duty with the
national guard entails detaching them
from their regiments which are al
ready greatly depleted by detachment
of officers for assignment to duties pro
scribed by acts of congress. A bill is
pending before congress creating a
number of extra officers in tin* army,
which, if passed, will enable more olli
cers to be trained us instructors of
guard and assigned to that duty. In
case of war it will he of the utmost im
portance to have a large number of
trained officers to use for turning raw
levies into good troops. There should
be legislation to provide a complete
plan for organizing the great body of
volunteers behind the regular army
and national guard when war has
come. Congressional assistance should
be given those who are endeavoring to
promote rifle practice so that our men.
in the services or out of them, may
know how to use the rifle. We should
encourage rifle practice among school
hoys, and indeed among all classes, as
well as in the military services. Thus,
and not otherwise, may we be able to
assist, in preserving the peace of the
world.
The president approves the recom
mendations of the general board for
the increase of the navy, calling espe
cial attention to the need of additional
destroyers and colliers, and above all,
of the four battleships. It is desirable
to complete as soon as possible a
squadron of eight battleships of the
best existing type. The North Dakota,
Delaware, Florida and Utah will form
the first division of this squadron. The
four vessels proposed will form the
second.
The president closes with laudation
of the battle fleet now circumnavigat
ing the globe.
