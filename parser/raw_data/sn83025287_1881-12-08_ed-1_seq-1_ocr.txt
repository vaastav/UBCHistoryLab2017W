HE OPENS COI'RT WITH HIS USUAL

He is Not Satisfied With the Political Situ

ise of a Washington Sensation Years ago
to a Chicago Man.
Washington, Dec. 7. — The criminal court
was densely crowded this morning. Among
the audience were Gen. Bherman and T. Dewitt
Talmago. To-day the prosecution commenced
in rebuttal, to demolish the theory of insanity
asset up by the defense. In doing this they
will retraverse the ground gone over by the
defense and from the standpoint of the prose
cution, will thoroughly ventilate Guiteau's
past life and habits, beginning with his early
life in Freeport, and concluding with a vast
amount of the best expert testimony obtain
able in the country.
GI'ITEAU'S SPEEOH.
As soon as the court formally opened Gui
teau addressed the court in a rather imperious
toue as follows. "May it please your honor,
theAmeiicau people do not de3ire that this
case shall be tried again, and I do not desire
it. I say with the most respect to this court
and jury, and my counsel, (Seoville) 1 that I am
not satisfied with the political situation as de
veloped here in this case. That is the gist of
this "alleged offence. The president of the
United States would never have been shot
if it had not been for the
political situation which existed last June,
and I say I have the right as a matter of law,
appearing as my own counsel, and ask your
honor that Gen. Grant, Senators Conklingand
Platt, and President Arthur, and those kind of
men who who were so down upon Garfield
that they would not speak to him on the street,
and would not go to the white house, shall
lie put on the stand. I have a right to show
my personal relation to those greeting, that
I was cordially received by them, and that I
was well-dressed and well-fed at fhe Fifth Ave
nue hotel. I want to show my personal rela
tions to to those mc-n. I don't want to except
to your honor's ruling, but I shall be obliged
to do so, and I have no doubt the court in
bane will give me a new trial. "'
Judge Cox— "Your exception has l>een no
ted."
Scoville then called up the subject of President
Arthur's testimony, and said he had not yet
received any response to his interrogatories,
aod that the president's evidence was abso
lutely essential to the defense.
Gniteau interrupted him, excitedly, with:
"I don't think it at all necessary for President
Arthur to be here." To Scoville: "I don't
care who you want. I'm doing this mjself.
I ask it as a personal favor that he shan't be
dragged into court He is president of the
I'nited States, and I don't think he should be
bothered with this matter (striking the desk
violently) he is president of the United States,
and I made him so, and I think I should have
something to say in this matter."
It was arranged with Seoville that his au
swers should be put in as evidence at any
stage of the trial and Scoville called
GEN. W. T. SHERMAN.
WitEC3B simply recited the orders he had
issued for thr disposition of troops at the
time of the assassination. He identified the
letter written by Guiteau, and said he sus
pected at the time that there might be a con
spiracy, but afterwards concluded that the
shooting was the act of one man. As he If ft the
stand Guiteau said:
I thank you, general, for having ordered out
these troops that day. If it hadn't been for
you I should'nt be * here to-day. I owe my
life to the ■ protection which you and Mr.
Crocker gave me during that period, when
mob spirit was rife. At this the general
smiled grimly.
E. P. tfarton, a lawyer, A. L. Green and G.
W. Londy.all of Freeport, 111., ttstifled they
knew the Guiteau family ,and considered them
all sane.
Dr. D. 11. Buckley, of Freeport, testified that
he was J. W. Guiteau's family physician and
never saw any insanity or the slightest mental
ilerargement in him nor Abram Guileau.
Col. Corkhill (aside, but quite audibly) —
"Nor any one else."
Scoville — "Are you testifying?"
Corkhill— "l only wish I could."
Scoville— <i Well, go op the stand then and
testify. Don't set there and talk to the jury."
Witness was asked if he ever heard L. W.
Guiteau assert he could heal diseases by
prayer.
Guiteau (excitedly)— "He only talked that
in his family. He didn't go round the streets
to preach it, like an idiot or a jackass. He
had too much sense for that."
Witness had never heard any such claim on
the part of L. W. Guileau. He was asked if
he knew Dr. North. (Dr. North was the most
positive witness introduced by the defense,
and by his showing the entire Guiteau family
were more or less insane.) Witness replied he
knew him in Freeport.
Guitean— "The fact of the matter is, my
father used money which should have sent
me to coliege in supporting that Dr. North
and his family on my father's farm at Free
port."
Col. Corkhill-^"That's just my opinion of
Dr. North."
Pending cross-examinntion, John W. Gui
teau, brother of the prisoner, arose and pro
tested against the manner in which the name
of his half sister, Flora W. Guiteau, had been
mentioned. He desired that witness should
state exactly the infirmity under which 6he
labored.
Col. Corkhill thought the request a most
proper one. He had received a letter from
the young lady, who had been twenty-four
years unmarried, aad against whom ho word
of reproach had ever been uttered. Ghe had
felt very keenly the intimations that had been
made upon the stand by the defense, that "she
had been sent to St. Louis for treatment in
anticipation of her becoming insane.
Witness stated that the yonng lady in ques
tion suffered from an affection on her eyes,
and was sent to St. Louis for t-ieatment of her
eyes.
Guiteau, turning angrily to his brother,
whispered: "What do you want to make
suck a fuss about that for?" Then aloud,
"I'm sorry that my half sister's name has to
be dragged in here. She is a very fine person
so far as I know, and I send her greeting.
Mrs. Scoville, setting on the other side of
J. W. Guileau, was greatly excited, and au
grily accused her brother of trying to injure
their case.
Mr. Atkins, of the Freeport Republican,
confirmed the testimony of the previous wit
nesses as to the sanity of the various mem
bers of the Guiteau family. Witness was
asked if he knew Dr. North, and replied, "yes,
I know him as a Methodist minister, and I
know the cause of his dismissal."
Col. Corkhill — "Well, what were the
causes ?"
Witness— "He was dismissed for lascivious
conduct."
•AUTOGRAPHS.
On conclusion of examination of this wit-
ness, just before recess, some one in the audi
ence behind Guiteau made a reqaest for his
autograph. Guiteau wrote it with a flourish,
and as he tore off the slip, said: "I want to
call attention to this autograph business. A
great many persons want my autograph, and
1 give them, but there is no vanity about me
or egotism. I notice the newspapers are tak
ing it up again."
J. S. Cochrane, lawyer, who had resided in
Freeport since 1858, testified that he never saw
any evidences of insanity in any member of the
Guiteau family. Witness was about to leave
the stand, when Guiteau said to him: "Hold
on. Don't you know his active support of
the Oneida community? Haven't you heard
him describe free-loveism, Noyesism, and all
that? Don't you know he was the laughing
Daily
stock of all Freeport for twenty-five years, for
his crank ideas?"
Scoville, whispering to Guiteau, tried to re
strain him, but he shouted at him; you keep
quiet. I'm doing this. Don't you know
enough to keep still when I am questioning
witness?' 1 Then, with a move of his hand,
"go on Mr. Witness. Answer those questions
separately."
Witness was told he might answer, and re
plied: "Iknowiust the reverse to be the
case."
Guiteau— "Well, that was a fact anyway.
We don t want any more of this kind of evi
dence. These people don't know anything
about my father's social life and character.
There's no controversy about his business
character.
Geo. W. Oyler, justice of the peace, said he
lived in Freeport since in 1848, and never saw
indications of insanity in any of the Guiteau
family. Witness was asked if he knew a man
by the name of Amerling, who had testified
for the defense. Seoville somewnat excitedly
protested against the unfairness of the prose
cuting attorney in making a covert attack on
Amerling, as he had done in the examination
of several witnesses. Guiteau shouted "It
only shows the bad breeding of the man."
Anson G. Babcock, a farmer, had known L.
W. Guiteau since 1840, and never saw any in
dications of insanity in him. Never regarded
any of the family of unsound mind.
D. H. Sanderland ksew L. W. Guiteau for
thirty-six years, and never saw anything to in
dicate that he was of unsound mind in any
way or in any degree. From his knowledge
and acquaintance with members of the Gui
teau family, including the prisoner, witness
had never suspected there was insanity in the
family.
Guiteau had for some minutes beenreading
the president's message, and suddenly inter
rupted the court proceedings to express his
opinion upon the document. "I'm glad,'
said the prisoner "that President Arthur has
given those miserable Mormons such a slap.
I hope he will keep at them. It is a good
message. It has got the right ring to it. Ar
thur is doing well, and he is going to give us
the best administration we ever had."
Horace Taylor, of Freeport, was well ac
quainted with the prisoner's faiher. He had
as good a head as any man in the state, and
(after a siight pause) he was the third smartest
man in the country."
"Who was first?" quickly asked Gniteau.
Answer— "Mr. Bweet."
Guitean— "Who was second?"
Answer— "Mr. Turner."
"Well," said Guiteau. with a broad smile of
satisfaction, "as they have both been dead a
great many years, my father was ahead.'.'
Guiteau was about" to interject another little
speech when Scoville endeavored to stop him,
and was told, "don't be punching me under
the table, olease, when I want to speak;" and
after a short pause: "I tell you what it is,
Scoville, you have got to abandon your
theory, that's all there is about that. He was
a smart man and everybody knew it, only he
was badly cracked on religion." Adjourned.
TRIAL GOSSIP.
The fact that only a few of the twenty or
thirty experts summoned for defense gave
their testimony excites interest, and it is said
nearly all them came to the conclusion they
could do Guiteau no good by their testimony.
A few experts had an interview with Guiteau
Monday afternoon, but none of them appeared
yesterday on the witness stand. The prisoner
stated that the experts requested him to take
some medicine before making the examina
tion, but he declined. They talked with him
an hour aud a half, examined his eyes, feet and
pulse, and then left.
District Attorney Corkhill is quoted as ex
pressing his belief that the trial will not last
more than a week longer.
John W. Guiteau is quoted to the effect that
so far as he is concerned the question of the
jurisdiction 6"f this court would not be raised
until the jury returned a palpably unfair ver
dict.
Guitean had many visitors at the jail yester
day. He was very cheerful.
guiteau's early plan.
Chicago, Dec. 7. — It is said that over two
years ago Guiteau told H. B. Porter, of 99
State street, this city, that he intended to go
to Washington and create a stir which would
make his name famous all over the world.
Porter to-day told a reporter he had met
Guiteau casually for several years, but
he had passed from his memory
until the assassination of Garfield recalled
himto mind. Mr. Porter said he told his
story first to Edward Isham, former partner of
Secretary Lincoln, but did not know what
use had been made of it. Porter refused
to make any further revealation of
his knowledge about Guiteau than to say that
what he knew would help hang the crittur.
He did not desire to be called as a witness, for
he could not afford to leave his business here.
THE VILLAIN DENOUNCED.
Los Angels, Dec. 7.— The Daily Times this
afternoon contained an interview with James
W. Scoville, of Chicago, cousin of Guiteau's
counsel, who is at present visiting in this city.
Mr. Scoville gave an interesting account of a
personal experience of many years
with the assassin, and described him
as cold-blooded, selfish and thoroughly
disreputable, with no other aim in life than to
become notorious. He expresses himself
very strongly on the subject of Guiteau's in
sanity, saying he was perfectly sane and has
always been so. Mr. Scoville condemns his
cousin, George Scoville, and says he desires
vindication of law in speedy hanging of the
assassin.
T»"» Molly Magulren
Pittsburgh, Dec. 7.— A special from Union
town, Pa., says the trial of Pat Dorn, one of
the Molly Maguires charged with the murder
of Maurica Healy, is creating intense interest.
The courthouse was crowded to-day. A num
ber of witnesses were examined, but the only
important testimony elicited was that of Mrs.
Harper, who swore that from her window she
saw three men walking along the track just
before the shooting. One of them she recog
nized as Healy. Much other testimony was
given regarding the defendants' wherabonts
on the night of the murder.
A Stormy Passage.
New York, Dec. 7.— The steamer Lake
Winnipeg, from Liverpool, reports November
21 a heavy gale and high seas, and on the 23d
a hurricane, the vessel shipping large quanti
ties of water and doing much damage. Jas.
Blair, chief engineer, was washed overboard
and lost. Patrick Mooney, fireman, was
thrown in a state hole and killed. John Reyn
i Ids, fireman, died, haying drank carbolic
acid, mistaking it for vinegar.
Wrecked In a Gale.
Cleveland, Dee. 7.— The three-masted
schooners, H. P. Baldwin, Capt. Cassidy, and
Cosack, Capt. Bell, went' ashore here this
morning in a furious southwest gale. The
crew were saved by the life saving service.
Both vessels are laden from Eseonubo for
Cleveland. The Baldwin lies on a rock and is
pounding to pieces. Value $12,000; no insur
ance. Owned by Patrick Smith & Son, of
Cleveland. The Cosack is scuttled and lies
comparatively easy on the sand. Owned by
Capt. Grummond, of Detroit, and valued at
$16,000. The wind is still blowing a hurri
cane. •
The Father McCarthy Murder.
Greenfield, Mass. , Dec. 7. — David Mc-
Millan, who shot Father McCarthy, reached
here last evening, and was rapidly taken to
prison. The yard was crowded with people
anxious to lynch the prisoner, but the dis
play of revolvers by the officers prevented vio
lence. Father McCarthy died about midnight,
but before his death he made a dying declara
tion as to the circumstances of the assault.

HOUSE CHAIRMANSHIPS.
Speaker Keifer and his advisers have been at
work tonight on the arrangement of com
mittees, which are to be announced next
Tuesday. The chairmanships/so far agreed
upon to-night, are as follows (according to
a statment of one of Keifer's staunchest
friends, and a man whom the speaker has
freely consulted): Foreign affairs, Robinson;
ways and means, Kelly; judiciary,
Crowley of New York; elections, Colkins;
publications, Belford; territories, Page. The
appropnaiions committee will be given to
Hiscock or Kosson. Disposing of the chair
manships is very difficult in some cases.
Several members want the same committee,
and though the speaker expects to have his
ready by next Tuesday, s me doubt if he can
complete them by that time.
Frost, of Missouri, is fighting for amend
ment to the rules that will permit the
craation of a special committee on
the- Mississippi river improvement. It is
threatened that the speaker will decide against
the amendment on point of order, but that
there will be a strong point for this committee,
as Western members believe they could accom
plish more for river improvement through a
committee created for that purpose.
It is generally agreed among the Western
senators and representatives that very little will
be done toward filling the Western federal
appointments until the holiday recess comes.
Then members of congress will have time to
consider the appointments.
Gratiot, of Wisconsin, has been appointed
assistant superintendent of the document
room of the house, at $2,000 per year.
Secratary Blame has written a letter to the
Spanish government in relation to the claim
of Buzzi, for damages for the destruction
of his property in Cuba. Buzzi had his claim
before the Spanish commission consul, but
Consul Le wenlntupt decided against it. Buzzi
had been made a citizen of the United States
by the consul of Baltimore. Blame claimed
that Lewenhaupt had no power to go behind
Buzzi's naturalization papers. Lewenhaupt
maintained that he was the arbitrator, and
this difference broke up the commission. In
his communication Blame has stated his posi
sion at length to the Spanish government.
VIRGINIA POLITICS.
Ex-Senator and Lieut. Gov.-elect Lewis, of
Virginia, has l>een in Washington two days,
consulting with Republicans in regard to the
condition of the senate in Virginia.
Mr. Lewis claims that prior to the
combination of Republicans and Readjustee,
Mahone and the Readjuster leaders promised
him the senatorship if he would join the
movement and they could make it succeed.
Lewis had an interview with the president this
afternoon, and his friends assert that the pres
ident positively and emphatically decided in
favor of Lewis' election to the senate. Accord
ing to a statement of Lewis' friend the presi
dent said: "I understand that a Republican
senator would be elected from Virginia if the
coalition succeeded. I think the Republicans
are entitled to that much." Louis has gone
to Richmond with authority to say to the Re
publican members of the legislature that the
president desires his election and* he believes
this will compel! his nomination
by the coalitionists. A readjuster,
member of the Virginia legislature,
named Moore, who declared for Riddelberger
for senator, is now here and says he will vote
for Lewis if the president wants Lewis elected.
Bout wcil, Dawes, Logan and many other
prominent Republicans assured Lewis of their
cordial support, and their willingness to aid
in making him senator. A coalition caucus
will be held on the 18th inst., and if Riddel
berger is nominated the Republican members
of the legislature may bolt.
TREASURY NOTES.
Secretary Folger received a telegram from
the assistant treasurer at New York this even
ing, stating he had received $15,000 of bonds
embraced in the 105 th call, but no uncalled
bonds had been presented under the authori
zation of the department to redeem $2,000,C00
of uncalled 4^ per ceut. bonds weekly.
There was received at the treasury depart
ment to-day $229,500 of 3m per cent, bonds
for redemption under the 105 th call, making
the total amount received to date $13,664,800.
Eugene G. Barnard, treasury clerk, charged
with illegally prosecuting a pension claim,
was held in $2,000 bail to await the action of
the grand jury.
THE UTE INDIANS.
The report of the uxe commissioners to the
secretary of the interior is very voluminous.
Among the most important recommendations
are that the present boundaries of the reser
vation be established permanently, and that
the few settlers now on the reservation be
paid a reasonable compensation for improve
ments; that the White River and Wintoh
tribes be consolidated, and that the properties
of the different bands assigned
by the recent agreement, be changed
with the consent of the Indians. They say
that supplies should be reduced gradually, to
induce the Indians to cultivate their lands,
finally withdrawing government aid altogether
when it can be done safely. Legislation or an
executive order is asked to protect the reser
vation from the inroads of white emigrants.
The commission say the number of Ute com
missioners can now be wisely reduced from
six to three.
GARFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.
Gen. Sherman and the executive committee
of the Garfield memorial hospital project have
received most encouraging reports from
abroad of the interest taken everywhere in the
enterprise. Committees are formed in many
of the principal cities of Europe, and even in
Cairo, Egypt, to collect moneys as testimoni
als of love and respect for the late president.
Assistant Postmaster General Hatton has
issued a circular letter to all postmasters, com
mending to their attention the objects
sought, and inviting, unofficially, co-opera
tion in their respective localities. Gen. Sher
man and Treasurer Gilfillen have addressed
letters on the subject to many prominent men
throughout the country and generous res
ponses are being daily received. In the mean
time Senator Windom has prepared a bill to
provide a special charter for the proposed
hospital, and this will make it a national or
ganization.

MRS. COLEMAX SENIENCED.
Four Tears for the Murder of Qeo. Coles.
[N. Y. Special Dec. 5.]
Mrs. Coleman, who has been on triu here
the past week for the murder of George Coles
at Miner's theatre, in the Bowery, some
months since, was brought before the court
to-day for sentence. She had been adjudged
guilty of manslaughter in the third
degree, and it was believed by many
that her sentence would be
made light. The court room was filled with
spectators, and there were present the prison
er's three children and her mother. Judge
Davis in passing sentence said in the course of
his remarks, after steadfastly regarding the
prisoner for fully five minutes: "It was when
your husband relied on you to guard his health
from a stain and his name from dishonor,
while he was threatened by dangers a seaman
alone can understand, that you did willfully
become attached to a stranger by ties which
belong to your husband alone. It is true,
temptations have pressed around you; that
you bad not seen your husband for some
time, but your children were sufficient to re
strain the animal in you from revolt. Your
case should show how dangerous it is for
mothers and daughters to frequent any place
of amusement without a proper escort. It
should warn them that at every corner there is
one individual in the class of libertines who
make virtue a mockery and honor a by-word.
Their business it is to prey upon woman's
virtue and to destroy the happiness of a life.
You are now a convict and .your husband is
heart-broken. You have had the benefit of
learned counsel and the attendance of kind
friends. You have the fact of yonr sex in your
favor. You have had many chances, and the
jury have dealt leniently with you.
Had you been a man and
killed a woman under the same
circumstances which you murdered George
Coles, I should have recommended the sever
est punishment of the law. A citizen of this
country, and who is amenable to the laws of
the land, has no right nndfr any circumstances
or surroundings to avenge himself or herself
upon their cause of aggrievance." The judge
then sentenced the woman to four years' im
prisonment in the state prison.
At these words the prisoner, who had cried as
the judge addressed her, utttered a shriek,
and exclaiming "O my God !'' fell back in her
chair and would have fallen to the floor had
she not been supported. She was carried from
the room seemingly insensible. The sentenc
was the extreme penalty possible under th
verdict.
$5,000 Damages for False Accusation.
Messrs. W. W. Erwin and W. B. McGrorty
were engaged yesterday in preparing papers in
a suit to be begun by Thomas C. Connors
against T. C. Nichols of the Pioneer Press*
for $5,000 damages for malicious libel. Con
nors was a brakeman on the St. Paul & Omaha
road running between St. Paul and Black Riv
er Falls, Wis. Nichols is traveling for the P.
P., and he accused Connors of stealing papers
in transit in the baggage car, and on this ac
cusation, Assistant Superintendent Spencer
discharged him. Connors claims that Nich
ols wanted to search his car and he refused to
allow it, whereupon he reported it and secured
his discharge. It is understood Nichols was
acting under instructions from the Pioneer
Press and that institution is the real party in
the matter, though the snit runs against
Nichols personally.
Suit for Damages.
A. J. Van Alstier by his attorneys, O'Brien
& Wilson, yesterday began suit in the district
court against the city of St. Paul for damages
in the sum of $10,350, for injuries sustained
by falling into a hole in the sidewalk on the
west side of Cedar street, at a point between
Seventh and Ninth streets, on the night of
May 1, last. This complaint alleges that the
defendant allowed a large portion jof the side
walk to be torn up at that point leaving an
excavation unguarded by lights or signals
The plaintiff says he is a mechanic and able
when well to earn $3 per day. By reason of
said injuries he has already lost fifty-two
working days to his damage or the sum of
$156, and he will be prevented from resuming
his employment for one year to
h l B.no«amage8 .no« amage in the further sum
of $936, and that he has incurred bills for
medicines and medical attendance of $258.

A FURIOUS FIEND.
Trial of the Murderer of Mrs. Crane, In
New York -He Gloats over Hla Crime,
and Wanto to Be Hang.
New Yobk, Dec. 7.— ln the trial to-day
of Wm. Lindram for the murder of h s land
lady, Mrs. Crane, Adolph Lindrum, brother
of the prisoner, identified some letters vritten
by him. In a letter to the husband of deceased
Lindram writes that he was overcon c with
grief at hearing of Mrs. Crane's death, md for
not being able to attend her funeral or send
her flowers, saying: "Circumstanced over
which I had no control, being
confined in the tombs, preventing n c from
doing one or the other. " He hopes, h< wever ,
that she had a fashionable funeral, ani then
inquires if her carcass was dumped in a hole
on Harp island. He then ask«d Mr. Crane,
who is his housekeeper now, and who stuffs
the geese, He knew nothing about dc ing the
latter, but he knew lead was very j;ood to
stuff she-devils with. He only put a little
into Mrs. Crane, but it took all the devil
ishness out of her. He avers he wait
glad he shot her, and would lo so
again ir he had the chance. He is not afraid
or being hanged, as "hanging is about
played out," but if hanged he would onl y suffer
a few moments, while Mrs. Crane lingered five
months. In a letter to the district attorney
the prisoner refuses to plead insanit r as ad
vised by hia counsel, saying that he prefers
hanging to a long imprisonment. 01 insan
ity he says: "This is a plea that is generally
made use of in defense of assassins, like
Guiteau, for instance, in whose defense nothing
can be said but that they are crazy. Guiteau
is trying his beat to make the world be ieve he
is insane." It another letter the prisoner ad
mits the shooting, saying that after l.c shot
and missed her, he knew he was liah c to be
sent to the penitentiary, and he fired a 6t cond in
order to make her suffer as well as himself.
If his bullet had killed her at once he says he
would have long ago joined Cox and Italbo in
heaven, where all murderers go. The reading
of the letters stirred up a deep feelin | of in
dignation against the prisoner in cour ..
Characteristic.
The suit of the Merchants' Nation; .1 bank
against the stockholders of the St. Paul Boom
company, to recover $2,300, was on triul in the
district court yesterday. It was amusing to
see the Minneapolis stockholders,
or those who had agreed to take
stock, try to squirm out of it.
Messrs Leigh ton, Moore, Geo. W. Turner,
H. H. Davis, Mayo and O. B. Sturtevant, tes
tified that they signed for the stock, but did
so with the idea that it was to be a Mi meapo
lis institution and controlled there. They
averred that Platt B. Walker had told ibem it
would be controlled in Minneapolis or they
would not have agreed to take stock. When
they found that there was danger of St. Paul
receiving some advantage from it, they kicked
bard and refused to pay and never have paid
for the subscribed stock. This is simply in
accord with the atmosphere ten niilee above
St. Paul. It's a peculiar climate up there.
