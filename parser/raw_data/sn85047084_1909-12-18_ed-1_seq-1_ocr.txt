AMENDMENT BILL IN HOUSE
Satisfactory Meeting With Taft
and Ballir.ger Waiting
for Delegate.
By Ernest G. Walker.
(Mail Special to The Advertiser.)
WASHINGTON, December 6. Gov
ernor Frear arrived" here yesterday and
today .entered upon the work which he
mapped out as the object of his long
trip from Honolulu to Washington. He
spent a part of today at the Capitol,
where he met a number of old friends
in senate and house. Attorneys Hem
nway and Withington were there also
to witness the opening of the session
of congress, and the three lunched to
gether at the senate restaurant. The
Governor came to Washington by way
of New York, where he tarried for a
number ' 'ays.
This afternoon Governor Frear men
tioned his visit to Andrew Carnegie as
one of the very satisfactory events of
bis trip to the big city. The Governor
learned soon after his arrival in New
York that Mr. Carnegie had decided to
give Honolulu a $100,000 public li--biary.
A, letter -written by the -Go.v-.
ernor some rime ago had been received
by Mr. Carnegie on .his return from.
.abroad aud informed him that Hono
lulu had complied with conditions he
imposed, such as provision by the legis
lature for the maintenance of the li
brary and the merging of the local
subscription library with the new insti
tution. Mr. Carnegie had already re
plied to that letter before the Governor
called upon him, but they had a very
jueasant talk o about an hour never
theless. ' -.'
Advising Architects. .
Governor Frear said that natural'y
no further steps had been taken toward
.the construction of the building or the
preparation of designs, but that will
come later in due course. While in
New York he saw members of the firm
of architects of York & Sawyer, who
Lave been commissioned to prepare the
plans for the Honolulu public building,
and incidentally suggested to them that
there might be opportunities for ob
taining . further commissions should a
representative of the firm go to Hono
lulu, as the treasury department ex
pects will be done. The Governor al
luded to the fact that a new public li
brary was to be erected, as well as a
new'Y. M. C, A. building, probably a
new chamber of commerce, and so on.
Public Building Plans.
The plans for the Honolulu building,
as approved by Assistant Secretary of.
the Treasury Hilles, Secretary Mac
Yeagh, Secretary of the Interior Bal
linger, and Postmaster-General Hitch
cock were shown the Governor in New
York. He regards these plans as very
satisfactory. Some changes have been
agreed upon, such as postoffice boxes
on the outside of the building and sep
arate quarters for the marine hospital
service, which will preclude the possi
bility' of contagion to persons coming
to other parts of the building. The
building material will probably be con
crete. Bond Refunding.
While in New York the Governor
taiked with various financial firms in
the Wall Street district about the pro
posed refunding of $2,000,000 of ter
ritoiial bonds. He gained a deal of
valuable information, he said this af
ternoon, about acceptable methods of
issuing such securities so that they
would find the most ready market. The
Governor believes that New York firms
will be glad to buy large blocks of the
new securities. One firm, that handled
a previous issue of territorial bonds,
expressed a willingness to handle the
entire ret'nniling issue.
Chat With Taft.
Governor Frear expects to have a
talk soon with President Taft about
Hawaiian matters. His call this morn
ing upon Secretary of the Interior Bel
linger was very pleasant. The secre
tary made an appointment for a later
day. when they can have a general talk
about Hawaiian matters. He also saw
Assistant Secretary of the Interior
Wilson, who was at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific
Exposition. During the after
lioon the Governor went to the Supreme
Court, where he moved the admission of
A.F. .Indd .f Honolulu to practise there
and listened to the argument of the
ase of the Hawaiian Evangelical As
sociation against the Territory of Ha
waii to recover 1 5,000.
The Governor has not formulated yet
bis plans for remaining in Washington.
"He remarked that the amendments to

A. G. M. Robertson States That

CRITICISM NOT INOPPORTUNE
Calls the Present Row "Tempest
in a Teapot," and of No
Importance.
Editor Advertiser: When the last
congressional party was here the hope
was expressed, not only by the visitors
but by our business men and by Re
publicans generally, that Kuhio would
again be the Republican nominee for
delegate to congress. When Kuhio fin
ally declared that 'he would be a candi
date for the nomination next year the
announcement was hailed with much
satisfaction, and it was accepted as a
foregone conclusion that he would be
reelected. At that time The Adver
tiser reported that "The announcement
has been received with a great amount
of pleasure by Republicans, by the in
dependents among the business men
and by the citizens generally." The
Advertiser in a previous issue had said,
"It is to be hoped that Kuhio will see
his way clear to make the announce
ment desired by his friends. The reiter
ated advice of the visiting congressmen
that Kuhio should be returned to Wash
ington to carry out the work he has so
successfully commenced has confirmed
the reports that have otherwise come
back from the Capital concerning the
Delegate and his work. This Territory
at this formative period needs Kuhio
at Washington."
Now you say that Kuhio has "cut
the ties of party allegiance," and has
"disassociated himself from the par
ty, ' ' also that ' he should be disciplin
ed." The charge against Kuhio seems to
Jbe that he has in a reprehensible man
ner and at an inopportune time criti
cized the land policy of the Republican
administration.
That the administration of the pub
lie lands of this Territory' has long
been open to criticism could be easily
proven by reference to the files .of The
Advertiser, and 1 venture to say that
Governor Frear, if he were here, would
readily concede it. I have not heard
anyone deny it. So far as any such
criticism is concerned Kuhio has voiced
nothing new, and his .position in that
respect, as well as the Governor's, was
well known to all those Who took part
in the conferences on the land bill over
which the Governor presided. For Ku
hio to forcibly remind the party that
something ought, if possible, be done
by way of remedying the situation be
fore the next election, and to bring
the matter to "public attention before
his departure for Washington, can not
justly be said to be inopportune. It is
nonsense to contend that a Republican
lesder can not criticize a Republican
administration without "disassociat

Honolulu - Bound Tourists Told
That Island Tickets Are
Unavailable.
The only assurance that tourists,
heading for Hawaii, have of getting
here on the big transpacific liners, is
tUat they can get. accommodations only
on the Pacific Mail steamship Mongo
lia, sailing December 21 from San
Francisco. That vessel appears to be
the only one which has had any va
cancies at all that can be obtined by
Honolulu-bound passengers.
General Agent Kerrell of the Pacific
Mail company, in- nearly all letters
sent out to inquiring persons who ask
for the prospect of getting accommo
dations to Honolulu, states that "all
other steamers (other than the Mongo
lia) are booked up full for many
weeks to come, and accommodations
are aeeordinglv not available."

MAY VOTE TICKET,
BUT NOT HEAD IT
"We don't want Prince Cupid," said
a Democratic member of the legislature
last night. "Of course, he is welcome
to vote the Democratic ticket, we have
no objection to that. But if he thinks
he is going to coine in with us anu
head our ticket, he is badly mistaken.
We don't need him; we have leaders
of our own and we are not going to
sidetrack them to make room for Cupid.
"And if Cupid thinks he is going
to start a new party and get any Demo
cratic votes to help him out. he is bad
ly mistaken. He is about as far off
as our sorehead Democrat from Hilo,
Ryan. He can't run the Democratic
party. No. sir. We can take care of
ourselves without anv assistance from
Kuhio."
QUEER'S LAWYER
WILL BE BALLQU
He Will Represent Her Before
the Court of Claims at the
National Capital.
Before the court of claims at Wash
ington, ex-Queen Liliuokalani 's claim
for a portion of the revenues from the
crown lands of Hawaii, after the over
throw of the monarchy in 1S93, will be
presented early in the coming year,
and possibly by Judge S. M. Ballou of
the law firm of Kinney, Ballou, Pros
ser & Anderson. "
The Queen is now en route to Wash
ington, accompanied by her private
secretary, J. D. Aimoku. As usual,
she will make an appeal to the federal
government for reimbursement, but
this time the claim will be presented
with all due formality, under legal
procedure. It is believed here "That
the Queen has a better chance for rec
ognition by this congress than by any
other, although the ultimatum has been
issued by cabinet heads that curtail
ment of expenses and appropriations
must be made this eoming year. .
It is believed that the Queen's
claim will be for a sum amounting to
about $400,000. All congressmen who
came here this year, as well as those
who were here two years ago as guests
of the Territory, are in favor of the
queen's claim, and if presented in a
manner which will be reasonable, it is
believed that proper steps may be
taken to grant her request.

OPPOSITION TO
PORTO RICANS
IS RAISED
If the planters' association are de
termined to carry out their reported
Lintention of importing more Porto
Rican laborers,, the members will find
that mueh opposition will probably de
velop in Hawaii. One of those who
promises to lead a campaign against
"the movement is, ex-Governor Cleg
horn, who has strong ideas on the
subject. -
"I think it would be an outrage on
this community to bring more Porto
Ricans here," he said yesterday. 1 "I
for one will oppose such a thing as
strongly as I am able. If necessary, I
will appeal to Washington to put a
stop to it. I would rather see the
plantations go to ruin than to have
Hawaii infested with any more of the
class of people the other importations
of Porto Ricans proved them to be."
Other expressions of disapproval,
less vigorously expressed, were heard
yesterday. Nc one in authority among
the planters' association members de-j

to Porto Rico, ror did anyone confirm
the report. ,

WILDER'S RESIGNATION
HAS BEEN ACCEPTED
WASHINGTON, D. C December 17, 1909. Hon. A. A. Wilder, Honolulu:
Your telegram of December 15 received and resignation as Associate Justice
Supreme Court of Hawaii is hereby accepted to take effect immediately.
WM. H. TAFT.
A. A. Wilder is no longer a member of the territorial supreme bench. The
justice yesterday morning received the above cablegram from Washington, in
forming him that his resignation bad. been accepted.
There was considerable speculation yesterday regarding Justice Wilder'
j probable successor. It is thought not unlikely that the President may be con
ferring with Governor Frear regarding the appointment of a man to fill the
I vacancy.
Ml THRONES
IN THE CAPITOL
Conflicting Claims to Rulership
Causes Ruction and Two
I Courts Are Held.
Although the Territory didn't know
it, it yesterday faced one of the great
est crises in its history. Only the kind
intervention of Fate saved its politi
cal system from total destruction. It
all arose through Acting-Governor
Mott-Smith developing an indisposi
tion. When he left his office yesterday
morning to return home and attempt
to recover his lost equilibrium, Claud
ius II. MeBride, private secretary to a
prodigal Governor, understood that in
structions had been left which made
hiim the Acting Acting-Governor. He
alleges that he was told by Mr. Mott
Smith to take care of the office.
The real Acting-Governor had no
sooner disappeared over the horizon
when a rival warwhoop sounded from
the other side of the hall, and Acting
Attorney-General Andrews stuck his
head out and surveyed the scenery.
Failing to discover any substitute for
a chief executive, he climbed up on
what he considered his rights and rode
over to the Governor's sanctuary.
There he discovered MeBride in the
softest chair, with his feet on a pile
of correspondence and a chief execu
tive cigar stuck in an aperture of his
fade at an rgie of forty-five degrees
with the horizontal.
Andrews' outraged feelings found
veut in a low growl which caused Me
Bride 's back hair to bristle up and
float on the trade winds that were
eoming in through the open window.
With the whole force of his legal
training and the authority of his office,
Andrews settled down to prove to the
secretary that according to every law
of, man -and -God he was the Acting
Governor pending the rearrival of Mr.
Mott-Smith; as in his capacity as attorney-general
he was in line to -the
throne by divine right,; MeBride, how
ever, requires more than law to de
prive him of his rights and quoted
Shakespeare and Mott-Smith by the
yard, in which he made it appear that
somebody had given the attorney-general
a bum steer, and until the right
ful claimant, came back he was going
to hold the official lid.
Arbitration failing to result in any
thing definite, Andrews returned to his
own sanctum and opened a rival court;
and so matters stood the entire after
noon. When interviewed late yester
dav as to the situation, Mr. MeBride
said:
"We are rivals. We are opening all
the Governors mail and Jie is waiting
for something weighty to come up that
he can decide Nothing has as yet
come in, as Treasurer Conkling has not
yet turned in his resignation."
