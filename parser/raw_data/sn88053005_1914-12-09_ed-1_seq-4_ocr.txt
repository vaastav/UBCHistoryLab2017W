TO THE REPUBLICAN OFFICE- !
HOLDERS
I be
The following editorial is clipped The
from the Evening Journal, issue of be
December 8 : day.
The Evening Journal is a Repub- check
lican newspaper, but it is not a
party organ. see
There is no Republican in our
State who is too small to receive who
praise from it for any act that is check
promotive of public good.
There is no Republican in our ers
State who is too large to receive j
public censure from it for any act | and
that is productive of public harm, j cion
We take the stand that a Repub- of
lican who is elected to office has j for
three important duties to perform, and
The first is to commit no official
act that will be injurious to the ary
public. make
The second is to commit no offi- the
cial act that will bring discredit to i
the party that has honored him. cal
The third is to commit no official !
act that will stultify him as an in
dividual in the eyes of the people. J
When any Republican office-j
holder does violence to any of those j "
duties, we believe we perform a I the
valuable service to the public and I fi
to the party by calling attention to I
the fact and demanding that, for j
the sake of the public and the j
party, he repair, so far as it may rl p
be possible, whatever harm he lias "'
done, and refrain from future dis- !
creditable acts. [, ^
The very least that can be done |* U!V
by a man who has been elected to | U P
office by the Republican party is to ! * Ion
be honest. The very best that can !
be done by him is not only to be ! ^
honest but also to be constructively i tlon
and obstructively useful. In other ou ^
words, to construct the good and f "?
to obstruct the bad things in pub- a "
jj e jj£ e ment
Above all other things, a Repub
lican who has been honored by his P
party should live up to the pledges i
that his part v organization made ;
' not
would
to the people as an act precedent
to his election. As a public official
such a Republican is the repository I
of the good faith of his party. It
is his duty to be true to that trust. ;
Such thoughts are aroused by
the fact that the new year is rap-(sewer
idly approaching; that a new Leg- j ports,
islature controlled by Republicans, j has
soon will assemble in Dover, and j for
that a new Levy Court, controlled :
by Republicans, soon will assemble | stand
in this city.
Republican members-elect of the i
j by
Legislature must bear in mind that
the Republican party has promis- ( the
ed that the forthcoming legislative ence
session shall be short and that its ; other
predominant characteristics shall |
be the intelligent and business-like ; with
dispatch of the people's affairs. It been
is the duty of those members to en- (
able the Republican party to live
up to that pledge. They should go ing
to Dover fully determined that the SO
session shall not exceed beyond the the
sixty-day limit and that it shall be
made even shorter if business pru- ;
dence should seem to warrant it. j
With no extraordinary event, like
the election of a United States Sen
a tor, to disturb the course of gen
eral legislative business, the Repub
lican majority can offer no accept
able excuse for a prolonged session.
Nor can it shift the responsibility
for such a session to the Democra
tic minority. The Republican ma-jcide,
jority will have the power to decide ,
when the session shall end. There
can be no division of responsibility 1 it
if it fail to end within a reasonable !
right
clear
time.
Bo much for the Legislature. !
Now for the New Castle County I
Levy Court. Through it the Re
publican party organization has j tasks
promised to give to the taxpayers a ( the
clean honest, economical and husi- j war.
ness-like administration of every!
Republican member of that court I
to do his utmost to enable the party J
to keep that promise. There must duty.
be no violating or stretching of the
law for the benefit of anybody, of
The good name and fair fame of
the party are of infinitely greater
importance than is tne pecuniary
interest of any man in the county.
If, in the past, there have been any
allowances of county funds for in
creased salaries or other purposes,
it is the duty of the commissioners
to let it be known at the very out
set of their new administration that
there will be no more of such things
They should live within the law and

them to live within it so far as it

!
Further than that, there should
I be no star-chamber proceedings.
The business of the county should
be transacted in the broad light of
day. Each bill passed and each
check drawn should be open to the
inspection of anyone who wishes to
see it. No one who presents or
passes an honest bill and no one
who draws or signs an honest
check has anything to fear from
public scrutiny. Our commission
ers must bear in mind that public
j crookedness fattens upon darkness
| and secrecy and that public suspi
j cion always stands close to the door
of the star chamber. Therefore,
j for the sake of the public, the party
and themselves, the commissioners
should begin their work in Janu
ary with a firm determination to
make a record that will withstand
the most critical scrutiny of any
i taxpayer, no matter to what politi
cal party h emay belong.
