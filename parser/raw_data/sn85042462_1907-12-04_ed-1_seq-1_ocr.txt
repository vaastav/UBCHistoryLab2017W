Following Civic Architect Charles Mul

¦ecurp for Los Angeles the finest Union
tiepot in the west
. High Santa, Fe officials have already de
cided to appoint a cornralttoe of ten to sco

Pac'flc and ' Salt "iiako ''officials; will ndake
einiilar mover. :' " .'.',.. ¦." ¦¦''¦¦'*'-' '¦'
The now depots in St Louis, Boston and
Washington are striking examples of what
joint interests cau accomplish.' '• .:.¦.¦'.' "•*.
In Los 'Angeles such a realization will
bring about the widening of Fifth street
and the magniflcont vista which Architect
Robinson has 'suggested as possible and
advlsa bio between Central avenue and
Los Angeles street If all' railroads enter
ing and leaving' the Flower ' city would
combine their terminal - interests at the
present site of the old Arcade depot, i .
Chairman F. ,W. Blanoliard of the muni
cipal, art commission laid' the plan before
the city council yesterday, • and ; the Idea
not' only won tho commendation of that
body but "the : couucllmen immediately
named A. J. .Wallace, Walter Wren, R..W.

Time Opportune
'.'hoirmnn JHlanrhard told the councjl
that he had talked with Santa Fe officials
and they had told him the time was ripe
now. With the advent of the trolleys
competition Inside the city was such that
the big systems ought easily to agree on
a joint terminal project.
"1 frmnd the. Santa Fe officials quite
agreeable to the big depot Idea." said Mr.
Itlnnchard.
"The directors have named a committee
of ten to co-operatr with similar commit
te*-!4 from other roads.

today In both houses , : of , congress, and
practically' no business was attempted- by
either body beyond listening. to .the net

the K'Tston of each body, but. as tha read
ing progressed the attendance diminished
somewhat. • ": "• . ' ' ' .' - ;, • .
In tbe main, however, It was well filled
until the last sentences of the document

readers.

with printed ; copies and 'many of them

'P"J>; ." Cannon Names Commiteea
Tn th« house today Speaker Cannon an
nounced the appointment of the commit
tee on banking and cu/roncy. and in do
ing go stated that ho had exceeded by
one member the number permitted by the
rules of tho houso and asked unanimous
consent to hi* action, which was granted.
The committee retains as Its chairman
Mr. Fowler of New Jersey, and in the
main Its personnel was unchanged. There
were only two vacancies on the commit
tee an ft stood last year, one of these
caused ">y th*; failure of Mr. fcharte:. Re
publican, of Missouri to secure re-elec
tion, and the remainder by the voluntary
withdrawal of Mr. Leg-.ro of South Car
olina, who found th« duties pertaining
to his work on this committee to be in
conflict v.ith hi?, services on other com
mittees.
Mr. Burion. Republican, of Ohio was
designated tor Mr. Shartel's place and
Mr. Crawford of North Carolina for Mr
Legare's.
The additional selection was Mr. Me-
Henry. Demoorat, of Pennsylvania.
Following Is the total membership of the
committee as now constituted: Fowler of
New Jersey, chairman; Prince, Illinois:
Calderhead. Kansas; Powers. Maine: Mc-
Morran, Michigan; Weenie, Ohio; Mc-
Creary, Pennsylvania; Knowland, Cali
fornia: Waldo, New York; Hayes. Cali
fornia: Weeks. Massachusetts: Burton,
Ohio, all Republicans; Lewis, Georgia:
Pujo, Louisiana; Glass. Virginia: Gilles
ple, Texas; James. Kentucky; Crawford,
North Carolina; McHenry, Pennsylvania,
all Democrats.
The speaker explained that be had mads
the increase of the minority representation
In consideration of the views of Mr. Wil
Hams, the minority leador. Some time ago
Mr. Williams appealed to the speaker for
an Increase of the minority representation
on the committee. The friends ,of tha
speaker say that his action with respecv
to the committee on banking and currency
Is not to be taken rs an Indication that
the speaker will further comply with Mr.
Williams' wishes.
The main consideration In view by the
speaker in appointing tho committee on
banking and currency before man Ing any
other committees was to create a recep
tacle for an inpouring stream of letters
from all parts of the country to members
of congress urging lmmeclita? legislation
on finance. While tho naming of th»
banking committee on the second day of
the session does not mean necessarily
that any legislation will b? accomplished
this month, the speaker prepared prompt
ly for legislation !'• its initial stages by
naming the committee to which all finan
cial measures must be referred before
they can come up for discussion and
action on the floor of the house.
It Is now believed that all the commit
tees will be filled within the next ten
days.
A caucus of the Democratic members of
the house to consider a plan for forcing
the tariff question to the front during the
present session has been called by Chair
man Clayton for tomorrow evening?.
Tt Is generally believed that Mr. Hay of
Virginia will reoffer his resolution In
structing Democratic members to object
to such agreement on the floor of the
house unless the Republicans agree to
bring In a tariff bill.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 3,-Attorney Gen

pany on beef shipments from Kansas
City, Kas., to Europe.
Tho companies are making their light
on the ground that the Missouri court
./as without jurisdiction, and Mr. Bona-
Farto says that If the supreme court
should so hold, "then It will be necessary
for the government to Institute proceed

properties described In the indictments
were received by the railroads for trans

The statute of limitation will run

NOT GUILTY
SAYS JURY
COUNSEL FOR UNITED ROADS
ACQUITTED ,
Verdict Reached After Short Period of
Disagreement — First Trial Had
Resulted in Disagree.
ment
By Ansoclated Press.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3.-Tirey L.
Ford, general counsel of the United Rail
roads, was late toulght acquitted of the
charge of having bribed former Super
visor Jennings Phillips to vote for an
overhead trolley franchise.
The case went to the Jury at 6 o'clock
and the verdict was reached at 10:4<>,
reporting to the court, at 11:10 p. m. A
part of this time was consumed by the
Jury eating ainner.
On tho first ballot the jury stood nine
for acquittal and threu for cunvlctioii.
Several more ballotß changed it to elevcD
[ for acquittal and one for conviction.
Tho sixth ballot Was unanimous for ac
quittal.
This was Ford's second trial. In the
flrgt trial the jury was unable to agree
on a verdict. The present trial waa be
gun about seven weeks ago, but was
interrupted a month by a series of special
holidays called to protect the banks dur
ing the financial stringency. During all
tho holidays tho Jury was kept together
under the custody of deputy sheriffs,
Forr Chats with Friends
The defendant was not ordered into
custody by Judge Luwlor when the caso
was glvon to the jury, us Is usually
done, but waa ordered to be in court at
S:3O o'clock. The three hours were spent
by him in one of the rooms of the
Temple Sherlth Israel, ctrattlng with
friends.
At 10:40 word was received from iho
Fairmont hotel that the jury had reached
a verdict and would report In a few
minutes. Intense silence re(sned when
the twelve men nl«d into court. The
strain was visibly beginning to tell on t&e
defendant, as he riveted his eyes upon
the jury as if he would read his fate.
His counsel and friends were visibly
r. rvous aa.U affected when Foreman Jud
son handed the verdict to the clerk of
the court.
"Wo. the Jury, find the defendant. Tlrey
L. Ford, not guilty." read the c.-.rk.
A demonstration of applause from the
seventy-five or W0 spectators immedi
ately followed. Frlenos surrounded Ford
to offer their congratulations, and the
defendant, with tears in his eyes, and too
nrich affected by t!u- result to speak
clearly, stepped across the aisle, shook
hands with the jurymen and thanked
them tn a husky voice.
Calhoun Thanks Jury
Patrick Calhoun also asked to be taken '
to the members of the jury, and thanked '
them for their verdict.
Judge Lawlor thanked tho jury for its
service, and dismissed the men who for
seveu weeks have been away from their
homeß and business.
Mr. Ford made the following statement:
