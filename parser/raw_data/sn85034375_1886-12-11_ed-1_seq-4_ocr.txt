The organization of the farmers of the

at Greenville, Miss., marks a new
epoch in the history of planting in Mis

with reverses year alter year that were
enough to discourage the most hopeful,
and to break the strongest will. Profit

We think that after Cleveland had
taken a good square look atthegang r and
examined the style of some of their pa

prices that some of them take foreign
advertisements for, he would readily give
a number of them a free pass to the poor

more ai home and understand their
business better, than in a respectable
well-regulated printing office. Whoever
