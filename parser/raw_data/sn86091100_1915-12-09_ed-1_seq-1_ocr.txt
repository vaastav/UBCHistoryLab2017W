President Wilson delivered at a
Joint session of the senate and

Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress—Since 1

globe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere. has altered the whole face of
International affairs, und now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
The president tells how this country
practiced neutrality and declares that
he hopes that when the time comes

country will he of luflulte service. Re
ferring to Central and South American
problems, the president declares that
we should retain unabated the spirit
which has Inspired us throughout the
whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put Into words
by President Monroe.
We have been put to the test In the
case of Mexico, und we have stood the

her own hands. But we have at least
proved that we will not take advan

government of our own choosing. Lib

thing, to which no bounds can be set
and to which no bounds of a few

Every American who has drunk at

IDAHO COUNTY RREEDERS BUY
TWO CARS RECEIVED IN ORANGE
VILLE SUNDAY AND TAKEN TO
DIFFERENT SECTIONS—SOME
AWARDS TO IDAHO COUNTY
EXHIBITORS.
Two carloads of thoroughbred stock
arrived in Grangeville Sunday evening
and since Monday the various animals
have been taken to every part of the
county to build up the herds of Idaho
county stock. This includes horses,
cattle, and hogs and the purchasers re
side from Elk City to the Salmon and
Snake river country while some of tho
purchases go out on the pVairie.
Eigtheen thoroughbred, registered
* Shorthorn and Durham bulls were in
cluded in the shipment to Grangeville
and the same were purchased at the
livestock show at Lewiston last week.
This indicates a marked tendency in
every section of Idaho county, the
greatest agricultural and livestock
country in the United States, to raise
the best bred stock and there are
possibly more thoroughbreds running on
the open range with the herds than any
other locatlifcy in the northwest. Most
of the stockmen take the stand that
the best is none too good and their
position is verified when the market
returns come in. Among the purchases
noted at fhe show - are the following:
Shorthorns.

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economic Adjustments Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
The moral is that the states of Amer

erating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of Interest,
alike In matters political and In mat
ters economic. Is likely to give them a
new significance as factors In Interna

tory of the world. It presents them as
In a very deep and true sense a unit
In world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
and common ldealB. Separated, they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused polities of a world of hos
tile rivalries; united In spirit and pur
pose. they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This Is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire In It It is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and Independence
and liberty and mutual service.

justment is inevitable In the next gen
eration.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fall to per
ceive that their passion Is for peace,
their genius best displayed In the prnc
tlce of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent. They do not
se»k or desire war
of individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
censored thought that quickens 1L
Conquest and dominion are not In our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But Just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter tt may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We Insist
upon security In prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development
We do more than that. We demand It
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to the inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel It wher
ever there Is a people that tries to walk
In these difficult paths of Independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
: of liberty on this side the sea and have
j deemed It us Important that our nelgh
| hors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be; have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of Independent nations and
I political freemen.
j Out of such thoughts grow all onr
policies. We regard war merely as a
! means of asserting the rights of a peo
j pj e Qgainst aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dlcta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without We
will not maintain a standing army ex

Increase Standing Regular Force—Four
Hundred Thoueand Citizen 8oldiere.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might. If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
arm of their government, which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their Independence secure, and not
their own Independence merely, but
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common canse, should
they also be put in Jeopardy. They
murf be fitted to play the great role
In the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quail

George E. Erb Present in Behalf of
Governor at Association Meeting.
George E. J5rb of Lewiston was pres
eut at the meeting of the Northwest
Livestock Association held last Satur
day evening, being there as a represen
tative of Governor M. Alexander, who
upon invitation had delivered an ad
dress the proceeding Monday night. At
the banquet of the members of the as
sociation considerable was mentioned
by some present at the meeting con
cerning tho failure of the appropria
tion for the livestock show and tho
governor's veto of the same. In this
connection the statement of Mr. Erb
to the members of the association at
the election of the officers on Saturday
evening is very apt. As reported by
the Tribune it was as follows:
Mr. Erb said that before making the
announcement tb follow he desired to
be heard briefly on behalf of the gov
ernor—that he had sat and listened
throughout the evening to jibes and
sneers at the banquet directed at the
governor by peanut politicians; that
the governor has no apology to offer
for nay action, nor had the speaker any
apology to offer for him. "Governor
Alexander was elected," he said, "not
by' the people of Lewiston, Nez l'erce
any other loeal
county,
ity, hut by the people of Idaho, on a
platform wherein he explicity pledged
re.duotion of taxation in the greatest
possible measure and the passage of no
appropriation with his permission not
absolutely necessary to the state gov
nor
ernment. Governor Alexander has con
scientiously lived up to these promises
and had he not done so would not have
merited the respect of myself or any
other man in the hall. Governor Alex
ander is fully aware of conditions and
existing feeling in this community ami
as evidence that lie is a bigger man
than the speaker, he has authorized me
to make the announcement of a $50
contribution toward the expense of the
present show and $100 toward the ex
pense of the 1916 show.'
said he had intended to make other
announcements but under the circum
stances had nothing further to say.

Mr. Wyatt this fall fed a bunch of
steers from his large range holdings in
the Salmon and Snake river country in
the Pomeroy country and these were
sold recently at a large figure. Tha
consummation of the deal with Mr,
Jones will give Mr. Wyatt one of the
largest breeding herds in the section in
which he operates and in the north
west. As the stuff purchased is high
grade stock and as the stock Mr. Wyatt
has been breeding is high grade stock,
this means that the grade of cattle
marketed by him in the future will be

running on the range in the Salmon

and it seems to be the tendency anil
purpose of every large lireder there
to build up their herds by heading
them with thoroughbred hulls, and al
so by the addition of thoroughbred
females.

not having been determined. It hu»

suddenly becoming black in the face,
fell forward and passed away within a
minute or two afterwards. It was first
thought death might have been caused
by strangulation hut a careful examina*

probably due to heart trouble of inter
