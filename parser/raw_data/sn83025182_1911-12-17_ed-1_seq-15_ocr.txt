house in reference to the abrogation
of the Russian treaty. Senator Ray
nor
of Maryland, tonight outlined gome of
the things he will say tn his address
before the senate in favor of the reso
lution. Senator Raynor ts to lead in
the fight for the adoption of the reso
lution, which according to the Rus
sian ambassador who confided the
message to President Taft. Russia
would consider it an "insult" if
passed. In speaking of the bill Sen
ator Raynor said:
"I do. not know how Russia will re
gard it but I am in favor of the Sul
zer resolution as it passed the house.
The Russia idea that once a subject
of Russia, alwaya a subject of Russia
is not the law of this land and I shall
demonstrate this proposition before
the senate t© the best of my ability.
We stand upon the law of expatra
tion as announced by our statutes. So
far as an American born citizen is
concerned it is perfectly senseless to
tell me that lie can be subject to the
Russian laws. I see nothing insulting
and offensive tn the resolution. When
Russia attempts to apply her statutes
of exparation to people that were born
in this country she does what Is con
trary to every discipline of internation
al law and diplomatic precedent.
Therefore Russia has flagrantly and
defiantly violated the compact.
Senator Smith, in referring to the
(friendship of Russia for this country,
"in the time of its greatest trial," al
luded to the action of the czar, in the
darkest days of the civil war, in
sending a fleet of warships to New
York. The commander held sealed
orders that were not to De opened
unless a certain emergency arose.
The ships, anchored in the harbor,
composed p. great war power. The
contingency that was to call them into
action, did not arise and they finally
sailed for home ports without action.
The fleet came at a time when a strong
party in England was in sympathy'
with the south and radicals among
them demanded Intervention in its
behalf. This led to a practically uni
versal interpretation of the czar's
action that hostility against the north
by England should be met by the en
listment of the Russian warships in
the union cause.
Sulzer Makes Statement.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.—Asserting
that "Russia cannot afford to sulk and
be isolated," Representative Sulzer,
(democrat. New York) chairman of
the house committee of foreign af
fairs in a statement tonight expressed
hope that his resolution abrogating
the treaty of 1832 with Russia would
pass the senate unchanged.
"I hope the senate will pass the res
jolution without amendment and with
I the same unanamity the house did."
said Sulzer. "That is the only thing
that now can be done and it will be
official notice to Russia that the peo
pie of the United States are in earn
est and are sincere. Russia has al
ways doubted this. The ratification
I into law of the resolution will have a
good effect.
"Our relations with Russia will al
ways continue friendly and harmon!
ous and a new treaty, up to date, will
soon be written. Russia canot afford
to sulk and be isolated.
"Of course. I do not know what the
Russian ambassador said to the sec
retary of state, but I am satisfied
that he did not tell him that Russia
would now live up to her treaty obli
gations with the Nnited States and
recognize passports held by American
citizens without discrimination.
"T am told that the Russian am
bassador objects to mv declaration in
my resolution that 'Russia has violat
or the treaty.' This statement is ab
solutelv true. The record is conclu
sive and I am surprised that the am
bassador objects to the truth. Official
Russia seems to be getting sensitive
I about the matter and that certainly
is good sign.
There Is nothing offensive about the
resolution. I drew the resolution, with
a desire to say nothing to which offi
cial Russia or any friend or sympa
thizer with Russia could make objec
tion. The resolution Is in diplomatic
form and follows the precedents here
tofore adopted by congress. Only it
is not no dratic as some which have
been passed by congress. Tt says
nothing we do not mean and it means
nothing we have not said before."
Sulzer was not at all nervous, over the flftc.* Frank
prospect of a serious embroglio

NEJW YORK, Dec. 16.—Gotham had
hardly ceased gasping over the re
ports of the recent "soiree de La danse
eocentrique" at the home of Mrs.
Jackson Gouraud, -when the announce
ment was made today that a series of
dances had been planned for the win
ter nights that would make the first
terpsichcrean revel look like an "old
folks' entertainment" In comparison.
In the near future, Mrs. Gouraud fn
tends to give a Nipponese night at
which the Geisha girl will be given an
opportunity to prove that she can in
terpret the soul of the simoon and
daifce wierdly, wildly and exquisitely
I until all who behold, by a slight twist
of the imagination may believe they
are living at least 4,00* years ago, and
are the guests of one of the ancient
mikado*. Aesthetic dances call for so
very little in the way of costumes that
dressmakers would die of starvation
if they had no patrons but these
dancers.
Following the Nipponese dance there
is to be a south sea Island affair. This
will call for a kui dance which is popu
lar among the cannibals. A. south sea
islander believes he is overburdened
with clothes if he is. garbed in a cel
luloid collar and a silk hat.
About all that the fair terpstchorean
interpreter will need will be a coat
oi brown paint. Just what may hap
pen should Anthony Comstock gain
entrance through the carelessness of
one of Mrs, Gouraud's liveried liunkieB
is easy to-prophesy.
But Mrs.. Gouraud can see no reas
on for protest Indeed, the dances
represent art of the highest calibre
and she expects them to become quite
popular in our best society.

sharks," said United States Circuit
Judge Kenesaw M. Landis to Raymond
O'Neil, a bank clerk, today. "The
way to handle that sort of a man is
to obtain a wagon tongue and go after

Judge Landis fined O'Neil, who ad

false entries on the bank's books, one
cent. Rudolph W. Rullas, another
clerk at the same bank, and likewise
accused, assumed responsibility--for
both his and O'Neil's wrong doing, and
received a ninety day sentence. The at

by Judge Landis to show cause why
he should not be debarred from prac
