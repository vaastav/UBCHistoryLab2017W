WASHINGTON , Dec. 3. Tlio annual mes.
sago of the president , as read In both house :
ot congress today , was as follows : .
To the Congress of the United Stales :
The assemblage within the nation's legislative
hall of these charged wllh the duty ol
making laws for the benefit of a generous and
free people Impressively suggests" the exacting
obligations and Inexorable responsibility In
volved In their task. At the threshold ol
such labor now to bo undertaken by the con
gress of the United States and In the dis
charge ot an executive duty enjoined by the
constitution , I submit this commmunlcatlon ,
containing n brief statement of the condi
tion of our national affairs , and recommend
ing such legislation 'as seems 'to ma necessary
and expedient.
The lilstory of our recent dealings with
other nations , and our-peaceful relations with
them at this tlmo , additionally demonstrate
the advantage of consistently adhering to n
.firm but just foreign policy , free from en
vious , or ambitious national schemes arid
characterized by entire honesty -and sin
cerity.
During the past year , pursuant to a law
of congress , commmltsloners were appointed
to the Antwerp Industrial exposition. Thougl
the participation of American exhibitors fei
far short of completely ilustrntlng our na
tional Ingenuity and Industrial achievements
, yet It was quite creditable In view of thi
brief tlmo allowed for preparation. I Imvt
endeavored to Impress upon the llclglan gov
ernment the needlessness and positive harmfulness -
fulness ot Its restrictions upon the Importa
tion of certain ot our food products , nnd havi
strongly urged that the rigid supervisor
nnd Inspection under our laws are amply suf
flclcnt to prevent the exportation from till :
country of diseased cattle and unwholesomi
meat.
BRAZIL AND RECIPROCITY.
The termination of the civil war In Brazl
has been followed by the general prevalent
of peace and order. It appearing at an earl )
stage of the Insurrection that Its course
would call for unusual watchfulness on tlu
part of this government , our navel force Ir
the harbor of Rio de Janeiro was strength
ened. This precaution , I am satisfied
tended to restrict the Issue to a simple trla
of strength between the Brazilian govern
ment and the Insurgents and to avert compll
cations which at times seemed Imminent oui
firm attitude of neutrality was maintained ti
the end. The Insurgents received encourage
ment of eventual asylum from our command
era and such opposition ns they encounterci
was for the protection of our commerce ant
was clearly Justified by public law. A serlou :
tension ot relations having arisen at thi
close ot the war between Brazil and Portuga
by reason of the escape ot the Insurgen
Admiral da Gama and his followers , tin
friendly offices of our representatives to thosi
countries were exerted for the protection o
the subjectb of ellher within the territory o
the other.
Although the government of Brazil wai
duly notified that the commercial arrange
ment existing between the United States am
that country , based on the third section o
the tariff act of 1890 , was abrogated on Au
gust 28 , 1894. by the taking effect ot tin
tariff law now In force , that government sub
sequcntly notified us of Its Intention to ter
mlnate such arrangement an the 1st day o
January. 1895 , In the exercise ot the rlgh
reserved In the agreement between the twi
countries , I Invite attention to the correspond
cnce between the secretary of slalo and tin
Brazilian minister on this subject.
The commission organized under the con
ventlon which wo had entered Inlo with Chll
for the settlement ot the outstanding claim
of each government against the other nd
Journed at the end of the period stipulate !
for Its continuance , leaving undetermined ;
number of American cases which had beei
duly presented. These claims ore' not barred
and Decollations are now In progress fo
their submission to a tribunal on the 17th o
March next.
BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA.
The new treaty with China In further reg
ulatlon ot Immigration was signed at Wash
Ington and on August 13 It received th
sanction ot the senate. Ratification on th
port ot China and formal exchange of cople
are awallcd to give effect to this mutual ! ;
lieneflclal convention.
Gratifying recognition of the uniform 1m
partiality of this country towards all forelgi
states wa nianlfested by the coincident re
qurBt of the Chinese and Japanese govern
mcnts that- the agents ot the United State
should , within proper limit , afford protectioi
to the subjects ot the other during the SUB
pension of diplomatic relations due to a stat
ot war. This delicate ofllco was accepted
and a mltapprehenslon which gave rise t
the belief that In affordlne this kindly un
official protection our agents would exercls
the same authority which the withdraw ]
ngcnts ot the belllctrenls had exercised wa
promptly corrected. Although the war be
tween China and Japan endangers no pollc
of the United States , It deserves our graves
consideration , by reason of Its disturbance o
our growing commerce Interests In the tw
countrle * and the Increased dangers whlc
may result to our citizens domiciled or EC
Journlng la the Interior ot China , Actln
under a stipulation In our treaty with Corea
( the first concluded with a western power ) ,
I felt constrained at the beginning ot the
controversy to tender our good offices to In
duce an amicable arrangement ot the Initial
difficulty growing out of the Japanese de
mands for administrative reforms In Corea ;
but the unhappy precipitation of actual lios-
tlUUes defeated this kindly purpose. Deplor
ing the destructive war between the two
most powerful ot the caitcrn natlonn , and
anxious that our commercial Interests In
those countries may be preserved , and- that
the safety of our cltlzena there shall not be
jeopardized , I would not hesitate to heed any
Intimation that our friendly aid for the lion-
' rablo termination of hostilities would bo ac-
plable lo both belligerents.
A convention has been finally concluded
or the setllemcnt by arbitration of the pro-
mged dispute with Ecuador growing out of
lie proceedings against Emlllo Santos , a nat-
rallzed citizen ot the United State ? .
Our olllclal relations with the republic of
'ranco continue to be such as should exist
etween nallons so long bound logelher by
rlcndly sympalhy and similarity In their
orm of government. The recent cruel ossas-
Inntlon of the president ot this sister re-
nbllc called forth such universal expressions
f sorrow and condolence from our people
nd Government as lo leave no doubt of tin
epth and sincerity of our ntlnchtnont. The
evolutions passed by the senate and house
f representatives on the occasion have been
ommunlcated lo Ihe widow of President
Carriot.
GERMANY AND AMERICAN MEATS.
Acting upon the reported discovery of
'exas fever In cargoes of American cattle ,
he German prohibition against Importations
f Hvo stock and fresh meals from this coun-
ry has been revived. It Is hopsd that Gcr-
nany will soon become convinced that the
nhlbltlon Is as needless ns It Is harmful
o mutual Interests. The German government
ios excepted against that provision of the
: u toms tariff net which Imposes a dlscrlm-
nallng duty of one-tenth of 1 cent a pound
-in sugars coming from countries paying an
xport bounty thereon , claiming that the en
action of Euch duty Is In contravenllon of
articles v and Ix of the treaty of 1S2G with
'russla. In the Interests of ths commerce of
ioth countries nnd to avoid even the accusa
tion of treaty violation , I recommend the re
peal of so much of the stalute as Imposes
.hat duty , and I Invlle attention to the ac-
: ompanylng report of the secretary of stale
containing a discussion of the questions
raised by the German protesls.
PLEASED WITH THE PARIS AWARD.
Early In the present year nn agreement
vas reached with Great Britain concsralng
nstruclions to be given to the naval com-
nanders of the two governments In Bering
sea nnd the contiguous North Pacific ocean
for their guidance In the execution of the
award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration
md tlio ecforcement of the regulations there-
n prescribed for the protection of seal life
n the waters mentioned. An understanding
! ias also been reached for the payment by
the United States of $425.000 , In full satisfac
tion of all cairns which may be mads by
Great Britain for damages growing out of the
controversy as to fur seals In Bering sea , or
the seizure of British vessels engaged In
taking seal In those waters. The award nnd
findings of the Paris tribunal to a great ex-
lent determined the facts nnd principles upon
which these claims should be adjusted and
Ihey have been subjected by both govern
ments to a thorough ejcsmfnation upon the
principles ns well as the facts which they
Involve. I am convinced that a settlement
upon the terms mentioned would bo an
equitable and advantageous one , and I recom
mend that provision be made for Ihe promnt
payment of the staled sum. Thus- far only
Franco and Portugal have signified their
wll tiKness to adhere to the regulations es
tablished under the award of the Paris tri
bunal of arbltrallon.
Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan boun-
uary ana a preparatory examination of the
question of protection of food fish In the con
tiguous waters of the United States and the
Dominion of Canada are in progress.
* " ANXIOUS TO INTERVENE.
The boundary of British Guiana still re
mains In dispute between Great Britain and
Venezuela. Believing that Its early settle
ment on some -Just basis alike honorable tc
bo hi parties Is In the line of our estab
llshed policy lo remove from this hemisphere
all causes of difference with powers beyond
the sea , I shall renew the efforts hsreto
fore made to bring about a restorallon o
diplomatic relations between the disputants
nnd to Induce n referenc ? to. arbitration i
resort which Great Britain EO conspicuous ! !
favors In principle and respects In practice
and which Is earnestly sought by her weake
adversary.
Since communicating the voluminous corrs
spondcnce In regard to Hawaii and the nctloi
taken by the senate and house of reprcsenta
lives on certain questions submitted to th
Judgment and wider discretion of congress
the organization of a government In place o
the provisional arrangement which followec
the deposition of ths
queen has been an
nounced with evidence of its effective opera
tlon. The recognition usual In such case
has been accorded the new government.
Under the present treaties of extradltlor
with Italy miscarriages of-justlco have oc
curred owing to the refusal of that govern
ment to surrender Its own subjects. Thu
far our efforts to
negotlale an amended con
ventlon obviating this difficulty have beer
unavailing.
Apart from the war In which ths Islam
cmplro Is engaged. Japan attracts Increaslnf
attention In. this country by her evident de
slro to cultlvale moro liberal Intercours
with us , nnd to seek our kindly aid In fur
therance of her laudable desire for complet
autonomy In her domestic affairs and fu !
equality In the family of nallons , Th
Japanese empire of today Is no longer th
Japan of the past , nnd our relations wit
this progressive nation sliruld not be les
broad and liberal than those with olhe
powers.

OUR INTERESTS IN MEXICO.
Good will , foslersd by many Interests 1
common , has marked our relailon * wllh ou

be a new treaty of commerce nnd navlgatlo

The friendliness of the Intercourse betwee

TROUBLE IN THE MOSQUITO STRIP.
Prominent among the questions of the yea
was the Bluefields Incident , In what I
known as the Mosquito Indian strip , border
Ing on the Atlantic ocean , and within th
jurisdiction ot Nicaragua. By the treat
of 1SCO between Great Britain and Nlcaragu
the former government expressly recognize
the sovereignty ot the latter over the strip

TUKKEY JUSTIFYING ITSELF.
Claim * the Armenian ? Worn In Open Itevolt
unil Troop i Simply suppressed Them.
WASHINGTON , Dec. 3. The Turkish lega
tlon today furnished to the Associated pros
the following official telegram received * b ;
the minister from Turkey relative to th
troubles In Armenia :
It has been ascertained that agitator
originally from Houmanla and Greece nm
recruited In the Caucasus took an 1m
portnnt part In the Sassoun rebellion.
Following Instrucllons from Ihe Londoi
Armenian commission , money Is even nov
secretly-subscribed In the Caucasus with th
view of creating more trouble at Mouch
nnd other places. It was the Armenians o
the Tnlourle district who started the re
volt , attacking Mussulman villages , the In
habitants of which had great dllllculty li
sheltering themselves In their winter quar
ters near Dlarbeklr.
Regular troops were Immediately sent ot
the spot. These troops were never nccom
panled by more than seventy or eight !
Kurds , who were of the DJafur tribe , am
served as guides In those hilly regions , ac
cording to the custom that all armies fol
low. These facts show that far from com
milling nny cruelties , the regular troop
succeeded In restoring peace and order. /
further proof that here was no persecutlot
of any sort Is evidenced by the fact tha
peaceful Armenian villages not partaklnf
of the revolutionary movement , nltheug ]
surrounded by villages , the Inhnbltnnls o
which were In open revolt , were left In per
feet security and unmolested during am
after the military operations.

ATHENS , Dec. 3. The Assoclaled press
xcluslvcly has been able lo give to the worltl
he facts ot the terrible atrocities perpetrated
pen Armenian Christians In Asia Minor , and
oday n reporter of the Associated press suc-
ccded In obtaining additional details conflrm-
ng Iho statements previously made , The
cportcr loday ; met twenty Armenian refu
gees who arrived here from Armenia after
a journey full of hardships and suffering.
Securing the services of a first-class Inter-
tretcr , ho gathered the Armenians togelher
t a convenient place , and having relieved
heir pressing necessities , the Interpreter
questioned Iho refugees concerning Iho tcrrl-
> lo event which they had In a numbcn of
: ases been recent wllnesses.
This party of Armenians Is the first that
las escaped from the districts where the mas-
iacros occurred , and It Is believed that even
verse remains to bo told , ns the horrors
( escribed are understood to have lasted for
a long time after this party left. Most of
he persons who told their stories today es
caped from Moosli , Bltllls and Sassoun , tak-
nc with them whaCt little Ihcy could carry
nnd making their way with the greatest diffi
culty to the Russo-Turklsh frontier and
going to Erlvan and Etchmladzln. Several
\rmenlan women escaped from the villages
vlth this party , but when Ezeroum was
cached Ihey died from Iho effecls of the
iabro wounds Inflicted upon them before their
escape.
For about eighteen months Ihe Armenians
say the province of Sassoun has been sur
rounded by Turkish troops nnd nobody has
> een allowed to enter It or to leave. About
'our ' months ago the Turkish authorities
earned that the Inhabitants of Vartemls , a
village outside the frontier of Sassoun , were
sending for the necessaries of life to the vll-
ago of Dalvorlg. Such communication be-
: wccn the two villages being prohibited , the
Turks massacred nearly all the Inhabitants
of Vartemls. This was the second massacre
to occur. The flrst took place about a year
ago. One of the refugees , a man named
Khadjlk , stales that his unc'e and aunt were
both killed , the latter being violated previous
to being put to death. An Armenian priest
named Kevont was killed for refusing to
celebrate Turkish riles In his church at
Vartemls. The village contained 325 Ar
menian houses before the Turks attacked It ,
but when the fugitives left only twenty-five
houses remained standing.
TOOK TKRRIIJLE VENGEANCE.
Dalvorlg , It appears , Is the largest village
In the province of Sassoun , nnd Its Inhabi
tants , when they learned of the horrors per
petrated by the Turks at Vartemls , attacked
the 'Turks on the frontier. The Turkish
commander eventually sent twelve soldiers
IntoDalvorlg to learn what had occurred.
The .Armenians , .filled With Indignation al
the 'atrocities committed by "tho ' TUrks nl
Vartcmls , attacked Ihls detachment of Tur
kish soldiers and put them all to death ,
When , the TurkUh commander heard of the
death of his soldiers he determined upor
avenging It in the most bloody manner pos
sible. A strong force of Turkish troops wai
sent to the village with artillery and the
massacre began. Guns kept up a contlnu.
OU9 flro upon Dalvorlg until practically nol
ono stone was left standing upon another. .
Selo , thq bey of Inltzonn , a Kurd , with n
detachment of Kurdish cavalry , went wlU
the Turkish soldiers to the village of Sema
and forcibly took the Armenian priest frorr
his church , after disgustingly defiling the
sacred vessels and the priest's hands. TJiej
'
then bound him on o. ' donkey , which thej
drove a distance of a few yards. The sol
dlers then fired at the priest and killed lilir
and the beast ho was bound to. Jn the sami
village the Turkish soldiers entered an Ar
menlan house and violated a woman nnd hei
daughter , the latter being 14 years of age
From this village Selo forcibly took clgh
Armenian , girls and sent them to his haren
at Inltzoun.
Further atrocities were committed by tin
Turks at the village ot Kellehusen. Utfon
dawn this place was surrounded by roldlcrs
and whllo the Inhabitants were still asleej
It was set on fire. The brutal soldlars en
tered the residence of a man namcr Araliel
who was asleep with his wife , and lorturci
them both In a terrible manner with re.
hot Irons. At Kellelmsan Iho sjldler * K'let
the Armenian priest , Margos , with twent ;

to death , the soldiers preventing n.iybod ]
from escaping from the miming dwe'llng

OVERLOOKED NO OPPORTUNITIES.
A detachment of twenty-five regulars o
the Turkish cavalry , after committing Inex
presslble horrors nt the village of Sebgank
went to the village school and assaulted tli
girls found lliere. The cavalrymen Ihen devastated
vastated the building. Ibo IJey , the notorlou
Kurd brigand of 'the village ot Djlbran , am
a colonel In Iho regular army , went with
detachment of Turkish troops to the Ar
menlan villages of Dahlou , Hatesegent an
Comk , and at each place they commute
every crime possible to commit. After drlv
Ing out the nun they collected the femal
children of Dahlou together , about 200 In nil
and after assaulting them they killed thcr
all with guns and swords , After this inae
sacro the Turkish soldiers regaled them
selves with wine and whatever else the
could find In the village. The Kurdish rcgu
lar troops from Klzan and Ilahran entered th
Armenian villages of Allanozlg and Aghter
killed Ihe inhabitants and wrecked the !
houses. The number of villages devastate
In this manner Is said to be thlrty-tw <
The Armenians fled In every direction , bu
many of them were captured by the Turkls
Iroops before they could get away and wer
taken to prison.
KhadJIk , who was the principal spokesma
ot the Armenian refugees , told the who !
story In a most convincing manner. Dr. C
Thouman , a well known Armenian , hac jui
received a letter written on September 2
from Todorlan , a vlllag near Erzcroum. Tli
writer says :
How can I write of the horrors of our llf
for the days since the lltli. Mounted robber
rode up to this village an hour after sun
set and Immediately began an Indlscrlmlnat
attack upon the Armenian Inhabitants. Ovc
2UO Bliotw were fired at the house of Re\

munlty , who wan absent In Krzeroun
Three balls struck the pnstor'H wife In th
face. She subsequently died from the el
fects of her wounds. Some pocr people fret
Knees , who were living In the basement c
the pastor's house , hurried up stair * who
the llrlng was going on , and nil of thei
were wounded. Mr. Illchnrdscn , an Amei
lean missionary , came from Krzcroum to ul
tend the funeral of the pastor's wife. O
September 25 n band of robbers commute
murder at Andug nnd carried off cattle. A
Dody they broke Into houses and plunders

Dr. Thouman was formeily a professor c
the American college at Marsov .i , und wo
himself the victim of crusl persecutlo
at the hands of the Turks In 1S93 , whe
serious disturbances occurred In varlou
parts of Armenia and scores of InnoeTi

upon heavy conditions of peace , which will bo

war was concluded at the present tlmo
Japan would accept nn Indemnity of 400,000-

ccuplcd by her forces.
Too much weight should not be attached to

DBS MO1NKS , Dec. 3.-Speclnl.-An ( )
Episcopalian tempest In a teapot Is brewing
n the Iowa diocese of that church. The
locesan convention , which Is the forty-
econd meeting of the kind In the stale , con-
encs In this city tomorrow morning , Bishop
Vllllajn Stevens Perry presiding. He Is
xpectcd to let loose the tempest and the
aymen declare that If he does he'll be
nighty sorry for It.
The bishop has been abroad most of the
ast year. During his nbsence the affairs
f the. church organization have been In
he hands of nnd under the management
f a board of executors , so to speak , or , In
thcr word ? , of nn executive committee ,
'ho affairs of the church have not pros-
icrcil largely during the past year , owing
lossibly to the hard times , as well as any-
hlnc else. The bishop Is expected to crlll-
Iso Ihe management of the executive board.
If ho docs the convention will turn about
and pass resolutions of censure on , the
ilshop for not staying nt home and minding
iln own business , Instead of leaving It to
ether persons to attend to for him. They
nslst that he hasn't henitfelt sympathy with
his diocese any way , und Is nlmply watting
until he Is called higher. H Is possible that
lolhlng will come of the brewing tempest
n that particular , but It Is regarded as
mile likely , Inasmuch ns Hie displeasure
jf the bishop will be aggravated to a higher
legrce by the fact that the diocesan com-
nlttee appointed for the purpose has been
mable to raise enough funds the past year
o hire nn asslslant for the bishop to tnke
care of the west half ot the stale for him.
In n. corvenllon of Ihe diocese nt Cedar
Rapids In May , 1833 , Ulshop Perry spoke of
he necessity of eslnbllshlng an assistant
jlEhoprlu. At Sioux City , where the last
convention was held , n committee was np-
> olnled lo secure funds lo do the work ,
fho committee's chairman Is liev. J. J.
Wllklns of lies Molnes. It has failed. This
'allure will meet with the disapproval of
the bishop In no unmeaning U'rms. It Is
msslhle that the committee will undertake
o raise the funds at the convention , some
mi id red delegates being present-and It It
does another problem that will give-rise to
another tempest'will present Itself.
That * will be the choice of n mad to fill
.he place created , A number of ministers
lave already presented their claims. Among
hem Is Kev. George H. Cornell of Bloux
lty and Hlshop-Wolker-of North Dakota.
[ Jr. Green , of Cedar Hnplds , Dr. Watson of

NEW YORK , Dec. 3. President H. 0.
lavcmeycr of tlio American Sugar Refining
company tills afternoon gave out the fol-
owing statement :
"If ono will fairly nnd dispassionately con
sider tlio president's recommendation about
sugar , It will become apparent that It comes
down to this : The sugar company has taken
action , the result of which Is to deprive tern-
lorarlly.of work 25,000 persons employed In
ho various Industries dependent upon the
refining of sugar , together with the members
of this families. I assert such action
will deprive those persons of work per-
nancntly. If the Industry Is languishing ,
tlio proper courseIs to destroy It ,
"There arc some things which can bo es
tablished through a demonstration. A com-
tarlson of the duty put by the tariff bill upon
various articles will show that whllo the
nnxlmum protection accorded to sugar Is
G per cent , oilier and moro favored articles
ecclvo protection up to 40 and CO per cent.
Why this discrimination should lie made
against n largo number of persons who hold
: ho stock In the company and are employed
n Its refineries It Is Impossible to say. They
[ irotest against It. The answer to this pro
test In the president's message Is , as the
present protection Is Inadequate , It ought to
bo removed altogether.
"Heasonablo legislative aid requires that the
sugar Industry shall be treated as other In
dustries are. If this Is done the- Industry
need not languish and thousands of "dis
charged workmen will have remunerative em
ployment. The country has already pro
nounced Its judgment on the mod9In which
the last congress dealt with the Interests of
worklngmen. The presjdcnt apparently has
not learned that lesson. It ought not to re
quire much time for workmen to appreciate
that the president , In a bid for personal popu
larity , Is willing to strlko n death blow at
their Interests. II. 0. HAVEMEYER. "
