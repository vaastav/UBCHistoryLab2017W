FRESIENrS MESSAGE
1
President Roosevelt in his annual
message again urges the enactment of
a law prohibiting corporations from
contributing to campaign funds. He
also urges the passage of the measure
conferring upon the government the
right of appeal in criminal cases on
questions of law. Continuing, the
•president says:
I cannot t&y strongly urge the pas
sage of the bill in question. A failure
to pass it will result in seriously ham
pering the government in its effort to
obtain justice, especially against
•wealthy individuals or corporations
•who do wrong, and may also prevent
the government from obtaining justice
for wageworkers who are not them
selves able effectively to contest a case
where the judgment of an inferior
court has been against them. I have
specifically in view a recent decision
by a district judge leaving railway
employees without remedy for viola
tion of a certain so called labor statute.
The importance of enacting into law
the particular bill in question is fur
ther increased by the fact that the gov
ernment has now definitely begun a
policy of resorting to the criminal law
In those trust and interstate commerce
cases where such a course offers a rea
sonable chance of success.
Proper Use of Injunctions.
In my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the mat
ter by the demand that the right of ap
plying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
ing altogether the use of injunctions
in such cases would stand the test of
the courts, in which case, of course, the
legislation woi 1 be ineffective. More
oyer, I believe it would be wrong alto
gether to prohibit the use of injunc
tions. It is criminal to permit sym
pathy for criminals to weaken our
Jhands in upholding the law, and if
men seek to destroy life or property
by mob violence there should be no im
pairment of the power of the courts to
deal with them in the most summary
and effective way possible. But so
far as possible the abuse of the power
should be provided against by some
such law as I advocated last year.
Against Lynching*
I call your attention and the atten
tion of the nation to the prevalence of
crime among us and, above all, to the
epidemic of lynching and mob violence
that springs up now in one part of our
country, now in another. Each sec
tion, north, south, east or west, has
its own faults. No section can with
Wisdom spend its time jeering at the
faults of another section. It should be
busy trying to amend its own short
comings. To deal with the crime of
corruption it is necessary to have an
awakened public conscience and to
supplement this by whatever legisla
tion will add speed and certainty in
the execution of the law. When we
deal with lynching even more is neces-
A. great many white men are
lynched, but the crime is peculiarly
frequent in respect to black men. The
greatest existing cause of lynching is
l^-the' perpetration, especially by black
inen, of the hideous crime of rape, the
yjiapiost abominable In all the category
ljpf crimes, even worse than murder.
Lawlessness grows by what it feeds
upon, and when mobs begin to lynch
for rape they speedily extend the
sphere of their operations and lynch
for many other kinds of crimes, so that
two-thirds of the lynclilngs are not
for rape at all, while a considerable
proportion of the individuals lynched
are innocent of all crime.
There is but one safe rule in dealing
with black men as with white men.
It is the same rule that must be ap
plied in dealing with rich men and
poor men—that is, to treat each man,
.whatever his color, his creed or his so
cial position, with even handed justice
,^|,:n his real worth «fs a man. White
people owe it quite as much to them
selves as to the colored race to treat
-well the colored man who shows by
Ubis life that he deserves such treatment.
uThere Is
110
question of social equality
jpr negro domination involved.
In my judgment, the crime of rape
Sehould always be punished with death,
is the case with murder. Assault
*''!Vhvith intent to commit rape should be
made a capital crime, at least in the
^•discretion of the court, and provision
"Should be made by which the punish
ment may follow immediately upon
•the heels of the offense.
No more shortsighted policy can be
imagined than In the fancied interest
'Of one class to prevent the education
«of another class. The white man. If
"he Is wise, will decline to allow the
^negroes In a mass to grow to mun
ihood and womanhood without educa
tion.
I
"Preachers of Mere DlMcontent."
In dealing with both labor and cap
•r•iltal, with the questions affecting both
incorporations and trades unions, there
jta one matter more important to re
y'' iimember than aught else, and that is
v^jthe Infinite harm done by preachers of
vtaere discontent. These are the men
'who seek to excite a violent class ha
tred against all men of wealth. They
seek to turn wise and proper move
ments for the better control of corpora
tions and for doing away with the
"^abuses connected with wealth into a
campaign of hysterical excitement and
falsehood In which the aim is to in
flame to madness the brutal passions
mankind. The sinister demagogues
and foolish visionaries who are always
eager to undertake such a campaign
0f
destruction sometimes seek to as
sociate themselves with those working
[for a genuine reform in governmental
rand social methods and sometimes mas
'"f -querade
as such reformers. In reality
Hi-
they are tne worst enemies of the
cause they profess to advocate, just as
the purveyors of sensational slander in
newspaper or magazine are the worst
enemies of all men who are engaged in
an honest .effort to better what is bad
in our social and governmental condi
tions.

greed or to accumulate or add to an
already hu fortune seeks to exploit
his fellow Americans with callous dis
regard to their welfare of -§oul and

In order to obtain a high o'lice stands
on an evil e-vuality of corruption with
the man who debaaches others for
financial profit, and when hatred is
sown the crop which springs up can
only be evil.
The plain people who think—the me
chanics, farmers, merchants, workers
with head or h-:nd. the men to whom
American traditions are dear, who love
their country i.ial try to act decently
by their neighbors—owe it to them
selves to remember that the most dam
aging blew that can he given popular
government is to el.'et an unworthy
and sinister agitator on a platform of
violence and hypocrisy.
R:iilroal *:-.' [ioura.
I call your attention to the need of
passing the bill limiting the number of
hours of employment of railroad em
ployees. The' measure is a very moder
ate one, and can conceive of no seri
ous objection to it. Indeed, so far as
it is in our power, it should be our aim
steadily to reduce the number of hours
of labor, with as a goal the general in
troduction of an eight hour day. There
are industries in which it is not pos
sible that the hours of labor should
be reduced, just as ihere are communi
ties not far enough advanced for such
a movement to be for their good, or, if
in the tropics, so situated that there is
no analogy between their needs and
ours in this matter. On the isthmus
of Panama, for instance, the condi
tions are in every way so different
from what they are hero that an eight
hour day would be absurd, just as it
is absurd, so far as tl?a isthmus is con
cerned, where white, labor cannot be
employed, to bother 1 to whether the
necessary work is di ,e by alien black
men or by alien yellow men. But the
wageworkers of the United States are
of so high a grade that alike from the
merely industrial standpoint and from
the civic standpoint it should be our
object to do what we can in the direc
tion of securing the general observance
of an eight hour day.
T.et me again urge that the congress
provide for a thorough investigation
of the conditions of child labor and of
the labor of women in the United
States. The horrors incident to the
employment of young children in fac
tories or at work anywhere are a blot
on our civilization.
In spite of all precautions exercised
by employers there are unavoidable ac
cidents and even deaths involved in
nearly every line of business connect
ed with the mechanic arts. It is a
great social injustice-.o compel the em
ployee, or, rather, the family of the
killed or disabled victim, to bear the
entire burden of such an inevitable
sacrifice. In other words, society shirks
its duty by layi the whole cost ou
the victim, whereas the injury comes
from what may be called the legiti
mate risks of the trade. Compensation
for accidents or deaths due in any line
of Industry to the actual conditions un
der which that industry is carried on
should bo paid by that portion of the
community for the benefit of which
the industry is carried
011—that
is, by
those who profit by the industry. If
the entire trade risk is placed upon the
employer, ho will promptly and prop
erly add it to the legitimate cost of pro
duction and assess it proportionately
upon the consumers of his commodity.
It is therefore clear to my miud that
the law should place this entire "risk
ot a trade" upon the employer.
Capital and Labor D2ni»u«cs*
Records show that during the twen
ty years from Jan. 1. 18S1. to Dec. 31.
1900, there were strikes affecting 117,
509 establishments, aiul (i, 105.09-1 em
ployees were thrown out of employ
inent. During the same period there
were 1,005 lockouts. Involving nearly
10,000 establishments, throwing over
thehok
ne'ver so rife as in com­
munities whore the demagogue and the
ngitalar bear full s^vay, because in
such communities all moral bands be
come loosened, and hysteria and sensa
tionalism replace the spirit of sound
judgment and fair dealing as between
man and man. In sheer revolt against
the squalid anarchy thus produced men
are sure in the end to turn toward any
leader who can restore order, and then
their relief at being free from the in
tolerable burdens of class hatred, vio
lence and demagogy is such that they
cannot for some time be aroused to in
dignation against misdeeds by men of
wealth, so that they permit a new
growth of the very abuses which were
in part responsible for the original out
break. The one hope for success for
our people lies in a resolute and fear
less but. sane and cool headed advance
along the path marked out last year
by tilts very congress. There must be
a stern refusal to be misled into fol
lowing either that base creature who
appeals and panders to the lowest in
stincts and passions in order to arouse
one set of Americans against their fel
lows or that other creature, equally
base, but
baser, who in a spirit of
1,000,000 people out of employment.
Those strikes and lockouts involved an
estimated loss to employees of $i07,
000,000 and to employers of $143,000.
000, a total of $-150,000,000. The public
suffered directly and Indirectly prob
ably as great additional loss.
Many of these strikes and lockouts
would not have occurred had the par
ties to the dispute been required to
appear before an unprejudiced body
representing the nation and, face to
face, state the reasons for their con
tentiou. The exercise of a judicial
spirit by a disinterested body repre
senting the federal government, such
as would be provided by a commission
on conciliation and arbitration, would
tend to create an atmosphere of friend
liness and conciliation between con
tending parties.
Control of Corporation*).
It cannot too often be repeated that
experience has conclusively shown the
Impossibility of securing by the actions
of nearly half a hundred different state
legislatures anything but ineffective
chaos in the way of dealing with the
great corporations which do not oper
ate exclusively within the limits of
any one state. In some method, wheth
er by a national license law or in other
fashion, we must exercise, and that at
an early date, a far more complete
control than at present over these great
corporations—a control that will, among
other things, prevent the evils of ex
cessive overcapitalization and that will
compel the disclosure by each big cor
poration of Its stockholders and of its
properties and business, whether own
ed directly or through subsidiary or
affiliated corporations. This will tend
to put a stop to the securing of inor
dinate profits by favored individuals at
the expense whether of the general
public, the stockholders or the wage
workers. Our effort should be not so
much to prevent consolidation as such,
but so to supervise and control It as
to see that it results in no harm to the
people.
Combination of capital, like combina
tion of labor, is a necessary element of
our present industrial system. It is
not possible completely to prevent it,
and if it were possible such complete
prevention would do damage to the
body politic. What we need is not
vainly to try to prevent all combina
tion, but to secure such rigorous and
adequate control and supervision of
the combinations as to prevent their
injuring the jmblic or existing in such
form as inevitably to threaten injury,
for the mere fi.^t that a combination
has secured practically complete con
trol of a necessary of life would under
any circumstances show that such
combination was to be presumed to be
adverse to the public interest. It Is
unfortunate that our present laws
should forbid all combinations instead
of sharply discriminating between
those combinations which do good and
those combinations which do evil. Re
bates, for instance, are as often due to
the pressure of big shippers (as was
shown in the investigation of the
Standard Oil company and as has been
shown since by the investigation of
the tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the
initiative of big railroads. Often rail
roads would like to combine for the
purpose of preventing a big shipper
from maintaining improper advantages
at the expense of small shippers and
of the general public. Such a combina
tion, instead of being forbidden by law,
should be favored. In other words, it
should be permitted to railroads to
make agreements, provided these agree
ments were sanctioned by the inter
state commerce commission and were
published. With these two conditions
complied with it is impossible to see
what harm such a combination could
do to the public at large.
Inlieritnncc mid Income Tax.
The national government has long
derived its chief revenue from a tariff
on imports and from an internal or ex
cise tax. In addition to these, there is
every reason why, when next our sys
tem of taxation is revised, the national
government should impose a graduated
inheritance tax and, if possible, a grad
uated income tax.
I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study in
order that the people may become fa
miliar with what is proposed to be
done, may clearly see the necessity of
proceeding with wisdom and self re
straint and may make up their minds
just how far tliey are willing to go in
the matter, while only trained legisla
tors can work out the project in neces
sary detail. But I feel that In the near
future our national legislators should
enact a law providing for a graduated
inheritance tax by which a steadily in
creasing rate of duty should be put
upon all moneys or other valuables
coining by gift, bequest or devise to
any individual or corporation. There
can be no question of the ethical pro
priety of the government thus deter
mining the conditions upon which any
gift or inheritance should be received.
As the law now stands it is undoubt
edly difficult to devise a national in
come tax which shall be constitutional
But whether it is absolutely Impossible
is another question, and if possible it
is most certainly desirable. The first
purely income tax law was passed by
the congress in 1SG1, but the most im
portant law dealing with the subject
was that of 1894. This the court held
to be unconstitutional.
The question is undoubtedly very in
tricate, delicate and troublesome. The
decision of the court was only reached
by one majority. It is the law of the
"d and of course is accepted as such
and loyally obeyed by all good citizens.
Nevertheless the hesitation evidently
felt by the court as a whole in coming
to a conclusion, when considered to
gether with previous decisions on the
subject, may perhaps Indicate the pos
slbility of devising a constitutional In
come tax law which shall substantially
accomplish the results aimed at. The
difficulty of amending the constitution
Is so great that only real necessity can
Justify a resort thereto. Every effort
should bo made in dealing with this
subject, as with the subject of the
proper control by the nationnl govern
ment over the use of corporate wealth
in interstate business, to devise legis
lation which without such action shall
attain the desired end, but If this fails
there will ultimately be no alternative
to a constitutional amendment.
