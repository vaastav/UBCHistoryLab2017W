ARIZONA UNCHANGED.
Notwithstanding the recommenda
tion of President Roosevelt the sen
timent in Arizona has not been weak
ened, and the expression of the terri
torial press proves beyond a doubt that
the people are in no humor to sub
missively bow to the ukase of the
man with the "big stick." In Phoe
nix and other places the determina
tion has been reached to continue to
fight the threatened outrage with
more energy than ever before. The
opinion of Roosevelt is not final in
this matter, and it should not be
considered so, because It is in agree
ment with those who take from Ari
zona a right of heritage. The people
of Arizona knew that Rosevelt was
in favor of joint statehood, but they
Bail been led to believe that he would
remain passive; that was the state
ment of Governor Brodie, who was
the closest man to the President In
Arizona.
But because the president has rec
ommended this injustice to Arizona
ii.need not be taken as a finale of the
battle which has U. made by our,
Ecoplq against the proposition to make
ene state out of Arizona and Now
Mexico combined.
Congress is made up of a great
many men who do not approve of
everything recommended by tho pres
Ident, and the people of this terri
tory should proceed on the theory
that Congress will not agree to wipe
the Territory of Arizona off the map
and turn it over to be dominated by
the people of an adjoining territory.
Every individual congressman should
be appealed to now and until the last
vote on the statehood bill has been
recorded.
Joint statehood will brimj about a
condition of uncertainty in Arizona
which will cause a hesitation on the
jart of all seeking investment in
the West, until It has been determined
just what kind of government will be
provided' by the majority vote of New
Mexico. Joint statehood will mean
most likely that the lavss now p-c-vailing
in New Mexico will be the
ones adopted for the new state; It
would mean the substitution of the
inefficient New Mexico school law for
the perfect system which has been
Lnilt up in this territory and attract
ed praise from educators wherever It
has become known; it would no doubt
mean the abolition of our modern
Australian ballot system and our
amended and efficient primary elec
tion laws and the substitution of the
3lip-shod election laws of New Mex
ico, under which the Mexicans can
be bought and herded at the polls like
so many sheep or cattle; it would
mean that our splendid territorial un
iversity would lose the big support
now provided for it by the National
Government; it would mean that the
beautiful capital building at Phoenix
"would become the home for owls and
Kats; it would mean that our splendid
reform school and up-to-date normal
schools would be left to the mercy of
the majority vote in New Mexico for
their continuance; It would mean that
Congress wa3 -appealed to in the fu
ture for something for the new state
that something would be for the New
Mexico side of the present line; It
would mean that appropriations by
the government in the future for na
tional Irrigation enterprises would be
asked for by New Mexicans and not
by Arlzonans, and that the Rio Grande
valley would becomo the favorite,
while the people of the Salt River
-valley would most likely be left to
work out their own salvation.
These are a few of the serious prob
lems which will confront the present
population of Arizona if they are
forced by the Rough Rider president,
and It is" these 6erious problems Ari
lona must fight now if they are to
be averted.
Acordlng to the new state propo
sition the leglsialure.of the new state
iroald be composed of 70 New Mexi
cans and 40 Arlzonans. With this
condition who will doubt as to where
the two United States Senators would
come from? With tho delegates from
New Mexico in any political conven
tion doubling the number of those
from Arizona who will doubt where
the nominations for Congress and for
supreme judge will go?
The wealth, population, patriotism
and intelligence today in Arizona Is
equal to that of many of the states
now marked with a star on the flag
The pioneers have endured greater
hardships In developing the resources
of Arizona and rescuing the land
from the savage Indians than were
endured by the pioneers of any other
state; they have from the beginning
looked well to the foundation on
which the new state of Arizona would
some day be erected, and It is noth
ing more nor less than political out
rage to take this heritage "from them
simply to suit the political appetites
of Roosevelt, Beverldge, Rodey and a
few office-seeking politicians In the
two territories. ' -
PRESIDENTIAL UKASE.
(Tucson Citizen.)
In the paragraph of his message to
Congress recommending the jointure
of Arizona and New Mexico In state
hood, the president of the United
States uses this language;. "There is
no obligation upon us to treat terri
torial subdivisions, which are matters
of convenience only, as binding us on
the question of admission to state
hood." This is language that would
fit an Imperial dictator much more
appropriately than it does the chief
magistrate of a free people.
What has become of the much
vaunted corner stone of our govern
mental structure the consent of the
governed? Are the people of Arizo
na, the sons and grandsons of the
older states, to be treated like Fili
pinos and the Guamites, with no con
sideration for their own ideas, of lib
erty, happiness and government? The
Roosevelt dictum Is revolutionary. It
Is contrary to all precedent in this
country. It Is Imperial rather than
republican.
The declaration of the president
flatly assumes that the consent of
the governed should be ignored so
far as Arizona is concerned. The great
mass of the people of Arizona are ut
terly opposed to submitting them
selves to the government of the New-
Mexican majority. Only a few sore
heads here and there, men who have
been repudiated by the people at
large or by thdir parties, derelicts
in public life, generally speaking, fail
ures at everything, can be found to
assent to joint statehood. It would
be a crime to submit the 170,000 Anglo-Celtic
people of Arizona to the par
amountcy of the 350,000 or more New
Mexicans, of different language, of
different race, and of different civi
lization. We do not believe that either
branch of Congress will assent to the
perpetration of this crime against
liberty, justice and Anglo-Celtic civ
ilization. The law makers represent
the people and have some regard for
the consent of the governed and the
rights of minorities. The Senate, the.
guardlan(, protector and representa
tive of state sovereignty, will not, we
feel assured, assent to the imperial
ukase of the president. If the rights
and wishes of the people most Inter
ested are not to be considered, then
there is no just base for our claim
that ours is a government of, for and
by the people. The Senate has more
than once resisted the aggressions
of a tyrannous president, and we
have no doubt that It stands ready
to do it again.
o
Beverldge continues to hold first
place in the hatred of Arizona. There
is no excuse for the position taken on
the statehood question by the Indi
ana senator, because he has been
through the territory and knows that
joint statehood Is obnoxious to the
people. If ever Arizona Is joined in
a state with New Mexico it will be
a clear case of a government without
the consent of the governed.
o
It was a good thing that tho people
of Arizona passed Thanksgiving be
fore receiving the President's message.
That document is sufficient to chill
the thanksgiving spirit in all true
Arlzonans.

The Benefits of Modern Plumbing.
One of the most generally
approved ideas of modern
plumbing is that of installing
one-piece lavatories supplied with hot -and
cold running water in the sleeping apart'
menu and dressing chambers of the indi
vidual members of the household. '
The benefits" derived from this arrange
ment will not only be found necessary to
modern living, but also prove a source of
w convenience and comfort to the occupants.

.Lavatories with approximate prices in detail.
