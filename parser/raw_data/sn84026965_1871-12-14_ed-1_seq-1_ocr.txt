Debate on the Governor's Message.
The correspondent of the Charleston Courier
furnishes a report of several speeches in the
House of Representatives, which were deliver?
ed last week, while the Governor's annual
message was under consideration. We copy
the most notable efforts on that occasion:
Brigadier General Whipper (colored)
sounds the tocsin of war upon the
RlNG.
At the outset he disclaimed any intention, as
the author of the resolution deferring the
reading of the message on Tuesday last, to
slight the Governor. There were but few
things to which he would refer in the message,
which, in his opinion, was not such a message
as an honest man would have presented to a
Legislature. Personally, he entertained the
kindest feelings towards R. K. Scott, but offi?
cially, his opinions would be seen in the re?
marks which he was about to make. The
great question contained in the message was
the question of the finances. The Governor
had attempted to quiet the people of the State
by what he called "a true exhibit of the debt
of the State." This exhibit the speaker pro?
ceeded to dissect, and show by figures and facts
its falsity. He said, even taking the Gover?
nor's statement, financial ruin was staring the
people in the face. But what rumors were
abroad in the land ? He had heard enough to
believe that Governor Scott's statement did not
show half the actual debt of the State. The
report of the Treasurer, which accompanied
the message, shows, on the face of it, that it is
false. He then alluded to the report of the
"committee of citizens," which has already
been published. This report, said he, is only
based upon what accounts they were shown.
How many of the accounts they were allowed
to see, God only knows. The report shows, in
every line of it, a predisposition on the part of
the committee to cover up the tracks of the
monsters who have plundered the State. He
did not mean to impugn the motives of the
committee. But who were they but men who
would,most naturally, spring to the invitation,
such as had been extended them. They were
of that class, of men who were interested in the
State bonds. The report itself was drawn out,
he said, by the representative of a bank which
had invested its money in bonds, and it was
natural for them to attempt to bolster up their
tottering fortunes.
He honestly believed the debt of the State
to be $18,000,000 to ?20,000,000, and years
hence, when the truth would have a hearing in
this matter, his predictions would be verified.
But whether it was ?11,000,000, or ?15,000,000,
or $20,000,000, the result was the same?finan?
cial ruin. All this showed that, the Govern?
ment had proved itself a failure. The question
now was, "Is there a remedy, and if so, is the
General Assembly educated up to the point of
applying it." Figures will show (said he) to
any calculating, reasoning mind, that we can?
not carry on the Government as it now exists
without laying a tax of twenty or twenty-two
mills on the dollar. Will you dare to levy that
tax? Your constituents will never stand it.
It remains for you, then, to accept the ouly re?
maining remedy?there is one thing left us?
we are driven to repudiation. We need no
Act of the Legislature to accomplish this; we
have but to submit quietly, and the result will
bring on repudiation. We can forget to pass
an Act to provide for the payment of the inter?
est on the public debt, and this will be virtual
repudiation. I am not interested in bonds of
any kind, and, for one, I do not intend to allow
the men to enjoy them whom I have assisted
in hoisting into power. The time has now come
when we must either do something or give up
the attempt to carry on the Government. I,
for one, will not share the ignominy of this
man, (the Governor,) and not share his bonds.
He has shown in his message that he has vio?
lated the law, aud it is now the time for action.
I am ready for impeachment; ready to see the
guilty go to the penitentiary. Enough is known
not only to impeach them, but to send them
to some narrow confines, there to meditate up?
on their post crimes.
The Virtuous and Incorruptible Tim
Hurley speaks a piece about Honest
Carpet-baggers.
He said that as a member of the joint com?
mittee, which was to report in a few days, he
had intended not to say anything on the sub?
ject, but he was prepared to say this much.?
A lie, upon my soul, a lie. That every state?
ment contained in that message, in reference to
the debt of the State, was a lie. He was, more?
over, prepared to say that the debt of the State
was more to-day than R. K. Scott dared to tell
the people. He thanked God that in the con?
stitutional and other conventions he had per?
sistently refused to vote for the men who to-day
ought to be in the penitentiary. (Whether!
ought to be there or not?sotto voce.) Last year
I gave him the name of the dog killer. This
year he has earned the name of credit killer.
Well, this credit killer says that this will be
his lost annual message. I doubt if he is tell?
ing the truth in that fraud. If there is any
money left in the Treasury I have no doubt he
will try to buy himself in again, and the wires
are even now being laid. He will attempt
again to foist himself on the State. There
never was a Governor who made as many dif?
ferent statements concerning the finances of
the State. But that is not his fault, because
he can't tell the truth, even if he were to try.
Why, even the books which he exhibited so
willingly to the Tax-payers' Convention were
prepared for the purpose. He then asserted
that the decline in the price of bonds was
caused by the Governor. The rapid decline
was caused by Scott to enable him to purchase
bonds enough to cloak up the over-issue. He
had stolen $10,000,000 and run down the price
in order to buy and cloak up his theft. He
didn't know what injury the Governor ever did
to the man that wrote the message, but that man
will certainly be able to write over his tomb?
stone, when he dies, I am the man who killed
cock robin. He did not believe that ?14,000,
000 would cover the fraud. He knew, for a
fact, that a man was in New York last summer
with a blank commission in his pocket, trying
to get some broker or banker to negotiate the
sterling bonds. This commission was signed in
blank by the Governor, and was hawked around
among the financial men, who were begged to
take^ the loan and negotiate it. So far as the
Legislative expenses, to which the Governor
had referred, there was this to be said: If the
Legislature were to remain in session year in
ana year out, the expenditure would not he
half as great as that caused by the Governor's
stock operations. He believed that the mem?
bers of the Legislature had made up their
minds to hoist one of those fellows in the ring,
and if they were true to themselves they would
begin by impeaching the Governor. ["We will,"

? A little girl, when her father's table was
honored with an esteemed guest, began talking
very earnestly at the first pause in the conver?
sation. Her father checked her very sharply,
saying : "Why is it you always talk so much ?"
"Tause I've dot somesiu to fay,'' was the inno?
cent reply.
American Cotton Manufactures.
The importance of the greatsuccess which has
attended the manufacture of Cotton fabrics in
this country, has, we fear, not been fully appre?
ciated. That success has been so marked as to
emancipate our people from dependence upon
England for most of the Cotton fabrics which
we consume. Moreover, not only does the suc?
cess of Cotton manufactures here deprive Brit-1
ish industry of this lucrative trade on this side 1
the Atlantic, which it once enjoyed, but it
threatens it with a formidable rivalry in mar?
kets hitherto even more exclusively its own
than was the market here. Before the war,
when we were practically free from taxation,
we competed with Manchester in supplying the
China, India and other markets with certain
kinds of Cotton cloths, and there is no reason
why, with reduced taxes aud a return to specie
Eayments, we should not do it again. England
as the important advantage of cheaper labor
and capital, but this advantage is partially off?
set by an abundance of raw material and an
abundance of motive power, at our doors. It
is a slow and difficult thing to move skilled la?
bor, but to a commercial people it is the easiest
thing possible to move the material. Hence,
in getting the two necessities together, Cotton
has gone too largely from our side to the labor
on the other side, the only advantage from this
movement being the lucrative employment of
American shipping. But this trade was prac?
tically destroyed by the civil war, and it is not
probable that it will ever be fully restored.?
There is a possibility, however, of turning the
tables upon the Lancashire cotton manufactu?
rers. The English laborers, by whom Cotton
is wrought into woven fabrics, are living in a
couutry which gives fewer comforts of life and
a smaller share in the general physical and in?
tellectual inheritance of humanity. This is be?
ginning to be understood by the laborers them?
selves, and, judging from the dissatisfaction
which exists among them, it may be safely as?
sumed that the influx of the skilled labor of
England to our shores will be far greater in the
future than it has been in the past. With the
drain of her excess in the supply of loom work?
ers, we shall have gained a strong point in fa?
vor of our renewea competition in this impor?
tant field of industry. Indeed, we believe the
period is not very remote, when England will
no longer have the advantage of cheap labor.
We shall then be able to contest with her for
the supremacy in a branch of industry that has
done so much to make her great in the modern
world.
The spread of Cotton manufacturing indus?
tries at the South is one of the most gratifying
indications of the times. The establishment of
Cotton mills all over the South would add an
immense valuation to the raw material. This
would be retained in the country, and distribu?
ted amour operatives and laborers of all classes,
who are required in and about manufactories.
These would in turn distribute it in purchases,
and thus create a wide-spread prosperity. The
condition of the South, as respects the employ?
ment of capital and labor, is to be on an en?
tirely different basis in the future. In the days
of slavery, capital was invested in large plan?
tations and in slaves to carry them on. There
was little money to spare for the erection of
manufactories, and if there had been, there was
an insurmountable obstacle in the way of en?
tering largely into manufacturing. It was the
conflict between slave labor and free labor.?
Slave labor was unskilled, and, under slavery,
was incapable of attaining any high degree of
excellence; free labor would not work, and so
the South was confined mainly to the produc?
tion of the raw material. Now, however, the
conditions are changed; the old plantation sys?
tem has passed away, and free labor maps out
a new order of things. There will be, more or
less, a division of plantations. There will be a
more productive system of cotton culture, more
bountiful crops, and larger cash returns for
them. It is not too much to say that the accu?
mulated capital will be liberally invested in
manufacturing enterprises, chief bf which will
be Cotton mills. A tide of immigration South?
ward and the natural increase of population
will furnish an abundance of labor, not only
for the plantations, but for the mills. Now the
arts of reproduction arc in a rudimentary state ;
but with that spirit of enterprise which ac?
companies free labor, higher degrees of skill
will ne gradually introduced, and thero will
come a time when the finest fabrics will be pro?
duced in the midst of the plantations where
the cotton is grown. The true interest of the
South lies in the encouragement of manufac?
tures, that she may retain within her own hands
the profits upon the production of the raw mate?
rial and upon the manufactured goods, and that
she may also save the freights that are now lost
for want of skilled industrv within her own bor?
ders.?jSr. Y. Shaping and Commercial List.
Heroism of a Railroad Coxihtor.?A
conductor on a freight and passenger train of
the Syracuse and JJinghainton railroad per?
formed a daring feat a few days since, by which
a fearful catastrophe was averted. A corres?
pondent furnishes the following particulars :
"The train consisting of twenty-four stock cars
aud one passenger car, which was filled with
passengers, was between this station and Whit?
ney's Point, going at a tolerably high rate of
speed, when the engineer, William Hardy, dis?
covered a rail entirely out of the track* some
distance ahead. He immediately reversed Iiis
locomotive, but, on second thought, determined
I to attempt running the train over the place
where the rail was missing, and at once turned
on a full head of sterun. The engineer and fire?
man, however, did not remain to sec what suc?
cess the experiment would meet with, but
jumped off the engine, leaving it without any
one to control it. The train bounded over the
disconnected track at a fearful rate of speed,
every car retaining its position on the track.
The dangerous spor, was passed, but, with no
one upon the locomotive to control its speed, a
most terrible fate awaited the train somewhere.
The state of affairs became known to the pas?
sengers, and a panic was at once raised. At
Whitney's Point there was every probability
that the track would not be in readiness for the
train, as at the rate it was going it would reach
there some minutes before its time. In this ex?
tremity Conductor John Vrooman proved him?
self to be a hero. He was in the passenger tar
at the rear of the train, but clambering up the
ladder of the freight car next in advance, he
ran the whole length of the runaway train on
the tops of the cars, and was soon in the loco?
motive cab, seized the throttle, and in the next
moment had the train under control. A less
hero:,c man in charge of the train, and it is im?
possible to tell what the result of the extraor?
dinary runaway might have been."
? The death of ex-Governor John Bigler,
of California, is announced. The sad event oc
cured at San Francisco, on Friday last. There
were two brothers, both leading Democrats, and
while one was Governor of Pennsylvania, the
other occupied the same position in California.
The two Biglcrs began life, like many other
; eminent men of Pennsylvania, in the genera
i tion now passing away?in a small country
printing office in that State. Their success
should encourage all printers' devils to aim
I high in life, even if they fall short of the mark. 1
Onr Thrifty Governor.
The Toledo (Ohio) Times gives the following
information about the investments of our thrif?
ty Governor, recently effected in that State:
In view of the attention which is being di?
rected to the finances of the State of South
Carolina, it may not be amiss for us of the
State of Ohio, the home of B. K. Scott, to say,
a word. That veracious statesman has had a
great deal to say on Wall street, for some days
past; and his sayings there iiave been very
well advertised?better, probably, than he ex?
pected. He has also had a word or two to say
in Ohio, without the benefit of so great a pub?
lishing, and without any desire for it. We dis?
like, however, to see his modesty ruin him;
and will do him the favor of advertising an
item or two that can do no harm to anybody
else, and may be of great advantage to him.
It is generally understood in this region,
that Mr. Scott', of Napoleon, Ohio, was not an
overly wealthy man when he espoused the
cause of the United States "against all foes,
foreign or domestic." A carefulcyphering, ac?
cording to the most appnroved rules of arith?
metic, show the reward of that enthusiastic
espousal to be about as follows: Two years'
service as Brigadier General United States vol?
unteers and Chief of the Freedmen's Bureau
for South Carolina, at about $3,500 per year,
$7,000; three years' loyal and most valuable
service as Governor of the State of South Car?
olina, at $5,000 per year, $15,000; making a
grand total of the reward of loyalty to the ex?
tent of $22,000, which is not too much for the
extraordinary loyal services which have been
rendered to the Government by this soldier and
statesman. And to show that this distinguished
son of Ohio is a financier as well as a states?
man, we venture upon the ventilation of a few
figures, just to show what prudent use he has
made of the twenty-two thoiisand above men?
tioned.
Of course, we will nay no attention to the
ordinary expenses of himself and family during
this long period, for they are domestic affairs,
and are none of our business, except as govern?
ment money pays for them ; and we may rest
assured that government money, after it came
into Scott's hands, never paid for anything that
he could avoid. So we can take it for granted
that our worthy South Carolina Governor, start?
ing out in our great civil war without a penny,
did not expend a penny during that war, or the
revalsions that have followed it, even for the
maintenance of his family. So we give him
the advantage of $22,000, the whole of his pay
and emoluments since he began to be a briga?
dier general, including all the time that he has
furnished discipline for the State of South
Carolina.
What has he done with that $22,000? He
has been in the State of Ohio, since the expo?
sition in the public press of the South Carolina
bond frauds, and has invested his $22,000 as
follows: He is building in Napoleon, Ohio,
where he expects to live after his South Caro?
lina contract has expired, a $10,000 house for
his sister. He has taken stock in a new na?
tional bank, in the city of Toledo, to the
amount of nearly fifty per cent, more than his
whole pay as an officer of the army and Gov?
ernor of South Carolina during the whole time
that he has occupied those positions. A prom?
inent business man and capitalist from Cana?
da, well-known to capitalists in this vicinity,
visited Williams County, and other adjoining
Counties, since Gov. Scott was here, for the
purpose of purchasing timber land, with a view
of getting out large quantities of ship timber.
He found that all the available timber land of
the country round about had been purchased
ouly a few days previous by Gov. Scott.
It has also transpired that, during his visit
here, he left in the hands of some of his friends,
fully $35,000, to be invested in safe real estate.
That money is, to-day, in the hands of busi?
ness men in this vicinity awaiting investment.
And this makes about $100,000 which Mr.
Scott, of Napoleon, Ohio, now acting as Gov?
ernor of South Carolina, has invested, within
the last two mouths, in this immediate vicinity,
out of the $22,000 which has comprised the
whole of his pay and emoluments since he be?
gan to be a government officer.
The paltry sum of $100,000 is but a baga*
teile, in comparison with the $9.000,000 extra
fraud on the South Carolina bonds, if it is true.
But Governor Scott denies having made any?
thing out of the bonds; and, as far as his Ohio
speculations are concerned, wc give him the
benefit of the doubt* We will charge him only
the $22,000, which has come to him in the
shape of pay and emoluments?which is all he
claims to have received?and credit him with
the $100,000 he has saved out of it to invest in
Ohio, at one pop, within the last month.
We would merely suggest, that it isn't fair
for one man to have all the money ; and that
the Governor, having feathered his nest, cught
to stand aside, aud give some other loyal man
a chance._^ _
Southern Agriculture.?The Commis?
sioner of Agriculture, in his report accompa?
nying the President's message, speaking of the
needs of Southern agriculture, says: 'Tt must
be conceded that the course of agriculture in I
the Southern States has not been conducted
with that care, skill and regard for ultimate re- i
suits, which have characterized the operations
of farmers in other States. While their lands
are continuously devoted to cotton and tobacco,
until they have arrived at a state of exhaus?
tion, those of the North are continually improv?
ing by rotation of crops, which is absolutely
essential to the life of the soil itself, and with- j
out which fanning and planting had better be |
abandoned. These impressions have induced
me to turn my attention to these States, to seek
some mode by which the influence of this de?
partment may be directed to benefit them?to
lind out whether their implements, and especi?
ally their seeds, may not be greatly improved ;
and how, in the distribution of seeds and
plants, we may best reach thosa to whom they
may be profitably sent." He says that the
Southern States suffer greatly in their interests
for want of grasses, in the use of which their
productions would be greatly increased by ren?
dering a rotation of crops necessary. Clover,
with its deep roots, aud rye grass, n strong grow?
er, will well endure the hot sun of the South.
Referring to the distribution of seeds, the
Commissioner says: "I am satisfied that the
mode heretofore pursued is erroneous. The
quantity sent is entirely too small fur even an
experiment. A pint or a quart of wheat, oats
or other cereal, cannot, be successfully grown,
and such experiments almost uniformly fail be?
cause the quantity is too small. I need not
here discuss the reasons for this, but the result
is manifest to those who have tried the experi?
ment. It would be far better to put a half or
whole bushel of seed into the hands of one
concientious and careful person, than to divide
the same quantity among ten or twenty,"
? A gentleman was arguing with n Scotch
lady, when at length he stopped, "I tell you
what, ma'am," said lie, 'I'll not argue with you
any longer. You're not open to conviction.'*
fi>>ot open to conviction, sir I" was .the indig?
nant reply ; "I scorn the imputation, sir. I
am open to conviction. But," she added, after
a moment's pause, "show inc the man that can
convince nie."
The Presidents Message on the Ku Klux.
"We extract from the annual message of Pres?
ident Grant that portion relative to the execu?
tion of the Ku Klux law, and the suspension
of the writ of habeas corpus in nine counties of
South Carolina, giving his reasons for such ac?
tion :
There has been imposed upon the executive i
branch of the*?rOvernment, the execution of
the act of Congress approved April 20,1871,
and commonly known as the Ku Klux law, in
a portion of the State of South Carolina. The
necessity of the course pursued will be demon?
strated by the report of the committee to in?
vestigate Southern outrages. Under the pro?
visions of the above act, I issued a proclamation
calling the attention of the people of the Uni?
ted Slates to the same, and declaring my reluc?
tance to exercise any of the extraordin?r}'pow?
ers thereby conferred upon mc, except in case
of imperative necessity, but making known my
purpose to exercise such powers whenever it
should become necessary to do so, for the pur?
pose of securing to all citizens of the United
States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights
guaranteed to them by the constitution and the
laws. After the passage of this law, informa?
tion was received from time to time, that com?
binations of the character referred to in this
law, existed and were powerful in many parts
of the Southern States, particularly in certain
counties in the State of South Carolina. Care?
ful investigation was made and it was ascer?
tained that in nine counties of that State such
combinations were active and powerful, em?
bracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to
control the local authority, and, having among
other things, the object of depriving the eman?
cipated class of the substantial benefits of free?
dom and of preventing the free political actions
of those citizens who did not sympathise with
their own views. Among their operations were
frequent scourgings and occasional assassina?
tion, generally perpetrated at night by dis
uised persons, the victims in almost all cases
eing citizens of different political sentiments
from their own, or freed persons, who had
shown a disposition to claim equal rights with
other citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and
well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this
lawless violence. Thereupon, on the 12th of
October, 1871, a proclamation was issued, in
terms of the law, calling upon the members of
those combinations to disperse within five days,
and to deliver to the Marshal or military offi?
cers of the United States, all arms, ammuni?
tion, uniforms, disguises and other means and
implements used by them for carrying out their
unlawful purpose. This warning not having
been heeded, on the 17th of October another
proclamation was issued, suspending the priv?
ileges of the writ of habeas corpus, in njne coun?
ties in that State?direction was given that
within the counties so designated persons sup?
posed upon credible information to be members
of such unlawful combinations, should be ar?
rested by the military forces of the United
States, and delivered to the Marshal, to be dealt
with according to law. In two of the said
counties, York and Spartanburg, many arrests
have been made; at the last account the num?
ber of persons thus arrested, was one hundred
and sixty-eight.
Several hundred whose criminality was as?
certained to be of an inferior degree were re?
leased for the present. These have generally
made confessions of their guilt. Great caution
has been exercised in making these arrests, and
notwithstanding the large number, it is be?
lieved that no innocent person is now in custo?
dy. The prisoners will be held for regular trial
in the judicial tribunals of the United States.
As soon as it appeared that the authorities of
the United States were about to take vigorous
measures to enforce the law, many persous ab?
sconded, and there is good ground for supposing
that all such persons have violated the law. A
full report of what has been done under this
law will be submitted to Congress by the At?
torney General.
Stimulants.?There is a time when the
pulse lies low in the bosom and beat? low in
the veins; when the spirit, which apparently
knows no wakening, sleeps in its house of clay,
and the windows arc shut, the doors hung in
the invisible crape of melody ; when wc wish
the golden sunshine pitchy darkness, and wish
to fancy clouds where no clouds could be. This
is a state of sickness where physic may be
thrown to the dogs, for we wish none of it.
What shall raise the spirit? What shall
make the heart beat music again, and pulse
through all the myriad thronged halls in the
house of life? What shall make the sun kiss
the eastern hills for us, with all his old awaking
gladness, and the night overflow with moon?
light, love and flowers? Love itself is the
greatest stimulant, the most intoxicating of all,
and performs ail these miracles, and is a mira?
cle itself, and is not in the drug store, whatever
they say. The counterfeit is in the market, but
the winged god is not a moucy changer, wc as?
sure you.
Men hnve tried many things, but still they
ask for stimulants. Men try to bury the float?
ing dead of their souls to the wine cup, but the
corpse rises. Wcsce their faces in the bubbles.
The intoxication of drink sets the world whirl?
ing again, and the pulses to playing music, and
the thoughts galloping, but the clock runs down
sooner, and au unnatural stimulant only leaves
the house it filled with the wildest revelry, more
silent, more sad, more deserted. There is only
one stimulant that never intoxicates?duty.?
Duty puts a clear sky over every man, into
which the skylark, happiness, always goes sing?
ing.?Prcntiss.
Pi.KKPi.rc.ss.xrcsR.?The best anodyne is n lib?
eral amount of muscular activity out of doors
every day. Persons who set around the fire and
lounge on the sofa, or read or sew a great part
of the day, need not expect sound sleep ; only
the laboring man can taste it in its sweetness.
Many fail to sleep at night because they will
persist in sleeping in the day time. It is just
as impossible to healthfully force more sleep
on the system than the proportion of exercise
requires, as to force the stomach to digest more
food than the body requires. Rather than court
sleep by industrious activities, many persons re?
sort to medicine, and every new drug which is
heralded as a promoter of sleep becomes at once
immensely popular, even though it is known to
possess dangerous qualities.
Chloral hydrate has had a great run, and
even young men arc known to be purchasing it
at the drug stores, to be used in promoting
sleep ; it should never be taken unless advised
by the family physician, for the medical jour?
nals are constantly publishing cases where se?
rious harm and even fatal results attend its ha?
bitual use.?Journal of Health,

The New York Daily Bulletin?a commercial

Report of the Committee of Citizens, who re?
cently "examined the books of the State Treas?
urer, at Columbia, as far as practicable," says:
We shall not venture to prejudge the ac?
counts of the Financial Agent; but that he
should control such an enormous amount of
bonds, and that nothing should be known at
the State Treasury respecting the nature of his
operations, the condition of his accounts,or the
extent to which he has involved the credit of
the State, is a matter which, to say the least,
demands the promptest remedy. Mr. Kimp
ton's promised statement should not be delayed
one day; nor do we see why it need be; and it
is due to himself that he should invite, at once,
a full examination of his accounts by parties
who would command public confidence. The
gublic very properly ask, how is it that the
t?te authorities know, or profess to know, so
little of the operations of the New York Agen?
cy, when all the debt operations have been
conducted through it? There is either gross
neglect or something worse in this apparent
ignorance; and the public can ouly be expect?
ed to discredit the State officials until the mys?
tery is cleared up and everything told. If peo?
ple distrust the Government and, as Governor
Scott complains, the press has protested and the
people have begun to utter the foul word "re?
pudiation," what wonder, when the most extra?
ordinary irregularities are wrapt up in profound
secrecy ? Until the Governor gives the public
a full and fair statement of everything, he can
only expect to be distrusted, and all who hold
positions of financial trust under him.
It appears from the report of the Committee
that the Financial Agent has hypothecated
$3,773,000 of bonds, against advances amount?
ing to something over $900,000; but, on what
account this money was borrowed, they fail to
show. Their report states, relating to a summa?
ry of the debt, which we give below:
"In the above statement it will be observed
that the sum of $203,000, already referred to,
has been deducted from the estimated debt of
18o9; whether it should be so deducted must ne?
cessarily depend upon the report of the Financial
Agent. It is admitted that this amount of the
debt has been redeemed, but its final position in
the account cannot now be ascertained with cer?
tainty."
We understand this to imply that the com?
mittee was unable to satisfy itself of the incor?
rectness of a report current here that bonds
received for redemption, or in the way of con?
versions, have been used as collateral for loans.
Respecting the $200,000 held in the Sinking
Fund (also deducted from said statement of
debt,) the report makes the darkly suggestive
remark:
"This sum purports to be on hand for the re?
tirement of that amount of the existing debt.
If the whole of it or any portion has been us-ed,
(which can only appear by the report of the
Financial Agent,) the amount so used becomes
a portion of the floating debt."
Thus, the committee suggest a grave doubt
that not only has the Sinking Fund been di?
verted from its proper use, but that retired
bonds have been reissued. What have the
State officials to say to these imputations ? How
long do they suppose the bond-holders and tax?
payers will keep their patience under the dark
suspicions thus inevitably suggested? Their
reticence is naturally construed as an evidence
of guilt; and yet Governor .Scott in an official
bulletin, assumes an air of injured virtue 1
The committee deserve thanks for what they
have done; but some explanation is required
of the reasons which prevented them from ex?
tending their examinations to the othce of the
Financial Agent, where only they could expect
to find the information about which the public
are most concerned,

?The most remarkable character we ever re?
corded is n negro murderer in Nash county
named Luke Johnson, Luke was first taken up
for larceny some months Rgn, and a negro wit?
ness living ih a little log cabin in the woods
had testified against him before the grand jury.
He tracked this witness to his house one night,
and poking his gun, loaded with nails, through
a crack, he shot him dead. He was immedi?
ately arrested and lodged in the jail of Nash
county. He only stayed there one day?got
out that night; was re-arrested and carried to
Warren county jail, there to be kept more se?
cure. This is a strong jail, and is fenced around
by a strong rock wall, and there are fifty fierce
bull-dogs Kept in the jail-yard,
Luke was confined in a close coll, nntl at lost
the authorities thought they had him safe. But
they were mistaken. He took a rock out of the
floor that weighed five hundred pounds with his
own hands, and crawled under and got to the
door of the jail, but there he stunned Oh ac?
count of the bull-dogs, and he stood there in
the door and waited for the jailor to come and
"put him hack." The jailor came along after
awhile and slapped Luke in again. But the
authorities were afraid to trtist him much long?
er, so they took him back to Nash county, and
he had bin trial. He was sentenced tobe hung
hv the neck till he was dead on lost Fridav, the
17th inst
This time they handcuffed him securely in
the jail, with cuffs made to order, and also put
on anklecnfFs, locking them up securely: and
then they had a chain that run from his hand?
cuffs to his ankleeuffs.and this chain was locked
through a big iron bolt and ring iH the floor.?
He was allowed a sitting posture in a common
split bottom chair, and with his hands reached
down, chained and buckcled, took the round
out of the chair, and running it in the ring,
twisted it out, breaking the link in about twen?
ty pieces. There was a wire in some way con?
nected with this ring, and with this he picked
the locks on his cuffs and got his hf.nas and
feet free. Then with a piece of the Iron link
he forced the locks on three iron doors locked
on hjm, and also the wooden one at the en?
trance of the jail, and in this way made his
third escape, letting out with him another tic*
gro prisoner. He thus made his escape from
the gallows six days before hanging day, which
was appointed to have been last Friday. Luke
Johnson, wc are told, is a young, strapping ne?
gro man. gingcrcakc color, and is about twen- j
ty-fivo years old. He was sold as a slave seven
times in Richmond. Va.f before the war. He I
is a real mechanical genius, and during the war ]
he made a buggy out of wood, with white-oak i
springs, and without a piece of iron in it. In j
tliis buggy he used to ride to church. When j
sentence was pronounced on him in Nash Coun?
ty (,'ourl House, as the sheriff marched him out,
he exclaimed; "You all ain't going to hang
me; you can't do it!" He is still loose, and
swears he will never leave Nash county.?

Historic C'arpet-Bagism.
It looks odd that Massachusetts should bo
quoted in justification of Southern opposition
to carpet-baggers. But such is the fact. The
people of that old Commonwealth were owe
made the victims of a carpet-bagger, and th y
protested lustily against this outrage. In a
document bearing date April 18,1689, and eh-'
titled "The Declaration of the Gentlemen,
Merchants and Inhabitants of Boston and the
Country Adjacent,'" they complain that Sir
Edmond Andros had been brought from New
York to be their Governor, and they set forth
their grievances after this manner:
" The Government was no sooner in these
Hands, but care was taken to load Preferments
upon such men as were strangers to and hater*
of the people; and every one's Observation
hath noted, what Qualifications recommended
a Man to publick offices and Employments,
only here and there a good Man was used, when
others could not easily be had; the Governor
himself, with Assertions now and then falling
from him, made us jealous that it would be
thought for his Majesties Interest, if this Peo-.
pie were removed and another succeed in their
room. And these far-fetched Instruments that
were growing rich among us, would gravely in?
form us that it was not for his Majesties intercut
that wc should thrive.
"But ot all our oppressors we were chiefly
sgrtecz'd by a crew of abject Persons, fetched
from New York, to be the Tools of the Adver?
sary, standing at our right hand ; by these were
extraordinary and intolerable Fees extorted
from every One upon all occasions, without any
Rules but those of their own insatiable Avarice
and Beggar}', and even the probate of a Will
must now cost as many Pounds perhaps as it
did Shillings heretofore; nor could a small
volume contain the other Illegalities done by
these Horse-Leeches in the two or three years
that they have been sucking of ??.***
Persons who did but peaceably object against
the raising of Taxes without an Assembly, have
been for it fined, some 20, some 30, some others
50 pounds. Pact and pict Juries have been
very common things among us.
Some have been kept in long and close Im?
prisonment without any the least Information
appearing against them, or an Habeas Corpus
allowed unto them."
The protest was printed in pamphlet form,
and no doubt had a general circulation among
the people of that day. The carpet-bagger as
here pictured nearly two hundred years ago, is
true to his instincts to-day. The picture is
so life-like that it seems to have been drawn
for the Southern States in the light of the past
five years. The governments of the Southern
States were "no sooner in these hands, but care
was taken to load preferments upon such men
as were strangers to and haters of the people;
and every one's observation hath noted what
qualifications recommended a man to public of?
fices and employments; only here and there a
{;ood man was used when others could not easi
y be had." Could the writer have been more
true to history had he written of the carpet?
baggers of our time? And well may the tax
ridden and robbed people of South Carolina,
and Georgia, and Florida, and Louisiana, and
other Southern States exclaim, "But of all our
oppressors, we were chiefly squeezed by a crew
of" abject persons fetched from the North; "by
these were extraordinary aud intolerable fees
extorted from every one upon all occasions,
without any rules but those of their own insat?
iable avarice and beggary." There is not a
State iu the South that lias l.ot felt the presence
of this class. Massachusetts once protested
against these "horse leeches," but now the Rad?
icals among her people rejoice to see them prey?
ing upon the Souib.?AiwAnY/e Union and

The Story of a Ring?One or the Romances
of the War.
In the year 1801 a young man, then living a
few miles from this city, went into the Missouri
State Guard as a soldier. At Springfield, and
on the re-organization of this branch, of the
army, he took service as a Confederate.
Before leaving home, however, his mother
gave him an old-fashioned gold ring, which
had a heart upon it, and the letters "K S." en?
graved Upon this heart. She placed it on her
son's hand with a wish, or rather a prayer, that
he might go through the war and get safely
back to his nonie ngaim (
It is not known that either the ring or the
prayer acted as a charm, but the young man
went unharmed through many bloody fights,
being hit in but one of them, the wound then
proving to be only a mere scratch.
In 1864 the young man was very sick of a
fever at Clarksville, Texas. During the deliri?
um attendant upon it, and while he was tossing
to and fro, the ring slipped from his finger and
was lost. The closest search failed to find it,
and it was given up for good. There waited
upon the young man, however, a very pretty
and amiable girl, who seemed to be sorry when
he got well enough to rejoin his command.?
When he left he laughingly told her that if she
would find his ring, and he lived, he would
come back and marry her. If this promise
was made with any degree of sincerity, it wa*
soon forgotten in the excitement and care of a
soldier's life, and only at rare intervals, per?
haps, did he recall the sick room and the min?
istering angel. -
When the war was over the young man re?
turned to his father's farm iu Jackson county,
and went to work in good earnest. Two years
ago his mother died, and once more the loss of
the ring came back upon him with redoubled
sorrow. He determined to write to the lady
who had nursed him, and to inquire of her
whether she was married or not, and whether
she had ever seen or heard anything of the
present his mother had made him.
The letter was written in August, 1869, and
in March, 1870, what was his surprise to re?
ceive an answer from the identical girl he had
left in 1804, and to whom he had made a light
promise of marriage. She whs still single, she
said, aiid waiting for him. And what was
stranger still, only five days before she wrote
she had found the missing ring.
The manner of finding it was as follows:
The father of the young lady had determined
to make some repairs in his house, which re?
pairs necessitated the taking up of the floor of
the room in which the soldier had been sick.
After doing this, and while digging away some
rubbish beneath, the workmen came, upon the
[ ring. It had slipped through a crack in the
j floor, and had been lying their safe and sound
j for nearly live, long years. The lady took pos
; session of it at onec, and wrote immediately to
? its owner, as wc have stated above. Perhaps
she looked upon its recovery as an omen, and
perhaps it was. At any rate, it was a little ro?
mantic with all it.s attending circumstances.
The correspondence thus commenced, or
rather renewed, was continued with an ever-in
, creasing ardor on the part of the gentleman,
I until in the end he made a new and impetuous
I offer of marriage. Without that the story would
he incomplete. I>ast week, with money in his
i pocket, a good home in Jackson county, and a
, great happiness in his heart, this young soldier
i ?now somewhat older and more settled aud se?
date?started for Clarksville, Texas, the home
of his betrothed.? Kansas City Times.
