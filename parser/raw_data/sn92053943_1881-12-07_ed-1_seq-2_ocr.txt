'' ; Tuesday. Decamber.S, . 1881,: :oJ
' j David Davis hai 'once f more got off the
fence and again the fence feels easier. ' He
has announced his determination to sup
port the republican party in the first place
and President Arthur in the second; especi
ally Arthur.' , '.' It is good of David to turn
republican in his old age; but it is wonder
fujl how many people have made up their
minds that the Arthur Administration
needs a hearty and firm support, and how
readily Arthur acq ui sees in that view. To
be sure he never seemed to think that the
Garfield Administration should be support
ed but then he is a stalwart. ' Can it be
that those hundred thousand offices makes
any difference?.
'"The long expected message has come,
and its principle ' characteristic seems to
be length; in that it is preeminent, con
taining in all .about 17,200 words. : In
treating of oar foreign relations it is con,
gratnlatory to an extent that inspires ns
with the belief that we are a community
of Quakers, and quarrels and strife are
foreign to our natures; our standing; with !
the outside world is represented' as being
inost pacific; and no desire to ' knock a
chip on anyone's ihoulder is displayed.
, The Panama canal case is . treated ex
h'austively, and the necessity of the United
States having full control of that territory
is insisted upon. The logic , of this, de
mand is too apparent to require argument,
and Americans all will unite in seconding
the government in this stand. '
' The international difficulties into which
the republics of South America are now
plunged are commented on, and the Presi
dent takes the ground that this country
should act as a local peace-maker.
Our relations with the Chinese and
Japanese governments are commented on,
although one looks in vain for anything
like an opinion as to the manner in which
the Chinese in this country should be dealt
with. "
On financial matters. President Arthur .
has made up his mind that we are getting
rich altogether too fast, and consequently
advocates a reduction of taxation. He is
desirous that the internal revenue be de
creased, and rightly, if a reduction of re
ceipts are what he wishes, that there be no
reduction in the duties on Imports, j
In speaking of the tariff, his " caution
shows itself, and while on the one hand he
thinks, perhaps, some change should be
made, yet he thinks it had better be made
with caution; and he is fearful some Inter
ests might suffer, and bo on, until one is
lost in a maze of bewilderment as to -what
he does mean. ; ' J s,... ; .
On the subject of polygamy he comes to
the point, and advocates strong and deter
mined legislation against that eviL There I
is some ring to his utterances pa that point,
land it is to be hooed that somethinff more
than talk will grow out of , it j Utah, in its
present condition, ia a standing reproach
to the civilization of ur country. ! s f -
In treating of the' pension ofUce, he Is
non-committal, but enough Is said to show
that he full j recognizes what a fraud the
thing is at present. - ' "
The President devotes considerable space
to civil service reform. and is prolific in
suggestions; but when one thinks of the
previous history of Arthur; and his late ac-
"ns m V irginia. one 13 tefflptetl to style
his professions "& noise, - and after, that,
nothing'' I; -l.Mi-H,: i:i'Vi',jv 'ivj,.
The matter of our " carrvine trade is
discussed in a particularly weak manner.
Attention is called to the fact that while
exports and imports have , been
steadilv increasing ; the " number of
American ships 1 has' as stead
ijy diminished. 'There moat be aome pe-
culiar iindraace ; to fte development of

A means of getting rid of mutilated cur
rency has been discovered ia the St. Louis
churches where ihe coins are dropped in
the. Collector's box. Prominent ministers
there are reported as saying that the, effort
to pass mutilated money has been produc
tive of more profit to the " church than
when, all sorts of bric-a brae was passable.
A. man now, who holds a punched half-dol-lar
after essaying to pass it off for mer
chandise and t)eing unsuccessful, finally
resorts to the collection box," and, with the
shortsightedness peculiar to .roguery,, he
drops a half dollar or . a; quarter where
formerly a nickel or a dime sufficed. 1 The
money, when it accumulates, is 'sent to
the Uniied jStates mint,, where it is re
ceived and paid for as bullion, , entailing a
loss of five per cent. : . . . '
i "The President's message was probably
sent to the j" Capitol to-dayp We could
print to day a synopsis of it but prefer " to
wait till we " can present it in full. We

Bo says the Mdline Dispatch, and it is
about as cheeky a statement as that jour
nal could wellmake. : 'We could print to
day a synopsis' is rather a bold statement,
as the first knowledge-the Bitpateh could
possibly obtain of it was published in Tint
Argus of last evening, and as to profess
lag to wait to send it out as a supplement,
that supplement will be obtained from the
Union. The DiepaieA is unable to print
and news until a day after .The Akgtts,
and the Uniwh&s had it, as it well knows,
and such pretense is fooli&h. : :
