BEDFORD, PA.. FRIDAY, DEO. 9, 1864.
CONGRESS opened Monday. The President's
message, which we shall give in full next week,
was read in the two houses Tuesday afternoon.
HON. SALMON P. CHASE has been appointed
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by the Presi
dent, and his appointment confirmed by the Sen
ate. A grand stride forward from Taney to Chase.
"The world does move."
COMMISSIONED . —Hon. King lias
been commissioned President Judge of this district
by Gov. Curtin. Thus a great deal of rascality has
been wasted in the attempt to defraud Mr. King
out of the position to which he has been legally
elected. We give in another column the opinion
of Attorney General Meredith, furnished to us.
officially from Harrisburg. The case is made so
conclusivejand final, that wejpresume that the futu
rus me Judge Kimmell, will not attempt to con
trovert it.
THE TWO QUESTIONS.
It is asserted since the election by republican
papers, that in re-electing Mr. Lincoln the people
declared themselves for the principle of the "To
whom it may concern" letter. On the other hand
the New York Times, supposed to be in close re
lations with the administration, tells the rebels
they are mistaken as to the position of the North
on the slavery question:—
1 There is nothing about slavery that would pre
vent the North from making peace to-morrow if it
could. It is quite willing to leave the whole dis
posal of that subject to future peaceful and consti
tutional action. In no form or degree is the ad
herence of the South to slavery a part of our casus
belli-, Nor do we fight to overthrow state rights.
The North is still for maintaining to the last iota
every right reserved to the states by the constitu
tion. We want no consolidated government, and
would tolerate none. So far as respects veritable
constitutional state rights, we make no quarrel
with the South."
David Dudley Field made similar declarations in
a speech at a meeting to celebrate Mr. Lincoln's
re-election. He said: —
"Every one of us knows that many of those who
spoke and voted for the re-election of our present
chief magistrate, dissented strongly from some of
his acts. They are, of course, free to oppose a re
petition of them. If the election does not signify
our indiscriminate approval of the acts of the ad
ministration, much less does it signify an approval
of any particular plan of reconstruction, as it is
called. There are those who voted for Mr. Lin
coln, and perhaps a majority of them, who think
that no reconstruction is necessary; that in the
eye of the law the Union is still unbroken; and
i hat all the government has to do is to put down
the rebollion, and that all the rebels need to do, is
to submit to the laws."
It is evident that there is still a wide difference
of opinion among the dominant party as to terms
of peace and reconstruction, and especially as to
slavery. It is doubtful whether a majority of the
party would vote for the doctrine of the "to whom
it may concern'' letter. But, what needs now to
be said, and accepted, is, that this controversy is
now a thing of the past. It has ended by its own
limitations The rebels have told us unanimously
by their congress, for the twentieth time, that they
will not come back to the Union, even if we let
them hold onto slavery under the constitution.—
Moreover, the loyal states have given formal no
tice that they intend to abolish slavery throughout
the whole Union by an amendment to the consti
tution. This they can constitutionally do. Thus
the whole matter is settled for all time to come,
and in conquering the rebels we compel them not
only to submit to the constitution as it is, but as
it is to be. Now the whole controversy is removed
from the forum to the battle field, unless some
party shall undertake to procure a reversal of the
popular decisiou. The form of amending the con
stitution has yet to be gone through, indeed, but
the character of the members elect to the next
Congress shows that the matter is already fully set
tled by the people. And so evident is this that it
is possible enough ofi>the opposition members may
yield to the urgent logic of events to carry the e
mancipation amendment through Congress at the
pending session. It is clear that in every respect
it is desirable to complete the constitutional aboli
of slavery ot the earliest moment. It will sweep
all the theoretical and practical difficulties out of
the way of reconstruction. Slavery legally removed,
there will be no further need of extraordinary
oaths or other tests of loyalty in the reclaimed
states. All repentant rebels included in the presi
dent's amnesty may then resume their citizenship
by taking the oath of loyalty to the constitution,
and reconstsuction will be a simple affair.
Neither will the question of state rights give us
much trouble. The North has not renounced the
orignal doctrine, and the South does not half be
lieve the distortion of it upon which secession is
based. In the confederacy it is already practical
ly repudiated, and Jeff. Davis threatens war against
North Carolina and Georgia ifjhey attempt to se
cede from his government The states are sover
eign and independent under tha constitution, and
that sovereignty will be respected and maintai ned
but it is a sovereignty within the scope and limita-i
tions so well defined in the constitution. The
thing is true of the general government. And a
right to secede no more follows from the
sovereignty of the state, than the right to expel a
state from the Union follows from the sovereignty
of the general government. Each is sovereign,
but only over its own matters. In fact the rebel
leaders know well enough that their version of
state sovereignty is illogical and untenable. They
use it to delude and mislead their own people;
th ty will not adhere to it if they shall succeed in
establishing a government of their own. Their
will be no serious difficulty in re-establishing the
I nion on account of the southern caricature of j
the states rights theory. It will perish with the
rebellion.
SPEAKER COLFAX.—There was a brilliant ova
tion to the Hon. Schuyler Colfax in Philadelphia
at the Assembly Buildings, on Thursday evening.
Mr. Colfax made a few remarks upon the glorious
result of the recent election, adding that our only
termsto the insurgent States were an allegiance to
the Government, and acknowledgement of the Con
stitution as the supreme law of the land. The Hon.
Wm. D. Kelly and Myer Stronse also delivered
addresses.
HON. JAMES SPEED, of Kentucky, has been
appointed by the President Attorney General of
United States, to fill the vacancy occaioncd by
the resignation of Judge Bates. The Washing
ton Chronicle says:—Mr. Speed lias filled in his
own State positions of honor and importance, and
will, wc feel assured, reflect credit upon the Presi

The Richmond Whig on Gen. Sherman's
Movements.
The Richmond Whig, of the 30th ult., says:
"There is no very important news beyond thecott
firmation of the report that the enemy (Sherman),
sent off in the direction of the sea coast a etltall
body of cavalry the day before yesterday. They
struck the railroad between Savannah and Augus
ta, at Waynesboro 1 , thirty-six miles from Augus
ta, and are said by some to have plundered a pas
senger train there. Yesterday, we are informed,
the expedition had been intercepted, part of the
raiders captured, and the rest of them driven back
on Sherman's main body. Ihe object of this
movement is easily seen. Thisparty of cavalry were
on their way to Beaufort to carry the intelligence
of Sherman's position to his Government, and
communicate his wants and plans." In a lengthy
editorial op the situation, the Whig remarks: —
"While we do not effect to be a judge of military
matters, we cannot but regret the absence of Hood.
When he cut off Sherman's communications a
bove Atlanta, we supposed he intended to fortify
himself upon the railroad, and fight him when he
came out to restore them. If he should chose a
bolder game—the game he is now pursuing—we
thought, of course, Hood was to follow in his rear
and cut all communication in that direction, while
all Georgia was to rise in his front. In that view
of the case, we could see nothing better for Sher
man's army than absolute annihilation. But it
seems that our calculations were all wrong. Hood
plays no part in this interesting drama. His army
has been sent entirely off, away across the Tennes
see River, and at the last accounts were doing
nothing, most vigorously. We do not know who
planned this campaign, nor arc we competent to
pronounce judgement on military mat
ters; but it does appear to us that the policy
pursued in this case marvellously resembles that
pursued in several others of not very ancient occur
rence —which sent a portion of Bragg's forces to
Vicksburg just before he was attacked by llosen
crans, and which despatched Longstreet to Ten
nessee at the critical moment, when Grant had as
sembled all his forces from all quarters, and was
about to make his attack at Missionary Ridge. It
may be a policy strictly military, but it is very
much in opposition to common sense, which tells
us that — cater >s paribus-tvio men are stronger than
one, and that if it be an object to defeat an enemy,
it is certainly best to have as large a force as pos
sible to do it with. Hood's men have been for
weeks without an enemy before them. In that
time they might have been at Macon, in Sherman's
rear, and were they there Sherman's destruction
would have been inevitable. So at least it seems
to us. Let us, however, hope for the best, and,
among other good thing, that the President will
stay at home when the Southern armies meet with
any more bad luck.''
THE RICHMOND PAPERS ON GEN. SHERMAN.—
The comments of the Richmond Press on Sher
man's movements are painfully ludicrous—a mix
ture of bluster and of apprehention. The Exam
iner of the 25th and of the 2sth affords a remark
able contrast in its opinion. On the |26th it
thought that if Sherman should reach Beaufort
he "will have severed everyrailroadbeiween Geor
gia and Virginia;" aud that, operating from Beau
fort, he could destroy those roads repeatedly. It
concluded thence that it was "highly important
that Sherman should never take Augusta or reach
Beaufort. On the 28th it thought that he could
only march across the country, and could do "ab
solutely nothing," but that that would not injure
the country, and that it was not worth while to
disturb "Lee's army, or any other at my, on Sher
man's account." The Enquirer of the 29th, in the
opening of an editorial, proclaims that Sherman
has been ' 'repulsed and driven back wherever he
"has attempted to advance, his army is now har
"rassed on its flank and rear, and is nianfnlly re
sisted in front,'' and in the conclusion of the arti
cle says that "Sherman's successful march west
"ward" is a great moral defeat to the Rebel cause
and further admits that "while Hood's army is
"switched off in aside track at Tuscumbia, Sher
"man is rushing like a steam engine along therail
"roads of Georgia, penetrating the very heart of
"the Confedracy. The endeavor to cover up
the sharp punishment which Sherman is inflicting
in the vitals of the rebellionis evidently unsuccess
ful.—Baltimore American.
GEN. A. H. COFFROTH was in town last week
looking somewhat as if the "melancholy days" had
come, the "saddestof the year." He still cher
ishes the delusion that he is elected to Congress,
and thinks it highly unbecoming for Gen. Koontz
to aspire to ths seat when his majority is made up
solely of the villianous army vote. Still as he fears
that Congress may think soldiers had a right to
vote, the General concluded that he would be pre
pared for winning the seat in some other way.—
He cast his eye over the returns of the various
districts in the several counties, and' found that
North Ward, Chambersburg, had given Koontz
more majority than is claimed for him in the dis
srict, and could the North Ward box be set aside,
it would make Coffroth Congressman. Happy
thought ! A tilt was therefore made at the North
Ward, and we learn that an affidavit has been
made, nnder the direction of Gen. Coffroth, alleg
ing frauds in the North Ward. We bid the Gen.
speed in his mission. Hadn't he bettor go the
whole figure and have an affidavit made that the
entire Somerset election was fraudulent ? That
i would be doing the thing in some sort of style,
and with just as much foundation in truth and
honesty as there is in an assault upon the North
ward. We affectionately advise the General to
"go in" freely; insist that every vote cast for
Koontz was a fraud, and keep insisting upon it un
til Congress pays his mileage and per diem as con
testant. If he can't exactly get into Congress, he
can be next to the fellow that does!— Franklin
Repository.
RECRUlTlNG. —Recruiting is busy in New York
and some other cities, about one half of the re
cruits being substitutes and the other half volun
teers. In New York they are obtained for about
S4OO, for two years; and men liable to draft find
it to their interest to obtain substitutes now. The
price would at once go up if a draft were ordered;
and all men liable to draft should therefore take
into consideration whether it is not best to
provide against future contingencies. We do
not say that a draft is probable, nor must we be
understood as thinking that one is at all likely;
but it is one of the things that may happen, and
prudent men (who arc pairiotic also) will calculate
whether it is not better to put a soldier in the field
at a comparatively low rate, and so be sure against
whatever may happen.— Pittsburg Gazette.
THE people of Connecticut, in anticipation of
another call for troops, are already at work recruit
ing. The work of raising men for the army should
bo atynce commenced and vigorously prosecuted all
over the country. More than that, it should not be
allowed to slacken for a moment until the war is
ended.

Important to Drafted Mcu.
Some of those drafted, have been laboring un
der a mistake in supposing that they can be ex
empted on the evidence of having furnished a
substitute through any mustering officer. Indeed
several such cases have already occurred, of men
drafted, vrho instead of reporting to the - Provost
Marshal, imagine they have secured a substitute
when they get a volunteer already in the service
to credit himself on such a draft. Thit is all in
violation of strict regulation, and will result in pe
cuniary loss as well as great trouble to those de
pending upon this mode for securing substitutes.
After a man is drafted, and even before his mus
ter in, he is still considered in the service. The
same is of course the claim of the volunteer, so
that if a drafted man could be exempt on the cred
it of a soldier already in the service, the Govern
ment would gain no men, and our armies would
very- soon be depleted for the want of re-enforce
ments. All drafted men must furnish their substi
tutes through the Provost Marshals of the several
districts, and no man is elligible for substitution
until he passes the examination of the conscrip
tion board. Those paying money for substitutes
must bear these tacts in mind, if they desire to
protect themselves from loss. — Harfuburg Tele

Attorney General Meredith's Opinion in the
Matter of Granting a Commission to Judge
King.
The election of Judges is provided for by the Act
of 15thJApril, 1851. The 6th section of that Act
provides that in. case of the election of President
Judge of any Judicial District, composed of two or
more counties, the Clerks of the Return Judges of
each county shall make out. a fair statement of all
the votes that shall have been given at such election
within the county for every persou voted for, which
shall be signed by said Judges and attested by the
Clerks. This statement is required to be produced
at a meeting of the Return Judges of the District.—
The duty of the Return Judges of the District is set
forth in the 6th section, which provides that they
shall cast up the several county returns and make a
sufficient number of copies of a general return of all
the votes given for such officer in said District, all of
which they shall certify, and one of which they shall
transmit to the Secretary of the Commonwealth in
the manner provided in the Act. The 10th section
of the Act requires the Governor to grant Commis
sions to the persons elected.
The District return Judges of the loth Judicial
District, composed of the counties of Franklin! Bed
ford, Somerset and Fulton, have transmitted to the
Secretary of the Commonwealth a return in which
they state that they have not included the Bedford
county return of soldiers' votes, a copy of which
they annex, and they assign as a reason for not in
cluding it, that said return was not certified to by
nine of the return Judges of Bedford county. The
return in question is signed by thirteen of the Coun
ty return Judges, forming therefore a majority of
the whole number. The reason assigned for not in
cluding this return is palpably insufficient. As the
authority of the return lodges concerns matters of
a public nature, a majority may act at a meeting law
fully assembled, and their meeting is presumed to be
lawful in the absence of proof to the contrary.
The clause in the 79th section of the Act of ,18-39
providing that the returns shall be signed by all the
Judges present, does not govern the present case,
and if it did it would be construed as director}- mere
ly and second, it would be presumed that the return
was signed by all the Judges then present, in the
absence of proof to the contrary.
If the said soldiers' vote of Bedford county'be in
cluded, Alexander King has a majority of all the
votes in the District and is elected President Judge.
The question on which the Governor requests my
opinion is whether it is the duty of the Governor to
to include the said soldiers' vote, in ascertaining to
whom the Commission should be granted.
The District return Judges have stated in their re
turn that Francis M. Kinimell having received the
highest number of votes is duly elec.ed.
This statement is of no effect whateve-. The law
gives them no authority to declare who is elected.
Their duty is simply to cast up the county returns
and make a general return of all the votes given for
the office. In this respect the Act of 1851, regulat
ing the election of Judges, differs from the Act of
1839, the 82d section of which, relating to the elec
tion of Members of Congress, and of the State Sen
ate and the House, provides that the District return
Judges shall also return the name of the person or
persons elected, and the 83d section provides that
the return Judges shall in every case transmit to
each of the persons elected to serve in Congress, or
the State Legislature a certificate of his election. It
would not be difficult to suggest reasons for this dif
ference, but it is enough to say that the Legislature
has thought fit to make it, and that the present ease
must be governed by the Act of 1851.
The Governor then has before him the return of
the District return Judges, from which he is to as
certain who is the person entitled to receive the
Commission. This is to be done by counting the
votes given for the several candidates, and of course
the candidate having a majority of the votes is legal
ly elected and should be commissioned.
In counting the votes, I am of the opinion that the
Governor has no more right to throw out the sol
diers' vote of Bedford county, than he would have
to throw out the whole vote of any one of the coun
ties in the District. It is true that the District re
turn Judges state that they have not included it, but
they return a copy of the county return of it, and the
Governor, by refusing under such circumstances to
count it, would be acting as illegally as the District
return Judges themselves.
In fact the paper transmitted by the District re
turn Judges to the Secretary of the Commonwealth
as their return, taking the whole of it together, does
clearly show that Alexander King had a majority of
the votes in the District for President Judge, and is
duly elected to that office, and in my opinion the
Governor is bound to grant him a commission.

PRYOR.—The great long-haired warrior, who
was promoted from Brigadier General to Captain,
has gone North, under a special escort of "mud
sills' as in fomer times he would have styled
them—and it is still an open question whether his
capture cannot more properly be considered a de
sertion of the waning Rebellion. It seems certain
that he came to the picket line ostensibly to ex
change papers, but it is equally eertain that he
must have known that we allowed no such inter
course with the enemy at that point, and that he
would not be allowed to return. However this
may be, he manifested no surprise or chagrin at
being captured; and during all his sojourn here
seemed to regard the affair as a rather pleasant
episode. If such men as Roger A. Pryor—dis
paced though he was—desert the Rebel cause,' it
becomes an interesting question as to who may be
counted on for fidelity.— Washington Oorresjimuknt

According to the decision of the Attorney-Gen
eral in regard to the judgeship, General KOONTZ,
Republican, is legally elected to Congress. The
Attorney-General, however, makes a distinction
between the duties of the Return Judges in a Ju
dicial election and their powers in a Congressional
or Representative election, assuming that in the
former the Return Judges have no right to declare
uho is eleet'ti, but only to give the official returns
and the summing up thereof from which the Gov
ernor decides who is entitled to the commission,
which he issues. But in the case of a Congres

decide for themselves, giving the certficatea of e

depot, with three thousand sacks of corn, five
hundred b;des of hay. a train of curs, a large a
mount of bacon, clothing ammunition and other
Government store.-. The public building? and
hops in the vicinity were also destroyed. Stony
Greek Station is on the Petersburg and Weldon
Railroad, twenty-four miles from the foriuar and
.brty-two Lorn the latter city. The Rebels have
■e<>n endeavoring to connect the Lynchburg road
with the road to Petersburg at this point, and the '

iio rails were laid* At DuvallStation, to the south
of Stony Creek, much property was also destroyed,
and a large amount of railroad iron was discovered,
which our troops endeavored to render useless by
I turning. No information was obtained of the
passage of any troops by that route, but we think
there can be no doubt that they have been for
warded from Richmond by the Danville road. —
Stony Creek Station appears by the map to he a
ixjut twenty-three miles from this road. On Tues
day afternoon a brisk artillery duel took place be

all citizens had been enrolled and are now used for
the protection of the place, as a movement yf some
unknown character had taken place and the troops
had been ordered away. An expedition has sailed

THE WAR FOR THE UNION. !
Detail* of the liattie at Franklim-Thirty
Stand of Colors Captured.
NASHVILLE. Dee. 2.— 1 have received full e
counts of the late battle at Franklin and its out
skirts, which must be chronicled as one of the
most brilliant in its general results of the whole
war.
For three days sharp pkirinishing was kept up
during the retirement of our anny from Duck riv
er to Franklin, during which time a multiplicity
of exploits and successes resulted to the national
army.
General Cox conducted the rearguard, and on
the 29th olt., achieved a splendid victory over the
rebels at Spring Hill, while General Gilson's cav
alry gained a series of important successes over
Forrest's advance, under Roddy ; on the pike be
tween Trevine (?) and Spring Kill.
During the afternoon of the 30th ult. the rebel
army sorely pressed us. under Hood, who had
Cheatham s and Stewart's corp.?, and a portron of
Dick Taylor's command, numbering in all over
22,000 men,
OwiDg to Cox's gallant check at Spring Hill, a
portion of the £th and 23d Corps were enabled to
gain Franklin early in the day, where they threw
up light breastworks, extending from one end to
the other of the curves in the river, and behind
which our entire infantry command took position.
At 4 o'clock precisely theentire rebel force made
a charge and succeeded in making a temporary
break in our centre, commanded by Wagner. —
With characteristic impetuosity, the soldiers of
Cheatham's corps dasned into the breastworks,
co-operating with an attacking party on their left,
in an attempt to envelop and destroy our left. —
In the nick of time the troops of Wagner wore
rallied, and, throwing their whole force upon the
rebels, drove back the storming party in great dis
order, capturing several hundred prisoners. Four
times after the rebels charged our works in three
lines, and were as often repulsed with great slaugh
ter. The rebels numbered nearly four to our one,
as nearly half of the 4tli and 23d corps were in
reserve. Our breastworks were only knee high.—
They lost in killed and wounded three times as
many as we did, while the number of their woun
ded is at least six times more than ours, most of
our men being wtmnded in the head, arms, and
breast. The ariiHery fire of the enemy was made
with great precision, but their ammunition consis
ted chiefly of. shot and shell, while for two hours
immense quantities of more murderous missies
were hurled with fearful fury into the rebel lines.
All the attempts of the rebels'to gain a permanent
advantage wore frustrated, and at dark the Feder
al position was unchanged, while the rebels retired
under cover of the woods, south of the Columbus
Pike. The rebel loss, as above stated, Is fully 6,-
000, including over 1,000 prisoners, an unusual
number of which were officers. Our loss reached
a total of about 1,000.
An artillery duel was kept up till nearly mid
night, when our forces -commenced crossing the
Herpeth river, bring all our trains and parapher
nalia over in safety before daylight. Tne enemy
then retired to Wilson, four miles from this city,
at which point our front line confronts the enemy.
The falling hack of the army is in accordance to
the programme, and the battle at Franklin, al
though one of the most brilliant form, was an in
complete affair, and brought about owing to the
necessity of checking the rebel advance, and insure
the safe crossing of the river by our troops.
LATER.
NASHVILLE, Dec. 2. —Additional reports receiv
ed increase the magnitude of the late victory at
Franklin. Thirty stand of colors were captured
by the Union forces of Gen. Stanly's corps ; the
49th Indiana captured five ; the 88th Illinois
three; General Reiily's old brigade 18, and the
23d Corps captured four.
Gen. Stanly, commanding the 4th Corps, had a
very narrow escape, having had his horse killed
under him, and was shot in the right shoulder,
the ball traversing the back, and going out the
left shoulder. He is in the city, and though suf
fering considerably, is still attending to duty.
It is confirmed that Gen. Pat Cleburne, of Ten
nessee, is killed.
General Kimball, commanding the 2d Division
of General Stanly's corps, in the heat of battle
passed a rebel major general, who told him he was
mortally wounded. His men succeeded in carrying
otff the body.
It is Ivelieved that Hood's main ariuv is threat
ening Muri'reesboro, and Forrest's rebel cavalry is
making a demonstration on ocr front and right
flank.
Commander Fitch is here with a fleet Of iron
clads, and sufficient forces have arrived to insure
not only the safety of Nashville, but another U
nion victory in case of a battle under any circum
stances.
Military men all unite in the opinion that Gen
erals .Stanly an J Schofiekl conducted the retire
ment, from Pulaski in the faee of the enemy with
admirable skill, crowning all with the magnificent
Union victory at Franklin.
Another Ilebcl Kai<l--Capturc of New Creek--
Cumbcrlaud Threatened Aaiu--Dcstruc
tioK of Government Property.
We have again to chronicle one of those peri
odical visits of Rebel marauders and plunderers,
to this vicinity, to which we have been subjected
ever since the beginning of the war.
On Monday last, at about 11 o'clock, A. M.,
three or four hundred Rebel cavalry, as estimated
by some persons who saw them, belonging to the
different hand that have so often been infesting
this- locality, suddenly appeared at New Creek,
and having completely surprised the garrison sta
tioned there, captured it almost without resist
ance. In fact it is said the fort was taken and the
guns turned upon our men before they fully read
ied their situation.
Our troops there being portions of the Fifth
and Sixth West Va., Regiments, and numbering
about three hundred men. were all captured, ex
cept what few may have escaped to the mountains
in the confusion.
The extensive Government buildings used for
Quartermaster and Commissary purposes were all
destroyed with their contents that could not be
carried away.
A large number of horses and cattle were also
captured. The whole loss to the Government is
estimated at a very large amount, but not know
ing the facts we forbear speaking on the subject
Cumberland, of course, was much excited in an
ticipation of a visit from the same partv, and on
Tuesday night it is said the pickets, at Wiley's
Ford were driven in. Up to this time, however,
no eDemy has made his appearance.
Wo dislike very much to say anything condem
natory of our military authorities, but cannot re
frain on this occasion. If the facts be true as we
have heard this has been one of the most inexcu
sable blunders of the war. It was a complete sur
prise in broad day light, and that too with a
knowledge of the fact that an enemy was near.—
\\ c have no words to express our feelings at such
conduct. \\ edo not know where the blame prop
erly attaches, if there be any, but we do hope that
the proper authorities will take the mattor in hand
and i uliy investigate it and punish the gu'lty par
tics whoever they may bd.—Cumberland Civilian
Thursday, Ist inst.
Sherman Only 0 Miles from Savanuah t—The
City to be Deicniletl.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.
The Washington Republican of this evening
nays :
By the arrival of a Government transport at
r ortress_ Monroe last evening, the Government
has received advices from Savannah to the 2d of
December.
When the steamer left information had reached
Savannah that Sherman's advance was within six
miles of that city.
This does not conflict with the news brought by
the Steamer Belle, which arrived on Saturday
night, that the Savannah papers of the 30th an
nounced that Sherman's main army was within
forty miles of that city. Those papers do not
state at what date he was that distance from the
city.
A gentleman recently from Savannah informs
us that there are no important defences on the
west side of Savannah.
BALTIMORE, Dec. 5. —The special correspondent
of the Baltimore American, writing from Ft.
Monroe, last evening, reports the arrival of the
steamer General Lyon from Savannah with 702
released pnsonees.
At the timetfic'Geaerai Lyon left, onlast Thurs
day night, the latest mwa roeived from Savannah
was tq the effect that Sherman occupied Milieu,
Ga., and that his cavalry vtm scouring several
miles out from the town, meeting with but little
re-istanoe.
Every effort was being made for lite kfwc of
Savannah/ Our prisoners report that boys f i$
years and even women were assisting in the tren
ches and earthworks,
Sherman was slowly but surely advancing to rf>
wast, and no doubt of his success need be enter
tained.
General Thomas' Armp
LOUUYTLLX, Dec. 2. — This morning's Jmtuul
says General Thomas has abandrned his strong
position at Franklin and has formed his ]jj; of
battle within three miles of Nashville. Yesterday
the two hostile armies were engaged in skirmish
ing, and the rattle of musketry could plainly he
heard in the streets of Nashville. A battle, terri
ble in fury, is imiuiuet, but we do not believe Gen
eral Thomas has any fears of the result, lie is
not as weak as he would make the rebels believe,
and can offer battle to better advantage to himself
in front of Nashville than any other point. Mis
left wing restsonMurfreesboro, and when strength
ened by the forces at Chattanooga, it will be strong
enough to close upon Hood's rear and cut off his
retreat.
Tho rebel general is pressing blindly forward,
and Thomas prepared a trap, the bait of which
the foe is to a eager to nibble.
Each hour the threads of the net are moro com
pletely woven. We will not tremble for the result,
but will feel strong and hopeful for the cause, and
confidently look for victory to perch upon our
banners.
Our troops are here, and General Thomas is an
able commander. We predict the rebel arms will
meet with a terrible disaster. Thomas has altered
his plans, and will either capture or destroy the
rebel army.
Fight with Conscripts in Fultoa Couty.
McCoNNELLsm'KOj Pa., December 3
occurred at Timber Ridge, near this place, yester
day, between a portion of Company F, 201 st regi
ment of Pennsylvania mounted infantry, and some
delinquent conscripts of this county, it baring
been ascertained that a number of them would be
congregated at a shooting match, measures were
taken to secure the party. The soldiers advanced
to the spot, and as Provost Marshal Houpt went
forward to hold a parley, the conscripts cried ont,
"It is the Provost Marshal,'" and immediately a
number of shots were fired at him, none of which
took effect.
The soldiers then opened fire, and a general fight
ensued that lasted for about an hour. The deser
ters were finally driven over two hills, skirmishing
being kept up the whole way. Owing to the fact
that the fighting was carried on principally in the
woods, the casualties were slight The conscripts
lost one man killed and two wounded. None of
our men were injured. One of the wounded men
fell into our hands. The remainder of the party,
being familiar with the country, fled to the moun
tain-.
The forces were under the command of Captain
Maloney, an efficient officer, and more affairs of
this kind may be speedily looked for. as it is de
termined to bring these outlaws and incendiaries
to justice. _
Hetrratof Early Confirmed—llis Troops Gone
to Richmond.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.
A person who arrived here last night from Madi
son Court House, Ya., reports that on the 25th
of November a long wagon train, belonging to
