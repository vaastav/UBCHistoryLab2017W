We now give notice to our
subscribers that aft er the first
day. of January, 1SS9, we
eliall revise the subscription
list of the Democrat-Star,
ami shall drop from the list a
number of delinquents that
ive have carried aa long as
Ave can afford to unless
settlement is made by that
time. The circulation of the
Democrat-Star is becom
ing quite large, and without
additional outlay for increase
of facilities we will not be
able to get off the edition
with a much further in
crease. Hence, we cannot
afford to carry delinquents.
There arc many of our old
friends and patrons we would
dislike to drop, ' but huxineti
is biusuuxx, and we must con
line our edition to paid up,
bona fide subscribers.
"We also earnestly request
all indebted to the Dkmo-
CRAT-Star for advertising
and job printing to come for
ward at once and settle.

It is now positively certain thai
the next House will be Republican.

It will appear in our next.
lias. Gen. W. T. Siikrman died
in New York on Wennesday. She
was a sister of Gen. Ewing, ol
Ohio, and her remains were inter
red at St. Louis.
The penitentiary convicts are no
longer working on the Gulf and
Ship Island Railroad. The State
Board has taken them from the
managers of that moonshine con
cern. Gov. Lowry has appointed
Messrs. II. S. Hyatt, C. Thomas
and H. P. Beetnan, of Harrison
county, as delegates to the Inter
state Immigration Convention to
meet at Montgomery next Wed
nesday. .
Ji wje W. M. Hancock, at one
time Circuit Judge of this district,
and a Republican in politics, will
no doubt be postmaster again at
Meridian when Harrison takes the
reins. Col. Jim Shannon, Demo
crat, will have to vacate ere long,
and then doubtless drift back into
the newspaper business.
JJilburs, the great wagon man
ufacturer, called on Gen. Harrison
a lew days ago, and Mis he Appeal
that the General 6laied to him that
he would be President of the Uni
ted Stales, and that he would not
discriminate against any section.
Further, that Harrison said that
the intelligence of the South was
now ruling It and would continue
to do so.
$HE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
We have received President
Cleveland's message to Congress,
which was read before that body
hi hi M(iiu!;iy, but owing to its great
length it i.s impossible for lis to lay
it belon1 our leaders in full. We
therefore, give a brief syninopsis
of I lie document. It is h stales
manlike nincr, characteristic of
.Mr. Cleveland, the best President
the country has had since Wash
ington s lime :
The bulk of the message, like
those of all his predecessors, is
taken up wilh the various ques
lions presented before Congress by
the departments. Mr. Cleveland
reviews our foreign relations at
length, especially our Canadian
difficulty: calls attention to the
report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, pointing out in particu
lar the inadvisabilily of purcha
sing bonds at a premium, ana
touches, in fine, upon a hundred
similar matters. These, however,
are not the distinclive features of
his message, as his introduction is,
wherein, taking advantage of the
fact that this ii (he one Jiundredtli
anniversary of tnir adoption of the
Federal Constitution, he reviews
I he condition of the country to-day,
points out the dangers that menace
our institutions and utters a warn
ing that deserves the fullest con
sideration. The President takes, perhaps, a
somewhat too gloomy view of the
situation. We do not believe that
I he country is in as bad acondition
as his diagnosis shows; but none
the less, his warning is timely and
to the point, and shows dangers
ahead which cannot be denied and
which we must avoid.
The contest and bitlerness be
tween capital and hi bur, I lie growth
and power of the trusts, the dispo
sition to seek Federal aid for pri
vate enterprise, and the Federal
interference in local affair are, he
declares, existing evils that are
draining the life blood of the coun
try, biiihlini: up classes in America
and undermining and destroying
its institutions. (
Most of these evils can be avoid
ed, he points out, by a reduction
in our revenue, and especially by
a reduction in our tarilF rales. If
less money was taken, Irom the
people, and less surplus lying idle
in the treasury, there would be less
disposition to appeal to the Feder
al government for assistance to
purely local or individual enter
prises, less chance to acquire great
fori ones, less opportunities for
trusts and monopolies. The Pre.-i-deiit
strongly backs up his former
Ir.nfF message by his hist one to
Congress, which is more emphatic
thr.n anything else he has had to
say on the subject. Mr. Cleveland
has evidently not changed his
views on the InriiT in consequence
of his defeat ; And in probably his
last public message he warns us,
in the revi.-ion of our tariff laws
and the reduction of our revenues
the necessity for which is now
conceded by all to see to it that
the question of the direct benefit
to our citizens be the chief point
considered, and that no scheme be
accepted as satisfactory by which
the burden of die people are only
apparently relieved.
Mr. Cleveland brings the tariff
question before the country again
and leaves it there for discussion
and settlement.
Godfrey La fond arrived home
from the Soulh, where he has been
lor the past five or six years, last
Saturday evening. He has been
fishing alonglhe Gulf Coast during
his absence and has had a varied
experience and the usual fisher
man's luck. His wife came back
some mouths ago and now he
has followed her back, bidding a
long farewell to the Sunny South
anil it's shiny niggers.
We clip the above from the
Chronicle, published at Two Rivers,
Manitowoc county, Wisconsin.
Godfrey La fond sojourned at this
place about a year, and there were
no tears shed at his departure. He
was proprietor of the lotcett beer
den in town ; had become a con
stant menace to the peace and
good order of the town, and as a
part of the ret gestie of a hoodlum
pow-wow, mysteriously disappear
ed. It Two Rivers can furnish us
no better Caucasians than such
unsavory characters as arch hood
lum Godfrey Lafond, we trust the
charms of (he Sunny South will
never beguile another of them
across Mason and Dixon's Line.
To such we much prefer the "ehiny
niggers."

Letter From Hancock County.
Hancock County, Miss., f
November ;fll, 1888. S
E1 it or Doinucrut-Hlur :
Wo are having pretty cold
weather, with the bright side up
because the sun shines. As this,
the 2!)ih day of November, has
been set apart by Grover Cleve
land, President of tho United
Slates, as a day of Thanksgiving
and praise to Almighty God for
his tender niercv extended to us as
a powerful and prosperous nation,
and to thank him who rules su
preme for the abundant harvests
which have rewarded the toil of
the husbandmen during the year
that has past, and for the rich re
wards that followed the labors of
our people in their shops and in
their marls of trade and traflic.
We are equally thankful to Al
mighty God for lree speech and
free press, that we can battle
against the power of corruption
and freebooters, where and when
the face ol guile is seen, from the
President of the United States
down to a constable.
Licev. on the N. O, and N. L. R.
R., is on a boom. Seme enterpri
sing Georgians have started there,
in addition to the turpentinery ol
C. W. Roberson, the sharp whistle
of Mr. Jackson's shingle mill can
be heard with a sawing capacity of
20,000 shingles per dav it is said.
Also Mr Leek and some other gen
tleman are erecting a saw mill,
which will soon be in operation
when thev will saw some of C. W.
Roberson's trees into lumber.
We have some youns game cocks
in this viciniiy. we nave jlisi
learned that Lawrence Ladnier and
Calvin Shaw, two able bodied
young men, tried their manhood at
mauling on each other yesterday
until seuarated by friends. We
don't suppose the Iriends interfered
soon enough to displease the right
ing cocks. Observer.
Gov. Lowry's Son is Law Shoots
at Another Lawyer. A' dispatch
from Gainesville,Texas, November
2Sih, sas :
Great excitement was caused to
day in the Court room over a fight
between A.M. Thoniason and J.
L. Harris, two prominent lawyers
of the Gainesville bar. I'lie diffi
culty grew out of a dispuie which
arose while they were trying a case.
Soon after the biliigerenis were
separated ihey left I he Court-room,
riiomason going lo the foot of the
stairs. Harris came up shortly,
when the dispute came up again,
which ended in Harris shooting at
Tliomason with a large pistol, the
ball passing over his head, missing
ils mark. Thomason retreated
back into his cilice, and the fray
ended by a deputy sheriff taking
charge of Harris, Both parties are
hot-blooded and when aroused are
considered dangerous. Further
trouble ol a serious nature is ex
pected. Harris is a son-in-law of
Gov. I) wry of Mississippi, and a
few years ago was assistant Attorney-General
of that State. He
has lived here two years.
No Negro Need Applv. There
will probably be a Soul hern man
in the Cabinet of President Harri
son, And if there should be, he
will undoubtedly be a fair repre
sentative of ali that is best aud
most progressive in that region.
The same unquestionably will be
true of all ot President Harrison's
other Appointments ol Southern
men. There are dozens of men of
this class in every Southern State.
Let Southern Democrats cease
pawing the air and resume their
ordinary business employments.
No Republican desires"negrorulc"
in the South, nor will the old Car
petbager element ever be put for
ward again by the Republican par
ty. (J lobe-Democra t.
The above from the Globe-Democrat,
one of the rankest and strong
est of Bourbon Republican journ
nals would indicate that so far os
the Republicans are concerned
Cuffey will continue to stay in the
political wood pile. No reward lo
given the negro for his votes in
the past no care for how he may
cast them in the future.
O, Ingratitude, how fathomless
are thy waters! Xeto Miiippia.
The next thing to be dona is for
the electors chosen by each State
to meet at the Capital of their re
spective States and cast their bal
lots lor President snd Vice-President
and send their returns to
Washington. The law prescribes
that they shall assemble on the
second Monday in January, which
falls this year on the 14th,' and
that the voting shall be by ballot.
The result being declared, a mes
senger is chosen lo carry the re
turns to Washington, where they
are deposited, one copy with the
President of V:e Senate and one
wilh the Secretary of State.
We direct especial attention of
those who need cisterns to the ad
advertisement of Mr. B. F. Browne,
a first-class cistern builder, who
has opened a shop over in New
Venice, west side of Pancagoula
river, where he is prepared lo mao
ufaclure, on short notice, cisterns
of clear seasoned cypress, at very
reasonable prices.

"WIIEKK IS HEAVEN V
Eilitor Di'tnocrut-SIrr :
Yourcorrespoudeiil in last week's
Democrat Star refers to a "A One
sided Discnssiort," and then signs
himself 'Out-ider." I infer from
this that he does not think the dis
cussion should be one-sided, and
that he is knocking for admittance
into said discussion. If I am right
in this, I must cordially invite Bro.
"Outsider" to come in and prove
bv the savings of God, and not
Jnhii Weslev" John AllOX or
Spurgeon thai he knoirs some of
that, "oH"' of which he accuses
me. I assure every one that I am
only for what I believe lo be Truth,
and am willing, yea, anxious for
any one lo show me the t nil Ii on
all these grand subjects.
A noble man and Christian
brother, in Miking to me of this
discussion, asked me if 1 had ever
read -'Dr. Dicks' works on this
subject?" I answered no, but I
have rea.l Dis. Paul, Peter, Luke,
David, Job and Christ's works on
the subiect. I commend to Bro.
"Outsider" the 39th verse of the
5th chapter of John, in which the
Master -says: "Search the scrip-
lure."' Of course, Christ means
bv llu's that i as wellas "Outsider"
should likmw' Ihe Scriptures, be
cause thev 'testify ot Him, His
work and His coming and redeem-
Injr all things. Come in, bro.
"Outsider," and we will extend to
you the right hand of Christian
fellowship. M. A. DEES.
