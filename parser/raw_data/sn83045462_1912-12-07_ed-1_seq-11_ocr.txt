Is Easy.
NKYV YoKK. December 7.?The stock
market moved in un indecisive way at
I he opening. The Hill stocks were strongest.
with gains of a point for Northern
Pacific and % for Great Northern preferred.
Among the other stocks changes
were irregular, with a majority of small
gains.
Prices showed an inclination to advance,
hut the rise was hardly under way before
it was stopped by a break in some
industrials. Beet sugar dropped 2% and
Texas Company 5 points. Active stocks
relapsed to fractionally below yesterday's
close.
Easy at Closing.
The market closed easy. The feverish
activity of the week subsided today, owing
to the waning influence of unsettled
factors, completion of necessary liquidation
and disinclination of traders to operate
extensively in the short session.
lxindon's attitude was without decided
influence on the local market, despite the
general higher range of prices abroad.
The movement here was uncertain until
traders, finding that buying was not aggressive.
took the short side and forced
down several issues sharply. Steel. Union
Pacific. Reading and Amalgamated Copper
moved in a range of about a point,
and ruled alternately above and below
yesterday's closing- Bonds were steady.

The cotton market opened steady, at
unchanged prices to a decline of 4
:>oints. in response to slightly lower
cables than due, but very quickly rallied
on covering by recent large sellers
and a scattering demand based on bulli-h
trade reports and the average estimate
of Memphis cotton exchange members
placing the crop at 13.986,000 bales,
induuing linters. After selling 5a7
points net higher, the market met a renewal
of liquidation by tired longs and
eased off to about the closing prices of
last night, with subsequent fluctuations
la-ther narrow and irregular.
The cotton market closed steady, net
unchanged to 3 points higher; estimated
eceipts of cotton at all the ports today
were til^OOO bales, against 90,166 last week
and 61 106 last year; for the week, 400,000
bales, against 447.156 last week and 445,<09

JIM HILL DELIVERS SERMON.
Says the Decalogue Should Be in
Every Schoolroom.
W.VRREX, Minn., December 7 ?James
J. Hill, railway builder, delivered what
he termed a "real sermon" here last night
to a large crowd of farmers, business
m*-n and students. Mr. Hill's "sermon,"
which was given on the occasion of the
celebration of the completion of a new
tifty-thousand-dollar building for North
Star College, included the story of the
creation, told how sciefice and Christianity
agree, and gave several reasons
why Christianity should be taught in the
public schools.
Mr. Hill said the college should be endowed.
and promised to help it. Declaring
that religion should be taught in the
public schools, he added:
"No nation can exist without true
Christian spirit behind it. and laws that
forbid teaching Christianity are the weakest
things in our government. I hope to
see the decalogue in every schoolroom."

:\ LOCAL FINANCIAL NEWS.
Five one-thousand-dollar bonds of the
, Potomac Power Company's first issue
, were sold today at the meeting of the
. stock exchange at prices ranging from
105 to 104%, and as the selling price of the
bonds at the last sale was 106, the conclusion
might have 'been reached that the
high rates for call loans in the New York
s market were beginning to have some in?
fluence 011 the local market.
' However, what was done In the rest of
i the list did not justify such an inference.
The most notab?e occurrence was the ad1
vance in the figures for the stock of the
[ American Security and Trust Company.
. For a five-share lot, and also for ten
1 shares, 310 was paid, five points above
the highest level attained in the history
1 of the stock. The bid for the stock was
1 then 310, wltn the asking price at 335.
It is said on good authority that this
1 movement is not due to the usual cause,
' which is an increase in the dividend, for
1 it is stated there is no notion of increas1
lng the present annual distribution of
' earnings, which amount to $12 per share.
* A couple of lots of the United States
' Trust Company's stock sold for 143,
8 which Is three points above the last sellk
ing price. The bid at the close was 143.
One twenty-five share lot of Washlng1
ton Railway common stock sold for 86
8 and the bid advanced half a point, and
after call to 87. The asking price was
1 90.
1 A bid of 88% was made for twenty-five
shares or for one hundred of the prefer1
red stock and the latter lot or any part
' was to be had for 89%.

folk and Washington Steambdat Company
had declared the usual quarterly

HAT BAE SUGAR IMPORTS.
Quarantine Against Plants to Bo
Considered by Department.
Owing to the large number of insact
peats and plant diseases that affect sugar
cane, the Department of Agrieulture contemplates
establishing a quarantine under
the new federal plant quarantine law
against several of the countries whence
eons -plants are Imported.
This will, of oouree. base no afreet on
the supply of edible sugar available, being
directed solely toward 'the live plants.
There will- be- a hearing or those interested
in the subject at the Department
of Agriculture, January T. If the quarantine
is declared It probably will include
Hawaii ahd Porto Rico. <
