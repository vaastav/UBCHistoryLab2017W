PACIFIC CRUISE
Speculation Regarding President's
Order.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Ten days
hence the Atlantic battleship fleet
will steam out of Hampton Roads
and, nosing its way southward and
around the Horn, will enter the
broad expanse of the Pacific
As the date set for the beginning
of the long cruise approaches, offic
ial and unofficial Washington is man
ifesting renewed Interest in the pro
ject. Whether "Fighting Bob" Evans
is going to the Pacific with a chip on
his shoulder, ready to maintain his
reputation as a doughty warrior at
the drop of the hat, or -whether his
mission is one of peace and amity—
these are the problems that are being
discussed by thousands in the lobbies
and smoking rooms of Washington
hotels and in other public places.
Already much bitterness of spirit is
being given expression by those who
affirm or deny the wisdom of the
prospective cruise, and the determin
ation of President Roosevelt to send
the fleet to the Pacific may yet be
come a political issue of considerable
magnitude
Although none of the naval officers
who will take part in the cruise will
discuss the matter for publication. It
is known that not a few consider the
projected trip a mistake. Laymen
who are authorities on nautical mat
ters disagree as to the wisdom of the
president's order, some of them de
claring that the cruise will be im
mensely valuable as an educative
measure for the officers and men,
while others are of the opinion that
the time and money could be better
expended In practicing tactics In At
lantic waters. The latter allege that
the mere steaming around the Horn
will be of no practical value, and
that hundreds of tramp steamers can
do as much. To quote these critics,
the battleships will only do what the
ordinary South American steamer
does every month—steam and burn
coal in order to reach the next stage
in schedule time.
According to one story now In cir
culation the president's determina
tion in regard to the transfer of the
fleet was mainly the outcome of a be
lief on his part that Japan had come
to believe that the United States
governfhent was afraid of Nippon
and that it would go to any extreme
of "peace at any price" rather than
war with the mikado's empire. Jap
an, it is alleged, had come to believe
In the timidity of President Roose
velt and his advisors through a false
construction of the president's spec
ial message to congress on the San
Francisco school troubles. This Idea
that a condition of blue funk prevail
ed In Washington was, of course, de
J. PIERPONT MORGAN.
This is from a recent photograph of
the famous financier who tame to tbe
rescue of the disabled trust companies
la New York. An all night session of
capitalists held in his art gallery In
Madison avenue. New York, brought
together proiiably the most powerful
array of financier* ever gathered la
America
eldedly distasteful to the president,
and it Is possible that the conse
quent resentment at the arrogance of
Japan may have had something to do
with the president's decision.
That, however, is mere theory.
President Roosevelt found a more log
ical reason for issuing the order to
the fleet in the report of the general
board, the strategical board of the
navy department, recommending that
the fleet be transferred to the Pacif
ic. The reports upon which the gen
eral board based its recommendations
have never been made public, but it
is known that they came from
a multiplicity of confidential
sourcea, all tending to prove that
the Japanese government was pre
paring for war with the United
States. While perhaps a majority of
men in official and naval circles be
lieve that there waa no great basis
of fact in this "war scare," those who
uphold the president in his fleet re
moval order maintain that it is beet
to play safe, and that the presence of
the battleships in Pacific waters may
serve to stem the rising war tide orig
inating among the Japanese hotheads.
FILIPINOS WANT DIVORCE
Believe it Should Follow Our
Flag.
MANILA, Dec. 6.—A plenary
council of the Catholic church In the
Philippines, called by the pope, will
meet here tomorrow. It will be the
first held here. The papal delegate
who will preside over the council will
probably prepare now disciplinary
regulations, changing the Spanish
rules which have been in force on the
COUNTY SCHOOLS GROW
County Superintendent R. C. Eg
bers was in the city this morning
and reported the schools throughout
the county to be in excellent condi
tion.
He claims there are about 125
teachers employed* in the county or
nearly 75 less than last year before
the county division. There are over
5000 pupils in the county which falls
short of last year although then the
county included what is now Bonner
county.
Of the teachers over 85 per cent
are women. A short time ago they
numbered 90 per cent, the financial
flurry causing many to return to the
teachers profession. He states that
many men are applying for positions
which he believes is due to the finan
cial reaction.
In the country the teachers are
generally women and receive from
|50 to $70 per month. In the city
the grade teachers receive about $65
per month. Out of the 125 teachert
of the county over one half or 65 are
employed in the cities. More than
one half of the children attend the
graded schools. Over one third of the
children of the county attend school
In Coeur d'Alene, the census show
ing about 1,750 residing here.
All the schools are in session.
AMERICAN TO BE LORD
Will Assume Title and Take Seat in
Parliament.
LONDON, Dec. 6.—Albert Klrkby
Fairfax, the New York clerk, has de
cided to assume the title of Lord Fair
Fax and to take his seat In the house
of lords. When the fact that he had
inherited the title and estate of Lord
Fairfax was first announced to the
young man, he declared that the Eng
lish peerage had no attractions for
him and that he would refuse to as
sume the title. Since then, however,
he has apparently changed bis mind
and will renounce his allegiance to
the United States and become a sub
ject of King Edward. Many legal
preliminaries will have to be accom
plished before Lord Fairfax can take
his seat in the house of lords, but he
will likely be able to participate In
the next session of congress. It is
said that Fairfax will be the first
American citisen to occupy a place
in that august body.

olics have repeatedly urged the Am
erican government to permit divorce
In the Philippines, but Governor
Smith, who is a Catholic, has refused.
The plenary council will pass reso
lutions upholding Governor Smith
in his action and wiil demand that
no divorce be permitted in the is
lands for any reason.
The matter of divorce has become
a live issue In the Philippines, one
of Its newspaper advocates in Man
ila satirically demanding, "Does not
divorce follow the flag?" The opon
ents of the church declare that the
United States has established an al
liance with the church even cloaer
than that obtaining under the Span
ish regime, and one newspaper advo
cate charges that the governor takes
his orders from Rome and not from
Washington. It Is alleged that, as
a result of the refusal of divorce on
any grounds, the great mass of Fil
ipinos have come to totally disregard
the marriage laws and marry and
separate at will, without asking the
permission of either church or state

OFFICERS CATCH MAN
Stole Grip from Baggage Room of
Electric Depot.
A man, claiming to be J. H. Bab
cock, is resting at the city bastile; the
officers claiming he stole a grip yes
terday afternoon from the Elec
tric depot. He not only secured the
grip but the check slid boarded the
electric train for Spokane. The prop
perty was missed and the conductor
George HayUeu spotted tills man,
Babcock, and after searching him,
found the check on his person. Both
check and grip were returned to the
city. Chief of Police McGovern met
the man at Liberty lake and safely
deposited him in the local jail.
Babcock claims to hail from Seat
tle. He had upon his person pawn
brokers' tickets, marked San Fran
cisco, California, and skeleton keys.
The officers hold him to be an all
round crook. His arm is tatooed
with bis name. Two other men
were with him but he claimed he
picked them up in Coeur d'Alene.
The local officers make it so Inter
sting for these characters that usual
ly they make very brief visits to our
city.
This afternoon be plead guilty be
for Judge A. V. Chamberlain and
was given 90 days at Kathdrum,
deputy sheriff D. R. Adams taking
him there at once.
TAFT TO HURRY HOME
Political Admirer* to Give Him Re
ception.
NEW YORK. Dec. 6.—A confer
ence of the admirers and political
supporters of Secretary Taft will be
held here tomorrow for the purpose
of arranging a glorious reception for
the secretary upon his arrival here
from his world tour. Mr. Taft is ex
pected to sail tomorrow from Ham
burg on the steamer President Grant
and will reach New York late next
week. If the plans of the Taft man
agers are carried out the reception
to the secretary In New York will be
on a larger and more enthusiastic
scale than the greeting to William
Jennings Bryan when he returned
from his globe-encircling expedition.

ver anniversary during the early
