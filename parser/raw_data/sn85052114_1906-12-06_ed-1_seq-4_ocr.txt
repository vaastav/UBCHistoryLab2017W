CURRENCY REFORM
At last the prospects ot the much
needed currency reform are bright
ened as tbo shadow of unreasonable
prejudice recedes For many years
currency legislation especially legls
lotion for the purpose of making the
currency elastic was regarded with
an antipathy of long standing the
i companion to the severe attack of
anglophobia with which the nation
t was stricken a few years back Sug
gestlons of bankers that some reme
dy should bo afforded for a condition
1 which caused fluctuating rates were
regarded with the same suspicious
that attended arguments of physl
clans In favor of better sanitation
iPeoplo coudnt understand why a
1 tanker should desire reasonable eta
j ble rates of Interest any more than
they could figure out why a doctor
Y should desire healthful conditions
The simple fact Is that bankers and
doctors are affected by whatever af
4 fects the wholo community and In the
same way Unhealthful physical and
r financial conditions epidemics and
excessive rates ot Interest afflict
them as they do the rest of us Few
people In fact have understood the
C financial situation Elastic curren
r cy and automatic system are
t
s terms we pass by as technical We
t hear of 30 per cent for call loans in
N w York We hear of the money
V needed to move the crops of tho
west and lead About the New York
panics Jmnortlng 10000000 In
gold from Europe Then we lean
back with u sigh of contentmentsat

of the figures notwithstanding tho
I fact that ten times 10000000
would no more than suffice In a pan

i other commodity goes after profits
tTherb Is Just BO much money In ex I
iitcnce and it has to be visibly used 1
In cash tiantactlons Tho farmers I

Jt ram tho wOst to Nt > w York pelt moll I
And as the tide ebbs and flows obey
f jAg conditions that aro as certain I
ltsitd regular as the movements of I
i the planets the Interest rates over
the country rise and fall In response I
Money is tight they say and we
IIknor what that means
kK1 example of tho necessity

for ready cash at certain times of the I
year Is afforded lu the situation right
now Tobacco Is coming Into the I
warehouses every day and cash must
be paid on delivery It Is I ufo to say
that the ijoitUvllle tanks aro sending
a half million dollars a day to Inter
for points to pay for tobacco Now
the fame money Is needed to do ho I
ordinary business of the bank with
An elastic currency simply moans a
system by which the actual currency
of the bank can be expanded In these
annual exigencies for the accommo
dation of the customers
The bankers association proposes I
that they bo allowed to Issue notes I
to a certain per centor their capital
under the direction of the treasury
department the tax on these notes I
being high enough to drive
the notes back to the
banks when not actually needed

NEW YORKS WEALTH
By the computation of the census i
bureau the wealth of the state of t
New York comprised In farms and
other real property factories rail
roads telegraphs canals machinery
gold and sliver etc Is 14769
042207
042207This
This Is approximately oneseventh
of the national total of 107000
000000 It exceeds Italys wealth bj
pearly 2000000000 and Is about
equal to tho combined national re
sources of Spain Portugal Switzer
land and the Netherlands It ranks I
New York among the financial great
powers with a standing just below
that of AustriaHungary
A per capita division of the states
wealth would gIve 2000 to every
man woman and child as compared
with the national average of 1320
If represents tho aggregate posses
atone of 15000 plain millionaires CO
Carnegles or 20 Rockefellers It
would buy all the railroads In the
United States
To this enormous wealth state is f
1
addlngS 500000000 a year or al
most the valuation of Baltimore It I
s a wonderful showing of material
prosperity one that gives a prouder
claim to the title of Empire State
Within this single commonwealth Is
now contained more than Joyblo the
wealth of the entire natlorfnlhalf a
century ago and Its annual Increase
more than exceeds tho total value of
our explrt trade when Orant was
president New York World
WHAT WE CAN DUPLICATE
Each setting sun sees the south
I
tI
J
richer by over 3000000 In actual
wealth but even this Is nut more Im
portant than the accumulation of ex
perience in tho utilization of our re
sources which Is now In progress and
the n awakening of the entire country
to the fact that In the south Is to
center the mightiest Industrial and
commercial forces of tho world This
section can duplicate the coal and
Iron and steel Industry of the north
and west It can duplicate the cot
tonspbin ng Jijtejcstf of the world
It c n fppucate Rho lumber and
wood working Interests of the entire
country It can duplicate the oil
trade 6f America If not the worlds
It can continue to monopolize the
worlds Cotton production it can
produce all the rice needed In Amer
len nearly all tho tobacco and much
ot the sugar It can duplicate all of
the citrus fruit and trucking Indus
Itst
present cereal crop of 800000000
bushels double and quadruple its
cotton crop duplicate through its
great rivers and splendid harbors tho

Further questioning developed that
Sam Inaccordance with an ancient
Chinese custom married his wife by

surprise was in store for them
