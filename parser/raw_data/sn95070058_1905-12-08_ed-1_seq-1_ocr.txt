former assistant corporation counsel ,
was found guilty of blackmail In the

the most peculiar In the criminal an

lias come to be known as the "Dr
Joky ! and Mr. Hyde" of the legal pro
fesslon. While occupying a prom
Incnt place among his fellows In the
legal profession and enjoying a high
reputation , It has been learned that
under the name of "Lewis Jarvls , "
which he assumed for the purpose ,
Wicks wrote hundreds of letters to
persons who were Interested In cases
with which he was connected Nearly
all of these letters were confined en
tlrely to praise of Wicks , the man
and his ability In the legal profes
sion Some of the letters , however ,
had other ends in view , and It was
one of these which resulted In the
undoing of Wicks. To Dr. Edward
Weston of Newark several of these
"Lewis Jarvls" letters were written ,
advising Dr. Weston to settle a cer
tain litigation against himself by
paying several thousand dollars

AViishliigfon , Dec. 7. [ Special. ]
What Hhall we do ? That la n question
hat IM agitating many leaders In con
gres.s a I the present tlino. To gel down
0 aclunl facts , them la a serious prob
om coiil'rontliig the llcpuhllrim major

vllh the reeommeiidatlun of the piusl
lent or near enough to moot bin up

nhoiild split HID majority , the Demo-
cratu would be pleased. It In the In-
rntloii of ( ha Itepubllcnim to puss a
) iirty nito ninnnuru If possible. "It
nny not lie easy , " remarked n shrewd
observer , "but It Ii a cinch that the
'topuhllcans will find some wny to
mile a majority of their parly and puss
party bill. They nro not going to al
ow n minority of their party and the
JenioeratH ( o friimu a measure of this
kind. It would bo a party defeat. "
Looki That Way.
To the caHiial observer It begins to
ook that way. Fighting Urn president
Joes not neein very alluring. " 1 re
member , " hiiiil Sunnier Ulklns , chair
man of the senate committee on Inter-
Mute commerce , who lu looked upon
as the head and front of the opposition
to thu president' * plnn. "that ( licit ) was
a lot of talk about opposing the presi
dent's plan for luclpiocity with Cuba.
1 had no Interest In It save to stand
by the tin ill' , but I got Into that fight ,
and I found thu fellows sliding out
from under , leaving mo UH thu bund
devil. Tor years they have boon way
Ing ( lint I am opposing the president ,
and that Is what they aie suylng now. "
Tills reinuk was occasioned by an In
tlmatlon that Klklns had "surrendeted"
to the president. "They have always
Insisted that I am u railroad man , and
they seem surprised because I do not
come out and declare that I am for
whatever the ralhoads want. The fact
lu , I have never made any declaration
on the subject further than thai the
present law needed amendment. "
A Splendid Machine.
Every person of common sense Is
aware that the Uepubllcans have a
splendid organization. I once heard a
man remark to Secretary Hoot that
the Itcpnhllcan organization was tin
best constructed political machine lui
hud over known , but Theodore Roose-
vclt Is not a "machine" man. He would
smash that or anything else that
Binacks of machine methods If the machine
chine- stood In the way of what he
thought was right. If the machine aid
ed him , he would use it. If lighting the
machine mennt n party split he would
fight It , If he could use the Democrat
Ic parly and a wing of the Republicans
to accomplish results , he would use
them. Throiloie Roosevelt Is a man
who does not consider party advantage
when he thinks the IntcicstH of tin1
whole country are at stake. That Is
where he stands on the rate * question ,
and I e\ | t to see the Itc'.iuhllcun
parly , with Its machinery that IIIIH been
so highly praised , swing Into line be
hind him. It Is generalship to know
when you are beaten and make a seem
ing victory out of'wlnit appears to be a
defeat at the beginning of the contest.
Hi * "Proudest" Moment.
Senator Tlllmari and Senator Dolllvcr
enjoy each other , but there are many
passage's between them at times. After
a general discussion of several pending
Important questions , Dolllvcr remarked :
"I saw you during the proudest mo
ment of your life , Senator Tlllrnau. "
"When was that ? " asked the Soutli
Carolina senator.
"It was when you were mounted on
a coal black steed. " replied Dolllver ,
"and pranced down the avenue as a
part of the splendid cortege which es
corted Cleveland to the White House
when ho was Inst Inaugurated. "
This caused a great laugh at the ex
pcnso of Tllluian. He was governor of
South Carolina at the time referred to
by Dolllver , but In after years he be
came the most pronounced antl-Cleve
land man In the country. lie made the
most bitter speech over heard in the
senate against Cleveland.
A Curious Trio.
That recalls a remarkable clrcum-
stanco. There were at that time three
men In the senate all calling themselves
Dciupcrats and all opposed to Cleve
land. They were Gorman of Maryland ,
Hill of New York and Tlllman of South
Carolina. Those three were opposed to
each other. They did not ngrco on any
of the fundamental principles of De
mocracy and could not bo called parti
sans In anything save that they called
themselves Democrats. There Is not
tltno to co Into the number of details
