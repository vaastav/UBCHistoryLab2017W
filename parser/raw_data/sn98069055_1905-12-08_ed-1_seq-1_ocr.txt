Society was out in force and filled the
reserved galleries, while visitors un

brief, but most of the spectators
seemed to find quite as much to in

Cases in which saloon men are for

BELLIOUS TROOPS ON THE
8TREET8 OF KIEFF.
Berlin, Dec. 4.—A dispatch to the
Lokal Anzeiger from Kieff, via Pod

One company of a pontoon battalion
mutinied during the day and, fully
armed, marched through the streets
trying to persuade other troops to join
It. Only an engineer corps did so.
The mutineers, then 2,000 strong, con
tinued their march. Two hundred
Cossacks were sent to prevent their
advance, but General Drake, in order
to prevent bloodshed, subsequently
withdrew the Cossacks and permitted
the mutineers to pass. General Drake
made repeated and kindly efforts to
persuade the mutineers to abandon
their foolhardy course. A part of them
had complied when Governor General
Suchomlimoff telephoned and ordered
that energetic measures be taken
against the mutineers and that the lat
ter be fired on at the first opportunity.
The mutineers halted before the bar
racks of an Azoff regiment, which was
called on to join the march. During
the demonstration at the barracks sev
eral mutineers fired, wounding an offi
cer and two or three soldiers. The
troops then fired upon the mutineers,
who returned the fire and fled after
several more volleys from the troops.
The casualties on both sides were
about 70 dead and 300 wounded. Two
hundred mutineers surrendered.

There Exceedingly Grave.
St. Petersburg, via Berlin, Dee. 4.—
Intense alarm prevails here. Com
munication with the. outer world by
telegraph ceased Saturday morning
when the Finnish operators joined
their Russian comrades.
The embassies, legations and banks
are hastily organizing courier services
to both the Finnish and German fron
tiers.
The population is almost in a state
of panic, fearing that the railroads
will stop running and that the inhabi
tants therefore will have no mode of
flight in the event of the cataclysm
which they seem to fear is imminent.
Stories of the spread of disaffection
In the guard regiments are in every
body's mouth and the revolutionaries
continue to boast that the troops will
no longer fire on the people.
Saturday morning newsboys were
openly hawking fiy sheets in the
street? retaining an account of an al
leged revolt at Tsarskoe Selo and cry
ing out "the emperor's -palace guard
has mutinied."
Foundation of the 8torlea.
According to reliable information
the only foundation for these stories
is the arrest of the soldiers of the
guard at Tsarskoe S. Thursday.
Nevertheless, in their excited state
the people give ready credence to all
rumorB and this adds to the general
alarm.
The air is also filled with stories of
the alleged revolution at the palace
Friday in which Grand Duke Boris Is
said to have attempted the life of the
emperor. These stories likewise are
untrue, but they prove that a revolu
tion In the palace is considered possi
ble at any time.
This situation has greatly Increased
the dangers of a financial crash. The
people, even the commercial interests,
are withdrawing their money from the
banks, converting it into gold, hoard
ing it or demanding foreign exchange
which the state bank is issuing upon
the foreign balances of the govern-,
ment. Exchange on London Friday
rose to 9.50, over a rouble above the
normaL
The Associated Press has just
learned from a high authority that the
situation in the Baltic provinces has
grown exceedingly grave and that the

cause of the extraordinary cabinet

These were the last words on earth
of C. D. Crawford, condemned mur
derer of Heine Lundeen in a boxcar

With stoical fortitude Crawford
mounted the gallows, walking straight
and erect. Sheriff Ward walked on
one side of him and Father Goebel on
the other.
Crawford walked directly onto the
trap and stood perfectly rigid while
Father Goebel prayed. When asked if
he had anything to say Crawford re
peated the words above quoted. The
black cap was then adjusted and the
trap sprung. Ten minutes later Craw
ford was declared dead and the body
