resident ¥ilsonl and Igs Message.
The message of President Wilson
to Congress is receiving the ap
proval of the people, irrespective of
political views., Unlike some of his
predecessors he has refrained from
an indulgence in a circumlocution
of phraseology which only the very
few can understand. He has ad
dressed himself plainly to the peo
ple, and what he did say is in the
reaching of the masses. Besides the
t;ubjects he has submitted to Con
gress for consideration are respon
sive to the people's anticipation of
a betterment of present conditions.
It, may be said in the fullest sig
nifloance of the term that Woodrow
Wilson is the President of the peo
pie with whom he is in full sympa
thy. In his official personality Pres
ident Wilson has impressed Con
giess with the importance of its
duty, and instead of Congress con
trolling the President, President
Wilson has controlled Congress in
the cordiality of the spirit which is
the opposite of dictation.
It is the Caucasian's opinion that
Woodrow Wilson is developing into
a. executive of this Nation that will
.title him as being the greatest of
i; relidents of the United States
st se the days of Washington, Jef
rmeson and Jackson.

VJRIETY IN
WINTER FIRS
Fine Pelts Are Now, Made Up In
Many New and Striking Styles
For the Fashionable Woman's
Wintes Wardrobe.
T HIS may be said to be a
season. Furs of all kinds are
worn in every imaginable
way. The woman who can
not afford a fur set shows a hat trim
med with bands of fur or a gown on
which it is a charming embellishment
Fur there must be somewhere.
For the woman who seeks for nov
elty there is a wide range of choice.
Everything is modish from leopard to
mouse skin, but when choosing furs it
is as well to bear in mind their wear
Sing properties. Fox, for instance.
wears very badly. Sable, astrakhan
and Persian lamb are durable, while
bearskin, though moderate in price,
wears better than almost any other
fur.
Of late years furs have become more
and more expensive. The really better
kinds are quite beyond the reach of
the woman with an average purse.
Happily nowadays, with the vogue for
fur trimming, the woman of small
- means can work wonders with just
the tiniest little bit of real fur.
This year white and black furs are
in vogue. Squirrel is very popular, and
S its soft gray tints are becoming. It
is moderate in price also, though dear
er than it was several years ago owing
n to its popularity. A pretty squirrel
s stole and muff may be had for quite a
moderate outlay.
L What more useful garment can there
p be than a long gray squirrel coat? Its
price is not ruinous, and, although it is
not the most expensive of furs, nothing
is more becoming to a woman with
S dark hair and a fresh complexion.
Chinchilla, Persian lamb, seal, leepard
skin, moleskin, ermine, Siberlan mouse
and pony are among the popular furs.

HINTS FOR THE
BUSY HOUSEWIFE
Bracelet Spool For Holding
Yarn or Thread.
Women who do crocheting, knitting
and other forms of needlework know
how aggravatingly the yarn can tangle
up and the spool or ball roll away. A
Washington man has designed a brace
let spool that prevents all this. The
spool is revolvably mounted on a
bracelet, which opens at the bottom and
which can be clasped on the wrist in
an instant. The yarn or thread feeds
over the back of the hand into the
needle, and there is no slack and no
possibility of tangling and the conse
quent tedious untangling. The spool is
held lightly in two spring clasps, sc
that it can readily be removed and a
fresh spool put in its place. Being
open at the bottom, the bracelet will
fit any wrist, and it is made with a
I finish that will not tarnish.
ROast Turkey.
A turkey should be dressed and
cleaned at least twelve hours before
iuing. Make filling of soft part of
stale bread. Pour over this hot melted
butter; season with salt, pepper, sage
and onion if liked; mix well together;
salt well the inside of turkey and fill
and sew up. Fill the space from which
you took the crop. Do not pack the
illing or it will be heavy. Place the
turkey in pan with breast up; push the
legs up under the skin; fasten with'
small skewers to the bone of the rump.
Turn the wings back; run another
skewer through them and body of tur
key. Tie legs together; wrap twice
around the end of skewer; bring it up
the back; wrap it around the ends of
the wing skewer and tie tightly. Put
little pieces of butter over the turkey
itf it is not very fat. Baste every ten
minutes. When done remove strings
and skewers, place on hot platter and
garnish.
Possum and Sweet Potatoes.
Skin possum carefully; remove head
and feet and draw. Wash thoroughly
in cold water, salt in and out side and

Llewellyn and Ghee were rivals for
the p,)sition on the varsity team this

Plans of the Colonels.
There is a chance that the Louisville
Colouels will take a spring training
trip to Florida in 1914. A story was
published in a Louisville paper during
the ptist week to the effect that the
location had already been selected and
that said location is Fort Meyer. Colo
nel Wathen has not confirmed this re
port as yet, but he admits that he is
contge.plating such a venture.
Other American association teams
have gone south for their spring train
ing in the past, but only one has made
the trip to Florida and done the thing
up right. That club was Toledo,
Charley Somers taking the Mud Hens
along with his crowd of Naps to Pen
sacola, but the final showing of the
club doesn't prove that the jaunt was
beneficial in the- least.
Owner Wathen hasn't made a deft
nite announcement of the proposed trip
for the simple reason that he hasn't
decided whether it will be advisable.
He has two or three spots in Florida
picked out and is going over the propo
sition from every angle. If the colonel
can land a suitable location it is highly
probable that his club will be taken
south for the early workouts.
Pro Golf Tourney Abandoned.
Plans for a tournament open to pro
fessional golfers residing within a
radius of 100 miles of Chicago have
been put in storage for the winter.
Owing to the lateness of the season
Tom Bendelow, who had the matter
in charge, found that it would be im
possible to get a representative field,
and the tournament was dropped until
next year.
President Douglas Smith of the new
Winnetka Country club, near Chicago,
announced that the course would be
ready for play in the early party of
July. The clubhouse is in- course of
construction and will be ready by next
June.
The officials of the club are: Doug
las Smith, president; Robert Steven
son, Jr., and Archibald W. Shaw, vice
presidents; W. Walling, secretary and
treasurer. The board of governors in
eludes W. G. Hubbard, Jr.. George
Higginson, Jr., N. Landon Hoyt, Per
cival Manchester, Tom Taylor, Jr., and
Rowland D. Whitman.
Williams May Succeed Sharpe.
It is rumored that Dr. H. L. Wil
liams, present football coach at Min
nesota,.is to be engaged to succeed
Sharpe as the head of the gridiron
staff at Cornell. There are big influ
ences at work to oust Dr. Williams
from his position with the Gophers,
and it is almost equally certain that
Cornell men are not entirely satisfied
with the way football matters are be
4tg conducted at Cornell.
it is asserted that Dr. Williams will
come to Ithaca in the event of his be
ing able to get Minnesota to release
him from his contract, which has two
more years to run.
