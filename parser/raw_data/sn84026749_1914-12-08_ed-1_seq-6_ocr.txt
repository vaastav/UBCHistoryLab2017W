In Porto Rico the missionary
played physician with good effect.
Tor years mission workers in non
Christian lands have healed physical
is well as spiritual wounds. To
ay Christianity seems to be bent on
cturning to medical mission work,

ment Philadelphia physicians and hy
giene instructors are co-operating
ith the clergymen that plan to
stablish clinics. The movement, of
oursc, is subject to limitations. The
tate must be in control of the work.
Efforts must be made to eliminate
hose that would make the clinics
merely experimental laboratories,
lut these church clinics can do much,
.oth for the community in general
nd the churches themselves.
THE POLITICS OF IT.
Senator Lodge lost no time intro
ducing his resolution for inquiry in
o the condition of national defenses,
enator Lewis of Illinois, the Demo
ratic whip, and one of the men rec
gnized as speaking always for the
dministration, has promptly coun
ored by introducing another resolu-.
ion, which evidently is intended to
e the official plan of the Adminis
ration. The Lodge measure pro
ides for a commission of national
afety, comprising three Senators,
hree Congressmen, and three mem
bers to be named by the President.
The Lewis plan is for the Commit
tees on Naval Affairs and on Mili
tary Affairs, of the two houses, to
make the investigation within their
respective spheres.
There is plenty to indicate that
ho Lewis investigation would be
managed so as to produce a political
erdict; it would go into the history
f army and navy appropriations
Juring the long period of Republican
ontrol of the Government, and
would be directed to demonstrating
he responsibility of the Republican
tarty for bad conditions that may
xist.
Nobody need object to putting a
rull measure of blame on tlie Re
publican party, for those deficiencies
or which that party is responsible.
Jut the inquiry should not be politi
aL A quest for political capital will
to the army and navy more harm
han good. There has been and is too
nuch politics in the management of
hese instruments of national de
'"nse. No political party has a rec
rd of which to be proud, in this
latter of handling army and navy,
'oth the army and nay, in propor
on to their size and efficiency, are
oonumenis to the extravagance of
mencan Government, and that fact
anno' be blinKed. If one party trie
o make the inquiry partisan in one
irec'ion, the other will be very sure
o make it partisan in the other; and
the end there will be no better
suit than a huge burden of na
onal disgust.
This i a situation that has need
be taken seriously; to be dealt
'h as a problem of the United
ates, rot of the Republican party
id the Democratic party. Let
oth parties be honest with each
ther urd with the people. Let
'icm i -rrrsia"d at the outset that
e y v i'1 not very long or very ef-
rt. .iv fool the people, anyhow.
" n -m admit their shortcomings

TRANK WRIT DENIED.
Some hope that the United States
upreme ' ourt would grant the writ

or- -f both Justice Lamar and
atti-e Holmes, when the writ was

inery aspects of the case.

should be favorable to him, violence

A'tcr a studv of cor pliafe of tlio
Frank case for weeks. I am as satis
lied of this man's innocence of this
crime as 1 am of mv own innocenv of
it. The Judge who trifd Frank declared
from the bench that lie could not make
up his mind from the evidence that
Frank was Ruilty. I do not know r.ny
one who lias ever studied the case who
has not arrived at the conclusion that
Frank's sruilt Is impossible under the
evidence adduced aKainst him. I tried
to discover one lawyer in Atlanta ho
believed him suilty. I was curious to
know on what lie would base his judg
ment. I found onlv one who was In
doubt of Frank's Innocence. Mil who
wa certain that there was no sufficient
evidence against him. Fven this iaw
er snoke of Frank's trial as a dis
graceful fnrce. "Xo Jew in modern
times." said a distinguished 'awycr and
a law partner of the man who prose
cuted Frank, "has been persecuted aa
this Jew has been.'
But the Supreme Court, whose
business is not with the evidence, but
with the forms of law,- finds that it
has no occasion to interfere. Georgia
justice claims Frank for its own; and
if Georgia justice chooses to send
him to the scaffold, the highest court
in -the land cannot interfere with the
knotting of the noose.
There remains the possibility of a
reprieve by Governor Slaton. In his
hands rests the only power that can
now be exercised to stay the execu
tion of the death sentence. Georgia
has a prison commission, which in
such cases is authorized to examine
the claims for executive clemency,
and make a recommendation. There
after, the governor has the power of
pardon or reprieve.
It would seem that, in view of the
expressions of both judges of the
United States Supreme Court who
have indicated opinions in any wise
reaching to the merits of the whole
affair, the governor is more than
justified in using his power at least
to insure Frank the utmost chance.
Here a man stands in the shadow-of
the scaffold, while most people who
have thoroughly studied his case de
clare belief that he is innocent.
There is strong probability that if
he goes to his death, and if in fact
he is innocent, the truth will one
day come ouj. It is inconceivable
that the State of Georgia will risk
responsibility for such a travesty on
justice. It is beyond understanding
that in all the judicial processes of
this country, so often and effectively
used to help the guilty escape, there
can be found no avenue through
which a more than reasonable doubt
may be translated into humane ac
tion.
THE HALF HOLIDAYS.
President Wilson, having been
asked to issue an executive order di
recting two Saturday half-holidays
for the Government departments,
finds that he has no authority to
comply. It was asked that these
half-day vacations from duty be au
thorized, in order that Government
employes might do their Christmas
shopping early, in daylight, and un
der conditions that would give en
couragement to local merchants in
their effort to maintain short hours
even during the holiday trading sea
son. It was pointed out that stores
closing early might deprive many
Government workers of the privilege
of shopping under satisfactory con
ditions, unless these holiday periods
were granted. It was, in short, a
request that the Government make a
modest concession in order to co
operate with the merchants in the
effort to relieve employes of the
necessity for working long and hard
hours during the last weeks before
Christmas.
The President finds no authority
for such an order. It is explained
that in recent years, by executive or
der, the Saturday half-holiday has
been granted to the departments,
but that it has been rather ultra
vires; there is no law authorizing it,
but Presidents have taken the bull
by the horns and directed it any
how, on the theory that the Govern-
j ment ought not to be hopelessly be
hind other employers in treatment of
working forces.
But in the absence of authority,
the President feels misgivings about
assuming it too often. So he pre
fers not to assume it in the instance
of the Christmas-season Saturdays.
The wonder is, not that the Presi
dent declines to interpose an author
ity he does not possess), but that Con
gress should sojlong have failed to
repose that authority in him. The
case illustrates the backwardness of
Congressional treatment of a great
set of social questions with which
it must deal. There is not another
city in the country the size of Wash-
inRton, where the midsummer nan-
holiday on Saturday is not a well es-
tablished institution. Businessmen
iatcil their adontion of the rule. They
found it good business, and they did
it. ;
If it is good business for other.
employers to establish such a rule, '
it must be good business for the
Government. Everybody agrees that

ing the necessary authority in such erations at that time, there was
cases in the Executive, and making great danger that either concession
it broad enough to permit him to use
his discretion in such cases as this
of the two holiday-season Saturdays.
THE MESSAGE.
It is no longer a message; it is
"The Address of the President." On
the whole, it is to be hoped that it'
will always remain an address rath
er than a message. Messages got to
be so long and tiresome that nobody
read them in the newspaper or lis
tened to them when they were read
in the dreadful monotone of the
reading clerks of the houses of Con
gress; provided, of course, that some
humanitarian without fear of lesc
majeste didn't interpose to prevent
even the reading by the clerk.
President Wilson has made the
message into an address, delivered
in person; and he has limited it to
lengths that have made it quite pos
sible for auditors and readers to fol-
Llow it through to the end, and under
stand what he was saying.
The address given today is the
longest Mr. Wilson has yet made be
fore a Congress. It comes at a time
when the whole world will take a
peculiar interest in its observations,
and it indicates that the President
wants one more strenuous perform
ance from his faithful Sixty-third
Congress. If it has been hoping for
a little relaxation of pefssure, it is
disappointed.
The President wants the program
of conservation legislation, begun in
the last session, completed; as it
should be. He stands firmly by his
proposal for a Government merchant
marine, legislation for which end is
pending; and he adds as an extra
inducement, that whenever the con
ditions in our foreign trade arc such
that profits may be made from it,
the Government should withdraw
and let private enterprise earn the
profits. Perhaps it will be found
practical to let the Government go
in on that basis of sharing the losses
but not the profits. It will be gen
erally doubted. If the Government
goes into the overseas shipping busi
ness, it is quite likely to remain in.
The effectiveness and general satis
faction of Government operation of
the steamship line controlled by the
Panama Railway Company have es
tablished pretty firmly the notion
that the Government does that sort
of thing rather well. It is not at
all likely that when the time comes
for profits instead of losses, the
Government would be disposed to
step out. At any rate, in present
conditions, the country needs the
ships. The experiment of giving
American registration to foreign
ships has had some trial. The pros
pect of getting satisfactory Jesuits
from it should be reasonably clear by
this time. If it is not going to meet
the national emergency and on the
whole it does not appear likely to do
so then Government ships are very
certain to be tried, soorer or later.
The need of them, or of some other
ships, under the American flag, Is
great, and every week of expanding
foreign trade makes it greater.
There will be disappointment in
some quarters at the President's
pointed suggestion that he is not
ready to help pass rural credits leg
islation. This means, of course, that
nothing will be done in this direc-
tion. The proposals have not been
so far formulated and crystallized
that the Executive feels satisfied to
let such an important measuic be
written into the laws, it must l)CjOSSf.,i ,lt-ross th- over.

possible: but the need is now and!
serious.
Coming to national defenses, the
President opens the subject around
1V (liii onocin cn.ime mcL' litil
to nivot. Arc wc iircnarcd for war?
Of course, he pays, we are not ready
to put a nation of trained men in
the field. And he adds that "we
never shall be in time of peace, fo
long as wc retain our present politi
cal principles and institutions." Per
haps the President If not as famil

zenana nas given a preuy complete
demonstration that preparedness for

our people away from their neces-

or a postponement of peace might
be necessary. The complications of
Europe saved us with a whole skin;
and the whole skin was all we car
ried away from Ghent. Not a con
cession to the demands with which
wc had gone into the war.
Did we "find the means" to defend
ourselves at that time? The scars
on the old central section of the Cap
itol building, burned by the British
invaders, will give one answer.
"Wc will not a'sk our young men
to spend the best years of their lives
making soldiers of themselves," de
clares the President. "There is an
other sort of energy in us. It will
know how to declare itself and make
itself effective should occasion arise."
Will it? How will it, if it is not
trained to that very end? The an
swer of the President is that the na
tional militia should be trained, to
the extent of teaching military rudi
ments to men who volunteer to be
taught. This suggests continuation
of the old militia system that hns
been inadequate. It does not sug
gest establishing a proper, scientific
reserve of the regular army, which
is the accepted system in other coun
tries. Seemingly the President is
prepared flatly to oppose the reserve
proposals of General Wotherspoon,
recently put forward so effectively.
If that is his attitude, it will occa
sion widespread regret among peo
ple who honestly believe in prepared
ness without militarism.

Canying Weapons Allowed by Con.
stitution.
To the Editor of the Mall- Ha;:
While recognizing the dangers In
cident to the promiscuous carrying ot
weapons, the present outcry in this clt.
for legislation Invites the question
In our efforts to eradlcato that evil arc
we not InvIUng one that is far greate.
In that it strikes a blow at the consti
tutional rights of the cltlzenT
In Cooley's "Principles of Constit i
tlonal Law," recognized as one of t i
highest authorities on the subject, wr
find "By the Second Amendment to tn;
Constitution it is declared that 'a well
regulated mllltla being necessary to th'
security of a free. State, the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall
not be infringed.' The right Is
general. It may be supposed from the
phraseology of this provision that the
right to keep ancT-bear arms was only
guaranteed to the mllltla; but thl
would be an Interpretation not war
ranted by the Intent. The militia
consists of those persons who,
under the law, are liable to the per
formance of military duty, and are of
ficered and enrolled lor service when
called upon. But the lay may make
provision for the enrollment of all who
are fit to perform military duty, or for
a small number only, or it may wliollv
omit to make any provision at all; and
ir the right were limited to those en
rolled, the purpose of this guaranf
mlght be defeated altogether by the ac
tion or neglect to act or the govern
ment it wa intended to hold In cheek.
The meaning or the provision undoubt
edly Is that the people from whom the
mllltln. must be taken shall have the
-ight to keep and bear arms, and they
need no permission or regulation of
'aw for the purpose. But this enables
the Government to have a well-regulated
mllltla, for to bear arms Implies
jomething more than the mere keeping:
it Implies the learning to handle and
use them In a way that 'makes those
who keep them ready lor their effi
cient use.
it Implies the right to meet for vol
untary discipline in arms, observing In
:olng so the laws of public order.-
It Is clear that ir the keeping of
irmj may be prevented as proposed,
that they cannot be used as suggested
above. Furthermore, some form of
weapon may be fould In almost every
home for the protection ot that home
1 right that Is never challenged, except
n times of riot and threatened insur
rection. If the right to keep arras is
conceded under the provisions or the
Constitution. It would seem that onl by
i further nmendment to that document
can the rleht to bear arms be denied.
RESPECTER OF CONSTITI'TION.
One Way to Be Prepared For War.
To the Editor of the Mall Bag:
There seems to be alarm In some Quar
ters as to our military unpreparedness
In case of armed invasion by a for
eign power, which some believe we may
have to face when the end comes to
the present conflict in Europe.
It may be true Uiat we are in danger,
and that we are 111 fitted to defend our
selves, and that there are dlfficulUes
In the way of raising an army on short
noUce sufficient to maie us safe. No
country in the world can so quickly
raise volunteer forces, but raw- recruits;
however brave, are not the proper de
fense against trained troops who hav
seen hard service and smelt blood.
A friend of mine has an idea, and 1
am sertdlng it to the Mall Bag for con
sideration. Like myself, he Is oTrlend
of militarism, but he foresees the day
when Young America .will hae. to go
to the front to defend us: so. he sas
that military tralnlnsr should begin in
the common schools and other Institu
tions of learning which now have no til
ing of the kind. His idea is that all
male students over twelve rears of agc
hi all schools having over fifty such
students, should have one day in the
week devoted to their military train-In-
under the direction of a Faired
slatesTrniy officer Friday to : "
ed. In order that the ooys might have
two days' rest before resumin- their
studies after the drill. Schools might
combine to furnish enough boys for a
battalion. In order to save P"?.-,
this would give retired army officers
a chance to stretch their limbs and get
I UtUe fresh air. He thinks that in
this way boys would become soldiers al
most wfthout knowing it. at very little
smenae to the Government, and pro
vfd? many regiments, of fine material
for actual service In time of need. Most
.ys Are fond of "soldiering' and it
would add zest to their school life,
while detracUne from Its monotony
Perhaps the boys would learn as much
m four days as they would in five and
remember it better for the spice of
variety afforded by the military ex
Mrience Our high school cadets are
mode"s of mlllwr,- material, and an
earlv begtnnlne at the business, such
aftoherf outlined, would maXe It easier
for them to attain excellence in their
drills. The higher Instltut ons night
turn out officers, of which there u (al
ways., lack, under present dU.ons.
