Elliott and Wilson served time together
"In the penitentiary at Canon City, Colo.,

The pictures of both robbers adorn the
rogues' gallery and Chief Donahue believes
the men are wanted for crimes Irfc other
cities. They are both western crooks and
arrived In Omaha or.ly a few days ago.
Mr. Sonnenberg said of the affair:

fireman, Mr. Gross, then came In the door
and took the revolver away from Morrlsey. ,
Mr. Gross and I then chased the men

taken to the station and gave the officers
all the Information possible, including a
complete description of his partner In
crime. Wilson Is described as being about
26 years of age, Ave feet eight inches in
height and rather slender. He was wear
ing a block derby hat, dark coat and faded
light trousers and dark gray overcoat. He
Is smooth-faced and of dark complexion.
Detectives and officers were unanimous
in the belief that If it had not been for the
efforts of Fireman Gross Elliott would
have escaped. Gross took the affair very
coolly and said he was only sorry he
hadn't wounded the man who shot at him
so as to prevent his escape.
Plan Robbery la Prison.
In conversation with Chief of Detectives
Savage Friday afternoon Elliott sid hi
and Wilson had planned the robbery of
BonnenberE's store when they were serving
lime together In the penitentiary at Canyon
City. The two men came to Omaha Novem
ber 10, after being released a short time
before from the penitentiary and roomed
at the Lyons hotel. Thirteenth and Dodgo
streets. They had been advised by fellow
criminals that the job would be compara
tively easy to pull off and two attempts to
that end were made. They went to the
store Tuesday morning with the intention
of robbing the place, but were deterred
by the presence of several customers. A
second call was made Wednesday morning
but this also was futile on account of
others In the store
Elliott said he overslept Thursday morn
Ing until It was too late to attempt the I
. . . . -,, m . v ,
robbery, and by nerving themselves up to
the task by the use of drugs, to which
both men are addicted, the robbery wa
consummated as planned Friday.
The diamonds snd other loot stolen by
the robb.rs were returned to Mr. Sunnen
berg, and It Is believed every article taken
by the thieves has been recovered. Elliott
said he had agreed with his partner to
carry the spoils, as he was the fnstest
runner, and If Wilson had been captured It
wt'.s agreed Elliott should use the money
received from the sale of ths stolen go.ids
to Sid In the defense of his partner. Both
men are dope fiends snd a quantity of
laudanum and gum opium was found on
Elliott.

HA1SE, FOR SPEAKER AND VICE PRESIDENT
These Ofllclals Will RecelTe 15,000
Each nnd Cabinet Members
f 12,000 Debate Precedes
Action.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.-The hour of
representatives was brought face to face
today with the proposition to Increase tue
salaries of its own members, senators, the
vioe president, the speaker of the house and
members of the president's cabinet while
the legislative, executive and Judicial ap
propriation bill was under consideration,
and while It passed favorably on the prop
osition as applied to other officials, refused
to make the order for members of either
house of congress.
Mr. I.lttauer of New York, who had
given notice that he would offer the amend
ments to the legislative bill necessary to
accomplish the proposed Increase Immedl
atcly secured the floor after the prcvoui
question hud been ordered cn the b.ll and
presented an amendment raising the sal
aries of the vice president and the speaker
of the house to J12.000 per annum each. He

speaker of the house and said everybody
recognized that the duties were arduous
and the pay unequal to the position.
Ask.
More Pay for Clerk.
Mr. Underwood (Ala.) said he was op-
posed to any further Increase of salaries j message he said If It were found Inexpedl
alung the line of legislation and legislative ent to nass the senate bill, a measure should
olTlces. He further said he believed the
salaries of the minor clerks of the gove. n -
rnent sh.uld be ii. creased on account cf the
Increased cot of living. His conientl ji was
that salaries are paid to members of con
g:ess so that a poor man mlyhl co:ne to
congress and represent his constituents Ho
said he would not contend that a congress
man could live In Washington and keep
pace with modern society.
Mr. Fltzgetald (N. Y.) said he would vote
for the Increase even If tho price paid was
political oblivion. He called attention to
the salary paid the mayor of Ne-v York,
and also to the pay of the comptroller of
that city, and Inslbted that the vice prest-
dent and the sneaker should be puld sal
arles commensurate with the dignity of
their offices.
After other speeches the amendment was
adopted by a vote cf 211 to 61. the opposi
tion falling to secure votes enough to call
the ayes and noes.
Mr. Litlauer then Introduced another
amendment fixing the salaries of cabinet
officers at IliOW) per ananum after March 4,
1907. '
During the course of his remarks on this
amendment Mr. Littauer held up a large
picture of a president of a base ball asso
ciation, whose salary had been Increased
from J10.000 to 113,000 a year.ar.d contra ted
with the salaries paid members of the
cabinet. The amendment wa opposed by
Mr. Mann till.), but was adopted by a vote
of 304 to 00.
Proposition Voted Dawn
Mr. Llttauer, who ret res to private life
with the close of the present congress, then
offered a provision raising the salaries of
senators and members of congress, dele
gates snd the resident commissioner of
Porto Rico to $7,600 and on agreement the
time for the Increase to begin was fixed
on Mrch 4. 14.
Mr. Boutell (III.) said he was opposed t
the proposition to increase salaries of mem
bers, but was glad to vote to increase the
compensation of the speaker, vije presi
dent and members of the cabinet.
Representative Clark (Flu.) was accorded
sn ovation when be announced that he de
sired to discuss the - question from the
standpoint of a poor man. He called atten

adequate.
I believe," he said, "there are not ten
men on this floor who In private conversa
tion will say; 'The salary Is Inadequate,
the Increase is right,' but some say: 'I
Cannot afford to vote for It.' "
"For God's sake 1st us answer the great
dally papers. , who are challenging our
courage to go upon the record by our votes
before all the country," was the concluding
appeal.
Representatives Lamar (FU.), Oronna

posed the amendment: Grosvenor (O.) and
Sims and Gaines of Tennessee favored It.
The amendment was defeated by a vote of
108 to 188.

soldiers of the Twenty-ttfth regiment of
colored Infantry.
That he will send the congress a speelnl
message advocating the passage of a ship
subsidy measure at the present session was
stated by several members of the house to-
day. It was said that the president had de
clared that the rccommendutlon In his an
nual message was misunderstood. In that
J be pnssed to provide for a few linos to
i South America ports. He did not mean to
minimize the Importance of other features
of the bill. It Is understood, and now pur-
p&sea to correct any false Impression that
may have been gained by the public.
No decision as to the committee's attl'ude
on shin subsidy was reached at the caucus
of the republican members cf the house on
merrhnn ma'lne and flsherlee held tod iy.
After diecusslns: the amended Onlliner
bill the republicans took nr action, but de
elded to call a meetlnsf of th committee for
January 7, when a vote of the full commit-
tee will be taken It Is believed thit Prest-
j dent Roosevelt's wishes In the matter w II
have been communicated to the house be
fore that time.
The amendments to irtf mil drafted by
Representative Grosvenor eliminate rargo
subsidy and limit the government's aid to
