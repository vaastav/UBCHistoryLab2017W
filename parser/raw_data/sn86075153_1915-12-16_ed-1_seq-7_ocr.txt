Tom Stout's Weekly Letter
An interesting, Instructive and Unbiased "Who's Who and Why" of
people and Events at The Nation's Capitol
Washington, Dec. 17-For better or
x worse, for good or ill, for prepar
» c ,r pacifism, the sixty-fourth
edI of tiie United States is duly
'SbM and ready for work. The
nine formalities were attended to
Z Monday when Champ Clark
Missouri was elected speaker of the
; ^ for the third time and two thous
and bills
is were introduced by the mem
_______ame body. On Tuesday,
J'-Hdent Wilson came up to the capi
1 and delivered his annual message in
person" on the state of the Union" — ^
irorl even a casual reading of that mes
sage anyone can easily discover that,
S ' the judgment of the chief executive,
J! e state of the Union might be mater
'jl improved by the enactment of
' .rious and sundry laws therein recom
mended.
The opening of congerss this year
v as n0 t unlike that of previous years
although it was enlivened by some
ecial features. For instance, there
was the return of Uncle Joe Cannon
who. despite his eighty years, did the
comeback act and was received with
the acclaim due one who has served
thirty-eight years in one position, a
record for service never attained by
any other man in the history of our
government. The newest member
there appeared not one whit happier
than did the grizzled veteran from
Danville and his personal popularity
even among his bitterest political ad
versaries was attested by the steady
stream of friends, old and new, to his
seat to greet and congratulate him.
All day long he smiled and joked and
smoked and otherwise manifested the
joy that was in him at being once
more on his old stamping grounds.
While the senate proceeded with a
semblance of dignity and decorum,
the house was as tumultous as usual
and transacted its initial business in
such confusion as doubtless to lead
any person witnessing for the first
time the activities of that branch of
the national congress to wonder how
anything could be accomplished in
such a bedlam.
But despite the turmoil caused by
more than four hundred members
greeting each other after their nine
months' vacation, the formalities were
disposed of within two or three hours
and the usual committee comprising
the majority and minority leaders and
the chairman of the appropriation
committee was dispatched to the
White House to inform the president

that congress was duly organized and
ready to receive such communications
as he desired to deliver to it
More than ordinary interest attend
ed the visit of the president to the
capitol to deliver his annual message
With more than half the world all top^
sy-turvy as a result of the war and
our own country entangled to a cer
tain extent in the violent upheaval
which may yet draw us into the mael
strom of that terrific conflict, the men
who have to deal with the questions
growing out of such an unprecedented
conflict awaited with expectancy the
recommendations of the nation's chief
as to the course he would have them
pursue.
The setting was fully befitting the
impressiveness of the occasion. With
but very few exceptions, the members
of the two houses, 533 of them, were
in their seats in the great hall of the
house. Members of the president's
cabinet were also on the floor of the
house. Representatives of many of
the great nations of the world were
seated in the diplomatic gallery and
all of the other galleries were crowd
ed to their capacity by those fortunate
enough to secure the coveted tickets.
Thousands of the less fortunate
crowded the corridors and even the
approaches to the capitol.
As the president entered, escorted
by a joint committee from the two
houses, the members rose and gave
him a most enthusiastic reception.
Republicans joined the democrats in
thus greeting the chief executive of
the country. When the cheering had
subsided somewhat, Speaker Clark
brought down his heavy gavel and
said: "Gentlemen of the senate and
house of representatives, I present to
you the president of the United
States."
It was the longest message that
President Wilson has ever delivered
to congress, consuming nearly an
hour of time. Delivered without the
slightest oratorical effort, every word
of the message was easily heard in
the most remote corners of the visit
ors' galleries. Here and there the
speaker was interrupted by outbursts
of applause. Just once did the presi
dent display an intensity of feeling
and punctuate his words with vigor
ous gestures and that was when he
reached that portion of his address
dealing with the conspiracies among
certain individuals to humiliate and
discredit the country of their adop

tion. He clinched his fist and fairly
snapped out the words as he urged
that laws be enacted which will pro
vide for the crushing out of such con
spiracies. That his words fell upon
sy mpathetic ears was demonstrated
when a rumble of applause from the
floor and gallery followed his incisive
vehement excoriation of Americans
whom he termed untrue to the vows
of their citizenship. It was the one
dramatic episode of an occasion which
may become historic.
The stage is now all set for the
work of congress which is confronted
with questions of greater moment
than have been faced by any previous
congress in half a century. There
will be a few days of respite during
which the machinery will be thor
oughly perfected for a session which
must almost inevitably run far into
the summer. That it will be product
ive of much illuminating discussion
and not a little bitterness seems now
assured. Knowing how vitally the
people of our state must be interest
ed in national affairs at this critical
period of our history, I shall, as time
and public duties permit, give through
the medium of these letters, my own
interpretation of events as they occur
here at the seat of our national gov
ernment.
