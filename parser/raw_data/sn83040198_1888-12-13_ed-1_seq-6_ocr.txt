"Washington, Dec 3. Congress opened
sat 1:30 to-day for its second session. The
President's message was presented to both
douses and read.
President Cleveland opens his message to
Oongress by calling attention to the fact that
with the expiration of the present session of
congress the first century of our constitutional
lavatory is completed. -The time, admonishes us
So soberly inquire whether in the past we hare
always closely kept in the course of safety, and
whether we have before us a way plain and
ear which leads to happiness and perpetuity.
"When the experiment of our Government was
undertaken the chart adopted for our guidance
was the Constitution. Departure from the
tines Ihere laid down is failure. It is only by a
strict adherence to the direction they indicate,
sand by restraint within the limitatio s they
Jar, l b at we can furnish proor to the world of
"the fitness of the American people for self-gov
ernment. , ,
The equal and exact justice of which we
ttoost as the underlying principle of our insti
tutions should not be confined to the relations
nf our citizen - to each other. The Government
itself is under bond to the American people
Chat in the' exercise of its functions and powers
it will deal with tbe body of our citizens in a
manner scrupulously honest and fair and abso
lutely just. We view with pride and satisfac
tion the bright picture of our country's growth
sand prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny de
weiops a somber shading. Upon more careful
inspection we find the wealth and luxury of our
cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness.
-A crowded and constantly increasing urban pop
ulation suggests the imppverisbment of rural
sections and discontent with agricultural pur
suits. We discover that the fortunes realized by our
snanufacturerers are no longer 6olely the re
ward of sturdy industry and enlighted foresight,
tXMit they result from the discrimi ating favor of
the Government and are 'largely built upon un
he exaction from the masses of our people.
The gulf between employers and employed is
constantly widening and classes aro rapidly
forming, one comprising tbe very rich and pow--rfal,
while in the other are found the toiling

Corporations which should be the carefully re
trained creatures of the law and the servants
of the people are fast becomin t the people's
musters. Still congratulating ourselves upon
the wealth and prosperity of our country, and
(Complacently contemplating every incident of
change inseparable from the conditions,
W is . our duty as patriotic citi
zens to inquire at the present stage of our pro
gress how the bond of the Government .made
with the people has been kept and performed.
Instead of limiting the tribute , drawn from our
Citizens to the necessities of its economical ad
.tninistratlon, the Government persists tn ex
acting from the people millions which, unap
ttdied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury.
"This fin grant Injustice and this breach of faith
and obligation add to extortion the danger at

country from the legitimate channels of busi

staffer from such discrimination, we will realize
ne fact that the beneficent purpose of our
Government, dependent upon the patsiotism
sand contentment of our people, is endangered.
Communism is a hateful thing, and a menace
o peace and organized government. But .the
communism of combined wealth and capital,
he outgrowth of overweaning cupidity and
elnshness which insidiously undermines the
justice and integrity of free institutions, is not
itess dangerous than the communism of op
jjressed poverty and toil, which, exasperated
toy injustice and discontent, attacks with wild
disorder the citadel of rule.
.- He mocks the people who proposes that the
Government shall protect the rich and that

.Any intermediary between the people and their
Government, or the least delegation of the care
and protection the Government owes to the
bumblest citizen in the land, makes the boast'
of free institutions a glittering delusion and the
pretended boon of American citizenship a
"nameless imposition.
A just and sensible revision of our tariff laws
should be made for the relief of "those of our
countrymen who suffer under present condi
Xkms. Such a revision should receive the sup
Tport of all who love that justice and equality
lue to American citizenship ; of all who realize
-that in this justice and equality our Govern

of all who - believe that the content

-Chat the General Government is the fountain of

against the Government and in favor of
Torivate of private claims and interests, the
qosaal rules and limitation of business principles
said just dealing should be waived.
These ideas have been unhappily much en
' ou raged by legislative acquiescence, - Relief
drom contracts made with the Government is
. mxIIt accorded in favor of the citizen, as the
-failure to support claims against the Govern-
satat by proof is often supplied by no better
consideration than the weaiu 01 mo uovern
nent and the poverty of the claimant. Gratui-
tf. in the form of pensions . are gran tea upon
ma nther real eround than the needy condition
t mfrjaaaat. or for reasons less valid, and
iarre sums are expended .for public buildings
and other improvements upon representations
scarcely claimed to be related , to public needs
and necessities. Tne extent to which the con
sideration of such- matters subordinate and
postpone action upon subjects of great public
importance but involving no special, private or
partisan interest should arrest attention and
lead to reformation. t . . .
A few of the numerous illustrations of this
condition may be stated:
The crowded conditioa of the calendar of the
Supreme Court, and the delay to suitors and de
nial of justice resulting therefrom, have been
strongly urged upon the attention of the Con
gress, with a plan for the relief of the situation
approved by those well able to judge of its mer
its. Whi e this subject remains without effect
ive consideration, many laws have been passed
providing for the holding of terms of inferior
courts at places to suit the convenience of loc a
ities or to lay the foundation of an application
for the erection of a new public building.
Repeated recommendations have been sub
mitted for, the amendment and change of the
laws relating to our public lands, so that their
spoliation and diversion to other uses than as
homes for honest settlers might be prevented.
While a measure to meet this conceded . neces
sity of reform remains awaiting the action of
the Congress many claims to the public lands
and applications for their donation in favor of
States and individuals have been allowed.
A plan in aid of Indian management, recom
mended by those well informed as containin
valuable features in furtherance of the solution
of the Indian problem, has thus far failed of
legislative sanction, while grants of doubtful
expediency to railroad companies, permitting
them to pass through Indian reservations, have
greatly multiplied.
Tho propriety and necessity of the erection
of one or more prisons for the confinement of
United States convicts and a post-office, build
ing in the National capital are not disputed,
but these needs yet remain unanswered, while
scores of public buildings have .been erected
where their necessity for public purpose is not
apparent. . , . t
A revision of our pension laws should be
made, which would rest upon just principles
and provide for every worthy applicant. But
while our general pension laws remain con
fused and imperfect, hundreds f t our private
pension laws are annually passed which are
the sources of unjust discrimination and' pop
ular demoralization.
Appropriation bills for the support of the
Government are defaced by items and provis
ions to meet private ends and it is freely as
serted by responsible and experienced parties
that a bill . appropriating money for public in
ternal improvement would fail to meet with
favor, unless it contained items more for local
and private advantage than for public benefit.
These statements can be much emphasized
by an ascertainment of the proportion of
Federal legislation, which either bears upon
its face its private character or which, upon
examination, develops such a motive power.
And yet the people wait and expect from their
chosen representatives such patriotic action as
will advance the welfare of the entire country
and this expectation can only be answered by the
performance of public duty with unselfish pur
pose. -
Our mission among the nations of the earth
and our success in aocomp ihing the work God
has given the American people to do, - require
of those- intrusted with the making and execu
tion of our laws, perfect devotion, above all
other things, to the public g- od. This devotion
will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of
constitutional limitations of Federal power and
to persistently check the Increasing tendency
to extend the scope of Federal legislation into
the domain of State and local jurisdiction upon
the plea of subserving the public welfare.
The preservation of the partitions between
proper subjects of Federal and local care and
regulation, is of such importance under the
Constitution, which is tbe law of our very ex
istence that no consideration of expedience or
sentiment should tempt us to enter upon
doubtful ground. We have undertaken to dis
cover and proclaim the richest blessings of a
free Government with, the Constitution as
our guido. Let us follow the way it points out.
It will not mislead. And surely no one who
has taken upon himself the solemn obligation
to support and preserve the Constitution can
find justification or solace for disloyalty in the
excu-o that he . wandered and disobeyed in
search of a better way to reach the public wel
fare than the Constitution offers.
What has been said is deemed not inappro
priate at a time when, from a century's height
we view the way already trod by the American
people and attempt to discover their future
paths. The seventh President of the United
States the soldier and statesman and at all
times the firm and brave friend of the people '
in vindication of his course as the proteotor of I
the popular rights and championship of true .
American citizenship, declared:
The ambition which leads me on is an anxious
desire and a fixed determi -ation to restore to
the people, unimpaired, the sacred trust they
have confided to my charge; to heal the wounds
of the Constitution and to prevent its violation.
To persuade my countrymen, so far as
I my, that it is not in a splendid
government supported by powerful monop
olies and aristocratic . establishments that
they will find happiness or their liberties pro
tected, but in a plain system, void of pomp
protecting all and granting favors to none, dis
pensing its blessings like the dew of Heaven,
unseen and unfelt save in the freshness and
beauty they contribute to produce. It is such
a Government the genius of our people requires
such an one only under which our States may
remain for ages to come united, prosperous and
free." .
FOREIGN AFFAIRS. ..
The President announces that the close of the
year finds the United States in the enjoyment
of domestic tranquility and at peace with all the
Nations. Foreign relations have been strength
ened and improved by performance of individual
good offices and by new and renewed treaties of
amity, commerce and reciprocity and extradi
tion of criminals.
The Fisheries question has not been
satisfactorily - adjusted, but sinco March
3d, 1887, no cases have been re
ported to the Department of State
wherein complaint has been made of unlawful
or unfriendly treatment by Canadian authori
ties in which reparation was not promptly and.
satisfactorily obtained by the United States
Consul-General at Hall ax. I continue in the
opinion that the treaty of February last, which
failed to receive the approval of the Senate,
did supply "a satisfactory, practicable and final
adjustment, on a basis honorable and just to
both parties, to the difficult and vexed ques
tion to which it related,1 and having subse
quently a d unavailingly recommended other
legislation to Congress which I hoped would
suffice to meet the urgency created
by the rejection of the treaty, I now
again invoke the earnest and immediate
attention ox tne congress to the con
dition of this important question as it now
stands before them and the country, and for the
settlement of which I am deeply solicitous.
The West incident is treated as follows:
"Near the close of the' month of October last
occurrences of a deeply regrettable nature were
brought to my knowledge, which made it my
painful but imperative duty to obtain, with as
little delay as possible, a new personal chan
nel of diplomatic intercourse in this country
with the Government of Great Britain.
The correspondence in relation to this incident
will in due course be laid before you and will
disclose the unpardonable con-tuct of the offi
cial referred to in his interference by advice
and counsel with the suffrages of American cit
izens in the very crisis of the Presidential elec
tion then near at hand and also in his subse
quent action, superadding impugnment of the
Executive and Senate of the United States in
connection with important questions now pend
ing in controversy between the two Govern
ments. The offense thus committed was most
grave, involving disastrous possibilities to
the good relations of the United States and
Great Britain, constituting a .gross breach of
diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the
purely domestic affairs and essential sove
reignty of the Government to which the envoy
was accredited Having first fulfilled the just
demands of international comity, by affording
full opportunity for her Majesty's Government
to act In relief of the situation. I considered
prolongation of the subject to be unwarranted
and therefore declined to further recognise the
diplomatic character of the person whose oon-
tinuaact in suea function would destroy- thai
which is essential to the good understanding of
the two Governments, and was inconsistent
with the welfare and self-respect of the Govern
ment of the United States. The usual inter
change of communication has since continued
through her Majesty's legation in this city.
The Presi 'ent calls attention to the eed of
measures to prevent the destruction of fur
seals in Behring's sea: for a survey of the
Alaskan boundary, to prevent new complica
tions with England: for measures to alleviate
loss of life and property on the great lakes,
especially a concession from Canada allow-,
ing American , vessels to go to the assistance
of wrecks in Canadian waters, as Canadian ves
sels are allowed to com into ours; the protec
tion of citizens of French origin from demands
for military service when they return to France ;
the return to German steamship lines of inter
est upon tonnage illegally exacted. The Presi
dent calls attention . to our relations with
Samoa; says the fund to recompense Chinese
citizens for injuries received in this country
awaits acceptano by China, and the exclusion
of this class will probably prevent repetition
of such troubles Japan still wants our good
offices in helping her establish her right to con
trol her own commerce; the establishment of
consulates in Corea is recommended; the
United States is looking after her citizens in
Hayti, but is endeavoring to mam
tain proper neutrality: the treaty
with Hawaii having been extended
calls up the commercial importance of a sub
marine telegraph to Honolulu.
A commercial treaty should be concluded
with Mexico and appropriation made for a pre
cise relocation of oar boundary with that coun
try. The Mexican Government shows a very
friendly spirit in its co-operation in the main
tenance of peace along the international bound
ary. The President then calls attention to our
relations with Central and South American
States and the claims of certain of our citizens
against Chili, Ecuador and Venezuela
As authorized by the Congress, preliminary
steps have been taken for the assemblage at
this capital during the coming year of the rep
resentatives of South and Central American
States, together with those of Mexico. Eyti
and San Domingo, to discuss sundry impor ant
monetary and commercial topics. Excepting in
those cases where from reasons of contiguity of
territory and the existence of a border line in
capable of being guarded, reciprocal commer
cial treaties may be found expedient, it
is believed that commercial policies inducing
freer mutual exchange of products can be most
advantageously arranged by independent but
co-operative legislation. In the mode last men
tioned the control of our taxation tor revenue
will be always retained in our hands, unre
stricted by conventional agreements with other
Governments.
IMMIGRATION.
With the rapid increase of immigration to our
shores and the facilities of modern travel
abuses of the generous privileges offered by
our naturalizati n laws call for their careful
revision. The easy and unguarded manner in
which certificates of American citizenship
can now be obtained has induced a class, un
fortunately large, to avail themselves of the
opportunity to become absolved from alleg
iance to their native land and yet by a foreign
residence to escape any just duty and contribu
tion of service to the country of their proposed
adoption. Thus while evading the duties of.
citizenship to the United States they
may make prompt claim for its national
protection and demand its intervention in their
behalf. International complications of a seri
ous nature arise and the correspondence of the
State Department discloses the great number
and complexity of the questions which have
been raised.
Our laws regulating the issue of passports
should be carefully revised and the institution
of a central bureau of registration at tbe
capital is again strongly recommended. By
this means full particulars of each case of
naturalization in the United States would be
secured and properly indexed and recorded.
and thus many cases of spurious citizenship
would be detected and unjust responsibilities -would
be avoided.
The maritime powers have also been invited
to confer in Washington in April next regard
ing uniform rules for the security of life and
property at sea. .
THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
The reorganization of the consular service is
a matter of serious importance to our National
Interests. The number of existing principal
consular offices is believed to be greater than is
at all necessary for the conduct of the public
business. I repeat the recommendations here
tofore made by me that the appropriation for
the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular
service should be recast, that tbe so-called no
tarial or unofficial fees which onr representa
tives abroad are now enabled to trat as per
sonal perquisites should be forbidden: that a
Bystem of consular inspection should be insti
tuted, and that a limited number of secretaries
of legation-at large should be authorized.
THE WASHINGTON CENTENNIAI
Preparations for the centennial celebration
on April 30, 1889, of the inauguration of Geoige
Washington as President of the United States
at the city of New York have been made by a
voluntary organization of the citizens of that
locality, and believing that an opportunity
should be afforded for the expression of the in
terest felt throughout the country in this event,
I respectfully recommend fitting and co-opera
tive action by Congress on behalf of the people
of the United States.
THE TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
shows that the total ordinary revenues of the
Government for the fiscal year ended June 30,
188, amounted to $379,266,074 76, of which
2219,091,174.63 was received from customs duties
and $124,96,71.93 from internal taxes The
total receipts from all sources exceeded those
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887, by
t7.862.797.10. The ordinary expenditures of the
fiscal year ending June 3888. were 8.59.653,-
953.67, leaving a surplus of $119,6 2,116.09. The
decrease in these expenditures as com
pared with the fiscal year ended June
30, 1S87, was- $3,278,221.31, notwithstanding the
payment of more than $5,0J0,0.:0 for pensions
in excess of what was paid for that purpose
in the latter mentioned year. The revenues of
ihe Government for the year ended June 39,
1888, ascertained for the quarter ended Sep
tember SO, 888, and estimated for the re
mainder of the time, amount to $177,000, and
the actual and estimated ordinary expendi
tures for the same years are f73,iK) .0O0,
leaving an estimated surplus of $104,000.0. X).
The estimated receipts for the year ending
June 30, 1890, are 1377,000.1 tx, and the estimated
ordinary expenditures for the same time are
f275,7S7,488.34, showing a surplus of $101,23?,
511.66. The foregoing statements of surplus do
not take into account the sum necessary to be
expended to meet the requirements of the sink
ing fund act. amounting to more than (47,000,000
annually. The cost of collecting the customs rev
, enues for the last fiscal year was .44 per cent. ;
for the year 1883 it was 3.77 ' per cent.
The excess of internal revenue taxes collected
during the last fiscal year over those collected
for the year ended June 30, 1887, was $5,489,
174.28, and the cost of collecting this revenue
decreased from 3 4 per cent, in 1887 to less than
3.4 per cent, for the last year.
Bonds of tbe Government not yet due have
been purchased up to and including the 30th
day of November, 1838, amounting to $94,700,44).
the premium paid thereon amounting to
$17,508,613.08. The premium, added to the
principal of these bonds, represents an
investment yielding about 2 per cent, interest
for the time they still had to run, and the sav
ing to the Government represented by the dif
ference between the amount of interest at 2
per cent, upon the sum paid for principal and
premium and what would have paid for interest
at the rate specified in the bonds if they had
run to their maturity is about $27,165,000. At
first sight this would seem to be a profitable and
sensible transaction on the part of the Govern
ment, but as suggested by the Secretary of the
Treasury the surplus thus expended for the
pur base of bonds was money drawn from the
people in excess of any actual need of the Gov
ernment and was so expended rather than allow
it to remain in the treasury.
At the close of the fiscal year ended June 3",
1887, there had been coined under the compul
sory Silver Coinage act $266,938,280 in silver dol
lars, $3(10,01,310 of which were in the hands of
the people on the 30th day of June, 1888. There
had been coined $299,709,733, and of this 8TA829,
303 was in circulation in coin and $30027.378 in
silver certificates, for the redemption of which
silver dollars to that amount wen held by tks)
Qoverdmenk
The Secretary recommends the suspension of
the further coinage of silver, and in such recom
mendation I earnestly concur. '
. TBI ARXT. ; "
The Secretary of War reports that the army,
at the date of the lat consolidated returns, con
sisted of 2,189 officers and 24,549 enlisted men.
The actual expenditures of the War Depart
ment for the ileal year ended June SO, 1888,
amounted to $41,166,1 -7.07, of which sum 9. 58,
614.63 was expended for public works, including
river and harbor improvements.
I earnestly request that the recommenda
tions contained in tbe Secretary's report, all
of which are, in my opinion, calculated to in
crease the usefulness and discipline of the army
may receive the consideration of the Congress,
among these the proposal that there should be
provided a plan for the examination of officers
to test their fitness for promotion is of the ut
most importance. This reform has been before
recommended in the reports of the Secretary,
and its expediency is so fully demonstrated by
the argument he presents in its favor that its
adoption should no longer be neglected.
The death of General Sheridan in August
last was a National affliction. The army then
lost the grandest of its chiefs. The country
lost a brave and experienced soldier, a wise and
discreet counselor, and a modest and sensible
man. Those who in any manner came within
the range of his personal association will never
fail to pay deserved and willing homage to his
greatness and the glory of his career, but they
will cherish with more tender sensibility the
loving memory of his simple, generous and
considerate nature.
THIS NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
demonstrates very intelligent management in
that important department and discloses the
most satisfactory progress in the work of re
constructing the navy made during the past
year. Of the ships in course of construction,
five, viz. : The Charleston, the Baltimore, the
York, the Vesuvius and the Petrel have .in that
time been launched and are rapidly approach
ing completion. The Philadelphia, the San
Francisco, the Newark, the Bennington, the
Concord and tbe Herreshoff torpedo boats are
all under contract for delivery to the depart
ment during the next year.
The progress already made and being made
gives good ground for the expectation that
these eleven vessels will be incorporated as
part of the American navy within the next
twelve months.
The report shows that, notwithstanding the
large expenditures for new construction, and
the additional labor they involve, the total
ordinary or current expenditures of the de
partment for the three years ended June 30,
1888, are less by more than 20 per cent, than
such expenditures for the three years ended
June SO, 1884. The various steps which have
been taken to improve the business methods
of the Depa tment are reviewed bv the Secre
tary. The purchasing of supplies has been con
solidated and placed under a responsible bu
reau head. This has resulted in the curtail
ment of open purchase's, which in the years 1884
and 1835 amounted to over 50 per cent, of all the
purchases of the department, to less than 1 per
cent. ; so that at the present time about 90 per
cent, of the total departmental purchases are
made by contract and after competition. As
the expenditures on this account exceed on an
average of $2,000,000 annually, it is evident that
an important improvement on the system has
been inaugurated and substantial economies
introduced.
THE POST-OFFICE.
The report of the Postmaster-General shows
a marked increase of business in every branch
of the postal service. The number of post-offices
on July 1, 1883, was 57,376, an increase of 6, 124 in
three years and of 2,210 for the last fiscal year.
Free delivery offices have increased from 189 in
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887, to 35S in the
year ended June 30, 1SS8. In the railway mail
service there has been increase in one year of
168 routes, and in the number of miles traveled
per annum an increase of 150,795.917.48. The
estimated increase of railroad sen-ice for the
year was 6,06:) miles, but the amount of new
railroad service actually put on was 12,764.50
miles.
The volume of business in the money order
division including transactions in postal notes,
reached the sum of upwards of 143 millions for
the year. During the past year parcel post con
ventions have been concluded with Barbadoes,
the Bahamas, British Honduras and Mexico
and are now under negotiation with all the
Central and South American States. The in
crease for correspondence with foreign
countries during the past three years is gratify
ing and is especially notable and exceptional
with the Central and South American States
and Mexico. As the greater part of mail
matter exchanged with these countries is com
mercial in its character this increase is evi
dence of the increased business relations with
them.
The practical operation of the parcel post
convention so far as negotiated has served to
fulfil the most favorable prediction as to their
benefits. In January last a general postal con
vention was negotiated with the Dominion of
Canada, which went into operation March 1 and
which practically makes one postal territory of
the United States and Canada. Under it mer
chandise parcels may now be transmitted
through the mails at fourth class rates of post
age. It is not possible here to touch even the lead
ing heads of the great postal establishment to
illustrate the enormous and rapid growth of the
business and the needs for legislative readjust
ment of much of its machinery that it has out
grown. For these and valuable reccommenda-
tions of the Postma ter General attention is
invited to his report. - A department whose
revenues have increased from $19,772,a.O in 1870
to $52,7 0.000 in 1888, despite reduction of post
age which have enormously reduced rates of
revenue while daily increasing its business de
mands the careful consideration of the Congress
as to all matters suggested by those familiar
with its operations and which are calculated
to increase its efficiency and usefulness. '
Of tbe total number of postmasters 54,874 are
of the fourth class. These, of course, receive
no allowances whatever for expenses in the ser
vice, end their compensation is fixed by per
centages on receipts at their respective offices.
This rate of compensation may have been and
probably was. at one time, just, Irut the stand
ard has remained unchanged through the sev
eral reductions in the rates of postage. Such
reductions have necessarily cut down the com
pensation of these officials while it undoubtedly
increased the business performed by them.
Simple justice requires a mention of this sub
ject to the end that fourth-class postmasters
may receive at least an equivalent to that
which the law itself fixing the rate intended for
them.
Another class of postal employes whose con
dition seems to demand legislation is that of
clerks in post-offices, and I call especial atten
tion to the repeated recommendations of the
Postmaster-General for their classification.
Proper legislation of this character for the
relief of carriers in the free delivery service has
been frequent., Provision is made for their
promotion: for substitutes for them on vaca
tion; for substitutes for holidays, and limiting
their hours of labor. Seven million dollars has
been appropriated for the current year to pro
vide for them, though the total number of of
fices where they are employed is but 358 for the
past fiscal year, w ith an estimated increase for
the current year of but forty, while the total
appropriation for all clerks in offices through
out the United States is $5,950,000.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
Tbe transactions of the Department of Jus
tice for the fiscal year ended June 3-1, 1888, are
contained in the report of the Attorney-General,
as well as a number of valuable recom
mendations, the most of which are repetitions
of those previously made and ought to receive
consideration. . It is stated in this report that
though judgments in civil suits amounting to
$t52,021. 8 were recovered in favor of the Gov
ernment during the year, only the sum of $132,
031 was collected thereon; and that though
fines, penalties and forfeitures were Imposed
amounting to $541,893 43, only $1 9,648.42 of that
sum was paid on account thereof.
These facts may furnish an illustration of the
sentiment which extensively prevails that a
debt due the Government should cause no in
coveniencetothe citizen.
It also appears from this report that though
prior to March, 1885. there had been but six
convictions in the Teritories of Utah and
Idaho under the laws of 1862 and 1833, punish
ing polygamy and unlawful cohabitation as
crimes, there have been since that date nearly
six hmndred conTiefeoaa under lbs laws and
statutes of 1S37, and the opinion is expressed
that under such a firm and vigilant execution of
these laws and the advance of ideas opposed to
the forbidden practices, polygamy within the
United States is virtually at an end. -
Suits instituted by the Government under
the provisions of the act, of March 3. 18S7, for
the termination of the corporations known as
the perpetual Emigrating. Fund Company and
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
have resulted, in a degree, favorable to the
Government, declaring the charters of these
corporations forfeited and escheating their
property. Such property, amounting in value
to more than $800,000 is in the hands of a re
ceiver, pending further proceedings, an appeal
having been taken to the Supreme Court of the
United States.
PUBLIC LAND SCATTERS.
In the report of the Secretary of the Interior,
which will be laid before you, the condition of
the various branches of our domestic affairs
connected with that Department and its opera
lions during the past year are fully exhibited.
But a brief reference to some of the subjects
discussed in this able and interesting report
can be here made, but I recommend the entire
report to the attention of Congress and trust
that the sensible and valuable recommenda
tions it contains will secure careful considera
tion. I can not too strenuously insist oh the im
portance of proper measures to insure a right
disposition of . our public lands, not only as a
matter of present justice but in forecast of the
consequences to future generations. The
broad, rich acres of our agricultural plains have
been long preserved by nature to become her
untram uelled gift to a people civilized and free
upon which should rest, in well distributed
ownership, the numerous homes of enlightened,
equal and fraternal citizens. We came to Na
tional possession with the warning example in
our eyes of the entail of inequities of landed
prsprletorship which other countries have per
mitted and still suffer.
We have no excuse for the violation of prin
ciples, cogently taught by reason and example,
nor for the allowance of pretexts which have
sometimes exposed our land to colossal greed.
Laws which open a door to fraudulent acquisi
tion or an administration which permits the
rapacious seizure by a favored few of the ex
panded areas that many should enjoy are ac
cessory to offenses against our National welfare
and humanity and can not be too severely con
demned or punished.
It is gratifying to know that something has
been done at last to redress the injuries to our
people and check the perilous tendency of the
reckless waste of National domain. That over
eighty million acres have been wrested from
illegal usurpation, improvident grants and
fraudulent entries - and claims must afford a
profound gratification to right feeling citizens
as it is a recompense for the labors and
struggles of the recovery.
Our dear experience ought sufficiently to urge
the speedy enactment of measures .of legisla
tion which will confine tbe future disposition
of our remaining agricultural lands to the uses
of actual husbandry and genuine homes. Nor
should our vast tracks of so-called desert land
be yielded up to the monopoly of corporations
or grasping individuals as appears to be much
the tendency under the existing statutes. The
lands require but the supply of water to become
fertile and productive. It is a problem of great
moment how more wisely for the publio good
that factor shall be furnished. I can not but
think it perilous to suffer either those lands or
the sources of their irrigation to fall into the
hands of monopolies which by such means,
may exercise lordship over areas dependent on
their treatment for productiveness.
Already steps have been taken to secure ac
curate and scientific information of the. condi
tions which is the principal basis of intelligent
act on. Until this shall be gathered, the course
of wisdom appears clearly to be in a suspension
of further disposal, which only promises to
create rights antagonistic to the common in
terest. No harm can follow this cautionary
conduct. The land will remain, and the public
good presents no demand for hasty disposses
sion of .National ownership and control.
I commend also the recommendations that
appropriate measures be taken to complete the
adjustment of the various grants made to the
States for internal improvements and of swamp
and overflowed lands as well as to adjudicate
and finally determine the validity and extent
of the numerous private land claims. All these
are elements of great injustice and peril to the
settlers upon the localiti-s affected, and , now
that their existence can not be avoided no duty
is more pressing than to fix as soon as possible
their bounds and terminate the threats of
trouble which arise from uncertainty.
THE INDIANS.
The condition of our Indian population con
tinues to improve and the proofs multiply that
the transforming change so much to be desired,
which shall substitute for barbarism enlighten
ment and civilizing education, is in favorable
progress. Allotments in severalty have been
made on some reservations, until all those en-ti-led
to land thereon have had their shares
assi ned, and the work is still continued. As
soon as possible community in land should
cease, by opening up such as remain unallotted
to settlement. Contact with the ways
of industrious and successful farmers
will perhaps add a healthv emulation
which will both instruct and stimulate.
But no agency for the amelioration of this
people appears to be so promising as the ex
tension urged by the Secretary of such com
plete facilities of education as shall at the
the earliest possible day embrace all teach
able Indian youths of both sexes and retain
them with a kindly and beneficent hold until
their characters aro formed and their faculties
trained.
The Apache Indians at Mount Vernon bar
racks. Ala are being well cared for and their
children carefully educated, and there is no
good reason why they should be returned to the
reservation. They should be kept in restraint.
PENSIONS.
"The number of pensions added to the roll
during, the fiscal year ended June 30. J888, is
60,552. and increase of pension was granted in
45,716 eases. The names of 15,730 pensioners
were dropped from the rolls during the year for
various causes, and at the close of the year the
number of pensioners was 452.557. Ol these there
were 806 survivors of the war of 1812,
10,187 widows of . those who served In
that war; 16.060- soldiers ff the Mexican
war and 5,104 widows of said soldiers.
One hundred and two different rates of pen
sions are paid to these beneficiaries, ranging
from $2 to r-!16.C6 per month. The amount
paid for pensions during the fiscal year was
$78,775,851.91, being an increase over the pre
ceding year of $303.2sa22. The expenses at
tending the maintenance and operation of the
Pension Bureau during that period was $3,262,
524.67, making the entire expenditures of the
bureau $82,038,330.7. being 21J4 per cent, of the
gross income and nearly 31 per cent, of the to
tal expenditures of the Government during the
year.
I am thoroughly convinced that our general
pension laws should be revised and adjusted to
meet, as zar as possible in the light of our ex.
perience, all meritorious cases. The fact that
one hundred and two different rates of pensions-
are paid can not in my opinion be made con
sis tent with justice to the pensioners or to the
Government, and the numerous private pen
sion bills t at are passed, predicated upon the
imperfection of general laws, while they in
crease in many cases existing inequality
and injustice, lend additional force to
the recommendation for a revision of
the general laws on this subject.
The laxity of ideas prevailing among a large
number of our people regarding pensions is be
coming every day more marked. The principles
upon which they should be granted are in dan
ger of being altogether ignored, and already
pensions are often- claimed because the appli
cants are as much entitled as other successful
applicants, rather than upon any disabil
ity reasonably attributable to military
service. If the establishment of
various precedents be continued, it
the granting of pensions be not divorced from
partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant con
siderations, and the honorable name of veteran
unfairly becomes by these means but another
term for one who constantly clamors for the aid
of the Government there is danger that injury
will be done to the fame and patr otism of many
whom our citizens delight to honor, and that
a prejudice wm be aroused unjust to meritori
ous applicants for pensions. .

Four years ago" it was found that the great
cattle industry of the country wss endangered

rapid extention of the European lung plague of
pleuro-pneumoni. Serious outbreaks existed
in Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky, and in
Tennessee animals affected were held la
quarantine. Five counties in . New York and
from one to four counties each in the States of
New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Delaware and
Maryland were almost equally affected. With
the great danger upon us and with the con
tagion already in the channels of commerce;
with the enormous direct and indirect losses
already , being caused by it, and when my
prompt and energetic action could bo success
ful, there were in none of these States auy laws
authorizing this department to eradicate v the
malady or riving the State officials power to co
operate for this purpose. The depart
ment even lacked both the requisite ap
propriation and authority. By securing
State co-operation in connection with
authority from Congress, the work or eradica
tion has been pressed successfully and this
dreaded disease has been extirpated from the
Western States, with the exception of a few re
stricted areas which are still under supervision,
The danger has thus been removed and trade
and commerce have been freed from the
vexatious State restr ctions which were deemed
An exhaustive study has also within the same
period been undertaken of the subject of 'food
adulteration and the best analytic method
for determining it. A part of the results of
this work has already been published by
the department, which, with the matter in
course of preparation, will make the moss
complete treatise on that subject that ever
has been published In any country. The de

result in the general good and to the, benefit of
all our people, thus justifying the appropria
tions made from the publio treasury.
During the past four years the process of dif-
from sorghum and sugar cane has been intro
duced Into this country and fully perfected by
the experiments carried on by the department.
This process is now universally considered to
be the most economical one, and it is through
it that the sorghum sugar industry has been
established upon a firm basis and the road ttP
its future success opened. The adoption of this
diffusion process is also extending in Louisiana
and other sugar producing parts of the country
and will probobly be the on y method employed
for the extraction of sugar from the cane.

MOURNED. AS DEAD.
Return of a 3Ian Who Had Been Lost Sight
Of Por Twenty-five Tears.
Helena, Ark., Dec 4. What proves to
be a most interesting and romantic story
of the return to-day cf a man who has
beqn mourned as dead for a quarter of a.
century has just come to light. The hero
of the story is an old man named Andrew
J. Joyce, who is now seventy-five years
of age. His whereabouts was discovered
by the merest chance. The beginning of
the story dates back to the late war. At
tbe beginning of the war he resided in
Marietta, Ga, and was possessed of quite
a number of slaves and was quite promi
nent. He left his place of residence with
quite a number of negroes, whom he dis
posed of and converted the proceeds "of the
sale into tobacco. From that time to the
present his friends had not heard of him.
It was thought that he had met a band of
guerrillas, who had killed and robbed him
of his possessions.
Judge F. J. Humphries of this city, and
clerk of the Circuit Court, yesteraay re
ceived a dingy-looking letter from 2ew
Orleans, stating that the writer's tytme
was A. J. Joyce, and that he had jatt
gotten out of a Cuban prison, where he had
been imprisoned since 1867. He further
stated that he had written hundreds of
letters to his friends and relatives and
never received a reply, and that the only
way he learned of the Judge's where
abouts was through the means of an old
newspaper, in which he noticed thaf he
had been re-elected as circuit clerk of this
county.
In his letter Joyce says he became a
blockade runner during the war and made
four successful runs, and on the fifth be
was captured; that he operated with the
son of an ex-Governor (Wells). He did not
state how he became imprisoned. Judge
Humphries as soon as he received tho
letter telegraphed to a 21r. Koberts. of
Tyler, Tex., a son-in-law of Joyce, statins
that their father-in-law was still living.
Steps were immediately taken to have him
provided for. A letter from Tyler, Tex.
received to-day, says that he is now theri
with his daughter, who has lose
mourned him as being dead. Joyce has s
son and daughter in this county, also a
son-in-law. A peculiar feature connected
with the first letter received from him,
after such an absence, was that the first
sentence in the letter related to the last
circumstance that his friends and relatives
remember in connection with his disap
pearance, namely, the sale of a certain lot
of negroes. He begins by telling that he
sold the negroes, and from .that he
branches off on other subjects. He has
been weakened in mind and body by his
lengthened confinement.
