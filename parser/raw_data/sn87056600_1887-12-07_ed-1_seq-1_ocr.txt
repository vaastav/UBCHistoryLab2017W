Washington, December 0. After the
readitg ot the journal la the Senate to
day tbe Presiding officer asked whether
it was the pleasure of the Senate to proceed
with the usual morning business,
etator Harr! suggested that bills and
memorials mfgtt be introduced ana re
fured.
Senator I loir opposed the proposition.stat-
Ing that it wasan ancient custom of the Sen
ate not to ftler open any ordinary busi
ness until a.'ter bearing the communica
tion from the President at the beglnmg of
tbe stsricn. Tbat was a mark of respect
tine from the Legislative Department of
the Government to Executive. He thr re-
ore moved a recess for half an hour. The
motion was sorted to.
After tbe rtcesa bad been extended for
a quarter of an hour lonirr, Senator Mor
rill reported that the Joint Committee
appose ted to wai t upon the President had
perfcirred tr-e duty and had been inform
ed that tbe Tmu'eLt would immediately
roonmnnicate with Congress in writing.
TbeitQpon Mr. O. L. Prüden, one of the
President's Eecrttarieb', presented several
mesiB'res in writing; and the presiding
officer laid before the Senate the Presi
dent's annual message. Mr. McCook,
Secretary of tbe. Senate, at five minutes
past 1, commenced the reading of the
message, which is as follows:

I ROl O-tTlOJtS CONKIDKRED.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a meana of restoring to circulation the
snrplns money accumulating in the Treasury,
it should be bornelin mind fiat premiums must
of course be paid upon such purchase, tnat
there maybe a large part of these bonds held as
investments which cannot be purcborcd at any
price, and that combinations among hollers
w ho are willing to sell nisy unreasonably en
hance the cost of such bonds to the Govern
ment. It has been suggested that the present bonded
debt might be rt tunded atalesJ rate ot interest,
and the diDcrenre between the old and new
securities paid la cash, thus finding use for the
surplus iu tbe Treasury. Tbe success of this
plan, it i apfireut. must depend upon the
volition of the holders of the prcseut Donds;
and li i net entirely certain tbat trteludu'e
mcntwbicb must be oueredtbem would result
in rx.oie llusnciai bjnent to the (ioveroinuut

proposition would reduce the principal of the
debt ty actual payment, instead of extcud
lag it.
The proposition to deposit the money held by
tbeGoveriirrent in banks thr'U-;bout the coun
try, for ue by tbe people, is.lt seems to me.ex
ctedluBly cbjectioiisble in principle, as estnb
lish'ng too close a relationship between the op
erations of the Government If asury and the
business ci the country, and too extensive a
commingling of their money, thus fo-teric,' an
unnatural reliance in private business upon
public funds. If this scheine should ic adopted
it should only lie doue as a temporary expedi

opposite direction and should have a tendency

I had dc emed It my doty to thus bring to tb 3

which taxed to the utmost all the authority

these appear now to e exhausted, if di. aster
result from the continued Inaction of Congress
the respotsibility mu-tresis where it belongs.
Trough tbe situation thus lar cousidered is
fraught with danger which thould be fully re
alized, and though it presents lectures of wrong
to the reople as well as as peril to the couutry,
It is but a result erowin? out of a perfectly pal
able and apparent cause, constantly reproduc
ing lie same al irming circumstances a con
gested National Treasury and depleted more
lary condition m the business of the country.
It need hardly be stated that while the present
situation demands a remedy, we can only be
saved from a like predicameut iu tne luture ty
the removal of lis cause.
Our scheme of taxatioD. by means of which
this i cedit ss surplus is taken from the people
and put into tne public treasury, consists of a
tariff or duty levied upon the importations from
abroad, and internal reveiue taxes levied upon
the consumption of ;obacco and spirituous and
malt liquors j It mutt be conceded that none of
tbe things subjet ted to internal revenue taxa
tion are. stricry speaking, necessaries: there
arppsrs to be no just complaint of thia taxation
by the consumers of these articles, and there
steins to be nothing so well able to tear tne
Durden without hardship to any portion of the
people.
RF.rrCF. THE TARIFF.
But cur present tariff laws, the vicious, in
equi'ab'e and i logical source of unnecessary
taxation, ought to be at once revised aud
ameDded. These laws, as their primary and
plain effect raise the price to consumers of all
ai tides imported anil subject to duty, by pre
cisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus tha
amount of the dnty incisures the tax paid nr
tbose who purcnase for use thete imported
articles. Many of these things, however, are
raised or manufactured in o.:r own
country, and the duties no.-' levied
upon foreign goods snd product ;e called
protection to thee boire rnatufao tres, be
cause they render it possible for tho-i of our
people who aie manufacturers, to make these
taxed artie'es andsell them for a price e-v ' ' to
that demanded lor the iinpor ed goods tht
have raid customs cuy. .so it happens um
while comparatively a few u-e the imported ar
ticles, millions of our peop e, wao never tue
and nevet saw any of the foreign prcic's,
purchase and use thircs oi the same kind made
in this country, and pay therefor nearlv or
qrjte the enhanced price, which the duty adds
to the imported articles. Those who buy Im
port spay tbe duty charged thereon into the
iub!ic Treasury, but tl'e great majority of our
ciilens, who buy dornt stic articles of the same
class, pay a sum at lean approximately equal to
this duty to tae home manufacturer. This ref
erence to tne operation of our tariff laws is not
made by way or instruction, but in order that
we may be constantly reminded oi the manner
in which they impose a burdn upon those who
consume domestic prodncts as weil a those who
consume imported articles, and thus creates a
tax upon all our people.
it is not proposed to entirely re'ieve the coun
try of this taxation. It must extens veiy
continued as the roure of the Gover ment'a
Income, and in a readjust mnt of our tart a the
interests of Ameriran labor engaged in the
manufacture should be carefully conridered as
well as the preservation of our manufacturers.
It may be taPcd protection or by anv other
name, but redef from the hardships arid dau
ters of our j resf nt tariff laws should be de
vised with especial precaution s&sinst 'ni peril
ing the existence of our manufacturing inter
ests. But this existence should uot mean a condi
tion which, without regard to the public wel
fare of a national exigency, :nust always in
sure tbe realisation of immense pro Mis instead
of fmoderately profitable returns. Aa the
volume and diversity of our national activitic
incrfase, new recruits are added to those who
desire a continuation of the advantages which
tbey conceive the present system of tariff taxa
tion directly affords them.So stcbborniy have all
efforts to reform the present condition been re
sisted by those of our fellow-citizens thus en
gaged that they can hardly complain cf tbe sus
picion entertained to a certain extent that
tnere existed an orzanized combination all
along the line to maintain their advantage.
INFANT INt.lSTRIF.
, We are in tne midst of centennial celebra
tlous, and, with becoming pride, we reioire In
American skill and ingenuity, in American
energy aud enterprise, and in the natural ad
vantages and resources developed bv a ceu
tury 'a rational growth. Vet. when an attempt
ia made to justify a scheme which permits
tax to b laid upon every costomer in the land
for the benefit of our manufactures quite be
yond a itasonable demand for governmental
regaid.it suits the purposes of advocacy to call
our manufacturers infant industries. still neei
ing the highest and greatest dsgree of favor and
fosteTlng care that can be wrung from federal
legislation, it is also said that tbe Increase in
the price of dornest! manufactures resulting
rom tb present tariff is necessary, in order
that higher wages may he paid to onr working
men employed in manufactories than are paid
for what fs railed tbe "pauper labor" of Europe.
All will acknowledge tne force of an argument
which involves tbe welfare and liberal compen
sation oi our labor Is honorable In the eyes of
everv American titixen; and aalt lies at tbe
foundation of our development and progress,
It Is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy,
to the utmost regard. The standard of our
laborers' life should not be measured by that
of anyjother country less favored, and they are
entitled to their full share o our advantages.
By the last census it ia made to appear that of
ttie 17,:i9W-'9 of our population engaged in all
Studs of likiustiios. 7.670,443 are em ploy d la

servants and laborers) while l,Ml0 2.r6 are em
ployed in trade and transportation and S,&;7,
112 are classed as employed in manufacturing;
and mining, for present purposes, however,
the last number git en should be considerably
reducfd Without attempting to enumerate
all. it will be conceded that there shoal 1 he de

carpenters and joiners; 25,101 mlilner, dress

fsged in manufacturing agricultural
mplements, amounting la the aggre
gate to UH.oai. leaving 2G23.ÜM) persons em

are claimed to be benefited by a high tar 111".
To these the appeal is made to save thair em-
filoyment and maintain tnelr waes by resist
ng a charge. T here should be no disposition
to answer such suggestions ov the allegation
that they are In a minority anions; those who
labor, and therefore should forego au advantage,
in the interest of low prices for tbe majority.
Their torapenratiou, as it may be affected by
the operation of tariff laws, should at all times
be sciupulouily kept in view: and yet wtth
slight reflection they will not overlook the fact
that they are consumers with tin rest: that they
too, have their own wants and those ot their
families to supply from their earnings, and that
the price of the necessaries of life, as well as the
amount of their wnges, will regulate the meas
ure of their welfare and comfort.
HOW TO MF.ASXr.6 THE KK DICTION.
But the reduction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as inot to neces.slate or
jist.ly either the lo-.s of employment by the
woisuig man nor the lessening of his wages
aud tbe profits still leaiaining to the manufac
turer, after the necessary readju'tment. should
furnish no exen for tae sacrifice ol the ia-
a. . si. vf ki. (.1i,r ah nÜhAf In I rtrtp rrr
tunity to work or in the diminution of their i
comtersation. ror can tne w or nor lumtuu
facturus fail to understand that while a hUh
taritt is c.'aimcd to b3 necessary to allow the
pajrr.cnt of rerxuncrative wsges, 1'. certainly
resul s in a very 1st go Increase in the pricaof
nearly all sorts of manufactures, which, in
a:n.o: t cuntlcFs forms, he needs for the uc of

bis cm plot er his -sages, and perhaps before he
reaches his home Is obliged in a purchsa for
family use of an article which embraces his own
labor, to return in the payment of the increase
in price which the tariff pe units, the hard
earned compentataon of many days of toil.

price which the tariff impescg upon every agri
cultural implement, upon all he wears aud upon

s'ocks ana hero's ana such things as his hus
bandry prodr-es from the toil, is Invoked to
aid in maintaining the present situation; and
be is told that a high duty on imported wool is
net crsarv fr the beucat of those who have
sheep to shear, in order that the price of their
wool may be increased. They, of course, are
not reminded that tbe farmer who has nosr.eep
is by this scheme obl'ned, in bis purchases ol
clothing and woolen gocds, to pay a tnbnte to
his fellow-farmer as well as to the manufacturer
and merchant; nor is any mention maac of the
fact that the sbecpowners themreHesand their
honseholfa must wear clothing and use other
article manutrctured from the wool theyaell
at tariff pt ices, and thus as consume rs,mnt,t re
turn their share ol this inceasd price to the
tradesman, i3
1 think it may be fairly assumed thatalar,
proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers
throughout tbe couutry are found in small
Hocks uuraberiDg from twettty-fiye to fiity. The
duty on tbegrs 'e of Imported wool which these
sheep yield Is ten cents each pound, if of the
value of thirty cents or less, aud twelve cents if ot
the valueof more than thirty,rent if the liberal
estimate of six pounds be allowed for eaota
fleece, the duty thereon would le sixty or seventy-two
cents, and tnis may be taken as the
utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer
by reason oi this duty. Eighteen dollars would
thus represent the iuereased price of tne wool
irora twenty-five sheep, and 8?ti tbat from the
wcol of fifty sheep; aud at present values this
addition would amount to about one-third ot
i s price, if upon iu sale the farmer receives
this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his
bands charged with precisely that sum, which
in its changes will aciheie to it until it reaches
the?ousumer V hen manufactured into cloth
and other goods and material for use its cost Is
not only inc reased to the extent of the farmsr'a
tariff profit, but a further tum b as beeu added
for the benefit of the manufacturer under tae
operation of other tariff la wg.
in the meantime the day ariives when the
farrrer Cuds it necessary to purchase woolen
goods and material toclothe himself and fam
ily for the w inter. When he faces tbe trade
man forthat purpose he discovers that he is
obliged not only to return in the way of in
crested prices, bis tarifi profit on the wool he
sold, and which then, perhaps, lies before him
in mannfactuied form, but that he must add a
considerable sum tbereio to meet a further in
crease in cost csused lya tariff duty on the
rranufacture. Thus in tue end be is aroused to
tbe fact tbat he has paid upon a moderate pur
chase, aa a result of the tariff scheme, which,
when he sold bis wool seemed so profitable an
in erase in price, more than sufficient to sweep
away all the tariff profit he received upon the
wooi be produced and sold.
Vhen the number of farmers engaged In
wool raising is compared with ail the farmers
in the tountry, and the small proportion tnev
bear to our (opula.ion is cpuslue:ed; when it
L made apparent that, in the case of a large
pait of those w hoos n sheep, the benefit oi the
present taiiff on wool is illusory, ano, above alt,
when it must be conceded that the increase ol
tbe cost of livingcaused by such Urttt becomes
a burdt n upon those with moderate menus aud
the poor, the employed and unemployed, the
sick Ld weli. ana the young and old. and that
it c nsiituus a tax which, with releutiessgrasp,

INCREASFD COST AND ABt'SKS.
In speaking of the increased cost to the con
sumer of our home ta. li.'acture, resulting from
a duty laid upon im. . rte d articles of the sarae
description, the fact is rot overlooked that
ecru petition amoug our domestic producers
sometimes hss the eiltet of keeping the price
ot their products below the highest limit al
lowed by such duty. But it Is notorious that
this competition is too often stianeled by com
binations quite prevalent at this time, and fre
quently called trusts, which have for their ob
ject the regulation of the tupplyand prlc cf
commodites made and sold y members of the
combination. The peopleHfan hardly hope for
apy consideration in the operation of these
selfish schemes, if, however, in the absence of
suctrcombinrt-on, a healthy and free competi
tion reouces the price of any particular dutia
ble article of home production below the limit
which it might otherwise reach under onr tar
iff laws, and if, with such reduced price, its
manuiaciuie continues to thrive, it is entirely
evident tbat one thing has been discovered
which should be carefully scrutinized in an ef
fort to reduce tai atlon.
The necessity of combination to maintain the
price of any commodity to the tariff oolnt.
lurnishes proof that someone is willlDg to acept
lowe prices lor stich commodity, and that such
prices are remunerative, and lower prices pro
duced cy competition prove tne same thing
Thus where either of these conditions exist, a
imse ouia seem to be presented lor an easy re
duction of taxation.
The considerations which have been ore
sented tourhing cur tariff laws are Intended
oniy to enforce an earnest recommendation
that the surplus revenue of the Government be
prevented by the reduction of our custom lut-
lcsand.at tbe same time, to emphasize a sue
pest ion that In accomplishing thia purpose, we
may discharge a double duty to our peoole bv
granting to them a measure of relief from tariff
taxatiou In quarters where it is most needed
and from sources where it can be moat fairly
auu juauj atcoruea.
OCR MAN l' FACTI' RES.
Nor can the presentation made of such con
Bideraiions be. with anv degree of fairness, re
garded as evidence of unlnendliness toward our
manufacturing interests or oi any Jack of appre
ciation of their value and importance. These
Interests constitute a leading and most substan
tial element of our rational greatness, and fur
nish the proud prorf c our country's progress.
But if In tbe emergency that prises upon us
our manu factnrers are asked to surrender
something for the public good and to avert dis
aster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful rec
ognition of advantages already afforded, ahould
lead them to willing co-operation. No demand
is made that tbey shall forego all the benefits of
governmental regard : but they cannot fail to
be admonished of their duty as well as their
enlightened self-interest and safety when they
are reminded of the fact that financial panic
and collapse, to which the present condition
tends, ailord no greater shelter or protection to
our manufacturers t'uan to our other Important
enterprises. Oportunlty for safe, careful and
deliberate reform la now offered; and i?one of
ussbonld be unmindful of a time whew an
abused and irritated people, beetles of those
who have resisted timely and reasonable relief,
mar insist upon a radical and sweeping ratlfl
cailon of their wrongs
The difficulty attending a wise and lair revi
sion of our tariiT laws is not under estimated.
It will require on the part of the Congress great
labor and care, and especially a broad and na
tional contemplation o' the subject, and a pa
triotic disregard of such local and selfish claims
as are unreasonable and reckless of the welfare
of the entire country.
PCTIAriLJC ARTiri.U.
Oder are present laws more than four thou-
sand articles are subject to duly. Many of these
do sot in any way compete wlta our owr man
ufactures, aud many ire hardly wrih attention
aa subjects of revenue. A considerable reduc
tion enn be made in the apgresate, by adding
them to the free list. The ta atlon of luxuries
present no features of hardship; but the neces
saries of Hie used and consumed by all tbepeo-
f le, the dutv upon which adds to the coitof
iving in every home, should be greatly cheap
ened. The radical reduction of the duties impose!
upon raw material used in manufacture, or
lis free importation, is of course an Important
factor In aoy eflort to reduce the price of these
necessaries; it would uot only relieve them
from the Increased cost caused by the tariff on
such materia, but the manufactured product
being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff
now la id upon auch product, as a compensation
to our manu acturera for the present price of
raw material ould be accordingly modified.
Buch reduction, or free importation, would
serve, beside, to largely reduce the revenue.! ilt
is not apparent bow such a change can have
any injuriona effect upon our manufacturers.
On the contrary, it would appear to give them
better chance in foreign markets with the
n anufacturers of other countries, who etieapen
their wares ty free material. Thus our people
iLlgbt have the o portuntty of extending their
sale! bc;ond the llinl's of hone consumption,
savirg them from tha depression. Interruption
in tuslness, and loss caused by i glutted
domestic market, and Cordllig their em pioves
more reriain and Heaoy kbor, with its remit
lng quiet and contentment.
The question thus impera'ively preeeutM for
solution thould be eppr-'achtd in a spirit
higher than partisanship, and considered in Uie
liht of that regard for patriotic duty which
should characterise the action of those Intrust
ed with the weal of a cni'ding people. But the
obligation to declare party politics and princi
ple is not wantiug to urg2 prompt aud effective
action. Both of the great political parties, now
represented in the Goverument, have, by re
peated and authoritative declarations, con
demned the conditijnof our laws hich per
mits the collection from the peoplelof unneces
sary revenue, and have, in the most solemn
manner, premised its correction: and neither as
citlecs nor t; artisans are our countrymen in a
mood to condone the dcliberato violation of
these pledges.
A CONTMTION, NOT A THF.0RV,
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
not be improved by dwelling upon the theone)
of protection and free trade. This savors loo

which confroute us not a theory. Kellet frcra
this condition may involve a silRin rcciuc'ion oi

TIIE ANNUAL MESSAGE.
The Constitution provides that the President
shall from time to time, give to the ejongress in
formation of the state of the L'nion. It bos
been tbe custom of the Executive, in compli
ance with this provision, to annually exhibit to
the Congress, at the opening of its session, the
general condition of the country, and to detail,
with some particularity, the operations of the
dlncrc-nt Executive Departments, it would be
especially agreeaoie to follow this course at the
present time, and to call attention to the valua
ble accomplishments of these departments aur
ing the last fiscal jear. But! am so much im
pressed with the iaramount impor tance of the
subject to which this communication baa thus
far been devoted, that I shall lorego tne addi

your immediate con sldeiation the "state of the

The reports of tbe heads of departments,
which wul fee submitted, con tain full and ex

There are other subjects not embraced in the

K0MINATIOSS.
The President has sent the following
nominations to tbe Senate:
Lucius Q. C. Lamar, of Mississippi, to
be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
of tbe United btates.
William F. Vilas, ol Wisconsin, to be
Secretary of the Interior.
. Don M. Dickinson, of Michigan, to be
PnitTniilei.flnrl
Charles F. Fairchild, of New York, to be
Secretary of tbe Treasury.
George L. Rives, of Kew York, to be As

Isaac C. Maynard. of New York, to be
Assistant Secretary ol the Treasury.
Sigourcey Cutler, of Massachusetts, to
be Second Comptroller of the Treasury.
James W. Hyatt, of Connecticut, to be
Treaeurer of the United States.
Senatorial courtesy, which has usually
led to the compliment of a confirmation
without reference to a committee when a
Senator or ex-Senator has been nominated
to aoy other office, has never prevailed in
mj.ect to nominations to positions on the
Uench oi tbe Supreme Court, ine last
case preceding tbat of Mr. Lamar was tbat
of Mr. Con kling, who had been out of the
Senate a mach shorter period than that of
Mr. Lamar. Mr. Couklings nomination
waa sent to the Judiciary Committee and
reported back. He was confirmed by the
Senate, and then declined the oilice. It is
probable tbat tbe nominations sent to the
Senate to-day win not ne rormauy iaia oe
fore tbe body until the committees are
formed.

RUSSIAN MILITARY .MOVES.
a rlin I.. I.
tlie Concentrations Is War Coming.
Berlin, December J. There is a renewal
cf the rumorst ere tbat Russia is concen
trating a military force along the Austrian
frontier. These rumois have revived the
feeling of uneasiness concerning Prussia's
intentions. . A
Viinna, December C A Berlin letter
published in tbe Politische Correspondent
asseits that the recent Knuian cavalry
movements in the vicinity of tbe Austrian
frontier were due to the scarcity of forage
in the districts in which the cavalry had
been rationed.
The Fremdemblatt says that the Rus
sian military measures on the frontier are
at variance with the general desire for
peace, and the hopes thereof caused by the
meeting of the Emperors of Germany and
Russia in Berlin. "We wait," says the
paper, ''to see to what extent the Berlin
meeting will icfluence these measures,
which poBsibly were decided upon under
diferent apprehensions. Tbe recent
speech from the German throne, in which
tbe Emperor showed that he was not in
clined to disturb the peace of his neigh
bors, was sufficient for Austria that any
farther gathering of Kussishs on oar
frontier will compel us to take Bimilar
measures in order that we may not be be
hind. Russia's preparations are threaten
ing, and are totally unprovoked."
Birlin, December 6. The Post says:
' The leports of the assembling of Russians
on the Galic'an fiontier evoke apprehen
sions of a blow against Austria. Whether
tbat blow which is not intended with the
yiew of attaining 6nds wherein Germany
has never opposed Russia, but for other
farther-reaching purposes will admit
Germany's remaining' at peace for any
length of time, is a qnestion which, doubt
lets, Russia has long since answered."
THE METAL MARKETS-
The Power of the French Syndicate Felt in
New York Again.
New Yobk, Decembor C The power of
tbe French syndicate was again felt upon
the metal market this morning. . Tin and
copper, both of which metala the syndicate
largely controls, took an upward tendency
and were quoted in tee rirst cable at an
advance of 3 per ton in tin, and
178 fid in copper. Spot tin was sold down
at 103 per ton and futures at 110. Clos
ing prices on copper showed a raise of
from 10 to 15 per cent. About 1,250,000
pounds changed hands. Lead was steady
at .r.07?2 to 5.110 per pound. Tin was dull
but firm at 04 to ü for spot and 35 to
33 !4 for luturts.
It bas been discovered who tbe agent of
the French syndicate is, aud hisoperations
aie closely watched by local operators.
TLe agent is 8. Mandell. He acquired a
fortune as a meta-operator on the London
Ext barge some years ago, but by an un
let ky turn lost all. He came to thia coun
try penniless, but soon acquired the repu
tation of an exceptionally Bharp, well
pested trader, At present he is almost
mrstantly on the floor of the Metal Ex
change in business hours, and is an active
and extentive buyer for the controlling
syrdicate which he represents.
In regard to lire at Calumet and Heel a
copper mines it was reported on the ex
change that the fire had gained such head
way ibat neither the steam nor carbonic
acid that had been introduced to quench
the conflagration had any apparent eSect
upon it, and at last accounts it waa be
lieved tbat It would be neceseary to Ücod
the whole mine with water, in which case
it would suspend operations for the greater
part of a year.
C. II. A- D . Troublea iu Court Again.
Dayton, O., December 6. A cross peti
tion was filed in court this evening in the
case of Charles J. Helnsheimer and others
againBt the Dayton, Fort Wayne and Chica
go R. RM asking for a receiver and foreclos
ure. Thia has created as great a sensation
as the original petition. The C. H. & D.
in this cross-petition acknowledges Hein
sheimer'a allegations are true, and unites
with him In prayer, and claims a large In
tern tin tne road. It alleges that Ivea and
Stayner appropriated more than one
million dollars to their own use, and
forming the Ohio Valley Construction
Company, and contracted for the construc
tion of the Dayton and Ironton railroad.
The C-, H. and D. asks that an accounting
be taken of the moneys of the C, H. and
D. invested in tbe Dayton, Fort Wayne
and Chicago by Ives & Co,, and tbat all of
its securities in tbe bands of William N.
Cromwell, assignee of Ives &. Co., and all
the securities of the Dayton, Fort Wayne
and Chicago held by the C, H. and D.
acquired from Irving A. Evans, ahall be
ordered sold and appropriated to the pay
ment of the sum which the court shall
find to be due the C, H. and D. road, and
for the appointment of a receiver and for
other relief
Counterfeiters Caught, (
Wilkisbabbk, Pa., December 0. James
Wilson, alias Hanlan, and Judd Wolcott,
notorious counterfeiters, were arrested by
Federal officera to-day. Their counter
feiting establishment, from which they
were turning out bogus silver dollars, and
which was also seised, was located in the
cabin of an old boat at Mill Creek.

probable, that the majority aide will be
completed to morrow.

Happy Eons Dints of Free Trade The
CommeLtaof the London Press.
New York, December G. The Times in
its editorial on the President's message,
will say: "Mr. Cleveland haa done an act
of statesmanship in tbe best sense. Recog
nizing a great dnty, he has performed It
with courage, with firmness, and at the
right lime. And he has performed it so
that every honest man must see that it is
an honest act. judged by any or
dinary standard of political expediency,
the President's act is inexpedient. He has
forced upon his party an issue as to which
the party is divided, and so divided
that unless the minority yield, it can
defeat the will of the majority. He haa
done this on tha eve of a national contest
in which a considerable number of men of
influence in the party have been urging
him to avoid this issue, and threatening
him and the party with disaster if he did
not avoid it. On the other hand there is
nothing in this issue, thus presented, by
which Mr. Cleveland could hope to draw
from the Republican party any votes. Nor
this alone, for if the protectionist faction
in the Democratic party carry out their
own desires, or do what they have con
tinually declared tbey would do, Mr.
Cleveland bas done the oae tning by which
he could imperil the prospect of his own
renomination. It places Mr. Cleveland
far above any of the leaders to whom the
Republican party has of late lent a hearing,
and above most of the leaders of his own
party."
The Sun will say : "It is not a common
place document, for it is simple, inteliigi
ble land coherent, and the quality of
brevity is chiefly due to the fact tbat all
Other topics of national interest are dis
missed in a lump or postponed as inconse
quential in tbe presence of tbe one prob
lem of scpreme importance the question
of tariff revision. He declares
that the theoretical question as between
protection and free tn.de is 'entirely irrel
evant,' and yet the most striking and in
teresting part of the message is devoted to
precisely that sort of an argument with
which any free trade Representative
in Congress, or any free
trade professor in a college
class-room, or tbe author of any free trade
text book of political economy, would
begin an attack upon tne theory of protec
tion. This, we Bay, is the most notable fact
about tbe message. Mr. Cleveland bas
never before in a public paper taken sides
equarely upon this question. He has done
so now in a manner that leava room for no
misunderstanding. It is a bold thing to do,
and the President deserves credit for
the plainness of his speech. Nobody can
accuse him of hedging or haggling, or lug
gling with words. So far does he go upon
the familiar lines of the free trade speeches
in Congress or elsewhere, tbat we find him
betrayed here and there, no doubt uncon
seil usly, into an exhibition of slight irri
tation against American manufacturers as
a class, almost as if tbey were conspirators
and public enemies."
The World will say: "The admirable
message of the President has given to the
Democratic party what it has long lacked
an issue and a leader. The issue is tax
reiorrr. The leader is the President.
It can hardly be that the President has
not at this juncture influence' enough to
secure the union oi the Democrats in the
House upon a measure of revenue redac
tion BDd tariff reform."
Tbe Herald will eay: "The message is
an able, conservative and statesmanlike
document, which, unlike many other
messages, will be read by the people and
discusEed by them. We are glad
to see tbat he favors free wool, which
would give greatly increased and perma
nent procrerity to our great woolen in
du8t:y, and enable our manufacturers in
other branches at the same time
to dispose of large quantities
of their products In wool producing
countries to tbe immediate benefit of work
men in almost all branches of manufac
ture. The message
will not please extremists of either side,
freetraders or protectionists, but it will,
we believe, please and sati-fy the people
at large, and it puts upon both parties in
Congress the solemn duty to relieve the
country Irom a most senous danger.
The Tribune aays: 'For the first time
in the country's history, the President's
annual message omits all reference to the
many grave public Interests respecting
which good citizens or all parties agree,
and is exclusively devoted to an issue be
tween parties. President Cleveland gives
CoDgms no Information about the hsh
ery qnestion, the pending negotiations
with Great Britain, or relations with other
foreign powers. The nearest ap
proach to this8trange performance in the
annual messages of previoua Presidents
was when Mr.Buchannan devoted most of a
message to ajdefense of his policyin Kansas.
The President can hardly be considered at
tracitve, in the light of Its results.
President Cleveland seems refreshingly
unaware that his entire message is inspired
by extreme free trade theories. It seems
never to have occurred to the President
that foreign prices are, in fact, to a large
extent, controlled by tbe American de
mand. It is hard to understand how the
precedent reconciles his statements re
specting the surplus revenue with
official reports of his subordinates. The
Treasury Department has within a week
reported that the currency of all kinds in
circulation, outside the treasury, is $52,
000, C00 more than it waa five months ago,
and $119, 000, 000 more than it was seven
teen months ago, and yet the President
effirms that a withdrawal from the use of
the peoples, circulating t medium
has lately subjected the busi
ness community to distress.
But the President's gravest error
Is the unfounded assumption that a need
ful reduction of revenue can be attained
by lowering duties and thus inviting lar
ger importations. It is a message
which his political friends will keenly re
gret, and which they will labor to explain
J away when tbey come to confront the
