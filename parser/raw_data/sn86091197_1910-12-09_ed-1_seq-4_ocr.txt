A FINE EDITION
The Morning Post of Idaho Falls
has just issued their Industrial Edi
tion of 1910. It contains seventy
five pages with a cover, and is a very
creditable piece of work mechanically
as well as from a literary point of
view.
It covers the Upper Snake Rivet
Valley from Blackfoot to Ashton,
each town being represented by write
ups and advertisements of its busi
ness men.
Blackfoot was very generously ac
corded double the amount of space
for the write-up of the town itself
as was their own city of Idaho Falls.
A rather amusing feature of this
edition is the time at which it ap
peared. It was to have come out last
May, or June, and their delay of six
or eight months makes some of it a
little out of season. Advertising bi
cycles in December raises a question
of whether they are at the wrong end
of the season, or preparing for an
open winter. Much of the advertis
ing is for real estate for the summer
of 1910, and may still be effective,
but some of the firms have gone out
of business, moved away or gone into
the hands of receivers between the
time the advertising orders were giv
en and the time the edition went to
press, in this way badly perforating
the stock expression of the publishers,
"Hitch to the Po«t."
But the publishers said it would
"come out," and it came. Most of
the advertising was paid in advance,
and if the patrons were impatient
they have not said as much as they
might have done. Some of the candi
dates who took space in view of the
aid it might be to them in the cam
paign of 1910 and who have since
been beaten, are in a funny quandary
to decide whether it was wisdom to
"hitch to the Post" or whether the
Post might not have brought them
success if this edition had not re
mained "hitched" so long.
The article about Blackfoot was
written the 9th of May for use in that
edition the week following, and con
tained generous mention of the meet

ing of the grand lodge of the Knights
of Pythias, and the musical festival
to take place in June, and it reads a
little awkwardly coming out in Dec
ember following, but they did not
charge anything for that, and if our
choral association pulls off another
festival next spring we shall have had
some announcements sent out so
quick before we knew it was to hap
pen already yet. The opening day
of The Pingree Townsite, also an
nounced for June, might be done
over In 1911 with better effect than
before.
ASYLUM SUPERINTENDENT
MAY GO
Last week we published a list of
appointments which may be made by
Governor-elect Hawley, and we have
since investigated the matter of asy
lum boards and superintendents.
The asylum at Blackfoot Is under
direction of Dr. C. A. Hoover, Repub
lican, who was appointed by the
board of regents, who are appointed
every two years' by the governor.
The Northern Idaho Asylum is gov
erned in the same way, but has al
ready been under direction of Dr.
J. W. Givens, Democrat, who was for
fifteen years superintendent at the
Blackfoot Asylum, about ten years
of which was under Republican gov
ernors.
Unlike most of the boards govern
ing state institutions, the asylum
boards are not appointed one member
every two years, but the whole board
may be discarded and a new board
and a new superintendent may be
put fn charge at once, leaving the
whole matter in the hands of men
new and unfamiliar with the problems
before them.
Whether the incoming Democratic
administration will leave a Republi
can in charge at Blackfoot as the
Republicans did a Democrat for so
many years remains to be seen.
ONLY PARTLY TRUE
Editor Porter of The Paris Post
last week gave vent to his feelings in
this wise:
"Editors are compelled by the pro
fit system to cri'ngingly stultify* them
selves in order to live. There is no
such thing in America as an inde
pendent press. There is not one of
us who dares to write our honest
opinions. We are paid for keeping
our honest opinions out of the paper.
Any of us who would be so foljjsh as
to write honest opinions would be put
on the streets looking for another job.
"The business of the journalist is
to destroy the truth, to lie outright,
tc pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the
feet of Mammon, and sell his country
and his race for his daily bread."
The above is only partly true, but
the publisher who survives knows
there is enough truth in it that he
has learned to close his eyes upon
many things that it might be well to
publish, but it would be infinitely
better for his own bank account if
he left it out.

ANOTHER HEAD LOOPED OFF
Boise, Dee. 2.—For reasons which
he declined to discuss, Governor
James H. Brady yesterday accepted
the resignation of State Bank Com
missioner William G. Cruse, to take
effect immediately.
While Governor Brady has nothing
to say as to the reasons leading up to
the step, he announced last night
that he had not yet selected a suc
cessor to Mr. Cruse, hut would prob
ably do so within a day or two. In
the meantime the duties of the office
will be assumed' by Deputy State
Bank Examiner H. S. Geary, who has
been connected with die office for
some time past.
While the resignation of Mr. Cruse
was entirely unexpected, those fam
i'iar with the situation locally say
that the governor has been dissatis
fied with the manner'in which the
bank examiner has conducted his
office for some time past,
freely stated that the circumstances
surrounding the connection of the
official with the defunct Hailley bank
constituted the direct cause of the
governor's step, and In" many quar
ters the action of the governor In
demanding the resignation of the
bank commissioner was by no means
a surprise.

SAYS BILL TO HARNEY
President Adopts Modern Political
Methods With O'Neil
Wallace Banker Considers Taft One
of the Best (Qualified Men for the
Office—Commercial World
Has Confidence in His
Ability
"Barney, I'm glad to meet you, but
I'm sorry you're skinned," was the
way President William H. Taft
greeted B. F. O'Neil when the latter
entered the president's office in Wash
ington, D. C., a few days ago.
"That is what he said," commented
Mr. O'Neil today, "and he shook
hands just this way," and he illus
trated with a good, old-fashioned grip
and pump-handle movement.
"I had a pleasant visit with the
president," continued the Wallace
banker. "In my judgment he is one
of the best qualified men to govern
t.he people that we have ever had.
He has a splendid legal mind, a good
heart, and meets all comers on the
level.
Predicts Second Term
"In my mind, without doubt, he
will he a mighty popular man at the
end of his term and I'm sure he will
succeed himself. With such a man at
the head of governmental affairs we
can successfully look for better times
if it is within his gift. The commer
cial world seems to have explicit
confidence In his ability. I can see
where he is growing in strength every
day."
Mr. O'Neil had not expected to call
on the president. He was in New
York when lie received a telegram
from Charles D. Norton, secretary to
the president, stating that Mr. Taft
would be glad to see the Idaho man
and talk over Idaho affairs at any
time it should prove convenient to
Mr. O'Neil. The latter replied at
once, naming the day he could be in
Washington. When Mr. O'Neil ar
rived at the White House he found
some thirty or forty people in the
waiting-room and was contemplating
with some grief the prospect of wait
ing until they had all been attended
to.
Had Open Sesame
However, to his pleasure, his card
brought an immediate call from the
president to come in. Mr. O'Neil was
closeted with the president an hour
or more. What was said during that
time is a matter of conjecture. Mr.
O'Neil declines to discuss it.
Mr. O'Neil was glad to return
home. He has been in New York and
other eastern places for many weeks.
"As the old saying is. 'there is no
place like home'," he asserted. "Par
ticularly like a home among the good
citizens of my own city and county
and among so many good friends in
the state of Idaho to whom I am so
much indebted. 1 hope I will be able
to reciprocate in some way for their
goodness ad kindness to me."
Speaking of conditions in the East
Mr. O'Neil said:
Good Times Coming;
"The concensus of opinion there
seems to be that better financial
times are coming. The money situa
tion seemed much easier when I left
New York than it was some time ago.
and everything commercially looks
bright. The merchants are expecting
a good business year in 1911.
"The eastern people are becoming
awakened to the growth and deve'op
ment of the west and they are look
ing this way for a future move.
"While in the East 1 met many
western people who were there, some
on pleasure trips and others on busi
ness enterprises."
While at the Holland House in New
York, Mr. O'Neil received a telegram
from J. E. Cloghley of LaGrande,
Oregon, inviting him to attend the
annual Thanksgiving banquet to be
held November 24 at the Dewey Pal
ace in Nampa, Idaho. The telegram
stated that if he did not come he
would grievously disappoint 100 of
the boys. Mr. O'Neil w'as compelled
to send his regrets.
Mr. O'Neil went to Harrison this
afternoon on a business trip but will
return tomorrow.

CONGRESS NOW IN SESSION
Washington, D. C., Dec. 6.—The
reading of President Taft's annual
message to congress began shortly
after 12 o'clock, tt contains about
3000 words.
The leading features of the mes
sage are these:
He declares it is time to stop leg
islating with reference to regulation
of corporations and to witness the
effect of a vigorous execution of the
laws already on the statute books.
The exact limitation upon business
methods imposed by law will doubt
less be made clearer by pending deci
sions of the supreme court.
Just at this time, the president
says, he believes the activities of the
government, in addition to enforce
ment of the laws, should be directed
toward economy or administration,
the enlargement of opportunities for
foreign trade, the building up of
home industry and the strengthening
of the confidence of capital In domes
