Some persons imagined that the word

with tbe remotest iiei of offering an

of allowing tLe oldest continuous mem

Mr. Ambler was alto permitted to select
a seat for Mr. Stephens, of Georgia. At
fifteen minutes past one Mr. Cox re
potted that tho committee had waited
on tbe President, and that a communi
cation in wilting would bs sent to the
house forthwith.
The speaker submitted the quettion
whether the house would draw seats, or
have tbe President's message read. The
former course wa3 adopted. A blind
folded page drew tho numbers from the
box, one by one, aud the member
drawn came from the outside of the

cupied the seat which he purposed hold

dicating that the atmosphere abDUt
there was too stioug for him. It was

listened to with considerable interest
and attention, but after passing the por-
lions relating to education, church
properly and Cuba, the a'tention began
to flag. 7 be member gradually retired,
so that during the reading of tbe latt'Jr
half the mesSiije there were not prob

THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE KLTUBLIC.
To the Senate and llonpo of Representatives:
Iu submitting my saventh annual
meesage to congnss, in this, the Cen
tennial year cf our national existence
as n free and Independent people, It af
fords me great pleat ure to recur to the
advancement that has leen made from
tbe time of the colonies, one hundred
yeatsago. We were then a people num
bering only tbiee millions ; now we num
ber more than forty millions. Then our
industries were confined almost exclu
sively to the tillage of the soil: now
manufacturiee absorb much of ihe labor
of the country. Our libert es remain
unimpaired. Toe bondsmen have beon
freed from slavery; we have become
possessed of the lespect, if not friend
ship, of all civilized nations; our pro
gress has been great in all the arts, in
tcierce, commerce, navigation, mining,
mechanism, law, medicine, etc, and iu
geneial education.
GOH PROGRESS,
Our progress Is likewise en cou racing
Our thirteen States have become thirty
eight, including Colorado, which has
taKen the step to becomo a State, and
eignt Territories, including the Indian
nrd Alaska, and excludius Colorado.

"uauuu iu iuo x ituiuc; ua tue soutn we
haveextended to tbe Gulf of Mexico, and
in the west from the Mississippi to the
Pacific. One hundred yea-s ago tho

the telegtaph, the reaping, sewing and
uioueru printing macnines, anu numer
ous other inventions of scarcely less
value to our buslnees and happiness
wtrc entirety uuanown,
MANUFACTURES.
In 1776 manufacturers scarcely existed
even in all this vast territorry, bat in
io(o more man two millions of persons
were employed as manufacturers, pro
ducing two billion one hundred million
dollars of produce, m amount an
nuauy nearly equil to our national
dent. lrom nearly tho whole of (hp
population of 1776 being engaged in the
one occupation of agriculture, in 1870 so
numerous anu aivrsined had necome
tho occupations cf our people, that lass
man six minions cue or more than forty
millions wore so encased. The extra.
ordinary effect produced in our country
by a r.sort to such occupations has built
a marKti lor tne products of farti e land
distant from tbo eeaUosrd and the
markets of tho world. The American
system of working various and exten
sive manufactures, next to the plow and
too pasture, ana nuuing connecting
railroads and steamboats, ha produced
in our distant country a result not
tqualedby the intelligent parts of the
other nations. Toe ineenuitv and tho
skill of American mechanics has been
demonstrated at homo and abroad in a
manner most flittering to their pride;
but for the extraordinary cenius .mri
ability cf our mecbanca the achieve
ments of our agriculturalists, manufan-
turers and transporters throughout tho
country would have been imnassible of
attainment.
OUR MINING INTERESTS.
Tho nroiflei'3 of tlm miner lina olar
been great; oT coal, our production wra
small; now many millions of tons are
mlued anuuRlIy. So with iron, which
formed scarcely an appreciable part of
our product half a century ago. We
now produce more than the world con
sumed at the beginning of our national
existence, ljeau, zinc and copper, from
being articiei of import, we may expect
to be large exporters of In the near fu
ture, the development of gold aud sil
vtr mines throughout tho States ami
Territories has not only been remarka-
Lie, up. Las had a Iuige iulluence upon
the businesscf tl commercial nation?.
OUR COMMERCE.
Our morchanu in tbe last hundred
years have had a success, and estab
lished aieputatton for enterprise, saga
city, progress aud integrity unsurpassed
by the people of older uationalties. Tbla
good name Is not confined to their
homes, but gcei out on everv sea and
into every port where commerce enters.
With equal pride wo can point to our
progress ia all of the learned professions.
As we are aie now about to enter unon
the second Centennial, commenc
ing our manhood as n nation, it is
well to look back upon tbe nas.t
and aludy what will be best to preserve
and advance our future greatness. From
tho fall of Adam for his transgression to
the present day no nation has ever been
free from threatened dangers to its proe
perity and happiness. Wo should look
to the(danger3 that threaten and remady
them so far as lies in our power.
EDUCATION OF THE MASSES.
We are a republic whereof one man
is as good as another before the law.
Under such a form of government it is
of the greatest importanca that all
should be poisessed of education and In
telligence enough to cast a vote with a
right understanding of its mtauiutr. A
laige association of ignorant men can
not with any considerable power oppose
euccessiui rcs;s auca ta tyranny, as
oppression from tho educated few wiil
inevitably sink in acquiescence to the
wilt of lnteirgence, whether diiected by
the demagogue or by priestcraft. Heuce
the education of the mass becomes of
the first necessity for the preservation of
our iuetitutions. They aie worth pre
serving, because they have secured the
greatest good to the greatest proportion
of the population of any form of govern
ment, yet, uovitu. ah other forma cf
government approach it just in propor-
uuu iu me kuuerui umueion oi educa
tion and independence of thought and
action. As tho primary sten. the rafore.
to our advancement in all that has
marked our piozress in the nast
entury, IsuKse:tfor your earnest con
sideration, and mcst earnestly re
commend it, that a constitutional
amendment submitted to tho Iegfala-
turts or me several mates for ratifica
tion, making it the duty of each of the
several States to establish and forever

aihehtic or pagan, and prohibiting the
granting of any school funds or sohool
taxes, or any part tln-reof, by legislation,
municipal tr otherwise, for tha bsnpfit
of any other object of any nature or
kind whatever.
UNTAXED CHURCH PROPERTY.
Iu connection with this important
ruestion I wou d also call your attention
to the iinportanco of correcting an evil
that, if permitted ti continue, willprob-
lily lead to gioit trouble in our land
before the cloBe of the nineteenth cen
tury. It is the accumulation of a vast
amount of unt.xed chuicb property. In
isoa, l neiieve, the church property of
the United States, which paid no tax,

London, December 7. The agent at
Rochester reported this morning that a
boat had come ashore in that city from
the steamer Dautschland, from 'Biemen,
Dicemb'sr4tb, fjr New York. Ihe boat
contained one man and the dead bodies
of two others. The man reports that
the two men perished from exposure,
having been in tne boat forty-eight
nour?. August, me name ot the quar
termaster of the Dentschland, who ar-.
rived in the boat.reportB that the steamer
strucK on a sanoDauKi in the North Sea,
and ho believes she is tctally lost, with
all her pa'seugera and crew, numbering
one hundred and fifty. One boat left
the ship before that occupied by August
and his comcanions4Tho fate of that
boat is unknown. Tnename of one of
the men who died in August's boat is
forfentein.
Olltich & Co., agents of the North
German Lloyd steamship line, to which
mo ueutscuianu 03iongs, received a
dispatch from London, which saya that
tne aumirauy omcsra reported that the
boat picked up was washed away from
tne UcUiscnianu, anu that it was
supposed that the steamer struck at
some point on theKettish Knock sands.
A tug has been sent out toseareh for her
and render assistance. The agents of
tbo lino have grave fears concerning
the Deuuchland, and do not conceal
them. They suppose that the vessel
went ashora in a fog, as latest weather
reports from England contain accounts
of thicK weather on mo eastern coast,
which probably extended over the North
eea. In January last the Deutechland
encountered terrible storms while on
her way to thia port from Bremen, but
was safely taken bask to the other side
of tho Atlantic, although her machin
ery had been disablpd. She has only
made one trip from Southampton since
encountering tho storm, when she was
laid up along with a half dozen steamers
or tho line, aud has not been Uied since
February last. The captain of
the Seutschland, Captain Luding, a
tnorougniy efficient officer, wa3 placed in
cuarge or me company's do'jks at
uremsnuaven a snoic tinio ago, and a
new captain, whose name has not been
ascertained, was transferred to tlm
DdUtechland. The number ofnagseneers
on board ia not known, but information

Loncisands. further toward the shore
tha i the Kentish Knock. Two tuca and
a life-boat have proceeded to the scene
of the disaster. Kentish Knock -sandB

The aeents of the North German
Lloyd's steamship company state that
me t reamer ueutscniaad has two firat-
class cabin, twenty-four second-class and
ninety-seven sleerasje passencers. The
commander of tbe British man-of-war
Penelope telegratihs from Harwich to
the admiralty, that nlty lives have been
lost. The remainder of the passengers
and crew have landed at Harwich, where
they are under the care of the German
consul. Quaitermaster August, in his
statement says that tho name of the cap
tain ot me ueutscnianu is uisius; that
tho steamer left Bremen Sunday morn
ing, and struck the knock on Sunday
evening. .Every eftort waa made to get
ner ou, out in vain. The eea washed
over the ship, carrying away much of
her gear. The captain kept very cool.
Immediately after the shin struck, he
ordered the life-beats to be distributed
among the passengera aud crew. The
next morning, as it was thought the
shipwai about to break up, the order
waa given to lower the boats. August
ana two seamen vera detailed to man
one of the boats, which capsized twice
in lowennir. vvnen she righted, they
drifted away from the steamer. They
tried to pull back, but could not, aa a
heavy snow storm prevailed and the
weather was pierdng cold. Hia two
companions perished from exposure.

diepatch from their agentjat South
ampton: The Deutschland ran ashore
on Long Bandp. Fifty cf the passengers
and crew are reynrted drowned. Pare
of tbe passeager and crew landed at
Harwich on Tuesday afternoon.
Further particulars are wanting.
The Deutschland fired roakeis all day
Monday, and until Tuesday mornicg,
aud, although they were aeen from
Warwick, it waa impracticable to send
assistance until the gale moderated. At
tour o'clock thia morning the tug Liver
pool brought in fifty-one persons, in
cluding all tbe officers except the fourth.
Ono child died on board the tug. Tbe
number of dead bodies in the steamer's
cabin was fifty, and the others are
probably in tbe br.ati which are missing.
So far only about fifty-four are known
to be saved. Beck, the quartermaster,
I? apparently dying, his swollen and
blackened appearauce indicating frost
bite. His narrative was given with
great difficulty. He aaya hta boat wa8
attached to the ship by a rope, which
broke, aod the boat fell to the leeward.
There being no oars, it was impos
sible to return, eo sail was rigged
and the boat drove before the wind
all day and tbo follqwing night. A
steerage passenger name 1 Forsentien,
bsing lightly clad, and without shoes
and stockings, soon died, and a seaman
shortly after. Aifive o'clock this morn
ing a boat wis perceived by an artillery
man on duty at the fort at Sheerness,
and Beck vaa rescued. The captain
gays that distress signals were answered
frcm tbe ligkt vessels and coast guard
station at Harwich during Mouday
evening, but owing to the fierceness of
tha gale it was impossible to send assist
ance. No lifeb;at waa to be had and
none other could live.
