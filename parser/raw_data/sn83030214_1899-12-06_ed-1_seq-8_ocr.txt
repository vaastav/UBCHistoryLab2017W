THE SENATE C?BBENCY RILL.
Most of those who desire the best mrronoy
?btainahlo. and baiter? that no other is lit for
the use of the self governing people of theoe
United Statc-s, will probably consider the bill
prepared by the HepublloanR of the Senate
Finanop Committee dKtinctlj? preferable in
ajany provisions to the bill prepared by the Re?
publicans of the House, ?t bga pomo detecta
is has the othor bill, but both will probably be
modified somewlia?, either by asseter?] Repob
Jran cfliictis, if ODO siiould be called, or by
irparatf action of the Republicana in the two
Douse??. These meii-ures leave no doeent ex
ruso for dotibtiui; that iba RepabHcan Coiigreaa
lien sincerely <le>lr?? to plieej the curren.?\ on
the soundest possible basis, and in the main the
Itcps by which they seek that ??n?l are tie? same
? boih houses. Both measures open with a
formal declaration that the gold standard is
now and In future shall be established, that all
?ther forms of money shall be kept at parity in
itan?ard gold ruin, thai ? gold raserre fund
?hall be formed and used for redemption of
Botes only, and rapteeisbcd if necessary by salis
>f bonds.
The differences between the tWO measures
|re of some Importane?. The lirst sentence of the
Btnata bill is the noal compad end Impresalve
part of either measure, defining the standard
rold dollar, .leclarlnp that "all ?Oriiis of ???..???.?
'?issiu'd or <?.lined by the I'nlted State?* <hall be
"maintained at a paliti of value with this
"standard," ami providing that United States
ind Treasury notes shall t.e redeemed in gold
roln of such standard. Where the. House bill ore
?tes a separate dlTisloa for redemption, with a
reserv?? fund of |10a\0004XM), the Senate bill
makes it th?? duty of the ,s,.i ret.iry of the Treas
tiry to set ajiart a reserv?? fund of ????,???,???)
,n gold coin, wlilcli shall Im? used for su. li re?
Jemption juiri-.s.-s only. BaaSatefl .nutting a
larger sum Iwiilnd th?? outstanding notes, the
Senate iirovlslon seems to be more dtetlod and
txplicit rregardlng tin? st??ps to maintain their
ralue, including the sales of bonds.
The difference between the two m??asur???? re?
tarding the treatment of silver certificates is
perhaps more apparent than real. The ohjeet
9f both seems to be the gradual retirement of
other forms of paper In denominations of fin
r?r less, and the exclusive occupation of that
field by small silver cerlttlentes For this pur?
pose the Senato bill provides for retirement of
Treasury notes and tb?? l*?ue of silver cortili
rate? instead, and lx?tb bills wem to |??,???<? tbeas
certificates to be redeemed In silver only at
tiatas, but in any emergency to be bo
redeemed as to maintain them at par In gold.
It would purely ho safer, moro readily under?
stood by tho people, and therefore much
stronger, to provide explicitly for redemption In
gold nt the wish of SB* holder of every other
form of money issued or mined liy the (iovern
nn'nt.
Both Mils contain provisions which might be
used for the retirement and cancellation of part
of the legal tender notes. Members of Con?
gress are fresh fn>:n the people, nini they prob?
ably know whether there ls I majority of the
voter?; in favor of any such course. If there
Is no majority to sup|>ort a scheme which has
been most persistently tried In almost counties
War* t'V nilvocntp* of ? ciirretiey entirely Con?
trolled by banks, then It would surely be wise
for Hepiibllcnns of both houses to fake care
that DO provision capable of being thus Inter?
preted and employed should be left In the
measure. The pressoi Secretary Is not a man
to resort to any misconstruction of the law
In order to accomplish anything, but It Is easy
to conceive that I Secretary may be found
In olii,e hereafter who may strain a point In
Order to get rid of the United States notes. If
there are provisions in both bills capable of
being used to that end. the Republicans will
serve the Interests of their party as well us
Of tli.-lr country If they examine such provisions
with much care und guard them against mis?
construction and misuse as far as possible.
THE PRESIDENTE ? E 88 AGE.
Those parts of the President's Message which
relate to the new pO*Se**l< lis of 'lie Pulled
states, and especially to National obligations
an.l opportunities arising out of their SOqttlsl?
Hon. snd which are therefore naturally of pecu?
liar Interest ?it a Unie wbea Congress is called
OPOO to deal with these grave problema BW
discussed in a separate article. The purely
domestic topics of the Message also are deserv?
ing of the careful consideration of Intelligent
citizens, who desire not only to comprehend tbe
discnsslon of them in Congress, but to con?
tribute to that enlightened public opinion by
which the legislative department of the Govern?
ment is expected to be controlled. That th??
President deals with these matters frankly and
sensibly will be generally admitted by fair
minded persons. Of course, among the oppo?
nents of an AdministratlOD then? are always
some who lake ? curious sort of pleasure In
pretending to Und fault because on stated occa?
si?, us it does not seti le out of hand every ques?
tion which it brings to public attention; but
such criticism ls Ineffectual ami unimportant.
As a whole the Prestdent'l Message Is an In?
structive exposition of National affairs, and Its
recommendations are sufficiently explicit.
On tbe subject of currency and finances the
President speaks In a manner which must tend
to strengthen the majority in Congress In Its re?
solve to establish the gold standard and fortify
the Treasury still more firmly. If possible. It Is
true that positive enactments long In force
seem to many persons to be entirely satis?
factory and sufficient, but it is also true that
a still more prevalent sentiment demands some?
thing In addition, and. as the President saga?
ciously remarks, the fortunate situation now ex?
isting "points to the present as the most fitting
"time to make adequate provision to Insure the
"continuance of the gold standard and of public
"confidence In the ability and purpose of the
"Government to meet all Its obligations In the
"money which the civilized world recognizes as
"the best." As one means to this end he renews
his prudent recommendation that greenbacks
once redeemed in gold shall not be paid out
again except for gold.
What the President says concerning the Im?
portance to every commercial nation of an exten?
sive mercantile marine and the melancholy con?
dition Into which our own foreign shipping has
fallen will scarce?;* be disputed snywbera, while
tbe policy which he advises f,,r the rehabilita?
tion of u prostrate and still decaying industry Is
sure to encounter the opposition ,,f all to whom
the word "subsidy*1 Is offensive. In that class
are not a few patriotic and intelligent citizens,
but we think It Is being constantly diminished
by the desertion of men who are not ashamed
in get instruction and profit from the experi?
ence of other nations. The great maritime
Powers of the world have built up their ocean
commerce, and are still building It up, by giving
pecuniary inducements and rewards to individ?
uals. This Is done In various ways, some of
them more or less circuitous. But the practical
encouragement le steadily and deliberately be?
stowed, whatever form it takes, and the prac?
tical results nr?' great and enduring. We be?
lieve that the Government of tbe United States
is more than Justified in doing the same thing.
JUSl how it should be done the President does
not attempt to determine, nor should Congress
prescribe without a more thorough discnsslon of
the question than It has heretofore received.
On other proposais affecting our commercisi
progress and relations the President delivers a
sound and positive Judgment, without rehears?
ing nt length arguments already employed and
familiar. In truth, there Is at this time, while
the latest Commission Is pursuing Its Investiga
tlons. no need to use more than ? few emphatic
words concerning tbe wellnlgfa Indispensable
necessity of SO Isthmian canal uniting the
oceans, and the Immense convenience, to say
the least, of a Pacific cable. If on the subject
Of trusts the Message arrives at no new and
decisive conclusions. Inmost critics will not lind
serious fault with lis author. The simple truth
la that ihis is a proolem on which an extraordi?
nary amount of discussion baa failed to pro?
duce anything iike nn sgreement, even as to
tbe evils for which a remedy Is demanded. The
President's final topic, which touches th?? whole
circle .>f National Interesta li the Civil Service.
He takes occasion to affirm, what there has
been no general disposition to deny, that his ex
ecutlre order of last May was designed to effect
"a more efficient and satisfactory administra?
tion of the system of appointments." We
thought it discreditable and menacing that in
various qusiters bla modification of tbe system
was at once accepted as ? warrant for rather
thinly veiled attacha upon the system itself, it
is gratifying to learn thai In the opinion of those
who p,,sse>s superior means of forming so in
telllgent Judgment after a brief experience tbe
mischief thus done -.vas noi so a?rions as it ap
pea red. and that "the merit system has been
"greatly strengthened and its pennsnence as
"siired" through the flexibility Imparted to it bj
the Presi,leni.
Foin:IG \ RELATIONS.
The "world-power" ststua of the United
states is indicated by the proportion of tbe
Preshh.[it's Message which is devoted to ihe
consideration of foreign relations, in actual
bulk this probably exceeds any former such dis
cnsslon. It certainly exceeds any In the s.ope
and variety of topic? considered NOr are these
devi id of interest ami Importance, There are
no surprises nor sensations; but there are many
gratifying reports, and more than one sugges?
tion which will be heartih comtuended to tbe
sound judt'ineiit of the Nation. According to
the ominous vaticinations of soase, the Mssangs
should be filled with wars and rumors of wars,
and with all manner of embarrassing entangle?
ments; since such were to be the Immediate and
Inevitable results of expansion Bat, on tn?
contrary, ihe keynotes ,,f |t nr- pence nnd free?
dom from entenglemeats, together with a
marked growth In Influence nnd prestige.
s-ver.nl easps ,,f successful nnd satisfactory
arbitration are reponed, In which this country
had interest. Treaties for extradition, for closer
commercial relations, for the settlement of out?
standing claims and disputi?*, and for other
beneficent purposes are likewise reported. The
President's statement concerning Samoa shows
how great a gainer this country has been In the
settlement there securing outright the mo*t val?
uable Island Of the group and retaining In tbe
others all the material advantages It enjoyed
under the tripartite scheme of control. ? ra?
tional and courageous method Is proposed for
dealing with two of the most vexing and Irrit?t
l?g matters In our recent foreign relations,
namely, the exclusion of ?????t?<?.???? food prod
nets from European countries on tha ground of
unbealthfiilness. nnd the lyn.-hltiii of subjects of
foreign Powers In crtaln Stales of this G????.
The President proposes In the former case an
International commission, which shall authorita?
tively investigate ti.baracter or the food prod?
ucts of the nations concerned, and In the latter
be renews the recommendation that the Federal
Government shall assume both power to punish
offenders and responsibility to alien Powers for
the offences committed.
There Is, In fine, ? general report of foreign
relations at once increased In extent and variety
and made more harmonious, practical and benefi?
cent. In entering more directly Into the In?
ternational brotherhood of nations the United
Sin. s has not 1..une a tue,Idler or a mischief
maker, snd bai not involved itself In difficulties.
In exercising the courage of It! convictions and
of Ita opportunities ?t la commanding the respect
of its neighbors, who now con prise all the civil?
Ized nations of the globe. This fed affords, of
curs,?, no ground for selfish exultation. It is
simply the realisation of what wa? to be ex
?.ted and of What should liav.? COttM to pSSS.
Bui it Is none the less gratifying aa a vindica?
tion of a general line of policy which has with
equal zeal been denounced by a noisy minority
and approved by the potenl majority of the
American people
NEW-YORK'S i:o.\D MATERIAL.
The State of New-York enjoys one decided ad
vantage In the work of constructing Improved
roads in tbe fact thai it contains, within Iti
own limits and pretty well distributed through?
out It? area, an ample supply of first rate raw
material. ??? r?? are doubtless other States as
fully liest In this respect, and there are certain?
ly many others not thus blest On the erhole, it
Is doubtful If any other Siale with so great a
proportionate extent Of level and arable land
baa so abondant and well distributed ? supplj
of roadmaking material
Then? are few counties In the State In which
quarries of good road stone are not now In op?
eration, and there are siili fewer In which such
quarries might not profitably be opened. < ?n
I.ong Island there is. we believe, no quarry,
strictly speaking, but there are numerous d?
posits of gravel and bowlders, which may be
utilized for roadmaking with admirable results.
The Hudson Hirer region ls thickly dotted with
quarries of limestone, granite and trap. In the
Ontsklll nnd Shnwangunk mountains and along
the Delaware and Busqoehsnns rivers and tiieir
tributaries bluestone Is plentiful, with a liberal
admixture of sandstone and limestone. Along
the Mohawk Valley and the line of the Prie
Canal, clear to Pake P.rle, sandstone and lime?
stone abound, ns they do northward, on Lake
Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. In the
lake region nnd the Southern Tier sandstone Is
the chief material, with here nnd there an out?
cropping of bluestone. We are not sure that
there is more than one county In the Siate
outside of Long Island In which there ls not
now a quarry of one of these kinds of stone In
operation. And wherever such 11 quarry exists
nothing ls needed but a stone crnsher to enable
the (.inputting of first rate material for Improved
roads.
The vaino of these different stones for road
making varies, of course, but they are all good.
Trap nnd granite nre, no doubt, the best, the
former because of Ita unrivalled binding or self
cementing qualities, and the latter because of
Its hardness and durability. Limestone has fine
binding properties, but Is ton soft io withstand
heavy traffic, Bluestone and other varieties of
sandstone ere not particularly hard, and have
almost no binding qualities.. It ls evident, how?
ever, that these less d?sirable stones may profit
ably be combined With other kinds, and that
thus a road may be made which will be belter
than any of any single kind of stone; while of
course the poorest of them, used alone, will
malic an Incompsrably better toad than mere
slay ami loam.
INDUSTRY AM) INDIANS.
The value of industrial training in th, educa?
tion of backward ra.es is coming more and
more to be recognised The Tribune a few
days ago, aiied attention to Mr. BookerT. Wash?
ington's plea that the way for tin? negro to
make a lilace for himself in this country wns
to become a master of industries. If ?s Inter
eating to note the advancement of the sani??
idea with r?f?ren?a to the Indian by so com?
petent an observer as Misa Rateile Reel, tbe
(.eneral Superintendent of Indian Schools. In
lier annual report. Just submitted, she advocates
strictly industria! teaching for Indian children,
and says that while this practical work of edu?
cation should be rmpbaslsed, the purely literary
Instruction should be narrowed to the simple ele?
ments She orges that tbe Indian girls be
taught cooking, nursing and economic house?
keeping, and equipped to be home makers In
the highest sen.,., t?,,, boys, too, should lesrn
farming, stock raising and the ordinary brades
as well as th?? usual subjects of the common
school.
This report may cause somebody to ask: "Are
"you going to set limits m the advancement of
"the inferior races, keep them In comparative
"Ignorance and drudgery, and ssy thai the beat
"of human knowledge la too good for them?"
That is commonly tbe spirit ,,r reply when tbe
adaptation of any form of education to tbeactusl
needs of pupils la under discussion. It Ignore*
I the fact that higher education la oecessarllj
; built on a background of ok] civlllxatlon. The
; attempi to rei.G it upon a race Jusl emerging
i from barbarism must in the long run prove a
, failure. Some individuals may make n?. t,?
? mend,.us mental leap from the rude simplicity of
their fathers to the bigbly ??< mplex thinking of
the modern world But a race cannot do that.
It must make hast., slowly, and In rising not
i m Us hold On the Soil Its evolution may not
take centurie* as did that of Its teachers, but
it must go through the .same stage? more or
lesa completely, When we are in >Hued to hold
up bands in horror at the notion of deliberately
training Indian and negro children to be iii
telllgent workers even before we train them to
be readers and writers and Lawyers, we should
think where American higher learning would hi?
lf Anglo Saxons bad noi been Intelligent workers
for generations before many of them learned
even to road. I>, the ?>|? imnfary English
branches ,.,??,? ?, thorough training as a house?
keeper s,.,.|i, a pitiful education for an Indian
girl in this da\ and generation when th?? nom
mi's coiieg.? is the fashion, and be is an old
foery who dares to suggest thai lbs bachelor**
degree Is not th?? essential CTOWn of the best
American womanhood'' How ninny of the best
American women who mnde the college woman
possible ware lust auch Intelligent liouoekecpers
as ihm Indian t?lrl would bet Mow man\ of
their fathers w.-re fanners and m,???hanks, with
slight knowledge Of books? They laid the
foundations. They were good citizens, builders
of Sutes, fathers and .BoUisrs of Uiuae who
with a higher learning are sometimes Inclined
to think that learning is the one thing In life,
the panacea for all Ills, whether of the civilized
or savage man.
Now. If we are not rarefili we shall be re?
proached as attacking the higher education.
Far from It. We are merely recognizing the
truth Of the old saying that It Is a pity to spoil
a good blacksmith to make a poor lawyer. We
only believe that the aim of all education should
be lo lit peopl?? lo live best Ihe actual life which
I'ln'umstaiii'es penali them to lead. For people
who have yet far to climb the essentials of prog?
ress are the Irai roiiiilroiimtit. To day places us
farmers and med?anles an? open to negroes
freely when <ith??r moie ambitions places are
not. Those ??-<????????? offer fbern ?he pros?
perity and tbe respected position III the social
organization which they so mueh n??ed as a
foundation for future progress. The Indian's
probten I? somewhat different He Is not so
much under the necessity of oomiuerlng preju?
dice. His lot as an Individual Is less bound up
with raising his race as a arbole, Hut If he Is
to live In civilized so?*lety be must do some of
the work of civilization. He may go off from
hi? people and try to live by his wits, but that
Is a danuerous experiment and one of no benefit
to his follows If he learns to live with his
people and do according to tbe li'irhest standard
of civilization the work which Is Deeded for
their practical life and helps them to approach
It lie Is idraodug the general welfare. If he
takes borne from school many accomplishments
nnd much abstract thought, but no ability to
deal us ?? cftaillaed man with the actual prob?
lems which confront his fathers in trying to
ezlSl in a fashion not that of their ancestors hr?
will neither commend civilization to the bar?
barian nor help In the further advan.???motif of
fliosc Indians who have already settled down
In sobriety and industry. a(lsfl Reel is right In
tliiukfnir It more Important that Indian- should
be good fanners and bonsekeeperfl than that
thej should be learned In letters according to
tbe standard of tli< New Kurland rullile school.
Mayor Van Wyi k must be getting Jealous of
the Controller's progress In winning the respect
Of decent people In spite of his bad associa?
tions. Ills PetulanCJr yesterday treated Mr.
Coler almost as boorishly as if be had boon a re
f tiller.

The planata rcootrnl7lncr that this Is nn age
of trusts, have recently effected a remarkable
combination. At the present time no less than
six of them are grouped together In the same
p.irt of the skies. They are near the sun, too;
and la?rt Saturday evening when the moon was
ness/ that body aJso wa? In the neighborhood.
Jupiter and I'rarius ar?? a little to the westward
of the sun, and Bel before the orb of day. They
are eons> putitly Invisible In the evening.
Mercury, which for several weeks past has be? ?
to tho eastward, came Into conjunction with
the sun last night, and disappears In the same
direction. Venus. Mars and Saturn are earn of
the sun. and are likely to stay so for months
yet. Neptune, the only remaining planet of any
size, Is far removed from his relativen, almost
half the wa) around the celestial dome. In fact.
Hut a close collocation of six planets, such a?
now exists, le observed only once In hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of years.
-e
Congress has resumed business at the old
stand. We hope that "neatness and dispatch"
will prove to be Its motto.
Two men learned yesterday that Illegal regis?
tration Is no Jok?. One of them pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to two years and three
months In Sing S1ng; the other established
no BttCb claim to clemency, and his portion Is
five years at the same reeort. It waa a pretty
good days work, of the kind which ha? been ,
too often left undone.
PERSONAL.
It is believe?] In Kplsiop.il .'hureh circles that the
Her, Dr. ? ?eorge McClellaa Flske. rector of t?\
Stephen'? Episcopal Church. Providence, will t<e
chocen Coadjutor Uabop el Chicago, Although he
Is one of the most extremo High t'hurch men In

report ? als" current that the Kev. Charles Henry
Brent of St Stephen's Church. Mouton, will bo

THE TASTES OF THE CITIES.
WHERE NEW-TDRK AND PARI3 G??? TO
THE PARTING OF THE WATS.
The differences in conscience and taste and sense
of decency and proprie;y are wonderful things.
Marvellous It is to se* what people will stand and
what they will not stand, and then to see what
other people will ?fand and ?That they will not
stand. Here 1? a tale of two cities. New-York the
second city of the world. Is fond of prlieflgats.
It simply cannot get enough of them There Is a
law against them, except under conditions whleh.
were meant to be singularly rigid. The sum of their
rigidity proves to be that you can have a prtseflght
anywhere and at any time .f you can only get hold
of a. building; nnd paint on It, "This Is a clubhouse."
Four-fifths, more or leas, of the prizefights that
take plaoe In New-York are barefaeed frauds, but
that does not make the populace like them one whit
the less. They will go nnd be defrauded, come
nwny and brag that they were defrauded, and then
go straight back to another tight under the ?ame
management nnd Joyously heg the privilege of being
defrauded again. A scalded cat fears cold water,
a burned child dreads the fire, but nothing can
dismay a swindled New-York sporting gent.
All this New-York loves. But If you would play
? pi ay In ? theatre In New-York you must tx? care?
ful to have It clean to a certain extent. It need not
be clean to any large extent, but many and mnny
of the plays that come from abroad have to be
treated with eoap powders and even more violent
mean? to fit them for the sensitive eyes and ears
of the police, to ?ay nothing of the public.
Now almost all ouch plays ns these come from
Purls, the third city of the world. After they have
been disinfected, cleansed and thoroughly aired ob?
jections to them are often found by discriminating
New-Yorkers. Rut oh! If the discriminating New
Yorkers could only see them nnd could understand
them befor?? they were imported! Their vllcness Is
scarcely to be believe 1 by it self-respecting Ameri?
can. There nre things In them, their special Htudents
say, that would have to be explained to the habit?
ual American barroom lounger before he colili
understand how vile they were. Yet In Paris these
plays are acted at all the theatres except a few
which are re?->rvrd for the attendunce of young
girls and boys, and they are seen and understood
nnd applauded by persons who think themaetve*
about ss good ns anybody else In Paris. It might
be thought that Paris could stand anything.
Hut now there comes a dispatch from Paris
which says that If Mr. Jeffries nnd Mr. Corbett
think of giving one of their brutal exhibitions thero
next year they had better ?top thinking of It.
Two newspapers at least have announce?! some?
thing like this Street? of G?'t? Parle can put up
with; the Moulin Rouge It will maintain; on Its
stage and In Its concert halls there are no forbid?
den subjects; but It cannot consent to be offended
by the brutality of a prizefight. There will be
shortly discord In the hemispheres. If New-York
could only have the one bit of discrimination that
Paris has, nnd If Paris could only be without It,
how easy It would be for each man to choose his
city nnd tn live In It.

MUSIC.
MR. J08FJF WEISS'S THIRD RECITAL.
At his third pianoforte recital. Whlcb :.e gave it
Knabe Hall last evening. Mr. Josef \\'.".s? showed
again some of the singular and unfortunate, ai
well os some of the most Interesting. ?Ides of hta
erratic talent. That he has a talent, and that no
small one. for the pianoforte, his previous appar?
ences have shown? but It Is a talent overlaid and
covered up with very many mannerisms and err?n
trlcltles and glaring faults, both In his Intelie? tu?l
view of the music that comes under his cor.sl lert
tlon and In his technical treatment of It. Hy hit
uncouth exaggerations and distortion? of rhyths
and nuance he frequently succeeds In making
straightforward and beautiful music sound string?
und harsh, and he easily runs Into the m. ?? ruth?
less piano pounding. Ye? fr..m all this Wrack ther?
Is continually emerging a phrase, a peaaaga some?
times a whole movemen'- as. last nigh', the ssuassl
movement of his arrangement of an organ .,im?
position by Bach, Brahms's H minor capriccio, from
Op. 76; parts of the Chopin Fantasie and many
places In the Toccata ty Sd.uma'ir. of surpassing
beauty of conception, lovely In tone and color, ?x
qutettety light in execution and a tettght to hear.
But these moments cannot maku Mr. V ? -, a
great artlstt. It would take many of t Km to atone
for his pluless treatment of the two magtiit'.cent
rhapsodies Of Brahms, op. 79, In which his lack
of pois?? lu conception, hi- exagir. ration of ?ynatnlo
contrast and his rhythm twisting were heard tt
their Brorat, And why does Mr. U'.l-s BBbUSB him?
self with such eccentricitle? as making tiie final
measures ?>f Schumann's Toccata an Introductkf
to Chopin'? fantasie, and join the et. 1 of 1 a
minor capriccio of Brahms to the F major romane*
of the same writer by the devious path of a frag?
ment of Sk-gmund's love song from "DM YVa'.kiir?"
and a snatch of Rubinstein's Q major l.ar.-aroll?
(the latter, however, evidently from a mistaken Im
pression that It was to com.? next in the chain of
his programme numbers?? Such thtagB are In
