PLAN O MOV
E
CHAUTAUQUA
Commercial Club Discusses Ques
tion of Bringing Green Lake
Assembly to Willmar.
The regular December meeting
of the Willmar Commercial Club
called out quite a few of the mem
bers in spite of the cold weather.
The most important business con
sidered was a proposition to move
the Chautauqua equipment from
Green Lake to Willmar. The pro
position was made by Mr. Russell
Spicer, president of the Chautauqua
assembly, on behalf of this board.
The proposition is in short that
a new board be organized at Will
mar to take over the property and
continue the sessions of the Chau
tauqua at Willmar. The Chautau
qua at Green lake did pot receive
the patronage necessary to make it
a complete success, thifa largely due
to the poor train service and con
nections. It is proposed to ac
quire the Gilger property of eight
acies on Foot lake and move the
buildings from Green lake on to the
same Theie is a beautiful grove
here and about 2.00U feet ot lake
shore, and the same could be made
an ideal camping and picnic
park. The proposition is that the
property as soon as paid for shall
become the property of the city of
Willmar, the same as the Home
wood park was acquired. The sub
scribers who will contribute the
means will receive their money
with six per cent interest however,
before title passes to the city.
There seems to be no reason why a
properly conducted chautauqua at
Willmar could not be made a suc
cess. With the right Kind of pro
grams there is no doubt that large
crowds could be drawn to the nty.
The acquisition of the auditorium
would be a benefit to the city as
making possible the securing of
conventions and the housing of big
meetings of any kind at times when
the assembly were not in session.
The Green Lake Chautauqua
board claim to have assets to the
value of $5,700 and are willing to
turn over everything to a Willmar
board if the latter will assume the
debts amounting to #4,1)00. The
Gilger property including residence
and other buildings Can be acquired
for this purpose ior ipG.OOO. The
buildings may be removed in good
order to Willm ir, it is estimated, for
about a thousand dollais. It is
undeistood that the First ward peo
ple will come down handsomely in
subscriptions for the project. The
proposition was discussed quite at
length by a number of those present
at last nights meeting, and a mo
tion was carried favorable to the
project, which provided for a com
mittee of five members of the Club
to co-operate with the five resident
members of the Chautauqua in
carrying out the project. Presi
dent Wellin asked for time in which
to appoint this committee,
A communication was read from
the Federation of Commercial Clubs
relative to the holding of a conserv
ation congress in the state dur
ing the winter which would be in
the nature of a monster booster
meeting or institute. There is also
a proposition to put in demonstra
tion patches of intensified farming
near a number of Minnesota towns
in which matter the Federation will
be aided by the officials of the
State Agricultural College. It is
thot that the Willmar Club has
made such a reputation as a live
commercial body that Willmar will
be includud in this circuit of small
experimental farms.
The publicity committee reported
that it is preparing a twenty-tour
page pamphlet setting forth the
advantages of Kandiyohi county to
settlers from the older states The
committee is desirous of secur
ing a number of duly authenticated
instances where the corn crop in
this county has exceeded fifty bush
els to the acre. Anyone having
any information which will aid the
committee in preparing the subject
matter of this pamphlet are urged
to mail the same to the committee
at once. The pamphlet will be
neatly printed and bound and the
first edition will comprise ten thous
and copies. It is then the purpose
of the committee acting with the
land agents of the county to adver
tise the advantages of the county in
a number of periodicals which
reach the farmers of Illinois and
Iowa.
I he following were duly elected
members of the Club at last night's
meeting: Fred W. Powell, P. C.
Williams, Selmer A. Berg and
Erick ElkJQr.
There will be a special meeting
ofthejLadies Aid of First M. E.
church next Wednesday afternoon
Dec. 15 at the home of Mrs. G. W.
Jorris. Every member is earnestly
requested to be present.

Library Notes.
There have been a number of in
quiries of late regarding whether
the local library will have a Swed
ish traveling library. We are in
formed that the library board has
applied to the state commission
for one, and that it will be sent
here just as soon as it is available.
The library now contains a fine
collection of new picture books,
and parents who wish to purchase
anything in this line for their
children will do well to look them
over. Two of the finest books are
an art edition of Hans Christian
Anderson's Fairy Tales, with illus
trations by Hans Tegner, and a
hook of Gnomes by Fred. E.
Weatherly, illustrated by Stuart
Hardy.

Hawick to Have Creamery.
Oscar Thorson of Hawick made
a pleasant call at the Tribune office
this morning, being enroute for
home from a short visit at Atwater.
Mr. Thorson said that the people on
the Roseville prairie had the best
crop this year that he has ever
known them to have. He also said
that the Hawick skimming station

of cream for a distance of seven
miles was a bad thing, especially in
summer time.

ADVEVI1ST LOOKING
UP CAMP GROUNDS
S. E. Jackson, president of the
Minnesota conference of the Sev
enth Day Adventists, was in the
city Friday looking over the
grounds which have been offered
the adventists for their convention
next June. He was very much
pleased with Homewood p»rk and
Sperryville, altho he thought the
place might prove a little small, as
they intend to put up at least 150
family tents besides the various
headquarters tents and the big as
sembly tent.
The place where the convention
will be held will be chosen at a
meeting of the Elders of the
church to be held some time this
month.

ADD1E HARRIS.
Mrs. Addie Harris, the widow
of Joseph D. Harris, one of the first
settlers of Harrison township, died
at the home of her daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Mamie Harris, in Atwater,
yesterday morning, death following
an attack of pneumonia.
The funeral will be held tomor
row, Thursday, morning, services
begin conducted at the residence at
10:30 and at the Presbyterian
church at 11 o'clock.
Addie Parson Harris was bcrn
Jan. 21, 1835, and she was thus not
quite 75 years at the time of death.
In the spring of 1858 she came to
this county with her husband and
they located on the St. Johns town
site, which had been abandoned by
the original promoters. Mr. Har
ris and Amos Dodge had re-organ
ized the townsite proposition and
renamed it as Harrison, a name
that was later given to the town
ship. On March 4,1858, the Harri
son postoffice was established with
Mr. Harris as postmaster, and he
also opened a small store. Mr.
Harris was also the first town clerk
in the town which bears his name.
He died May 7, 1878, and his
wife then made her home with her
daughter, Mrs. Peter Burns, at
Kandiyohi. She is survived by a
brother, P. H. Parson, of Spicer,
one daughter, the one mentioned
above, and two sons, F. H. Harris
of Spicer, and Irving Harris of
Camden, Wash.
