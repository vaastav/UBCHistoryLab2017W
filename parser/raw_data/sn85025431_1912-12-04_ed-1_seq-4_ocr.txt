AND BROWNSDALE LEAFLET
Entered as second-ptasr mail matter at
the postoffice, Austin Minn.
ON Friday, Gov. Eberhatt appointde
Eunn for associate justice^ of the: sn
preme coart to fill vacanoy, after Bans
had been discarded at the polls in the.
recent election. This gives'three of
the live supreme court judges to the
Twin Cities. It is an outrage on the
rest of the state.
PjREsiDENT-eiect Wilson announces
that he will take the oath of ofiice on
March 4 but will postpone the inaugu
ral ceremonies until the last Thursday
in April. This willcglve better weather
for outdoor ceremonies.
So little interest is taken in President
Taft's message to congress this year
that we do not take space to print it.
His recommendations come too late:
When he had the chance to act in the
interest of the people he used his veto
against them and now is down and out
THE St. Paul Courant comes to our
table this week with Mary D. McFad
den as editor. Here is one of her sage
observations: "The average aunt is
not a female brute, but on occasion she
would be happy if left in charge ot
some of her nieces and nephews long
enough to administer a firm, but gentle
dose of physical application of disci
pline."
DISPATCHES state that Tawney is to
get up a big farewell banquet for joe
Cannon who was recently repudiated
at the pol by his constituents. It will
be a nice bunch of has-beens getting
together for mutual sympathy.
THE next session of the legislature
will convene January 7. A Unijted
StateB senator will be elected January
21. It would be a great relief if at this
session our legislators would make a
new departure and cut down millions
of needless expense and exlravagauce
instead of following the usual course.
THE district court in Minneapolis on
Wednesday gave a verdict of $6,000 to
a woman who was knocked down by
an automobile driver and permanently
injured. Somebody ought in fairness
to pay for such injuries. The woman
certainly did not run the automobile
down.
A dispatch from Washington says
that President Taft has quietly in
formed friends that he is not to be re
garded or publicly referred to in poli
tical speeches by republicans as a pos
sible candidate of the party for presi
dent in 1916. This is the biggest joke
of the season coming from the man
who got 12 electoral votes out of a to-'
tal of 531. No one else would ever have
thought of it.
FEDERAL authorities estimate that
the "rare book" swindle perpetrated on
book lovers throughout the country
has brought a profit of $5,000,000 to the
operators of it. We never could see
why people would throw away their
money so foolishly.
ANY plan for the reorganization of
the republican party, which does not
contemplate as a nucleus the active
sane young men of the party, progres
sive in ideas and thoughtful but decis
ive in action, will not get very far.
AT a meeting of citizens in Norwalk,
Conn., last week the New Haven rail
road monopoly was likened to a "can
cer of imperialism", to a "financial
despot worse than the Czar of Russia",
and to a "thousand-armed octopus".
To those who know personally of this
monopoly these expressions do not
seem extravagant.

Owatonna Journal-Chronicle: Presi

himself with plans to rehabilitate the

just that the man primarily responsible
for the wreckage of the party should
undertake this job, but it is likely that
the less he has to do with it the more
successful will be efforts in that di

St. Cloud JoarnaUPreps: We notice
some objection to the election of Henry
Rines of Mora on the theory that he is
a progressive* republican and has not
been in sympathy with the old-time
political machine. That is a pretty
good reason why he should be elected.
If th# republicans are to unite there
must be recognition of men like Rines,
to show that there is absolutely no
excuse for a third party.
Lake City Graphic: The election of
J. A. A. Burnquist as lieutenant gov

his friends are already making rosy

MOLASSES AS A STOCK FEED
W. C. Stader, Vinegrove, Kentucky,
writes: "What do you know about the
value of black strip or low. grade mo
lasses as a feed, and how much should
he fed?"
The Experiment Station Bulletin
No. 118, of the Massachusetts Experi
ment Station, Amherst, Mass., gives
a very complete digest of the subject
of molasses as a feed. The conclusions
do not seem to be very satisfactory
regarding its value: Where it can be
obtained cheaply, and where the grains
are high priced, it probably has a place
in the feeds. It is. sometimes fed by
diluting it with water so that stock
will drink it, but generally it is used
to give cheaper feeds more palatabil
ity that is, it can be mixed with chop
ped straw or other coarse hay and
stock will eat this to get the molasses.
It is also, ed to quite an extent with
alfalfa meal.
Its principal feeding constituent ,is
the- sugar or carbo-hydrates, and the
conclusion of the Bulletin seems to be
that these can be" bought more cheaply
in such feeds as corn than in the
molasses. However, it would be well
for you to find out what it would cost
you in your locality before deciding as
to feeding or not feeding it. At the
present prices of other feeds, we are
inclined to believe you Will find that
an investment i^molasses for a feed
will not be a profctable one.

LAYING TILE IN QUICKSAND
Reply to M. E. Barton, Mishawaka,
Indiana: "Will you please give, me a
little information on laying tile on a
farm that has a quicksand bottom,
also a little advice on killing out
smartweed?"
This is lite a difficult proposition,
and we believe the only way that re
sults can be obtained is to use some
durable, timber and lay a board in tM
bottom of the ditch on which the tile
can be laid to keep it from getting out
of line. You would need a board
about the same width as the tile that
is, for 4-inch tile a 1x4 board would
be sufficient. At the points where
the boards join, a short piece 12 or 14
inches long should be placed below so
that there would not be a possibility
of the tile becoming disjointed by one
end of the board settling.
If you get a considerable fall,
the sand will probably not bother in
filling up. ae tile but if you cannot
get a fall of three or four inches per
100 feet, it would be best, if possible,
to- fill in about the, tile with clay or
some other soil through which the
water would seep and at the same
time keep out the sand.
As to smartweed, we believe if you
'get your land properly drained you
will not be bothered with this pest,
as it only grows in soil that contains
too much w-ter for the proper growth
ordinary crops. If draining does
not do it, ve are sure that you/ can
get rid of it by cultivation.: A few
ei pps of corn will Jielp rid your land

GUMBO SOILS
O. J. Berger, of AEudora, Kansas,
writes:
MI
am on gumbo land, and it
is not very well drained. I ami told
this land would improve if properly
irained, and some say it can't be tiled,,
for a paste forins around the tile-and
the water can't get through it. How
would concrete tile do? Can you give
me any information on this subject
What we usually refer "to as gumbo
soil is a very heavy type of soil. In
3ome
localities is is
very,
not
dark in color,
while in other places it is slightly
grayish in color. In the state of Iowa
the gumbo 3oils are very dark and
usually very heayy, while in parts of
Kansas, also other parts of Iowa, the
gumbo is ot a light color, often of a
reddish cast.
One of the first steps to take in
attempting to handle gumbo Jacd is to
see that it is well drained. The very
close grained, finely textured gumbo
soils of Iowa have' been drained sue-
Proper Treatment for Gumbo Soil
cessfully both by using open ditches
and by using tile drain. In fact, some
of the gumbo soils that- have been
tile drained often Ssell as high as
$200
per acre. The experience in handling
the heavy, sticky soils indicates that
it is
necessary to place the tile, as
one would naturally think, close to
gether and as shallow as first consid
eration might indicate. The experi
ence of farmers in the heavy, waxy
soils of Iowa shows that the tile, lines
are often placed ten to twelve rods
apart, which is ample distance even
in some other types of soil. The best
way to settle this matter, inasmuch
these soils vary considerably, is to put
in as many lines of tile as you can con
veniently and watch the effect, or use
only one tile line and note the dis
tance it drains on either side. This
would take but a short time for the
effect can usually be noticed on close
observation.
It is highly important that you have
a .good outlet in attempting to use tile.
After the land is well drained, the
next important step is that of tillage.
It has been found that for all kinds of
conditions fall plowing is the best for
gumbo
soil? The action of freezing
and thawing during the wintd* months
renders, the seed bed much more friable

One of the objectionable features of
gumbo soil-is,the_tendency to shrink
when drying: out, thus injuring the
crop materially. The time that this
occurs is usually during the summer
months.. This "objection may be over
come by surface tillage, using the
spring-tooth, peg-tooth or disk har
rows, together with cultivators, or any
other- means of maintaining a surface
mulch to' la depth of three or four
inches.
Gumbo soils when .well drained and
in a good state of cultivation,. which
may be maintained as stated above,
give splendid yields in fact,' better
than some-other.kinds of soils in the
corn belt. A frequent application of
stable manure is also beneficial
4
these soils, inasmuch as it supplie
vegetable natter, thus rendering the
soil lighter arid putting it in a better
physical condition.
Some claim that the cement tile are
more porous and thus permit a freer
movement of the water than the clay
tile, but in reality there is very little
difference. As far as. the pores of the
tile becoming filled is concerned, one
would probably fill up about as quickly
as the other.. A large percentage
of the water that enters the tile
goes through the joints and does not
soak" directly through the tile. You
will find that well vitrified tile or
carefully made cement tMe will serve
your purpose satisfactorily. In cases
where the trouble frpin alkali is ex
ceptionally severe, it may be best to
use the clay tile in preference to the
eemert.
