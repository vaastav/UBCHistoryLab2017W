THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Taft in his message to congress did not disappoint those
who are in sympathy with the Rooseveltian policies. He believes in sys
tematizing the public business and in coordinating the work of the
various departments of government. He believes in economy in ex
penditure and in the use of common sense in making appropriations.
He believes that the question of public health is a fit subject for the
government to consider and he evinces an interest in the social welfare
by recommending that proper measures be taken to stamp out the
"white slave" traffic.
Perhaps tip' most significant thing in respect to the message is what
the president suggested but which he did not discuss. He felt that
the question oi amendments to the Sherman anti-trust and the inter
state commerce acts were of such importance as to call for a special
message and likewise the question of the conservation of the nation's
resources was left to future recommendations. But the president inti
mated that when his recommendation does come it will deal with scien
tific classification of timber and mineral lands and of water power sites.
In fact the president indicated in his message throughout that he is
disposed to utilize the results of scientific inquiry to the fullest extent.
The message is very satisfactory.

WOULD PROTECT
FORESTS
Spokane. Wash.. Dec. 7. —Active
support and cooperation by the peo
ple, legislators and lumbermen of
Idaho, Oregon, Montana, California
and Washington in practical methods
|of securing better management and
protection of standing forests and the
reforestation of cut-over lands is the
object of a campaign outlined at the
semi-annual meeting of the Western
Forestry and Conservation assoeia
j tion in the offices of A. L. Flewell
ing, president, In Spokane. George
M. Cornwall, of Portland, was sec
retary. Arrangements were made to
finance and conduct the movement
so as to obtain actual results to serve
as object lessons. E. T. Allen, of
Portland, formerly district forester
in charge of all government forest
work in Oregon. Washington and
Alaska, has been engaged as forester.
; The meetings will take place in Spo
kane.
Mr. Allen has resigned from the
government forest service to give his
entire time to the new management,
although in recognition of its useful
public character the government al
i lows him to retain the official title!
of collaborator. Among the chief ob-!
I jects sought by the organization, j
formed under the name of the Pa-i
■ cific Northwest Forest Protection and
Conservation association, in Spokane
last January, are the formation and
perfection of fire fighting associations
throughout the western states, in
which state, government and timber;
owners shall join in hiring patrol and
labor; the selection of representative!
areas for conservative logging and re-j
! forestation experiments, and the col-,
lection and dissemination of trust
worthy information upon forestry and;
forest legislation. In reality, to make
it a clearing house for all forest fire
and conservation associations of the'
five states, also to cooperate closely
with the United States forest service.
Other objects set forth by the
speakers at the meeting are as fof
lows: "The successful preservation
of the forest from fire, the framing!
of laws for cutting timber and dis-j
posing of refuse in a reasonable, j
practical way, the reforestation of j
such cut over lands as are not de
sirable for farm lands, and to provide
; for special taxation therefor; the
preservation of mountain streams for
irrigation and all of the other things
contemplated by the word 'conser
vation,' and also r o raise the money
to carry out the necessary experi
ments so as to reduce the theory to
a sound business basis, for without j
all these elements the association!
cannot hope to succeed "
Particular stress will be laid upon
the necessity of more adequate pro
tection of forest resources from fire,
i The forest fin' associations of Wash
ington and Idaho spent more than
$100,000 during the season of 1909
and it is expected to bring the tim
ber-owners of other states into line.
The association also expects more
public and legislative cooperation
when it is more generally realized
that on every thousand feet of Mm-,
ber burned the stum page owner loses
only a dollar or two, while the com
munity loses fully which would
have been paid in wages for Its man
ufacture, while of the millions of dol
lars brought into the five states year
ly by the '.umber industry, fully 80
per cent is circulated in the arteries,
ol labor, commerce and agriculture.
This argument is advanced in the in
terest of the protection of standing
timber from useless destruction, also;
for the perpetuation of such a tre
mendous source of wealth by encour
aging a second crop.
The executive officers of the asso
ciation are: President, A. L. Flew- j
riling, Spokane; secretary, Frank H.
Lamb, Hoquiam, Wash.; treasurer.:
T. J. Humbird, Sandpoint, Idaho; vice
I presidents, D. P. Simons. Jr.. Seattle,

LIQUOR ISSUE IN
ELECTIONS
! Boston, Nov. 7. —Keen interest has
■j been aroused in the city elections in
' I Massachusetts today by the active
1 campaign of the prohibition forces
> of the state to make as many cities
I "dry" as possible. Fourteen of the
( leading cities of the state vote on the
■ liquor question today, and a week
i hence nearly all of the remaining j
i cities of the state will vote on the!
I
■ question.
In anticipation of the city elections;
a spirited contest has been waged all;
over Massachusetts between thej
' forces of prohibition and those who j
believe in the regulated saloon. The'
! struggle between the opposing forces!
is. on the one hand, to increase the,
number of "dry places," on the other,'
to reduce it. This, however, is, in
a measure, only incidental to the
main purpose, so far as the temper
ance workers are concerned, for they
desire, in addition to drawing the
prohibition line closer about the sa
loons, to swell the total vote of the
state in favor of prohibition. This is]
In their favor already by a majority!
,of nearly 20.0n0, and a large no
il icense vote at the present elections
will add to this considerably. This:
is desired by the prohibitionists fori
the moral effect it may have on the ;
state legislature when the constitu
tional amendment, providing for the'
re-submission of the question of pro-;
hibition to the voters, gets on the
legislative calendar next winter.
i j
Not all the work has been done by
j the prohibitionists, however, since
' the advocates of license in many of
I the no-license cities have been mak-j
j ing unusual efforts to swing the pen
dulum the other way in the present
(Sections. This is particularly true'
in New Bedford, Fall River, Wor
; cester and Lynn, and to a degree in
all the other cities which went dry a
; year ago. In Worcester the fight has
been waged for months, while in Fall
! River and New Bedford it began al-;
j most as soon as the votes were count
!ed last December. Both of the latter
; swung into the no-license column at
i that time, while Worcester is now
! completing its second year of prohi-
I bition, as is also Lynn.

Election in Ix>s Angeles.
Los Angeles, Dec. 7. —An election
of municipal officers is in progress
in this city today, the first in which
the candidates were nominated by
J the norr-partisan direct primary sys-'
|ttm. Mayor George Alexander is a!
• candidate for re-election on a "Good
j Government" platform. He is opposed ,
!by George Smith, the candidate of
j the so-called "machine." In addition ,
to a mayor, there is to be elected a
' city treasurer, auditor, assessor and
members of the city council and
board of education.
