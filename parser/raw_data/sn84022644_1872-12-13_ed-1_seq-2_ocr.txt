dom questioned his integrity never
impeached.
Although a Democrat of tbe straitestf
sect, and many times literally pressed
d lH'"to I10'110"" f trust and honor by
ins leiiow-ciiizcns, Jir. vranor was
never a politician. Although com
bining in his nature mnny of the rarest!!
elcmeuts of statesmanship he yetfl
shrunk from employing tho means
usually resorted to by modern politi
cians for the furtherance of their am
bitious longings, preferring rather to
leave the political arena open to other
contestants and devote his talents to
purer and nobler pursuits.
As a citizen Mr. Cranor was nni
versally esteemed. This is no idle
language, emenating from a desire to
eulogize the distinguished dead at the
expense of a perhaps too often re'
pace to refer to other and equally
weighty reasons that may have actual

the seizure by tbe military and im
prisonmcnt of about ten thousand citi
zens of tbe loyal States for no offen

liberation without being informed ol
ffihe cause of their arrest and deten
