been, for a full year, open' to all, except
such os wore not in a condition to malyi'

A letter from the Surveyor Gener
al of Washington territory, which lias
been received by the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, conveys
the information that valuable gold I
mines have been discovered in that
territory, on Chebates river, at Grey
Harbor, and also on a stream empty
ing into Discovery Bay, about fifteen
miles in the rear of Port Townsend.
A company is making arrangements
to work tho first named mines. They
seem to be placer or surface mines.
These gold discoveries will undoubt
edly furnish tho stimulant to emigra
tion to Washington territory, which
has hitherto been wanting. The la
test estimates of the population cf the
territory do not exceed fifteen thous
and, but this slow progress maybe-at
tributed to the superior attractions of
the rich mining districts elsewhere.
The mild climitcof Washington will I
be very apt to draw flocks of miners
from the gold mines of Fraser river, I
as well as many emigrants from Van-1
couver's Island. ThS" information j
comes in an official Bhapc, and is there
fore reliable. California 'generally
sends a detachment of her miners to j
any new mines which may be discov
ered in the far west, and in this res
pect she seems to be an inexhaustible
fountain of emigration, while at the
same time her own population does
not diminish. Without the aid of a
gold-hunting movement, Washington
territory would require many years ,
to become sufficiently settled to enti
tle her to admission into the I nion
as a State : but gold mines operate
like magic in the colonization of wild
regions, however remote. There can
be of course no emigration to Wash
ington from the Atlantic Stftes di
rect, but from the sources we have
already indicated there will be a con
siderable movement of population
next Spring.— l'hila. North Ameri

A notlern tpoKtle,
We clip the following from the
English correspondence of the
Watchman and Sicjlcctor.
A young fellow of the name of
Lyne, who swems to be about three
fourths fanatic and one fourth fool,
took it into his head that if he called
himself Father Ignatius, dispensed
with shoes and sto' kings, dressed him
self in a long woolen night-gown, dy
ed black, shaved his crown, and foun
ded what he calls a Benedictine Mon
astery, he would .check the tide of
pauperism nnd infidelity which come
like a flood upon the populous cities
of England. Mr. Lyne has succeed
ed in creating much laughter, and
has gained a celebrity by bis fantas
tic exhibitions, which he never at
tained on the quiet pathway of com
mon sen-e. The jest reached a cli
max the other day, when, :it a con
gress of the clergy at Bristol; Fath
er Ignatius suddenly appeared, bare
footed, shaven crowned, endued in
serge night gown, and insisted on ad
dressing his reverend brethren. At
first they howled and'hooted at him,
but at length the English instinct of
fair play prevailed, and they listened
to him while he demonstrated the ad
mirable fitness of bare feet and serge
night-gowns for converting tho mill
ions of England.
frtf' Many a true word is spoken
in jest. Our idle squib, a month or
two since, to tho effect that Sherman's
future march could bo safely prognos
ticated from the flight of the unhappy.
Menu/his-Jfernantlo—Grev tula—Jaclc
son-Morton- Atlanta— Grijfin . 1 ppeal,
turns out to be more accurate than
some wiser predictions. Griffin was
the last Ararat where it hoped to rest
its weary feet. Griffin in effect
has been captured by our forces and
the peripatetic Appeal has winged its
way still further to the sunny South.
It is surely the fate of this paper to
be always " on the rampage," and its
printing-cases ought to be established
in wheelbarrows. We do not yet
| learn where next the Appi d will
paustr: and perhaps if we did, it would
lie contraband news, so sure an indi
cation would it furnish of Sherman's
line of march. We wish it bon voy
age , —till wc meet again.
EST The lliehmond papers are
jol'y over " reduced prices" of provi
sions. 'l'lic Whig goes into ecstacies
of delight over the prospect of a good
dinner at cheap rates. " Corn meal

On the tir.-t page of our paper to-day,
will be ftmnd. the Presidents message.—
No former mr sago in the last twenty
ye;,is has bo.n looked for with such in
terne interestss has this one. Immedi
ately after the election, Gea. Butler inti
! mated his eonv'.ii"ns as to what might be
I proper to do at this pel licular time.—
| Others, still more anxiops lor a peace of
! whatever kind, wit further, even than
: Butler, and some would have us believe
that immediate o -s of pe.ico would be
! made by Mr. Lin In.to the, Richmond
cable—that a mongrel e< mmis-ion, 11c
i publicans and iV.; "a would soon be
j on their way to the Rebel capital, to ne
gotiate for peace. These intimations were
ice ived by some as the dawning of a
better state c.f things, while others—those
who have okkl by the administration,
j feared that, if there was any truth in
j ilicse statements, they only indicated a
i receding on the part i I Mr. Lincoln;
| a going' back to that com premise policy
j which had proved so Jail to hii. l admin
! istration in the earlier days of its cxis
! , , .
tanee —hence, tho greatest anxiety was
felt for a i to.-h avow. 1 of the President r
views. That anxiety is now over, and
those who believe (hat the j resent policy
of the Government. that, which, while
it best protects the ho(kor of the nation,
is at ihe same time the shortest road to
peace and rc-iini' n. have tho fatisfaction
of knowing that it will not be disturbed.
It i. with, great satisfaction therefore, that
we congratulate the readers of the CITI
ZEN, that Mr. Lincoln has taken no step
backwards—the message is at once con
eke and comprehensive, and is withal,
just such a document as we had a right
toes peel from our "second Washington."
TSar- Loit ry Ca«e>
Seldom h. < tbere been as much feeling
and interest manifested in tho termination
of a difficulty as has been in this. Col.
Lowry has 112 r quite a number of years
past, (with the exception ef a short pe
riod when hew out of business) kept
a hotel in our borough. His house was
formerly the acknowledged headquarters
of the Republican party, and himself an
avowed Republican. In the summer of
1861. ho accepted a position on the
"Unicn" ticket, as it was called, which
was made on tho 4th of July of ihat
year, and alter the regular Republican
ticket bad been put in nomination. We
recollect very well remonstrating with
the Colonel in reference to the propriety
of his acceptance of the position—assur
ing him that it would certainly change
the character of his house politically—
that he would be defeated iiT the canvass,
aud that it would in all probability result
in driving him into the Democratic party.
His reply was that he had given a friend
of bis (whom he named) a pledge that
he would not withdraw—that he Ourtjon
could not, but at the same time assure*!
us that it could never unsettle his, then,
political opinions and sympathies. We
were then among the Colonel's warmest
friends, although utterly opposed to his
political position. No one Can doubt,
however, that the Colonel had a perfect
right to do what he did politically, and
we were not much surprised to find, that
through the course of time, hcbeeanic an
ardent Democrat, supporting Woodward
in 1803 for Governor in preference to
'•the soldier's friend" Governor Curtin.
aud Gm. McCfellan last fall against Lin
coln.
It was not strange that, as the Colonel
changed his polities, the political complex
ion of his patrons changed—as his po
sition became known. Democrats gathered j
around him—his house was soon recog
nized as the headquarters of tho opposi
tion—not only Democrats, but inveterate
Copperheads were found in abundance in
the bar, in the office, and occupying the
benches in front of the houwi during last
fall to the annoyance of Republicans who
called on business or otherwise. Besides
being a Hotel, the "Lowry House" is
both a stage, and a Telegraph office. The
business community thought they had a
right to free " ingress afd egress" in the
premises, without reference to whether
they were patrons of the house or not.
It is perhaps proper to remark that as
Democrats concentrated their patronage
on the house. Republicans gradually with
drew ; this seemed to offend the Colonel
very much—lie should have reflected that
"it is a poor rule that don,t work both
ways," but he did not. Those who, hav
ing dec lined patronizing his house, when
they called on business connected with
the .Stage or Telegraph office, often be
| lieved themselves treated with undue cold
? ness. In addition to this, we believe it
! is generally admitted that the Colonel
' was frequently, to speak moderately, con-
I sider.il.lv excited. I'nder these circum
! stances it is not strange that some incon
l venience was felt by many Republicans.
; fjoine,feeling more aggrieved than others.
1 declared that they would not go near a
house where they felt apprehensive that
their presence might be the mentis of ex-
I citing the Colonel and possibly result in
personal difficulty. We have beard some
lof our be. t c itizens say tlfat they would
never cross his door—that they would
, never even patronize the stage as a means
' of travel while it stopped at his house,-
simply because it was unpleasant to come
in contact with him. While boarding at
Mr. Jack's and Mr. Magee'a respectively,
we have heard travelers complain that
they were treated coldly by the Col. when
they called on. him to pay their fair, pre
liminary to taking passage in the stage.
We have heard those Landlords too,
| both complain of their guests being thu*
1 treated by the Col.
We have good reason to believe these
complain;.* were well grounded. This
'• being the stats of the case, as was to be
expected, the coldness thus exhibited
giadually incrca.cd. The canvass for
President opened warmly and for the first
time in the Colonel's lii'e, wo believe, he
I became a parti;: n. On several occasions
I ho became excited, and on such occasions
j he would never i'ail to express his anatli
• emies on Abolitionists, generally using
uaiues —and on ome occasions, making
beligerent demonstration.''. The McClel
j lan chivalry rallied around him, until be-
I fore the close cf the campaign his loud
! hnzzah—lik« the voiceof Roderick's horn,
j would peoplo the town wiih a warlike
| elan. This was the state of the case,
when on election day he posted himself
I in front of the election window, as his
| own friends said, for the purpose of stir
-1 ring up a row. All efforts at that time
i ''ailed however, and lie retired, doubtless,
| tho impression that he could not
;e: .a pinrrel out of any body. In a for
mer art.de we noted the proceedings of
j that night, an also, a summary of the in
! cidents of the next day, including the
oeh hraled raid on the Magee house. Our
readers will recollect that our neighbor of
| the IL mid and we ctiffered as to wheth
j er a poker had been used upon the Colo
nel by Mr. Magee—wo called on that pa
per to take back its false charge, but we
were oiily answered by hard names'. For
! the purpose, therefore, of setting this
! matter at rest: wo determined to give our
: readers the testimony in tho case, should
] it ever be tried ; but by its settlement,
! wo have been deprived of this means of
j vindicating our statement of the affair.
In this respect however, we are neith
[ or surprised nor disappointed. We scaree
i iy ever saw such a continuous effort made
by the friends of any man, as was made
1 by the Colonel's friends to keep this diffi
culty out of court; it was not to be ex
-I'ei'te i that they would not succeed. The
Colonel too, for once, overcome his natu
rally haughty air. and began to make con
i'e-sl us and applogies; extending his hand
to gctitleiiion, with whom, up till now, he
would ri"t have deigned to speak—ac
companying it too with ample apologies—
how could they refuse its acceptance'?—
Indeed, we intimated to Mr. Magcc, our
self, that it seemed to require more cold
independence than any man ought to have,
to with -rand such advances. The mat
ter was therefore, finally settled. The
follow ing is a copy of the paper filed with
, the Clerk of the Quarter Sessions, con
taining the terms of settlement, and sign
ed by the parties. From it our readers
can judge whether we were in error in our
statement of the affair:
Commonwealth vs Alex. Lowry—As
sault aud Battery.
Commonwealth vs Alex. Lowry—Suie
ly of the I'caee.
j Commonwealth vs J. C. Sharp, et. al.
—Surety of the Peace.
The parties *in the above cases have
1 agreed upon terms; gf settlement, as fol
-1 lows:
•• That the said Alex. Lowry is t<s pay !
j all costs in the above cases, aud the couu- !
sel fees of the Commonwealth's private :
| counsel; and whereas, the liidler Herald
published an article stating that F. S.
Magee, the prosecutor, had struck the
j said Lowry, with a poker, Ac., relating to
this difficulty, and it is hereby agreed
that the above statement in the Butler
Herald was untrue, and founded in mis
take or misapprehension—that the said
Lowry went into the house of Magsc, at
the time this difficulty occurred, and
was treated with respect and courtesy,
until he made the assault upon him.
F. S. MAOKE,
A. LOWRY.
While there is ample provision in the
above for the"cost, including the counsel
fees of Mr. Magee's attorney's, there
seems to beno guarantee for the observance
of the peace. It is true that most of
those who bad been objects of the Colo
nel's vengeance have become, at least,
nominally, reconciled to him, and need
therefore, apprehend no further trouble.
We, however, are still in the cold—and of
course write it our peril.
But if we ate not fortunate enough to
be Mill. raced in the Col's Amnesty Proc
lamation, we have the proud satisfaction
of knowing that we are still free —un-
traiumcledhy tuiy compromise policy which
might prove a barrier to the proper inde
pendence oT our columns. And while
treating this difficulty* thus at length, we
don't wish to be suspected of a factious
or meddlesome interference in this matter;
we claim to have an interest in it as well
as others. We will not stop to give
special reasons at present, believing that
our relations to a largo and respectable
portion of the citizens ot the county as a
journalist, is a sufficient one. Wo are
aware of the great personal inconveni
ence wo are required to undergo, in con-'
sequence of thus freely criticising this
matter; but while we conceive it to be
our duty, we will uot hesitate on that ac
count.
Unless we should be compelled by some
unforeseen contingency, we now take our
leave of the political canvas) of lxtil,
with all its incidents. And while" we
! have nothing to retract, it is nosatisfac
| tion to us to know that we have ever writ
ten a single line that proved offensive to
! any. Almost four years will have passed
: away before we shall be called upon to
| enter upon another. Our faith is strong,
, i hat long ere then, we will under the gui
j dance of Divine Providence, be allowed
! to enjoy peace throughout our entire bor
! der, based upon the hoiuagenious prinei
: pie of impartial freedom, frnni the lakes
to the gulf, and from ocean toocoan. Kn
j dcavoring to forgot the past, so tar at least
|as anything unpleasant is concerned, wo
! shall address ourselves to the duty of the
1 hour—the m.-t linanco of the government
in the patri .tic eischarge of its

P-jt" The following letter has been kind
ly handed us for publication—it shows
how the army feels :
FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE, VA.,
Dec. 1, 18<)4.
KIND FRIBND:—I have just been
thinking 1 would like to hear from old
Butler. I will therefore, scribble you a
few lines, and inform you that I am in
excellent health, and have been ever since
I entered the service, although we have
seen some hard service. We are now sta
tioned at Fairfax Court House, and are
putting up Block houses; our company
has taken possession of tho court-house,
and will put a stockade around it.
Our regiment forms the outer line of
fortifications of Washington city—the
first battallion is near the Chain Bridge,
the second is at Yiena, and the 3d (ours)
i.s here. I understand it is to be a per
manent line of (Jefense, if so, we may
stay here. The boys are all in good spir
its, and proud of being so nobly support
ed in the last election, by the patriots at
home. This has been a long and bloody
war, much longer and much more bloody
than any of us dreamed of three years
.ago, but "the end draweth nigh." If a
spirit of reckless desperation nhuuld nerve
the traitorous leaders of those Rebel bands
to a super-human effort, still tho end mvxt
be near. They have made their last levy
of men fit for military service months
ago; and are now garrisoning their Forts
with hoys of 15 and 10 summers, and old
men of £>o and 60 years of age, " lobbing
alike the cradle and the grave."
On the other hand, there has swept
from the mountains of Now England, the
hills and valleys of the Middle States,
aud the plains of tbc North and West, an
avalanch of citizen soldiers, who know
no such word as fail, to fill iip the decim
inated ranks of our veteran armies in the
field. The beacon light of foreign inter
vention, which bound up .n tho distance
with such flattering pnuiiise of aid to
treason, has sunk from their vision with
out bringing to these base traitors, the
realization of that hope which so loti"
sustained them. Added to this, the tri
umphs which must certainly await the
National cause in the re-election of Presi
dent and it cannot bo in all hu
man calculation iiiat the rebels will ever
seriously attempt another four years war.
I think it is morally certain that the re
election of Mr. Lincoln will sound the
death-knell of Rebellion. Evidently from
their own journals, tho only hope they
had, was in a change of the Administra
tion, which would re-organize their bogus
concern. In short, Ido not believe
ti e justice and goodness of God will ever
permit a Rebellion, whose corner stone is
Slavery, arid whose highest ambition is
despotism, to culminate in a success that
would again rivit the manacles of hope
less Slavery on millions of our fellow men.
The Idea is too monstrous to be entertain- j
Ed for a single moment. 1 tlirmk God i
am a soldier in so glorious a cause.

J|ka>'" Below we give a letter from an old
and much esteemed friend, who, some
twelve or more years ago, bade adieu to
old liutler. for a prospective home in the

have been realized in his subsequent his

that it was not for publication, we think
does not preclude us from publishing it,
as we know it will bi\ gratifying to his
old friends to thus hear from him—
the news which it brings from the truly

Now,you will pardon the "Ilawkeyes" for

Union, both in the field and at the polls, .
and she votes as she fights—fur the I'uion j
and against traitors, whether North or |
South, her majority fir the Union is j
about 40,000. Could we have had n tew j
more Maboncy's and Jones', we would
have east au almost unanimous vote for i

and cannot bo put off with no 2;"i,000.
1 am glad to say that 1 receive the
" CITIZKN" regularly, and only regret, that
you could not s »d a larger majority from
the old " Keystone." Still you liavo no
cause to be discouraged—keep up the
i light—day is dawning, and all will be

j for this State, I was through the prinei
i pal parts of il, "stumping," and never
! before, has public opinion been so com

Mr. WIMJAM STOOPS: —You may
think 1 have forgotten to write yon, but
no; 1 hope you will pardon my negli
gence when you fully understand my cir
cumstances; will you not? You have
heard of our activity in the Valley, since
September l!)th, and knowing you under
stand a soldier's duties, I feel confident
you will not think 1110 negligent in not
answering your last letter. We are at
present between Winchester and Middle
town, near Newtown. Came here day be
fore yesterday, T think for the purpose of
drawing Marly down the Valley after us.
I lis cavalry has reached our picket l : ,no.
What his intentions arc, and whether he
will attack us again, is not for me to say.
I suppose he has got another requisition
of Artillery from Richmond. \
Well, to-day as I was writing, we re
ceived orders to pack up immediately.
Packed up, but- remained iu camp, and
put up tents again. Saturday evening,
all quiet, cold and windy. Early is mov
ing as though he was gying to attack us
soon. Hope he may allow us a quiet
Sabbath to-morrow. We hope to get a
mail to-niorrow when the train comes from
Martiusburg, and L want to have this letter
to send out iu the mail. I suppose you
will have received the returns of our late
election ero this reaches you. lly it you
can seethe sentiments of Co. "ll,"and
had it not been for recent battles, many
more of our lirar. < would doubtless have
giv.cn their voices lor Lih< rty and I 'nion ;
but we trust they are content in their cir
cumstances, notwithstanding many of
them are suffering excruciating pain from
wounds received iu battle.

Elcrlornl College.
The Electoral College of this State \
mot in the Senate Chamber, at Horris-
I burg, on Wednesday, the 7th inst. The j
i lion. Morton Mc.Michacl was called up
| onto preside, and made a short address
; relating to the circumstances under which
| they, the electors, were assembled, lie I
concluded as follows:
At this very hour, gentlemen, in ail the j
' parts oi this immense republic, except in
< those which are excluded by the tolly and
| wickedness of their own inhabitants—at
i this very hour, by the shores of the far
| off Pacific ; on the western slopes of the
: Itoeky Mountains, beside the waters of
tlio magnificant Mississippi, and the
scarcely less magnificant Missouri; along!
the margins of our illimitable lakes; in
tlio very heart of our boundless prarics, i
and tho clearings of our late unbroken
forests, and near the sounding Atlantic !
wlioro its never-ceasing surges sweep
from Chesapeako to Passuuiuquoddy—at j
this very hour are assembled, as we are
hero assembled, representatives of the
men whose enterprise, and energy and dil- j
gence, have built up and developed this !
superb empire, with its cities rivalling iu
numbers and wealth ami ail the applian- ;
ces of art and luxury the most famous cap- :
| italiste oi Europe ; its mountains teeming I
with all the precious metals and all use
ful- minerals; its valleys swelling with
varied and exhanstless richness —assem-
bled to register the irreversible decree of
this stupendous constituency. And, gen
tlemen, as, not without effort, we grasp
the conceptii n of this huge uation,
stretching from sea to sea,spreading over
an entire continent, engaged in manifold
industries and pursuits n|*il employments,
and rcHcct that the decree which we,
and those who have been similarly dele
gated as soon to register, hits not alone
saved its lite, but iu saving it has saved
also to the oppressed of all lands tho op
portunity of sharing in the liberties we'
enjoy; to the poor of all lands the oppor
tunity of sharing in the bountiful domain
we jx's -cs; to the aspiring of all land*
the opportunity of sharing in the glories
we shall acquire; wlieu we reflect on all
these things, have we not cause to be
proud and thankful that to us has been
allowed the privilege of recording our
names among the names of those chosen
to give form and shape to the nobbst pur
p. Os that ever inspired the breasts and
the grandest utterance that ever broke
from the lips of this or any people.

Nt:\v YORK, December 10.—The Tri-
Washington special says : A few
days ago (Jen. Stevenson, commanding
at Harper's Ferry, sent out a scouting
party of thirty men, in the direction ot
\\ atcrford, Loudon County, to watch
Mosoby, who was reported by citizens to
be preparing for a raid into Maryland.
' At Waterford our cavalry struck the head
of Moseby's ftrce , and a skirmish imme
diately ensued in which we lost seven
killed, wounded and captured. Among
their killed was Captain Mountjny, one bf'
Moseby's ablest Lieutenants. At Lees
burg, on their return, the party gobbled
a number of the rebel Gen. Gordon's
staff, who were visiting a lady.
W The report.> from Sherman indi
cate that an abundance of provisions has
' «irand on the route. The rebels re
port an immense destruction of stock
grain. o.c. How utterly inexcusable, then
ii- tie barbarity which condemned our
prist'iieis at Ander- mville ami elsewhere
to slow starvation, and how inhuman the.
declaration of the Savannah Republican,
••that it was their own (the Federal) Gov
ernment that put it out of our power to
take better care ot them, ami continued
the cruelty of keeping them hero after
we had given full notice of their suffer
ing condition." As prisoners, they were
entitled to humane treatment—to a suffi
ciency, at least, of food and clothing.
et the want of tliem is charged upon
the Federal Government, though it was
in the power of the Confederate authori
ties to furnish both.
jfcO" Four hundred paroled prisoners
arrived in Philadelphia, on Monday. Tho
terms of enlistment of many had expir
ed, but they pretty generally expressed \
determination to re-enlist.
