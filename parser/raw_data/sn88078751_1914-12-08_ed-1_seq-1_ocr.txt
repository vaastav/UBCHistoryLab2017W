IN ALLIED
Combats In Poland May Determine
.. Campaign In The East
Millions On Battle Front-Germans Succeed In Solidifying
4 Line Which Stretches From The Frontier Of East
Prussian To Cracow In Galicia-Baitleground Chosen
By Grand Duke Nicholas, Commander Of Czar's
Legions
London, Deo. 7. It would be Impos
sible to underestimate tho anxiety
felt in Petrograd and reflected In
Paris and this city, as regards' the
sew developments In Poland. The
hour Is at hand for the combats which
may well determine the campaign In
the east. Upon the operations of the
next few weeks depend not merely
whether or not Russia Is to seize Si
lesia and go forward to Berlin, but
whether or not the allies in the west
re to maintain the offensive.
Germany has repaired her losses be
tween the Warthe and the Vistula,
has withdrawn battered armies from
the jaws. , of the :Russlan trap.; has
hurried vast numbers from Kast Prus"
la, Poseii, Silesia and even from Bel
gium and France; has solidified, a
battle line which stretches from
Mlava, on the frontier of Bast Prussia
and Poland, to Cracow, and ,1s ob-
Ylously ready and determined to brave
the terrors of winter and the superior
numbers of the Russians in a third
endeavor to seize Warsaw and the
whole Vistula line southward to San
domlerz. From a battle front of 300 miles, in
which there are few gaps that are not
,pl prot cted by nature, the Ger
mans are -r, 'isea ior mo new aiutuit,
which will certainly produce the most
sanguinary and ferocious battles the
world has ever seen. From resources
of men and munitions, seemingly inex
haustible, Germany Is ready for the
most desperate gamble with destiny
any nation ever attempted.
Russia's great outer line of defense
Is winter Itself, the terrible winter of
north Poland. Russia has not less
than 3,000,000 trained soldiers to meet
the onslaught on fields of battle
chosen not by the Germans, but by a
commander-in-chief who has proved
himself a master of strategy, Grand
Duko Nicholas. Russia has the covert
but effective aid of the Polish people.
and lastly, Russia possesses in the
deep, rapid Vistula and the line of
fortresses an inner defense that may
daunt even the Germans.
Some points of advantage that the,
Germans have are her system of rail
ways, that touch the Russian frontier
from Wlrballen to Cracow and which
enable her Tapidly to transfer large
forces from one threatened or weak
point to another; a commander-in-chief,
Marshal Von Hlndenburg, who
ha1 proved himself to be the ablest
probably of modern warriors; a mill-,
tary organization that is well nigh
perfect; tremendous resolution, and,
finally,- the assistance ot a consider
able force of Austrlans- who are
massed between Czenstachoua and
Cracow.
RUSSIANS RETREATING
Germans Occupy City of Lodz, In
Russian Poland.
Amsterdam, Dec. 7. An official
statement Issued at Berlla says: "The
Germans occupied Lodz on the after
noon of Dec. 6. The Russians are re
treating, having suffered severe lossea
"Reports ot & retrograde German
movement on the Yser canal are uw
true. The evacuation of Vermelles.
southeast of Beshune, was aocordlna
to a concerted plan.- Its retention in
the face of the French artillery flro
would have resulted In unnecessary
sacrifices. Wo blew up the remaining
buildings before retiring. Our troops
occupied prepared positions east of
Vermelles, whither the enemy were
unable to follow."
"The French renewed their attacks
west and southwest of Altkircb, but
without success. They suffered se
vere losses."

SALAZAR TO OPERATE
AS A GUERRILLA
Adds Further Complications to
Tangled Mexican Situation.-
El Paso, Tex., Dec. If The Injec
tion of General Jose Yncz Salazar
Into the affairs ot Mexico adds fur
ther complications to the very com
plicated situation. While Salazar has
not pronounced for any particular fac
tion, It is certain that he is for none
of those now In the field. Having
been last Identified with the Huerta
regime, tho Villa and Carranza lead
ers here are certain that he Is In the
pay of the Clentiflcos, men of the old
Dias rcglmo in Mexico, and that his
campaign has been started merely to
add additional chaos to the chaos that
already reigns. If this true, he has
ample money behind blm.
Salazar hates Villa and Is hated
cordially by Villa. He was In tho
field against Carranza In behalf of
Huerta. By their action It Is plain
that the lieutenants of both Carranza
and Villa are at sea as to who Sala
zar will support, but they admit it will
be neither Villa nor C&rranza, and
that as a guerrilla ho will be a formid
able adversary.

0BREG0N SCORES VILLA
Declares American Gold Is Aiding the
Latter's Cause.
Washington, Dec. 7. The charge
that Villa tried first to bribe him by
offering him command of the army,
and then made three attempts to
have him killed, is made in a tele
gram received at the. Constitutionalist
agency here from General Obregon,
who was one ot the chief figures ot
the Carranza revolution and who Is
remaining loyal to Carranza. He also
makes other charges against Villa.
Obregon charges that American gold
has been used to help the "perfidy"
of Villa, Angeles and Maytorena to
nullify the efforts of' honest men to
istabllsh permanent peace, following
the revolution. He adds, "All patriots
must fight against the domination ot
Villa."

Session
Congress Convenes at Noon For
the Short Session.
LIVELY CONTEST ANTICIPATED
New Rivera and Harbors Measure,
Embracing Nearly All Projects
Knocked Out of "Pork Barrel" Last ..
Session, Certain to Provoke a Big
Fight prohibition and National
Defenses to Come Up.
Washington, Dec. 7. The last ses
sion of the Sixty-third congress met
at noon today. Nearly all tho sena
tors and representatives were in their"
seats. Vice President Marshall re
turned from the Chautauqua circuit
and presided over the senate. Speak
er Clark called the house to order.
The session will end at noon March
4. It is the general opinion of leaders,
that the business of the short session
will be confined to passing necessary
legislation, such as the general ap
propriation bills, and that very llttla
other legislation will be seriously con
sidered. There will be Insistence
from certain quarters that other lejf
lslatnon shall be passed.
Senator Cummins of Iowa returned
with a demand that the railway se
curities bill that was sidetracked in
the last session be taken up and',
passed this winter. The securities
bill was No. 3 In the anti-trust pro
gram of the administration. Doubt is
expressed that it will be pressed by
the administration at this time.
The big fight Is expected over the'
rivers and harbors bill. The house
committee on rivers and harbors ls
plannlng a measure that will embrace
nearly all the projects knocked out
of the so called "pork barrel" In the
last session, and there is certain to
be a fight, especially in the senate.
Prohibition of the liquor traffic and.
the supposed unpreparedness of the"
United States for war are two ques
tions certain to come up for discus
sion. The rules committee will vote
on the prohibition amendment on
Dec. 12, and if the committee votes
In the affirmative the subject will be
brought squarely up to the house..
Late this week the rales commlttee
wlll give consideration to the question
of wai unpreparedness as presented
in the resolution offered by Represen
tative Gardner of .Massachusetts.
Conservative measures for which:
there Is. strong support Include tho
general water power and land leasing
bills, hearings on which are to begin
before the senate committee on public
lands during the week. Before the

Wilson, which will be delivered in
joint session tomorrow, for a definite
outline of the president's wishes re
garding legislation.
