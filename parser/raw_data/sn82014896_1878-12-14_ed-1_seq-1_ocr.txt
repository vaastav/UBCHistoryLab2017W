Rise! for the day is passing;
While you lie dreaming on,
Tho others have buckled their armor
And forth to the fight are gone;
A place in the ranks awaits yon.
Each man has some part to play:
Tho past and the future ure nothing
In the face of tho ntern to-day.
Rise from your dreams of tho future,
Of gaining some hard-fought field.
Of storming some airy fortress
Or bidding Rome giunt yield;
Your future has deeds of glory,
Of honor (God grant It may!)
But your arm will never bo stronger
Or tho need so great an to-day.
Rise! If the past detains you,
Hersunshlno and storms forgot;
.No chains so unworthy to hold you
As those of a valu regret:
Sud or bright, sho Is lifeless ever,
Cast her p.mthom arms away.
Nor look back, havo to learn tho lesson
Of a noble strife to-day.
Rise! forthedny Is passing!
The low sound that you scarcely hear
Is the enemy marching to battle
Arise! for the foe Is here.
5tay not to sharpen your weapous,
Or the hour will strike you at last,
When from dreams of a coming battle
You may wake to And it past.

Discrimination in Freights from Los An
geles to Arizona.
Some ot the Los Angeles papers
have said a good deal on this subject.
The following letter was addressed to a
gentleman in Sacramento in connection
with the pending discussion of the
matter in he constitutional conven
tion. It contains information that is
surely of interest to Arizona people.
It sho.vs how easily the public may
ue misieu oy reckless newspaper
charges. Until it is shown, and we
doubt if it can be. that Mr. Stubbs
does not present the facts fully and
clearly, his letter will convince all fair
men that tne railway company is not
guilty of discriminating against Los
Angeles, either to her own detriment
or that of Arizona:
Sax Francisco, November 23, 7S.
Dear Slit: In reply to your in
quiry regarding the alleged discrimi

Everybody is or ought to be interest
ed in our postal system and its various
connections with other nations. Here
are a few very interesting remarks
made by President Hayes in his late
annual message to Congress; the first
being called out because of the failure
of Congress to appropriate money
enough to effectually apply present
laws, and the second in consequence
of the nearly universal extension ofj
postal facilities:
The following questions are present
ed: Should Congress finally appro
priate a sum Ibr ils expense largely in
excess of its revenues, or should such
rates of postage be established as will
make the Depsriment self sustaining?
Should the Postal Service be reduced
by excluding from the mails all mat
ter which does not pay its way?
Should other methods be adopted
which will increase the revenues or
diminish the expenses of the Postal
Service?

Following is an lnleresting extract
ftom a late "Thanksgiving" sermon
by Rev. David Swing of Chicago:
As nations do not rise in a daj so
in a day they cannot be overthrown.
There are some singular records in
history. It seems that a great nation
cannot turn on its axis more than once
in 400 or 500 years. Some of the old
States lie outside the bounds ol history,
but those inside these bounds show
great uniformity in marking the time
of radical changes of dinasty. Egypt
was under shepherd Kings about 500
years. Her golden age when she so
flourished in art spread over 300 years.
