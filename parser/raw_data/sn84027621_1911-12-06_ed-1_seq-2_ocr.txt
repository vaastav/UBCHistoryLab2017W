THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
Mr. Taft has set a good example to
future presidents in the matter of mes
sages. Hl3 messagre to thi3 Congress,
which was read Tuesday, is the short- ;
et since the days of Washington. It
was devoted exclusively to the Sher-1
man anti-trust act and the trust ques- ;
tlon in general.
The president defended the Sherman
act as Interpreted by the supreme
court. Indicated plainly his opposi
tion to the repeal or. amendment of
this statute, but suggested that Con
gress pass a federal incorporation law
and supplemental legislation that
"would describe and denounce meth
ods of competition that are unfair."
To supervise corporations chartered
under federal law. President Taft pro
posed the creation of an executive
bureau, or commission, with powers
akin to those of the Interstate Com
merce Commission. 2
Speaking of the much discussed dis
solution of the tobacco trust, the pres
ident declared that in his opinion "not
in the history of American law has a
decree more effective for such a pur
pose been entered by a court."
The attempt to find a line within
which monopolies and illegal combi
nations might exercise moderate pow
er and be'supported by the courts, Mr.
Taft pointed out, has failed.
"Theorists and others engaged in
, business violating the statute," he
said, "had hoped that some such line
would be drawn by the courts; but no
court of authority has ever attempted
it. It is not the purpose of the sta
tute to confiscate the property and
capital of the offending trusts."
Other messages on varIou;3 subjects,
the president said, would be sent to
Congress from time to time before the
usual holiday recess.
The grand jury of Osceola county
refused to Indict Egbert Gillette and
Elizabeth Sears, the two old Shakers
who chloroformed Sadie Marchant
some months ago. At the request of
Mrt John C. Jones, state attorney for
the . seventh circuit, Gillette was put
under bond of $7500 to appear before
the next term of court. Mr. Jones de
sired to prosecute the two old Shak
ers and obtain a verdict against them.
In order to discourage other people
who might desire to help their hope
lessly sick relatives or friends out of
life. But Mr Jones said that in case
of the conviction of the two old Shak
ers, he would endeavor to Induce the
governor to pardon them, so the Star .
cannot see that his plan would result j
In anything more practical than an
unnecessary expense to the state. It
Is not likely that a Jury would, con
vict them, so the grand Jury proba-,
bly did the most sensible thing to .be
done. Gillette had no trouble In giv
ing bail and was released. The ques
tion of helping the hopelessly sick out
of their misery is one that is more
and more obtruding itself on the pub
lic notice. It may be a cruel kindness
to keep people alive after hope of re
covery haa ceased and existence only
means suffering, but the finer ele
ments of human nature recoil in horror
from the Idea of hasteneing anyone's
- death. '
The opening hcurs of Congress were
enlivened by a fiery speech from Rep
resentative Martin W. Littleton of
New York. Mr. Littleton ws.s a demo
cratic member of the congressional
committee which was appointed toy
Speaker Clark to investigate the steel
trust. Much evidence damaging to 'the
trust and the republican party was
brought out at the hearing, and It
was decided by the democratic ma
jority of the committee to summon
John D. Rockefeller. At this point,
the republican members of the com
mittee decided that it was a salubrious
time for them to adjourn, and Mr.
Littleton voted with them. Chairman
Stanley of the committee charges Lit
tleton with beTlrg in league with the
trust and the republicans, and the
Anti-Trust League demanded his im
peachment. Littleton's speech in de
fense of his personal privilege was
applauded by republicans and some
democrats, but the fact of his voting
with the republicans at the time he
did can't be effaced by any amount of
applause.
Mr. F. "W. Hawthorne, who for a
number of years was editor of the
Times-Union, and later the leading
editorial writer on the New York
Commercial., died at his home in New
- York City the other day. Mr. Haw
thorne distinguished himself by his
noble work on the Times-Union dur
ing the yellow fever epidemic of 1888,
when for weeks he was editor, re
porter and manager, all his associates
having been "stricken down or fright
ened away. He succeeded Col. C. K.
Merrill as eclftor in chief in 1890, and
lor years did splendid work, making
the. T.-U. the most thoroughly effective
. newspaper it ever had been. Later,
he went to New York, to take the po
sition on the Commercial that he held
the remainder of his life. Mr. Haw
thorn was & ""thorough newspaper
man. a brilliant and incisive writer and
a gentleman of the highest ideals. The
writer was honored with his personal
friendship and deeply regrets to hear
of his death.
To supply a basis for work for th f
committee on postofnees and post
roads. Senator Jonathan Bourne has
introduced a bill-into the Senate pro
viding for a parcel post system. The
measure authorizes an Increase to
eleven pounds in the size of fourth
class mall packages, from the present
maximum of four pounds. Decrease
of charges from the present rate of
one cent per ounce will be provided.
Pound packages will be carried for
ten cents, with an additional charge
of four cents for each additional
pound. For the smallest package pro
vided for, weighing eight ounces,
there will be a charge of six cents.
If this bill is passed, It win go a long
way toward delivering us from the
tyranny of the express companies.
Tv been hopin for a long time
that the reel estate people would git
together and do some of the things
that the bored of trade .' Is 'always
talking about and never doln'," says a
writer In the Lakeland Telegram. And
Lakeland Isn't the only pebble on the
beach.
If the 'revelations in the?MeNamara
case enable union labor to rid Itself
of Its present incubus, the czar-like
Gompers, they will not be an unmixed
A dispatch from Washington saj's
that the mall order houses, contrary
to the usually accepted opinion, do
not want the parcels j03t. The Star
doesn't know Just who wants the par
cels post, but It is sure that everyone
who has a small parcel to send, and
not much money' to pay for sending It,
whether it be the small storekeeper
or ordinary citizen, needs it.
The Senate committee has resumed
Its consideration of the Lorimer ca3e,
and there is hopes that it will arrive
at a conclusion within three or four
years after Dorimer's terra expires.
Clarence , Darrow, the celebrated
criminal lawyer who defended the Mc
Namaras, !s to receive $50,000 for his
services. He believed his clients in
nocent when he took the case, but the
evidence against them soon convinced
him of their guilt and then he lent his
energies t3 saving their live.
At Los Angeles Tuesday, Jas. B. Mc-
Xaraara was sentenced to life im
prisonment for dynamiting the Times
build'ng. His brother, John, was sen
tenced to fifteen years.
In the school election at Anthony
Saturday, .he people of that commun
ity decided to form a sub-school dis
trict by a vote of 20 to 8. A 2-mill
rate was decided on and the follow
ing were elected trustees: G. M.
Brown, president, C. C. Priest and C.
W. Turner.
Thousands of women voted in the
Ixs Ange'ies election Tuesday. Har-
riman, thi socialist candidate, who

ADVICE FROM
A
CUSTOMER
"As soon as a person be
gins to accumulate money h
begins to take an interest in!
living. The very fact that
he can save small amounts
and make them larger makes
him 'hustle' and compels his
interest and attention. In
vest a dollar in our Savings
Department, add to it weekly
or monthly and see how your
efforts will increase. I've
tried it and know you, try
it."

IMPORTANT SUCCESS FOR ITALY
Tripoli, Dec. 6. A force of twenty
thousand Italians yesterday attacked
and occupied the Turkish military
camD on the Oasis of Ain-Zara. in the
vicinity of Tripoli, after a severe bat
tle. Both sides lost heavily. The reg
ular Turkish troops. assisted by
Arabs, defended the settlement brave-
Iv. but were forced to retreat to the
interior, abandoning eight cannon
many tents and a quantity of provis
ions. The battle opened in the morn
ing, with a heavy bombardment by the
fleet, under cover of which the Ital
ians advanced to the attack.
The headquarters staff of the Italian
army asserts the battle was a decisive
one for the possession of the country,
as it almost entirely clears the oasis
around the town of Tripoli and forces
the Turks away from their base of
supplies and the coast.

In the Office of Mayor
The city council met last night In
regular session with the following
members in their seats. President
Jone?. Councilmen Carroll, Carmichael.
Edwards, Fausett and Helvenston.
Minutes of last meeting and a reg
ular session were read and approved.
Mr. Frank Gates was present and
again asked the council to pay his
bill of $40.55 for damages to his motor
cycle and for medical treatment to
himself, when he collided with the
telephone post, in trying to avoid a
collision with the fire wagon. On mo
tion the council ordered one-half of
the bill paid. Mr. Gates agreed to ac
cept this amount
On recommendation of the street
committee the council ordered $40 paid
on the bill for $62 of the Woodmar
Sand & Stone Co. for repairing Mrs.
Violet Powers fence.
Mr. K. L. Anderson in a communi
cation to the council, acknowledged
the city's letter asking for a price on
the water plant, and stated that he
had taken the matter up with the
company and would let the city have
its answer as soon as "received.
Mr. J. R. Moorhead asked that the
city allow him to buy a small cor
ner from its 40-acre dumping ground
lot in the northwestern part of town
which he had fenced up by mistake.
The finance committee was empower
ed to settle with Mr. Moorhead.
Bids were opened for putting in cer
tain plumbing in the city jail and for
repairing the roof and gutters on the
city hall. The bid of Mr. Walter
Yonge for plumbing was accepted, for
$68. The big of the Messrs. Ballanger
for repairing the roof was accepted
for $57.
On motion $1000 was ordered trans
ferred from the electric light to the
general fund to provide funds for pay
mg all bills. There was quite a
heavy drain on the city's finances for
the month, the lot having been paid
for, which took $4000 and $1000 paid
on account of the drainage canal at
the Seaboard.
President Jones asked Mr. Carroll
to take the chair, whereupon Mr.
Jones offered the following resolution,
which was seconded by Mr. Helvenston
and unanimously passed.
