BELLOW FALLS, DEC. 10, J869.
The reduction of the publio duht last
month proves to have been over seven
nnd one-half millions, and since the pres
ent administration came into power last
March, the public debt has been paid at
the rato of wore than two hundred and
sixty-two thousand dollars per day.
The first annual message of Tresidcnt
Grant is received with great favor, iu
some instances even by Democrats. His
suggestions relative to the attempt of
Georgia to slip in to the Union after re
pudiating reconstruction, ".nil that slio
had now better be made to do her work
over again, vill lie received by ail true
patriots with the most cordial and hearty
approbation. The Tresident stands by
his Union faith. He sustains the people
and the people will sustain him, and the
steiling common souse and excellence of
the entire message is such that wo make
no excuse for the space we give it on this
page.
The President's Message.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House
of Representatives:
NATIONAL BLESSINGS.
In coming before you for the first time
as Chief Magistrate of this great nation,
it is with gratitude to the Giver of all
good for the many benefits wo enjoy.
We are blessed with peace at homo and
are without entangling alliances abroad,
to forebode trouble, with a territory un
surpassed in fertility of an area equal to
the abundant support of fivo hundred
millions of people, and abounding in
every variety of useful mineral, in quan
tity sufficient to supply the world for gen
erations ; with exhuberent crops; with a
variety of climate adapted to the pro
duction of every species of earth's riches
and suited to the habits, tastes and re
quirements of every living thing; with
a population of 40,000,000 of free peo
ple, all speaking one lauguagt ; with fa
cilities for every mortal toacquirc an ed
ucation; with institutions, closing to none
the avenues to fame or any blessing or
feature that vaay be conceived, with
freedom of the pulpit, the press nnd the
schools; with a revenue flowing into the
National Treasury, beyond the require
ments of the Government, happily har
mony is being rapidly restored within
our own borders.
Manufactures hitherto unknown iu our
country are springing up in all directions,
- producing a degree of national indepen
dence unequaled by that of any other
power.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONGRESS.
These ulessings, and countless others,
are entrusted to our care, and more for
safe keeping for the brief period of a ten
m.T - oimri, we must eacn of
us return to the ranks of the people, who
have conferred upon us our honors, an
account to them of our stewardship.
OUR BUFFERING COMMERCE.
The loss of our commerce is the only
result of the. late rebellion which has
not received sufficient attention from you.
To this subject I call your earnest atten
tion. I will not now suggest plans by
which the object may be effected, but will
if necessary, make it the subject of-a
special message during the session of
Congress.
RECONSTRUCTION.
At the March term, Congress, by a
joint resolution, authorized the Executive
to order elections in the States of Vir
ginia, Mississippi and Texas ; to submit
to them the constitutions which each had
previously in convention framed, and to
submit these constitutions, either entire
or in separate parts, to be voted npon, at
the discretion of the Executive. Under
this authority, elections were called in
Virginia. : The Governor and Licuten-
ant-Oovernor have been installed. The
Legislature met, nnd did all required by
the resolution and by all the reconstruc
tion acts of Congress, and abstained
from all doubtful authority.
I recommend that her Senators and
Representatives be admitted, and that
the State be fully restored to its place in
the family of States.
THE CASE or GEORGIA.
Seven States which passed ordinances
of secession have been fully restored to
their places in the Union ; the eighth
- (Georgia) held an election at which she
ratified her Constitution, republican in
' form, a Governor, members of Congress,
a State Legislature, and all other officers
required. The Governor was duly in
stalled and the Legislature met and per
formed all the acts then required of them
by the Reconstruction acts of Congress.
Subsequently, however, in violation of
the Constitution which they had just rat
ified, as since decided by the Supreme
Court of the State, they unseated the
colored members of the Legislature and
admitted to seats some members who are
disqualified by the third clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitu
tionan article which they themselves
had contributed to ratify. ' Under these
circumstances I would submit to you
whether it would not be wise, without de
lay, to enact a law authorizing the Gov
ernor of Georgia to convene the mem
bers origin lly elected to the Legislature
requiring each member to take the oath
prescribed by the Reconstruction acts,
and Ben! to be admitted who are .ineligi
ble under the third cUuse of the Four
teenth Amendment.
HISSIBSim AND TEXAS.
Elections were called in Mississippi and
'exss, to commeuce on tho 30th of No-
ember, 1869, to last two days in Missis
;ppi and four days in Texas. Tho tslec
lions have taken place, but the results
are not known. It is hoped that the acts
of the legislatures of these State?, when
they meet, will be such as to secure your
approval, and thus close tho work of re
construction. THE CURRENCY.
Among the evils growing out of the
rebellion, and not yet referred to, is that
of an irredeemable currency. It is au
evil which I hope will receive your most
earnest attention. It is a duty, and one
of the highest duties of the Government
to secure to the citizens a medium of ex
change, of fixed aud unvarying value.
RETURN TO SPECIE PAYMENTS. j
This implies a return to a specio basis
and no substitute for it can be devised.
It should be commenced now, and reach
ed at the earliest practicable moment,
consistent with a fuir regard to the inter
ests of the debtor class.
IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION NOT DESIRABLE.
Immediate resumption, if practicable,
would not be desirable. It would com
pel the debtor class to pay beyond their
coutracts thi premium on gold at the
date of their purchase, and would bring
bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluc
tuations, however, in the paper value of
the measure of all value, gold, is detri
mental to tho interests of trade. It
makes tho man of business an involun
tary gambler, fur in all sales, when fu
ture payment is to be made, both par
ties speculate as to what will be the val
ue of the currency to be paid and re-
, ceived.
GRADUAL RETURN TO SPECIE.
I earnestly recommend to you, then,
; such legislation ns will insure a gradual
reeurn to specio payments and put an
immediate siop tofiunctuations in theval
uo of currency. The methods to secure the
former of these results are as numerous
as are the speculators on political ccno
my. To secure the latter I see but one
way, and that is to authorize the tfeasu
ry to redeem its own paper at a fixed
price, whenever it is presented, and to
withhold from circulation all curreucy
so redeemed until it is sold again for
gold. The vast resources of the nation,
both developed and undeveloped, ought
to make our credit the best on earth, with
a less burdeu of taxation than the citi
zens have endured for six years past.
The entire public debt could be paid in
ten years, but it is not desirable that peo
ple should be taxed to pay it in that
time. Year by year the ability to pay
the tax increase in a rapid ratio, but the
burden of interest ought to be reduced as
rapidly as can be done without the vio
lation of contract. The public debt is
represented in a great part by bonds,
Laavlaijc tVtaua 11 C ftsv tnvatv -resale tUIUU.
bearing the interest at the rate of six per
cent, and five per eeut, respectively. It
is optional with the government to pay
these bonds at any period after the expi
ration of the last time mentioned upon
their face. The time has already arrived
when a great part of them may be taken
up, and is rapidly approaching when all
may be. It is believed that those which
are now due may be replaced by bonds
bearing a ratio of interest not exceeding
4i per cent., and as rapidly as the re'
maiuder becomes due. that they may be
replaced iu the same way. To accord
plish this, it may be necessary to author
ize the ititcrest to be paid at either of the
three or four money centers of Europe,
or by anyassistant trersurer of the Unit
ed States, at the option of the holder of
the bonds. I suggest this subject fur the
consideration of Congress, and also sim
ultaneously with this the propriety of re
deeming our currency as before suguest-
ed at its market value at the time the
law goes into effect, increasing the rate
at which currency will be bought and
sold from day to day or week to week, at
the same rate of interest as tho .govern
mcnt pays upon its bonds.
The subject of tariff and internal taxa
tion will necessarily receive your atten
tion. i The revenues of the country are
greater than the requirements, aud may
with safety be reduced, but the funding
of the debt in a four or a four and a half
per cent loan would reduce the annual
current expenses largely, thus, after fund
ing, justifying a greater reduction of the
taxation than would be now expedient.
I suggest a postponemont of this question
until the next meeting of Congrets. It
may be advisable to modify the taxation
and tariff in instances where unjust or
burdensome discriminations are made by
the present laws, but a general revision
of the laws regarding this subject I would
recommend the postponement of for the
present I also suggest the renewal of
the tax on incomes, but at a reduced
rate, say if 3 per cent, and this tax to
expire in three years, with the funding
of the National debt before suggested. I
feel safe in saying that the taxes and the
revenues from imports may be reduced
safely from 860,000,000 to 1 90,000,000
per annum at once, and may be still fur
ther reduced from year to year as the re
sources of the country are developed.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury shows the receipts of the Govern
ment for the fiscal year ending June 30th,
1869, to be $370,943,747, and the expen
ditures, including interest, bouuties, etc.,
to be $321,490,597.
The estimates for the ensuing year, are
more favorable to the government and
will no doubt show's much larger de
crease of the public debt The receipts
in the Treasury beyond expenditures
have exceeded the aniouut necessary to
place the credit of the sinking fund as
provided by law. To lock up the surplus
in the Treasury and withhold it from cir
cvlation would lead to such a contrac
tion of the currency as to cripplo trade
and seriously afreet tho prosperity (if the
country. Under the circumstances the
Secretary of tho Treasury and myself
heartily coucurred in tho propriety of us
ing all the surplus currency in the Treas
ury in the purchase of bonds, thus reduc
ing the interest-bearing debt of the couu-
try and of submitting to Congress the
question of the disposition to be made of
the bonds so purchased. The bonds now
held by the Treasury amount to about
875,000,000, iucludiug those belonging
to the sinking fund. I recommend that
the whole be placed to the credit of the
sinking fund. Your attention is respec
tively invited to the recommendations of
the Secretary of the Treasury for the
creation of the office of Commissioner of
custom of revenue, for the increase of sal
ary to certain classes of officials, and tho
substitution of increased national bank
circulation to replace the outstanding
three per cent, certificates, and most es
pecially to his recommendation for the
repeal of laws allowing shares of fines,
penalties, forfeitures, &c, to officers of
the government, or to informers. The
office of Commissioner of Iutcrnal Reve
nue is oue of the most arduous and re
sponsible under the government. It falls
but little if any, short of a Cabinet posi
tion in its importance and responsibilities.
I would ask for it, therefore, such legis
lation as in your judgment will place the
office on a footing of dignity commensu
rate with its importance, and with a char
acter aud qualifications of the class of
men required to fill it properly. As the
United Stales is the freest of all nations,
so, too, its people sympathize with all
people struggling for liberty and self
government; but while so sympathizing,
it is due to our honor that we should ab
stain from enforcing our views upon uu
willicg nations, and from taking an in
terested part without invitation. In the
quarrels between different natuis, or be
tween governments and their subjects,
our course should always be in conformi
ty with strict justice and law, internation
al and lo'jal. Such has been the policy
of tho Administration, in dealing with
these questions for more than a year. A
valuable province of Spain, and a near
neighbor of ours, iu whom all our people
cannot but feel a deep interest, has been
struggling for iudependenceand freedom.
The people or the United States enter
tain the same warm feelings and sympa
thies for thepeopleof Cuba in their peud-
ing struggle, that they manifested
throughout the previous struggles be
tween Spain and her former colonies in
behalf of the latter, but the contest has at
no time assumed the conditions which
amount to war in the sense of in
ternational law, or which would show the
existence of a defacto political organiza
tion of the insurgents sufficient to justify
a recognition of belligerency. The prin
ciple is maintained, however, that this
nation is its own judge when to accord
the rights of belligerency, either to a
people struggling to free themselves from
a government they believe to be oppres
sive, or to independent nations at war
with each other. The United States have
no disposition to interfere with the do
mestic relations of Spain to her colonial
possessions on this continent. They be
lieve that in due time Spain and other
European poweis will find their interest
in sundering those relations, and estab
lishing their present dependencies as in
dependent powers members of the fami
ly of nations, to be no longer regarded
as subject to transfer from one European
power to another. When the present re
lation of colonies ceases, they are to be
come independent powers, exercising the
right of choice and of self-control.
In the determination of their further
relations with other powers, the UnitQd
States, in order to ht a stop to blood
shed in Cuba and in the interest of neigh
boring powers, proposed their good offices
to bring the existing contest to a termi
nation. The office not being accepted,
this claim, on the basis which we believ
ed could be advantageous to both parlies
was withdrawn. It is hoped that tho
good offices of the United States may yet
prove advantageous for -the settlement o
this unhappy strife. Meanwhile, a num
ber cf illegal expeditions against Cuba
have been broken up. It has been the
endeavor of the administration to exe
cute the neutrality laws in good faith,
no matter how unpleasant the task
made so by the suffering we have endur
ed by the lack cf like good faith toward
us by other nations. Oh the 26th of
March last the United States schooner
Lizzie Major was arrested on the high
seas by a Spanish frigate and two pas
sengers taken from it and carried a",
prisoners to Cuba. Representations c.
these facts were made to the Spanish gov
eminent as soon a official information
of them reached Washington. The two
passengers were est at liberty and th..
Spanish government assured the United.
States that the captain of the frigate ha!
acted without law, that he had been rt
primanded for the cruelty of his conduc
and that the Spanish authorities in Cuba
would not sanction any action in viola
tion of the rights or treat with disrespect
the sovereignty of this nation.
The question of the seizure of the brig
Mary Fowell at one of the Bahama Is
lands by Spanish authorities, is now the
subject of correspondence between this
government md thos of Spain and Great
Britain. Thj Captain General of Cuba
about May list issued a proclamation
authorizing starch to be made of vessels
on the high sets. Immediate remonstrance
was made against this, whereupon tho
Captain General issued a new proclama
tion limiting tie right of senrch to vessels
of the United States, so far us authorized
under tho treaty of 1793. This procla
mation, however, was immediately with
drawn. I hare always felt that the most
intimate relations should be cultivated
between the republic of the United States
aud all indepmdent nntions on this con
tinent. It nuy be well worth consider
ing whether aew treaties between the
United States nd them may not be profit
ably entered kito to secure more intimate
relations, frieully, commercial and oth
erwise. The subject of an interoeeanic
canal to conmct the Atlantic and Pacif
ic oceans thrsugli the Isthmus of Darieu
is one in whrh commerce is greatly in
terested. Instructions have been given
to our minister to the republic of the
United Slates of Columbia to endeavor
to obtaiu autlority for a survey by the
government h order to determine the
practicability of such an undortakiug,
and a chatf jr for the right of way to
build, by prrvate euterprise. such a work
if the survey proves it to be prac ticable.
In order to comply with the agreement
of the United States as to a mixed com
mission at Liina for the adjustment of
claims, it became necessary to send a
commissioner and secretary to Lima in
August last. JTo appropriation having
been made by Congress for this purpose,
it is now askec that one be made covcr
inj the past aid future expenses of the
Commission. The good offices of the
United States to bring about a peace be
tween Spain aid the South American re
publics with vhich she is at war having
been accepted by Spain, Teru and Chili,
a Congress hoi been invited to be held
in Washington during the present Win
ter. A grant ras been given to Europe
ans of an exclusive right of transit over
the territory of Nicaragua, to which Cos
ta Rica has given her assent, which it is
alleged conflicts with vested rights of
citizens of the United States. The State
department hue now this subject under
consideration. ; The Minister of Peru
having made representations that there
was a state of war between Peru and
Spain, and that Spain was constructing
in and near Ntw York thirty gunboats
which might be used by Spain in such a
way as to reliere the naval force at Cuba
so as to operate against Peru, orders were
given to prevent their departure. No
further steps having been taken by the
representative of the Peruvian govern
ment to prevent the departure of these
vessels, and I not feeling authorized to
detain property of a nation with which
we are at peace on a mere executive or
der, the matter baa been referred to the
Courts to decide. The conduct of the
war between the allies and the Republic
of Paraguay has made the intercourse
with that country so difficult that it has
been deemed advisable to withdraw our
representative from there. Towards the
close of the last administration, a con
vention was signed at London for the
settlement of all outstanding claims be
tween Great Britain and the Uuited
States, which failed to receive the advice
and consent of the Senate to its ratifica
tion. The tone and the circumstances
attending the negotiation of the treaty
were unfavorable to its acceptance by the
people of the United States, and its pro
visions were wholly inadequate for the
settlement of the grave wrongs that had
been sustained by the government as we
as by its citizens.
The injuries resulting to the United
States by reason of the course adopted
by Great Britian during our late civil
war, in the increased rates of insurance,
in the diminution of exports and imports
and other obstructions to domestic indus
try and production, in its effect upon the
foreign commerce of the country, in the
decrease and transfer to Great Britian of
our commercial marine, in the prolonga
tion of the war and the increased cost,
both in treasure and in life, of its sup
pression, could not be adjusted and satis
fied as ordinary commercial claims, which
continually arise between commercial na
tions. And yet the convention treated
them simply as such ordinary claims,
from which they differ more widely, in
the gravity of their character, than in
the magnitude of their amount. Great
even as is that difference, not a word was
found in the treaty and not an inference
could be drawn from it to remove the
sense of the unfriendliness of the course
of Great Britian in our struggle for ex
istence, which had so deeply and univer
sally impressed itself upon the people of
this country. Believing that a conven
tion thus misconceived in its scope and
inadequate iu its provisions would not
have produced that hearty and cordial
settlement of the pendingquestions which
alone is consistent with the relations I
desire to have established between the
United States and Great Britain, I re
garded the action of the Senate in re
jecting the treaty as wisely taken, in the
interest ot peace, and as a necessary step
in the direction of a perfect and cordial
friendship between the two countries. A
sensitive people, conscious of their pow
ers, are more at ease under a great wron"
wholly unatoned, than under the rC
strain, of a seUlement which satisfies
neither their ideas of justice nor their
grave sense of the grievance they have
sustained. The rejection of the treaty
was followed by a state of public feeling
on both sides which I tuougnt not wvor
ablo to an iuimediato attempt at a reuew-
al of negotiations. I accordingly so in
structed the minister of the United Etutes
to Great Britian, and fouud that my
views in this regard wero shared by her
ms
ajesty a minister. I nope tuiu me lime

RECIPROCITY WITH CANADA OPPOSED.
The (incstion of renewing a trefttv for
.j a .
reciprocal trade between the United
States and the British provinces on this
'ontinetit, has not been favorably cou
riered by the administration. The ud-
antaaes otsueh a treat v would bo wiiol-

almost equal to the protection which our
manufacturers now receive lrom the tar-
Some arrangements, however, for
the regulation of commercial intercourse
between tho L nitcd fctatcs and tho .Do
minion of Canada may be desirable.
The President then states sonic mat
ters of various international commission-
era, which have been appointed to settle j
ciaims, opposes monopolizers of ocean
cable?, condoms the practice of foreign
ers who ciime over here to get themselves
naturalized and then to return to the old
countries, and claim American protec
tion, when they get into trouble abroad,
without ever having been in reality an
American citizen, which wcomit for want
of room, and because it is not of any in
terest to the general reader.
THREE CARDINAL POINTS OF HIS rOLICY.
Upon my assuming the responsibilities
of chief magistrate of the United States,
it was with the conviction that three
things were essential to its peace, pros
perity and fullest developemeut. First
among these is strict integrity in fulfill
ing all our obligations. Second, to se
cure protection to the person and prop
erty ot the citizen of the United States
in each and every portion of our Ameri
can country, wherever he may choose to
move, without reference to original na
tionality, religion, color or politics, de
manding of him only obedience to the
laws and proper respect for the rights of
others. Third, the union of all the
states, with equal rights, indestructible
by any constitutional means. To secure
the first of these, Congress has taken two
essential steps, first in declaring by joint
resolution that the public debt should be
paid principal and interest in coin, and
secondly by providing the means forpay-
U12. 1 roviuinethe means hov.pvprnr.nLi
not secure the object desired, without a
proper administration of the laws for
the collection of the revenues, and an
economical disbursement of them. To
this subject the administration has most
earnestly addressed itself, wilh results, I
trust, satisfactory to the country. There
ha3 been no hesitation in changing offi
cials in order to secure an efficient exe
cution of the laws, sometimes too, where
in a mere party view, undesirable politi
cal results were likely to follow, nor any
hesitation in sustaining efficient officials
against remonstances wholly political.
The President desires the appeal of
the tenure of office act, and then discuss
es the Indian affairs, post office matters,
and closes as follows :
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.
The report of the secretary of the inte
rior shows that the quantity of public
land disposed of during the year ending
the 30th of June, 18G9, was 7,666,152
acres, exceeding that of the preceding
year by 1,010,409 acres. Of this amount
2,899,544 acres were sold for cash and
2,737,365 acres entered under the home
stead laws. The remainder was eranteil
to aid in the construction of works of in
ternal improvement, approved to the
states as swamp lands, and located with
warrants and scrip. The cash reeeinn
from all sources were $4,472,886, exceed
ing those .of the preceding year $2,840,-
I4U.
During the last fiscal year 23.196
names were added to tho pension rolls,
4876 dropped therefrom, leaving at iu
ciose lOt,Jbo. Ihe amount paid to nen
. ' "
sioncrs, including the comnenaatmn f
msoursing agents, was 828,422,884, an
. -
increase ot 84,411,902 on that of th
vious year. The munificenceof rVur.
has been conspicously manifested in its
legislation lor the soldiers nnl
who suffered in the recent struggle to

tiocs to the pension rolls of each succes
sive year since the conclusion of hostili
ties result in a great degree from the re
peated amendments of theact of the 14th
of July, 1862, which extended iu provis
ions to cases not falling within its origi
nal scope. The large outlay which is
thus occasioned is further increased by
the more liberal allowance bestowal ;.
that date upon those who in thB li. r
duty were wholly or permanently disa
bled. Public opinion has given an em
phatic sanction to these measures of Con
gress, aud it will be conceded that no
part of our public burden is more cheer
fully borne than that which is imposed
by this branch of the service. It ncces
hitHtes, the next fiscal year, iu addition
to the amount just y charged to. the naval
pcnsioii fund, an appropriation of 830,.
000,000.
During the year 1809, tho patent of
fice issued 13,762 patents, and its receipts
wero 8686,289, beiug 8213,926 more than
the expenditures,
I would respectfully call your atten
tion to tho recommendation of the secre
tary of tho interior for uniting the duties
of supervising the education of the freed
mcn with tha other duties devolving up
on the commissioner of education.
THE CENSUS.
If it is- the dejire of Congress tw- make
the census which must bo taken during
the year 1870 morj complete aud perfect
than heretofore, I would suggest early
action upon any plan that may be agreed
upon. As Congress, at its last session,
appointed a committee to take into con
sideration such measures as might be
deemed proper in reference to the census
aud to report a plan, I desist from say
ing more.
AGRICULTURE.
I recommend to your favorable con
sideration tli3 cfuirus of the agricultural
bureau for liberal appropriations in a
country so diversified, in climate and
soil, as ours, and with a population so
largely dependent upon agriculture.
Tho benefits that can be conferred by
properly fostering this bureau arc incal
culable. THE 'LOPE.
I deiire respectfully to call the atten
tion of Congress to the inadequate sala
ries of a number of the most important
officers of the government. In this mes
sage I will not enumerate them, but will
specify only the justices of the supreme
court. No change has been made in
their salaries for 15 years, aud within
that time the labors of the court have
largely increased, and the expenses of
living have at Uast doubled during the
same time. Congress has twice found it
necessary to increase largely the com
pensation of its own members, and the
duty which it owes to another ('epartment
of the government deserves, and will un
doubtedly receive, its due consideration.
There are roauy subjects not alluded
to in this message, which might with
propriety be introduced, but I abstain,
believing that your patriotism and states
manship will suggest the topics of legis
lation most conductive to the interests of
the whole people. On my part, I prom
ise a rigid adherence to the laws aud
their strict enforcement
