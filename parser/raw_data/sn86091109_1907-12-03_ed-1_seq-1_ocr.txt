WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The
joint committee of the senate and
house, appointed to notify the pres
ident was in session reached the
White House shortly after TO
o'clock. The committee consisted of
Senators Allison and Teller anti
Representatives "Williams and Taw
ney. They were accompanied by
Sergeant-wt-Arms Ramsdell of the
senate.
The president told the committee
he would communicate his message
in writing to congress.
President Roosevelt's message was
laid before the honse at IS:30, and
its reading immediately began. The
message, in part, is as follows:
No nation has greater resources
than ours, and I think it can be
truthfully said that the citizens of
no nation possess greater -energy
and industrial ability. In no nation
are the fundamental business con
ditions sounder Than in ours at this
very moment; and it is foolish,
when such is the case, tor people to
hoard money Instead of keeping it
in sound banks; for it is such board
ing that is the immediate occasion
of money • stringency.
In any large body of men, how
ever, there are certain to be some
who are dishonest, and if the con
ditions are such that these men
prosper or commit their misdeeds
with impunity, their example 1 s a
very evil thing for the community.
Where these men are business men
of great sagacity and of tempera
ment both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions are
such that they act without super
vision or control and at first without
effective check from public opinion,
they delude many innocent people
into making investments or embark
ing in kinds of business that are
really unsound. ' When the misdeeds
of these successfully dishonest men
are discovered, suffering comes not
only upon them, hut upon the inno
cent men whom they have misled.
R is a painful -awakening, whenever
it occurs; and, naturally, when it
floes occur those who suffer are apt
to forget that the longer it was de
ferred the more painful it would be.
in the effort to punish the guilty it
is both wise and proiter to endeavor
s ° far as possible to minimize the
distress of those who have ben mis
. by the guilty. Yet it is not pos
sihle to refrain because of such dis
tress fv 0m striving to put an end to
ne misdeeds that are the ultimate
fasses of the suffering, and, as a
* e *ns to this end. where possible
n punish those responsible for
mtr There may be honest differ
ences of opinion as to many govern
'nenty) policies; but surely thero
fan he no such differences as to the
need of unflinching perseverance In
e war against successful dishon
esty.
En my message to the congress on
°*fember 5. 1905, I said:
H the folly of man mars the gen
"'ell-being, then those who are
Innot
ent of the folly will have to
tw Part tEle P enf Gty incurred bv
°^e who are guilty of the folly.
Panic brought on by the speeula

tern the interests of all men are so
closely intertwined that in the im
mense majority of canes a straight
dealing man, who by his efficiency,
by his ingenuity and industry, ben
etits himself, must also benefit otta
ers. Normally, the man of great
productive capacity who becomes
rich by guilding the labor of many
other men does so by enabling them
to produce more than they could
produce without his guidance; and
both he and they share in the ben
efit. which cornes also to the public
at large. The superficial fa<jt. that
the sharing may be unequal must
never blind us to the underlying
fact that there is this sharing, and
that the benefit conies in some de
gree to each man concerned. Norm
ally. the wageworker, the man of
small means, and the average con
sumer, as well as the average pro
ducer, are a'll alike helped by mak
ing conditions such that the man of
exceptional business ability receives
fan exceptional reward for his abil
ity. Something can be done by leg
islation to help the general prosper
ity; but no such help of a perma
nently bénéficiai character can be
given to the less able and less for
tunate save as the results of a policy
which shall inure to the advantage
jof a lilndustrious and efficient peo
pie who act decently; and this is
only another way of saying that any
benefit which comes to the less able
and less fortunate must of necessity
come even more to the more able
and more fortunate. If, therefore,
the less fortunate man is moved by
envv of his more fortunate brother
to strike at the conditions under
which they have both, though un
equally, prospered, the result will
'assuredly be that while damage may
come to the one struck at. it will
visit with an even heavier load the
one who strikes the blow. Taken as
a whole, we must all go up or go
down together.
"Yet. wliiie not merely admitting,
but insisting upon this, it is also
true that where there is no govern
mental restraint or supervision some
of the exceptional men use their en
ergies, not 111 ways that are for the
common good, but in ways which
tell against This common good. The
fortunes amassed through corporate
organization are now so large, and
vest such power In those that wield
them, as to make it a matter of ne
cessity to give to the sovereign—
that is, to the government. which
reprerents the people as a whole—
some effective power of supervision
over their corporate use. Tn order
to insure a healthy social and in
dustrial life, every big corporation
should be held responsible by, and
be accountable to, some sovereign
strong enough to control its con
duct. I am in no sense hostile to
I corporations. This is an age of
combination, and any effort, to pre
vent all combination will be not
only useless, but in the end vicious,
because of the contempt for law
which the failure to enforce law in
evitably produces. We should, more
1 over, recognize in cordial and ana
pie fashion the immense good ef
fected by corporate agencies in a
country such as ours, and the wealth
of intellect, energy, and fidelity
devoted to their service, and there
fore normally to the service of the
public, by their officers and direct
ors. The corporation has come to
stay, just as the trade union has
come to stay. Bach can do and has
done great good. Each should be
favored so long as it does good. But
each should he sharply checked
w'here 1t acts against law and Just
ice.
* * The makers of our
National Constitution prodived es
! pecially that the regulation of in
terstate commerce should come
within the sphere of the general
! government. The arguments In fav
I or of their taking this stand were
I even then overwhelming. But they
I are far stronger today, in view of
the enormous development of great
business agencies, usually corporate
! in form. Experience has shown
'conclusively that it Is useless to try
I to get any adequate regulation and
supervision of these great corpora
I tions by state action. Such regula
! tion and supervision can only be ef
S fectively exercised by a sovereign

COMMERCIAL CLUB DISCUSSED
FEATURES OF LOWER RIVER
IMPROVEMENT AND UPPER
CONDEMNATION.
The Commercial club last night
discussed the features of needed im
provement of the Snake and Colum
bia rivers between Lewiston and Ce
lilo, at which point the government
is engaged in the construction of a
passage canal with locks.
The condemnation of the Clear
water river as a navigable stream
was also fully discussed and a senti
ment favorable to such action ex
pressed. The general view entertain
ed toward the condemnation of this
stream is that industries cannot be
located on the river until such ac
tion is taken and the power secured
to the state to grant permits for the
construction of dame for power pur
poses and booms for handling logs,
shingles, bolts and wood.
The club deferred action on this
question until the matter could be
more fully discussed at a subsequent
meeting.
President Bender was instructed
to prepare a telegram to be sent to
the Idaho delegation in congress
notifying them of their appointment
as a committee to represent the club
at the rivers and harbors conven
tion, which meets in Washington
this week.
