we lay before our readers this week
will commend itself for its brevity
and clearness. Ue makes impor

not meet with great favor. His
position upon the Alabama question
cannot but meet with favor, and his
suggestion that a commission .be

President's Message.
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
A Tear of peace and general piosperity to
this nation, has passed since the last assemb
ling ox congress. w e nave, rorougn a suna
Providence, been blessed with abundant crops
and fcavs been spared from complications and
wax with foreign nations, in onr midst com'
paxativo harmony has been restored. It is to
be regretted, however, that a free exercise of
iectiou franchise has by violence and' intimi
dation been denied to citucens in exceptional
aaes in several of ths btatee lately in rebel
lion, end the verdict ot the people has thereby
been r versed.
i'ie status of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas
hav been restored to representation in our
national councils. Georgia, the only state now
withoot representation, may confidently be
expected to take her place there also at the
beginning of the new year; and then, let us
hope, the work of reconstruction will be com
pleted. With an acquietsence on the part of
the whole people in the national obligation to
pay the public debt created as the price of our
onion, the pensions to onr disabled soldiers
ud sailors and their widows and orphans, and
jn changes to the Constitution which have
been made necessary by a great rebellion,
there is no ren vhS we should not advance
In material prosper nd happiness as no
nation ever did after so otracted nnd devas
tating a war.
6oon after the existing war broke out in
Europe, the protection of the United Su5
Minister in Paris was invoked in favor of the
" ortb. Germans domiciled in French territory.
Instructions were issued to grant the protec
tion; This has been followed by an extension
of American protection to citizens of Saxony,
!&, Saxe Gotha Coburg, Colombia, Porta
pa,' Uruguay, Paraguay and Venezuela in
Pant. lhe charge was aii onerous one, re
quiring poustant and severs labor, as well as
eXeTCiaV yafciwutc, iuuuuui aiiu gwu
indirment. It has been performed to the en-
Ure satisfaction Of this government, and as I
officially informed, equally so to the satis
faction ot tiie government.
As socn as I learned that a Republic had
been proclaimed at Paris, and that the people
of France had acquiesced in the change, the
Minuter ot the United States was directed by
telegraph to zvoognize it and tender my con
gratulation and those ot the people of the
Vuited States. The re-establishment in
France of a system of government disconnec
ted with the dynastic traditions of Europe,
gvKneared to be a proper subject for the fekui
tattoo of Americans. Should the present
straggle, result in .attaching the hearts of the
French to par simpler forms of R-piesenta-tive
Government, it will be ft subject of still
further satisfaction to our people. 'While ws
maks no effort to Impose our Institutions upon
the inhabitants of My country, and while we
adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil
vmtMt elsewhere, we Cseaot be indifferent to
the spread of American voliQcal ideas in
srreat and highly civilized country like France.
Wa were asked by the new Government to
txse Q5 good offices jointly with those cf Euro
pean po?TS in the interest of peace. . Answer
was made, that- the established policy and true
interest of the United States forbids them to
inverter in European questions jointly with
European powers. I ascertained informally
' and unofueuJiy, that the Government of North
Germany was not then disposed to listen to
aneh rxnresenta&ioos from any powers, and
though earnestly wishing to see the blessings
Cf peace restored to the belligerents, with all
pi whom the United States are on terms of
friendship, I declined, on the part of this gov
rnmen to take steps which could only result
in injury to ?ur true interest, without advanc
ing pie object foT which our intervention was
invoke:'" Should th time come when action
of the United States can hasten the return of
peace by a single hour, that action will be
beartuy taken.
I deemed it pendent, in view of the number
of persons of German and French birth living
in the United States, to icsue, soon after offici
al notice of a state of war had been received
from both heligerenta, a proclamation defining
the duties of the United States, as a neutral,
and the obligations of persons residing within
their territory to pfeservo their laws and the
laws of this nation. The proclamation was
followed by others as ciraunulances seemed to
call for them. The people, thus made acquain
ted in advance of their duties and obligations,
have assisted in preventing a violation ef the
neutrality of the United States.
It is not understood that the condition of
)ha insurrection in Cuba has materially chang
axt ;uiue the close of the last sessions of Con
gress. In an early stage of the contest the
authorities of Spain inaugurated a system of
arbitrary snCK of close confinement, and of
military trial ano! execution of persons sus
pected of complicity with the insurgents, and
of summary embargo of lie properties and se
questration of their revenues D, Executive war
rant. Such proceeding, as far as they affected
the persons or property of citizens of the Uni
ted Stated States, were in violation of the pro
visions of the treaty of 1795 between the Uni
ted States and Spain, lieprescntations of in-jj-ies
resulting to several persons claiming to
ba eli;zens of tne United States, by reason of
such Tu,latini were made to the Spanish
Government from April 1860, to June last
The Spanikh aj'.'nister at Washington bad been
clothed with a km; ted power to aid in redres
sing such wrongs. J tiat power was with
drawn, in view, as it was aMd, of the unstable
situation in which the islana of Cuba then
was; which, however, did not lead to the re
vocation or suspension of the extraordinary
antk arbitrary functions exercised by ths exec
utive rwer in Cuba, and we were obliged to j
make our complaint at Madrid, In the ne
gotiations vns opened and still pending there,

our design to see them blested with goou Gov

nraaervinir their rcsnective Territorial integri-
tv: and of our sincere wish to extend our
own commercial and social relations with
hum.
The time is not probably far distant, when
in the natural course of events, the European

interests of the Spanish-American States more
closely to our own; and thus give uie uniieu
States all the pre-eminence and all the advan

Clay contemplated when, they proposed to join
the Conirress of Panama. '
During the last session of Congress a treaty
for the annexation oi tne nepuouc oi oau
Domingo to the United States failed to re
ceive the requisite two-thirds vote ot the Sen
ate. I was thorouehlv convinced . then that
the best interests of the country, commercially
and matenallv. demanded its ratification
Time has onlv confirmed me in this view,
now firmly believe that the United States
have entirely abandoned the project of accept
inc as a part of its territory the island of San
Domingo. A free port will be negotiated for
by European nations. In the Bsy of Camana
a commercial city will spring up, to which we
will be tributary without receiving corres
ponding benefits. The Government of San
Domingo has voluntary sought tins annexa
tion. It is a weak power, numbering prota-
ny tees inan uu,uvv mum, ana yet poseesting
one oi tne ncnest localities under ths sun,
capable of supporting a population of 10,0(0,-
uuu oi people in luxury, me people of San
Domingo, are not capablo of maintaining
themselves in their present condition ana
must loook for outside support They yearn
for the protection of our free institutions and
laws, our progress and civilization. Shall wt
refuse them? The acquisition of San Domin
go is desirable, because of its geographical
position. It commands the entrance to tht
Cam bean Sea and the Isthmus transit of com
merce. It possesses the richest soil, best and
most capacious harbors, most salubrious cli-
mate, and the most valuable products of the
foresttmine and soil of any of the West India
Islands. Its possession by the United State
will in a lew years Duiid up a costwise com
merce of immense magnitude, which will go
far toward restoring to us our lost merchant
marine. It will give to us those articles whicl.
we consume greatly and do not produce, thut
equalizing our exports and imports. In cast
ot loreigu war, it will give us command of aJ
the islands releiTed to,and thuspreventan etie
my from again posseting a rendezvous npon
our ooast it protects our trade between tht
States bordering on the Atlantic and thost
bordering on the Gulf of Mexico is by tht
Bahamas and the Antilles. Twice wo must.
as it were, pass through foreign countries tc
get from Georgia to the East Coast oi Florida.
San Domingo, with a subtle Government
under which her immense resources can bt
developed, will givo remunerative wages to
lUgUUvineu.. ihis labor will lake advautat
of every available means, oi transportation u,
abandon the ad jacent Inlands and seek tht
blessings of its freedom and its consequence-
that each iiihauitnnt received the reward oi
his own labor. Porto Eico and Cuba wil.
hare to abolish slavery as a measure of Felt
preservation to retain their laborers. San
Domingo will become a larco consumer o.
the products of 2Corthem farms and manufac
tories. The cheoprctc at which her cirircnt
can be furnished with food, tools, and machin
ery, will make necessary that the contmguom
Islands should have the same advantage, in
order to compete with the production cf sugar,
coffee, tobacco, tropical lruit, etc.. This wil.
open to us a wider market for our products.
be production of our supply of these artic
will cut o5 more than one hundred million
of our annual imports, besides largely increas
ing our exports. With such a picture, it is
ev to see how our large debt abroad is ulti
mately US be cxtinguibhed with a balance oi
trade against us, including interest on bondt
hold by foreigners and money shipment bj
our citizens traveling in foreign lands, equa.
to the entire yield of precious metals in this
country. It is not so easy to tee how thir
result is to be otherwise accomplished. The
acquisition ai San- Domingo is an adhesion to
the Monroe doctrine as a measure of national
protection. It is asserting our j ust claim to a
controlling influence of the great commercial
traibe soon to flow from west to east, by way
Of the Isthmus of Darien; it is to build up oui
merchant marine; it is to furnish new markets
tor the products of our farms, shops and man
ufactures; it is to settle the unhappy condition
of Cuba and end an exterminating conflict; it
to provide honest means of for paying oui
honest debts, without overtaxing the people;
is to furnish onr .citizens with the necessar
ies of everyday life, at cheaper rates than evei
before; and it is, in fine, a rapid stride toward
that greatness which the intelligence, indus
try and enterprise of the citizens of the United
States entitled this country to assume among
the nations. In view of the importance ol
this question, I earnestly urce ou Consrest
kearly action expressive of its views as to the
nest means oi acquiring ban Domingo, ily
suggestion that by Joint Resolution of the
two Houses of Congress the Executive be
authorized to appoint a Commission to nego
tiate for a treaty with the authorities of San
Domingo for the acquisition of that Island,
and that an appropriation be made to defray
expenses of such Commission. The question
may then be determined by action of the two
Houses oi CoDgress upon a resolution of an
nexation, as in the case of acquisition of Tex
as. So convinced am I of the advantages to
flow from the acquisition of San Domingo and
of the great disadvantages, I might almost
say, calamities, to flow from non-acquisition,
that I believe tk rjbiect has only to be inves
tigated to be approved.
It is to be regretted that our representation
in regard to injurious effects, especially npon
ths Kevenne of the United States, of the poli
cy of the Mexican Government in exempting
from import duties a large tract of its territory
on onr twraers, nave not only Deen iruitiess,
but that it is even proposed in that country
to extend the units vtnin which the pnvil
eye adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed.
The expediency of taking into your serious
consideration toe proper means ot countervail
ing the policy referred to will, it is presumed,
eniragtf your tamest attention. It u of vast
interest, especially to neighboring nations, to
provide against injury to those wlio may have
committed high crimes within their borders
and who may nave sougnt rciuge auroou.

would appear that the popular mind be
came possessed with the idea that this contest,
extending to Chineoe waters, would neutral
ize tha Christian influence and power, and
that the time was coming when the supersti
tious masses might expel all foreigners and
resore Msndarin influence. Anticipating
trouble from this cause, 1 invited France and
North Germany to make an authorized sus
pension of hostilities in the East, when they
were tetnporarilir suspended by an act of the
commanders, to act together for the future
protection in China of the lives and property
Americans and Europeans.
Since the adjournment of Congress, the
ratifications of the treaty with Great Britain
abolishing the mixed courts for the sup
pression of the slave trade, have been exchang

eodfiaed to the eastern coast of Africa, whence
slaves axe taken to Arabian markets.

I regret to say no conclusion has been
reached for the adjustment of the claims
against Great Britain, growing out of the
courso adopted by that Government during
uie reoemon. the Cabinet of London, so
fur as its views have been expressed, does
not appear to bo willing to concede that Her
aia,oiy s uovernment was guilty of negli
gence or did or permitted rt ,lnnit
tne war by which the United States had just
cause of complaint. Iam firm and unalter
able m the conviction directly the reverse.
1 therefore recommend to Congress to au
thorize the ap1)0intmeut of a commission to
take proof of the amounts and th e ownership
t it eu"nfla,m3 on notice the representative
-"j-,r nsmugion, and that au
thority be given for the settlement of these
cL ims by the United States; so that the Gov
ernment utiau nave the ownership of the pri
vate claims, as well as the responsible control
of all the demands against Great Britain. It
oinnotbe necessary to add, that wherever
Her Majesty s government shall entertain
desire for a full nnd friendly adjustment of
these churns, tho United States will enter on
their consideration with an earnest desire for
a conclusion consistent with the honor and
dignity of other nations.
The course pursued by tho Canadian au
thorities towards the fishermen of the United
States during the past season has not been
marked by a lneuOly leeiing. iiy the nrst
article of the convention of 1818, between
Great Britain and the United States, it was
a treed that . the inhabitants of the United
States should have in common the right of
taxing fish in certain waters therein defined
in the waters not included in tne limits nam
ed in the Convention within three miles of
parts of the British . coast It has been the
custom for ninny yesrs to give intruding fish
ermen of the United States a reasonable wam-
inn of violation ot the technical rights of Great
Britain. The Imperial Government is under
stood to have delegated the wnoie or a snare
ot its jurisdiction or control of these in shore
fishin" srronnds to the colonial authority,
known as the Dominion of Canada, and this
sem-independent, but irresponsible agent has
exercised its delegated powers in an unfriend
ly manner. Vessels havo been seized without
notice or warning in violation of the custom
previously provided, and have been taken in
to Colonial ports, their voyages broken up and
tne vessels condemned. 1 tiers is reason to
believe that this unfriendly and vexatious
treatment was designed to bear hardly npon
the hardy fishermen of the United States with
a view oi political enocc upon mis govern
ment The statutes of the Dominion of Can
ada assume a still broader and more untenable
jurisdiction over the vessels of the United
Mates. Tl.ey authorize officers or persons to
bring vessels havering within three miles of
any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of
Canada, into port; to search the cargo; to ex
amine the master on oath, touching the cargo
ana voyage; ano to inflict npon him a heavy
pecuniary penalty, if true answers are not
given; and if such vessel is found preparing
io fish within three marine miles of any of
such ooasts, bays, creeks or harbors without
a lioeuse or after the expiration of the period
named in the last license granted to it, they
proviue mat ine vessel witn fier tackle, dtc,
shall be forfeited. It is not known that an
condemnations have been made under this sta
tute. Should the authorities of Canada at
tempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to
uiKe sucn steps as may oe necessary to protect
the rights of the citizens of the United States.
It has been claimed by Her Majesty's ollicers,
that the fishing vessels of the United States
nave no right to enter the open ports of the
British possessions in North America, except
tor tne purposes oi sueiter anu repairing dam-
-tges, and ot purchasing wooa and obtaining
ater, that they have no right to enter at the
British custom booses or to trade, except the
purchase ot wood ana water, and tnat they
must depart within 21 hours notice to leave,
it is not known that any seizure of vessels
c irrying the flag of the United States has been
made under tins claim. Co lur as it is founded
on alleged construction Of the convention ol
IS-18, it cannot be acquiesced in by the United
States. It is hoped that it will not be insisted
on by Her Majesty's government During the
conference which preceded the negotiation ol
the Convention of 1818, the British Commis
sioners proposed to expressly exclude the fish
ermen of the United States from the privilege
of carrying on trade with any of His Hrittanic
Majesty e subjects residing wiuin the limits
assigned for their use; and also that it should
not be lawful fcr the United States engaged in
such fishery, to havo on board any goods,
wares or mercnandize- whatever, -except such
as may be necessary for tho prcsecuuon ot
their voyages to ana lrom saia nsning grounds,
and any vessels of the United States which
ohall contravene this regulation may be seized,
condemned and confiscated, with her charge.
This proposition, which is indentical with the
construction now put npon the language ol
the Convention, was emphatically rejected by
the American comniissoner, and therenpoi
was abandoned by the British I'ienipoten tones,
and article LL as it stands in the Convention,
was substituted. If, however, it be said that
this claim is founded on provincial or colonial
statutes, and not upon the Convention this
Government cannot but regard them as un
friendly and in contravention of the spirit, il
not of the letter, of the treaty, for the faithful
execution of which the Imperial Government
ib alone responsible. Anticipating that an at
tempt may possibly be made by the Canadian
authorities in Uu coming season to repeat
their unneihborly acts towards our fishermen,
I recommend you to confer npon theExecutive
the power to suspend by proclamation the
operation of the laws authorizing the transit
of goods, wares and merchandise in bond
across the territory of the United States to
Canada; and further, should such an extreme
measure beeome necessary, to suspend the
operation of any laws whereby the vessels ot
tne Dominion oi canaaa are permitted to en
ter the wathers of the United States.
A like unfriendly disposition has been man
ifested on the part of Canada, in the mainten
ance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens
of the United States from navigation of the
St Lawrence. This river constitutes a national
outlet to the ocean lor eight States, with an
aggregate papulation of 17,800,000 inhabitants,
and with an aggregate tonnage of 661,367,
tons upon the waters which discbarge into it
The foreign commerce of their ports on these
waters is open to British competition, and the
major part of it is done in British bottoms. Ii
the American seamen be excluded from' this
natural venue to the ocean, the monopoly of
the direct commerce of the lake ports with the
Atlantic would be in foreign hands, their ves
sels on trans-Atlantic voyages having an access
to our lake ports, which would be denied to
American vessel; on similar voyages. To
state such a proposition is to refute its claim to
justice. During the administration of Mr.
John Uuuicy Adams, Sir. Clay unquestionably
demon;rat-:-4 the natural right of the citizens
of the United States to the navigation of this
river, claiming that the act of the Congress of
Vienna in opening the Rhine and other
rivers to all nations showed that the judgment
of European jurists and statesmen that the
inhabitants of a country through which a nav
igable river passes have a natural right to
enjoy the navigation of that river to and into
the see- even though passing throueh the ter
ritory of another power. This right does not
exclude the co-equal right of tha sovereign
possessing the Territory through which the
rivor debouches into the sea to make such reg
ulation relative to the policy of the navigation
as may be necessary; bat those regulations
should be trained in uocrai spirit of comity,
and should not impose needless burdens on
the commerce which has the right of transit
It has been found in pract.ee more advantage
ous to arrange these regulations by mutual
agreement The United States are ready to
make any reasonable arrangement as to the
case of the St. Lawrence, which may be sug
gested by Great Britain. If the claim 01 ado
by Mr. Clay was just when tie population of
States bordring on the shores of the lakes was
only 3,400,0yd, it now deserves greater force
and equity from the increased lobulation,
wealth, production and tonnage of the States
on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay ad
vanced his argument in behalf of onr right,
the principle for which he contended has been
frequently and by various nations recognized
by law or by treaty; has been extended to
several other rivers. By the treaty concluded
at Mayence in lbiil, the Rhine was declared
free from the point where it is first navigable
into the sea. By tho Convention between
Spain and Portugal, concluded in 13S5, the
navigation of the Doursea throughout its
whole extent was made free for the subjects of
both crowns. In 1853, the Argentine Confed
eration bv treaty threw epeu ths full naviga
tion of the Parana and Uraguay to the mer
chant vessels of all nations. In lsi6 the Crim
ean war was closed by a treaty which provided
for the free navigation of the Danube. In
1S-38 Bolivia, by treaty, declared it regarded
the rivers Amazon and LaFlatte, in accordance
with fixed principles of national law, as high
ways of channels opened by nature for the
commerce of all nations. In 13-59 the Paraguay
was made free by treaty, aud in December,
1866, theEmperor of Brazilby Imperial decree,
declared the Amazon to be open to all the
frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships
of all nations. The greatest living British
authority on this subject, while asserting the
abstract right of the British claim, says : "It
seems difficult, to deny the Great Britain may
ground her refusal upon strict law, but it is as
equally difficult to dwiy, first that in so doing
she exercises harshly an extreme and bard law;
secondly, that her conduct with respect to the
navigation of the St Lawrence is in glaring
and discreditable inconsistency with her on
duct with respect to the navigation of the Mis
sissippi. On the grounds that she posessed a
small domain where' he Mississippi took its rise
she insi-ted on the right to navigate the
entire volume of its waters. On the ground
that she possesses both banks of the bt Law
rence, whore it disembogules itself into the
sea, she denies Uie United States the right of
navigation through about one-half of the
waters of lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron and Su
perior, and the whole of LakcMichigau.through
which the liver flows, are property of the
United States. The whole nation is interested

cares a greater return for their labor, to the
nation an increase iu the annual surplus of
wealth. It is hoped that the government of
Great Britain will ao the justice of abandon
ing the narrow and inconsistent claim to which
her Canadian provinces have urged hor adhe
rence. Our depressed commerce is a subject to
which I called your special attention at the
last session and suggested that we will in the
future have to look more t the countries
south of ns and to China and Japan for its re
vival. Our representatives to all these Gov
ernments have exerted their influence to en
courage trade between the United States and
the countries to which they are accredited;
but tha fact exists that the carrying is done
almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and while
this state of nftairs exists, we cannot control
our due share of the commerce of the world.
That between the Facitio Sta'es and China and
Japan is about all the carrying trade now con
ducted in American vesssels, I would recom
mend a liberal policy towards this line of
American steamers, one that will insure its
success and even increased influences. The
cost of building iron vessels, the only ones
that can compete with foroiirn ships, is so
much greater in the United States than in for
eign countries that without some assistance
from the government they cannot be success
fully built here. There will be several pro-
fjusiuuHs iaiu uciore uongress in tne course oi
the present session, looking to a remedy for
this evil. Even if it should be at some cost
to the national treaty, I hope such encourage
ment will bo given as wiU secure American
snipping on the high seas and American ship-
Duiiuing at nomc.
The condition of the archives at tho Denart-
ment of State, calls for the early action of
Congress. The building now rented by that
department is a frail structure, at inconveni

capacity to accommt date the archives, and is
"re prooi. its remote situation, its slender

nope of safety for either the building or its
contents, in case of the accident of a fire. Its
destruction would involvo the loss of th mil.

I recommend to your reconsideration the
propriety of tranferring to the Department of
toe interior, to wnicn tney seem more appro
priately to belong, all powers and duties in re
lation to the Territories, with which the
Department of State is now charged by law or
nsage; and from the Interior Department to
the War Department the Pension Bureau as
far as it regulates the payment of solders' pen

the pavment of naval pensions be transferred
to one of the Bureau of the Navy Department.

All agencies and superintendent-its r ot o antpoeed

in p eivil omeers. I d-termined to give all the
agencies to suh reli pious denominations as bad
heretofore established missionaries amonff the In
dians, andperhips to some other denominations
who would undertake the work nn the pamo terms
(i.e., as a miationary work), the societies selected
are allowed to name their own agents, subject to
the approval of the exet unye, and are expected to
watch over them and aid them as misaionaxies. to
Christianize and uvihze the Indian, and to trin
him in the arts of p-ace. The Govern" ent watch
es over the orft'ial acts of these agents and requires
of them as strict an aunouncabiiity as if they were
appointed in any otbur manner. I entertain the
confident bop that the poli y now pursued will in
few years bring all Indians upon reservation a,
where they will fite in houses, have school houses
and churencs; will be pursuing peaceful and self
sustaining avocations: and where they may be vis
ited by law, abiding white mtn with the same im-
