THE CALAMITIES OF THE PAST YEAR.
Tlie iinut year lias, under a wise IVovi

tlie nation. It lias however been nttend

OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS.
The relationn of the Ignited Slates

one it witnessing two great nations
peaking one language and having one
lineage, settling, by peaceful arbrii ration,
dinputes of lonir-standing, and liuble at
any time to bring those niilioriH into
bloody and hostile conflicts. An ex
ample has thus been set, which if biicccsh

other civilised nations ami be the final
means of returning to productive indus

treaty nlluded to, which has been con

FRANCE AND GERMANY.
between Franco and Germany has ena
bled me to give directions for the with
drawal of the protection extended to
German in France by the diplomatic
and c-tisuliir representatives of tlie Unit
ed State in that country. It is just to
add that the delicate duty of this protec
tion lias been pel twined tiy thu Al mister
and the Consul General at Paris and the
various Consuls iu France under the su
pervision of the latter with great kind
ness as will as with prudet.ee and tact.
Their course has received the commenda
tion of the German government and has
wounded no susceptibility of the French.
The government ot the Emperor of Gei
many continues to manilest a friendly
feeling toward the United Status and it
desire to l:iriti"iiizu w ith the moderate
and just policy which this government
maiiiiaius iu its relations with tlie Asiatic
owers, as well us with South American
lepublics. I have given assurance that
the lriendly feelings of that government
are fully bhared by the United Stales.

recognized the
TREATY WITH ITALY.
The inlitications of the new treaty
of commerce between the United Slates
and Italy have been exchanged. The
two powers have agreed in their treaty
that projicity ut sin shall be evjmpt from
capture lit case of war between lliu two
powers. The United Stales have spared
110 opportunity of incorporating this rule
into liiu obligations of iin'.iotis.
RELATIONS WITH SPAIN.
Forty- Congress at third
sessions made mi appropriation lor the
organization of a mixed Commission for
adjudicating upon the claim of dti.ens
of the United Stales against Spain, grow
ing out of the insurrection in Cuba.
That commission has since been organiz
ed, and I transmit herewith the cor
respondence relating to ila formation aud
its jurisdiction. It, is to ho hoped that
this coinmifcsioii will 11 lib id (he claimants
complete remedy for iheir injuries. It
has bieu madu the agreeable, duty of the
United Stales to preside over a confer
f'erente at Washington between the
Plenipotentiaries of Spain nnd the allied
South American Republic, which has re
sulted in nn armistice, with the reasona
ble assurance of u permanent peace.

NATIONAL DEBT.
The National Debt has been reduced
to the extent of eighty-six millions,
fifty seven thousand 0110 hundred and
twenty-six dollars mi I eighty cents dur
ing the year, and by tlio negotiation of
National bonds at a lower rale of inter
est, the interest on the public debt has
been so far diminished tl.ut now ihcsum
lo be raised for the interest account is
nearly seventeen million dollars lcssihau
ou thu first of March, 180!).
REDUCTION OF TAXES.
It wh highly desirable that this rapid
diminution should take place both to
strengthen the credit ot the country
nud to convince Us citizens of their
entire ubility to meet every dollar of lia
bility without bankrupting them, but in
view of the accomplishment of these de
sirable ends, of Ihe rapid development of
the resources ot the country, Us increas
ing ability to meet .birao demands, 11 ml
the amount already paid, it is not desira
ble that the present resoiiiee of thu
country bhottld bu taxed in order to
continue this rapid payment. I there
fore 11 commend u modification ol both
the tariff uud internal tax laws. I re
commend that all taxes lioin internal
sources bu abolished, except those en
spiriious, vinous nud uult liquors, to
bacco iu ils various forms & from stamps,
in re-adj usl ing the tariff, I suggest that
a careful estimate should be made of thu
amount ot surplus revenue collected un
der the present laws, after providing the
current expenses ot tne government, tho
interest uecouni nud a sinking fund, and
that this surplus bo reduced in such
milliner us to n fiord the greatest relief to
Ihe greatest number. There are many
articles not produced nl home, such as
medicines compounded, etc., from which
very little revenue is derived, but which
enters into general use. All Mich arti

Survey, and has completed the surveys au
thorized by Congress of the Isthmus of larien
and Tehuantepec, and under like nulhorily,
bus sent out an expedition completely furnish

of the service lo u peace standard, by the
gradual abolition of certain grades of officers,
and reduction of others, mid the employment
of some lu the service of the conimerciiil ma

thoughtful attention of Congress. I also re
commend that all promotions iu tlie. Nayy

THE KU KLUX LAW.
There has been Imposed upon the executive
branch of the Government the execution of
the uct of Congress approved April SOlh, 1871,
aud commonly know as thu Ku lClux law iu a
portion of tlie Stale of South Carolina. The
necessity of the course pursued ill be demon
strated by thu report of Ihu Committee lo in
vesilgale southern outrages. Under the pro
visions of Ihe above act, I issued a proclama
tion, calling tlie attention of the people of Ihe
Uniled Stales to the same, and declaring my
reluctance lo exercise any of tue extraordina
ry power thereby conferred upon me, except
lu ease of impiralivu uece.-sity, but making
known my purposu to exercise such power
whenever it should become necessary to do so
for the purpui-e of securing to all the citizens
of Ihu United Slates the peaceful enjoyment ol
all rights guaranteed lo iiiem by the Constitu
tion and the laws. Alter Ihu passage of this
law, information was received from lime to
lini", thai coiubiuatio.is of the character refer
red lo in this law, existed nnd were powerful
In many purls ol the Soul hern Stales, particu
larly in certain counties iu the Slate ut South
Carolina. Curetul investigation wus inu.lu,
and ll w ascertained that in nine counties of
that State such combinations were active uud
powerful, embracing a sufficient poll ion of
tliu citizens to coutrol the local authority and
havlug among oilier things thu object of de
priving the emancipated class of the substan
tial benefits of IreeUom nud, of preventing the
iree political action of those citizens w ho did
uot sympathize with thcli- own views. Among
their operations were frequent (.tourings of
thu country nud occasional assassinations
generally perpetrated ul night, by disguised
persons, the victims in ulmnol all cases being
citizens of different political sentiments from
their own, or free persons who hud shown a
disposition to claim equal rights with other
citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well
disposed citizens were 8 ill'jrer by this lawless
vloleuce. Thereupon, on the IU111 of October,
1871, a promaclation was issued, in the terms
of thu law, culling uuou the members of the

by them for can j ing out their unlawful pur

on the 17th of October, another proclamation
was issued, suspending Ihu writ of habeas
corpus' In nine counties in that Stute. Direc
tion wus given that l: thcc uiue couuties so
designated, persons supposed, upon creditable
Information, to be members of such unlawful
combinations, should be arrested by tbe mili
tary force of the United Slates, and delivered
to tho Marshal to bu dealt w ith according to
law. In two of the said counties, York and
Spartanburg, many urrests have been made.
At the lasl account, th mi in tier of persons
arrested was one hundred aud' sixty-eight.
Several hundred whose criiuinullity was as
cert'ilucd to be of an Interior degree, were ro
leasea for the present. These have generally
made confessions of their guilt. Ureal cautlou
has beeu exercised in making test arrests, and,

The propriety ol Congress passing nn enabl

THE INDIAN POLICY.
Tho policy pursued toward Iho Indians hns
resulted lavorably, so tar ns can be Judged
from the limited time during which it bus
beeu tn operation. Tlirough the exertions of
Ihu Various societies ot Christians, to whom
have beeu intrusted the execution of this poli
cy, and tho Hoard id' Commissioners author
ized by the law ot April 10th lHlit), many
tribes ol Indians have been induced to settle
upon reservations, to cultivate tlie soil nnd
perform productive labor of vurious kinds,
nnd to purlially accept civilization. They nru
being cared for iu such a way, il is hoped, ns to
induce those still pursuing their old habits of
lite to embrace the only opportunity w hich is
letl t hum lo avoid extermination. I recom
mend liberal appropriations to carrying out
tlie Indian peace jiolicy, not only because it is
humane, Chrisliiiu-liku aud economical, but
because it is right. 1 recommend to your fa
vorable consideration also, the policy grant
ing a territorial government to Indians in tho
Indian Territory west of Arkansas and Mis
souri and south of Kansas. Iu doing so, eve
ry rL'ht guaranteed to Indians by tieaty
should be secured. Such a course might in
time Imi the means of collecting most of the
Indians now between the Missouri aud hu
l'acilic and south of thu Brinish possessions,
into one Territory or one Stale. The Secreta
ry of the Interior hns tie.ited upon this subject
111 length, and I recommend to you his suggestions.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
renew my recommendation that the lic
Lnuds be regarded as a heritage to our
children, to bo disposed of only us required
for occupation and to actual settlers. Thosu
already granted have been in a great part dis
posed ol in such a way us to secure uccess to
thu balance by the hardy settler who may
w ish to uvail himself oi them. But caution
should be exercised even in obtaining so desir
able an object. Educational interest may well
be served by the grant of the proceeds of the
sale of pjiblic lands to setllers. I do uot wish
to be' understood as recommending iu the
least degree, a curtailment of w hat is being
done by ihe geueral government for the en
couragement ol education. The report of thu
Secretary of thu Interior, submitted with this,
will give you inlormiktiou collected aud pre
pared for publication, in regard to the census
taken during Ihe year 1870, Ihe operations of
tne iiureau 01 education lor the yeur, of the
patent office, the pension office, the laud office
and thu Indian Bureuu.
THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture gives .he operations of his D -pariment
for thu year. As agriculture is the ground
work of our prosperity, too much importance
cannot be attached to thu labors of this De
partment. It i:i iu tlie hands of an aide head,
w ith able assistants, all zealously devoted to
introd.icing into thu agricultural productions
of the nation nil useful inlornialiou as to the
method of cultivaliui; the plants nnd sen uls
and other products adapted to particular lo
calities. Quietly, but surely tho Agricultural
Bureau is working a ereat national enod. and
if liberally supported Ihu more widely its in
fluence will bu extended and the less dependent
we shall be upou the products ot foreign
countries.
INCREASED PAY TO OFFICIALS.
subject ol compensation to the heads ol
bureaus, and to officials holding positions of
responsibility, nnd requiring ability nnd char
acter lo tit tliem properly, is one to which
your attention is invited. But few of the offi
cials receive a compensation equal to the le
spectable support of n family, while their du
ties are such ns to Involve millions of dollars
of Interest. In private lite service demand
compensation equal to the services rendered,
and a w ise economy would djCstc thu same
ru le in" the Government service.
DECREASED EXPENDITURES.
have not iriven tho estimates for the sup
port of tho government lor the ensuing year,
nor the comparative statement between thu
expenditures lor the yeur just passed uud the
one just preceding, because ull these figures
tire contained in thu accompanying reporis or
111 tliose presented directly to Congress, iuese
estimates have my i.pproval.
THE QUETION OF DISABILITY.
More than six years have elapsed since the
last hostile guu was tired betw een the armies
then urrsyed against each other, tliu 0110 for
the perpetuation, Hie other for the dislruclion
of Ihe Union. It may' Well be considered
whether il is not now lime that thu (lisabilli
tii s imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment
slioulU not be removed. Unit Amendment
does not exclude from the ballot, but ouly es
tablishes ihe disability lo bold olllce ol cerium
classes. W hen the purity of the ballot Use
cure, majorities Hie sure to elect officers re
flecting the iiws of ihe majority. 1 do not
see the udvanlage or propriety of excluding
men from uflicu merely. They were, beforu
the rebellion, of standing mid character suffi
cient to lie elected to positions requiring them
to take 01 1 1 to support tne Constitution, uud
admitting lo tliuihility, those cnlcrliiinim; pre
cisely the same views, but of lets standing in
their coiuuiiiiiilics. 11 may be said (hat Hie
former violated nn oath w bite the latter did
lint. The hilar did not liuve il in their pow er
to dit to. If they had taken this oiilh it can
not be doubted they would have broken it us
did tho I'm incr cluss. If there lire imy ereal
criminals distinguished uhove nil others for
the part they touk in opposition lo the gov
ernment, they might, ill tue judgment of Con
gress, be excluded from sucli uu amnesty.
Thissubjcc.i is submitted for your careful consideration.
CONDITION OF SOUTHERN STATES.
The condition of the Son'heru Stales is. un
happily, not such as all true patriotic citizens
would liku to see. Social ostracism for opin
ion's suku personal violence or threats toward
persons entertaining political views opposed
lo these entertained by the majority of the old
citizens prevents Immigration, and thu flow of
much ueeded capital into the Stutes lately lu

of Improvement has beeu Inaugurated, by
which Washington is rapidly becoming a city
worthy of the Nation's capital. The citizens
of the District having votuutarily taxed them
selves te a large amount for ihe purpose of

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
It has bocn the aim of the Administration to
enforce honesty nnd efficiency lu ull public
offices. Kvery public servant who has violat
ed Ibe trust placed ill ll I ill Iihs been proceeded
against Willi ull the rigor of the law. If bad
men have seemed places, It has been tbo fault
of the system established by law and custom
for making npMinlments, or the fault ol those
who recommend lor government positions
persons not sufficiently well known to llieui
personally, or w ho give letters endorsing tho
character ot office seekers, without n proper
sense of tho grave responsibility which such
a course devolves upon Ihein. A civil servieo
relorm which can correct this abuse Is much
desired. In mercantile pursuits, thu business
men who give a letter of recommendation to
a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a
stranger, is regarded ns morally, n sponsible
for tlie integrity ol his friend, and his ability
lo meet his obligations. A reformatory law
which would euloree this principle against all
endorsers of persons for public places, would
ensure great eauiiou in making recommenda
tions. A salutary lesson has been taught Iho
careless nud the dishonest servants iu thu
great nuuiber ef prosecutions nud convictions
of the last two years. It is gratifying to no
tice tho fuvorablo change which is tuking
place throughout the country iu bringing to
punishment those who have proved recreant
to the trusts confided to thein,und Is elevating
to public olllce none but those who possess Ihu
couddence of the honest and virtuous, who, it
will always be found, comprise the majority
of the community iu which they live, lu my
message lo Congress one year ago, I urgently
recoinmtiided a relorm in Ihu Civil Service of
thu country, lu coulormily with that recom
mendation, Congress, iu the ninth sectiun of
su act making nn appropriation for sundry
civil expenses of the Government, and lor
olher purposes, approved March tliu 3rd, 1871,
gavu the necessary authority to the Executive
to inaugurate a civil service reform, uud plac
ed upou him the responsibility of doiug so.
Under authority of said net, I convened a
Board of gentlemen eminently qualified for
thu work, to devise rules and regulations to
effect tho needed reform. Their labors aru
uot yet completed, but it is believed that they
will succeed iu devising n plan which can be
adopted, Jo the great relief of the Executive,
the heads of departments nnd members of
Congress, aud which will redound to the true
interest of the public service. At nil events,
thu ahull have fair
CONCLUSION.
I have thus hastily summed up the opera
tions of the Government during the last year,
and made such suggestions ns occur to me to
be proper lor your consideration. 1 submit
them with a confidence that your combined
action will be wise, statesmanlike, and iu the
best interest of the whole country.
