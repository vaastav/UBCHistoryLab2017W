HARD AT WORK
The Legislature is Back at Its Task
Record of the Things Accomplished.
The Doe Bill Became Law.
Trustee Eill - Killed. Im
portant Public Hearings. I
After a brief rest the Legislature
reconvened again last week and the
members all came back full of turkey
and good resolutions. They took up
their work immediately and thus far
have proceeded with vigor in the hope
of reaching a final adjournment before
Christmas. One of the acts of public
interest was to take action toward
recalling-the now famous, "doe bill."
The senate passed the bill by one vote
just before tha Thanksgiving recess
and after seeing the storm of disap
proval raised by the people who hunt
only around the . library table, the
senators voted to recall thp bill from
the governor. In order to do this it
was necessary to ask the house of
representatives to return the bill to
the senate. The clerk of the house
called upon the governor for the bill
and wa3 informed that it would be
necessary for the house to pass a vote
asking for the bill. Now the house
had passed the bill early in the session
by a large majority and they knew
that the senate wanted to get the bill
back for the purpose of killing it.
Upon a yea and nay vote the house
refused to ask the governor for the
return of the bill. This action left
the bill wholly in the governor's power

Legislative Notes.
Orleans, Essex and Caledonia coun
ties took the leading parts in the tele
phone war created by the public utili
ties bills which were given a public
hearing last week. The leading mem
bers in favor of the bill were F. C.
Williams of Newport and O. T. Davis
of Brighton. The independent com
panies were represented by W. R. Al
drich of Barton Landing, Bert Moore
of Newport, Hugh Buchanan of Bar
ton Landing, H. B. Howe of St. Johns
bury and Manager Seeley of the Citi
zens' Telephone Co. of St. Johnsbury.
John W. Redmond, chairman of the
railroad commission, appeared for the
bill, having been requested to be pres
ent by the committee who gave the
hearing.
It is unfortunate that the telephone
war assumed such proportions a- this
time. It may become so bitter that
other legislation may be affected.
There has been so much talk about a
leader for the house that I have re-ida
many inquiries among the members as
to just who of all members was the
most influential in shaping or killing
legislation. Without exception the an
swer has been that honors were about
even between J. A. DeBoer of Mont
pelier and Harland B. Howe of St.
Johnsbury. It is indead a high complim
ent for a democrat to be recognized
as a leader in a strongly republican as
sembly. Late reports show that theycommit
tee on taxation will recommend the
passage of the bills creating a tax
commission, abolishing offsets and
placing a small direct tax on intangi
bles.
Senator Lewis of Orleans is easily
the most polished speaker in the
senate. He does not speak often but
when he does speak in support of a
bill the senate 'is treated to a master
piece. Senator Gleasbn made a fine fight on
the trustee bill and the woman's
suffrage bill and by his two victories
has gained considerable prestige in
the senate.

about the state house and there is no
dearth of hostile sentiment expressed
by the members. If they find out
who wrote it there may be something
doing besides legislation.
Senator Gibson has been missed dur
ing the week He is easily one of the
first three senators among the list of

One reason for the long session is
that the people of the state are tak

usual and are more inclined to hold
the members responsible for bad legis

propose to take their time and do the

COLBY STODDARD.
Ray Coomer of Greensboro, about 25
years of age, was shot and killed Sat
urday in the home of Levi Partridge,
one mile from Glover village. For
some time Coomer has been rather in
timate with Mrs. Partridge and his
attentions have been the cause of con
siderable trouble in the Partridge
family. Last July Partridge swore out
a warrant for Coomer on a statutory
charge and he was lodged in county
jail. Mrs. Partridge left home, but a
reconciliation was effected and Par
tridge gave bail for Coomer's release
and warned him to keep strictly awy.
Of late however his atter tions recame
more marked, and about 3 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon Partridge returned
from work in the field, and seting
Coomer's horse hitched outside, entered
he kitchen, finding Coomer and
his wife there. It is reported that
Coomer to leave the
but Coomer said he
wouldn't till he got good and ready,
whereupon Partridge entered a closet
off the kitchen,- took down his shotgun
and before Coomer realized what Par
tridge was doing he rf ceived a full
charge from the gun in the top of the
head, blowing the top part of the scalp
entirely off and killing Coomer in
stantly. Patridge then threatened to
kill himself with a revolver but was
kept from doing so by the entreaties
of his wife and a little Walcott c i'd
who was living there. Busweil Leon
ard of Glcver happened to be pass
ing and was called in. Selectman A.
C. Phillips was notified, and he and
Constable A. G. Sargent arrested Par
tridge and turned him over to State s
Attorney W. M. Wright of Barton.
Partridge was locked up in the police
station at Barton Saturday night aud
was taken to Newport Sunday.
A hearing in the case was held on
Monday evening at the court-house in
Newport before Municipal Judge H.
B. Cushman, Attorney-General John
G. Sargent of Ludlow and State's At
torney W. M. Wright appearing for the
state and E. A. Cook" and Frank
Thompson for the respondent. The
hearing occupied the time till nearly
11 o'clock p. m.t when an adjourn
ment was taken till yesterday morning
for its completion. Judge Cushman
took the case under advisement, and
later bound the respondent Partridge
over in the sum of $5000 on a charge of
murder in the second degree. The
general opinion of those who are more
or less acquainted with the facts seems
to be that Partridge's crime was com
mitted after great provocation and
that he will have little trouble in get
ting bondsmen.
The Fletcher Lecture.
The lecture last evening by Thomas
Brooks Fletcher on "The Martyrdom
of Fools" was pronounced by all one
of the "best ever" in tha Barton lec
tuie course. Some thought it the
best, many among the very best, and
no one had ever a criticism for the
lecturer or the lecture. It wa3 not
profound enough to be unentertaining:
and not eiitertaining enough to be
frivolous. The truths spoken were
burning truths and were put in lan
guage and gesture that held the audi
ence as few lecturers here have done.
Mr. Fletcher is a marked orator and
while Barton has heard the best on the
platform, Conwell, Hedley, Burdette.
Gunsaulus arid others, this Fletcher
whom most of us had never before
heard cf will undoubtedly find a warm
welcome in cur lecture course progam.
He is both dramatic and humorous, and
convinces his audience with his elo
quence. His audience was first roaring:
with laughter and then so still that
not a single sound was heard while he
brought them to a climax in his
message. He paid a public tribute to
the people of this community on their
patronage of the leeture where thodght
was required, stating that in most
but the cheap entertainments found
crowded houses. He later in private
towns of this size lectures were shunned
paid this compliment to the town even
stronger than he did in public. A
reappearance of Mr. Fletcher will draw
a crowded house. The next entertain
ment in the courss is January 11 when
that peerless lecturer, George Wood
Anderson, will take for his subject.

fail to hear him if you miss all the rest

BROWNINGTON.
Last Wednesday there was carried
to his last resting place one of Brown
intrton's oldest residents, Samuel
Stone Tinkham. who was born in Cor
nish, N. H.. April 7, 1818. He was the
son of Peter and farthena Tinkham.
When about 10 years of age he went
to live with an uncle at Windsor. La
ter on in about 1838, he moved to a
farm in Rochester with his father.
On February 3, 1848, he married Miss
Clara Richmond, who died November
2 1895. Mr. Tinkham was an excel
lent citizen, a good and faithful friend,
nrl q kind and helDtul neichbor. G
was a roan of strong convictions, fear
Ipss in the advocacy of the right,
Invnl to the truth, and ever walked in
t.he streneth of his might in the fear
nf tho Lord. When but 16 years of
Partridge is about 35 years of age
and his wife is somewhat younger.
Mrs. Partridge was formerly Mrs. '
May Sykes and for some time previous
to her marriage four years ago she
wa3 employed at the Peerless factory
at Barton. Partridge is practically
alone in the world, his parents having
died some years ago. Coomer's repu
tation was not of the best. For a time
he was employed at the hotel in
Greensboro Bend, but lately has been
a farmhand. He had been employed
by Partridge at various times, but
since the July arrest Partridge had
watched him more closely. No one
save the wife and the three-year-old
child witnessed the tragedy and many
conflicting stories are afloat, but as
near as ootamaoie me i acts are as
here given. People who know ex
isting circumstances express no partic
ular surprise at the tragedy, saying
that Partridge has been greatly ag
gravated by Coomer and that Coomer,
who is a muscular fellow and a fighter,
had once thhrashed Partridge and that

in the community. Mrs. Cartridge is
said to admit that she was the cause of
the trouble between the two men.

Business Prospects Fine for Barton.
With the announcement by the tub
shop that they have recently landed an
order or $80,000 worth of tubs to be
made the coming year, a sufficient or
der to keep the shop running at its
fullest capacity for twelve months, and
the announcement by PilJsbu.y Sc.
Baldwin that they will increase their
number of men on January 1 from 20
to 40 makes the business outlook Tor
Barton the coming year particularly
bright. Other branches of industrj
promise plenty of work and building
operations the coming year would indi
cate plenty of employment and busy
times are looked forward to.
