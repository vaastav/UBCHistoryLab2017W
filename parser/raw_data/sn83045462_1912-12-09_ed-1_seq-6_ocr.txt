Bepublicans and Progressives.
Walt a tittle. Such is the adjuration
of all the republican leaders and some
of the progressive leaders as to activity
looking to the rehabilitation of opposition
to the democratic party.
The advice is good. Although on the
eve of taking full control of the government,
the democratic party is not itself
now united. The union effected disappeared
after election day. Already, on j
matters relating to legislation, there are j
several kinds of democrats, and on mat- j
ters relating to patronage there are fac- '
lions gaiore.
Why not give this commotion time to
v ork? With a little time the democratic
party may do for the opposition what
the opposition in the recent campaign
did for it?divide angrily, and render itself
impotent.
There is a large order in hand. Region
of the tariff, a firmer grip on the
trusts, and reform of the currency await
action. Action has been promised, and
the country expects the promise to he
kept. Soon after inauguration day the
?i heels will begin to turn, and then there
should be some sign as to whether the
p. ople have taken the democracy for bet
:?-r or for worse. If for worse, then tne
opposition will have something definite to
go on.
All successful politics is conceived and
? \ecuted in the spirit of compromise. Give
a iittle. take a little- No leader, no fact:<
n. ever gets the full measure of desire.
T. e leader, or faction, striking an attitude.
with the exclamation, "This, or
nothing." usually gets nothing. That is
no; politics: and politics is the essence
< f government.
l or tho opposition, the question Is of
issues, not of numbers. Neither the republican
leaders nor the progressive leaders
can afford the position taken by the
captain of a company of guerrillas in the
time of the civil war. The story, as told
by the Danville, Ky., Advocate. Is that
this captain at the head of a company of
men when informed that the enemy,
numbering oOO, was approaching said:
"Weil, boys, we'll look 'em over, and if
we can't lick 'em. we'll jine 'em."
If there is to be effective union against
the democracy for control, first of Congress
and then of the presidency, it
must be on issues of national moment.
Mere office-seeking will not favorably
impress the country. Mere hero worship,
protracted through two or four
years, will pall on the country. If the
democracy succeeds with its present commission
it will succeed Itself. If it fails,
it should be succeeded by a party united
on a program of progress laid on constitutional
lines.
The New York apartment house owner
who changed the name of the building
w hich in an hour of admiring enthusiasm
he had christened "the Roosevelt"
has set an impractical example. If all

The problem of the "useful and appropriate
Christmas gift" is at present more
absorbing than even the questions of
tariff and currency.
it may be that Gov. Blease's heart is

The Bedfield Committee Report.
Good results ought to come from the
report of the Rtdheid subcommittee,
whtch has Just laid before the House of
Representatives its findings following a
long, exhaustive inquiry Into the business
methods and purchasing systems of
the District government. Considering
the scope of the investigation and the
length of time that it has occupied, it is
gratifying to find that no serious fault Is
discovered in the municipal organization
with respect to the purchase of materials
and equipment- The criticisms that are
given expression In the report are by no
means of a serious nature, and the subcommittee
manifests a gratifying disposition
to place the blame where, In large
measure, it belongs, with the appropriaW?V1~
k-n A. A - _
nun inns, which iau 10 mtei me requirements
of the District municipal system.
The most serious objection expressed by
the report Is as to the Commissioners'
method of purchasing fire hose, which appears
to have favored a certain corporation.
but without loss of money or value
to the District. Indeed, there Is no suggestion
that If favoritism has been shown
it has resulted to the Injury of the local
treasury or to the deterioration of the
equipment.
It Ir to be doubted If such a sharp
rutJny could be applied to the business
affairs of any other community In tlrls
country with the same results. It h^
ong been the boast of Washington lans
that they have a local government without
?raft- They have had no occasion to
question this, although from time to time
questions have been raised by critics of
the District administration. Whenever a
test has been, applied it has been found
that a high standard of official integrity
has been maintained. The checks and
balances which operate hers suffice to
^ prevent the development of a corrupt
system, while the nearness ef Congress,
to which the District administrators are
directly responsible, renders possible at
all times a survey of local conditions.
The District 1s. In short, under Incessant
scrutiny. In effect Its government is Investigated
at least ?.nce a year. as Its
representatives appear before the appropriations
committees, not merely to explain
their estimates, but to aaswsr Inquisitorial
questions of a searching nature.
As a result of these continual lnouirles
Into the state of local affairs, not
only is a high standard of official par* j
formance maintained, but public confluence
in the integrity of the local gov- j
eminent la preserved and strengthened.
This painstaking inquiry into the business
affairs of the District should lead to
action by Congress to remedy such faults
as are attributable to the lack of sufficient
appropriations or to defects of organic
legislation. For example, the high cost

subcommittee in large part to the continued
use of the small school building,
and in other part to the inadequacy of the
business administration < f the schools due
to small appropriations. Both of these
defects can be cured if Congress will
adopt the proper policy toward the District
with reference to its educational
appropriations. Attention has been urged
along these lines heretofore by District
authorities, and the responsibility for the
condition which the subcommittee has
found to exist cannot be laid solely or
' . *v ;;t the doors of local afflcials.
The Government as a Business.
In the course of his statement before
the House appropriations subcommittee
in charge of the "legislative" appropriation
bill, explanatory of the estimates for
the civil service commission. Gen. John
C. Black, president of the commission, in
reply to a question by a member of the
committee, stated that there are now under
the employ of the government of the
United States, excluding officers and enlisted
men in the Army, Navy and Marine
Corps, 400,528 persons. This figure should
be studied, with reference to the proposition
to place the employes of the government
on the basis of permanency of
tenure, with an assurance of some form
of old-age provision to prevent them' from
suffering from the effects of superannuation
without relief from active duty.
Here is a business establishment enlisting
the services of nearly half a million
people. Probably 400.000 of them?a
low estimate?are in minor grades of the
service, occupying subordinate positions
of a more or less technical character and
calling for some degree of training. It
would seem to be a natural desire on the
part of those charged with responsibility
for the conduct of this great institution
to seek the most businesslike plan to promote
efficiency. Yet so strong is the
habit of regarding public position as patronage
or political spoils that It 19 apparently
impossible for many legislators
to consider this as a business proposition.
They cannot grasp the concept of the
government as a working corporation.
They agree readily to the proposition
generally that it pays an employer to
make some sort of provision for his elder
workers, either by appropriating a retirement
fund out of his own revenues or requiring
his employes to provide thus for
themselves or by combining the two
methods. They do not deny that such an
arrangement makes for a higher grade of
workmanship and better conditions generally,
and yet when it is suggested that
the government undertake some such
means of preventing the congestion f the
rankg through the retention of the elder
workers from a feeling of charity and
out of recognition for loyalty, they attempt
to differentiate between the two
classes of business.
There is no actual difference between
public and private workers in regard to
their needs- There is no difference between
them s to their potential efficiency.
There is no difference with reference
to the desirability of retaining the
experienced and thus setting a premium
upon continuous service. None of those
who, now sitting in Congress are opposed
to the idea of departmental retirement
would, in their own business affairs,
think of changing their forces periodically
for the mere sake of changing or to
reward political friends. Most of them, if
working on a large scale, would try to
hold their employes in service by assuring
them of gradual promotions and ultimate
retirement. But when it comes to
dealing with other people's business a
different Idea prevails.
Yet is not the government the immediate
personal affair of every citizen? It
is surely the affair of representatives and
senators who have been formally chosen
by the people to represent them in its
management. They are sitting at the
Capitol virtually as the board of directors
of a corp ration, and they should regard
this matter of provision for the elder
government workers precisely as do the
men who have been selected by the stockholders
of a company to manage its affairs.
Thomas Jefferson's well known fondness

Officers and Foreign Criticism.
German sensitiveness over criticisms by
American army and naval officers will
pass Into tradition. On one occasion, a
few years ago. one of the higher naval
officers of this country set the father
iana by the ears by reciting on a public
occasion a poem which satirized the
egotism of-the kaiser. The matter became
the subject of official complaint and
the officer was admonished that his conduct
was not altogether commendable and,
indeed, that it verged upon Impropriety.
The humor of the situation saved It from
becoming a cause of serious strain In the
relations between the United States and
Oermany. Now another case arises, an
officer of the army publishing in a service
journal a poem ridiculing the German
military Instructors who have been training
the Turkish army, and whose work
proves to have been fruitless. The poem
appeals strongly to anti-German sentiment
and consequently has aroused considerable
feeling In that country. Representations
to the State and War departments
may be officially made, in
which case doubtless Uncle Sam will hold
up his linger at the author of the obnoxious
lines.
Officers of the army and navy should be
exceedingly circumspect In their public
utterances and writings. They are never
Inseparable from the government whose
uniform they wear. Whatever they say
or write must necessarily reflect upon the
national organization, and it Is rather too
dangerous a game to play to Indulge In
satire in public at the expense of a foreign
power. If an officer Iq possessed of
an inspiration to write a; cettlcism of
another government, by innuendo or by
direct expression, he should be content
with anonymity. The publication of his
production over his signature and title
is a challenge that cannot be overlooked
by the aggrieved authorities. If a satirical
poem can be permitted to pass unrebuked,
officers of this country's military
and naval forces may go to any lengths
in the criticism of other governments and
diplomacy will have Its hands full keeping
the peace. It behooves this governI
mi nt to make it plain to all those that
I o?a Qorvipo that tH<*V pflnnot
trifle with the sensibilities of foreign powers,
and doubtless in the present instance
the author of the objectionable poem will
be admonished that he has gone beyond
the line of propriety in his bit of literary
enterprise.
Experience has shown that it is not
absolutely necessary to make especial
arrangements to secure the advice of an
ex-President on matters of national concern.

SHOOTING STABS.
BY PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Determined to Be Observed.
"You may announce that I Intend to
retire to private life," said-the industrious
statesman.
"What for?"
"It seems to be the only method just
now by which I can attract public attention."
Another curious custom of the time is
that of putting a few seats in a street
car in order to enable a few passengers
to gloat over Ihe grea't majority who are
swinging to straps.
The Modern Grandma.
When grandmas danced the minuet
Prom formal grace they'd never slip.
Now grandma smokes a cigarette
And tries to dance the chicken flip.
Uninterested.
"I have made a great discovery," said
the scientist. "I am prepared to prove
that angleworms think." '
"You're wasting time," replied the ward
boss. "What difference does it make
what an angleworm thinks? He can't
vote."
Safe.
"You know a lot of people are saying
that your work is plagiarism," said the
unpleasant friend.
"What of it?" asked Mr. Sellingham
Quick. "The kind of readers our Arm
publishes for are not going to bother to
look in the dictionary to see what 'plagiarism'
means."
A Delinquent.
"I suppose you are among the early
shoppers," said the man of genial holiday
mood.
"No," replied Mr. Meekton. "I am
away behindhand. I haven't yet caught
up with the shopping my wife expected
me to do for last Christmas."
Polite Prophecy.
The weather let us now foretell
In language all exact;
We'll undertake to do it well
Unhindered by mere fact.
A sky of bright translucent blue.
Where sunbeams lightly, play.
And bid the branches smile anew
With blossoming so gay.
A shower of diamonds in each wave
That dances to the shore,
A robin song, resounding brave,
Across the grove once more.
A balmy south wind to awake
To joy each slumbering arch?
And all besides, you'll need to make
A perfect fourth of March.
The Needs of the Navy.
From the New York Times.
Three battleships of the dreadnought
class, two battle cruisers, sixteen torpedoboat
destroyers, six submarines and
a number of smaller vessels are needed
in the coming year to keep our navy in
its relative position among the navies of
the world, according to the annual report
of Secretary Meyer. The Secretary's
recommendations are approved by President
Taft in his message. Provisions for
four battleships were asked for by the
iranitral naval hnaril Th? Socratarv 11m
its his estimates to three. Only one was
provided for this year, and four of the
thirty-three now in our fleet will be
twenty years old In 1914. It is a policy
of foolish economy to restrict the unbuilding
of the navy. "The time is remote"
says the Secretary, "when a comparatively
unarmed and helpless nation
may be reasonably safe from attack by
ambitious, well armed powers, especially
I in a commercial age such as the present."
Sweatshop Dangers.
From the New York World.
At a thousand points the sweatshop
work of the tenements touches the lives
of the more fortunate with a threat A
woman sits working at willow plumes
I with a board of health diphtheria notice
on her door. Tuberculosis is a common,
typhoid an occasional, visitant In the
stifling rooms where dolls are dressed, or
nut meats picked out for Christmas
1 dainties, or plumes willowed, or embroideiles
stitched. In one poor home Dr.
| Anna S. Daniels tells how a child lay
dyilng of infantile paralysis, her mother
unable to attend to her. The woman
had to work. One employing contractor
told the commission how his own child
had died of a disease brought back from
a tenement workroom In Infected merchandise.
Queer College Professors.
From the Boston Transcript.
Even If we make charitable allowance
for inaccurate reporting, it seems true,
nevertheless. that there are a good many
queer college professors running at large.
Schools come In for criticism from one
of these professors for not doing what
the home should accomplish. Another
professor has Just been heckled by his
Philadelphia audience for advising worklng
girls to spend their money on clothes
in order to make better marriages, their
families to benefit from the prosperity
of the husband. There is some reason
for thinking that after all the absence
of such professors on their travels from
their classroom is not greatly to the disadvantage
of their students.
Church Consolidation.
From the Chicago Pest.
Chicago welcomes the echolare and
preach ere who are here working toward
the end of "co-operation of the Protectant
ohurchea." The length of the step they
have taken is not very great, but the direction
in which they are going gives ua
the hope that the work of co-operation
will some day become the work of consolidation.
