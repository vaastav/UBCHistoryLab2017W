ar.nual Message of the President of
Ccited States to the two bouses of
Coflfrefw is printed in this morning's In
(t,.;u?Ni?i:. It ifl a very satisfactory
document. A careful reading, we are
?iw, *?!? convince our readers thst it is
iu 1 exhaustive, and as to both the
utfi contained in it and the manner of!
&eit exprewion, will compare without
jjyardtfeuieut with most former Presi
isotiil nieces. Iudeed, few mee
have exhibited the same
? fb degree of statesmanship as this
one. The remarks in regard to the past
olence and present frauds in elections in
south have tho riirht ring, and yet are
x iach a dispassionate vein as to com
s-nd them to thoughtful men of all par
Hid recommendations in regard to
education ol the masses, though trite,
psrbipa. aro timely and appropriate
tfoojh, and gain new force from their
yre-en: connection.
Tiiepsrt of the message devoted to the
onaideration of "Civil Service Re
jjra)" is worthy of special attention.
i disposition has been shown by
itveral papers ol Democratic prociivi
rrt t0 retsr to the fact that this topic is
fives so much attention at this time as
ifllurtuniitu for the Administration. These
remarks, based upon the brief synopsis of
?ieMenage heretofore given to the press,
se any force they may have seemed to
poafis when the words of the President
ire at baud. The plan proposed as a
itfia# oi .securing reforms which it is
ttaem'.lv agreed are desirable, if not
BH-ttsary, is worthy of the weighty con
lideratiou of Uougress and the country,
icdtiiH explanation of the partial failure
ol reforms heretofore attempted, is entitled
to attention.
la n gird to the bold and unblushing
tioUiim of the laws of morality 3nd de
<?aey practiced by an isolated people in
the A'e.n under the guise o! religion, the
P;aident also makes some suggestions
of a nature to arrest attention and projroke
dbctueion. That the polygamous prac*
the Morur.ms are a.reproach to the
rati::i and a disgrace to the age few. per
fjoa ciu b<? found outside of Utah to
itdv. Tii.tt there has bmm no persistent
ttfjrt to slanjp out the evil must be re
garded as the reverse of creditable to the
tiweromeut, aud thn plan proposed by
President Hayes should be welcomed, and
it hand to be wise and practicable, put
iaw operation.
The review oi our foreign relations con
taiaaianch reason f?r congratulation, and
?}taefi'i-e for anxiety. There eeems to
no reason, however, to apprehend any
reaaiu bat thosa niont acceptable to this
ouatrv. from pending negotiations in re
gsrd to the fisheries dillicolties, tho Pana
ma canal project, or tho recent discourte
liesto American vessels by .Spanish sea
tteo. l'ne consideration of the needs of
oirforeiirn commerce is fraught with in-1
tereat to public-spirited men, and will no j
doubt receive that reception at the hands
ol Congress which the magnitude
of the interests concerned demands.
The financial part of the paper has aUeady
been forecast in our columns by the pub
lication of the reports of different officials
the Treaeury Department. We may
repeat, however, that the showing
made is most creditable, and must
fee a source of considerable satis
faction to partisans of Hayes's ad
ministration. The recommendations in re*
<aru to the coinage of silver are not to be
lightly dismissed.
Ihe President emphasizes the reco'm-|
meatUtioas of Generals Shetman and
Sheridan in relation to the adoption of a
new policy for the conduct of our mili
ary affairs, and also those of the Secre
tary of the Navy concerning that Depart
ment of the public service. The state
ments about the two great rivers of the
continent, and the recommendations in ?
regard to their improvement, will
commend themselves to our ?ead
era as containing more than
oanal interest to residents of the Ohio
Valley. Tho complimentary allusion to
Ueueral Grant, and tho suggestion for
bin future, is manly and appropriate, and
will commend the message to many who
uiiijht otherwise be disposed to regard it
with less favor. The review of Indian
affairs, the workings of tho Agricultural
Bureau, the Public lands Commission and
other minor branches of the government,
make up an fjyxMi of the situation of onr
public iuterests, which is singularly free
from causes of uneasiness, and fruitful of
felicity for those who have the well-being
of oar country close at heart.

Fdlotc-CUisau of Oir SniaU and IIoiw of
Rqmtentaivtt:
I congratulate you on the continued
and increasing prosperity of our country.
By the favor of Divine Providence we
have bean blessed, during the past year,
witb bealtb, with abundant harvests, with
profitable employment for oil our people,
and with contentment at home, and with
peace and friendship with other nations.
?TKe. occurrence of tbe twenty*fourth
electron of Chief Magistrate has afforded
?ncrther opportunity to the people of-the
United States to exhibit to the world a
significant example of the peaceful and
safe transmission of the power and
authority of government from the
public servants whose terms of office are
about to expire, to Iheir newly-chosen
successors. This example cannot fail to
impress profoundly thoughtful people of
other countries with the advantages
which republican institutions afford. Tbe
inynediate, general and cheerful acquies
cence of all good citizens in tbe result of
tbe election, gives gratifying assurance to
our country, and to its friends through
out the world, that a government based
onftbtfree consent of an intelligent and
patriotic people possesses , elements of
strerigtb, stability and permanency not
found in any other form of government.
Continued opposition to the full and
free enjoyment of the rights of citizen
ship, conferred upon the colored people
by the recent amendments to the Consti
tution, still prevails in several of the
slaveholding States. It has, perhaps, no'
been manitested in the recent election to
any large extent in acts of violence or in
timid^tiqn. It has, however, !?y fraudu
lent practices in connection with the bal
lot"', with the regulations as in the places
and manner of voting, and with counting,
returning, amf canvar-sing the votes cast,
been successful m defeating *he ?xeYcfoe
of tbe rigbr preservative ot a'-l rghtr, the
right of fcutTrjge, which the Couytituiion
expressly confers upon .our enfranchised
citizens.
- . SECriOXAI.HSI ANli ITS KIN DUE0 EVUJ.
Tt is the desire of the good people of the
whole country that sectionalism as a factor
in pur politics should disappear. They
profffr that no secticu of the country
should be united in solid opposition to
any other section. The disposition tore
fuse a prompt and hearty obedience to
the equal rights amendments 10 the Con
stitution, is all that now stands in tne way
of a,complete ? obliteration of sectional
lines in'V>ur political contest!!. ATlong as
either of these amendments is Ihgrantly
violated or disregarded, it is safe to As
sume that the people who placed them in.
the Constitution, as embodying the legiti
mate results of the war for the llninn, and
who believe them to be wise and neces
sary, will continue to* act together, and to
insist that they shall bte obeyed. The
paramount question still is,as to the enjoy
ment of the right by every American citi
zen who has the requisite qualifications,
to freely cast his vote and to have it hon.
estlv counted. With this question rightly
settled, the country will be relieved of the
contentiona.pl the past; bygones will in
deed 1* bygones; and political attt party
?refnes with respect to economy and effi
ciency of administration, internal im
provements, the tariff, domestic taxation,
education, tinance, and other important
subjects, will then receive their full ahare
of attention; hue resistance to and nullifi
cation of the results of the war, will unite
tcgather in resolute purpose for their sup
port all who maintain the authority of the
tfovernmtot and the perpetuity of the
Unfon, and who adequately appreciate the |
value of the victory achieved. This de
termination proceeds from no hostile sea.
timent cr feeling to any part of the people
of our country, or to any of their interests.
The inviolability of the amendments rests
upon the fundamental principle of our
Government. They are the solemn ex
pression of the will .of the people of the
United States.
The sentiment that the constitutional
xighta of all our citizens must be main
tained does not grow weaker. It will con
tinue to control the Government of the
country. Happily, the hiitory of the late
election shows that in many parts of the
countrv whore opposition to the Fifteenth
Amendment h*s heretofore prevailed it is
diminishing, and is lifceiy to caaae alto
gether, if firm and well-considered action
is taken by Congress. 1 trust the House
of. Representatives and the Senate, which
have the right to judge of the elections,
returns and qualifications of their own
members, will see to It that every oaf* of
violation of the letter or spirit of the
Fifteenth Amendment is thoroughly In
vestigated, and that no benefit from such
violation shall accrue to any person or
party. It wijl be the duty of the Execu
tive, with sufficient appropriations for the
purpose, to prosecute unsparingly all who
have been engaged in depriving citUsnsp(
the righta guaranteed to them by the Con
stitution.
POPULAR IDt'CATIOS. ~
It is not, however, to be forgotten that
the kest and surest guarantee of the pri
mary rights of citizenship is to be found
in that capacity for celf-protectiou which
can belong only to a people whose right to
nnivereai suffrage is supported by univer
sal education. The means at the com
mand of the local and state authorities are,
in many cases, wholly inadequate to fur
nish Tree Intimation to all who need it.
TbU is especially true where, before eman
cipation, the edncationo/ th? people was
neglected or prevented, in the interest* of
slavery. Firmly convinced that the sub
ject of popular education deserves the
earnest attention of the people of the!
| whole country, with a view to wise and
comprehensive action by the Government
of the United States, I respectfully re
comuosd that Congress, by suitable legis
lation and wUb proper safeguards, supple
ment the local educational funds in the
several states where the grave duties and
responsibilities of citizenship have been
dieted on uneducated people, by devot
ing to the purpose grants of the public
land*, and, if necessary, by appropriations
from the Treasury of the United btatea.
Whatever the Government can fairly do to
promote free popular education ought to
be done. Wherever general education is
found, peace, virtue and social order pre
vail. sod civil and religious liberty are
secure.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
In my former annual messages I have
asked the attention of Congress to the ur
gent necessity of a reformation of the
elvti-aerviee system of the government
My viewe ?ou^rning the dangers of pat
ronage, or appointments for personal 01
partisan considerations, b/w* Leer
strengthened by my observation anxf c*
jxerience in the Executive office, and I be
lieve these dangers threaten the stability
of the Government. Abuses so serious in
their nature cannot be permanently tol
erated. They tend to become more alarm
ing with the enlargement of administra
tive service, as the growth of the country
in population increases the number of oiii
oera and placemen employed. i *
The reasobsarelmperitfvf fortheidop.
tlo'n of flx?d ru!<8 for tne regulation nfat>
pointments, promotions and removals, es
tablishing a uniform method, having ex
clusively in view, in every instance, the
attainment of the best qualifications for
the position in question. Such a method
alone is consistent with the equal right* of
all citizens, and the most economical and
efficient administration of the public busi
ness. ....
Competitive examinations, in aid of iin
partial appoiirtfientH and""ptoinotions,"
nave been conducted for ijome years
in several of the Executive Departments,
and by my direction this system hr.s been
adopted in the custom-houses and pOBt
odices of the larger cities of the countrv.
In the city of New York over (wp thou
sand positions in tW civfl-setviee have
been subject, in their appointments and
tenure ot place, to the operation of pub
lished rules for this purpobe, during the
past two years. The results of these prac
tical trials have been very satisfactory,
and have continued inv opinion in favor
of tbis system of selection. All are sub
jected to the same tests, and the result la
tree from prejudice by personal favor or
partisan influence. It secures for the po
sition applied for the best qualitications
attainable amoDg the competing appli
cant* > It. ia an elfectuaf promotion^rom
Ihe prapfbie^importjjnity jradr rj
any other course pursued, largely exacts
the time and attention of app?inting ofli
cers, to their great detriment in the dis
charge of other official duties, preventing
the abnse of the service for the mere fur
therance of private or party purposes, and
leaving the employee of the Government,
freed from the obligations imposed bv pat
ronage, to depend solely upon merit for re
tention arid didvar?*m$m, andjwith this
constant incentive to exertion and im
provement.
These invaluable results have been at
aiued in a high degree in the Mfices where
:ho rules for appointment by competitive
jxamination have-ijeen applied.
A mfethod^btek-has stf'appfQvedinelf
?v experimentaUeata at points wherubuch
ests may be fairly coneidered conclusive,
f'nould be extended to all subordinate po
rtions under the Government. I believe
hat a strong and growing public senti
ment demands immediate measuies for
lecuring and enforcing tbe highest possi
ble efficiency in the civftiervice, .and Jts
wotectjoi^^on^eccgtnyd abuses, .4ld
.hat the experience referred to Las ue
nonstrated the feasibility of such meas
ures.
? The examinations in the custom houses
ind post offices have .been held oflder
many embarrassments and without pro
vision for compensation for tbe extra la
bor performed by the officers who have
conducted them, "and jvhoeo commendable
interest in the improvement of tho public
service has induced this devotion of time
ind labor without pecuniary reward. A
continuance of these lal>ora gratuitously
aught not to bo expected, and without an
appropriation By Congress for'compensa
tion, it is not practicable- to extend the
system of examinations generally through
out the civil service. It is also highly im
portant that all such examinations should
be conducted upon a uniform system and
under general supervision. Section 17">3
of the Revised Statutes authorizes the
President l,n?prescribe the regulations for
Admission to the civil service of the L'nited
States, and for this purpose to employ suit
able persons to conduct the requisite in
quiries with reference to "the fitness of
each candidate, in respect to age, health,
character, knowledge, and ability, for the
branch oi service into ,which he seeks to]
enter;" buf the law is pjacticallv inopipra-1
Uve for gant of.the^^uisitg appropria
tion.
I therefore recommend an appropriation
of $25,000 per annum to meot the expensee
nf a commission, to be appointed by the
President in accofdence with the terms of
this section, whcse duty it shalll be to de
vice a just, uniform, and efficient system
of competitive examinations,,and to super
vise tbe application of the sftrrie through
out'the entire civil service of the Govern
ment. I am persuaded that the facilities
which such a commission will afford for
testing the titness of those who apply for
office will not only be as welcome a relief
to members of Congress as it will be to
the President end heads of Departments,
but lbat.it will'also greatly tend to remove
the causes of embarrassment which now
inevitably and constantly attend the con
flicting claims of patronage betweeu the
Legislative and Jtocecutive Departments.
The moat effectual, check upon the perni
cious competition of intluenwand official
favoritism, in tbe bestowal of office, will
be the substitution of an open competition
of merit between the applicants, in which
everv one can make his own record with
the assnrance that his success will depend
upon mis mono.
i also recommend such legislation as,
while leaving ovary officer as free as any
other citizen to express his political opin
ions and to use his means for thoir ad
vancement, ehall also enablo him to feel
as any privgte citizen in refusing all de
mands_upon his salary ior political j??r
poseir ATaw which snohlfl thns pnaran

engaged in the public service, ar.d liLo
wiao contain atrinyeat provisions again.4
tba uawof official anlhorfiy to poerpe the

EVILS OF TIIK SPOILS SYSTEM.

J an improvement of .the civil service, afcd
especially to a reform in tba method of
I appointment frr.dTjftMovaT, Harbeen found
'19 be the practice, und*?r what is known

i croached upon by.members of.Congress.
The firat jrfeD in the reform of. tfite civil
service mult be a complete" <J?vorre be*
j tween Congress and the Kat-outi ve in the
'matterof appointments. The corrupting
[doctrine that "to the victors belong the

understood t^applidrat#f6r officerSnd by

patronage oi thair respective districts anil

longtl* the eyil? resulting from this ipvj
sioa oj tlw* Executive Juncuins. The
trne principle oT government on the sub
ject of appointments to ottice, n? atatud in
the National Conventions of the .leading
parties of the country, have again and
again been approved by the American
people, and have not been called in ques

filoU or p^fhlip opinion upon this all-im
portant subject. we tne ftatajirpt of prio
ciples that belong to the conatltuttonai
ftninture of the government.
?'Under the Constitution, the Preaiden
and heads of Departments are to mak<

not ne tetters iroiu ijje demanda mad

to office until, by legislative enactment,
the pernicious practice is condemned and
forbidden.
It is therefore recommended that an act
be passed defining the relations of mem*
bora of Congress with respect to appoint*
i iripnt tooliice by the President, and I also
recommend that the provisions ot section
1787, ana of the'wctfons following, of the
Revised Statutes, comprising the tenure*
of-otfice act, of march 2,1867, be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods of the civil service in our country
is one of the highest and most imperative
duties of statesmanship, and that it can
be permanently done only bv the co
operation of the Legislative and Executive
Departments of the Government, I again
commend the whole subject to your con
siderate attention.
. TUX UTAH EVIL* .
It is the recognized duty and purpose of
the people of the United States to sup
press polygamy where it now exists in our
Territories, and to prevent its extension.
Faithful aud zealous efforts have been
made by the United States authorities in
Utah to enforce the laws against it. Expe
rience has shown that the legislation upon
this subject, to be effective, requires ex
euaion, modification and amendment.
The longer action is delayed, the more
difficult it will be to accomplish what is
desired. Prompt and decided measures
are necessary. The Mormon sectarian or
ganization which upholds polygamy has
the whole power of making and executing
the local legislation of the Territory. By
its control of the grand and petit juries, it!
poetesses large influence over thu admin
istration of justice. Fxerciiiag, asthe
heads of this sect do, the local political
power of the Territory, they are able to
make effective their hostility to the law of
| Congress on the subject of polygamy, and,
in fact, do prevent its enforcement Polyg
amy wiil not be abolished if the enforce
ment of the law depends on those who
practice and uphold the crime. It can only
bo suppressed by taxing away the politi
I ctl power of the sect whlchencourages and
fuetains It. The power of Congress to en
act suitable laws to protect the Territories
l is ample. It is not a case of half-way
measures. The political power of the Mor
mon sect is increasing; it controls now
I'one of our wealthiest and most populous
| Territories. It is extending steadily into
| other Territories. WhereveT it goes it
establishes polygamy and sectarian politi
cal power. The sanctity of marriage and
j the family relation are the corner-stone of
our American society and civilization.
I Religious liberty and the separation of
! Church and State are among the element
ary ideas of free institutions. To re-estab
lish the interests and principles which
polygamy and Mormonism have imper
illed, and to fully reopen to intelligent
and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that
part of our domain which has been, in a
great degree, closed to general immigra
tion by intolerant and immoral institu
tions, it is rrcommended that the govern
ment cf Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for
the government of Utah by a Governor
aud Judges, or Commissioners, appointed
by the President and conflrmea by the
Senate?a government analogous to the
provisional government established for the
Territory, north west of the Ohio, by the
ordinancO of 17S7. If, however, it is
deemed best to continue the existing form
of local government, I recommend that
'he right to vote, hold office, and sit on
juries in the Territory of Utah, be con
fined to those who neither practice nor
uphold polygamy. If thorough measures
ar? adopted, it ia believed that within a
few years the evils that now alliict Utah
will be eradicated, and that this Territory
will in good time become one of the moat
prosperous and attractive of the new States
of the Union.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
? Oar relation&ii-ith all foreign countries
have been those of undisturbed peace,
and have presented no occasion for con
cern as t"> their continued maintenance'
My anticipation of an early reply from
the British Government to the demand
of indemnity to our fishermen for the in
juries suffered by that industry at Fortune
Bay, in January, LS76, which I expressed
in my last annual message, was disap
pointed. This answer was received only
in the last part of April in the present
year, and, when received, exhibited a fail
ure of accord between the two govern
ments, an to the measure of the inshore
fishing privilege secured to our fishermen
bv the Treaty of Washington, of so serious
& character, that I made it the subject of
u commnuication to Congress, in which I
recommended the adoption of the measures
which teemed to me proper to be taken
by this government in maintenance of the
rights accorded to our tiabermen under
the treatv, and towards securing an In
demnity for the' injury these interest had
suffered. A bill to carry out these recom
mendations was under consideration by
the Houie of Representatives at the time
of the adjournment of Congress in June
last.
Within a few weeks I have received a
communication from Her Majesty's Gov
ernment, renowing the consideration of
the subject, both of the indemnity for the
injuries at Fortune Bay, and of the inter
pretation of the treaty in which the pre
vious correspondence had shown the two
Qovernmenta to be at jrariense. Upon
both these topics the disposition towards
a-friendly agreement is manifested by a
recognition of our right to an indemnity
for the transaction at Eortone Bay, leaving
the measure of such indemnity to farther
conference, and by an asspnt to the view
of this Government, presented in the pre
vious correspondence, that the regulation
of conflicting interests of the shore fishery
of the Provincial sea-coasts, and the vessel
fishery of our fishermen, should be made
the sfabject of conference and concurrent
iir-atwuient between' the two Govern
ments.
1 sincerely hope that the basis may be
found for a speedy adjustment of the very
serious divergence of viawa in the inter
pretation of the fishery clauses of the
Treaty of Washington, which, as the cor
respondence between the two Govern
ments stood at theolose of the laat session
of Congrets, seemed to be Irreconcilable.
In the important exhibition of arts and
industries, which was held laat year at
Sydney, New South Wales^s well as that
now in progress at Melbourne, tlie United
States have been efficiently and honorably
tcprefpnted. The exhibitors from this
countiy at the former place received a
latge number of awards in some of tho
most considerable departments, and tng
participation of the United States was
rerogniteil by a special mark of distinct
ion. In the exhibition at Melbourne, the
share taken by our country is no less
notable, and an equal degree of success is
confidently expected.

a caucus for the purpose of revising the
list of the Senate committees. The only

Alabama. It was agreed that the standing
committees should be reappointed with
out another change than the substitution
of Pagh's name for that of Pryor on the
Committees of Privileges and Elections
and Claims. It was next decided to drop
from the list of select committee* the fol
lowing which have completed their in
vestigations and submitted reports: Sena
tor Wallace on "Alleged frauds in the late
election," Senator Ktrkwood on the "lie1
raoval of Northern Cheyenne and Ponca
Indians to Indian Territor>;." and the
selectcoinmittee, of which Senator Davis
(W. Va.) is chairman, appointed several
years ago "To investigate the finance
reports and accounts of the Treasury De
partment."
HOUSE.
Convening of Congress always attracts
to the Capitol a large number of sight
seers. Before twelve the wlleries of the
House were filled with spectators. On the
floor the members exchange congratula
tions. At exactly noon the Speaker
called the House to order, Itev. Harrison
offered prayer and the roll w*a called.
Number of members present. 227. Jona
than Scoville, member from the Thirty
second New York district, took the iron
clad oath of office. After appointment of
the customary commissioners to notify
the Senate and President of readiness
for buBinbbs, the Speaker called for bills
and resolutions.
Under a call of the States thirty-one
bills and resolutions were introduced in
the fjoose to day, among them the fol
lowing:
By Mr. Converse: Fixing the salary of
the "President at $25,000 per annum, pay
able monthly.
By Mr. YVard: Appropriating $100,000
for the monument of lien. Lafayette, to
be erected upon the tield of tho battle of
Brandy wine.
Mr. Calkins, of Indiana, introduced a
resolution reciting the allegation that there
was in the Washington postoffice certain
bags of mail matter which were attempted
to be sent through the mails under a frank,
although they did not contain frankable
matter, and calling on the Postmaster
General for a report of all the facts relat
ing to the detention of such mail matter.
By Mr. Cox, of New York: A resolution
requesting the President to communicate
to the House any correspondence and
treaties with China having reference to
emigration and commerce between the
two countries.
By Mr. Hurd, of Ohio: A joint resolu
tion relative to tariff. It declares that
legislation on tariff should be governed by
the following principles:
First?That tariff iu a tax on imported
goods, which is ultimately paid by the
consumer.
Second?That a tariff for protection, so
called, does not, in most cases, protect tne
interest it pretends to protect.
Third?That a protective tariff does not
increase the wages of workingmen.
Fourth?That the protective tariff builds
up one citizen at the expense of another.
Fifth?That the protective tariff disturbs
the primal law of trade, which governs
exchanges by the supply and demand,
Sixth?That the protective tariff has
driven American commerce from the high
seas.
Seventh?That tho protective tariff in
creases the probability of the .crime of
smuggling.
Mr. Bicknell, of Indiana, inquired if it
was in ordor to take up at this time the
Senate joint resolution prescribing a meth
od of counting the electoral vote.
Mr. Keife'r, of Qhio?Why calMt up now J
Mr. Bicknell?For the purpose of voting
upon it.
Pending aotion, the President's Message
was received and read.
At first the Message was listened to with
some attention, bnt after a few pages bad
been read the members generally entered
into conversation, and but few followed to
the end. The reading occupied two hours.
The meseage was referred to a committee
ol the whole.
Mr. Bicknell again endeavored to call
upon the Senate a joint resolution propos
ing a joint rule for counting the electoral
vote, the consideration of which had been
postponed until to-day.
Mr. Weaver raised the poipt of order
that the day being Monday, the gentleman
could not take the floor anjl prevent the
members Trom moving to suspend the rules.
?he Speaker ruled that the {potion to
suspend tho rules was one of the privileges.
He wished, however, that the question bo
permitted to lie ever to day, so as to afford
him opportunity to enquire whether the
joint resolution presented the question of
privilege. .
Mr. Conger objected to that course. He
did not desire iny continuing orden.
Mr. Cox, of New York?Give as a vote
on it.
Mr. Conger?No.
Mr. Bicknell demanded a decision as to
whether bis joint resolution presented a
question of privilege.
Mr. Conger moved to adjourn, pending
which Mr. Briggs announced the death of i
his colleague, E. W. Farr, and then the
House adjourned.
The Senate joint resolution not being a
continuing order, cannot come np to-mor
row except as a privileged question; but
the Speaker will undoubtedly be called
upon to decide that question.
Mr. Weaver desired to offer the follow
ing resolution to day:
Wukrsas, Grave abuse* exist in the
management of commerce between States
whereby the producing and shipping in
terests of the country are constantly com
pelled to pay moBtunjnst and exhorbitant
rates for transportation; therefore,
Rcaolvcd, That in the judgment of this
House, it is the duty of the General Gov
ernment to at once exerciae its constitu
tional right to regulate commerce between
the States by the paseage of such laws, and
establishing such regulations as will secure
to the whole people just and impartial
rates for the transportation of both freight
and passengers.
By Mr. Springor, of Illinois: For a tom
Sorary increase of Justices of the Supreme
ourt of the United States. (It provides

Washington, December <).?The an
nual report of the Attorney General was
presented to Congress to-day. Referring
to the election lawe. the Attorney General
Bays: "While I bellevo there has been a
Bteady progress of sentiment in fAvor of
the election laws of the United States, and
of their honest execution, aud while in
certain portions of the Union the Con
gressional elections have been peacefully
and.honestly conducted where, heretofore,
there has been just cauEe for complaint,
yet information from many districts has
satisfied me that recent Congressional
elections were there accompanied bv Buch
open violations of law aud such gross frauds
aa to demand the attention of Congress
and perhaps additional legislation. Meet
ings assembled for the peaceful advocacy
of the merits pf candidates hove been re
peatedly urokeu up entirely or invaded
by bands of armed rutlians.' In some in
stances public avowal lias been made of
the intention to act, aud public invitation
to that effect, while no effort was made
by the local authorities to prevent such
outrages. Violence and intimidation are
not reported to have occurred however to
the extent that prevailed in the elections
of 1S7U and 1878. I respectfully submit to
the consideration of Congress whether the
time has not now arrived when an elec
tion law should be passed which shall take
into the control of the United States offi
cials selections for members of Congress.

W AT8RF0RD, December 6.? 1 n the speech
at the land meeting here yesterday, Par
nell denounced the government, which he
said was too weak to deal with the land
subject, and hoped to crnsh the movement
by depriving the people of their represen
tatives in Parliament, but, he continued,
nothing now could put down the agitation
until the tiller of tho soil became its owner.
Parnell charged the Government with en
tering into a conspiracy against the Irish
people, and said mild justice of revenge
(meaning assassination) was only at
tempted when there was no organization
(meaning Boycotting, etc.). Parnell'a visit
here is believed to be his last public en
gagement for the present. There was a
banquet after the Land League meeting
here yesterday1
Parnell wasj reeented in Town Hall to
day with'tbe freedom of the city. In a
speech he expressed tbe belief that the
baclc of English rule in Ireland wns
broken and the country would ultimately
recover its legislative independence.
London, December U.?A 2una' corres

proposition to confer the freedom of the
city of Waterford on Parnell, was carried
with considerable opposition. The result
of the opposition, however, was that the
dissenting members of the municipal
council had been more or lesa boycotted.
The system of wholesale intimidation waa
exercised to compel a co-operation. In
the arrangements for the reception of
Parnell, windows of several establish
ments were smashed, when it became
mown that their owners would not join in
iie "popular" movement, and in two cases
watch had been constantly kept to see
hat no business was done. Inhabitants
lad to joiu in the rejoicing* or have their
