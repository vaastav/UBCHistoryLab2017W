The Poll Ural Outlook.
On last Monday the xi.vi. Congress
npsembled in Washington. It is to be
hoped that (be lessons of the Fall
elections mty not be lost upon our
statesmen in Congress assembed, but
that, profiting by experience, (proba
bly sad experience in some cases), they
may consign revolutionary measures,
violent denunciation and calumny j
to the grave of oblivion. The senti- ,
meat of the true rulers ot this Country j
the people, is not in accord with any j
party, no matter what its name may j
be, that tends to retard our prosper
ity as a nation by fomenting discord
in our midst. A new factor (the in
dependent vote) is making itself felt
in our politics: and it requires some
thing more than a party name or an j
appeal to party prejudice to induce- j
ments to combine and vote as a unit!
for the party. The“ machine" is
wearingout. The Fall elections were,
not of a nature to satisfy any political
party. To the advocates of the Green
back they were disastrous; and those
gentlemen in Congress who wcie
clamoring for more greenbacks wilj
probably bo able to devote tbeii pow
ers of oratory to subjects which may
he of some benefit to the people.!
Resumption an accomplished fact;
various industrious of the Country a,
gain in full activity; a steady foreign
demand for the abundance of the pro- ;
ducts of our soil; our mines yielding!
largely of the precious metals; every-;
thing in the full tide of prosperity, j
the Financial Question has settled I
: tself, and the Greenbacker may well,
any,"my occupation's gone. And "so ,
mote it be" say wo. Rut the sign of
the times are not only for the advo-;
cates of fiat money. Those statesmen j
who proposed to make the House ot j
Representatives the sole government j
of the Republic may also read in j
those signs that the citizens of the j
United States will not countenance
any revolutionary measures to attain;
their object no matter bow meritor
ious that object may be. So, too,
those ardent patriots who have striven
to array section against section by
darning appeals to passion and prej
udice, may read that they cannot, by |
any amount of dust they can throw,
blind the ayes of the people to their
true object; their own elevation, no
matter bow it may injure the material
interests of the Republic, faking all
these facts into consideration, it may.
safely be assumed that tho average
Congressman will very likely do more
thinking and less talking, than has
been his custom in the past; and that'
the present session of Congress will
be less exciting than any previous
session for some years past, and that,
if any legislation is matured it will bej
in tho direction of the development of
the true interests of the whole coun
try. The two great political parties
are so nearly balanced that a blunder
on the part of either in Congress may
result iu the loss of the i residency
with its enormous patronage, to the
party making the blunder, that it is
▼ery probable no reckless move will
be made on the political chess-board.
The lobby will no doubt muster in
force, as usual, with prospects for sub
sidie*, private jobs &c, but the ap
proaching Presidential election will
loom up, a signal af danger; therefore ,
the schemes of the lobby will not be
likely to receive much aid from the
public treasury tho present session, j
Tho death of Senator Zaohariah;
Chandler is a great Ices to the Repub
lican party, and in a great measure to
the entire country. H character
for sterling honesty was acknowledged
by Iriend and toe and no questionable
transactions wore ever traced to his
hands. His outspoken manner made
bum some enemies but with it there
went admiration for his sincerity. He
waa an enemy of everything savoring
of duplicity ami courted downright
defeat rather than secure victory by
means that were not open and honor
able. He closes a career of useful
ness and distinction without even the
faintest taint of suspicion as to his in
tegrity, ami leaves a record behind
which, in miny respects, is worthy of
imitation by the young men of this
tmd coming generations. ,
A ISrllliaal Wedding-
The marriage of Mr. Richard Mc-
Sherry, son of Dr. Richard Mcbberry
and Miss Emily Hillcn, daughter of
the late Mayor Hillen, came oil at
the Cathedral on Wednesday after
noon, and was one of the most brilli
ant allairs of the season. There were
eight bridesmaids, all dressed in white,
viz: Miss Alice Van Bibber, Miss
Georgio Iselin, of New York; Miss
Annie Winslow, of Ohio; Miss Mary
McTavisb, Miss Sadie Bonsel, Miss
Carrie Dnllin, Miss Lizzie Donald
Miss ilettie Pascault, of Washington.
There were no Groomsmen, but the
ushers were Dr. diaries Tilghman,
James Swan Frick, Dr. Fred. Brick,
j Allen McSberrv, Charles Gambrill,
jCurzon Hoffman, Livingston Minns
land Ho.vard Munnikhiiysen. Ihe
| ceremony was perfoumed by Rev.
1 Archbishop Gibbons, assisted by la
thers Curtis, Lee and Starr, 'ihe
attendance present comprised many
ladies and gentlemen of our best soci
ety. The presents to the bride were
handsome and valuable. Af.er tho j
'reception the happy couple left for a

Relation of Minder* and Ap
prentice*.
We have often thought that if mat
j tors properly comprehended the re-
I lotion thev sustain to their apprenti
ces and employees, their pecuniary
interest would not only i>e greatly
' enhanced, but that a positive good
[ would be rendered to every branch ot
I industry in which they are engaged •
The first duty of a master should be
to present in himself an example for
imitation in the elements ot industry,'
morality, system, and the other attrib - 1
' utes which constitute a superior me
, chanic or workman. They should
; moreover, observe and study the din
( positions and minds of their appren- 1
; Goes, with a view of conciliation their j
regard and confidence, and through
this means to establish a free and
familiar intercourse, and render the
task of instruction and development
more simple and easy. As t lie ap
prentice advances in knowledge and
'skill, suitable evidences of apprecia
tion and encouragement should be
! given them. This will stimulate their
ambition and create among them a
worthy spirit of emulation.
Where the character of an appren
tice is such as to require a tight reign
upon his actions, and the deprivation
ij of privileges, and other suitable pun
i ishments for idleness and misconduct,
j care should be observed that these
| curbs and punishments Jo not descend
Unto such acts of tyranny as will de
stroy the spirit and ambition of the
i youth, and render him obstinate, un
' ruly, and beyond all future influences
1 of excellence and good. Besides a
! thorough instruction in his trade or
i profession, and a sound and healthy
: education to otherwise render him fit
i for hie social position in life; it should
I be the aim cf a master to instill into
; bis pupil all the scientific and ctbor
, knowledge possible, even should such
knowledge have no direct bearing
upon tho business or trade in which
ha is engaged. Buck acts of interest,
kindness; and confidence as these and
others of a corresponding character,
cannot fail co produce the most mark
ed beneficial results upon the interests
of the master, and the happiness and j
t future of the grateful apprentice, :
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The following is a synopsis of tin; Proa
idem's annual message, ’vldtli was trims
' milted to the 4(!th Congress on Tuesday
last.
After congratulating the members of
Congress upon the favorable cireunislnii
cea under whieb they have met and giving
thanks to the giver of all good for our un
usual national prosperity, Inc President
congratulated Congress upon the success
■of the resumption art. Tl e resumption of
specie payment lias been followed by a great
revival of business. With a currency equal
in value to the money of the commercial
world we are able to compete with other
nations in trade and production The for
eign demand (or our manufacture and pro-'
ducts lias increased in our favor,the amount
of which from July Ist, to Nov. 15th last,
was $50,000,000 in gold. The credit of our
nation has been greatly improved. The 4
per cent Bonds have been sold at or above
par, and enough to liquidate the debt which
was redeemable at present. The saving of
interests by the refunding process since
March Ist |B7<l amounted to §14,‘407,1TT.
The national debt, which matuies within
less than two years, amounts to $702,141,-
700, of which $500,000,000 bear 5 per cent
and the balance 0 percent interest.
The gold coinage by the mints during
the year was $40,080,014. I'liesilvercoin
age up to Nov. Ist 1870 was $45,000,850,of
which $14,700,0 i l are in circulation and
i the balance still in the hands of the gov
! eminent. 11 is urged upon Congress to
authorize the Secretary ol the 1 reasury to
suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon
the present legal ratio. It is the firm con
viction of the President, that the issue ot
legal lender paper money, based wholly
upon the authority and credit of the gov
ernment, except in extreme emergency, is
without wariaut in the constitution and a
violation of sound financial principles.
The policy of the I idled States lias been to
avoid the creation of a national debt, mid
when, fiom necessity, in time of war, debt’
have been created, they have been paid olf
on the return of peace as rapidly as possi
tile.
mi: sti‘l , i:i>.'lon or e ji.yttAMV.
The continued deliberate \ iolalhm of the
laws of the Uuilwd Slates in the territory'
of I’lali demands the attention of the Gov
eminent. The territory of 1 tali has a pop
illation sufficient to enlitle t to admission 1
I as a slate, and its general interests, as well
as that of the nation require its advance
from the territorial form to the privileges ol
a stale. This change however will mu be’
app’oved ol by lbe country, white the c.i
i/.ens ol Utah uphold a practice, which is
condemned as a crime by all eiviii/ed na
lions. The law for the suppression ol
polygamy was enacted more than 1 . years
ago, tint Inis until recently In cm a dead let
ter,wlien the Sup elite Court ot the 1 lilted
I Stales decided the law to lie within the
I leg slative power of Ciimjres mud binding
j It should therefore tie firmly and elhrli/e
!lr executed. If nccissaiylo secure obedi-i
cnee to the law, the exercise of the rights
and privileges of a citizen of tin* 1 mted
Stales max he with, held fiom those, who
violate the law.
civil. si:u \1 c K 111 l OliXf.
The grave evils and perils of a partisan
spoils system ot appointment to cilice and
of office tenure are now generally recog
nizcil. In the 1 csoiiilions of Inc gicnl par
ties, in the report.- of the departments, in
i Ihe debates and proceedings of Coinness, 1
in the messages of executives these evils
have been pointed out and the need of their
| reform have been admitted. The tenure ol
j office should not depend upon the preva
lence of any polity, or the supremacy ot,
I any party, lint should lie determined by
their capacity to serve the people most
! usefully, irrespective of partisan interests,,
j The authority to appoint to olllee or re- j
I move, is rot a perquisite to lie used in aid j
ing a friend or reward a partisan, lull is a
trust to lie exercised in the public interest
Every citizen has an equal right to Hie
honor and profit of entering the public sir
vice ol lus country. The present system |
of appointment does not secure the best
men, and often not even lit men, for the
public places. A reform in the civil ser- 1
vice xvi 11 be bulled with approval by the
whole people of Hie I’tilled Slates. On
March lird, 1871, Congress passed an act
“to regulate Hie civil service ol Hie I idled
Stales and promote the ellieieney thereof,
giving the necessary authority to Hie exec
utive to institute a civil service reform. —
Acting under the authority, a number of
eminently competent persons were selected
to take charge of Hie examinations ol ap
plicants. This board of examinations lias
been known ns the "Civil Service Commis
sion.’’ For two years appropriations xverc
made by congress tor Hie expenses and
compensation of the commission. Eater, 1
' however, the appropriations were with
drawn, and ns a e< nseqiienee the active
1 work ot the commission was suspended-
Repeatedly recommendations have been
made to Congress to make the necessary
appropriations, but without success. Re
ports from the heads of the different de
partments show, that where examinations
have been made, Hie public, service lias
been greatly improved. Mere partisan ap
pointments are not compatible xvitli the
freedom cf elections. It is therefore recom
mended, Hint a revision mid extension ot
the present statutes be made, which will
secure to those in every grade of official
life the protect lon xvitli which an enlight
ened and great nation should guard those
who are faithful i j its service.
UICI.AITONS WITH KOIUCPJN col. XTUI ICS
Our relations with Foreign countries have
continued peaceful, There i. still an un
settled question xvitli Great Britain in re
gard to the fisheries. A claim of $103,•
| 1f0.J.03 lias been piesenled to England lor
j Uie damage done to Ann ricun citi/ens nl
Fortune Bay in January 1878, to which an
early reply is expected. Ellm'ls have been
made to remove the restrictions found in
jurious to the exportation of cattle to the
United Kingdom The question is of grave
importance, growing out ol the incidents
of the Cubiiui insurrection, nave been, for
the most part, happily and honorably set
tled. Negotiations for extradition lieaties
with the Netherlands and Denmark are
now in progress. Some questions with
Switzerland in regard to pauper and con
vict emigrants have frisen. With the:
German Empire frequent questions in eon
neelion xvitli the subjects of naturalization
and expatriation have arisen, but the ini
perial government lias constantly manifes
ted a desire to strictly comply xvitli ail j
Ireily stipulations in regard to them. The,
legation at Athens lias been withdrawn,
owing to the failure of Congress to make
the necessary appropriations. IMalions;
xvitli Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal,
Turkey and Belgium continue amicable.
No change has taken place in the relations
between Egypt and the United Stales,
, The treaty recently made between .Japan j
and the United States in regard t Hie re
vision of former I real i <s will, it is believed, 1
be followed by similar action on Hie part of
other treaty poxvers. The government ot
i China lias signified its willingness to con-j
sider the question of the emigration ol it-;
1 subjects to the United Stales xvitli fairness
and to assist in such measures as may
tend to prevent injurious consequences to I
the United Stairs.
Diplomatic intercourse xvitli Columbia is !
again fully restored by the arrival ot a
iniuistcr from that country to the United 1
Slates.
Relations xvitli Chili have also been
strengthened by the reception ot a minister ■
from that country. Tin United States has j

The report of tl;e post master general
hears testimony of Hie general revixalof
business throughout the country. The
expenditures of the depnilineiit were
1 nearly three and a half millions in excess
of the recr ipls.
i The secretary of Hie interior and the
commissioner of .Indian atiairs set forth
the present stall'of our relations xvitli the
Indian tribes on our territory, and Hie
■ measures taken to advance their civiliza
tion and progress. It is earnestly recoin
mended that a law be enacted lo enable the i
government to give Indians a title in tee,
in nllienablcfor 45 years to the farm lands
assigned to them by allotment. Great
depredations have been made on the timber
lands of the United Slates, and the prose
cutions and lines turned over lo the United
Stales Treasury. A law should be enacted
to enable the government to sell the timber
from public lands without conveying the
fee.
It is earnestly recommended that further
appropriations lie made to complete the
Washington Monument.
