says that Mr. Storer's -refusal to an

It became evident they "were likely

says Mrs. Storer urged Mm to give
her husband a cabinet place and that
she stated Mr. Choate at London and
"General Porter at Paris were not
proper persons to be ambassadors,
suggesting her husband in that con

a letter from Postmaster General
Cortelyou contradicting the state

commissioned a gentleman to ask the
pope, "a3 a personal favor to him," and
as "an honor to the country," to ap
point Archbishop Ireland as Cardinal.
Mr. Cortelyou says the late President
never made any such request. The
President declares that Mr. Storer'a
statement that he authorized any
such message to be delivered to Pope
Pius is untrue. He says that he never
received a letter from Ambassador

he personally gave the pope on be

A Joplin Practical "Joke.
Three Joplin men, Ben Wurzel, Tom
Kinmouth and Paul Carnaban, a negro,
were arraigned before a justice of the
peace eharged with attempting a grave
robbery. The two white men turned
state's evidence and told how local
physicians had offered them large
sums for a body. They went to the
cemetery and there lost their nerve.
The jury discharged Wurzel and Kin-
mouth, the white men, and sentenced
the negro to ninety-nine years in the
penitentiary. : The whole thing was a
practical Joke on Carnaban planned by
Wurzel. The negro was induced to en
ter into the scheme "by promises of
every kind, the only purpose being to
take him to the cemetery and leave
him there to walk home. It worked
out all right, and the next morning
Wurzel hit upon the" plan of having
himself, Kinmouth and Carnaban ar

they were to ttirn state's evidence.
The jury, needless to say, was packed,
and selected from those who were In

Another Respite for Mrs. Myers.
A respite of 30 days has been grant

was also shown to Frank Hottman,
who was convicted of complicity in the
killing of Mrs. Meyers' husband. This
is the third respite granted the pair,
this latter one to enable the woman's
attorneys to complete the record in the
case in the United States supreme
court, to which it has been taken. No

Everyone who knows that In using

It to a proper focus. Suppose that you

the other tube at a focus that suit

through both tubes. You should have
a more or less blurred vision, and If
you kept on looking the chances are
that you would feel giddy and get a

FILLING UP THE CANADIAN WEBTV
Ths
American 8ettler la Welcomed
to Canada.
A number of. the leading newspa
pers on this side of the line have been
noticing the growth of the Canadian
West In recent years, and draw atten
tion to the fact that there seems to be
to that great grain-growing country.
The Buffalo Express thus refers to the
subject:
"Canada. West continues to grow.
There were 4,174 homesteads entries
there in July of this year, as against
3,571 in July, 1905. Canada plumes
herself over this fact, with becoming
pride. But what appears to make our
neighbors happiest is the statement
that of these 4,174 homesteaders,
1,212 were from this side of the line.
Little is said about the 97 Canadians
who recrossed the border to take up
homes In Canada West, or of the 808
from Great Britain, or of the 1,236
from non-British' : countries. It ap
pears that the item in this July report
that makes Canada rejoice most Is
this of the 1,212 American farmer
who. deoided to try their fortunes ia
Canada West
"The compliment is deserved. Ths)
1,212 were mostly from Dakota anil
other farming states, and go Into
Canada fitted better than any other
class of Immigrants for developing the
new country. They take capital with
them, too, say Canadian papers proud
ly. In every way, they are welcome
over there."
As the Express well says, the
American is welcomed to Canada, and
the reasons given are sufficient to in
vite the welcome. The Amerlacn
farmer knows thoroughly the farming
conditions that prevail in the Cana
dian prairie provinces, and Is aware
of every phase of agricultural devel
opment in recent years.
In practical knowledge of what Is
wanted to get the largest return for
labor and investment he 13 by long
odds superior to any European set
tler. He knews what Is required to
bring success, and he is able and will
ing to do it, and his future causes no
apprehension to the successful Cana
dian farmer. The agent of the Cans
dlan Government, whose address ant
pears elsewhere, says that the differ
ence between the manners and cu
toms of the farmer from Dakota. Ore
gon or Minnesota and the farmer from
Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta
is not nearly so marked as that b
tween the farmer of the Maritims
provinces and the Ontario tiller of tho
soil. . Hence, tfce welcome to the tres
homesteads of the Canadian' West,
and there are hundreds of thousands
of them left, that Is extended to ths

Sympathy Not Needed.
Dr. Frldtjof Nansen, Norway's fa
mous arctic explorer, now minister
to Gerat Britain, makes light of the
sympathy expressed by many persons
anent the "hardships" of travelers. He
says: "There never was such mis
placed sympathy as commiserating a
man who has lived in the wilds. Most
men who travel in out-of-the-way parts
of the world do so because they like
it People who live in the center of
what is called civilization do not un
derstand, cannot realize, the spell that
getting close to nature, battling , with
nature, has' on the heart." He -does
not believe in the use of alcoholic bev
erages, holding that while liquor will
raise the temperature for a few min
utes, after that; It falls lower than
before. ... '
