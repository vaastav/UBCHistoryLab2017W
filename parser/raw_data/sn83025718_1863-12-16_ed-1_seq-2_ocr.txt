South was the Government. We deem
it mcra probjhle that they will prefer to
tight the battle of slavery out to the
bitter end. They inaugurated the war
ia the iaterc&t of slavery and against
freedom; and, we foci quite certain that
the eword will not be laid aside until
they are completely subjugated, and the
chains stricken from the limbs of the last
slave. This is the fate they have invi
ted; and, we are prone to think that a
jujt Providence will not permit them to

We Lave republished from the Cincin
nati Commercial the vcr y interesting
letters of Mr. Edward Crapsey, giving
fall accruals of tbe siege of Knoxville,
and the heroio conduct of the officers and
men under the noble Curnside. In one
of tie letters injustice was done to the
27th Kentucky, one of tbe most gallant
regiments from that glorious old Slate
a State which we love for her past histo
ry, lor her great men and lovely women,
. for her patriotism and zeal in the cause
of tbe TJfiioir, and as the land of our na
tivity. Bat Mr. C. did not da this wil
lingly ; and at the first moment, in a
later letter, made the amende 7mora!!e.
We republished this letter yesterday, but
the paragraph relative to the 27th Ken
tucky was "knocked Into pi," whilst the
form was being made up late at night,
and c uid not be "re-set" in time. We
therefore insert it this morning by itself,
as follows. It gives us more than pleas
ura to do th:s :
Ia my last I gave yon an account of the
terrible repulse of the rebels be fur Fort
Baundtmon Sunday the 29th, and have
nothing more to add. Cut in my account
of the affairs across the river, I did in
justice to the 27th Kentucky. My in
formation was derived from sources that
nine times out of lea would be correct,
but on this occasion was mistaken. The
27ih did not fall back from the line it
occupied r it;l it was so ordered by Cap
tain 8cotf,(ot the 4oth Ohio,) ofUcerof the
day ia charge of the line, who saw that it
was ia danger of being Hanked. That
danger being provided against, and the
general officers in charge arriving npon
thft front, the line was ordered forward
again, and the 27th, with the other regi-
niiu) lurmru wna gaiiant alac
rity, oriVmg tbe rebels before tbem, and
agraia taking possession of the ririe-pits.
There was no cowardice displayed then
r elsewhere by the 27ih, which has an
enviable reputation, of which they are
pretty jealous. While on this Subject, I
would remark that so far as my inform
ation at present extends, and certainly
to the extent of my observation, not one
single maa of this entire Army of the
Ohio has flinched from his duty. That
ia a broad assertion, but I believe it to
be true. This army has been called upon
to endure a vast amount of exposure and
hardships, but has met it all without a
murmur. Short rations, unceasing duty
in the trenches or on picket, wind and
weather, have all been taken as a matter
of course, auJ through it all the army
has maintained a confidence in its own
proweia that has been of incalculable
beneSt, Now, when the danger ia passed,
it will not be improper to say tnat tbe
leaat demoralisation, at any time during
the laat eighteen days, would have worked

The plan presented by President Lin
cola ia his Annaal Message for the res
toration cf the insurgent States to the
authority and rizhts abdicated by their
rebellion, will attract the widest alien
tion both in this country and ia Europe.
Uitberto the attorneys of treason on ths
stomp and in the journals of tea loya
States have urred the oselessness of de
listing from rebellion as an excuse for
persistence therein. "If they should
withdraw their auomrt from the rebel
leaders and return to loyalty and fidelity-,
too will nevertheless confiscate a!
their oronertr and direst them of every
civil and political right: so why should
thev ? What is to be tiieir motive
their inducement?" The President has
answered the question and silenced the
cavil. Every person now within the
territory of ihe rebellion, with exception
of two or three thousand or its more con
epiciooa and determined chiefs, may ae
cure a full pardon to-morrow, aad be
restored to all Lis former privileges as
loyal citizen of the United States, with
his property intact (save that which mar
bare already been ooncssated. ana sold;
on the easy condition of his swearing at
legiarce to the United States, and to
abide by and acquiesce in the ac'a of Con
gress and Executive reclamation aiiect
ing the tfalm of slaves, "so long and so far
as not repealed, modified, or declared
void by Congres, or by a decision of the
supreme Uourt. Here is required no
assumption of the universal efficiency
and irrevocable validity of those acts and
proclamations, bat a simple agreement
to resp- ct and abide by them, and each
of tbem, until the same shall be invali
dated either by Congress or the Supreme
Court of the United States. IIow caa
anyone who means to be loyal at alLob
ject to these conditions? Ninety ol
every hundred Kebels may be restored to
everv right to-morrow witaout sac mi
cing or relinquishing any particle of
their property ; while nine-tenths of the
residua ae required to relinguish noth
ing but their right to oppress and sell
their fellow men. We believe Tennessee,
Louisiana and Arkansas may be nor
ganized and restored to the Union on
this basis at an earlr day. aad that the
residue will gradually follow.
Henceforth, it can neither be truthful
ly nor plausibly said that those who have
once bean Kebels have no inducement to
return to loyalty, no hope but ia the tri
umph of iisaiuon. iney may come
back t morrow and erjjy every politi
cal or social privilege and advantage ea-
lyed or claimed by any of as. We prof
ler them equality with ourselves. Should
not that sutUce and content them t
The country must now realize that
naught but Slavery obstructs the way
ti Peace and Keunion. In no metapbo
ric or poetic sense, the Union and Lib
erty are henceforth inseparable. They
will either rejoice in a common deliver
ance and triumph or fill the same bloody
grave.
Of course, the master-spirits of the re
volt will not be conciliated. They Lave
staked their all npon the cast, and m ist
stand the hazard of the die. But what
possible motive will a non-slaveholdir
have for persisting in rebellion after re
ceiving due notice of the issuing of this
Proclamation? Merciless bands miy
still scaur the region cursed by the re
Tjlt, and drag every man and youth into
the Rebel camps often by tbe help of
bloodhounds : but to what end shall the
non-slaveholding conscripts remain and
fight ? What they risk and lose by con
tumacy is obvious : where is the coua
terbalancinggain? Depend on it, this
Proclamation, if seconded and sustained
in the loyal States, will go far to break
the back of the liebeliion.
In Europe, it will be even more gener
ally efficient The fiendish malevolence
betrayed by the Secession oracles is
rarely or never exhibited in Europe
through quotations from the Rebel jour
nals; yet none can fail to realiie the re
gretful tendtrnees and kindly charity
wherewith the Rebel masses arecontem
plated by the President. Though his offi
cial term of service has been rendered
anxious and troubled by their treason,
he has never ceased to regard them as
deceived and misled, and to desire their
speedy return to loyalty and peace. The
mere influential British and French
journals conceal this, so far as possible,
from their readers ; yet the truth gradu
ally makes itself known and respected.
But when the loyal North, through the
President, prof! rs amnesty and restora
tion on the single condition of acquies
cence in Universal Freedom until Con
gress or the Supreme Court shall decide
that this is a condition which the Presi
dent had no right to impose, why should
any stand out? And how can Liberal
Europe withhold her ardent, active sym
pathy from the cause that asks nothing
of its deadly enemies bat that they let
the oppressed go free? 2? limts will
misrepresent and Ihe Saturday Review
defame us as usual : the aristocracy may
still frown or sneer: but the masses of
Europe, already instinctively our friends,
will be impelled by this proBer to a
more general and hearty enthusiasm in
behalf of that Union which now repre
sents, even more emphatically than hith
erto, tbe aspirations of bowed aad strug
gling Labor throughout the civilized
world. Thanks, then, to our president,
for the wise humanity and generous mi
pulses which prompted the issue cf his
Proclamation of amnesty! It must be
that in this sign we shall conquer?
(From lb N. T. TIuim.
The most striking feature of the Mes
sage is that part which relates to the re
vival of State Governments, as the South
ern territory is redeemed from rebel
power. The President hero, for the first
time, commits himself to a dtfiui te policy
and method in respect to this most im
portant matter, lie gives no countenance
to the project, which Las been so ve
hemently advocated, of reducing the re
deemed Stales to a territorial condition,
that tbey may continue to be directly
governable by Federal authority. Yet
he recognizes the necessity of securing
State Governments that shall be loyal
to the Union. This he declares to bs not
only a necessity, but a constitutional ob
ligation, inasmuch as the Constitution
imposes upon the General Government
the duty of securing to every State a
Republican form of government, which
it would fail to do if it allowed a State
to remain in the Lands of its enemies.
To establish this loyalty, he sets forth a
comprehensive and stringent oath of al
legiance, the taking of which shall be a
condition precedent to the grant of am
nesty and pardon for Laving participated
in the rebellion. To make the loyalty
thus secured available at the earliest
day, he provides that whenever one
tenth part of the numbar of the voters
in the States in 1SG0, take the oath, and
desire to put the State Government again
in action, they shall be authorized and
aided to do so; with the single restric
tion that no action shall be taken by the
revived State Government again6t the
Emancipation Proclamation, which, as a
war measure, is an accomplished irrevo
cable fact in his judgment, and which he
will feel it his duty to maintain, in its
full, breadth, unless it shall be adjudica-
ted by the Supreme Court of the United
States to have beet repugnant to the Con
stitution, and therefore null and avoid.
The process of reconstruction, as the
President puts it, is simple and yet per
fectly effective. The mwtiv to reaasume
loyal obligation is secured by making it
the only rneaaa of escaping confiscation
of property and all the other penalties
of treaeon. The ad is secured with the
very highest sanction possible, by making
it rest on a most emphatic and solemn
oath. Tbe rfeci is secured by enabling
those who ibus comply to revive and
carry oa the Slate Government, just so
soon aa they comprise a certain definite
proportion of the whole number of the
voting population before the rebellion.
Those who are for the Emancipation
Proclamation are satisfied by the Presi
dent's declared determination to main
tain it until pronounced null by the
highest judical authority of the land;
while those who hive opposed it as an
unconstitutional assumption of power
cannot complain, for they hare it ia their
1 jrawer to test the unconstitutionality by
an appeal at any time to that Court for
a decision. Certain categories of traitors
of peculiar dye are exempted from the
benefit of the oath, which, of course, will
meet the approbation of: every loyal man.
Other minor provisions are made, to com
plete the equity and efficiency of the
plan. We .believe that the closer it is
examined, tbe mare it will be discovered
to be completely adapted to the great end
desired. The public mind, afUr due re
flection, we have not a doubt, will accept
it as another signal illustration of the
practical wisdom Of the President.
from tit Uuata IV(.
! The President's Message ia tersely
written, presenting our foreign affairs in
the brieiest terms possible, and even is
not lengthy on domestic affairs. Our re
lations with other powers ara treated in
a kindly tone, both Lcgland and France
being complimented for their suecessfu
efforts to preserve their neutrality in pre
ranting the departure of hostile expedi
tions from their ports; so that we remain
in peace and friendship with foreign
powers. ! '
The position taken with regard to the
return of tbe Southern people to their
allegiance, is liberal to every interest but
to slavery; and instead of letting this
alone, it presents the Proclamation as on
a par with the Constitution. "If it be
proper," are its words, "to require as
test of admission to the political body,
an oath of allegiance to tbe Constitution
of the United Stater, and to tbe Uuion
uader it, why not also to tbe laws and
proclamatioas in regard to slavery?" and
in the important Proclamation of Am
nesty, tbe oath required excepts slaves.
Still tbe President, in both Message and
Proclamation, makes a vital distinction
between the Constitution and the Eman
cipation Proclamation, for the oath re
quires adheraace to tbe latter only so
long as it is not modified or held void by
Congress, or by decree of tbe Superior
Court, while nothing is said about the
Constitution being subjected to this tri
bunal.
Slavery may be left to the mercy of
events. The great diluculty begins as it
passes away andia the questions aris
irg out of race. The message rather
ai n mnces conclusions than discusses
principles. The territorial theory is
rejected aad the ground taken that when
the requisite number of legal voters un
dor existing State Constitutions, take the
oath, they shall be the S tate. The speci
fi cation is, the qualified voters according
to tbe election law of Ine mates exist
ing immediately before the so called act
of Secession aad excluding all others.
Any number of persons, not less than
one-tenth in number of the rotes east in
1300, on taking the prescribed oath, may
be the State. Thus while the President
recommandi a condition as to slavery
on tbe return ol Mates, ne proposes to
put the political power of the returned
States in the bands of the white race.
From ths rhlUde!phi Pre.
There are three sentences in the Presi
dent's message which should be written
ia letters of gold: ''The crisis which
threatened to divide the friends of the
Union is past" "I shall not retara to
slavery any person who is free by the
terms of the Proclamation or by any act
of Congress." "1 proclaim full pardon
to all who solemnly swear to henceforlh
faithfully support, protect, and defend
the Constitution of the United States and
the Union of the States thereunder."
The first of these is the truth upon which
all our hopes are based ; the second is a
sublime declaration that henceforth free
dom is the law of the Republic; the
third is a noble appeal which, it seems to
us cannot fail to show the suffering poo
pie of the South t8t it is not upon them
that the United States makes war, but
upon the crime of their leaders, and the
cruelty of their rebellion. The last two
truths, indeed, strenghthen and sustain
the first, for the crisis it past when the
President can thus decree by the will of
tbe people the abolition of slavery, and
at the same time offer full pardon to the
men, who, to protect slavery, attempted
to destroy tbe Government.
The offer the President has made is
the most generous, the most magnani
mous, that ever lawfal ruler made to
criminal insurgents. Magnanimity could
go no further; concilation could grant
no more. Upon condition! the easiest to
fulfill, and tht'least humiliating to accept,
he has offered the people of the South,
no limited and imperfect pardon, bat ab
solute aad entire forgiveaees. lie hss
guarantied to them every right they for
merly possessed, insured them their olden
equality of the people of Pennsylvania
aid Massachusetts, asked tbem to return
to their allegiance, not as men disgraced,
butlo reassume, with honor, the proud
positions they had fortified. The oath
they must take to obtain this full par
don is one so carefully and delicately
worded that every loyal man, from th
humblest laborer to the highest officer of
the Government, might take it without
feeling that it implied censure of his past
action or doubt of his future course.
This noble Proclamation of Pardon is
the counterpart of the Proclamation of
Emancipation ; together they will be re
corded in history as embodiments of the
justice and the mercy of the loyal men
of the United States. If Mr. Lincoln, at
the beginning of the war, seemed to be
one of those fortunate men who had
greatness thrust npon them, he has since
shown the higher power to achieve great
ness by unsurpassed fidelity to a nation
al trust and comprehension of a world's
revolution.
If we had ever despaired of success, we
could no longer despair, now that we
have read this calm and earnest message,
which, itself so quiet and firm, must kin
dle a new enthusiasm for the cause. It
is principle, right, liberty, that is the
soul of the President's message. lie has
given shape and thought to the inspira
tion of the people. In reading his plain,
firm, but singularly gentle words, we
imagine a man who bends but does not
tremble beneath tha burden of the fa'e of
a continent We read in this solemn
message the integrity of our chief magis
trate ; the resolution of the American
people to maintain, in spite of all that is
past or to come, tha Uaion; their enmi
ty to slavery as the foe of the Union ;
their confidence in their own power;
their trust in humanity, and their faith
in Almighty God.

Whkbkas, There is a number of a la as
States to which that Proclamation does
not apply ; and,
Wuiekas, The Constitution of the
Stale of Arkansas prohibits its Legisla
ture from preventing alave ownera of
those States from bringing them into this
State; therefore, be it
Eelved, 1st, That those who aeaert
that the Proclamation aetteles the oues-
of slavery in Arkansas, are either igno
rant of our Constitution, or would lull
the people into a false security, in order
to the re-establishment of slavery here,
when the armies shall be withdrawn
Zi lhat It is the duty of the pcoole of
Arkansas to call a Convention, as soon
practicable, and ao amend cur Constitu
tion, as to place the question beyond the
reach of cavil.
3d, That the man who wou'd willing,
y hand down to another generation this
'bone of contention," with all its attea-
dant consequences, is on worthy the age
in which he lives, and justly deserves
the execration cf posperttr.
Which were unanimously adopted. i
THE LATEST NEWS.
CfLrrriER CoiraTuousK, Dec. 12 De
serters fiom the rebel lines state that a
large number of soldiers will take advan
tage of tbe amnesty offered ia the Presi
dent's proclamation, as soon as they caa
become acquainted with its provisions.
Soldiers would have come over to us ia
bodies long since if they could have been
satisfied they would not at once have
been impressed into the Uaion service.
They have been assured by their officers
that would be tbe fate of every deserter.
No doubt a large majority cf the North
Carolina and Border State troops are
heartily sick of the war and desirous of
returning to their allegiance.
Washington, Dec. 14. Accounts from
the Army of the Potomac state that re
ports are prevalent in camp that Long
street has succeeded in effecting a junc
tion with Lee; but, after due inquiry, it
cannot be traced to any reliable source.
Niw YoitK, Dec 14. The Post's Wash '
ingtou apodal mentions a rumor that
Gen. Schofield is ordered to report at
Washington.
FoBThEsa Monroe, Djc. 14. General
McDowell arrived here this morning from
Baltimore, and had a lengthy interview
with Gen. Butler. '
The Richmond Enquirer of the 10th
contains the following :
Bristd, Nov. 9. Oen. Center's brigade
encountered the advaace of Wilcox's
corps, 200 strong, near Maynardsville,
Tenn, routing them and c spurring a
number of prisoners. Wilcox's conxuaad
was composed cf raw troops.
In the Confederate Congress, on Dec.
23, Mr. Foote expressed great indigna
tion at tha course pursued by Jiff Davis.
When Pemberlondishonorably surrender
ed Vicksburg to the enemy, the Prosident
made him his companion, and carried
him to Bragg'a army, when, as he rode,
the soldiers were heard to say ; Thure
goes the traitor who delivered us over at
Vicksburg." The President never visi
ted the army without doiag it aa injury;
never yet, that his visit was not followed
by disaster.
He was instrumental in the Gettysburg
affair; he instructed Bragg at Marfrees
boro; he had opened Georgia to 000
of the enemy's troops, and laid South
Carolina li ible to destruction ; he charged
Davis with having a'most ruined the
country, sad declared that he would
meet his champion any win rj to discuss
the matter. Would to GoJ he would
never visit the army again.
Washington, D?c. 14 Senate Mr.
Dixou f resented the petitionVf a large
number of assessors and assistant ases
Bore, asking for aa increase of compensa
tion. 1
Mr Dixon also gave notice of a bill
amending the conscription act in such
manner as to exempt all clergymen.
Wilsoa, latroicod the fouow.n res
olution :
Eetolved, That the gratitude cf the
people and the thanks of the Representa
tives in Congress are due and are hereby
tendered to Major-General Hooker and
the officers and soldiers of the Army of
the Potomac for the skill, energy, and
endurance, which first protected Wash
ington and Baltimore from the meditated
blow of the advancing and powerful ar
my of the rebels, led by Gaa. Lec, and to
Gen. Meade aad the officers and soldiers
of that ermy for the skill aad heroic
valor whicb, at Gettysburg, repulsed,
defeated, aad drove back, broken, aad
dispersed, beyond the Kappahanaock,
tbe veteran army of the rebels.
The resolution was referred to the
Military Committee.
Mr. Wilson introduced a joint resolu
tion that the thanks of Congress be prof
fered to Mtjor-General Banks, and the
officers and soldiess under his command,
f.r the skill, courage, aad endurance
which compelled the surrender of Port
Hudson and then removed the last ob
struction to the free navigation of tbe
Mississippiriver. Referred to the Mili
tary Committee.
Novel irXoslcal Instrument.
Dr. Uachenberg, ef Springfield, Ohio,
now of U. S. A. Hospital No. 1, of Nash
ville, has hit upon an instrument which,
a3 singular as it may seem at first sigh',
is not the most unpromising olo fur tho
general diffusion of a taste f.r music, and
of an econonomical enjoyment of a skill
ful musical telegraph for the purpose of
extending music from competent per
formers into every family, as cheaply
almost as our gas and water. His mode
of applying it is to locate in some eeatral
pait of lha city a musical depot, presided
over by some highly skillful performer
oa the piaao or melodeoa. To this in
strument an electrical attachment may
be made to communicate with a thousand
other pianos in the city, these again hav
ing their own peculiar magnetic attach
ment Inuepen dent.
