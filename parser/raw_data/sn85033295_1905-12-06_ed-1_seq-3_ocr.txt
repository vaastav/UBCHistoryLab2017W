Cultivator or Harrow.
This is the device of a West 1 ii‘-
ginla farmer and seems to possess
merit. He says:
I send herewith an Illustration of a
cultivator or harrow that I find very
handy when sowing grass seed in corn
at the last working, also use it for
cultivating potatoes and other crops to
some extent. The frame, a A A, is
#f 2x3-inch stuff, is3 33y 3 feet long. The
HANDY CULTIVATOR OR HARROW.
two pieces, B B, are of lx2-inch stuff,
20 inches long, with holes about 2
inches apart, so the harrow can be ad
justed to any desired "width, from 1 to
3 feet. The piece, C, to hitch to, is
2x3 inches and 1% feet long on top
side, firmly bolted to center piece of
frame. At D D there are two iron
plates 44xlU>x5 inches, with three holes
in each; these hold A A A together.
Use % bolts of proper length for all of
the frame. The teeth should be of %
steel, well sharpened. The handles
can be taken from some cultivator or
plow and readily adjusted to the cul
tivator. The two pieces, E E, should
be of stuff, and as long as
desired. All should be bolted firmly
together for best results.
A Barrel Feed Rack.
An ideal way of feeding a few sheep
or calves is to take a large barrel, such
as crackers are packed in, and cut out
openings in the staves between the
two layers of hoops, making these open
ings just large enough so that the ani
mal can get its head in and out read
ily. Place the barrel in position and
hold It in place by driving several
stakes into the ground and fastening
them to the barrel. Of course the top
of the barrel is open. The hay or oth
er roughage Is thrown in the top and
the animals eat through the holes cut
in the staves as described. This is a
simple feeding rack, which any one
could make and one which will save
much waste of roughage. The illustra
tion shows the Idea so clearly that no
further explanation is needed. —Indian-

Amateur Mushroom Growing:.
The Cornell experiment station has
undertaken to tell amateurs how they
may grow mushrooms for profit In a
small way in old stables, available cel
lars and similar out-of-the-way places.
The fundamental requisite is a dark
room of uniform temperature, that is,
one that.does not go below 55 degress
or above 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Con
y ruble success was obtained in the
experiments in growing mushrooms In
boxes under benches in a greenhouse,
and under benches in a basement of
the college buildings.
The beds, spawned Nov. 23, and cov
ered with dirt a week later, produced
the first of the crop Jan. 1, though the
regular pickings did not begin until a
week later. The boxes cactained about
90 square feet of surface and yield at
the rate of two pounds of mushrooms
for each square foot.
A word of warning is Included not
to attempt to grow mushrooms in the
cellar of a dwelling, as the odors aris
ing from the compost in the beds is
sure to permeate the living apartments
despite the best efforts to prevent It.
In the Dairy.
Queer but true, where salt la sprin
kled thickest butter Is yellowest.
The cow knows by Instinct what
feed ration suits her best.
Every cow in the dairy barn should
have a window to herself.
Dairyman, study your cows and then
yourself and see if you are fitted to
take care of them.
Swinging stanchions are comforta
ble, not expensive and do not obstruct
the interior of the stable.
Cement floors cost more at first, but
their permanency makes them cheap.
From 62 to 64 degrees is about the
proper temperature for the riuse water
In winter butter-making.
If you have raised and put by lots
of feed the cows will take care of it,
and incidentally of you.
If the dairy floor la cement, plenty
of bedding must be used so that the
cow’s udder may not touch the floor.
When you go out to buy cows this
fall don’t buy the first oue you see.
nook around and see if you can’t find
a better one.
Work and Play for Horses.
What the horses of the farm have to
do depends upon the nature of the
work and how well used they are to
it, consequently the horse should be
treated accordingly. If the horses have
heavy spring plowing to do, with more
or less road work in the summer, then
harvesting and more plowing in the
fall, and it is Intended to use them for
heavy drafting In the winter It wdll
pay to divide the work in some way
so that they will have a little chance
for rest. The argument that rainy
days and Sundays are sufficient for
the animals does not hold good in all
cases. In our experience we find it
pays to have reasonably short hours
for the horses, and not to give them
driving every day there happens to be
a little lull in the work of the farm.
We feed strictly In accordance with
the work to be done, and contrive, in
some way, so that every horse will
have a turn at the pasture, even though
it be only an hour or two at night. It
Is not a good plan to attempt to carry
the horses through from year to j-ear
without the pasture. Green food cut
and placed in the manger is not th*>
same. The open air, the freedom from
the harness, the yielding of the soft
turf and the biting of the grass are
essential to horses, and it pays to let
them have a spell at it.
Feed Bag for Animals.
The driver of every team should be
supplied with a bag of some kind for
holding feed for his horses, as he sel
dom is sure where he
will be when feeding
time comes. Some
wr drivers are very care
ful in this respect,
while others make
. use °f anything that
Is available. Quite
I* ~ a number of
■' feed bags are in use,
- ■ the majority being
feed bag. constructed so that
they can be attached and suspended to
the side of the horse's head. This does
not give the horse any freedom to
move his head without moving the
bag also. A Philadelphia man has pat
ented an exceedingly simple feed bag
which overcomes this fault, an illustra
tion of which Is shown here. The bot
tom and sides are made of canvas or
other flexible material, while the top
consists of a circular frame divided
into two sections, which are connected
by small loops. Supporting the bag
are two metal rods, one on each side,
having hooks at the end which flt into
the loops in the frame. In the center
and at the other end of the rods are
circular loops which are shaped to flt
over the shaft of the vehicle. It can
easily be seen how easily this could
be done, the bag always remaining in
position where the horse could con
veniently reach the feed, at the same
time being able to move his head free
ly. This feed bag has the additional
advantage that it can be folded up
when not in use.
Fodder-Hauling 1 Sled.
Take two scantlings, 24x4 inches, 10
feet long; dress top of scantling off to
fit under side of second bench of sled
, JtSnn 9 ILjT with notch t 0
4- fit over rear
bench, to give
right slant to scantlings. Nail a board
on top of scantlings to hold them to
gether. Put a wire around tongue and
over front end of boom pole, and a
small rope for rear end of boom pole,
with two standards in front 4 feet
high, and you are ready for ,l biz.” It
is much handler than a wagon for one
man to haul on, and he can haul a
third more at a load with it than with
out the attachment. It can be set off
when desired.
Peanuts Good Hog Feed.
The numerous estimates made by
the Arkansas Station as regards the
yield of hay from a crop of peanuts
varies from one to very nearly three
tons per acre. This hay is usually
worth at least $lO a ton and may be
considered a by-product when the nuts
are harvested for market. In connec
tion with the value of peanuts as a
forage crop, it may be noted that in
Virginia there is a man who has been
accumulating a tidy fortune through
the quality of the hams cured and
packed by him. Those hams have a
rich and sweet flavor which makes
them in great demand at increased
prices. The packer each year goes
through neighboring States buying up
razor-backs which he has shipped to
his farm. It is there that they are
given a food which imparts the flavor
and sweetness —nothing more than
peanuts.
Hoar Hints.
It is, of course, the most Important
factor in hog life, but very close to
it comes the dry house and good, clean
bedding.
It is too common a conclusion that
anything will do for the hogs and that
they will wax fat under any condi
tions and with all sorts of feed.
It is taken for granted that they get
enough to eat, because every farmer
knows what it means to feed right,
but feeding is not the whole thing.
Swine are money makers general’ ,
no matter under what conditions they
live, but if you want more money keep
them under treatment which will earn
it.
PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
Both Houses of Congress Hear
Reading.
FIRM ON RATE LAW.
Corporations, Panama Canal and Many
Other Important Topics Are Thor
oughly Discussed.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. s.—Pres
ident Roosevelt’s message was read to
Congress today. It is in substance as
follows:
The Nation.
The people of this country continue to
enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly
there will be ebb and flow.
Something can be done by legislation
to help the general prosperity on a pol
icy which shall insure to the advantage
or all people who act decently.
If the less fortunate man is moved
to envy to strike at the conditions under
which they both live, the result will be
that while damage may come to the one
struck at, it will visit with an even heav
ier load the one who strikes the blow.
Taken as a whole we must all go up and
down together.
Corporations.
The corporation has come to stay just as
the labor union has come to stay. Each
should be favored as long as it does good.
Experience has shown that it is use
less to try to get an adequate regulation
and supervision of great corporations by
state action. 1 believe that it can be ob
tained by the enactment of law by the
Congress. If necessary the constitution
must be amended.
It has been a misfortune that national
laws on this subject have been of a pro
hibitive rather than an affirmative kind.
The successful prosecution of one device
to evade the law immediately develops
another devise. What is needed is not
sweeping prohibition but supervision and
regulation.
Of these abuses perhaps the chief is
overcapitalization.
Railway Rates Law,
It must include putting a complete
stop over rebates. The power should be
affirmative and should be given to some
administrative body created by the Con
gress. The most important provision is
conferring on some administrative body
the power to decide whether a rate is
just * * * if unjust, to prescribe the
reasonable maxinLum rate, this to go into
effect within a reasonable time, subject
to review by the courts. A rebated rate
should be made the maximum on all
similar transportation. My proposal is
not to give the commission power to in
itiate or originate rates, but to regulate.
The best possible regulation would be an
agreement among the railroads to cai’ry
out the law. * * * It would put a stop
to discriminations. A system of exam
ination for railroad accounts similar to
that now conducted in national banks
should be provided. Present laws have
been greatly destroyed by delay in the
courts. The question of transportation
lies at the root of all industrial success.
We must understand that the public
servants who are to do this work must
be of the highest type. They must be
well paid.
Safety Appliances.
The Congress should provide for the
introduction of block signals on all rail
roads engaged in interstate commerce.
If there are any reasons for laws limit
ing the hours of labor they certainly ap
ply to railroad workers with peculiar
force.
An employers’ liability law applicable
to all industries within the scope of the
federal government should be enacted.
Labor.
There has been a demand for depriv
ing courts of the power to issue injunc
tions in labor disputes. Such limitation
would be unwise. * * ♦ Some judges
have misused this power, but it does not
justify a denial any more than of the
power to call a strike for improper exer
cise of the power.
In such a republic as ours the one
thing that we cannot afford to neglect is
the problem of turning out decent citi
zens; the children of today are those who
'will share the destiny of the land tomor
row.
The introduction of women iuto indus
try is working change and disturbance in
domestic and social life. The decrease
in marriage and especially the birth rate
is coincident with it. There is need for
knowledge on which to base legislation
for protection of working women.
If the class spirit grows it will ulti
mately prove fatal to us.
This government is not and never shall
be governed by mob. Each man, rich or
poor, shall be treated simply and solely
on his worth as a man.
The noblest of all forms of govern
ment is self-government; but it also is
the most difficult. There are selfish
and brutal men in all ranks of life.
Insurance.
That state supervision is inadequate
has already been generally conceded.
The United States should follow the pol
icy of other nations by providing ade
quate federal supervision.
The Revenues.
Unless our expenditures can be kept
within the revenues, then our revenues
must be readjusted. There is more need
of stability than to attain ideal perfec
tion. The shock and strain to the busi
ness world certain to attend any serious
change render such change inadvisable
unless for grave reasons. It is yet too
earij to attempt to outline W'hat shape
the readjustment should take.
Economy,
To cut down on the navy would be a
crime against the nation. * To fail to
push forward all work on the Panama
canal would be as great a follv. All un
necessary offices should be abolished. In
the public printing also a large saving
can be made.
Currency.
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of elasticity to our
currency system.
Business Methods.
There is every reason why our execu
tive government should be at least as
well planned as the best machinery of
the great business organizations.
Federal Elections.
Not only should both the national and
state Legislatures forbid any officer of
a corporation from using the of
the corporation in any election, but they
should forbid the use of such money in
connection with any legislation except
by employment of counsel for distinctly
legal services.
Hague Conference.
We can do nothing of permanent value
for peace unless we keep in mind our
aim is righteousness.
We have scant sympathy with the sen
timentalist who dreads oppression less
than physical suffering, who w“ould pre
fer a shameful peace. As the world is
now, only that national is equipped for
peace that knows how to fight if war is
demanded. But it remains our clear
duty to strive for peace.
Monroe Doctrine.
That our rights and interests are deep
ly concerned ifr the maintenance of the
doctrine is clear. This is especially true
in view of the Panama canal. It must
be understood that under no circum
stances will the United States use the
doctrine as a cloak for territorial aggres
sion. All this country desires is that
the other republics on this continent shall
be happy and prosperous. If a republic
to the south of us commits a tort against
a foreign nation, the doctrine does not
force us to interfere to prevent punish
ment, providing punishment does not as
sume the form of territorial occupation.
Santo Domingo.
Santo Domingo has made an appeal
to us to help her and not only principle
and wisdom but every generous instinct
binds us to respond to the appeal.
Army and Navy.
I do not believe there is any army in
the world that has a better average than
ours * * * but previous should be
made for maneuvers. The number of
posts in time of peace should be dimin
ished. Promotion by mere seniority can
never result in a thoroughly efficient
corps. There should be an increase in
the coast artillery force, and increase and
reorganization in the medical department.
Our navy must always be of greater
size than our army. It does not seem to
me that the navy should be increased
beyond the present number of units, but
efficient should be substituted for in
efficient units.
Probably the result would be obtained
by adding a single battleship each year.
Naturalization Laws.
No alien is to be naturalized until at
least ninety days after tiling his petition.
Criminal Laws,
The delays of the criminal law, no less
than of the civil, now amount to a very
great evil. Legislation should be enacted
to cover breach of trust in the shape of
prematurely divulging secrets by an em
ploye or officer of the United States. A
statute should be provided for punish
ment of a United States attorney or oth
er officer who corruptly agrees to do
wrong, other than for money.
Public Land.
The iniquitous method of monopolizing
public lands are becoming more generally
known, but existing laws do not furnish
effective remedies. We cannot afford to
substitute tenants for freeholders on pub-*
lie domain. All organized opposition to
the forest reserves of the west has dis
appeared.
Merchant Marine.
It cannot but be a source of regret and
uneasiness to us that the lines of com
munication with our sister republics of
South America should be chiefly under
foreign control ♦ * * through the lib
eral aid bestowed by other governments
on their own steam lines.
Pensions.
That Congress take action toward care
for the graves of Confederate dead. The
first need is to take charge of the graves
of Confederate dead who died in the
northern prisons.
Immigration.
We should have none of the wrong
sort. We need more immigration for the
south. No emigrants should be allowed
to come from Canada and Mexico, save|
natives of the two countries themselves.
Keep immigrants away from the con
gested tenement house districts of the
great cities..
In the effort to carry out the policy of
excluding Chinese laborers grave wrong
has been done to the people of China.
Chinese students, business and profes
sional men should be encouraged to
come. We cannot expect to receive
equity ‘from China) unless we do equity.
Civil Service.
Written competitive examinations do
not make the ideal method, but they rep
resent an immeasureably advance upon
the “spoils*' system.
Copyright Laws.
Our copyright laws urgently need re
vision.
Adulteration of Foods.
Interstate traffic in foodstuffs which
have been debased or adulterated so as
to injure health or deceive purchasers
should be forbidden.
National Parks.
The grand canon of Colorado should
be made into a national park. Nothing
should be allowed to interfere with the
preservation of Niagara Falls. The
boundaries of Yellowstone park should
be extended to include forest preserves
on the south.
Lifesaving Service.
Give members of the service pensions
such as are given to firemen and police
men in all our great cities.
Indians.
Some amendment of the internal rev
enue laws to prosecute “bootleggers."
The acts of Congress prohibiting the sale
or gift to him (the Indian) of intoxicants
has substantially become inoperative.
The Philippines.
If there has been error as regards giv
ing self-government to the Philippines it
has been it quickly, I earnestly x*ec
ommend that the tariff now imposed
upon the products of the Philippines be
entirely removed except on sugar and to
bacco, that these be reduced 25 per cent
and removed after July 1, 1009. So
primitive are the methods in the islands
that it will be many years before the
products of these islands will have any
effect whatever upon the markets of the
United States. The only solution (of
labor on the islands) is the training of
the Filipino.
Hawaii.
Immediate steps should be taken to
fortify the island. Hawaii is too heavily
taxed. Seventy-five per cent, of the rev
enue receipts should be set aside for, say
twenty years, for education and improve
ments. Hawaii shall never be a territory
in which a governing class of rich plant
ers exists by means of coolie labor.
Porto Rico.
Legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico.
Insular Affairs in General.
We have been paying all heed to the
political and educational interests of
these islands, but it is not less important
that we should favor their industrial
development.
Alaska.
Alaska be given an elective delegate.
Admission to Statehood.
Indian territory and Oklahoma be ad
mitted as one state and that New Mex
ico and Arizona be admitted as one
state.
Panama Canal.
What is needed without delay is an
appropriation by Congress to meet the
current and accruing expenses of the
commission.
Neither at home or abroad is there
a sufficient working force to do the busi
ness properly. The salary list should be
adjusted.
The Unflattering Barber.
John Drew, as he lunched, talked
about barbers.
“They are so uncomplimentary," he
said. ‘‘They tell you such unflattering
things.
“A friend of mine went to be shaved
at the Dark Harbor hotel one day last
summer, and the barber said to him:
“ ‘Your hair is getting thin, sir.’
“ ‘Yes,’ my friend answered, tartly. T
have been treating it with antifat. 1
never did like stout hair.’ " —New York
Tribune.
“EAST LYNNE” VILLAGE
GOES TO THE
TK rij>or Fa>rm I
KU?<jtoo CSupcb £, [
as the bride of Archibald Carlyle, whom she quitted in a fit of pique, only
to return again, disguised as Madame Vine, to nurse her sick child and then
to pass away after having confessed her folly and received her husband s
forgiveness.
Few popular novels,, perhaps, have contained more glaring literary faults
than “East Lynne," but few have ever equaled it In popularity. Mrs. Henry
Wood, wrote “East Lynne” in 1861, when it first appeared in “Colburn’s New
Monthly." As soon as it was completed, it was issued in book form. It
went through edition after edition In Great Britain, was pirated vigorously
in America and translated into every known language, including Parsee and
Hindustani. One of the librarians in Madrid, years after, told the author’s
son that the most popular book on the shelves was “East Lynne." For forty
years it has, as a play, had a successful run on the stage. Numerous ver
sions of it were produced between 1861 and 1890, but from none of them did
the author profit a cent. “Bast Lynne" has made more than $1,000,000 for
others, and only fame for its author.
The story is, from the modern point of view, defective in almost every
thing which makes a novel a work of art; but it cannot be said to lack
incident or interest. Half of its popularity at the time of its publication was
undoubtedly due to the reaction then setting in against inane and impossible
goodness. It was a protest against the conventional hero, and on the stage
it was one of the earliest of modern “problem" plays, before “problem" plays
were recognized and labeled. It requires great good will to the author to
believe that the heroine could return to her husband’s house and remain
there without the husband seeing through the transparent disguise of a pair
of blue goggles. Modern criticism is apt to characterize Lady Isabel as a
very silly woman and her husband as a very dense specimen of manhood.
While Mrs. Henry Wood was not skillful in character drawing, she is
said to have had in mind a former owner of Abberton Hall when she drew
Mr. Carlyle. This gentleman restored the old church and was generally
admired in the neighborhood for his uniform kindness and generosity.
Abberton is the modern spelling of the Ehriton of the Domesday Book,
and it goes back to Saxon times, when its owners -were the abbots of Per
shore. In the reign of Edward 1., the name was changed to Albreton, and
In 1524 all the manorial rights and patronage of the parish were granted to
Thomas and Francis Sheldon by Henry VIII. Until late in the eighteenth
cantury the Sheldons held the manor, but then the estate passed Into the
hands of F. Laslet, who represented the borough of Worcester in Parliament
for some years.
The parish church of Abberton possesses many points of great historic
interest. It Is believed to have been a chapelry as early as the twelfth cen
tury and is dedicated to St. Edburga, the sainly daughter of the Saxon King,
Edward the Eider. From early childhood Edburga manifested deep religious
feelings, and these culminated in her assuming the veil of a nun in later
years. It is told of her that when one day her kingly father offered her
glittering jewels and gold in one hand and a book of the Gospels and a cha
lice in the other, she chose the latter. It was inevitable that such a pious
woman should have miracles associated with her name, and many are re
ported to have been wrought in remote times around her shrine at Pershore.
The present church building is not the one in which Edburga worshiped.
There have been two restorations, but some portions of the windows of the
old church still remain, and there is a Norman font which is well preserved,
although credibly reported to be 800 years old.
There are many magnificent tombs of the Sheldon family, both at Abber
ton Church and at Beoly. Those at Abberton date from 1659 and are under
the western tower of the church. The register of the church is also full of
curious antiquarian interest, for it goes back to 1661 and has been carefully
kept by a succession of rectors.
The manor hall of Abberton is situated within easy distance of Birming
ham, and the grounds march on the south side with the estate of the Duke
of Orleans. It stands on an emlnince surrounded by fine forest trees and
commanding views of the Malvern Hills, the Lench Woods, the fertile and
charming Vale of Evesham, and the Cotswold Hills. The hall is a com
modious building, and the most interesting relic of its early days is a stone
and brick Elizabethan chimney with the date 1619 carved on it.
Flevel Manor, which is also situated in the parish, was once the property
of Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who, however, lost it in one of the
social and political upheavals of his time. At the dissolution of the monas
teries all the lands fell into the hands of Henry VIII., who parted with them
to the Sheldons, and it was in this way that that old family came into pos
session of the entire parish.—Montreal Star.
BIG COST OF MODERN NAVY.
THE BATTLESHIP VERMONT. NOW BEING BUILT.
While the struggle between Russia and Japan taught no new lesson of
prime importance, in the opinion of naval architects, it emphasized the fact
that the time is fast coming when only the richest nations can afford to go
to war. In other -words, war is destined to diminish If only on account of
the very lack among the smaller nations of proper material wherewith to
conduct it.
The coming battleships, those now being designed in this country and
in England, for example, will cost when complete, about $6,000,000. For the
smaller nations a fleet of such enormously expensive engines of war is out of
the question, and when the nations that can afford to build these fleets meet
smaller nations In war, as the United States met Spain in 1898, then must
come such one-sided battles as Manila and Santiago.
The tendency in naval construction is to build heavier ships than have
ever been seen, to make these ships as speedy as possible and to arm them
with the heaviest guns. This tendency, it is interesting to know, is not a
result of the Russo-Japanese war. Though emphasized and advanced by the
engagements that have taken place in Oriental waters, nevertheless, the ten
dency antedates the war. It is to be seen in the battleship Vermont, which
w r as recently launched at the Fore River yards at Quincy, and which has
a displacement of 16,000 tons and will carry four twelve-inch guns. It is
equally noticeable in the new British battleships of the King Edward class,
which have a displacement of more than 16,000 tons and which carry four
twelve-inch, four 9.2-inch and ten six-inch guns.
