Who i' Benner, the Indiana funn

pers that haven’t anything else to do,
find out and let us know? “Bonner’s
Predictions’’ a queer little book with
a fantastic coyer is making a sensation
in New York. The book-stand at the
U inds >r hotel has so hi 200 copies of
it in two months. Some of our most
successful speculators are said to he
governed Iy it. Of all the bears who
made their pile a year ago in the fall
of stocks. Cam mack is about the only
one of them all who had sense enough
to go out at the right time, and so
held his own. Woeriscboffer, Clews
and others kept in the current and let
their pile on a rise in July and Au
gust an 1 lost all they had taken out of
Jay Could, Vanderbilt and the North
ern Pacific, and more too. Camraack
says he went out last spring because
Benner told him to. He claims that
Benner actually did predict correctly
the financial variations of the last
eight years in his hook printed in l>7tj
and he jin~ his faith on Benner’s new
predictions, as follows:
“1884 —Presidential year, dull
trade; iron drooping; lower prices.

stocks higher. 188(i —renewed de
pression; stocks lower. 1887 —the
same. 1888—presidential, hard times;

of affairs this year. 1889—now fora

Ihe most colossal liars that in
ha! it this terrestrial ball may he found
in Duluth. 4he lies told bv the den
izens of that hamlet are so silly, how
ever, that they hardly need alluding
to. Their latest we find in the Pioneer
Press of Monday, and is dated the oth
hist., and is to the effect that no grain
elevators can ever be built ou the Wis
cousin side of tlioSt. Louis or Superior
bavs because no solid foundation can ,
be found on which to place such a
structure, and that Duluth is the onlv
place at the head of the lake where an
elevator can find a safe resting place.
It i> contemptible in uue to so lie
about his neighbor, but the liar gener
ally ge!> tlie worst of it in the long i
run, tor, when people come to investi
gate the matter the lie appears plainly
and operates against those who put it
in circulation. There are other good
points for elevator plants on Lake Su
perior, no doubt, but none better than
Superior, and the day is not far dist
ant wlu n the most of the grain grown
iu the great North-west will pass
through Superior elevators on its wav
to Europe or our own eastern markets.
I hat libelous attack on Mr. S. E.
i uhhs in the Inter-Ocean last week,
proved a regular boomerang to the
little clique of schemers who thought
to do Mr. Tubbs an injury. Men of
all parties immediately rallied to Mr.
Dibits support and defense, while the
squad of detainers of character,
slunk into the shade and swore vehe
mently at their failure. We are glad
to he able to state, however, that Mr.
fay lor, the proprietor of the paper
was not in the city at the time the
an and. and c mdemns it as
severely as any one, and promptly dis
charged the party, who as acting edi
tor, wrote- the article. It was a dirty
piece of work, and as usual in such
eases, the parties doing the work, are
the ones most bedaubed and disgraced
by it. Hie article was clearly libelous,
but whether Mr. Tubbs will commence
suit against the sheet or not, lias not
vet been decided.

OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
Sinvial Correspondence.
Wa<hix(*to.v, Dec. oth 1884.
1 be fir-t week of the second session
of the 48th Congress has ended.
Already both of the Legislative bodies
have settled down to work. This they
■hd almost a j naturally and quietly
as it only a week instead of five
months had intervened between the
'ast and present meeting.
On last Monday wh m the President
of the Senate and the Speaker of the
House brought down their gavels ex
actly at noon, thus opening Congress,
crowds of visitors filled tlie galleries;
both chambers had an air of freshness,
and cleanliness, and the desks of Sen
ators and Representatives were load
ed with flowers. Otherwise there was
but little to indicate that it was the
beginning of anew session.
Due interesting and decidedly un
usual feature of the occasion was the
good natured chaffing indulged in by
the Democrats at the expense of their
Republican friends, over the result of
the Presidential election. The Re
publicans took the bantering in good
part, and no bitterness was manifest
ed. Congressman Cox of New York
was conspicuously busy in ottering
condolence to his political opponents.
1 he Democrats are in good spirits, but
the Republicans skillfully conceal anv
dejection they may feel. The South
ern Members arc not so demonstrative
us it was predicted they would be.
They congratulated each other on the
Democratic victory, hut they seemed
to be impressed with the duty of re
straining hilarity in the presence of
their defeated opponents.
The Presidents message was listened
to in both Houses] with the usual in
attention. The proportion of Senators
and Members who lounged and look
ed bored, and tried to kill time was
considerably greater than the mini her
of attentive listeners. Congressmen
consider the official reading of clerks
Very monotonous, and prefer to got
their impressions of an Executive doc
ument from their own perusal of it.
After an extended inquiry among
them I learn thaN as a whol *, they
think President Arthur s last annual
message is his best. ’ They praise it
for its dignity, for its temper and for
the clearness and simplicity of its
stylo.
But the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury is more commented upon
than the Presidents message. It has
been called the most vigorous present
ation of the finaeial conditon of the
country that has ever been made. Mr.
McCulloch has pleased the friends of
lower taxes in his Tariff recommend
ations, but his position will doubtless
excite a great deal of dissent in his
own party.
The first sensation of the session
was raised in the House of Represent
atives by Congressman Follett’s im
peachment resolutions. He brought
charge* againt Marshall Lot W right
in connection with the employment of
deputy BMarshals at the election in
Cincinnati!. A short, bitter debate
followed in which Messrs, Converse,
Hiscork, Reed, Brumm, Miller, and
ex-Speaker Keitt’er took part, and the
resolutions were finally adopted.
The new Senator, Mr. Sheffield, who
is the temporary successor of the late
Senator Anthony of Rhode Island is
about sixty years old. He is quite
lame and walks laboriously with the
assistance of a large cane. He has a
few straggling locks of hair, which he
combs over a bald head, a benevolent
countenance, and prefers, for an ev
ery day garment, ala Senator Conger,
and Representative Poland a swallow
tailed coat.
Senator Logan occupies his old scat
in the Senate chamber between the
two Maine Senators, and was the first
man to break the brief silence after
tlie chaplains prayer on opening day.
Democrats as well as Republicans
sought the first opportunity to shake
ban Is with.the defeated candidate and
pass some words of friendly greeting.
Gen. Logan met them all with a smile
and ready reply, but it was evident
that his old time exuberance of spirits
could not be summoned at will.

Country papers arc the most useful
ami least compensated of all the agen
cies which stamp the impress of pro
gress upon villages and inland cities.
Without the aid of local newspapers
local towns are, as a rule, thriftless
and dead. It is common for small
gn at m n to speak with contempt of
the local newspaper, but the village
newspaper makes more great men out
of less material —more brick without
straw —than any other in politics, and
it is the one ladder on which men
climb to local distinction as the be
ginning of wider fame. The advent of
the local newspaper has always dated
the increased thrift of the community.
The local newspaper is the life of the
locality, and the measure of its sup
port. as a rule measures the advance
ment of the people. Not only sub
scribe but pay for your local newspa
pers. They are friends and helpmates
of all seasons.

Washington, Special Telegram
Dee. sth—The argument of the \\ in
ona tV St. Peter land case ha* given
the town a good joke. Judge \\ ilson
says at one point in his brief:
Lord Bacon has wisely and truly
written, ‘‘The letter killeth, but the
spirit makes alive.” Is it not enough
if a man substantially complies with
the spirit of the law, if he does not
comply with its every letter? If he
honestly believes be bus done so and
acts accordingly, with his good faith
and honest intent not be considered by
this department in the interpretation
of the law?
(ien. Gordon E. Cole opened his
brief as follows:
The claimant's counsel in this case
is either grossly ignorant of the law or
has broken his oath as an attorney,
for he does not know that Lord Ba
con did not write the epistle to the
Corinthians, or he is trying to mislead
the interior department by falsehood
and deceit, by quoting the Apostle
Paul as good authority in land cases.
When the great apostle wrote to the
people of Corinth ‘ The letter killeth
but the spirit giveth life,” he had no
reference to timber culture cases, and
in fact the act entitled, “An act to
encourage the growth of timber in
\\ estern prairies, - ’ had not become a
law in A. 1). GO, nor did it become
a law until 1800 years later, so it is
clearly to be seen that the language
quoted is not in point. There is one
thing in bis argument also that is to
be regretted, and that is the charge of
plagarisiu against the great lord chan
cellor of England. Bacon has been
charged with being the author of
plays commonly credited to Sbak
and also with corruption in ofliee; but
this new thrust of literary piracy is
extremely unjust, coming at tiiis late
date from a member of the Minnesota
bar.

June last in command of a transport
expedition of Lake Mistassini has re
turned. He gives a few particulars
taken en route. The party with great
difficulty reached provinces on the
northern boundary on Height of Land.
They then crossed into Rupert’s land
and at a distance of 360 miles from
Lake St. John they reached the south
western extremity of the great Luke
Mistassini. He states that the general
trend of the lake as far as known is
from southwest to northeast stretching
away from Foam buy and Height of
Land in the southwest to an unknown
distance toward the east of Maine and
Labrador. The waters swarm with fish
of all kinds and fur bear ng animals
are abundant. The climate is agree
able and suitable for agricultural pur
poses. It is stated that the Hudson
Bay company have had their agency
there f>r upwards of 100 years, but
have held it secret that a lake of such
dimensions ever existed. It is sup
posed to be as large as Lake Superior.

Cremation.
The destruction of human remains
through the action of lire was the mod
extensively used and was considered
the most honorable mode by most of
th ~ nations of antiquity. Aad thence
the idea of the funeral ptre and urn
sepulture is as much Associated with
heatheirsm as burial in the earth is
with C. hristiauity, though ilicro is. in
truth, no necessary conne -t on between
the two. Though it is now’ well asecr
ta ned that the body of the poet Shelley
was burnt from reasons perta ning to
the quarranline regulations, it was al
the time considered an additional
proof, had any been required, of his de
termined hostility to ( hristiaa o iserv
ances, and it was with some I tfle diffi
culty that a clcrgym 11 could be per
suaded to read t lie burial service over
his remains. The Greeks commonly
buried the r dead on the sixth or sev
enth dav after death: but up to that
time myrrh, gum of cedar tree, salt,
wax and many costly and sweets cute 1
drugs, honey, balm and bitumen w ire
used to prove it an disagreeable odor.
The funeral pile it-elf was 0111 posed of
fir or pine wood, g ncruliy ia the form
of an altar. Bitch, turpentine and
other intlamnlab’e substan es were
spread over the pile, and cypress trees
wore set around at a ceiia.u and stance.
Then the e.c- of the corpse were gen
erally opene 1. and if a wind arose it
was considered a favorable omen.
When a 1 was eonsum the calcimnl
bones and ashes, soaked ai costly
wno , were gathered together and
placed in the funeral urn, which was
c m-igned to the sepulcher. The Ro
mans interred their ilea I, in the tir.il in
stance, and adopted the cu-tom of
burning them from the (Wrecks but not
tax a very great extent until low aril the
end of tee Rcpubli •. It was most gen
eral under tlie Emperors, and gradual
ly fell into and snse about the md
0 the fourth century, when ChriM
auity became the prevalent creed.
But the Gnek and Roman laws
a! kc prohibi c l the burning or bury.ng
of the dea l withui any city, both fron
san tary and civil considerations. The
(■reek koimetcrion, or i ed of slum’ cr,
was generally at a considerable dis
tan o outside o the towns. The Ro
mans irei.ue tly ma le their tombs by
the roads dc. and when the ! odies of
the latter were not burnt they were in
closed in stoti' colitis. So sacred were
t e tombs that they served often as a
place of refuge in times of pcr.se, ntion.
The resting place of the Jews was Bcth
am. For 1 1 1 0 most part they buried
their dead, burning street spices on the
couch where the corose rested. < re
ti niion was, however. not en irtly un
used among them, as reference to the
books of the O and 'lest.uucnt will show.
Of Asa. King of Juda >, it is recorded
“And they bur ed him in his own
sc, u tlior, which he ha i made tor him

in the bed which was filled with sweet
odors and divers kinds of spices ore
pared bv the apothecaries’ art, and
they made a very great burning for

And they took their bones and buried

He w.i not far from thirty-five vearS
of age; his full-nioon face shone out ra
il antly from beneath a shack of warm
hair; one eye pointed due west, Sts

bv north his clothes looked as if they
had escaped from a second-hand store
the bell for his hat long previously had
been rung: he sat down on the edge
of the cha.r to which the sporting editor
called his attention; lie threw his right
leg over his left ku-e, instantly reversed
the action, and then ev dentlv attempt
ed to throw both over at the same time.
Rolling his hat around by the brim, he
spoke;
“Are you busy this morning?”
“Ves, but 1 cau write and talk. too.
at the same time. Fire away!”
“Perhaps I had better call again?”
“No, call now. What is it 3 ”
“Do j-ou want to hire an editor?”
“Editor of what.”
“Of the paper.”
“What department, I mean?”
“Any of them. It don’t make any
difference to me.”
“Possibly it might to the paper. By
the way, where do you hail from?”
“My home used io be in Canada, but
Ive been in Montana for the last three
years.”
“What doing?”
“Cattle ranch.”
“Ah! one of those gentlemen who in
the somewhat inelegant but unmistak
able language of the per-ra-rys is called
a cow puncher?”
“That’s it, but it was on ny own
ranch; that is, 1 bought it, but didn’t
pay for it.”
“1 wish you had bought tw r o or three
of them for me while you were about
it. Well, where’s the ranch now?”
“Gone.”

“Done.”
“Money?”
“Done. The fact is, I made a flat
failure of it, and am dead oroke.”
“\\ hat did you do before you bought
the cattle ranch for nothing?”
“Kept itore down in Canada,”
“How did you succeed as a mer
chant?”
“Busted.”
“Ami what before you commenced to
plodalong the marts of trade?”
“Farmer. When father died he left
me a farm, but I couldn't make it pay,
and so I sold it.”
“And having made a failure in every
thing you have undertaken, you tiow
propose to knock out journalism. How
would my job suit you for a starter?”
“First rate 1 always liked to go to
horse races.”
“Can you tell me when and where
Kansas Chief made his best record,

Madison Square go-as-vou-pleasa in
1881?”
“How should 1 know?”
“Then you won’t do for sporting. If
the star at some of the theaters should
go out fishing some afternoon and
drink so much root beer as to be unable
to appear in the evening, what would

“That closes the doors of the theaters
against you. ‘Seriously indisposed’ is

that your forte is sauntering about the
streets picking up items. Just try that
for a few days. I want to see what
kind of a writer you arc.”
“Oh, I’m a good writer; best writer in
my class, the Teacher used to say.”
Here is a tctal of the cow-puncher"s
first (and last) day's work as a reporter;
“A cool proceeding for a hot morn
ing, while the guests at the Goodwin
House were eating breakfast this morn
ing, a fellow well dressed with one
arm came into the oii.ee and after ban
tering a stranger to trade hats threw
down bis old black cap and picked out
the best hat on the table and walked
off, the writer saw the transaction and
supposed it was a joke until the owner
of the stolen hat came out from break
fast and began looking for the missing
tile you wished me to write up some
artickle of news but having nothing to
report but a hat stolen, as you wanted
the true story in every case, it is very
hard to make news unless you have
some foundation to build on I could
make startlingdiscoveries, and pen you
stufy of blood, or columns of town talk
but you do not want such.” —Detroit

“I want some birch-beer, papa,”
said a little boy to his father, when he
-aw a large red sign in a drug-store
window, informing the public that that
ISevertige could be bad on draught.
“You can't have any,” replied the
parent: “it will sjoilyour dinner.”
“ But 1 don’t want to grow up and be
a bad man,” said the b >y.
“What has birch-beer got to do with
ruining you?” demanded the fatiier.
“A great deal,” replied the boy:
“Don’t you know they say that if you
spare the birch you spoil the child -J ”

Description of a Chinese bride's
dress in the Portland Oregonian : It
was of pale blue hi-long, trimmed with
rare old tovah, while the pantaloons
were of six full lengths of yellow sigee.
Her hair was dressed ala Hong Kong,
there being no bangs of any descrip
tion. Her charming little feet were
half hidden in a bewitching pair of silk
slippers with the heels knocked off.
This vision of loveliness was carefully
placed in a close carriage and driven to
the apartments of tlie bridegroom, who
was wondering what sort of a compan
ion Ids relatives and friends bad se
lected for him.
