Touches on Negro Question and Sug

the Trust Regulation.
(Special to Lake County Times).
Washington, Dec. 3. President
Roosevelt's message to the second ses
sion of the Fifty-ninth congress deals
with a number of new and important
subjects, chief of which is the govern
ment prosecution of the trusts, the
abuse of injunctions in labor troubles,
the negro question, the preaching of
class hatred between capital and labor,
additional legislation for the control
of large eorportalons, a federal inher
itance and income tax law and cur
rency reform.
Tho message opens with a statement
of what the last congress left unfin
ished, and of this he says:
"I again recommend a law prohibit
ing all corporations from , contributing
to the campaign expenses of any party.
Such a bill has already past one house
of congress. Let individuals contrib
ute as they desire; but let is prohibit
In effective fashion all corporations
from making contributions for any po
litical purpose, directly or indirectly.
"Another bill which has just past one
house of congress and which is urgent
ly necessary should be enacted into law
is that conferring upon the government
tne right of appeal in criminal cases on
questions of law. This right exists in
many of the states; it exists in the Dis
trict of Columbia by act of the con
gress. It is of course not proposed
that in any case a verdict for tho de
fendant on the merits, should be set
aside. Recently in one district where
the government had indicted certain
persons for conspiracy in connection
with rebates, the court sustained tho
defendant's demurrer; while in another
Jurisdiction an Indictment for conspi
racy to obtain rebates has been sus
tained by the court, convictions ob
tained under it, and two defendants
sentenced to Imprisonment. The two
cases referred to may not be in real
conflict with each other, but it is un
fortunate that there should even be
an apparent conflict. At present there
Is no way by which the government can
cause such a conflict, when it occurs,
to be solved by an appeal to a higher
court; and the wheels of Justice are
blocked without any real decision of
tho question. I cannot too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in ques
tion. A failure to pass will result in
seriously hampering the goverrment in
Us fffort to obtain justice, especially
against wealthy individuals or corpora
tions who do wrong; and may also pre
vent the government from obtaining
Justice for wageworkers who are not
themselves able effectively to contest
a case where the judgment of an in
ferior court has been against them. I
have specifically in view a recent de
cision by a district judge leaving rail
way employees without remedy for vio
lation of a certain so-called labor
statute. It seems an absurdity to per
mit a single district judge, against
what may be tho judgment of the im
mense majority of his colleagues on
the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional," and then deny to the gov
ernment the right to have the supreme
court definitely decide the question."
ICvavlon by TecbulealltlCM.
"In connection with this matter, I
would like to call attention to the very
unsatisfactory state of our criminal
law, resulting in large part from the
habit of setting aside the judgments
of inferior courts on technicalities ab
solutely unconnected with the merits
of tho case, and where there is no at
tempt to show that there has been any
failure of substantial justice. It would
be well to enact a law providing some
thing to the effect that:
"No Judgment shall bo set aside or
new trial granted in any cause, civil
or criminal, on tho grounds of mis
direction of the Jury or the improper
admission or rejection of evidence, or
for errors as to any matter of pleading
or procedure unless, in the opinion of
tho court to which the application Is
made, after an examination of the en
tire cause, it shall affirmatively appear
that the error complained of has re
sulted in a miscarriage of justice."
Injunctions.
On the subject of the abolition of
Injunctions in labor disputes, he says:
'J my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the Issuance of Injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the mat
ter by the demand that the right of
applying1 injunctions in lobor cases
should be wholly abolished. It Is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
ing altogether the use of injunctions
in Buch cases would stand the test of
the courts; in which case of course, the
legislation would be ineffective.
Moreover, I believe it would be wrong t
altogether to prohibit the use of in-.

Then one of the cops got a

dogs. Of course he may be
wrong and a woman may have

NO SUICIDE IN THE AFFAIR
Startling Cry Proves To Be Woman's
Wail Over the Doomed
Pet Terrier.
A second dog scooped from the bot
tom of the Calumet river yesterday
afternoon by the police after a hard
day's work in dragging the river for
the body of a supposedly drowned
woman, who was thought to have com
mitted suicide by jumping from the
Monon railroad bridge last Sunday
evening, gave a plausible solution of
the mystery that has been stirring
Hammond for the past forty-eight
hours.
Investigation now centers on the
person who committed the "dog gone
murder." and the possibilities are that
he has been hiding in Hammond some
where yesterday and enjoying the ex
citement that he has created.
As Mr. Watklns is hired by the Erie
Railroad company to guard the bridge
and give warning to approaching
trains, it cannot be expected of him
that he be a professional in things
peTtaining to suicide matters.
But he may TBtill Toe correct when
ne says mat lie neara a woman s cry
last Sunday evening which ended with
tne words, "in here. The woman
may have taken the little fox terrier
in her arms and cried over him like
one would over somebody that is dear
to one and when she thought she had
cried enough over him, she may have
wound up her wail with the words "in
here," as she tossed him into the Calu
met.
Mr. Watkins says that for a time he
heard no more, which, by applying the
Sherlock Holmes principle, is also very
plausible, as the dog was too surprised
when he first struck the dirty waters
of the Calumet river to make another
sound for a time. As for the woman
she evidently walked away in order
not to be a witness to the "crime
that she had committed.
She could not have gone very far
when the dog began to bark. He
barked for two reasons. First of all
he wanted to get out of the Calumet
river as it, in that particular place is
very, very dirty, the slaughter house
having for years emptied its filth into
this very spot.
He couldn't sink very easily as the
water was too thick and occasionally
he found a place where he could walk
on the water, but soon he would again
be stuck, While he was struggling
hard to follow his cruel 'mistress she
drew farther away from him and his
bark became more desperate, until, in
hi3 exhaustion, it finally died down
and the dog in his hopelessness, gulp
ed down several mouthfuls of th
Calumet water, closed his eyes and
resigned himself to the inevitable. He
was after all a lucky dog. His body
was found soon after his death.
The fate of the one that was found
late yesterday afternoon, and which
evidently was drowned some time ago,
was probably just as cruel as that of
his brother.

TO filfflUL ' MARRIAGE
tamuj questions Validity of Wed
ding and Sends Scouts to As
certain the Truth.
Fred Memhard, tailor's modet and
thoughtless kid, is strictly in the
hands of his relatives and they are
trying to rescue him from the clutches
of Lucille McLeod. Miss McLeod's
clutch is not so particularly secure at
that and It is not on record that she
cares much.
Fred Memhard is a good looking.
well-bred boy, who had more of the
romantic turn than agreed with him.
In his sober senses he might not have
thought of acting as a "fall guy" for
Miss Lucille McLeod on the eve of her
trial for the murder of a man whom
she knew not wisely but too well.
Memhard did not consult his friends
before he espoused Lucille McLeod.
He recently had been divorced from
Miss Blackman with whom he had
lived happily until a disagreement
grew out of childish pique. Whether
Miss Blackman divorced him or wheth
er he divorced Miss Blackman or what
the grounds were had little to do with
his meeting the girl whose trial was
pending.
Went the Pace.
His life from the time he was sep
arated from his first wife until he hook
ed up with Miss McLeod was a series
of drinking bouts. He was careless of
his companionship and was Inclined to
be a "real devil.". -Hof - road - many.
street car visits to Hammond during
the summer previous to the fatal Oct.
27. lie had a few friends here who
besought him to behave. He came
sometimes with men of careless mood
and sometimes with young women out
on a lark.
Introduced Miss McLeod.
The last of the latter he introduced
in Hammond was Miss McLeod. None
of his friends here recognized in Miss
McLeod the young woman who was
about to stand trial for the murder of
Nieman. Farther away from that was
the idea that he contemplated marry
ing her.
When Memhard came out to Ham
mond to marry Miss McLeod, which
he did with license and judge, he kept
aloof from his friends, whether by ac
cident or design.
If he was in the same condition at
the time the ceremony was performed
as he was on occasions of his pre
vious visit to Hammond with Miss Mc
Leod, it is possible that he did not
realize what he was doing.
In any event the marriage appears
to have fulfilled the prophesy of the
old adage which concerns itself with
hasty weddings and the leisurely re
pentance, which is alleged to invari
ably follow such escapades. The lat
est phase in the case has developed in
the spiriting away of the hero of the
romance to the fastnesses of the Ozark
moutains, far from the maddening
crowds, ignoble strife, and what is
more to the point, twenty-five miles
from the nearest railroad station.
This fact was brought out by a visit
to Hammond yesterday of two persons,
who claimed to be a sister and uncle
of the bridegroom, and whose mission
in this city was to ascertain the valid
ity of the marriage, of Memhard with
the McLeod woman. They said Mem
hard's actions had cast some doubt in
their minds as to whether he had really
married the girl. He would not deny
the union, they declared, but on the
other hand, he had refused to confirm
it.
Claim He "Was Drugged.
When shown the records in the case
which attested to the marriage having
been performed, they explained that
it was their belief that the bride had
drugged Memhard and while he was
under, the Influence of these agencies,
she succeeded in getting him to stand
for his part in the ceremony.
Memhard's absence in Missouri they
explained was for . the sole purpose
of avoiding a meeting with his wife.
The uncle said Memhard had come
home a few days before his marriage
dazed, and had escaped while still in
that condition, and was married. On
these grounds they will seek to have
the union annulled.
The question of the validity of the
couple's marriage was raised once before
In a query to The Lake Cocntt Times
over the long distance 'phone. On
that occasion The Times satisfied Itself
that the ceremony had been perform
ed by recourse to. the records.
A significant fact pointing to a pos
sible mistake in that line seemed to
have been the absence of Memhard
from the court room during the trial
of tho McLeod woman. The dramatic
effect upon the jury was thereby lost
to some extent, but there is no doubt
the report of her marriage had helped
some in. gaining Miss McLeod'a acquit

COMMISSI DECIDES
Body Meets Today at Springfield-
Other Obstacles Overcome and -
Work Progresses.
For the past some time the Chicago,
Cincinnati & Louisville road has been
in hot water, not knowing how It
would cross the Pennsylvania tracks in
West Hammond. About three weeks
ago the matter was referred to the rail
road commissioners who met today at
Springfield, 111. 1
The Chicago, Cincinnati & Louisville
road wanted to put in nn lnterlocker at
the Pennsylvania crossing but thla,
when taken up with the Pennsylvania
oftlcials resulted in a flat refusal. They
said that if the C, C. & L. wanted to
cross its tracks they would have to
cross overhead which would mean an
expenditure of thousands of dolars and
would also delay the completion of tho
road over a year. On the other hand,
if the railroad commissioners decide to
let the C, C. & L. put in an lnterlocker.
they will have their road completed to
Chicago by the first of the year.
In speaking to a Times reporter thla
morning, one of the officials of the
road seeking permission to cross, said
he thought the commissioners would de
cide In favor of the C, C. & L., when
they realized the enormous expenss
and losa of time to which the latter
would be subjected.
The new road has made satisfactory
arrangements with the Monon and
Chicago Junction roads for crossing
their tracks'and now the only' thingr
that bars their progress Is the ques
tion ol the Pennsylvania crossing. -Last
Saturday tho Monon. tracks
were crossed and by this evening tha
tracks to tho state line will be com
pleted. Should the railroad commis
sioners refuse the C..C. & L. permission
to put in an lnterlocker, it will prob
ably run its trains over the Erie tracks
until the overhead crossing is com
pleted. In speaking of the up to date depot
that the new road was to give Ham
mond, the official sail that as soon as
the road is completed so that the C, C.
& L. can bring material over its own
road the depot will be built, and that
the reports to the effect that they will
not build an up to date depot here, ara
false.
De France Fights Hard to
Purge His Name of
Blood Stigm?
Crown Point, Ind., Dec 4. The trlat
of Duffy De France on a charge of
having caused the death of George
Young of Ainsworth, is the center of
attraction in the circuit court today.
Yesterday was consumed in hearing
the state's evidence, much of which Is
of a technical nature. The trial is a.
very difficult one, as it bristles with;
medical terms. The defense is making
a strong fight on the contention thai
any injuries received by Young in th
fight between him and De France did.
not cause his death, and is endeavor
ing to show that Young's physical con
dition brought about his untimely end.
The two eye-witnesses of the "scrap
who testified at the preliminary hear
ing, have left the state and their tes
tlmony will not be received.
The following is the list of Jurors
who will render a verdict in the cae:
Elwin T. Dickinson, Low
Merritt Kelsey, Lowell.
Albert Foster, Lowell.
Frank Prcst, Hammond.
Dan Calnon, Cedar Lake.
Wm. Hayden, Lowell.
C. Kraus, Hammond.
Jos. A. F.eattle, Crown Point.
Jos. Sutter, Schererville.
W. L. Funkhouser, East Chicago.
Herbert M. Esty, Creston.
Frank Parks, Whiting.
A motion to quash the Indictment
was sustained In the early stages of
the trial, owing to a technical erro
in the wording of the Indictment as
returned by the grand Jury. An affi
davit charging De France with man
slaughter was substituted by the prose
cution rather than wait until tha
grand Jury could be called and a nev
indictment returned. The trial was
begun immediately. States Attorney
Boone is assisted' in the prosecution by
Attorney J. Frank Meeker, and th
defense is being locked after by At
tornvs Conroy and McAleer.
