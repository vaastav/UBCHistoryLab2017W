Services Were Held Jointly by Bap
tist, Presbyterian, Methodist and
Grace Eptscdinl churches Thurs
day Morning.
The annual union Thanksgiving
services of tho congregations of the
Presbyterian, Baptist, Grace Episco
pal and Methodist churches wa. held
in the Episcopal church Thursday
morning at 10:30 o'clock. Tho ad
dress was given by Rev. W. H.
Swift, D. D., pastor of the First
Presbyterian church. Tho text was
from Psalms 100:4.
The church was packed on
Thanksgiving morning to hear the
eloquent sermon and the special mu
sic by the choir. Dr. Swift's words
were highly patriotic and in sneak-
,iu ul juiuiiiuiiuu no tsaiu mat inas
much as the foreigner was called up
on to do three-fourths of the work
in many lines of the country's man
ufacturing, it was the duty of the
church to Instruct and inspire in
them the patriotism that every Amer
ican feels. Immigrants should not
be disbarred; but they should be
helped along and taught the ways of
Americans for their help is needed.
" Thankfulness is only another
name for thoughtfulness," he said,
"'and is largely the result of habit.
Optimism, the disposition to take the
most hopeful view of the situation,
because we believe God is on the
throne, and proposes the highest
good. It comes from thinking sane
ly and forming the habit of seeing
the bright side of things.
He reviewed the effects of Holland
on our early government, since the
landing of tho Pilgrims on Plymouth

Tectly from Holland.
"That Is the best keDt Thanksciv-
ing Day," he said, "which sees the
conservation of the brain and heart
and will be tho erection of monu
ments not of granite and marble
"but institutions instinct with life and
blessings whose influence shall
mould and shape the coming citizens
for unselfish service. Patriotism ex
presses Itself in the moral and in
tellectual development of the com
munity. No narrow horizon must
shut us in to-day.
"The Stnrn nnil RtHnoa ova ot
.home wherever Christian education
and the Christian religion are per
mitted and take the land and fill It
with churches. The truest patriot
ism is Christian patriotism. We do
not, he said, put the flag above the
cross, but we do claim that he who
understands what the cross means;
he who reads aright the mission of
the church; he who has confidence
In our holy religion and believes it
to be the divine inspiration designed
to maKe earth what It should be; to
finally dictate legislation, is just as
loyal to the flag that floats over him.

DARING HOLDUP OF FARMER,
SHOT BY UNKNOWN MEN.
A daring holdup occurred on the
Crystal Lake road, near the falls,
about 'a mile and a half 'from Car
bondale, at 6:30 o'clock Wednesday
evening, in which Abel Tompkins,
a Greenfield farmer, aged forty-two
years, was shot in the left breast. He
is now at the Emergency hospital,
and unless complications arise, will
recover. The bullet entered tho left
breast about one Inch below the
heart and across to the right side.
Mr. Tompkins had spent the day
in Carbondale, whero he disposed of
a large quantity of Thanksgiving
fowl, and was returning with the
receipts of his sale when the holdup
took place. At the place of the
holdup it Is very dark and he was
driving slowly when two men, with
arawn revolvers, stenned in front
of his team and under threats of
death ordered him to "hold up his
hands." Instead, Mr. Tompkins laid
the whip on his team and drove
away, the bandits firing four shots
after him, only one of which struck
him. Mr. Tompkins drove to the
hotel of Joe Sheeck, a short dis
tance farther on the same road and
was then brought back to Emergency
hospital.

FRED BROWN GOING DOWN FOR THIRD TIME
IS RESCUED BY FATHER IN IACKAWMEN
Fred, four-year-old son of Minor
Brown, narrowly escaped drowning
last Sunday morning in the Lacka
waxen river at White Mills. The
father had taken his automobile to
the river to wasn it. He was accom
panied by his son and two other little
children. They played about the ma
chine and on the ball field nearby,
while Mr, Brown busied himself
about tho machine. Looking up
shortly afterwards to assure himself
that nothing had happened to tho
children, Mr. Brown noticed that
only two little tots were there and
his son was missing. t Mr. Brown at
once began to scan the river. About
half way out he saw something float
ing upon the surface of the stream.
PEOPLE ACCUSED
OF UNCANNY POWER.
Early In 1911 a deputation from
one of tho larger towns of West
Africa, brought two prisoners, fath
er and son, before the commissioner
at Oban. They were accused of hav
ing, in crocodile form, killed two
women while the latter were cross
ing the river. As they refused to
swear their innocence on the domi
nant ju-ju of the town, they were
brought 'before the "whito man,"
who naturally decided that there
was no case against them. Tho
deputation, however,1 had not finish
ed with the matter. On returning
home another ju-ju was invoked,
with tho result that the son confess
ed that both he and his father were
guilty, and that they had killed and
eaten seven other men and women.
Strangely enough, people accused
of this uncanny power nearly always
acknowledge their guilt, even when
fully aware that such confession
will probably cost them their lives.
Awa Ita, an old woman of Oban, was
suspected of being a "snake soul,"
and of sending out her familiar
every night to lick a wound on her
husband's ankle while he slept, and
INFURIATED DEER CHARGED ON HUNTER AND
GAVE HIM A NINE-MILE
Vernon Rider of Kingston had a
thrilling adventure while hunting
deer a few days ago, says an ex
change, when he rode nine miles
through the dense forest on the back,
of an- enraged buck. After following
the animal for several hours Rider
got a shot at the buck and missed.
Tho deer was in an open space and
charged. Rider did not dare run
and stood for the buck, which rush
ed head down at him. To keep from
being gored Rider seized the en
raged animal by the antlers- and
the deer's head in rising threw the
hunter astride the back. Locking

SUFFRAGISTS IN CONVENTION
AT NATIONAL CAPITOL.
Washington, Dec. 1. The National
capital of the United States is the
scene this week of the most spectacu
lar Woman Suffrage convention ever
held. Six hundred women are gath
ered hero for the forty-fjfth annual
convention. The women realize that
tho phychologlcal moment Is at hand.
Illinois, a strategic State in the U. S.
map, has given over a million women
a vote for president; the question Is
up to tho voters in four states, and to
the second Legislature In tho import
ant States of Now York, Pennsylva
nia, New Jersey and Iowa. The con
vention is being held simultaneously
purposely with the convening of the
regular session of Congress.
Plans are completed for a large
committee of National Suffrage lead
ers to go to Congress when President
Wilson reads his message. For
months he has been receiving peti
tions from suffrage organizations in
all parts of the country asking him
to urge In his message the passage
by Congress of the pending constitu
tional amendment enfranchizing
women. It Is expected that he will
make Woman Suffrage a part of the
Democratic program for this session
of Congress. The other important
political part of the big gathering of
suffragists is to be the hearing on
Wednesday before the House Rules
Committee on tho question of form
ing a woman suffrage committee in
the House similar to the one al
ready existing in the Senate. The
speakers for the suffragists at this
hearing are to include Dr. Anna

EQUITY PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT
BY C. O. LOZIER AGAINST OF
FICERS OF CLINTON, AIRED.
Ask to nnvo Issuance of 3S Shares
of Stock to Wilniortli Cancelled
nnd Thnt Now Ofllcers bo Elected.
A hearing ot the suit in equity
brought by C. C. Lozler against tho
Clinton Cut Glass Company, C. H.
Wilmarth, James H. Stranahan and
R. M. Terrell, defendants, was heard
before a special sitting of court Fri
day, Judge A. T. Searle presiding.
The hearing commenced at ten
o'clock and finished up shortly after
four o'clock that afternoon. Attor
neys P. H.'Iloff and C. A. Garratt
represented tho plaintiff and Mum
ford & Mumford the defendants. Tho
Court set aside Monday, December
15, as a date for the final arguments
'before it.
On September 27th last C. C. Lo
zler, through his attorneys, filed a
bill in equity against the officers of
the board of directors of the Clinton
Cut Glass Company. They chargo
that on or about March 1, C. H.
Wilmarth illegally conspired with
James H. Stranahan and R. M. Ter
rell to have issued to himself a cer
tificate for thlrtv-five nhfirpa nf ho
capital stock of the corporation at
par. A resolution was adopted at
tho next meeting and all voted for
,the Issuance except J. C. Perry. The
payment of the stock was to be ap
plied on the bank note of $4,500 held
at that time by the Dime Bank, re
ducing the same to $1,000.
C. C. Lozier charges that the is
suance was illegal and that no cash
was paid into the treasury in pay
ment of the stock issued to C. H.
Wilmarth.
The bill avered farther that if C.
H. Wilmarth was longer permitted to
hold the offices of President, Treas
urer and Director of the company,
he wdiild eventually absorb and take
over, all the property and assets of
tho' corporation.
The plaintiff claimed also that no
notice of an intention to issue addi
tional stock was given him prior to
the issuance of tho thirty-five shares
to C. H. Wilmarth.
Many witnesses were heard for
both sides. Tho contention of tho
defendants was that it was absolute
ly necessary that they sell the thirty-five
shares to Wilmarth at that
time in order that they could take
care of the note in the bank, but
the plaintiff attempted to show that
tho note had nnt hfon rprhinml nnrl
had gone to protest on May 5 and
was not seuiea up until September.
The defendants claimed that it
would hpi ahsnliifnlv Im
the company to pay Wilmarth back
ior me, snares or stock and have
them cancelled nt. fhln tlmo TVn
defendants' witnesses were Glen Wil

HAWLEY YOUNG LADIES
GO OVER EMBANKMENT.
Tho Misses Calrabacher and
friend, Mr. Whalen, all of Hawley,
were precipitated down an embank
ment near the home of Fred Houth
on the Honesdalo road near Whito
Mills Saturday night. The young
ladies are both injured, especially
Elslo Calmbacher, who may have in
ternal injuries. She was taken to
the office of Dr. E.' B. Gavitte. An
examination was made, but no bones
were found broken. She, however,
received a severe bruise near tho
spine, but it was not injured, Miss
Calmbacher being able to move her
limbs.
The young ladles and gentleman
were returning from a dance held in
the Hoptasoph hall. As they had
started toward their home they met
another rig. Mr. Whalen turned out
to allow it to pass and in doing so
