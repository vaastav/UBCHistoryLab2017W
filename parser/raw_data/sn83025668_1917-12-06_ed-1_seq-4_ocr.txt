At the opening session of Congress

The death of Hon. Wm. E. Chandler
of New Hampshire at the advanced

stalwarts of the Republican party, as
well a the father of the present
United State Navy, for it was during
the years when Mr. Chandler wa the
efficient secretary of the navy that the
"White Fleet" was commenced, start
ing with the "Dolphin." It was our
pleasure to be standing upon Brooklyn
Bridge and ee the so-called "White
Fleet" make its first appearance as a
fleet in the water of New York har
bor, when the boats slowly steamed
under the Brooklyn Bridge into the
Brooklyn Navy Yard, the fleet being
headed by the "Dolphin." ,
o
Among those recently promoted in
the Regular Army we note the name
of Capt Calvin P. Titus to be a major.
Titus was at one time a member of
old "K" Company in Bennington and
later was in the Regular Army and as
such a member was in China at the
time of the Boxer Rebellion when the
allied armies went to the relief of
Pekin. It was at that time that the
young private gained International
fame as being the first "over the top"
of the walls of the ancient city of
Pekin. For this act he was mentioned
in general orders and later on received
an appointmnt at Went Point, from
which later on he graduated. There is
Btill room for good men in the army.
THE NEW ENGLAND DIVISION
It is now pcrmited to record the
arrival in France of the New England
ivision of the National Guard, which,
without a word of press chronicle, ex
cept a furtive and almost unconscious
betrayal of one regiment's departure
from Framingham, sailed from Amer
ican ports in September and in early
October, and which before the end of
October had all safely arrived in
France.
It was in reality a strange episode
in our history, that this little army
representing the cream of young New
England manhood, the tquul and
equivalent of that brave banil who de
parted from our cluster of oldest
Suites in 18(11, with sound of trumpets
and proud exultations then, should
have gone forth now without a word,
without the beat of a drum, while at
the same moment we were paying end
less attention to the small details of
the organization in the draft camps of
that slower army which will not de
part on the same road for months to
come.
In the camps of concentration, the
little groups of relatives of the young
soldiers our bravest and best blood
of our blood and heart of our heart,
the very eenter of our hopes and de
sires assembled upon private notice,
and marched with them in silence to
the stations, standing while the trains
rolled forth in darkness on an un
known way. The moment was epic,
and will live in our history. But then
the great world knew it not at all.
Then came the long wait for new8
of the safe arrival on the other side.
Of that we heard but furtively too.
But it was heard and known. We
knew how the boy stood guard at the
mast-head, watching on the rolling
wave for the enemy. We knew that
their feet pressed the soil of France
at last Something we knew of their
transfer to the training grounds. At
last wa are assured officially of the
arrival of which we already knew.
And though we may not yet publicly
locate them we know that they are
ready there, hard at work in their
places, and continuing the gloriou
record which their fathers made upon
so many fields.
What a brave itory it will make
some time I Little by little now, but
perhaps some time grandly and epic
ally, the record of the assembling and
departure and arrival of the New.
England division will be made. We
mut be content with glimpse. But
the boy are there, and we know that
the mere light pf them inspire our
brave allie to new and resolute en
deavor. The old and famous organix-
but we remember the tirne
or.
ations are all there, blended in a new
and solid mass, the armed front of the
universal Yankee nation. But here in
New England, we shall think of them
a Individuals, as the immortal Ones,
gone forth one by one out of a thous
and hom; we see them thus even
those who may never come back
With ever-youthful brow tht nobler
show ;
We find in our dull road their shining
track;
In every nobler mood
We feel the orient of their spirit glow
Part of our life' unalterable good.
