Shows Right of State to Provide Separate
School for Japanese
Professor William C. Jones Says Highest
Court Decision Sustains It
BERKELEY, Dec. 7.— Professor William Carey Jones, head of the de
partment of jurisprudence of the State University, an eminent lawyer and
et one time deemed the most likely successor to President Kellogg as the
head of the University of California, declares that California has the right
to regulate Japanese attendance at the
public schools. In a statement for The
Call he paid today:
While I <!o not regard . the most Important
question raised by the President to he the legal
or.c of the power of the State to segregate the
race? In the public schools, that Is the onljr one
r.hont which I Khali undertake to write. Then,
et to the legal question, that seems to hare
tcree tspeets:
1. Whether California has a right under ex
isting circumstances, leaving out of consideration
«ny special occasion, to require attendance of
cifTerent races In separate schools.
2. Whether the State would have that right if
the Japanese were given the right of naturall-
ZRTlon end actually became naturalized.
.". Whether a treaty couM be so framed es to
preclude the State from requiring attendance
at fcersr&te Bchools.
It baa been h*>ld in a number of decisions in
State court*, including Massachusetts, New York,
Otto, Indiana. Missouri. Illinois *nd California,
that State legislation providing for separate
*~hocls for \u25a0whites and negroes was constitutional
«nd entirely within the province of State action.
The eosTpntlrn against soch legislation wrs that
"t was in violation of the fourteenth amendment,
especially the clause that no State shall "deny
to any person wit&ia its Jurisdiction the equal
protection of the lawr."
The clause of the fourteenth amendment
which esys that "no. State shall abridge the
rrivllepes or irarauu'.ties of citizens of the United
State*" cannot be evoked. It Is not s privilege
of Federal oitizpcsLip, and cot being a Federal
r!?ht, cannot, as such, come under the protection
rf the amendment.
The quesiUm turns upon the word "equal."
tnd it has been <;<vid o d acaln and again that
vqual" does net mean •'identical." It does not
nenc that white and colored j>ersons must be
nrt-ht In the Kane Ffho>4s.

taxation is a matter belonging to the' respec
tire Stales, and any interference on the part
of Federal authority with the management of
such schools cannot be justified except In the
case of a clear and unmistakable disregard of
riphts secured by the supreme law of the
land."
This disposes of both the first and second
aspects of the question.
. As to the third p->iut. namely, the power to
alter this situation b.r treaty provisions, so far
as the rishts of the State under the constitution
are concerned, a treaty has no greater power to
affect them than an act of Congress. Both
treaties and .Federal laws can be enacted only
in pursuance of the constitution. The constitu
tion says that laws made In pursuance of the
constitution end treaties made under the author
ity of the Cnlted States, which authority is
only derived from the constitution, are the su
preme law of the land — that is to say, only such
laws and treaties as are made under the author
ity of the constitution are to the States.
If the fourteenth amendment does not author
ize Congress to legislate over schools and other
matters reserved to the States, no more does It
authorise the treatr-maklnc nower to do so.
Hence. If California is legally light In proridinff
separate schools for different races, as uniform
Judicial authority says it is, then this lepal
right cannot be taken from It. either by opening
the doors of naturalization or by treaty stipula
tions.
JAPAX'S AMBITIOX •
Consul General Miller Says It Is to
Attain Commercial Supremacy
BERKELEY, Dec. 7. — Japan was
characterized as a peace-loving race,
and not as a warlike nation, by Henry
B. Miller, American Consul General at
Yokahoma. In an address delivered to
the university students and faculty
this morning at Harmon HalL Miller
Informed the university audience that
Japan's most notable characteristic is
not a fighting tendency, but a strength
displayed in the industries and in art.
The Eastern nation's purpose to de
velop its manufactures. Its shipping,
its commerce, was declared to be more
In evidence than any indication of mar
tial spirit.
Japan proposes dominating the Pa
cific, according to Mr. Miller, and Is
well on the way to succeed, with a
merchant marine that promises to serve
the purpose. The Japanese will suc
ceed in this, said the speaker, unless
the United States makes extraordinary
progress In a direction where scarcely
any start has as yet been made.

Urges Students to
Oppose Yellow
Dominance
BERKELEY. Dec. 7. — Professor: Sa
muel B. Christy," dean of the college of
mining, startled the members of the
senior class at the ( university at their
annual banquet last night in Senior
Hall, during the course of a speech by
him", when he advised the youths to re
gard the State of California as a pre
cious, heritage, rightfully, their own,
but in danger at some time in the fu
ture of usurpation by the people- of an
alien race. He told the listening univer
sity men that It rests with them to de
termine whether in the future this State
shall" be dominated by: their descend
ants, or by Orientals. He prophesied a
conflict for control here.
Professor Christy was a guest of the
seniors last night, with a few other
prominent members of the faculty, in
cluding President "Wheeler. In his
speech to the collegians Professor
Christy described the glories of the
State of California, and said:
"It will depend on the character of
the work you young men do whether
our civilization survives in the conflict
that is to come. , It rests with you to
determine whether the people In con
trol shall be your descendants ; or." the
descendants |of ; Orientals. .The .- civllza
tion of the Orient has awakened to new
life. The people" of ; that part of the
world look for new fields to conquer
and possess. They undoubtedly will
plant their feet here, and if you are to
hold domain you must prepare for a
conflict with them, and meet their com
petition in every way. It is a great task
for you, and one worthy of your best
powers."
DESCRIBES ORIEXTAX MALADY
Control General Miner Advises Educa
tion Board Regarding- Trachoma '
"While gathering: facts relative to the
segregation of the Japanese and white
schol children.* Henry Miller, American
Consul General at Yokohama, gave the
local Board of Education much inform
ation relative to the dread eye disease,
trachoma, which generally ends in total
blindness. Miller said that 50 per cent
of the Japanese making application to
leave Japan as emigrants were afflicted
with the malady and that many slipped
by the immigration unde
tected when the symptoms of the dls-'
ease had not yet» manifested themselves.
This information has caused the
Board of Education to issue orders to
all teachers to observe all Japanese
students carefully.
Trachoma is a highly contagious dis
ease. It makes its appearance first on
the upper eyelid in the form of granu
lation. It Is likely to spread from chil
dren using the same towels or coming
Into general contact. Heretofore school
children who have possibly been unac
quainted with the symptoms and the
nature of the disease have not taken
careful note of the Japanese attending
the schools. "Where glasses are worn
It is very difficult to detect the disease
and afflicted children could remain : in
school many months before their true
condition would be discovered. .
The steps taken by President" Alt
mann of 'the board and by the other
members is not in' any way the result
of the recent agitation ' in- school mat
ters, but is taken purely as a precau
tionary and health measure.

GREENWAY DANCE A
MARKED SUCCESS
Brilliant Event Attended
by the Largest Number of
Guests in Club's History
MUSIC IS A FEATURE
In, direct contrast to the gloom of the
weather last s night was the brilliancy
and gayety of the Greenway dance in
the palace Hotel. Never before was
there so large a membership' in the
club as this year, and nearly 300 so
ciety folk were present last night at
the ball, which was all that might be
desired in the way of a success. The
music was exceptionally' good, even for
a Greenway dance, J. TV. Byrne and
Miss Jennie Crocker each having
brought back from Europe and New
York some of the latest compositions.
Brilllant-hued polnsettias and potted
palms were used in decorating the
ballroom. -
Despite-the rules sent out with the
Invitation? as to arriving early, there
was but little change from former oc
casions, and it was nearly 11 o'clock
before the last of the guests had
reached the festive scene. There was
an air of apology visible, however, and
there was a strong disposition on the
part of the late comers to lay the blame
on the. carriages which "\u25a0were so late
getting there."
Among the many matrons beautifully
gowned was Mrs. Henry T. Scott, who
wore black velvet with insertions of
black lace over white silk, with a ber
tha and ruffles of point lace. Her or
naments were diamonds.
Mrs. Frederick Sharon was robed in
white chiffon, with insertions and
ruffles of lace, made over white liberty
satin. - L.
Mrs. Margaret Irvine was gowned
in- lavender brocade, trimmed ! with
quantities of white lace, and having a
girdle of mauve satin.
Mrs. Hyde-Smith was charming In
black net and chiffon over black silk.
Baroness yon Schroeder wore black
spangled net and white lace. Mrs. Alex
ander Garceau wore a gown of black
lace over pale blue silk, with a girdle
and garniture of cloth of gold. ' Mrs.
James TV. Keeney's gown was of black
lace, spangjed and having .a bertha
of white lace. Mrs. Eleanor Martin
wore white moire, embroidered In lav
ender and gold spangles, and trimmed
with flounces, bertha and ruffles of
Russian point lace.
Miss Helen Chesebrough wore white
crepe de chine, trimmed with pink and
white pompadour silk in an effective
mode. Miss Anita Harvey was robed
in pale-blue chiffon, embroidered . in
pink rosebuds. Miss Marjorie Josselyn
appeared in white chiffon, trimmed

CHICAGO POLICE TO
FORM A UNION
CHICAGO. Dec 7.— Chicago's . police
men are to b© unionized. Organized on
lines similar to those of all the labor
unions throughout the country and af
filiated with the Federation of Labor,
the policemen will shortly take the
field, and, according to the authority of
a high official of the Chicago Federatioa
of Labor, who refuses to be quoted,
will become real organized labor by
January 1.
The benevolent character of the or
ganization maintained for years by tho
police force is to be discarded.
j "What action the cjty authorities may
take has been thoroughly discussed by
the police promoting the movement, and
the backers of the plan express them
selves to be confident that nothing can
prevent the fulfillment of their project.
"With the city firemen and school
teachers already organized and affili
ated with the central body, the police
unionists sge no reason why their or
ganization should not receive the sanc
tion of the municipal powers as well as
all labor bodies in the city.

The growth of cities isn't so
rapid now as formerly.
j
The idea of concentration of
population isn't so popular as it
was. The rush to the cities has
materially decreased.
The electrification of railways
has caused the change: it's so
easy to reach the city from the
suburbs.
Fares are cheaper because of
tyie smaller capital invested and
smaller expense of operation.
The United Railroads run their
big, comfortable cars from Fifth
and iMarket Streets every twenty
minutes on week days and twelve
minutes on Sundays — to Burlin-
game Grove Station. The
Peninsula Electric Railway, now
building, will bring competition
with its through express trains ;
the Bay Shore cut -off, almost
completed, will bring passengers
from Burlingame Grove in twenty
minutes, to the center of the city.
Lots are selling rapidly at $550
—better.- select your homesite
now, before the rise soon to come.
Cottages are being built, for
sale on easy payments, same as
the lots.
The lots are 50 x 120 feet. "All
improvements made at expense
of seller.
Call at this office for full -in-
formation.
Spend Sunday at Burlingame
Grove, breathe the dry air, enjoy
the sunshine, the exhilaration of
the country, make up your mind
on the ground.
