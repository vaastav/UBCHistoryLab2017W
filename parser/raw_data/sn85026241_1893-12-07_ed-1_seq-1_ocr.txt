A LARGE ESTATE
A LARGE ESTATE In the West Belonging to a St. Clairsville
Lady.
Senator Nichols returned Monday from
a ten days' trip West in the interest of
Mrs. C. V. Grove, of this place. Mrs.
Grove is the owner of three-fourths of a
body of land comprising over 5000 acres.
The owners of the other fourth were rep
resented by E. B. Brown, of McConneUs
ville. The estate has been in such con
dition that its real value was not known.
It is situated in Missouri and Iowa. Over
one-half lies in Shelby and Bolles coon
ties. Mo., on the line of the C, B. & Q.
Railway, and about 40 miles from Quin
ct, I1L It is some 40 miles also from the
Mississippi River, entirely removed from
the bluffs and malaria of the great
stream. A tract of 2500 acres almost
surrounds a flourishing town on the line
of the Burlington Road.
For the purpose of division estimates
were agreed upon by Senator Nichols and
Judge Brown, making the land worth
$60,000. This valuation is very low. Even
in the present stringency it would bring
more than that amount, if put upon the
market The gentlemen were exceedingly
successful in tbeir division, as it was
made without any court costs without
even a survey and so made that only
one-half mile of line fence will be re
quired. In addition to this, each quarter-
section is left accessible to public high
ways, and the share of each party in the
2300 best acres is left in one body. All
parties are well satisfied with the divis
ion, and deeds have been accordingly ex
ecuted. The land has an annual rental of from
$3500 to $4000. It was bought years ago
by Jacob E. Grove, by him willed to the
American Bible Society, and after ex
tended litigation, divided between the
Society and Mr. Grove's kinsfolk by com
promise.
Live Pigeon Shoot.
The live pigeon shoot given by the
Gnn Club, Thanksgiving Day, was inter
esting and drew many spectators. Harry
Boron bad been for many moons collect
ing pigeons, and was master of ceremo
nies. The upper part of the speed ring
at the Fair grounds was used. The birds
had to be shot while flying, and unless
dropped inside the ring did not count
The result was a surprise. About one-
half the pigeons, although two shots
were fired at them,arose away up, took an
observation, and after a wide sweep or
two started on a bee-line for home The
other half were victims. The shoot in
detail is given below:

Ladies In The Court Room.
Ladies who visit the court room during
the trial of cases should be prepared for
almost anything in the way of bad lan
guage. Saturday a witness in the Wil
son case beiug called on to tell what he
knew, said that what he had heard was
not fit for ladies to hear. The attor
neys told him to go ahead, whereupon he
repeated a lot of horrible blasphemy and
obscenity, which proved that he spoke
truthfully when he said it was not fit for
ladies' ears. Courts are interested in get
ting at the exact truth. The euphemisms
ot polite society have no place in the
trial of criminals. Criminals are rather
forcible and picturesque in their words
than polished, and the narration of any
criminal cause is apt to be filled with
profanity.
A Pound Box.
At the Methodist Sunday-school, Sun
day, Mrs. Webb, talking in the line of the
lesson, said that on a recent visit to
Cleveland, she had been present at a
meeting of church people, held for the
purpose of devising ways and means of
issisting the numerous and Buffering
poor of that town. The destitution, said
Mrs. Webb, is something unprecedented
and is heart-rending. On motion, there
fore, the Sunday-school decided to tend
to the church people of Cleveland a box
of food. So that all might bring in some
thing4t was arranged that the gifts should
be by pounds. Each person is able to give
a pound of something, and with many
such small bits a large box may be tilled
How It Caught.
At the burned house of R. M. Wilkins,
Monday, a fire was put in the furnace
which stood in the cellar. Smoke poured
out of a hole at a point in the chimney
which before the destruction of the house
stood just below the roof, showing very
clearly, that the fire originated in a
defective flue. The furnace was not so
badly injured but that it may be used
again. 1 be piping lor the steam, how
ever, was destroyed.
In the case of Ohio against Ross Fitch
and Frank Andears, in which the men
were accused of stealing beer from a box
at the B. & O. depot, and recognized to
the Probate Court, upon the payment of
the costs, the men were discharged.
Everybody threw off his costs to make
the burden as light as possible for the
boys.

William Wilson Found Guilty of Manslaughter
and Gets a Heavy
Sentence.
The echoes about the court house cor
ridors were awakened Wednesday morn
ing at 4 o'clock by a sharp rapping on the
door of the room in which the jury, hav
ing tne Wilson murder trial in hand,
were confined. The verdict, given a few
minutes later to a hurriedly summoned
court, was manslaughter.
As soon as court convened in the regu
lax morning session, Wilson's attorneys
made a motion for a new trial. This was
overruled. The penalty for manslaugh
ter is imprisonment one to twenty years,
at the judge's discretion. Judge Driggs
sentenced Wilson to a term of nine years
at the penitentiary. It will not be known
before Saturday whether the case will be
taken to a higher court.
The case was begun Friday morning,
and was stubbornly fought for four days.
Prosecutor Hollingsworth and " Albert
Lawrence appeared for the State, while
Capt Danford and Tbos. Shay, a criminal
lawyer from Cincinnati, conducted the
defense.
It will be remembered that Policeman
Murphy was shot to death in a fight at
Martin's Ferry, September 1st, between
some men and boys of that place and
employes of a traveling circus. The
fight occurred at the circus cars, and
Wilson was the only man arrested. He
lives at Peru, Ind, and was the keeper
of animals for the show. His defense
tried to show that Wilson did not fire the
shot that killed Murphy, but that it was
fired by a man on the circus car. Fail
ing in this, they expected to show that if
he did fire the shot, it was done while he
was dazed and stupefied by having been
knocked down and pounded about the
head with a " black-jack," and after hav
ing been shot at by officers whom he did
not recognize as officers, but believed to
be persons seeking his life. It was shown
that the circus people had not been the
aggressors, but that they had been insult
ed and attacked.
The jury evidently thought that Wil
son fired the fatal shot, but considered
the circumstances as mitigating.
An especial assault was made on Mar
shal West wood's testimony, and four St.
ClairsviUe men testified that the Marshal
said on the evening of the trouble that
Wilson shot from under the car, a state
ment which he denied on the stand. The
stories of the witnesses for either side
varied, and it seemed impossible to get
at the truth of the matter. The jury had
to take the stories as the come, and form
their own judgment as to the reliability
of them. . .
The case was argued all day Tuesday.
Mr.' . Lawrence" opened " forthe'SEate,
speaking logically and eloquently for an
hour and a half. He was followed by
Mr. Shay for the prisoner. Mr. Shay's
speech was exhaustive and pathetic. The
wife and child of the prisoner sat beside
him, and Mr. Shay, with tears in his eyes,
pleaded the mercy of the jurors, amid the
conflicting stories of the testimony. He
went over the case thoroughly, and spoke
about four hours. Captain Danford then
took up the defense, and in an ingenious,
eloquent and profound argument poiated
out every scrap of evidence in the pris
oner's favor, the uncertain nature of the
testimony and enlarged on the discrep-
pancies In the stories of the witnesses.
Prosecutor Hollingsworth closed the ar
gument with a strong presentation, neces
sarily shortened by a bad cold. Judge
Driggs read a clear charge to the jury.
and they went to their room at 9 o'clock.
The trial attracted many spectators to
the court room.
Has Had Experience.
Henry Shearer, the man convicted of
larceny in the Common pleas court, last
week, has had a varied and exciting ex
perience, according to his own story. He
claimed bis home was in St Louis, Mo.,
where he was born and reared but for
several years had been a wanderer over
the face of the earth. He had worked
aboard ships on the ocean for a time,
and was in no less than half a dozen
shipwrecks, once on a vessel that burned
to the water's edge in mid-ocean. He
had clerked in a pawn shop in his native
city, had ran the gauntlet of the Indians
on Western plains, had journeyed to San
Francisco on freight trains, has a de
pression in his skull caused by bricks
hurled by the cyclone blast, and withal is
hearty looking and comparatively
young man yet He contemplates lead
ing a retired life for a time. Cambridge

THE WINNERS
In Guessing Contest as to The Official
Vote.
B. R. Johnston wrote last week to the
Secretary of State asking him what the
vote for McKinley was at the late elec
tion. Mr. Taylor replied that it was
433,342. On Monday, therefore, a com
mittee consisting of C. W. Carroll, Dr.
Talbott, D. II. Milligan and Mayor Ked
non.opened the ballot box in which those
who bought a ticket to the last Fair had
deposited their guesses as to what the
vote for the successful candidate for
Governor would be, and examined the
guesses. The box had been locked
up at the St ClairsviUe Bank. It was
found that there had been 1832 guesses
made. James T. Bentley, of Bannock:,
won the first prize, a Folding Bed, with
his guess of 433,333 only 9 from the ex
act mark. W. H. Henderson, of St
ClairsviUe, came next with a guess of
432,648, and won the Oak Extension Ta
ble. The third prize, an Oak Rocker.was
won by Emma Wilson, with a guess of
434,254. Many guesses were close to
these winners, as E. L. BramhaH.

A Great Majority of Them.
An analysis of the returns of the late
election gives the following interesting
information. Of the 734 officers elected,
including Senators and Representptives,
the Republicans secured 531, the Demor
crats 200, and Populists and Republican
Fusionista 3. In 1892 the Republicans
elected 208 officers and the Democrats
215. Of the 89 probate judges one be
ing to fill a vacancy the Republicans
captured 65, the Democrats 23, and the
Republicans and Populists combined
elected their candidate in Mercer county.
The Republicans secured 67 of the com
missioners-elect to 23 by the Democrats;
64 of the infirmary directors are Repub
licans, while 26 are Democrats.
The other county officers elected are
divided politically as follows: Auditors,
16 Republicans, 16 Democrats; treasurers,
41 Republicans, 20 Democrats; clerks of
common pleas court, 46 Republicans, 14
Democrats; prosecuting attorneys, 36
Republicans, 11 Democrats; recorders 22
Republicans, 6 Democrats; coroners, 29
Republicans, 14 Democrats. An inde
pendent Democrat,indorsed by Republic
ans and Populists, was elected to the
auditorship in Mercer county.
A New Law.
It may not be generally ' known, says
an exchange, that the last Legislature
passed an act to enable land owners who
have sotthe mone-to pay their -taxer
for any other reason do not want to pay
them, to authorize some other person to
pay them and hold a lien ' on the land
until they are reim bursed. The owner of
the land must fill out a blank certificate,
which can be obtained at the Recorder's
office, giving a description of the land
upon which the taxes are to be paid, and
he must then acknowledge it before an
officer in the presence of two witnesses.
This certificate must then within ten
days from the date of the payment of the
taxes be filed in the Recorder's office for
record, by the person authorized to pay
the taxes. - When the certificate is so
filed, the amount paid with 8 per cent.
interest per annum from the date when
the taxes were paid shall operate as a
a first lien upon the property described
in the certificate, and may be recovered
at any time after the expiration of one
year by an action at law the same as in
cases for the forclosure of mortgages.
The Valley Road.
The Cadiz Republican' says: When the
Valley Railroad gets ready to extend its
line to the south, from its present termi
nus at Valley Junction, it has two routes
of which to make choice. It can come
through Cadiz and St. ClairsviUe and thus
make connection with the Baltimore and
Ohio Road, or it can go by way of Free
port to Morgan Junction, in Guernsey
county, and thus make connection with
the Baltimore and Ohio Road. It has a
good coal field on each route. The Bal
timore and Ohio Road owns a controll
ing interest in the Valley Roard, and its
southern extension will connect with that
Road somewhere.
That the Freeport and Morgan Junc
tion route is seriously talked of there
can be no doubt. It would be a little
shorter line to the Baltimore and Ohio
Road than by Cadiz and St ClairsviUe.
Its cost of construction would be about
the same. The route to be adopted will
depend largely upon the inducements
held out by each, as to right of way and
local aid. These are the facts which will
have to be considered by every man who
wants to see the road come his way.
Thinning Out.
The saloons in Bellaire are thinning
out and this month will see from fifteen
to twenty 'per cent, of them closed. A
few years ago there - were sixty-two
saloons here. The Dow law tax and
other things reduced the number to about
forty-five, and now it is down to thirty
six and will probably go to thirty by the
20th of this month, when another half
of the Dow tax is due. But most of those
that continue will continue if the tax is
put at 8500 instead of 8250, as is now
thought probable. Bellaire Item.

OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
The New Free Trade Bill To Be Hurried
Throughâ€”Many Interesting
Topics.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 4, 1893.
The Wilson Tariff Bill is out of the bag,
and the country at last knows just what
the committee has been doing. It has
aroused a good deal of comment and
the wave of criticism that has swept
down upon it from many sections, does
not seem in any way to disturb the se
renity of Mr. Wilson in the slightest de
gree. The protests from his own dis
trict against placing coal on the free list
had no effect whatever, and it joius bands
with iron ore, lumber and wool. It is
good thing for the country that the bill
is at last made public, and although not
nearly as radical as the rank free traders
would like to have it, it is much more
radical than it will likely be when it be
comes a law. There will be some heavy
firing all along the line when the bill
comes up, and there are many Democrats
who think the bill goes entirely too far
Just how far the President will endorse
the present bill will probably soon be
developed, as it is expected the message
will give a broadside on the question that
will not be hard to understand. It seems
to be the intention of the friends
of the bill to get it through both
houses of Congress, and to the President
by March 1st, as to give it a chance to
work awhile before the next fall
elections, and also to give the business
world a chance to know what is what, as
soon as possible. It will require lively
work to do this, but the rules of the
House are so arranged that it can be
done without any great delay if the Dem
ocratic members hang together. Right
there is where the rub comes in. There
are so many members of the majority
side of the House whose ' districts are af
fected differently by this bill, that it will
will probably require a party caucus to
keep them in line, and that might not
hold them. When a man gets a seat in
Congress, he generally likes to hold on
for awhile, if it is possible; personal in
terests are stronger than party ties even,
and party ties are -strong enough. But
the influence of President Cleveland
upon his party is a powerful one, and if
he indorses the bill in lota, it will greatly
aid the leaders of the bill. ' As to the
Senate, we do not take much stock in the
prediction that the bill will be defeated
there. The Senate is Democratic, and
the Populist Senators will almost to a
man supports tariff reform (as it is call
ed) measure, and there are three or four
Western Republican Senators who desire
a lower tariff.andthey will balance all loss
among Eastern Democratic Senators
lJiretjtxiU.beJi.tusale, and. we can count
on one thing the great mass of the Re
publican Senators will not be found with
the administration in the support of this
bill, as they were found in the silver
battle . '
By-the-way, the silver battle is to be re
opened as soon as Congress meets, it is
said. A determined effort is to be made
to change the - present condition of the
silver question. It is said that Senator
Voorbees will be one of the leaders in
more legislation for silver, and will keep
his promises made in debate on the floor
of the Senate, that as soon as the repeal
bill was passed be would enter the fig!
for more silver legislation. It is already
seen that he is not with the administra
tion on the Pension question, and recent
ly in his own State, has declared himself
squarely opposed to the pension policy
of Hoke Smith. It was supposed that the
President had an able ally in Dan, who
would stand by him through thick and
thin, but Dan has been home, and the
indications are that he has a desire to
keep his own fence in good trim.
The fight that has been - made for so
long against Mr. Powderly in the Knights
of Labor organization has finally been
successful, and Powderly is down and
out The man that made the order what
it has been, has been overthrown by the
very men whom he made prominent That
the end of the great order is near at hand
seems to be the general opinion here.
James R. Sovereign, of Des Moines, who
has been elected to Mr. Powderly's late
position, is Labor Commissioner of the
State of Iowa, appointed by Gov. Boies.
He is an able man, and no doubt all his
abilties will be used to keep the order to
gether, but it will probablv be a useless
task.
The death of Charlie O'Neill, the fath
er of the House, who died at bis home in
Philadelphia, has cast a gloom over the
city in which he was so well and favora
"bly known. He has been a continuous
member of the House since 1869. He
Was a business member, and a hard
worker. He has long been a member of
the Committee on Commerce. Mr.
O'Neill was a bachelor, and was famous
for his great love for children. He is
said to have known every man, woman
and child in his district
The death of Uncle Jerry Rusk, who
became such a familiar figure here dur
ing President Harrison's administration,
most sincerely regretted. To all ap
pearances when he left here, Uncle Jerry
was good for a score of years yet, but his
case only goes to show how uncertain
life is. His native State had honored the
old gentleman highly, and was especially
dear to all Grand Army boys. But he
has gone, as so many of the old veterans
are going year by year.
The circular of ex Secretary Fairchild,
of New Yprk, calling for a reorganiza
tion of the State Democracy of New
ork, is the first gun in the new move
ment of the Cleveland wing of the New
ork Democracy to overthrow the Hill
Democracy in the State. It seems to be
settled fact that the administration is
bent on the overthrow of the Hill organ
ization in the State. ' With a Governor
ship at stake it would seem to be bad
party politics to enter into a party fight
for next year. Dan Lamont is said to be
the slate as the administration candi
date. If this is to be the program it
ly proves again what has been demon
strated before, that President Cleveland ,
is
by
is not a' practical politician. Dan La
mont cannot be elected Governor of New
York, nor come within one hundred
thousand votes of it Dan is a very good
and has a clean record, but Tam
many will not touch him. It is true they
voted for Cleveland, but this fight, if we
judge Fairchild's circular aright, is to be
a fight to the finish, and it means ruin
to both sides. Republicans can well af
ford to stand off and watch the coming-
battle. There is suie'y music in the air
The appointment of Washington Hesing
as Postmaster of Chicago has aroused
the Democracy of the windy city into al
most a fighting condition. Frank Law
lor, an old line Democrat from way back,
had the largest list of indorsements that
any candidate for any office ever had in
the history of our . government The
President's disregard of the desires of
the Democracy of Chicago, and the ap
pointment of Hesing is said to be simply
because Hesing, as the leader of the Ger
man element of his State, was very suc
cessful in carrying the State for the De
mocracy in 1892. As to its results upon
the coming election for Mayor in Chica,
go, no one can tell. Grover Cleveland
has a way of his own, and he cares very
little or seems to care little which way
the tide goes, whether in or out
lhanksgiving has been celebrated
again, though many may have asked the
question, What have we to be thankful
for? the bitterness of many trials and
troubles during the year past remaining
still with us. But we can trulv be thank.

A Fatal Accident.
At East Liverpool Friday a frightful
accident occurred, resulting in the death
of one young lady and the serious injury
of several others. A party of about
twenty were returning home from a
social at a late hour and - hailed a street
car. The moterman told them that the
car was the last one and would run only
to tne power-house, a short distance.
They did not board the car, but to save
distance, started . across the railway
trestle. When about the middle a car,
running at a a tremendous speed down a
steep 1 grade, came into sight ' Before
they could escape it was on them. All
the party but one jumped from the
trestle, a distance of twelve feet, but one
lady, Mrs. Harsha, became bewildered
and the car struck her, killing her. Some
of the others were badly bruised. The
car could not be stopped owing to the
steep grade.
