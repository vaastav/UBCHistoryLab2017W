A Spokane man advertised that he had a $250,000
fortune, which he would divide equally with any wo
man under 35 years of age who met his requirements
of a wife. He is 59 years of age
and of course on the shady side of
life and concluded he would follow
in the wake of other "old fools"
and get a young girl for a wife

Mad
even if he had to give her the necessary dough before
hand. His advertisement had no more than been put
in print before telephone and telegraph applications be
ban to pour in on him, these were followed by swarms
of women applying in person and the women by thous
ands of letters until the "old fool" was much nearer
he insane asylum than he was the hymenial alter.
He finally took to the woods for a bit of peace of mind
and since that time has not disclosed his whereabouts.
In the meantime, however, the mails are being worked
over time by the women. All of this proves how
wretchedly money mad the American women are and
further demonstrates that they would marry the blue
imps of the devil if he had the money to lavish on them.
Women so money mad as these women seem to be has
very little regard for an unsullied character.

Any where in the East, North or South if one desires
to attract special attention to himself announce you are
recently from Seattle, which is your home, and before
you can realize it you are the center of attraction and
the target for questions galore. Seattle is simply on
the tongues of a great majority of every body you meet
after crossing the Mississippi river. In other words the
friends of Seattle talk more about it and do more boost
ing for it than the real Seattle folk."

Not even a prospective war with Japan could be more

an ideal ruler even before, but there is no doubt now of
him becoming the ideal ruler of the world. Nothing to

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1909.
B United Slates Supreme Court Judge David J.
ewer is not opposed to the combination of capital,
through which certain men amass vast fortunes, but he
thinks that men who acquire such
riches should be liberal toward re
ligious, educational and charitable
inf titutions and do as has Rocke
feller and others give liberally to
them. In other words permit a certain few to combine
their moneys and crush out all small competitors and
then rob the consumers until all concerned are so rich
that Cresus of old would look like the proverbial thirty
cents with a hole in it and the people unable to either
have a sufficient amount to eat or wear and in that con
dition let the rich dogs meet out small quantities to
them in the shape of alms. It is perhaps contorting
Judge Brewer's ideas to make him reach such a con
clusion, but look at it in any light you will or may such
results would be inevitable. The combination of cap
ital, which will result in a corner on the market of the
necessities of life, can not result in anything else but
privation to the masses and nothing should be done in
this or any other country that would permit a privilege
class to spring up.

"There is no danger of Socialism gaining any very
strong foothold in the United States because there are
too many young men who want to be something and
would not be satisfied with the
conditions that Socialism impose
of its adherents," so said Charles

E. Hughes, governor of New
York and who was likewise a for
midable candidate for the Republican presidential nom
ination as a successor to President Theodore Roosevelt.
It is hoped that Socialism and its dogmas will never
succeed in this country, but unless the men of this
country, who have succeeded in "being something,"
adopt a more liberal policy toward those who are trying
to be something there will come about a mighty revolu
tion. There are no royal apes in the United States of
the kind found at European courts, but the money
kings simply squeeze the life out of the poorer classes
and then make them stand up in public and say they
like it. "Being something" in the United States sim
ply means getting together a great bunch of money
which in most instances is criminally used.
Congress is once more grinding away, it having
convened last Monday. President Taft's first message
was like all other presidential messages full of meet for

Sgle time of after each shall

the very first bills to be introduced in Congress was one
to direct the president to use all force by land and sea
to chastise Nicaragua for the killing of two subjects of
the United States and to have the president of that be
ligerent little republic punished for the same. Then
the buncome bills began to pour in and among them
was one introduced by Representative Humphrey to
appropriate $500,000 for the Lake Washington canal.
Mr. Humphrey feels that he has political troubles at
home and took this early opportunity to begin to hedge
for the next election. Every Congress promises to be
the most important in the history of the country and
this one is no exception to the rule.
Seattle folks were brought face to face with the
proposition of the white race intermarrying with a
dark race when Mark Ten Suie, a Christianized China
man asked his Christian pastor to
Kirry him to a white woman and

affair so much newspaper notor
iety that no other white preacher would dare brook
puhlic opinion and perform the ceremony. The rela
tives of the girl, who up to that time had registered no
protest to the union, at once implored their daughter
and sister to break off the engagement despite the fact
the license had been issued. This Chinaman had
been a member of the First Methodist Episcopal church
of Seattle for the past thirty years, he had mingled
only with the white members of that church for all
those years, had contiibuted hundreds, of dollars to its
support, has in every respect demonstrated that he is
all that a pure Christian gentleman should be, gives
every evidence of being more the white man than the
Chinaman and yet he was ridiculed out of marrying the
girl he loved and who seemed to love him by his Chris
tian associates and all on account of race prejudice.
Races have mixed and mingled since the races were
first put on earth and to such an extent that one or the
other and often both have been completely lost and
why not this. If the while race is so weak as to go to
pieces by the intermarrying with a darker race then it
is already tottering to its fall and the sooner it falls the
better. But this is not a fact for the white race will
lose nothing by intermarrying as in this case and it
looks as if some one was straining at a gnat and swal
lowing a camel.
It too frequently happens that officers of the law
either elected or appointed to enforce the law as they
find it on the statute books either do or do not enforce
tas they themselves feel as to the
forcement of such a law. They
:ally disregard the fact that it

is the law, and enacted by the
lawing making body of the land.
They put their judgment up against the entire legisla
ture, the governor and the people. What right has
any officer of the law to refuse to enforce any law?
For months slot machines have been running all over
King county without molestation although the operating
of such gambling devices meant a penitentiary term if
the operator was convicted by a jury of his peers and
there was no interference on the part of the executors
of the laws. The officers of the law in this instance
did not do their plain duty and have no greater excuse
for not doing it than that the law did not meet their
approbation. Just such cases as this frequently hap
pens, which has brought about a general disregard for
the law all over the United States such as can not be
found in any other civilized country.
If any one has gotten the idea that the dark
skinned citizens of the United States are unmindful of
the memory of those patriots to the cause of Negro
emancipation, in which some lost
their lives and which precipitated
the Great Civil War such doubting

ings held all over the country last
Thursday in memory of John Brown, who gave up his
life that they might be free. It was the fiftieth anni
versary of that memorable occasion. In Seattle last
Sunday afternoon the members of the Sunday Forum
paid glowing tributes to John Brown and his co-work
ers, but especially to John Brown. In a few weeks
more, January Ist, the Lincoln's page of history will
be turned over and again the black folk will demon
strate their appreciation of the men who stood in the
gateway and advocated their freedom.
"Yes we shoot the niggers, we burn them at the

sacrificing- of a million innocent
Northern men's lives as was the case in the Great
Civil War and it would be a sacraledge for genuine men
with brawn and brain to die at the hands of the white
barbarians of the South, who sit about in supine idle
ness year in and out and study border outlawry. But
every lynching and burning at the stake of defenseless
Negroes, but further beastalize those already brutal
border outlaws until some day they will again take on
the defiant attitude of before the war, when again
something will have to be done. Its but another more
desperate effort to keep the nigger down, but the day
may yet come when even the Negro will be given an
opportunity to return the barbarous treatment which is
almost daily administered to some member of the race,
in kind. Suppose the Japanese should attack the United
States and seek an alliance with the American Negro,
what would the consequences be?
