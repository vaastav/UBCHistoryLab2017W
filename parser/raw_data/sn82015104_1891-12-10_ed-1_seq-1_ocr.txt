E SKA!. QUESTION.
In view of tin- reports which had been rc
cei**s I •■ diminution of the seal herds
in BehringSea, i deemed It wise to propos to
j ler Ma.: ■ rumen;, in February last,
that an agreement for a closed season should
nding tbe negotiations for arbitra
tion, which then seem< d to be approaching ;i
favorable conclusion. After much coi resp nd
and delays, for winch this Government
do! responsible, on agreement was
reached on the 15th of June by which Great
tain undertook, from thai date and until
.L, 1892,t0 ptoblbit the kilting by her
usinßehrirg Sea, and the Gov
« rnmenl of tbe United Stats during tbe same
period to enforce Its existing prohibition
against pelagic sealing, and to limit the catch
by the but Seal » Ompany upon the islands to
7,500 skins. If this agreement could bave
n reached earlier in response to the strenn
endeavors of this Government it would
have been more effective, but coming as late
i did, it unquestionably resulted in greatly
c minisning the destruction of seals by Cana
dian sealers.
in my last annual message 1 stated that the

The receat political disturbances in the Re- :

i ne information we possesse i was too n r
to enable as to form a satirfactoiy judgment
oi the causes i,-» t diii(f to the temporary as

ronseca. but this Government did not fad to
express to bim its anxious solicitude for the
peace <>i Brazil,and for the maintenance of
the tree political institutions which hud been
recently established, nor to oiler our advice
thai peat moderation should be observed in
theclash ot partus in the contest for leader

has been re-established without bloodshed.
NEW OKJ.KA.VS INCILKNT.
The lynching at New Orleans in March last
of eleven men of Italian nativity by a mob of
citizens was a most deplorable and discredita
ble incident, it did not, however, have its
origin tn any general animosity to the Italian
people, iinr in any disrespect to tne Govern
ment of Italy, with which our relations were
oi the m>..si friendly character. The ;ury of
the mob waa directed against these men as
the supposed partietpanta or accessories of the
murder of a (Sty officer. 1 do n..i allude to
tins as mitigating in any degree this offense
against law and humanity, but only as atl< cl
ing the internalioi:al questions which grew
OUt ol it.
I! was represented by the Italian Minister
that several of those whose Uvea had b■> a
taken by the mOb were Italian subjects, and
ademand waa made for the punishment of
the panic.p mts, and an indemnity to the
families of those who were killed. I*t is b> be
regretted thai tbe manner In which these
claims were presented was not such as to pro
mote a calm discussion of the questions in
volved, but this may well beattrtouted to the
■ -citemenl and Indignation wnicb the crime
naturally evoked.
The views of this Government, aa to its oi>
ligation- to loreigners domiciled here, were
rully stated in the correspondence, as well as
Its purpose to make an investigation of the
aba:r,with a view ot determining whether
there were present any clreumstanoes that
could under such rules of duty aa we bad In
, create an obligation upon the United
The temporary absence of a Minister
Plenipotentiary at this Capitol has retarded
the further correspondence, but it is not
doubted that a friendly conclusion is attain
able.
some suggestions mowing out of this un
happyincident arc worthy the attention of
Congress, it would, I believe, be entirely
con.p tent ior Congress to make offenses
against the treaty rights of foreigners Uomi
i the Ciiited states cognizable in the
Federal courts. This has not, However,
been done, and the Ft deral officers and courts
have no power In such cases to intervene
either for tue protection or foreign citizen or
for the punishment of his slayers. I: stems
to me to follow in this state ofthe law, that
the officers ot the State charged witn the
poli< c ami judicial powers in snch oases,must,
in the consideration of International ques
tions growing out ot snch incidents, be re
garded in such sense as Federal aeents as to
make this Goverment answerable for tier
acts incases where it w luid b' answerable If
the 1 nlted states had m*g« a its constitutional
power to detine and punish crime- against
treaty rights.
CHILE WAR.
The civil war in Chile, which began in Jan
narj 'ast, was continued, but fortunately with
infrequent and not important armed col
lisions until August Mb, when the Congress
ional forces landed near Valparaiso,and after
oy engagement captured that city.
Pn Ident Baimaceda at once recognized that
- was lost, and a Pro visional Govern
ment was speediiy established by the vic
torious party. Our Minister was" promptly
directed to recognise and put bimseu in com
munication with this Government so soon as
it should have established ade facto charac
ter, which was don.-.
During tiie pendency of this civil contest
frequent indirect appeals were made to thia
Governmenl to extend belligerent rights to
the Insurgents and to give audience to their
representatives. This was declini d, and that
policy was pursued throughout which this
brovernment, when wrenched by civil war. so
strenuously insisted upon tbe part ot Euro
pean nations.
SEIZtTHB OF TIIK ITATA.
The Tia'a, an armed vessel, commanded by
a naval oincerof tbe insurgent Heet, manned
by its saifors, and with soldiers o i board, was
s 'zed ander the process of the United Stages
Courl at San Dv go. Gal., fora violation oi our
neutrality laws. While in tiie custody of an
officer of the c >urt tbe vessel was forcibly
wiestedfrom bis control, and put to sea. ft
have been Inconsistent wi h the dig
nityand seLf-respecl of tola Government not
to nave insisted that the ltata should be re
turned to Sau ihego, to abide the judgment of
■n. This waa bo clear to the Junta oi
the Congressional party established at
Iquique tnat befoiethe arrival of the ltata al
oi i the Betretary of Foreign Relations i f
; the Provisional Government addressed Elear
■ Admital Brown, commanding the Unit d
States naval force.-, a communication irom
which the following is an extract:
"The Provisional Government has learned
by thecablegramsol the Associated Press thai
the transport Ltata, detained in San Diego b\
order of the United .-tales, for tailing on board
munitions ol war and in possession of a Mar
shal, lett the port, carrying on hoard this offi
cial, who was Landed at a point near the coast,
and then continued her voyage, if *his news
is correct this < Jovernmi n*. 'would deplore the
conduct ofthe ltata, and aa an evidence tbat
i* i.s not disposed to support or agree to the
i infraction ol the laws of the United state-,
' the undersigned takes advantage of the i e
tonal relations you have been good enough to
maintain with him sine, your arrival in this
port, I declare to you thai as soon as she la
m reach ol our order, this Government will
pui the ltata, w t:. tiie arms and munitions
she took in San Diego, at the disposition of
Oiti d States."
A. trial in the District Court of the United
States for the Southern District of Caliiornia
bas recently resulted In a decision, holding,
among other things, that Inasmuch as the
Congressional party had no: beea recognized
as belligerents, tne acts done in its interest
could doI oe a violation of her neutrality laws.
! 'mill this judgment the I'nited states has
appealed, not that the condemnation of the
vessel is a matter of importance, but that we
may know what la th. present state of our
law, for, if this construction of the statute la
i i ii:. ,t. there is obvious necessity for revision
and amendment.
OOVKH>\IK.\T'.S POLICY IX Cill I.K.
During the progress ofthe war in chile this
< fov* rnmenl tendered its good offices to bring
b al a peace-]] adjustment, and it was at
onetime hoped that a good result might be
reached. Bui in this we were disappointed.
The instructions to our naval officers and to
our Minister at Santiago, tiom the iirst to the
lastofthis struggle,enjoined npon them the
mosl impartial treatment and absolute non
interference. I am satisiied that these in
structions were observed and that our repre
sentatives were always watchful to use their
Influence Impartially in the interest, of
humanity, and on more ihan one occasion did
bo effectively. We could not forget, however,
thai this Govern—aent was in diplomatic rela
tions with the then esta >lisb< d < fovernment
of Chile, as it is now in such relations with
the successor of thai Govern—sent. I am quite
sure that President Montt, who has. ander
circumstances of promises for the * •
Chile, been installed as President of va
public, will not desire thai tn the unfortunate
event oi any revolt airail:st ids authority the
[policyof ihis Government should be other
than which we have recently observed. No
complaint oftbe conduct of our Mm.
later or of our naval offio rs during the stug^le

isa matti r <•! regret thai so many of our own
people should have given ear to unofficial
;and complaints that manifestly had
their origin In rival Interests, and in a wish
to pervert the relation- of the United States

ousiy wounded, one of whom has since died.
bo savage and brutal was tne assault that sev
era] of our sailors received more than two and i
one as many as eight stab wounds.
An investigation of the affair was promptly :
made bj a board of officera of tbe Baltimore,
and their report shows that them assaults
were unprovoked; that our men w.re conduct
ing themselves in a peaceful and orderly
manner, and that some of tbe police Of the
city took part to the assault and used their
weapons with fatal affect, while a few others,
witn some well-disposed citizens,endeavored
to protect our men. Thirty-six of our sailors
were arrested, and some of them, while being
taken to prison, were cruelly beaten and mal
treated. The fact that they w.re all dis
charged, nu criminal charge being lodged
against any one of them, shows very clearly
that they were innocent of any breach of the
peace.
So for as Iha ye yet been able to learn no
other explanation ot this bloody work has
been suggested than that it had its origin in
its hostility to these men as sailors of the
United States, wearing the uniform of their
Government, and not in any individual act
Or personal animosity.
The attention of tbe Chilean Government
was at once called to this affair, and a state
ment ot the facts obtained by the investiga
tion we had conducted was submitted, accom
. by a request to be advised ol any Other
or qualifying tacts In the possession of the
Chilean Government that might relieve this
affair of tlie appearance of an insult to this
Government. The Chilean Government was
also advised thai if such qualifying facta did
notexisl this Government would confidently
expect full and prompt reparation, it is to be
regretted that the reply of the Secretary of
Foreign Allans of the Provisional Govern
ment was couched in an offensive tone. To j
this no response has been made.
This Government is now awaiting the re-1
suit of an Investigation which baa been con
ducted by the criminal court at Valparaiso. !
it is reported unofficially that the lnvestiga-1
Cionia about completed,and thai the result
will soon be communicated to this Govern
ment, together with some adequate and satis
factory response to the note by which the I
attention ot Chile was called to this incident.
If these just expectations should be disap
pototed, or further needless delay intervene, I ;
will, by special message, bring tins matter
again to the attention of Congress for such
action as ma\ be nee* ssary. Tlie. ntirecorre
spondence with the Government of Chile will
at an early day be submitted to Congress.

there, long prior to tbe confirmation of Spain's
claims to tic i ] mds, ha 1 procured by settle

cognition—nd maintenance of which tbe faith
of Spain was pledged. I have had reason
within the past year very strongly to protest
against the failure to carry oul this pledgi on
the part <>f his majesty's ministers, which
has resulted in great injustice and injury to
the American residents.

ing the fact that the organisation of both
branches of Congress bee been perfected
iv the main details, it slid remains forthe
managers at each end of the Capitol to
supply committees before the fifty-second
Congress can begin the discharge of its
proper functions. Already the managers
of both branches are struggling with, the
problem of how to accommodate each as
pirant for committee appointment with
his personal preference without ,catising
discontent and with dne regard to public
policy.
In the Senate the only contest likely to
be expected is one relating to a committee
of minor importance, that on Library,
where at least three Senators—Stock
bridge of Mississippi, Dixon of Khode
Island and Woloott of Colorado^—are
anxious to succeed the late Chairman,
Evarts. A struggle is possible, however,
over the vacancy on the Appropriations
Committee, caused by i'arwell's retire
ment.
Mitchell, who has been Chairman ofthe
Railway Committee ior two terms, ex
pects to til; Spooner's place as Chairman
of the Committee on Claims. Casey of
North Dakota is as good as booked for
Mitchell's present positio- of Chairman
of the Committee on Railways. Possibly
Wilson of lowa, thongha member of sev
eral hard-worked committees, may be in
duced to accept the Chairmanship" of the
Committee on Education, vacated by
Blair, bnt this rather undesirable place
may be banded over to a new Senator.
Hoar goes by order and preference to tiie
head of the Judiciary Committee, vice

talk of giving Pfeffer a place on the Agri

involved in this, and it may be the Aili
i ance Senator will secure at more desirable
place as the result of eil'orts of Republi
can and Democratic managers to keep
him on their respective side.-,. Nobody
ias undertaken vet to place Kyle, the

expressed views of Lrby, the South Caro

be assigned to a minority representation.
it is said upon good authority that
Speaker Crisp had not up to to-day
' ollered a single eominittee Chairmanship

purely speculation. The Speaker has, to

FATAL FLAMES.
Two Fires at Louisville Cattso tho
Eoss of Many Lives.
Lovisvillk, Dec. 9.—While tho fire
men were talcing away the ruins of the
Boone Paper Company building at 4:30
o'clock this morning, there came the
sound of a terrific explosion in Bam
berger, Strong A Co.'s building, four
stories high. In an instant flames broke
out from every lloor and shot out through
the roof. The fire must have been smol
dering for several hours in the cellar,
and when eacii of the four stories had
been tilled with bested air and smoke the
explosion occurri d.
lt was with great difficulty that tho
firemen prevented the flames from
spreading further. A number of people
were sleeping in the upper rooms, but all
escaped.
A number of hremen were caught un
der the failing wall of Bamberger, Strong
A* Co.'s building. Fire Chief Hughes and
Captain Weatherford are injured. Four
dead firemen lay under the walls and
four others are badly hurt.
Tiie dead are William Moore, William
Davis, Sam Baker and Tony Schlight.
The losses foot up a total "of about $300,
--000.
SJEVEBAI. LIVES LOST.
At 8 o'clock another fatal tire was rag
ingat F. A. Emon .v Co.'s wholesale
candy and fancy grocery house, one
square above the Boone Paper Com
pany's building. The origion of the lire
is a mystery. Forty girts were Bt work
On the fourth floor and ad were not a!.le
100-ape. lh" bodies of six girls have
already been taken out, burned almost
beyond identification.
C. T. Menu, brother oi the senior mem
ber ofthe linn. is supposed to have been
burned to death, and the firemen think
at least five other girls will he found
soon. A thorough search is being made.
The tire cut oil escape by the stairway
leading from tlie fourth floor, where the
girls were at work. Many jumped from
the windows to the second-story projec
tion, and escaped With broken limits and
bruised bodies. Others got ont unhurt.
With its force weakened and demor
alized by the accident of the early morn
ing, the lire Department was called to
the disaster at the candy factory. To
add to the confusion Major Chief Hughes
of the Fire Department was so badly
hurt in the accident Of the early morning
that he may not recover. He and Henry
Weatherford, the ChiePs assistant, while
going to the fire, was run into by the
Salvage Corps wagon and their buggy
smashed. Both were trampled by the
liorses, but the injuries of Weatherford
were not so bad as those of his Chief. A
number of other firemen were badly in
jured at the candy-shop fire.
In the face of these disasters the firemen
stood bravely to their work, and within
another half hour the flames were under
control.
Within this time half a score of lives
had been sacrificed.
The work of searching for bodies in the
buildings destroyed by tire this morning
was still going on at midnight. The
missing firemen are now believed to be
in the ruins ofthe Boone Paper Company
building, wedged between huge piles of
paper that filled the cellar.
The dead recovered at Menne 4 Co.'s
are Lulu Kein, Carrie Luckhardt, Bar
bara Bell, Amanda Dickey, William
Hulsemeier, Charles Kimmel, Clara
Ranch and Ida Parker.
'lhe missing and certainly dead at the
Boone Paper Company are Tom Moore.
Sam Baker, Will Davis and Tony
Schlick, all of No. 1 Hook and Ladder
Company, -lames Weinler and Thomas
Brehulder, who worked at Mennes, were
also missing this afternoon, but their
relatives have not been heard from to
night.
The injured are: Katie McGarvey,
Theresa Holthas. Edward Inninger, Lil
lie Grenwald, Major Hughes, .lames Nut
tall, Patrick sheehy, Alien Grimes and
Henry Wetherford. Fire Chief Hughes
has concussion ofthe brain.
How the fires originated is still uncer
tain. There were only two oiliee fires at the
Boone Paper Company's building, and it
is certain the flames originated at neither.
At Ldenne it Co.'s a number of fires were
burning, but none account for the start
ingot" ihe conflagration.
It is now doubtful if there was an ex
plosion at Bamberger, Sterno A Co.'s,
next door to the Boone Company, at the
time the firemen were caught.
It is thought the total loss will reach
three-quarters of a million.

lie believes tbe Chinese would not attend
the Chinese mission connected with the
church unless they had attractive young
lady teachers. His view i.s that the aw r

school cares little about the Bible, lie
says parents are doing great wrong to
their daughters in allowing thei.i to teach
Chinamen who go to Sunday-school only
to sit beside the girls. He declares tbo
practice is likely to cause trouble, and the
evil should be slopped at once. Dr. Lewis
has appointed a committee to investigate
the management ot the Chinese Sunday
schools, and expects to make some radi
cal reforms.
