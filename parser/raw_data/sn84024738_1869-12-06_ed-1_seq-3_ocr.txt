ivpartment. which resulted in the passage

Commit tec. That committee, after spend-;
?jjj> JlhOlit two years in thorough exaraina
? r. of witnesses (employes in the Treasury
pepartment) and personal inspection of
machinery, hooks, etc., has made a report.
The committee was composed of two sen
ator- .Edmunds, chairman.) and one mem
:er of the House, who appear to have
Tom harmonious and in perfect accord in
their report.
It will he recollected that the charge?
were, in substance, that the affairs of the
vrintinsr and note department were carried
,\n in a criminally reckless manner, result
ing in enormous losses to the people, and
:h.,t it? conduct was so loose and free from
proper checks to prevent rascality as to call

have not been satisfactorily accounted
for: that various bonds marked as "de
stroyed" on the books of the department
are not destroyed, or at least no proof of
destruction is adduced; that the methods
>" accountability and comparison between
the various bureaus in the department, as
u -11 as in their own operations, have been
imperfect, and "in some respects grossly
f in It --" : that it lias frequently happened
: vouchers would be taken for the inter
change of securities on slips of paper, and
civ-n up when settlements would be made,
h aving no recorded evidence of the transac
tions: that in respect to the deliveries of
most of these securities from bureau to bu
reau and from branch to branch in the de
partment no books of aecouut were kept in
the form of debits and credits, and compari
?? n? made and balances struck, etc., and
h.iv- led to considerable confusion, even
-apposing the discrepancies, before stated,
to h ive been the result of merely innocent
f rr r : that cue evil of this lack of accounts,
t :r.. was that in the course of printiugana
transmitting securities to the Register's
ff ?<?, it was the custom to send with each
thousand impressions a quantity of extra
impressions riot numbered, intended to be
used to supply those of the regular mini
? ? r- 1 class, which, from time to time, might
' c e: rouge.usly tilled up or accidentally de
fh'vd. These extra impressions were called
flic "rtock package'," and whenever there
?.'.?.?a-ion to use one of them the bond
or note injured, or said to be injured,
v. ukl be thrown in the tire or otherwise
destroyed, as is stated by the clerks, and
'?no taken to supply its* place from the
"stock package," without any account or
; "ord being kept of the performance, and
without any proof or method of proof of
the actual destruction of the one so actually
r ostensibly disposed of. It is impossible,
therefore, to account except on very vague
evidence for many of the securities that
went into the Register's office.
The foregoing are specimens of the many
paragraphs in this voluminous report, show
ing the so-called irregularities practiced in
the Treasury Department up to last March.
l'p >n careful examination of the report the
r. "ador cannot but be impressed with the
belief that losses have occurred to the

The Pan-tin- Murder?Confession.?The
reader will recollect the intense sensation
caused by the accounts of the horrible mur

hood of Pantin, near Paris, France, about
two months ago. One Traupman was arrest
ed as the murderer. He admitted the deed,
but represented Jean Kinck, the father, as
the principal, himself as an accessorv to the
crime. Jean Kinck or his body could not
r despite the most vigorous searches.
ral}c? llie public interest was aroused
"> the highest pitch, but all inquiries were
unsuccessful. Spiritual mediums were em
ployed, but could elicit no information.
Our news was only fragmentarv, and the
interest ma tragedy without development
subsided. The denouement is now before
us. I he Opinion Rationale informs its
readers tliat Traupman has made a full con
fession. Traupman is alone guilty. "We
give his condensed account of the facts:
After murdering John Kinck, on August
-o, in a plain near .Guebweiler, and burr
ing the body in a place minutelv described
?i- P.ns0"er> Traupman thought of
ridding himself of the oldest son, Gustave,
who had been to Guebweiler to claim from
the post-office an order for 5,000 francs, sent
there bv Mrs. Kinck for her husband. Gus
tave Kinck returned to Paris, was induced
to go to Pantin, and was assassinated two
days before his mother, a few yards from
the ditch which was to be the grave of the
?whole family.
On September 20th, after completing his
preparations, Traupman took the Kinck
fiacre to Pantin. On reaching
me Chennn "V ert (Green lane) he made Mrs.
Kinck and the two youngest children get
out. Alter passing the last houses on this
narrow, crooked, and dark street, tlicv
( came into the plain. The ditch had been
dug in a hollow deep enough to prevent
what was going on in it from being seen
from the Aubervillers road. The fiacre ,
stopped at the corner of the Chemin Vert,
I uid the driver could have no intimation of
what happened at a short distance from
; turn. Traupman seized first the little girl
ripped her open with a knife, and flung her
(stillalive) from a distance into the ditch.
I hen he rushed upon the mother: a short,
terrible struggle ensued, the youngest
boy holding on to his mother's dress and'
uttering piercing cries: but soon the cries
were sueuced. The murderer, to complete
his work, went for the eldest and the two
younger children, who had been left in the
nacre, and suspected nothing. Traupman
sent the two young ones ahead, who walked
with hands clasped towards the ditch, the
older one following a few paces behind them.
1 bis was the strongest one of the three,
traupman commenced with him, throwing
a noose around his neck and strangling him,
cut the throats of the two other;, and fin
ished the old one, who showed signs of
life, with a knife. The rest is known.
In some opening remarks of a course on
geology, which I am now delivering in the

was a hindrance to the understanding of
geological evidence, and no one who started
with this idea, and allowed his researches
to he influenced by it, could be a geologist."

Effect of Railroads on the Weather.?
The opinion seems to be gaining strength
that the Pacific railroad is working a great
change in the cb'mute*)f the plains. Instead
of continuous droughts, all alon? the rail
road rain now falls in refreshing abundance.
This result has been remarked upon in other
sections of the West. In central Ohio, lor
example, it is said the climate has been com
pletely revolutionized since iron rails have
formed a net work all over that region. Iu
stead of the destructive droughts" formerly
suffered there, for some four or five years
there has been rain in abundance?even
more than enough to satisfy all the wants of
farmers. This change is thought to be the
j result of an equilibrium produced in the
j electrical currents, which has brought about
| a more unilorm dispensation of the rain. It
is a fact within the observation of all who re
member ante-railroad times that we have
now few or.no such thunder-storms as we
formerly had in New England. The iron
rails which touch and cross each other in
every direction serve as conductors and
equalizers of the electric currents, and so
prevent the terrible explosions which used
to terrify us in former years. The telegraphic
wires which accompany the iron rails
everywhere also act an important part in
diffusing electricity equally through the at
mosphere, thus preventing the occurrence
of severe thunder-storms.?Boston Traveller,
