Tl K PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE..
[f'omtinmed from Sixth Page.]
?railj known. That the American line* of
*te->m-*hip* h?re been abandoned by n* to an
unequal contest with the aided line* of other
nation* nntil they hare been withdrawn, or. in
the few rases where they are *till maintained,
are anbjeet to vdriou* disadvantage!, is matter
of common knowledge.
The present aitnation is such tbpt traveler*
and merchandise find Liverpool often a necoe
sarv intermediate port between Hew York and
some of the Soath American capital*. The fact
that some of the delegate* from South Ameri
can Htnte* to the Conference of American Na
tion*. now in session at Washington, reached
our shore* by reversing that line of travel, i*
very conclusive of the need of *nch a confer
ence, and very suggestive as to the first and mo t
necessary step in the direction of fuller and
more beneficial intercourse with nations that
are now our neighbors upon the line* of lati
tude, but not upon the lines of established
commercial intercourse.
MAIL SUBSIDIES RECOMMENDED.
I recommend that such appropriation* be
made for ocean-mail service, in American
steam ships, between our port* and those of
Central and South America. China. Japan, and
the important islands in both of the great
oceans, as will be liberally remunerative for the
service rendered, and as wilt eucourago the es
tablishment and in lome fair degree equalize
the chance* of American steam-ship lines in the
competition* which they must meet. That the
American states lying south of us will cordiallv
co-operate in establishing and maintaining such
lines of steam-ships to their principal ports I
do not doubt.
A KATAL RESERVE.
We ahould also make provision for a naval
reserve to consist of such merchant ships, of
American construction and of a specified ton
nage and speed, as the owners will consent to
place at the use of the Government, in case of
need, as armed cruisers. England has adopted
this policy, and as a result can now, upon
necessity, at once place upon her naval li.it
some of the fastest steam-ship* in the world.
A proper supervision of the construction of
such vessels would make their conversion into
effective ship* of war very easy.
A LIBERAL AMD PROGRESSIVE POLICY.
I am an advocate of economy in onr national
expenditures, bnt it is a misuse of terms to
make thia word describe a policy that with
holds an expenditure for the purpose of ex
tending our foreign commerce. The enlarge
ment and improvement of onr merchant
marine, the development of a sufficient body of
trained American seamen, the promotion of
rapid and regular mail communication between
the ports of other countries and our own, and
the adaptation of larg? and swift American
merchant steam-ships to naval use*, in time of
war, are public purposes of the highest concern.
The enlarged participation ot our people in
tho carrying of trade, the new and increased
markets that will be opened for the products of
our farms and factories, and the fuller and
better employment of our mechanics, which
will result from a liberal promotion of our for
eign commerce, insure the widest possible
diffusion of benefit to all the States and to all
our people. Everything is most propitious for
the present inauguration of a liberal and pro
gressive policy upon this subject, and we should
enter upon it with promptness and decision.
The legislation which I have suggested, it is
sincerely believed, will promote tho peace and
honor of our country and the prosperity and
security of the people. I invoke the diligent
and serious attention of Congress to the con
sideration of these and such other measures
as may be presented, having the same great
end in view. Besj. Habiusox.

The North llaptist Church Property.
Messrs. Cole A Cole and A. C. Richards have
filed a bill in equity for Zalmon Richards to en
join sale, nullify a deed and for a decree for
title against Brown, Glass and others. The
complainant states that he held the property
now occupied by the North Baptist church un
der a lease, and in 1875 he assigned the lease to
E. H. Gray for the purposes ot a church, and,
although the consideration recited is ST,600, he
did not receive a cent. The church having
been sold uuder the action of the Columbia as
sociation and ceasing to be used as intended he
claims that the property reverts to him.
