Monday crowd In tbe galleries of the House of

with members. At flvo minutes of 12 Mr.
' Crutebfleld, the Speaker's Clork, entered tho

Carlisle, and Is tho same to Mr. Heed. No man
better understands parliamentary practice

dary. A minute after CrutchOeld'a appearance
the blind chaplain entered the House and
ioatod himself near the (treat silver mace,
h noaker Heed walked in from tbe lobby as tbe
hands' ot the clock pointed to hlali noon. He
s'owiy climbod thoEtops to his desk and seized
the navel. After a sharp rap bo said:
"Tho Houso will bo In order. Prayer will
now be offered."
' Tho Itov. l)r. Jos. Krnusknpf of Philadelphia,
and pot the blind preacher, officiated. He
prayed for the Amei lean poople with an earn
estnees that caused a few Conerersmon to look
at oaeh tfther ineurprlse. As the prayer closed,
the usuul Ytn-o of confusion swept over the
House. It drowned tho voice ot Clerk Martin,
Vfliu rpud the journal.
"If thero Is no objection tho journal will
stand approved," eald Speaker Heed. After ii

It lu bo ordered."

Major MeKlnley trlted tbe House Into Com
mittee of the YYIiolo toonnslder his proposition.
The lesolutlon had to lie conaideied In such
eommltteo before It could bo pasaed by the
House. Isano It. Hill. Deputy Soritcant-nt-Arms,
ynhked down tho nroat silver maco. to
show that tbo House, wns in committee.
Hpenker Hoed selected the Hon. Julius Cnsar
Durrows of Kolamaroo to preside oier the com
mittee. Mr. DnrrowK came down tbe main
nialo and uscended the rostrum. Ho woro n
daric putt, a riocic opnt, a modest sold chain,
nud n cheery Miiilo. H jrraspod tbe cnxel as
thouch he knew how to use It. Ho announced
that tbe Houso was now In tommltteo for the
consideration of a resolution which tbo Clork
wonld rend. As tbo resolution had just
boon read In open Houso, Major MeKltiley
naked unanimous consent to airenee with It
reodlnc in committee Mr. Itowell bt lllmoK
however, olilootod. Tho resolution was read n
second time, and Major MeKlnley moved its,
adoption.
ltlKht nt this point Gn. Spinola's head shot
from Its linen barrier. He hod observed that
tbe Major's resolution proposed to rnter appro
priations inrcoust defences to the Commllteo
on Appropriations. The Coneral wne n mom
berof tbe Military Cotiimtttoo or the Piftleth
ilonHrem. That commlttoa made n Dorce
flelit to retain its juitdtct!onoer these ap
propriations. In a stentorian voico the Con
oral renewed tbe flnht this nlternoon. Ho said
that tho Committee oil Appropriations was of n
srasplni: natuie. He bcuibcU It of sordldnusa.
Ibe coast detenco appropriation rlehtly be
lonsod to tbe Committeo on Mllltnty AiTolro.
He oloiod by movibK that they be reterrod to
that committee.
Gen. Cutoheon of Michigan, who was also a
momber of tho Military Committeo in tho last
ConeresB, upheld Uon. Bplnoln. Ho fiiild Unit
in the Forty-elshth and Port -ninth Corciof boh
noproprlations for fortllloatlonH wont to tbo
Military Committeo. It hid been rot) bod of Its
jurisdiction in the Fiftieth Conirress. There
was no Military Committeo hero to-day to as
sert ittolt It bad not been appointed by, the
Speakor, The Committee on Appropriations,
however, was here, armed cap-a-pte. and ready
for the fray.
While Gen. Cutcheon was speaklog a pane
brouuht a hope map down tho aisle. It wai
rolled up. ana was as lone as a llfhlnc rod.
Thomapwaspronpedmtutusttho dosk of tho
Hon. Henry Clay livans. tbe now Chattanooan
e ember. It swayed to and fro while Mr.
vans rrankod it to a constituent Aftor a pase
bad oarrlod the franked nrtiole out luto tbe
lobby Major MoKlnley becan to defend tbo
Committee on Ways and Means. He said that
it bad only followed u procodent set by the last
Coneiosa. The proposition to refer tbe, coast
appropriations to tho Committeo on Military
Affairs hnd caused n hot discussion in that
Uonsross, and the roattor had boen sent to tho
Committeo on Appropriations by Mr. Blount
of Qeorcia. who was at the time ocoupylnu the
Speokurs ohnlr. .
Major McKlnley's mild reply, stung Oen.
Hpinola anew. He eald that tho Committeo on
Military Affairs was beaten last year because
tbe able debaters were on tbo side nt the Com
mute on Appropriations. .The Military Com
mittee bad been driven to the wall, nnd it had
gone there smiling. Itwouldflebtto u bitter
end. He could not see why measures for pub
llo defence should be sent to the Committee on
Military Affairs, and measures for coast de
fence sent to tbe Committeo on Appropriations.
In bis view coast defence was Included in pub
llo defence. The General moallled his amend
ment so as to send the appropriations for forti
fications to tho Committee on Appropriations,
and tho appropriations for const defences to
the Committee on Military Affairs. Tbls re
versed tbe situation in the last Congress.
The General's modification brought Speaker
Carlisle to bis foot He said tbo question was
ono of tbe jurisdiction of tbo House. Pormerly
all appropriations remained with that commit
tee. The adoption of the elevonth and twelfth
rules last week renewed the jurisdiction of
that committeo. The Committee on Ways and
Means bad simply oboyml thoeo rules In mak
ing its present recommendation. Mr. Carlisle
was opposed to splitting the jurisdiction of the
two oommlttees. He nUd that alter shuro de
butts in tne last Congress tho House bod twice
sent theolstmtod appropriations to the Com
mittee m Appropriations.
Gen. Spinola's modified amendment was then
voted down, and Major MoKlnley's original
proposition wos carried. TheMajorthon moved,
that tho committeo rise and report the bill to
the House with a favorable recommendation.
This motion was carried, nnd tbe great silver
inaoe was again placed upon its pedestal,
bpeaker Heed took the chair. Mr. Burrows de
scended the steps, marched around to tbe arena
In front of tbo dosk. atrd reported to the Speak
er tbe action of tho committee. The House)
then adoptotTthe resolntlon.
Mnjor MeKlnley offerod a joint resolution
providing for a. holiday udjournment from Fri
day. See. 20, to Jan. C. It was adopted. The
Major next sent up a bill to simplify tbe laws
in relation to the collection of revenue. The
Major bos been stirring the tariff broth, nnd
this Is tbe result. It I a combination of the
administrative part of the Bennte Tariff bill
and tbo Mills bill ot last year. There is soma
fresh seasoning In tbe way ot thyme and other
condiments, which will appear when tbe bill Is
printed. The bill was referred to tbe Commit
tee on Ways and Moans.
Gen. Hondersnn of Iowa noxt caught the
Sponker's eye. He reported from the Commit
tee on Appropriations nn urgent deficiency
bill. Itsetastdn J400.TO0 for pnbllo printinK

looked in the last Congress. , , . t
The House went Into Committeo ot tbe
Wb ole again for the consideration of Gen.
Uendorson's bill. Tbo committee had just
fairly got to work, with Mr. Burrows again in
the chair, whou Gen. Anson G. McConk. the
Secretary of the Senate, appeared in tho main
nialo. He could not be rocolvO'l whllo tho
House was In Comndtteo of tho Wholo. Etl
n.iette fnrtdda It. Mr. Ilurrows therefore va
cated the chair, and Judge Parson of Illinois
took It as Speaker pro tern. Tbe great silver
mace was elevated and Gen. McCook properly
recognized. Ho reported tbat tbo Senate had
passed, with amendments, tbe House bill mak
ing appropriations for tbo printing of the mtrl
cultural report, and asked a commltton of Con
ference. Tbe General turned upon bis heel Itho
silver mace was dropped. Judge Payson left
the choir, nnd Mr. Burrows lesumed It us
Chairman of the Committeo of the bole.
Gen. Henderson then explained tbb scope of
the printing defleloucy bill. Silver Dollar Bland
too" the floor. He Introduced n proviso direct
ing tho Superintendent of Census to collect re
turns on farm mortgages, and appropriating
$200,000 for that purpose. Gen. Henderson
made a point of order that Mi. Bland's pro
viso was not germane to the bill. Sllvor Do lar
Ulnnd replied that, nstbe House ha I no rules.
It was proceeding undor general parliamentary
law. Under sucb law. nnythlnu neitatnfni: to

Henderson said thatthe act defining the duties
ot tho Superintendent provided for the taking

Pnrm mortgages wore such Indebtednesa. Mr.
Dookery of Missouri remarked that tliobii
perlotendent did not so construe tho law. ne
hoped that If the snbjoct was not noted upon
now it would be aoted upon at an early duy.
Chairman llitrrowB, In making bis ruling
upon the DOintol order said: "The Chair i

Tho Senate hnd Its first protractod executive
session this afternoon and transacted some im
portant buBlnoss, which It apt to create sur
prise when it becomes known. Tbo nomina
tion ot Judge Ilrowor of Kansas to bo an Asso
ciate Justice of tbe Supremo Court was acted
upon favorably by the Sonato Committeo on
Judiciary, but, was not confirmed. Several
minor nominations weroo onurmod. As far
as tbo record shows, this is all the work
tbat wr.s dono. but nn executive session record
genorally tells only half tho truib. That was
the cttM to-day. In addition to those confirma
tions, tho Senatois transacted a little business
that should properly havo been performed with
open doorx. They took Informal action tbat
will probably result In tho removal ol tho Su
preme Couit. i.liunibors. from the Capitol
building' to., tbo big stono mansion ot
Benjamin P. Butler, just outside the
south groubds of tho Capitol. No formal mo
tion was mado for this transfor. but
It tins so palpably tho sonsoot a majority of
tho bunntors prot-out that such a movo would
bo u wiso one. that tho committee, which bos
been foi ton dais considering how more com
mitteo looms mlglit be obtnlnod for tho Sena
tors, will undoubtedly soon bring In n resolu
tion providing for tho removal ol tho court.
The discus-ion on this subject In tho oxocutlvo
session untnu up lather unaxpoctedly to most
of tbo toiilitnrs, and in all fairness tho doors
should hao been nlnnco opened but tho Son
utobaaiihJbltof gliding Into legislative busi

th o Fotslon, and u groat many matters of i at ty
policy have often been nnanged In socret
which wore alterward formally piomulgatod in
open Sonato. bo it was to-day.
Alter tbo work of conllrmlng nominations
was oi or, tho subject of finding moro commit
teo looms was brought up. Boioral proposi
tions looking to the securing of moro room
wero luudo, but all wero successfully opposed,
except tho ono providing for a now homo for
tho hupremo Court Justices. Ono Bonntor pro
posed to abolish tbo free Senatorial barber
shop and bath room lu tho busonient ot the
Senntu wing. lie was laughed to scorn by his
cnlloagtius. This harbir Bhop is kept opou
twelvemonths in tho year, und every Bonntor
is shuvod nnd bntbed and shorn at tho publlu
expense whllo tie is In Washington. Less than
bIx Senators woio willing to cousldor for a mo

slleucod. Then a motion was mado tbat tbe
restaurant, which occuplos four lino rooms
In tho must accesslblo part of tho

v,lth tho bnrlur shop, to somo of tho
now rooms formed by the construction of tha
terraces on tbo outsido of tho building. Sena
tors will go to groat leugths to avoid any cur
tailment of their porsonal comforts, howovor.
nnd the suggestion to tnovo tho restaurant mot
tho same fnteos tho one with regard to tho bar
ber shop. Then ono of tbo level-headed Sena
tois oamofonviitd with an olaborato plan for
renting tho Butlor house, moving the Supreme
Court Into it, and thus securing n dozen or
moro fine committeo rooms. This plan seemed
to strike everybody vuth great lavor. and tho
committee that Is searching for moro room
weto inlormnlly authorized to go ahead on the
plan and kccuto tho nocossary consent for
the transfer of tho court. Thoro seems lit
tle doubt that wlien thoy havo teoured
tho rental nf the Butler house and tho coni-ont
of the Justleos to move thnt tho manor will be
nt onco easily and dellultoty arranged. Tho
Justices havo boen complaining for a long
tinio that thuy bnvo not room enough to carry
on tho wori. ot tho court satisfactorily, und
thov will no doubt readily agreo to tho plan
outlined In eioaitho bession. The Butlor
house, which has boon uod previously as com

housos In onu. and with a llttlo oxponso could
bo tlttea un into a very lomfortablo home for

ited tbe Treasury Department recently to as
certain why tha bailiffs in the United States
Marshal's office have not received tholr pay for

said thnt tho trouble was In the Marshal's ofllre
In Now lork. They asserted that tho Marshal's
bills woi e not Itemized as thoy should bo under
tbo law. and that ther have had considerable
trouble with Marshal MuMnhon by bis making
requisitions on them for monoy whon thoy had
him already debited for tho amount ot his
bond. Tho Mnrshal'a account and tholr ac
count differ. Thoy added tbnt It Is not cus
tomary to honor a Mnrshal'a requisition whou
bo is debited by tho amount of his bond, 'ihey
say thnt there i no way lor the bailiffs to ie
celvn their monoy bofore the holidays unless
tho Marshal males a requisition noon thoiu
that thoy can honor. If ltntnUod statements,
with vouchors are sent they will honor 61s
requisition for tbe monoy It tho nmonnt
ngalnst htm la not equal to his bond. The
monoy Is hero and can bo got with proper
vouchers, unions some other Marshal gets
ahead of Marshal McMuhon. It looks ns

thinks he Is right nnd thu officials of tho de

of articles already ownod by the city which aro
