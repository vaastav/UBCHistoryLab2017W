Fair, fat and well past foiiy aid

to Richmond last nl^ht and. In the |
William Collier part in "Never Hay i
Die." demonstrated how a real actor
can always come hack. Indeed, in spite
of the years that roll between then
ami now, the Nat Goodwin of "The
Clidcd Fool" seemed never to have
gone; certainly not to the laughing
house that welcomed him for old
Mines' sake and warmed to him again
for the sake of the actor and Ins extra
ordinary ability.
William II. l'ost's farce-comedy is a
frivolous thing and the part of Dlo

who made the hardened shudder i>y

i we saw ns his successor. And so he
treated them both; he not only played
them, he played with them, and In so
doing vastly Increased the fr< thy fin:
of the whole bubbling affair. Time
and again he indulged in "ad lib.
' stuff" until the actors sat and grinned
land the house sat and roared.
I The house came back at him once,
j too: in one speech he cot as far as
: "I lost a wife once?" and that was as
i far as he did get In his solo. A crash
ing uhorus from the orchestra, bal
t cony and gallery took it up and
laughed down the rest of it, while he,
: for once, sat and grinned, 'tut neither

J of the audience In ti-ire red in the least
I with the joyous progress of the bright,
witty, foolish farce, which laced to a
; happy curtain at 10:20 and left tlio
audience trying to catch up with its
own amusement.
Featured in his : tipporl .Margaret

? the program and in the cast i.uii only
be due to family reasons??'n? is Mrs.
Number Five, Miss Moreland is rather
like Mary iiolaud in coloring and In
feature, i?u t there the resemblance
stops with a bang: Miss Holatid is an
uti'jj-uall;. talented young woman.
Dennis ? 'letigh, in the role of the

towered above the rest of a cast notable
; chiefly for its dull mediocrity, one small
'boy, programmed as Master Keats. <\

his appearance at the Academy of

iiis newest play, "As Years Holl On," by
Herbert Hall Wlrmlow and Chart's

| "Met/." type. certainly for the present,
and it is said that his new play is far
i better fitted to his personality than
, any he has had in years. ft tells a
story of life in Holland and later In
i America. In th< first act Mr. Wilson is
seen as a yourit: man, but during the
rest of the play he appears as a man
gradually growing older. During the
per forma nee he will sing "Yesterday."

The latest Metro photoplay produc
tion, "The Woman Pays," with Vail!
Valli as its star, was the Colonial at
traction yesterday. It will be seen
again to-day. The play Is one of
. modern life in its more intense form,
j The struggle is that of a young hus
band and wife against a powerful
man and woman, both disappointed
over the marriage, and combined for
the purpose of wrecking It. The Wo
man does not pay, but she skates on
, pretty thin ice, and comes near enough
to paying to keep the spectators
; wrought up for several tense moments.
There is a striking thunderstorm. In
which lightning blasts a .tree and
j hurls part of it into a ballroom during
i a dance, and the young wife is struck
j and disfigured for life. This storm
is most realistic, and is well adjusted
to the incidents which hang on It.
.Valli Valli plays the wife with appeal
and conviction.

The American note, it i.M understood.

not believe that the commanders of.
j Austrian submarines have committed
.in alleged act of lawlessness except i
tinder a misapprehension of orders'

to remain within the. rules of fairness.;

of the Austro-1 lungarian government
in this communication. Warning be-l

I President Wilson occupied the chair
while Mr. Strong told of the American
Ited i 'ross sanitary work iti stamping
out typhus in Serbia, and during the
address of Charles J. O'Connor, special
representative of the Ited Cross, who j
I brought word of the famine ami misery
! :? s l>f saw them two months ago in
j Mexico ? Mty.
Dr. Strong, concluding his address,!
! turned toward tlie President as he said:i
j "We have heard much in the L'nited
States of the preparedness of our conn-,
? try for general defense. On.: impor- j
taut problem in this connection is the
? question of the preparedness of our,
j physicians to deal with epidemics of
infectious diseases in the held, and
| i heir knowledge of the problems re
| lating to the hygiene of camp life and
I our large bodies of troop."
j Mr. O'Connor replied to those who
i have charged Ited Cross workers with
! giving untrue reports of conditions in
j Mexico by saying that lie had data
! showing that in the Federal district
about Mexico City in October the daily
number of deaths due to starvation
was about 2'je. He added that he con-1
sidered it a conservative estimate to
say that at least 2,000 were dying every
| day in the whole of Mexico tor lack ;
! of food or on account of disease at
tendant upon famine conditions.
"in the streets." he declared, "1 often
j saw gaunt women and children claw-,
j ing in barren garbage heaps for scraps. ?
I I saw groups of pathetic wretches
j waiting hours before door* of private? j
i houses for a cupful of soup. I saw
acres of pauper graves, where llie dead '
were buried so fast that the tin name
plates required by law were not set (
above the graves. I saw a constant ,
procession of funeral cars and cotlins ;
borne on the head."
