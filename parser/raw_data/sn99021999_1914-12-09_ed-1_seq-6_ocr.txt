Wilson on War snd Peace.
The dominant note of the president's roes-
sage to the reconvened congress It war and
peace its reference to the war in Europe, and
lis emphasis on the obligations of peace in
America. The other topics dealt with are un
satisfactory because of Indeflnlteness, but on
the one point that the United States thall re
main neutral, and shall not deviate from its
long established military and naval policy, Mr.
Wilson Is clear and uncompromising.
True, we hear a great deal In these days
about our unpreparedness for war, and the
necessity for enlarging both army and navy to
put us in position to cope with possible foes.
There are advocates even of compulsory military
service In this country to supplant the system of
voluntary enlistment, and some demands for
military expansion beyond all previous limits
of peace strength. The president gives the effec
tive answer to these outcries, when he says that
we have no foreign foes .o fear now any more
than we had before the war conflagration, and
lhat we will not have hereafter any more than
before If we do our duty as a great neutral
nation, and he is determined to have us do It.
The only thing -we need to be prepared for is to
defend ourselves from attack, and for thla we
have been prepared right along. To maintain
and Improve our army and navy establishments
on this basis will, of course, require constant
outlay and better co-ordination with state mili
tary establishments, but to try to match the mili
tarism of Europe Just at the time when the arm
aments of the great powers are sure to be sub
jected to limitation aa the result of the war,
would be, as the president Intimates, short
sighted and unwarranted. Incidentally this re
assurance against a popular misconception 4a
gratifying.
"The country has been misinformed," he de
clares. "We have not been necUrant ef national
defense. We shall learn and profit by the les
son of every experience and every circumstance;
and what is needed will be' adequately done."
But what Is to be done, It must be understood.
Is not to be done In response to a temporary
clamor1, but pursuant to a permanent and settled
policy, a policy which looks forward to peace,
and not to war. In this declaration the chief
executive unquestionably voices the sentiment
of the vast majority of our sober-minded and
peace-loving American cltixens.
Arizona's 8. 0. S.
"For God'a sake, help us!"
This is the cry, not of war-besieged Euro
peans, but of, peaceful American cltlsens, who
are being shot down with Impunity by reckless
Mexican bushwhackers. The cry cornea from
Naco, Arizona, where five persons have been
killed and forty-two others wounded by the
Mexicans across the border. A ciuiens' com
mittee has been organised to provide some
method of protection and in the extremity of
the situation this cry of distress goes up to
Washington. - ,
What has become of all our hlgh-soundinr
warnings to Mex'co to' keep its bullets on its
own side of the boundary line? What can be
done to prevent such shooting when Mexican
towns across the line are besieged? The people
of Arizona seem to hava suggested a wise and ef
fective measure--ret our. f overnment take such
action as will automatically close any port on
the Mexican border whenever It becomes the
scene of battle. That ia one way among others
if those responsible for affairs would only try
to find them. '
The people who reside where Mexico borders
on Texas, Arizona, New Mexico or California,
should have the same rtrtts to the security of
life and property as those who happen to live
further back In the interior.
The Sane Old Story.
. One of the "nine cardinal causes" of in
dustrial unrest most generally agreed on by
employers and employee alike, named in tb re
port submitted to congress by the Commission
on Industrial Relations is "A deal re on the part
of the workers for a voice In the determination
of conditions under which tbey labor." Failure
to satisfy such a desire la said to figure vitally
la conditions existing in Colorado coal mining
fields for the last four years, during which loss
of property and life baa been the climax of a
rule of terror that defied state civil and military
autnority and for a time tried the mettle of
armed federal power. Itself.
It would be Ignominious foil to attamnt t
Uy taii ,u1 b!m for this prolonged outlawry
on the miners any more than on their employers,
but it must be laid largely to the blind and un
reasoning seir-mterest which has prevented so
much progress toward what wa mav reallv hati
as an Intelligent method f handling industrial
aiepuies. tjj, fgCt is. that while aelf.lnt.r..
is at the bottom of most of the trouhla It ul
timately defeats Itself. .
No set of men or Interests, whether wage
earners or wage payers, may Justly arrogate to
Itself the right to organise and carry on its af
fairs as an organization and then rraa
recognli, the righv of th6 other side to do the
same thing. Vet we find almost invert. hi. i.
these disputes this same old story "refusal to
recognize" when the facts are all brought out.
The board of mediation appointed by the pres
ident to adjust the Colorado differences may,
let ua hope will, succeed in its mission and that
the miners will act upon the recommendations
of their chiefs to call off the .trike and go to
work If given the chance, but the mediation
board would fail of its dute if it .
pbaslse this point, that neither aids has any
exclusive HKhts of organization. The mine
owaers have notably acted in this Colorado, situ
ation as a body and they must expect their em
ployes to want to act the same way.
The Plnchot senatorial campaign In Penn
sylvania cost the candidate something over
142,000. The elimination of money from poli
tics Is evidently so more feasible for the pro
gressive party reformer than for the old
farhloned old party politician.
As far as anyone baa learned, Colonel Watter

Active Service in War Time
Graphic Description by . Charles
Vivian in Book Juit limed Enti
tled "British Army from Within."
Fart X.
The popular conception of act've service Is of a
succession of encounters with the enemy. Isperate
deeds of valor, brilliant charges by bodies of troops,
men saving other mm under fire, tha storming of
positions and the flush of victory after strenuous
action enter largely Into the civilian conception of war.
The reality Is a smher business of marching ami
watching, nls-hta without sleep and days without food;
retracing jne's steps in order to execute the plan of
the brain to which a man la but one effective riflo
out of many thousands, marching for days and day,
seeing nothing mora exciting than a burnt-out nous
and the marching men on either aide and to front
and rear and then the contact with the enemy. A
vicious crack from somewhere, or the eolld boom of a
piece of artillery; somewhere away from tha front
or flank la the enemy, and his pieces do damage in
tha ranks: there Is a starching for cover, some orders
are given: ret haps a comrade lies utterly still, anJ
one knows that lhat man will not move any more;
there Is a desperate aense of Ineffectiveness, of anger
at this cowardly (as It seems) trick of hitting when
one cannot hit back. There la the satisfaction ot get
ting the range and firing with results that may be
gueesed, but cannot bn known accurately by the man
who rirea: there Is the curious thrill that comes when
an angrily singing bullet paaaaa near, and one realises
that ona la under fire from the enemy. In a normal
action there ia tha sense of disaster, even of defeat
when ona's slda may In reality be winning, for ona
seea men dying, wounded, lying dead one knowa tha
damage tha enemy has inflicted, but has no idea ct
the damage one's own force has inflicted In return.
Often, when It begins to be apparent that the enemy
la nearly beaten, there cornea the order to retire; ona
doea not understand the order, but, with sullen sensn
of resentment at It, retiree, ducking at the whlsttng
of a shell, though not all tha ducking In the world
would avail If the ahell were truly aimed at the ona
who ducks, or starting back to avoid a bullet that
whlsaedTjy as If by starting back one could get out
of the way of a bullet!
After a day of action, or after the chance has coma
to rest for a while after days of action, ona gets a
aenae of horror of the whole business the tragedy ef
lives laid down. In a good causa certainly, but the man
are dead, and one questions almost with despair If it
Is worth while. So many good men with whom one
has joked and worked and playad In time of peace have
gone under and there are probably more battles yet
to fight. It Is not until a war has concluded, and men
who have served are able to get some Idea of the
operations aa a whole, that they are able to under
stand what -has been done. Men who coma back
wounded from Mons and Charlerol, away from the
magnificent three weeks' retreat that was then in
progrese, for the British and French armies ware in
many rases- fully convinced that they had bean de
featedthat their armies ware beaten and had to
retreat to save themselves from destruction. The 'man
In the ranks cannot understand the plan of the staff
who control him, for he sees so very little of the
whole; at the most, he knows what la happening t a
division of men, while engaged in the retreat to the
position on the Marne were, at the least, twenty
divisions on the aide of tha all lea Had ona ef these
been utterly shattered In a aet battle, the other nine
teen might still hava won a decisive victory, and. If
news of that victory had not come through for a day
or two, the survivors from the shattered division
would have spread tidings of a defeat which it would
hava been, to them. The man In the ranks sees so
little of the whole.
Here the war correspondent makea the most
egregious mistake, for, untrained In military service
himself, ho takes the word of the men In the ranks
the man on the staff of army headquarters la far too
busy and far too discreet to talk to war correspondents
and out of what the man In tha ranks haa to say
the war correspondent makes Up his story. Though)
the man In tha ranka may believe his ow story to
be true, though he may tell of tha operatlona aa he
conceives them, he may be Riving an utterly false
Impression of what la aatually happening. . The man
In the ranka la one cog In a machine, and he eannot
tell what all the machine Is doing at any. one time
least of all when a battle la In progress.
Every battle fought dlffera from all other battle,
for no opposing forces aver meet under precisely
Identical conditions twice. Thus It is useless to speak
of a typical battle except In tha broadest general
sense, and useless to attempt to describe a typical
battle, or action of any kind. Usually the artillery
get into action after cavalry have reconnoitered the
enemy's position; tha guns shell the eaemy until he
la considered sufficiently weakened to permit of In
fantry attack, and than tha Infantry go forward, even
up to the rarely occurring bayonet chavge. If their
advance dislodges tha enemy, the cavalry are sent on
to turn retreat Into rout; tf, on the other hand, th
attacking force Is compelled to retire, the cavalry
cover the retreat, and. In order to make good in a
retreat, a part of a force Is taken been while the re
mainder hold the enemy In check. In modern actions
artillery fire their shells over the hsada of their own
Infantry at the enemy, distance and trajectory per
mitting of thla. ' By trajectory ia meant the curvn
that a projectile describes In Its flight; both rifle and
big guna are so constructed and sighted that thoy
throw their projectiles upward to counteract the pull
of gravity, and the missile eventually drops down
toward ita object It does not travel In a perfectly
atralght line. But It la bad for infantry to be In
front of their own guns, with their own artillery shells
paaaing over them for too long morale suffers from
this after a time, atnea a man cannot dlatlpgulsh In
auch a case between' hla own artillery's shells and
those ef tha enemy. Whenever possible tha artillery
In rear of an Infantry force are posted slightly to
either flank: circumstances, however, do not always
admit of this.

OMAHA, Dec. s. To the Kdltor of The
Pee: It Is regrettable that your paper
should print such an article aa that under
the caption of "Teacher'a Dismissal
Legal." To show Its untruthfulness, I
alll take It by sections or paragraphs.
In the report handed me by Mr. Her
ring and signed by himself, he does not
mention "discharge;" In fact. Ignores that
phase entirely, while seeming to hold
that tha report of the teachers' committee
waa only a motion to place on file Miss
Stegner's communication.
In the second section of your article. I
am quoted as saying It was a "personal
matter." etc. This was In accordance
with Mr. Herring's opinion, given to me
In the presence of Mr. Warfleld, and Mr.
Herring said at that time that If I ruled
that tha matter had not been referred to
him, he would have to sustain my ruling.
Your article further states that the
secretary's records show that the matter
was referred to the attorney. Without
consulting any member, I will say that
I doubt if a single member will ray that
he voted to submit It to the attorney, or
that any auch motion waa ever made or
put to the board, and no matter Is other
wise ever "referred" unless ordered by
the chair. I have signed the minutes, aa
requested by Mr. Bourke. I did not
bother to read them. I hava not looked
at them aa yet. but knowing and trust
ing Mr. Bourke as I do. I do not believe
that he, knowing the method of referring
matters and that actions that evening
were taken when ten members and about
twenty-five well known men and women
cltlsens were present, would falsify his
records. I cannot believe It until I hava
carefully read the minutes.
J." 'ctlon Purporting to contain
r. Herrings opinion, I would say that
you, reporter has been Imposed upon
There Is abaolutely no similarity between
