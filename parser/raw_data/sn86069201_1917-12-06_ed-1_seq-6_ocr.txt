THE OLD AND
THE NEW COUNCIL
Monday night last witnessed the pass
inr; of the Old Council and the cominR
of the New. There is no use in discuss
inf the relative merits of theOld Coun
cil and the New. Such discussion
idle and can result in no good to any
person or the community. The Old
Council is defeated. It has passed into
history and must stand upon it record
The people have spoken clearly and
with emphasis. The individual will
should gracefully give way to the col
lective will of the community as ex
pressed at the polls. At all times we
should tie big enough to put aside our
Individual interests tor the general
good.
It is the purpose of this paper to up
hold the hands of the New Council in
all worthy and honorable undertakings
and objectives. We would reflect the
true spirit of democracy. The fortunes
or the pride of individuals or groups of
individuals should not weigh against
the welfare of the whole. The Old
Council, as we believe, was made up of
honorable, public spirited men, whose
whole souls were energized by the mo
tive of service to the people of the
city. If mistakes were made they
were trivial and few, and then it was
because, if at all, of the failure of the
planning or execution and not the pur
pose. They have gone the way of all
city fathers. They have been defeat'
ed. It has been truly said by students
of municipal politics that no mayor.
councilmanof, police" officer can un
flinchingly do his'duty without sutler
ing defeat. The difficulties which con.
fronted the Old Council will ever live
and will become problems for their suc
cessors. .We warn the New Council to.
be on their guard and advise them to'
place the community's welfare above
individual and personal power and in
terest and any species of favoritism
and special privilege. You may ex
pect in the enforcement of law, in the
enactment of ordinances, in the making
of franchise contracts to create antag
ohism, in running counter to self inter
est of individuals and groups and may.
hap powerful service corporations who
would infringe selfishly upon the rights
of the people to enrich its coffers.
Tis true and 'tis pity 'tis true,
"It is be dammed if you don't and be
dammed if you do."
But what of that if the citv fathers
come out with clean hands? The Old
Council steps down and out without a
suspicion ot graft with their integrity
unbending against threats of those who
would exploit the community in their
own interest and what is more against
the pleasing flattery of those who
would use them. They will leave to
history their vindication, through their
achievements, not as told and spok
en by the thoughtless or those who
have been mislead but to the city's
written records, through which it can
only speak and be judged. The records
show one dollar per month telephone
service, as promised. The cheapest
Electric Lighting franchise contract of
anv adjoining city, a great saving to
the people both private and public.
The water works problem Holved in
such a way as to furnish water and fire
protection the year around, when here
tofore we had it dry lake for weeks
each year, und this without additional
cost und u saving to the city of hun
dreds of dollars in the collection of
water rents that otherwise would have
been forfeited.
We hope for the New Council all suc
cess and a careful and worthy handling
of the city's affairs. We are ready to
assist and give them courage when we
can conscientiously do so.
Every man who voted against the
New Council should co-operate with
them and the mayor In all just under
takings. Lets pull together for the
city beautiful in physical uttractweneis,
moral proportions, and business effic
iency and all will bo well.
As one travels southward from the
Sea of Galilee a great plain comes into
view. It is mostly of sand, rock and
barren soil, with here and there a
starved shrub. It is 20 miles across
and runs 35 miles toward Jerusalem,
and more human destiny hns been
thrashed outuponit than upon any other
territory of like size on earth.
Here Jonathan and Saul fought the
Philistine,, were benten, punished and
the cause of civilization was Met back.
Here Saladin beat King Itichard and
the Chtistain cross went down before
the Mohammedan cresent. Here the
Moslems tirst got their grasp on sacred
Palestine and fought to make Constan
tinople the religious capital of the
eastern world. Here Napoleon dream'
ed his dream of world-coiuUest, world
slavery to autocracv.
Today Turkish armies are fleeing to
ward this plain and may make their
last stand therein. In the south, the
llritish are pressing up from Cnza. To
the east, the llritish are aiming to
ward this plain from the Euphrates,
Coming down from Persia, is n Itussian
force. To the north are forces of the
British, Australians, Armenians,
Greeks, Serbians, French and Human
lans, pointing toward Constantinople
and this plain. And permanent world
peace is their cause liberty, brother
hood, civilization.
Turn to your Ilihle, at Revelations
xiv:
"For they arc the spirits of devils
working miracles (German) which go
forth unto the kings of the earth and
of the whole world to gather them to
the battle of that great day of God
'Almighty."
"And He gathered them together in
to a place."
And the seventh angel poured out his
vial into the air; and there came a
great voice out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying "It is done!
If the Turks get a proper beating in
this plain, the central powers will like
ly "crack." and vou may hear from
the throne of Austria a great voice
crying, "It is finished"!
Watch that p'aln! It is today callad
Esdraclon. The old Hebrew writer
named it Armageddon.

FIItST. It gives everybody an op
nortunity to help a little bit in health
work.
SECOND. It brings to the attention
of all people the need of doing some
thing to save themselves from tuber
cutosis and many other preventable and
unnecessary diseases.
THIItD. As a preparedness measure
for war, it is of vital importance to
conserve the health and lives of the
nation's fighting units. The money
from the sale of Red Cross Seals goes
into local health work, helps to do
state health work and part of it goes
to the National Hed Cross to assist in
their work.

next one is held during the latter part
of the coming year, its success will
haye been assured.
County Agent W. II. Rogers and his
assistant, Loui Tinder, deserve much
credit for the work they did and to

Germany, but did not include in his re

other allies, declaring that they are
'mere tools and do not yet stand in the

The President reasserted that German

FOOD ADMINISTRATOR
Mr. T. R. Moss, director of theState
Food Commission, was in our city last
Tuesday. While here our local chair
man. Miss Tummie Francis, arranged
for a meeting at the school Auditorium
Tuesday afternoon, at which time Mr.
Moss addressed the meeting, to a small
but interested audience. We regret
that the meeting had to be arranged
so hastily, for a much larger crowd
was due Mr. Moss, who enlightened
the merchants present as to their dut
ies toward conserving the food, which
he said was one of the irost vitaldulies
imposed upon the people during the
war which is now on.

HIBBARD
THE MACHINE GUN
When one takes the trouble to in
vestijjate.Americans ure proven to be a
very inventive nation yet because of
their great modesty they seldom claim
and never boast of what they have
done and often other peoples and na
tions take the article, develop it, und
sometimes enla.gi upon it and claim
it as their own. In the matter of ma
chine guns America has lead in the in
vention. The Gatling gun was invent
ed in 18G1 by a Dr. Gatling of Chicago,
und was really a good gun and used
extensively in the war with Spain.
This gun turned on u crunk like u hand
organ and it fired at the rate of about
ten ti scon'J. This gun has been super
ceded by vastly more effective weapon
that does not turn on a crank at all,
you pull tho trigger und it does the rest
firing ut the rate of about two hundred
and fifty shots in about twenty five
seconds, When the trigger is pulled u
fresh cartridge Is discharged und that
reloads the gun
At the present time there are four
types of guns used in our army and all
are American inventions. They are the
Maxim-called the Vickers; the Colt; the
portabls Hotchkiss, also called the
Benet-Mcrcie; and the Lewis. When
Howard Maxim invented and developed
his gun he made demonstrutions before
many distinguished witnesses, notably
the Kaiser. Not all of them were in
terested and some dismissed the ideu of
the invention with the statement that
it took too much amunition and was to
expensive to operate. Evidently ull
the witnesses were not of that opinion
tor it was found at the beginning of
the present war in 1!)14 that the Ger
man army under the Kaiser had (0,000
of these Maxim guns with which to be
gin their work of death and destruction
while other nations are still hard press
ed for arms and amunition. Truly it
is a wise man that is in u position to
see and know tho danger afar off.
After an illness covering more than
five years, Mr. J. II. Hibbard died last
Wednesday at his home on Hamilton
avenue, of paralysis.
He was 77 years of age and moved
to this countv from Madison about
fifteen years ago. Besides his widow,
he is HUrvived by one son. Earnest
Hibbard, and one daughter, Mrs. E. II.
Ray of Buckeye.
After funeral services conducted by
Rev F. I). Palmeter ut the home, the
remains were interred at Buckeve last
Thursday.
WELL RECEIVED
One of the best talks ever heard here
on the conservation of food was that
given by Miss Mary Sweeney, Dean of
the Home Economics department of
Kentucky University. Wednesday af
ternoon at the Woman's Club rooms.
She was brought here under the aus
pices of the Woman's Club and it was
unfortunate indeed that more people
did not hear her. She has been asked
to return again, and in the event she
does, the lecture will bo given, either
at the court house or the school auditorium.
HOUSE BUILT OF STRAW.

it makes a very comfortable home for
himself and family. Hale of rement
