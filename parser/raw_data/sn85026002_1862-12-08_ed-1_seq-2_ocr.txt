We expressed no opinion in regard to the

January to any other time. A the Com

Th pilgrimage of old 1862 draw to a
close. With rapid stride he last ap
proaches the Winter of Death. A few
short day and he will wrap the drapery
of hie icy coach about him and lie down
in endless sleep. The last sand are drop
ping from the life-glass of th old year.
How swiftly as an arrow from a strong
bow, it ha flown) How rapidly the
days, like chariot laden with the trophies
of victory, have swept by 1 It seem bnt
yesterday that we stood at the portals of
the year, now so near its close, or returned
thanks that the light of a New Year had
dawned upon the tents of our pilgrimage.
It seems as thongh but - a single forward
step has been taken, for the shrines of the
New Year's day are still in light but
still it is the real fact that w have jour
neyed a long distance, and are many day
of toilsome travel nearer our journey'
end than when the year began. We have
mounted many a hill of Difficulty, rested
at many a way-side inn of Content, drank
of many a hitter pool of Sorrow, upon
which we shall never look over which
we shall never toil at which we shall
never kneel again. We have passed on
our journey many a milestone, and pluck
ed old mo from it,' beside which we
shall never again pause for rest. W have
spoken sad good-bye to - friend friend
whose faces we shall look upon no- more ;
we have smiled at bridal whose pealing
anthem of rejoicing W (hall never hear
again ; we have stood at graves, and lain
dear one therein, whose feet, will never
again walk the green path of earthf and
whoa sunny smiles will never again cheer
our drooping spirits. , j
But in the year so swiftly going, thus
thickly strewing life with shadows, have
we not also gathered, her and there, clus
ters of plessant fruit by th wayside in
which w journeyed T Have w not found
leave of healing, with the cypres wreath,
and sometimes, too, pearls at the bottom
of our cups of sorrow T Uan we see no
ray of sunshine through the lowering war-

Letter From an Indiana Volunteer.
BOWLING GREEN, KY., Nov. 29, 1862.
7b (a Kditur of lU Enquirtr ;
- Soae tiatee the eoal of a sick eoldier is
brought back almost from death's border by
a cheering letter from home. No medicines
ean eqnal it, no doctor words have bait the
thee aad eoDaolation. Neat to the home-
letter is home news, prosperity, saccess to
friends, and Party triumph of principle and
truth aad right.
Yesterday a letter from my wife, to me the
best of womea, cheered me so that I eonld
walk eot from the hospital, and to-day I
bought from the news-boy a copy cf the '
qrtirtr, and having read it through, I feel
well enongh for writing a letter, and almost
well enough for dntv.
The people the Democracy the power of
ire government, has again spoken load and
clear, and strong as a thnnder-bolt for the
"Coettitutioa aa it is, and the Uuion as it
waa" No degradation of while men by
placing asgro labor in competition with theirs.
The people have responded to the command
of Ood, and said we will not "covet our
neighbor's man servaat or his maid servant;"
we will sustain the Administration if it is
right, but if it is wrong, we will demand it to
return, through the ballot-box. Down with
the Emancipation Protlaroatioo, says the late
elections, down with Abolitionism ; and does
the f resident near and will be beed the voice?
That ballot box made him President; can't
that ballot-box ando what it has done ; hasn't
that ballot-box elected a Congress which hat
power to inmate, through impeachment,
what it has made through ballot 7 We only
ask the question, haa it such power ?
the speech ef U U Vallandigbam ta ene
of the moat cheering signs of the times. Its
power in the nation is worth its thousand
men. There is in him a moral hero. Part
of hi greatness consists in the fact that he
nas never tattered, never Hesitated tor one mo
ment to lift a voice for freedom and his in
jured country. When the sky was dark above
him, and the storm swept around him in its
larv, he stood upon the old Deaocratio ship.
aad amid her tattered masts, and above her
breaking Umbers, bis voice was clear and
loud, bidding bold defiance to the power that
threatened him.
Those were dark days wbea Vallandigbam,
Ben Wood and Dan Voorhees we?e the few
men who dared mention "Constitution."
Newspapers were silenced, publie speakers
were take from the stand and from their
homes and cast into Baatilesto suffer, rot and
die ; martial law was proclaimed, the writ of
habtat corpus suspended, and a great cen
tral power had laid tha ax at the root of re
served rights, making way tor the mighty de
potisns which was slowly lifting its head, set
ting its foot upon the neck of constitutional
freedom, and caitiag its proud glance over
the continent And still these men are de.
nounced as traitors and seceah, because they
dare speak wnat our latnera died to achieve.
And by whom? By the aoldters T No, bat
Tew or tnem speak that way or U U V alien
dicham. Thev love to read his speeches ;
tbey say he is right, and to-day not a few eyes
nave brightened aa l read to tbem what be
said.
Ne. I will tell von the class of men who
abuse C. L. Vallandigbam as a traitor to bis
country. I heard two of them denouncing
him to day, and rejoicing over his late deleat,
and hoping his speech at Cambridge City,
Indiana, would be the cause of his arrest
They are eitisens of this town, they are con

Kentucky. But soon after the evacuation of
this place by Sidney A. Johnson, he turned
"Union man," and now hold conjointly the
beef contract with , who is so kiod and
charitable to the Union cause that be charged

the hospital, when the towels could have beea

piece. I am a sick soldier with but little
money, lor 1 am ae contractor and no omcer.
I walked op to these two aen Unlay and asked
them to change for me one dollar, that I
might buy some medicines, and took my
eilver dollar and offered me eighty cents in
post office currency, telling me that change
waa worth twenty cents to the dollar. "A
private soldier," thought he, "dirty and sicv,
feeble aad sad, was a fine bait for a money
sharker." Such are the men, and such are
the circumstances ander which I heard that
patriot statesman abused to-day. Well may
contractors and those in high placet, when
they hear of a Democratic eucceas, growl and
ramble treaaoa, and secesb, and butternuts,

Our Only Hope.
The Albany (Net York) Journal Sew
ard a State Organ thus express its opin
ion ae to "our only hope" of successfully put
ting down th rebellion: ,
"It i th feahioa ia certain quarter to
sneer at what is called "Union sentiment" in
the Slave States. And yet in the development
ef such a sentiment lies our only kept ef the
triumph of our causa No matter what the
motive that bring back the people M the
shelter of the old flag no matter whether it
is a conviction that th rebellion ean't eeecoed
or a genaine affection for the Government of
their tatters tbey must have tha privilege of
at least appearing to come back voluntarily.
We may conquer their physical reeiatsaoe;
bnt wecen hardly conquer their dispositions.
We may compel them back into the Union as
iato a limbo ; but we can not compel them to
be our brethren against their will.' If we
wcild restore the old brotherhood, at wll a
th old political bonds, we mast show 1 oar
selves merciful as well as strong. W must
convince the Southern massee that we wage
no vindictive war against them that we have
no intention to compel them into a degrading
allegiance. We must convince them that
tbt-y hare only to return to the path from
which t'jey strayed to have their offenses for
given and forgot n.
' We hope, therefore, to tea every' encour
agement given to the Southern Unionist to
tend not demagogue aad sharpers but
earnest, honest . men to represent them on
the floor of Congress. This will te practi
cal step toward the restoration of the Union."
Acknowledgment.
Ws are indebted to that able champion of
Democratic truth, Bon. Clement U Valland-1
igham for a copy of his great campaign soeech
delivered August 2, and far a pamphlet which
vindicates lull his whole course. Mr Vall
aadigham has been the abated man in Ohio:
and we are glad to ee that tha vindiotiveness
and slander with which he has been pursusd
has already caused him to be looked to aa the
Democratic or Coaaervative candidate for
Governor of that great State.
No nobler or bolder champion of troth has
anywhere beea gerrymandered out of the na
tional councils wherejust such brave.Jtrae and
souna sueo as ne are now most needed. With
out desiring to interfere with the action or
policy of our friends in that Slate, we may
eay that we have entertained some hope that
the Democracy of Ohio night be disposed to
return nr. vallandigbam to the council el
Union in a higher sphere than that which to
bat so ably filled, as a Senator, perhaps, la
Wade's place. Syracvtt Union N Y.
"Sssdaddlixo," so universally practiced by
the Kebels, i getting quite common in this
State, and there is hardly a regiment now in
the State which can show within a hundred oi
the number that they have enlisted. There
were so many deserters from Colonel C.iiker
ing's regiment that it was found impossible to
fill it At the time of the departure tor New
York there were nearly a thousand name on
the rolls, but it was found necessarry to take
two full companies from the 33d regiment to
fill its number. There is one regiment ia the
eastern part of the Slate which is nominally
full, but 160 of the mea cannot be found.
Another, which is nearly ready to go to the
seat of war, suffer to nearly the same extent
from a similar cause. iV. Y. Erprttt
War Humbugs Exploded.
The Chicago Tribune, a very violent Aboli
tion paper, in a late article upoa the war aad
it prosecution, said:
"We believe the fallacy is no longer cher
ished of starving out the rebellion. It will
read strangely in the history of this war that
the idea waa ever seriously entertained that bv
a cordon of forts and gunboats thinlv drawn
about the vast States of South, the people of
uiat ricoait agricultural region on wnicn the
sun shines could ever be starved into submis
sion. Why, two bounteous harvests, that have
filled the garners of the South with plenty,
have smilled derisively at such delusion.
"Nor will they snoenmb because they have
no salt, and because the shoes of the Confed
eracy have waxed like those of the deceitful
Qibeonites. Tell us no more of contrabands
or reliable fugitives, charming never so wisely
with reports of discontent, demoralisation and
debabilitation iu rebel line. We have had
too much of this. We have acted too much
as it we expected the rebels to fall apart and
come to us for relief."
Mark the Parallel.
Says Irving, in his Life of Washington;
speaking of what was called th "Conway Ca
bal" against the Father of his Country:
"Wanting ns the cabal might be in clans or
