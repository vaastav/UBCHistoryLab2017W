A REVIEW BV TAFT
. Of "Shooting Up" of Brownsville
by Negro Troops.
WAS DOUBLE CONSPIRACY
One to Murder, the Other Silence ae
\ to Perpetrators ? War Secretary
Makes Strong Arraignment
in Annual Report.
The annual report of Secretary of
War Taft, made public at Washington,
' Wednesday, reviews the events leadino
(ft ''chftftt i T> o- 11 n" ftf (So fftn-n r\t i
Brownsville, Texas, on August 14, last,
by unidentified negro soldiers of companies
B, C, and D of the twenty-fifth
infantry, the crime proper, the investigation
and subsequent discharge,without
honor, of the members of the battalion.
The report establishes the existf
?ence of a conspiracy for the perpetration
of the crime, and, unequivocally,
a later conspiracy of silence on the '
part of the battalion, whereby the \
criminals were permitted to escape. |
The secretary justifies the govern- |
iVmeat's course, and answers criticisms j
? :directed at it
The report shows that the battalion !
was sent to Brownsville, July 2S, over ;
Of" s the protest of the townspeople, the
department alleging the past good be;<,/
tiavior of negro troops as reason for
not changing its decision.
Prom the first, it appears, there was !
friction between the troops and the
people Off the town, sufficiently fre)'
fluent to be the constant topic of j
discussion in the barracks. Many of j
the saloon compelled the soldiers to
drink at separate bars, a discrimi^ v
nation they resented bitterly. The secretary
says:
"On the 12th of August It was reported
in Brownsville that a white woman
was seized by the hair by a
r/ , -colored soldier and dragged on the
ground. This report among the townspeople
caused great bitterness and
n. -excitement of feeling, which gave luch
concern to the officers of the battalion
that on the night of the same
d^y they sent patrols into the town
to" bring back their soldiers to the
?? fort. A few minutes after 12 o'clock
midnight of the next day, August 13,
t. e, on the morning of August 14,
?7 . shots were fired in the fort toward
|>?. the town from the neighborhood of
r 7 each barracks of the three companies.
?^-7 The fort is really in the town, and
uV' only separated from the houses by a
;'7v\ -wall The first shots seem to have
7v been fired in the air. Immediately af

^ ^estimated from nine to twenty, climbed
over the wall between the fort
and the town. There was much direct
?:> evidence that these men were colored
soldiers !n khaki and blue shirts, carryini?
the new service rifle. From
-seTenty-five to one hundred cartridge
shells and used clips and some un.
tfischarged cartridges were found upon
the streets of the town the next morn:
> "tag. and Major Penrose, commanding
the battalian identified them as
ammunition for the new service rifle,
and reluctantly admitted their con'
#, <;lu3ive weight as evidence that the
shooting was done by some of hi3
v me?.
The secretary describes how these
men fired into the room of a house
in which there were two women and
Ave children. The raiders next en['-conntered
the chief of police. Before
turning to escape, he estimated their
I: number at fifteen. They fired upon
/ him, wounding him in the arm and killing
his horse. They also fired upon
two policemen, a bullet piercing the
hat of one of them. The raiders then
fired into Miller's hotel, six bullets
being found in the building the next
day. The party divided, one squad
eroins: to a salcon, the keeper of which
. ?T.ad
insisted on maintaining a sepa?
Tate bar. The barkeeper attempted to
close the door, but was shot and killed.
A competent surgeon with army
experience testified the fatal wound
, came from a service bullet.

BULLET FOR EX-SENATOR 1
Discarded Woman Shoots Lawyer in a
Washington Hotel?Both Hail
from Salt Lake City, Utah.
Former United States Senator Arthur
Brown, of Salt Lake City, lies in j
a critical condition in Emergency j
hospital at Washington from a pis- j
tol shot wound in the abdomen in- f
flicted by Mrs. Anna M. Bradley, of
Salt Lake, who arrived at the capitol
Saturday front that city. The shooting
occurred in Senator Brown's
apartments in the Raleigh hotel,
where Mrs. Bradley also had registered
under the name of "A. B. Brown."
She was arrested.
Senator Brown was dcnveyed to
the hospital, where he was immediately
put upon the operating table.
Two shots were fired, o.ie grazing
his left hand and the other entering
the abdomen and lodging in the
pelvic cavity.
Mrs. Bradley arrived shortly after
noon. After being assigned a room,
she immediately went to Senator
Brown's apartment. There were no
witnesses to the shooting, but a floor
maid heard the shots and at once no1
lifted the management. In a statement
at the police barracks Mrs.
Bradley said she came to Washington
to demand that Senator Brown
marry her. She said their relations
were well known in Salt Lake.
"I asked him if he was going to
do the right thing by me," she said,
maintaining a remarkable composure.
"His reply was to put on his coat
and start to leave the room, and I
shot him. I abhor acts of this character,
but in this case it was fully justified."
She said she urged Senator Brown
to marry her, that he had been instrumental
in the dhorce between
her husband and herself, and that as
his wife was dead, he now could "do
thft riorVit thfncr" hv IiAp TMc

paid, he positively refused to do.
Mrs. Bradley Is about 38 years old.
Her first act after being taken to the
police station was to send for Senator
Sutherland, of Utah, who called and
had a long talk with her. Senator
'Sutherland regretted being brought
into the case, but said that Mrs. Bralley
had sent for him because he was
the only man in Washington she
knew.
To him she unbosomed herself and
told the story cf her relations with
Senator Brown. She alleged that two
cf her children owe their parentage
to Senator Brown, and she had named
one of them after him. Mrs. Bradley
was reluctant to speak of her
former husband, but questioning
brought out the fact that he was living
in Nevada with a second wife.
/Further questioning disclosed the
fact that Mrs. Bradley for two years,
3 90(0 and 1902, had served in the capacity
of secretary to the state republican
committee, and was also at one
time editor of the official organ of the
State Federation of Women's Clubs.
According to a dispatch from Salt

ington several days ago to argue, a
case before the United States supreme
court. Mrs. Eradley left the
city two days after Brown's departure.
Her friend3 announced that she
had gone to San Francisco.
About three years ago a charge involving
immoral conduct waa filed
against Senator Brcwn and the Bradley
woman by Senator Brown's wife.
Before the case came to trial Mrs.
Brown withdrew her charge and
Brown was released. Mrs. Bradley
pleaded guilty. Before sentence was
imposed, however, she was permitted
to withdraw her plea and the charge
against her was dismissed. The wife
of Senator Brown died about two
years ago.
LONE ROBBER RAIDS BANK
But Failed to Make Good and Was
Forced to Surrender.
'After a daring attempt to rob the
J. V. Brinkrcan Company bank at
Great Bend, Kas., a man who gave
his name as George A. Lewis, of
Kansas City, was surrounded and captured.
Eud Westfall, a driver for the
Wells-Fargo Express Company, was
killed by a shot fired by one of the
pursuers.

BAR CONVICT GOODS
Each State is Given Prerogative
by the House.
A STRENUOUS SESSION
Democrats Oppose Porto Rican Franchise?Three-Cornered
Appropriation
Bill Introduced and Made
Special Order.
A Washington special says: By a
practically unanimous vote the house
Friday passed the bill limiting the
regulation of interstate commerce between
the several states in articles
manufactured by convict labor or in
any prison or reformatory. The bill
was introduced by Mr. Hunt of Missouri,
a practical stone-mason.
Under the Wilson bill, which became
a law in 1890, convict labor
made goods may enter into active
competition with goods manufactured
by "free labor," and under this federal
law a state could not pass a law
that would prevent the shipping into
the state prison made goods of other
states. The law passed abrogates the
interstate commerce law, as at present
applied to convict made goods, thereby
affording to the different states and
territories the right to inhibit the
shipping of convict made goods within
the confines of any state or territory.
Mr. Hunt asked for its passage not
only for the interest of the free labor,
but in the interest of the manufacturers.
He said it was an attempt to
curb the criminal competition of the
f U 4 ! ? f?A/\ 1 oKrvw Af A
pcun-trutiai ^ wim iuc ucv iouui vi tuo
country.
"It is cruel," he said, "to ask the
free labor of this country to maintain
its dignity and its self-respect,
if it has to wait until the product of
the state prison is sold before the
employer can get a reasonable price
for his honestly manufactured products."
Other speeches were made by Sherley
of Kentucky, Gaines of Tennessee,
Henry of Texas and Grosvenor of
Ohio.
The democrats in the house opposed
the consideration of the bill
conferring .United States citizenship on
the inhabitants of Porto Rico. Chairman
Cooper of \V5sconsin, under the
call of the committees, called the attention
of the house to the erroneous
position of the bill on the union calendar,
insisting that its proper place
was on the house calendar.
Mr. Clark of Missouri, leading the
minority, objected to its transfer, but
Speaker Cannon decided with Mr.
Cooper that it properly belongs on
the house calendar, which would give
it a different status than on the union
calendar. The chairman of the
committee on insular affairs attempted
to have it called up for consideration.
Again Mr. Clark protested, insisting
that the house had a ngnt 10 nave
notice of the possible consideration of
the measure. The speaker sustained
the protest, and the bill went over.
The discussion disclosed a determination
of the democrats to fight the
measure whenever possible.
With an appropriation of $20,000,000
and provisions barring "simplified
spelling" in documents authorized by
law or ordered by congress, the legislative,
executive and judicial appropriation
bill for 1906 was reported to
the house by the appropriations committee.
which was made a special order
for Monday.
The amount carried by the bill is
$685,842 less than the estimates. The
appropriation for the current fiscal
year aggregated $30,168,4485. The entire
number of salaries carried in the
bill is 14,727, or 220 less than included
in the estimates therefor, and
29 more than provided for the current
year. An increase from $1,200 to $1,400
is made in the allowance to members
of the house for clerk hire, and the
requirement that members certify tliev
have spent this amount is omitted.
The appropriation for miscellaneous
expenses for the y^ar Is cut from $100,000
to $50,000. The salary of the secretary
to the speaker is increased
from $3,000 to $4,000.
GEORGIA REFORMATORY OPENED
Fact is Announced in Proclamation by
the Governor.
The Georgia state reformatory in
Balldwin county is now open for the
reception of inmates, and all persons
under sixteen years of age, convicted
of crime, will be sent there by the
courts in accordance with the terms
of the law under which this institution
was eestablished.
Governor Terrell, in accordance with
the provisions of the law, has issued
his proclamation directed to the judges
over the state, calling their attention
:o this fact.
INFORMATION FORTHCOMING.
Secretary Taft Will Comply With
Penrose's Request.
The resolution of Senator Penrose,
passed Thursday, calling on the president
for facts regarding the discharge
of the negro troops belonging to the
twenty-fifth Infantry, was received at
the white house Friday, and at once
turned over by tne president to Secretary
Taft, who will furnish the information
desired.
I FINLEY MADE PRESIDENT
i
Of the Southern Railway to Succeed
Lamented Sam Spencer?Directors
Hold Meeting in New Ycrk.
The directors of- the Southern railway,
in session at New York, Wednesday,
elected W. W. Finlev of Washington,
president of the company, to
succeed the late Samuel Spencer. Mr.
Fir.ley has' been second vice president
of the road since September 15,
1890. He has been in active railway
service since 1875.
Prior to <er/;ering the Southern's
j service Mr. Fin ley was second vice
president of the Great Northern railway;
before that he was .third vice
president of the Southern railway. For
two years he was chairman of the
Southeastern Passenger Association at
Atlanta, Ga Mr. Finiey was at times
associated with James J. Hill.
The election of Mr. Finiey caused
very general satisfaction in the Washington
railroad world, and it is believed
this feeling will extend among
! railroad men throughout the south.
EGGS FILLED WITH ACIDS
Used Against Strike-Breakers by the
Strikers in Chicago.
A startling exposure of the methods
employed in the teamsters' strike of
last spring was given in the trial of
Cornelius P. Shea and his fellow labor
leaders before Judge Ball, in the
criminal court at Chicago Wednesday,
when Joseph Schultz, alleged slugger.
who, with Albert Young, turned
state's evidence, was on the stand as
witnesses for the state. Schultz declared
that Shea had told him to break
the legs and arms of the strike-breakers,
and especfally to attack the ne
b * o.
When this means of bringing about
desired results did not work satisfactorily.
Schultz asserted that Shea ordered
the hired pickets to throw eggs
filled with acids at the horses being
driven by non-union men. The acid
throwers, according to Schultz, were
responsible for many runaways, and
were considered a great aid in the
fight against the employers.
"Myself and other pickets were called
into the picket headquarters, and
our captain gave us a number of eggs.
The contents had been removed and
the shells filled with acids. Shea was
there, and told us that if we carried
out the plan proposed it would create
a stir among the strike-breakers. Shea
said that if this scheme was not successful
he had another In mind that
he believed would do the work. He
said he had seen a man squirt acid
from a syringe at ft team of horses
being driven by a non-union teamster,
and that six policemen were unable
to stop the runaway that resulted
in State street, which was crowded
with traffic at the time."
TO PACIFY CALIFORNIA*^
I ?
; President Explains Expression in a
Message Regarding Japs.
A Washington special says: The
California delegation in congress has
received what they consider satisfactory
assurance that the president did
not desire to be understood as saying
in the Japanese section of his message
that he would use military force
of the United States in forcing Japanese
into the California schools, in
which white children are taught. It
is said to have been his purpose to
convey the idea that he would use
the military to protect Japanese
v against mob violence. Californians
take no offense at this interpretation
of the message.
Inquiry Wednesday disclosed the
fact that the legal proceedings to be
taken in San Francisco by the United
States district attorney in the mat-\
ter of admission of Japanese to the
public schools of that city without
discrimination, were inspired by Secretary
Root, who expressed the opinion.
that it would be one way of effectively
disposing of the controversy.
That the president's views on the
subject met with the hearty approval
of the Japanese government was
uade evident Wednesday when Viscount
Aofi, the Japanese ambassador,
thnf hp had nersonally thanked
iplAlU V***-" ? ??? sr the
president for what he had said.
WOMAN NEARS GALLOWS.
High Court Refuses Application of
Mrs. Myers, of Kansas City,
The supreme court of the Unite 1
States, through Justice Brewer, has
denied the application of Mrs. Aggie
Myers, of Kansas City, Mo., for a writ
of error, which, if it Aad been allow- |
ed, would have had the effect of
bringing her cdse to that court. Mrs.
Myers is under sentence of death in
Missouri on the charge of murdering
her husband in Kansas City a year
or more ago. The effect of the decision
will be to leave the matter
in tv>r? hnnds nf thp state authorities.
SENATOR MORGAN FACETIOUS.
Says Panama Railroad is a "Legal Fiction
or Artificial Entity."
Senator Morgan Thursday addressed :
the senate on his resolution looking to
giving the Panama canal commisssion
control of the Panama railway.
Mr. Morgan spoke of the Panama ,
road as a "legal Action or an artificial
entity to enable this country to avoid
its responsibility as a common carrier."
A PROD FOR STORER
President Biffs Discharged
Consul With Big Stick.
MRS. STORER INVOLVED
Roocevelt Strenuously Denies Alleg*
tion That He Asked Pope to Give ^
Cardinal "Top Piece" to archbishop
Ireland.
The Chicago Tribune ia its Washington
dispatches Saturday stated that
"I" 1 f v? llDrt K/\ATI O /"l
au CAWiaviUiuai J uao u^u c?v*dressed
by Bellamy Storer to President
Roosevelt and the members of
his cabinet in regard to his dismissal
from the post cf ambassador of the
United States to Austria-Hungary.
Mr. Storer was dismissed because
of his wife's supposed interference
in affairs of the Roman Catholic
church and her alleged misuse of letters
from the president. It was also
charged that Mrs. Storer had meddled
with French politics by taking part in
anti-republican intrigue to promote
the marriage of Victor Bonaparte
with a member of the Orleanist
family.
Both of these charges Mr. Storer
denies and, on the other hand, declares
that the president's interest
in the selection of Archbishop Ireland
as a cardinal was not due to Storer
or to Storer's wife, but to the president
alone.
The text of Mr. Storer's letter waa
printed aud transmitted not only to
the president and his cabinet, but to
members of the foreign relations committee
of the senate. Mr. Storer
says that his removal in so summary
a manner, suddenly dismissing
him from an office which he had been
given reason to believe he nad filled
to the satisfaction of both his own
government and that to which he
was accredited and being accompanied
by no public explanation, exposed
him to suspicious and injurious
conjectures such as must, naturally
arise when a man in public office is
abruptly dismissed by his government.
The correspondence shows the familiar
relations of the president and
the Storers from the lime Mr. Roosevelt
was governor of New York until
just after the Spanish war. Some
of the Roosevelt letters to Store c
were addressed "My dear Bellamy,"
and to his wife, "My dear Maria,"
and Mrs. Storer addressed the president
as "Dear Theodore."
President Wields Big Stick.
A Washington special says: President
Roosevelt Sunday night made
oublic a long letter addressed to Sec
retary Root, giving correspondence
between the president and former Ambassador
Bellamy Storer, at Vienna,
Austria, and Mi's, .Storer, in whioh he
says that Mr. Storer's refusal to answer
his letters and the publication
of various private letters justified
the ambassador's removal; that Mr.
Storer's publication of private correspondence
was peculiarly ungentlemanly,
and that he (the president)
had stated with absolute clearness his
position, the reason why it was out
of the question for him as president to
try to get any archbishop made car-,
diual. He ;ays he thinks It well
that the cabinet members should
knew certain facts "which he (Storer)
either suppressed or misstates."
He says he did not resent the action
of the Storers "until it became
evident they were likely to damage
American interests."
He says Mrs. Storer urged him to
give her husband a cabinet place and
that she stated that Mr. Choate, at
Loudon, and General Porter, at Paris.,
were not proper persons to be ambassadors,
suggesting her husband in
-. -
that connection. 1 ne presiuunt incorporates
a letter from Postmaster
General Cortelyou contradicting tho
statement that President McKinley ;
had commissioned a gentleman to ask
the pcpe, "as a personal favor to
him," and as "an honor to the country,"
to appoint Archbishop Ireland
as cardinal. Mr. Cortelyou says the
late president never made any such
request. The president declares that
Mr. Storer's statement that he authorized
any such message' to be delivered.
to the pope is untrue. He
says that he never received a letter
from Ambassador Storer giving an account
of his visit to the Vatican, and
of the message he personally gave the
pope on behalf of Mr. Roosevelt.

THE RAWLINGS' CRIME. |
Brief History of DastaVdlly Murder of
Carter Children, the Last Chapter
of Whijh Has Just Been Closed. *
The commutation of the death sentence
to life imprisonment of the Rawj
lings boys for the murder of the little
| Carter children, terminates one of the
i most famous criminal cases in the
court annals of Georgia. In brief the > . .4
history of that bloody crime is as
follows:
Old man Rawlings and Carter were >3
neighbors, living about twelve miles .%a
from Valdosta, Ga. Both had been
preachers?Carter a Methodist and
Rawlings a Baptist. They quarreled ^
over a land line and a feud began, ' ^
which was long drawn out Conflicts- %
were of frequent occurrence, when
Anally Rawlings concocted a plot to r y,
| dispose of the whole Carter family.
A negro preacher named Frank Tupner
was building a chimney for Rawlings
and to him was confided the /tg
task of employing somebody to dis- .,yM
pose of Carter. Aif Moore was found
at Lenox and was brought to Raw- .
lings' house and a conference between '^|||
him and Rawlings occurred. Accord- i||l
ing to the negro's story Rawlings told
him what was wanted and outlined |||
the bloody scheme to him. It was for ^|?
the negro, in company with the three 4||
Rawlings boys, to go to Carter's house,
that night, kill him and his wife, their ;|JJ
older children, then fire the house and
kill the little children as they came J|
out. Rawlings gave the negro a knife /||j
with which to cut their throats. JjJjS
The negro was also conducted to a
little house in the field where he was
to remain until night. His meals were --''i^
furnished him there, together with a- $jj|
watermelon. The vessel in which the ^
meal was carried, the crocus sack ^
which held the melon and even tne
rinds played important parte in the.CjB
trial, all going to verify statements
which the negro made.
That night the elder R&wlings went .;B|
to Valdosta, 12 miles away, in order |
that he might divert suspicion from
himself or be able to prove an alibi.
The bloody massacre that had been >'-J|
planned so well was carried out only 'Sm '
in part. That it was not entirely
successful was due to the use which - m
Carter made of the rifle and gun while JH
barricaded' in his house.
Just after the Carter family had
their supper and while the mother
and older daughter were clearing off >
the supper table the assailants of tha;'5.^te
| family approached from the rear of ^gg
the home. The little dog was
i tracted and began to bark. Carrie-^B
i and Willie Carter had been looking
j after a little sick calf during, th*
| day and they ran to the yard to. see.^H
j that nothing was bothering the
As the two children neardd a crack in
I the fence where they expected to go
! through, the assassins halted under.ji^B
peach tree and fired. The first'shot
was at the boy, who fell to the ground. ?3k
His sister ran to .him, exclaiming, "Oh, jH
Willie! are you hurt " when another "JB
shot was fired. The evidence in court
indicated that the two shots were fired ,|
at once?one by Milton and one by j
Jesse Rawlings. It was conceded at the ;-|
trial that Milton shct both of theI
children ?nd that Jessp also shot thO 72x9
W. L. Carter, who was crippled la .jig
the ankle. In a previous fight with old
man Rawlings, had ambled to the door ~~'M
to call the children back into the house J
and saw both of the shots. He then
closed the door and barricaded his Jf
j family on the inside. In a few minutes .
the little wounded boy struggled to
the door and his mother jerked him ,
in. He lingered during the night and ^
died early the next mprning. He told ?>Jj
his parents that the Rawlings boys
killed him.
The assassins remained about the
house until far after midnight trying , "v||
to get a shot at other members of the
family. After several hours, accordlng
to the evidence, Jesse Rawlings
got an armful of shucks and threw
them under the front steps for the pur- '-|||
pose of firing the house. Carter's
! daughter, however, ripped . a board
from the inside of the house, making %|i
[ an opening through which Carter ; "*JS
poked his gun and fired, the loa? of vjj
shot barely missing one of the boys^ icg
That frightened them and some time ^||
later they gave up the job. Alf Moore
left the scene soon after Carter's shot
was fired, declaring that the old man :*;f|
was going to kill somebody. When he
was arrested at Lenox he told the story
of the night's doings, his story
tallying with the statements that had
been made by Carter and his family M
almost to the letter. Even the conversation
that passed between the ^
boys on the outside was told by him ^
Just as Carter and his family heard it
A coroner's jury charged the boys
and a negro with the crime. The boys' 'y
tracks across the field toward home was
one of the strong pieces of evidence
against them.
