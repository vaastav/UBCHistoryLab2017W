GOVERNOR SENDS COM
PLIMENTS TO MILITIA
Commends Guard Officers and Men for
Conduct in Butte Trouble.
The officers and enlisted men of
company K, Montana national guard,
have received a letter from Governor
Stewart complimenting them on their
soldierly bearing and their conduct
during the time Butte was under mar
tial law. The letter follows:
"Now that you have returned to
your home stations and put off the
cares of military duty after the pro
tracted service in Silver Bow county,
I am impelled by my admiration of
your conduct in a trying time to give
formal utterance to my appreciation
of the spirit that has animated the
troops throughout.
"It was with no lack of apprecia
tion of the extreme seriousness of the
situation that I debated the question
of sending the national guard into the
disturbed zone. But it became appar
ent that there could be no resoration
of law and order in that community
without a resort to the aid of the
military arm of the government. The
crisis was upon us—a crisis the grav
ity of which was realized by all who
were at all conversant with conditions
in
state s
metropolis

step of calling upon the national
guard.
Had Desire for Peace.
"In doing this I was animated only
by a desire to restore peace to the
people of the city that had been ter
rorized by the lawless. The orders
for the mobilization of the troops and
for their moving to Butte was issued
in the firm belief that you would at
tain the end desired and that the
power of the law to protect the peace
able would be vindicated. By your
acts since that first day of September
you have more than justified that
opinion.
"It therefore becomes a pleasure
and privilege for me to thus publicly
extend to the officers and men of the
Second infantry my sincerest appre
ciation of and heartfelt thanks for
your services. When the state called
upon you in her hour of stress you
responded with a promptness that
showed an exemplary devotion to duty
—many of you, no doubt, going into
service at a personal sacrifice.
"Through all the days of your stay
in Butte your record was one that the
guard may well look back upon with
pride. Your loyalty and patriotism
were put to the severest test, and it
will be said to your lasting glory that

"That your response and service
won the approbation of all lovers of
peace and order in government
throughout the state there can be no
slightest doubt And my firm convic
tion is that the people will not forget
your quick action and loyal answer to
the call in time of need.
"Because of all this 1 feel amply
justified in conveying to you and each
of you, rank and file, on behalf of the
people of Montana, hearty congratula

have rendered. And I wish for you

Commander in Chief."
THE FARMERS' BOOK SHELF
With the return of long winter eve
nings, the farmer has considerable
leisure time which he can use in
most profitable way, if he is so in
clined. The careful study of books
and bulletins adapted to his locality
will give the reader a better under
standing of his work, and be a means
of increasing his earning capacity.
Any business man of to-day who ex
pects to keep in the front ranks spends
considerable time studying the suc
cesses of other men in his line of work.
Surely it is just as essential that the
farmer should do the same. Twenty
five years ago book farming was con
sidered a joke; to-day farming is con
sidered one of the most complex busi
nesses, and the man who follows this
line of work should realize that to
get the most out of it he cannot study
it too thoroughly.
It is the ambition of every man who
farms to increase his yearly income.
We cannot hope to do this by the
addition of extra acres, but by in
creasing the productive capacity of
those contained in the farm. To do
this a man must plan, keep in touch
with his fellow farmers, and learn to
take advantage of every opportunity
presented.
presented.
At a small expense any man can
secure a few of the most practical
books on managing the soil, feeds and
feeding, and care and management of
the live stock. Again, bulletins are
available through many sources, and
by careful selection you can secure
such as are practical and adapted to
your particular locality. This avail
able information, with one or two
good farm papers, should furnish any
man with some helpful advice and in
spire him to seek more.
There is another side to this ques
tion: that is the fact that a few books
I on the subject of farming will stimu
I late a greater interest among the boys
! and girls on the farm. They soon
I realize that there is something worthy
of a little thought in connection with
farming, and are not liable to be so
anxious to get away from the farm.—
J. C. Taylor County Agriculturist.
AMERICAN COMMON 8ENSE
If asked, Are you ready to defend
yourself? we reply, most assuredly, to
the utmost; and yet we shall not
turn America into a military camp.—

preservation. A man may believe that
it is his duty to protect his home
against a burglar with a pistol, and
yet uphold a law that forbids citizens
to carry weapons.
What is true of the individual in
this respect is true of the nation. Na
tional defense of a thoroughly ade
quate nature against any possibility
of invasion is essential to the very
existence of our Republic. But this
does not mean or imply militarism.
The trouble with a large number of
well-meaning enthusiasts in the Coun
try is that they rush to extremes so
easily. An ultra-pacifist is just as
dangerous as a radical militarist; and
American common sense is going to
steer clear of both types of zealot
For this reason, it is to be devoutly
hoped that this entire question of mil
itary preparedness can be raised above
the plane of party politics. We are
too big a people in our national aims
and ideals to examine so serious a
matter upon the basis of narrow par
tisanship.
What we all wish to consider sole
ly and absolutely is the best interests
of the United States, and this being
the case, it would be most unfortun
ate for our welfare, as a whole, if an
attempt is made to split the discus
sion in Congress or out of Congress
along the lines of a political issue.
This was the irreparable mistake
made over slavery.
Therefore, the man in the street,
the sound, hard-headed American
voter should refrain from "taking
sides" upon this subject until he is
competently informed by the proper
authorities. Nothing is more fool
hardy than passionate championship
based upon ignorance. Let us wait
and hear what the accredited experts
have to say.—Minneapolis Journal.

EXPOSITION NOTES
Hon. Frank Eliel, representative
from Beaverhead county to the state
Legislature, is an enthusiast on the
Panama-Pacific exposition. Mr. Eliel
is a world-wide traveler and has stud
ied the art and beauty of both hemis
pheres. He has attended every world's
fair and every exposition and has
made a study of the best that has
been shown at every exposition. But
his opinion the Panama-Pacific
exposition will rival if not eclipse
anything of the kind ever attempted
and it will be particularly interesting
and valuable to western people. In
speaking of the great exposition which
begins the first of the year Mr. Eliel
has said:
The visitor to the Panama-Pacific
exposition is prepared for immensity.
Descriptions of other world's fairs
or personal acquaintances with them,
may lead the visiting tourist to be
lieve that there can be no surprises in
store for him. For this reason he
will have the greatest surprises of all.
Mere size does not obtrude itself.
The exposition grounds and palaces
are probably larger than those others
with which we were so familiar, but
here we are not oppressed with im
mensity.
"The immediate effect upon the
the holder," continued Mr. Eliel, "of
the exposition buildings at San Fran
cisco and of their surroundings, is one
of charm ; the effect is one of invitation
the visit promises to be a joy rather
than something like the seven labors
of Hercules. All this results from
the perfection with which the exposi
tion fits into its setting; it is restful
and quieting, nature and art Archi
tectural splendor there is, but it is
subordinated to harmony, harmony
of color, harmony of masses. There
are courtyards where one longs to
linger, always with a glimpse of the
blue bay with its hilly islands, green
and purple and distant mountains.
The Panama-Pacific exposition offers
not mere overpowering architectural
pretentiousness and vastness, like
Chicago, nor standing freakishness,
like Paris. But" concludes Mr.
Eliel, "it promises to be satisfying,
rather than amazing."
