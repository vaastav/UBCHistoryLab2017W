Crowds Tlirong the Galleries.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The attend
ance upon the opening session of the
senate, both on the floor and in the gal
leries, was notably large, despite of the
•well understood fact that little business
beyond the presentation of the presi
dent's message and the proceedings in
cident thereto would be transacted
Prior to the convening of the senate
the members passed half an hour in ex
changing greetings. Mr. Hanna of
Ohio, who has been ill for a week, was
given a cordial reception by his Repub
lican colleagues. Mr. Wolcott of Colo
rado, one of the members of the inter
national monetary commission, was
also given a warm greeting. Dr. W.
Godfrey Hunter of Kentucky, the re
cently appointed minister to Guate
mala, was an interested spectator of the
proceedings from a seat besi.de his
friend, Senator Deboe.
Charles Page Bryan, the new United
States minister to China, was a notable
figure in the reserved gallery, and in
the diplomatic gallery were several
members of the Chinese legation and
several other members of other lega
tions.
Senator Money, the new senator from
Mississippi, entered the senate soon
after the recess, but the oath was not
administered to him during the session.
The reception and reading of the
president's message was the only feat
ure of the day.
The opening day of the regular ses
sion in the house passed without un
usual incident of any character. The
formalities attending the inauguration
of the session are dry and except as a
spectacle hardly repaid the crowds
which thronged the public and private
galleries. Yet with a few exceptions
the visitors staid through the whole
proceedings.
Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of the
majority Mr. Bailey, the recognized
leader of the minority, and Grosvenor
(O.) enjoyed the distinguished honor of
being appointed to wait npon the presi
dent, whose message was, of course, the
event of the day. Its reading was long
and tedions, but it was followed with
close attention by the members and the
spectators in the galleries. There was
no demonstration nntil the reading
was concluded, when the Republicans
joined in a hearty expression of ap
proval. Immediately after the read
ing of the message the house adjourned
out of respect to the memories of Sena
tor George of Mississippi and Represen
tative Wright of Massachusetts, who
had died during the recess.

PRESIDENT BACK IN CANTON.
Mother McKinley Kallies and Recognizes
Him—Relapses Into Unconsciousness.
CANTON, O., Dec. 8.—Once more the
children of Mrs. Nancy McKinley have
gathered around her couch, made sacred
by her tenacious struggle agamst death.
The reunion is complete. The presi
dent arrived before the death angel had
made his visit and took with him the
spirit of the aged mother. The scene
was a pathetic one that beggars de
scription. In the midst of it all, there
was a joy unspeakable in the breast of
the president. He had again been per
mitted to see his mother alive He had
answered all the obligations of his
country. He had fulfilled his vows to
his people He had witnessed the as
semblage of congress and had been
cheered with the news at the same
time that his mother was better. In
the little upper room at the McKinley
homestead this morning there was a
scene almost too sacred for pen to write.
The eyes of all present were filled with
tears as they witnessed the remarkable
and almost miraculous rally of the
president's mother from the uncon
scious state into which she had fallen
early in the morning. As her son en
tered the room accompanied by his wife
and Miss Mabel McKinley, the sister of
the president, Miss Helen said:
"Mother, here are William and Ida."
The president kneeled by her bedside,
kissed his mother tenderly, reverently,
and as he did so she put her arms
around his neck and signified that she
knew him. She also recognized the pres
ident's wife and reached her hand to
ward her. She recognized Mabel Mc
Kinley and Jack Duncan. It seemed to
friends that she had been awaiting the
arrival of her son. Soon after she
lapsed into an unconscious state,, and
the strength that had been husbanded
for the last meeting of mother and son
seemed to leave her. An hour after
his arrival, the president sat by the bed
side, holding the hand of his mother.
The attending physician was surprised
at the remarkable rally.
HOLECHECK MURDERS HIS WIFE!
Nebraska Farmer Then Tries to Drown
Himself, But Is Rescued.
FALLS CITY, Neb., Dec. 7.—Last night
at 9 o'clock Joseph Holechek, a pros
perous farmer, living four and one-half
miles southwest of Humboldt in this
county, shot and killed his wife. After
shooting his wife, Mr. Holechek at
tempted to kill his hired man, and fail
ing this, attempted to suicide by trying
to drown himself. He is now confined
in the city jail at Humboldt awaiting
his preliminary hearing, which will
come off today. The feeling is very in
tense against him, and some fear of
lynching is felt.
Holechek had been drinking during
the day. He returned home from town
at 4 o'clock and had a quarrel with his
wife, who started to leave the house for
her brother's. Holechek followed and
shot at her from the door, but missed.
He then ran after her and, grabbing her
by the hair, threw her down, holding
her with his left hand, and shot her in
the left side.
After shooting his wife Holechek
turned his gun on the hired man, who
had witnessed the deed and had come
to the rescue. The gun snapped and
the latter took it away from the crazed
man. The murderer jumped into the
stock tank to drown himself, but was
pulled out and bound by relatives of the
dead woman, being bruised considera
bly in his capture.

COMMISSION GRANTS EXTENSION.
Railroads Will Be Given .More Time to
Comply With Couplet- Law.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The .hearing
given by the interstate commerce com
mission on the questiou of extending
the time within which the railroads of
the country may comply with the pro
visions of the car coupler and train
brak8 act is concluded at noon. The
commission intends to take some sup
plemental testimony under oath before
coming to a decision. There seems to
be no doubt whatever that an extension
will be granted and that the extension
will be general in character, the hear
ing having demonstrated tuat any dis
crimination would fall as heavily on
roads which have complied with the
law as on those which have thus far
disregarded it.
The impression among both railroad
men and labor leaders who were pres
ent at the hearing is that the extension
granted by the commission will be a
compromise. The railroad representa
tives asked for five years, with the con
dition that one-fifth of the unequipped
rolling stock of each company should be
equipped eash year, and the representa
tives of the railroad organizations pro
tested against an extension in excess of
one year. Three years is generally be
lieved to be the maximum extension
which the commission will grant. The
commission is evidently in great doubt
as to their ability to impose conditions
on an extension, and it may be that
they will grant but a year's extension
at a time, with the understanding that
against those roads who do not com
plete their equipment during that pe
riod the law shall become operative.
$200,000 BLAZE AT LA CROSSE.
"Brick" Pomeroy Block and McMillan
Opera House Destroyed.
LACROSSE, Wis., Dec. 4.—The worst
fire that has visited this city for years
occurred about midnight. Of the old
"Brick" Pomeroy block and the Mc
Millan opera house block this morning,
only the tottering walls remain. The
lower floors of the burned buildings
were occupied by H. H'eil & Sons, shoes
Allen's news stand Langstad & Waters,
musical instruments S. Bowlby,branch
of W. W. Kimball Co. the Drummond
Co., jewelers,and Miller Bros.' morgue.
The second floor was taken up with of
fices, while on the first floor was the
old McMillan opera hall, now used as
the armory for Company of the Na
tional Guard. On this floor, all the
stores of the company were kept, and
when the fire reached the powder and
shells, the explosion was terrific. The
loss can hardly be estimated at this
time, but will exceed $200,000. The
greater part of this is covered by insur
ance. Six firemen were injured, three
seriously. The McMillan opera house
was owned by the McMillan estate and
will probably be rebuilt.
Urge Changes In Handling of Criminals.
AUSTIN, Dec. 5.—The National Prison
association today decided that it would
hold their next annual meeting in In
dianapolis. The most important busi
ness of the morning session was the
submission of the report from the ct
mittee on criminal law reform. 1 he
report stated .that the progress of crime
was soinet.ling' frightful and rec
ommends that it should be most suc
cessfully checked by the following
changes in the handling of the crimi
nals of the world Greater severity of
punishment, doing away with all tech
nicalities in trials abolishment of
juries, making conviction more sum
mary and trial more speedy depriving
defendants of the right to appeal to a
higher court., and offering rewards for
the discovery and conviction of crimi
nals.

SENSATIONAL SPURT IN WHEAT.
December Jumped Up Three Cents on an
Attempt to Buy 15,000 Bushels.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—Outside of a sensational
spurt in December wheat, which took place
shortly after the opening, grain and provision
markets were dull and uninteresting today.
A jump of 3 cents in December on an attempt
to buy about 15,000 bushels strengthened the
belief that that option is very securely "cor

USIGRIRTS-
Comptroller Eckels* Report.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The annual re
port of James H. Eckels, comptroller of
the currency for the year ended Oct. 81,
1897, opens with a brief review of the
history of the legislation which consti
tutes the present national bank act, and
invites the attention of congress to
amendments to the law recommended
in former reports without specifically
repealing them. The report contains
the latest compiled statistics relative to
the world's monetary systems and the
stock of gold, silver and paper curren
cy. A very interesting feature of this
statement is the per capita amount of
each kind of money in the countries
named. The per capita averages in the
principal countries of the world are as
follows: United States, 70 United
Kingdom, $20.65 France, 184.(38 Ger
many, $18.95 Austria-Hungary, $9.33,
and Russia $8.95. The comptroller re
news his recommendation of last year,
urging that national bank examiners be
paid an annual salary instead of fees as
now.
Griggs Has Accepted.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—It was officially
announced at the White house on the
return of the president to Washington
that Governor John Griggs of New
Jersey has been tendered and has ac
cepted the office of attorney general,
which will be vacated by the nomina
tion of Attorney General McKenna to
be associate justice of the United States
supreme court. It has not yet been set
tled when Governor Griggs shall as
sume his new office, but it is probable
that the date will be about the begin
ning of the new year.
Bryan Hunting Ducks.
GALVESTON, Tex., Dec. 8.—Hon. W.
J. Bryan reached here today and left
with a party of friends for Lake Sur
prise to hunt ducks. The party will be
gone three or four days. Mr. Bryan
expressed himself as follows on the
president's message: "The message
indicates an intention upon the part of
the president to aid in turning the issue
of paper money over to the national
banks and in the meantime a purpose
to give gold a further superiority over
silver as money.''
Schaeft'er Beats Ives.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.—-It was a, new
champion against the old at Madison
Square Garden last night. Ives against
Schaeffer and the old champion won.
By far the largest crowd that has yet
attended any game of the tournament
saw the game which was worthy of the
two experts who crossed cue3. There
were several brilliant runs in the game
and Schaeffer topped the list with 85.
Score Schaeft'er, 500 Ives, 401.
Court Martial For Esterhazy.
PARIS, Dec. 5.—The military gov
ernor of Paris, General Saussier, has or
dered a court martial to examine into
the charges brought against Count
Esterhazy, the retired major of the
French army who is accused of writing
the letter which brought about the sen
tencing of Alfred Dreyfus to imprison
ment for life. The Journal says that
the decision of General Saussier is based
on the report of General Pelleiux, who
was appointed by the minister of war
to examine into the charges brought
against Count Esterhazy, and which
was as follows: "So far as Dreyfus is
concerned, the case has been tried, no
new facts have been brought to light
and no new documents submitted to
justify a revision of the trial. In con
sequence, there is no ground for pro
ceeding against Count Esterhazy so far
as regards the crime of high treason,
for which Alfred Dreyfus was con
demned."
Hawaiian Natives Will Protest.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—The delegation
of native Hawaiians, who have come to

any statement concerning their mission
beyond the fact that they were here to
present a protest, adding that they
would bp able to say more in a day er
two.

GERMAN MARINES KILL THREE CET

Occurs During Skirmish to Capture thf
Villages Surrounding Kiao Chau Itaji
lr. Stuebei, German Consul at Sjiangt
liai, Ordered to lliiao Chau.
BERLIN, Dec. 8.—Emperor William,
has ordered the number of volunteenr
for the China expedition to be in
creased to ],000 men.
LONDON, Dec. 8.—A special dispatck
from Shanghai says: On Friday last
Captain Becker with 210 German ma
rines left Kiao Chau bay to occupy the
surrounding villages, whence they pro
ceeded to capture the city. The Chi
nese forts opened fire and the German*
replied, killing three of the garrison*
which thereupon fled in disorder. The
Chinese general in command was cap
tured, but afterward liberated. Sev
eral German sailors were injured by
6tones flung by the inhabitants of the
village, In return for this the head
men of these villages were beaten witk
bamboo sticks by order of the Germa*
commander.
It is reported here that China is will
ing to pay an indemnity of 1,000,006
taels ($785,250) and to grant all the Ger
man demands, including the temporary
cession of Kiao Chau bay and adjoin
ing territory.
A dispatch to The Times from Pekin
confirm the report that China, hoping
for the evacuation of Kiao Chau. agree*
unconditionally to all demands of Ger
many.
The Times, dealing editorially with,
the situation at Kiao Chau, notes that
the foregoing telegram enumerating the
German demands, does not include the
permanent occupation of Kiao Chan
and points out that the evidence is con
flicting as to whether this was officially
demanded. It says: "In any ease,,
now that the other demands have been
conceded, what will be the grounds for
insisting on a permanent occupation?
The double success in Hayti and China,
demonstrating the practical value of a
strong fleet ready, to act at short notice
in any part of the world, will probably
give a coup de grace to "the declining
opposition to the naval bill."
BERLIN, Dec. 8.—Dr. Stuebei, the
German consul at Shanghai, has been
ordered to go to Kiao Cliau and estab
lish a regular German administration.
The Kolnische Volks Zeitung says that
the coal deposits in the province of
Shan Tung, which will become avail
able to Germany, with railway and
mining concessional, are most valuable.
HAYTI YIELDS TO FORCE.
Her Difference With Germany Appears to
Be Settled.
PORT AU PRINCE, Dec. 8.—The trouble
between Germany and Hayti appears
to be settled. The Haytian govern
ment has saluted the German flag, and
the foreigners who had sought refuge
on board ships in the harbor have re
turned to their homes.
It is understood that the question of
the indemnity demanded by Germany
for the alleged illegal arrest and impris
onment of Herr Lueders has been set
tled to the satisfaction of Germany and
that all the demands of that country
have been agreed to by the government
of Hayti in face of the display of force
made by Germany and under the threat
of a bombardment of the defensive
works of the port unless these demands
were agreed to within the eight hours
following the time the German ulti
matum was delivered yesterday morn
ing, shortly after the arrival at this
port of two German crnisers sent to
back up the demands of Germany. A
part of the settlement took place at 41
o'clock last night, when the Haytian
fleet formally sainted the German flag
from the flagship of the fleet of Hayti.
