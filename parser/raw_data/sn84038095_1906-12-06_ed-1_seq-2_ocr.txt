PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's message was read to
both branches of congress Tuesday.
It consists of a voluminous sermon of
some 26000 words and can be read
in full on pages 3 and 4 of this issue.
It contains nothing startling and
those who are interested in tariff re
vison, will find nothing in the mes
sage along this line, except that he
recommends the passage of the free
trade bill with the Filipenos, with
out, delay.
He asks for fair treatment toward
the Japanese and recommends the
passage of an act to naturalize Jap
ense who wish to become citizens and
he states that the Government has
not ample power through our courts
to protect .aliens in the rights secured
them through treaties.
Inheritance and income tax laws
are urged by nim as a means to stop
the enlarging of swollen fortunes.
A uniform divorce law. which has
been talked of so much over the states
is devised and it will not be long un
til such a law will be upon our statute
books.
Nothing is said about the rate bill,
pure food law. or meat inspection
bills, which bills were passed by con
gress last spring, although the presi
dent is in favor of amending the meat
inpsection law so that packers should
place dates upon all labels.
The President is greatly in favor" of
aiding and encouraging the develop
ment of American shipping.
Currency reform is advocated but
no special plan is suggested. The
withdrawal of the provisional govern
ment in Cuba is recommended as soon
as an election can be held and a
stable government installed. He pro'
claims war as honorable, but that
peace is desirable and that the main
tenance of a good army and navy is
Burest guarantee of peace.
Numerous other topics are touched
upon in the message and it will pay
every good citizen to read this vol
uminous message in full.
SHALL WE HAVE CHAUTAUQUA
It has been often suggested that
Denison should hold chautauquas and
seems to be no reason why we should
not. Denison is a beautiful town in
the summer, we have a large popula
tion. we have many people in Deni
son and vicinity who would like to
attend a good chautauqua. When the
new hotel is completed we will be in
condition to accomodate the large
number of people coming from out of
town to attend the chautauqua and
we also have such good railroad
facilities that people can come and
attend the entertainments at any time
and conveniently return home. San
City, Jefferson and Missouri Valley
have successfuly conducted these
chautauquas which have proven them
selves beneficial and instructive and
at the same time have greatly adver
tised the towns. Denison is a live,
up-to-date town and should come to
the front and give these summer en
tertainments, for there is no reason
why we cannot make possible what
Sac City, Jefferson and Missouri Val
ley can do.
Chautauquas furnish a variety of
different lectures and everybody at
tends a lecture to their liking.
Many elements contribute to make
a chautauqua a success—first of all it
presents something to please every
body. One wants a humorous lecture
and he gets it. Others want travel
talks and they get them beautifully
illustrated and presented by wide
awake. up-to-date newspaper war
correspondent?, who willingly risk
their lives on the firing line to be
near where thirds happen and get
the facts. Others want music and
they get lots of it, from the classic
strains of the Orchestra to the ever
popular plantation melodies of the
colored Jubilee folks. Others like
the fun and frolic of the moving pic
tures, and they are furnished plenty
of it along with the thrillning scenes
of war, earthquake, automobile races,
etc.
Yet one of the greatest factors of
9 Chautauqua is the meeting of old
friends and neighbors, the renewal of
old friendships, the latest news of
Cousin Bill and his new wife from
way out west.
During the month of December Mr.
Schlumberger will again present all
his old and new customers with a cal
endar and weather chart combined for
1907. Call at Schlumberger's Phar
macy.

Carelessness is largely responsible
for the yearly sacrifice of human life.
The other day two vessels on the
Pacific coast collided through the
carelessness of one of the wheelsmen
and one boat sank with forty lives
few days before two trains crashed
into each other and sixty poor creat
ures were offered as a burnt sacrifice
to somebody's carelessness. And so
it goes on day after day through the
year. Is it that human life is so
cheap?
We believe that the American peo
pleas a whole were never more hon
est in their business dealings than
they are today, yet it is evident that
in certain circles embezzlement is
usually prevalent. The Massachusetts
Cummissioner of Banking, as the re
suit of his investigations, says that
there is an average of one new case
of embezzlement for every day 'in
the year. This is a startling com
mentary upon that mad haste to
get rich which lures so many into
wild speculation and ultimate ruin,
and to the fast life which others fol
low with the same miserable ending.
The power of sympathy and the
effect of a wise appeal to their bet
ter side, in the effort to win way
ward boys and young men to honest
and useful lives are well seen in the
work accomplished by Judge Lindsey
in the Juvenile Court at Denver.
The old method of dealing with first
offenders resulted in making them
hardened criminals, for"• it was harsh,
stupid, and punitive only. The new
method, with it* sympathetic tact
and common sense treatment, is
saving thousands of young people who
under the old system, were it now in
operation, would become a curse to
society.
President Roosevelt has visited
foreign country and thereby 1:
broken the rule observed by his pre
decessors. Still nothing happened.
The sun did not stand still in silent
amazement at so rafeh a deed, nor
was there any convulsion of nature.
It may or may not be a wise thing
for a president to leave the bounds of
his country, but if the only objec
tion to his so doing is the fact that
no former president ever did it then
it may be that President Roosevelt's
action was an instance of a custom
being "more honored in the breach
than in' the observance..'' It is pos
sible to become hide-bound by pre
drawback in
may well
cedent. That is 'one
old-world countries
guard against.
we
Some of the society women of New
York have an uneviable faculty of
saying and doing foolish things. Must
certainly Mrs. Herbert Parsons trans
gresses the bounds of decency and
rationality in her book, "The Fam
ily.'' Her plea for experimental
marriages and free divorce causes
the moral sense to revolt. Society
and family life are disorganized too
much already. What is needed
something that will put society on
more wholesome basis and strength
en the family relation, on something
to further undermine them. Mrs
Parsons' so-called remedy would only
make the disease worse. The lot of
the poor children born of the union
she advocates would be pitiable in
the extreme.

CONVICTED OF MURDER IN
FIRST DEGREE.
MUST DIE IN ELECTRIC CHAIR
Jury Deliberates for Five Hours and
Reaches Verdict on Sixth Ballot.
Counsel for Convicted Man Will
Move to Have it Set Aside.
Herkimer, N. Y., Dec. 5.—The jury
In the trial of Chester ?3. Gillette for
the murder of his sweetheart, Grace
Brown, at Big Moose lake, on July 11
last,, returned a verdict of guilty in
the first degree.
Sentence will be pronounced tomor
row, to which time court adjourned
after the jury had reported. Former
Senator Mills, Gillette's counsel, before
adjournment, announced when court
reconvened tomorrow that he would
move to have the verdict set aside.
The jury, which had deliberated for
five hours, sent word that a verdict
had been reached. A moment later
they filed Into the court room and as
officer, who had been set for Gillette,
returned with the prisoner.
Pale and a trifle nervous, Gillette
faced the jury and when Marshall
Hatch, the foreman, declared that a
verdict of guilty in the first degree
had been found the youthful prisonei
gave no sign of emotion. A few min
utes later, when his counsel had an
nounccd his purpose of making forma
motion that the verdict be set asid
and the judge was dismissing the jur
ors, Gillette bent over a nearby table,
picking up a pencil, wrote something
on a sheet of paper. He then folded
the paper carefully and placed it in
his pocket. Immediately afterwards
he was taken from the court room
back to his cell in the jail.
It was learned that the jury had
some difficulty in reaching an agree
ment and that six ballots were taken
before the twelve men agreed. Up
to that time the jury had stood eleven
for conviction and one for acquittal.

seven to twenty persons is the report
of the loss of life. The name of only
one victim, however, has been ob
tained. Mrs. Joseph Throm, who, with
her husband and children, was caught
in a falling building and killed. The
other members of the family had nar
row escapes. One, of the saloons
Which was washed away carried sev
eral men into the torrent and are be
lieved to have been drowned.
