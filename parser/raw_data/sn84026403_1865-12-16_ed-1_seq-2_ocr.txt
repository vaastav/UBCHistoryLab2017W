neet eonli1crntion of Congrwe. The Sen
ary of the Trensur j will la; before you a
11 and detailed report of tho receipts and
isburserucnts of tho Inst fiscal year, of tliv
Erst quarter ot the present fiscal year, of the
probable receipt aud expenditure for the
other thrco quArttrs, anil the estimatts for
the year following tho 80th of June, 1800.
I nii!ht contont myself with a reference to
that report, in which you will find all the
information required for your deliberations
and decision. JBut the paramount impor
tance of the subject so presses itself on my
mind, that I cannot but lay before you my
Views of the measures which aro required
for the good character, and, I might also
ay, for the existence of this people.
The life of a republic lies certainly in the
energy, virtue aud intelligence of Hi citi
eens, but it is equally true tliut a good reve
nue system is the life of an organized Govern
ment. I meet you at a time when the nation
lias voluntarily burdened itself with a debt
unprecedented in our annuls. Vast as its
amount, it fades away into nothing when
compared with the countless blessings that
will be conferred upon our country and
upon man by the preservation of the na
tion's life. Now, on the first occasion of
tho meeting of Congress since the return of
peace, it is of the utmost importance to in
augurate a just policy, which shall at once
be put in motion, and . which shall com
mend itself to those who shull come alter
us for its continuance.
We must aim at nothing less than the
complete efl'acement of the finauciul evils
that necessarily follow a state ot war.
We must endeavor to apply the earliest
remedy to tjie dernugeil state of the curren
cy, and not shrink from devising u policy
which, without being oppressive to the peo
ple, shall immediately begia to effect a re
duction of the debt, aud, if persisted in,
discharge it fully within a definitely fixed
number of years.
It is our first duty to preparo in earnest
for our recovery from the ever increasing
evils of an irredeemable currency, without
a sudden revulsion, and yet without untime
ly procrastination. For that end we must,
each in our respective positions, prrpaio tlie
wav. I hold it the duty of the Executive
to insist upon frugality iu the expenditures;
and a sparing economy is itself a great na
tional resource. Of the bunks which au
thority has been given to issue notes secured
bv bonds of the United States, we may re
quire the greatest moderation and prudence,
and the law must be rigidly enforced when
its limits are exceeded.
We may, each one of us, counsel our ac
tive and enterprising countrymen to be
constantly on their guard, to liquidate
debts coutracted in a paper currency, and,
bv conducting business as nearly as possible
on a system of cash payments or abort cred
its, to hold themselves prepared to return to
the standard of gold and silver. To aid
our fellow citizens in the prudent manage
ment of their monetary affairs, the duty de
volves on us to diminish by law the amount
of money now in circulation.
Five years ago the bank note circulation
of the country amounted to not much more
than 1200,000,000. Now the circulation,
bank and national, exceeds $700,000,000.
The simple statement of the fact recom
mends more strongly than any . words of
mine could do, the necessity of our restrain
ing this expansion. The gradual reduction
of the currency is the ouly measure thatcan
Bave the business of the country from disas
trous calamities; and this can be almost
imperceptibly accomplished by gradually
funding the national circulation iu securities
that may be made redeemable at the pleasure
of the Government.
Our debt is doubly secure first in the
actual vreullh anil still greater undeveloped
resources of tits country; and next in the
character of our institutions. The most in
telligent observers among political econo
mists linvo not failed to remark, tliut the
Dublic debt of a country is sufu in propor
tion as its people are free; that the debt of
a republic is the safest of all. Our history
confirms and establishes the theory, nnd is,
I firmly believe, destined to give it a still
more signal illustration.
The secret of this superiority springs not
merely from the fact that in a republic the
national obligations are distributed more
widely through countless numbers in all
classes of society; it has its root in the char
acter of our laws. Here all men contribute
to the public welfare, and bear their fair
share of the public burdens. ' During thu
war, under the impulses of patriotism, tho
men of the great body of tho people, with
out regard to their own comparative want
of wealth, thronged to our armies and filled
our fleets of war, and held themselves ready
to offer their lives for the public good.
Now, in their turff, the property and income
of the country should bear their just pro
portion of the burden of taxation, while in
our impost system, through means of which
increased vitality is incidentally imparted
to ail the industrial interests of the nation,
the duties should be so adjusted (is to fall

A hope is entertained that tur ooinmeroe with the

will be wanting, on the part of this gorernment, to

of our fellow-oil isona. We receive from tho Powers
In that region assurance of good will ; nnd It It
worthy of note that nspoeiul envoy has brought n

cludes the old dotniuionsuf Carthage, on the African

Our tlomcsllo content now happily ended, has left
some traces incur relations with one. at lean, of the
great marutime Powers. The formal accordance oi
ulligerent rights to the Insurgent Nates was unpre
dentod, arid has nol been justified by the Issue, liut
iu the systems of neutrality pursued by the Powers
which wade that collection, there was a marked
difference The maturiuls of war for Ihe insurgent
States were furnished, itwi groat measure, from tho
workshops of Ureal firman, and British ships, manned
by British subject and prepared fur receiving Brit
ish nrinamenia, s.iile.l from Ihe porta of Uruut Uritian
to make war on American commerce, under the
shelter of a commission froui the insurgent states.
These ships, having once escaped fioin British
ports, eror afterwards entered thoin in every part of
the world, to refl:, and so to renew their depreda
tions. The consequences of this oonduct were most
disastrous to the Sluteg then in rebellion. Increasing
their desolation and misery by the prolongaticn of
our civil contest. It bad, moreover, ihe cllcet, to
great extont. to drive the American flg from tho
and to transfer much of our shipping and our
oommeroe to tho yery Power whose subjects had cre
ated Ihe necessity for such a cbauge. These events
took place before I was oalled to the administration
of the Government. The sincere desire for peaco
by which I am nnimatod led me to approve the pro
la sal. already made, to submit the quostions which
bad thus arisen between tho two ouuulrius to arbi
tration. These questions arc of such moment that
they hum have commanded the attention of
the great powers, auil are so interwoven with
tho peace and interests of every one of them
as to have insured an impartial decision. I
regret to inform you that Great Britain de
clined the arbitrament, but, ou the other
hand, Invited tls to the formation of a joiut
commission to' set tie mutual claims between
the two countries, from which those for the
depredations before' mentioned should be
excluded. The proposition, in that very ur
stWfnctory form, has been declined.
The United States did not present tho
subject as tin impenehmei.t of the good faith
of a Power which wus professing the most
friendly dispositions, but as involving ques
tions of public law, of which the settlement
is essential to the peace of nations; and,
though pecuniary reparation to their injured
citizens would have followed incidentally on
a decision against Great Britain, such com
pensation was not their primary object.
They li id a higher motive, and it was in the
interests of peuce and justice to establish im
portant principles of international law. The
correspondence will be placed before you.
The ground on which the British Minister
rests his justification is, substantially, that
the muiiieipal law of a nution, and "the do
mestic interpretations of that law, are the
measure of its duty as a neutral; and I feel
bound to declare mv opinion belore the
world, that that justification cannot be sus
tained before tho tribunal of -nationals. At
the siimc time I do not advise to any present
attempt at redress by acts of legislation. Fcr
the future, friendship between the two coun
tries must rest on the basis of mutual justice.
From the moment of the cstalishine lit of
our free Constitution, tho civilized world
has been convulsed by revolutions in the
interests of democracy or of monarchy; but
through ull those revolutions the United
States have wisely and firmly refused to be
come propagandists of republicanism,. It is
tho only government suited to our condition;
but we have never sought to impose it on
other; aud we have consistently followed the
advice of Washington to recommend it ouly
by the careful preservation and prudent use
of the blessing. 'Dining all the intervening
period the policy of Eurcpean powers and
and of the United States has, on the whole,
been harmonious. Twice, Indeed, rumors
of the invasion of some parts of America, in
tho interest of monarchy, have prevailed;
twice my predecessors have hud occasion to
announce the views of this nation in respect
to such interference.
On both occasions Ihe remonstrance of tho United
Stntos was respected, from a deep conviction, on
the part of European governments, that the system
of non-interference and mutual abstinence from
piopaguudism was the true rule for the two hemis
pheres. .Sinco those times wo have advanced in
wealth and power; but we retain the same purpose
to leave tho nations of Europe to choose their own
dynasties and form their own systems of govern
ment. This consistent moderation may justly de
mand a corresponding moderation. a should re
gard it as a great calamity to ourselves, to the cause
of gool gorernment. and to tbo peace of tho world,
should any Eurcpean power challenge the Amer
ican people, us it were, to tho defense of repub
licanism uguinst fuieigu interference.
Wo cannot foraeu and nro willing to consider
what opportunities niijjlit present themselves, what
combinations might olTcr to protect ourselves against
designs inimical lo our form of government. Tbo
V nileJ Suites ucsire lo act in the future as they havo
ever acted heretofore; they will never ho driven
from that course but by tho agression of European
Powers; and we rely on the wisdom and justice of
those Powers to respect the system of non-inter-ferencu
which bus so long been sanctioned by lime,
and which, by its guod rusulUP, has upproved iLscjlf to
both continents.

The business of .his city is not iu as pro9
pcroii9 a condition as appearances indicato
Merchants and traders arc not easy in tho
position they occupy. They feel that high
prices cannot be maintained for an unlimited
time, and that when the fall commences
many must suffer and go under. That crisis,
I think, is now at hand. Gold is coming
down and will continue to decline, gradual
ly, until tho difference between gold and
currency will bo almost nominal. Tho de
cline in cotton goods nro not so great in

necessnries of life arc also getting cheaper
Indeed provisions are cheaper in Philadel
phia than Sunbury. I saw line turkies, dry
picked, sold at 10 cents per pound, chick"
ens at 13 cents, and dressed hogs at 12J to
liH. ' Fine peach-blow potatoes at 70 to 73
cents per bushel. A large packer of pork
from the West, says that dressed hogs nre
worth but 9 cen nnd they arc not anxious
to buy at that price.
The lecommendntions of the Secretary of
tho Treasury to contract the Bank issues
and ro duce the currency to its former limit,
nearly so, meets with much opposition.
There is one thing certain, that the contrac
tion from 700 millions to 200 millions,
of dollars or even 400 millions, cannot be
accomplished without a great revulsion in
the money markec.
The citizens of Philadelphia are consider

wisdom by the President in his message to

gives to tho intemperate haste of thoso who

The last number of the London Sjxrtiitor
remarks as follows, in a long review of
President Lincoln's life and services:
"To our minds no funeral oration ever ex
ceeded in pathos that spoken ty the Presi
dent, in dedicating as a natiouul cemetery
part of the battle-field of Uettvbburg. Nor
can the message in which. bcorc the issue
of tbe emuuc'atioii prociaiuutioii, he en
tered the border Slutus to bacritice slavery,
not at tiieir own expense, but at the expense
of die nation, lie cusily surpassed in the
depth and earnestness of its entreaty."
And, again, spcuking of his religious char
acter, it says:
"Perhaps Mr. Lincoln's religious fuith and
simplicity are the only traits which still re
main unappreciated by the American people
at large. For ourselves we Cannot read his
last inaugural address, delivered ouly live
weeks before his assassination, without a
renewed conviction tliut it is the noblest
political document known to history, and
should have for the nation and the states
men hu left behind him something of a sa
cred and almost prophetic authority. Surety
none was ever written under a stronger sense
of the reality of Gud's government, and cer
tainly none written in a period of passionate
contlict ever so - completely excluded the
partiality of victorious faction, and bieathed
so pure a strain of uiiugled mercy and jus-
Tiie Way to do it. Dr. Ch&mbers, of
Kingston, N. V.,.was beset by two high
wiyinan in a lonely part of the road a few
lights since, and his nionev demanded. The
dmtorsaid: "Well, if I must give up my
moiey, I had better do it." So ho quietly
tool off his glove, and putting his hand
into his pocket, he drew out not his
pocket book but a ncut revolver, and
bringing it to beur in an instunt, he shot
ore sf, the robbers dead. - The other ruffian
tired at the doctor, but the ball went harm
lessly through his hat. The doctor then
took sis turn again and wounded the fel
low severely, lie then rode back to King
ston aid mude knnwu thiM'ncts, but on re
turning, the wounded man had escaped.
The friends of Jeff. Davis aro complain
ing aboit his "annoyances." It seems that
he has bad bis hair cut twice since bis
imprisonment, and they report through
