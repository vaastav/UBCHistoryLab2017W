The uaual fn.nk.ieee of President
Roosevelt characterizes his message
to congress, a synopsis of whloh Isi
published In this issus. He deals
with s number of questions from fa Is
view of them rather than from a party
standpoint. Roosevelt Is radical In
many things and there are a number
iss.™ r 5 ::r«r ,ou r n *?
Sri^dt^eTtiXne^.
Whloh are evident In many oases.
He delights in doing the odd things
which his predecessors failed to do.
For Instance, be disappointed oon
grass by withholding his meaagge un
til the second day of the session.
There was no reassn for thia aaide from
the tact that it attracted attention
mu* i „
and that pleased Roosevelt. But with
all his pw ul lor It lee the president is
independent and doee what he believes

[Copyright, 19m;, by Eugeno Purcells.;
There was never a wore absolute
monarch, no matter what his colo*,
than King Mateo, who reltftittl over three
*f the New Guinea Islands thirty years
ago.
Mateo's father had made the mistake
of murdering the crew of a trading
vessel, nnd when word had been pass
ed around the white men would trade
with him no more. The son sent word
far and wide that all traders should be
safe with Inm, and In time many ves
sels called at his Islands. He had
<'nneu at nis islands. He had
an( , oll nnd other thln „ t0
but be wanted guns and ammunition
In exchange.

riors and build forts for him. Hs even

For five years King Mateo encour
aged traders and whalers and got
reedy for a grand coup, and then he
struck a blow that made his name In
famous In every eastern sea. In his
principal harbor were lying two Eng
lish whalers and live trading vessels
when he gave a grand feast. It was
his wish that the crews of all the ves
wisn mm ins crews or all the ves
M | a be preeent, and only two or three
men were left aboard when the feast
began. B.v drugging the liquor and
f®°d Mateo made almut a hundred men
helpless, and when they bad their
again It was to find all their

neen robber and strip|ie<l they were
towed to sea and scuttled. By this
stroke the king secured many more
firearms and barrels more of powder,
as well as other things to increase bis
wealth and arrogance.
Three months after the attack Cap
tain Williams of an Australian trade!
managed to escape to sea In a canoe,
"' ana "T T"™ 1 ? *° aoa a canoe '
miles away. It wng four months
. — __...
before a British war vessel started
from Singapore to convince King Ma
teo that there were other inouurclB on
the face of thla earth. During these
•even months Mateo had grown so ar
rogant that hs defied the world. Twen
ty-one of the white slaves had suc
cumbed to the climate and the hard
work and scanty food.
No mors traders had called In, and.
being angry at this, the king had det.
mined on a grand feast at which th.

to a feast. Ils Invitation was refused
thereupon ordered the craft out ol

The Brf «h captain had been lu

uot have ti wait long. In broad day

Mains Biff Gams Season.
The Maine big game season has open
ed. Commissioner Carieton says the
outlook promises to be rich In returns
for the sportsmen and the stats. From
reports brought to Bangor by hunters
and guides It would appear that deer
and moose are plentiful, aud aa more
hunters have declared their Intention
of Joining In the sport this year than
last It Is thought that the great record
of 1002 or even tnat of 1805 will b«
equaled.
The commissioner estimates the num
ber of deer killed In Maine during each
hunting season to be 25,000 and moose
000. Ha la of the opinion that the nat
ural increase Is uot sufficient to offset
this slaughter, other authorities placs
the number of deer killed at 1&0OO os
10,000 and moose at 800 .
