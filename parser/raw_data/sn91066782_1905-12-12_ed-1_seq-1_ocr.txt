FEAR FELT
FOR GUNBOAT
The Wasp Went Out Saturday
Night on Rescue Work
AND HAS NOT RETURNED
She Carried a Crew of Eighty Men and
Was Provisioned for Three Days
, Alarm Is Felt at New
port, R. I.
Newport, R. I., Dec. 12. The gunboat
Wasp, which started out Saturday night
to render asistanee to the brig Ilarry
Smith at the entrance to Vineyard sound,
, has not yet been heard from and much
anxiety is felt for her safety by officials
at the torpedo and training station.
At first it was thought she might have
been blown off the shore by the gale, but
5 the lack of news is causing apprehen
sion that she may have met with a
serious mishap.
The gunboat Wasp is the converted
yacht Columbia, which was purchased
by the government at the outbreak of
the Spanish war. She is a trifle larger
: than the Hist, but was comparatively
new w hen purchased by the government.
The Wasp carried a crew of eighty men,

ONE OR THE OTHER.
i Witte Says It Looks Like Revolution or
' Coercion.
Xondon, Dee. 12. The correspondent
of the Daily Telegraph at St. Petersburg
n a dispatch dated Dec. 10, eent by way
" Kj'dtkuhnen, East Prussia, sends an
interview with Count Witte, in which
the premier indicates that Russia is con
fronted with the alternative of a revolu
tion or violent coercion Though the
count lias not abandoned hope, he is not
sanguine, nd if forcible repression should
become necessary he will, according to
the , correspondent, resign his task to
other hands.
Questioned by the corcrsjtondent as
to the genesis of the revolutionary
movement, Premier Witt attributed its
rapid development to the great auton
omy of the universities and the high
schools, where the revolutionary forces,
hitherto doomed to secrecy, found asy
lum and sanctuary and absolute freedom
for discussion. Further, when this free
dom became license,- society still looked
on with stolid in li (Terence.
After reviewing the situation up to
the manifesto uT Oct. 30, Count Witte
said: '
"Cletyrty the vast changes which the
v, .fWHffesto heralded required time and pa
tience to carry out j but what happened
was utterly unexpected. Sections of
the community nay, whole classes
went to work systemmatically to anni
hilate their own means of livelihood and
to ruin themselves and the whole nation,
Social jmstinets seemed to have became
atrophied. Instead of uniting to pre
serve order, the people quarreled among
themselves and attacked the government.
"The only people who acted in their
own interests were the revolutionists.
They knew what they wanted. They
chose the most effective means to attain
it, and they are capable of adopting
those means even at the price of heavy
sacnlices.

who last week refused on the stand

stand today and gave the desired testi
mony. - He said Harriman called on the day
of the purchase and said he had de
voted much time to the Equitable and
Ryan should not have come into the
situation without consulting him. Har
riman demanded an equal voice in the
management and a half interest in the
stock. Harriman objected to the plan
for the trustees, but finaly consented if
Ryan would allow him to name two

and Mr. Westinghouso.

"that I would not be able to carry out
my plan, as he would use his whole
political influence against me."
"Did he mention the nature of the
influence?"
"No."
"The manner of the influence?"
"My understanding was that there
would be legislative action."
Ryan said he still refused to accede
to Harriman s demands.

tion in its hands. The investigation will

RESIGNATION ACCEPTED.
Graniteville Presbyterians Release Their
Pastor Because of Illness.
The resignation of the Rev. George
MeLennon, pastor of Graniteville Pres
byterian church was unanimously ac
cented at a congregational mectinz held
last evening. Mr., MeLennon s reason i
tor tendering Ins resignation was the
fact that he is in very poor health. Al
though the people of his congregation
think a great deal of Mr. MeLennon, who
has done such good service in the Gran
iteville church tor two years, they
thought best to accept his resignation
without delay, so that their pastor could
obtain a much needed rest, for his con
dition is such as to necessitate an im
mediate giving up of all work.
Mr. McLennon's wife died at Granite
ville last spring and he goes now to
Montreal to stay for a time with his
daughter, who is the wife of a promi
nent Presbyterian minister of that city.
Mr.. MeLennon has two sons who are
Presbyterian ministers, and one who is
a professor in Oberlin college. Each of
his two daughters is married to a Pres
byterian minister.". He will pass the win
ter with these sons and daughters.

But Cheerfully Paid His Fine When
Brought Into Court.
Montpelier, Dec. 12. A wooly, red
head stuck out of a place on Main
street last evening and from the aper
ture below came a resonant yawping
for his companion. The yawp was too
much of an effort and the owner of it
fell headlong into the street. Officer
Pattee happened along at that moment
and assisted the man to his feet, and
then started to take him to the jail.
Then the ''buddy" came to the rescue
and between the two of them the officer
had a hard time, losing both. The first
individual became a lurid streak down
State street, with the officer and a
big crowd in pursuit. The crowd was
after amusement, not the man. The
streak headed for the Central Vermont
station and boarded the train. Officer
Pattee. called on Odell Mason, who was
standing on the platform of the car to
stop the fugitive. Mason not only stop
ped him, but shoved him off the car,
and then landed on him full force. Thus
pinioned the man was eaptured and land
ed in jail.
In court this morning the sprinter
pleaded guilty to intoxication and was
called upon for $5 fine with recompense
for the effort to catch him. He de
clared he was Peter Grant of Barre,
but afterwards told that he was using
his mother's last name, before she was
married a second time. The other man
is still at large.
