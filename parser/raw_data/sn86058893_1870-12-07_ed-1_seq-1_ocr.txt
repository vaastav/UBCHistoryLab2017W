resident's Message, j
We rrlnt tte message in full this j
morning, on the seccni page. As it '
13 quite short, when comrarcd with j
most of its predecessors, we presume ;
everybody Trill carefully read it for j
themselves, and make up their own
oriaiona as to its merits cr demerits.
The views of tha President upon the j
different questions to which he calls
the attention of Congress are easily
understood, lie has not learned the
art of rasing lacgusgo to conceal
ideas. What he thinks he declares in
plain English, and the common peo
ple can as clearly comprehend him as
can statesmen acd diplomatists.
Whether his opinions be right or
. wronjr, is open to discussion. But
there can be no discussion as to what
these opinions arc.
The President urge?, with great
pertinacity, the annexation of the
Island of b'in Domingo, and devotes
considerable of his menage to the dis
cussion of that question. We are of
the opinion that the reoplc are tired
of the Government speculations in
Real Estate, and have as little anxiety
to own the tornados and earthquakes
of Fan Domingo, as they had to pur
chase the icy mountains and valleys
and half-starved Indians of Russian
Ameno. The people are net hanker
ing after any more States or Islands.
The President thinks, of course,
that Congress should legislate to re
store specie payments, as everybody
else does. We apprehecd, however,
that the kind cf legislation most
needed is that which will most rabidly
devtlop the resources of the ooun
try, and keep down the expenditures
of the Government to the lowest pos
sible limit. Gen. Grant has already
done well in this particular, but there
is still room for improvement in some
of the Departments.
What will.no doubt, treatly con
found the reformers and new party
men, the President comes out cqnare
ly in favor of reform in the Civil Ser
vice, so as to provide for both ap
pointment and tenure, and relieve
Cocsressmen from the thankless and
disagreeable labor of proeuriog ap
pointments. As stated by a eotemporary, the
message runs largely to details taken
from the department reports, and
shows a desire to make a full present
ation of the business of the country.
Its greatest argumentative force is
devoted to iSa Domicgo. It con
cludes with a general stitement of the
,, policy of the administration, which is
everything that can be wished. In
this his statement of the rule that the
tariff taxation should hi reduced in
uehawayas to give relief to the
greatest cumber is the very principle
of tariff reform.
We have not undertaken to eurc
niariz J all the topics treated in the
message. It will be tiicersaty for
every one to read it io order to appre"
elate it.

Several bills were introduced, when
the Senate adjourned in order to com
plete the informal Revision of Stand
in? Committees.
Senate bills were introduoed as fol
lows: Mr. Harlan, to authorize the
election of a delegate to Congress
from Indian Territory,- Mr. Scott, to
repeal so much of the act of July 14,
lb.O, as continues the income tax af
ter December Lllst, ISC'J; Mr. Fen

eral to use in the postal service a pat

Btamps. : ,
-A resolution was offered by Mr.
Sherman, and adopted, calling upon
the Secretary of the Treasury for
copies of the regulations prescribed
by him for the transportation of
goods in bond from foreign countries
through the United States to Canada.
An order was informally issued for
the complete revision of the standing
committees. The Senate at 12: 35 ad
journed. .,.. - ".. .
HOUSE... ..WASUtNf;TON, Cecil. .
The bill rassed by the Senate at the
last session, extending the time for
the construction of the Railroad from
the St; Croix lUver to the west end of
Lake Superior, and to Bayfield, came
up as the regular order of business in
the morniog hour. It extends tha
term of the jrrant for seven years,
from the first of May, ISG'J, provided
that thirty miles be completed within
eighteen months, and thirty miles
every year thereafter. The bill was
explained and advocated by Wilson,
of Minnesota.
The bill was further explained and
advocated by Mr. Washburne, of
Illinois, who stated in reply to the
questions of Mr. Walker, that Iho
length of the road wis originally 350
miles; nearly 2110 miles being com
pleted and in running order, and the j
remainder was under contract, and
the quantity of land required would
le about 1,000,000 acres.
3Ir. Wood opposed tho biiL, declar-1
ing that it would be but a continna-
lion of the swindling system by which j
tbe public lands had been given away
to private corporations.
Mr. Julian desired to have the bill
amended so as to. exclude timbered
land from the grant.
a Mr, Lawrence desired to have the
coal lands excluded, and require the
liailroad Company to sell the land to
actual settlers on!y, and in qiantities
not exceeding a quarter section, and
not exceedicg ?2 50 an acre.
Mr. Wilson argued that it wes now
admitted that publio lands should g)
to actual settlers; Congress should
adopt that polity which would . prove
most advantageous to settlers, and
that was the openiog up of commu
nications by railro-.d.-i. After further
diacussioc, the bill was laid on the
table. '
Messrs.. Frank Morri.-", of Lou
isiana; Charles II. llolnita. of New
York, and Wm. 1 Wolf, of Iowa,
members elected to fill vacancies, pre
sented themselves and took the oath.
A resolution for a new drawing of
eats, ottered by Miles, was tabled by
a vote of !)2 to S3 ' - -.
The following bills were in
troduced and referred; Mr. Jones, of
Kentucky, for creating United States
Court ll)om8. Il venue offices and
l'ostoflioe at Covington, Kentucky;
Mr. Sargent, making an appropriation
for a government building at San
Francisco; Mr. Logan asked leave to
Introduce aod put upon passage a bill
abolishing the t fficcs of Admiral and
Vice Admiral lroa the Navy, the
former at once and tbe latter when a
vaeanoy occurs. Mc flala objected,
and Mr. Logan thereupon gave notice
to he would ' move, on Wednesday
next, to u-jead the rules and pass
the bill.
Hill introduoed a bill tu repeal tbe
Income Tax, which was referred to
the Committee on Ways and Means.
Similar bills were introduced . by

Letter from Minister Washburn on
the Provisions tn Paris Butler of
Tennessee Tne Illinois Senator
ship Sumner Amendment to the
rnndlns Law Losait on Reduction
or the JiaTy.
Washington, December 6 Repre
sentative Washburn, of Wisconsin,
has received a letter from his brother,
our Minister to France, in which he
says that the people of Paris have
provisions enough to hold out until
the first of January.
Kepresentative Roderick 11. Butler,
of Tennessee, is here, but did not an
swer to his name yesterday. His
friends say he will appear in the
House to-day and make personal ex
planation, during which he will refer
to the damaging charges which havo
been made against him in connection
with the pension frauds, and demand
an investigation by Congress into the
whole subject.
Tbe election of General Logan to
the United States Senate from Illi
nois, in place of Yates, is regarded as
certain. Of the 125 Republican mem
bers of the Illinois Legislature, SO
are claimed by Logan's friends as
pledged to him. The remainder are
divided between Gov. Palmer, Gen.
Ojjlesby and Gen. Koerner.
Senator Sumner states that the ob
ject of his bill introduced jesterdny.
but upon which he could not obtain
an action, is to stop the running of the
presses in the Treasury Department
and prevent the future printing of
United States currency in the place
of worn-out notes. He believes this
course will gradually contract the cur
rency and bring about specie pay
ments. The bill provides for amend
ing the funding law increasing the
five per rent, bonds from $200,000,000
to 500,000,OCO. The Senator doea
not believe that bonds bearing a
lower rate of interest can be negoti
ated under the present condition of
finances.
- General Logan will introduce, as
soon as possible, a resolution abolish
ing the office of Admiral in the navy
at once, and the office of Vice Ad
miral as soon as a vacancy occurs.
This will relieve the navy to an equal
ity of rank with the army grades ef
General and Lieut. General, which
are, by virtue ot the army reduction
aet of last session, to be discontinued
as soon as vacancies occur.
Logan intends to press this measure
before any confirmation is made by
the Senate of an appointment to fill
the vacancies occasioned by the death
of Admiral Farragut.

Washington. Deo. C. Viscount
Treilhard to-day. in accordance with
previous arrangement, called at the
Executive Mansion and presented his
credentials. . which were acepted by
the President. ,
The R?publicin Caucus of the Sen
ate held a brief se-sion this morning.
at which a committeo was appointed
to nominate members for the various
standing committees of the Senate.
In response to a letter from Chas.
Roome, President of the Manhattan
Gaslight Company of New xork, an
nouncing his appeal from the assess
ment of $2,653,873 for gas sold dar
ing the month of October last, upon
the ground that the aot of 1870 repeal
led all laws imposing taxes on sales,
repeals the tax on gas. Acting Com
mUs oner Douglass says the liability!
of the Manhattan Gaslight Company,
in common with all Gas Companies in
the country, to be assessed and pay
taxes on all gas manufactured, con
sumed or sold by them, ia too plain to
admit of any question; but if the
Manhattan Gislight Company is of a
different opinion, and such is the de
cision of the Court, the Internal Rev
enue Office will oppose no obstacla,
except to make such a defense before
the Court as may be necessary to pro
tect the interests of the Government
in the eolleotion of the taxes which
L'ocgr(S has imposed.
In a private letter to a friend here,
Minister Motley writes that he has
received on autograph letter from the
Queen of Holland, tendering him the
tree use of her elegant mansion at
Hague, to enable him to complete the
history of, the Netherlands. This of
fer Motley has accepted, and will pro
ceed to Hague to commence his lite
rary labors aa soon as he reoeives in
struotioos to turn over bis office to
the first Secretary of Legation.
Comments of the Press on the Presi
dent's Message.
Nkw York. December G. Al' the
Metropolitan jiurnals have elaborate
comments upon the President's mesage
and accompanying State documents
this morniog. The Tribune thinks
that the prominent feature of his ad
ministration had already commanded
popular approbation, but this mes
sage will still more endear the l'resi
dent to the hearts of his countrymen.
The writer thinks that in regard to
San Domingo the President is clearly
right in his position, if not misin.
formed as to material facts, aod sub
mits that Congress will be constrained
by public pentiment to admit San
UouaiDgo into our Union, unless it
can be made to appear that her peor
pie are preponderantly averse to such
a union. tte tbiuks tbe President a
patience is almost exhausted by the
Cuban outrages, but regrets the si
lence in the message as regards the
Alabama ' claims, and esteems the
President's suggestions and recom
mendtioa with regard to the publio
land and land grants, as wise and
timely.
The Herald thinks tue President's
Messass is a good State naner and a
staunch party platform, and that as
an exhibit ot the management under
his supervision of the Government in
our foreign and domestic affairs, that
there is much in it tb&t is good and
encouraging, and as tne torcsbadow
ing of the general policy of his admin
istration, and that there is nothing io
it calculated to disturb tbe general
confidence of the country.
The limes says tbe message is tbe
best answer to those who insist that
the mission of the Republican party
is ended, or impugn General Grant's
ntness for interpreting tbe wishes
and promoting the interests of the
people, and that tho policy set forth is
at once positive and practical. The
writer thinks it is clear that the
President has no idea of plunging the
nation recklessly into war, tH a means
of manufacturing capital; yet there is
nevertheless, a rather striking sug-
gestiveness in a brief paragraph
which he devoted to the Alabama
claims, and the mildness of the Pres
ident in reference to that question
renders more significant the firmness
of his remarks in regard to the fish
cries. The World severely criticises the
message, and thinks it is a document
which needs a cool deal of jinnow
inz to separate the small amount of
grain from the heavy chaff in which
it is buried. The writer saya that the
request of the President for authority
to appoint a oommission to investigate
and audit the damages of individuals
by the Alabama depredations, with a
view to their payment by our own
Government, is a proceeding entirely
without preoedent, and that if his a 1
vioe is accepted, a preoedent will be
set for making the Government re
sponsible for the reparation of dam
ages Bustaiood by our merchantmen at
the hands of foreign powers as inci
dent to wars. ' "
ibe bun can nod uttie merit or
satisfaction in the message, and terms
it "a poverty stricken document. '

cers believe the siege may still ex
tend beyond .Christmas, on militarv
grounds, but they hope the French
are discouraged by tho failures of the
recent sorties, especially by the final
recapture of Champigny, yesterday.

Canadian Press on the
Fnsli
dent s Mef sage.
' Toronto, December G. The pa
pers this morning, commenting cn the
President's raessege, Eay, with refer -
ence to the enloreement of Canadian
rights in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
that the President does not found his
objections against tbe action of our
government upon the seizure of ves-
eels actually engaged in fishing within
fnrhiddfin boundaries, but on trip (jpi7-
re ana examination ot vessels sus
pected of a design to violate the reg
ulations of the Canadian Government.
He states that, while the Canadian
act permits such seizures and examin-
ations, the law has not yet been put !
in farce, and is resolved to '.
postpone action until actual of
fense has been given, . whether such :
seizure and examination form a nee'es- I
sary part of the police duty of our !
navy aa a question tor the Govern
ment to consider.
We need hardly
if these proceed -
say, however, that if these proceed
ings are necessary to driving out in
truders from cur waters, the lajv
ought to be enforced, whatever ob
jection may be made by the American
Government, or threats of retaliation
which the President holds cut. Ca
nadian vessels will bo refused admis
sion to American ports, and
if tho bonded system, as it is
called, under which Canadian
merchandise passes through the Uni
ted States, be suspended, it will not
have the slightest effect in preventing
the assertion ot the just rights of
Canada in the waters of the Gulf.
That a number of Cacadian vessels
are entering American ports is quite
insignificant. Tha stoppage of the
bonding system might cause some in
convenience to individuals in Canada,
but it would enormously benefit other
parties, and the chief injury would
fall npon American transportation
lines. President Grant may try meas
ures of coercion whenever he likes.
It will not cause the people ot Canada
to abate their claims one jot or tithe.
The President asserts the right of the
United States to the free navigation of
the St. Lawrence. - It is hardly worth
while to dispute this claim. Whatev
er rights the American people may
possess to the navifation of the river,
they oertainly have none to the canal
along the banks. Whenever the re
quest has been made to permit the
passage of American vessels down the
river, it has always been granted, and
the question will hardly allege, there
fore, that the right of the States on
the lakes, which he makes so much
of, have been seriously injured by the
denial of his claim, as in coming up
the river, we beg to inform his Excel
lency, that the trouble arises. Per
haps he has never made a trip from
Kingston to Montreal. We assure
him, that without the use of our ca
nals, Americans would obtain won
derfully little advantage from the
free navigation of the St. Lawrence.
South America the War la Uruguay.
Montevideo, Nov. G. Gaucho,
leader of the Aparicio, ha out
generaled both Suarez and Carabello,
defeating them in detail at Casavalle
and Corvalito, having at the latter
place compelled Carabello to treat for
a capitulation. After agreeing to an
armistice, Blanco's forces retired a
mile. The Colorado Chief stole away
under the cover of darkneis, forfeit
ing his word of honor to pay land or
city bordering on the Uragmy lliver,
losing al) his trains and artillery, and
by demoralization, one-half of his re
maining force. Suarez pus had for
ward with all Lis available force, to
support Paysander and Apariuio, and
with his colleagues, maneuvered sj
adroitly that Colorado's forces were
left unmolested. Blanco's army,
numbering 7,000 men of all arms,
then marched 200 miles aq i made
their appearanoe at the town of
Launeon, three miles from this city,
very unexpectedly on the 24:h ult , to
lay siege to the Capital, left by their
combinations, isolated aod unsup
ported by Colorado's armies outside.
This city is now defended by 3,f(K)
men, who are armed with needle
guns, Spencer and Hemington rifles.
Constant pioket firing is kept up on
both aidea, and quite a number are
killed and wounded daily.
The loan of $2,500,000, contracted
with the house of Lauoa & Co , o!
Buenos Ayres, by the Battle Admin
istration, is likely to prove fallacious.
Tbe Btaoeo party have protested and
notified the bankers that, iu the
event of their coming into power,
they will not recognize the loan.
The effeots of the siege is being felt
in tha enhanced prices of all articles
of daily consumptioa. Meat which
sold for six cents per pound last
month, now sells at one dollar and a
half; milk formerly costing four cents
is now worth fifty 02vt per quart.
Advices fiomNew Voik of October
ll.h, quoting Buenos Ayres and Mon
tevidso hides at 24 cents, caused an
advance in prices here and ciused in
creased activity iu the shipments to
New York, whioh are now unusually
large. There are now purchased and
afloat at this port and liuenos Ayr. s.
over 3jQ,Q0Q hides. Oa accouitnf
these heavy purchases, orioes will
probably decline in New York in Jan
uary net,
Binoe the fearful riot. Asunoion has
been quiet. The Provisional Gov
ernment, aided by the Chamber of
Deputies, is hastening in the fram
ing a new national charter, aad the
election, of a new government for
these people.
The Assembly passed, after consid
erable debate, a bill granting reli
gious freedom, but it excites hostility
throughout the country, and the wo
men of Paraguay have been chosen
to petition for the repeal of the law;
henoe, lively times are anticipated.
Tbe country is fast settling into order
and comparative prosperity.
' Fortunateo Flores, the instigator of
the late riot, has gone to Europe.
Miners' Strlte.
Scbanton, Pa., December G. The
miners in the districts operated by
the Delaware.Lackawaona & Western
Ballroad Company to day resolved, by
a vote of l.OoO to 400, to f-uspend work.
The company reduced tbe wages of
the miners forty-five cents a car.
Upon this reduction the suspension is
based.
All the men at Delaware, in the
Hudson Canal Company's works are
also out, but apparently not upon def
inite action taken by them as in the
case of the Delaware, Lackawanna Si
Western Company's men. The sup
ply of coal in stock by the three
great companies is probably sufficient
to meet all the demands of the mar
ket for some months.
Ballroad rinl-hed.
Ft. ScOTr, Ks . December G. The
Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ittilroad
was completed to this city yesterday,
and trains will run regular between
Ft. Scott and Scdalia on and after to
morrow. The opening of this im
portant outlet, it is believed, will
change the trade of Southern Kansas
and Indian Territory, and make Ft.
Scott the chief distributing depot for
the Southwest.
The Texan drovers have made a
general stampede from Baxter Springs,
and are now driving cattle by the va
rious routes northwestwardly through
Kansas and Missouri.
The flow of Immigration continues
witbout apparent abatement.
