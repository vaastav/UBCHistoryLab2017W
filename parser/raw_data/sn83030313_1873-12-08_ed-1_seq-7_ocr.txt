initiation of our present difficulty with Spatn
does not cut the Gordian knot in a much
more decisive manner. But this Republic
has a deep interest in the late of Cuba, and
both policy and humanity call upon the gov
ernment for some action. The hour soems to
have struck when the freedom ot Cuba may
be assured, when that bouutilul and
rich island may bo made prosperous
aud happy and of immense value
to the commerce of the United States, instead
of being nndor the most blighting and cruel
despotism and the stronghold of slavery.
With the concession of belligerent rights the
Cubans themsolves, General Quesada says, can
conquer their independence. This appeal,
then, should be considered in a spirit ot jus
tice and humanity, if the present difficulty
with Spain about the Virginius should ter
minate peacefully.

Washington. Dec. 7, 1873.
Senator Sumner, though excluded from his
former prominence in the diplomatic affairs of the
Senate, has not tailed to watch, with great Inter
est and concern, the negotiation* pending be
tween the United States and Spain on the question
ol the seizure of the Virginias.
THE SENATOR SUBPBISF.D.
The Senator in conversation expressed himself
as considerably surprised at tho course pursued by
our government, and if tho matter comes before
the Senate he will take occasion to express his
views, lie has received through various sources
of iniorniatlon, official and personal, a very cor
rect estimate ol every step in the negotiation. He
lias not only been advised through home sources,
but has received telegrams from abroad. From
this comprehensive position he has been able to
judge the matter critically.
THE GOVERNMENT IN A FIX.
He says that our government lias managed to
work Itself into a tight place, through indiscretion
and general lack of d ploraatlc skill, and if It gets
out of the complications with honor lie will be very
much surprised. It is an easy matter to
talk about national dignity and honor, out It
is quite another thing to comprehend their
meaning. The government has undertaken a snap
judgment in the Virginias affair, and lias set out
in a hasty pursuit of national honor without know
ing what they were driving at.
BLAMES THE MASSACRE.
The Inhumanity committed In the summary exe
cution of the officers anil part of the crew
of the Virginias was, he thought., without
excuse 5 but It was not at all clear
that the Vlrginius was engaged in legitimate trade,
and Spain should nave been allowed to vindicate
tho conduct of her officers, who were acting In
obedience to general Instructions from their rulers,
belore our government jumped Into summary and
unconsidered demands for reparation.
DOUBTFUL CHARACTER OF THE VIROINIUS.
It might ne that the Vlrginius was not a pirate, as
adjudged by the Spanish tribunals belore which
she was taken, in which event Spain could be held
severely responsible for the assault upon a vessel
on the high seas and under the American flag; but
if the Vlrginius was adjudged by the Spanish
courts, and was so proven satisfactorily to our own
government, then there Is no lusult to the flag, and
hence no dishonor.
This is the awkward position of the United
States.
WAR NOT TO BE LIGHTLY UNDERTAKEN.
Acting in a grave niulter of international har
mony without first examining the case, in such a
calamitous process of settling misunderstandings
as war, he thought it the highest duly of a nation
to be sure It was right. Hut the couutry had been
brought to the verge of hostilities, and the danger
has not yet entirely subsided, without an exami
nation of the status of the vessel.
SPECIAL PLEADING.
The English flag did not protect blockade run
ners captured on our coasts during the rebellion,
nor would the American flag be dishonored in a
manner lor our consideration by being captured
on a vessel which migut have placed herself be
yond the pale of national protection.
, ARBITRATION GLORIFIED.
The Senator remarked that the enlightenment
of the age was such that there were lew interna
tional questions which, dispassionately considered,
could not be adjusted by arbitration. In his
speech on the Alabama depredations, he remarked,
he pointed out the way to solve the Intricate prob
lem pending between the United states and Great
Britain, and tne government succeeded In bring
ing to a gratifying termination the question which
aroused the most acrimonious feeling on the part
of both peoples against each other and in cement
ing a closer relation than ever before existed be
tween the two great Anglo-Saxon nations of the
globe, ne believed tho preludices or the past be
tween Americans and English had permanently
laded out of sight. He had opinions on the Span
ish question which he would express on the proper
occasion.
THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT HASTY.
What the Senator exactly had In bis mind when
he stated that he would be surprised If our govern- j
mcnt came out of this trouble with honor was
not stated, but it was inferred that the demand lor j
the Immediate surrender of the vessel, without an i
examination, might, upon luture investigation or 1
her history, demonstrate that she had violated the j
sacred character of the American flag and the ;
amicable relations existing between the two
countries, in which event Spain would be j
justified in adopting our own course as car
ried out in tho AlaDama case and com- j
pel us to mako an apology, and at the
same time pay heavy damages for permitting
American vessels to land munitions of war for
hostile purposes on the soil of a friendly nation.
These views of the Senator have additional in
terest from the fact that the same subject Is now
being agitated In Spain. The executions, though
in accord with the peculiar laws of the country,
would come lu as part oi the question ol the seizure
or the vessel.
DIPLOMATIC LECTT RE.
The Senator's speech will doubtless be a spirited
lesson on diplomacy, and will create a great sen
sation in the diplomatic world on both sides of tho
Atlantic. '

Senator Morton, In conversation to-night,
stated that tho Spanish complications pre
sent a more favorable aspect than at
any time since the capture of the Virginias.
Our government, lie says, is disposed to act
with leniency towards fpain. and has taken into
consideration embarrassing circumstances which
surround the Castclar government both at homo
and In Cuba. There was no fixed limit to the time
for tho restitution of the Virginlus, but a reasonable
period was allowed, and tho government, in
connection with the .Spanish representative,
will determine that matter when it Is found
that the time Is assuming an undue length. The
papers relating to this whole question will be sub
muted to the Senate at the tunc that action is re
quired, should more decisive measures be neces
sitated, or for the sanction of that body of what
had been done.

"Why, gentlemen, if I had the running of this
cussod thing I would take the navy of these

marines and I would moor that navy in front of
that desecrated and doomed city of Santeeaggo de
Coobah; and, after I had moored the navy in front
ol Santeeaggo de Coonah, as I said before, I wouid
give them 21 hours to get their women and children
out of the way, and then I would batter the
damned town to the level of the ground at once,
sir?at once! 1 would then, gentlemen, inoor that
navy successfully In front of every town tnat held

A FISH STORY.
The Ureat Sea Serpent in Belhaven Bay.
|From Liverpool Mercury, Oct. 21.]
A correspondent in the Dunbar district writes
"Almost with prophetic Inspiration the Scotsman
ot Tuesday announced that the great sea serpent
would soon be seen at the month of the frith. The
prediction has already been verified, and that in a
way which can admit of no doubt whatever,
unless in the minds of the most sceptical. At
halt-past one o'clock on Tuesday aiternoon it
was announced in breathless haste to the writer
that a long and largo black animal was
tuinbiiug about in Belnaven Hay, to the intense
excitement and surprise ol about 120 individuals
who had collected together and were witnessing its
gambols. On hurrying to the coigu ol vantage
with a good binocular to get a sight of the object,
there was no doubt whatever of the truth 01 the
statement. Near trie middle of Helhaven Bay, and
ubout u quarter of a nnle from the place where we
were standing, there certainly appeared 'along
and large black animal' in the water, having
all the appearance of the saurian described by
Dr. .loass. YVhcu first Observed it was proceeding
shorewards, with what seemed to be its head and
various undulated portions of the body above
the surface. Alter g* ttlng near the shore it turned
to the westward, and kept moving ubout in that
position for a considerable time. Sometimes it
appeared to stretch itseli out to its full length, at
which tinios both its head aud tail were seen abovo
water, only a small porilou of the middle of ttie
creature being submerged. Most frequently, how
ever, it was the undulations or apparent coils of
the body that were observed, two or three ol them
being occasioually visible at the same time. These
eoils had all the appearance to the observci'9 at the
distance mentioned above of the coils orioldsota
serpent, the sea and the black masses being dis
tinctly separated. Occasionally the creature
seemed to take a header, and disappeared alto
gether, but It seldom remained longer than two or
three minutes beneath the surface without expos
ing some part or other of Its body. When lully
stretched out, us it appeared to be several times
during the period ol observation, it seemed to
be upwards of a hundred feet tu length, with an
apparent breadth ot troui two to three ieet. No
doubt the dimensions must have been very much
larger. As it was in sight tor upwards of a quar
ter oi an hour ample opportunity was afforded for
watching its movemeuts. The sea was also as
smooth as the surface 01 a mirror, which contrib
uted very much to a-sist the observations made oy
the onlookers. Alter disporting near the shore for
the time specified, the long and lithe creature
turned its head to the north aud stood out to sea.
Altogether, if the animal was not the groat plesio
saurus seen by Dr. Juass, lie was evidently a uear
relative of the same family, and his visit to Hel
haven Bay has furnished loud for reflection to
those who witnessed his gambols mr wauy a
day.''

Paris, Nov. 17, IH73.
Since the Count of Chambord launched his no
surrenner manifesto French political parties have
had to take what Americans call '-new de
partures." The royalists, unahle to restore the
King of their choice and unable to prevail oil the
Count or Paris to accept a Lieutenant Generalship
of the kingdom, have, fur the most part, rallied to
the idea of a conservative republic, which means,
in thoir eyes, a republic which shall have nothing
of republicanism in It bat the name, and which
shall be upset at the first conventeut opportunity.
On the other hand, the republicans pure, em
boldened by the failure of the royalist Intrigues,
have taken their stand on a declaration that the
republic should be formally proclaimed as the defi
nite government of France, and that all partioa
conspiring to overthrow it In favor or a monarchi
cal pretender should be amenable to the penalties
or high treason. The Bonapartists, who are a small
body in the Assembly, but a very large faction out
of doors, at first stood aloof Irom the two other
parties, but since the opening of the session they
I nave made common cause with the republicans,
and It Is now certain that MM. Thiers, Gambetta
and Rouher have entered into a temporary league

Now there have been nine plebiscites held in
France since the great revolution. In two of these
the nation pronounced for republicanism, in the
other seven lor Bonapartism: aud in fact it would
be shorter to say that in every one of the nine
pUHiisrites an overwhelming majority of the people
answered "Yes" to the questions put to it by the
existing governments. Of course, MM. Thiers
aud Gambetta both feel confident that If the coun
try were appealed to at this crisis It would dcclaic
for republicanism, and the Bonapartists are
secretly of the same opinion. But the imperialists
have ever been an astute party and their plan ap
pears to be as follows:?Once they have fairly com
mitted the republicans to the idea of a plebiscite,
then they will break otT with them, adhere to
MacMahon, obtain two or three seats in the Cabi
net, aud bring on the plebiscite with their own
men in power to guide and manage it. To use a
legal term, this would completely change
the venue of the q uestlon. A plebis
cite taken by a republican government
would result In a republican vote, but a pllnscite,
organized with M. Rouher at tile Home Office and
a legion of imperialist prefects, mayors and minor
officials working to cozen the constituencies,
would be as assuredly favorable to the Bouapartes
as If a Napoleon were actually on the throne.
It may be asked how the republicans should be
so blind as not to see through this plotf But they
do see through it. MM. Thiers and Gambetta are
not dullards. They know very well that an alli
ance between republicans and Bonapartists can
never be sincere; bat tliey have great reliance on
their own strength, and hope to defeat the Bona
partlst machinations by rendering M. Uouhcr's,
and even MacMahon's, long tenure of office im
possible. In plain terms, having now a strong ma
jority of the nation at their backs, they count on
heading the poll at most elections, and, when they
have secured a working majority In the Legisla
ture, then they will lorce MacMahon either to ac
cept a liberal Cabinet or to resign. In either case
that is, whether there were a republican President
or simply a republican Cabinet?a plebiscituin
would be taken on the question.
KINO, EMPEROR OR REPnBLIC 1
And if the republican vote triumphed, as It cer
taluly would under these circumstances, royalist
or imperialist politicians would be compelled
thencofortn to abstain irom everything that re
sembled a conspiracy. Such are the republican
projects. They may succeed or they may be frus
trated by the superior craft of the Bonapartists,
but this one fact is at all events positive?namely,
that a plebiscUum in some shape or other will be
taken belore another year has passed. The thing
is inevitable. It has become the cry of two great
parties. It is a mode of settling matters which has
mauy attractions to the ordinary French mind;
I ror it is the highest acknowledgment or and the
best homage to popular sovereignty. Once lauuch
the idea of a plebiscitum amongst Frenchmen, and
the nation will have no rest until the plebiscitum
Is over.
prince napoleon and the prince iupert \l.
It is needless to remark that one of the chief
fomentors of the plebiscite scheme is Prince Napo
leon. When this pushing politician Issued his pro
gramme of a republlco-Bonapartlst alliance in
September last there were many cries of Indigna
tion from the prominent men of the two parties
whom it was proposed to weld together. But, as
the New YoRk IIkrald pointed out at the time,
these cries meant nothing. Prince Napoleon's
only mistake consisted in proclaiming aloud what
was being done in secret, for that imperialists and
republicans had already coalesced or would shortly
do so was a lact that no observer of things politi
cal could doubt. Since his letter Prince Napoleon
has been continually on the move between England
and France receiving Instructions from Otaisel
hurst and interviewing the leading statesmen of
his country.
Occasionally nis Imperial nighness seems to be
acting on his own Impulses and In opposition to
the 'interests of Napoleon Ill.'s heir; but these
appearances must never be taken au slrieax.
The Prince knows better than to dissociate his
fortunes from those ot the fatherless boy who may
some day be called Napoleon IV. Tnls lad is re
ported to be weak and delicate, and he Is the only
Bonaparte who stands between Prince Napoleon
and the headship of the Imperial dynasty. If ho
were to ascend the throne during his minority
Prince Napoleon wonUl be Regent; if he were to
die unmarried or cnildless Prince Napoleon would
pecome Napoleon V. Those are prospects lair
enough to keep King Jerome's son faithful, aud
throughout all the plebiscitary intrigues which are
about to convulse France we may expect to see
him bustle, plot and travel, veering now towards
one party, now towards another, according to the
hazards of tno hour, but bearing always in nnnd
that great idee Napollenne, which means that
the Bouapartes should oe masters of the trench
nation by fair means or loul.

THE VILLE DO HAVRE.
The Crew of the Colliding Ship Loch Eara
Landed in England.

and Men of the Steamship.
TELEGRAMS TO THE HEW YORK HERALD.
London, Dec. T, 1873.
The crew of the Loch Earn, which ran Into an#
sunk the Ville du Havre, have arrived ac Plym
outh.
They were brought into nort by the lint tan
Queen, which took thorn off the Loch Earn on t.b?
2'Jth ult,, at which time she wan in a linking condi
tion.
The account of the Ville du Havre disaster given
by the rescued crew reproaents that the Captain
and second mate of the steamer came on board
the Loch Earn shortly arter the collision and did
not assist in saving any of tue passengers, and
that the majority of the 1'reuch crow exhibited
lamentable cowardice.
Statement of the Captain of the Loch
Earn?Sighting the Steamship, tho
Steerage and Incident of Collision.
London, Dec. 7?Evening.
The Captain of the Loch Earn makes the follow
ing statement of the circumstances attending tha
collision with the steamer Ville du Havre
After first sighting the steamer and seeing that
she was coming dangerously near, the Captain of
tho Loch Earn rang the ship's belt and ported his
helm.
The holm of the steamer was put to the star
board, but thesteamor came right across tho Loch
Earn's bow.
The people in the first boat from the FrAich
steamer did not say she was sinkiug. but the Cap
tain of tho Loch Earn, observing that the steamer
was settling down, sent out his coats. Neither
the first French boat nor tho second oue,
which ariived shortly afterwards, bringing tho
first and second captains of the Vine da
IJavre, attempted to return, but, in spite ol
the expostulations ol alt tho erew who were left
on board the Loch Earn and the threats of hor
mates to fire upon them, remained alongside the
ship.
The clothing of the French officers who reached
the deck of the Loch Earn was dry, showing u?
signs of their having been in the water.
Finally some Englishmen seized and manned one
of the French boats and went to the rescue of
those straggling in the sea. Ouly one of tha
French boat's crew assisted in this rescue.
CAUSE OF THE GREAT LOSS OF LIFE.
The Captain of the Loch Earn considers that tha
great loss of life resulted from the fact that hla
vessel drifted such a long distance from tha
steamer after the collision before It was posslbia
to shorten sail, from the tardiness of the steamer
in showing signals of distress, and from the mis
conduct of lier crew.

lives on board the steamship Ville du Havre was
