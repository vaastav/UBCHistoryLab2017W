THE CHARLEI ft. VOOILEI 80.. Baltlmsr. Hi,
THE NORTHWEST
JThe Jacksonville (Fin.) Times Union,
commenting on a letter to the I'hilnrtelpliia
Htcord from V. F. Powell, Secrotury of the
New Jersey central coininitlee of colored Re
publicans, complaining of the treutment ac
corded by the Harrison administration to
negro voters, mnkea the following compari
son between the policy of the late ndminii-
t rat ion nnd the present policy:
President Cleveland appointed more col
ored men to office than 1 resident Harrison
has done, or will do. Of coarse, President
Cleveland's choice was limited to a narrow
Held, since he would nppolnt no colored man
who was not a Democrat. Republican prom
ises and Democratic performances can be
correctly estimated only on the basis ot the
colored Republican and the colored Demo
cratic voters, respectively. Of the 1,200,0CD
colored voters in the United States, l.lw.OOO,
are Republicans and 12,000 Democrats. Now,
for every fifty colored men appointed by
Cleveland, Harrison, to show an equal re
sard for the "man and brother." must ap
point 6,000 exactly. Bat notwithstanding
these restrictions Ulovelana appointed even
more than Harrison has appointed, and his
offices now are about all tilled. Moreover,
thb estimate, by numbers alone, omits any
consideration of availability. Taking into
account the fact that nine-tenths of the
northern oolored Republicans are educated,
and a rough calculation would show that
when it come to substantial favors Cleveland
had one thousand times more regard for the
oolored man than the Republicans have. This
is the testimony of colored men themselves,
and the facts amply sustain the conclusion.
The Pre a Generally , Denominate
Harrifun'a Message M "Cbeataut."
Chicago, Dec.. 4. The Herald, re
ferring In the president's message, says
euitnriaur:
"tree whisky and tobocco are to be
civen the people In lieu of free blank
eti, free lumber, free coal, free tools, free
carpels, free Rises and free household
furnishings. This is redemption of the
pledge by the mill owners' convention
of 1888, which nominated Harrison, and
who shameful enunciation of this Ira-
moral policy is even yet ignored by
many ltepuoncans who may read as
they run, but who, nevertheless, will
not believe."
globe.
The Globe savs: "Curiously enough
President Harrison follows almost ex
actly in the line of Cleveland's last mes
sage in declaring that 'the collection of
moneys not needed for public uses im
poses an unnecessary burden upon the
people.' The similarity ends with this
frank admission, and In the president's
recommendations there is neither reas
on nor statesmanship."
TIMES.
The Times says: "President Harrison
opens with a couple of columns descrlp.
tive of the status of our affairs with for.
eign lands, in all of which, since we are
at peace wun the world, there is little
orgenuine Interest. For the rest the
message, save as the Dresirient'a view

more to offer to congress In the way of In
formation ana augzesuan, and offered
it with a more vigorous individuality
of thonght and expression than the
present chier executive of the United
States can exhibit or command.
'Nobody would be gladder than The
Sun to discover in the President's first
important state paper the faintest sign
of intellectual promise, the least Indica
tion of a powder to rise altove the dead
ly dull line of mediocrity. Where Is
there such a sign? Take from the Pres
ident's message those parts which mere
ly repeat or paraphrase the Ideas and
recommendation! of his cabinet officers,
s.nd what remains?
"The rest is a scrap book of compara
tively unimportant facts. The wearied
eye passes from paragraph to paragraph
of geographical, historical, and statisti
cal statement and platitudinous com
ment, the message is amorphous.
Long as it is, it might have been twice
as long on the same principle of con
struction, and neither more nor less
valuable. Or the whole of it might
have been left unwritten without the
slightest detriment to the peace and
honor of the country or the prosperity
and security of the people, and without
the slightest loss on the Fifty-first con
gress, now assembled for the business
of legislation.
"Ine message Is a disclosure and
what It discloses is a President without
ideas and an administration without
policy."

Congressional Work.
1 lie Republican organs are mapping out a
tremendous program, which they threaten to
put through the coming Congress. One sug
gestion is that Congress shall re-apportion
all the States in which it is the Republican
interest to do so. The impudence of these
spoils-grabbers goes to the extent of talking
about Democratic gerrymanders. The only
State in the north that is not carved up to dis
franchise Democrats and return the greatest
number of Republicans is Indiana. Take
the north over nnd it requires about three
times as many Democratic voters to eleot a
Congressman as Republicans. In Ohio un
der the existing apportionment, which the
coming legislature will wipe out of the way,
it takes only 28,000 Republicans to elect
Congressman and 68,000 Democrats. The
fact is the Republicans hold their majorities
in both houses of Congress by disfranchising
ger r manders. It is a superlative degree of
cheek for them to complain of Democratic
gerrymanders at the south. They get all the
Congressmen from the south the banded ig
norance of their party in that section entitles
them to,
