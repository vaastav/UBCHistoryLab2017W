p stating- that he was elected Lieutenant-
Governor in IBT.J. and calling upon (he mili
tia of the State to arm, assemble and drive
from power the usurpers, as he designated
the officers of the State Government. On
the next day I issued my proclama
tion. commanded the insurgents to dis
perse within five days from the date
thereof, and subsequently learned that on
that day they had taken forcible possession
of the State House. Troops wore sent by me
to support the existing and recognized State
Government, Imt before the expiration of the
rive days the insurrectionary movement was
practically abando and, and the officers of the
State Government, with some minor excep
tions, resumed their powers and duties. Con
sidering that the present State administration
iif Louisiana had been the only government
in that Slate for nearly two years; that it hud
been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced in
ms -ucli by'Congress, and more than once ex
pressly recognized by me, 1 regarded it as my
clear duly, when legally called upon for that
purpose,'to prevent its overthrow by an armed
mob under pretense of fraud and irregularity
in the election of IS7;L I have heretofore culled
t) K . attention of Congress to this subject,
stating'hat on account of the frauds and
forgeries committed at said election, and
because it appeared that the returns thereof
were never legally canvassed, it was impossi
ble to tell thereby who were chosen, but
from the host sources of information at ray
command 1 have always believed the present
Stale olliaers received a majority of the legal
votes actually east at that election. I repeat
what 1 -aiid in my special message of Feb. lb,
1573, that in the event of no action hy Con
gress I must continue to recognize the gov
ernment heretofore recognized by me.
I regret to say tlml with the preparations
for the late election a decided indication ap
peared in home localities in the Southern
States of a determination, by acts of violence
and intimidation, to deprive citizens of the
freedom of the ballot because of their politi
cal opinions; bands of men masked and
armed made their appearance; White Leagues
and other societies were formed; large quan
tities of arms and ammunition were
imported and distributed to these or
ganizations; military drills, with menac
ing demonstrations, were held, and, with all
these, murders enougli were committed to
spread terror among those whose political
action was to be suppressed if possible by
these intolerant and criminal proceedings.
In some places colored laborers were com
pelled to vote according to the wishes of
their employers, under threats of a discharge
if they acted otherwise, and there arc
too many instances in which, when
these threats were disregarded, they
were remorselessly executed by those by
whom they wore made. I understand that
the Fifteenth Amendment to theConstltution
was made to prevent this and the like state
of tilings, and the net of May 31, IH7O, with
the amendments, was passed to enforce its
provisions, the object of this being to guaraii
tee to all citizens the right to vote and to pro
had them in the free enjoyment of Unit rigid.
Enjoined by the Constitution to take care
Unit the laws tie faithfully executed and con
vinced by undoubted evidence that violations
of said act had been OHimmiited and that a wide
spread and flagrant disregard of it was con
templated, the proper officers were instructed
to prosecute the offenders, and troops were
stationed at convenient points to aid these
officers, if necessary, in the performance of
their official duties. Complaints are made of
tliis interference by Federal authority, hut if
the said amendment and act do not provide
for such interference under the circum
stances as above stated then they are
without meaning, force or effect, and the
whole scheme of colored enfranchisement
is worse than mockery and little bet
ter Ilian a crime. Possibly Congress may
find it due to truth and justice to ascertain',
by means of a committee, whether the al
leged wrongs to colored citizens for political
purposes are real, or the reports thereof were
manufactured for the occasion.
The whole number of troops in the States
of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland
and Virginia at the time of the elections was
4,0.83. Tliis embraces the garrisons of all the
forts from the Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico.
Another trouble has arisen in Arkansas.
Article thirteen of the Constitution of the
State, which was adopted in 1868, and upon
tlie approval of which by Congress the State
was restored to representation as one of the
States of the Union, provides, in effect,
that “before any amendments proposed
(• tliis Constitution shall become a
part thereof they shall lie passed by
two successive Assemblies and then sub
inittedtoand ratified by a majority of the
electors of the State voting thereon.” On
May 11, 1874, the Governor convened an ex
tra session of the General Assembly of the
Stale which, on thg IStli of the same month,
passed an act providing for a convention
to frame anew constitution pursuant to
tliis act, and at an election held on the
30th of ,lune, 1874, the convention was ap
proved and delegates were chosen thereto,
who assembled on the 14th of last July
and formed anew constitution, the schedule
of which provided for the election of an
entire new set of State officers in a manner
eontrary to the existing election laws of the
State. On the 13th of October, 1874, this
Constitution, as therein provided, was sub
mitted to the people for their approval or re
jeelion, and according to the election returns
was approved by a large majority of those
qualified to vote thereon, and at the same
lection persons were chosen to 111 1 all
the Stale, county and township offices.
The Governor elected in 1873 for the
term of four years turned over his office
to Hie Governor chosen under the new Consti
tution, whereupon the Lieutenant-Governor,
also eiected in 1872 for a term of four years,
' '.aiming to act as Governor, alleging that
ud proceedings by which the new Constitu
tion was made and anew set of officers
elected were unconstitutional and illegal and
'oid, called upon me, ns provided in Section
C Article 4, of the Constitution, to protect
the State against domestic violence. As
Congress is now investigating the political
affairs of Arkansas 1 have declined to
interfere. The whole subject of Executive
interference with the affairs of a State is re
pugnant to public opinion, to the ft ding of
tlioM who from their official capacity must be
ad in sucli interposition, and to him or those
"bo must direct. Unless most clearly on the
■id” c law, such interference becomes a
rime; with the law to support it, it is con
demned without a hearing. 1 desire, thcre
t 'fe, that all necessity for Executive direction
;,i local affairs may become unnecessary and
obsolete.
I invite the attention, not sf Congress,
but of the people of the United Suites,
t<> the causes and effects of these . un
happy questions. Is there not a disposition
on the one side to magnify wrongs and out
rages and on the other side to belittle
or justify them? If public opinion
’ "hid be directed to a correct sur-
V|, y of what exists, and to rebuking
wrong and aiding the proper author!-
in punishing it, a better state of feeling
weuld be inculcated, and the sooner w>‘would
.have Hint peace which would leave the Slates
I'c indeed to regulate tlicir own domestic
affairs.
i believe that on the part of the citizens of
, 1 ‘ Southern BtaU', the better part of them,
C ure is a disposition to be law-abiding and
J' 1 do no violence either to individuals or
'he laws existing; but do they do right in
'■poring the existence of violence and-blood
shed—in resistance to constituted authority?
I sympathize with their prostrate con
dition, and would do all in ray power to
relieve them, acknowledging that in some in
stances they have had most trying govern
ments to live under, and very oppressive ones
in the way of taxation for nominal improve
ments, not giving benefits equal to the hard
ships imposed; hut can they proclaim them
selves entirely blamless for this condition?
They cannot. Violence has been rampant
in some localities, and has further been justi
fied or denied by those who could have
prevented it. The theory is raised that
there Is to be no further interference on
the part of the General Government to
protect citizens within a Slate where
the State authorities faille give protection.
This is a great mistake. While I remain the
Executive ull the laws of Congress and the
provisions of the Constitution, including the
amendments added thereto, will be enforced
with rigor, with but a regret Unit they should
have added one jot or tittle to the Executive
duties and powers. Let there he fairness in
the discussion of Southern questions, the ad
vocates of both or all political parties giving
honest and truthful reports of occurrences,
condemning the wrong and upholding the
right, and soon all will be well. I’nder exist
ing circumstances the negro votes the
Republican ticket because he knows his
f. ends are of that party. Many a good cit
izen votes the opposite, not because lie agrees
with the great principles of state which sep
arate the parties, but because, generally, he
is opposed to negro rule. This is a most de
lusive cry. Treat the negro as a citizen and a
voter, as he is and must remain, and soon par
ties will he divided, not on the color line, but
on principle. Then we shall have no com
plaint of sectional Interferences.
JUDICIAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the Attorney-General contains
valuable recommendations relating to the ad
ministration of justice in th courts of the
United States, to which 1 invite your atten
tion.
I respectfully suggest to Congress the pro
priety of increasing the numner of the judi
cial districts in the United States to eleven,
the present number being nine, and the crea
tion of two additional Judgeships. The ter
ritory to be traversed by the Circuit Judges
is so great and the business of the courts so
steadily increasing that it is growing more
and more impossible for them to keep up
with tiie busktess requiring their attention.
Whether this would involve the necessity of
adding two more Justices of the Supreme
Court to the present number I submit to the.
judgment of Congress.
THE INTERIOR.
The attention of Congress is invited to the
report of the Secretary of the Interior and to
the legislation asked for by him. The domes
tic interests of the people are more intimately
connected with this department than with
either of the other departments of the Gov
ernment. Its duties have been added to from
time to time until they have become so oner
ous that, without the most perfect system and
order, it will be impossible for any Secretary
of the Interior to keep trace of all official
transactions having his sanction and done in
bis name, and for which he is held person
ally responsible.
I’be policy adopted for the management of
Indian affairs known as the “ peace policy”
lias been adhered to with the most beneficial
results. It is confidently hoped that a few
years more will save our frontier from Indian
depredations. I commend the recommenda
tion of the Secretary for the extension of the
Homestead laws to the Indians, and for some
sort of territorial government for the Indian
Territory. A great majority of tiie Indians
occupying this Territory are believed to lie
incapable of maintaining their rights against
the more civilized and enlightened men. Any
territorial form of government given them,
therefore, should protect them in their homes
and property for a period of at least twenty
years, and before its final adoption should be
ratified by a majority of those affected.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior,
herewith attached, gives some interesting sta
tistical information, which I abstain from giv
ing an abstract of, but refer you to the repor
itself.
PENSIONERS OF THE WAR OF 1812.
The net of Congress providing the oath
which pensioners must subscribe before
drawing their pensions cuts off from this
bounty a few survivors of the war of 1813 re
siding in the Southern States. 1 recommend
the restoration of this bounty to all such.
The number of persons whose names would
be restored to the list of pensioners is not
large. They are all old persons who could
have taken no part in the rebellion, and the
services for which they were awarded pen
sions were in defense of the whole country.
THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION.
The report of the Commissioner of Agri
culture, herewith attached, contains sugges
tions of much interest to the general public
itnd|refers to the approaching Centennial and
thetpart his department is ready to take in it.
I feel that the nation at large is interested in
having this Exposition a success, and com.
mend to Congress such action as will secure
a greater gctieral internet In it. Already
many foreign nations have signified their in
tention to be represented at it. Il may be
expected that every civilized nation will be
represented.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
The rules adopted to Improve the civil
service of the Government have been adhered
to as closely as has been practicable with tho
opposition with which they meet. The effect
of it has been beneficial outlie whole and bus
tended to the elevation of the service; but it
Is inipi aelieable to maintain them without the
direct and positive support of Congress.
Generally, the support which this reform re
ceives is from those who give it their support
only to find fault when tho rules are
apparently departed from. Removals
from office without preferring charges
against parties removed are frequently
cited a> departures from the rules adopted,
and the retention of those against whom
charges are made by irresponsible persons
tmd without good grounds is also often con
demned ns n violation of them. Under these
circumstances, therefore, 1 announce that, if
Congress adjourns without positive legisla
tion on the subject of “civil-service reform,”
1 will regard such action as a disapproval of
the system, and will abandon it. Except so
fur ns to require examination for certain ap
pointees to determine their fitness, com
petitive examinations will tie abandoned.
The gentlemen who have given their ser
vices without compensation us members of
the Board to devise rules and regulations for
the government of the country’s civil service
have shown much zeal and earnestness in
their work, and to them, as well as to myself,
it will be a source of mortification if it is to
be thrown away. But I repeat that it is im
iKissible to carry this system to a success
ful is*sue without general approval and as.
sistauce, and positive law to support it.
THE EMPLOYMENT OF LABOR.
I have slated that the elements of prosper-
Ity to the nation's capital —labor, skilled and
unskilled, and products of the soil —still re
main with us. To direct the employment of
these is a problem desen ing the most serious
attention of Congress. If employment can
lie given to all labor offering itself, prosperity
necessarily follows. 1 have expressed the
opinion, and repeat it here, that t' e first
requisite to the accomplishment of this
end is the substitution of a sound
currency in place of one of a fluctuating
value. ’This secured, there are many Inter
ests that might be fostered, to the great
profit of both labor and capital. How to in
duce capital to employ labor is the question.
CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
The subject of cheap transportation has oc
copied the attention of Congress. New light
on this question will, without doubt, lie given
hy the committee appointed by the last Con
gress to investigate and report upon this sub
jeet.
THE OCEAN CARRYING TRADE.
A revival of ship-building, and particularly
of iron steamship building, is of vast impor
tance to our national prosperity. The
United States is now paying over $1,000,000
per annum for freights and passage on
foreign ships, to he carried abroad ami ex
pended in the employment and support of
other people, beyond a fair percentage of
what should go to foreign vessels, estimating
on the tonnage and travel of each re
spectively. It is to he regretted that
this disparity in the carrying trade exists,
and to correct it 1 would he willing to see
a great departure from the usual course
of the Government in supporting what
might usually he termed private enterprise.
1 would not suggest as a remedy direct sub
sidy to the Ame-ican steamship lines, hut 1
would suggest the direct oiler of ample com
pensation for carrying the mails between the
Atlantic seaboard cities *md tlu Continent on
American-owned and American-built steam
ers, and would extend this liberality to vessels
carrying the mails to the South American
States and to C’entiat America and Mexico,
and would pursue the same policy from
our Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on
the Pacific. It might he demanded that ves
sels built for tills service should come up to a
standard fixed by legislation in tonnage,
speed and all other qualities, looking to the
possibility of the Government requiring them
at sometime for war purposes; the right also
of taking possession of them in such an
emergency should be guarded.
1 offer these suggestions, believing them
worthy of consideration, in all seriousness,
affecting all sections and all interests alike.
If anything better can he done to direct tho
country into a course of general prosperity,
no one" will be more ready than 1 to second
the plan.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Forwarded herewith will he found the re
port of the Commissioners appointed under
an act of Congress, approved June 30, 1874,
to wind up the affairs of the District Govern
ment. It will he seen from the report that
the total debt of the District of Columbia,
less securities on hand and available, is: The
bonded debt Issued prior to July 1, 1874,
$8,882,9+0.4”; 8.65 bonds, by act of Congress
June 30,1874, $3,088,168.78; certificates of the
Board of Audit, $4,770,558.45; total, $15,743,-
667.61; less special improvement assessments
chargeable to private properly in excess,
of any demand against such assess
ments, $1,614,054.37; less Chesapeake A
Ohio Canal bonds, $75,000, and Wash
ington & Alexandria Railroad bonds,
$59,000; in the Lands of the Commissioners
of the Sinking Fund, $1,748,054.87; leaving
the actual debt, less said assets, $13,994,618.34.
In addition to this there are claims preferred
against the Government of the District
amounting In the aggregate, reported by the
Board of Audit, to $8,147,'87.48, of which the
greater part will probably be rejected. This
sum can with no more propriety he included
in the debt of the District Government than
can the thousands of claims against the Gen
erul Government tie included as a portion of
the national debt; hut the aggregate sum
thus stated includes something more than Un
funded debt chargeable exclusively to the
District of Columbia.
The act of Congress of June 20, 1874, con
templates an apportionment between the
United States Government and the District
of Columbia in respect to the payment of the
principal and interest on the 3.65 bonds;
therefore, in computing with precision the
bonded debt of the District, the aggregate
sums above stated, as respects the 3.65
bonds now issued, the outstanding cer
tificates of the Board of Audit, and the un
adjusted claims pending before that Board,
should be reduee<f to the extent of the amount
to be apportioned to the United States
Government in the manner indicated in the
act of Congress of June 20, 1874. 1 especially
invite your attention to the recommendation
ol the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund
relative to the ambiguity of the act of June
20, the interest on the District bonds,
and the consolidation of the indebtedness of
the District.
I feel much indebted to the gentlemen who
consented to leave their private affairs and
come from a distance to attend to the busi
ness of this District, and for the able and sat
isfactory manner in which it has been con
ducted. I am sure their services will be
equally appreciated by the entire country.
It will be seen from the accompanying full
report of the Board of Health that ihe sani
tary condition of the District Is very satisfac
tory. In my opinion the District of Colum
bia should be regarded us the grounds of the
National Capital, in which the entire people
are interested. 1 do not allude to this to
urge generous appropriations to the District,
but to draw the attention of Con
gress, in framing a law for the gov
ernment of the District, to the magnifi
cent scale on which Hie city was planned by
the founders of the Government; the manner
in which, for ornamental purposes, the streets
and avenues were laid out, and what was the
proportion of the properly actually possessed
by the General Government. 1 think the pro
portion of the expenses of the Government
apd Improvements to tie. borne by the General
Government and the cities of Washington and
Georgetown and the country should be care
fully and equitably defined.
THK MISSISSIPPI KIVBK.
In accordance with See. 3 of the act ap
proved June 23, 1874, I appointed a board to
make a survey of the mouth of the Missis
sippi River, with a view to determine the best
method of obtaining and maintaining a
depth of water sufficient for the purposes of
commerce, etc., and, in accordance with an
act entitled “An act to provide for
the appointment of u Commission of Engi
neers to investigate and report a plan for the
excavation of the alluvial basin of the Mis
sissippi River subject to inundation," I ap
pointed a Commission of Engineers. Neither
board has yet completed its labors. When
their reports are received they will be for
warded to Congress without delay.
