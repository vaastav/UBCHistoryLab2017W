Washington, December 2?The House
/or hours to-day debated the Hensley

t> tli? Winston Churchill plan for an
international year's holiday In naval
coriHtructlon, and to-night tho ndvo
oaterj of th? project predicted passage

commended by leaders of all parties
In the Arnerban Congress and by the
President- Majority Leader Under
wood said on the lloor of the House
to-day the resolution probably would
be passed unanimously.
Representative Hensley, of Missouri,
author of the measure, in urging Its
adoption, pointed out that only 'J s>er
Cent of the Cult*"! States revenue Is
devoted to the benefit of agrli ulture,
?while 60 p-r cent (fees to defray
tho cost of past wars and to prepare
for future warn He declared that all
over the country thei? was going up
the cry of tho high cost of living,
while enormous expenditures were be
ing made for military and naval pur
poses.
I'nltert States Should I,rail.
Representative Foster, of Illinois,
said the time had t ome when the United
States should take tVjo lead of all the
world's nations In the movement for
j.eace, to lift the burdens from the peo
ple and to leave th<> settlement of dif
ferences to arbitration.
Representative Moore, of Pennsyl
vania. Insisted that the proposed a>-tlon

ship" Into consldeiaUon >?' the Na\y
Pepartment's lecoirimendntion for the

Representative Rartholdt. of Ml
fiourl, pointed out that with an ir.t>!
natlonal agreement ???! a year's raval

Domestic \n'alrs.
I turn to matters of domestic cut.
? ??.i You already have under consld
erai .??>? a bill fot^ the reform of our
(?ysten. 'if banking arid currency, foi
wlil- h the country waits with impa
tience, na for something- fundamental
tu Us whole business life and necessary
lo not credit fre< fr'jm arbitrary and
artificial restraints. 1 need not Kay
how earnestly 1 hope for Its early
enactment Into law. 1 take leave to
beg that the whole energy and atten
tion of the .Senate be concentrated upon
It till the matter 1? successfully dis
posed of. Aid yet I feel that tho re
quest Is not needed?that the members
<>f that great Ib.us" need no urging
in this service to tho country.
i present to you, in addition, the ur
gent nec-sslt y that special provision
be mad.- also for facilitating the credits
rit'--'ind by the farmers of the country.
The pending currency bill does the
farmers a great service. It puts th?-m
upon an ?in.I footing with other busi
ness men and masters of enterprise,
as I', should: and upon its passage they
will find themselves quit of many of
the difficulties which nov. hamper
them iti the field of credit. The farm
ers. of coureo. ask and should be
Kivc-n no special privilege, such as ex
tending to them the credit <?( the gov

should obtain Is legislation which will
make their own abundant and substan
tial credit resources available as a
'foundation foi Joint. ?'oncerted local
action It, tiie.ii own behalf in getting
the capital they must use. it is to
this we should now address ours-lves.
It lias, singularly enough, come to
pass that we have allowed the Indus
try of our farms to lag behind the
other activities of the country In Its
development 1 need not stop to tell
you how fundamental to the life of the
nation Is the production of Its food,
uur thoughts may ordinarily be con
??entrated upon the cities and the hives
of industry, upon the cries of tho
I crowded market place and the clangor
; of th?* factory, but it Is from the quiet
Interspaces of tho open valleys and the
fret; hillsides that we draw the sources
'of life and of prosperity, from the
farm and the ranch, from the forest
and the mine. Without these every
, street would he silent, every otlice de
' sorted, every factory fallen Into disre
pair And yet the farmer does not stand
'upon the same footing with the fores
ter and the miner in the market of
I credit. He Is the servant of the sea
sons. Nature determines how long he
1 must wait for his crops, and will not
be hurried In her processes He may
give his note, hut the season of its ma
turity depends upon the season when
his crop matures, lies at the gates of
the market where his products are
'sold. And the security he gives is of
'a character not known In the broker's
joflice or as familiarly as It might be on
1 the counter of the banker.
Development of Inarming.
The Agricultural Department of the
I government is seeking to assist as
? never before to make farming an etli
| dent business, of wide co-operative
etfort. In quick touch with the markets
for foodstuffs. The farmers and the
government will henceforth work to
| gether as real partners In this field,
; where we now begin to see our way
very clearly and where many intel
ligent plans arc already being put into
! execution. The Treasury of the United
States has, by a timely and well-con
i s^dered distribution of Its deposits, fa
icllitated the moving of the crops In the
present season and prevented the scar
city of available funds too often ex
perienced at such times. Hut we must
not allow ourselves to depend upon
extraordinary expedients. Wo must

(Government Ownership.
Secretary William M. Martin, of the
Chamber of Commerce, to-day received
a letter from United States Senator
Thomas S. Martin, of which the follow
ing Is an extract:
"I am In thorough accord with the
movement for the government owner
ship of tho 'Crater Farm,' and will use
every effort In my power to that cud."
Tho bill, when introduced In tho Sen
ale, will probably be referred to Sen
ator Martin's committee, and he will
be able to render much servlco in the
matter. Senator Swanson and Con
gressman Watson have both expressed
deep Interest in tho movement, and
will glvo their active aid.
I The Idea to havo tho government
purchase the Crater Farm and some
adjacent acrcs, with tho view to form
ing a nucleus of a national battlefield
park at Petersburg. The Chamber of
Commerce has taken a year's option on
the property for this purpose. Con
gressman Watson recently visited the
property. A national park Is favored
by tho veterans of both the North and
South.

I feel confident that I do not misinter
pret tho wished or tho expectations ot'

enactment of lngishition which will
provide for primary elections through
out the country at which tho voters of
tho several parties may choose their
nominees for the presidency without
tho Intervention of nominating con
ventions. I venture the suggestion that
this legislation should provide for the
retention of party conventions, .but
onlv for the purpose of decl.'irlng and
accepting the verdict of tho primaries
and formulating the platforms of the
parlies; and 1 .sungest that these con
ventions should consist not of dele
gates chosen for this single purpose,
hut of til" nominees for Congress, the
nominees for vacant seats in tho Sen
ate of the United States, the .Senators
whose terms have not yet closed, the
national committees, nnd the candidates
for the presidency themselves, in order
that platforms may be framed by those
responsible to th'? people for carrying
them Into effect.
Other Obligation*.
These are all matters of vital do
mestic concern, and besides them, out
ride the charmed circle of our own na
tional life In whl? h our affections cotn
mand us. as well as our consciences,
there stand out our obligations to
ward our territories oversea. Here
we are trustees. I'orto Jlico, Hawaii,
'the Philippines, ai" ours, indeed, but
not ours to do what we please with.
, Sucli territories, once regarded as
mere possessions, are no longer to be
tf.lllKhly exploited, they are part of
the domain of public conscience and
: of serviceable and enlightened states
manship. W" must administer them
for tho people who live In them and
with the same s> nse of responsibility
to them as toward our own people In
our domestic affairs. No doubt ve
shall successfully enough bind I'orto
ltico and the Hawaiian Inlands to our
selves by ties of Justice nnd interest
1 and affection, but the performance of
lour duty toward tho Philippines Is a.
I more dilllcult and debatable matter.
We can satisfy the obligations of gen
erous Justice toward tho people of
I'orto Rico by giving them the ample
and familiar rights and privileges ac
corded our own citizens In our own
territories and our obligations toward
ill*' people of Hawaii by perfecting the
provisions for self-government already
granted them, t?ut In the Philippines
, we must go further. We must hold
steadily in view their ultimate Inde
pendence. and wo must move toward
i the time of that Independence as stead
ily as the way can be cleared and the
foundations thoughtfully and perma
j nently laid.
Acting under the authority conferred
I upon the President by Congress. I havo
1 already accorded the people of the is
lands a majority in both houses of
I their legislative body by appointing
I fivo Instead of four native citizens to
I the membership of the commission. I
j bellcvo that In this way we shall make
?proof of their capacity In counsel and
1 their sense of responsibility in the ex
| erclse of political power, and that the
'success of this step will be sure to
! clear cur view for the steps which nre
| to follow. Step by step wo should ox
: tend and perfect the system of self
government In the Islands, making
I test of them and modifying them as
; experience discloses their successes
land their failures; that we should
? more and snore put under tho control
jot' the native citizens of the archipel
ago tho essential instruments of their
; life, their local Instrumentalities of
[ government, their schools, all the coin
I man interests of their communities,
'and so bv counsel and experience set
j up a government which all the world
I will see to bo suitable to a people
whose affairs are under their own con
trol. At last. I hope and believe, we.
| are beginning to gain tho confidence
of the Filipino peoples. My their
1 counsel and experience, rather than by
lour own, we shall learn how best to
I serve them and how soon It will bo
possible and wise to withdraw our su

and set out with firm and confident
tread upon It. and we shall not wan

of the country and its people.
liut tho construction of railways In
only tho first step; Is only thrusting In
tiie key to the storehouse and throw
ing buck the lock and oponing tho door.
How the tempting resources of th?
country are to be exploited Is another
mutter, to which I Khali take the lib
erty of front time to time calling
your attention, for It is u policy which
must he worked out by well-conslde; id
stages, not upon theory, but upon lines
of practical expediency. It Is part of
our gi'iicrul problem of conservation
We have a freer hand In working out
tho riroblem In Alaska than in the
States of the Union; :??. in I yet the prin
ciple and object are the same, where
over we toiji h i*. We must use the
resources of Hie country, not lock them
up. There need bo no conflict or jeal
ousy OH between State and Federal au
thorities, for there can be no essential
difference of purpose between them.
1'he resources in question must be
used, but not destroyed or wasted;
used, but not monopolized upon any
narrow Idea of Individual rights a
against the abiding Interests of com
munities. That a policy can l>.< work
t*d out by conference and con ;^9H!oti
which will release these resources and
yet not Jeopard or dissipate them, I
for one have no doubt; and it can be
done on lines of regulation which need
b? no less acceptable to the people
and governments of th- States con
cerned than to the people and govern
ment of tiie nation at large. whoso
heritage these resources are. We must
bend our counsels to this end A com
mon purpose ought to make agree
ment easy.
Three or four matters of special Im
portance and significance 1 b<-tc that
you will permit tne to mention In
? ?losing.
< ?ur llurenu of Mines ought to b<i
equipped and empower* d to render
even more effectual service than it
renders now in improving the condi
tions of mine labor and making the
mines more economically productive
as well as more safe. This Is an all
Important part of the work of conser
vation. ami the conservation of human
life and energy lies even nearer to our
interest than the preservation from
waste of our material resources.
We owe It. in mere justice to the
J railway employes of the country, to
; provide for them a fair and effective
'employers* liability act; and a law that
? we can stand by In this matter will bo
1 no less to the advantage of those who
administer tho railroads of the coun
try than to the advantage of those
whom they employ. The experience
of a large number of the States abun
dantly proves that.
We ought to devote ourselves to
; meeting pressing demands of plain
Justice like this as earnestly as to the
accomplishment of political and oco
j nomlc reforms. Social Justice comes
l first. Ijiiv is tho machinery for Its
realization and is vital only us If ex
presses and embodies it
Safely nt Sen.
An international congress for the
discussion of all questions that affect
j safety at sea l? now sitting in Lon
don at the suggestion of our own gov
| ernment. So soon as the conclusions of
| that congress can be learned and con
sldered we ought to address ourselves,
I among other things, to the prompt al
I levi.ition of the very unsafe, unjust,
and burdensome conditions which now
surround the employment of sailors and
render it extremely difficult to obtain
j tho services of spirited and competent
\ men such as every sliin needs if It is
! to bo safely handled and brought to
I port.
May I not express the very real
pleasure I have experienced in co-oper
ating with this Congress and sharing
with It the labors of common service
to which it has devoted Itself so un
deservedly during the past seven
i months of uncomplaining concentra
tion upon the business of legislation'.*
Surely it Is a proper and pertinent part
i of my report on "the state of the
1 nlon'' to express my admiration for
the diligence, the good temper and
the full comprehension of public duty
whh h have already been manifested by
both the Houses; and 1 hope that It
\ may not bo doomed an impertinent In
trusion of myself into the picture If
I say with how much and how con
stant satisfaction I have availed
?myself of tho privilege of putting mv
j time and energy at their disposal alike
I in counsel ami In action.

PLANS OF HOUSE LEADERS
Policy Will Enable Members to

Next Year.
(Special to Thi Times-Dispatch.]
W ashington, December 2.?Dernocratlo
, House leafier t'nderwood announced
to-day that tho legislatlvo poller of
J Mouse leaders at. thi present session
| would be to drive through all appro
t>rl;itton bltls. With (heso out ?>r th**
way, It Ih l><" 11eved greater speed can
bo made In disposing of other legisla
tion. beginning with the antitrust
ni>!isur"s of th<> administration.
?Uicrht of way Is to bo K-iven the
appropriation bills," said Mr. Under -
?wood. "Tlii'y are to bo taken up as
i last ns they . an brought from tho
i committees. Sufficient time is to b.^
uiv'-n for 11i? I;? consideration, but long
winded general debates are to bo
sb..rt,.ru"l. Debate* are to come on
tho mils themselves.
Xe\t year will be a busv one for
, members of the ilouse. The emotions
for their return or succession will
; come on early, and many will have
Mights, both at the primaries and In
the K'-neral election. We do not wan'
! the session to drasj along till late in
the summer, which would bo tho r*
suit of belated appropriation bills. It
is the general belief that with the ap
propriatlon bills pass.-d, the House can
more rapidly and eTectlveiy work on
other matters of prime legislative im
portance, because there will bo no
t privib-god bills to take prcccd'nc?
and delay action."
PlanH of the leaders contemplate
favorable action <>n trust legislation
; employers' liability, rural credit ana
seamen's protection, and while the Sen
ate may delay action and drag alons.
the House, with cleared calendars, can
let its members disperse at intervals
for their electioneering.
SHE GAVE UP
On Account of Her Weakness, But
Cardui, the Woman's Tonic,
Brought Back Strength
Summit, Va.?Mrs. Leonora Walk
er, of this place, has the following to
say regarding her experience with
Cardui, tho woman's tonic: "Before
I began to take Cardui I suffered
with womanly troubles, and, also,
with what I thought was stomach
trouble. T was so weak I had to give
up all my housework, and could not
I do any of the cooking.
r commenced taking Cardui, th*
woman's tonic, and after the third
! (,a>* 1 began to feel better. Have
j now used five bottles, and am well.
I and can do all of my housework and
j cooking by myself. In fact. I feel
like a new woman.
I shall be only too glad to do any
thing I can to help praise tho Cardui
(Home Treatment, for it. Is ti0 good
for suffering women, r shall never
bo without it."
I
I'or over hall! a century Cardui haa
?been hoping to build weak, nervous.
: tired-out women hark to strensth
jand health. It goes to the seal of
the trouble and buildr? up womanly
; strength w here It is mos'. needed.
Cardui may he tho very mediciue
jour system has long been needing.
;Clet a bottle from your druggist to
day. It cannot harm you. and should
surely do for you what It has done
j for so many thousands of others.
