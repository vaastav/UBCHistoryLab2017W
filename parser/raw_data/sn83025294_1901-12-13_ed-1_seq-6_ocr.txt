FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13. '.901.
The statement of a Boston paper to
the effect that at the M. O. P. smelter
fire in April the Butte & Boston lire
brigade did not exert its utmost efforts
to confine and extinguish '«the flame«,
does a three-fold injustice and injury,
t First, that statement is an insult to
the character of the miners and smelter
men who are members of the Butte &
Boston fire brigade. Such men have a
sense of duty and professional honor as
creditable to them as are those of the
richest men in the land. They were
fighting that fire in good faith. They
were fighting under instructions of Su
perintendent John Gillie because it was
their duty to do so. They were fighting
it to save the employment of 700 or S00
of their brethren in the ranks of toil,
who would be thrown idle if the smelter
were destroyed. They were fighting it
in a neighborly spirit of mutual protec
tion. Th,ey displayed no apathy an.l
would have displayed none had they been
ordered to do so. They were loyal men
and true, and any insinuation against
them is an insult to the cause of labor
and an outrage upon every member of
the 'brigade.
The Boston paper story does infinite
(harm to the (business interests of Butte,
for it alleges a condition here in which
no Investment of Eastern money would
he safe. The business men of Butte are
anxious to have other companies organ
ized to develop mining property here.
They would welcome rtew capital and
new energy in order that the pay-roll
might be increased, the population kept
busy and the metal output enlarged. Yet
if such bitterness exists between mining
companies, as the Boston blackmailers
assert, Butte would be in a condition
little better than one of civil war. Every
business man knows the facts, of the
M. O. P. fire, and indignantly resents
the story that it was not extinguished
at the earliest possible moment by the
equally zealous work of the Butte .t
Boston and M. O. P. fire brigades.
■ Even the state at large suffers from
this Boston libel. The companies known
generally as the Amalgamated distribute
yearly among the people of Montana
more than nine-tenths of their total out
put. They employ, under normal condi
tions, from 10,000 to 15.000 men, and pav
out for wages alone $15,000,000 per year
in this state. These companies, working
over three-fourths of the miners em
ployed in Butte, are doing business in
nearly every county in the state. They
chiefly help to make Butte a market for
all the surplus agricultural products of
the state. Other companies are also doing
splendid work in the upbuilding of Mon
tana. Yet there are men in this state
Who, because the Amalgamated refuses
to be bled at every turn, would drive be
yond the borders of the state every dollar
i't has invested in Montana and throw
out of employment every man on Its pay
roll. Should the plotters ever succeed, it
iwould be a sorry day for Montana until
new capital might be brought to replace
that driven out. In the meantime, the
state would not be very prosperous.
The jieople do not forget the depression
Which resulted when the great Alice,
Lexington. Moulton and Silver Bow
Silver mines closed. To close our copper
plants, or a majority of them, would be
®till worse. The capitalists could stand
the loss, but the farmers and working
men could not.
5 The democratic papers of Montana
display strong symptoms of a desire to
climb into the republican band-wagon.
The president's message has left the
western democracy not a peg to hang a
hope upon. The most rabid democratic
papers are the first to commence swing
ing into line. They no 'longer argue for
free wool. They no longer deny repub
lican prosperity. They no longer de
mand the relinquishment of the Philip
pines. They would like to indorse every
suggestion the president made in his
message. His views on the Chinese,
Irrigation, a Pacific cable, labor legisla
tion, trust regulation and civil service
are all in line with western Interests.
The workingmen applaud his every
Utterance. They are joining the repub
lican party by the thousand. They will
make Montana republican in 1904. The
Anaconda Standard alone 'is clinging to
Bryan and anti-imperialism.
The lowly catfish is to be transplanted
from his home in the muddy waters of
the Missouri river to France, where the
Seine will be stocked. When Frenchmen
hook a lusty specimen of this long
horned fish, the skill of the expert
duelist will be called Into play. The
Sharp thrust of a catfish Is more savage
than the sword wound received in the
fashionable French duel.
As .between the Panama and Nica
raguan canal routes the commission has
been generally commended for deciding

THE CASH BASIS.
Saturday will be a big day at the Mon
tana state house. On that day the last
item of general fund warrants will bo
wiped out. The amount is $370,000.
There will be a number of other state
warrants redeemed at the same time,
and the cash of the state will take the
place of credit in transactions which
take money from the general fund.
Every other fund of the state is in good
condition, and it is a matter of congrat
ulation that a cash basis has at last been
reached in a portion of the state's affairs.
Happily Montana has never been debt
ridden or lacking in credit. Judicious
economy in state affairs has been the
rule.
On the face of the tax returns from
various sections of the state it seems
that residents of Montana have paid
their annual assessments with more
than ordinary promptness. There will
not be a long delinquent list in any
county, and every evidence is at hand to
prove that the burden of state support
is not heavy. As a factor *n the state's
development, this condition is of im
mense value. A high rate of taxation,
a state or county heavily in debt or with
poor credit, are the signs at which men
with money to invest take alarm. The
state of Montana is fortunate in having
so conducted its affairs that it stands
near the head of the list in whatever
pertains to stability in money matters.
When the rate of taxation in sections
of the state where the assessment is a
shade too heavy is sealed down there
will be further cause for rejoicing. It is
up to county commissioners to see to it
that economy is made the rule in ex
penditures of public funds.
j
In urging the matter of the Hay
Pauncefote treaty to a vote early next
week, the present congress is breaking
records for rapid transaction of busi
ness. Usually the period immediately
following the opening day is given over
to easy methods of killing time and
waiting for the Christmas holidays.
For once the sedate old Congressional
Record has scooped the yellow journals
out of their boots. In the'brief sketch
of Senator Depew's life, printed in the
first issue of the publication, is the
startling announcement: "Married in
December, 1901, to Miss May Palmer."
Ben Kilpatrick was sentenced yester
day at St. Louis for forgery, and today
the court landed Miss Bullion in the
soup. The episode is proof that the pen
is mightier than several things, but
must give way before the superior
ability of the Pinkerton detective.
Unfortunately, Ben Kilpatrick, the
tractable and industrious train robber,
has been sentenced to work out a term
of years in the Missouri penitentiary
instead of in Montana.^ He would make
an ideal hand on the big ranch of the
Deer Lodge prison.
At last Bryan's Commoner has laid
violent hands upon the president's mes
sage. The hindsight of the Nebraska
editor still keeps several laps ahead of
his foresight, enabling him to tell just
how a thing should toe done two weeks
after it is over.
The St. Louis exposition is not well ad
ver:' v;d. lew know that it is ambitious
to be known as the greatest show ever
held on earth. There are many evidences
of coming frost in the advertising which
has given scant publicity to the greatest
features of the fair.
.One of the most important matters to
come before the present congress is the
Philippine tariff. It is to be voted on
next week. Th'is record for the new con
gress affords a toase upon which to raise
great expectations.
Patriotic citizens of Holland feel that
Christmas in the land of windmills would
be more cheerful 'if the populace was
allowed to celebrate a funeral in high
life, with Prince Henry as candidate for
obituary honors.
The verdict of the Schley court Of in
quiry is said to be ready for delivery and
may be submitted this week. Secretary
Long will confer a favor by requesting
the inquiry board to keep the verdict un
der 20,000 words.
And now the relations between Chile
and Argentine Republic are strained.
The South American countries have got
the imbroglio business down so fine that
further straining seems unnecessary.
President Roosevelt has said that he
will make a trip to the West next sum
mer. If congress continues in session
until June, there is not great likelihood
of the promise being easily kept.

That is a very smooth scheme just ar
ranged to capture the next legislature
and gain control of the supreme court by
electing a slate ticket next fall, but the
people of Montana know more than they
did last year about reform, and the state
will either go straight republican or
straight democratic. The fuslonfsts will
appear only to disappear.
What is now the white house will soon
be used exclusively as the president's
private residence. A bill has been in
troduced by Senator Lodge for the con
struction of a building which the presi
dent will use as an office residence. This
plan seems much better than tearing
down or remodeling the historic white
house.

The annual exhibit of a treasury sur

When Christmas presents are delayed
in transit this year it will be easy to
blame it on the car famine.
Next Thursday the senate will adjourn
for a three weeks' vacation. t

DANGEROUS FOG.
Some Damage Done to Shipping and
Much Delay.
(By Associated Press.)
New York, Dec. 13.—A heavy fog that
descended on the city in the early morp
ing caused a delay of traffic all ov,er
the city. Ferries, elevated trains and
surface cars were impeded, and as the
day 'wore on its effects were even more
serious. The entire ferry system of 'bo£h
rivers was upset.
The ferry boat Mauch Chunk, coming
from Communipaw with a large crowd
of passengers, stumbled on a tow of
brick scows and had her steering gear
disarranged.
S'he was adrift for 25 minutes until
her rudder was put in shape. In some
instances boats were an hour in making
the passage that usually requires 8 or 10
■minutes.
A number of vessels which arrived last
night remained at quarantine, as it was
impossible to make the passage up the
harbor in safety.

MOUSE EXPOSED SWINDLE.
Hhen something'in'the girFs mannër
Woman Who Claimed to Be Blind Saw
It Immediately.
Just why some women stand in mortal
terror of a harmless little mouse, though
ready to face suffering and real danger
with calmness ancU fortitude not often
found in members of the other sex, is a
mystery which is likely to retain all of
its present-day impenetrability. A cer
tain oculist in town has given a good
'leal of study to this and other unac
countable ways of women. Not long ago
he had a splendid chance to show how
easily a woman can be thrown from her
poise at sight of the little rodent named.
A young woman wearing colored glasses
and accompanied by her mother called to
consult him. They wanted from him a
certificate of total blindness, frankly de
claring that such a document would se
cure for the daughter certain aids and
advantages not otherwise procurable.
They came to him, they said, because of
his professional prominence.
The oculist examined the girl's eyes
'•losely, but could find no indication of
defect. That might be so and blindness
still exist, however, so tests of the
strongest light were brought into use,
but the girl declared she was absolutely
unable to distinguish between light and
darkness. Other tests, some of them
rjuitc painful were also tried, but all
were borne with patience. The doctor
was puzzled. To all appearances the girl
was blind, but he could not find where
the defect lay. However, he was half
disposed to grant the desired certificate
slight relaxation in rigidity of the
facial expression—caused him to try one
more experiment. He dismissed the
patient with Instructions to call on the
following day, giving him time to pre
pare his plan.
AYhen the girl arrived at the time ap
pointed the doctor had her securely
blindfolded with a heavy bandage. Then
he held up a live mouse by the tail about
a foot from her. face and told his assist
ant to remove the bandage. The moment

Her Royal Highness, Woman.
Max O'Rell, who is authority on mat- j
ters feminine, is telling tales out of I
school for the enjoyment of his con
tinental readers.
In writing his impressions of Amer
ica. he notes particularly the difference
between the preoccupied gaze of the
men and the gay. smiling faces of the
women of this country.
Again he voices this bit of philoso
phy :
"AA'liere is tjie new woman to be
found? Put together 100 women, intel
ligent and of good society; take out
the beautiful ones; then take out the i
married ones who are loved by their !
husbands and children, and kindly seek
the new woman among those who are |
left—ugly women, old maids and dis
appointed and neglected wives. AA r oinen,
priests and poultry never have enough,
but in wishing to extend her empire
woman will destroy It."
Quicksilver in Texas.
Texas has already taken her place
among the states as a prominent pro
ducer of fuel oil, supplementing Cali
fornia's output of the product in par
ticular. Important developments last
year in her quicksilver mines, in the
Terlingua district, show that the de
posits of cinnabar are much more exten
sive than was at first believed. It is ,
probable that Texas will therefore be
come second only to California in her ;
output of quicksilver. Recent prospect- ,
ing shows that the mineralized area is ,
about eight miles long, lying in an east
and west direction. The production of
quicksilver in California is larg* enough
to supply almost the entire home mar
ket,
A Sufficient Reason.
An officer in one of the English vol
unteer regiments who had made himself
exceedingly unpopular with the men,
was coming home one evening when he
slipped and fell into deep water. He
was rescued with great difficulty by a
private in his own regiment.
The officer was profuse in his expres
sions of gratitude and asked his pre
server how he could reward him.
"The best way." said the soldier, "is
to say nothing about it."
"But why?" asked the officer in
amazement.
"Because," was the blunt reply, "if
the other fellows knew I'd pulled you
out they'd chuck me in."—Youth's Com

Sam's Einal Advice.
Sam Jones, in one of his sermons, took
women to task for spending more time
ink prinking than praying. "If there's
a woman here," he screamed finally,
"who prays more than she prinks, let
her stand up."
One poor old faded specimen of fem
(ninity, in the sorriest, shabbiest of
clothes, arose.
"You spend more time praying than
prinking?" asked the preacher, taking
her all in.
The poor old creaure said she did—
prayed all the time, prinked not at all.
"You go straight home," admonished
Jones, "and put a little time in on prink
ing."—Exchange.
