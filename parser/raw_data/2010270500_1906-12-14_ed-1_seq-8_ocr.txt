WHEN Pierre Nadeau brought
bis blooming- brlda to the Kiver
Tachot, be wai young and
strong, fresh from thn lumber
camps of Lake St. John. Ha had been
Appointed wharf foreman In hl new
home, and had grown old and graj as
time went on. until a email farm and
dwelling, bouRht with the frulta of bis
toll, provided a shelter for bia declining
years.
Two aona had been born to the Na
Jeans. wbo, aa they grew to manhood,
west naturally to the lumber campe. Al
ter a time, however, attracted by prom sea
f higher wages and cash payment, in lieu
of store trade, they nought the growing
West. When they left their home they
were dad In provincial fashion; when
they returned, on a visit only, they were
clad In store clothes and radiant neck
irear, and they used strange Engllh, such
a made the IVre Nadeau sick at heart.
Finally, after unbridled depreciation of
tie urronndings in which they were born
nd bred, they departed by schooner and
tneltlng finally into the Orient were seen
too more.
But their daughter Angeline remained
them, brown of hair and eyes, the trim
neas of her supple form manifest despite
the fashion of dress considered at that
arly period becoming to the daughters of
old France. The long, loose blouse, and
short, homespun flannel kirtle, relics of a
Norman peasantry, which on other women
ta.de them to appear squat, foiled to hide
Iter well rounded proportions and maiden
ly grace.
She had a sharp tongue, had thia daugh
ter of the Nadeaua, and when she was
terry her laughter rang out like alelgh
belhi In winter's frost. Sunday after
Mon, when vespers were over, was the
tine when she would exercise her sharp
wit; when, with the other maids of the
hamlet she sought the lumber wharf to
way words of badinage with the lighter
men, deal handlers and trimmers gathered
there.
There were no frivolities on week daye,
nowever, when Angeline milked the cows,
and made tasty butter for the Nadeau
table. This done she wonld seat herself
at the loom, which would ring out its
rapid click-clack to the push of her vig
orous foot, as It turned out Its webs of
linen, flannel or catelonne, for village con
ammptlon. She was as quick with her
little handa and feet aa with that biting,
scornful tongue of hers.
Every Tear, aa the big ship Margaret
Pollock anchored off the shore tor cargo,
Captain Locke would pay her a visit the
Moment he set foot on land. Clean
haven, but for a fringe of fierce red whis
ken, his face was vast and lurid as the
setting sun. lie wort broadcloth on such

lie always brought her a present, some
trifle picked up In a foreign port, which
lie wouli donate in an oiTband manner.
Sometimes the girl would kiss his gnarled
cheek, and he would clap her on the shoul
v tier softly with a hand which, clenched,
could fell an ox.
One day the schooner Notre Dame dee
Anges came In. to load farmers' stuff, hav
ing been chartered for thia purpose by a
Wack-browed man of thirty-five about,
who gave bis uanie aa Boisvert. Lie
swaggered to a certain extent, and was
dad in garments supposed to be of fash
ionable cut and texture. The women
thought hint hanosome, but his eyes were
set rather close together for beauty, and
his nose, bent, and with a scar In the
concave section, gave to hla face a sinister
expression. During the intervals of load
ing he sat much In the house of le pere
, Nadeau, depreciating their surroundings.
His constant disparagements at le.sth
took root In the girl's mind, and her en
wironment grew narrow and bald the more
1 he talked. He assaned the feminine fash
ions of the port, too ; so that when a
modiste drifted to the village from St.
Michel, with steel engraved fashion plates
not three years of age, Angeline became
her first customer. One Sunday she went
to church In a new gown, of bright color,
with a hat decked with red paper flowers,
and a ribbon at her neck of poppy hue.
M. Boisvert was fillei'sVvith admiration,
"How the boys would cast soft eyes at
you In St. Roch," he asured her with a
melting look.
-Go away, M. Boisvert," was her re
tort, but it waa accompanied with an af
fected toss of her pretty bead. Which the
old Nadeau and his wife disliked, though
they could not just say why. So did
Clapha Ouellet. lie bad been a log job
ber, and having been successful in bis
contracts, he had invested his capital In
snug farm In St. Angele, where his old
mother kept his house clean until such
THEUl DAUGUTKJi ANUEUQUE REMAINED,
time as Augeliue would consent to be
come the mistress. Alas for bis topes
the girl bad of lata become contemptuous
of the prospect.
"It's bad euougb here by the sea, but
Bi. Angele, with nothing but the big
-Wood to see bah !
-It's all that Boisvort," said Clapha
angrily. "Octave Lavoie, the navigator,
says he has a wife auj five children in
Lorette."
"It's false," snapped Angeline with
flashing eyes.
The Notre Dame sailed st length for
Quebec; but the supreme content of Cla-
phns and the old Nadeaua was but short
lived. Rut a few weeks had passed when
she returned to her old moorings, laden
with wind-blown apples for sale or ex
change, with Boisvert, debonaire and ryn
ical as before, at his former post. Cap
tain Locke was in port at the time, and
took an Instant and unconcealed dislike
to him.
One dark fall night, while the hum of
a coming easterly wind was heard in the
trees which overhung the river, the Notre
Dame des Anges swung round to the cur
rent, and slipped out seaward, with Ange
line seated, scared, and already repentant,
on a cabin locker.
There was consternation In the Nadeau
dwelling when the morning light revealed
an empty nest in the old familiar attic,
from which she had never been absent for
a night since her cradle had been con
signed to the barn loft She had discard
ed her despised house dress, of blouse and
flannel kirtle, woven by her own hands, of
striped purple and yellow. The sabot
shaped shoes bad been tossed Into a cor
ner; all her newer belongings she hnd
taken with her; and the mother Nadeau
collected the despised truck and folding
them up, laid them carefully away. In
the sombre. Inarticulate manner of the
peasant, they accepted their sorrow. ,
These were the early, undeveloped days
of the East, when the railroad and tele
graph were unknown east of Quebec, and
but a bi-weekly mail, by horse and ca-
leche or sled, carried tidings of the out
side world. Once navigation closed, the
door was shut upon the dwellers in the
eastern hamlets bordering on the gulf. So
the snow fell In deep drifts, and the light
ers were pack -screwed high above the Ice,
which rose and fell with the tides, their
masts looking ghostlike In the dark winter
nights. The -once joyous fetes passed un
noticed by Pere Nadeau and bis wife
Christmas, New Year's Day and they
sat alone and silent, or went about their
daily tasks as best they might. Sometimes
the neighbors called, but while they spoke
of what was passing ; of the cut of logs,
of the prospect of a good year's shipping
to come, of Angeline they spoke no word.
When lbs summer tides flowed blue aud
sparkling once more, Claphas Ouellet, em
barking his winter's cut of cordwood on
the schooner of the navigator, Octave La
voie, sailed for Quebec, returning after
an absence of a couple of weeks, lie
stepped into the Nadeau dwelling casually
on his return.
"Well, Claphas." said the old man In
g renting, "your health is good?"
"Yes. thanks -
"The cordwood sell well?"
"Not bad. Twenty-five shillings."
"See anything of my girl 1"
"Yes."
"Is ah welir
"Yes. Works in a hotel."
"Hotel'? Not with him, then?"
"No. She left him quick. He bsd his
own wife and family, same as Octave
said."
"The accursed. Didn't speak of coming
backr
"No. Well, I must go; lbs old mother
will be anxious by now for me. If she
comes, you will send me word, eh?"
"Yes, we will send you word, Clsphas."
When the Margaret Pollock anchored
for cargo that fall, and the news of An
gelint'a abduction was conved to Cap-
tain Locke, his face grew purple with
fury, and he stormed so terribly on the
wharf that the hands, in their terror, hid
behind the deal piles, peeping round the
corners with scared faces. From Octave,
the navigator, he extracted the news of
her present rircumstsnces, and bocsme
somewhat more calm, though still awful lu
his frown.
For the second time since the flight of
Angeline, Christmas eve came round.
"We will go to church this year, my
wife."
"les, we will go."
Having prepared a store of kindling
wood against their return, they extin
guished their lamps, and locking the door,
deposited the key in a secret niche of the
porch, known to no outsider. As they
turned into the Kempt road, which like
a three-mile tunnel, by reason of the
spruce boughs which met and interlaced
overhead, led to the church, a faint, long
drawn wail from the opposite bank of the
river came to their ears.
"It is the horn of the mail driver," said
Pere Nadeau.
The church was aglow with the light of
many candles, set In temporary sconces,
on either side, and from the altar and the
deep box stoves were like great rubles,
so hearty were the fires of seasoned wood
which crackled within. In the choir loft,
fiddles were being tuned, and as the ser
vice proceeded there rolled forth to their
accompaniment from the vigorous throats
of the young farmer choristers, the well
known carols of the season. Then the
priest from the rail of the altar spoke in
fatherly tones, and the duty of forgive
ness, even as we expect to be forgiven,
was his theme. Pere Nadeau touched
gently his wife's hand, as the word of the
preacher touched them both on a bidden,
quivering chord, and their old lips moved
in unison as they prayed.
The wind bad arisen to a gale, as they
returned to their home, a fine, cutting
drift obscuring tho sight; but as they
drew near. In a momentary lull In the
storm, a spark of light twinkled forth for
an instant upon the snow. The Pere Na
deau reined up, and crossed himself with
a trembling hand.
"What is wrong, my basoned?" asked
his wife.
"A light in our window," he said, In a
scared whisper. Then he heard a soft,
happy laugh, half amothered by her
shawl, and wondered.
FATHER TIME FINISHES ANOTHER ROUND.
"Drive on fust, my husband ; one per
son only knows the place in which we
hide the key."
The windows were all alight when they
reached the porch, and from the pipe
which served ns chimney, clouds of long,
fenthery cin.lors from the fire of dry deal
ends flew hissing into the whirling drift.
Then he saw Rleigh tracks, which came
to aud turued from the door, and under
stood. "The mall driver must have brought
whom?"
He brushed the suow from a window
pane, and looking In, saw Angelina dress
ed In her once discarded blouse and girtle
of purple and yellow even the moccasins,
had come, bringing such happiness as be
had never dreamed could be his again.
He led the old mare to her stall, and
as he rubbed down her shnggy coat he re
called the old, old parable, grandest of
all the Hook. The poetry of the story, he
could not grasp, of course, any more than
he could realize the glory of the antithe
sis, with which It ended; but the words
came to him, even in the voice of the
wind, aa it moaned In the eaves or round
the corners and gables of tho barn, and
he uttered them in a voice which broke
with the very weight of his joy,
"For this my child was dead and Is
alive neat it, was lost and is found."

HR1STMA8 day

Chicago Tribune:
Santa Claus Pack.
All form in line
and march to a
train on the
no to tne next
rrMim. where a table
holds the contents of Santa Claus' pack.
They look at every object on the table
and then march back. The company now
divides In half, one-half leaving the room,
the table and its contents having been
covered. Those remaining choose some
object which they remember seeing; the
piano begins to play again and the others
return. The leader gives to the returning
party a word which rhymes with' the ob
ject chosen. Thus, If It was a ball, he
might mention the word "hall." The re
turning party now proceed to guess what
object bas been chosen, and they express
their guess by acting in pantomime. They
do not all suggest the object in the same
way, but each according to his individual
fancy, but they must all agree upon the
object they will guess. If wrong they go
out for another trial and so on until
guessed, when the other half of the com
pany goes out, and they remain and select
the object for the others to guess.
Hiding the Mistletoe. All form in line,
ingle file, and march about the room or
several rooms until the music stops. They
then proceed to hunt the mistletoe, which
the leader carried in his hand and con
cenled somewhere during the march. The
finder must effect return to the starting
point without being touched by the leader.
Santa Clans' Sleigh. Six girls are har
nessed to a little sleigh or sled, and the
white ribbon reins are held by a seventh.
The sled Is filled with small parcels in
colored papers containing .Christmas
crackers or any trifles as favors. The patty
goes round the room several times, dis
pensing the favors to the young men. who
proceed to select partners and dance until
a aignal from the leader calls all to march
around the room and back to their places.
Snowball. A large white ball of tissue
paper Is suspended well out of the way of
bric-a-brac. The young girls take turns
at shooting at this hall with a small rub
ber ball. When hit with sufficient force
it breaks and out falls a shower of small
er white balls, perhaps , popcorn balls,
which are gathered and presented as fav
on . for the next march or dance. As
there should be only about half as many
balls aa there are couples duueing, this
will cause a scramble among the small
boys who gather them up and who, for
fair dealing, should b9 kept behind a cer
tain line until the bull receives the shot

Clara Lee l'uckette, In Washington Post
In the darkness ahead there were oeea-
ional flares of red (lames, and from them !
ascended long, comet-like tracks of light
that flashed Into momentary blazes. The
boom of the cannon, the wierd shrieking
of the shells and their sharp explosion
blended in one wild devil's concert. i
The boy from Maine drew back quickly
from the muzzle of the starboard gun No.
of the United States gunboat Mackinaw.
The old gunner standing rigid drew the
lanyard toward himself with a sudden
jerk. There was a deafening roar and ft
cloud of choking smoke enveloped the gun
crew. Another shell had been sent into
the solid earthworks of Fort Fisher.
The boy from Maine rushed forward
through the smoke and thrust the denn
ing rod into the muzzle of the gun. An
other of the crew dashed a pail full of
water over the long steel tube. The gun
was reloaded and another shell was hurl
ed at the spurts of flame ahead. They
bad been doing this at Intervals since the
early afternoon, and now it was almost
midnight midnight of Christmas eve,
18C4.
Cease firing," came a hoarse order
out of the dark. The gun crew of No. 1
flung themselves down on the sloppy deck
with audible sighs of relief. The devil's
concert did not abate noticeably. The
remaining vessels of the Federal fleet
were still exchanging compliments with
Fort Fisher.
The old gunner quickly filled his pipe.
and the glow from the bowl half illumin
ed his wrinkled face now and then.
"Put's me in mind of a Christmas eve
I spent at the mines in Californy," he
remarked, "only it's just a mite worse."
Don t talk about Christmas, said one
of the crew in a husky voice. "I left
three children at home. They are in bed
now and three little stockings are banging
above the fireplace same as always. I
hope. The wife is sitting np a while may
be, a thinking of me or maybe saying a
bit of a prayer. Don't like to think of it
when things are so dubious. What are
you thinking about. Frits?"
Of the VaterJand some," replied an
unmistakable accent. "Vat is the matter
mit the boy? II is always talking be
fore."
The boy heard nothing. He sprawled
on the deck with his head on one arm.
The smell of the pine trees and the odor
of boiling maple sap was In bis nostrils.
He was many hundreds of miles away
from the Mackinaw, off Fort Fisher, back
in the Maine woods with a sugaring pnrty.
The smoke of the pine-knot fire was ris
ing slowly and the golden brown syrup
hissed and bubbled In the kettles. Merry
little shrieks of laughter rang in his ears.
She was there, the pink and white of her
face so prettily emphasized by the mink
tippet. How absurdly small those little
red mittens seemed in comparison with
his ! How blue her eyes were ! There
was no one looking just one kiss on
those lips created solely for the purpose
"Starboard batteries commence firing!
came the hoarse and relentless order from
the darkness.
A none too gentle kick brought thn
boy back to the Mackinaw, but her face
looked at him for an instant out of the
gloom. Starboard gnu No. 1 again added
its voice to the devil's chorus.
The sky began to turn from black to
gray. A Christmas present, said th
gunner grimly as he jerked the lanyard.

New Year's is upon us again. Let ns

proceed in a sagacious spirit, sharing the
road with the rest of the folks and not

stronger than their mistakes. So It was
wih Lincoln ; so with Washington. The

NEW YOBK.
Colder weather, combined with tht
npproneh of the holidays, has greatly
stimulated retail trade at most points
and the outlook favors a record break
ing Christmas trade. The car shortage
continues, tliough grain deliveries In
the Northwest are freer, but on the
whole the paucity of railway facilities
is seriously affecting many sections,
and in consequence some foundries la
the St Louis and Cleveland districts
have been compelled to close. Manu
facturers are busy the country over,
the pressure being so great as to cause
a considerable number of plants to
work night and day. Labor still con
tinues scarce, and wage advances are
recorded generally, but the tendency
to nroid higher wages seems to be un
dergoing continuous expansion. Money
is high In the cities where the demand
is extensive, but most interior towns
appear to be plentifully supplied, hence
country bankers are seeking commer
cial paper. Bradstreet'a Mercantile
