EIGHT HUNDRED
SENATE BILLS
Unprecedented Introduction
of Important Measures
PROPOSED MARCH LEGISLATION
Tho Presidents Recess Appoint
ments ana tho TJay Pauncefote
Treaty Considered in Executive
Sos3ion and Referred to Com
mittees
The recommendations laid down in the
message of President Roosevelt to Con
gress on Tuesday were yesterday acted
upon with surprising alacrity by the
members of the Senate
No less than eight bills and resolutions
were presented dealing with the question
of anarchy in its various forms Various
punishments were suggested and many
methods proposed hut all rested upon
the lines laid down by the President
Aside from this other questions were
snapped up
It was ovident that some midnight oil
had been burned over the message as one
of the first measures proposed was one
for the construction of a Pacific cable
Close upon the heels of this came a half
dozen measures dealing with the isthmian
canal Some dozen Senators came to the
fore with legislation dealing upon the De
partment of Commerce idea advanced by
Mr Roosevelt while at least twenty
measures tending to enforce the Chinese
exclusion law were offered during the
day
Yesterday was the first business ses
sion held by tho new Senate and the
bills and resolutions which had been ac
cumulating during the recess were un
loaded upon the defenceless clqrks There
were at least S00 bills of all sorts intro
duced during the day and these covered
every range from private claims to great
undertakings
A feature of tho day was the receipt of
the report of the Isthmian Canal Com
mission followed by the presentation of
the -new Hay Paunccfote treaty The
galleries were well filled during the day
many ladies being present
Important 3Icnxure
More bills of an Important character
were introduced yesterday than have ever
been known within the same space of
time The assassination of President Mc
Kinley furnished the basts for many of
them thp author of each apparently be
ing eager to have his name go iown in
history as the statesman who had solved
iunrnhlem of abating the evils of
anarchy
The exclusion of the Chinese formed a
fruitful theme for Senatorial considera
tion while it Is the current belief that
the number of claim bills and others of
a private character will this session
break all previous records The surplus
in the Treasury will be speedily ex
hausted if favorable consideration is giv
en to the bills alree1 uroduced Judg
ing from the inTmocr of public building
bills IctrodvTJd there will be but few
BIJSHlMres ofanyimportance throughout
the country that will be deprived of at
least the pleasurable anticipations that
accompany consideration of such public
favor
Every subject under the sun has been
dealt with in this flood of proposed law
making Xot only the questions dealt
with by the President in his message but
all those that have over come into public
notice by any chance and hundreds that
nobody but their authors ever dreamed of
have been brought to the front by the
introduction of the numberless bills thst
the clerks are now sitting up at night to
Index The statutes of the United Stoles
would be a most marvelous combination
If Congress should take it into its head
to enact into laws all the propositions
that have been presented since the bars
were let down yesterday
fn addition to this all the measures
that died in the last Congress have been
resurrected and a new crop cultivated
The Tanks have come to the front more
numeroubly than eier before A reading
of the titles of the bills that rained upon
the desk of the Secretary of the Sonate
yesterday would indicate that a large por
tion of the American people are jokers
and that their representatives in Wash
ington are willing to advertise and apply
their Jokes
Imnienxits of Proposed IprtMliitlnii
If these bills should be passed every
important matter In which the United
States is interested will be regelated by
statute and every unimportant one 33
well There will not be paper enough in
the Unlled States to print the laws upon
and not enough human beings to execute
them
As an illustration of how the minds of
statesmen differ as to great questions at
tention Is called to the bill of Represent
ative Wachter of Man land thit the Gov
ernment shall prohibit any further foot
tall games between the Wcs Point and
Annapolis cadets and that of Represent
ative Metcalf of California providing that
there should be an annual competition
game between the soldier and sailor boys
and that all of them shall take place In
Waehincton
It Is probable that the first subject to
be seriously discussed after the isthmian
canal treaty shall have been ratified by
tb tojirt M the legislation contained in
a bill tbiroSW yesterday by Senator
i MaWORY FOOD
A 1 a W i Te Memory AVnm
Mrn J Grnpc N iit
Food that will actually help the mem
ory as well as agree perfectly with a deli
cate stomach Is worth knowing of
A good wife out in Alta loua who did
not know which way to turn to get food
that would agree with her husband who
was left in a weakened condition after a
serious illness and could scarcely retain
any food in hln stomach was one day in
duced to try him on Crape Nuts the fa
mous ready cooked breakfast food and
from the first he began to Improve rapid
ly In three months he had gained thirty
pounds
She say that his stomach has recover
ed so completely that he can now eat any
kind of food
She mentions the boy of an intimate ac
quaintance who was so delicate and thin
that his appearance was pitiable and he
had no appetite for any ordinary food He
was put on tJrape Nuts and liked the
crlspnefs and sweetish taste of tho new
food and took to it Ills Improvement be
gan at once and be is now a healthy
plump boy
I know that Crape Nuts will do more
for weak stomachs than any medicine
The claim that It will build up and
strengthen the brain has been proven to
my certain knowledge Sister who writes
for the press and is compelled to memor
ize a great deal has been using Crape
Nuts and says she Ic surprised at the re
sult There is a marked Improvement
in her memory and the brain works more
perfectly and with better results
Please do not publish my name
Name can be given by the lostum Cereal
Company Ltd Dattle Creek Michigan
Lodge to provide the means of raising
revenue for the Philippine Islands A I
similar bill will be introduced In me
House on Friday and it is hoped that
there will be no llsposlticn en the part
of the Democrats or anybody else to op
pose their passage
Thche hills were drawn after consulta
tion with Scr ctary Root It is thought
by the Administration and the Repub
licans of the Senate and House that
everybody will appreciate the Intolerable
conditions existing in the Philippines
growing out of Mondays decision of the
Supreme Court and will allow the pro
poses temporary adjustment of the insu
lar taitr to be macted without forcing a
general tariff debate
At present the Democrats show no dis
position to obstruct the passage of this
emergency measure by political talk for
which there will be ample opportunity
when the hill that Is now being framed
at the War Department presenting a gen
eral scheme of territorial government for
the Philippines shall come up for discus
sion
llritnrtliin In War Inv
It 1ms prnctlcally been decided by those
who control matters In the Senate and
House that ro bill for the reduction of
the war revenue taxes shall be brought
forward at present The argument In
favor of delay is that while it Is easy at
this time perhaps to make a fairly accu
rate estimate of what the surplus -will be
for the next year or two no living man
possesses the power to fix the amount of
the expenditures
It Is reasonably certain that a river and
harbor bill of some kind will be passed
The chances are that provision will be
made for the beginning of the construc
tion of the Nicaragua Canal and for tho
payment of a ship subsidy
If this Is done there will be no surplus
to worry about Ihe old heads of tbe
Capitol are therefore advising that it
would be better to Ilay framing a tax re
duction measure until it can be deter
mined in a general way at least how
much money there is to get rid of Mem
bers of the Finance and Wajs and Means
Committees say that whatever is done It

There -will be no legislation for Cuba
at least until an independent government
shall have been established there It is
stU Tery much an open question what
will bo done after thit is accomplished
After Congress shall have reassembled
in January the committees will get to
work in earnest and then It will be pos
sible for those in charge of legislation to
outline with approximate accuracy about
what can be done In the direction of car
rying out the recommendations of the
President and his Cabinet officers At
present except as to the matters above

A number of the doorkeepers of the
House have been replaced by pages
Formerly there were four doorkeepers
stationed at each door and they carried

on the floor Objection was made to men
performing this duty which was thought
to be more fitting for boye Two messen

Goulds stricturesirjn the smallncss of tho
l specimen submitted by the witness It
measured about three fourths or an men
In length The doctor said that the mi
croscopic test of a thread was as val
uable as using the whole piece from
which it was taken He used the micro
scope mom to develop the existence ot
dried blood than the quantity of it
Doctor asked Mr Gould supposing
all the blood had boon washed out of the
garment could you have dlscov ered traces
of blood
Certainly not
Dr Ruffln Tcfused to determine the ago
of any of tho tdood stains
ilr Goulds next question was a hypo
thetical one
We will suppose the velvet collar had
been clutched by a blooJy hand In such
an Instance would tho blood have pene
trated to tho lining
I think It would replied the witness
retiring
The Uxnmlnntlon In Jnll
Dr Shute who has been cneaged In tho
practice of modicinc for fourteen years
and Is tho visiting physician at the jail
examined Mrs Bonina immediately after
she was brought to that institution Ho
said he found numerous bruises on her
lower limbs as well as scratches on her
hands which appeared to him to have
been made by finger nails When asked
his opinion as to the manner in which
the bruises wrre received ho said
In a struggle I think that Is the most
probablo explanation of their presence
All through the cxaml atlon of Dr
Shute Mr Gould constantly confronted
him with the testimony tbe physician had
offered relative to this subject betore the
grand jury From the doctors evidence
it seemed as though ho has had a change
of mind regarding this matter since his
first examination of Mrs Bonlne
You of course knew of this struggle
doctor interrogated tho District Attor
ney prior to our examination Did you
not read about it in the daily papers
The -witness admitted he had He said
that from the position of tho bruises on
Ler limbs he could not accept them as
tnc lesult of falling on a flat surface
Iorner Tenllsaouy Recalled
Let us look Into the testimony you
gave before the grand jury observed Mr
Gould Is not this your answer to a
question as to the bruises
Mr Gould then quoted as follows
From the way she spoke of her struggle
with Ayres I do not consider It a satis
factory explanation of the bruises
Oh I have changed my opinion since
them returned the doctor coolly
Then it is simply a mental operation
with you broke In Mr Gould
Dr Shute pronounced the whole affair
bafPing and mysterious
It has gotten down to a matter of
theory with you Is that it -was asked
The witness said yes He didnt know
whether it was possible for a man to in
flict the bruise- nhlie holding a pistol In
his hand
Mr Gou i ute if the bruises
could pr i a cd In making
her cse i Dr Shute
was nho er r ususs said
J juirJWr r una u 1ar that
question
Hell get hte id c I r
laughed Mr Gould
If the Government r d n
sure we wont retorted ei -
Dr Shute said ho found Mi -
fragile anaemic creature wit
easily bruised He had failed to fln i
bruises about her head or particles
powder In her hair
Have you ever talked with Mr Gould
or Mr Taggart about this case enquired
Mr Douglass
Mr Gould thought he saw an opening
and lost no time in taking advantage of
It Did you ever converse with Mrs
Bonlne on the topic he asked
Not about the case declared the wit
ness except when I made my examina
tion of her
3LitirUr llmilnr Testifies
The air of belligerency displayed by tho
opposing lawyers In their examination of
Dr Fry again came to the surface when
the last witness was put on the stand
When the clerk called the name of Mau
rice Gerald Bonlno a hush fell en the
crowded court room and everyone lean
ed forward with an air of expectancy
thinking sonic sensational testimony
would be given by the son of the woman
whose fate depends on the twelve men
who were to listen to him Maurice Bo
nlne was sixteen last month but his at
titude is that of profound senousners
more In keeping with tine twice his years
The full rosy face oi the boy was very
solemn as he mounted the stand and ho
kept ills wistful brow j eyes obscured by
gasses fixed on hif mother during the
whole course of his testimony Ho an
swered all the questions propounded to
him promptly and without a sbado of ner
vousness He said up to last May he had
resided at the Kcnmore for tho past two
and a half years except when he went
away for the summer He with his parents
and urothcr Chcslelgh occupied rooms CD
and 70 in the Kenmore Anncv the boys
sleeping in number 70 When asked as to
how ho spent his time at night he said
Chcslelgh and I used to study In our
rooms in the evening with mama v ho as
sisted us
I object to all this said Mr Gould
scornfully
1 think we ought to be allowed pro
tested Mr Fuiion to show the care and
devotion Mrs Bonlne mtve her boys This
is especially pertinent in view of the rela
tions she is alleged to have sustained with
mother
llr Coiilils Objection biiotiiliin
There Is no issue here exclaimed
Judge Anderson testily- The Govern
ment lias not charged the defendant with
any neglect of her children The objec
tion is sustained
Youug MauritQ then told of his move
ments the night of tbe shooting After
visiting a friend in the neighborhood he
went to his room -about eleven oclock and
vveul to bed His mother tame In a few
miuutes later and prepared to do the
same 1 was lying in bed said Maurice
and saw my mplliorj moving around in
hor nightgown
This seemed toj arouse Mr Goulds ire
This 3ias gons fir enough lie ejacu

room knows what tho1 object of this tes
timony Is 1 I
What Is the object demanded Mr
Douglasfi excitedly
1 wouldnt lusult the intelligence of

his face i llush as ho shook his finger at
the District Attorney
Continuing tho witness said he knew
that his mother retired at this time aud
she locked tho door of his room which
was the only cntrincc to the suite the
fauillv occupied
When Maurice was asked if he had
heard any noise that night he said he lud
but it whb before his mother went to bed
Ha left Hie stand and went to his moth

Meanwhile Hcfllin had gone to a side
window which he attempted to open The
light in the room had been extinguished
and he at last sueccedod in raising the

a bullet struck him in the abdomen and
he fell to the ground with a groan
Griinpliiif In the Unrk
A moment later tho front door was
opened and Marx -rushed upon Stitf who
was still endeavoring to break In the
door They grappled for a moment and
then Marx raised the pistol ho carried and
sent a bullet crashing Into the neck of his
antagonist
Shot TIiroiiKh the Henrt
Marx started on a run down the mad
but was headed off by Taylor who raised
his Winchester to his shoulder and was
about to pull the trigger when a third
shot from Marxs pistol penetrated his
heart He staggered for a moment and
then fell forward upon his rifle breaking
the stock lc his fall
Marx ran to the nearest housq and
summoned the neighbors with whom he
returned to his residence He told them
that he thought that burglars were try
ing to break Into the house and that he
opened fire on them
Medical Aid biiiiiinoneil
Dr William Washington was hurridly
summoned from Oak Grove and pending
his arrival the two Injured men were car
ried into the bouse and everything pos
sible was done to make them comfort
able Taylor who died almost instantly
was allowed to remain in the road where
he fell Marx worked with the neigh
bors In caring lor the injured and put the
resources of the house at their disposal
When Dr Washington arrived he
dressed the injuries as best he could with
the limited facilities He stated
however that the conditio if the men
was most serious and that It would be
necessary for them to be removed to some
place where they could receive proper
hospital treatment
The necessity for Immediate operations
was appreciated in both cases but because
of tbe absence of facilities there It was
decided that Washington was the most
suitable place to send the Injured men W
L Guttridge employed as a lumberman on
the place and who was one of Uig first to
reach the sceno of the tragedy was de
spatched to Wirts Wharf to arrange to
hold the steamer Wakefield until the
