Mr. Cleveland Presents His Views to
the Fifty-Third Congress in the
Usual Manner.
HIS FINANCIAL SCHEME
Principally an Endorsement of That
of the Secretary of the
Treasury.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Following is
the message of President Cleveland to
congress:
To the congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's leg
islative halls of those charged with the
duty of making laws for the benefit of a
generous and free people impressively sug
gests the exacting obligation and inexor
able responsibility involved in their task.
At the threshold of such labor now to be
undertaken by the congress of the United
States and in the discharge of an execu
tive duty enjoined by the constitution, I
submit this communication, containing a
brief statement of the condition of our na
tional affairs and recommending such leg
islation as seems to me necessary and ex
pedient.
OUR VOBBION RELATIONS.
.Advantages of a Firm Bnt Just Fonign
Policy Set Forth.
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations, and our peaceful relations
with them at this time additionally dem
onstrate the advantage of consistently ad
hering to a Arm but just foreign policy,
free from envious or ambitions national
schemes, and Characterized by entire hon
esty and sincerity.
Apart from the war in which the
empire is engaged Japan attracts increas
ing attention in this oountry by her evi
dent desire to cultivate more liberal inter
course with us and to seek our kindly aid
in furtherance of her laudable desire for
complete autonomy in her domestic Affairs
and fall equality iril the family of nations.
The Japanese empire of today is no longer
the Japan of the past and our relations
with this progressive nation should not be
less broad, and liberal than with other
Powers. v-?. A.y.
Good will fostered by many interests in
common has marked our relations with
our nearest Southern neighbors!

The president then details our dealings
with Brazil, Chili, France, Portugal,
Germany, touching upon the Behringsea
award, and recommending the appropria
tion of a sufficient sum to carry out its
provisions. The new government of Ha
waii has been recognized. Anew extradi
tion treaty with Italy is needed, hut efforts
in that direction have so far been unavail
ing.
The uprising in Bluetields at one time
promised serious results, but was satisfac
torily settled.

gdverameht with his bereaved family and
the Russian people.
Asa further demonstration of respect
and friendship our minister at St. Peters
burg was directed to represent our gov
ernment at the funeral ceremonies.
The sealing interests of Russia in Behr
ing sea are second, only to our own. A
modus vivehdi has therefore been con
cluded with the imperial government re
strictive of poaching on the Russian rook
eries and of sealing in waters which were
not comprehended in the protected area
defined in the Paris award.
The Samoan islands, over which Ger
many, England and America have a tri
partite protectorate, have been the scene
of considerable disturbances. The tri
partite agreement is not altogether satis
factory, and congress is asked to express
its judgment as to the propriety of steps
being taken by this government, looking
to the withdrawal from its engagements
with the other powers on some reasonable
terms not prejudicial to any of our exist
ing rights.
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
There Was
a
Deficit of Nearly Seventy
Millions the Past Year.
The secretary of the treasury reports the
receipts to this government frcm all
sources of revenue during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1884, amounted to $372,
802,498.29, and its expenditures to $442,605,
758.87, leaving a deficit of $69,803,260.58.
There was a decrease of $15,952,674.66 in
the ordinary expenses of the government
as compared With the fiscal year 1893.
There was collected from customs
$131,818,530.62, and from internal revenue
$147,168,449.70. The balance of the income
for the year, amounting to $93,615,517,97,
was derived from sales of lands and other
sources.
The values of our total dutiable imports
amounted to $275,199,086, being $146,647,
625 less than during the preceding year,
and the importations free of duty amount
ed to $399,705 530, being $64,748,675 less
than during the preceding year. The -re
ceipts from customs were $73,576,486.11 less
and from internal revenue $13,836,539.77
less than in 1888./
The total tax collected from distilled
spirits wis $85,259,250.35 on manufactured
tobacco $8,617,898.62, and on fermented
liquors $31,414,788.04.
Our exports of merchandise, domestic
and foreign, amounted during the year to
$892,140,572, being an increase overthepre
ceding yeur.of $44 485,378.
ft Gold Exports. u"*1 \ij|
The total amount of gold exported dur
injg the fiscal year was $76,888,061, as
against $108,680,444 during the fiscal -year
1883.. The amount imported was $72,449,
119, as against $21,174,381 during the pre
vious year.
The imports of silver were $13,286,252,
and the exports were $50,451,265.
The total bounty paid upon the produc
tion of sugar in the United States for the
fiscal year was $12*100,208.89, being an in
crease of $2^725,077.01 over the payments
made during the preceding year^
It is estimated that upon the basis of our
present revenue law* the receipts' of the
government during the fiscal year ending
June 30,1885, will be $424,427,748.44, and its
expenditures $444,427,748.44, resulting in a
deficit of $20,000,000.- -f.

resources^ of the banks at the date men
tioned amounted to $3,473,922,055 ah
against $3,109,563,284 in 1893.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
No Present Neoeasity For Inereaslnv*th«
Army—Coast Fortifications.
From the report of the secretary of war
it appears that the strength of the army
on Sept. 30,1884, was 2,135 officers and
25,765 enlisted men.
Although this is apparently a very slight
.decrease compared with the previous year,
the actual effective force has been in
creased to the equivalent of nearly two
regiments through the reorganization ol
the system of recruiting, and the conse
quent release to regimental duty of the
large force of men hitherto serving at the
recruiting depots. The abolition of these
depots, it is predicted, will furthermore
effect an annual reduction approximating
$250,000 in direct expenditures, besides
promoting generally the health, morals
uid discipline of the troops.
Small Ports Abandoned* $ff
The execution of the policy of concen
trating the army at important centers ot
population and transportation, foreshad
owed in the last annual report of the sec
retary, has resulted in the abandonment
of 15 of the smaller, posts, whioh: was ef
fected under a plan- which assembles or
ganizj tio a of the same regiments hitherto
widely separated.: This renders our small
forces more readily effective for any serv
ice which they be called upon to jterform
increases the extent1of the territory under
protection without diminishing the secur1
ity heretofore afforded to any locality, im
proves the discipline, 'training atod esprit
de corps of the army, besides considerably
decreasing the cost of its maintenance.'
Though the forces of the department of
the East have been somewhat increased,
more than three-fourths' of the army is
still stationed west of the MissisSippt
While the maximum legal strength of
tte ianuv. 4s 25,000. men, the ... effective
'•at.r«ii^lK -{c^ Various dalue^ is but little
over 20,000 men,' The ptirpose of congraw
•does noti therefore, seein to rhr fully Vt
.tainad by thw wrist,ing wmiMMftn Whtla"
no considerable incntese in the irmy is. In
my judgmi
•«f
the policy of sea coast fortification, in the
prosecution of which we .have steadily en
gaged for some years, has so far devel
oped as to suggest that the effective
strength of the army be now made at
least equal-to the legal strength. Measures'
taken by the department during the year,
as-indicated,v have already considerably
augmented the effective force, and the
secretary of war presents a plan which I
recommend to the consideration of con
gress to attain the desired end.
Three Battalion Formation.
Economies effected in the department in
other lines of its work will offset to a
great extent the expenditure involved in
the proposition submitted. Among other
things this contemplates the adoption of
the three battalion formation of regiments
which for several years has been indorsed
by the secretaries of war and the generals
commanding the army.
An Allusion to Interior Disturbance*.
It is hardly necessary to recall the fact
that in obedience to the commands of the
constitution and the laws, and for the
purpose of protecting property of the
United States, aiding the process of the
federal courts, and removing lawless ob
structions to the performance by the gov
ernment of its legitimate functions, it be
came necessary in various localities dur
ing the present year to employ a consider
able portion of the regular troops. The
duty was discharged promptly, courage
ously, and'with marked discretion by the
officers and men, and the most gratifying
proof was thus afforded that the army de
serves that complete confidence in. its effi
ciency and discipline which the country
has at all times manifested.
The year has been free from disturb
ances by Indians and the chances of fur
ther depredations on their part are con
stantly becoming more remote and im
probable.
Coast Armament.
The skill and industry of our ordnance
officers and inventors have, it is believed,
overcome the mechanical obstacles which
have heretofore delayed the armament of
our coasts, and this great national under
taking upon which we have entered may
now proceed as rapidly as congress shall
determine. With a supply of finished
guns of large calibre already on hand, to
which addition should now rapidly follow,
the wisdom of providing carriages and
emplacements for their mount can not be
too strongly urged.
The total enrollment of the militia of
the several states is 117,533 officers and en
listed men, an increase of 5,346 over the
number reported at the close of the pre
vious year.
An Honor For Schofield.
In recognition of the long and distin
guished military services and faithful dis
charge of delicate and.' responsible civil
duties by Major General John M. Scho
field, now the general commanding the
army, it is suggested to congress that the
temporary revival of the grade of lieuten
ant general in his behalf would be a just
and gracious act, and would permit his re
tirement, now near at hand, with rank be
fitting his merits.
THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT.
More Judges for Circuit Courts of Ap
peal Recommended.
The report of the attorney general notes
the gratifying progress made by the su
preme court in overcoming the arrears of
its business and reaching a condition In
which it will be. able to dispose of cases as
they arise without any unreasonable de*
lay. This result is, of course, very largely
due to the successful working of the plan
inaugurating circuit courts of appeals. In
regard to these tribunals, the suggestion
is m: le, in quarters entitled to the high
est consideration, that an additional judge
for each circuit would greatly strengthen
these courts and'the confidence reposed in
their adjudications, and that such addi
tion would not create a greater force of
judges than the increasing busines of such
courts requires. I commend the sugges
tion to the careful consideration of con
gress.
Other Important Topics.
Other important topics are adverted to
in the report accompanied by recommend
ations, many of which have been treated
at large in previous messages, and at thip
time therefore need only be named. I re
fer to the abolition of the fee system as a
measure of compensation to federal offi
cers the enlargement of the powers of
United States commissioners, at least in
the territories, the allowance of writs of
error in criminal cases. on behalf of the
United States and the establishing of
degrees in the crime of murder. The es
tablishment of-a federal court in the In
dian Territory is also strongly recom
mended.
Another subject of pressing moment re
ferred to by the attorney general is the re
organization of the Union Pacific Railway
company on a basis equitable as regards
all private interests and as favorable to
the government as existing conditions will
permit. The operation of a railroad by
court through a receiver is an anomalous
state of things which should be termin
ated, on all grounds public and private, at
the earliest possible moment.
Federal Prisons. ,j:f
Eight years ago, in my annual message,
I urged upon congress a% strongly as I
could the location and construction of two
prisons for the confinement of U. S. pris
oners. A similar recommendation has
been made from time to time since, and a
few years ago a law was passed providing
for the selection of sites for three such in
stitutions. No appropriation has how
ever been made to carry the act into effect,
and the old and discreditable condition
still exists. -.,
UNITED STATES MAILS.'
Strong Recommendation For Revising
Laws Regarding Second Class Matter.
The report of the postmaster general pre
sents a comprehensive statement of the
operations of the postoffice department for
the last fiscal year.
The receipts of the department during
the year amounted to $75,080 478.04 and the
expenditures to $84,324,415.15.
The transactions of the postal service'
indicate with barometric certainty :the
fluctuations in the business of the country.
Inasmuch, therefore, as business compli
cations continue to'exist throughout the
last year to an unforseen extent, it is not
surprising that the deficiency of rovenue
to meet the expenditures of the postoffice
department, which was estimated in ad
vance at about .$8,000,000, should.be ex
ceeded by nearly $1,250,000 dollan."
The Deficiency Unnecessary. ^.
The postmaster general states that this
deficiency is unnecessary and might be ob
viated at once if the law regulating rates
upon mail matter of the second class was
modified/ The rate: received for the 'trans
missibn of this second class mattir is 1
cent& per pound while the cost of trans
misaian to tiie government is eight times
that amount. In the general terms of the
law tfeis ig$e oovers gewspapei? ud peri­
S9sSll$S
-'i'
odicals. The extensions of the meaning
.of these terms from time to time have ad
mitted to the privilegestatended for legiti
mate newspapers and periodicals a
^. Surprising Range of Publications
and created abuses,, the cost of which
amount in the aggregate to' the deficiency
of the postoffice department. Pretended
newspapers are started by business houses
for the mere-purpose of advertising goods,
complying with the law in formality and
discontinuing the publications as soon as
the period of advertising is over. "Sample
copies" of pretended newspapers are is
sued in great numbers for a like purpose
only. The result is a great loss to
the government, besides its humiliating
use as an agency to aid in carrying out the
scheme of a business house to advertise
its goods by means of a trick upon both
its rival houses and the regular and legiti
mate newspapers.
Paper Covered Literature,
consisting mainly of trashy novels, to the
extent of many thousand tons, is sent
through the mails at one cent per pound,
while the publishers of standard works
are required to pay eight times that
amount in sending their publications.
Another abuse consists in the free car
riage through the mails of hundreds of
tons of seed and grain uselessly distribu
ted through the department of agricul
ture. The postmaster general predicts
that if the law be so amended as
to eradicate these abuses, not only will
the postoffice departments show no defic
iency, but he believes that in the near
future all legitimate newspapers and
periodical magazines might be properly
transmitted through the mails to their
subscribers free of cost. I invite your
prompt consideration of this subject, MI«|
fully indorse the views of the postmaster
general.
The total number of postoffices in the
United States on the 30th day of June,
1884, was 69,805, an increase of 1,043 over
the preceding year. Of these 3,426 were
presidential, an inolrease in that class of 68
over the preceding year.
Six hundred and ten cities and towns
are provided with free delivery. Ninety
three other cities and towns entitled to
this service under the law have not been
accorded it on account of insufficient
funds.
THE NAVY.
Secretary's Recommendation For New
Ships and Torpedo Boats Approved.
Attention is called to the report of the
secretary of the navy, which shows very
gratifying progress in the construction of
ships for our new navy. All the vessels
now building, including the three torpedo
boats authorized at the last session of
congress and excepting the first class bat
tleship Iowa, will probably be completed
during the ooming fiscal year.
The estimates for the increase of the
navy for the year ending June 30,1896, are
large, but they include practically the en
tire sum necessary to complete and equip
all new ships not now in commission, so
that unless new ships are authorized the
appropriations for the navy service for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1897, should fall
below the estimates for the coming year
by at least $12,000,000.
Recommends New Ships.
The secretary presents with much earn
estness a' plea for the authorization of
thieeadditional battleships, and ten,or
twelve torpedo boats. While the unarmed
vessels heretofore authorized, including
those now nearing completion, will con
stitute a fleet which it is believed is suffi
cient for ordinary cruising purposes in
time of peace. We have now completed and
inprocess of construction but four first
class battleships and but few torpedo
boats.. If we are to have at navy for war
like operations offensive and defensive,we
certainly ought to increase both the num
ber of battleships and torpedo boats. I
recommend that provision be made for the
construction of additional battleships and
torpedo boats.
The sacretary recommends the manu
facture not only of a reserve supply of
ordnance and ordnance material for ships
of the navy but also a supply for the
auxiliary fleet. Guns and their appurte
nances should be provided and kept on
hand for both these purposes. We have
not today a single gun that could be put
on the ships Paris or New York of the
International Navigation company, or any
other ship of our reserve navy.
The manufacture of guns at the Wash
ington navy yard is proceeding satisfactor
ily and none of our new ships will be re
quired to wait for their guns or ordnance
equipment.
Both the secretary of the navy and the
secretary of the treasury recommend the
transfer of the work of the coast survey
proper to the navy department. I heartily
concur in this recommendation.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
A Court For the Adjudication at
Contested Land Claims Desirable.
The report of the secretary of the in
terior exhibits the situation of the numer
ous and interesting branches of the public
service connected with his department. I
commend this report and the valuable
recommendations of the secretary to the
careful attention of the congress.
The public land disposed of during the
year amounted to 10,406,100.77 acres, in
cluding 28,876.03 of Indian lands.
It is estimated that the public domain
still remaining amounts to a little more
than 600,000,000 acres, excluding, however,
about 360,000,000 acres in Alaska, as well
as military reservations and railroad and
other selections of land as yet unjudicated.
The total cash receipts for the sale of
lands amounted to $2.674',285. T9, including
$91,981.03 received from the sale of TnHian
lands.,
Protection of Timber.
It appears that the appropriation for the
current year on account of special service
for the protection of the public lands and
the timber thereon is much less than
those for previous years and inadequate
for an efficient- performance of the work.
A larger sum of money than has been ap
propriated during a number of years past
on this account has been returned to the
government as a result of the labors of
those employed in the particular service
mentioned, and I hope it will not be crip
pled by insufficient appropriation.
I fully-endorse the recommendation of
the secretary that adequate protection be
proyided for our forest reserves and that a
comprehensive forestry system be inaugu
a
1
Contested. LandCases.- ,-'1^
An'exceedingly important recommenda
tion of the secretary relates to the manner
in which contests and litigated- cases,
growing out of efforts to obtain govern
ment land are determined. Theee cases,
which number.8,000 or 4|000 annually, are
sent' by theloc&l officers 'to the commis
sioner of the general lintd qffltafe fair his ac
tion. The exigencies of hla other duties
obHoe htm to act upon the decisions ot the
registers and reoeivers without an oppor
tnnltroithoroi
Nearly 2,000of these casesareappealed an
nually from the commissioner to the sec
retary of the interior. Burdened with
other important administrative duties his
determination of these appeals must be
almost perfunctory and based upon the.
examination of- others, though this deter
mination of the secretary operates as a:
final adjudication upon rights of very
great importance.
I concur in the opinion that the commis
sioner of the general land office should be
relieved from the duty of deciding liti
gated land cases, that a non-partisan court
should be created to pass on such cases
and that the decisions of this court shall
be final, at least so far as the decisions of
the department are now final.
Condition of Indians.
While the condition of the Indians
shows a steady and healthy progress,
their situation is not satisfactory at all
points.
I have always believed that allottments
of reservation lands to Indians in severalty
should be made sparingry, or at least
slowly and with utmost- caution.
In these days when white agricultur
ists and stockmen of experience and intel
ligence find their lot a hard one we ought
not to expect Indians, unless far advanced
in civilization and habits of industry to
support themselves on the small tracts of
land usually allotted to them.
I am convinced that the proper solution
of the Indian problem and the success of
every step taken in that direction depend
to a very large extent upon the intelligence
and honesty of the reservation agents and
the interest they have in their work.
The indications are that the detail of
army officers as Indian agents will result
in improved management on the reserva
tions.
In the light of experience, and consider
ing the uncertainty of the Indian situation
and its exigencies in the future, I am not
only disposed to be very cautious in mak
ing allotments, but I incline to agree with
the secretary of the interior in the opinion
that when allotments are made the bal
ance of reservation land remaining after
allotment, instead of being bought by the
government from the Indians and opened
for settlement with such scandals and un
fair practices as seem unavoidable, should
remain for a time at least as common land
or be sold by the government on behalf of
the Indians in an orderly way and at fixed
prices to be determined by its location
and desirability, and that the proceeds
less expenses should be held in trust for
the benefit of the Indian ppoprietors.
The intelligent Indian school manage
ment of the past year has been followed
by the most gratifying results.
As to Pensions.
At the close of the last fiscal year, on
the 30th day of June, 1864. there were
969,541 persons on our pension rolls, being
a net increase of 3,532 over the number re
ported at the end of the previous year.
These pensioners may be classed as fol
lows: Soldiers and sailors, survivors of
all wars, 753,968 widows and relatives of
deceased soldiers, 215,162 army nurses in
the war of the rebellion, 414. Of these
pensioners 32,039 are survivors of Indian
and all other wars prior to the late civil
war, and the widows and relatives of such
soldiers.
The remainder, numbering 937,505, are
receiving pensions on account of the war
of the rebellion, and the 469,344 are now
under the rolls under the authority of act
of June 27,1890,' sometimes called the de
pendent pension law. The total amount
expended for pensions during the year was
$130,804,461.05, leaving ah unexpended bal
ance from the sum appropriated of $25,•
205,712.65. The snm neoeasary to mee6
pension expenditures for the year ending
June 20,1896, is estimated at $140,000,000.
Should Soon Reach the Limit.
The commissioner of pensions is of the
opinion that the year 1895 being the 30th
after the close of the war of the rebellion
must, acording to all sensible human cal
culation, seethe highest limit of the pen
sion roll, anTr after a year it must begin to
decline.
The claims pending in the bureau have
increased more than 90,000 during the
year. A large proportion of the new claims
filed are for increase of pension by those
now on the rolls.
The number of certificates issued was
80,213.
The names dropped from the rolls for all
causeaduring the year numbered 37,951.
Among our pensioners are 9 widows and
3 daughters of soldiers of the Revolution
and 45 survivors of the war of 1812.
Purgation Was Necessary.
irH
The barefaced and extensive pension
frauds exposed under the direction oi the ^,
courageous and generous veteran soldier
now at the head of the bureau leave no
room for the claim that no purgation of rj
our pension rolls w£s needed or that con
tinued vigilance and prompt action are
not necessary to the same end.
The accusation that an effort to detect
