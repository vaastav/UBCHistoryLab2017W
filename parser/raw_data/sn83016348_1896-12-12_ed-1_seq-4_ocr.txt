ELKTON, MD., DECEMBER 12, 1896.
Vr to date 110 Republican statesmen
throughout our beloved land are reported
to have a sure thing on the eight Seats in ,
Mr. McKinley’s Cabinet.
Mr. Hanna is now in a position tn
realize the size of the white elephant lie
has on his hands, in the shape of an
obstinate and obstructive Congress.
. _ o -
Tin; professional nim-mtiis ami Christ
mas pood will of journalism, are forcibly
illustrated in Louisiana, where one editor
lias just shot another oin to de ;h on tin'
street.
Mn. Wji. Jknmxos liIiYAN will not
lecture at Knston, Md., htc.un hi- mana
gers exact three fourths of the hall receipts,
which must amount to at- least y ~00(1.on.
That class of eloquence is too high priced
tor the Eastern Shore. Major Hilly Stewart
is fully competent to take Mr. Bryan's
place.
StxATolt ' n rv expresses himself as
opposed to any more millionaires and husi
men in the Senate.
What we need in the Senate worse than i
any thing else about this time are brains
anil honesty.
It a Senator has these, wealth “is no
objection to him.”
Without them, money cannot justify ins
presence in that body.
Mr. Bayard has declined to receive a
Christmas gift from the English people
made up by popular shilling contributions
as projected by the London Telegraph.
This whole transaction is a mortifying
episode in the career of our Embassador at
■the Court of St. James, and the one great
pity is, that Mr. Bayard did not hurry to
decline this penny-in-the-slot-contribution,
when it was lirst suggested by the Tele
graph.
Mr. Bayard has so continuously gushed
and slushed, over the English aristocracy,
and in at least two speeches—one at Bos
ton, and the other at Edinburgh, has not
spared harsh criticism of his own country
men, that the mortification of the hour is
really the looked for result of his own ex
cessive Anglomanias!)).
Bkcausk we have enough trouble with
the ignoramuses already in the country
we want no more illiterate immigrants
dumped upon us by foreign steamship
lines.
Year by year the tide of immigration lias
■ become swoolcn, until to-day it consti
tutes a menace to American habits of life.
The educational test is now before Con
gress in the shape ol the Eodgc-Corliss bill,
which provides, that every imigrant shall
he aide to read live lines of the lan
guage be speaks.
The bill ought to pass, because it aims
to exclude only those ignorant of their own
language, who have no occupation, and no
conception of American standard-, or Amer
ican institutions.
A SILVER BLOCKADE AGAIN.
The refusal of Senators Dubois, Mantle,
I’cttigrcw, Cannon and Squires to enter
the Republican caucus in the Coiled Stales
Senate, on Tuesday, virtually settles tin*
question whether any larilf or revenue
legislation is to lie passed at the present
session of Congress.
It leaves no room for doubt as to the fate
of the Dingley bill, even if the Republican
Senators in the caucus were more disposed
\than they are to give it an active support.
The action of the silver Senators shows I
that they are ready to renew the blockade
.in the last session against all financial lolls
which are not based on a concession to the
' Aver interest,
x Mte action of the silver Senators is also
Mirant of tiro extreme difficulty which
\be encountered in shaping tariff or]
W hills in the Fifty-fifth Congress, j
\shall hold together in their present j
\ the McKinley administration will
Vlent on the sound money Demo
te Senate for the legislative en- j
\ any policy which it may adopt
V to the silver interest.
j WOMEN BACHELORS VS. SPIN- !
STERS.
I
While women as a sex are undoubtedly |
rapidly advancing along all the lines of a
progressive and cultured civilization, yet ;
along with her evolution, are being devel
oped some affectations which the ill-natured
may properly term weaknesses.
The substitution of the title “Bachelor”
for that of “Spinster,”ns descriptive of un
married women, is one of the affectations to
which the uneducated ear has not yet grown
accustomed.
It is, of course, an advanced word, limi
ted as yet to the special circle of the Si
rosis or woman's Literary Club,and not yet
current in the rural districts.
But if sanctioned as a fashionable fad in
the city social centres,it will certainly soon
find place in the provincial vocabulary.
But whether the word Bachelor shall fi
nally supplant the familiar old title of Spin
ster or not in these evolutionary times, it is
noticeable at least, how obsolete the latter
word has grown.
()nce, properly applicable to the unmar
ried woman of tender as well as more ad
vanced years, its limited use is now by
common consent restricted to the special
class of females, who have not been connu
bially inclined, or to whom untoward cir
cumstance lias denied the blessing of ma
ternity.
We mourn the loss of the poetic old word
which associateswith it the romantic distaff,
and the winsome maiden at her wheel.
Indeed it has come to pass, that you risk
an affront in its use, which circles moat re
fined, not to say courtly, once fully sanc
tioned.
Only recently on the streets of Elkton, a
feminine “Bachelor” of no uncertain age,
insisted most vehemently that the term
Spinster was inapplicable to her. That it
was a term limited by time and usage to
her more experienced sisters.
As to the obsoleteness of tire word she
was correct, but she was no less a spinster,
because heiself a young unmarried female.
Commenting at once timely and perti
nently mi tills theme,at Exchange deplores '
the fact that the useful old word “Spinster” |
has fallen upen decadent days,few counten
ancing its use save in the marriage service,
nr on legal documents. People prefer in- j
stem! to t-ili: of women bachelors, which an
old Euclid would say, is an absurdity. This i
•dislike to a perfectly legitimate word show
a singular weakness on the part of women j
who are proclaiming tiicir strength. An
, I
tinmaTneil woman is u spinster whether ■
she calls herself "bachelor” or something i
else. This protest has been suggested In
an article in “Scribner’s Magazine,” writ- I
ten by Mary (lay Humphreys, and called]
“ W omen Bachelors in S' Vor k.” Save !
the exception of the lirst two words in the I
title, we have no quarrel with what is really j
an interesting paper. How very true are j
the following remarks: “Women used to
save; now they earn. Formerly when they
had to fa hard tb.ies they retrenched in
Servants, did their own work, cut down
the table, the fires, made their own clothes.
The literature of the last generation is
largely a history of small economies.
Women might go hungry, but their heads
were high, and their fingers were as blue
as their blood.”
Now, if losses come, women set about
earning money themselves rather than
relinquish any of life’s little luxuries,
Tlie New York woman, it seems, has a
wider knowledge of the world than her
Southern or Western sisters. Consequently,
when she has to earn her living she casts
about for something original instead of
confining herself to the old feminine ways.
HOW IT RETURNS TO PLAGUE
THEM.
Our readers will remember, that at the
opening of the last Congress, the Republi
can members of the Senate, not being in a
majority over both Democrats and Popu
lists, in order to control the chairmanships
of the different Senate Committees, and to
realize individually a larger share in the
distribution of Senatorial patronage, by an
agreement with the Populists, who held the
balance of power in that body, practically
surrendered the control of the Senate
Finance Committee.
While this agreement gave the Republi
can Senators the control of the organiza
tion of the committees, they assumed the
duties and responsibilities of a majority,
without possessing its power.
They were still in a minority, and arc
to-day practically unable to accomplish
any legislation in that body.
Referring to this anamolous condiuon of
affairs in the Senate, the Washington cor
respondent of the Philadelphia Ledger,
very pertinently says:
“It was an unwise move, which had only
as its basis the desire for the emoluments
am! perquisites of committee chairman
ships ami an increased share in the distri
bution of patronage in the Senate wing of
the Capitol. It was accomplished only by
the refusal of a number of Populist Sena
tors to vote, which gave to the Republicans

: an apparent majority upon the roll-call.
| The transaction was denounced as a deal at
i the time it was made, and Senator Clorman,
| in a vigorous speech, predicted " ith un
failing accuracy the embarrassments which
nominal but unreal power would entail
upon the Republican side of the Senate.
As a result, the fact that the Republicans
have been in an actual minority in the
Senate instead of in the majority, as their
control of the committees would indicate,
has been entirely unappreciated by the
general public, and all of the embarrass
ments predicted by the Democrats as the
resuit of the deal for patronage have been
fulfilled. The Diugley bill, passed by the
j House, came from the Senate Finance Com
mittee, with its Republican Chairman,
transformed into a bill for the free and
unlimited coinage of silver, all attempts to
pass revenue legislation at the last and
long session of Congress utterly failed, and
the Republican leaders are now forced to
admit that any similar attempts at the
present session will be quite as fruitless
and inconclusive. With the continuing
deficiency in the revenues and with such a
condition of affairs existing in Congress, an
extra session seems inevitable. It is the
appreciation of these facts which is respon
sible during the past week for the general
consent of prominent Republican Congress
men that President McKinley will be
forced to convene the Fifty-fifth Congress
in extraordinary session soon after the dis
solution of the present Congress on the Ith
of March next.
THE PRESIDE NT’S MESSAGE.
President Cleveland’s last message to
Congress was read in that body on Monday.
Although rather ponderous and Cleveland
esque in style, it is nevertheless an able
state paper, considered from the President’s
political standpoint.
The message opens with a congratula
tion to the country on the patriotic results
of the recent election, and the manly sub
mission of the defeated t< the pm ml w ver
dict. The Venezuelan question ha\ing ■ n ,
practically settled, the President's review*
■ foreign rehui
to Turkish and Cuban alTdrs. On the
latter, lie reveals the* fact lha: the Admin- '
istration has broached a j , m - :M ’i to
Spain in favor o? the concession of home
I nil • to tin* Cubans, and proll’eii the* friendly
I offices of this count.y ia securing that
] result.
I None but extreme free tie h-rs will agree
j with Mr. Cleveland in the opinion, that
I under normal business eoudii. ; the
j present tariff Dill will afford sufficient
I revenue for the country.
On the monetary question tin* IV ideal
I simply repeats what he h . often said b -
) fore in endorsing Mr. Carlisle’- proposi
j tion for the retirement *•! the gr< nine .
while he winds up his reference to economic
topics with the characteristic arraignment I
of trusts and monopolies, in which n
definite conclusion is reached beyond the -
suggestion that if Federal authority is
insufficient to deal with them, the several
States by their own laws should be aide to I
act effectively in the premises.
The other parts of the message are of
routine character, and outside of the Cuban
discussion, are not likely to make any par
ticular impression on either Congress or
the country at large.
Tours to California.
California hits been moat fittingly termed
the'Ttaly of America.’ 1 All the delicious balm,
the cloudless sky, and the rich verdure of the
great European peninsula are duplicated in
this sunny laud of the Pacific. Hero nature
basks in the sunshine of her own beauty: and
hero she has established her own sanitarium,
where eternal spring inspires everlasting
youth. With the snowmautled peaks of the
Sierras upon the one hand, the calm Pneifle
with its soft breezes upon the oilier, and a
veritable paradise of flowers, fruits, and
plants between, man can find and needs n<
lovelier laud. To visit such a country is a
privilege, a blessing.
The Pennsylvania Railroad ('ompany.recog
nizing the need of a more comfortable and
pleasant way of crossing the continent, in
augurated a series oi annual tours to Cali
fornia, running a through train of Pullman
palace cars from New Voi'k to the Pneifle
Coast, and stopping at the principal points of
interest en route. The great popularity of
these tours demonstrates the wisdom of the
movement.
For the season of 1897 three tours have been
arranged to leave New York, Philadelphia.
Pittsburg, January 27. February 2-1, and
March 27.
The first tom will run direct to Kan Diego
via St. Louis and the Santa Fe Rout' l , and re
turn from San Franci< * > via Salt Lake City,
Denver, and Chicago, allowing live we ks in

four weeks in California.
The third tour will run via Chicago,!)en\.>r, i

before tin! court of Appeals on Monday when
the Court adjourned until January sth, when
it is presumed a decision will be rendered.
When most needed it is not unusual for
your family physician to be away home.
Sm h was the experience of Mr. J. V. Schenck
editor of the Caddo, Ind. Ter., Banner, when
his little girl, two years of age was threatened
with a severe attack of croup. He says:
“My wife insisted that I go for the doctor,
but as our family physician was out of town
i I purchased a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy, which relieved her immediately. 1
will not be without it in the future.” 25 and
