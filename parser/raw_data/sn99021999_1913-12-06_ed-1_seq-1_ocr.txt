Threaten Violence.
LONDON, Dee. o.-The threat of the
militant suffragettes to resort to vlnln
methods of revenge for the arrest of their
leaner, jars. Emmciine Pankhurst, was
put Into effect this morning with the de
struction of a mansion at Wemyss bay,
Scotland; several attempts to destroy
letters by pouring acid Into mall boxes
here, and numerous Isolated cases of win
dow smashing. Moreover, It was slated
the women had a plan to do something
sensational within tho next twenty-four
hours and the police everywhere kept a
strict watch.
In the meantime Itrr. fnnkinir.f .
mained in Exeter Jail, the authorities not
having decided to remove her to Hollo,
way. She has already commenced a
"hunger strike."
Passengers on the Majestic, on which
Sirs. Pankhurst made the voyage, told
of the indignation of the travelers at
being detained for over an hour In Ply
mouth harbor In order to enable tho
police to outwit the suffragists, who
planned to rescue Mrs. Pankhurst. As
one American put It, "All this to arrest
one little woman."
The English press also Is inclined to
sneer at the elaborate police plans. The
Manchester Guardian remarks:
"There was an absurd disproportion be
tween the actual danger of disorder or
rescue and the plans of tho authorities."
The Westminster Gazette says:
"It Is absurd to describe the arrest of
Mrs. Pankhurst as a triumpTi for the

Hull Regards Monroe
Docrine as Menace
to the United States
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8. -An attack on
the Monroe doctrine as a worn out gar
ment which should be cast aside for an
International court, was made In an ad
dress here today before the American
Society for the Judicial Settlement of
International Disputes by William F.
Hull of gwarthmorc, Pa.
"Its consequences, present and future,
are appalling." said Mr. Hull. "Some of
Its past applications and the possibility
of its applications In the future have
done more than everything else to put
together, to alienate our neighbors. The
Latin-American view of the Monroe doc
trine Is greatly retarding our mutual
commerce and causing profound and
widespread International distrust."
He declared that this country had en
tangled Itself with Germany and Japan
because of Its "sensitiveness" over the
doctrine.
The Monroe doctrine, which was looked
on as the "sine qua non" of American
public policy. In the last century, Mr.
Hull asserted, was fast becoming the
Frankenstein monster which would
crush Ita creator. "This Is due," he con
tinued, "not only to the extraordinary
development of the orirfnal doctrine and
to Its illimitable possibilities of continu
ous growth accompanied by a great and
growing responsibility on the part of the
United States, and the remarkable
progress of Latin-America, but also to
the old world's changing attitude to
wards International rights and duties and
to the majestic International tribunal
slowly rising In the midst of sovereign
nations."
A solution, he thought, would be to
lot an International tribunal take care
of the problems this country alone Is
trying to handle.
Howard Tells of
the Collapse of One
Telephone Merger
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. S.-Tetlfylng
today in the suit of the government for
the dissolution of the American Tele
phone and Telegraph company, John A.
Howard of Wheeling. W. Va,, told of the
collapse of a plan to take over all Inde
pendent lines cast df the Rocky moun
tains. He was called by the government

ephone Company of New. Jersey to the
Bell ssytem whereby, ho said, competi
tion In northern New Jersey was wiped
out.
On cross-examination Mr. Howard said
tho Continental Telegraph and Telephone
company was organized to take over all
Independent companleseast of tho nock
lee, but went Into the hands of receivers.
At tho time of the collapse, he said, In
dependent telephone companies In West
Virginia, western Pennsylvania and east
ern Ohio h4 het'n merged Into thq Na
tional Telephoned corporation and ' were,
about -to-afflllau .with -tha-Contlnentai;
Howard then told of negotiations now
under way In which .It Is planned fw the
Bell -system to-take over the companies
In the" National Telephone corporation.
The taking of testimony-will be! resumed
In New Tork - next Wednesday.
Senate Democrats
Accuse Republicans
of Dilatory Tactics
WASHINGTON, Dec! C-Two hours' of
tatk In the senate today again prevented
action on the democratic resolution to
fix thlrtecn-hour-a-day sessions on the I
currency bill. j
Senator Bacon denied that there was i
any purpose to restrict debate or "ex- t
haust the senate," and Senator Williams 1
repeated that the object of the program i
was to make "the talkers talk early, talk
late and talk continuously, until the talk
ers are talked out"
"We will not prevent debate," he
shouted to the republicans. "Tou will get
your Btomachs full of ( debate. But, you
cannot make senators come here and
listen You cannot treat senators of the
United States, free, white and 21, like a
lot of school b6ys and say, 'Buddy,
here's your bench, sit on It."
"I believe thete is a purpose on tho
other side of the chamber," said Senator
James, "5 delay this bill. Business In
terests are held up while a lot of gentle
men on that side talk."
Senators Sutherland, Galllnger and
Smbot vigorously disclaimed any Inten
tion to delay.
All Des Moines
Saloons Reopened
DES MOINES, Deo. 6.-Every one of
Drs Moines' elghty-elx saloons opened to
day after having been closed since No
vember 22, as the result of a supreme
court decision to the effect that they
had been operating under an Insufficient
consent petition. The opening came to
day after Judge Preston of the supreme
court had granted a rehcarlnr in the
case and a stay of execution.
Contrary to expectations there were no
wild and riotous scenes when the doors
were unlocked. Valley Junction, a sub
urb, had been an oasis during the time,
the local saloons were out of business.
The anti-saloon leaders today applied
to Chief Justice Weaver to advance the
date of the rehearing for December SO.
Judge Weaver announced that he would
render his decision next Tuesday. Plans
are being made today to aeek an injunc
tion agalntt the saloon keepers, to pre
vent them from continuing business.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.-(6peclal Tele
gram.) "The proposition of traffic navi
gation on the Missouri river from Omaha
has a new lease of life," declared Mayor
DahlmAii of Omaha at the iRalelgh to
nlgljt. Mayor Dahlmnn wns Just starting
to tho National IHvers and Harbors con

president for Nebraska.' He Is convinced
that Omalia can make practical and prof
itable the establishment of water traffic,
It the proper steps are taken.
"I am going to take the matter up
with the Commercial club upon my re
turn," said Mayor Dahlman. "From what
1 have heard at the Rivers and Harbors
congress I am convinced that conditions
on the Missouri river at Omaha are bet
ter than those that existed In other
places which have made river navigation
successful, I have in mind especially
the use of bargs of an Improved type,
experiments in which have been made
by the government,
"An Alabama delegate to the conven
tion proved it to me by his recital of
what had been done with these barges
In his own state. There is no reason why
Omaha cannot do the same thing, and it
will b a simpler proposition there than
it was in Alabama.
"Terminals are what must be provided
at the outset They are the backbone of
all governmental aid to Improved navi
gation and army officers will not listen
to arguments for appropriations for
channel Improvements until the localities
to be benefited moke a convincing show
ing on the terminal facilities which they
must provide at their own expense."

promises to bo an Important factor In
deliberations of the republican national
committee hero December 10. Mony be
Hove congress may provide primaries
that will do away with the need of any
nominating, conventions before 'tho next
presidential election.
It wan pointed out today that It a di
rect primary law were passed before the
191, elections, the neod for a change of
republican representation would disap
pear.
) Senator Jones, a momber of the taw
committee, returned to Washington to-
day and said plans wero going .forward
for a national convention.
"I am In favor of some form of direct
primary." he said. "One plan that ap-(
pears to be sound would . provide for dl
rcct( primaries In the states, with na
tional conventions In which delegates
would sit In proportion to the vote In
the states. Each state would apportion
Its delegates according to the strength
bf the respective party candidates, and
XUe national convention would make the
final choice."
' Senator Cummins, one of the most act
lvo advocates of tules revision and chair
inan of the conciliation committee ap
pointed In Chicago last spring, declared
jtoday that discussion of presidential prl
.marles should not Interfere with hold

"I am strongly In favor of direct pri
maries," he said, "but there Is no as
surance that the direct primary laws
:vtfll bo passed, or at least that they will
not bo long delayed. It la our duty to
