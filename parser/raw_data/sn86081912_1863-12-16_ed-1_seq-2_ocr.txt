Extract from the President's Message*
assembtcd a year -ago the*
war had already lasted nearly twenty mouth#,'
and tlno had been many c<>iiLl;ct4 on b'tU :
kitiu and stHv, aiih rar., tng r€uli. There-,
helln :i ha 1 hi n pitied baeic into reduced
n.it -. ye' Hhe fonc of j.ublie f- cling and opitftj
ion, at home and abroad, waa not satisfac- j
tory.
With other signs, the popular elections, '
then .just passed, indicated uneasiness among
. ana nienacing, the kindest words coming i
!
from Europe were uttered in accents of pity :
—that we were too blind to surrender a
hopeless cause. Our commerce was suffering
b v a* few 'arni™'i v---l- built upon 1
and furnished from foreign shores, anil we !
'were tbrtatened with such additions Trotn j
tlie fame quarter r.s trriuld sweep our trade
from Ib.e sea and raise our blockade. We
l.al failed to elicit from the European Gov
: einments anything hopeful upon the subject. :
The preliminary Etrtancipafr'n Pmcfsma- '
lion which was issued in September, was
i ;
running its assigned period to the beginning
of the new year. A mouth later the final
, proclamation came, including the announce
ment that colored men of suitable condition j
; would be received into the war'service.
! The policy of emancipation and of employ
• ing black soldiers gave to th'e future a new
aspect, about which hope an 1 fear and doubt
; contended in uncertain conflict.
According to our political system, as a i
nutter of civil administration, the General j
1 Government had no lawful power to effect !
• emancipation in any State, and for a long
; (.ire it had been hoped that the rebellion _
could be suppressed, without resort;rg to it as'
a ijiiiiury mea-ure.
j It was all the while dccuted possible that
i the for it might come,.and that if it ■
. shouid, Uic crui- of ihe contest would then ,
[be presented. - It came, and as was portend
ed it .vas followed by dark and doubtful
I tot • .
J'Tlcven raonths having now passed, we are
permitted to take another review. The ivbel
borders ore. pres-ed still further hack, and by 1
, the complete opening of the- Mia-isipppi river,
(be couutry douiinatt-d by the rebellion is cli- j
vided into distant parts, with no practical _
i c lUimumcation between tliern. Tennessee
and Arkansas have been substantially cleared j
of insurgent control and inlluen.ee, and the ,
1 citizens in each, owners of slaves and advo
eatos of sluvejy at the beginning o! the re
be'.lion, now e'tclare epcn!y lor emancipation
in their ivspeciave .Siate*. Ut those Slates
not included in the .Emancipation Proclama
tion, Maryland and Missouri, aeitln i of which,
three years ago, would tokrate any restraint
i upon the extension of slavery into new ier
i ritories, only dispute now as the best mode
' of removing it within their own limits.
Of those who were slaves at the beginning
of the rebellion, full one hundred t<iou.*and are
now in the United Etates military service
about one-half of which number actually
'tear aruii in the rank*, thus giving the
double advantage of taking so much labor
| from the insurgent cause, and supplying the
r dacas, which othcrwi-e must be filled with
so many whi'e tncn.- So far as tested it is
! drtiicult to sny that they are n,.t as good
soldiers as any. Nu set vile insurrection or
; tendency to violence or cruelty has toaiked
the measures of -einancipation, and ai inieg
i tl.e blacks. Those measures have been much
bscussed in foreign cour.irirs, and cotempo.
nvry with such discussi' ns the tone of public
sentiment there is much improved. At home :
the same un-asnr-ii have been fully discus-ed,
supported, criticised, and denounced ; so.d
the ar.ual elections following are highly cn
dfouragiwg to those wh se official duty it is to
r.ear tt.e odintry through this great trial-
Thus we have the new reckoning. The
! (-rsn which threat owed to divide the lriends
1 of the Union is past.
banking now to the present and foture,
and with rtf> rouse to a ro*unip r ion of the na
fional antlwrityt wuhin the State* wherein
1* thrit authority has b en suspended, I have
j tli -light fit to issue a proclatß* lion, a copy of
! wbieh is herewith transmitted. On exami
nation of thi-s prf'clattlatioii it wilt appear, as
| is bt luvtd. that nothing is attempted beyond
! v.? At ;s anijih*'jitsttfiod by the Pcnatttution.
True, the form of an oath is given, bnr no
I man is cuescid to titke it; A'tnan is'only
' pTir,*sed"n pnrdon in case be voluntarily
tnho- 'bo oafh. The ConstituthM auMiorfre*
the Exicu'.lve to grant or wi.hhobl the pr.r
don at bis tiwn absolute discretion, and th'.e
i icbidee the power to grant on suoli tenrrs as
is fully ekhVblished by judicial and other au
thorities.
It is also proffered lint if, "in any'of the
Cfsf? -" named., n State of G iverfiment shall
j be, in the mode prescribed, set up, such G v
i eritth' i.t shall be recognized and guaranteed
!>v the Uni'e;! States and that un hr it the
j Sta'c khall. c.u the constitutional conditions,
; lie protected against invasion and domestic
- violence."
The constitutional obligation of the flitted
i Slates to guarantee U> every State in the Ln
j ion a form of government, and to
j prefect the.State in the cases stated, is ex*
I pltci t and full. But why tender the ben; fits
1 of this provision onlv to a State (government,
set up in this-p;u ticulur way? This section
of thq Constitution contemplates *a case
wherein ihf tekaient wuhin a.State, favorable
; to a republican form of government- ia the
Union, may U' too feeble for an opposite and
hostile element, extoiuaf to, and even within,
the State ; tiid such are precisely the ea e es
with which we are now dealing.
An attempt lo guarantee and protect a re
vised State Goveinuiynt, c .intruded in whole
ot in preponderating part from the vory eltv
inent against whtiae hostility ml - violence i (
is to be ; reiected, is simply absurd. There
must be n teat by which to separate tlie op
posing elements, so as to boild only from the
sound ; and that test is a sufficiently liberal
which accepts as sound whoever will make owe
, a sworn recantation of bis former unon d
• i;C RS . . I
But if it bo proper to require, as a test of j
i of admission to tiie political body, an oath j
to the Constitution of the U tile 1 j
' States, and to tho Union under it, why not '
I! also to tha laws and in regard '
to slavery ? Those laws and proclamations
were enacted and put forth for the purpose of
j tiding in ilie suppression of the rebellion—
lV> give them their fnlleßt. effect there had to
'be a pledge for their maintenance. In my
judgment they have aided, and will further ,
aid, the cause for which they were enlisted,
i To give up this principle would be not only
! to relinquish a lever of power, but would also j
be a cruel and astounding breach of faith. I
may add at this point that while I remain in
1 my present position, I shall not attempt to
| repeal or modify the Emancipation Proclama
j tiun.
Nor shall I return to slavery any peron
who is free by the terms of the Proclamation
or bv any act n< t of Congress.
For these and other reasons it it thought
best that the support of these measures shall
be included in the na'h, and it is believed
the Executive may lawfully claim it in return
for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights
which he has clear constitutional power to
j withhold altogether or grant upon the terms
; which he shall deem wisest for the public in
-1 tercst.
It should le observed, also, that this part
' of the oath is subject to the modifying and
i abrogating power of legislative and supreme
I judicial decision.
The proposed acquiescence of the National
Executive in any reasonable temporary State
arrangement for the freed people, is made
with the view of possibly modifying and ab
' rogatiug the confusion and destitution which
must at best attend all classes by a total revo.
; lotion of labor throughout whole States. It
is hopjjJ that the already deep'y afflicted peo
| pie in those States may be somewhat tuple
ready to give up the cause of their affliction,
if, to this extent, this vita! matter be loft to
j themselves, while no power of the National
Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by
1 the proposition.
Toe suggestion in the proclamation ns to
maintaining tho political framework of the
j States on what is called reconstruction, is
made in the hope thst it may do good with
out the danger of harm. It will save labor
. and avoid g r eat confusion.
But why any proclamation now upon tins
S sulject? This question is beset by the con
flicting views tha the step might be delayed
< too long or be taken too soon. In some States
i the clernencs of resumption seem ready for ac
! tien, but remain inactive apparently for want
|of a rallying point—a plan of action,
i \\ hy shail A adopt the plan of B rather
| than B that of A ? And if A anil B should
j agree, how can they know but that ihe Gen
| eral Government litre will reject their plan ?
j By the proclamation a plan is presented
which may be accepted by them as a rallying
point, and which they are assured in advance
will not bo rejected here. This may bring
I hem to act sooner than they otherwise
would.
: The objection to a pro nature presentation
Jof a plan ty tbe National Executive con>its
j n the dangt rof committals on points which
j culd could be lie-re safely left to further -Je
, velopments. Care has been taken to so shape
the document as to avoid embarrassment
from th s source
In saying that on certain terms certain
classes w ill be pardoned, with their l ights re
stored, it is not said that other classes, on
' other terms, will never be included. In say
• ing 'hat a reconstruction will be accepted if
presented in a specified way, it is not said
that it never will be accepted in any oilier
way.
l'lie movements, by Statu action, for eman
j cqation in several of the Stales not included
I in the Emancipation Proclamation, are mat.
i ter of profound gratulation. And while Ido
j not rtjieat in. detail what 1 have htrelof re ->.
I earnestly urged upon ibis subject, my general
{ views and feelings remain unchanged, and I
! trust that Congress will omit no fair npportu
j nity of aiding these important steps lo the
! great consummation.
In the midst of other cares however itn
port an', we must not lose sight of the fact
j that the war power is still our main reliance
j —lo that power nlone can we look, yet for a
i time, to give confidence to the people in the
| contested regions that the insurgent power
! will not again overrun them. Until that con
fidence shall be established little can be done
i anywhere for what is called reconstruction ;
, hence, our chiefest care must still be directed
j lo Ihe army and navv, who have thus la 1 '
borne their harder part so nobly and so well.
And it tray be esteemed fortunate that in
giving the greatest efficiency to those indts
pensable arms, we do not also honorably rec
| ognize the gallant men. from commander to
i sentinel, who compose them and to whom
j more than to others the world must stand
; indebted for the home of freedom, dis
j enthralled, regenerated, enlarged and per
; petuated'.
Abraham Lincoln*
| December 8, 1803.
The following proclamation is appended to
the message ;
. : Proclamation.
Whereas, In and by the Constitution of
the United States, it is provided that the
President shall have power to grant reprieves

States, except in cases of impeachment j and
wht ras, nitlelfun new exists whcuL\ the
! loyal State governments of several States
have for a long tune been subverted, and
many persons hare committed and are cow
; guilty of treason against the United -States
and whereas, with reference to said rebell
ion and treason, laws have peen enacted by
Congrses declaring forfeiture and confisoa
lion of property and liberation of slaves, all
upon terms and condition thorein stated, anu
al<o declaring that the President was there
| by authorized at any time hereafter by procla
| rr."tionto extend to pe r on> who may have 1
I
participated in the existing rebellion in any
State, or part thereof, pardon and amnestr, '
such exceptions, and at such ti;ne, an 1 on
such conditions as -he may deem expedient
for public welfare, and . I
v Whereas, Tho 'Congressional d-elarttion
for limited and conditional pardon accords
with well establish- 1 j-i heal exposittoei of
the pardoning power : and,
Whereas, with reference to said rebellion,
the Pre-ii ient of the United States ha* issjed
several proclamation* vvith iu rep ,
guru to the liberation of slaves • and,
Whereas , It is now desired hy some per
sons heretofore engaged; in said rebellion to
resume their allegiance to the Lnited States
and re-inaugerate loyal State governments
within and for their respective S tales.
1 herejore, .1, Abraham Lincoln, President
of the United States, do proclaim, declare
and make known to all pefsons who have,
d rec'ly or hy implication, participated in
the existing re bullion, except as hereafter
excepted, that a rent, p.vkdox is hereby
granted lo them and each of the to, with re
storation of all rights of piVierty, except :o§
to slaves and in property cases where the
! rights of third larties 6)iall have* intervened,
and upon the condition that every such per
sou shall take and subscribe aa oath, and
Uujnce-forward keep and maintain -said oath
shall be registered for permanent preserva
tion, and shall be of the tenor and effect fol
fowing, to wit;
"I do solemnly swear, in the presence
of the Almighty God, that I will hence
forth faithfully support, protect and defend
the Constitution of t.e I nited Siaten and
Uiiion of the States thereunder, and that I
will in Ike manner abide by and faithfully
support all acts of Congress passed during
existing rebellion with reference to slaves
1 so long n.id so far as not repealed mod Bed
or held v. id bv Congress or by decision the
Supreme Court and that I will in like* tnunnt i
abide by and fathfully support all pr >ciama
tions of the President made during th<* exis
ting rebellion having reference to -slaves f,
long and so far aft not modified or declared
void bv decision < f the Supreme Court, S
help inf God."
The persons excepted from th" Irene it sol
the f regoing pr .vsions are all who are or
*haU have been civil or diploma nc offie*rs or
agents of the so called Confederate G v- rn
men", all who have left judical stnti-ms un
der the United States to ai l the rebellion ;
all who an- or shall have 1-een military -r
j naval officers of said Confederate C. vern
j mer.t, above ttie rank cfC'd -nel in the amy,
lor of lieutenant in the navy ; all who left
I seats tn the United States (?ongrcs to aid
j the rebellion ; all who resigned their comtnis

! S'ates, and afterwards aided by the rein 1
, lion, and all who have engaged, in anyway,
! in treat!;," c ilorcd persons, or while person*
in charge of cr.ch, otlnrwise that lawfully,
prisoners of war, and which person" may fie
found in "the United Slates service, as sol
di.rs, seamen. - r in any other capacity.
And I do further proclaim, declare and
make known, that whenever, in any t f the
Stales of Arkansas, Texas Louisiana, Mipds
i sippi, T- nneesee, A'apamy, Ge- rgia, II tela
' Smith Carhna, and North Carolina.a number
of petsons, not less than one-tenth in nutn
i ber of the vota cast in such State of the
Presidential election of the year of our lord,
j ISoO. each having taken the oaih af' rea <1
and not having -ince violated it, and being
n qualified voter by the election law of the
State existing imm-dia'elv before the so
called Ad of Secession, and excluding ail
others, shall establish a State Government,
| which shall be republican. and in no wise
Contravening said oath, such shall be recog-
I
nised a* the true Government of the State,
and the State shall receive thereunder the
benefits of the constitutional provision
which declar.-" tha' the U'd'ed States shall
gnrantee to evorv State in this Union a re
publican form of government, ami shall pro
feet each of them, against invaaon ; and on
application of the Logislatue. of the executive
when the Lesbian tire, cannot he convened,
against domestic violence.
And Td •. further proclaim, declare and
make known that mv provision which may
be adobted by such state Government, in
relation to the freed people of such State
which shall recognize and declare their per
mfinrnt freedom, provide lor their educa
tion, and which may vet he cnnsistnnl as n
temporary arrangement with their present
condilion as a laboring, landless and home
less class, will not be objected 'o by the Na
! timml Executive.
And it is suggested as not. improper that ,
in constructing a loyal State Government in
; any State, the nnme of the State, the boun
dary, the subdivisions, the Constitution and
the general c>de of laws as befor the rebellion
be maintained, subject only to the tnolifica
tions make necessary by the conditions here
before stated,and such others, if any, not
; -ontravening the said..condit ions, and wfrich
j may he deemed expedient by those framing
! the new State Government.
To avoid misunderstanding, it may be
j proper to say that this proclamation, so far
i as it relates to State Governments, has ho
reference to the State* wherein loyal State
j Governments have all the while been niain
< tained.
' And for the same rcason.it tnav be further
to ay that whether mem'teii of Congress
from any State shall be admitted to their
seats constitutionally, rests exclusively with
the respective houses, and not to any extent
witlt the Executive. And still further, that
this proclamation is intended to present to
the jMjoplo of the States, wherein the Nation
al autority has bsen suspended,f.ml the loy-
State Government have been subverted, a
mode by which the National authority and
1 loyal State Governments may be reestab
