An extract, five columns in length,
from President Roosevelt’s message
to congress apears on the second page
of The Democrat. Among the most
important of the many recommenda
tions are: publicity as the only sure
cure for the evils of the trusts; the
creation of a cabinet officer to be
known as secretary of commerce and
Industries: legislation governing im
migration; self government fur the
Philippines as soon as possible: a
big navy; and the construction of the
Is hraian cannal. Reciprocity and
ship subsidies arc favored, and a
general revision of the tariff opposed.
Mineral Point needs anew school
building. This is not information:
but a simple fact well known to the
readers of The Democrat. It is self
evident. For over thirty years the
city has improved materially in all
other respects; but has practically
stood still in the matter of school
buildings. One proposition to bond
the city in the sum of $17,000 for the
purchase of a site and the cretion of
a high school building was recently
voted down. Another proposition
which has been considerably dis
cussed, and which seems to have
many supporters among those who
consider anew school building a
pressing necessity, is to tear down
the “Seminary” or brick building
and erect on its site anew and better
appointed building, of sufficient cap
acity to accommodate the high school
and all the other schools of the
city not already provided for by tho
stone school building in the fourth
ward. It is estimated that to carry
out this plan would require the ex
penditure of about $.‘10,000. As the
city is very nearly out of debt, this
amount could be secured in bonds,
payable in twenty years, at less than
4 per cent interest. It would be wise
to issue bonds for the necessary
amount and erect such a building as
would fairly meet the school needs of
the community; and it is reasonable
to suppose that the bonds could be
paid at maturity without great hard
ship to the tax payers of the city.
The Democrat submits that in our
financial history is to be found ample
warrant for this belief. By going
back to May .'5, 1880, we find in the
city clerk’s annual report this state
ment of municipal indebtedness:
State loan of 1875 $ 14042 50
State loan of 1879 18000 00
Seminary loan 5000 00
Judgment against the city.. 5000 00
Total $42942 50
Add to this amount the pulp mill
bonds of 1891, ($10,000) and the cost
of water works, ($15,000) making a
grand total of $07,942 50 for obliga
tions over and above the ordinary
running expenses of the city.
The city clerk’s report of April 10,
1901, shows a city indebtedness of
SII,OOO, which deducted from $07,942.50
leaves $50,942.50. The city has there
fore paid on its own account, over
and above ordinary expenses, in the
twenty-one year last passed, the sum
of $50,942.50, besides paying a share
of the county’s railroad bond indebt
edness.
With this record for tax paying be
hind them the people of Mineral Point
ought not to hesitate in the matter of
voting bonds for so laudable a pur
pose as the building of a good school
house.
Unrivalled in Western
Journalism.
Tho Waukesha Dispatch truthfully
and ably describes The Milwaukee
Journal as follows:
“ For intensity and persistency of
purpose, and. fairness withal, in what
ever it undertakes, the Milwaukee
Journal stands unrivalled in western
journalism, and no issue is too deep
or involved for it to attempt consider
ation, and it goes into whatever it
undertakes with au exhaustless energy.
The Journal is strikingly unique in
much that it stands for, but it forces
admiration by its boldness and
cleverness of presentation. It meets
abuse with argument, and no weak
point in the armor of its opponents
escapes dehorsing thrusts. It has its
own standard of democracy as of
everything else, and is not at all
disturbed because others disagree
with it, and it mainains its opinions 1
with a vigor and fearlessness that
forces conviction in its own sincerity
whatever may be thought of the cause
it espouses or opposes. Editorially
The Journal is easily the ablest news
paper in Milwaukee, and its editorial
compendium of the slate press with its
own comment is a unique, valuable
and interesting feature. The Journal
always has something to say itself,
and it affords besides a wider hearing
for the opinions of the newspapers of
the state. However regarded, the
the Journal is politically indispens
able to Wisconsin readers, as its
unapproachable circulation amply
affords best evidence.
The Expansion of
The Democrat.
From the Waukesha Dispatch: The
Mineral Point Democrat has been en
larged from a six to a seven column
quarto to accommodate the increasing
demands made upon the paper. The
publishers, George and Robert M.
Crawford, are good newspaper men
and public-spirited, and propose to
publish a paper in keeping with the
general prosperity and rapidly in
creasing importance of their city,
Which in business and otherwise is
second to none in southwestern Wis*-
consin.
The Milwaukee Journal says: The
lowa County Democrat, one of the
best weekly papers in Wisconsin, has
been enlarged to a sever! column
quarto to make room for its increas
ing business.
Montfort Mail: The lowa County
Democrat has been enlarged from a
6 column to a 7 column quarto. The
Crawfords are progressive.
Hollandale Review; The lowa
County Democrat has been enlarged
to a seven column paper. This is evi
dence of prosperity.
The People Against the Trusts.
George D. Cline, in The, Hudson
True Republican: The democrats wili
without doubt reiterate in their next
platform the principle of low tariff.
Heretofore the Republican press and
stump orators have charged all the
hard times and financial calamities up
to this simple little declaration.
What will they do now when one wing
of their own party, in fact everything
of the party except the trusts, is hold
ing the same thing? Does it not seem
as if this would make an open contest
of the people against the trusts?
FAYETTE.
To The lowa County Democrat.
Mrs. George Cline, who has been ill
for some weeks, died Thursday morn
ing and was buried on Friday after
noon from the M. E. church.
Wm. White lost his home by fire
Sunday, Nov. 24th.
The annual festival of the M. E.
church was held on Thanksgiving
Day. A program consisting of musi
cal and literary numbers was given
in the church at 7:30 p. m. followed
by a basket social in the church par
lors. There were 59 baskets which
netted $72. The choir rendered some
excellent music and those who recited
showed that Fayette possesses consid
erable local talent.
Mr. and Mrs. Alva Cline of Sherry,
Wis., were called here by the sickness
and death of his mother. They will
probably take the father, Mr. George
Cline, back to Wood county with
them.
Messrs. Babcock and Cookings and
the Misses Harris and Short of Wald
wick attended the social here on
Thanksgiving.
A SHOCKING ACCIDENT
occured here last Wednesday after
noon. Mrs. John Riley, who with her
husband and family have just returned
from Nebraska, went to the cellar of
Jacob Riley’s home, where they were
stopping, on an errand, when the
lamp she was carrying exploded and
set her clothing all aflame. There are
evidences that she did her best to ex
tinguish the flames but failing she
rushed up stairs, by which time she
was completely enveloped in flames.
Finally she rushed out of doors and
lay down in the snow while Jacob
Riley threw snow upon her and ex
tinguished the flames, but not until
she had been fatally burned. The
doctor was quickly called but from the
first there was no hopes of her recov
ery, the trunk of the body being sever
ely burned and the flames having been
breathed into the lungs she suffered
indescribable agony until relieved by
anaesthetics. When conscious she re
joiced greatly in her Saviour and in
the assurance that she would soon be
with him. She died at 10 o’clock the
same evening, and was buried Friday
from the Centennial church, Rev. Geo.
Brown officiating. Her sadly bereaved
husband and family have the heartfelt
sympathy of the community. She was
a good women and will be greatly
missed.
Food Changed to Poison.
Petrifying food in the intestines
produces effects like those of arsenic,
but Dr. King’s New Life Pills expel
the poisons from clogged bowels,

stipation, Biliousness, Sick Head
ache, Fevers, all Liver Kidney and
Bowel troubles. Only 25c at VV. K

Nearly Fatal.
Darlington Democrat: Osee Mor- I
gan, 11 years old, a son of James j
Morgan, broke through the ice on the !
mill pond Monday noon. Phil Allen, |
a son of John Allen, who is a year or j
two older than Osee, went to his res- \
cue but ventured too near the edge and
broke in too. They couldn’t climb
out unassisted and nobody was near
so they began to shout for help. It
was needful that they come quickly
for ice water chills and stiffens one in ;
a very few minutes. Their cries were i
heard by several persons and within |
a few minutes a number of people had
gathered on the bank and soon res
cued them from their perilous position.
They were chilled and their teeth
chattered. They were hastily taken to
Joe McCarville’s residence near by,
stripped of their clothing, put into
bed and. surrounded with appliances
for restoring natural warmth and cir
culation. Dr. Hogue was called and
gave every needed attention. The
boys seem fully recovered now but
they will probably have a wholesome
distrust of the ice for a while.
A Woman’s Awful Peril.
“There is only one chance to save
your life and that is through an oper
ation,” were the startling words
heard by Mrs. I. B. Hunt, of Lime
Ridge, Wis., from her doctor after he
had vainly tried to cure her of a
frightful case of stomach trouble and
yellow jaundice. Gall stones had
formed and she constantly grew
worse. Then she began to use Elec
tric Bitters, which wholly cured her.

Kidney remedy. Cures Dyspepsia,

A WHITE HOUSE GUEST.
4 Bright Oklahoma Girl to Be En
tertained by the President.
Bossie Mulhall is soon to be the guest
of President and Mrs. Roosevelt at the
White House. She will leave her Okla
homa home iu a few days on her way
to Washington, accompanied by her fa
ther, the noted Zack Mulhall.
All this is interesting for several rea
sons. First of all. Miss Bossie is re
markably beautiful. Next, iu addition
to the conventional accomplishments
usual in an up to date young woman,
she has several that are decidedly
unique, for Miss Bossie can rope a steer
or ride a bucking broncho with the best
of the cowboys. It was these accom
plishments that won the unbounded
admiration of President Roosevelt and
which resulted iu an invitation to the
White House. Finally, Miss Bossie is
said to be the original of Bossie Brau-
Uer in Charles 11. Hoyt’s excruciating
ly funny farce, “A Texas Steer.”
Like President Roosevelt, Bossie Mul
hall is fond of strenuous life. She has
been reared upon a ranch, this most re
markable young woman. She can shoot
with the skill of a frontiersman. She
can lasso and tie a wild steer with the
dexterity of the most expert cowman.
She has courage and steady nerve and
can brand a yearling without flinching.
She rides astride and boldly. She does
not know the meaning of fear. She
loves the open air and the plains. Hers
has been a life out of doors, yet she is
cultured and well read. She plays clas
sical ' music and is versed in social
graces.
And, above all, she has beauty of that
striking type which speaks for good
health. She is a brunette and of beauti
ful figure. Her age is not more than
twenty-one years.
She first met President Roosevelt at
the rough riders’ reunion in Oklaho
ma City a year ago. Her younger sis
ter, Lucile, was present on that occa
sion, and it was Lucile who gave an ex
hibition of riding and of lassoing steers
that excited the admiration of the colo
nel of the rough riders. But Lucile is
no more expert than her sister Bossie.
It is related of Bossie that one day,
while riding on her father’s ranch with
Lucile, she started a brace of vicious
gray wolves. The young woman imme
diately took up the chase. Bossie
swung her lasso, and it found the neck
of the larger of the two wolves. Wheel
ing her pony, she started for the ranch
house, dragging the wolf. Several miles
had been covered when the wolf freed
himself by gnawing the lariat in two.
Not daunted, Bossie made another
noose, and again she roped the wolf.
This time she drove him round and
round a tree, until Lobo had no more
tether, and then, having no revolver
with her, she loosed a stirrup and beat
the animal to death.
President Roosevelt, while a guest of
her father, Zack Mulhall, during the
rough riders’ reunion, admired the
wolf pelt. Later the pelt was mounted
and today is within the Roosevelt home
at Oyster Bay.—Kansas City Journal.
Giilnsliorongli Hats.
It did not take the recovery of the
long lost Gainsborough picture to bring
the Gainsborough hat back to favor.
Truth to toll, it has never been out of
favor, nor has there been a time during
the past fifty years when the Gainsbor
ough of conventional shape could not
have been w;orn with perfect propriety.
But the recovery of the picture
brought it into notice, and it only took
one glance at the stately, half smiling
duchess to show the women of the new
century what a pretty hat had come
down to them—a gift from the past,
says the Pittsburg Dispatch.
The Gainsborough hat, as worn by
the Duchess of Devonshire and as seen
in the paintings of the great English
court painter, was a very large affair,
quite Hat in the brim and rather low In
the crown. To give it height the crown
was trimmed and the brim was made
undulating by being turned up at one
side. In addition to this and as a
crowning touch it was worn tilted upon
the head.' Its distinguishing character
istic was its trailing feathers, and these
today as well as then mark the hat as
distinctively that of the Gainsborough.
Her Salary the Highest.
The highest salaried woman employee
in any government department in
Washington is Miss Lillian A. Norton
of Massachusetts. She has just been
appointed superintendent of postal
finance in the postoffice department in
place of a man, Albert W. Bingham,
who died about ten days ago after hold
ing that post for more than thirty
years.
It isn’t a wonderfully high salaried
post after all, though, compared with
some of those held by men. It pays
$2,250 a year, but that is excellent pay
in Washington for a woman, and Miss
Norton is envied, naturally, by her sis
ter employees of Uncle Sam. She has
been in the government service for fif
teen years, beginning as a stenographer
in the dead letter office. At Mr. Bing
ham’s death she was the chief clerk of
the finance division, and she succeeded
to this post simply because she knew
more about the work of the division
than any person in it.
The Enipres* Hid Not Forget.
The Empress Eugenie and Lord Rob
erts are firm friends, the foundation of
the friendship being laid in one of
those thoughtful little acts that make
the commander in chief so justly be
loved. After the death of the prince
Imperial Lord Roberts went himself to
the spot on which he fell and gathered
a tiny bunch of flowers, which he sent
to the sorrowing mother. When Lord
Roberts suffered a similar bereave
ment himself last year, one of the first
letters of cohdolence he received came
from the empress, who insisted on
writing it with her own hand in spite
of the rheumatism that makes it so
difficult for her to hold a pen.
