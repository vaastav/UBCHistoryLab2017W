the ix nmntlis piiur to June -Id, S7, the- sur
plus revenue had crown so hove by repented ac

of this yreat sum net -led bv the people would
so lifted the business of the country that
tl'.e sum (f t'.o.siii.iui! of such surplus was
applied to the payment of the principal and in

Old ion of the i lovernmcnt. The pi ce u ious rn

per cent, bonds then outstanding, atnouut
inir with principal and interest to the sum
of ls.s;r.ri0 1 were called tn and applied to the
mnhitii; fund contribution for the current fiscal
year.
Notwttlislumlinjr these operations of the
Treasury Depart incut, represrulations of dis
tress III business olrcles not only continued, but
Increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand.
In these circumstances the contribution to the
Rollout! fund for Ihe current Uveal year was at
once completed by the expenditure of
t:7.li,s(,!js'i..,i jn the purchase of kov
eminent IhuuIs, not yet due. hearinir four

per cent, for the latter. In uditition to this the
interest liccruinjf duriip.' the current year upon
the outstiindinir ponded Indebtedness nf the
Government was to some extent anticipated,
nnd banks selected us di po-itorlcs of public
money were permitted to somen hat increase
their deposits.
while tlio expedients thus employed to re-
louse to the people the money lyim; idle lu the
treasury, served to avert immediate danu'cr.
our -.lupins revenues have coi,;inued to im-cii-piulute.
the excess for the preio'nt year amount-
Inu'on the tlrst day of !eeeniber to ?,i.i.v:iS. .ot.
l'.i. and estimated to reach the sum of f ll,im.-
em on the ,'ioth of June next, at which date it is
epeeted that this sum. uddeil to the prior ac
cumulations, will swell the surplus iu the treas
ury to 1 10,0110 it to. There seems to be no ussiir-
iince that, w ith such a withdrawal from us of
the people's circulation medium, our business
community niay not. In tho near
fu'ure. tn- subjected to the same distress which
was (piilc hnely produced from Ihe same cause,
nnd while the functions of our National Treas
ury should be few uml simple, nnd w hile Its best
condition would he reached. 1 believe, by Its
entire disconnection with private business In
terests, yet, lien, by a perversion of its pur
poses, it Idly holds money uscla-sly suhtractcd
from the channels of trade, tlici-e seems to no
reason for the clnim that somo legitimate
means should he devised by the (iovertiment to
restore in an emcrccncy, without wasto or ex-
travanancc, such money to Its place umoiiB the
people.
If such nn c morironcy nrises tncro now exisis
no ch nr and undoubted Kxecutlve power oi re
lief. Ilcrctnfnro the redemption of three per
rent, bonds, which wen' payable ut the option of
the tloverniuent has afforded a means for the
disbursement of the excess of our revenues ; but
these bonds have all been retired, and then- an
no bonds oatstandllip tho payment of which
we have the rlirlit to Insist upon. The contribu
tion to the slnkinit fund which furnishes the oc
casion for expenditure In the purchase ef bonds
has been already iiuirte for the current yenr, so
that there Is no outlet In that direction.
In the present state of legislation tho only
pretense of any exlstltw executive power to
restore, ut this time, nny part of our surplus
revenues to the people by its expenditure, con
sists in tho supposition that tho Secretary of
the Treasury'

The only provision of law from whlcS sufh i
power could be derived is found in an appi-oprf

exist which would justify tho Rrant of

Its necessity, to wllhh. hi from or release to the
business of tho people. In nn unusual manner,
money held In the Treasury, ami thus ufleot, nt
his will, the llnanelal sllmitton of the country!
nnd If It is deemed wise to Indite In Ihe Hccro

It should be borne In mind that premiums must

out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause,
constantly ivprodueinjr tho si'm alariuinj; eir
stunces a congested Nalionai Treasury ami
a depleted monetary cotiNitiori in the business
of the country. It need hanily be stated that
while the present situation demands a remedy,
we can only be saved from a like predicament
in the future by the removal of its cuiw.
Our scheme of taxation, hy means of which
this nci liless surplus is taken from the people
and put into the public treasury, consists of a
tariff or duty levied upon liu-i-ortations from
abroad and ililernal reienue luxes levied upon
lh nsuniption or tobiuto and spirituous and
malt liipior;-. It must l:e com eded that none of
Ihe things subject d to internal reve nue taxa
tion are. siriclly speaking, necessaries; there
iippi ars to bo no just complaint of this taxa
tion by the consumers of these arlicies. and
there seems lo be notion!.' so well able to hour
the burden without hardship to any portion of
the people.
Hut our present tariff laws, the
VlrlOf!, INKCOI'iTUII.K ASII Il.l.ll'lli'A I,
Source of unnecessary taxation, ou.-lit to lie nt
once revised nnd amended. These laws, as th'-ir
primer,' and plain chert, raise the price to con
sumers of all urticles imported ami subject to
duty, by precisely the sum paid for such dut s.
Thu.'i t lie amount of the duly measuici the
tax paid by those who purchase for use
these Imported articles. Many of these
thiti'.'s. however, are raised or inanufactured
in our own country, and the duties now lev
led upon foreien eoods and uroducts an,
called p'roteetioir lo these homo manufac
turers, because they render it possible for
those of our people who are manufacturers, to
make these taxed articles end sell them for a
price equal to that demanded for Ihe imported
l-'oods that have paid customs duty. So it hap
pens that, while comparatively a few use the
Imported urtieloH, millions of our people, who
never use and never saw any of the foreign
products, purchase and use things of Hit same
kind made in this country, nnd pay therefor
nearly or quite the sane- enhanced price which
the duly adds to the imported articles. Those
who buy impnits pay Ihe duly charged thereon
into Hie public treasury, bill Ihe erciit majority
of our citizens, who tuiv domestic articles of
the same class, pay a sum at least approximately
equal to this duty, to the home manufacturer.
This reference to the opt ration of our tariff
laws is not made by way of instruction, hut in
order that we niav be constantly reminded of
the manner In which they Impose a burden upon
those w ho consume domestic products us well
as those who consume imported urticles. and
thus create a tax upon all our people.
It. Is not proposed to entirely relieve the
country of this taxation. It must be cxicuovely
continued as the source of the Government's In
come, nnd in a readjustment of our tariff the In
terests of Aniericiin labor eneueed in manufae
lure should be carefully considered, as well as
the preservation of our manufacturers. It may
be called protection, or by any other name, but
relief from the hardships and daneersof our
present tariff laws should be devised with espec
ial precaution nrainst iniperilinir the existence
of our manufacturlni; interests. Hut this
exispsire should not mean n condition which
without repird to the public welfare or a Na
tional exfeeney. must ulwavs insure the renpzn
tlon of immense protits. Instead of moderately
protltable returns. As the volume nnd diversity
of our National activities Increase, new recruits
an1 ndded to those who desire a continuation of
the advantie-'cs which they conceive the present
system of tariff taxation directly affords them.
So stubbornly have nil efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those of our
fellow-citizens thus eni-'neetl, that thev can hard
ly complain of the suspicion, entertained to a
certain extent, that there exists
AN OHOAN1ZU1) COMlltNATION

tempt Is mude to justify n scheme which per

lie increased. They of course nre not reminded

TiJK CABMEN WHO ITAS NO SHKKP
Is hy this hcheine ohliyed, in his purehnses of
cloth. nt; and wnnlun piudi, tn pay a tribute to
Ids fWlow farmer as well as to the manufaetur
er Und nn r'hatit : nor is any meritiiiu made of
the fact that the sheep-owners themselves and
their households must wear clothing and use
other articles manufactured from the wool they
sell at tnrirf prices and thus as Consumers Must
reluni their shine ot this increased price to ihe
tradesman,
1 think it may be fairly assumM that a hmre
proportion of the sheep owned by the farmer
lliroutfholit the country are found in small
iloi'ks numbering from twenty-live to ilfty. The
duly on the f?rade of imported wool which those
sheep yield, is ten cents each pound, if ot the
value of thirty cents or less, and twelve eents if
of the value of more than thirty cents. If the
liheial tvti mute of six pounds he allowed fot
each fleece, the duty thereon would he sixty or
seventy-two cents, and this may he taken as tho
utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer
hy reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would
thus represent the increased price of the wool
from twentj -live sheep and frHi that from the
ttoul of llfty sheep; and at present values this
addition would amount to about one-third of its
price. If upon its sale the fanner receives tills
or a less turilT profit, the wool le.ivet his hands
charired with precisely that sum, which in ull
lis chur-res will adhere to it until it reaches
the consumer. Whrn manufactured into chub
and other roods and material for ue its cost is
not only incicascd to the extent of the farmer's
tariff profit, hut u further sum has been added
fur the beuelit of the manufacturer under the
(ipenitimi of other tariff laws, lu the
nn -.in time the day arrives wh-n the farmer
Ihids It neeessiiry to purchase woolen tfoods and
material to clothe himself and family for the
winter. When he faces Ihe tradesman for that
purpose he discovers that he is obliged not only
to return tn the way of increased prices, his tar
iff profit on the wool he sold, uud which then
perhaps lies tvforo him in a manufactured
form, but that he must add a considerable sum
thereto to meet a further increaso iu cost
eiiused by a tariff duty on the manufacture.
Thus in the end he is aroue1 to the fact thut
he has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a re
sult, ef the tariff scheme, which, when he sold
his wool, seemed so profitable, an increase in
price morn than suillelent to sweep away all the
tariff protlt he received upon the wool he pro
duced and sold.
When the number of farmers entraed in wool
rnlsinf is comeured with u'i rnc i.irn er tv,lhe
country, nnd the r'tnall proportion they bear to
eur population ts considered; when U is made
apparent thut, in the ruse of a largo part of
tho.se who own sheep, the benefit of the
present
TAIitPF on wuor, js ii.i.usouv;
And, above all. when it must be conceded that
ttie Increase of the cost nf the living caused by
such tariff, becomes a burden upon those wit'i
moderate means and the poor, the employed
and unemployed, Ihe stele and well, und tho
young and old, and that It constitutes a tax
which, with relentless jrr.isp. is fasten-jd
upnn the clothing of every man, woman and
child in tho laud, reasons are suggested why
the removal or reduction of this duty should be
lnchid .'d in a revision of our tariff taws.
In speaking of the increased cost to the con
sumer of our home manufactures, resulting
from a duty laid upon imported articles of the
same description, the fact is not. overlooked
thai competition nmoiv our domestic producers
sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of
their products below the highest limit allowed
by such duly. Hut it is notorious that, this
competition is too of fen strangled by combina
tions quito prevalent at this timo, uud fre
quently CAt.LKD Tia'STS,
Which have for theirobjeet the reputation nf the
supply and price of commodities made and sold
by members of tho combination. The people
cun hardly hope for any consideration tn the
operation of these selilsh schemes. If, however,
in the absence ef such combination, a healthy
and free competition reduces the price of any
particular dutiable article of home production,
below the limit which it mltftit otherwise reach
under our tariff laws, and if, with such reduced
price. Its manufacture continues to thrive, it is
entirely evident that one thing has been dis
covered which should be cure fully scrutinized
in an effort to reduce taxation.
'I lie necessity of combination to maintain the
prire of nny commodity to the tariff point fur
nishes proof thut some one is willing to accept
lower prices for such commodity, and that such
prices tire remunerative, nnd lower prices pro
duced by competition prove the same thing.
Thus where either of these conditions exist, a
case would seem to be presented for on easy re
duction of taxation. The considerations which
have been presented touching our tariff laws
are intended only to enforce an earnest recom-

These interests constitute a leiuliiiK uud most
siihstuiitiul element of our National irrcutncs
and furnish tha proud proof of our country's
progress. Hut if in the emergency that presses
upon us our manufacturers are asked to sur
render somrtliinii for the public good uud to
avert disaster, thoir patriotism ns well as a
uriitcfiil recognition of udvutitiipes ulready af

A decision was rendered by the United
States Kuproino Court yesterday al'ienio.m
in the Virginia miw.j coriw ca-es of At
torney Oeneral AyrcsuiidLouiniunweullb's
Attorneys Hcott and McCube, who were
imjirisoued by ordor of Judge lliind, of the
United htutes Circuit Court, lor disohedi'
ence to a lestiaiimig niMer JorDiil.ling
tlum to bring suits for the collec:ioa ol
taxes in cases where tenders have been
been niado by iiix-receivablo coupons cut
from htato bonds. This court, la a very
long and elaborate opinion by Jus
lice Mat' hew, holds that the suit
iu which Judge liond Issued the
restfaining order in tlio Circuit Court,
although nominally a suit against Individu
als, is in realty a suit against the Htato of
Virginia and as such forbidden by 1 lie
Eleventh amendment to tlio Federal consti
tution that tlio United states Circuit Court
bad, therefore, no auihority to entertain
such suit; that in so Join,' a:i.l in issuing a
restraining order to prevent tho emeei's of
the State from discharging their dunes
under the laws of tlio .State, Ju igo liond
was acting without constitutional warrant,
anil that tho res' ruining order and all sub
sequent proceed iui.'s under it, including
Iho arrest and imprisonment of the note
tionois, were Illegal and without aut'iMi'ity
Tho com", therefore, directs that tho poli
tiouers, Attorney General Ayers and Com
monwealth's Attorney Scott und ilct'ubo
be at once discharged.
The opinion, which is that of the whole
court without a ilisscuting voice, sustains
the State of Virginia at all point, mid vir
tually declares thai a State, as apolitical
sovereignty, cannot bo sued nor coerced in
tlio Federal courts, either by an action
brought against her by name or by an ac
lion brought against her ofllcers In their
official capacity. The court declares that
the eleventh amendment establishes a dis
tinction between contracts made ly iiuti
vidnals witli each other and contracts made
by iid.viduals with a State. The latter
class cannot be enforced by the remedies
used to enforce the former that is, by
suits in the United States cour s, and they
are, therefore, without, sanciion except lu
so far us such sanciion is given to Ihein by
the honor ami good faith of tho contract
Ing State. Such State muv consent to bo
sued in its own courts or in the Federal
courts for breach of contract, but it may ut
any time withdraw sueh consent, and re
suine its sovereignty, and it cannot th-?n be
judicially coerced at tha request of un lu
dividual.
A number of representatives of tho wool

action upon the needs of that industry for

three separate interests uivolvod, thoso of
the wool growers, tho wool dealers uud tl:
wool manufacturers. Mr. William M. Cow-
den, the secretary of the Ohio Wool Grow
ers' Association, thus outlined the objects
of this conference: "We want," he said
"a tariff high enough to enable us to live.
Wc wunt this industry, so fur as prolitsure
concerned, placed on a level with other
agricultural Industries. Tho tariff is now
too low, especially under the present rul
ings of tho Treasury Department, which
lets in too much foreign wool. We do not
propose to dictate to Congress what tho
rate shall be, but we do propose to make
such a representation of the condition of
the industry us to enable digress to form
a judgment as to what would be fair und
rqaitablo."

any State deprive any person of life, lib

Intoxicating liquors, to bo there gold or

privilege or Immunity secured by the Con
stitution nf the United States, is mude clear
by the deriklon of this court, rendered be
fore and since tbe adoption of tho four
teenth Amendment. It is, however, con
tended that although tho State may pro-
hii.lt the manufacture of intoxicating
liquors for tale or barter within her limits
fur general use a a beverage, no conven
tion or Legislature has tho right, undor
our form of Government, to prohibit uny
citizen from manufacturing for his own
usoorfor export or storage, any article
of food or drink not endaiigcringor affect-
ing the rights of others, tlie ar
gument made in support of the first
branch of this proposition, briefly stated,
That In the implied compact between
the State and the citizen certain rights aro
reserved by the latter which are guaran
teed by the constitutional provisions for
tho protection of life, liberty and property
against deprivation without duo process of
law and With which tlio State can not in
terore; that among lliose rights is that of
manufacturing, for one's own use, either
food or drink; that, while according to tho
doctrine of the communes, tho
State may control the tastes, appetites,
habits, dress, food and drink of thn
citizen, our system of lloverntnent, haseol
upon the individuality nnd intelligence of
tho people, does not clnim to control him
except ns to his conduct to others, leav
ing him the sole judge as to all that oniy
affects himself. With referenco to the)
assertion that the prohibition of the manu
facture and sale of liquor deprives liquor
dealers of their property without due pro
cess Of law, the court says that all property,
uuderour form of government, issubject to
the obligation that it shall not be used so
as to injuriously uffect the rights of tho
community and thereby become a
nuisance. The State of Kansa3 had i.
right to prohibit the liquor traffic. It did
not thereby take away the property of the
brewers. It simply abated a nuisance.
The property is not taiten uwny from its
owners: they aro only prohibited from
using it for a specitic pm;ose, which tbo
Legislature declared to be in ju riulia to tho
community.

ays: "Typhoid fever, and possibly chol

Hudson." He finds that on the average a
pint ot the melted ice contains about live
hundred thousand living bacteria of vari
ous kinds. "It is ccrtulu," continues Dr.
Pruddon, ' that the ice from some parts of
the river must contain the bacteria of ty
phoid fever, and these may be taken into
