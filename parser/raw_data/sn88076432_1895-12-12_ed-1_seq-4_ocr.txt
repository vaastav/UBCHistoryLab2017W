LICENSE AND TEMPERANCE.
It appears to be an obvious result
-of the high-license experiment tried
in many places during the past two
'decades that license increases mu
nicipal revenues without decreasing
•drunkenness or the amount of liquor I
y! consumed.
Morally the experiment is a
j•' failure. Financially it is a success.
The inference is easy, therefore
I1 that it will not be abandoned. The
temperance reformers are unable to
condemn it so long as it does not
inorease the evils of which they
complain. Their only possible
form of attack upon it must be in
the demand that license shall be
I abolished and prohibition inaugurat
ed. The increasing revenues of
munioipslities uuder high license

THATDULUTHSBORT LINE,
The people at the head of the
lakes are looking down past St. Paul
and Minneapolis upon the rich
plains of North Dakota with long
ing in their gaze. They want our
produce shipped past the Twins and
landed iu Duluth. They want a
direct railway line aud the West
Superior luland Ocean says.
With business conditions growing
more favorable right along it is not
too much to expect that the atten
tion of our citizens will turn toward
the great enterprises which have
been partly outlined in the past.
First among these is a direct rail
connection with the wheat and flax
fields of northern North Dakota.
The people in that rich section want
not only to get their prod. cts to
the head of the lakes as cheaply as
possible but they desire to come
here to do their trading.
A
Outside taxpayers already com
plain somewhat of discrimination in
this respect,but the burdens of actual
residents, who remain here the year
around and who pays state and
county taxes out of the meager
profits of the farms, are much
greater in proportion than thoss of
non residents.
These unimproved lands owned
by large estates and by corporations
are beyond question now held at
such high prices that no farmer can
hope to pay for them in mauy years
at the present prices of produce,
therefore their sale is slow, and only
the crop payment plan is received
with favor at all.—Jamestown

THIRTY CENT WHEAT.
Congressman Johnson figures
that a North Dakota farmer can
make money at raising wheat for 30
ccnts a bushel. Johnson himself
can, so Johnson himself says. But
people drawing a $5,000 a year salary
are to be pardoned for seeing things
through rose.tinted glasses. There

LAND KBP IDLE.
The holding of large bodies of
our state lands by outside parties
for a future raise in value is becom
ing more apparent as a great -detri
ment to the state, The prices gen
erally asked for these lands are far
above what they are worth and to
make the settlers now here create a
value for these unimproved lands,, is
a policy that is growing in disfavor
in the state. Our constitution says
that plowing does not constitute an
improvement to be taxed and under
this the assessment of unimproved
lands can be made large. The plan
of taxing gunimproved lands unim
proved lands until the owners are
willing to sell their holding, or im
prove them, is being seriously pro
osed in several quarters and it is
likely to be attempted in the near
future by counties to a much greater
extent than heretofore. The in
tention of the constitution was to
make idle land pay as much for its
condition as cultivated.

even at that price they, will still be

however, how the man who had
$1,000 debt on bis quarter section
was going to be able to pay it off
with 30 cents wheat. When the
debt was contracted the farmer
could pay it off with one-third of
