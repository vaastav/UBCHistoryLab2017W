Negotiations Maine Incident
Caniea Annoyance.
Paris, Dec. 8. The treaty is fin
ished. The Spaniards have declined to
graS't most of the requests of the
United States which were unsettled at
the beginning of the session.
They refuse to cede a coaling' station
in the Caroline islands, to the United
States.
:*,3g,Judge Day said Thursday:
r.."We have settled all the points on which
we can agree. It only remains to engross
and sign the treaty. That will be done
two or three days."
Contuins Little Outside Protocol.
The members of the commissions say
the treaty will contain little outside
of the scope of the Washing-ton protocol
and the matters directly based thereon,
like the provisions for the evacuation of
the ceded territories, the transfer of
public property therein,
and guarantees
of the safety of the property and rights
of the Spanish citizens remaining there.
The details of the last class of ques
tions covered by the statement which
tlie Americans handed to Senor Mon
tero Uios at the last meeting were con
sidered Thursday, but all tlie commis
sioners refuse to divulge tlie details
of the conference.
Several points upon which thev were
unable to agree were left open ior dip
lomatic negotiations.
The Spaniards refuse to admit that
they had failed to respect former
treaties guaranteeing-religious free
dom in the Caroline islands, cr that
there was a necessity for new guaran
tees. .-
Extreme Politeness.
The conclusion of the work was, ac
cording to the commissioners, marked
by politeness and all outward evidences
of good feeling and relief at the fact
that the task was accomplished.
SVhen all the propositionsi had been
discuussed, Judge Day, president of the
American commission, remarked:
''There seems to be nothing more to
do but engross and sign the treaty."
Senor Montero Rios, president of the
Spanish commission, acquiesced to this
and the Americans bowed themselves
out .before the Spaniards, according to
their custom.

France Threatens Trouble.
Diplomatic circles in Paris predict,
as one of the results of the treaty a
diplomatic contest between France and
the United States, which will have an
important chapter in history.
The French government is reported
io have resolved to take up the case
c'f.the French holders of Cuban bonds
and it is believed France will declare
that the repudiation of the bonds is
the result .of the treaty which the vic
torious nation imposed upon Spain.
They argue that through the treaty
responsibility hps been shifted upon
America and therefore the French gov
ii ernment will endeavor to exact some
pledge for the payment or guarantee of
the bonds.

In connection with tlie consideration
of bills on the pension calendar. Sen
ator Vest (.Mo.) saici:
"I (lo not want to be captious about thin
pension business and do not want to set
myself up as a reformer, but this thing of
passing a lot ol: pensidn bills simply by the
reading of the titles, and when a ciuorum of
the senate is not present, has got to be
stopped."
Alter further referring to the meth
ods by wlncli pension bills are passed
by the senate, Senator Vest Said:
I "Men of the south have sat here and per
I nutted these bills to be passed, having
.some
delicacy about entering objections to the
course of procedure. Recent events have
obliterated sectionalism, and we are
united. We can therefore come here and
object to this spoliation, and
1 use the word
advisedly, without fear of having our mo
tives impugned or our words misconstrued.
We ara paying out in round figures 5141,

duty to iind out why it is that, 33 years aft

pension claims shows so enoimous a sum.
I have been criticised by some of my people

liberally in pensions. I regard such pay

consideration and without the same restric

Senator Gallinger (X. H.), as chair
man of the pension committee, agreed
with Senator Vest in his desire to have
the pension bills carefully considered,
lie thought a quorum of the senate
ought to be in attendance when the
pension calendar was considered.
