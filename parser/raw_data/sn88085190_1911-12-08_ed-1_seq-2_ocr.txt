ITALIANS BURIED ALIVE.
Women Aid Turks m Perpetration of
Barbarous Acts.
Washington, D. C—Stories of al
most incredible barbarities practiced
by Arabs and Turks are contained in
dispatches received at the Italian em
bassy here.
In a dispatch received from Rome,
the Italian minister of foreign affairs
describes alleged atrocities practiced
on the Italian wounded which include
crucifixion, and burial alive. Wo
men, it is said, take part in the perpe
tration of the cruelties.
The dispatch, which is signed by
Signor San Guiliano, minister of for
eign afiairs, follows:
"Near the mosque of Heni, where
the medical post of the Twenty
seventh battalion of Bersaglieri had
located, 40 bodies of our soldiers were
found. They were horribly mutilated,
crucified with their throats cut open,
impaled, torn to pieces and dismem
bered. Among them was the body of
a surgeon lieutenant. ,
"In the Arab cemetery, near the
places where the fourth company of
Bersaglieri was located, seven bodies
of Bersaglieri were discovered. They
had been interred alive, with the
heads out of the earth.
"The body of one of them showed
that he had been terribly tortured.
There were many shot and dagger
wounds, and the eyes had been pulled
out and threaded and the eyelids sewn
to'the brows. [Another one had one
arm out of the earth from which the
hand had been cut off.
"A captain's cap ha 3 been found
and its owner identified as a corporal
who escaped miraculously after re
maining four hours in a ditch. He
testified that among the hordes were
Turks and women. The military en
gineer corps took photographs.
NAVY RUN WITH ECONOMY.
Establishment 20 Per Cent Larger
But Cost of Upkeep Less.
Washington, D. C.—With an appro
priation reduced by $400,000, the gov
ernment, the past two years, has been
maintaining a navy larger by 20 per
cent than it was during the preceeding
two years.
This was made possible by econo
mies resulting from improvement in
business methods, said Secretary
Meyer in a statement made public re
cently.
A reduction of 10 cents a pound in
»the cost of powder is reported by the
ordnance bureau, 1,000,000 pounds
having been made during the past
year at a cost of 33.6 cents a pound.
Purchasing hemp at Manila resulted
in a saving of $40 a ton, an annual
saving of approximately $30,000; by
docking vessels at navy yards the de
partment saved $46,000 during the
past fiscal year, a reduction of 20 per
cent; and the use of substitutes for
linseed oil netted a saving of about
$40,000.
By manufacturing certain classes of
goods at the navy yards in which they
can be purchased cheapest large sav
ings have resulted. Particularly is
this true of standard mess taoles, the
cost of which has been reduced from
$20 to $11.94 at one navy yard.
GRIEF MAKES MAN MUTE.
Father of Girls Buried in Sand House
May Never Speak Again
Kansas City—Grief over the loss of
his two little daughters, Ethel and
Flossie, who were killed when their
sandpit playhouse caved in, caused
Andrew Hutchinson, of Kansas City,
Kan., to lose his power of speech.
Hutchinson, a well-digger, suffered
from an injury several years ago and
for the last year has worked only a
small part of the time. When the
cave-in occurred, he ran to the sand
pit and looked at the bodies of his
daughters. He did not return home
for an hour, but sat on a pile of rails
and gazed at the heap of sand. He
has been mute since* and physicians
fear he will never speak again.
Suffrage Splits Harvard.
Cambridge, Mass. —The refusal of
the Harvard corporation to allow Mrs.
Pankhurst to address the students in
a college building has caused a stir in
undergraduate circles. The body of
students is splitting into two camps,
suffragists and anti-suffragists, and
influential alumni are being asked to
take a hand in the controversy.
A petition has been started praying
the corporation to reserve its judg
ment and the party is enrolling itself
as the Harvard Men's Equal Suffrage
league.
Embezzlement is Charge.
Cordova, Alaska—John W. Foulkes,
assistant postmaster under ex-Presi
dent Joseph F. Diggs, was given a
preliminary hearing on a charge of
embezzling $4,000 of postoffice funds
and was bound over to the grand jury
under $6,000 bounds. Pending the se
curing of bonds Foulkes was remanded
to jail. Postoffice Inspector Smith
testified at the hearing that a shortage
of $4,000 was not discovered by the
inspectors because of false reports.
Newspaper Best Educators.
Salt Lake City—"Geography can be
properly taught only from the newspa
pers," declared Dr. A. E. Winship, of
Boston, in an address to the Utah Ed
ucational association on "Education
for Prosperity." He declared news
papers were the greatest textbooks in
the world, as no other publication
could keep pace with the rapid changes
of modern Hfe.
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND
PROGRESS €F OUR HOME STATE
EDUCATE GROWERB.
Fruit Association Decides on Organ
ization and Study.
North Yakima—A prediction that
within two years the Yakima" Valley
Fruit Growers' association will be the
grestest business enterprise in the
Yakima valley, made by General Man
ager J. R. Robbins, of the associa
tion, was backed up by his annual re
port, which shows that with all re
turns with the exception of those on
five cars, now in the hands of the
growers, the association has a cash
balance in the bank sufficient to jus
tify the methods used by the sales de
partment.
Education and organization *of the
fruitgrowers who are already in the
valley, rather than exploitation only
of its resources, will be the future
policy of the Yakima Valley Fruit
growers' association, according to a
statement made by General Manager
J. E. " Robbins, and Secretary W. P.
Romans, who declared themselves in
favor of the immediate establishment
of an experimental farm in this vicin
ity and of the turning of attention
toward education of the growers. The
policy is in line with that recently
outlined at a meeting of the Yakima
commercial club.
W!LL MAKE DAILY DEPOSITS.
King County Officials to Comply
With Terms of New Law.
Olympia—Attorney General W. V.
Tanner, has received a letter from
Treasurer William Hanna and other
officials of King county announcing
the intention of those officials to com
ply strictly with the new law requir
ing all public officials to daily make
deposits of all public funds collected.
The letter further asked the assistance
of the attorney general in aiding the
officials to comply with all the laws
governing their duties.
The daily deposit law is criticized
on the assertion that it will add ex
pense to the county treasurer's office.
On the other hand, it is asserted, had
such a law been enforced, Clerk
House, of the justice court at Seattle,
could not have created the shortage
which caused his arrest.
The county and state officials, how
ever, are agreed that whether or not
the law is economical in its operations
it is their duty to obey it.
RAILWAY CUTS FAIR GROUNDS
Lincoln County Association Plans to
Buy Another Tract.
Davenport —At a meeting of the
stockholders of the Lincoln County
Fair association, it was decided to
deed the six acres cut from the east
end of the fair grounds by the line of
the Bluestem-Columbia branch of the
Great Northern to the railway com
pany for $1,500. Besides cutting off
the best portion of the grounds, in
cluding the present entrance, four
buildings, one of them the large horti
cultural building, must be moved.
The construction of the road will
not cripple the Fair association, for
it plans to take the proceeds of the
sale, which it is expected will be closed
by C. S. Turner and Peter Selde, Jr.,
acting for the Fair board, and pur
chase an equal amount of land south
of the present grounds.
Clarkston Growers Meet.
Clarkston —A meeting of the local
horticultural association was devoted
to a further discussion of the war to
be waged against the San Jose scale
and other pests. A concerted effort
on the part of the growers will be
commenced in a short time and the
entire district will be cared for. A
report of the committee engaged in
securing data as to the cost of the
lime-sulphur spray will be made in de
tail at the next meeting. It is the
purpose of the growers to manufacture
their own spray at just above cost.
Women On Election Board.'
Davenport—At least two Davenport
women will serve as election officers

PALOUSE HOG PRICE LOW.
Slump in Quotations Explained by Re-
auction at Terminal Points.
Pullman —The price of hogs is lower
than it has been for more than four
years. Local buyers are paying only
5£ cents a pound, live weight, against
71 cents four months ago. There has
been a steady slumping prices for
weeks, the drop being at the rate of
a quarter of a cent at a time, until the
lowest rate in years has been reached.
It has been more than four years since
hogs sold as low as they are now sel-
ling.
Dealers have no excuse to offer for
the slump, other than the price has
dropped at terminal ( points. There
are few hogs in the country, compared
with the demand. The West does not
supply 20 per cent of the hogs needed
for home consumption and trainloads
of hogs are shipped from Kansas, Ne
braska and lowa to Portland, Seattle
and Tacoma. J. A. Crosbey & Co., of
Pullman, recently shipped five carloads
from Pullman to Tacoma, but these
were contracted before the price drop
ped. The market quotations for hogs
at the close of the week were: $6:35
to 6.65 at Portland, and $6.05 to $6.60
at Chicago.

though aged man of 75, was brought
before Justice of the Peace John W.
Holman on the charge of trespassing
on the place that for many years he
has regarded as his own. The land is
about 14 miles east of here and con
sists of 37 acres. Several years ago
he exercised his squatter's right and
settled on the place. He had neglect
ed filing on his claim within the re
quisite time. Later Miss Startin filed
her claim to the land and gave the old
man 60 days to vacate. Mr. Kutch
would not vacate. Miss Startin soon
afterward relinquished her claim to
Roy Tucker. Tucker demanded pos
session, but again the old man refused
to leave. Judge Holman imposed a
fine of $1 and costs.
Yakima River Is Falling.
Mabton—The Yakima river, which
was overflowing its banks the first of
the week, has again receded and all
danger of high water is past. The
reclamation service has men and
teams building a lateral west of town
which will be used in furnishing wa
ter for a portion of the town and a
couple of hundred acres -directly west

brush land is being cleared and will be
.put in alfalfa and orchard in the

OPIUM SEIZED BY RUSE.
Inspector Hifwself D«llvtrt Dru* and
Arrests Recipient.
San Francisco—Customs Inspector
Boulbard earned $5 "on ihe side" by
doing an errand for Ng Suen, Chinese
cook on the .liner Korea, just in from
the Orient. Lee Bing Hong, the
wealthy curio dealer of this city, is in
jail here for smuggling and with an
additional charge against him of brib
ing an officer. Boulbard, the first lo
cal customs officer to confess the re
ceipt of a bribe, is receiving the con
gratulations of his superiors.
The Korea had been searched by the
customs inspectors on her arrival and
yielded no opium. Thereupon Inspec
tor Boulbard, donning citizen's
clothes, joined the loafing longshore
men on the dock. Toward night his
vigil was rewarded by an anxious-ap
pearing Chinese, who singled him out
from the others on the dock and asked
him to run an errand for him.
"You likee make five dolla?" said
the Chinese.
'' Sare, "said Boulhbard, forgetting
for the moment that he drew a com
fortable salary.
The Chinese going to the cook's
quarters on the Korea promptly
brought ashore a bulky package which
Boulbard, following instructions, de
livered to Lee Bing Hong.
Lee received the package with a
wide smile, which froze into an ex
pression of horror when Boulbard
flashed his star, after pocketing the
money which Lee tendered him.
The package, according to Boul
bard's report, contained $3,000 of
opium.
Ng Suen, an alien Mongol, cannot
be brought ashore without special ar
rangements with the immigration
officials. If it can be brought about,
the cook will be held as a witness and,
if possible, as a defendant against a
smuggling charge.
MESSAGE TO BE BRIEF.
President .Will Confine [Remarks to
One Subject Only.
Washington, D. C—President Taft's
message at the opening of congress
will be a novelty, aside from its brev
ity. It will deal exclusively with the
trust problem. There will be a mere
reference to other subjects that are to
receive consideration in the messages
that will follow.
The old-fashioned "regular" mes
sage to congress, in fact, has been
listed with things archaic and is to be
superseded by a series of special mes
sages, each dealing with a specific
subject, the first being that on the re
lation of the government to business.
Succeeding state papers will include:
A special message on colonization
and problems confronting the develop
ment in Alaska.
Special message on the-regulation
of stock and bond issues, transmitting
the report of the stocks and bonds
commission.
Special message on tariff revision,
based on the report of the Tariff board
on the wool schedule and a later one
on the cotton schedule.
Special message on postoffice affairs,
including the report of the commission
on second class rates and parcels post.
RYAN HARVESTS GEM CROP.
Leopold's Partner Finds He Owns
Vast Diamond Farm.
New York—The first fruits of Thos.
F. Ryan's business partnership with
King Leopold, of Belgium, are in the
New York coustoms-house. They are
a consignment of 240. uncut African
diamonds. Some are as big as peas
and a few are a quarter of an inch and
more in diameter. What they are
worth nobody knows.
Ryan became King Leopold's chief
business partner in 1906 by putting up
a greater part of $1,600,000 for the
Congo Free State concession. Since
then he has directed the spending of
boatloads of dollars for mining ex
perts and engineers.
. He had hazy dreams of rubber and
gold and copper and lumber and silver.
Instead he finds himself owner of a
diamond farm of 166,000 acres.
Direct Primary Demanded.
Columbus — Ohio "progressives"
•took the first decisive step in their
contest to compel the Republican state
organization and the Taft supporters
to submit the election of National con
vention delegates to a direct presiden
tial preference primary. Secretary
Fackler, of the .State "Progressive
League," which is considered to be
the La Follette organization, in a com
munication to Chairman Brown, of
the Republican state committee, asked
that a special meeting be called to
take up the plan of delegate selection.
Great Crisis at Hand.
Shanghai—The great crisis in the
revolution has been reached. The
overwhelming defeat at Hang Yang
came unexpectedly to the revolution
ists and their sympathizers south of
the Yangtse. Even the radicals admit
that the revolution is held together by
only a slender thread. Wireless re
ports from Hankow indicate that it is
comparatively quiet around Hankow
and Wuchang. The gates of the lat
ter city are closed and it can not be
toM what is happening inside.
Oxford Stand* by Classics.
Oxford—Advocates of the abolition
of the study of Greek at Oxford un
iversity suffered another reverse.
They tried to insert the edge of a
wedge by passing a statute allowing
students of mathematics apd aatoial
science to omit Greek. The proposal

Los Angeles, Cal.—James B. Mc-
Namara pleaded guilty to murder in
the first degree §in . Judge Bordwell's
court Friday. His ; brother, John J.
McNamara, secretary of the Interna
tional Association of Bridge and
Structural Iron Workers, entered a
plea of guilty to dynamiting the Llew
ellyn < Iron Works in Los Angeles,
Christmas day, 1910.
' James i B.;-. McNamara's confession
clears up absolutely the tragedy of the
explosion j and fire which, at 1:07
o'clock on the morning of October 1,
1910, wrecked the plant of the Los
Angeles Times and caused the death
of 21 persons. For 19 of these deaths
the McNamara brothers were indicted,
and J.B. McNamara was on trial spe
cifically for the murder of Charles J.
Haggerty, a machinist, whose body
was found nearer than that of any
other to the spot where the dynamite
was supposed to have been placed.
 It is expected that Disrict Attorney
John D. Fredericks will ask for life
imprisonment for James B. McNam
ara, the confessed murderer, and prob
ably 14 years for his brother.
;f As the two brothers sat together in
the county jail, refusing to see any
one or make any statement, an inter
est second only to the occurrence itself
hung about the question with refer
ence to James B.
; "Why did he confess?"
To this opposing counsel gave the
same answer. -
"He confessed because he was guil
ty, and that's all there is to it," de
clared District Attorney Fredericks.
"He was counselled to confess be
cause that was the best thing he could
do, in the opinion of counsel," said
Attorney Clarence S. Darrow, chief of
counsel. ; '.;*. I will say now that there •
was no . other reason or motive in it
I've studied this case for months. It
presented a stone wall."
