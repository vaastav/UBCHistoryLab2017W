CHICAGO TO THE FORE
"Winij City Palls Up Ahead of Kama
City in Race for ConTention.
MISSOURIANS FIGHTING HARD
Still Have a Show to Land the Big
Republican Gathering.
PEIMABY LAWS ARE A PROBLEM
Victor Rosewater Presents Necessity
of Modifying Form of Call.
COMMITTEE IS INCLINED TO BALK
Holds to View State Low Cannot Dic
tate Form of Party Organisation,
bat Indications Arc Condi
tion Will Be Met.
(Trom a Staff . Correspondent.)
'WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.-rSpeclal Tela
gram.) It looks tonght aa If the national
republican cineentlon would go to Chicago,
notwithstanding Kansas City la putting; up
the gamest possible fight. Combinations
were made today a euch a substantial
character that Kansas City began to take
notice and Instead of being the lender In
the race dropped back to aecond place, the
administration interests having quietly In
timated that Chicago waa aa acceptable aa
Kannaa City.
Aftrr the appointment of committee, Mr.
Victor Roaewater, holding .the proxy of
Mr. Morrill, appeared before the committee
to draft the form of the call, constating of
Messrs. Terkes of Kentucky, Stre'Her of
Vermont and Kellogg of Minnesota, rela
tive to an unuaual attuatlon in his state.
He represented that the new Nebraska
primary law would make it neceeeary to
modify the call as Usually formulated to
permit of the selection of delegates accord
ing to the method prescribed by Nebraska
law. which haa vested the authority to call
both state and congressional conventions
In the state committee. Tho national call
heretofore haa provided for district del;
gatea to be chosen In the same way as
candidates for congress which, with the
nomination of congresemen by direct vote,
would conflict with the requirement of
the Nebraska law, that delegates be chosen
by a convention.
The committee listened attentively to Mr.
F.oscwatcr's presentation of the' Nebraska
situation and asked Mm whether he had
any auggestlona to make on other compli
cations arising under the new primary
laws in the various states, some of which
are at complete variance with the practice
and proceduro In republican conventions.
Committee 'Inclined to Balk.
The member of the committee intimated
that In their view the national -committee
of each party Is supreme and that the
form of party organisation In the nation
cannot be legally nwllfled or embarrassed
by any state leglnlatton, otherwise forty
six different legislature might proscribe
foity-sl rtifrret.t methods of ' choosing
del. -gato. prescribing qualifications and
even fixing their number to the practical
destruction, of the party organisation.
To these suggestions Mr. nosewater re
plied that it was not' a question whether
the legislature of Nebraska could exer
cise aulhority over the national commit
tee, but that its authority over the state
committee was undisputed. So far as the
Nebraska law, said Mr. Kosewater, la con
cerned. It could easily be complied with,
and it was the duty of the national com
mittee to make it puVible for the state
committee to obarrva the law If it could
bo done, without Interfering with a propor
representation of the state In the na
tional convention.
The Nebraska primary law, Mr. Boss
water explained, waa a party measure,
enacted by a republican legislature, and
It would be undesirable to compel the le
publlcan organisation - to dlaregard a re
publican platform measure.
Mr. Kellogg of Minnesota declared that.
In his opinion, the national committee bad
a right to Ignore atate lawa attempting
to govern or regulate the choice of na
tional convention delegatea, but he doubt ad
whether It. waa good policy to do eo ex
cept where It,' waa abaolutely imposslblo
to reconcile these laws with republican
practice.
The aubcommlttee took the whole sub
ject under advisement and promised to
take care of the Nebraska difficulty,
which Mr. Btreeter of Vermont declurej
nas the least obnoxious of the laws
brought to their attention.
Dine with Secretary Straus.
Victor Rosewater was the guest i f Sec
retary Straua at luncheon today and at
dinner with Senutor Brown and family at
the Portland tonight. During the course
of the luncheon with Mr. Etraua the secre
tary seemed most elated over the dsvol
pmrnt of commercial bodies throughout
the country, which be regarded aa a aplen
did el en of business Interests.
Schneider Caaaot Remember,
R. B. Schneider of Fremont, member of
the executive committee ef the republican
national committee, reached Washington In
time to Join the national committee in
calling upon the president and having his
picture taken in front of the White House.
Mr. fcchnetder has been brought into rrom
laence in the fight over the convention
city by telegrsm from Chicago stating that
he, aa treasurer of the national commit
tee In 19u4. knew how much Chicago put up
for the rare of the republican convontlon.
When asked by The Bee correspondent
tonight as to how much Chicago put up
tn. lfi. Mr. ' Schneider vaguely replied:
"They paid all the expenaea of the conven
tion and every check I drew ttKutnat an
i-nount deport U In a certain bank In
Chicago was paid. I have no idea aa to
the amount."
'Those who are connected with the inner
Circles of republican politics aay the
amount raised by Chicago was 175.000. He
that as it may the combination believes
that that amount Is sufficient to aguln In
vite the national republican convention
to the Windy City.
Minor Matters at Capital.

KANSAS CITY IN HARD FIGHT
Chicago Alive to the Necessity

National Convention"
Battlo Royal
"WASHINGTON, Deo. . The national re
publican committee) met at the Shoreham
hotel In thla city at 11 o'clock today with
Chairman Harry 8. New presiding and
Secretary Elmer Dover at the clerk's desk
The principal purpos of thla meeting Is
the naming of a time and place at which
the next national republican convention
will be held, but thla order of business will
not be reached until tomorrow,
For soma time before the committee wa
called to order the lobble Of the kotel
wer filled with member and It waa ap
parent from the beginning that the meeting
would be on of the most generally at.
tended of recent yeara. It waa also evident
that the contest over the place of meeting
would be contested very sharply, with
Kansaa City and Chicago aa the principal
applicants. The last twenty-four hours
served materially to change appearances.
for, whereas yeaterday Kansaa City
seemed to bo practically without a rival,
it waa evident at tho beginning of the
canvass today that Chlcago'a advocates
had gained renewed aasurancea and would
be prepared for a atrong fight.
inaeea, tne mends of that city were
boldly claiming a majority of tha com
mittee.
Kaasaa City Hard at Work.
The Kansaa City delegation waa by no
means willing to concede this lead. It de
veloped that for aome months that city has
had representatives visiting all the com
mitteemen at their homes to secure pledges
and It Is said that many of the committee
men had become committed to th Missouri
city that they could not change. It was
urged for Kansaa City that th city being
in tho midst of what is termed the "Bryan
country." It would be of vast advantage
to the republican party to hav th con
vention held there In caae of Bryan's nomi
nation. The fact that the location ther of
the convention might hav a material In
fluence upon holding Missouri in the repub
llcan column, alao was urg jd, as wer many
other conditions auppoaed to be favorable
to Kausas CUv.
The only other city prominently spoken of
was Denver, but the contest between Chi
cago and Kansaa City la now so spirited
that little is said of tha third place. The
frienda of tha Colorado city are hopeful
that the fight between the Illinois and Mis
souri locatlona will grow ao animated th.it
It may be necessary to shift from both of
them, and In that event they think that

LIFE IN
OMAHA, BANKS SHOW BEST
local tntions Make Statement
ha do ws Kansas City.
y-fJTVTB, CAN COMPARE
.anatrr Deposit Formerly Held by
Failed Bank Available to Omaha,
bat Not Acceptable Until
Condition Settle.
Banks of Omaha are shown to be m far
better shape than th bank of Kansaa
City by the statements of the nine clearing
house banks of that city mhlch were re
ceived Friday. In cash resources, deposit
and total resources, tha five national banka
of Omaha and threw national ' banka of
South Omaha ar far ahead of th nine
financial institution of Kanaaa City. While
th deposits of the Omaha banka have
decreased but $18,0M, aa compared with the
statement of November, 1908, the banka of
Kajisaa City have lost $12,2(13.000 during the
year and more than $22,000,000 elnoe the
August atatement. Cash reaourcea of the
Omaha banka have' Increased $a,37.85 since
November of laat year, whll the cash of
tha Kanaaa City banka have decreased
$5,5,000 In the same time.
Loans of Kansaa City banka were but
H72.000 lesa than a year ago, when the state
ment waa called at the close of business
December 8. Loans ef Omaha and South
Omaha banks are $1,871,000 less than when
the statement waa called In November last'
year.
What th Record Show.
Despite the fact that the Kansaa City
bank which failed haa boawted that it
carried more deposit than all the national
banka of Omaha combined the statement
of th Kanaaa City banka, which was
somewhat of a surprise to Omaha bankera,
ahowa the total resource of the nine In
stitutions have decreased $0,634,0(0 since
November a year ago, while th total re
sources of th Omaha clearing bouse banks
have Increaaed $l,l(iS,E9X With the possible
exception of Denver, It In expeoted the
Omaha banka will make th strongest
showing of any banks In tha weat and
Justify th remark of Chairman Hepburn
of tha American Bankera' association cur
renoy commission that "Omaha has been
tho one bright apot on the financial map
since the flurry." Other New York bonkers
have been extravagant of their praise of
Omaha banka, but In a recent map pub
lished in New Tork and given circulation by
dally papera. Kansaa City waa ahown to
be "in the clear" and a black spot aa big
aa a horse blanket was spread over Omaha.
Aa a result of the Kansas City failure,
banka of Omaha may secure a number of
new accounta from tha country banka of
southeastern and southern Nebraska, which
have been carried by the National Bank of
Commerce In Kansaa City, because of the
Interest and free collections which that In
stitution offered. But th accounts will not
be acceped under any condition by Omaha
banka, until after th flurry Is over. It Is
not the desire of Omaha bankers to take
deposits from country banks which ar
withdrawn from other banks during a finan
cial panic, and . those which have been
raftered, d urln 4e -week hero-bem
cllned with thanks. It ia btlleved that to
audi an extent banks in Omaha and. St.
Joseph hav assisted th Kanaaa City banks
In retaining many balances. .
Sympathy for Dr. Woods.
Many Omaha bankera know Dr. Woods,
president of the National Bank of Com
merce and sympathise with him and other
offlcera of the bank, who, they believe, did
"make tha fight of their Uvea" when the
Institution was threatened.
"The National Bank of Commerce waa the
only 'high fmanoo' bank on ih Missouri
river," said Victor B. Caldwell. In speak
ing of th institution.
But the bankera do not believe th "pro
motion" schemes of Dr. Woods wer as
much to blame for th failure of the bank
aa th high price paid to secure accounts,
which wer quickly withdrawn aa soon as

sion of coal dust In mines Nob. 6 and 8 of
tha Consolidated Coal company of Baltly
more, located on opposite Bides of the Mo
nongahela river at Monongah, aix nillea
from here, this morning, resulted In what,
from present reports, is Indicated to bo
the worst disaster in the history of th
coal mining Industry of .AmerkM.
The most conservative repot' place tho
number of men entombed by the explosion
at 500. and nearly all estlmatos, Including;
those of most of the coal company officials,
place the number at least Goo. Some esti
mates place the number even higher. About
1,000 miners are employed In the two word
ings and most of them, it la said, had en
tered the mine before the explosion oc
curred. Only five bodlea have been re
moved. Mining experts, a large corps of phys
Iclana and othera familiar with mining
matters, hold out practically no hope to
waiting friends that a single person tn tho
mine at the tlm of th explosion haa es
caped death.
The bodlea of three miners have been re
covered near the mouth of Mine No. 8.
Mine No. 8 Is located on the eaat aide of tha
West Fork river and Mlno No. S on tha
west side. How the explosion occurred
simultaneously in both mines cannot b
explained at this time.
All la confusion' at the scfno of tha dis
aster and definite inform at Ion la, meagre.
The explosion was heard for elirht miles.
Immediately after receipt of tb- news,
physicians and special cars were dis
patched from Fairmont to the scene. Th
min waa too full of gas and amok for
rescuers to enter. ' '
Spreads to Two Mines.
It la said the explosion started in No.
and spread to No. 8 mine, th two being
connected. Another report aaya the first
explosion was followed by the blowing up
of the boiler house In No. 8. The gravest
fears arc felt for the safety of the great
number of men In the workings.
Tho earth aeemed to be rent at the mo
ment of tha shock. Some Idea of Ihe fore
of the explosion may be gained from tho
fact that props, from the mine-were not
only blown out of the entry, but wer
burl.id by th force of It clear across tli
western fork of the Monongahela river.
Wires are down.
It is feared that th accident will turn
out to be the worat in the hlatory of min
ing inVhla country.
Superintendent Mnlone telophonea that of
the 600 men who wer in the mine at tho
Urn he doea not think any could eacapa
alive from th forces of the explosion.
The fens were started to clear out th
foul air and the rescuers were expected to
reach the men by 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Tha mine management declares they do
not Know the cause, but experienced min
ers declare that it must 'have been dust
Workings Lara oat in State.
The town of Mononagh haa a population
of about 8,000 and while for the moat part
the miners are of foreign birth, ther ar
still many American workmen. Possibly
the largest steel tipple In the state la
located at Mononagh. Tha mlnea are
both ahaft and alope mills, being worked
by the rope and haulage system. They lis
on both sides of the West Fork river and
are connected by a ateel pier brldjo
owned and operated by the coal company.
Until about ten yeara ago only American
mlnnra were employed. At that time tha
miner of Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois
and Ohio were on strike.
The coal company is on of th largest
companies of the kind In th country and
la capitalized at about $20,000,000. They hav
upward of 100 producing properties. Clar

Later It waa said the r.li'V party would
not reach the imprluoned men . before 4
o'clock. .Th rescuers include nine super
intendents, headed by Superintendent J. C.
Gasklll.
Special trains are ready to bring th'
wou.tded to the Miners' hospital her as
fast as possible. A hospital waa arranged
at the.- opening of the mine, wher Ui
wounded will receive attention.
Several tnen wer practically blown out
of mine No. 6 through an air hole. Their
escape was miraculous.
Twenty physicians from Fairmont ar
now on the grounds and every attention
Is being given the men. The mines did not
work yesterday. From best estimates 250
men were In each mine todav.
