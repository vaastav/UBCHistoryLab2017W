Christmas Stocking
J A Parody by FRANK J. BONNELLE
How dear to this heart la the stock
ing of childhood when fond recoV
lectlon presents it to view! On
Christmas St. Nick tame from frost
. whitened wildwood with every
loved toy which niy Infancy knew.
The wide spreading chimney, the ...
sled which stood by It, .a horse and
some books I remember them all-:
a doll for my sister, and baby house
nigh It, and then the full stocking
which hung on the wall the Santa Claus
stocking, the bountiful stocking, the
Chrlstnms morn storking which hung on
the wnll! The well stuffo;! envelope I
hailed as n treasure as early that morn
ing 1 opened my-eye and found ther
the source of an exquisite pleasure, the
purest and sweetest that nature supplies.
How ardent I seized It with hands th.it
were glowing and back to my white
sheeted lied went with all, then soon, '
with the emblems of love overflow
ing, was happy In what to my lot
did befall-the Santa Claus stocking,
the generous stocking, the Christ
mas morn stocking which bung on ,
the wall: - How sweat through
Its round open , top , to explore -
ft ' as - poised on my knee
If
t-nMncA to mv vlewl Not
hot, tempting breakfast could
-make me Ignore It for
longer at most than a
minute or two. And
now, far removed from the
loved situation, the tear
of regret will Intrusively fall
fanev reverts to my youth's
habitation . and sighs o'er the
stocking which hung on the' wall
, the Santa Claus stocking, the plethoric
stocking, the Christmas morn stocking
which hung on the wall! But grown people
And there's a later sensation as grateful as any they
felt long ago. It comes when they witness the glad
exultation which on Christmas morning their own off
spring show. And now, dear old Santa Claus, let me
petition your favor for children, both large ones and
small. Bring all the bright hopes to the fullest
tuition that rest In each stocking which hangs
on the wall the wealthy child's stocking,
the poor urchin's stocking; yes, fill
every stocking which hangs
on the wall!
TONY PASTOR AS SANTA.

ire breadwinners for younger broth
ers and sister. It was for them that
the late Tony Pastor and his wife,
Mrs. E. L. Fernshdex, and "Aunt
Louisa" Eldridge, now dead. Inaugu
rated the Christmas festival which
baa become t perennial affair.
The little ones, all less than twelve
years old, provide the stage entertain
ment on these occasions, and there
never Is any Interference by the au
thorities. Christmas, 1907, was Tony
raster's last appearance as the chil
dren'. Santa Clans, and this year they
will miss bis genial face and kindly at
tentions. Last year he was master of
ceremonies and Introduced his tiny
"top liners." At the end of the act be
presented to each of tbe girls beau
tifully dressed doll and to tbe boy.
' boxes of candy or appropriate toys.
Admission was by Invitation only,
and when tbe programme began the
house was crowded to the doors, the
balcony being given op largely to
poor children of the east side. Some
of tbe actors were mere babies, but
they went through the business like
veterans, and the gravity of most of
them when staging their comic songs
was Immensely amusing.

please. She came out with a Teddy
bear In her arms, sang a song and did
such clever capering that every wo
man In the audience wanted to bug
her.
Lillian Tobln, herself no bigger than
a doll baby, sang "Poor John" and In
vited the audience to join ber to the
chorus, which It did with a wlIL At
the end of the programme Mr. Pastor
announced that a banquet was await
ing the children . In the basement of
Tammany ball. .
After the little ones bad been satla
fied In that respect they were aent np
to the main ball of tbe building, and
there the really big feature of the
evening took place. On the atage
stood three Christmas trees, bending
over from the weight of pretty things,
while tbe stage Itself waa heaped with
toys.
After that there was a second dis
tribution for stage children only In the
committee room of Tammany hall
Most of the children bad written re
quests for certain articles, and aa tbry
appeared one by on and gar. name
corresponding with that on Mrs. Fer
nandez's list the present asked for wss

costly quality, having been port-based
with money donated to the cause.
Mrs. Fernande. said the children of
the stage nowadays ask for useful
things rather than' for plsythlngs.

NO chronicler of Christmas do

One might read the paragraph relating
to the observance of the holiday bajf
a hundred times and not become weary.'
Tbe ChrUtmaa spirit Is everywhere
evident In tbe chapters devoted to' the
holiday making. From tbe beginning,
when the hero, his three friends and
his faithful servant start for Dlngley
Dell, to the hour of their return there
Is Christmas In every sentence:
As brisk as bees, If not altogether as
light as fairies, did the four PlokwICkians
assemble on the morning of the S2d day
of December in the year of grace In,
which these their faithfully recorded ad-i
Ventures were undertaken and accom
plished. Christmas was close at hand In
all his bluff and hearty honesty. It was
the season ef hospitality, merriment and
opes heartedness. The old year was pre
paring. It'.te an ancient philosopher, to
call his friends around him and amid the
sound of feasting and revelry to pass
gently and calmly away. Oay and merry
was the time, and right gay. and merry
were at least four of the numerous hearts
that were gladdened by Its coming.

Of glory aeared In battle flames,

Of nameless death their dooms to seal.

A Christmas Sentiment
- Hswever sincere we may b In our
elorts to spread Cbristma. cheer, our
charity Is none the less a testimony
to our sens, of tbe fact that peace and
good will bar not com upon the
earth. Poverty and wretchedness ar
not to ba offset by yearly gifts of bas
kets of food and outgrown clothes.
We ought to make th spasmodic
kindliness of Christmas on of th
constant force, of our Industrial world.
Equality and fraternity ar born not
of charity, but of Justice.
