Washington. D. C. Dec' 7. Demand,
ing the restoration -of the American
flag to its ancient place upon the seas.T
President Taft. In hid annual message
delivered to Congress yesterday, urged
strongly that legislation be enacted
to establish a ship subsidy or other
wise guarantee the establishment of
the rapid development of merchant
marine in this country. The message
might be summed up in the following
trinity:
National economy, the enlargement
of opportunities for foreign trade and
the strengthening of confidence of
capital in domestic investment. The
entire message is a "safe and sane"
document, strong in its conservatism.
" The president's most urgent recom
mendation is in favor of legislation
for the institution of a mercantile
marine service and possibilities for its
expansion before the Panama canal is
finished and one paragraph of the
speech in this connection reads:'
"I alluded to this most important
subject in my last annual message.
Unless prompt action be taken' the
completion of the Panama canal will
find this the only great commercial
nation unable to avail in international
maritime business of his great contri
bution to the means of the world's
commercial Intercourse. Where could
we find in case of war the transports
and subsidiary vessels without which
a naval fleet is arms without a body?
For many reasons I cannot yrge too
strongly upon this Congress the pas
sage of a measure by mail subsidy or
other invention to develop the Amer
ican marine."
Next in the rank of Importance and
:3c i)rer the Monroe & Chamblisfc ; urged only a little less strongly than
the plea for a merchant marine is the
demand for the trained fighting force
i of the United States be increased by
j laws augmenting the number of com
j missioned officers and through closer
cooperation between the national
; guards of the various states and the
'regular standing army.
The president urges the fortification
of the Panama canal declaring that
America is building it and that it is
fitting that America should protect it.
Mr. Taft is anxious that the canal be
come a' paying enterprise, suggesting
that the toll of one dollar per net ton
be charged ships passing through.
President Taft takes a strong stand
in the matter of disposing of public
lands bearing coal, urging that the
government not sell these valuable
e4tle,

000.000.000 tons of coal. Mr. Taft de
clares in favor of making 2,500 acres
the maximum. He frankly admits
that Secretary Ballinger of the inter
ior opposes this plan; having set forth
his objections in his annual report.
The president believes that Congress
ought to prohibit interstate cojnmerce
railroads from owning or controlling
ships doing a business through the
canal, such a course being urged to
save the people of the United States
the benefit of legitimate competition.
This enactment must "come sooner or
later, the president points out.
The president deplores the abuse of
the postal franking privilege which is
annually, costing, the country millions
and demands that Congress take steps
to check it.
Declaring that the poor man has no
show in the courts against a rich op
ponent, Mr. Taft strongly urges that
changes be made in American court
procedure, especially in the apellate
branches, modeled, after the English
system.
Other recommendations and demands
include the following:
The abolition of "pork barrel" meth
ods in appropriating .money for the
construction of public buildings and
the institution of a commission to In
vestigate the necessity, of buildings
and report to Congress; increase pf
tariff commission from three members
to five; that Congress honor Com
mander Peary for discovering the
North Pole; conservation laws to save
forests from natural and humar rav
ages; immediate institution of parcels
posts;, steps to aid the proposed negro
exposition to celebrate the granting off
freedom; wider powers for the Inter
state Commerce Commission.
President Taft defends the Payne
Aldrich tarifT but declares that he will
likely send a message to the next Con
gress asking further revision.
