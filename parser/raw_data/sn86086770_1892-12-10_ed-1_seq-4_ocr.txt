JiiimiNO from reports from
Washington siiMM* the meeting of
cnrijjnni, the prospects for an extra
session mmhi after the 4th of March
next are brighter than they have
been at any previous lime. The
demand, however, will meet with
stubborn opposition from those
who are not in lull accoid with the
views id free-traders respe 'ting the
tariff, and there is a large number
of them in the victorious party. A
definite opinion can be formed soon
after the present congress gets
fairly to w 01 k.
Tiik subject of an income tax is
receiving ninth attention just now,
because it has been proposed as a
means for supplying revenue in
case there is a radical reduction of
the tariff. The country tried this
kind ol tax at the close of the war,
in and the trial was not satisfactory to
any bod}. It was regarded, and
with no little of justice, as an in
quisitorial scheme, and as directly
calculated to promote false swear
ing, since a man’s income is some*
tiling which ew hut himself know.
It is not tangible or visible. The
measure will not prove popular.
The President’s Message.
The last annual message of Presi
dent Harrison to congress will be
found in full in this issue of the
Thuujnk, and it will amply repay a
careful perusal. Like all the pre
ceding piq ers of the president it is
clear, explicit and comprehensive.
It , <resents i complete review of
the general > mdition of the oou ti
tty and the operations of the gov
ernment for the past year, and no-
where can so much information
respecting public affairs be found
in so compact a form. This is a
peculiarity <>f all of President Harri
son’.- stale papers, and they are for
that reason far more interesting to
the general reader than similar pa
pers usually are.
There are many subjects of un
usual importance and interest to the
public, that find instructive treat
ment in the message, notably the
silver question, statistics of the
material growth of the country and
of the commerce of the great
lakes. From these it appears that
the tonnage passing through the
Detroit river in about nine months
of the year is 21,034,000 —more
than double that of Liverpool and
nearly double that of London for a
whole year.
There is no deficit in the treasury
but a surplus of several millions.

Views of a Randall Democrat.
Inter Ocean.
Mr. Georg*.* Ticknor ( 'unis, win*
though he voted againt Cleveland,
is a Democrat, hut of the Randall
school, has, since the election, ad
dressed a letter to the American
Tariff League, in which he says
several things pertinent to the past
of Democracy and to the future- of
Republicanism.
Relative to Democratic action
concerning the tariff he says:
ily sheer misrepresentation ami by appeals
to the low prejudices of the so-called “poor”
against the so-called "rich” the present Demo
cratic leaders have persuaded Urr* majorities
or pluralities to go against the best Interest of
the Nation. '1 his shows how much the people
of this country still need to be educated
politically on this great public question. The
‘opposed ' poor” must learn to conquer their
1 'Cjudlces. They must learn that there is no
other country lu the world in wh:eh wealth Is
so generally diffused as it is in this; mid that,
properly speaking, we have no poor excepting
the paupers who are supported by private
charily or at the public expense, a man who
has a capacity to labor—who lias muscle, man
ual skill, intelligence, and experience in a
calling Is in a Just sense a capitalist. To call
him a "poor” man is to degrade him to the
level of the inmates of a workhouse. VTct
there are thousands and thousands who do not.
realize this, atm who allow the demagogues of
our land to treat them as If there were a
natural antagonism between them and the
classes who arch-ailed "rich.”
I know so well many of the men who foisted
the anti-protection plunk Into the Chicago plat
form that 1 have no difficulty in Judging of
their motives. They are not free trailers on
conviction. They went upon the principle
of "anything to heal the Republicans and gain
political |M)Wcr,” thereby manifesting a lack of
all principle. They raised the ialse cry that a
protective tariff is both unconstitutional and
undemocratic. They debauched the minds of
great numbers of people with false ideas, and
brought about this great polltcal change, to
the injury oftnevery voters whom they had
persuaded to 1 >tul themselves to their schemes'
I bis uMjitoKiioniibly is true, and
it is true nisi) that the tricksters
wiio “are not free traders in convic
tion,” hut who have been successful
in deceiving the peo| le, especially
the “so-called poor people,” into
believing what they themselves
knew to he nnirue concerning the
effect of | roteetion, now arc anxious
that the Republicans in Congress
shall save the I h inocrats in Con
gress from the necessity of fulfilling
the promises made in their National
platform, ami reiterated by their
newspapet sand orators during the
campaign. The 1 Icinooriiis are
pledged to a free trade policy, hut
arc anxious to avoid redemption of
their pledge. It Would suit them
admirably were they able to go to
the people in 1594 and 189(h*wilh a
pretense that they have been pre
vented from keeping their promise
“by the Republican majority in one
of the branches of Congress.”
lut, and as we think fortunately,
there is not likely to he a Republi
can majority in either branch of
Congress. Mr, Curtis, however,
thinks otherwise, and ways:
I notice that certain Republicans have ex
pressed he hope that the Democrats will Rain
a majority In the Senate so that the experi
ment of free trade can bo tried. They think
it will fall, and that the Republican party will
thus regain power, which they will thereafter
hold for a long course of years. I do not like
such laellcs. They l>ear to close n reset iblanee
to the tactics of your adversaries. They went
lor free trade in order to gain p.dltlcul power.
You are advised to go to; free trade, temp
oral lly. in order to recover the power you have
lost. I do not wish the experimen. c f free
trade to he tried for this or any other purpose.
This if not a country in which It should be
tried, lor it will inevitably result in in incalcu
lable loss of National and Individual wealth
and in great injury to the laboring people who
are employed in all kinds of manufactures.
We, no more than Mr. Curtis, de
sire “the experiment of free trade
to be tried in this country.” We
are as firmly convinced as he is that
the experiment will be attended
by almost unimaginable suffering,
especially to the “so-called poor,”
who under it will become the really
poor.
But it is not a question as to what
we desire. “Unsettled questions
have no pity on the repose of na
tions.” The tariff question must
be settled, and it seems as if it can
be settled only through the fiery
ordeal of a free trade experiment.
The unbounded prosperity that piu
tection bus brought to the country
hits not settled it. Demagogues
have told the people that the pros
perity is illusive, and the people
have believed them. Tricksters who
had no expectation of the possibility
of Democratic ascendency in ill
the co-ordinate branches of the
government have assured the peo
ple of wonderfully increased pros
perity under a Democratic policy of
free trade, and the people have be
lieved them. One taste of the
hitter draught that flows from the
free trade alembic will cause a de
sire to return to and permanently
abide by the cool, sweet waters of
protection.
It is not from desire Of temporary
victory in 181*4 or 181*6 that some
Republicans rejoice in the cem
pleteness of the Democratic ma
jority in Loth houses of Congress,
hut from drsire of such permanent
solution of the tariff controversy a
will take it out of party politics.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
From our regular correspondent.
Washington. I). C.. Dec. 5, !;!.
From the talk of Senators and
Representatives, many of whom are
already here, it is apparent that the
session of Congress which begins
to-day is to be much more interest
ing than had been generally sup
posed. Some Democrats are already
expressing the fear that the Re
publican Senate may take up and
pass the “pop-gun” tariff bills passed
by the House at the last session,
placing wool and other articles on
the free list, which, if signed by the
President, would make that Treasury
deficit, which Democratic success at
the polls has made a strong proba
bility for the next fiscal year, an
absolute certainty. The fears are
| however, groundless; the Republi
can Senators are too patriotic to
vote against their honest convictions
merely to add to the troubles, which
already promise to he great enough,
heaven knows, of the Democratic
administration and Congress.
Impecunious Congressmen are re
joicing over the prospect of the
presence of a big lobby in Wash
ington during this session, to fight
the bill which will be reported by
the Senate Committee on Immi
gration, providing for a suspension
of immigration for a period of one
year from March 1, 1893. Should
ltiin bill become a law it would
cauHe an immense loss to the Iran 8-
Atlantic steamship companies which
derive a very large revenue from
the immigration traffic, and it is
these companies which are organiz
ing this lobby, and which will
supply it witli all the money needed
to influence voles against the bill.
Another lobby will also be here,
indeed its advance agents are al
ready here, but its work will he
entirely with the Senate, which has
very few impecunious members,
consequently its presence does not
excite so much interest. It is com
posed of representatives of the
great grain ami cotton exchanges,
and is here for the purpose of pre
venting the passage of the anti
option bill, which passed the House
last session, and which Senator
Washburn has given notice that he
will call up in tin* S-mate and push
to a vote at the earliest opportunity.
A formidable number of Demo
crats aided by the the third party
members are working up a senti
ment in the House in favor of the
passage of a bill providing for an
income lax ar 1 they claim to have
gotten almost enough pledges to
secure its passage; but as Speaker
Crisp dominates the House commit
tee on Rules, and he is anxious to
curry favor with Mr. Cleveland,
who is opposed to an income tax,
and no lull opposed by that commit
tee can be brought to a vote in the
House, it is regarded as doubtful
whether the bill can be passed by
the House. It is certain that it
would not pass the Senate.
If the Democrats who are clamor
ing for an early extra session of the
Fifty-third Congress continue to
gain recruits at the present rale
Mr. Cleveland will find it difficult
to refuse their demands, whatever
he may think about it. Speaker
Crisp, although he professes public
ly to be undecided, is in reality
working as hard as he knows how
to bring about an extra session. It
is pure unadulterated selfishness
with him; he wants to be Speaker
again, and having been a Hill man,
he fears that if the election of
Speaker be postponed until the
regular session Mr. Cleveland will
have an opportunity to make com
binations that would result in the
election of a Cleveland Speaker.
The latest and most sordid argu
ment yet advanced for an extra;
session is that the Democrats could
then admit New Mexico and Ari
zona to Statehood and have four
more Democratic Senators at the
opening of the regular session mak
ing them independent of the votes
of the third party Senators.
