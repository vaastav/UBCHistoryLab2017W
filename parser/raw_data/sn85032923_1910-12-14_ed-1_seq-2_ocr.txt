fir months nf waiting, a young
woman residing at Schmidt, Hteven
county, Wash., will get her diamond
engagement ring, sent kr last July
by her fiancee, who at that time wa
a resident ef Cranbrtmk, R, fj. The
ring waa found baked lata a wed-
ling fake by Inspector William Hnt'
ehlnsoa of the customs service when
the cake vas sent throtiah the mall.
Nuspectlng that there wa something
amiss, the custom officials onened the
package, nnd after using a hatpin as
a proi. struck something hard, whleh
later proved to be the plush box stir
rounding the ring. Krer since that
time the lovelorn twain has been In
communication with the customs offi
cials, but It wa not until November,
30 that tho flue of 2i, which would
have been equal to the duty, waa nald
by the young man nnd tho ring ro-
leased. The ring nnd ease wer- sent
ont tit the young woman In the mails
by Deputy Collector J. M. Daniels as
soon as the fine was paid.
