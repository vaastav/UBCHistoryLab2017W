WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. — The only
rruatiure of importance which the senate
hub on its ia;enuar for the present week
is tile new Hay-Jfauncefote treaty, mak
ing i^rovision for the abiogation of the
CUyton-Buiwer treaty and opening the
W*y for the unobstructed construction of
Isthmian canai by the United States.
Acftng for the committee on fore.gn rela
tions, Senator L,ouge will ask tne senate
tv go into executive session tomorrow
for the consideration of the treaty and
(i.iy thereafter until the convention
is ui.sposed of.
It can be said that at this time the
ipect is very strong that the treaty
will be raatied, and it now looks as if
this result would be secured after com
uaratively little delay. There will be
• debate, and some features of the
<i<iunuiit will be criticised as undesir
able. but there is no probability of cap-
Uous opposition. The criticism will be
'• along the lines indicated oy Senators
ilijnty and iiacon, in the committee on
foreign relations, at its meeting on Fri
day last. No stnaior thus far, however,
has shown a disposition to carry his ob-
■.; jections to the point of ultimate effort to
!■■ ce:eut raiiticat.ion.~-iHe principal-autno.s'
ij of the criticism of the treaty are South.
--i trn" senators, who. are, i generally, very
", anxious for the construction of the canal.
.) They find that all canal legislation will
i be tied up until action can be secured by
the treaty, and they are, on this account,
5i less liable than they otherwise would be,
| to do anything to delay action upon the
.treaty itself. The most active friends of
1 the treaty now claim that ratification,
1 will be secured during the present j week,
■ and the opinion is very general that rati
; fication will be obtained before 'the
• Christmas holidays.
Reciprocity .Question Postponed.
V Beyond the consideration of the treaty
very little business will. be undertaken
before the holidays in the senate. It is
',_. now generally agreed that the question of
; reciprocity will go over until January,
I probably without so much being men
tioned, and it may be added that from
■' being for a time the;subject inosl likely
I to -attract early attention,, it has taken a
;: position among the matters which will
: not be vigorously urged. : _ ■'.-,
When the reciprocity treaties do come
up for consideration there will be per
'". sistent opposition to the agreement with
France, and to that with • Great Britain
covering the West Indies.
. There is not so much feeling over the
I conventions ,with South American repub
£ lies. The present outlook also is against
I any immediate action in the senate look-
I ing to tariff legislation for the Philip
is pines, and there are some indications
| that the senate will wait upon the house
I of representatives In this matter. Prob
) ably the Chinese exclusion act will be re
k ~ ported from committee during the week.
. The nomination of Attorney General
i • Knox will be; reported at the first execu-
I tive  session, but immedate confirmation
s probably will be . antagonized by some
» Eenators. ! • .

; of the large apartments of the cave.
' Tiicre were Other evidences that at some .
. time in a prehistoric period the cave was
inhabited; It is believed that an earth
quake, closed the entrance to the cave and
killed its inhabitants. The . formation of
stalactite and other natural decorations
throughout the cave are most beautiful.

FOREFATHERS' DAY.
Words of Eulogy for Those Who
Came Over in Mayflower.
"To sum up, I will write upon the ped
estal of their monument these wrords a3
most expressive and appropriate: 'To the
sublimity of a great conviction!' " Thus
did Rev. J. S. Montgomery last evening
close the services at Wesley M. E.
church, commemorative of Forefathers'
day, following it with a warm tribute to
President Roosevelt, as follows:
"And when, the other day, our presi
dent said Turn on the light,' referring
to the great trusts and combinations
which reach from one end qf this nation
to the other, h.s utterance was that of
a great- conviction, and God bless the
man who spoke the words."
It had been announced that Gov. Van
Sant. James Gra.v and F. M. Nye would
be the speakers upon this occasion, and
the promise of so much eloquence served
to fill the church io ovtruowuig. 'me
entire seating capacity of the great
structure was taxed, but it was not suf
ficient to accommodate the pe<sple, and
hundreds were turned away, while other
hundreds stood during the service.
Gov.' Van Sant sent word early in the
evening that he was suffering from a se
vere cold, but would try to come over
before the services were ended. He did
not appear, however, and the disappoint
ment of the audience was evident. The
remarks of all the speakers were in the
nature of eulog ■ s p Lhe patriot ban 1
who came to this county in the May
flower and left to their children and pos
terity a heritage of liberty and equality.
BISHOP M'GGLRICIv SPEAKS.
Large Andienee at the Church of the
Immaculate Conception.
Bishop James McGolrick celebrated the
feast of the Immaculate Conception by
pontifical mass at Church of the Immac
ulate Conception yesterday morning. In
tin afternoon he preached to the fifty
young women who were accepted into
the solidarity.
The- afternoon sermon was one of thi>
plainest and outspoken se'mons that has
ever been heard at the church. The
bishop referred to the dangers which sur
round the young woman on her start in
life. He believed t"hat as a result of
th<i abnormal commercial growth there
was at the present time a marked ab
sfnee in faith, lack of reverence for
things holy and an appreciation for the
higher things of life. One of the results
of this condition is a lack of proper
respect for woman.

SYDNEY, N. S. W., Dec. S.—By the
passage of the industrial arbitration bill
through its final stage the government
has placed a law upon the statute books
the working of which will excite interest
throughout the world.
This bill not only compels reference of
all disputes between employers and em
ployes to a competent court, with power
to enforce its orders and award, but
makes a strike or a lockout before" or
pending such reference a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine or imprisonment.
The court which will pass upon these
disputes is to be presided over by a judge
of the supreme court and will have most
extensive powers, including the power to
declare a standard wage and to direct
that, other things being equal, an em
ployer shall give preference to unionist
over non-union laborers. There is no ap
peal from the decisions of this court.

:- Hoi Lighten Big Bond
holders' Burden. -
In his weekly review of the conditions
in Wall street, Henry Clews says:
The Wall street situation is practically
unchanged. On. one side we see stocks
powerfully concentrated in a few hands
and an attempt made to raise values to a
still higher level by means of various
deals, by encoi; aging easy money and
by other artifices best known to skillful
manipulators. Continued prosperity and
large railroad earnings have afforded a
strong basis for such a movement, and at
the moment there are no signs of pro
nounced weakness, except the unsatis-
factory developments in Amalgamated
Copper, which have undoubtedly impeded
the efforts ior a renewed bull campaign.
The large interests are unquestionably
commiLtwd to the long side of the mar
ket; they have stocks to sell which the
public are slow to buy unless they see
more certainty of profit than has been
offered. Simple prosperity, some think,
has been amply discounted, and reliance
is now pften placed upon the effects of
deals which promise to increase the divi
dend capacities of certain securities. As
a result the market is strong only in
spots, and weak spells are not infre
quent. Had the market been allowed to
settle down last summer to a lower lovel
in natural response to the unfavorable
incidents which then occurred, we should
have had a recovery and activity during
the last two months which has been
notably absent. Th-e public has wisely
keep aloof from extensive commitments
on the long side, confining its activities
to quick trading; and this is likely to be
the safe course for some time to come,
or until natural influences once more as
sert their sway.
The situation in some respects is very
remarkable. Never before were stocks so
highly concentrated; and the steadying
power resulting from this process is high
ly significant. Apparently the powers in
control are able to hold the market im
pregnable against all ordinary assaults;
and while this situation lasts judgment
must be directed accordingly. At the
same time stocks are being slowly scat
tered, and the large sums of money seek
ing investment may enable the market
leaders to successfully lighten their bur
den if prosperity continues sufficiently
long; as some are bold enough to be
lieve it wili. But the business situation
is spotty. Great activity is apparent in
the iron trade where the physical revolu
tion in railroad standards Is causing an
abnormal demand for iron. There is also
great prosperity in the coal trade, and
an active demand at profitable prices for
many articles of food and clothing. Price
for these are the highest In ten years,
ard people are spending vastly more on
luxuries and commodities appealing to
aesthetic tastes than usual. Economy is
the exception and extravagance the rule,
and how long this will continue no one
knows. There are signs of reaction which
only the blind will not see, and they de
mand caution. We will soon begin to
visibly see the effect of the corn crop
failure and the consequent loss of freight
to lines traversing the corn belt. As a
result prices of cattle have risen ab
normally. Another blow is the shrinkage
in the cotton crop, which must adversely
affect important sections of the South.
High prices and scarcity are not con
ducive to continuous prosperity in spite
of a delusion to the contrary which some
people entertain. Still another unfavor
able feature has been the declines in our
exports, which, though perhaps not per
manent, indicate a cessation of the ex
cessive trade balances which have been
a fruitful source of self-congratulation.
Our exports of copper declined .about $23
--000,000 during the first ten months of 1901,
and our exports of iron manufactures
showed a loss of $24,C00,000 in the same
period. Such factors as these cannot be
ignored. They we signs of our being at
or near the top, and common prudence
dictates caution in transactions entering
into the future.
Those who anticipated a "strenuous"
message from President Roosevelt were
disappointed. The president's first mes
sage was a calm and conservative docu
ment, entirely free of radical or dema
gogical features. While his treatment of
disputed questions could not be expected
to please everybody, all agreed that his
recommendations were strictly within the
limits of safety. The financial communi
ty was chiefly interested on his utter
ances regarding trusts. These he treated
in a frank, judicial and temperate spirit;
and his ideas upon publicity, needless to
say, met with universal approval. If
such legislation as he suggests were now
in .force Wall street would be free today
from one of its worst uncertainties, and
Amalgamated Copper would not be the
scapegoat of the market. Many of the
trust evils would be self-corrective un
der reasonable publicity. The president
apparently left the currency question tc
his able secretary, Mr. Gage, who treats
this important problem with unusual
force and clearness in his annual report.
There is no domestic question of greate
importanee for congress to wrestle with"
than this one. The country needs a sci- '
entitle and automatic currency system in
keeping with modern progress. The
change can bast be made under pros
perous conditions. When reaction sets in
and credit contracts, prejudice and igno
rance will be more difficult to overcome
than now. Mr. Gage's remarks on the
currency should be thoughtfully read by
every well-wisher of his country.
The president's message is a pronounce. ''
ment upon the great affairs of the day '
which will meet with instant and hearty
approval both at home and abroad Its
eminent conservatism must dispel any '
apprehension of radical recommendations
tha.t may perhaps have existed among a
few. The president's attitude towards the
vast business interests of the country is
an earnest of sound judgment and thor
ough understanding. The interests of
labor and capital have alike and equally '
been considered. The policy of publicity :
in regard to the affairs of so-called
trusts is a very salutary reeommenda- i
tion which must carry with it the opinion I
of all fair-minded men. Tariff modifica- j
tion is very wisely confined principally
to the lines of reciprocity, in fact the
entire message may be said to be a guar
antee of stability and harmony in gov
ernment and foreign affairs, and hence
a promise of continued prosperity. The
executive and legislative branches of the
government, it is quite clear from the
message, are to act in harmony, not dis
cord, which is a most gratifying assur
ance to the business interests of the
country.
He Saved the Lamp.
An amusing scene occurred at the
docks yesterday. A Scotch engineer,
who wished to go ashore, ordered a boy
to show him the way with a lantern. As
the boy was crossing the narrow plank
that served as a gangway, he slipped and
fell into the water. The instinct of the
true Scot instantjy showed itself. "Hold
on to the lamp, boy!" he shouted, lean
in? over toward the water. "Do you
hear? If it's lost, there Is 5 shillings
gone from your wages." After some
time the boy was rescued; half drowned
but clinging to the lamp. As some com
pei.sstion for his trouble he was forgiven
for losing the bottom of it.—London
