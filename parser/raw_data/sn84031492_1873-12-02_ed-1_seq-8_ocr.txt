WASHINGTON.
(Continued from Iho First Faye.)
former Congress, was a member in this
Committee, and found there scope for
utilising his abilities. Ho is opposed by Leon
ard Myers, of Philadelphia, who la at present
the oldest member of tho Committee, and has
served for twelve consecutive years. As ho
possesses high qualifications, it In dif
ficult to say, in view of his long-continued
and effective service, why ho should
bo sot aside for Mr. Ortii, nml thoro is the best
reason for believing that ho will not bo. The
impression is rapidly gaining ground that Blaine
Is working from a sincere desire to promote tho
.public service in making up his committees,
and that ho . will not allow nuy
other considerations to iullncnoo him. Tho be
lief that ho will adopt tills manly course has had
a perceptible effect on public feeling, and it is
apparent that Blaine slock has greatly appro
elated iu tho Inst few days.
GARFIELD STOCK ADVANCING.
For a day or two past there has been a moat
persistent effort to induce tho belief that
Qartlold alone , of all those who
wore implicated in tho Oredit-Mohilior would bo
set back and humiliated. This effort is hard to
explain, as Mr. Oarilold is certainly a good a
man as any of tho others who wore implicated
In tho Oroult-MoMUor scandals, and tho effort
to make him tho sonpo-goat was a cowardly con
ception. Thoro Is no doubb that ha
will ho again placed at tho head of the Appropri
ation Committee, ad Blaine has refused to per
mit himself to bo used in so moan a way, *
A ROW AMONG TIIK DEMOCRATS.
There is a serious rupture iu tho Democratic
ranks.” Holman, Cox, and others equally prom
inent, mean business when thoy refuse to in
dorse the back-pay feature of tho increase
of salaries bill, and although active efforts nro
making to bring about a reconciliation, thoro in
no rcaaou to believe that thoy will bo successful.
The feeling is strong and deep; and the position
in. which tho Democrats find thomsolvos is n
novel ono for them. Those voting for
Cox for Speaker to-day were Messrs.
Holman, of. Indiana, and Wbltohouso, of Now
.York. Blaud, of Missouri, voted for Alexander
It. Stephens; and Creamer, of Now York, voted
for Hoistor Clymor, of Pennsylvania. There
was some Democratic dodging on tho vote for
. Speaker.
A nEPUm.TOAN CAUCUS.
Tho Republicans of tho Houso bold a caucus
to-night to deliberate and decide upon a policy
■with regard to tbo repeal of tbo back-pay anil
incrcaso-of-salary law. Tho attendance was quite’
full, and tbo proceedings.-while they wore not om
hclllshed with tbo highly personal order of re
marks that characterized theDomocrntic caucus,
of Saturday night, wore of a very earnest and
absorbing.nature. It appears that it was thought
necessary to call this caucus to order, in tho first
place, to unite on some plan and course of ac
tion ; and, secondly, to head off a largo number
of virtuous gonlomoa who aro inclined to bo
precipitate in reform.
FIGHTING FOB Till} HONOB OP REPEALING THE
SALARY DILL.
It.is not proposed that tho glory of introduc
ing a bill for tbo purpose indicated, shall bo mo
nopolized by any ouo individual, but rathor it is
thought best that it shall redound to tho credit
of ‘ tho whole patty. ’ Eugene Halo,
•of Maine, gave considornclo offence to
day when ho notified tho House of
his purpose to introduce a bill to-morrow or
and the first opportunity to effect tbo repeal, as
it was thought no was too ambitions, if not a
little'selfish, This being tbo State of affairs,
. there was nothing to do to-night except to
ogroo on plans to bo adapted, and tbo opposi
tion te the action was but feeble, although
there was considerable sudpreused fooling,
which at times threatened to break out
in open squabbling. Bon Butler, hacked by
Roderick iiaudim Butler, from Tennessee, was
recognized os tbo leader of
ANTI-REPEAL FACTION.
It was noted with considerable surprise that tho
General didn’t display that nonchalant and defi
ant swagger, while discussing tbo affair, that ho
assumed while troatiogit in Massachusetts during
tho vacation. If bis convictions as to tho right cous-
Doas of increased book-pay have not changed,
they certainly have as to tho temper of the
people. He was dignified to a. degree, there
fore, and only occasionally ho permitted his
characteristic stylo of debate to show
itself, and then in modified utylos. It is
said that he was disposed in his remarks to
treat of Eugiuo Halt as a son-in-law cf his
father-in-law, and to otherwise disparage that
young gentleman, hut, on the whole, ho curbed
himself in a manner which did exceeding credit
to his sagacity.
COLORED DELEGATES OPPOSED TO THE REPEAL.
Throe of the nix colored Representatives,
headed by Bacnoy, of South Carolina, made a
hold light against any repeal, hut, while they
wore heard in an indulgent and patronizing way,
the weight that was given to what they said wae
not such as they would have liked from the groat
Badical party.
THE ADVOCATES OF REPEAL.
Hasten, of lowa, Tromaino, of Now York,
and Hawley, of Connecticut, were prominent in
urging tbo policy of repeal. It was put to the
humanity of the caucus, that in any action that
might b< bad, nothing ought to bo done that
would rofioct at all upon tbo many truly good,
but misled gentlemen, not now members of
Congress/ who took their back-pay, end
inserted it in a judicious manner. Groat circum
spection was urged in this regard. TUo Qua!
result.was the
, t , . APPOINTMENT OP A COMMITTEE,
consisting of Kussou, Halo, of Mnino, Tre
maine, Butler, of Massachusetts, aud Thomas,
of North Carolina, to prepare a bill reducing
salaries to 35.000 a year, duo regard being had
to such a restoration of tho franking privilege
in documents and garden-seeds, provisions be
ing made to secure an allowance for postage for
other purposes, stationer}', aud mileage, such ns
will .bring tho pay up to tho amount received by
members of tho Forty-first Congress, which will
substantially sot it back at tho old figures. The
bill is to bo reported to-morrow if occaoion offers
aud tho time nob taken up with questions uf
privilege Blaine will announce tho morning
hour ; and the call of States will be had.
HALL TO. INTRODUCE THE RILL.
Tills will give Hall nn opportunity to introduce
ibo bill. In ease ho should die to-night,-the out
look for tho Republican party would bo very
gloomy, as an unrogonernto 'demand from Now
Hampshire, tho next Btuto to bo called, would
most surely grasp the situation, and introduce a
bill himself. This, however, was fully consid
ered, and tho contingency provided for by tho
adoption of tho resolution submitted by Kelly,
of Pennsylvania, that all other matters than this
.bill shall be at once referred to tho Judiciary
Committee. Only two or throe faint votes w&ro
heard in tho negative, when the final action was
bad.
the'repurltcan senatorial caucus

MR. ROUTWELL’fI, REPORT.
Tho report of tho Boorotary of tbo Treasury
is quite twice as long us any of tho previous
documents of similar character. Judge Richard

Treasury, aud at tho same time it is
materially different in general make
up, . being entirely of a business
character, making numerous Highly important
recommendations, giving minute description and
accounts of the workings of tho Treasury De

of tbo report has been made by tho Assistant
Secretary, Sawyer, for prompt transmission by.

HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
OAT,PINO TUB ROLL.
Washington, Deo. 1.— I Tho House was called
to order at noon by Mr, McPherson, tho Clerk,
who called tho roll of members by Slates. The
f;allorics woro orowded, and most of tho seats in
ho hall woro occupied.
CONTESTED BEATS.
When Louisiana was reached, tho Clerk stated
that there wore but two unchallenged certificates
received from that State—those of Messrs. Dar
rall and Morey, from tho Third and Fifth Dis
tricts. As to tho other three districts, and tho
member for tho Btato at largo, thero had boon
two conflicting sots or papers received, both is
suing from competout authority, ono sot signed
by Gov. Warmoth, and tho other by Acting-
Governor Pinohhaok. Tho Clerk had, there

THE. CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1873.
could not l»o accepted by tlio Olork, ae thoy wore
not iu accordance with the law, and, therefore,
there wan no person enrolled for that district.
For four seats from Arkansas there had boon but
two certificates presented,—those of Svndor and
Ilinos.. In regard to tho State of West Virginia,
there wns a peculiar complication arising from
tho uncertainty ns to tho proper time of holding
Aiuolootion. There had boon two elections held,
on two different days, and different porfions
wore elected from two districts. In tho other
district tho same person had boon elected on both
occasions, and therefore tho Olork had enrolled
that person (Hereford), hut had not enrolled any
of tho others.
Tho roll having been called, it appeared that
278 members, of iho 200 who are entitled to
scats, answered to tbeir names.
ELECTION OP SPEAKER.
Tho House then proceeded to tho election of a
Sneaker. Mr. Maynard nominated James G.
Blaine. Mr. Nihlack nominated Fernando

1. Mr. Blniuo was inorofoio declared . duly
elected Speaker of the House of Representatives
for the Forty-third Congress. Messrs. May
nard and Wood conducted Mr. Blaine to the
chair.
ADDRESS or SPEAKER BLAINE. 1
Mr. Blaiuo, upon taking iho chair, made the
following address:
Gentlemen of the Jlomtof Jlexyreeenlativee:
Tho veto this moment announced by tho Olork Is
such an expression of your confidence as calls for nty
Blnceroat thanks. To ho chosen Speaker of the Ameri
can House of Representatives Is always an honorable
distinction; to no chosen a third lime enhances the
honor moro than throe-fold; to bo chosen by tho
largest body that over assembled m the Capitol imposes
a burden of responsibility which only your indulgent
kindness could etnboldeu mo to assume.
Tho first occupant of this obnlr presided over a
Uouhc of elxty-fivo members, representing a popula
tion far below the present aggregate of the State of
New York. At that time, In tlio whole United Staton
tbero wore uot CO,OOO civilized inhabitants to bo
found 100 miles distant from the flow of the
Atlantic tide. To-day, gentlemen, a largo ma
jority of you como from' beyond that limit,
ami represent districts then peopled only by tho
Indian and tbo adventurous frontiersman. Tho Na
tional Government Is not yot as old as many of its citi
zens: but in ibis liriof span of time, leas than ono
lengthened life, it lias, under God’s good providence,
extended its powers until a continent Is tho field of its
empire nud attests tho mojeaty of its law.
■With tbo growth of new Utalos, and (ho resulting
changes iu tho centres of population, now Interests are
developed, rival to tho old, but by no means hostile; di
verse, but not antagonistic. Nuy, rnthor are all these
interests in harmony; and thotruo science of just
government is to give to each its full and fair play,
opposing uono by undue exaction, favoring none by
undue privilege. It is this great lesson which our
daily experience is teaching uh, binding us together
moro closely, making our mutual dopendeuco moro
manifest, aud causing us to feci, whether wo live In
the North or In tho South, lu tho East or in tlio West,
that wo have indeed but “ ono country, ono Constitu
tion, ono destiny.”
OATHS ADMINISTERED.
Mr. Dawes, senior member of tho Honso, ad
ministered the oath of olllce to tho Speaker, who
thereupon proceeded to swear in the members.
About fifty members from Southern Slates, who
could not take tbo oath of ofilco which Is known
as ** tbo ironclad," took tbo modified oath.

DELEGATES FROM TERRITORIES

ing that Cannon bad taken an oath inconsistent
with, citizenship and with- his obligations as a
Delegate, and has been, and continues to be,
guilty of practices in violation and defiance of
tho laws, referring to the Committee on Elec
tions tho question of Cannon’s right to a scat.
Mr. COX opposed tho resolution, as tending to
establish a very dangorouu precedent. Hero was
a prima fade caso, with a regular certificate
from tho Governor of Utah. Ho moved that
the delegate bo sworn in.
Tho resolution was further opposed on tho
samo ground by Gon. Butler, ami G. F. Hoar,

INDIANA ELECTION OASES.
The certificate for tho Ninth Indiana District,

Wliat Bishop Cummins Says of Mis
fVcvv Church Movement.
Special Dispatch to.The Chicago Tribune,
New York, Deo. I.—Tho mooting called by
Bishop Cummins to organize a Protestant Epis
copal Church, on tho basis of tho Prayer-Book of
1785, will bo hold in Association Hail at 10 a. m.
to-morrow. Tho object of this gathering is not
for tho discussion of tho oxpodiouoy of such a
movement, and tho call is not therefore issued to
thoso who aro opposed to such a course. That
a beginning will bo mado to-morrow is quite cer
tain. Bishop Cummins staled to-day that thoso
who arc resolved upon separation from tho
Protestant Episcopal Church as it is, have con
sidered their cauoo well,, fully appreciate their
responsibility, and simply wish to perform
their duty in the. matter in • a
quiet aud unostentatious way. It -iu
cany to parade a largo number of names, hold
public meetings, and have brilliant orators; They
prefer a different course. While they wish noth
ing whatever to ho concealed, they will make as
little noise as passible, and transact business,
rather than attempt to draw crowds. Tho move
ment, Bishop Cummins says, is to a groat extent
confined to tho l&itv. There is a ro&puctablo
number of clergy enlisted, but in assuming such
responsibility they have more difficulties ko en
counter, and, therefore, require greater courngd.
They must bo prepared to give up thoir living,
and be stigmatized ns enthusiasts or fools. Tho
laity, however, are In earnest, and aro push
ing tho matter wltii becoming zeal, many
of thorn being among the older members of tho
Church, who havo hud knowledge of tho abuses
of tho Church for years. This new paity holds
very much tho saroo position toward tho Angli
can Church that tho Catholics do to tho ChuroU
of Borne. They think had the prayer
book of 1785 been retained, ritualism
could not have advanced so rapidly.
They are not destroyers, but restorers
of tho true principles of their communion aud
service. The movement toward that has boon
going on iu tho Church for years, is powerful,
and those who aro opposed to it must consider
their responsibility, and resolve upon sonjo
action to prevent such misfortune. Some plan
will bo adopted to-morrow to unite such men.
New York, Deo. I.—The Bight Bor. B. B.
Smith, D. D., Bishop of Kentucky, has issued a
paper announcing that Dr. Cummins will bo
tried for violation of See. X, Canon 0, Title 2,
and saying any Episcopal act of Ids, pending his
trial, will no null and void.' All znemnors of. tho
ChuroU aro enjoined to give no countenance to
tho movement in which Dr. Cummins is en
gaged.

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
The Social Evil Ordinance In St. f.ouln
Declared Consliimloiml l>y the Su
preme Court of tho State—The Iliglit
of tho Legislature to Decide upon
Questions of Expediency Affirmed. .
flpwtal Dtepateh to The Chicago U'ribune,
St. Louib, Doc. I. —Tho Social Evil law hao
been declared to-day constitutional by tho Su
preme Oourt of Missouri, two Judges of tho
flvo on tho Bench dissenting. Tho decision first
argues tho question whether tho city had power
to pass tho existing ordinance under tho charter,
which expressly gives permission to rogulato and
suppress.
THE LEOISIATOIIE’a IUOIIT TO CnANOB COMMON
Having decided this point in tho affirmative,the
Court goes on to say that tho Legislature have a
right to change tho common law; it lias a right
to allow tho legislative authorities of Sf. Louis
to regulate the subject now under consideration
differently from what it is in the other portions
of the State. It is a naked assumption to say
that any matter allowed by tho Legislature is
against public policy. Tho host indication of
public policy is to bo found in tho enactments
of a Legislature. To say that such
a law la of Immoral tendency ia
disrespectful of tho Legislature, who
no doubt designed to promoto morality, and
it is altogether unwarranted to suppnuo that tho
object of tho law or tho ordinance is for any pur
pose but to promoto tho mcralu and health of
thocilizons.
the xvisnoa or the obdinance tobeiok to the
discussion.
'Whether tho ordinance in question is calcu
lated to promote tho object, is a question with
which tho courts have no concern; with tho ex
pediency, or propriety, or wisdom of aloglulativo
enactment wo have nothing to do. If a consti
tutional right is infringed, tho courts are open
to afford redress. Wo have no opinion, and
therefore express none, about ibo expediency of
this ordinance. Arguments on that point should
bo addressed to tho Stale or City. Legislature.
It would bo a novel exercise of judicial power
to pass cm tho expediency of legislative enact
ments—a matter outsido of tho province of
courts of justice. Tho only question wo. have to
decide Is, whether tho power existed to make
tho law ; and wo think the Legislature granted
tho power.
THE LAW NOT VOID BY UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROVI-
SIONS.
If there "are provisions in this ordinance.
Chapter 13, which infringe on tho rights of
citizens, male or female, protected by the Con
stitution and laws of tho State, and such
provisions are attempted to ho en
forced, tho remedy is obvious. Even
according to tho caso referred to in 1 Gray, it is
not pretended that unconstitutional provisions
in a law make it totally void. On the contrary,
it is well settled that they do not, and that a law
may well stand, as far as it is constitutional,
although it has in it certain provisions which arc
not valid; and in this case the only question
was, whether tho defendant’s license, under tho
ordinance, was a protection. No question con
cerning tho medical examination provided in cer
tain sections of thoordlnanco arose; no complaint
on this subject was made by any one affected by
tho provisions said to bo oppressive and In op
position to our bill of rights. It was, in fact,
conceded that various provisions of the ordi
nance wore entirely unexceptionable so far ns
the State Constitution was concerned, and It was
only insisted that the
GENERAL INTENT AND SCOPE OF THE ORDINANCE
was to promote immorality. Of this wo are not
authorized to judge. Tho legislative authorities
of St. Louis nro more competent and better
qualified to decide this question than this or any
other court. Wo doubt not that their
intention was to promote tho public morals.
Whether tho ordinance in question
was tho best mode of doing this, was a matter
they woro authorized to docldo. This Court has
no power to revise thoir decision on this Ques
tion; it is a legislative, not a judicial, ques
tion.
Judgo Napton gavo. tho decision, Judges
Adams and Wagner concurring. Judges Vorles
and Bhorwood submitted the dissenting opinion.
(To the A teoeiaUd Preen.}
St. Louis, Deo. I.— Throe Judges of tho Su
premo Court—Napton, Wagner, and Adams—
gavo a decision to-day in tho somewhat famous
social ovil case, which was tried hero some
months ago, and in which Judgo Oolviu decided
tho Social Evil ordinance in force in this city
unconstitutional. The principal point before
the Supremo Court was, whether tbo Legisla
ture had power to grant tho City of St. Louis
authority to rognlato or suppress bawdy-houses,
in the face of tho general State law which re
quires tho suppression of such bouses. Tho
Court decides the Legislature had such power,
and therefore reverses tho decision of Judge
Colviu, of the lower court. Judges Vorles and
Sherwood dissent.
