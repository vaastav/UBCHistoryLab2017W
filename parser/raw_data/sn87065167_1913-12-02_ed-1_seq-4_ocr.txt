THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
President Wilson's message delivered to Congress at noon today may
be found in full in this paper.
Every man and woman who would keep
It is a great state paper,
abreast with public thought, should read it; carefully, thoughtfully, studious
ly; because it is the great thought of of a great mind.
The message being given in full, and not too long to read, it is not
necessary that it should be reviewed; but its salient features may be re
peated.
Its perfect candor is one of its most striking features. The President
talks to Congress, and through Congress to the country, in the simplest
language and most direct terms he coould possibly employ,

ind. so full of road brotherly love, that upon every subject touched it
■o
carries conviction with it.
'.With all his broadness and kindness, he does not mince matters. He
does not hesitate or fail to call Gen. Huerta a "usurper." "There can be no
certain prospect of peace in America," he says, "until Gen. Huerta has sur
rendered his usurped authority in Mexico. Until it is understood on all
hands that such 'pretended' government will not be countenanced or dealt
with by the Government of the United States."
"Mexico has no government," he says. "The attempt to maintain one
at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism
has been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national au
thority. It originated in the usurpation of Victoriano Huerta, who, after a
brief attempt to play the part of constitutional President, has at last cast
aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself dictator. As a
consequence, a condition of affairs now exists in Mexico which has made it
doubtful whether even the most elementary and fundamental rights either of
her own people or of the citizens of other territory can long be successfully
safeguarded and which threatens if long continued to imperil the interests
of peace, order, and tolerable life in the lands immediately to the south of
ns. Even If the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, in despite of the con
stitution of the Repulic and the rights of its people, he would have set up
nothing but a precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a
little while, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a
more deplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has
forfeited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at
one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has been completely
isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and
the collapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be obliged to altar
our policy of watchful waiting. And then, when the end comes, we shall
hope to see constitutional order restored in distressed Mexico by the
concert and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the liberty of their peo
ple to their own ambitions."
He begs that "the whole energy- and attention of the Senate be concen
trated upon the banking and currency bill until it is successfully disposed
of." He favors enlarging the scope of the Agricultural Department

handle their product. He thinks "all thoughtful observers will agree that

prevented." This he says is a subject so many-sided and so deserving of
careful consideration that he will give a special message to Congress

The platform upon which Mr. Wilson
was nominated and elected declares specifically against a second term.
There is a manifest desire in Democratic ranks, and in independent ranks
well, to see Mr. Wilson succeed himself. But the question that confronts
his friends, is "how to get around the platform." If there should be Presi
dential primaries, there would be no nominating convention; and if the
people, in their sovereign capacity preferred Mr. Wilson to "the field," no
platform declaration could stand In their

"1 * urn 1° a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and without
serious controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nominees
for the Presidency of the United States. I feel confident that I do not misin

enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections through
out the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their
nominees for the Presidency without the intervention of nominating

con
I venture the suggestion that this legislation should provide
the retention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring
and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the platform
of the parties; and I suggest that these conventions should consist not
of delegates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for

'
this wife and mother, only 23, scarcely
more than a girl, stayed in the home
with her tw-o little boys, her soul torn
with the anguish of uncertainty. Gen

It rained and he asked permission to

gave it. They filled the house, cook

could.
"With the guileless craft of sweet
and loving women. Becky made a lit

to dine with her, and W'hen he had
broken her bread and was under the
influence of dainty courtesies and the
charm of his hostess, she pleaded
with him to permit the return of her
husband, upon the solmen assurance
that while his sympathy was with the
South, he was not actively arraigned
against the government, and that his
services as a physician were needed.
"The young wife's prayer was grant

her husband came home, but only saw

Kansas City, Dec. 2.—Opposition
from the board of public welfare to the
dancing of the tango and other so
called new dances caused the aban
donment of the charity ball, an an
nual event participated in since 1896
by the leading society folk of Kansas
City.'
Miss Mary Karnes, president of the
Mattie Rhoades Memorial Society, in
charge of the ball, said the society had
decided to abandon the project because
of the "impossibility of getting our
patrons to give up the new dances."
The college ball, another social
event, waB cancelled for the same
