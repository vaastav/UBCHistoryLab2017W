How to Cura St&mmerinff.
A correspondent of the New York Sun
gives the following cure for stammering:
1. Draw a long breath, and divide the
lentence you wish to speak into syllables,
and make a motion for each syllable by
bringing the index finger and thumb of
the right hand together.
2. Have confidence in yourself, and do
not be embarrassed io the presence of
Btrauttcrs.
3. Read some good poetical work, like
Milton's Paradise Lost, or Pope's Homer's
Iliad, slowly, taking caro to draw a full
breath at the end of each second line.
4. For further instructions I refer to
Dr. Colon) bat de I'lsere's "Treatise on all

Hayes' First Annual Message.
We present to our readers, in to-day's
issue, the President's message to Congress,
which is quite lengthy and treats of several
important national topics. '
The President very naturally opens up
with a presentation of what he has done in
regard to his so-called Southern policy,
and felicitates himself that it has worked
well, that the Southern States have peace,
and that the industries of that section of
the Country are being developed in a man
ner truly encouraging. ,
As a further step in the development
of this great ''conciliatory policy" he adds
a few expressions of exalted, and paternal
advice to "those to whom heretofore the
"colored people have sustained the relation
of bondmen," to legislate kindly in their
behalf, and to avoid treating them in any
manner which shall contravene their en
joyment of every constitutional right; and
expresses the belief, that this being done,
the restoration of harmony will surely be
attained and the bloody shirt be forever
baried.
His intention to use all his authority to
this end he declares is very earnest, ad
he invokes tbe cordial co-operation of
everybody else, including the obdurate
Republican Senators aud the potent host
of Post-Masters, to assist him in his glori
ous work. With the elimination of this
political "Banquo" from the arena of na
tional contention he feels assured "we
"may safely hope to hand down our free
"institutions of the government unimpaired
"to the generations that will succeed us.'!
Having pointed out the way in which
the salvation of the Country may be effect
ually attained, and the manner in which
the dangers that have so omioiously threat
ened tbe tranquility and prosperity of the
Country under his immediate predecessor
may be avoided, he passes from this
transcendent topic to the consideration of
such minor subjects, as Resumption,
Remonetization of Silver, Civil Service
reform, foreign relations, Indian affairs,
and tho blessings of common school educa
cation. In regard to resumption his views are
positive and out spoken; "the policy of re
"sumption should be pursued by every
"suitable means and no legislation would
"be wise that woulddisparage the import
"ffDce or retard the attainment of that re
sult." To alleviate the rugged hardship
of such an apparently stern necessity as
absolute resumption might prove, and to
sotten the rigor ot such an ultra measure,
he concedes that it might perhaps be well
to remonetize fiiver to some extent, but
not to make it an unlimited legal tender.
He thinks that the use cf silver to some
extent would probably afford material
assistance to specie resumption. The
great bondholding interests are comforted
with the presidential opinion that the
National debt was contracted to be paid
in sold and not in silver. V hat particular
comfort the debtor classes can derive from
the President's views are not so easily
eeeD, especially when we note his recom
mendation to increase the tax on tea and
coffee, articles which this country does not
produce, and a reduction of tax upon such
things as the country does produce.
The Presidents remarks upon the sub
iect of education are all well enough in
their way, and of no special consequence
as a matter of national concern. Tbe
topic itself has been talked about, essayed,
reviewed and expounded, until it is trite
and common place even to barrenness. If
virtue, honesty, morality, and integrity in
the administration of public affairs, kept
even pace with the efforts made for the
general diffusion of common school educa
tion, the ordinary annual cackle and
clamor set up in its beha.f would present
more interesting features, and have much
greater claims upon public attention than
is now the case.
So much of the message as pertains to
the Presidents "Southern policy" will
probably receive a fuller and heartier en
dorsement from those who voted against
him for President, than from the
majority of his party. His views
upon the financial questions of the day
are neither new, nor presented in
any striking mammer, and the division of
public sentiment, irrespective of party
which prevails throughout the country
upon that Bubjcct, will not be likely to
be materially influenced or affected by
anything the message affords. As to the
foreign policy of the country, there is very
little doubt the President will be warmly
sustained by the great mass of tbe people
in any line of action which vindicates the
national honor, or affords national protec
tion and security. The use of tho army
and navy for the riurpoee ol repelling ag
gressions of an eteuiy and compelling an
honorable peace, is, and always will be, in
accordance with patriotism and the spirit
of the nation. Their use for the purpose
of state police, and the upholding of false
and spurious local governments, we sin
cerely trust has forever passed away; and
the recognition of this fact by the Presi
dent we consider one of the wisest and
best acts of his administration.
