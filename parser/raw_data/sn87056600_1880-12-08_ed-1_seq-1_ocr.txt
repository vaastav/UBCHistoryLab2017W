Annual Message of tli President of the
United States, to the Two Houses of Con
Kress, at the Court nienrement of the Third
Sesaion of the Forty-Sixth Congrress.
I :i i.i.ow-ctizf.ns of the Sknate and Hoi ok
Rkprksf.statives:
I congratulate you en the continued and in
creasing prosperity of oar country. By the favor
of Divine Irovidence we have been blessed,
during the past rear, with health, with abundant
harvests, with profitable employment ior all our
leopIe. and with contentment at home, and with
peace and friendship with other Nations.
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of
Chief Marktrate has afforded auntheropiavrtunity
li the people of the United States to exhibit to
the world a significant example of the peaceful
and safe transmission of the power and authority
of Government from the public servants who.
terms of office are about to expire. 4o their newly
chosen successors. This example can not fail to
impress profoundly, thoughtful people of other
countries with theadvantages winch Itei'ul.lican
intitutions att'ord. The immediate, general and
cheerful acquiescence of all kin1 citizens in the
result of tlie election give trntif yin assurance t4)
our country, atid to its friends throinthotit the
worM. that a Government ba-sed 01 the free con
sent of an intelligent and patriotic people nos
.scses dements of htren;th. nubility, a!d p nia
iier.cy nt found in any other form of Govern
ment. Continued opposition to the full and free enjoy
ment of the rights of citizenship, conferred upon
the colop.sl fH.'oj)le bv the mtnt ameiidments to
the ( on.stitution, stiil prevails in several of the
late slave holding States. It lias, jx-rhaps, not
leen nianii'estel iu the rwcut election to any
Uree extent in acts of iolcnce or inthnidatlon".
It has. however, by fraudulent practices in "on
tiecti.m w ith the ballots, with the regulations as
to the places and manner of voting, and with
"utmtinjr. retuniinsi. and canva'-siiiK the votes
cast, U'cn successful in defeatini: the exercise of
the riiflit preervaive tf all riirlits. the riIit 0
sutfruRe. w hich the Constitution expressly con
fers njswi our enfranchised citizens.
It Is the desire of the kihmI people of the w Iiolc
country that sectionalism as a factor in onr oli-ti-s
shouM o"iappejir. They prefer that no sec
tion of the country should be united in solid
pxsitioti to any other wction. The disjiosition
to refuse a prorc. jt and hearty oliedience to
the eual risrhts amoniinienta to tlie Constitution,
is all that now stands in the way of a complete
obliteration of sectional lines in our jKilitical
contests. As long a either of thsf amendments
is tliit;riitly violated or disregarded, it is safe 10
assume tliat the spl- who plat-d them in the
f on-titution. us emlsMlyin the legitimate resulw
of the war ior the L"ni"n, and w ho Uicc them
to be w ivc and necessary, will continue to act to
gether, a-.id t insi.-t that ihev shall be oieyet.
The paramount question still is, as to theenjoy
Tient of the rieht by every American ritien who
has the rejuiite qualitieatioiis, to fnt-lycast his
vote and to have it honestly countcl. ith thfcs
uesli(;ti rightly settled, the country witl be n-
lievcil of the tontcuiioiis of the past: l'ysones will
inbel le bysones; and jMilitical and party issues
with it H-ot (t rennnmy and efficiency f nimiil
istrutiou. internal improvements, the taritt'. do-
racti, taxation, education, finance, and other
important su!je-u. will then recieve their full
i"hre of nitentton; but resistance to
niul nii√ºitlcalion of the results of
the war. will unite together in resolute purpose
for their support all who maintain the authonty
f the Government and the crpetui:y of tlie
Union, and w ho adequately appreciate the value
of the If tory achieved. ThUdeterinlnatioii pro
ceed from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any
part of the people of our country, or to ny of
their interest. The inviolability oi the amend
ments re-t.s upon the fundamental principle of
our Government. They are the solemn expres
sion of the will of the people of the United
htte.
The hentltnent that the Constitutional riphis of
all our citizen must be maintained, does not
prow weaker. It will continue to control the
Government of the country. Happily, the history
of the late election show s that in many parts of
the country where opsisitiou to the Fifteenth
Amendment has heretofore prevailed, it is dimin
Lshiui;. and is likely to cease altogether, if linn
and well-considered "action is taken bv Conpress.
I trust the House of Kepresentalivcs rtnd the Sen
ate, which have therizht to jud,'e of the elections,
ret'irni and qualifications of their own members,
will see to it that every ease of violation of the
letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment is
thoroughly investigated, aul that no benefit from
such violation shall accrue to any person or party.
It will be the duty of the Kxeeutive. with suth-i-ient
appropriations for the purjaise, to prtisecnte
unspaniily all who have been cnp.tred in depriv
ing titiens of the righu guaranteed to them by
the Constitution.
It is not. however, to be forgotten that the best
and surest guarantee ot the primary rights of
citizenship is to las found in that capacity for
M'lf-protect inn which can belons: only to a people
whose rieht to unviersal auirrajje is supported by
universal education. The means at the command
of the iocal and sitate authorities are. in many
cases, wholly inadequate to furnish free instruc
tion to all who need it. This is especially true
wher, before emancipation, the education of the
people was neglected or prevented in the interest
of slavery. Firmly convinced that the subject of
opular education deserves the earnewt attention
of the people of the whole country, with a view to
wi.-e and comprehensive action by the Govern
ment of the United s. Utes, I respectfully recom
mend that CoiTTess. by suitable legislation and
w ith proiMT safeguards, "supplement the local edu
cational funds in the several states where the
grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship
have beeil devolved 011 uneducated people, by de
voting to the purpose grants of the public lands,
and, if necessary, by approoriations from the
treasury of the United Sutes." Whatever f Jovem
ment can fairly do to promote free, ixtpnlar elu
cation ii;lit to be done. Wherever general em
cation is found. cace. virtue and social order
prevail, and civil and reluious liberty are secure.
In my former annual messages, 1 have asked
the attention of Congress to the urgent neei-ssity
f a reformation of the civil service system of the
Government. My views com eniing the dangers of
patronage, or appointments for personal or parti
san considerations, have heen strensnhencd by
mv olwe nations and cxjrieuce in the Executive
oriiee. and I ta-lieve these daubers threaten the
stabiliiv of the Government. Abuses so serious
in their nature can not be permanently tolerated.
They tend to become more alarming with the en
largement 01 a iminisinuive service, as tue grow in
of the country in population increases the num
ber of officer and placemen employed.
The reasons are imperative for the adoption of
fixed rules for the regulation of appointments,
promotions, and removals, establishing a uniform
metrud. having exclusively in view, in every in
stance, the attainment of" the best qualifications
for the position in question. Such a method
alone is consistent with the equal rights of all
itizens. and the mot economical aud etticieut
administration of the public business.
Competitive examinations, in aid of impartial
appointment aud promotions, have been "on
ducled for some years past in several of the Exec
utive lepartmetits, and by my direction this sys
tem ha-s been adopted in the Custom Houses and
postoRices of the larsrer cities of tho country. In
the city of Sew York over iOOD positions in the
civil service have been subject, in their appolnt-
mnt and tenure of place, to the operation of
jHiblished rule for thla puroone, during the
Iast two years. The results of these practical
trials have been very satisfactory, nd have con
finned my opinion in favor of thia system of se
lection. AllaresubjecrM to the same tests, and
the reault U free from prejudi by iersonal favor
or parti.-au Influence. It aecures for the positiou
applied for the best qualitications attainable
among the - con deling applicants. It is an effect
ual (arotectioa irora the pressure of, importunity
whi'Ji, uuder any other coutse'punaed. lantely
' exacta the time and attention of appointing
fficerMo their great detriment In the discharge of
other official duties, preventing the abuse of the
service ior tie mere furtherance of private or
party pnrposes, and leaving the employe of the
Govern mentlreed from the obligations imposed by
tataiaize. to depend aoleiy ntxai merit for reten
tion and advancement and with thin constant
- liven tire to exertion and improvement.
Thea invaluable reaulu have been attained In
a high degree in the office where the rolea for
. appointment by competitive examination have
been applied.
A method which has , so approved Itself bj-ex
peri mental tests at iints where such texts may
lie ialrlv considered conclusive, should be extend
ed to ail subordinate positions under the Gov
ernment. I U-lU've that a strong and growing
Jmblic sentiment demands immediate measures
or securing and enforcing tlie highest )Kible
! efficiency in the civil service, and its protection
from recognlcd abuses, and that Ihe experience
referred to- has demonstrated the feasibility of
such measures.
The examinations in the Custom Houses and
Postotrlcea have been held nndcr many cmlar-
rassments and without provision for componsa
tion for the extra labor performed by the officers
who have conducted them, and w hose commenda
ble interest in the improvement f the public
service has induced this devotion of time and
labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance
of thee labors gratuitously ought Hot to lex
pected. and without an appropriation by Con
gress lor conicnsation. it is not practicable to ex
tend the system of examinations generally
throughout theeivil service. It is also highly ilil-
Mriant that all such examinations should be con-
' ducted noon a iniform svtein ant under jceneral
authorizes the President to irewri! the reRula-
tioiis for adniiv-ion to the civil service of the
United States, and for this purpose to employ
suitable H-rsons to conduct the requisite inquir
ies with reference to "the fitness of each candi
date, in rer.ecl to aire, health, character, knowl
edge. Hint Mbillty. for the tiranch of service into
which he aceks to enter;" but the law is practi
cally inojierative for want of the requisite appro
priation. 1 therefore recommend an appropriation of
&i".0nu jKr annum to meet the expenses of a Com
mission, to be appointed by the president In ac
cordance with the terms of this section, whose
duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and etlir
cient system of competitive examinations, and to
supervise the application of the same throughout
the entire civil service of the Government. 1 am
persuaded that the facilities w hich such a Com
mission w ill afl'ord for testing the fitness of those
w ho apply for office will not only be as welcome
a relief to uiemlKTs of Congress as it w ill le to
the President and heads of lH-partnienU, but that
it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of
embarrassment which now inevitably and con
stantly attend the conflicting claims of patronage
between ths Legislative and Executive leart
ments. The most effectual check uhii the per
nicious competition of intlueiice and oilicial
favoritism, in the Ustowal of ollice, will be the
substitution of an open competition of merit be
tween the applicant-. In w hich every one can
make his own record w ith the assurance that his
siicct-ss will depend upon this alone.
I also recommend such legislation a, while
leaving every ott'eer n free as any other citizen to
express his political opinions awl to use his means
for their advancement, shall also enable him to
feel as safe a any private citizen In refusing all
demands upon his salary for political purposes.
A law which should thus Kuurantce true liberty
and justice to all who are engaged in the public
serv ice, aud likewise contain stringent provisions
against the use of ottid.il authority to coerce the
jMilitical aciimi of private citizens or of oilicial
subordinates, is greatly to be desired.
The most senous bstade. nowever. to an im
provement of the civil service, and csecially to a
reform in the method of appointment and re
moval, has been found to le the practice, under
what is known a the spoils system, by which the
appointing power has la-en so largely encroached
Uxn by members of Congress. The first step in
the reform of civil service must be a complete di
vorce between Congress und the Kxeeutive in the
matter of appointments. Thecorruptitig doctrine
that "to the victors Ix-Iotitf thespoii.s." i insepa
rable from Congressional iwitroiuige as the estab
lished rule and pralice of parties in iwcr. It
comes to le undeistood by applicants loroiliee,
and o the people generally, that KeprescnUtives
and Senators are entitled to li.sbiiie the wtnin
ageof their re-iective I u-tricts and States. It is
t;ot necessary to recite at length the evils result
inu from this invasion of the Kxeeutive functions.
The true prim-iph-s of pivernraeiit on 1 tie subject
of appointments to ottice. as stated in the Na
tional Conventions of the leading parties of the
country, have again und again been itj-
iroved by the Ainerieuu people, niul have not
n'cu call-l in question in any quarter. , These au
thentic expressions of public opinion upon thi
all imiiortant subject, are the statement of princi
ple that ladom; to the constitutional structure of
the Govcriunent.
"Under the Constitution, the President and
heads of Iti partmeuU are to make nominations'
fir ofli--. The Senate is to advise, and consent to
apHintiiients, aud the Hou- of Kepreaciitati v-s
is tORiruse aud prosecute faithless olticers. The
best iuterestsof the public service 1 mauds that
thte distinctions la resp-etel ; that Senators and
Kt'pTvu-ntii ti es, who may la; Jnlk;es mid ac;ns-rs.
should not diewte appointments to otltce." To
this end the co-oi.ratin of the legislative de
partment of the Government is required, alike by
the neccsMtcs of the ease and by public opinion.
Members, of Cougrt ss will not 'be relieved from
the dera.inds made upon them with reference to
appointments to office until, by lecislative enact
ment, the pernicious practice is coudeuined aud
iorilddcn.
It is tlierefore reeoiiinicnded tliat an act be
passed defining the ndaiions of mi-niltcrs of t.'on
Kress w ith rescct to apixiintment to otlice by tlie
President, and I a!o recommend that the provi
sious tif section 1,707, and of the sections follow
ing, of the Keviscd Statutes, comt rldug the
tetiure-of-ottice act. of March '2, ls;7, be retiealeO;.
Believing that to reform the system ana met h
ois of the civil service in our country is one of the
highest and most imjicrative duties of statesman
ship, und that it can le iK'rmaueully done ouly
by the ctMiK-ratioii .f the la-gi.-lative and F.xevti
tive Iepartments of the Government. I again
commtiid the whole subject to your considerate
attention.
It is the recounized duty and purpose of the
people of the I nited Statas to suppress polygamy
where it now exists in onr Territories, and to pre
vent it extension. Faithful and zealous cllorU
have been made by the United SUtes authotiiies
in Uuh to enforce the laws against it. Kxjerience
has shown that the legislation upon this subject,
to be euective. requires extensive mo iticatiou
and amendment. The longer action is delayed,
the more dittieult it w ill la to accomplish what is
desired. 1'rompt and decided measures are neces
sary. The Mormon sectarian organization which
upholds polygamy has the whole jsjwer of mak
ing and executing the local legislation of the Ter
ritory. By its control of the grand and petit
juries, it possesses larue influence over the ad
ministration of justice. Exercising as the heads of
this sect do, the 1kI political power of the Ierrl
tory, they are able to make ettect
ive then hostility to the law of
Congress on the subject of polygamy, and,
in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy
will not be abolished if the enforcement ot the
law dejiends on those who practice and uphold
tne crime. It can only be suppressed by Uking
away the jsililical power of the sect which en
courages and sustains it. The power of Congress
lo enact suitable laws t.i protect the Terr tone is
ample. It is not a case for half-way measures.
The politi"al power ot the Mormon sect is wicreas
ing; it controls now one of our wealthiest and
most populous Territories. It is extending
steadily iiito other Territories. Wherever it goes
it esUblishesiM)lyvamy and and sectarian l-olili-cnl
power. The km 11 tit y of inarria'-r and the
family relation ore the corner-stone of our Ameri
can society and civilazatlon. Keligious liberty and
the .eparatioti of Church and State are among the
elemeuury ideas of free institutions. To re
establish the interests and principles which
pol gamy ami Mormonisin have imperiled, and
to fully nstiien to intelligent and virtuous immi
grants of all creeds that part of our domain w hich
haa been, in a great degree, closed to general im
migration by intolerant ami immoral institutions,
it is recommended that the Government of the
Territory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for the gov
ernment of Utah by a Governor and Judges, or
Commissioners, appointed by the President and
confirmed by the Semite a government analo
gous to the provisional government established
for the territory northwest of the Ohio, by the
ordinance of l"sf. If, however, it is deemed best
to continue the existing form of local govern
ment. I recommend that tlie riaht to vote, hold
otlice, and sit 011 Juries in the Territory of Utah
te confined to those w ho neither practice nor up
hold polvgamv. If thorough measures are
adopted. It is believed that within a few years
the evils w hich now afflict Utah will be eradi
cated, and that this Territory will in good time
become one of the moat prosperous and attractive
of the new States of the Union.
Our relations w ith all foreign countries have been
those of undisturbed peace, and have presented
no occasion for concern as to their continued
maintenance.
My anticiDation of an early reply from the
British. Government to the demand of indemnity
to our fishtrnien for the injuries suOercd by that
Industry at Fortune Ilay. in January. ls7.s, which
I exprewed In my last annual message, was dis
appointed. This answer was received 00 y in the
latter part ol April in the present year, and,
when received, exhibited a failure of accord be
tween the two Governments, as to the measure of
in the shore-fishing privilege secured to our
fishennen by the Treaty of Washington, of
ho serious a character that 1 made it the
subject of a communication to Congress, in
which I recommended the vloptlon of the meas
ures which seemed to me proper to betaken by
this Government in maintenance of the rights ac
corded to our fishermen uuder the treat)-, and
toward ecuring an indemnity for the injury
these interests had suffered. A bill to carry out
theae recommendations was under consideration
bv the House of RenreaenUuves at the time of
the adiournmeut of Coiiirress in June last.
Withiu a few weeks 1 have received a commu
nication from Her Malestv'a Government, renew
In th consideration of ll.e aublect. both of the
indemnity for the Injuries at Fortune Uy, and
of the interpretation of the treaty in which the
previous correspondence had shown the two Gov
ernments m te at variance. Upon both these
topics the disposition toward a friendly agree
ment is manifested by a recognition of our right
to an indemnity for the transactional r'ortnoe
Bay. leaving tlie measure of such indemnity to
furtner eoii fercnev, and by an assent to the view
of this Government, presented in the previous
correspondence, that the regulation of coutllcting
interests of the shore fishery of the Provincial wa-
coats. and the vessel 11-heryof our fishermen .
should be made the subject of coiifercni-e and
concurrent arrangement between the two Gov
ernments. 1 iucerely hope ihat the laistsTuay la? found for
a speedy adjustment of the very i-eriotis diverjrence
of views in the the interpretation of the fishery
clauses of the treaty of ashlngtHi, w hich, as the
correspondence relwecti tlie two Governments
stood at the close of the last session of Congress,
seemed to be irreconcilable.
In the important exhibition of arN and Industrie-,
w hich was held last year at Sydney, New
SMtuth Wales, as well as that now in progress at
Melbourne, the United State have !eeu efficient
ly and honorably represented. The exhibiter
from this rountry at the former place received a
large number yf awards in Mime of the most con
siderable departments, and the participation of
the United States was recognized' by a special
mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Mel
bourne the share taken by our country is no less
nouble. and an equal degree of success is confi
dently expected.
The" sute of peace and tranquility now enjoyed
by all the nations 01' the continent of Knroa has
its favorable inlluetiee upon our diplomatic and
commercial relations with them. We have con
cluded and ratiaed a Convention w Ith the French
Republic for the settlement of claims of the citi
zens of either country against the other. Under
this Convention a Commission, presided over by a
distinguished publicist. apiointed. in pur
suance of the request of both Na
tions, by His Majesty the Einjieror
of Brazil. ha liecn organized and has la-gun its
sessions in this city. A Congress to consider
means for the protection of industrial proiicrty
lias recently la-en in s-ssioti iu Paris, to w hich 1
have apiintcd the Ministers of the United states
i'.i France and in Belgium as delegales. The In
ternational Commission itan Weights and Meas
ures also continues its work in Paris. I invite
your attention to the necessity oLan appropria
tion to be made in time to enable this Govern
ment to comply with its obligations uuder the
Metrical Convention.
Our friendly relations with the German Empire
continue without interruption. At the recent In
ternational Exhibition of Fish and Fisheries at
Berlin, the participation of the United sut-s. not
w ithstauding the lia-'e w ith w liieh the Commis
sion was forced to make its preparations, was ex
trem ly successful and meritorious, winning for
private" exbibiters numerous awards of a high
class, and for the country nt large the principal
Prize of honor ofl'ered by ifis Majesty the Emtcror.
The results of ibis great "success can'not but ad
van tagcous to this important and grow Ingiiidustry.
I here have la-eu some questions raiMsl lietwecn
the two Governments as to the proper effect and
interpretation of our treaties 01 naturalization,
but recent dispatches from our Minister at Berlin
show that favorable progress i making toward an
understanding, in accordaniv w iih the views of
this Government, which makes and admits no
distinction v hatevcr 1st ween the rights of a na
tive and a naturalized citizen of the United State.
In practice, the complaints of iuolctation suriV red
by naturalized citizens abroad have never becu
fewer than at present.
There is nothing of Importance to note in our
unbroken friendlv relations with the Govern
ments of Austria-Hungary, Russia. Portusral. Swe
den and Norway, Switzerland. Turkey and Greece.
1 Hi ring the la-t summer several vessels la-long-ing
to the merchant marine of this country. Mail
ing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were
tired at. hoarded and searched by unarmed cruiser
of th" Spanish Government. The circumstances,
as reported, involve not only a private injury' to
the Ja-rsoiis i-omt-nicd. but also seemed too little
observant of the friendly relations existing for a
century between this country and stuiin. The
wrong w as brought to the attention of the Spanish
Government in a serious protest niul remon
strance, and the matter is undergoing investiga
tion by the royal authorities, with a view to such
explanation or relatratioii as may be called for by
the fucts.
The Commission sitting in this city for the ad
judication of claims of our citbeiix against the
Government of spuin is, I hoa, iipproaeh.1 tig the
termination of its lalor.
The claims against the United States under the
Florida treaty with Spain were submitted to Con
gress for its action at the late session, and I again
invite your attention to thix loim-staildilii; otleu
tioii, w ilh a view to a tinal (IL-pocitioii of Hie mat
ter. At the invitation of the S'panlsn Govern
ment, a Conference has recently been
held at the city of Madrid to consider
the nibject of protection, by foreign
Powersof native Moors in the Empire of Morocco.
The Minister ot the United States, in Spain, was
directed to take part in the deliberations of this
Conference, the result of which is a Convention
signed on lajhalf of all the Powers represented.
The instrument w ill U laid before the Senate for
its consideration. Tlie Government of tlie United
States h:is also lost no opportunity to urge upon
Unat of the Emperor of Morocco the necessity, in
ao-ordance with the humane and enlightened
spirit of the age. of putting an and to the persecu
tions, which have been so prevalent in that coun
try, of iersons of a faith other than the Moslem,
and especially of the Hebrew- residents of Mo
rocco. The consular treaty conelnded w ith Belgium
has not yet been officially promulgated, owing to
the alteration of a word in the text by the Senate
of tue United States, which occasioned a delay,
during which the time allowed for ratification ex
pired. The Senate w ill be asked to extend the
jieriod for ratification.
The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradition
with Denmark failed 011 account of the objection
of the Iian'sh Government to the usual clause
providing that each Nation should pay the ex-h-iisc
of the arrest of the jersons whose extradi
tion it asks.
The provision made by Congress, nt Its last ses
sion, for the expense of the Commission which
had been appointed to enter upon negotiations
with the Imperial Government of China, on sub
jects of great interest to the relations of toe two
countries, enabled the Commissioners to proceed
at once upon their mission. The Imierial Gov
ernment was prepared to give prompt and re
spectful attention to the matters brought under
negotiation, and the conferences pria-veded with
such rapidity und success that, on the 17th of No-vemta-r
last, two treaties were signed at Pekin,
one relating to the introduction of Chinese into
this country and one relating to commerce. Mr.
Trescot, one of the Commissioners, is now on his
way home bringing the treaties, and it is e.M!Cted
that they will be received in season lo be laid be
fore the Senate early in January.
Our Minister in .'apun has negotiated a Con
vention for the reciprocal relief of shipw recked
seamen. I Uke ticcasion to nrge once more upon
Congress the propriety of making provision for
the erection 01 suiUble fire-proof buildings at th
Japanese Capital for the use of the American Le
gation, and the 'nrt House and jail connected
vvilh it. The Jaiainese Government, with (Treat
generosity and courtesy, has ottered ior this pur
pose an eligible piece of laud.
In my last annual message I Invited the atten
tion of Congress to the subject of the indemnity
funds receive I some years ago from China and
Japan. I renew the recommendation then made.
that whatever portions of these funds arc due to
American citizens should be promptly jmid. and
the residue returned to the Nations, respectively,
to which they justly and equitably belong.
The extradition treaty with the Kingdom of
the Netherlands, which has been for some time
in course of negotiation, has, during the past
year, been concluded and yuiy ratlhed.
Relations of friendship and amity have been
esublished between tne Government of the
United suites and that of Roumauia. We have
sent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest, and
have received at the this Capital the Special En
voy, who has ticeil charged by nts Koyat High
ness. Ptince Charles, to anuounee the independ
ent sovereignty of Coumania. We hope for a
speedy tevelopment ot commercial relations be
tween the two countries.
In my last annual message I expressed the hope
that the prevalence of quiet 011 the border be
tween this country and Mexico would soon
become tu 1 assured as to justify the modification
of the orders, then in force, to our military com
manders, iu regard to crossing the frontier, with
out encouraging such disturbances as w ould en
dancer the ja-ace of the two countries. Events
moved in accordance with these expectations,
and the orders were accordingly withdrawn, to
the entire satisfaction of our own citizens mid the
Mexican Government, subsequently the peace of
the border was again disturbed by a savage foray,
under the command of the Chief Vlelorio, but,
by the combined and harmonious action of the
miliury forces of both countries, bis band has
been broken up aud substantially destroyed.
There is reason to believe that the obstacles
which have so long prevented rapid and conven

The war between the Republic-of chili on the
one hand and the allied KeriublVs. of I'eru and
Bolivia on the other still continues. This Gov

contest that is w ithin the belligerent rights ot the
parties as independent state?;. We Nave, however,
always held ourselves in readiness to aid in ic
coininoduting their difference, and hve at differ

our good offices in this direction were recently
accepted by all the lelligeretits. and it was hoped
they would prove enicaeioun: but 1 retrret to an-noun-e
that the measures, which the Ministers id
the United States at Santiago and Lima were au
thorized to take, w ith a view to bring, alxnit a
peace, were not successful. In the cotu-se of the
war some questions have arisen alfectinz neutral

are witnessed by1 the general demand for them fy
all classes of merchants and putn u fact urcrs en
gaged in our foreign trade. It L believed that the
system of such ptibiicationa is . deserving of the
approval of Congress, and thai the ueccssary ap
propriations for its continuance and enlargement
w ill commend itseif to your consideration.
The prosperous energies of our domestic indus
tries, and their immense productions of the sub
jects of foreign commen-et invite, aud even re
quire, an active development d" the wishes and
interest of our jieople in that direction. Espec
ially imiKirtant is it that our commercial rela
tions with the Atlantic aud l'acitic (Umsts of
South America, w ith the West Indies and theGalf
of Mexico should be direct, and not through the
circuit of European systems, and should be tar
ried on iu our own lad torn. The full apprecia
tion of the opportunities which our front on the
Pacific Cavau gives to commerce with Japan.
China and the East Indies, with Australia and
the Island groups which lie along these route of
navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appro
priate to our own shipping, and to administer by
onr own capiul. a due pn4oxtion of .this trade
Whatever uioditieatoiis of our regulations of trade
and navagatlon may la? necessary or useful to
meet and direct th-se impulses to the enlarge
ment of our exchanges aud of our carrying trade,
I am sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to
supply. One luitial measure, however, seems to
me so clearly useful and etlicicnt. that I venture
to press it uon youf earnest attention. It seems
tobe very evident that the provision ot regular
stearn-posul communication, by aid from Gov
ernment, has been the forerunner of the commer
cial predominance of Great Britain on all these
costs and sea, a greater share in w hose trade is
now the desire and the iutent of ourtwople. It
is also niHuifest that the efforts of other rjiropean
nations to contend with Great Britain tor a share
of this commerce have been 6uccc√ºsinl iu pro
portion wltn their adoption of regular steam-postal
communication with the markets whose trade
they sought. Mexico and the SUtes c? South
America are anxious to receive such postal com
munications' w ith this country, aud to aid in
their development. Similar co-opperation may
be looked for, in due time, from the Eastern na
tions nnd from Australia. It is dittieult tos?e
how the lead in thin movement can be expected
from private interests. Iu reseH of foreign
commerce, quite as much, a In in
ternal trade, postal communication seem neces
sarily a mutter of common and puliic administra
tion, und thus pertaining to Government. 1 re
spectfully recommend to your prompt attention
such just an cthcteut measure a may conduce to.
the development of our foreign commercial ex
changes and the building up. of our carrying.
ira le.
in this connection. I 1 erf re nlso to suggest Ute
very great scrvi't which might ta expected ! en
larging and facilitating our commerce on this pu
ciiic (.lectin, were a transmarine cable laid trvan
San raiicisco to the Sandwich Islands, nd Uurtiee
to Japan at the North and Australia at tho Nulla.
The great influence of such Menus of commaaica-
tiou on these routes of liavtiuioii. in dcvclning
and securing ih due share ut our 1'acitic (aM in
the commerce of the world, needs no illustration
or enforcement. It may that such an enter
prise, useful and in the end profitable as it would
prove to private lnvestinoni. mav need tone accel
erated by prudent legislation by CoiigrcKs in its
aid, and I submit the matter to your careiul con
sideration. Au anditional, and not unimportant, although
secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging the
Navy may be found iu the unquestionable service
to the expansion of onr commerce, which would
be rendered by the frequent circulation of naval
ship in the sea and poruof all quarter of the
globe. Ship of the proper construction and
equipment, lo be of the greatest efficiency
in case of maritime .war, might be made
constant and active agents in time of peace in the
advancement and protection of our foreign trade,
aud in the nurture and discipline of young
seamen, who would, naturally, iu some numbers,
mix with and improve the crew of our merchant
ships. Our mercnanu at home and abroad recog
nize the value to foreign commerce of an active
movement of our naval Teasels, and the intelli
gence aud patriotic zeal of our naval officer in
promoting every interest of their countrymen, is a
just subject ot national pride. -

It is fortunnt. that this large surr Ins revenue

itresents a very f -ivorable opportunity not only to
fiirtlier reluce th principal of the debt, but also
to reduce the rci of interest on that which will
remain unpaid. I call. the attention of CongTess
to the views expressed on this subject by the Sec
retary of the Treasury in hla annual report, and
recommend pn nipt legislation lo enable the
Treasury IVpartaient to romplete the refunding
of the debt Iii h is about to mature.
The continuance of specie payment has not
leen interruistU or endangered siuisa the dale of
restimptioa. It has contributed greatly to the re
vival of busine- and to our remarkable prosperi
ty. The fears that preceded nnd accompanied
resumption have pntved groundles. No consid
erable amount of United .States notes have been
presented for redemption, while very large sums
of gold bullions, both domestic nnd imported, are
taken to tlu- mints and exchanged for coin or
uotes. The increase of coin and bullion iu the
United States stuec January 1, is?!, is estimated
at -.,7,:i,.i,J.4s.
There are stul In existence, uncanceled. RJI6.-
tisi.016 of Unit's! SUtes legal-tender notes. These
notes were authorized ns a war measure, made
necessarry by the exigencies of. the conllict in
wlilcJi the 1 uited sute waa then engagel. The
preservation of the Natiou's existence requirel,
iu the judgment of Congress, an issue of legal
tender paper money. That it served wen the
purpose ftr which it was created is not ques
tioneJ. buttihe employmeut of Uie notes aa paper
mouey Indt nitely, after the nccomplishnuint of
the object tor which they were provided, was not
contempllUed by the framtrs of iht- law
under wjiicd they were issued These
note lone since became like anv
other pecusiiary obligation ot the Government a
debt tola; paid, and, when pmid, to be wmceled
as mere evidence 01 an indebtedness no longer ex
isting. T therefore repeat what was said in the
animal Bwsage of last year, that the mirement
from citmilatioii of United State notes, w fth the
capacity of legal tender in. private contracts, is a
step to te taken in our progress lowurdasafe and
stable currency, which should be accepted as the
policy ana amy 01 tne ioveriimeiit and the in
terest md security of tho people.
Aitbeiime of the parage of the act now tn
force, requl ring the coinage of silver dollars, fix
ing thefr value and giving them legal tender
charaLcr. it was believed by many ot ihe support
ers of the measure that the silver dollar, which it
authorized, would speedily Im-cosjc. under the
opetutiousof the law, a J equivalent value to the
gold V. liar. There w.wre other an porters of the
bill, who, while they " mined astcrhe probabilitv
of llis result, ncverthnt-less were villlng to, give
tho-proptiwcd experUaent a fair trial, w ith a view
to slop the coinage, if ex perienee should prove
thjU the silver dolhux authorized by tlie I ill con
tinued to tie of las commercial value itaui the
Siwidard gold dol'it?.

effort has be.st made to ksep this currency in ir
culation. n ctitisidenilw- expeuse has been
necessarily iuviured for tUw purK, but Us re
turn to the Treasury is prompt and sure. Con
trary to the confident anticipation of the friends
of the measujeat the time of its adoption, the
value of √úm? silver dollar, eon tain ing 4 1-J v.; grains
of silver, has not iucreased. - iHinng l√ºe year
prior to tha passage of tlie bill au'horixing its
coinage, the market value of the silver which it
contained was' from ninety to ninetv-two cents,
as computed with the standanl gold dollar. Dur
ing the liua year the average market value of the
silver dollar ha beeu eighty-eight and a half
cents.
It is obvious that the legislation of the last Con
gress iu regard to silver, so iar as it was based on
an aulk-ipaied rise in the value of silver as a re
sult oi that legislation, ha failed to Produce the
effect then predicted. The longer the law remain
iu force, requiriug as it d-s the coinage of a
nominal dollar, which, in reality, is not a dollar,
the greater becomes the danger thai this country
w ill be forced to accept a single metal as the sole
legal standard of value, in eiiculatlcn, aud this a
standard of less value than it purport to be
worth in the recognized money of the world.
The Constitution of the United States, sound
financial principles, and our best interest, all re
quire that the country should have a it legal
tender money, both gold and Kilver coin, of an in
triiuvio value, aa bullion, equivalent to that which,
upon it face, it purport to posses. The Constitu
tion, in express terms, recoguize both gold and
silver a the only true legal tender money. To
banish either of these metals from our currency
is lo narrow and limit the circulating medium of
exchange to th disparagement of iaapnuant in
terest. The United Slate produce mors silver
than any other tynntry, and is directly interested
in maintaining it aa one of the two precious
metal which furnish the coinage , of the world.
It will, tn my judgment, contribute to this result

With respect to the ermy. the Secretary invites
attention to the fact that its strength is limited by
suiute (section 1,115. Revised statutes) to not
more than .OWeulistod men. but that provisos
conta iied in appropriation bills have limited
exiK?nditiircs to the enlistment of hut JS.iw. it
is Ik.-'s veil the full legal strength is the least pos
sible foroo at which the vresent organiatiMi can
be maintained, having in- view efficiency, disci r

ion-e wonia add somewnatto the
a more substantial character than those hereto

ing laws, permanent buildings can not Ik? erected
without the uirviou of Congrvs. and when sales
of military s;te and bull lings have boon au

to the Treasury, and could only become abailablc
through a rew appropriation. It is recommended
that provision .t made, by a genera! statute, for
the alc of su h alsindoned military posts and
buildings as are found to be unnecessary, nnd for
the application ol the proceed lo the construc

A comprehensive Improvement of the Missis

prise a system of Inland transportation spread
iike net-w'ork over a large portion of the United
States, and navigable to the extent of many thou
sands of miles. Producer and consuraers alike
have a common interest in such uneqnaled facili
ties for cheap transportation. GeHrraplucJly,
coinmorcially and politically they are the strong

try. These channel of commnnication and in
terchange, are ihe property of the Nation, its

The chaiiuetof the Columbia River, for a dis

serious delays in navvution aud heavy expense

twenty feet at low tide should be secured and

Fron Columbia River to San -Francisco, a dis
tance of over WW miles, ' there is no harbor on
our Pacific Coast which can be ap
pnwuhed during stonnv weather. An appropria
tion of 1√ñ0.U0O was ma'de by the Forty-fifth Cwn
gresa for the eommeucement of a break-water
and harbor of refuge, to be located at some point
between the Straits of Fuca and San Francisco, at
which the necessities! of commerce, local aud
general, will be best accommodated. The amount
appropriated is thought to be quite inadequate
f√ºr the purpose intended , The cost of the work
when finished will be very great, owing t the
want of natural advantage for a site at any point
on the coast belveeti the designated liniiu, aud
it has not been thought to be advisable to under
take the work w ithout a larger appropriation. I
commend the mailer to the attention oi Con
gress. The completion of the new building for the
War Department is urgently reeded, and the esti
mates for continuing it construction are espe

two thousand - (√ÑI.OO√º) specimens, and are
unique in the comidetenes with which both

lospiul record, together with a great quantity of
papers, embracing the origluaT records of the
hospitals of onr armies during the civil war.
Aside from their historical value, these records
are daily searched for evidence needed in the set

The rport of Uie Postmaster General exhibits

proved a constant stimulus to improvement.
During tlx iast year there was an increase of 2,134

To enable the United states to do iu full sham of
this great w ork, additional legislation is asked by
the Postroasier General, lo w hose recommenda

The suggestion of the Postmaster General, that
it would be wise to eueourae, by appropriate
legislation, the establishment of American line
of steamer by our own citizens, to carry the
mails between our own poruand tho of Mexico,
Uentral Ameri-ai, South, America, and of trans
Paciric countries, is commended to the serioua
consideration of CoiiRresa.
The alien lion of Congress is also Lnvi'ed to th
suggestions of the Postmaster General in regard,

The nuesiry for additional provision, to aid in
the transaction of the business of the Federal
Court, ta-come each year more apparent. The
dockets of the Supreme Court, and of the Circuit
Courts, iu the greater number oi the circuits, are
iiicuialered with the constant accession of case.
In the former Court, atid in many Instance in tho
Circuit Courts years intervene before it is practic
able to bring cases to hearing.
Tlie Attorney General recommends the estab
lishuieur of an Intermediate Court of Krror and
Appeals. It is recommended that the number of
Judges of the Circuit Court in each circuit, with
the exception of the second circuit, should
lie increased by the addition of another
Judge; in the second circuit, that two
should be added ; and that an Intermediate Ap
pellate Court should be formed in each circuit, to
consist, of the Circuit Judge and Circuit Justice,
and that In the event oft he absence of either of
these Judges the placeof the absent Judge should
Ve supplied by the Judge of one of the District
Courts tu the circuit. Such au Appellate Court
could be safely invented with large jurisdiction,
and its decisions would satisfy suitors in many
case where uppeels would still be allowed to the
Supreme Court. Thi expense incurred for Uiia
Intermediate Conrt, will require a very moderate
increase of the appropriation for the expetiaee of
the I e part men I of Justice. This recommenda
tion is commended to the careful consideration of
Congress.
It is evident that a delay of justice, in many in
stancc oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now
ueeearrly occur in tne F'ederal Court, which
w ill in this way be remedied.
The report of the secretary of the Interior pre
sents an elaborate account of the Operation of
that Department during the past year. It rives
me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs
apiiear to be in a more hopeful condition now
than ever before. The Indians have made grati
fying progress in agriculture, herding, and me
chanical pursuits. Many who were a few yean
ago in hostile conflict with the Government are
quietly settling down on farms where they bona
to make their permanent homes, building house
and engaging iu the occupations of civilized life.
The introduction of the freighting business among
them ha been remarkably fruitful of good re
ulta, in giving mauy of ihem congenial aud re
munerative employment, and in stimulating
their ambition to earn their own opport. Their
honesty, fidelity, and efficiency as carriers are
highly praiaed. The organization of a police force
of Indians has bcYn equally successful in main
taining law and order upon the Reservations, and
iu exercising a wholesome moral influence among
the Indians themselves. 1 concur with the Sec
retary of the Interior in ;he recommendation
that the pay of this force be increased, as an in
ducement to the best class of young meu to
enter it.
Much care and attention ha been devoted to
the enlargement of educational fact Miles for the
Indians. The means available for this important
object have been very inadequate. A few ad
ditional boarding-schools at Indian Agencies have
been established, and the erection of buildings
ha been begun lor several more, but an
increase of the appropriations for thi
interesting undertaking i greatly needed
to accommodate the large number of
Indian children of school age. The num
ber offered by their parents from all parts of the
country for education in the Government Schools
ls much larger than can be accommodated with
the means at present available for that purpose.
The number of Indian pupils at the Normal
school at Hampton. Ya., uuder the direction ot
General Armstrong, ha been considerably in
creased, and their progress is highly enrouraging
The Indian School established by the Interior
Department in 179, at (Carlisle, Pa., under ta
direction of Captjun Pratt, ha been equally e
cessful. It has now nearly 300 pupil of both,
sexes, representing s great variety ol the Tnoea
