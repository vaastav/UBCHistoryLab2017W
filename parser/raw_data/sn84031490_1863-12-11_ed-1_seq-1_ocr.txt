SHE NEWS.
Without any detail being given, the dis
patches say that Jeff Davis Issued a lugu
brious message to his fellow conspirators
on Monday, not calculated to raise the
spirits of that lean and hungry crowd.
There is only one feature wherein the tale
looks doubtihl, and that is, that it is the fact
that the Confederates are in doleful dump,
&nd Jeff docs not ordinary put facta into
his messages.
It seems at last certain that John Mor
gan did not go to Toronto, but “on the
contrary <julte the reverse” set his face to
wards Dixie, where ere this he is safe
among his friends, ready for .fresh mis
chief! , He will take good care however,
that this propensity docs not again take
him north of the Ohio River. He will
abandon his Buckeye friends to the Lin
coln despotism, and steal homes and hurry
farmers in Kentucky.
The movement for the repeal of the S3OO
commutation clause in the Conscription
net is already, working, and the prospect
that it will be so amended, has cost & chill
upon copperheads, to whom the contem
plation of chances to cany a nlnskct for
the Union is not a pleasant one. To this
may bo attributed the action of the Com
mon Council last night, in the unanimous,
vote to give a bounty of $75, out of the
city Treasury, to each volunteer. . Think
of that, and this from men who, & month
ago would have traitorously hooted
the idea of aiding to fill op Lincoln's
armies. But they ace the prospect that
lightcxcmptionsare all post, that the coun
try needs men and has called, for men, and
will gather them in.. The lists of the Pro
vest Marshal are thus already reaching
those upon whom patriotic calls have been
mode in vain, and it is safe to say that per
sonal terror has so thoroughly blanched
cut of these men their prejudices that not
one objection will be made to colored men
coming up to take this bounty. Thus as
the war rolls on, self interest reaches those
principle failed to affect, and the bitterest
rebel sympathizers in the Common Coun
cil arc yying with each other to hold out
inducements to volunteers to save (them
selves from) the draft
A. MEAN THICK AND MOW DE-
FEITED.
Our readers are already informed that
the small specimens of humanity that nm
the Journal in the absence of Mr. "Wilson,
sold out the President’s Message to the so
ceah organ, and they—a “noble pair of
brothers” secretly—attempted to deprive
the other morning dailies of it By an ar
rangement on Wednesday morning among
the papers, the Journal was to have' the
copy and publish Has promised in their
evening edition. When they failed to pub
lish it, their property in it ceased by cveiy
rule of right, and we believe ©flaw.
Telegraph companies have been decided
in law as common carriers, and have no
right to refuse the transmission of matin
duly offered them for that purpose. Set
ting aside the question of proprietary right
in the cqpyof the Message that had already
been a matter of sale in this city, the Mes
sage existed elsewhere, was already in press
at numerous points west of the lakes where
an enterprising evening press exists. To
these copies at a distance we were resolved
to have recourse by tdegraph.
Knowing our rights, and being deter
mined to maintain them, we made a legal
tender to E. D. L. Sweet, Esq., the mana
ger of the Illinois and Mississippi Tdegraph
Company, and demanded that the
Message be sent to ns if offered
by our friends at Dubuque, or
Springfield. The message camp as of
right it should, for had not the company re
ceived it and sent it, we should have at
once prosecuted them for summary dam
ages. In all this Mr. Swcctacted with per
fect fairness and impartiality, and with a
proper regard to the interests of his Com
pany.
And yet with characteristic mal
ignant mendacity the sccesh con
cern ' abuses Mr. Sweet for do
ing precisely what the Tdegraph
Company are legally required to do for the
entire business public. But all sensible
men hare long since ceased to expect either
truth or {decency from that sheet Mr.
Sweet will outlive its malice, and the pub
lic will be reassured that when there is
news abroad they willfind it in the columns
of UicTbibuke.
RECONSTRUCTION.
•The country has been waiting with great
inter eat for the President’s opinions on the
important subject of reconstruction. Since
the declaration by Sumner, Chase, and
Blair of their views, illustrated and enfor
ced as they were, by all the talent and
bearing of their distinguished advocates*
the people have been still more anxlons to
know how fiir these men reflected the
opinions of the President, and who would
prove to have most of tlie confidence, or
coincide most nearly with the judgment
and -counsels of the Chief Magistrate. • But
as might have been expected from the
previous history of Mr. Lincoln’s dealing
with important public questions, we And
from the Message, that neither one of these
prominent men has stated the opinions of
the President, os to the mode In which the
Union is to be reconstructed; but that the
plan brought forward by the President
differs in many important respoota from
theirs, and will be received by the country
as strictly his own, stamped with the same
features of large common sense, and ster
ling love of country and of freedom, that so
distinguish all the proposed measures of
the President.
Without regardingatthis time any of Hie
many debatable questions of State rights,
and constitutional authority, which arc
soon to be raised by different politicians
and parties in the country, we wish to ex
press our great gratification that all the
President professes concerning this impor
tant subject, is so entirely controlled and
moulded, by those two great ideas, so pre
cious to any free and loyal heart, the pre
servation of the Union, and the destruction
of Slavery. In what Mr. Lincoln proposes
for the future, is in all hehas done in the
past; he seems animated by hut
one feeling and purpose, to save
.the dountry and make it free.
So paramount are these two great
so superior to all temporary means or pri
vate interest; so much in the estimation of
the President do they outweigh all indi
vidual ambition, or party pride, that while
he submits to Congress his own impres
sions of the best measures by which these
great ends can he attained, he would wil
lingly abandon las own matured projects,
i? ready to listen to any suggestions from
any side, and would only he 100 glad to
join with any man in any effort, so only it
may accomplish the great cud of saving the
Union, and redeeming the land from the
curse of slavery
In the noble manner in which Mr. Lin
coln subordinates his own peculiar plans
cud wishes to those of others, and appeals
to the country in the highest terms of mag
nimiuious and devoted patriotic foelling,to
cast aside all personal prepossessions or.cr
pcctations,ull party ambitions and schemes,
and unite ina noble and earnest effort to save
UieUnionbnd thccountry,wefindtheßurest

tejest and fierceness of passion may thwart
or hinder the efforts and counsel 1 * of the
wise and good; they will struggle in rain
against the united efforts of the great loyal
masses of the country, under the guidance
of a leader so strong and good, to redeem
the land from the curse and shame of hu
man bondage, and make that Union, by
which alone its gloiy is sure and perpetual.
While inspired by the noble words and
deeds of the President we seek like him to
sink aQ individual preferences, and bring
all personal hopes and interests, beneath
this profound love of country; let us also
IHcp him under all trials, and »TPld all
doubts, place first and foremost Liberty and
Union, to be fought for always and every

story now is that they will reach millions of
dollars. Measures are being taken for fur

that yet caught is that to be winged.,
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Speculations as to the effect of the Presi
dent’s Proclamation abound. Some Border
State men incline to the belief that it will
have a material effect in hastening peace.
Its suggestion is attributed in some quarters
to Secretary Chase.
The President’s careful 'silence on the
Mexican question is the topic of comment in
diplomatic circles. The Mexican delegation
regard it as an intimation that he had nothing
pleasant to say, and therefore in the present
juncture of affairs at home, thought best to
say nothing at all.
THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.
Rumors of a change in the command of the
Army of the Potomac are again current
They probably bare this foundation: It is
knows that grave - dissatisfaction exists
among the authorities at Meade’s late cam
paign, also that the Secretary of War has not
been disposed to regard him with much favor
ever since he let Lee cross the Potomac after
the battle of Gettysburg. It Is known algo
that authorities have been considering whose
appointment to the command of that army
would give the greatest promise of seeming
earnest co-operation and activity, and that
various names have been suggested and dis
cussed. • Beyond this it is not probable that
anything Is yet a certainty.
When Horace Greeley was here, he'urged
Thomas as the popular man, and his name
receives favorable mention from many quar
ters. • ,
The organization of the army throughout
is considered certain. It is come to be con
sidered on past experience, that thorough
reform in the Army of the Potomac means,
as it needs must, something more than a
change In the chief command. The displace
ment of certain corps commanders of cop
perhead proclivities and sit-still preferences
is certain to come. Without this no leader
can bring victory to 'our arms in Virginia.
What with the know-nothingsby endowment
and tbe do-nothings from choice, the list of
corps commanders under Meade, needs thor
ough purging, and mnts have it, before that
army sees Richmond.

Meade, it is believed, "will soon be relieved

President and Mr. Chase favor the restoration
of Hooker, while the Secretary of War hesi

of Thomas taking command, the general im

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY
OF THE TREASURY.
Washington, Dec. 10.—The following Is a
synopsis of the Secretary of the Treasury’s
Report:
In submitting to the consideration of Con
gress the report of the state of the finances,
the Secretary of the Treasury has much sat
isfaction In being able to say that the opera
tions of the Department entrusted to his
charge have been attended during the last
fiscal year, by a greater measure of success
than he ventured to anticipate at its begin
ning. Notwithstanding the aid offered by
the additional Issue of united States notes,
nnder the joint resolution of January,. the
Secretary hod found it impossible .to present
the gradual increase, daring the session of
Congress infthcamoant of unpaid acquisitions.
Those which were unsatisfied at the begin
ning of the session, were indeed discharged,
and large sums were applied to new demands
for current disbursements, bjit the aggregate
of disbursements remaining necessarily un
paid Increased steadily, notwithstanding all
efforts to prevent, until it reached, at the
close of the session, the sum of $73,171,169.
The Loon act and the National Banking act
were followed by an immediate revival of
public credit Success quite beyond antici
pation crowned the efforts of the Secretary to
distribute the 5-20 loan in all points of the
country, as well as every other measure
adopted by him for replenishing the Treasu
ry.
The result was that within' two months
.after the adjournment of Congress the whole
mass of suspended requisitions had been sat
isfied, all current demands promptly met,
and foil provision made for the payment of
the Army and Navy daring the remainder of
the fiscal year. No embarrassments attended
the administration of the finances except
those which are inseparable from vast expen
ditures. Notwithstanding these expendi
tures it Is gratifying to be able to state that
during the last year the total disbursements
did not greatly exceed, while the increase of
thepubllc debt did not equal estimates ad
mitted to Congress by the Secretory at tho
lost session.
Thus while it was then estimated that the
public debt on June SOth, 1863, would reach
the sum of $1,122,297,403, its actual amount
on that day was $1,098,793,181, and while the
disbursements for tbc year were estimated at.
$693,346,321. the real total was $714,709,995,
while the receipts from other ordinary
sources of revenue thus closely correspond
with the estimates or largely exceed them.
Tbc receipts from the Internal Revenue
have alone disappointed expectation, and ex
perience has demonstrated its error.
The estimate was $85,456,303, while the
actual receipts were $37,640,787. A part of
(be deficiency may be attributed to tbc im
perfect execution of the law, and a part to
the changes made in It by Congress alter the
estimate was made; but it is not probable
had neither eanse operated to reduce the re
ceipts that the revenue from this source
would have exceeded half the estimated
amount.
It Is clear that tbe law, unless materially
amended, will not produce the revenue ex
pected from it. .
In a former report the Sccretaryplaced the.
limit to which loan in the form of certificates
of indebtedness could be carried at $100,000,-
000, experience has shown it can be carried to.
$150,000,000, and. that its natural limit la
about that sum.
On the Ist of December the amount of
these certificates was $145,720,000. It would
be unsafe, therefore, to rely on any substan
tial Increase of loan in that form.
The limit prescribed by law to the issue of
U. S. notes has been reached, and the Secre
tary thinks it clearly inexpedient to increase
the amount, sufficient circulation having been
already provided. The Government most
now borrow like any other employer of cap
ital temporarily requiring more than his in
come will supply, and rely for tbe credit
which will secure advantageous loans upon
good faith. Industrial activity accumulated,
though not immediately, available capital,
and satisfactory provision for punctual pay
ment of accruing interests and ultimate re
imbursement of the principal. >
To subscriptions for the remaining 5-20’s
and deposits for temporary loans, therefore,
must be directed all reasonable expectation
of means for tbe service of the current year,
except from negotiations under the act or
the last session. The sums to be looked for
from these two sources have already been
statecd, and the amount to $126,059,000.
If this aggregate be deducted from the
amount io be provided by loans for the lost
seven months of the current year, already
shown to be $352,220,539, there will remain
the stun of $226,166,999 to be provided by
negotiations nndcr the act of last session,
and under some like act must be'proriedcd
in like mannee. If tbb continuance of the war
shall make it necessary, the snm of $544,978,-
cstimated'aa being likely to be required from
loans for tbe fiscal year 0f1865.
Tbe following is the Secretary’s estimate
of receipts and expenditures for tbe next
year:
Estimated balance Jane 1, IBM $5,836,539
From Ccstoms 70,000,099
From Internal Eevennc 125,000,000
From Lands 100,000
From Miscellaneous Sources 5.000,009
Estimated aggregate receipts.
He estimates the real expenditures for tho
year at *731,815,038. from which deduct the
estimated receipts from ordinary sources, as
before stated, $206,830,539, leaving to he pro
vided hy loan $544,978,548.
The sum to he provided represents the
increase of debt during the year. Assuming,
therefore, the correctness of the estimate
which puts the debt of July Ist, 1864, at
$L65G,900,C41, it will result from these
estimates that the whole debt will have
reached on the SOth of June, 1805, the sum of
$2,251,1585,190.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue'
recommends an increase of the tax on bank
note circulation to 3 3-5 per cent, an increase
on distilled spirits to GO cents per gallon, on
tobacco to 2(T cents per pound on leaf, and
from 5 to 12 cents, according to quality, on
manufactured, 10c per gallon on etude pc
trolinm, 2c per pound ou cotton.
The repeal of ths tobacco and petroleum
drawbacks, and various other changes of the
internal revenue laws, to .augment the. re
. ceipts. "
The enactment of such laws will secure an
'increase of the internal revenue to thoamount
originally estimated, of $150,000,000 a year,
required by the strongest considerations of
public policy. :
Hitherto the expenses of the war have been
defrayed by loans to an extent which noth
ing but the expectation of its speedy
termination could folly warrant It wlu
not escape observation.
That the average rate of interest is now in
creasing, and it is obvious that it must con-
thine to increase frith the increase of the
proportion of the now interest bearing debt,
and as the amount of the latter, consisting
of H. 8. notes and fractional currency, it can
not be materially augmented without evil
consequences of the most actions character.
The rate of Interest must Increase with the
debt, and approach continually the highest
average, that must he greater or less in pro
portion totho duration and cost of the war.
Second —The repeal of the existing limita
tion of deposit and loon to $100,000,000, and
the substitution of & provision for a reserve
equal In amount to half the deposit.
tided— Permission for the negotiation of
loans redeemable absolutely at; pleasure, or
at pleasure aftera time fixed notmore remote
than forty.ycars, and further the omission,
pcrhapSpOf the clause taxing circulation and
deposits, as being more appropriate to an In
ternal revenue buL
It is hoped that the: other powers of the
law may J>e retained in the newloan
act.
Under such legislation the Secretary enter
tains little doubt of being able to obtain
whatever ftmd will be needed through loans
at reasonable rotes of interest for bonds or
Trcasnaiyjiotcs, and for warrants. For this
confidence however, on successes
of national banks.
The act Of lost session authorized the loans
supposed to he required for the fiscal years
1803 and and of the amount required
for the service of those two years to Decem
ber now current, $150,000,000 in United States
notes,'unci $60,000,000 oy a loanfor two years.
Five per cent Treasury Notes have already
been provided under that legislation. The
act is so well conceived and expressed, that
lit-le other legislation for the loans of 1801
1865 will be required thdh the application to
those years of its leading provisions. .
It will, doubtless, be thought expedient,
this session, to authorize the borrowing in
some form of $800,000,000 for the current,
and $000,000,000 for the next fiscal year.
In the creation of a debt by the negotiation
of loans, or otherwise, the Secretary lias kept
four objects steadily in view:
FinsT,—Moderate interest
Second.—General dislribullon.
Thikd.—Future convcrtabilltyJ
Foubtil—lncidental utility.-
How he has attempted to . attain each of
these are fully explained. An incident of
good; he says, growing from the bitter root
of debt has been fnlly explained on observa
tions heretofore "submitted on the national
banking system.
Except through such a system no sure way
s seen to the-complete and permanent estab
lishment of anniform cnrrency,anda system
of national hanking fair to all, and secure for
all. It can only be safely and fimly estab
lished •by making .use of a portion. of the
national currency. Meantime additional
loans are required, and several modes arc
open; one by removing the restriction on
the temporary loan to One hundred millions;
another.by the sale ofs-20’s; another from
certificates of indebtedness, and another
from U. S. notes, the number of which Uo
thinks it clearly inexpedient and unwise to
increase.
He proposes no change in the Congression
al limitation of Treasury Notes to (our hun
dred millions, thinking wo now hayc suffi
cient for circulation.
The only modifications of the act of last
session necessary to adapt it to the require
ments of the current and coming year seems
lobe the Omission of all reference to United
States notes beyond giving simple authority
to the Secretary to ascertain Irom time to
lime the amounts destroyed or lost, and to
replace them by new issues.

[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.]
CctczKKATr, Dec. 10,15C3.
The President’s Message has been read with
general approval by all classes here. The
plain honest way in which it is written has
gained the respect of even the enemies of the
Administration.
The election of a Senator from-By., which
takes place on Tuesday next. Is creating con
siderable excitement both in Kentucky and
here. The nomination of Rev. Robert J.
BrcckcnrJdge is strongly advocated. He has
token such a bold stand for thp Union, that
his election will be greeted with joy by all
truly loyal people, not only in Kentucky,but
all through the North.
RecrulUnggocsonTety slowly here now,
and the principal part of Ohio’s quota will
have to be filled by the draft.*
Active preparations arc being made by the
Provost Marshals to gO on with the draft on
the sth of January. A proposition will be
made to the City Council to-morrow to allow
the Miami & Indianapolis & Cincinnati Rail
roads to make & connection in this city by
running their cars through the streets from
one depot to the other. Should permission
be granted It will raise quite a competition
between the above roads and the brood gaage
road, which will be finished In a few months.
General Cor did not leave for Knoxville
yesterday, but will leave to-night.
The rumors afloat os to the whereabouts of
Morgan are all ■without foundation. It is
known that be passed through this city one
week ago to-day, and crossed into Kentucky'
by the Fifth street ferry. He then dined at
the residence of a noted rebel in Covington,
and left with a horse and buggy for Florence,
on the Lexington pike.
He changed horses at Florence and left -for
the Interior of the State. Probably ere this
he is within the rebel lines. *
The notorious guerilla and horse thief Dan
Cook, who lately escaped from the custody
of Provost Marshal Cony, at fronton, has
been re-arrested at Cracker’s Creek, In Mor
gan county, Kentucky. He Is the same per
son who lately robbed the Ashland Dank.
Preparations for the great 'Western Sanita
ry Fair ore being made at a rapid rate. It is
believed that a quarter of a million dollars
will be raised.

seizure was paid through to New York.
They were promised SSOO each on the

N. O.
It was also arranged that at a- store in N.
Y., each of theparty was to call at different
times for a parcel containing revolvers, am
munition, and a pair of hand-cuffs.
It is believed a cargo was shipped by Con.
federate agents—was valuable fo the Sontb,
and that it was arranged she should be seized
on this particular trip. .
The Chcasapcake did not coal here, she
coaled off the harbor, and took on board
Captain Parker, formerly of the privateer
Retribution, who took command.-
Latest.— The Cheaspeake is reported to be
near Cape Sable.
New York, Dec. 10. —The identity of the
pirates who captured the steamer Chesa

believed that some of them have come from
Canada to Portland, and there embarked on
board for this port They know all the facta
and were therefore able to direct the opera
tions of persons who joined them.
The steamer Potomac, belonging to H. B,
Cromwell &Go., owners of the Chesapeake,
will start to-day in pursuit The Government
has commissioned the Potomac, and she will
be armed and furnished with a fighting crew
at the navy yard.

rpHE TRIBUNE FOR 1864.
PROSPECTUS.
THE NEW YOBS TRIBUNE, first Honed April W,
XS4I, has to-day a larger aggregate circulation than
any other newspaper published In America, or (we
bellevt) In the world. Compelled a year since to In
crease tbo price of its several Issues, or submit to the
pecuniary ruin of Its proprietors from the very mag
nitude of Its circulation, It has probably since parted
with some patrons to wbozn its remarkable cheapness
was a controlling recommendation; but others hare
taken their places, and It has now more tbanTwo
Hundred Thousand subscribers and regular pur*
chaeers—an excess of at least Fifty Thousand over
* those of any rival. And this unprecedented currency
It has achieved by very liberal expenditures in pro
curing early and authentic Intelligence, by the fear*
less expression of . convictions, by the free employ,
ment of ability and Industry wherever It might con*
tribute to excellence In any department of our enter*
prise, and by unshrinking fidelity to the dictates of
Justice, Humanity, and Freedom.
By very large outlays for early and authentic ad
vices by telegraph and otherwise from Its own cor*
respondents with the various armies of the Union,
and by special efforts to furnish such Information re
specting Markets, Crops, new discoveries or Improve*
ments in Agriculture, Ac., as must specially Interest ;
farmers, wc have assiduously labored to make a jour*
nal calculated to meet the wants and subserve the .
interests of the Producing Classes. That end we have
at least measurably attained; for no other newspaper
exists in America or Europe which is habitually read
by nearly so many farmers and their families as Is
Toe Thibtox to-day. We shall labor to Increase
both the number and the satisfaction of this by far
the most numerous class of Its patrons.
imrlng the existence of the whig party, this paper
supported that party, though always sympathizing
with the more liberal, progressive, Antl-3lavery
“wing” thereof. Whonnewlssocs dissolved or trans
formed old organizations , through the spontaneous
uprising of the people of the Free States against the
repudiation of theMlssourl Restriction, Tux Thibet*
heartily participated in that movement, and was
known as Republican. When the long smouldering
conspiracy to divide and destroy our country or re
duce it entire to complete abasement to the Slave
Power culminated in overt treason and rebellion, it
naturally, necessarily regarded resistance to this con
spiracy as paramount to all other considerations, and -
devoted all Its energies and efforts to the malntcn*
tcnance of our Union. In every great controversy
which has divided oweounUy.U has been found on
that side which naturally commands the sympathy
and support of the large majority of school houses
and the decided minority of grog-shops, and go doubt
less will be to the last. • . ' •
- Ardently desiring'and striving for the early and en.
during adjustment of our National dUtrnctions, Taw
Tbietcs leaves the time, the nature and the cohdl*
tioosof that odjnatment implicitly to
Ih authority, fidnndlug In their wisdom and patriot
lim, anxious to aid them to the utmost In their ardu--
ons responsibilities, and not to embarrass them even
by possibility. Firmly believing In the Apostolic
rnle—“ First pore, Tznar peaceable”—holding that
the final extirpation of Slavery Is *hc true and only
absolntecnrc for onr National anyexpe
dlent that stops short of this can hare bat a transient
and Illusory success—'wc yet propound no theory ol
* reconstruction” and indorse none that baa been pro
pounded by another—neither Samner’snor Whiting's,
norsay of the various Copperhead derlccslbr achiev
ing “Peace” by Barrendering the Republic into the
power of Its traitorous foes-bnt, exhorting the Amer
ican people to have faith In their Government, to re
Inforce their armies, and replenish their treasury, we
believe that, U they but do their duty, a benign Provi
dence will la doe time bring this fearful struggle to
such a close as will best subserve the true greatness
of our country and the permanent wen being of
klnd. •
The present session of Congress win be an exceed
ingly Interesting one, and we have made ample ar
rangements to lay before onr readers what Js going
on in Washington,both In Congress and In thePe
partmenls.
TTe n spectfttlly solicit the subscriptions and active
exertions of our friends, and of all whoso views and
convictions accord substantially .with ours.

Dr. James Is recommended by the press generally of

The following are the testimonials of some of the
many well known and eminent Doctors of the United
Stat%sofwblch Dr. James la the recipient ot, The
letter below produced la firom Dr. Jordan of Cincin

Here is the letter referred to;
“CISCISSaTZ, July 5,1363.
“Da.Wirsow—Dcasflir: Inanswertoyourznqni
“ rlw, I would lay that I have known Pr. James, fbr
“mirly of James’ Hospital, Hew Orleans, ana now of
“Chicago, 111., off and 00, for the last.twelve jean,
“ and I think I may safely say that. In bla line ofprac
“ dee, I do not know his superior if his equal. I knew
“him two yean in How Orleans, and three summers
“Inthlsolty,aadlnbothplaces I had occasion fre.
“qucntly to recommend parties wanting treatment
“In that line, to him. and Hi every case, soar as I
“conld learn, be was successful, and gave the most
“ parlcct satisfaction. Be has from the start made tho
“ Study tfwbatare called special diseases a speciality,

“ I know of so 000 to Whom I .would sooner recom
“mend a patient or a Mend needing treatmentof that
“kind, or lor any of the kindred complaints or chro

“J. XL JORDAN, If. D.”
Also Pr. Wm. Leonard, formerly Professor of Anat
omy In the Washington University, of Baltimore, and
previously Professor of Obstetrics and of
women and children, and mote recently editor of tho
Hew Orleans Southern Messenger, (a medical Jour
nal,} says of Pr. James:
“Pu. Jaxxs humanity continues to ho la
“flrm and man la prone -to err, the consequences of
“Imprudence or crime are when these
“consequences are visited upon the unbsppy wrong
“doer, be most seek relief from the misery thus eo
“tailed. AndtheTman who devotes his life and lal
“enta to the relief of this species of hhman suffering
“IsnotlcsssphltanihropisC than he who seeks to re
“lleve any other affliction to which man is subject, for
“truephtlanthropby looks not to what caused the
“trouble, but what will relievo It. To this class be
“longs Dr. James who has denoted alarge portion of
“his life to the relief of this clou of diseases ennme
“rated In bis advertisement in another column. He
“has, at great expense, supplied himself with all tho
“material knowledge required for the purpose. Be
“baabeen located In onrmldst far a number of years,
‘“and the testimonials of the press, which has been
“quoted In bis card speaks volumes of praise In Ua
“behalf aa a wise, discreet, and observant praett
“tloaer.”
And also this, from the eminent and venerable Pr.
P. Richardson, an old practitioner of Texas, and
now editor and proprietor of the Galveston News,
Texas:
“We have known Pr. James, of Customhouse
“street New Orleans, personally, for a number of
“years, and daring that time have been made ac
quainted with a number of persons who were
“afflictedwith chronic diseases, which bad baffled
“thesrill of some of oar most scientific phystria**
“hut through the tkfliful treatment of Dr. James,
“readily yielded, and were permanently ami per
‘ fbctly cored. We know Dr. Jamis to be asclentlfla
“physician, and an honorable man, and t erefare
“recommend those requiring his aid to apply to bint
“ immediately .through letter or pemonaTyJor rebeC*

Hi* fbllowlug. from the Indianapolis (Indiana)
Gezette r of Ap> n Ith, 1363, the editor cf which paper
has known the Doctor for many icara, and therefor*
, wbaMie says nay he relied or. Here it Is;
“‘Db.- JAaraa—rVa. call attention to the medtaj
advertisement of Dr* D, B. James, which wll Le
found In another part of oar paper to-day; and we
do so the morareaoily because we know Dr.
and bare known blm more or lew for the last twenty
years. Ills rather a dell.-ala subject—this matter of
■ special cbeases-to write about, or apeak ofe'ilo
i tally. In a dally paper; aad-jet we tnowot no reason
why It should be more so than about any other dleea'tt
to which the toman tamlly are subject—lf properly
considered. ■ •
“Woundthat oar most successful physicians ara
(hose who devote themselves to some one disease or
class of diseases ;aa, for Instance, to tho treatment
of consumption and affections of the- throat and
longs; to diseases of the icctam. sa piles and fistula .
o cancers and carcenomatona affections; to entane?
ons diseases and affections of the sUn; to diseases of
the cyo and ear—as well as. tho dentist to diseases of
the teeth; and, dually, to what are called Secret Die.
eases, or diseases of the'genital or sextual organa. All
this is very proper. No one man not In allfe time can
become a thorough and successful physician In tha
treatment of all diseases; and we would always re
commend a friend who was afflicted with any serious
complaint, to a special practice ptyal clan, who coir,
fined himself wholly or mainly to tho treatment of
snch diseases—lnst sa we would. for Instance, and &a
we have often done—recommend a person suffering
from any of the secret diseases to Dr.. James. Wo
should think him more likely to understand anlbe
able to treat successfully than a physician who at
tended to general practice and all Wnd« nr rt;,in-m»a.
And this is but reasonable and natural. '
“But as to Dr. James, wo can apeak positively. Wo *
bavo known blm, as we have said, for manyyesrs;
and. being a physician ourself, would naturally in
quire Into, and know something about, fals manner of
treatment and his success. We believe he may be re
garded cs standing among the foremost; if not at tha
bead ol those devoted to tbo curs of this class of dls
eases, as to speedy and successful core of the same
We knew him two years In' New Orleans, when he
was so regarded there, and, indeed, all through the
Southern country. Bis Hospital, in Custom Bouse sfc*
for tbe treatment of spscian nrsnaaas, was about a*
well known as Dr. Stone’s hospital for that of general
diseases—and ho seemed to bo quite a* popular, and
to give universal satisfaction. We have also known
him in Cincinnati, (where he sometimes spent ths
summer J and we have always understood him to ho
mostsuccessful. and to give complete satisfaction.
We regard him. In addition to an this, to he a man of i
unblemished character .and sound moral Integrity.
He bad to leave New Orleans, we believe, on account
of bis Unionism and loyalty to the General Govern
ment, which Is certainly one think In big favor.
“To persons, therefore, whohave bees so unfbrla
uateaato contractony of these diseases,or have had
such disease or disability enulled'npon them, we say
and wo cao say It with confidence, go to Dr. James,
it is some distance; his otllce Is in Chicago: bat it is
better, perhaps, to go all that distance and be treated
skillfully, ana be cared In a abort time, and with rem
edies that will leave no evil effects behind, than to
trust your case to unskillful bands, and suffer, per
haps a lifetime.”
Also, the following from the Mobile (Ala.) Adver
tiser of Slay 2d, 1S61:
“Ds. Joints.—We learn from the New Orleans Cres
cent that Dr. James (not the Cannabis Indlca man,
whose ’sands of life* have recently xnn out, hot a veri
table and skillful practitioner,) who has been con
ducting one of the largest hospitals In the United
States since IS9O, at si Custom House street. New
Orleans, La., leaves during the present month for the
North; What be la leaving for we cannot say—only
conjecture—probably on account of our present trou
bles with tbe North. Bo that as u may, wo can say.
and with confidence, that be has the greatest reputa
tion la tbls country. In a speciality, of any ohyuciia
:hat ever practiced In it. furthermore, wefiavehul
occasion to know tbat Dr. James Is an honoruUo
man, and he will inform those requiring his aid wheth
er or no be ccn give them a care. The &ct, also, that
Dr. James* residence baa been a permanent one, is
good evidence that be la capable of accomplishing
what be promises in the treatment of tbe specialty In
disease to wblch be confines his practice.' 1
Tbe following is tbe nnuonac ement In tho New Or
leans Crescent to which we have referred:

Dr. James, wlthlnjthe last fifteen yean, baa treated
more diseases, and of o worse character, (ofn pri
vate natnre), than any other physician In the United
States.
Dr. James has testimonials from some of theblg'iMt
medical authority In the United States—profeaso.M of
medical colleges and hospitals—and from the aluoat
entire press of the South. Many of these teathn-'a; tls
have from time to time appeared In this paper, ‘'r.
James has been practicing In this speciality in lew
OrieccsCiteen years—thirteen years conductla - the
Ingest hospital In this country. There are numerous
Bersocs now residents of this city, formerly of Haw
cleans, who know that Dr. James had the most
extensive and successful practice la New Orleans*
the Sooth, or United States, and probably on both
continents. There is scarcely a person that resides*
or baa resided In New Orleans or the Southern States,
orevcrvialted New Orleans since 1850. that has not
heard of or seen Dr. James 4 Lock Hospital, on Cos* .
tem House street, where it was located for thirteen
lears. Therefore, with hts extensive practice and
ong array of testimonials from the medical faculty,
some ofthemost eminent doctors of the United States,
professors of medical collegcsand hospitals, speaklnz
orhlmlntbc highesttenneof prplte, should beaof-
Qclent evidence to gain thcconlldenee of those re
quiring such services as he renders.
■ It Is a conceded fact that diseases of the blood and
sklr, cbronlc diseases, and organic weakness Is mors
fircvulent and of a more severe and complicated typo
