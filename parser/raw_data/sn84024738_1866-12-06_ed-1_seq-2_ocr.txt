JRSDAY DECEMBER C, 1866.
I v Vhe Effect of the Message-What Con
gress will do.
One of the sensation correspondents of
w I ho Now York UwnUl states that thte mes
sage of the President as sent to Co"*?**
is very different from the one which he
originally prepared ; that he had intended
to propose a compromise with Congress
but, upon learning the teni|>er of the mem
bers determined to adhere to his original
position. How much truth there is in this
statement, we know not. It is, however,
we think, evident that in discussing the
restoration quest ion the Presiecnt was
* arcful to use no language which could
justly otlend his bitter enemies in the two
Houses. A special telegram in the Balti
more Sun says that 41 the even temi>er of
" the President's message is having an ex
44 eellcnt effect, not in behalf of concilia
41 tion, but in behalf of the dignity and
44 self-respect of the House as a legislative
44 body." And the debates in the Senate
upon several questions which have arisen
indicate that that body may perhaps be
expected to l?c less radical in its measures
than Stkyfxs's and Forney's threats have
led us to fear it would l>e. The
yatioiuil l{qvtl>Hcan declares that ac
cording to the official reports of the pro.
eccdings of the Senate and the
House on Monday, Sumner and Stkvkns
41 were discarded as leaders;" that "their
44 lead was squarely declined by a vote of
"both Houses? Simxkr on suffrage in the
44 District, and Stkvkns in his attempt to
"prevent the reading ofthe message." This
assumption, however, is hardly warranted
by the facts stated ; for both Stkvkns and
Si M\F.n were outvoted at the last session
ui>on several questions, yet the radicalism
of Congress was none The less manifest in
its measures. Stkvkns did not approve of
the constitutional amendment, although lie
introduced it and voted for it : and Si mner
was left in th? minority upon the question
i>l" the admission of Colorado into the Union.
The tone of the northern press indicates
that the message has had a mollifying ef
fect upon some at least of the Radical fac
tion. The Philadelphia lnquirtr (Radical)
says 44 that the President has written with
44 candor and dignity, and with the utmost
41 respect to Congress. It is to be hoped
44 that this judicious policy will have itsef
44 feet upon members of Congress, and that
44 whatever may be done contrary to the
44 views ofthe President will be transacted
44 with calmness, and without asperity or
14 passion." The Philadelphia Bulletin (Ra
dical) says it is "gratified with the mode*
4' ration, and w\'? ihe respectful tone which
44 he maintains towards the 4 coordinate
44 branches of the Government.' " The
New York Tintc, which is now Radical,
applauds the President's "good temper,"
but not his 44 good taste." The Tribune
counsels kindnes>, patience, and charity,
though it sees nothing in the message which
44 any loyal man can read with comfort or
hope." The National Inttlliymcer says :
44 We are under no apprehensions about
44 Congress territorializing the South."
Governor Pkirpoint assures us in his mes
sage that however it may be with the other
States, Virginia is iti no danger of being
bubjected to this har>h treatment. But the
resolution passed by Congress includes
Virginia in tlio of States for which it
is proposed to establish territorial govern
ments. It must be confessed that, to take
the most hopeful view of the situation, our
political condition is a deplorable one.
The Richmond Examiner. ? When, in a
playful, but respectful manner, we replied
to a general attack of the Richmond
amincr upon the other journals of this city ?
inferentially charging them with a want of
frankness or manliness for not following in
the Examiner's wake in protesting against
the Pollard .'prospectus,- we were alto
gether respectful to that paper. In the
Kcaminer's retort upon the lJiapatch for
this very fair hit at its egotism it essays to
disparage this paper and to attach to it a
reputation entirely undeserved. The sub
terfuge is contemptible.

The letter-press is iiul good, and ought

it should not be as faultless as that of the

message from the governor.
Colonel Lewis reported the following
communication from the Governor, which
was laid before the House :
Tut: Commonwealth ok Virginia, }
Executive Department, >
Rich mono, December f?, 1866. )
To the Senate and House oj Dtkjaie# of\
Virginia : .
Gentlemen, ? Last summer I received a
verbal communication from Kandoli
Rogers, Esq., the contractor for furnishing
statuary for the Washington monument.
A ft e i my annual message was placed m ho
hands of the printer, I received the lol
lowing letter :
Rome, November 10, 1F<?6.
To lilt Escellcncy F. 11- rierpoint, Go
vernor of the State of Virginia:
c:r Atlcr a lapse of more than five
years', I 'again take up my pen to write to
the Governor of Virginia on tho subject of
tho Washington monument, the comple
tion of which, after the death of Mi.
Crawford, was entrusted t-? me, and a eon
tract entered into between the ot'ite ot
Virginia and myself. I now write for the
purpose of stating the position ot the
case, and the condition ot the work. Ms
last letter to the commissioners | belore the
war was dated March ith, K Ol.
stated that I had just received a let er
from Miller, the bronze founder at M -
nicli, stating that the statue ot M^sha}
had been completed in bronze, and >\ould
be forwarded to Rotterdam without de a>,
and that the Nelson was M*r\y
and that the Lewis would be readj lor
shipping before the 1st of July; also, that
two of the allegorical statues, tutli mili
tary trophies, had been for several months
in the hands of bronze founders, and I l?e
lieved they were well advanced. 1 can
now sav that the statue ol Marshall was
forwarded to Rotterdam, as above stated
and upon which 1 have all this time been
pajing heavy storage and insurance.
At the time tho statue arrived in Rot
terdam the aspect of political maUers
looked so threatening that 1 was ads r>ul
not to send it forward, tor fear of sei/.mt
xnd confiscation. The statues of Nelson
md Lewis have been finished and packed,
ready tor .hipping, ever since the summer
of 1M?1. Tho balance due upon which,
ind one of the allegorical figures and tro
phies finished, and another advanced, I
rim expected to pay interest since that
UlMy contract witli two State of Virginia
is, in substance, as follows :

The above statement shows a balance in
my favor on the completion of the monu
ment of $o8, 100.05. Works completed,
shipped, and delivered, and works which
would have been delivered in Richmond
according to contract, had I not been pre
vented from so doing by commencement of
hostilities :

Cash received.. . 22,399 95
~~ "I"
On the 12th of September 1 was in Mil
ler's debt just about the above amount, in
cluding balance due on bronze casting,
storage, insurance, and interest on the
amount due him. I have since paid him
X'3li>, leaving a balance due him of about
8,000 gold dollars.
In payment of the Jt'319, Miller allowed
me to send lor.vard the statue of Marshall,
which has been so long lying at Hotter
dam, and would be willing to send for
ward the others, could I fix upon a certain
tiiue when he could receive the balance.
1 do uot ask the State of Virginia to pay
anything more until the works arc received
iu Richmond as per contract, but I must
know that the money will be forthcoming
when the works are delivered ; otherwise
I shall make a bad figure with my credi
tors. I shall be greatly obliged if your Ex
cellency will give a little attention to this
matter.
With great respect, I remain,
Your obedient servant,
Randolph Rogers.
The history of the whole matter is con
tained in the records of the Legislature of
the State. The justice of the claim is
fully presented in Mr. Rogers's letter. I
&in sure I have but to call your attention
to the subject to insure proper attention.
