Senate and House in Joint Ses
' ' sion Hear Address of
the President.
HE MAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS
Further Legislation for Settlement and
Regulation of Railway Labor Dis
putes Held Imperatively Neces
sary by the chief Magistrate.
Washington, Dec. 5. The senate
and house met In joint session today
und heard President Wilson's message,
which was as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution of com
municating to you from time to time
information of the state of the Union
and recommending to jour considera
tion such legislative measures as may
be judged necessary and expedient I
shall continue the practice, which I
hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine. myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which it seems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible; but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place, it seems to me im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of your last session in view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
and which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended:
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
-In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate ; in order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon it with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
its present constitution and means of
action, practically Impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
. actually engaged in the work of oper
ating -trains in interstate transporta
tion. Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president 'of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the in
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been off
, set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that. In case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
investigation of the merits of every
.such dispute shall be instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
.may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment in the
hands of the executive of the power,
in case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try as may 'be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
Renews His Recommendations.
The second and third of these rec
. ommendations the congress immediate
ly acted on; it established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages in train service and it au
thorized the appointment of u com
mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed ;
Unusual Experience. ,
"Man," remarked Sandy, "I did a
thing last nicht what I've no dune this
twenty year. I went to ma bed pairr
fectly sober, but Tm richt thankful to
sav I got up this mornin' none the

'Few Beggars in Panama.
Although the city of Panama is a
most cosmopolitan place, practically
every race being represented in its 60,
000 inhabitants, there are no beggars,
except a few blind men.
Somewhere. -
Your true lover is in the world or
yon wouldn't be here. .You must not
go to any other. That is the one dead
ly sin. He Is looking, too. As soon as
you both are ready, you will meet. In
her sleep that night she dreamed that
she saw the One who was to come, and
; there was a gold light about his head.
L. M. Steele in "Doctor Nick." , . ;
s: ; Its Limitations. .-"You-
can't make a bluff with : an.
'umbrella.". "Why not?" "Because you
musf either put up or: shut up." '
but It postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem it neces
sary to' renew. The power of the in
terstate commerce commission to grant
an increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to is indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw in question the scope of the com
mission's authority' or its inclination to
do justice when there is no reason to
doubt either.
fcThe other suggestions the Increase
in the interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and in its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, the
provision for full public investigation
and assessment of industriafdisputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary in time of war
or other like public necessity I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty cf scrying and safeguarding
them in such matters would find it
hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find it practically-
impossible, with its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but it is not unlikely that It
may presently be fgund advisable to
add to its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must first be
perfected as an administrative Instru
ment. The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are. needed.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it. With regard to one
of its items, the increase in the effi
ciency of the interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already acted ; its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
1 would, hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
make it, that any man in any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue in an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society in do
ing' so would be to adopt a new prin-.
ciple into our jurisprudence which I
take it for granted we are not prepared
to introduce. But the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until a public
Investigation shall have been instituted
which shall make the whole question
at issue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the nation is not to propose
any such principle. It is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the in
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint Itself with
the merits of the case as tiwesa em
ployee and employer, time to form its
opinion -upon an impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con-'
sider ail practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing in that proposition
but the justifiabie safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of
its very life. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the interests and liber
ties of all concerned as well as for the
permanent interests of society itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of "the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives: the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom,
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Rico ;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act.
i need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. -Their
urgency lies in the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but necessary-
Even delay would seriously
jeopard the Interests of the country
and of the government.

ulate the expenditure of money in elec
tions may seem to be less necessary
than the Immediate enactment .of the
other measurt3 to which I refer; be
cause at least two years will elapse
before another election in which fed
eral offices are to be filled ; but it would
greatly relieve the public mind if this
Important matter' were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied In
the light of present experience; and a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election was at hand
and some special object connected with
it might be thought to be ia the mind
of those who urged it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand in the
matter of combined and concerted effort-
to those who shall undertake- the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. . That enterprise . will
presently, will immediately assume,
has indeed already assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented In our experience.
We have not the necessary instrumen
talities for its prosecution; it Is
deemed to be doubtful whether they
could be created upon an adequate
scale under our present laws. We
should clear away all legal obstacles
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will give freedom without
permitting unregulated license. The
thing must be done now, because the
opportunity Is here and may escape us
if we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Rico is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
its people are not just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of the island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending.measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do in any essential particular. We
ought to do it at once. ,
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which it Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
and action taken, upon them.
Inasmuch as thrs is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, I
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you in
the many measures of constructive pol
icy with which you have enriched the
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege to labor In such
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion of
a record of rare serviceableness and
distinction.
Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite.
Instead of an ax and saw to remove
the tops of trees that are to be used
as masts in logging operations, dyna
mite is used to shoot off the tops.
After the branches have been removed,
a rigger climbs thetree, with a set of
Irons, to the point where it is neces
sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk
is usually about 12 inches in diame
ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna
mite cartridges, fastened end to end
like sausages, around the trunk at this
point, inserts a blasting cap with about
20 feet of fuse in one of these sticks,
lights the end of the fuse, and de
scends before the explosion takes
place. The tree top pumps into the
air with the explosion and the trunk
is left ready for attaching the rigging
for dragging in and loading the logs.

Mr. Pepperill had visited with Mr.
Brady earlier in the evening and was
called away for a conference. He had
returned to Mr. Brady's room to con

With his wife and son, Raymond, 10
years old, he lived at 651 Washington

Mr. Brady was one of the best
known Democrats of Kansas. Before
his appointment as assistant district
attorney in 1M.3 he was a member of
the stale board of control.
Last January Mr. Brady declined the
appointment of district attorney for
the Hawaiian Islands, stating that he
preferred to remain in Kansas City
as assistant to the district attorney
because of the superior advantages
and opportunities.
About two weeks ago, Mr. Brady
was injured in both legs in a railroad
wreck near Newman, and only re

BREWSTER'S REPORT FILED
State Attorney General Believes the
Kansas Natural Sale Will Greatly
Benefit the Public.
Topeka. In a summary of the gas
litigation now about ended, Attorney
General Brewster in his biennial re
port filed with the governor the other
day gave it as his judgment that the
sale of the Kansas Natural to the Do-
herty interests will terminate all liti
gation and result in the public receiv
ing better service.
"It is impossible," said the report,
"for a corporation to be managed as
a going concern by court receivers. If
the stock of the Kansas Natural, or
the property belonging to the Kansas
Natural purchased by the Doherty in
terests or. other interests, the receiver
now controlling such property should
be dischadged and the property re
turned to the stockholders. The phys
ical value of the property of the Kan
sas Natural far exceeds the indebt
edness of the company and there does
not seem to be any reason why such
a company should remain in the hands
of receivers, unless it be to keep such
company out from under the jurisdic
tion of the public utilities commission
of this state in the matter of fixing
rates." x
"There is no reason why a county
attorney should ' have the power to
investigate the violatious of an anti-

REfiO RANKS FIRST WITH 31
Superintendent Ross Well Pleased
With Operation of Plan After
But One Year's Trial.
As a result of the first year of the
operation of the plan for the standard
ization of Kansas rural schools, the
state now has 156 standard schools
distributed throughout forty-six coun
ties, according to material W. D. Ross,
state superintendent of public instruc
tion, has compiled. Counties having
five or more of these schools are:
Reno, 31; Douglas, 6; Jackson, 5;
Morris, 11; Finney, 6; Franklin, S;
Montgomery, 5; McPherson, 7; Brown,
6.
"This is a most satisfactory show
ing when it is considered that the
plan was inaugurated after the date
of the annual meetings last year," a
monthly report issued recently by
Mr. Ross says. "Consequently there
were in no case extra funds provided
to pay for the equipment and improve
ments that might be necessary to
meet the (Standard requirements.".
A decided improvement in the mat
ter of pictures, and in more harmoni
ous and artistic tinting of walls and
ceilings.
A decided impulse for better school
buildings.
Increased interest in school sanita
tion. Better equipment for our schools.
A movement toward better school
libraries, both as to number of vol
umes and as to character. This is es
pecially true concerning the books for
the lower grades.
An awakening of general community
interest in school matters.
A wholesome desire on the part of
teachers to meet fully the requirement
for a standard teacher.
An improvement in the condition of
toilets and other outbuildings that is
little short of marvelous.
A marked change in the care and at
tention given to school yards, fences,
walks, etc., to make them neat, clean
and well conditioned.
An improved light condition in
buildings having opposite side light
ing, due to better shades, the closing
of objectionable front windows, etc

EASY TO HAVE YOUR OWN ICE
An Available Water Supply and a
Little Ingenuity All the Require
ments Necessary.
" Put up your own ice. An easily
available water supply and a little in
genuity are the requirements for pro
ducing ice on Kansas farms at small
cost, according to Dr. J. D. Walters,
professor of architecture in the agri
cultural college.
"The ice making apparatus i3 simple
and may be procured for a small
sum," said Doctor Walters. "Tanks
for freezing ice are usually made of
galvanized iron, and should be large
enough to hold at least 12i cubic feet
of water.
"An ice cake weighing about 120
pounds measures approximately 10
by 18 by 20 inches. This is a well
proportioned cake, and one that is eas
ily handled and packed. .
"Two tanks are arranged, one In
side the other. In such a manner as
to leave a free space of about one
half inch between the two. Both
tanks should be slightly larger at the
top than at the bottom, so that in the
freezing of the water there will be
no danger of their bursting. In order
to make a division in the cakes, the
inner tank is divided into six com
partments by galvanized iron strips.
"This double tank is placed near
the well or spring, where the com
partments can be easily filled with
water. In cold weather the water
will freeze in a few hours, since the
tanks are exposed on all sides. The
ice should be dumped immediately af
ter it is frozen solid, to remove the
ice , cakes, scalding water is poured
into the narrow space between the
two tanks. Within a minute the sides
will be sufficiently loosened so that
upon the upsetting of the receptacle,
the cakes will slide out."

lege would cost the university ap
proximately $12G.G0 for the year. The

Cutting of operating expenses
usually causes jubilation in most In-
his report with a look of gloom and
the lines in Chancellor Strong's fore-'
head deepened as he read 1L
"Simply means we are crowding
more and more students into the
classes." said Dean Templin. "In
fact, we're having to crowd many
classes to such an extent it Is injur
ing the work. A teacher can teach
effectively only so many students.
Go beyond that point and you take on
evils of the lecture system with- a
teacher talking to a crowd without a
chance for personal supervision and
contact that is so necessary in
thorough educational work. But what
can you do about It? You have so
many students and so little money,
and the number of students growing
larger and larger year after year."
