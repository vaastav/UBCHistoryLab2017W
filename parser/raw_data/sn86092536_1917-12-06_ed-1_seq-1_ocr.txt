? WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.? Imme
? diate action to effect national uni.
fication of the railroads, either by
government operation or by sus
pension for the war of anti-trust
and anti-pooling laws, a federal
loan and regulation of security is
sues to permit more effective vol
untary co-operation, was recom
mended today by the Interstate
Commerce commission in a speci
fic report to congress.
Neither plan waj specifically en
dorsed. but an implication that the
majority believed the railroads
might successfully work out their
own unification, prompted Com
missioner McChord to submit a
separate report emphatically urg
ing government control and say
ing. "the strong arm of government
authority is essential if the trans
portation situation is to be radical
ly improved." Any voluntary
pooling plan would fail to meet
war exigencies, he declared, be
cause of the unavoidable influence
of selfishness among the roads. i
There was no disagreement as I
to the proposition that competl- j
tion among railroads must be di- i
. minished, if not altogether elimi. i
nated. to prevent a serious break- ]
down of transportation facilities, j
under the war's strain.
Rate Ircrease Inadequate.
The railroads' own proposed so
lution for the difficulties ? an in
crease ir rates in order to attract |
capital ? was characterized as |
entirely inadequate by the com
mission. Even with more funds, i
the report said, the shortage of j
equipment could not be remedied ]
materially because of the inability |
of industries to manufacture it.
Doubt also was expressed whether ^
sufficient capital would be attract- I
ed in view of the flotation of such I
enormous quantities of govern- i
ment war securities.

LONDON NEWS PRAISES WILSON MESSAGE
LONDON, Dec. 5. ? President |
J Wilson's message to congress has ,
the fullest possible prominence in
the morning newspapers but It
reached London too late for much
considered comment. The Dally
News receives warmly the presi
dent's declaration that peace
should be based on generosity and
justice to the exclusion of selfish
claims. It adds:
"It would be affectation to pre
tend that this language echoes j
the declarations of the European |
spokesmen of the alliance. It Is j
the voice of a statesman whose (
v'sion comprehends the world, t
while theirs comprehends only
half the world. ?
"If President Wilson could have i
said earlier what he said ye?ter- |
day, and if in Great Britain, ;
France and Italy the responsible j
leaders had made his language [
theirs, Russia might be today driv- '
Ing the enemies from her borders.
It may be too late to convince
Russia of the identity of the aim
of herself and the allied democ
racies, but It must not be too late
for those democracies to learn
from their greatest representa
tive how democracies should com
port themselves In war and how
they should attain peace.

son's speech a statement that will
mean the wiping off the slate of

is no kindshlp between tho spirit
of yesterday's speech and the spirit

warfare or afier-the-war boycotts."
