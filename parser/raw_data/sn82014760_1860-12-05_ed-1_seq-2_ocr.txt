't-', ,' THE MESSAGE.
The, President's 'annual message u real
in bold branches of" Congress yesterday. Ex
actly oQehalfof it relates to tho position of af
fair at the South, and, especially in South Car
olina, and It Is this part of the message, which
will chiefly arrest the attention of the country.
IC Is long and contradictor, with many
hades of meaning, and, unlike the colon of
the rainbow, blending into a most Inharmo
nious whole.
On the one side, is an arraignment of the
Nprth, equalling in passionate malignity, the
worst efforts of President Pierce. On the other
side, is tho assertion that the slave States hare
not a single act, executive or legislative, to
complain' of in the Government which -they
threaten to overthrow, and no good reason to
apprehend such acts hereafter.
lie distincllydenies the right of secession as
a constitutional remedy. He treats it as a
revolutionary 'right, to be regarded as justifia
ble, or not, according to circumstances.
Upon tho argent and practical question,
whether he means to enforce the collection of
custom-house dudes in States attempting to se
cede, he is not clear. For the present, he says
that the collection of such duties in South Car
olina is not resisted. But everybody believes
that it soon will be, and how Mr. Buchanan
intends to act in that emergency, probably so
near at hand, is left in a most ambiguous in
certitude. Holding that he must at all hazards
execute the laws, and at the same time, that
the nse of force against a State was not con
templated in framing the Constitut on, he has
involved himself in an entanglement, of which
the solution is by no means easy.
His practical recommendation for the termi
nation and cure of slavery agitation, is, like most
of the specifics advised within our recollection,
homeopathic in principle. He proposes to cure
agitation by increasing agitation, and to keep
the subject out of Congress, by permitting noth
ing else to be talked about. Instead of ad
vising that the Senate and House should pro
ceed to the business of the country, he advises
that they take up for debate three proposed
amendments of the Constitution, either one, of
which would consume the whole three mouths,
from this time to the fourth of March. The
negro,. in all actual and possible aspects, is to
be discussed and settled first by Congress, and
then by thirty-three States, acting upon pro
posed amendments. By the time this opera
tion is well finished, we shall have a confusion,
in comparison with which the present-period is
one of peace and harmony. This part of the
message would he ridiculous, if the attendant
circumstances did not make it melancholy.
Misstsstrri. Among the recent recommend
ations of the Governor of this State, is the
prohibition of the bringing in of slaves for
sale under any circumstances whatever, or of
their introduction, except by and with their
owners moving into the State with the view of
becoming residents and citizens. This recom
mendation is probably now made with the pur
pose of coercingthe border slave States into
the proposed Southern Confederacy, but it is,
nevertheless, only a revival of the laws of
Mississippi as they existed twenty-five years
ago. ouch laws nave, in fact, always existed
in more or less of the Southern States. They
were enacted in respect to Louisiana, by the
Congress of the United States, upon the acqui
sition of that Territory. In practice, they
have been evaded and nullified hitherto by the
pnblic sentiment of the localities concerned,
but this may not prove to be so hereafter. The
indefinite continuance of Southern markets
for their slaves, cannot bo prudently reckoned
upon by Virginia and Maryland.
Counsel or Virjinia"not Wanted. Some
person from Virginia sends a communication
to the Charleston Mercury, pledging the eastern
part of Virginia to stand by South Carolina in
her secession movements, but condemning the
expressions of the Mercury, that in the eyes of
Carolina " Virginia is completely demoralized'
Ac He further says s
" Every man's State is dear to him, and how
ever much be may condemn her judgments in
Council, when he bears her spoken ot thus, the
warm blood will leap more quickly. If Vir
ginia's overtures should be declined, in the
name of our common brotherhood, let it be
done in such a way that Virginians, who love
not the 'south and her interests less becuuse
they love their own State, may not be estranged
from the gallant little State which they look
upon as bound to them indissoluble by the rec
ollections of '76."
j.To which the Charleston Mercury replies as
follows I
" We thank our correspondent for'the above
kind assurance of the sympathy and support of
Eastern Virginia. He will pardon us, however,
if we still decline (so far as the counsel of the
JTcrcury is concerned) to enter at this time into
any" Convention or council with Virginia, or
any other State. We are now acting for our
selves, and by ourselves, upon our own sovcr
eignty. Our correspondent will also pardon us
if we doubt the ability, at this time, of any
border State to give us good counsel, or to as
sist ia forwarding our action. We nave need
for no other counsel or assistance, and will oc
cept of none other.
Personal Lidektt Laws. The Charleston
Mercury, of December 3, says i
" But we are to delay action further, to see if
the Horthern legislatures win not repeal meir
personal liberty laws. Bo far as the cotton
States are concerned, these laws, excepting in
the insult they convey to the South, and the
faithlessness they indicate in the North, are not
of the slightest consequence. Few or none of
our slaves are lost, by being carried awoy and
protected from recapture in the Northern States.
Nor to the frontier States are they of much con
sequence. Their slaves are stolen and carried
off, npt by the agency of these personal liberty
laws, but by the combination of individuals in
the Northern States."
mi Beturned from California. Among the
passengers arrived at New York on Monday,
inthe steamer Northern Light, from California,
were the Hon. Reverdy Johnson and wife, of
'Baltimore; Senators Benjamin, Gwin, and
' Baker, Col. Lander, Mnj. Wyse, and a number
of other army officers.
THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS,
Second. Session.
Tuesday, December 4, I860.
SEX ATE.
After our report closed yesterday
Mr. Clingman movod that the message be
printed. He thought it fell short of an invest
igation of the crisis before the Government
The Presidcnt'elect was known to be a danger
ous man, because he avowed the principle of
the "irrepressible conflict" party, with the
view of making war upon my section. Though
the present position of parties in Congress held
him powerless, his party would eventually con
trol tho Government, the Supremo Court in
eluded. A sectional majority absolutely has
control of tho whole Government, and it might
begin a revolution.
He did not think any of the Southern States
had acted precipitately. If such occurrences
as have taken place in the last fifteen years
had been with a foreign nation, we would have
been at war before this. In hi judgment, a
number of the Southern States would secede
within sixty days. Tho South Carolina sub
mission party was small.
The wisest thing that Congress could do
would be to divide the public property as fairly
as possible after paying the public debts. My
people are not terrified we have more territory
now than the colonics who begun the war with
Great Britain. We have four times their popu
lation. Our imports last year amounted to i
3U,ugu,Ul)u. northern gentlemen say our in
stitutions are a disgrace to the family, and
they want to have them removed. They say it
is a sin to hold slaves. If we separate, their
consciences will be clear..
He agreed with the President, that there is
no power in the Government to force a State
to remain in the Union. The most offensive
aggression would be to levy tribute, and if a
separation takes place, all the slave States
would be quiet and peaceable. They were
carrying out the policy of the fathers of the
revolution. ,
Mr. Crittenden replied, that he had hoped
they had come together as a union of friends.
He hoped, for himself, that the Union he has
so long lived nnder would be preserved. He
rose for the purpose of expressing a hope that
the example of the gentleman from North
Carolina would not bo followed. Better not
come here at all than thus act. This Union
was worthy of great sacrifices and concessions.
He looked forward with dismay at the prospect
of disunion with fear and trembling. They
must search for the means of reconciliation,
and endeavor to restore harmony. He did
hope there would bo no angry debates. North
Carolina has always carried the olive branch of
peace.
Mr. Clingman approved the desire expressed
to preserve the Union. He would be sustained
in what he had said by a majority of Unpeo
ple of his State. North Carolina was next to
the last to come into the Union, and when the
Union ceases to protect her, she will bid good
by I
Mr. Filch moved that the usual 'number (ten
thousand) of copies of the message be printed.
Mr. Hale moved to adjourn, which was car
ried. HOUSE.
The message having been read,
Mr. Sherman moved that it be referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union. Supposing that there was no desire
to debate to day, he moved the previous ques
tion. Mr. Boteler offered the following resolution,
trusting, he said, that it would meet the appro
bation ot the uouse :
" Jlcsohcd, That so much of tho President's
message as relates to the present perilous con
dition of the country be referred to a special
committee of one from each State, with leave
to report at any time."
Mr. McClernand wished to move an amend
ment, and amid repeated calls it was read as
follows :
" Resolved, That so much of the President's
annual message as relates to matters ot griev
ance between the slaveholding States, and the
proposal by Congress of amendments to the
Constitution of the United States for the ratifi
cation of the several States, and to the ques
tion of State secession from the Federal Union,
be referred to a select committee, to consist of
one from each State, to be appointed by the
Speaker ; and that such committee be instruct
ed to inquire into and report by bill, or by pro
posing an amendment or amendments to the
Constitution of the United States, or otherwise,
upon such subjects : and particularly whether
any further legislation or amendment to the
Constitution is necessary to give prompt, cer
tain, and full effect, to the last clause of the
second section of the fourth article of the Con
stitution concerning the return of fugitives from
service or labor."
Mr. Boteler declined to accept Mr. McCler
nand's amendment.
Mr. Sherman proposed to Mr. Boteler. that
instead of a select committee of one from each
State, there should be a committee of fifteen.
Cries of "oh no."
Mr. Bocock raised a question of order with
reference to the last part, of Mr. Boteler's reso
lution. A committee could not report at any
time without a suspension of the rules.
The Speaker decided that the question was
well taken.
Mr. Bocock, at the request of several, friends,
withdrew his objection.
Mr. Stanton supposed that Mr. Boteler
could accomplish his object by omitting the
last clause ot his resolution.
Messrs. Curry and Burnett renewed the ob
jection. Mr. Boteler modified his resolution by stri
king out the words, " with leave to report at
any time."
Mr. Sherman wished to offer an amendment,
leaving the House to decide as to the mode of
organizing the proposed committee.
Mr. Boteler replied, that he had specially
avoided saying how the committee should be
raised.
The Speaker said that the rules provided
that the Speaker shall appoint committees,
unless otherwise ordered.
Mr. Morris, of Illinois, wished to offer an
amendment, which ho read for information, as
follows :
" Ilesolved, That we are unalterably and im
movably attached to the Union of the States;
that we recognise in the Union the primary
cause of our present greatness and prosperity
as a nation, nud have as yet seen nothing,
either in the election of Abraham Lincoln tq
the Presidencv. or from any other source, to
justify its dissolution ; and that we pledge to
each other our lives, our fortunes, and our
sacred honor, to maintain it."
Objection was made, Mr. Boteler's resolution
being distinctly before the House.
Mr. Burnett suggested that each committee
man be selected by the State delegations.
Cries of" No "No." " That is contrary
to the rules."
Mr. Kunkel suggested, that instead of the
words, "perilous state of the country," that
Mr. Boteler incorporate in his resolution the
language contained in Mr. McClernand's prop
osition, so that the House might specifically
know what is to be referred to the committee.
The question was then on agreeing to Mr.
Boteler's resolution, as an amendment to Mr.
Sherman's motion.
Before the vote was announced, Mr, Singlo
ton, of Mississippi, said he declined voting on
this question, because the-Legislature of Ms
State had called a Convention to consider the
matter. He believed, that the people would
determine it for themselves. i
Mr. Jones, of .Georgia, remarked that his
reason for not voting was, that his , State had
also called a Convention to decide as' to her,
Federal relations, and did not want Congress
to decide lor her.
Mr. Hawkins, of Florida, said his State had
appointed some day In January for a State Con
vention to take into consideration this very
question. The people of Florida had decided
to settle, in Convention, the time, mannerand
mode of redress. It was for them, and they
will settle the question in their sovereign ca
pacity. It was not for him, therefore, to take
any action here upon the subject. He was
against all compromise now, as fie was in times
past.
Mr. Morris, of Illinois, rose to a point of or
der, that while the question was pending, it was
out of order to open debate.
Mr. Clopton, of Alabama, also declined to
vote, because his State had called a Conven
tion. ,
Mr. Gartrcll, of Georgia, said ho did not rise
to debate, but simply to say, for a similar rea
son as just assigned, he declined voting for this
proposition.
Mr. Houston, of Alabama, said he would do
all he could to accomplish great ends for the
country, and as this resolution was directed to
such a jurpose, he should vote for it.
Mr. Curry, of Alabama, next addressed the
Chair.
The Speaker inquired i Docs tho gentleman
desire to vote?
Mr. Curry. No, sir. I wish to say
The Speaker, interrupting. Objection has
been made to debate.
Mr. Curry. I, was present when my name
was called, and
Mr. Millson, at this point, objected to all dis
cussion, because it was out of order.
Mr. Curry, resuming his seat, remarked : I
never violate the rules of the House.
Mr. Davis, of Mississippi.' wished to say that
the President's messagu has to be referred
somewhere, and therefore he favored a select
committee.
Mr. Moore, of Alabama, said the reason given
by his colleague Mr. Clopton for not voting,
was the same why he would not vote.
Mr. Cobb, of Alabama, remarked, that the
reasons assigned by his colleagues were not
powerful enough for him, so he would hang on
to his vote in favor of the resolution. Laugh
ter. . Mr. Miles, of 8. C, said his State was out of
the Confederacy, except the mere form, and
therefore her delegation took no interest in this
question.
This remark was received with marked
good humor.
Mr. Pugh, of Ala., said that, as his State
was going to follow South Carolina on the lOtb
of January, he would, liko Mr. Miles, decline
to vote.
The result on the adoption of Mr. Boteler's
resolution was then announced, as follows:

The House agreed to Mr. Sherman's original
motion that the message be referred to the Com
mittee of the Whdlo on the state of the Union,
and be printed, together with Mr. Boteler's
amendment thereto, namely :
" That so much, of it as relates to the present
perilous condition of the country be referred to
a select committee of one from each State."
No question was taken on any other proposi
tion than the one above mentioned.
Mr. Boteler wished to say one word. He
knew it was the universal custom of the House
for the Speaker to appoint as chairman the
mover of a proposition for a select committee.
He wished it understood, in justice to himself
and to the great objects he had in view, that he
could not serve on the committee. He had no
idea of it.
Mr.. Morris, of Illinois, asked leave to intro
duce bis resolution (above printed) as a sepa
rate and independent proposition.
Mr. llulhn, ot norm Carolina, and others,
strenuously objected to the introduction of the
resolution.
Mr. Morris, of Illinois, hoped that the objec
tions would be withdrawn, so as to come to a
direct vote.
Ihe resolution was again read.
Mr. Phelps objected to its introduction, and
moved an adjournment ; which was carried.
Wednesday, December 5, I860.
SENATE.
The SenaU was called to order to day at pre
cisely 12 M. A prayer was offered by tho
Chaplain, Dr. Gurley. Mr. Pugh appeared
this morning, and took his seat.
The Journal was read, and a slight verbal
correction suggested by Mr. Clingman.
The report of the Treasury was presented,
and, on motion of Mr. Hale, laid on the table.
Mr. Hale mado a motion in relation to the
report of the Mississippi railroad, and requested
it be printed. Granted.
Mr. Powell moved that so much of the Pres
ident s message as relates to tho state or the
country be referred to a special committee.
Mr. Green presented -a resolution, that the
Judiciary inquire into the expediency of estab
lishing military posts' along the .line of the
border States, in Order more effectually to carry
out the laws of the country at the present
crisis ; laid over.
Mr. Cameron moved that next Monday be
the day for tho order on the appropriation bill
Mr. Lane wished to say a few words in re
lation to the unhappy condition of the country.
It is not very strange that such a state of
things should exist. The simple reason that
any man is elected Is not suflicient reason why
a State should secede) bnt shall the equality
of rights bo maintained? The verdict has
been that it shall not prevail.
The platform of tho opposition is, as I look
at it, directly in opposition to tho Constitution,
and a violation of its very spirit.
The equality must be maintained or the
Union ought not to exist.
I would do anything to save.the Union. If
the opinion of the Supreme Court of our fathers
could be given at this time, they would say
that the election of Lincoln was not constitu
tional. Mr. Hale. No doubt of iU
The South ought not to submit to it. We
should not bo .very ready to receive their
promises. I know their underground feelings.
There must be a change.
Mr. Latham presented the credentials of Col.
E. D. Baker, elected from'Oregon, which were
read.
Mr. Hale had hoped tho message would have
pleased somebody. It asserts, first that South
Carolina has just cause to secede, and secondly,
that she has no right to, and thirdly, we cannot
prevent it.
I think he ought to have recommended some
filan. I hope we shall have tho manliness to
ook the matter in the face. ,
Mr. Brown said that all 'we ask is to quietly
leave. We will not submit. We expect noth
ing ; wo ask for nothing but the privilege to
leave.
Mr. Ivcrson is speaking as we go to
press, taking nearly the same grounds as Mr.
Brown.
HOUSE.
Prayor was offered by the Chaplain, Rev.
Thomas H.Stockton.
After the reading of the Journal of yester
day Mr. Sherman introduced the invalid pension
and Military Academy appropriation bills.
Mr. G row's homestead bill was then taken op
and read.
The question recurred on the motion of Mr.
Phelps, of Missouri, to lay on the table the mo
tion of Mr. Grow, to reconsider the vote by
which the homestead bill was referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
The vote on Mr. Phelps's motion was taken
by yeas and nays ; and resulted yeas 68, nays
135.
The question recurred 'on the motion to
reconsider the vote by which the bill was re
ferred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union.
The question on the motion to reconsider was
theu put, and it was decided in the affirmative.
Mr. Grow then stated that he would'not pro
ceed to discuss this bill, unless gentlemen on
the other side desired it. A point of objection
with the President had been, that Congress
fiossesscd no power to dispose of the public
ands ; Congress bad already disposed of one
hundred and eighty million acres of the public
lands. There was no such point as this, how
ever, involved in the question. The advocates
of this bill did not propose to- give away the
public lands, though even Andrew Jackson
favored that measure. But Congress might
put the lands at any price. This bill proposed
making the lands rav for themselves.
Without discussing these points any further,
however, he would call lor the previous ques
tion on the passage of the bill.
The main question was then ordered to be
put.
The yeas and nays were called for, which,
being taken, resulted as follows : yeas 132, nays
70.
Mr. Colfax called up the Post Office bill, and
moved that it be referred to tho Post Office
Committee.
Mr. fcmitb, of Va., objected.
Mr. Sherman moved that the House proceed
under tho 130th rule, to call for bills and reso
lutions from tho States.
Mr. Kunkel, of Md., objected.
The Speaker overruled tho objection.
Mr. Sherman withdrew that motion, and that
instead, the House go into the Committee of
the Whole on tho state of the Union, and that
the military appropriation be made the special
order.
lie then moved that the different parts of the
President's message be referred to the respec
tive committees. Agreed to. '
The military appropriation bill was then read.
Pending which, our report closed.

THE KANSAS TROUBLES.
Bolivar. Mo..Dcc. 3. Col. J. T. Snider, com
manding officer of this district, who was sent to
the border by special order of the Government,
returned last night, and reports all quiet on the
line. He says tho SJate has not been invaded, nor
is there any probability at present of its invasion.
But sixteen of Montgomery's men approached
Fort Scott at any one time, and no one there
was molested in tho least. -
No attempt, he says, was.made to hold the
United States District Court, and there was no
occasion for the court to leave the Territory.
Montgomery and Jennison have thus for
hung Scott, Ilines, and Harrison, and shot
Bishop and Moore, all belonging to the Terri
tory. Col. Snyder has organized the military on
the border, and asks tbe Governor to establish

RAPID LOCOMOTION.
Baltimore, Dec. 4. Two of our city papers,
the American and Exchange, ran a locomotive
express for the purpose of conveying the Pres
ident's Message from Washington to day. The
"iron horse came through in forty-six min
utes, and brought large editions of the message.
The eager demand of the public was quickly
supplied.
THE SECESSION MOVEMENT.
Washington dispatches, in the New York
Herald of yesterday, state that the extremists of
the South care little or nothing as to the course
conservative men may pursue. They will ac
cept, but not offer, an nltimatum, the substance
of which is as follows :
1. Explicit guaranty for the faithful execu
tion of the fugitive slave law, and in default
tbe delinquent State to pay for the fugitive.
2. Express and unequivocal declaration that
the right of the slaveholder to emigrate with
bis slaves to the common territory, and to pro
tection to such property therein, shall be guar
antied. 3. That the public domain and its proceeds
shall be appropriated exclusively to public and
national purposes.
4. That the Federal Government shall be
expressly restricted from undertaking works of
internal improvements in the btates, except
only one Pacific railroad south, and one north
of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, to which
such aid is to be limited.
5. That improvements of rivers and harbors
be left exclusively to the States in which they.
are situated.
C. That a two-thirds vote of both Houses
shall be necessary for any appropriation of
money ur iuuu ur mo creauuu ui any luau.
7. A modification of the constitutional pro
vision respecting the election of President and
Vice President, abolishing the Electoral
College, and authorizing the vote to be given
directlv to the candidate, each Congressional
district giving one vote, and the Legislature of
eucn diuwj giving iwu vuiea ui large.
Washinaton, Dec. 3. Special reports from
New Orleans received to-night, via Mobile,
Montgomery, Atlanta, ic, report the "solid
men" at New Orleans in favor of the Union ;
but the majority, counting everything, aro Mis
unionists. At Mobile they were mustering,
uniforming, aud disciplining the military, and
manifesting considerable disunion fever. At
Montgomery they were all afire for disunion,
and tho same spirit was manifested at Atlanta.
The vote on the Memphis and Charleston cats,
between Corinth and Memphis, Tennessee,
showed twenty Cvo Union to thirteen disunion.
Charleston, Dec. 3 Daily tho conviction of
the people grows stronger that coercion will
be attempted. The collection of customs will
precipitate the issue. Tho moment the State
adopts tho ordinance of secession, which re
quires three days for formal consummation,
the people here will refuse to recognise any
further responsbility of the State to tbe Fed
eral Government.
Speculations concerning the strength of tbe
harbor forts form the talk of the town. Forts
Moultrie aud Pinckney are thought weak, but
Fort Sumter is a place of great strength. The
lower tier of guns has lately been mounted.
Many of tho-Charleston volunteer companies
have auietlv placed themselves at the Govern

The news of the contemplated recess of the
Legislature during the Convention, is received
here' with great' satisfaction. The people de
sire that the Convention while sitting should
have the undivided control of the act'oa of tho
State.
MilledgevilU, Dec. 3. In the House to-day.
Mr. Spreyberry, of Catorsa, moved to emend
the retaliatory bill as follows I
And whereas a compact broken by one party
is no longer binding, politically, socially, legally,
or morally, upon the other parties to it; and
whereas," in the opinion of the General Assem
bly of Georgia, the States enumerated in this
bill have grossly violated the compact of Union
by refusing to deliver up fugitive slaves t
Be it enacted, That the State of Georgia with
draw its confederated faith from all the States
which interpose obstacles to, the recovery of
our rights under the Constitution.
And it is hereby further enacted and 'decreed,
That all the officers of this State, civil o'r'mU
itary, who have taken the oath to support the
Constitution of the United Slates, are relieved
and Absolved from the obligations of such oath
in all cases in the courts of this State where
the States or the citizens of the States who re
fuse our constitutional rights are parties or
otherwise concerned. '
Mr. Sprayberry's amendment was lost by
yeas 30, nays 80.'

MilledgevilU, Dee, 3. In the House, to-day,
the preamble and resolutions proposing a con
ference of, the Southern States at Atlanta, on
the 20th of February, to counsel and advise as
to the mode and manner of resistance to the
North, in tbe existing exigency, was made the
special order for to-morrow. The preamble
and resolutions take strong grounds in favor of
having all sectional questions finally settled,
and objects to separate action.

'CHARLESTON APPOINTMENT.
Washin)ton Dec. 4. The Union men an
ticipate happy effects at tbe Sonth from the
President's powerful argument against seces
sion, but neither the public nor private interpel
lations of members Irom the gulf States justify
belief that such will be the result. On tho
contrary, it is still regarded as a fixed fact, by
most intcljigent politicians, that several of the
cotton States will secede.
Tho treasury has answered requisitions to
the amount of three hundred thousand dollars,
for compensation of members of Congress.
Two hundred thousand is for the House and
one hundred thousand for the Senate. The
members 'get their pay monthly while here, and
for the recess get their pay in gross at the end
of the session ; thus it will be seen that the
Representatives will get.but about half what
is now due them, It is understood that meas
ures to relieve the treasury will early be taken
by the proper committees in both brances of
Congress.
In respect to what is said by the President
about the forts near Charleston, it mav be
added that the Secretary of War has declared
mat ne intends to deliver over an torts intact
