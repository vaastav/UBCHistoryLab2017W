OFFICE: No. 16 i^uiucy Street*
TIUKSDAY, DEC. <i. 1?7|.
Wheeling JournuliMic Enterprise.
As usual, the liegidt\r office achieved a
triumph over its newspaper neighbor hy
distributing upon the street at four o'clock
yesterday afternoon a very comprehensive
synopsis ol the whole message, fourteen
hours in advance of any other publication
of its contents in this city. The
uyuopsis was read and appreciated by
very many of our citizens who lack the
leisure necessary /or a perusal of the entire
document?Regi*Urt yukrday.
The " triumph" aforesaid consisted in
issuing a prooi sheet, containing a single
column, of what purported to be a "synopsis"
of the President's message. Although
the slip contained no real information, the
publication of it is conceded to have
been a stupenduous bit of enterprise,
which was profoundly "appreciated" by
the few who saw it. We believe there
has never been anything like it in Wheeling.
If the readers of the two papers will
compare yesterday 's issues they will see
that the Intklmoknckh had nearly fifteen
columns of telegraphic news, while
the lituuUr had exactly half a* much.
We hud nine columns and a hulf besides
the message; (he It*outer had lew than
a column and a half. Wc had Bout*
wki.l's Report; the Reguter had not.
We had a report of proceedings in Congress,
with lull list of House Committees;
the IUyuter had no mention ot any meeting
of Congress at all. Wc freely concede
that to those who "lack the leisure" to
read the news the litgUter offers the
highest advantages.
The Suicidal Foliicx of the Democracy.
It* it were not that those who are to be
destroyed are first made mad, we sup*
pose the Democratic leaders would begin
by this time to see that the more they fulminute
against the dealings ot the Iiepublican
administration with the Ku-Klux,
the more fatally they run their
heads against a stone wall. The more
the existence and history of thus secret
league in the South hive been investigated,
the more undeniable has hccome
the evidence of its wide-spread existenco,
of its utterly infernal purposes, and ol its
atrocious practices. Ever since the war
the Democratic leaders have denied these
things. The official investigations provoked
bv their denials have dissipated
every doubt about the existence of the
order,its character, and its objects.
It has been curious to sec how as this
evidence hus accumulated the Democratic
politicians and papers have increased the
vehemcncc of their denials, and of their
denunciation of the Government as responsible
lor nil the turmoil in the Houtli
?lor they had not quite the cheek to deny
that there was some trouble there. They
have not been able to Bee, apparently,
that the more they defended the
Ku-Klux, the more the intelligent and
honest sentiment of the country condemned
them all together. The Democratic
partyJftH a national organization had
little fcnough of tl?e populur confidence at
the close of the war; but the infatuation
that has possessed its leaders to cling to
the dead rebellion, and to resist the reconstruction
of the Houth by tho dominant
party and the rcassertion of Federal authority
there, has steauily lessened that
confidence, until now they themselves
confess the organization to be on the
verge of dissolution.
Tlu?ri? ran Ik* tin dnttbt tlin hrttrr nr>nl|.
ment ol tho country thoroughly approves
what has been done by the Republican
administration to put down the Ku Klux;
and never was that approval bo strong
a* at this moment; for there has never before
heen so much and such overwhelming
evidence touching the monstrous
character of the order. The recent wholesale
confessions in fcJoutli Carolina have
laid bare the character of this league of
midnight murderers in all its hideousness;
and now more than ever tho country demands
its extinction, and will not quibble
about technicalities in the execution of
that work.
In this aspect of affairs, wc should expect
the Democratic managers would at
laat perceive their mistake. Hut no. They,
neither learn nor forget. Tho first thing
they do on the meeting of Congress in to
take up the cudgels once more on behalf
of the Ku-Klux. They want to know
whether tho action of the President in
breaking up the nefarious organization in
South Carolina, and in the arrest of men
guilty of savngerics that would disgrace
the Apaches, has been strictly and technically
regular; and Frank Ul-Ain, who.
a South Carolina K-K. confesses is (Jrand
Cyclops of tho order, hastens to olfrr the
inquiry in the Senate, as a brother Democrat
does in the House. As a matter ol
party tactics could anything be more
stupid ? Do not these gentlemen see that
by keeping their party in the attitude of
friends and defender* of ilm U' l' n.<.?
(inly strengthen the popular dint rust of
that party? Do they nut understand
that tho country now knows all about the
order, that no sympathy Is to be made
among honest men anywhere by further
attempts to white wash its infernal chatacter,
and that every effort in this direction
only cost* their party friends and
confidence.
There lias never been in political history
a blinder infatuation than Hint which
has prompted the Democratic lenders for
the last five years to resist the ejforts of
the party that was successful in the war
to reconstruct the rebel States in accordance
with its own policy. It was utterly
impossible from the first that any surli re
sistanco could succeed. Of nil the methods
of resistanco none could be so hopeless as
that of violence, seeing that a" the military
power ofthe country wns in the hands
of the dominant party and must, other
means failing, l>c employed at last with a
strong hand to put that violence down
Such violence being employed by the law*
leas element in the South, the sympathetic
party in tho North could have made no
moro fatal mistake than to attempt to conceal
or npologi/.e for its atrocious crimes.
These are some of the blunders that have
)>een committed by the Democratic party.
Having risked everything in resistance to
reconstruction, the success ol reconstruction
is necessarily fatal to iL Having
united its fortunes with those ol a lawless
organization, banded together lor
purposes of terrorism and murder, it must
ol necessity follow the lortunes of that
league and perish with iL The
time is near at hand when we are to witness
this consummation. The success of
Republican reconstruction in the South
is assured. The Ku-lvlux and the Democratic
party are alike in the throes ol
dissolution, liut the ruling passion of
the Democratic leaders is strong in death;
and while they confess themselves on the
verge of their political grave, they spend
their last moments in idle repetition o! the
follies tbut have brought them down to
their last gasp.
