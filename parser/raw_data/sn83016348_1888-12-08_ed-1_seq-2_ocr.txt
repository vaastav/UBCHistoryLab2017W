“If the people had voted for a con
tinuance of Democratic rule the Presi
dent would probably now be of the
opinion that the republic had advanced
rather than retrograded during the past
century.” —Brooklyn Times.
Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker, sister
of the late Plymouth preacher, says she
hopes to see a woman President of the
United States, and she regards Susan
B. Anthony “the equal of any man liv
ing as statesman and politician.”
General Sherman contributes an in
teresting article to the North American
Review to show that Mr. Blaine did
not want the Presidential nomination
in 18S4, and that he wrote to the vet
eran soldier urging him to accept the
honor.
A new definition of a Mugwump, but
certainly a very striking and trutnful
one, is given by Dr. E. E. Hale. He
says that “when an American citizen ■
wishes he were an English nobleman
and is not, he is properly called a
‘Mugwump.’”

Senator Quay is said by the New
York Sun to be desirous of the ap
pointment of a Southern man to the
position of Attorney General of the
United States. Replying to tne ques
tion : “Do you favor this as a means
of breaking up the solid South?” the
“little Napoleon” quickly said: “The
solid South is already broken.
One year ago President Cleveland
promulgated his views on the tariff in
his annual message to Congress, which
message his party adopted as its plat
form of principles in the presidential
contest which has just been lost to the
Democrats. Although the result of this
contest showed unmistakably that a
majority of the people were not in ac
cord with the President on this subject,
yet no one expected that he would
abandon or modify his opinions simply
because he has failed of a re-election.
His message to Congress on Monday last
was in its principle feature therefore a
re-iteration of his views on the tariff,
possibly not so vigorously, certainly
not so amiably stated as in his message
of last year. In one respect the Presi
dent’s recent message certainly is a sur
prise. It contains no reference what
ever to civil service reform, the Presi
. dent seemingly taking it for granted
that as administered by him the coun
try had heard enough upon that subject.
This failure to mention the issue on
which the President won his election is
variously explained, some maintaining
that ha has lost his early love for the
system, the experiences of the recent
election having destroyed the last ves
tiges of affection for the issue which he
maintained during three years of his
administration. But whatever threason
whicn prompted the President’s silence
on this subject, it certainly can be as
sumed that the views of a retiring exec
utive on it are of small practical import
)ance.
Concerning the tariff portion of the
President’s message, it can be truthfully
said that il is only marked by the evi
dences of temper and disappointment,
in his assault upon the manufacturers of
the country, and that his opinions are
not statesmanlike because they are
based upon business conditions that do
not exist “A crowded and constantly
increasing urban population,” says the
President, “suggests the impoverish
ment of the rural sections and discon
tent with agricultural pursuits” This
is’a tallacious assumption, not borne
out by the annual increased value of
agricultural products in this country,
and the enormouse increase in the cul
tivated acreage of the States. This fab
licy ol the President’s is well displayed
by a cotemporary who says that beyond
the fact that he argues from premises
glaringly lalse, the President seems not
to know that the evils he deplores as
consequences of the protective policy
are tenfold more apparent and menac
ing in Great Britain, which for forty i
years has maintained the tariff policy i
which the President would have this I
country adopt. Nowhere else is the '
tendency of the masses to the cities so I
pronounced as in free trade England, i
and nowhere else is the line between I
abject poverty and inordinate riches so .
vividly drawn. It is a fact that there <
the rich grow richer and the poor t
poorer. It is not the fact here. Every (
p decade extends the circle of citizens (
who are proprietors, and more men to- v
day in proportion to population than j
ever before have a stake in the soil un- a
j encumbered. c

Are gone, nor leave a single trace behind."
In the death ol mm to whose mem
ory we would pay a grateful tribute of
respect, the Bar of Maryland has lost
one of its most eminent members, and
his native county one of its most cher
ished citizens.
Those who enjoyed the honor of his
friendship, appreciate best the graces
and excellences of nis character.
Gilted with the highest intellectual
endowments, inspired in all his actions
( by the highest sense of honor, possessed
of a most unselfish nature, it was im
possible to know Alexander Evans, with
out entertaining for him a strong senti
ment of affection, even his most inti
[ mate friends forgetting the superior
, qualities of his mind, in the multiplied
“ evidences of those genial and social qual
-1 ities which adorned his character. He
won good opinions without seeming to
court them, he instructed without seem
ing to teach, he entertained without
laboring to be witty. His high profes
sional acquirements, his scholarly at
tainments, his fine literary tastes, his
brilliant conversational talents, are not
better known than his amiability of
' disposition, and his kindliness of heart,
n which ever prompted him to generous

> 'Women as School Trustees.
The recognition of the influence of
women in all matters pertaining to our
present educational systems has become
so general, that the advisability of the
- appointment erf educated women to
- official positions of responsibility and
- trust in Stale and County Boards is no
i longer a matter of experiment. In the
t leading cities of this country women
prominent for their activity in educa
tional work have recently been ap
r pointed on educational boards, while
• in the West, where public sentiment is
j more advanced than here, she is iden
-1 lifted more closely with local educa
. tional affairs. At the recent annual ses
sion of the State School Commissioners
Association held in Baltimore, one of
the principal subjects of discussion was
the question—“ Whether if legal, it is
1 n
I desirable to appoint one female on the
board of Public School district trus
-1
tees.” Examiner Squier of this county
, expressed himself as generally opposed
to the innovation, but in any case where
the services of an educated woman
t could be secured, he favored such an
I appointment as an experiment.
Examiner Beatty of Queen Anne’s
took a more advanced position on the
1 ■ r
subject and said : “Were we to listen to
1 1
the wisdom of our ancestors, we most
emphatically would say a woman should
not hold such an office; but in the
light of the present day we cannot pass
; judgment so quickly. Wherever we
find woman engaged in the different
: fields of labor now open to her, she is
: a success. She excels in art and
science. As a lawyer, physician, lec
-5 turer, teacher, she has shown unrais
: takable evidence of her ability and
: worthiness to compete with man. In
the literary world she has shone with
ever increasing luster. In the business
world she has been recognized as no
1 mean foe to cope with, she being es
-1 pecially noted for accuracy. Her sxill
in telegraphy, typewriting, woodcarving
and such work as requires quickness
: of perception and deftness of execution
i has been proven beyond doubt. As a
1 teacher of our schools she has become
• a very necessity—an important part of
, the educational body. None of us can
1 deny her superiority in governing chil
dren, not, it is true with the brute force
. of birch and black gum sapling, but by
; the gentle influence of love. Nor can
we withhold our acknowledgement of
her ability to teach, for the evidences
■ of her fitness are found in the success
of her work, the increasing demand for
her services. Even in politics her in
fluence is felt and appreciated. She is
a power behind the throne. lam glad
that man is awakening to the knowledge
of her ability to engage in pursuits other
than those of household drudgery.
Now, when the fields of literature, most
of the professions and avocations of
life, are, with open doors, ready and
waiting to receive her ; when she has
proved, by test of actual work, her
mental and physical ability to satisfac
torily perform these different duties,
shall we debar her from the trusteeship ?
Have we the right to do so? Whether
the petty c res and strifes incident
upon the business relations of men of
grosser minds will lessen or destroy
that halo of sanctity, that delicate re
finement which clothes her like an in
visible veil, whether they will detract
from the holiness of maternity, or unfit
her for the dual duties of life incumbent
upon her —-this I would not dare affirm.
1 would net dare say, “She is not fit to
be a trustee.”
Commenting upon President Cleve
land’s last message to Congress, The
New York Tribune forcibly remarks
that no one will finds his respect for
President Cleveland increased by his
passionate talk about the “selfish* £>reed
and grasping aval ice” of manufacturers
as a class, or by his suggestion that
they “improperly influence” voters, or
by his frantic assertion that corporations
“are fast becoming the people’s mas
ters.” It is not proof. No other Pres
idential candidate has ever had behind
him as powerful an array of “trusts,
combinations and monopolies” as that
which had been brought by Executive
and legislative favors to the support of
11 1
Mr. Cleveland. The telephone con
spiracy, the Sugar Trust, the whiskey
ring, the combination of Wall street ,
sharpers with bankers who hold over
fifty millions of the public money, the
Washington real estate jobbers, the
host 01 other jobs and monopolies 1
which leagued with foreign manufac- 1
turers and importers to break down an |
American policy, hoped to own the ,
Goverment alter Mr. Cleveland’s re •
election. They failed, and Mr. *
Cleveland and his free traders went (
down with them, and the decisive votes -
were cast, as everybody knows by the
plain people of the (arming regions who a
are not mastered by corporations, and v

A resolution for an amendment to
the Constitution for the elec
tion of the Presiduit and Vice-Piesident
of the United States by . direct vote of
the people has already been introduced
into Congress. There appears to be a
general agreement that the cumbersome
and, at times, dangerous machinery of
Eleetorai Colleges should be swept
away, but it is by no means agreed that
a direct vote of the people is the thing
to be substituted for the present sys
tem. II some recognition of the Slates
should be desired (as it will by those
who have made a study of the Consti
tution) that can be provided tor by a
system like that now in use, with the
exception that Electors shall be dis
pensed with and the vote of the State
be certified by S ale officers to the
Government at Washington. A direct
vote is open to at least two objections :
one, that it would ignore the union of
distinct Commonwealths; tne other,
that in close elections, tike the last, it
would open the door to fraud in making
returns. In round numoers there were
ten millions votes cast at the last elec
tion ; tne plurality probably did not
exceed 50,000. There would be great
temptation at such an election to hold
back returns from some of the States
until it should be ascertained how many
votes would be needed to settle the
result one way or the other. That a
change in the method of electing the
President is desired has been frequently
shown of late years, and the introduc
tion of this resolution may force a dis
cussion of the subject and help to bring
about some action in the matter. —

CONGRESS MEETS.
) DemocratHConsoled Wirti Flower**—Mr Mc-
Coui-ah* Opinion ot the
1 Washington, I). C., December 3, *BB.
Congress assembled to-day to begin the
end of the ceuteimial session. Tne gal
leries were crowded with people who came
- to see the assembling oi the partisans.
g eager to witness the gloom and despair of
the one and the sprightliuess and exul
- tatiou of the other side. In both expec
tations they were disappointed A
stranger in the galleries would have found
it difficult to believe that the right side of
5 the House held the representatives of a
r thoroughly routed and defeated party.
‘ By a strange irony of chance, the side ol
\ the conquered was one vast bed of roses
aud chrysanthemums. Almost every
5 Democrat had received some flowers, and
; the men who bad been defeated most
distinctly bad the most flowers. Tim
Campbell could hardly be seen behind an
} enormous bed of roses, aud Archie Bliss’
Idesk was one mass of fragrant beauty.
On the Republican side. Governor eket
& Hovey, ot Indiana, smiled out bet ween the
sides of an enormous floral horse shoe, but
his were almost the only flowers. The
1 laurel wreath of victory aud the fruits
theieof were evidently enough lor the
Republicans. The defeated had all the
3 flowers. There was good humored ebaf
a ting, aud only a very lew members were
surly. Mr. Rcd went about smiling and
3 fair as a new May morn, and the greeting
I between him aud Mr. Mills was one as of
long separated friends. Mr Randall was
* in bis seat, looking pale and worn. His hair
j is very much whiter, but be looks as
though he were good for many more years
* tocome. Mr. Mills looks unconscientiously
i well. Or all men, he certainly ought to
. look hungry aud worn. On the contrary,
he looks fat and almost jolly. Mr. Mills
5 aud Mr Randall met in an aisle. They
j bowed to each very coldly. Neither
offered the other his hand, beside the for
■ mal how, they exchanged no salutations.
But some ot Mr. Randall’s former friends
seem to have gone back to their old fealty,
I aud he held a perfect reception of Demo
I ciats, who were all eager to press his
hand.
1 Messrs. McKinley and Cannon were
j almost suspiciously cordial, considering
that iu a few mouths they will be fighting
> each other for the most important position
in the country, next to the presidency.
I Everybody almost seemed to b.t iu a good
humor, and they all felt good natured
even while the message was being read.
The Maryland Democratic members
* had but little to say ou the Presideut’ll
1 message. Privately they all w- re of the
L opinion that if Mr. Cleveland had treated
the tariff question last year as he Heated
■ civil service reform to day, they ,would
[• not now be iu the dark and gloomy hole
they are in. But, for publication, they
1 all said nice things ot the document.
They praised its broad scope, and the
complete mastery it showed of all the
; country’s foreign aud domestic affairs.
- Indeed, the opinions they expressed were
beautiful sentiments, which did equal
credit to their flow of language and their
: lovalty to Mr. Cleveland. But they were
not worth printing. B *sides, only one of
1 them heard it.
1 Mr. McComas gave no opinion of the
message at first, but, alter carefully
reading it, be said:
“Three-fourths of the message obeys
, the clause requiring the President from
I time to time to give Congress information
of the state of the Union. Though
belated, much of this inloiniaMou is
valuable. It is unfortunate that some of
the President’s wiser suggestions were
□ot given one year ago to Ibis Congress
when it began its work, instead of wait
ing until only ninety days of the life of
the Fiftieth Congress remain.
“The one-fourth of the message most
emphasized is the first part. I was puz
zled by it as I listened. Was the Presi
dent only confessing belore the public
his ill humor over his defeat, or was he
trying, less than thirty days after the
people rendered their emphatic verdict
against his free trade theories, to persuaue
them that the magnitude of his defeat
was the measure of the ignorance and
blindness of the American people ? Three
mouths after this century of Congress
began Washington, the farmer president,
signed the first protective tariff.
“Throe mouths before that century
ends this President, iu an ill humor,
abuses the farmers for defending a pro
tective tariff, whica he says is their great
est grievance. Eighty-three thousand
for Harrison and the tariff in Kansas, the
state of farmeis, is a significant com men
tary upon this part of the message. lam
sorry, on account of the business of the
country retarding by one- year's dispute
over the tariff, that the President incites
the Democratic H use to oppose all plans
for reductiou of the revenue which do
not conform to his plan, which the people
have just repudiated. This is unpatrio
tic. The President thus unites the
extravagance and demoralization he de
precates. But the Republican Senate
w ill at once proceed to pass ilie S mate
Tariff bill, mindful that at the elections
the people have declared for a reduction,
which will uot injure our wag > earueis
or producers, and have declared against
the President’s* theory,”L-ong> ess should
deal only with “the condition that con
fronts us.”
THE CONTEST FOR MU. COMPTON S SEAT.
Mr. R. Suowdeu Hill, of Upper Marl
boro, Prince George’s County, was in the
city to-day. Mr. Hill is one of the attor
neys for Mr. Sidney Mudd, and is busy
collecting testimony iu the case ol Mr.
Mudd, who will contest the election of
Mr. Compton. Mr. Ui’l says that the
will be promptly brought up as soon
as the Fifty first Congress assembles, ami
that he looks for Mr. Mudd’s sneedy vin
dication and his being early seated. He
further stated, that in all of ttie contests
to be brought before the new Congress
Mr. Mndd's would be the quicket aud
easiest disposed of.

Philadelphia, Monday, Dec*. 3. 1888.
The biggest, brightest full

News ever issued is the one
for December, just out. 112
pages, and maybe fifty choice
illustrations picked from new
Holiday Books. If you care
to know what the publishers
have been doing for this Christ
mas season, ask Book News.
The whole story is between its
covers ; a complete list, some
thing of the scope and character
of most of the books, and in
every case the Wanamaker
prices—always lair and gener
ally below anybody else’s.
That’s the Holiday side of
Book News ; the other- sides
are there just as usual. We
mean Book News to be your
quick and sate guide to every
thing that counts in the world
of books or among book peo
ple. 50 cents a year. The
mammoth Holiday number sent
to any address for j cents.
Plaids are at their brightest.
A wealth of them, as if every
tartan possibility had been sun
, stamped on these warm, soft
, wools.- We don’t pretend to
count them. There’s noth
ing short. Stripes and cluster
stripes and broken stripes,
. prism tinted, crossed, cris
crossed and tangled. Nothing
that seems dull or dead.
Let one of the quietest,
simplest styles stand for all. A
• plaid camel hair, cut into half
inch squares by half-inch wide
stripes both ways, and sprinkled
- with bright specks like butter
\ cups in a June meadow. A
first-class, good weight, 42-inch
[ stuff. It has been $1.25, now
-75 c. Not a grain of reason for
| the drop, or for the drop in
r dozens more dress stuffs—ex
-1 cept that we don’t wait till sun
down of a season to do such
' things.

such another gathering of rich

You can put in half an hour
among them and see a new de

More and more room for
Handkerchiefs. It is always so
this time of year. 84 feet of
counters does very well for
samples, but that’s before the
quick steps of the Holiday
buying begins. There is now:
One long counter for Silk Handkerchiefs.
One long counter for Men's Linen Hamlker
chieis.
Two long counters lor Women's Linen Ham!
kerchiefs
The Linen is pure Linen.
We’ve said that time and
again, but you can’t hear it
too often. It would be much
easier for us to get cotton-and
linen or all-cotton Handker
chiefs, just as most other stores
do. It would be quite as easy
to keep on in the common rut
and call them “Linen.’’ But
we don’t do things that way.
Linen is Linen here, just as
everything else in the store is
exactly what we say it is.
The little Handkerchiefs for
boys and girls are just as true
flax as the big ones for bigger
folks. You may have them
printed revered
embroidered scalloped *
hemstitched diced
or with fancy sewing.
Let one kind—Ladies’ Em
broidered White Linen Hand
kerchiefs—show how varieties
run: One hundred and fifty
six distinct styles . 35c to $4
each. Everyone new this sea
son. We never had anything
approaching them for sorts.
And we’ve make no count of
the thicket of Women’s White
Linen Handkerchiefs, embroid
ered or hemstitched, at 25c
and under (a wonderfully good
one at 12 '2 c), or of the higher
flight into white, lace edged
goods up to $6 each.
Women’s plain White Linen
Handkerchiefs, yf, 1,
and 2 inch hems, $1 to $4.20
a dozen.
We believe our Women’s
12 b c white nnlaundered Ini
tial 1 landkerchiefs the best for
the money ever sold. Dimes
do as much accordingly for you
in another grade.
Misses’ Handkerchiefs, scal
loped, hemstitched, embroid
ered and printed, 10 to 35c.
Boys’ Colored Handker
chiefs, woven border, 5,6, and

And so the story runs—but
you haven’t had half of it.
