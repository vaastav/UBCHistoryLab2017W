WHAT IS HEALTH WORTH?
The address delivered in this town
last Friday night by Hr. McCor
mack, of Bowling Green, Kentucky,
deserved a crowded house ol thought
ful listeners.
It may seem too altruistic to be
credible that the National Medical
Association whose members make
their living by treating the sick,
should be engaged in a campaign of
education to show the public how
to keep well, but it is one of the many
healthy signs that man’s humanity
for man is ever broadening and that
this is one ot its noblest fruits.
Discussing from our consideration
all other phases of the question, we
cannot financially afford to get sick
if it is possible to keep w T ell (a) be
cause we can’t afford the expenses of
being healed, and (b) because we
can’t afford to become for an indefi
nite time mere consumers instead of
producers. To use the words of the
Doctor, “The drain upon the ma
terial resources of the people of this
county every year from preventable
sickness and deaths and from vicious
living is almost beyond the concep
tion of the finite mind. In actual
dollars and cents it is estimated to
amount to more than the taxes paid
for all purposes.”
The case comes squarely before us
then whether the state can afford to
allow this continuous drain on her
financial resources, to say nothing
of the mise v. suffering and woe at
tendant upon sickness and death. She
refuses a “walkover” to the criminal
class, and at great cost maintains a
department of justice; she aims to
check illiteracy and ignorance, de
manding in stead an intelligent electo
rate, and so at great expense builds
up a public school system for the
education of her rising generation.
And yet her watchful care and police
protection for the genera! health of
her people is limited to one health
officer for the county at the nominal
salary of one hundred and fifty
lollars per annum. We are strong-
Jv inclined to accept the proposition
of Dr. McCormack that it would be
as reasonable that our judge on the
bench should be engaged in the
practice of law as for the county
health officer to be engaged in the
practice of medicine while filling that
office.
The work which should fall to his
lot, both from his abundance and its
delicate nature, precludes the possi
bility of piivarepracticeanditsfaith
ful performance at the same time.
If then it is reasonably true that
the health, comfort and convenience
of all citizens could be materially im
proved; that the sick could be more
intelligently treated; that the tr ain of
distressing burdens which follow in
the wake of sickness and death could
be greatly lightened; and that the
productive capacity of our people
could be thereby vastly increased the
advisability of broadening the oppor
tunies, the duties and consequently
the pay of a county health officer
admits of no debate. Our present
representatives in the legislature are
particularly equipped to take up the
question and give the county the
fruits of their best efforts.
"IN GOD WE TRUST.”
Probably no action of president
Roosevelt has caused more comment
than his recent order abolishing from
the face of the new ten dollar gold
piece the above motto. With the
sourage of ids convictions and his
characteristic style of expression, the
president has taken up the the ques
tion and given at length his reasons
for this action.
From th standpoint of law, for
some years past the motto has been
placed on our coins with no other
authority than that of precedent. It
was first authorized by Congress in
1864- and approved by the Secretary
of the Treasury when it was stamped
upon the new two cent piece then
issued. Later it was omitted from
the Revised Statutes, but has been
retained by custom.
In discussing its omission the
president says among other things,
'My own feeling in the matter is due
to my very firm conviction that to
put such a motto on coins, or to use
it in any kindred manner, not only
does no good, but does positive harm
and is in effect irreverence, which
comes dangerously close to sacrilege.
A beautiful and solemn sentence such
as the one in question should be
treated and uttered only with that
fine reverence which necessarily im
plies a certain exaltation of spirit.”
Such a line of argument, if ad
vanced when the proposed inscrip
tion was first considered, would
have been worthy of careful consid
eration; and doubtless many irrever
end remarks due to its existence
would have been avoided during the
campaigns of 1896 and 1900 if it had
■— aaplMl ——.— c
never been stamped upon our coins.
But it is one thing to plant and
another thing to uproot. So deeply j
is the Christian religion implanted in
the bosoms of the American people
that any blow to a symbol which
typifies it is looked upon as a blow
at religion itself.
We even hear the clergy in some
cases assert that “the religious sen
tinent of the American people has
been effaced.” Of course this is not
and could not be true, but the feel
ing is genuine and there is no com
pensating advantage for having
aroused it, therefore it was unjusti
fiable and unfortunate.
And is not this one of the many
illustrations which our strenuous
President is daily furnishing that
while possessed with abundance of
sense he falls lar short in that stock
of saving common sense which
counts for so much in every day life?
Does not the president in emulating
the virile, rugged courage (often
braggadocio) of the rough rider tend
to foster an esprit du corps more in
keeping with primitive civilization
than with the best accepted standard
of manhood for the twentieth cen
tury?
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
Congress having convened on
Monday in regular session, the Presi
dent’s message was duly transmitted
to and read in each branch on Tues
day. With a deep dip of his pen the
President produced a document
which, measured by the yard is re
plete with greatness.
With the fullest measure of confi
dence in his previous utterances he
still more loudly calls for govern
ment control of railroads and other
great corporations, and is fully ready
to take in the small ones too on the
basis that of doing business beyond
a state limit they are subject to
Federal control. On this subject how
ever he finds many strong minds
doubting the legal force of his propo
sition.
On the currency question, which is
the all absorbing question of the
day, in the vain effort to stem the
tide of what is generally called the
“Roosevelt panic” he goes no further
than to recommend in general terms
provision for expansion of the cur
rency in times of stringency under
such a restrictive tax as would
prompt its retirement as soon as the
emergency shall have passed. The
general platitude in all of its indefi
niteness sounds salutary, and we
trust that a Moses may arise in Con
gress who will give us something
more tangible than a dream to grasp;
just at present something very real
and practical is sadly needed.
On the subject of the tariff be stands
pat till after the presidential election
except on the subject of admitting
free woodpulp for the manufacture
of paper. This concession, if granted
should be enough to make every suf
fering publisher worship at his shrine,
as at present the paper trust is hold
ing them by the throat and smiting
on hip and thigh.
Like many of his previous utter
ances he has shown his democracy in
spots by appropriating some of their
cardinal principles, such as an in
come tax, arbitration of labor dis
putes, stricter Federal control oi
trusts and railroads with a necessary
enlargement of the powers of the In
terstate Commerce Commission,
checking government by injunction,
and a comprehensive system of im
proved inland waterways.
His recommendations on the latter
subject, on the preservation of forests,
and on land drainage are some of the
topics on which all good citizens will
probably unite in endorsing. It
would seem to the casual observer
that the message could have profita
bly stood a severe boiling down
without doing it an injury as a
literary production or as a state
paper.
