HOME TROUBLES
Are avojdod to a great extent by fur
nishing your table with Highgrade
Meats and Poultry from the Peoples'
Market. It is exasperating for the
tired business man to tind a tough and
dry roast of beef before him for dinner,
or poor Chops for breakfast. When
you buy your Meats at this market you
get prime, tender and juicy meats,
delicious poultry and fresh fish.

Lord NorthclilTe has been made a

feels the Hired of further advancement
he will write another letter to the
premier criticizing Etiglaud and then
will probably be made an earl.
The drait men, who have not yet
been called or enlisted, are up against

to know the law and to keep their lo*

short notice.
The president has approved the
recommendation of the food adminis
trillion that the alcoholic content of
beer be reduced to a per cent rnaxi

reduced to approximately 70 per cent
of that formerly used.

President Wilson, in his message

way what needs to be done to further

patently necessary it will fulfill its
full purpose.
Meatless days have brought, a storm
of complaint, from Chicago packers,
who say their products are overllow

Here is a valuable hint for the Amer

times, compel a reduction in prices
by a little judicious abstaining from
meat once a week.
Registrants for the^national army

must notify the ollicials where they

the responsibility upon individuals
to keep in touch with the govern

to exemption.
A few newspapers have been advo
cating that the idea of "smokeless

It seems more than likely that ordi

Violators of the food law who come
under the license plan are to have

does not come under the liceuse plan
is to have bis supplies cut off unless
he sells at the right prices, and all
jobbers are supposed to know that he
doea so.
PIERRE. SOUTH DAKOTA. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 13, I9J7
THE BUDGET SYSTEM
President Wilson, in his address to
congress, requested the house of rep
resentiitivis, where all appropriation
bills must originate, to return "to its
former practice of initiating and pre
paring all appropriation bills through
a single committee." llis statement
caused a little ripple of surprise, for
not many of the men who heard him
were aware that once it had been the
custom to prepare all appropriations
bills through a single committee.
This is not surprising, for not many
of his hearers are such studeuts of
American history as the president
and', since the custom was abandoned
almost a hundred years ago, it is not
likely any of those now in the halls
would remember it.
Congress originally appropriated
all goveriynent monies on the budget
plan, a single appropriations commit
tee having charge of all expenditures.
The present scheme of permitting
many committees to do this was de
vised by Henry Clay, for exactly the
same purpofe as causes the continu
ance of the plan today, for the polit
ical power it gave him and the party
in oilice.
Clay's plan of scattered financial
responsibility is as antiquated today
as Andrew Jackson's theory Hint "to
the victor belong the spoils." We
have to a considerable extent repudi
ated Jackson's misconception of po
litical reward by the civil service act
that relieves the. nation of a chaotic
upheaval of governmental depart
ments every four years. Clay's ill
conceived scheme of scattered appro
priating power should have been
abolished at the same time.
Unfortunately this millstone of
politics has been permitted to hang
about the neck of the government un
til today, although the need for a re
turn to the budget system has long
been recognized. Today we can no
longer permit the present scheme of
affairs to continue Congress is ap
propriating billions where it once ap
propriated millions, and the need for
economy has grown in proportion.
Under the present system, duplica
tion is so constant that it is the rule
rather than the exception, wl*cb
itial.tfs for appalling waste. By the
budget 8) stern, concentrating impro
priations in a single committee, this
duplication would be avoided, vtfhi.le
at the.same time other important ec
onomies could be instituted through
the removal of strong partisanship
for a measure.
THE RAILROAD SITUATION
The interstate commerce commis
sion has proposed two solutions to
the problem now facing the railroads.
Uoth involve assistance lrom the gov
ernment. Coming from so competent
a source it is impossible to ignore the
recommendations.
The lirst plan asks the suspension
of laws prohibiting pooling, a govern
ment cash loan and an increase in
freight rates. The second plan, which
was adopted in England, proposes
the government take over and man
age the railroads, guaranteeing them
a fair return on the investment, the
upkeep of the property to be assured.
Of the two plans the first seems pre
ferable. Tlie second plan is practi
cally equivalent to government own
ership, a thing to be shunned at this
critical time when elliciency is the
greatest need- It requires but cur
sory examination of governmental
departments now existing to see to
what extent railroad elliciency would
sutler under government control.
That the lirst plan is proposed by
thai body which has the lixing of
railroad freight rates is indicative of
the justice in which the commerce
commission holds the railroads' plea
for greater revenues. The commerce
commission has ever endeavored to
hold down freight rates and the ad
mission that an advance is now need
ed, in the face of higher operating
costs, should be sufficient for the
American people. Likewise, the
commerce commission must believe
that the railroads can be operated
under a pooling arrangement with
fairness to the shipper, which should
he assurance enough.
Assuredly something must be done
to increase the elliciency of the rail
roads. We know that freight ship
ments are being delayed twice longer
than would take to transport them to
their destination by reason of the
railroads' division ol authority which
makes efficient operation impossible
while rolling stock is so scant. Hav
ing our own observations and the
assurance ot a body of experts in the
matter there is no need for hesitancy.
As for tbe government loan to the
railroads—the government's gener­
-f ""f.
osity in the early days made possible
the present development of the rail
roads. A loan today would be bet
ter tiuancial judgment than such
wholesale grants of the public do
main as were once* made without a
murmur from the people.
FIRST NAVAL LOSS
TO AMERICA IN WAR
Washington, Dec S—Torpedoed in
a night attack, tin- American destroy
er Jacob Jones, one of the newest
and largest submarine hunters of her
class, was sunk Thursday night in the
war zone, and two-thirds of her crew
lost. The disaster brings to the
American people the. lirst naval loss
of great consequence since tin coun
try entered the war.
THE BUDGET SYSTEM
America, having declared war, did
not hesitate to throw every ounce of
its strength into the task of winning it.
Congress, which a few years ago re
sponded to the sensation of having ap
propriated a billion dollars for carrying
on the government, without turning a
hair passed appropriations for nearly
twenty billions.* Millions were handled
as careless an thousands had heretofore
been regarded and thousands were
counted merely as the nickles and
dimes.
The nation, recovering from the first
intoxication of enthusiasm, is now be
ginning to realize the burden there is
apparent a growing desire among the
people to know what these billions of
dollars are being spent and to be as
sured that they are going to get their
money's worth. Even members of con
gress have become appalled with the
easy lightness of their own work and
there is a sentiment among the leaders
for abetter knowledge of what is being
done with the huge war appropriations.
There is but one way in which the
American people can be assured of an
end of the prodigal extravagance that
has marked our government since its
founding. We must follow tbe exam
ple of every European nation and adopt
the budget system of apropriations. We
must abandon forever the lump sum
appropriation and must get down to
brass tacks in handling our moneys.
We must know exactly, not approxi
mately, what everything is going to
cost.
Appropriating two billion dollars for
battleship construction is reckless ex
travagance, not because of the sum
but because of the total lack of definite
knowledge of the cost of the proposed
construction. it might be thut the
work planned could be done for two
million dollars less than two billions,
but if two billion dollars are available
you may be sure they will be spent and
that extra two millions will be entirely
wasted. The same is true of every
other government appropriation.
Vagueness in estimating the require
ments of governmental departments is
no longer excusable. In other coun
tries governmental departments are
required to specify their needs to the
fraction ot a dollar. America has
reached the time when it must do the
same thing.
SENATE FOR IMMEDIATE^WAR
Washington, D.:c. 7 —With less
than one hour's debate the senate to
day passed the resolution declaring
war on Austria. The resolution was
adopted by the senate unanimously,
7J to 0. Senators Gronna, of North
Dakota, Norris of Nebraska, ana
Vardaman of Mississippi, who voted
against the German war declaration,
supported the resolution. Senator La
Follette of Wisconsin, left during the
speech-makiug and did not cast his
vote.
Meanwhile there is every indication
that the resolution will pass the
house with only oue dissenting vote
—Representative Louden, socialist.
House members were so sure of that
that they deserted the chamber in
droves to escape the speech making
and return later for the voting.
After the house acts tbe two reso
lutions will be reconciled or one sub
stituted for the other.
It begins to look like a merry go
round on the question of raising rail
road rates, the latest being a raise of
40 per cent on iron and steel being
shipped west. Every time the wage
earner wants enough to live on from
the reilroads they insist on three
times as much in increased freight
rates and seem to get it. Tbe same
thing appears to apply on coal and
other necessary articles. There will
have to be a halt some place pretty
soon or an entire readjuatnijnt ot all
wages and prices.
i-p
I
Lord Lansdowne wants to compro
niise with Germany, to give up the
struggle before the lofty aims of the
lighting democratic nations have been
attained, lie is apparently even will
ing to subscribe to a pro-German
peace, since tht^, ib the only sort of
peace that is attainable now. He
would bow before the forces of tri
umphant barbarism-—to "save civili
zation."
It is saf to assume that Lord Lans
downe is not speaking for himself
alone. lie has been a leader of Brit- 5
ish aristocracy that class in Eng.
land that, corresponds to the ruling
class in Germany, lie has spoken^
for his class before. Is bespeaking
for it now? I
Americans may be pardoned for the I
suspicion that the British aristocracy
in spite of the sacrifices it has made
in this war, has not looked with fav
or on the allies' new slogau, "to make
the world safe lor democracy. "Menf
of the Lansdowne type do not regard:*
democracy as a nigh'type of civiliza
tion. They suspect "the mob." They
believe, lor instance, that Germany1
is better governed than America, be*
cause America is in the hands of "the
rabble." They are dismayed by the
growth of the democratic spirit in
Great Britain.
With this in mind, it is easier to
understand what Lanedowne and his
aristocratic followers mean when
they express fear that a prolongation
of the war may result in "the de*
atruction of civilization." They do
not have in mind the democratic civ
ilization that nourishes in America.
They are thinking of the sort of civ
ilization that used to prevail in Brit
ain, before the days of Lloyd George,
when Lansdowne and his crowd were
in power ol the present day civiliza
tion ol Germany and Austria and
Turkey, where a "select few" control
the destinies of millions.
ff the war continues to its logical
end it is a foregone conclusion that
the sort ol civilization that Lans
downe. believes In will be destroyed
or at least greatly altered. Tbe en
tente nations will be more democrat
ic than ever, and even Germany will
be democratized. The civilization
that has been developed in America
aud that has made this nation tbe
greatest moral force in the world will
not be destroyed it will be given new
life tfed continue to grow until its in
lluence is felt in every corner of the
earth.
A PRAYER
"Teach us not to drive through life
without skidding into other people'6
business. Preserve our brake lining
that we may stop before we are ditch
id. Help us to find the knocks in out
own motors and harken not so much to
the clashing of the other man's gearB.'
Keep the screws in our heads as tight
as we would like to .have the screws
in our automobiles, and never let us
lose sight of the fact that people who
Jive in gasoline houses should not throw
matches around other people's houses."

Since the puplication of Lord Lans

has been much discussion in all the

his assumption that a prolongation
