President Wilson Will Likely Deal
With Subject in a Special Message.
Speeding up of Program is Urged
By All.
Washington. The high cost of liv
ing and what steps the Federal Gov
ernment can take to control it .assum
ed proportions as a national question
with the convening of Congress,
which overshadowed all other issues
in the first day's proceedings.
Possibility that President Wilson
will deal with the subject in a special
address grew stronger.
Eleven bills and resolutions, seek
ing to check the soaring prices of
food by stopping shipments to Eu
rope, reducing parcel post rates on
foodstuffs or controlling cold storage,
were introduced in the house.
President Gompers and a commit
tee of the American Federation of
Labor called on President Wilson and
asked him to appoint a special com
mission to investigate the food ques
tion. The President assured them
that the government would take some
steps to meet the situation. He is
understood to prefer not to appoint a
commission as it practically would be
without authority to compel testi
mony; while a congressional investi
gation probably would mean a pro
tracted delay.
Reports being gathered by the De
partment of Agriculture are being laid
before the President as fast as they
are compiled and upon them he is
expected to decide on any action,
which undoubtedly will be prefaced
by a special address to congress.
One report submitted by Secretary
Redfield and held confidential as yet,
r,re in hnw a widft marein
between prices paid to producers and
those paid by consumers. In a recent
address the President virtually charg
ed the middlemen with responsibil
ity for the high cost of living.
RESIGNATIONS OF THREE U. S.
DIPLOMATS TENDERED WILSON
Washington. The first resignations
from the -diplomatic corps, which are
expected to be the forerunners of oth
ers as a consequence of President Wil
son's re-election and the closing of his
first term, were announced.
Dr. Henry Van Dyke, minister to
the Netherlands, has resigned and
probably will be succeeded by John
W. Garrett, of Baltimore, formerly
minister to Argentina. Dr. Van Dyke
it was explained, has been concerned
over his health for some time and also
desired to return to his literary work
after being abroad nearly four yeas.
The resignation of Thaddeus A.
Thompson minister to Colombia and
William M. Hornibrook, minister to
Siam, also were announced. Mr. Thom
son was appointed in 1913. Mr. Horn
ibrook was appointed in 1915.
Some time ago it became known that
the government was expecting that
members of the diplomatic corps would
in a'cordance with custom, forward
their resignations.
AMERICANS IN CHIHUAHUA
SAFE SAYS LATEST REPORT
El Paso, Texas. Reports telegraph
ed by government agents to Washing
ton that a number of foreigners had
been killed in Chihuahua City when
Villa bandits occupied the town, were
met with a statement by General Tre
vino, commanding Carranza forces
that reoccupied the capital that only a
few Chinese were killed during the
time Villa occupied the city.
General Trevino's statement tele
graphed in response to an inquiry by
Andres Garcia, inspector general of
Carranza consulates, was taken by
Garcia to mean that no other foreign
ers were killed The informtlon tele
graphed Washington was said to have
been obtained in Juarez.
Villa's bandits were retreating
north toward the border the night be
fore Chihuahua city was evacuated by
Carranza troops.
WIVES OF MISSOURI FARMERS
FIGHTING BAN ON EGGS
St. Joseph, Mo. Wives of the farm
ers in the vicinity of Harmony, Mo.,
have combined to fight the boycott on
butter and eggs declared by the house
wives of St. Joseph and Maryville,
Mo. It is said they would refuse to
sell butter and eggs for use in either
of the towns.
KING GEORGE ACCEDES TO
WAR COUNCIL OF PREMIER.
London. The expectation that an
explanation of the Csbinet crisis and
its solution would be forthcoming
when the House of Commons met was
not realized. Premier Asquith simply
announced King George had approved
his proposal for reconstruction of the
government which was forced by the
demand of War Secretary Lloyd
George and other ministers for a
smaller war council with powers inde
pendent of the cabinet.
The Countess von Bernstorff, wife of
the German Ambassador, his returned

several years in Europe.
ROUTED CARRANZA'S MEN
BRING THE STORY OF FIVE DAYS
FIGHTING BEFORE RETIRE
MENT FROM CITY. .
Piles of Dead in Chihuahua Covered
With Oil and Burned When Villa
Enters City. Bandits Sing and
Shout in Santa Rosa Hill Charge.
Juarez, Mexico. The remnants of a
Carranza army that fled from Chihua
hua City after a battle with Villa
troops are in camp on the plains south
of Juarez. They bought with them
the story of the evacuation of the city
after four days and nights of fighting.
The dead were piled high in the streets
when they left and had been covered
with oil and burned, they said.
The troops brought back many of
their field pieces. Women camp fol
lowers shared in the retreat. Some
of them had children said to have been
born on the battlefield.
Refugees said that between the
cemetery and Santa Rosa hill the
dead covered the streets. Along the
streets near the railroad station and
surrounding the station, one of the
refugees said he saw many cavalry
horses with carbines and sabers at
tached to the saddles. The Carranza
cavalrymen abandoned them in order
to leave the city on the troop train.
Along Zarco avenue the fighting had
been fiercest and many civilians had
been killed there and in other parts
of the city by shell fire and rifle balls.
Many houses were damaged.
Defenders Routed Fifth Day.
All of the refugees agreed that
Carranza troops were winning during
the . first four days of the fighting, but
either because of a shdrtage of ammu
nition or lack of morale, they abandon
ed the city early on the fifth morning
of the battle, fleeing in all directions.
The taking of Santa Rosa hill, which
always has been known as the "key
to Chihuahua," was said by one foreign
refugee to have started the retire
ment of the Carranza forces, which he
said, resembled a rout before the last
train left.
One civilian refugee claimed that
General Gonzales Cuellar was respon
sible for the taking of Santa Rosa
hill, where he was in command as he
allowed the infantry line to be weak
ened. It is believed by the refugees and
Carranza officers that General Trevino
left first for Tabaloapa, 'south of the
city and from there moved to Aldama,
about 20 miles from Chihuahua City.
One Mexican civilian refugee de
clared he had seen Villa in the city
Monday morning. He said Villa was
walking with crutches, as if to inspire
his men with fortitude. He looked
much thinner than of old.
To obtain medicines for his wound
ed, Villa is said by this refugee to
have broken into two drug stores in
the city. Thinking this action meant
the beginning of looting Villa bandits
broke into stores and private homes.
Villa is said to have shot two of his
followers and succeeded in stopping
the pillaging.
WILSON OBSERVED DAY
QUIETLY WITH FAMILY.
Washington. President Wilson
spent Thanksgiving Day quietly with
members of his family but at night
he accepted an invitation to attend
the Navy Relief Society ball at the
Washington Navy Yard.
With Mrs. Wilson, he attended his
regular Pjesbyerian Church, having
declined invitations to the Pan-American
mass at St. Patrick's Church and
to a joint celebration of Methodist
Churches.
CONSUMER IN GRIP OF COLD
STORAGE TRUST SAYS PROBER.
New York. The existence of an In
terstate combination of cold storage
houses to keep up food prices was
charged by Joseph Hartigan, commis
sioner of weights and measures, who
as secretary of Mayor Mitchell's com
mittee is investigating the cost of liv
ing. "There is a so-colled storage
trust," Mr. Hartigan said. "Its mem
bership comprises 75 cold storage
warehouses in New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut."
High Cost of Living is Likely to Re
ceive Attention. Leaders Want No
Holiday Recess as Time Is Short
For so Much Work.
Washington. Speaker Clark and
Representative Kitchin, Majority
Leader of the House, assured Presi
dent Wilson at a White House confer
ence that they would do all they
could to hasten the passage of rail
road legislation at the short session of
Congress which began Monday.
The President summoned the House
leaders to talk over with them the
legislative program and to secure
their co-operation in expediting im
portant measures. Legislation to sup
plement the Adamson law,' he said,
was of the utmost importance and he
asked that this be given precedence
in consideration over all other gen
eral legislation.
Realizing that three months is a
short period for consideration of gen
eral measures when appropriation
bills also must be passed, the Presi
dent asked the House leaders if they
thought there would be time for en
actment of new railroad laws before
March 4. Both told him they thought
there would be, and promised to ex
ert every effort to economize time on
t other matters.
Speaker Clark reminded the Presi
dent that Congress would have to pay
strict attention to business, and him
to help at the outset to eliminate the
usual two weeks' holiday recess.
President Wilson spoke briefly re
garding other important measures,
among them the Webb bill to permit
domestic corporations to maintain
collective foreign selling agencies, the
corrupt political practices bill and
conservation measures. Proposed em
bargo" legislation and issues raised
by the high cost of living were not
mentioned at the conference, although
the House leaders believe the subject
is bound to demand attention of the
congress.
WILSON TURNS FLOOD OF
LIGHT ON STATUE OF LIBERTY,
Roar of Salute Sounded From Great
Guns of Atlantic Fleet.
New York. At a wireless signal
flashed by President Wilson from the
yacht Mayflower in the harbor here
the Statue of Liberty was bathed in
light. Bartholdi's famous symbol of
American freedom, which for 30 years
has been a token of welcome to the
United States to millions of immi
grants from every land, will be illumi
nated every night hereafter from top
to bottom. Funds to install the perma
nent lighting system for the Statue,
the gift to the United States of 400,
000 citizens of France were provided
by subscription in this country.
"I light this Statue," said the Pres
ident, "with the thought that it may
always stand as a symbol of our pur
pose to throw upon liberty, out of
out own life as a nation, a light
which shall reveal its dignity, its se
rene power, its benignant hope arid
spirit of guidance."
Grouped around the President up
on the Mayflower's deck as he flash
ed the signal were Mrs. Wilson, Jules
J. Jusserand, Ambassador of France,
Madame Jesserand, high officers of
the army and navy and representa
tives of several nations.
The great guns of a division of the
Atlantic fleet anchored in the harbor
as a guard of honor, boomed a salute
as the statue flashed into view, out
lined in white light. The whistles of
countless harbor craft shrieked in uni
son and flares of red light blazed up
along the shore.
There was' a flash of flame high,
above the statue and Ruth Law in her
airplane added a spectacular touch to
the ceremonies of illumnation. Spout
ing sparks and fire from the tail of
her machine, she circled the lower
end of Manhattan Island.
PREMIER OF BRITAIN NOW
FAVORS NEW WAR CABINET.
London. Premier "Asquith has de
cided to advise the King to the recon
struction of the Government. The
statement reads:
"The Prime Minister, with a view
to the most effective prosecution of
the war, has decided to advise his
majesty the King, to consent to the
reconstruction of the Government."
The political crisis has become acute.
It is stated that David Lloyd-Georgs
has tendered his resignation.
U. S. OFFICIALS ANXIOUS
OVER VILLA'S PROGRESS.
Washington. While they wait for
General Carranza to accept or reject
the protocol signed by the joint com
mission at Atlantic City, Administra
tion officials are giving much atten
tion to every report relating to the
activities of Villa and to rebel move
ments in other parts of Mexico. Addi
tional information reached the State
and War Departments tended to con
firm the reports of Villa's capture of
Chihuahua City.

TEUTONS MAKE ADVANCES
FIELD MARSHAL MACKENSEN'S
ARMY HAS CAPTURED GIUR
GIU IN ADVANCE.
Forces of Central Powers Are Now
In Possession of Curtea de Arges,
90 Miles From Bucharest, and
Giurgiu, 40 Miles From the Capital.
London. With the forces of the
Central Powers in possession ac
cording to German official reports,
which hitherto have proven accurate
with regard to the recent events in
Rumania of Curtea de Arges, an im
portant railway terminal 90 miles
from Bucharest, and Giurgiu, on the
railway 40 miles southwest of the
Capital, anxiety as to the fate of
Bucharest is greatly increased.
Field Marshal von Mackensen's
capture of Giurgiu, shows that his
armv has advanced 30 miles in a
single day. Further, a Bulgarian of
ficial communication claims that the
Danube has been crossed near Lorn
Palaka and Vidin and the town of
Kalafatu, opposite Vidin, captured.
Nohting is yet admitted by the
Rumanians of these enemy advances,
but it is assumed that the Rumanians
are contxiuing their orderly retire
ment toward the line of the Argesiu
River. A danger, however, lies in
the possibility of this retirement not
being effected quickly enough to pre
vent an attack on their flank from
von Mackensen's forces at Giugriu,
from which point there is both rail
and direct communication to Buch
arest. It is impossible to doubt that the
situation is viewed here with the
greatest misgivings. The question is
being frankly asked whether the ac
cession of Rumania to the Entente
Allies cause his brought strength or
weakness, whether Russia has ren
dered the assitance which might
have been expected from her and
whether the Allies might not have
shown more initiative in attack from
Saloniki whether the collapse in Ru
mania is due to any lack of unity in
the Allies' plans of strategy or wheth
er it is due in large part to Ru
mania's hasty invasion of Transyl
vania. BUY LAYING HENS AND EAT
CORN TO CUT LIVING COST!
Speaker Champ Clark Advises This as
Quicker Than Governmental Rem
edies to Combat High Prices.
Washington. If the high cost of
living bothers you, don't wait for gov
erment remedies, but buy some lay
ing hens and eat more corn products
and rice, says Speaker Clark. Not
that he does not think the government
can help bring down the price of food
stuffs by legislative or other action,
but he pins greater faith in more di
rect methods.
Thus the speaker expressed himself
on the high cost of living problems,
which he regards as one of the great
est facing the nation. Referring to
Representative Fitzgerald's embargo
bill, he said:
"There may or may not be a chance
for Mr. Fitzgerald's proposed bill. It
might do some good I don't know.
AUSTRIANS PAY RESPECT

Vienna, via London. The doors of
the black-draped Hofburg Chapel,
where rests the silver casket with the
body of the late Emperor Francis Jos- '
eph, were opened at 8 o'clock. The j
wiating throngs of people then began '
to file through to pay their last re-
spects to the deaded emperor. All
classes were represented, rich and
poor, gentry and working men and wo
men standing shoulder to shoulder
in the crowd.
Will Use All Power to See That inwar
state Commerce Moves Uncloggefe
and Unchecked by Any Illegal Com
bination in the Restraint of Trade.
Boston. Investigations of the high
cost of living which are now being
made by Federal officials or agents
throughout the country will be direct
ed by George W. Anderson, the Uni
ted States attorney for this district,
it was announced here. Attorney Gen
eral Gregory, according to a state
ment issued by the United States at
torney's office, has asked Mr. Ander
son to take charge of the investiga
tions, so "that the work may be 'co
ordinated and made as effective and
rapid as possible."
"While technically the jurisdiction
of the Department of Justice is only
to deal with illegal restraints of inter
state commerce, the investigation will
take a rather wide range, and all per
tinent facts and informations will be
used as effectively as possible to bring
about a co-ordination between govern
ment and business forces.
"Undoubtedly other departments of
the government, like the Department
of Agriculture, the Department of
Commerce, the Federal Trade Com
mission and the Interstate Commerce
Commission will have data and views
which will be of the greatest assist
ance in this matter.
"Of course the Department is un
der no delusive notion that It can
make short crops long or manufacture
or repair needed freight cars but it
does propose to use all power within
the government's control to see that
interstate commerce moves unclogged
and unchecked by any illegal combina
tion in restraint of trade."
BANDITS IN CHIHUAHUA
LOAD TRAINS WITH SPOILS
Carranza Officers Believe Villa is Pre
paring to Evacuate City After Loot
ing It. Chinese Refugee Reports
Massacre of Many Chinamen.
Juarez. Villa bandits were reported
to be loading two trains with loot from
the stores and residences of Chihuahua
City and preparing to follow these
trains west on the Mexican Northwest
ern Railroad, according to a message
received at military headquarters from
General Uzuna's scouts at Sauz.
General Ozuna's cavalry column was
at Cuilty, the first station south of the
state capital, the report said. This
news was taken at headquarters to in
dicate the intention of Villa to evacu
ate the city after looting it as he did
at Parral, Santa Rosilia and Jiminez.
Villa made a speech against for
eigners in Hidalgo Plaza, following
his occupation of the city, a Chinese
merchant who left Chihuahua City said
upon his arrival here. In his speech,
Villa warned all residents of the city
against hiding any foreigners in their
homes and declared he intended to
kill them all, the Chinese added. Vil
la also said he intended to confiscate
all foreign property and give it to the
Mexicans.

which would be called "Mount Calm."
He will continue to call Lincoln, Neb.,
his home. "By spending the summer

home more and yet be near enough to
come to Washington whencsve it may
be desirable to do so."
MEXICAN ENVOY TALKS

Washington. Although no official
news of the rout of the Carranza
forces at Chihuahua by Villa came to
the State or War Departments or to
the Mexican Embassy, Eliseo Arre

after conferences with Secretaries
Lansing and Baker, expressed the be
lief that the unofficial reports were
true and ascribed the Carraaza forces'
defeat to a lack of ammunition-

Raleigh. Governor Martin G Brum
baugh, of Pennsylvania, in the VloMnT
address before the North Carol n
Teachers' Assembly, told the teacher
that in the next twenty years state
legislatures and the congress of th&
United States will increasingly iegis
late to safeguard the people in their
hours of leisure. He foresaw the
passing of the saloon, the gambling
den and the development of com
munity amusement institutions to the
extent that it will be said that the
government makes it hard for men to
do wrong and easy for men to Ao
right. a
Governor Brumbaugh's speech came
at the end of one of the busiest days
that the North Carolina Teachers' As
sembly has experienced, it came
too, after the close of stormy sessions'
when the problems of elections of of
ficers, constitutional amendments and
teacher certification had been fought
over in dead earnestness. Governor
Locke Craig and Governor-elect Rivv.
ett, who were on the program for ad-
dresses, were not present, Governor
Craig being out of the city and Governor-elect
Bickett having to return,
home upon the advice of a physician.

minutes warning, Lieutenant-Governor
Gardner did the honors for both,

ing. All associations making up the as
sembly adjourned after the election of
