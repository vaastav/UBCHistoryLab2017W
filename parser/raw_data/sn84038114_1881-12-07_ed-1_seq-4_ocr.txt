The Verdict of "MOT «UILTT"a
Uwuwral ftiirprl**-Talk of'
LynciilDK the Krkmfd Man.
In a late edition of yesterday's llR*
publican, tho verdict of the jury in
tuo Neal ease was briefly announced.
To-day we are enabled to give the lol-i
lowing particulars

that i lie Neal jury had agreed upon a
Verdin,.
.The Court directed that Mr. Higgins
be hem lor, and that Neal bo brought
into the nock. Alter Neal was seated
.Judges. W
ne remained pertec..y quiet, his gener
al expression being Mini ot anxiety.
•me minutes beiore Mr. Hig
gins arrived,and w hile waiting tor him
the jury Were brought in.
The Clerk of the Court, polled the
jury and tin li asked the usual ques
tion, "Do you lihd the prisoner at the
bar guilty or not guilty, in manner and
form,as lie stands indicted?" A breath
less silence seemed to settle over the
Court room fora moment, which was
broken by the voice ot the foreman of
thejury as ho am-wered ina low tone
"Non tit'i ltv.'' Men who had be
present during tin* whole trial, and
li.-tened to me chain of evidence
that the State had forged around the 1
prisoner could not believe their own
ears, and asking the nearest bystander
if they had ht-ar.i aright, turned away
thinking that an eminent Pennsylvania
J udge was correct, wh. n lie said that,
Out the Almighty knew what
the verdict ofap-tiit jury would be,"
Immediately alter rendering their
veidict thejury left the court room and
Neai was commanded to stand up.
I'heChief .Justice then said: •'Wil
liam Neal, the jury
you have rendered i
guilty
eustotiy."
Neal was taken out of the Court room
between the

tipst ves and con
dacted to a carnage which was in some
mjHierious manner alrejyly provided

away as there were serious threats ot
g him. not omy by persons out
M-le bin also by many who were in the
Court room.
A number of the jurors were ap
proached yesterday afternoon after the
rendering of the\erdict, but very little
information could lie obtained. Late
last night, however, a repre sentative of
the Hkitiu.h an succeeded in obtain
ing tile following, wliieu is believed lo
be correct:
Immediately after retiring on Satur
day evening a ballot was taken which
re -aired in two lor conviction, four for
acquittal, and six who had not made lip
their minds.
Four ballots were taken on Saturday
night with about, the same result, ami
about half past ten, word was sent
dowu to the Judges who were stall in
their parlor, that there was no h >pe of
agreeing that night.
»>u Sund iy
jury men complained of being sick and
Dr. Kirehner was called in t-» prescribe
tor t hem.
During Sunday a number of ballots
were taken, and on the eighth and
ninth, It was evident that a feeling in
tin* prisoner's favor was extending, as
the last taken showed that there were
ho were in favor of cleai*
ruing several of the
seven -
mg him, only two tor conviction, and
three wim had no sullied opinion upon
tin* matter.

lot was taken, and resulted iu a vcruict
of acquittal.
Oui uilormant stated that there were
serer.il considerations th.it influenced
! of which
the jury iu their act;
was t,nat they thought the evidence of
Mrs Gosscr contradictory in
loaterial points, and it was hinted that
if the jury had been instructed that
they could have rendered a verdict of
