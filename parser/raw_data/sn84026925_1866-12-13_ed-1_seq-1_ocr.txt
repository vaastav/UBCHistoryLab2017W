PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE^
Washington, December 3, 1866.
^noon, precisely, the Senate and House
of Representatives, having assembled in
their respective Chambers, were oalled to
order by their Presiding Officers
After prayer by the Chaplains, the Private
Seoretary of the President made his
appearance and presented the Annual Mes
nace of the President of the United States,
?o~
which was read as follows :
THE MESSAGE.
Fellow citizens of the Senate
and House of Representatives :
After a brief interval, the Congress of
the United States resumes its annual legislative
labors. An all-wise and merciful
Providence has abated the pestilence which
ieited our shores, leaving its calamitous
traces upon some portions of our country.
Peace, order, tranquillity and civil authority
have been formally declared to exist
throughout the whole of the United States.
In all of the States, oivil authority has superseded
the co-ercion of arms, and the
people, by their voluutary aotion, are maintaining
their Governments in full activity
and complete operation*. The enforcement
of the laws is uo^nger "obstructed in any
State by combinations too powerful to be
suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial
proceedings;" and the animosities engendered
by the war are rapidly yielding to
tbe beneficent influences of our free institutions,
and to the kindly effects of unrestricted
sooial and commercial intercourse.
An entire restoration of fraternal feeling
* must be the earnest wish of every patriotic
heart, and we will have accomplished our
grandest national achievement when, for
getting tbe sad events of the past, and re
membering only their instructive lessons,
we resume our onward career as a free, pros
perous and united people.
THE SUJJJE17A' Oi tttifilUHAilUn
In my message of tbe 4th of Dooember,
1865, Congress was informed of the meas
nres which had been instituted by the Executive,
with a view to the gradual restoration
of the States, in which the insurrec
tion occurred, to their relations with tbe
General Government. Provisional Governors
had been appointed, Conventions called,
Governors eleoted, Legislatures assembled,
and Senators and Representatives chosen
to tbe Congress of the United States -?
Courts had been opened for the enforcement
of laws long in abeyance. The blockade
bad been removed, custom houses re-established,
and tbe internal revenue laws put io
force, in order that the people might contribute
to the national income. Postal operations
had been renewed, and efforts were
being made to restore them to their former
condition of efficiency. The States themselves
had been asked to take part in the
high function of amending the Constitution,
and of tnus sanctioning toe extinction or
African slavery as one of the legitimate resalts
of onr internecine struggle.
Having progressed thus far, the Executive
Department found that it had acoom
plished nearly all that was within the soope
of its constitutional authority One thing,
however, yet remained to be done before
the work of restoration could be completed,
and that was the admission to Congress of
loyal Senators and Representatives from the
States whose people had rebelled against
the lawfal authority of the General Government.
This question devolved upon the
respective Houses, which, by the Constitu- j
tion, are made the judges of the election", j
returns and qualifications of their own mem- j
bers, and its consideration at once engaged !
the attention of Congress.
In the meantime, the Executive Depart- j
ment?no other plan having been pioposed
by Congress?continued its efforts to perfect
aa far as was practicable, the restoration of
the proper relations between the citizens of
the respective States, the States, aDd the
Federal Government, extending, from time j
to time, as the public interests seemed to '
require, the judicial, revenue, and postal!
systems of the country. With the advice i
and consent of the Senate, the necessary
officers were appointed, and appropriations
made by Congress for the payment of their j
salaries. The proposition to amend the j
Federal Constitution, so as to prevent the j
existence of slavery within the United
States or any places subject to their jurisdiction,
was ratified by the requisite number
of States; and on the 18th day of Decern-1
ber, 1865, it was officially declared to have i
become valid as a part of the Constitution
of the United States. All of the States in j
tnhioh the insnrrentinn had misted. T>romDt
rfB"w" ""v ' /" ~ ' r r |
ly amended their Constitutions, so as to f
make them conform to the great change thus !
affected in the organio law of the land ; de- !
clared null and void all ordinances and laws !
of secession ; repudiated all pretended debts '
and obligations created for the revolutionary
purposes of the insurrection ; and proceeded
in good faith, in the enactment of measures i
for the protection and amelioration of the 1
oondition of the colored race. Congress, i
however, yet hesitated to admit any of these !
States to representation ; and it was not un-1
til towards the close of the eighth month
of the session that an exception was made
in favor of Tennessee, by the admission of
her Senators and Representatives
I deem it a subject of profound regret that;
Congress has thus far failed to admit to seats
loyal Senators and Representatives from the
other States, whose inhabitants, with those :
of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion. !
Ten States?more than one-fourth of the
whole number?remain without represents-1
tion j the seats of fifty members in the
House of Representatives and of twenty
members in the Senate are yet vacant?uot
by their own consent, net by a failure of
election, but by the refusal of Congress to
accept their credentials. Their admission,1
it is believed, would have accomplished
much towards the renewal and strengthening
of our relations as odg people, and re- <
moved serious cause for disoontent on the <
part of the inhabitants of those States. It
would have acoordod with the great prinoi- i
pie enunciated in the Declaration of American
Independence, that no people ought to
bear the burden of taxation, and yet be do <
nied the right of representation. It would
have been in consonance with the express i
provisions of the Constitution, that "eaoh |
State shall have at least one Representative" '
and ?that no State, without its consent, '
shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in
? ?> Sonotn " Those nrnpisinns Wfirn intend

ed to secure to every State, acid to the people
of every State, the right of representation
in each Hoasc of Congress; and so important
was it deemed by the framersof the
Constitution that the equality of the States
in the Senate should be preserved, that not
even by an amendment of the Constitution
can aoy State, without its couseut, be denied
a voice iu that branch of the National
Legislature.
STATUS 01 THE UNREPRESENTED STATES. I
It is true, it has been assumed that the 1
existence of the States was terminated by the
rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and 1
that the insurreotioo having been surpres
Red, they were thenceforward to be cotiBid- '
erea merely as cooquered territories. The 1
Legislative, Executive, aod Judical De- (
partmeots of the Goveromeot have, bow- 1
ever* with great distinctness and uniform :
consistency, refused to sanction an assumption
so incompatible with the nature of our (
republican system, and with the professed 1
objects of the war. Throughout the recent (
legislation of Congress, the undeniable faot 1
makes itself apparent, that these ten poiiti '
oal communities are nothing less than '
States of this Union At the very com- 1
mecement of the rebellion, each House 1
declared with a unanimity as remarkable as 1
it was significant, that the war was not ^
"waged upon our part, in any spirit of op- k
pression, nor for any purpose of conquest '
or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing 1
or interfering with the rights or established 1
institutions of those States, but to defend ^
and maintain the supremacy of the Consti- 1
tution and all laws made in pursuance I
thereof, and to preserve the Union with all 1
the dignity, equality, and rights of the '
several States unimpaired j and that as soon [
as these objects were accomplished the c
war ought to cease." In some instances,
Senators were permitted to continue their
legislative functions, while in other instan- (
oes Representatives were elected and ad f
mitted to seats after their States bad for- t
maily declared their right to withdraw from t
the Union, and were endeavoring to rnaiu- c
tain that right by force of arms. All of t
the States whose people were in insurrection, i
as States, were included in the apportion- f
meut of the dirent tar of twentv millions \
of dollars annually laid upon the United <
States by the Act approved 5th August, 1
1861. Congress, by the Aot of March 4, 1
1862, and by the apportionment of repre- ?
sentation thereunder, also recoguizcd their t
presence as States in the Union ; and they 1
have, for judicial purposes, been divided <
iuto distriots, as States alone can be divided, t
The same recognition appears in the iecent *
legislation in reference to Tenuessee, which ?
evidently rests upon the fact that the func- (
tious of the State were not destroyed by i
the rebellion, but merely suspended; and i
that principle is of course applicable to I
those States which, like Tennessee, at (
tempted to renounce their places in the 1
Union. c
The action of the Executive Department *
of the Government upon this subject has t
been equally defiuite and uniform, and the 1
purpose of the war was specifically stated 1t
iu the Proclamation issued by my predeces- '
sor on the 22d day of September, 1862. c
It was then solemnly proclaimed and de J
clarcd that "hereafter, as heretofore, the ^
war will be prosecuted for the object of t
practically restoring the constitutional re- I
lation between the United States and each 1
of the States and the people thereof, in 1
which States that relation is or may be sus ?
pended or disturbed." '

Judicial Department of the Government t

Courts.
Iq the admission of Senators and Representatives
from any and all of the States,
there can be no just ground of apprehension
that persons who arc disloyal will be clothed
with the power of legislation; for this
could not happen when the Constitution
and the laws are enforced by a vigilant aud
faithful Congress. Each House is made
the "judge of the elections, returns, and
qualifications of its own members," and :
may "with the concurrence of two-thirds, j
expel a member." When a Senator or
Representative presents his certificate of
election, be may at once be admitted or re- 1
jected j or, should there be any question as
to the eligibility, his credentials may be '
referred for investigation to the appropriate 1
committee. If admitted to a seat, it must
be upon evidence satisfactory to the House
of which he thus becomes a member, that i
he possesses the requisite constitutional and ]
legal qualifications. If refused admission
as a member fur want of duo allegiance to I
the Government, and returned to his constituents,
they are admonished that none
but persons loyal to the United States will |

of the Nation, and the political power
and moral influence of Congress are thus
effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty
to the Government and fidelity to the
! Union. Upon this question, so vitally
affecting the restoration of the Union and
the permanency of our present form of
government, my convictions, heretofore ex:
pressed, have undergone no change; but,
j on the contrary, their correctness has been
confirmed by reflection and -time. If the
admission of loyal members to seats in the
respective Houses of CoDgress was wise and
expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and
expedient now. If tbis anomalous condition
is right now?if, in the exact oonditioo
of these States at the present time, it is
lawful to exclude them from representation,
I do not see that the question will be
changed by the efflux of time Ten years
benoe, if these States remain as they are,
the right of representation will be no stron
ger?the right of exclusion will be do
weaker.
rUE NECESSITY FOR SPEEDY RESTORATION.
The Constitution of the Uuited Statos
makes it the duty of the President to re3onimend
to the oonsideratiou of Cougresa
"such measures as he shall judge necessary
:>r expedient." I know of no measure more
imperatively demanded by every consideration
of national interest, sound policy, aod
equal justice, thao the admission of loyal
members from the now unrepresented
Stales. This would consummate the work
af restoration, and exert a most salutary
influence in the re establishment of peace,
harmony, and fraternal feeling. It would
tend greatly to renew the confidence of the
American people in the vigor and stability
pf their institutions. It would bind us
more closely together as a nation, and enable
us to show to the world the inherent and'
recuperative power of a Government founded
upon the will of the people, and estabished
upon the principles of liberty, justice,
ind intelligence. Our increased strength
md enhanced prospeiity would irrefragably
iemonstrate the fallacy of the arguments
igaiDst free institutions drawn from our relent
national disorders by the enemies of
epublican government. The admissioo of
oyal members from the States now exoluded
:rom Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension,
would turn capital, now awaitdst
an ODDortunitv for investment into cban
o rr '
iels of trade and industry. It woald alienate
the present troubled condition of those
States, and, by inducing emigration, aid in
he settlement of fertile regions now unculivated,
and lead to an increased production
>f those staples which have added so great- 1
y to the wealth of the nation and the com- '
nerce of the world. New fields of enterjrise
would be opened to our progressive
)eopie, and sood the devastations of war
vouid be repaired, and all traces of our do- 1
nestic differences effaced from the minds of 1
>ur Countrymen.
A WARNING AGAINST CONSOLIDATION.
In our efforts to preserve ''the unity of
government which constitutes us one peo)le,"
by restoring the States to the condition
which they held prior to the rebelliou,
ve should be cautious, lest, having rescued
>ur nation from perils of threatened disiu;egration,
we resort to consolidation, and
n the end absolute despotism, as a remedy
'or the recurrence of similar troubles. The
var having terminated, and with it all oc:asion
for the exercise of powers of doubt:'ul
constitutionality, we should hasten to
)riog legislation within the boundaries pre
icribed by the Constitution, and to return
;o the ancient landmarks established by our
'atbers for the guidance of succeeding gen
srations. "The Constitution which at any
,ime exists, until ohanged by an explioit
lud authentic act of the whole people, is 1
lacredly obligatory upon all." "If, in the
)pinion of the people, the distribution or
nodification of the constitutional powers be
n any particular wroDg, let it be corrected
)y an amendment in the way in which the 1
Jonstitution designates. But let there be
io onange Dy usurpation; "tor it is tne._
lustomary weapon by whi?b free Governnents
are destroyed." Washington spoke
hese words to his countrymen, when, folowed
by their love and gratitude, he volunarilj
retired from the cares of publio life.
'To keep in all things within the pale of
mr constitutional powers, and oherish the
Federal Union as the only rock of safety,"
vere prescribed by Jefferson as rules of ac
ion to endear to his "countrymen the true
mnciples of their Constitution, and pronote
a Union of sentiment and action equaly
auspicious to their happiness and safety."
Jackson held that the aotiou of the Gene
-al Government should always be strictly (
sonfined to the sphere of its appropriate duies,
and justly and forcibly urged that our
jovernmeDt is not to be maintained nor our
LJnion preserved "by iuvasions of the rights
ind powers of the several States. In thus
Utemptiog to make our General Government
strong, we make it weak. Its true
itrength consists in leaving individuals and
Slates as much as possible to themselves;
n making itself felt, not in its power, but
.nits bene-ficence; not in its control, but
,n its protection; not in binding the States
mope closely to the centre, but leaving each
:o move unobstructed in its proper constitutional
orbit." Theso are the teaohings
jf men whose deeds and services have made
them illustrious, and who, long since withdrawn
from the scenes of life, have left to
their country the rich legacy of their example,
their wisdom, and their patriotism ?
Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons,
let us emulate them in love of country and
respect for the Constitution and the laws.
FISCAL AFFAIRS
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
rr J. ...L >n .1 ?i.\n i?rtnrnntl n#? iKn
ury anO?U3 LUUUU luiuiuiauuu icopcunug Duo
revenue and commerce of the country. His
views upon the currency, and with reference
to a proper adjustment of our revenue system,
internal as well as impost, are commended
to the careful consideration of Congress.
In my last anuual message I expressed
my general views upon these subjects.
I need now only call attention to the
necessity of carrying into every department
of the Government a system of rigid accountability,
thorough retrenchment, and
wise ecouomy. .With no exceptional nor
unusual expenditures, the oppressive burdens
of taxation oan be lessened by suoh a
modification of our revenue laws as will be
consistent with the publio faith, and the
legitimate and necessary wants of the Government.
The report presents a much more satisfactor;
condition of oar finances than one
year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated.
Daring the fiscal year ending
the 30th of June, 1865, the last year of the
war, the public debt was increased $941,902,537,
and on the thirty-first of October,
1865, it amounted to $2,740,854,750. On
the 31st day of October, 1866, it had been
reduced to $2,551, 310,006, the diminution,
during a period of fourteen months, commencing
September 1, 1865, and ending
Ootobor 31, 1866, having been 8206,379,565.
In the last annual report on the state
of the finances, it was estimated that during
the three quarters of the fiscal year ending
the 30th of Juoa- Ust, the debt woUlcTbuIncreased
8112,194,947. During that period,
however, it was reduced 831,196,387, the
reoeipts of the year having been 889,905,905
more, and the expenditures 8200,529,235
less than the estimates. Nothing could
more clearly indicate than theso statements
the extent and availability of the national
resouroes, and the rapidity and safety with
which, under our form of government, great
military and naval establishments can be
disbanded, and expenses reduced from a
war to a peace footing.
During the fiscal year ending the 30th of
June, 1866, the receipts were 8558,032,620,
and the expenditures 8520,750,940,
leaving an available surplus of 837,281,680.
It is estimated that the receipts for the fis
oal year ending the 30th June, 1867, will
be 8575,061,386, and that the expenditures
will reach the sum of 8316,428,078, leaviog
in the Treasury a surplus of 8158,633,
rv Art ti . i ? *r n A
duo. Tor the nscal year ending J one dU,
1868, it is estimated that the receipts will
amount to ?436,000,000, and that the expenditures
will be 8350,247,641?showing
an exoess of ?85,752,359, in favor of the
Government. These estimated receipts muy
be diminished by a reduotion of exeroise
and import duties; but after all necessary
reductions shall have been made, the revenue
of the present and of following years
will doubtless be sufficient to cover all legitimate
charges upon the Treasury, and leave
an annual surplus to be applied to the payment
of the principal of the debt. There seems
now to be no good reason why taxes may
not be reduced as the country advances in
population and wealth, and yet the debt be
extinguished within the next quarter of a
century.
THE ARMY.
The report of the Secretary of War furnishes
valuable and important information
in reference to the ope'rations of his Department
during the past year. Few volunteers
now remain in the service, and they are being
discharged as rapidly as they can be re
plaoed by regular troops. The army has
been promptly paid, carefully provided with
aa I (rnntmnnt m a 1 1 oKnl tnrnrl n n rl an k
UiLUiV/ai uuaimtuij nun oiiuiigic<4 uuu auusisted,
and is to be furoisbed with breech
loading small arms The military strength
of the natioD has been unimpaired by the
discharge of volunteers, the disposition of
unserviceable or perishable stores, and the
retrenchment of expenditures Sufficient
war material to meet any emergency has
been retained, and from the disbanded volunteers
standing ready to respond to the
national call, large armies can be rapidly
organized, equipped and concentrated. Fortifications
on the coast and frontier have
received, or are being prepared for more
powerful armaments ; lake surveys and harbor
and river improvements are in course of
energetio prosecution. Preparations have
been made for the payment of the additional
bounties autboriied during tha raoant aes - *
fion of Coogress, under such regulations as
will protect the Government from fraud,
and secure to the honorably discharged sol
dier the well earned reward of his faithfulness
and gallantry. More than six thous
and maimed soldiers have received artificial
iiuibs or other surgical apparatus, and forty
one national cemeteries, containing the
remains of 104,586 Union soldiers, have
already been established The total esti
mate of military appropriations is $25,205,569.
THE NAVY.
It is stated in the report of the Secretary
of the Navy, that the naval foroe at this
time consists of two hundred and seventyeight
vessels, armed with two thousand
three hundred aud fifty-cme guns. Of these,
one hundred and fifteen vessels, carrying
one thousand and twenty nine suns, are in
commission, distributed chiefly among seven
squadrous. The number of men in tbe
service is thirteen thousand six hundred ?
Great activity and vigilance have been displayed
by all the squadrons, and their
movements have been judiciously and efficiently
arranged in such manner as would
best promote American commerce, and protect
tbe rights and interests of our countrymen
abroad. The vessels unemployed are
undergoing repairs, or are laid up until
their services may be required. Most of
the iron clad fleet is at League Island, in
the vioioity of Philadelphia, a place which,
uutil decisive action should be taken by
Congress, was selected by the Secretary of
the Navy as the most eligible location for
that class of vessels It is important that
a suitable public station should be provided
for the iron olad fleet. It is intended that
these vessels shall be in proper condition for
any emergenoy, and it is desirable that the
Bill accepting League Island for naval purposes,
which passed the House of Representatives
at its last session, should rcoeive
final action at an early period, in order that
there may bca suitable public station for this
class of vessels, as well as a navy-yard of area
sufficient for the wants of tbe service, on the
Delaware River. The Naval Pension fund
amounts to ?11,750,000, having been increased
$2,750,000 during the year. The
expenditures of the Department for the fiscal
year ending 30th June last were S43,324,526,
and the estimates for the coming
year amount to ?23,568,436. Attention is
invited to the condition of our seamen, and
the importance of legislative measures for
their relief and improvement. The sug
gestions in behalf of this deserving olass
of our fellow-citizens are earnestly recotn
mended to the favorable attention of Congress.
POSTAL APPAIB8.
The report of the Postmaster General
presents a most satisfactory condition of the
postal servioe, and submits recommendations
which deserve the consideration of Congress.
The revenues of the Department
for the year ending June 30, 1866, were
?14,386,986, and the expenditures $15,352,079,
showing an excess of the latter of
985 093 Tn antininatinn nf this dpfinian.
1" ? ?r "
oy, however, a special appropriation was
made.fry Congress ,ip the .aot. approved July
123* 18t?b including the standing appropriation
of 8700,000 for free mail matter,
as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet
remaining unexpended, the actual deficiency
for the past year is only 8265,093?a sum
within 851,141 of the amount estimated in
the annual report of 1864. The decrease
of revenue compared with the previous year
was one and one-fifth per cect., and the increase
of expenditures, owing principally
to the enlargement of the mail service in
the South, was twelve per cent. On the
80th of June I i?t there were in operation
six thousaod nine hundred and thirty mail
routes, with an aggregate length of ooe
hundred and eighty thousand nine hundred
and twenty one miles, an aggregate annual
transportation of seventy-one million eight
hundred and thirty-seven thousand nine
hundred and fourteen miles, aud an aggregate
annual cost, including expenditures, of
88,410,184. The length of rail road routes
is thirty-two thousand and ninety-two miles,
and the annual transportation thirty million
six hundred and nine thousand four hun
dred and sixty-seven miles. The length of
steam boat routes is fourteen thousand three
hundred and forty six miles, and the anuual
transportation three million four hundred
and eleven thousand nine hundred and
sixty-two miles. The mail service is rapidly
increasing throughout the whole country.

aod its stead; extension in tbe Southern
States iodioates their constaatl; improving
condition. The growiug importance of tbe
foreign service also merits attention. The
Postoffioe Department of Great Britain and
our own have agreed upon a preliminary
basis for a Dew Postal Convention, wbioh it
is believed will prove eminent); beneficial
to the commercial interests of the United
States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction
of the international letter postage
to one half the existing rates; a reduction
of postage with all other countries to and
from, which correspondence is transmitted
in the British mail, or in closed mails
through the United Kingdom; the establishment
of uniform aod reasonable charges
for the sea and territorial transit of correspondence
in ciosed mails; and an allowance
to eaob Postoffice Department of the
right to use all mail communications established
UDder the authority ol the other for
the dispatch of correspondence, either in
opeo or closed mails, on the same terms as
those applicable to the inhabitants of the
country providing the means of transmission.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
The report of tbe Secretary of the Interior
exhibits the condition of those branches
of the public service which are committed
l : Tv iL . I..*. ? i
[0 Dis supervision, inuring me last uscai
year, four mil lion six buudrcd and twentynine
thousand three hundred and twelve
acres of public land were disposed of, one
million eight hundred and ninety two thouswere
entered under the Homestead Act ?
The policy originally adopted relative to the
public lands,.has undergone essential modifications.
Immediate revenue, and not the
rapid settlement, wus the cardinal feature of
our land system. Long experience aod
earnest discussion have resulted in the convictiou
that the early development of our
agricultural resources, and the diffusion of
an energetic population >ver our vast territory,
are objects of far greater importance
to the natural growth and prosperity than
the proceeds of the sale of the land to the
highest bidder in open market. The preemp
tion laws confer upon ;he piouoer who complies
with the terms tley impose, the privilege
of purchasing a limited portion of "unoffered
lands" at the ninimum price. The
homestead enactmens relieve the setthr
from the payment of purchase money, and
secures him a permioent home, upon the
condition of residents for a term of years.
This liberal policy invites emigration from
the old, and from themore crowded portions
of the new world. Its propitious results
are undoubted, and will be more signally
manifested when tiuo shall have given to
it a wider development.
Bail road iand grants.
Congress has madi liberal grants of public
land to corporations, in aid of the construction
of rail roals and other internal
improvements. Shculd this policy hereaf- 1
ter prevail, more strngent provisions will be '
required to secure i faithful application of ;
the fund. The tith to the lands should not i
pass, by patent or oherwise, but remain in i

tion of suob grant, and thus to exclude the |
inception of a sulsequent adverse right.?
A breach of the onditions which Congress I
may deem propei to impose should work a 1
forfeiture of clam to the lands so with- !
drawn but uncorveycd, and of title to the I
lands conveyed ffhich remain unsold.
PACriO RAIL ROAD. <
Operations a the several lines of tho ,
o
Pacific Rail Road have been prosecuted with <
unexampled vigor and success. Should no 1
unforseen oauses of delay oocur, it is oonfi- <
dently anticipated that this great thorough- i
fare will be completed before the expiration i
of the period designated by Congress. i
PENSIONS. 1
Daring the last fiscal year the amount 1
paid to pensioners, inoluding the expenses
of disbursement, was thirteen million four
hundred and fifty nine thousand nine hun- 1
dred and ninety six dollars; and fifty thou- |
sand one hundred and seventy seven names J
were added to the pension rolls. The en- '
tiro nnmW nf nonainnnM T.? r?i*
pvuo.vuv.o, l/UUD UV, iOW,
was ooe buodred and twenty six thousand
seven hundred and twenty two. This faot '
furnishes melancholy and striking proof of '
the sacrifices made to vindicate the consti- f
tutiona! authority of the Federal Govern- '
meut and to maiotain inviolate the integrity '
of the Union. They impose upon us cor- '
responding obligations. It is estimated that 1
thiriy-three million dollars will be required J
to meet the exigencies of this branch of the ^
service during the fiscal year. * '
INDIAN TREATIES. *
Treaties have been oonoluded with the t
Iudians who, entered into armed opposition
to our Government at the outbreak of
the rebellion, have unconditionally sub- ?
mitted to our authority, and manifested an
earnest desire for a renewal of friendly rela- i
tions j
PHE PATENT OFFICE.
During the year ending September 30, {
1866, eight thousand seven hundred and ]
sixteen patents for useful inventions and de- j
signs were ihsued, and at that date the bal- t
ance in the Treasury to the credit of the ]
Patent fuod was two hundred and twenty 2
eight thousand two hundred and ninety j
seven dollars. i
THE MISSISSIPPI LEVEF.8. |
As a subject upon which depends an im. i
mense amount of the production and com- I
merce of the country, I recommend to Con- i
grees such legislation as may be neoessary *
for the preservation of the levees of the <
Mississippi River. It is a matter of nation- '
al importance that early steps should be ta- I
ken Dot only to add to the efficiency of these I
barriers agaiDSt destructive inundations, but
for tbe removal of all obstructions to the
free aod safe navigation of that channel of
trade aod commerce.
DISTRICT or COLUMBIA.
The District of Columbia, under existing
laws, is not entitled to that representation
in the National Councils whioh, from our
earliest history, has been uniformly accord
ed to eaob Territory established from time
to time within our limits. It manifests peculiar
relations to Coogress. to whom tbe
Constitution has granted the power of exercising
exolusive legislation over tbe seat of
Government. Our fellow oitizens residing
in the District, whose interests are thus confided
to the special guardiaoship of Congress,
exceed in number the population of
several of our Teriitoties, and no just rea
son is perceived why a delegate of their
choice should not be admitted to a seat in
the House of Representatives. No mode
seems so appropriate aod effectual of enabling
them to make known their peculiar
condition and wants, and of securing the
local legislation adapted to them. I therefore
recommend the passage of a law authorizing
tbe electors of the District of Columbia
to choose a delegate, to be allowed
the same rights aod privileges as a delegate
_reprases???? a Territory. The increasing f
enterprise and rapid progress of improvement
in the District arc highly gratifying, ^
and I trust that the efforts of the maoicipal (
authorities to promote the prosperity of the
national metropolis will receive the effi ,
cientund generous co-operation of Congress. (
AGRICULTURE. t
The report of the Commissioner of Agri- 2
culture reviews the operations of his Depart- s
ment during the past year, and asks the aid t
of Congress in its efforts to encourage those 2
States which, scourged by war, are now ear- s
nestly engaged in the re organization of i
domestic industry. i
FOREIGN RELATIONS. 8
It is a subject of congratulation that no 8
foreign combinations against our domestic a
peace and safety, or our legitimate influence 0
among the nations, have been formed or at- c
tempted. While sentimeots of reconcilia- ^
tion, loyalty aod patriotism have increased 1
at home, a more just consideration of oar
natiooal character and rights have been
manifested by foreign nations. a
The entire success of the Atlantic Tele- j
graph between the coast of Ireland and the 1
Province of Newfoundland, is an achieve- 1
ment which has been justly celebrated in u
both hemispheres as tbe opening of an era r
in the progress of civilization. There is v
reasou to expect that equal success will attend,
and even greater results follow, the '
entcrprize for connecting the two Conti- f'
Dents through tbe Paoifio Ocean by the a
projected line of telegraph between Kam- 11
scbatka and the Kossian possessions in A- ^
merica. n

The Executive, warned of an attempt by -1
Spanish-American adventurers to induce A
the emigration of freedmen of the United t<
States to a foreign country, protested against t<
the project as one which, if consummated, I
would reduce them to a bondage even more tl
oppressive than that from which they have tl
just beeu relieved. Assurance has been re
seived from the Government of the State in
vrhioh the plan waa matured, that the pror
seedings will meet neither ita enconrage-;
ment nor approval. It ia a question worthy
Df your consideration, whether our lawi up*
an this subject are adequate to the prevention
or punishment of the orime thus meditated.
THE MEXICAN QUESTION.
In the month of April last, as Congress
la aware, a friendly arrangement waa made
between the Emperor of Frfnoe and the
President of the United States for the withIrawal
from Mexico of the French expeditionary
military forces. Thia withdrawal
aaa to be effeoted in three detaohmenta the
Srat of which, it waa understood, would
eave Mezioo in November, now put, the
leoond in Maroh next, and the third aod
ast in November, 1867. Immediately upon
;he completion of the evacuation, the Frenoh
Government was to aaaume the same atitude
of non-intervention, in regard to
Mexico, as held by the Government of the
[Jnited States. Repeated assurances have
)een given by the Emperor, since the agreement,
that he wonld oomplete the pronised
evaonation within the period meniooed,
or sooner.
It was reasonably ezpeoto d that the pro*
jeedings thus contemplated would produce
t crisis of great political interest in the ReDublio
of Mexico. The newly-appointed
ULioister of the United States, Mr. CampDell,
was therefore sent forward, on the 9th
lay of November last, to assame bis proper
"unotions as Minister Plenipotentiary of the
United States to that Republio. It was alio
thought expedient that.be should be at;
;ended in the vicinity of Mexioo, by the
Lieutenant General of the Army of the U.
States, with the view of obtaining suoh information
as might be important to detetnine
the coarse to be pursued by the Uni;ed
States in re-establishing and maintaiong
necessary and proper intercourse, with
;he Republic of Mexioo. Deeply intetested
n the causo of liberty and humanity, it
leemed an obvious duty on our part to extif}ise
wbatcver influence we possessed fog the
restoration and permanent establishment in
that oountry of a domestic and republioan
form of government
Such was the condition of affairs in regard
to Mexioo, when on the 22d of Novem
Dor last, official information was received
From Paris that -the Emperor of France had
)ome time before decided not to withdrawn
ietachment of his forces in the month of
November past, according to engagement,
)ut that this deoision was made with the
jurpose of withdrawing the whole of those
'orces in tbo ensuing spring. Of this de;ermination,
however, the United States had
lot received any notice or intimitation j and,
10 soon as the information was received by
he Government, care was taken to make
mown its dissent to the Emperor of France.
I cannot forego the hope that France will
eoonsider the subject, and adopt some resilution
in regard to the evacuation of
Mexico which will conform as nearly as
practicable with the existing engagement,
ind thus meet the jnst expectations of the
Qnited States. The papers relating to the
lubjeot will be laid before you. It is beieved
that, with the evaooatidn of Mexico
with the expeditionary forces, no sabjeot
For serious differences between France and
;he United States would remain. The expressions
of the Emperor and people of
Prance warrant a hope that the traditionary
Friendship between the two oonntries might
in that case be renewed and permanently
restored.
A olaim of a citizen of the United States
For indemnity for spoliations committed on
:he high seas by the Frenoh authorities, in
ho exeroise of a belligerent power against
Mexico, has been met by the Government
if France with a proposition to defer setlemeot
until a mutual convention fdf the
idjustment of all ol&ims of oitizeos and
mbjects of both countries, arising oat of
he recent wars on this Continent, shall be
igreed upon by the two countries. The
mggestion is not deemed unreasonable, bat
t belongs to Oongrcr" to direot the manner
n which claims for indemnity by foreigners
is well as by citizens of the United States,
arising oat of the late civil war, shall be
idjadicated and determined. I have no
loabt that thesubjeotof allsuoh claims will
ngage yoar attention at a convenient and
iroper time.
'HE "ALABAMA" CLAIMS AGAINST GREAT
BRITAIN.
It is a matter of regret that no considerble
advanoe has been made towards an adastment
of the difference between the Unied
States and Great Britain, arising oat of
he depredations upon oar national commerce
and otber trespasses committed doing
oar civil war by British subjects, in
iolation of international law and treaty obgations.
The delay, however, may be beeved
to have resulted, in no small degree,
rom the domestic situation of Great Britin.
An entire change of ministry occurred
m that coantry daring the last session fo
Parliament. The attention of the new
riuistrj.was called to the subjeotat an earj
day, and there is some reason to expect
hat it will now be considered in a becoming
nd friendly spirit. The importance of an
arly disposition of the question cannot be
xaggerated. Whatever might be the wishis
of the two Governments, it is manifest
hat good will and friendship between the
wo countries cannot be established until a
