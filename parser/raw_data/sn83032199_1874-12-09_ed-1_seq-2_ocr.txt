: We learn from a Republican nows
nper of Calais, Maine, that a case has
arisen there which is likely to try the
tndeieiidenco of our new PoHtiiiaster
Goneral. It is one of tho numerous
instances of corrupt burguin ami sale
of public offices by members of Con
gress and their political agents wliich
havo rendered the present Administra
tion so disreputably notorious.
Here is a post office worth some f 2,
000 a year, and, liko all such offices,
it is substantially in the gill of tho
member of Congress who represents
the district. The present occupant of
tins post onice, -Mr. lltvight 11. liur
nard, seems to have held it lor some time.
It now turns out that he purchased his
Inst appointment from Mr, William T.
Kinu, ono of Representative Hale's
active lieutenants, lor the sum of $3U0,
ensh down, and un annuity of fltOO a
year to this thrifty agent's brother-iu-utw
; and it is alleged that these terms
havo been i'ultllled, ,
A new appointment is now about to
lie inaile, and It is stated that Jung,
this (500 man, is to receive tho office
outrighton Mr. Hide's recommendation.
This has brought to light tho foregoing
facts, to which it seems Mr. Jewell's
attention is now called, with a viow of
ascertaining whether he countenances
such scandalous irallickiiig in puouc
offices for political and personal pur
poses. -,(
The transaction is one of a' doss
which has prevaded and still prevades
every branch of tha public service
throughout the country, of every de
gree of magnitude, till tho whole civil
service is honey -combed with rascality
and corruiition. It la only now and
then that the facts of individual cases
sea the light, lending a fcrt of dark
lantern. view of what is still behind the
scones. 1 f tho veil could bo lifted, if
want is hidden could bo fully exposed,
we should not bavo to wait long for
suob a political revolution as this coun
try or any other hat hardly over ex
perienced. . We cannot permit ourselves to have
any doubt alsnit Mr. Jowell's. action
in the present case. But wo bono tho
exiosuro will operate in other roses
where the proot is not so plain. e
rocollcet, for instance, that Mr. Halo,
under Mr. Blaine's tuition, endeavored
to take the lead in condemning tho
Credit Mobilier and Salary Grills these
two statesmen having luckily kept out
of these scrapes. . J)ut notwithstanding
this indignant virtue, hero seems to lie
a batch of Mr. Rule's own private
dirty linen. We recall the fact also
that Mr. Hale was charged with mak
ing the most corrupt canvass over
known in Maine at a time which near
lv coincides with the leadino' fiicin now
divulged in regard to tho Calais Post
Office. The charges made would seem
to warrant still further investigation,
and we adviso the C'dnn Timet, the
Republican journal from which wo de

It is said that whiletbe patriot aires
were pledging Urea ard aatired honor
lo treedoma cause, in Independence
nun, a conclave nt Htout men with
bravo hearts, waited is Independence
Square, tbe arrival of "Liberty's Mes
senger, who all aglow with tho ardor
of tho hour, came forth, and to tho
applauding patriot crowd read tho
groat 'chart, ore yet the names were
dry." It is also said that this square,
made sacred by ieh scones, is soon
to have u National Monument erected
in the centre of it, contnioinorative of
tho thirteen original Slates, and, prob-
hlily, reprnsentittiro of all tho, Hiatus
in the li moil.' A number or our most
prominent gentlemen, with George W.
Child, James U Clarhnrn, A. K. Bo
ne, John Welsh, Ai J. Jmixol, J. (iil
liiigbam Fell, John Gibson, and others,
have applied for an Act incorporating
tho National Monumental Association,
tbe object being to erect an appropri
ate monument m Idepondenco Square;
tho money to be raised by one dollar
contributions from every man, woman
aud child in thu nation, who desires to
so contribute ; the articles of Incorpo
ration limiting the subscription to that
sum. ' I expect to see this monument
unveiled July 4th, 1870. President
Grant has paid his dollar, and Vice
President Wilson Ins dono the same.

' Tho Interest iu the Centonuiul is
steadily on tho increase, all sections of
tbo country uniting in most friendly
rivalry to do their part towards muk-
ingthu International Kxhibition of
1870, a porfect sgvt-iSf. During the
past few days meetings have been held
in Bridireton. Now Jersey. Norwich.
Conn., and others are arranged to come
ntr at 1'itlsburgh and Chester, in this
State, Trenton, N. J., Boston and New
York. Popular feeling has seldom
displayed itself moro earnestly than
in thu town of Bridgeton, where over
six thousand nooule withered Uiirether
to listen to the eloquent addresses of
tiovornor t'arker and 1 homas 11. Dud
ley, of Now Jersey, and Gov. Bigler,
of the Centennial Committee. The
patriotic fervor shone forth as thu
speakers touched upon tho manly
deeds . of our forefathers, through
whoso exertions we are now in a fit
position to celebrate the great anni
versary. This interest, I am happy to
state, is resulting iu most autialuotory
subscriptions, Bridgeton alone sending
in $3,000 as her quota to tha Centen
nial fund. As it may occur to many
of my readers, that it would be well
to orgnmxo some means ot raising
funds lo aid thu Centennial, I would
suggest thu "Tea Party" as u capital
plan, and in tho hands of tho ladies,
can ho made a gittat success, all funds
so raised to be invested ui Centennial
Stock, tho proceeds of which, when
received, cau bo divided aiming differ
ent charities in the city or town, thus
doing good in said direction. The
Centennial Medals are now ready and
ooinji rapidly disposed of. J ho de
sign is vory satisfactory, and tbe larg
er modal is a very fine specimon of
art. i base medals are sent out by tho
Hurcau of Revenue, at tho following
ririces, by mail : Largo gilt, f 5 ; large
ironxo, i'i ; small silver, $3. Letters
addressed to the Bureau of Revenue
always receive imincdiato attention.

that "Canada can have all the space
sho may require." t
, Norwich, Conn., in order not to bo
behind Canada, has written to Gov.
Bigler to conio "down Kast" and start
tho Centennial bull rolling in that
Statu, and Gov. Bigler has gone there,
aud on Wednesdays night lost gave the
people of that thriving, and industrious
uiamilacttinng place, such a plain state
ment of facts, and so clearly sot forth
their duty to the matter, that I ap
prehend that from this time forth the
most active exertions will be mado by
the manufacturers upon tho banks of
lite Connecticut, the Jlousatonic, and
the Thames, to got up an exhibit of
machinery that will excel that placed
upon exhibition by tbe manufacturers
upon the Thames, in England, or
which comes from Mancbeeter, Liver

JAY COOKB CO. 1 !'
In my lottor of June 27th iastl said
that tho 7 per cent, dividend declared
by tho trustee in the bankruptcy cose
of Jay Conko ic Co. would bo paid
hereafter ; that is, it will bo paid here
iu Philadelphia, after many legal ques
tions have boon disposed of. It has
not yet been puid, and at the meeting
of creditors, held December 1st, that
dividend was revoked, i
A Report of 00 pages, pamphlet
form, was submitted at this meeting,
which comproHsed, simply shows that
the indebtedness of the firm is 110,
804,84a The available assets, includ
ing cash in hand, may bo set down at
half a million dollars. Tho claims
against individual members of tile firm
amount to 2,KtNI,UIHI, which, niuler the
bankrupt act the individual assets
must be applied to tho payment of the
partnership debts. Tbo cash in hand
that ran bo applied to a payment of
dividend to general creditors, amounts
to f -19 1,9 15.04, and fbr tho payment of
individual debts to t ho members ot tho
Arm, is 1231,018.05. Just when a
dividend will bo paid is a conundrum I
give np, and yet It is duo to Jay Coolto
to say that he is not responsible at all
for this delay. Kvcrything long ago
passed trom his hands to the 1 rastov s.
Col. John W. Forney huving rovokod

Santoe t Co. and City Treasurer

more reliable or more cajieble business

eral, after having been kicked out of
the iiadical Senate of the United States,
with hi character in a "landeau,"
drawn by bono and driven by ser
vants bought out ol the people s money,
feels his pitiable plight '
In order that there may be some
creature in human form as "honnrublo"
as himself, he has in bis employ what
ho call Government "detectives."
They "are all hnnontblo business men.'
Ho uses them for the honorable hns!
ncss a spier) and informers in the
South, to find out the citixens who are
white Democrat, and then hns thorn
arrested, handcuffed, dragged hundreds
of miles from their homes, beaten, mal
treated, and oppressed because they
are Democrats ana whito men.
Two of those fellows have lately
made a rejiort of their high and honor
able mission to the South. The lies
thoito fellows tell in their report are
Worthy of the greatest prniso for their
sublime audacity.
Tbe Radical negro party In Congress
should at once pass a hill to pay them
for extra services, owing to tbo great
benefits that have resulted at the late
dot-lions in th South and North from
their efforts to manufacture "outrage"
to fire the .northern heart. . n
Bon Butler and his gang nf Congress
men would soon "sot up a ring" to pass
this bill if those fellows and their chief'
Williams, would make tho considera
tion largo enough "to pay."
We lsk with deep interest at the
measure to be advocated this Congress
