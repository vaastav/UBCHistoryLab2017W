SFGULATIMG IHZ JDDICIA.KY.
Tho bill introduced by lit. Sumner, at
the opening of Cemgres*. to abolish the ap
pellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
in hnfmif rorpu* cases was referred to the
Judiciary Committee, who reported a sub
stitute, which we published yesterday morn
ing. Mr. Sumner’h bill was evidently aimed'
to restore the Terror case to the custody of
the military tribunal, arid to prevent any
interference with tho action of that tribunal
by Chief JiMice Chase or tbe Supremo
t\,nrt. Axiujurnt’s reflection must bare
suflu-f.l to sjitisfy the Judiciary Committee
that Mr. Sumners bill would hare
exactly the effect from that in
tendfd. Admitting, what is very doubtful,
that an r.ct «.f Congress pu*»od now could 1
have n rvlroaclive cticcl on tho Supremo i
Court** jurisdiction alter that has been onco |
acquired, end the case lawfully heard and |
submitted, still to abolish tho appelUto
jurisdiction ol tho Supreme Court, hi a case
urigit&lly begun before Chief JusticaChasC,
would merely erd the appeal, and loavo him
to decide it as if no appeidhad been brought
or were possible. The constitution would
still declare that ** the privilege of tho writ
of h' corpus shall not be suspended,"
snd would still protect every Judge, and
isj-f ciolly Chief Justice Chase, before whom
the case already is, in issuing the writ and
iu adjudging all questions that properly
arise under it, and no others are now be
fore the Supreme Court. It would have
been a mortifying illustration cf Iba haste
with which Mr. Sumner proposes legisla
tion, had Congress at his instance legislated
the Verger case bach into the hands of the
dreaded Chief Justice, after so much pains
have been taken to get it out of bis exclu
sive custody into that of the Supremo Court.
The bill reported by the Judiciary Commit
tee eit-TC’i'l* tbo appellate jurisdiction of
tbe Supreme Court in habeas corpus cases ;
prohibits that Court from entertaining ju
risdiction of any case, civil or criminal,
growing out of tbs execution of the Bacon
struction acta is Virginia, Mxssiasippi, or
TeiEF. and declares that those acta u are
political in their character, the propriety or
validity of which so judicial tribunal is
competent to question." Congress ha«,
undoubtedly, the * power, under
Section 2, Article 8, * of the
conrtitntion, to make all conceivable ** ex
ceptions" to and “ regulations " of tho appel
late jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
Exactly what is meant by ■‘suspending tbo
appellate jurisdiction of tbsSspreme
it would be difficult to pay. If it suspends
the npjHud c-eo of Verger, now before tho
Supreme Oourt, so as to keep it there with
out fiction, then such fins pension is an ac
knuwlt’dgmcsl and continuance of tho
jurisdiction. If it terminates tho appellate
jnri-'diction of the Supremo Court, then
the appeal only is ended, and the
case reverb* to Chief Justice j
Chase, as Circuit Judge, precisely as
under the operation of Sir. Sumner’s bill. ;
In the latter easo nothing is accomplished- I
in tbs former only delay.
As to the power uf Congress to enjoin or |
“prohibit tbe Supreme Coart from outer- |
taming jurisdiction of any case growing out
of the execution of said (reconstruction) 1
acts,” if that is intended to apply
to cases arising after tbe passage
of the act, it is .valid aa
a law, but cannot, we think, apply to the
Verger case, however much we may desire
to see that villain hanged. If it is intended
as an injunction on the Supreme Court to
restrain further action in tbe Verger cose,
it is not in the nature of legislation, and wo
doubt whether Congress baa any more
power to enjoin the Supreme Court than
the Supreme Court has to enjoin Congress.
The uniform language of our constitutional
lawyers and statesmen has been that each of
the three department* of the govern
ment has tho exclusive power to
corn-true the constitution and the
laws for itself. Prom Madison
and Jefferson to Webster, Clay, and Lin
coln, there has been no divergence on that
point. Congress may declare anew, in this
bill, that the power to admit a State is a
political power, which no Court can ques
tion. Such a declaration in no way mili
tab s egainst the fact that the right to issue
a writ of Inlm* corpus is a judicial
jxiwcr, which Congress can only
interfere with by a law bus*
pending tho writ when in cases
of re belli' n and invasion tbo public safety
may require it. They passed such a law,
bat tulUoiircd the president by proolatna*
lion to restore it. Xho last President did
restore it, in accordance with the law of
Congress, if not, perhaps, with their wish.
The adjudication of such a case has come
before Chief Justice Chase, and been duly
BppcnJcd to the Supremo Court. Theirs is
the responsibility. Theirs only. We desire
ns ardently os uny that Verger shall be
barged for hm foul assassination. Wo be
lieve his murder of a Union officer, in the
ext rci&e of bis duty, in a State under mili
tary government, is a ease Arising in the
lend forces of the United States in which a
military tribunal has just as complete juris
diction as a like tribunal bod of
tho tiK&ffiins of President Lincoln.
If tho Supreme Court of tho United
SUtoR wl<di to decide otherwise, lot 1
them explode their decuion. Tbo country
can stand it, whatever it bo. If they dc*
cide the entire Reconstruction actsuneonsti
tuliuna), that dots nut make them so.
Neither tho Executive nor Congress are
boned by their dictum. The President
will suU use the army and navy to enforce
the laws u* Congress passes them. The
Supreme Court may use Its Marshals and
the coiuit'itus to enforce tho laws
as it construes them. This is all
there Is of it when the power of the Sa
pn me Court has run the length of its rope.
It is fur better it should do so than that
Congress should i«uc special injunctions to
govern the action of an independent branch
of the government in the performance of
duties solely its own.
THE “ DEBTOR CLASS,”
Thor* arc many excellent bat unreflecting
jv rsune in various parts of the country
who urge as an objection to the resump
tion of specie payments, the loss It will
inflict upon the “ debtor class." They talk
and write elaborately upon the subject,
nwuming that the American people are di
vided into two distinct and opposing
“creditors" and “debtors."
There cannot bo a debtor without a cred
itor, end the tiygn vrho belongs exclusively
to one class is a rare exception to
tL« general rule. The man who
bojK and sells goods on credit
is necessarily both debtor and creditor.
The man who employs labor by the week,
or month, belongs to the-debtor class, and
Lis laborers am his creditors; in the mean
time, these latorczs are also debtors to the
grocf-r, and batcher, and baker, who, in
torn, are creditors of the laborers, and
debtors to their wholesale merchants. There
is scarcely a manufactory which does not
owe to its laborers, or to a bank, or to some
one, the full value of all the debts doe to it
for its fabrics. Meet contractors are, in
like manner, debtors for the xneaua to pros
ecute their wort', and are, of coarse, credi
tors to the amount that is due them for
work performed. When one J obis closed up,
another ore is taken in the same way. thus
renewing, perpetually, the double relation
cf creditor and debtor in the same persons.
There is scarcely anybody engaged in
trade, or labor, or production, who is not
necessarily both debtor and creditor. The
only class of persons who are debtors, and
not at the same time creditors, are those
commonly known and described as “ dead
beats," and to these it is a matter of total
indifference whether specie payments be re
trained or sot. These last-named persons
are the only ones who cm be correctly de
scribed ns a “ debtor dars** in distinction
from the rest of the people.
Eveiy farmer is both creditor and debtor:
creditor.to the amount that la due to him,
or that be has invested in land, crops, or
stock on hand ; against this ho is debtor for
all be owes, and for all ho has to bny for
the wants of his family, or for hi* form.
Every, other man is in lib* wimnur creditor
for all that be baa invested in business, and
debtor for all that he may owe or baa to
bny. Aa in the caso of each man
the excess of Iris Investments, in whatever
form, over his indebtedness, of whatever
kind,' is'the sum of his wealth; so, the
excess of the assets of the country ow the
of the indebtedness'* represents the
< sggregnlo wealth. The indebtedness, aa
1 oumparwT with the means of is
'lnflirig. Except, as we hero haYo said,
those who are] already bankrupt,—whose
credits do no'oqttal their debts, —there Is
no portion 3 ‘of the people who can
be classed as “debtors," as distinguished
fromT 'creditors,"' 1 and, therefore, there
cannot be any separate debtor class to be
ruined and desolated by a return to specie
. .payments,- In case of resumption, the
, .debtor whose note for §IOO falls due sixty
days hence will have to pay its amount in a
Eomawhst bolter currency. 11 he have the
money now, that faxoney will appreciate in
■ bis hands paripiittu with the voice of his
uuto : if he do not Lavo the money, but
has arranged to receive it in Umo to pay his
‘ note, bo will receive it with its increased
value. The mao who owes a mortgigo of
910,000, payable ton years' hence, has
.other the money (o meet it or depends
upon receiving it in the interval. In either
1 case his means (other things being equal)
will appreciate in tho same proportion as
1 bis indebtedness. If ho have not the
money, and fails to acquire it before the
oiurtguge fulls due, his lui'iforttmo will not
bo increased by tbe resumption of specie
payments; nor would it havo been pre
vented if tho currency had cantinnod to
be dcprcciut cd.
FRANCE.
The course of the irreconcilable enemies
of the Emperor Napoleon during tbo lan
few wreks is not calculated to recommend
ihcm to the confidence of the lover* of lib.
ertj anywhere. The journals they edit
burn themed with tbo Tiled personal
ithuso of (ho chief of tbo State,
«ncb as—in tbo onioion of tbc
moderate and liberal Loudon Sp/rtat/r—
--“no English statesman would indulge for a
tuoiucnt such as ** moat inevitably.'
writes to us nn experienced American edi-
tor, now in Paris, load to an imperial re
action.” Few of these sheet*—they arc in
no just sense newspapers—reach lira
country, but the extracts we have scon and
the specimens given in our correspondence
fully be..r out these statements. Tho men
who give the tone to the J! tppd, the Revert ,
und tho rest, elected Bochefort, who pro.
xmtod the double claim to tbetr suffrages
t-f an exile and of the author of tho
grufs assaults on Napoleon. Tho moderate
Opposition, which had chosen' men like
Thiers and Jules Favre, last spring, hirdJy
•Lowed itself at tho polls. The animating
principle of tho successful party was
hatred to the Emperor. Underneath this
there may be, as English writers suggest*
“ a solid basis of Socialism,” t, v., a dispo.
hition to carry out tho "Bed”creed by re
distributing property, a successful attempt
to do which might lead to the renewal of
t-cenes such as disgraced the revolution of
17tW. If there be any better principles nn.
dr-riving tbo movement of tho "Irrecon
cilableb” they are difficult to discover. They
scout at parliamentary-government; they
evince so faculty for its conduct; they have
not a statesman in their ranks. They cry,
‘‘Down with the Empire,” but they prom
ise France nothing to toko its place. They
are doing their best to rebuild tbo position
of the Emperor in public opinion, and to
lead prudent .men,—whatever criticisms
they may make cn his po licy,—to rely upon
the promise In his speech that he will main
tain order rather than to trust to his per
sonal enemies to carry into practice what
they call liberty.
The passage in Napoleon's speech to the
(■fleet that be‘will answer for order, and
that it is fer the people to show that they
ore fit for liberty, is the key to the present
situation. It was because would-be roro
lutiunists knew that ha had the will and.
the power to enforce order that they were'
quiet on tho days advertised for insurree
iicn, on the 26th of October, the 29th of
November, and the 2d and 3d of Decem
ber. Having shown in tho press and in
tbo public reunions that liberty with them
; meant license, they have shown & mm3*r
disposition in the Legislative Body.
Basptii'* proposal to impeach the Minis
ters, and Bochefort's demand that tho
Chambers should bo “protected” by the
National Guard, arc what we call in this
country “ pieces of buncombe,” addrea»od
to the populace of Paris, their masters.
Xbc h( pc of Franco is in the party which
seeks to reconcile real liberty with order
under the Empire, believing the Empire to
i.-e, with nil Its faults, preferable to on un-
knewn future, and trusting to obtain from
it the establishment of political rights upon
a secure basis and with sufficient.guarau
tees. Men, n year ago among tho mosl
severe critics of “personal government,”
are in its ranks. Should it bo able to form
a Ministry, as the telegraph reports to be
probable, the reforms promised in Napo
leon’s speech may bs foitlifolly carried out,
und the desire of Franco to govern herself
satisfied without a revolution, the end of
which no man oan foresee.
THE CREDIT BTSTRH.
A more than ordinarily persistent effort
bos bean mode, during tbe put two or
tines months, by country denier*, to gain
longer credits from our wholesale mer
chants. Tears ago the six and twelve
months’ note was the rule ; the date of
payment was afterwards cat down to three,
and aitbln two yean past the best rule has
been thirty days. The pressure is now in
favor ol three to six months’ paper.
The gnatcr security of the cash system
has long ego been demonstrated, and the
experience cf traders ought also, by this
time, to bare satisfied them that it is so
much tbe cheapest that they cannot afford
to go back to the bid plan. When there*
taller buj son credit, the wholesale dealer
must buy on credit, too ; nod Ibis double
deterring of payment-is equivalent to an
addition cf 10 per cent to the cost of the
goods. Tho retailer gives credit, too, in
Rnch coses, and often finds himself enable
to collect when bla own bills fall duo. Bat
worse than this inconvenience is tho post*
tire loss of custom which the credit system
entails. The nan who has mn np a bill of
fifty tbllara at ft stare, and has ten dollars
which he wishes to expend on other goods,
often avoids the store “where he bos an
account,*' and carries his ready cash else
where. Tho consequence i», that tbe man
who sells for ready money only is doing a
good business, while Ins more accommo
dating neighbor Is poring over bis ledger,
and waiting vainly for customers and cash.
Tbe ready-money plan is nt once the best
and tho cheapest for all concerned, and no
man who expects to pay would ever oak for
credit did be not flatter himself that the
seller will make him an exception to (be
rule. This is, however, impossible. Tbo
man who trusts one will trust another, and
it is only by demanding 10 per cent more
for the same quality of goods that he con
hope to compote with his ready-money
neighbor. If honest buyers understood
this there would bo less asking for credit;
and if stlltra were fully awake to thur own
interests they would never grant tho re*
quest.
It is a somewhat curious circumstance
that, in the organization of tho committees
of the Board of Supervisors, tho city of
Chicago, which has five-sixths of tho voting
population of tbe county, and pays more than
five-sixths of tho taxes, has only onc~t\ir-
Uadh of the chairmanships. It is also
noticeable that, on all the committees which
have the handling of money, the city of
Chicago is in a minority. If tho city had
tbe representation in the Board of Super
visors to which she is entitled, by virtue of
her numbers and her contributions to the
County Treasury, such a disgraceful, one
sided arrangement could never have existed.
But, instead of having fivo-alxtha of tho
membership, as she ought, the city has less
than oue-half. This is “minority repre
sentation ” with a vengeance.
It has been somewhat the fashion, among
those who traffic in county polities, to extol
tbe virtue of our country cousins; and to
hold it ep os a wise maxim in social science
that if one-eixth of the Ux-payera are al
lowed to govern five-sixths, and to tax them
freely, the net result will be not only the
(treat pecuniary advantage of the five-sixths,
but the great moral advancement ol the
one-sixth. We take the liberty to doubt
l*oth propositions. At all events, so long
as it is the theory of our government that
taxation and representation shall go
together, and that tbe majority shall
govern, we shall insist that the basts of onr
present county government is unjust and
unrepnMican. We trust that tbe Constitu-
tionol Convention will cure this inequality,
and icstcro io the tax-paycri of Chicago
some of their inalienable rights.

lessened.
1: may. however, be w*u doubted whether tne
nr ore abundant harvest of this year; the higher
prices received lor othvr crops min whett, and
the greater cheapness cr most of tbe merchandise

sate to any thrifty <onset for tbe abnaaage in the

perilous folly of relying upon a stsgle crop, and
the necessity of a more diversified agricultural

Since Uie recent mewl* between «w Hendricks

and BepobUean Sate ooarenoons. ThrDemoo

' Saturday !*«*, passed a resolution in favor of anch
postponement. . Several Influential Democratic
1 papers, including the New Albany Lodytr, are out_
favoring the woe policy. The chances are, how*
-ever, that it wUlnotbe done, as the candidates
are becoming noznoroos and will be olamoroas by
the tune the convention tneeca on tbe Bth of Jana*

and a majoiUy of mem are generally feeling pret

of benzine they are compelled to imbibe, in order
' to satiety the nnmerona candidates of their good
feelmg for them, and will be as bold as lions and
anxious to assnme tbe responsibility of making a
platform and ticket; ao the Indications are tbat
these mu be no postponement of either the
Democratic or Republican Convention, and that
each will be held at the time indicated by their
respective Bute Central Committees.
The Pendleton men bate been completely oat*
generated by tbe Hendricks men, and are qilce

their minds to offer no farther resistance. Tbe

Talbott, a leading Democratic politician, nod for*
acrly Chairman of tbe Democratic State Cestral
Committee of till Stare. Sicca then the Sentinel
baa contained several bitter amnlta upon mat
gentleman, la which it acctuea Urn of baring been
a fat o-dealer at one period, and not suddenly neb
bj cheating la tbe same. It also Baft, that while
Mr. Taloott was a member of tbe Bo*rd of Direc
tor* of the Indianapolis insurance Company, be
made a preposition to tbe officers ofabat Institu
tion to make a false statement of Ita condition, in
order that be might form a M ring " aad bay up ita
stock at a reduced figure. Tbli base proposition
iraa rpurced, and Mr. Talbott was forced to
lealgn bta poilUon on tbe board. It alio
recalls Mr. Talbott's ose of tbe School Food, for
gold gambiug operations while tbe same was un
der bis control as President of me Sinking Fund,*
and divers other matters not creditable to that
gentleman. Mr. Talbott grins and bears It alt
without rcplj, hoping that tbe Sentinel will soon
ceaee rta attacks. Mr. Talbott na« sued tbe Jour*
nat lor libel lor refemng to bis gold gambling op
eration?, which bad been made tbe sstyect of
Legislative investigation. Tbe Journal proposes
to make good us aocma'ioa, and dares Hr.
Talbott to urge tie case on to trial. Bat as tbe
.frurnsi's accusations against Ur. T. are not one*
half es personal or libellous as tbe Sentinel's
articles, It seems a little strange that Mr. T. does
not commence a suit against that paper.

TOdle the lileudn ot Messrs Pecdleum and Hen
dricks are growlcg more bitterly hostile to each
other, and coir bid fair to prevent the lutore po
litical preferment of either. Urn Hoa. Graham K.
Pilch is quietly residing at the interior city of Lo
gotsport, In thu State, stewing the situation,
with an eye to the lutore. He is the personal
fjletd of both Pendleton and Hendricks, aid en
joys the confidence acd respect of the enure De
mocracy of the State. He wss a bluer Lecompton
DtnfocraT, and opposed tha elecuon of Senator
Douglas to toe Presidency in I 960; but, soon after
the aor broke out, he offered hu services to the
government, and raised the Porty-iixlh Indiana
Volunteers, and entered the army, when he re
named for two years. He was an excellent offl
ccf, and was urged strongly for promotion by
Speaker Colfax, but the President refused to pro
mote him, whereupon he resigned his commission'
giving as a reason that his pay as Colonel would
nottuppon his family. Since that time he has
acted with the Democratic party, but has taken no
active pan to politics, save to attend Ita conven
tions, and mate an occasional speech daring the
heat oi a campaign, lie ta a mao of marked dig
nity and ability, the acknowledged peer of any
ot the leading Democrats of the country, and
a far-setieg politician. Ha Is believed
to be quietly arranging the wires acd setting op
thinga, to be to a position to be brought forward
as a compromise candidate by the West at the
next National Democratic Convention, In case the
fi lei ds of Hendricks acd Pendleton fail to agree,
which is altogether likely. This little arrangement
la now being quietly worked up and whispered
around among the few friends that it will do to
entrust with the secret, and It may be that the
some tactics which culminated la the nomination
of dames K. Polk aid Franklin Pierce, will be
re-enacted in 1972, with Graham JT. Fuch as Us
hero. Mr. Voothees, and others equally promt
sect, are sold to be In active sympathy with

This genlletLanwa*, for eighteen years, amcm

tra of the Democratic part;. Hla position during
the war «u somewhat anomalous. He desired
to act with the War Democracy, bat did not aeem
to poms* the courage to throwoff the part; yoke.
By this cturse both wings of the pan; lost faith
la him, and ware bit retirement from the beach,
be baa been quietly engsged in the practice of bia
proles* ion in this clly—scemiogly taking no other
interest in politics than to make an occasional
Democra'ic speech, which bare not been goner*

the paat winter be made a lengthy argu
ment before the Supreme Court on a
question Involving the constitutionality of
acts ptared by the Legislature under the same
ctcumstoucca and by the aame means as was the
Fiiteentb amendment to the Constitution of the
Veiled States. It was an able argument, and fell
like a bombshell In the ranks of the Democracy.

leiclng democratic papers lor a renomleauon to

a card dt cutting the use of hla name, and entirely

Republican forty or acted with that party np to last
winter, having been elected to the State Senate
from Lavmcc and Monroe Counties. Bo; bo

To the Editor of The Chicago Tribune :
In this morning's Issue of your paper you repub
lish, from the New York Tim* ot the Sd inst., an
article about Utah, setting forth that 44 the Mar
mots *rt told to be preparing (or a fight,’* etc-.
The spirit ol the article all through la fight, and,
of course, sensational' In these doll timaa. The
witter had very little with which to work op hu
atucie, a&d, aa usual la such cases, waa forced to
make an much aa possible out of the little that he
had got. And what has he got; Fre moos little.
The salient points of the whole of It amount to
the magnificent number of two: tbe first a mili
tary camp tn Utah; the second a Mormon
Elder's sermon in Brooklyn. From
these, “oil the world and tbe rest
oi mankind ” are warmed op with the prospect or
a shindy. Now, Mr. Editor, I am trem Utah,
probably tne latest Mormon Importation tram that
elevated region, licit there Jim a week ago, and,
itaiika toineinagnlCceat Union Pacisc osd Cot
csgo A Northwestern ftanreads, arrived here rare,
sound, and fail of kmdneaa to everybody that de
serves it. This letter yoo will, therefore, understand
t» not to pitch in enact to tbs Tanuwa or Time*.
I aprredate both too much to do so,
and novat. 1 comprehend, too, the terri
ble labor that the fraternity nave to perform
cow and again. In something out of noth
ing—aa so nit body fa aatd to have dona in Iwhirl
ing Into life and motion this Util* worm of oars.
1 admire the profession, and, thus, pleoae accept
ft e expression of my onecilon. But TroasLlhls
I am forced to say that the s -ory of the Mormons
preparing for hostilities with Unde Bamnrl is a to,
andthe Oder, whoever ho la, mat and the Mor
noaawere “ready to take up anna and shed
blood. U neeeaaary,’’ was ? DO " nt
blocktesd. who ottered. U he ever spot* any
thing of ibe sort that la reported, the nonsense of
*o* teat la. 1 have seen nothing in
the tatxrn dating the last ten dsys to tbe eontn-
1 am atm a Moreton.
Hut te that aa » may, I am a resident of Ciaa.
M.l as roch. I am gotog to utttt* troth when and
whue'it pleases me, and am going to say it la my
own wayf too; and wm aak no favors or pennls
piod ot any body hereafter, he&ceiorth and for*
first thing to be aatd Is, that hostilities with
the united fiWes wm never be sought by the
Mensoo*. Tuty have been badgered, taunted,
aid abused tUI hide patience waa left: and, It has
seemed at limes, that U would have been
a luxury to kick tone acafiawags out of the
T*mtoiy; but these were portly personal affairs.
I remember once a Federal officer threatening to
bring terrible tioahieupoa Utah because “ mine
host" ol the Globe said something show choking
him U he did not pay a champagne-oyster sapper
that he had given tea dexen lawyers and other
loikv Mme boat did not we Samuel m tbe tnnsio
tjon. Of he didn’t. Bat that is seme'
years ego. These were the days when Buchanan
and other good men before him had to get rid of
importunate han>era*oo by seeding them to the
Territories. We said tunny tniajs in these times,
became we were annoyed, and righteously, too—
but alas! these halcyon days ot the
monststna are peat andgooe/and to'oblige any
body we can sever recall then and get * fight
to please anybody. Sven if the great Gsptain of
the age wanted to oaoe snore dot the straps and

not accommodate tom with tbe opportunity.
