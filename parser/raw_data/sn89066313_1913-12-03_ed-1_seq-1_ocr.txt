Another Trial for Student Charged
With Illegal Voting.
Errol L. Joyce, a student in the
School of Law, will be on trial in the
Callawa Circuit court in Fulton, next
Tuesda on a charge of illegal vot
ing. This case has been in dourt Since
last June, following the indictment of
nine university men on charges of il
legal voting A change of enue was
asked to the Callaway County court
because of the prejudice that might be
allowed to enter in the case here.
The case against Earl Morgan, one
of the nine indicted, was dropped by
the state. H. S. Anderson and M. X.
Beeler were acquitted.
The jury could not agree in Mr.
Joyce's case, and the case was brought
sjrer until this term of court. Mr.
Joyce's defense was that he voted il
legally through ignorance, and the
state argued that ignorance did not ex
cuse him.
The state has subpoenaed about a
dozen young men. Prosecuting Attor
ney Emmet C Anderson does not state
the nature of the state's case against
Mr. Joyce, nor does the defense an
nounce any plans in their case. Many
of the witnesses for Mr. Joyce will be
f?om Brookfield, his home.
H found guilty, Mr. Joyce may be
punished by the minimum, a fine of $50
r by the maximum, five years in the
state penitentiary. He would be dis
franchised with either sentence. For
toe state Mr. Anderson will be assist
ed by X. t. Cave, prosecuting attorney
of Callaway county. Chas. M. Hay, of
Fulton, and Frank G. Harris, of Co
lumbia represent Joyce.

CITY TO BU! SEWER
FROM
SHO
FACTORY
Will' Pay 33,278.25, Price
Asked, in Three Years
Payments.
NEW HEALTH BOARD
Mayor Moore Announces
Appointment of All But
Two Members.
The City Council decided last night
to buy the private sewer belonging to
the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company.
The sewer was built in 1907. Since
that time four district sewers of the
city have been joined to it.
A committee of the Council reported
that, while no legal obligation proba
bly rested on the city to buy the sewer,
the city was certainly morally bound
to do so. The city attorney filed an
opinion that the council had the power
to buy a private sewer and pay for
it out of the general revenue, pro
vided it did not incur debts to exceed
the revenue of that year.
Will Pay in Three Years.
An ordinance was passed to pay
?278.25 of the $3,278.25 asked by the
sewer by the shoe company. The com
mittee reported that the amount was a
fair price. The first payment is an
earnest to the Hamilton-Brown Shoe
Company that the council expects to
pay the entire amount in three years.
The present council can take no action
that will be binding on the succeeding
councils. It is expected that they will
follow the plan of the present council.
A copy of the report and ordinance
was ordered sent to the shoe company.
With the report concerning the
sewe the committee also recommend
ed that the city officials and council
adopt a fiscal year and a budget. This
plan will systemize the city's finances.
City ,Water Resen oir Begun.
A statement signed by X. D. Evans
and A.JD. Hawkins was read saying
"that -thJeytiad again. visited -the- city
reservoir and what they had thought
was manure on the banks was found on
inspection to be old asbestos packing.
Mayor W. P. Moore then announced
the appointment of Dr. W. R. Shaefer,
Dr: Wi A.. Xorris and Dr. A. W. Kamp
scluaidt'to the-"Board of Health. He
said that the other two members
would be selected soon.
An ordinance was-passed to pay the
rent on the? building just-north of the
Athens Hpter -on Xinth street. The
free dispensary will be placed there.
The Charity Organization Society has
taken charge of this work in the place
of the Civic League.
Doctors and Dentists to Help.
Doctors and Dentists of the city will
give their time free. The medicines
will be paid for out of the poor fund.
The city will pay the rent on the build
ing for six months with the under
standing that they will keep it up, if
the undertaking proves successful.
An ordinance was adopted, accept
ing the Sarah E. Hamilton addition
in Xortheast Columbia.
A sidewalk was ordered laid on the
north side of Rosemary Lane from Col
lege avenue to Hockaday street. The
necessary assessments were made on
the property owners.
Ordinances to meet the regular ex
penses of Xovember were passed. An
appropriation of $2,130.53 was made
from the water and light fund, $97.50
from the meter fund and $44.15 from
the Conley poor fund.
George D. Crist appeared before the
council asking permission to move
five houses over the streets. The
matter was referred to the street
committee and city engineer with
power to act.
Prof. W. J. Shepard reported that
city workmen had not repaired the
damage on the terrace of Judge J. D.
Lawson, made in digging a ditch for
a water main. Also that a load of
rubbish was left on the corner of his
yard when the streets were cleaned
for the Missouri-Kansas game. The
matter was referred to the street com
mittee. The city attorney reported that there
were several houses on Christian Col
lege avenue which ought to be con
nected with the city sewer. He was
ordered to draw up an ordinance re
quiring such action by the property
owners.
Adjournment was taken until 7:30
o'clock tomorrow night. An ordinance
relating to fire protection and control
will be taken up at that time.

TO
J. W. Schwabe Seeks to Stop
City From Buying
Sewer.
J. W. Schwabe said this morning
that injunction papers would be filed
against Columbia today or tomorrow
o prevent the payment of $3,278.25 to
the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company.
The city council adopted a report rec
ommending payment of the claim when
funds were available. An ordinance
was passed to pay $278.25 at once.
Mr. Schwabe notified Mayor W. P.
Moore this morning that the city would
be enjoined against the payment and
asked him not to sign any warrants
on the account.
The claim against the city is for
a sewer which was paid for by the
shoe company about six years ago and
which' the city council at that time
agreed to pay for, when the sewer
f,und of the city had sufficient money
not otherwise appropriated, Mr.
Schwabe says. The agreement be
tween the city council and the shoe
company management was left with
out any settlements or attempt to set
tle it until the death of A. D. Brown,
president of the company with whom
it was made. It was brought up re
cently by the administration of his
estate.
For several meetings of the city
council the matter of paying the claim
has been considered. Mayor Moore
said that there was really no binding
legal contract in the adoption of the
report last night because the sewer
department never has any surplus
fund, that what is paid through that
department is procured only for a
definite payment.
"There are things, however," said
the mayor, "which would give the shoe
company a claim. The city has col
lected about four hundred dollars from
persons whom have made connections
into the sewer and are using it. Also
the company built a larger sewer than
would be necessary for its use alone
indicating it was intended for the city.
There are several sections of the city
using the sewer."
Persons who were members of the
Commercial Club at the time the shoe
factory was built, and who were in
strumental in getting the shoe compa
ny to locate a factory here say that
the city is under moral obligations to
pay for the sewer. Some of that Com
mercial Club promised representatives
of the shoe company to use their moral
influence to get the city to pay for the
sewer. Those who signed that agree
ment are J. A. Hudson, William Hirth,
W. B. Xowell, W. W. Gartn, w. i.
Anderson, C. B. Bowling. R. B. Price,
Sr., S. C. Hunt, E. W. Stephens, Dr.
Stanley Smith, W. S. St. Clair, S. F.

AT
TOPPLING. POINT
Dictator Expected to Flee
When Constitutionalists
Attack Mexico City.
DIAZ MADE GENERAL
Disapproval of Present Rule
Spreads in Mexico Wil
son Expects Crash Soon.
By United Press.
WASHIXGTOX, D. C, Dec. 3.
President Wilson and Secretary
Bryan are considering the plans for
the handling of Mexico after the
elimination of Huerta. It is believed
that Huerta will flee from the coun
try when the Constitutionals prepare
for the final assault on the capital
city. As soon as Carranza is firmly
established in Mexico City, President
Wilson will demand a complete out
line of his plans. If he grants a gen
eral armistice he must prohibit bri
gandage under penalty of death. If
he is fully prepared for a popular
election then United States will re
cognize him.
By United Press.
MEXICO CITY, Mexico. Dec. 3.
There are many indications that
Huerta will soon be forced to resign
or be deposed by the Mexican Con
gress, if he is not assassinated by
some one of his opponents.
The disapproval of the Huerta re
gime is spreading. The newspapers,
controlled by the dictator, printed
President Wilson's message, but in
dignantly say that Wilson does not
know the conditions that exist in
Mexico. They also say that Presi
dent Wilson should not have prophe
sied the elimination of Huerta.
O'Shaughnessy does not believe
British Admiral Cradock should have
visited Huerta, as it only raised the
dictator's estimation of himself and
made the situation harder for every
one. The Mexican Congress received a
message from the government of Co
lombia denouncing the interference
of the United States in the affairs of
Central South American republics,
and urging Mexico to resist the in
terference of this country. A secret
session of the Congress was called
but the answer to Colombia's mes
sage has been postponed.
It is ,announced that Huerta has
ordered General Porfirio Diaz, who
is now in France, on the active army
list, and if necessary would try to
force the former dictator to return to
Mexico.
