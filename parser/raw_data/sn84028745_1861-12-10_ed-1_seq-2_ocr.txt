Florida for the Negroes.
York Tribunt proposes
the liberated s'avet to Florida, there to be
colonized and made useful, prosperous and
happy. If the slates are to be colonized at
11, it is probable Florida ia as eood a place
to send them as conld be selected. It has a
fine climate, a rich soil, and can grow all
kinds of tropical product, from oranges to
cotton the rery artioles that the negro
would prefer to raise to all others.
Florida contains sixty -six thousand square
miles, which makes it larger than Eng
land and Wales. It has fewer white in
habitants than Hamilton County, and
could no doubt be colonized with colored
people with fewer drawbacks than any other
portion of our country. But the Albany
Kniclttrbotlctr is opposed to the colonization
scheme, and asks, Why should we colonize
the slaves at all ? Why not let them be
where they are? Their labor is as much
needed in Georgia and South Carolina aa it
ever was. Why, then, take the slave from
tie land of his birth and ship him off to
Florida or any other place? If we confiscate
the plantations of those engaged in the re
bellion, we confiscate the very laid which
the confiscated slaves might and should till.
The plantations referred to should bo divided
up among lojal men in the army and ntfvy,
and the slaves hired for eo much per month
to work the eaid plantations. This is the
beet and cheapest plan that cm be adopted.
The colonization platform will be highly ex
pensive, and never popular with the negroes.
No man's love of home is stronger than the
African's. This fact should be remembered
by the Government, and nothing done which
will cause this sentiment to render the move
ment abortive. If we send the slaves to
Florida, they will be unproductive for the
first year at lec.st This would be a great
expense to the Government, and highly de
moralizing to the negroes. Let them remain
on the confiscated plantations, and they be
come a self-sustaining institution at once.
On these plantations are the houses, tools,
horses, mules and machinery to do up the
year's work without expending a single dol
lar. The Government should recollect the
motto of Davy Crockett "Be sure you're
right, then go ahead."
A Present from a Cincinnatian to Illinois.
Mr. L. C. Hopkins, of the firm of Cole &
Hopkins of this city, has made the State of
Illinois a present of a magnificent national
flag, of full regulation sizo, twenty by thirty
feet It is made ot the very best bunting,
and will float proudly over the capital upon
the next Union victory. In making mention
cf this present the Illinois Slate Journal says
that the above firm have filled large con
tracts with that State for clothing, -Ac, for
the troops, and that "honesty and fidelity
has invariably characterized their dealings.
Every thing they have furnished has been
manufactured in the best manner, and of the
beat material, and has been fully up to the
standard they agreed to observe. They have
given the Quartermaster no cause of com
plaint in any respect, and their articles have
lean furnished at much lower prices than
have been paid in some other States. It is a
fortunate circumstance, both for the treasury
and for the troops, that the contracts for sup
plies were awarded to this firm."
Steam Fire Engines for Washington.
The Government has determined' to order
two steam fire engines for the City of Wash
ington, each to be accompanied with several
experienced men to operate and take care of
it. The Fire Department in Washington has
become disorganized, and this wise action is
taken for the protection of the public buil
dings. Had there been only one steam fire
engine on band, it is stated the Infirmary,
which was lately burned down in that city,
would hare been saved. Why should not
some of our mechanics have the contract for
furnishing tht.se engines? Cincinnati has
been somewhat overlooked in giving out
Government work.
Mittens.
The knitting mania is general and should
be kept up, and we have directions, and pat
terns and diagrams. A lady friend says it is
Strange some one does not suggest how easy
it if, and how much better it is for those who
understand It, to crochet the mittens. Many
young ladies can crochet rapidly, who knit
with painful slowness and slow painfullness,
and then it is so much mote quick and easy.
No taking off of stitches, no changing
needles and knitting gores, but straight
forward work. It is easy to crochet a pair
in a day, and not as easy to knit a pair
the same time. Please pass on the word
crochet mittens!
A Noble Work.
The Ameiican Bible Society has done
great work for the army and navy. It baa
distributed, in these two branches ot the
national service, about half a million copies
of the Scriptures, mostly of the New Testa
ment, and is now issuing seven thousand
copiea a day. Every man in our volunteer
regiments, who would receive one, has been
furnished, as we are informed, with a very
neat and portable copy of the New Testa
ment ; and the lime good work is to be done
for the other regiments that may yet volun
teer in the . service of their country to the
end of the war. So noble an object is worthy
of every body's sympathy and co-operation.

Aid to Ireland.
The war has not drawn so largely upon
the resources of the country as to shut out
sympathy for suffering in other lands. In
Ireland the crops have been so bad that the
people are threatened with another famine,
and the suffering is already very great. The
Archbishop of Tuam has earnestly called the
attention ot the British Government to the
fact, but as yet measures of relief do not ap
pear to be adopted. It is proposed in Mas
sachusetts to send out a ship-load of food to
the relief of those sufferers who have so
many of their friends and relatives in this
country. A retired sea-captain offers to give
one hundred barrels of flour, and gratuitously
command the vessel which will take the
Paying Volunteers.
Senator Wilson introduced a bill on Mon
day, by one section of which the Paymaster
General is authorized and required to detail
an Assistant Paymaster to reside in each
loyal State for the purpose of paying the
families of the volunteers from that State
their allotment, as it falls due. By another
section, the President is authorized to ap
point three persons from each State, to serve
without pay, whose duty it shall be to visit
the troops from their respective States and
obtain the signatures of soldiers to allotment
rolls.
Cloaks and Dry Goods.
Messrs. Deland & Gossage, who have one
of the most extensive dry goods establish
ments in the Western country, throw their
banner to the world to-day in the columns
of the Pm:ss. A continuous Btream of ladies
in and out of their establishment establishes
the fact that it is popular. And as evidence
that they are liberal dealers, we may remark
that they are among the most liberal adver
tisers in the city.
Revolutionary Soldiers.
On the 1st of June last, according to the
report of theCommissioner of Pensions, there
were but sixty-three Revolutionary patriots
on the "pension rolls, and that number by this
time has no doubt been reduced to less than
fifty. A few years more and the last of these
old veterans will have been gathered with
his patriotic brothers in the spirit land. We
hope the last one, at least, will live to see
the country again united and happy.
The Confederate Capital.
It is now reported that Richmond is still
the rebel Capital, though bow long it will
remain so ia uncertain. The report of a vote
to remove it to Nashville, which came from
rebel Ecurces, rj ay be explained, by the fact
that the rebel Congress sits with closed
doots, so that the world outside is sometimes
wholly in the dark as to its action, and the
rebels themselves are often deceived.
Opposition to the President.
A letter-writer in Washington states a
movement is on foot among the ultra anti
slavery party in Congress to organize an op
position to President Lincoln's Administra
tion. The President is fully advised and
prepared for the onset.
Tbi Union papers in Kentucky, including
the Louisville Journal and Democrat, are
very severe iu their denunciation of the
President's Message and Secretary Came
ron's Report. They object especially to the
slavery portions of those documents to
what they regard as a wink at emancipa
tion from the President, and to the Secreta
ry's proposition to arm the slaves.

Opposition to the President. A Chapter on Contrabands.
The Virginia contrabands at Old Point
Comfort are housed and fed at the expense
of the Government, and lead a very con
tented life; bot, if we may Judge by the
statements of a correspondent of the National
Intelligencer, they are too much engrossed in
the enjoyment of the novel sensation of free
dom to give any serious attention to hard
labor. The Intelligencer' correspondent
draws this picture of
CONTRABANDS AT WORK.
certainly very amusing to
these contrabands engaged at what, in a
measure, has been misnamed "work." In
order to transport a bale ot bay a distance of
from twenty to thirty yards it takes about
eighteen or twenty laborers, men and boys,
who perform the operation somewhere in the
neighborhood of twenty minutes. First, one
will give it a turn over, roll his body on it,
drop down on his elbows, and have a quiet
grin for several seconds. Then it will be
passed to tbe next one, who proves to be a
perfect genius in the art of imitation; and so
on it goes through the whole gang. At
times the gangs will suddenly grow small
and beautifully less in consequence of some
of tbe laborers having decided to amuse
themselves a la Heenan, others having started
off on a foot race, and more resolved on get
ting np an impromptu circus.
just atwut tins juncture a sergeant may oe
seen recollecting the scapegoats by dint of a
resort to his lungs. Not unfrenuently Mr.
Contraband is made aware of the fact that
there is an "all-seeing" eye, by having a
brick pass his leg with considerable rapidity
at a distance ratner too close tor personal
comfort. When I describe how a bale of bay
is unloaded, tbe description will serve as a
very safe criterion by which to judge the
manner in which every thing elBe iB removed
ana Bioreu away, it is not unusual to sse bait
a dczen negroes wheoling a band-cart gen
erally with nothing in it; a coal cart backed
up to a heap of lumber almost off the dock-,
or into some other cart or wagon, rather than
where it is wanted; eight or ten "darkeys"
removing a stick of lumber, while the same
number are engaged in warming their feet
or dancing a jig; little ebonies hurrahing for
some notability in the hope of getting a
penny from a passing officer; more little
blacks playing soldier, scampering after a
band of music, or throwing; dust: and
wenches swaggering:, grinning and canerine
by tbe roadside, or coquetting with their
lellows.
The same, writer, however, admits that
many of the negroes are intelligent and will
ing. He gives this interesting account of
the
ABSURD STORIES TOLD TO SLAVES.
One party, with which I entered into con
versation, stated that their masters bad told
them tbat, in tbe tventof their running away,
tbey would be sold to the white female abo
litionists of tbe IvoitQ tor husbands, and their
wenches taken away from them and trans
ferred to the men abolitionists for wives. On
asking one of the party what he thought of
such a story, he replied "that be bad not as
yet seen any one sold, but tbat, if such should
prove to be a fact, he did not know but that
be could live just as well North as South. I
conversed wiih 'varioiiB other parties, both
free and bond, and almost all of tbem were
well stored with absurd stories not at all dis
similar to the one given above.
Secretary Cameron's Report.
The Washington correspondent of the Bos
ton Journal gives the following as the way
in which Secretary Cameron's report was
changed. It may be gossip or fact, we know
not which, but it is generally conceded tbat
the Deport was changed:
It is now known tbat when Secretary
Seward read the wer report he objected to
its treatment of tbe contraband question,
and insisted on having tbe paragraphs ex
putgfd. This Secretary Cameron at first
refused to do, and it was not until eleven
o'clock on Tuesday night that he consented,
after having been told distinctly by the
President that be must make tbe changes or
resign. He then submitted to the emascula
tion of his report, but with the knowledge
tbat several hundred copies bad been sout to
the principal cities, and that the terrors of
imprisonment at rort warren or Lafayette
would not muzzie toe press, -lccordiugiy.
we have tbe report Simon pure, and the
came document edited by Seward. The
Stcretary of State played a hih game and
won, but tbe Secretary ot War held the trick
ai.d has tbe honor.
It is also said tbat the President's messacw.
as sent into Congress, was to some extent
worked over by the secretary of State, and
that he was virtually sustained by all of the
Uabtnet except secretaries Cameron and
Chase, Secretary Welles siding witn these
gentlemen, but not wishing to enter into
any controversy on a matter which the
President couio decide.
A promulgation of these facts has caused
an advance iu conservative stock, but the
more progressive Republicans are only tbe
more earnest to carry their points, and tbey
declare tbat Congiefs will adopt Cameron's
policy. So we may expect a stormy session,
but it is to be hoped tbat ere long there will
be a harmonious concert of action, tor a di
vided North iB just what tbe rebels have ever
piayed for.
A New Orleans Suggestion.
of
The New Orleans Cretccnt makes this sug
gestion: "It Ib high time this city was purged of
an persons woo express nortnern sympa
thies, or who manifest joy at any trifling
success of our enemies. If tbe forcible ar
rest of Messrs. Mason and Slidell be not re
eented forthwith by Great Britain, the Brit
ish Consulate should be required to be
closed in this city mstanter. The British
Government has not sent a Consul to the
Confederate States, and it is derocatorr on
tbe part of tbe Confederate Government to
1 permit tbe residence among us of a British
otnciai accredited to the Lincoln Uovern
ment."
In other words, if the rebels can not ob
tain a recognition from England in any
o'her way, they are ready to go to war with
ber on their own account.

Till Monboe Doctbini. As people at

tbe purport of this famous doctrine, we copy
an accurate statement of it from tbe National
Intelligencer, as follows:
President Monroe never arrogated to tbe
United States a monopoly of political con
trol in the affairs of the American Conti
nents. What he said was, tbat no part of
their surface ot that date (in tbe year 1823),
was open to tbe colonization of European
powers by tbe right of discovery and settle

occupied territory. To which "doctrine" of

Secretary of the Treasury's Report.
[Abstract by Telegraph.]
NEW YORK, Monday, December 9.
The Secretary of the Treasury's report, after
referring to the recommendations contained in
his July report, gives the manner in which he
ob'alned loans for various purposes of Govern
ment. The immediate exigencies were pro
vided for by Issuing $4,019,034 in 0 per cent,
two-years Treasury-notes, and $12,677,760 in
rams notes payable In sixty days. His next
rare was to provide for disbursements for the
war. andTie adopted the plan to engage the bank-
ilea? Institutions of the three commercial oltiee of
the seaboard to advance tne amount nseaea, in j
loans for three years 7 8 10 bonds, to be reim
bursed from proceeds of similar bonds, sub
scribed for by the people, hoping thus to oom
bine the capital of the banks and the people
with tbe oredit of the Government, se as to
give efficiency to administrative action, and
competent support to publis credit, and the
result has fulfilled tbe hope.
He then rehearses the argument entered into
between the banks and himself, by which the
former agreed to take the loans. The history
of the first two loans has been made public.
The second loan wasnegotleted with the Dinks
on the 10th of November, by which he agreed
to issue to them $50,000,000 in 9 per oent bonds
at par for the bonds bearing 7 per cent, inter
est. This agreement was coupled with no ar
rangement tor reimbursement, and entailed no
txpense, exeept the prepaying and issuing of
tbe bonds. Tbis was also complied with the
option to tbe banks, that on or after tha 1st of
January ,a fourth advance of $50,009,000 should
be made on tbe same terms as first or second,
if required.
In addition to these loans $21,145,220, np
to the 30th of November, were issued in Treasury-notes
of $5's $10's and $20'a, payable on
demand, and $3,385,105 remained iu the Treat
uty. This amount may be regarded as a loan
from tbe people. The aggregate realized from
loans in various forms is $197,742 .688. The
revenue receipts have not fulfilled his expecta
tions. He says an act modifying the rites of
duties dlfTored from the measure be submitted
to Congress. In most of these particulars, es
pecially in diminished duties on tea, ooffes and
sugar, and exempting goods in warehouse and
on shipboard, the difference was disadvanta
geous to the revenue, while a potential cause of
reduced receipts may be found in the changed
circumstances of the country proving unfavor-
ab'e to foreign commeroe.
These circumstances compel him to reduce
his estimates for 1862 from the revenue from
$fi7,000,000 to $32,198,602. Tbe estimates
from receipts from lands and miscellaneous
tfouroes he reduces from $3,000,000 to $2,304,
062. Tbe only other source of revenue is a
direct tax authorised by Congress, which, if
increased to the limit proposed by tne Secre
tary and assumed by States, the further sum
of $20,000,000 may be expected. The aggre
gate of revenue may be thus estimated at
$54,552,060, whlnh iB $25,417,334 less than the
estimate of July.
Tbe Secretary states the estimates for July
were baed on tbe raising of 250,000 vntua
teeis, and an increase of tbe Regular Army by
11 regiments, but after that report bad been
olosed Congress au'horlied the accep'anoe by
tbe President of 6tiU,l)mi men, Besides addi
tional companies and outers. Tbis larfe in
crease has and must necessarily augment the
expenditures far beyond the limit indicated by
the original estimates, which will be still fur
ther extended by the increase of tbe Nivy,
siid additional appropriations are esked for.
Of these additional appropriations $47,985,566
wee authorized by acts of last session, and
$143,130,927 are now akod for, making an ag-
sreea-e, including: $22,787,933 for indefinite
appropriations, of $213,904,427.
To provide these large sums, retrenchment
and refuim are indispensable. Contracts should
be subjected to strict supervision, and con
tractors rleorous responsibility. All unneces
sary offices ihnuld be abolished and salaries
and pay materially reduced. While thus reoom
mending retrenchment, be fee s himself con
S'rained to review suggestions heretofore sub
mitted bv him. that property of rebels should
be made to pay, in part at least, the cost of
rebellion. Property of great value in loyal
States is held by proprietors virtually engaged
in cuilty attempts to break up the Union, wbioh
Is justly mifeittd to the people, which should
be suHec'ed to sequestration or confiscation,
and the proceeds applied to the satisfaction of
claims arising from tne war.
Pioperty of rebels in rebel States should be
treated in the same mauner. Ruhts to ser-
victs nnder State laws must, of necessity, form
an exception to any rule of confiscation. Per
sons beld by rebels, under such laws, to service
as slaves, may. however, be justly liberated
from their constraint, and made more valuable
in various employment, through voluntary
and compensated services, than if confiscated
aa sonncs or property.
The Secretary says 'ha most sacred duty
the American people now requires tne consecra
tion of all their energies and resources to tho
etablUbment of tbe Union, and sound polioy
would seem to suggest no extension of ireiga
ttade, but more absr lute reliance on American
libor. American skill and American soil.
Be recrmmends duties on tea, coffee and su
gar, be increat-ed to 2o. per pound on brown,
3d. on clayed, ZOo on green tea, oe on oolite,
and tbat no oiber al'eritiom of tariff ba made
unless further txperienite shall demonstrate the
necessity. He deems it necessary to increase
tbe direct tax so as to produce from loyal
Sta'es a revenue ot at leat $20,000,000, esti
mating such duties on stills, distilled liquors,
tobacco, bmk notes, carriages, legacies on
paper evidences of debt, and conveyances
property and other like property as will pro
duce an equal additional sum. The loorease
tax will probably produce $10,000,000 more,
making an aggregate of $50,000,000.
The secretary is aware tbat the sum is large,
but seeing no probability of revenue exoeeding
4tt,UUU,U(iu during tne current year, be t-eta
that be must not tbrink trotn a plain state
ment of actual necessities of the situation.
Two fifths of one per cent, on real and personal
property of lojal states will produce $44,d0.
POO, tbe proposed Income adding $10,000,000
7 be becretary recommends a plan for a Na
ticnal circu ia ion of notes, the features of which
are a creulBtn of notes bearing a common
Impirsslon, at d authenticated by oomtuoa au
tbority. Tbe redemption of these notes
aeeocianons andinatitutions to which thry may
be delivered for issue and the security of that
redemption by pledge of United States Stocks
aid an adrquate provision of specie.
An important advantage to the peon'e
this plan wou'd be in tbe iacreastd security

its preservation, created by the distribution
i s stocks to asroeiaiions throughout the coun
try as lbs basis of their circulation; anl

desirable, it is most desirable to tbis torm.
