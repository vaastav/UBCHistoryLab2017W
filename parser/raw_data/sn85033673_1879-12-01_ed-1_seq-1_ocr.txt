. We publiah to-day a coiumuuica
tion from Mr. Wm. 15. Moore on the
subject of earth closets, which will be
read with interest. He makes the
most out of a very utmttractivo theme
and is very happy in J'acctiousnesa.
We are inclined to agree with him
that no earth closet system can be gen
erally and permanently adopted. It
would require more attention than the
majority of mankind would bestow.
It might answer for somo fam
ilies of adults who understand
the laws of nature and the im
portance of sanitation, but in many
instances the use of earth would be
neglected and the neighborhood would
beeme unendurable. A sewer system
is within our means. Mr. Moore's
suggestion is practical get the vaults
cleaned out at night partly filled with
earth and use as before until a connec
tion can be made with the sowers.
We take it for granted from the
present indications of popular
sentiment that a system of
sewerage will be undertaken this
winter which can be finished in from
three to five years. If a reasonable
tax bo levied for such a purpose, the
people will pay it promptly in prefer
ence to any other tax, because they
know the money will be expended at
onco in their midst ; that it will give
employment to labor, improve the
licalthlulness of the city and enhance
the value of their property. If the
legislature is convened in extra ses
sion, we shall insist that the bill to be
submitted shall contain a provision
allowing tho sewerage tax to be paid
separately, whether other taxes arc
paid or not. Many people who cannot
pay all their taxes would make an
effort and pay a tax of this kind for
the improvement of our sanitary con
dition.
MEMPHI8 AE3 HER HECESSITIE3.
Under this caption the Nashville
American of the 30th ult., contains a
sensible and dispassionate editorial,
from which we take the following
paragraphs :
'"The first consideration now for the
public mind in Tennessee is the reflec
tion that there is an evil and that it
calls for some remedy. Is it purely
local, or is it an evil which affects all
the people of the state? In one sense
it is local, in that the plague and di
rect interruption of business and loss
of life arc nt Motuphis. It docs not
stop there. Tfinnessco feels the de
struction of her citizens as a direct
loss of energy. The commerce of the
entire state fools the weight of the
blow directly and indirectly. Tho af
fected city becomes a plague center of
distribution. Almost all of West
Tenne6soo suffers in health, in stagna.
tion of industry and commerce and in
reputation. Indeed, it affects the
reputation of the entire state. We
know of a colony which was about to
settle in a mountainous country which
was deterred by this very cause, and,
sillhougli theycamo eventually, it was
in diminished numbers. Memphis is
the largest commercial city in the
-state, occupying an excellent position,
from which it draws commerce from
Arkansas and Mississippi, by reason
of its position and the aggregation of
capital and concentration of transpor
tation on account of position. Her
commerce, tho large taxes she pays,
the development of the surrounding
country by a large city are so much
ilenr gain for Tennessee.
Jliere is thus no ninglo interest af
fected that docs not directly touch the
pocke of all Tennessee. In commerce,
agriculi.we.iinniigration, in tax-paying
and sharing burdens, in all progress,
Memphis, jlague-strickcn, becomes a
burden instead of a benefit. Then it
is plain that, wi;ilo it. is immediately
local, the evil is Kenenl. It is one for
sistance can be afforded, and we doubt
not that those who are in close com
munication with the subject can sug
gest a policy at once feasible and ade
date, and upon this point wo do not
venture an opinion in the present state
of knowledge as to precisely what is
needed. As to tho general and vital
interest of the State in the subject as
to-the duty of those whose position
tirings them ofEciilly in contact with
the subject and with 11 tho means of
information to auggest somo adequate
and practicable remedy, there W P
question.
Mr, W. P. Dunavant, of this city
and Mr, David Cullahan, of Pensacola,
have taken a contract to build 70 miles
of railroad from TcnsacoU Junction,
which is 42 miles this side of Peuat
coln, to l'ine Applo Station on tho
Seliua and Gulf Railroad. This will
give Selma a direct route to PcnMucola
by 1M miles of railroad through a f ne
cotton country. The work is being
3one by English capitalists. Th
iron is broughtas ballast from England
at 01) cents on tho ton. I'cusaculu Las
a splendid harbor. Mr. Dtinavauf,
just from there, saw two hundred and
lifty sailing veswls faking on lumber
at ono time. If !e only had the
Memphis and Selma road through,
this would give Memphis tbe elmrtcat
liossiblc outlet to saltwater and to tho
cotton mirkcts of Europe. With tlu
return of prosperity and tho disap
pearance of epidemics, which may
reasonably be expected, we will soon
be in a eonditiou to consider great
enterprises and enter upon no era of
prosperity little dreamed of in the jast
ten years.

Ji st as wo expected, Currie, the
assasin' of Ititcr. the inoffensive
actor, at Marshail, Texas, was granted j
another continuance the other day, j
and the case cannot bo called until j
April. This time it was the State's
witnesses who were absent. They
were there the first time, some of them
having traveled over fifteon hundred
miles to give their testimony. They
were enabled to bear the expenses
of such a trip by the aid of
their professional brethren in the
East. The State refused to allow the
ease to go to trial on somo slight tech
nical grounds, and the witnesses as
well as the outside public felt . that it
was all a farce and a mockery, and
that Currie would never bo brought
to justice. There was some mild talk
about hanging him some time or
other, but it is more likely to be done
for some future murder, 'after he gets
out of jail, than for . the mur
der of Porter. It was hard
ly to be expected that Mr.
Harrymore would break a good en
gagement at Philadelphia and lose his
place to face the chances of another
continuance, or that Miss Cummins,
who was so unnerved by the terrible
scene she was forced to witness, would
feci like going back to have the horror
recalled. Another witness, named
Harvey, who was present at tho mur
der, lately visited Shreveport, where
Currie lias a brother a man of influ
ence, and, if we mistake not, the
Mayor of that place. Harvey was not
present when the case was last called.
We still predict that Currio will go
scott free. His release has only been
a matter of time ever since the first
continuance was granted.
The public is waiting, but not very
patiently, to hear from the committee
of fifteen, appointed at a mass meeting
of citizen:), over two weeks ago. This
jury has been out 16ng enough. We
want a report without further delay.
Time is precious and it is burning up.
If these gentlemen with all tho lights
before them cannot agree upon some
thing lot them sny so, and the
peoplo will look in somo othe'r
direction for advice. The re
port of the sanitarians and ex
perts was submitted last Friday, it
contained practical suggestions worthy
if consideration, but the coninittce
Jiouldnot cogitate all winter and then
inform u that it is too late to do any
thing this year. The fever has been
over a month, and what has Memphis
within herself done toward imnrovinir
the sanitary condition of the place?
W e answer, held a mass-meeting and
proposed in the legislative council an
ordinance requiring an earth closet
system to be established. The world
outside says we are doing nothing, and
the proposition is not hard to prove.
Indifference on the part of property
holders and business men to tho pro
per administration of municipal eov-
erunient years ago, brought about our
deplorable condition. Every other man
has a theory or a plan, and each ono is
opposed to all other plans, except
his own. We have never seen the
people of Memphis agree upon any
thing except getting out of town when
an epidemic is announced. This
committeo is composed of as good and
intelligent men as we have, and if they
cannot agree upon a plan of action and
that speedily, we may as well give up
doing anything this winter.
A l.L the lawlessness and sin of the
country is not confined to the South.
Tho Cincinnati Commercial of yester
day contains the following startling
head-lines over its columns of local
and tolcgraphic news: "Sins found

MEMPHIS, TENN.: MONDAY EVENING, DECEMBER i, 1879.
The President's annual message,
presumably delivered to congress to
day, is quite a voluminous document
and ono that comparatively few per
sons will read. He congratulates con
gress on the success of resumption,
and tho prosperity of the country.
Polygamy in Utah receives more than
a passing notice, with tho suggestion
that those who violate the -law be
punished. The late elections seem to
have bad a pleasing effect on the ex
ecutive mind. John Sherman's
barrel in Ohio was not in vain.
As to civil service reform, which
the President preaches but don't
practice always, he says his former
views aro strengthened by enlarged
experience. Much space is devoted to
this subject. Uur relations with for
eign powers are as lovely as usual. The
reports of the departments are alluded
to in as dry a manner as possihft.
Eads jetties are a success so far. Peace
reigns like a lamb on a southern hill
side on the Mexican frontier. The
secretary of the navy has saved up and
turned over nearly a million and a
halt dollars which is more than can be
said of his predecessors. The business
of the supremo court is in arrears; ad
ditional circuit judges are recom
mended. Recommendations are made
to still further civilize the Indians.
Agriculture, we are informed, is a
leading industry. Education should
be iostered, and national literature,
whatever that is, should be perpetu
ated. This, doubtless, includes presi
dential messages sent out ahead of
time.. The streets of Washington arc
out of repair and some of them
should be repaved. The people there
also want more new school houses.
No allusion is made to the south.
This is the sum and substance ot a
message, which fills more than one
side of a big newspaper. We could
not afford to publish it for less thau
twenty cents a line, and then would
have to apologize to our readers for the
infliction.
Since the stalwarts have discovered
what they imagined to be a Grant
movement among the Democrats of
the South, they have cooled off won
derfully and begin now to reason that
tho country can take care of herself
without the aid of any particular man.
They aro lato finding it out. We can
assure the unreconstructed Republi
cans that there is a kiuJly feeling to
ward Grant personally iu the South,
and that if he ever comes this
way we will treat him with
proper respect and give him as
cordial a welcome as he ever received
in his life. This however, has no po
litical significance whatever. We
think Grant would make a great mis
take to accept the presidency from any
party or from all parties combined.
He has outlived the prejudices that
grew up against his administration.
although not tho memory of it. He is
recognized as the most prominent
private citizen of thd country,
honored at homo and abroad,
and need not want for useful em
ployment in a lucrative position
congenial to his tastes and habits.
There are private corporations which
could well afford to give him fifty
thousand dollars a year for his ser
vices aud tho use of his name. The
question seems to be who will capture
him; the Republican party or the
Nicaraugua canal. There is no danger
that the Democrats will nominate him
for president.

silver dollars must take their place and
existing plethora be revived. Further
relief will come in due time from
natural action of trade money
that has followed in such profusion
from Europe to the United States can

will soon be felt in the rise of prices

A YaluuMe Medicine.
Buchu in various forms lias for many
years been one of the chief articles in the
Materia Medica for the treatment of cer
tain discasos, among which are chiefly
those affecting th urinnry, digestive and
circulatory orwns. The difficulty that
was long experienced in obtaining a pre
paration of this valuable drug that could
always b relied upon for uniformity in
strength and absolute purity led to the
introduction of ITelmlold's Extract of
Buchu, whiih fot the last (juai'ter of a
century has been extensively used both
by physicians and in house and family
practice, and with very grutifvinc success
This medicine, like every other valuable
thing, has been extensively imitated, and
those who have no for it will do well to
sec that they obtain the genuino "Helm
bold Buchu," the only pure and reliable
preparation.
