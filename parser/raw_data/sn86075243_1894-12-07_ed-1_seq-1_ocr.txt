President Cleveland Makes a Big
Talk to the United States v
Congress. a
HE IS STILL AGAINST SILVER :
He Favors Free Trade and Untaxed r
Circulating For State t
Banks.
WAsninoroN, Dec. 3.-The president's
message war read in both houses of con
grass this afternoon. It is one of the
longest documents of the kind ever
issned, containing 30,000 words. A large
part of it is devoted to copious extracts
from the reports of cabinet officers for
the past year. The salient points are c
covered in the following synopsis:
To the (Yongress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's t
legislative hall of those charged with the
duty of making laws, for the benefit of a
generous and free people, impressively
suggests the exacting obligation and
inexorable responsibility involved in their
task. At the threshold of such labor, I
now to be undertaken by the congress of
the United States, and in the discharge
of an executive duty enjoined by the con
stion, I submit this communication con
taining a brief statement of the situation
of our national affairs and recommend
ing such legislation as seems to me neces- I
sary and expedient. (
FOIEIiN POLICY.
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations and our peaceful relations
with them at this time, additioialy dam
onstrate the advantage of consistently
adhering to a firm but just foreign policy,
free from envious or ambitious national
schemes and characterized by entire
honesty and sincerity. During the past
year, pursuant of a law of congress, com
missioners were appointed to the Ant
werp industrial exposition. Through d
the participation of American exhibitors, d
far short of completely illustrating our
national ingenuity and industrial achieve- c
ments, yet it was still creditable, in view
of the brief time allowed for preparation. V
Although the war between China and a
Japan endangers no policy of the United
States, it deserves our gravest consider- e
ation by reason of its disturbance of our
growing commercial interests in the two
countries and the increased dangers
which may result to our citizens dom- a
iciled or sojourning in the interior of 0
China. Acting under a stipulation in b
our treaty with Corea (the first concluded
with a western power) I felt constrained n
at the beginning of the controversy to r
tender our good otlices to induce
an amicable arrangement of the a
initial dilliculty growing out of L
the Japanese demands for adminis- n
trative reforms in Corea. The unhaj py r
precipitation ef actual hostilities de- 1;
feated thiskindly purpose. Deploring the
destructive war between the two most e
powerful of the Eastern nations, and
anxious that our commercial interes a in n
those countries may be preserved and s
the safety of our citizens there shall not c
be jeopardized, I would not hesitote to p
heed any intimation that our friendly 0
act for the honorable termination of h )s- -
tilities would be acceptable to both bol- a
ligerents. The German government tas n
excepted against that provision of the
customs portion of the tariff act, which
mposes a discriminating duty of one- 0
tenth of a cent a pound on sugars com- I
ing from countries paying an export c
bounty thereon, claiming that the enac- a
tion of such duty is in contravention of a
article five and nine of the Treaty of es
1820 with Prussia. In the interests of ti
the commerce of both countries, and to a
avoid even the accusation of treaty vio
lation, I recommend the repeal of so m ti
much of the statute as imposes that
duty, and I invite attention to the ac
companying report of the secretary of t
state, containing a discussion of the
questions raised by the German protest. b
(In regard to the Paris tribunal award
on the seal fisheries question the presi- n
dent recommends the payment to Groat
Britain of $425,000 in full satisfaction
of all damages.) Since communicating a
the voluminous correspondence in re 1
gard to Hawaii, the action taken by the 1
senate and house of representatives on a
certain questions submitted to the judg
ment and wider descretion of congress, t
the organization of a government in t
place of the provisional arrangement,
which followed the deposing of the i
queen, has been announced with evi.
dence of its effective operation. The tl
recognition usually in such cases has
been accorded the new government. c
OUi OWN (MrNTIav. si
The secretary of the: treasury reports It
that the receipts of the government ei
from all sources of revenue during the at
fiscal year ending Juno 30, 1891, ti
amounted to $372,802,409.28, and expend- is
itures to $442,005,758.87, leaving a deficit n
of Q69.Rf3,260.58. There was a decrease ti
of 015,952,074.60 in the ordinaryr r-enses al
of the government as compared with ir
the fiscal year of 1893. 'There was col I cn
leoted from customs $131,818,530.62 and 1
from internal revenue $147,168,449.70. I
The balance of income for the year, I
amounting to $93,815,517.97, was derived I
from the sales of land and other sources.
NO ARMY INCREASE.
From the reports of the secretary of t
war it appears that the strength of the i
army on September 30, 1894, was 2,135
officers and 25,765 enlisted men. Al. I
though this is apparently a very slight I
decrease compared with the previous
year, the actual effective force has been (
increased to the equivalentof nearly two I
regiments through the reorganization of
the system of recruiting and the conse- I
quent release to regimental duty of the 1
large force of men hitherto servingat the I
recruiting depots. Though the forces of t
the department of the east have been
somewhat increased, more than three- I
fourths of the army is still stationed I
r west of the Mississippi. This carefully
matured policy, which secures the beet
and greatest service in the interest of the
general welfare from the small force
comprising our regular army, should not
be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the
creation of new and unnecessary posts
through acts of congress to gratify the
ambitions or interests of localities. While
no considerable increase in the army is,
in my judgment, demanded by recent
events, the policy of sea coast fortilica
r tione, in the prosecution of which we
have been eteadily engaged for some
yeare, has so far doveloped as to suggest
e that the effective strength of the army
- be now made at least equal to the legal
s etrength.
THiE (REAT STIUcES.
It is hardly necessary to recall the
fact that in obedience to the commands
of the constitution and the laws and for
the purpuse of protecting the property
of the United States, aiding the process
a of federal courts and removing lawless
obstructions to the performance by the
government of its legitimate functions,
it became necessary in various localities
during the year to employ a considera
ble portion of the regular troops. The
t duty was discharged promptly, courage
ously and with marked discretion by the
officers and men, and the most gratifying
proof was thus afforded that the army
deserves that complete confidence in its
r efficiency and discipline, which the
e country has at all times manifested.
I[The president recommends that pro
vision be made for the construction of
d additional battle snips and torpedo
d boats, as outlined in the report of the
secretary of the navy.1
WESTERN INTERESTS.
I cheerfully indorse the recommenda- 1
tions of the secretary of the interior that I
appropriate protection be provided for I
our forest reserves and that a compre
hensive forestry system be inaugurated. I
Such keepers and superintendents as are
necessary to protect the forest already I
reserved should be provided.
I am of the opinion that there should be F
an abandonment of the policy sanctioned 1
by present laws under which the govern
ment, for a very emall consideration, is
rapidly losing title to immense tracts of
land covered with timber, which should
be properly reserved as permanent re
sources of timber supply.
I concur in the opinion that the com
missioner of the general land office I
ehould be relieved from the duty of de- 1
ciding litigated land cases, that a non
partisian court should be created to pass
on such cases and that the decisions of I
this court should be final, at least so far I
as the decisions of the department are
now final.
INIiAN SCHIOOIS.
Efforts are being made in the direction
of a gradual reduction of the number of F
Indian contract schools, so that in a
comparatively abort time they may give
way altogether to government schools,
and it is hoped that the change may be I
so gradual as to be perfected without i
too great expense to the government, and I
with due regard to investments by those i
I who have have established and are main- c
taining such contract schools.
ii:NsioNti.
At the close of the last fiscal year on
the 10th day of Juno, 18)1, there were
909,544 persons on our pension rolls,
being a net increase of 3.532 over the
number reported at th1 end of the prev
ious year. Those pensions may be class
itied as follows: solliers aFnd sailors, i
survivors of all wars, 773,tiF0; widows )
and relatives of deceased soldiers, 215.
102; army nurses in the war of the I
rebellion, 114; of these pensioners 3:2,0:11
are surviving soldiers of Ioian and
other ware prior to the latovivil war, and )
the widows and relatives of sui-h ioldiers. t
The remainder, numbering are t
receiving pensions on ac-eunt of the i
war of the rebellion, and of thise 179,31:
are on the rolls under thi authority of I 1
the act of June 27, I1592, smetiinm -
called the dependent pension law.
The total amount FxpoInted for pen )
sions during the year was -139 COIi1.01. e
leaving an inexponcl d balinie from the t
sum appropriated of $2),,0;,71" i).l The I
sum necessary to moot pension expendi I
tures for the year ending Dino :N. 18:11. I
is estimated at $1 1,t18F,1i811, The con I
missioner of pensions is of tie opinion i
that the year 189.), being the thirtieth I
after the close of the warof the rehellion, I
must, according to nil n'nsible human t
cakulation, see the higlest libit of thie
I pension roll, and after that year it must a
begin to decline. The barefaced and ex- 2
teneive pension frauds exposed under a
l the direction of the courageous and gen- r
erous veteran soldiere now at the head t
of the bureau leave no room for the 1,
claim that no purgation of our pension r
roll was needed or that continued vigi. ;
i ance and prompt action are not neces- f
sary to the same end. The accusation a
that an effort to detect pension frauds is t
a an evidence of unfriendliness toward Ii
t our worthy veterans and a denial of a
their claims to the generosity of the gov. I
ernment suggests an unfortunate indif
ference to the commission of an offense a
which has for a motive the securing of a c
pension, and indicates a blindness to the *
existence of the mean and treacherous e
crimes which play upon demagogic fears t
and make sport of the patriotic impulse f
I of a grateful people.
THE TARIF'F'. t
The tariff act passed at the last sea- a
sion of congress needs important amend- t
ments if it Is to be executed effectively
and with certainty. In addition to such
necessary amendments as will not change
the rates of duty, I am still very de
cidedly in favor of putting coal and
iron upon the free list. So far as the
sugar schedule is concerned, I would be
glad, under existing aggravations, to see
every particle of differential duty int
favor of refined sugar stricken out of
our tariff laws. If, with all the favor ac- 1
corded the eugar refining interest in our I
tariff laws, it etill languishes to the ex
tentof closing refineries and discharging
thousands of workmen, it would seem
to present a hopeless case for reasonable
legislation, and whatever else is done or
omitted I earnestly repeat here my rea
ommondation, made in another portion
of this communication, that the addi
tional duty of one-tenth of a cent per
pound laid upon sugar imported from
countries paying a bounty on its export
be abrogated. It seems to me that ex
y cedingly important considerations point
to the propriety of this amendnwant.
With the advent of a new tariff policy,
e not only calculated to relieve the con
cumers of our land in the cost of their
daily life, but to invite a better, our
products and manufactures should find
e markets in every Dart of the habitable
globe, consistently supplemented by the
greatest possible liberty of our citizens
i in the ownership and navigation of ships
in which our products and manufactures
may be transported.
FREE SHIPS.
The millions now paid to foreigners
for carrying American passengers and
products across the sea, should be turned
into American hands. Shipbuilding,
which has been protected to strangula
tion, should be revived by the prospect
of profitable employment for ships when
built, and the American sailor should ts
resurrected and again take his place, a
sturdy and industrious citizen in time of
peace and a patriotic and safe defender
of American interests in the days of
conflict, the ancient development of
American thrift and create for us closer
and more profitable commercial relations
with the rest of the world. It follows as a
logical and imperative necessity that we
should at once remove the chief, if not
the only, obstacle which has so long
prevented our participation in the foreign
carrying trade of the sea. A tariff built
upon the theory that it is well to check
imports, and that a home market should
bound the industry and effort of Amer
ican producers, was fitly supplemented
by a refusal to allow American registry
to vessels built abroad, though owned
and navigated by our people, and thus
exhbbiting a willingness to abandon all
contest for the advantage of
f'i:ANOIe'AN IC .AotiIAIE.
Our new tariff policy, built upon the
theory that it is well to encourage such
importations as our people need, and
that provision of our law denying Amer
ican registry to ships built abroad. and
owned by Americans, appears, in the
light of present conditions, not only to
be a failure for good at every point, but
to be nearer a relic of barbarism than
anything that exists under the permise
sion of a statuto of the enited. States.
I earnestly recommend its prompt repeal.
T'itIV I INANLIAL g , VIi:TIuiN.
during the last month the gold reserve
in the treasury for the PUrpose of re
eeining the notes of the goternmnent
circulating as money in the hands of the
people, hcainm so reduced and its further
depleti in in tlie near future seemed so
cirtain that, in the exorcire of proper
cart for the puilic welfare, it became
necee -ary to riplenish the reserve and
thus miintain p oplir faith in the ability
uln dottrmitination of the nomernment to
moot as egreef its poriiniary obligations.
It would htae horn will if in this emor
goney hl untihority hlid existed to issue
linus of t ho governinit iearing a low
rata of interest ait maturing within a
short pertid. Itongress having failed
to iinfiir oiih iuthority, resort was
nuieesserily hiul to the resumption act of
IsL;.,, mul. pniuiant ito the provision,
hInliis woren is-ut drawing interest at
the rate of l per cent per annum and
iiaturing tin years after their issue,
that living the shortest tium authorized c
hv the not, I ant glad to say, however,
that to tilit salo of these bonds, the
prnitiiu revioved reduced the rate t
it of interest to lees than three per cent.
a- Nothing could be worse or further re.
er moved from sensible finance than the
a- relations existing between the cuerency
Ad the government has issued, the gold
is held for its redemption and the means
in which must be resorted to for the pur
1i" poes of replenishing such redemption
a- funds when impaired. Even it the
m claims upon this fund were confined to
is the obligations originally intended, and
rd it the redemption of these obligations
of meant their cancellation, the fund would
v* be, very small. But these obligations,
if- when received and redeemed in gold, are
se not cancelled, but are reissued and may
a do duty many times by way of drawing
is gold from the treasury. Thus we have
as an endless chain in operation, constantly
re depleting the treasury's gold and never a
so final rest. As if this was not bad
enough, we have by a statutory declara
tion, that it is the policy of the govern
s- ment to maintain the parity between
d- gold and silver, accentuating the force
ly and momentum of this exhausting pro.
ch se and added largely to the currency
go obligation claiming thi! peculiar gold
Le redemption. Our small gold reserve is
id thus subject to drain from every side.
he The demands that increase our danger
be also increase the necessity of protecting
ee this reserve against depletion, and it is
in most unsatisfactory to know that the
of protection afforded is only a temporary
s- palliation. It is perfectly and palpably
ur plain that the only way under present
x- conditions by which this reserve when
dangerously depleted con be replenished
is through the issue and sale of the 1
>le bonds of the government for gold, and
or yet congress has not only thus far de
clined to authorize the issue of bonds
on best suited to such a purpose, but there
st- seems a disposition in some quarters to
er deuy both the necessity and power for
th the issue of bonds at all. I cannot for a
)rt moment believe that any of our citizens
jz are deliberately willing that their gov
Lot ernment should default in its pecuniary
nt. obligations or that its financial opera
tions should be reduced to a silver basie.
cy, At any rate I should not feel that my
sir duty was done if I omitted any effort I
or could make to avert such a calamity. As
nd long, therefore, as no provision is made
ale for final redemption or the putting aside
be for the currency obligation now used to
me repeatedly and constantly draw from the
ipe government its gold, and as long as no
ree better authority for bond issues is al
lowed than at present exists, such au
thority as it becomes necessary to main
tain a sufcient gold reserve and in
ere abundant time to save the credit of our
Od country and make good the financial
red declarations of our government will be
ng, used.
ila- CAOIS.E'S '..AN ENDORSED,
ect
Questions relating to our banks and
currency are closely connected with the
subject just referred to, and they also
present some unsatisfactory features.
Prominent among them are the lack of
elasticity in our currency circulation and
its frequent concentration in financial
centers when it is most needed in other
parts of the country. The absolute di
vorcement of the gevernment from
the business of banking is the ideal re
lationship of the government to the cir
culation of the currency of the country.
This condition cannot he immediately
reached, but as a step in that direction
and as a means of securing a more
elastic currency and obviating other ob
jections to the present arrangement of
hank circulation, the secretary of the
treasury presents in his report a scheme
modifying the present banking laws and
providing for the issue of circulating
notes by state banks free from taxation
under certain limitations. The secretary
explains his plan so plainly, and its ad
vantages ase developed by him with such
remarkable clearness that any effort on
my part to present argument in its sup
port would be supertunce. I shall, there
fore, content myself with an unqualified
endorsement of the secretary's proposed
chiange in the law.
It is quite likely that this scheme may
be usefully amended in some of its do
tails, but I am satisfied it furnishes a
basis for very great improvement in our
resent banking and currer:-y system.
I conclude this counenunicat no fullyF
;ppreciating that the responsihility for
;I legislation affecting the people of the
I cited States rests upon their represen
trtives In congress, and assuring them
that, whether in accordance with the
r-commendations I have made or no'. I
hall be glad to co-operate in perlecting'
any legislation that tends to the pros- I1
'erity and welfare of our country.

Earnest Protest of Pacific Slopers Against
the Funding 11111.
SAN FRANxcisco, Dec. 4. The Exami
ner's monster petition against the fund
ing of the debts of the Pacific railroads,
as proposed by the Reilly bill will be
presented to congress by Representative
James (. Maguire.
The petition is signed with over 2')0,
000 names, and has been bound in two
large volumes. The first volume con
tains only the California lists, compris
ing 1,;2 170 names. The second volume
is devoted to the Pacific coast states and
territories ant scatterine names from
the middle and eastern states. The vol
umes were shipped to Con~gressnatn Ma
guire at Washington.
"I have no reason to believe that the
sentiment among the democratic not
bers of congress against the funding bill
will be materially changed by anything
that has occurred since the adjsurnms-ent
of congress," said Mr. Maguire. "At that
time I felt certain tha four lifths of the
democratic representatives would vote
against the hill. If the vote on the.f1,in
Sf)0 claim, which was defeated a few days
before the adjournment, is any indica
tion of the position of the meet e-rt on
