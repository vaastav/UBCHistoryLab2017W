rather than venture hack to the home of b'

rte story is destroyed by the failure to
mention either tbe name of *? sufferer or
the county or even the State in which be
settled? If any body else than Poster
General Hatton and Secretary handler
were interested in the paper referred to peo
p'e would wonder why .r, aa wcl as l r.
Diwes, has not become disgusted with such
miserable stuff
The wound the Blaiueites have received
has gone to their very marrow; their ma
lignity against the South as the chief in
fiicter of that wound is iuteuse, aud ga
permeates their every utterance about that
section. Their morning orgau in Wash
ipgton is so beside itself with rage against
the Southern people that it i* restraine
by neither a regard for truth or decency in
its utterances regarding them. One o t e
latest of its statements about them is, tnat,
in many sections of the South it is atthemk
of his life that a Northern man ventures to
settle among them ami remaiu a republi
can." And it does this in face of the fact
that in all the South not one single North
ern republican can be found who will say
that he is not as free to express his political
opinions and to vote as be was bsfore he
came South. -
The Twenty five thousaud dollars Gen
eral Mahone fooled ibe national republican
committee out of would have bought enough
votes in New York to have elected Mr.
Blaine. The fact that General Mahone
took that much money away from the com
mittee, knowing it could do no possible
good in his State, and, as it is currently re
ported, not spending any of it, shows con
clusively that.he think* a great deal more
of himself thau of Mr. Blaine and the re
publican party. That he has also soured
on President Arthur is proved by his de
nunciation of the President's newly appoint
ed secretary of the Tieaaury, whom he ac
cuses of an attempt to "betray his party."
But most people think the less the General
says about betraying parties the better for
him.
General Mahone, by the inouth of bis
amanuensis, says: "Senator Hoar is, in
deed, a zealous aud able fiiend of the South
aud the Southern people." Why, certainly.
From tbe old abolitiou times down to the
present, including his recent report ou the
Danville affair, Senator Hoar lias demon
atrated, not only by his words, but his acts, j
that he loves the South and her people with
a love surpassing that of woman?that of
a dog for a cat. But the General was so
dazed by bis recent defeat that he is even
more reckless iu bis assertions now than
ever before?if that be possible.
Senator Cullom, republican, of Illinois,
has introduced a bill to open all branches
?of the United State* military service to col
ored men, and says he believes a negro
ought to have the same right to receive
promotiou as a white mau. Unpatriotic
men will rejoice to see this bill become a
law, because no surer means for destroying
the army could possibly be adopted. Most
white men will uot acknowledge negroes
as their equals?not one will submit to them
tts superiors. The action of the republican
senators on this bill will be watched with
no little curiosity.
A short time before tbe President's last
annual message was sent to Congress a
fiiend of his from New York, then in Wash
ington, said that three days would not
elapse after that message was sent in before
everybody would know at least who ought
t? be the ueit Senator from New York.
But the three days have elapsed, and still
people are just as much in the dark, not
only about who will be the Senator, but
who ought to be, as they were before.
A dispatch from Paris says "it is stated
that Rrussia aud America have protested
against the proposed increase of the French
duty on corn." What Russia may do is for
itself to look after, but that this country
should make any euch protest as that re
ferred to cannot be possible. How could it
be in the face of the fact that its duties on
French products are almost prohibitory?
That little scheme to saddle Grant
upon the country again by pensioning him,
ought to be "set upon" at once, but if the
outrage is to be perpetrated, we think with
the Baltimore Sun, "that the General's late
partner, Mr. Ward, should not be entirely
forgotten by a grateful country."
In accordance with the requirements of
the Constitution, the electoral colleges of
all the States met yesterday and cast their
votes tor president aud vice president re

the impression was that the educationa
bill would be considered.^ But it was not.
Mr. Willis, democrat, of Kentucky, a mem
ber of the committee, says that he and a
large uumb.-r of his fellow democrats are in
favor ol the object of that bill, and that
rather than have no bill at all he would be
willing to take the Senate bill just as it is,
but that it requires unanimous consent to
take that bill from the Speaker's table, and
that a few who are opposed to it have
agreed that one shall be on guard all the
time to object. He hopes, however, that
the conference of the friends of the bill soon
to ba held will devise some means by which
either the House or the Senate bill cau be
brought before the House, when he is sure
one of them will be passed just as reported
or amended, as the case may be.
It was printed in the morning papers that
an agreement bad been made by which the
friends of bills for small public buildings
had consented not to press those bills at
this session, in order that the bills for large
huildings might go through the more easily.
Friend-t of the former bills deny that any
*uch agreement has been made, and say
that all the bills, little and big, are together
and will be considered at the same time.
Mr. Buck uer, chairman of the banking
aud currency committee, says the McPher
.son bill, which allows the national banks a
circulation equal to the par value of their
liOJ.d-.will probably be pa-sed, but that that
will only allord the bauks temporary relief,
and that Congress must eventually come to
his id'-a, vs hicb is that the Government shall
iisucall the circulation notes. Ho says he
will on Monday next introduce a bill to sus
pend the coinage of the silver dollars and the
issue of silver certificates.
Mr. Freeman, the attorney fir the Pos -
..dice Department, is so very anxious for a
free bridge across the Potomac at George
town that he advises incendiaries to burn
the aqucduct bridge, and thus destroy the
Alexandii? canal. Senator Riddleberger's
proposition to destroy that canal, while not
so inflammatory, is just as effective. It is
to build a free bridge half a mile further up
the river. "

and that he, the gentleman referred to,
hopes the General will be the republican

that the committee will 'report a bill re

McCulloch and the President.

Emptying Coal into the Bay.?The
British steamship Cranbrook, Capt. Harvey,
from Shields, has been lying in Chesapeake
bay for a day or two, throwing overboard
coal which she had brought as ballast. This
comes under the law of obstructing naviga
tion and destroying dutiable articles. The
customs authorities of Baltimore notified
Capt. Ha-vey of this conflict with the law,
and it is thought some action will be taken
upon it. It is said to be a common occur
rence with English steamer captains to thus
get rid of coal they bring over in ballast.
They buy it as cheap in Shields as stone or j
dirt ballast, and to throw it over in the I av j
saves the duty upon it here and the cost of
iischarging. i

Within the past few days invitations have
been widely circulated in society circles of
Washington and New York. They read as
follows:
Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Willard request your
presence at the marriage of their daughter
Mary to Mr. Frank Simpson, Thursday
evening, December 11, at 8 o'clock, Metro
politan Presbyterian Church, Washington,
I). C., 18S4.
The wedding will not take place. Yes
terday morning Miss Willard left the house
of her parents, 230 A street southeast, on
ibe pretense of a shopping expedition.
Around the corner there waited for her a
young man namfd William Paxton. They
proceeded to the resideuce of Rev. Di. Ad
dison, rector- of Triuity P. E. Church, and
were married in the presence of the groom's
brother and a few of his intimate personal
friends. The happy couple took the 11 a.
m. train for the South.
The bcide is a handsome brunette, wiLb
large, dark, lustrous eyes, and is well
known in Washington for her stylish dress
ing, graceful carriage and plump figure.
She is about 22 years of age, and the groom
is two years her senior.
Mr. Paxlou, the lucky groom, is a patent
attorney. He is of a decided bruuette com
plexion, rather handsome, aud was always
well dressed. He had been paying his ad
dresses to Miss Willard up to about a year
ago, when he ceased for awhile, but renew
ed his visits last July. Ho was asked
to be one of the ushers for the wed
ding next Tbursdav, but he declined.
Miss Willard recently told Mr. Paxlou
ih it she would marry him iu preference to
the mau she was personally engaged to.
The only question was how and wheu.
While au ardent enough lover, the youug
man seems to have hesitated in taking the
I'm a 1 step. "Will, if you want me you can
have me, but I won't wait for you after the
11th. If you don't want me badly enough
to take me as I am before that time, why
I'll marry Frank." Thus spoke the lady
four days ago. To a faithful friend went
the happy man. The friend entered into
tbe scheme with energy and con
ducted it with rare judgment and skill.
Nothing was suspected, however, as to the
true condition of affairs, and only yesterday
a sister of Mr. Simpson arrived from New
York to assist in the wedding preparations.
Mr. Frank Simpson, tbe groom expectant,
first met Miss Willard abroad about two
years ago and paid her considerable atten
tion, and finally proposed marriage. This
was agreeable to her parents, but the young
lady did not appear to reciprocate the af
fection lavished upon her, although she ap
patently acquiesced in the choice of her
parents. Mr. Simpson has large interests
in the West and has purchased and fitted
up in superb style a residence for himself
aud wife at Kansas City, Mo. He was con
nected with tbe banking firm of Donnell,
Lawson & Simpson, of Wall street, New
York,
' Mr. C. D. Willard, the father of theyoung
lady, is a well-known capitalist, who has
large landed interests in Florida. He
speuds the greater pottion of his time in
Europe, but when in the United States he
makes his home iu Washington.
A Wife Probably Killed.?A tragedy
occurred Monday evening in Middle Village.
Queens county, that will undoubtedly result
in the death of a faithless wife and possibly
of her betrayer. Adolph Stellmacher, a
graveuigger in the Lutheran C'emetary, on
returning from his work, found his wife iu
a compromising situation with a man living
j in the neighborhood. Stellmacher seized a
razor that lay on the window sill of the
room and turned on the guilty pair. The
man rushed for the doop, the woman, awe
struck,9tood speechless and receive] two
awful cuts on the face from the weapon and
then fell shrieking to the floor as the out
raged husband, razor in hand, dashed out on
the avenue after the destroyer of his domes
tic happiness. When last, seen the man and
his infuriated pursuer were in close proxim
ity to each other, hut flying across fields and
over fences.
Meanwhile the cries of the woman had
brought assistance and she was placed in a
wagon and hurriedly driven to Williams
burg, to St. Catherine's Hospital, a distance
of ovfer two miles. Here the house surgeon
found that she was almost dead from loss of
blood from two frightful gashes that ex
tended from her mouth, hack across her
right ear ai.d behind it for an inch or more,
both cuts extending to the bone all the way
and cutting a piece of flesh an inch wide en
tirely out of her cheek, ear and scalp. But
little hopes are entertained of the woman's
recovery. It i9 feared in the neighborhood
that Stellmacher has also killed the man in j
the ease, as neither had been heard of up to !
a late hour last night.?N. Y. Herald.

TBOTH'S GBIEVANCE.
To the editor of the Alexandria Gazelle :
In Tuesday's issue of the "Tri-Weekly
Gazette" appeared an article signed "J. B.
Trotb, Accotink, Ya.," in which he gives a
very distorted aud false accouut of the
democratic demonstration held here Nov.
17th. I would not deign to notice the ell'u
sion of spite and disappointment, if he had
not in an unkind and untruthful manner re
ferred to the ladies at mv house. He said :
"The headquarters of the celebration were
at. the house of a prominent citizen. The
party of ladies and geutlemen that met
sang a song. It was something like this,
'O, we will hang old John Troth, &c., &c.,
on a sour apple tree.' 'There was a num
ber of ladies enaaged in sinking this outrage
oua song.' Amoug them were many ladies
of high stauding in good society," &e.
Now the truth of the matter is this: There
was only one lady at my house during the
evening besides my wife, neither of whom
left the house during the demonstration,
aud neither of whom stiny of, spoke of, nor
1 am quite sure even thoughtof J. B. Troth.
Some half a dozen or more young men did,
during the fifteen or twenty minutes' cessa
tion of the firing caused by the bursting of
the tube of the cannon, march up and down
the street and sing, "We will hang John
Troth and others on u sour apple tree," but
ibis was done only in u spirit of fun and jol
lity, aud Mr. Troth knew this as well as
any one else, therefore his hypoeiitical cant
about the seriousness of the thieat contain
ed in the song was oi.ly equaled by his call
for protection for the white republicans of
Mt. Vernon District.
Mr. Troth also says, '"Had these threats
been made by the rabble out there that
the9^ bigbtoned gemleiueu and ladies were
f:eding on pine top whiskey, we xhould not
thought it so serious a matter," &c. I can
truly say, aud prove by Messrs. (iuillard,
Daingerfield, S. E. Nevitt, Landstreet and
others, who took supper with us that night,
that there was not a drop of intoxicating
liquor offered or drank in ray house or on
my premises on the occasion referred to;
indeed I do not believe there was any liquor
drank in the village. There were some
four or five young inen in the party who
were slightly intoxiea'.ed, but not to a d?
trree to make them ar- all troublesome or
ofl'ensive, and they did their drinking befoie
reaching the village. There was a general
understanding among all concerned in the
demonstration that no oue should be insult
ed or injured in person or property.
It is evident to every thinking man that
the same spirit that animated James G.
Blaino to make his late treasonable and in
cendiary speech in Augusta, prompted John
B. Troth to write the article to which this
is a reply, aud I think all eood citizens
should feel extremely grateful that the
Government, of this country has been wrest
ed from the bands of a party whose head is
represented by James G. Blaiue. of Maine,
and its extreme "caudal appendage" by J.
B. Troth, of Accotink. N. B. Nevitt.

Bail Refused.
William R. Smith, late chief clerk iu the
First. Auditor's office, charged with the em
bezzlement of State funds, had a partial
hearing In the Police Court in Richmond
yesterday. Tbe case was continued until
to-day. Bail was refused, and Smith was
committed to jail.
There were two warrants?one charging
him with unlawfully and feloniously on or
about the 14th of April, 1SS3, embezzling
and feloniously converting to bi.s own use a
sum of $62 U2,*the money and property of
she Commonwealth of Virginia. The other
uairant charged him with unlawfully and
feloniously, ou or about December l->, 1883,
embezzling and feloniously converting tu
his own use the sum of ?1,552 S7, the money
and property of the Common wealth of Vir
ginia. Major Poe swore out the warrants
upon the strength of letters from certain
clerks of courts. These letters showed that
ihe amounts had been receipted for by .Mr.
W. R. Smith, and there was no credit for
the same on the books in tbf Auditor's of
fice.
Mr. Smith, in company with several
friends, and under the custody of an officer
came down from the Auditor's office, enter
ed tbe court room, and took a seat iu the
bar by Judge Crump. The Judge asked the
court to hear testimony as to bail.
The testimony of the Auditor revealed
tbe fact of the discovery hy Mr. Smith yes
terday morning among the papers which he
had charge of a certified check for the
$1,552.87. This? check was shown in court,
and was dated December 13,1883. It was
made payable to the Treasurer. As to the
?152.32, of it was accounted fur, and
Judge Crump in this connection said that
he had no doubt, but that tbe balance could
easily be accounted for.
The police justice, however, said he did
not think it was a proper case for bail. He
did not give his reasons.
The Dispatch of to-flay says : "Too cer
tified check for $1,592, which Mr. Smith
has fount!, and which covers the amount iu
question in the Petersburg case, was drawn
by Mr. Armistead,December 13,1883.on the
Planters and Mechanics' Bank, which bank
suspended the past summer. Mr. Smith,
after its suspension, opened a correspon
dence with Mr. Armistead with the view of
having the latter prove this claim against
the hank on behalf of the Commonwealth,
and Armistead had taken steps in that
direction, but Mr. Matye said yesterday
1 hat this proceeding was wholly unauthor
ized. The check was not made payable to
the Auditor, but to the Treasurer. There
is a question as to whether or no the claim
tbe State had against Mr. Armistead is t .us
lischarged."
The Virginia Electoral College.?
The Electoral College of Virginia met yes
terday at 12 o'clock in the office of the Sec
relary of the Commonwealth, at Richmond.
All of the electors were present. Judge
Waller R. Staples called the meeting to
order. Hon. John Gnode, of the Second
district, was unanimously elected chair
man. Air. John Bell Bigger was unani
mously elected secretary. The electors then
took the oath of office, which was admin
istered by the Secretary of the Common
wealth. The twelve votes were cast for
(?rover Cleveland,of New York .and Thomas
A. Hendricks, of Indiana, as President and
vice-President respectively of the United
States of America. Mr. Bicrger was elected
messenger to take the certificate of the vote
to Washington.
Butler Makes a Discovery.?Gcd. B. F. But
ler has recently rctnrncd to Mr. John S.Wise,
of Virginia, an old drinking rap of historical as
well as intrinsic value, made from {he timber of the
famous <>)d frigate Constitution, and which was
presented to Hon. Henry A. Wise by Commodore
Percival in 1947. The cup fell into the hands of
Fedgral troops during the war, but how it came 1
into General Butler's possession is not satisfacto- <
rily explained. The (ieneral says ho accidentally
discovered it last winter in a lot of old rubbish 1
in one of the rooms of his house in Massachusetts, <
and lie has no idea bow it got there. The cup is
mounted with silver and may have been attracted
into General Butler's vicinity by the magnetism 1
of spoons. Now that the cup has been di-eovered j
iu th" garret, perhaps the spoons may be unex
pectedly found in the cellar. j t
