Mankind Playing Safe,

i
Ing nothing. playing safe. America
must put and w:ll no! yield to this con
dition. Instead, she must he the posi
tive Nation. She will Ami she will,
I tun sure, lie positively itfood. A nega
tive nation seeking eomtantly f?r evil
even thou it h if Veekn that it may pun
ish. If it is not ready to supplant with
the positive Rood, cannot and will not
iiltimtdi in the end. We must inculcate
into our peopie the homely virtues on
which civilization rests. We must
'i ; c,| lo.irti it.at ;i virtuous neople

that law forced from without can never
take the place of character. Strong as
this government is- It Is not strong
i !ioijup to last unless the American citi
zen is taught f tends he made?to re
spect authority atol revere the law. That
is. civilization rests upon the law. and
law upon i Iv i'ization: and when this
fn-'t is aooro'-iated and observed, then
?o man will he above the law, and the
law will reign overall.
"In the great field of the enforcement
of tie Invv our illflbu.Mr s are Incredible.
'Ih" criminal classes are nor only inso
lently hold, hut our hitherto Inw-ahld
Inir citirann find it convenient to forger
the law. This is true particularly of
the prohibit ion 'aw and Its enforcement.
Unt it ' ? ih- will of the majority oper
"ting thfoi'e'i congress The diftlciil
tics ??->??? 11tit? red In tlie enforcement ol
this law are due possible to the fact
that i; was passed before public opin
ion i:i many localities was ready to
support It. Ml historv shows that any
n?w law which Interferes with the so
called persoaal liberty of the conimun
Itv must puss through tiie stages of
open violation, secrc violation, passive
enfor- i inetit. nnd then universal ob
servance throughout Die land. Prohibi
tion is not the nnlv law which Is diffl
< ulf to enforce, for. as everyone knows,
we are today In .v perh ,j of disrespect
for law and order. Thts Is to he ex
pected as the reaction from (he groat
. .mrlllres during the world war.
Law Set at Naught.
Iii-[i]nrab!e. nut true. I?i our cities. In
our states, yet. In the federal Rftvi'm

uphold the honor of their country and
preserve its ??oustitutlon. who have. who
are. anil who will continue to subvert
tehir nation's causa to their own per
sonal prosperity. Others there arc who.
he.-at!so .if political hon.>r or personal
friendship, or perhaps stronger itiflti
ciices. will allow illegal practices to he
perpetrated, nnd the law to ho set at
naught. The law is not made for u cer
tain few. It is not enacted {n he enforced
iwrainwt stone, and vacated against
others. It is a beacon for nil. for 'he
poor, for the rich, for the .lew end for
the (lection fur the white and for the
hla-k. and for the high and the low. It
chooses none and rejects none It stands
proclaiming to .the world "Tliou shalt
rot break." ami when that command
ment Is broken the nation should bend
Its efforts to see that atonement Is
made, rfo matter who may he the offen
der. tio matter how high his rank, or
how low his station.
"We can say with prhle. and T repeat
't with hope, that the peak of lawless

otir national institutions left intact
And why? Jtecausc we had and have to

COUNCIL REFUSES
(Continued from Pag? One.)
supreme court in mandamus proceed
Iuks against City Clerk If. C. I.ane. re
? I'liiing him t,. show cause why he has
not certified the recall petition* a? In
sult dent, and If the city would he held
in ? ontempt or libel for such notion.
Mtoruey Ttrennnn. iti reply, stated
that council had not nuthcritv In tlm
? ??att-r as ye;, and that It was vested in
the city clerk lie said l.e would advise
?vailing; that he would advise I'it.v
i 'Jerk 1.11 ne 11 stand on his rights; that
the matter was now in court, nnd he
was not gojiuj |? attempt to try tiie
? as,, in council, hut that "common sense
v.ould lend n person io reject the re
call petitions as insuff'dentthat he
would riot fur or.-? moment advise the
city clerk to rrje-t petitions where lie
Knew the court would not pronounce
1 thetn good. Ho said he never saw a
' s?*t of papers put together like the re
call petitions. "There are two shies to
' tins, ami our s!<U we nre not telling as
' yet." he Mat oil.
At this point Mayor Thomas F. Tho*
1 tier stated that the question was not
! debatable, inasmuch ns there was no
! motion on the resolution. Captain Otte
I then moved that the resolution he
'adopti-.l Councilman Morgan seconded
j the motion. It was at this point that
. a g-neral discussion and arguments fol
lowed among the members.
Councilman Camden S. Taney stated
, that he felt the same as City Solicitor
Brennan. and that it was up to the city
clerk, and inasmuch as ho ruled the
petitions insufficient the matter ought
' to he dropped In council.
Councilman James 11. Beans then took
the floor. "This is the duty of the city
1 clerk and not of council." lie said.
"Council has not. authority or right to
' instruct the city clerk In this matter
or command him to do anything in re
gard to the recall petition?. I move
| you. Mr. Chairman, the matter be laid
1 on the table."
Otto Takes Exception.
Captain Otto took exception to this
motion after Dr. 11. S 1'ippus seconded
| Beans' motion, and said lie had a right
to give 1,1s reasons. Mayor Thoner
stated that under council rules a mo
! tion before the house to lay the resolu
tion on the table was not debatable. On
j roll call the following voted against
* the laying of the resolution on the
; table: Kress, Morgan, otto and Thoner.
j Thoso voting to lay the resolution on
the table were: Beans, Dippus. Cunning
! ham. Taney. Thompson and Vance.
* 'unningiuiin explained his vote by
j saying that he had the utmost confi
dence" in Attorney Brennan. while the
| same explanation was made by Thomp
son, Otto explained his vote by say
i ing that lie did not cast any reflections
' upon any person, but that council has
! a right to see these petitions.
Another Heated Argument.
When a resolution by Attorney -T.
! Harold Brennun asking permission to
employ stenographers and legal adxis
| ers to assist '.n preparing the city clerk's
answer to the supreme court of appeals.
| another heated debate followed among
; the members of coiinc!'.
i i'outicilmnn Otto asked if Mr. Brennan
had any idea as to what amount of
money it would take to employ this
additional help. Mr. Brennan replied
hv stating that he did not know, but
that lie had not as yet received, nor had
the city clerk, the original writ He said
j he had received a copy of the petition
I as presented to the supreme court of
appeals, but understood the writ was
much broader and that the earliest he
I eotiM see the writ would lie if it ar
> rived tomorrow morning This, lie said,
would give hini little time to prepare
for Saturday.
Kress then stated he did not 'see why
it would he necessary to employ addi
tional legal ndvice. inasmuch as Attor
ney* J. .1. I'. O'Brien had been re-appoint
e,l city solicitor, and that the two of
them could give their time In preparing
to arme-ir before the supreme court. Ho
stated he bad no objection to employ
ing stenographers to help
Attorney Brennan stated that there
f vrere' two petitions mat were n?p/*
' and complexed matters. Beans than
! took the floor and stated he wae wllllBS
! to give Attorney Brennan all the
sistance he wanted; that the people - >j
I lilnrl the recall had plenty of monej?a?d v
I that he believed council should protec^
themselves and their names as far as
1 possible against the desperate pushers
i of the recall. Cunningham stated he
thought It better for Attorney Brennau
to have twenty-five attorneys and not
need one than to have one attorney aad
I need more.
Taxpayers Hare Bights.'
' Captain Otto, then taking the floor,
stated: "I'll agree that we should pro
tect our good names, but the taxpayers
1 have something to say about the spend
; ing of this money to fight the recall i
petitions. 1 don't believe in giving any
i p Tsuii unlimited authority to employ ,
. who they wish from the taxpayer*' A.
. maney." *'
| Kress again took the floor and stated
. lie would not vote for any resolution
that would allow any one person to
spend the city's money as he sees fit:
that Attorney Brennan could not esti
mate what amount of money It would
take or how many attorneys it would
be necessary to employ. Attorney
Brennan interrupted by saying that the
recall petitioners had not less than
seven attorneys. Kress followed by
saying that they were not spending the
city's money, but that such action. In
council as is contemplated would be ths
city's money. Dr. Bippus then broke it
by asking for'a question on the motion.
Kress replied, facing Dr. Bippus. that
the question before them was a serious
one. inasmuch as a considerable amount f
of money may be spent. Dr. Bippus re- *
plied that it would he better- to spend
Jfi.DOO for attorneys to appear before the
; supreme court of appeals against the
recall petitions than to spend that I
amount for a new election. At this point
Mayor Thoner called both to order.
Kress then stated he would vote for*
resolution giving Attorney Brennan the
right to employ stenographers, .and If
Attorney Brennan would not ask fof
more than one additional attorney. At
torney Brennan stated he would assure
him that there would not be more thai
one additional attorney to assist him
After considerable more discussion
the resolution was amended whereby
Attorney Brennan would not employ
more titan one attorney to assist. On
roll call, all voted for the resolution
with the excep^on of Captain Otto. *?
