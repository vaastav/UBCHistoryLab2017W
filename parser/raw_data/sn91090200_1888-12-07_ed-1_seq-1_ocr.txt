TH AT FAMOUS MESSAC.E.
How it Came to be Sent to Consrfss.
Wa-shinston Cor. New York World.
Washington, Nov. 29. The insida his
tory of the tariff-reduction messag-3 sent
to Congt'Ota by the President last Decem
ber has not yet been written a.nd it is of
some mierwt. Indeed, in view of the do
ft of Mr. Cleveland and of the opinion
of a large number of prtOB, right or
wrong, that the result was due to the tar
iff message, it is desirable that the people
should be informed of all the circum
stances connected with that new departure
of the administration.
President Cleveland is the putative fath
er of the child, but the real author of its
being is Mr. Mantor. Marble. For twenty
years Mr. Marble has been eager to force
tariff reform into politics as a distinctive
Ksue. He devoted much time to the task
of briDging the President round to his
views of the political revolution, which
would sweep over the Western States if
the Democracy only had the courage and
sense to make a bold fight on the tariff is
sue; not through a meaningless plank in a
convention platform, but through aggres
sive action on the part of the President,
who would unquestionably be the candi
date of the party for re-election and would
thus compel the recognition of the issue
in the contest. Mr. Marble pointed out
the position held on the question by Wes
tern newspapers and Western politicians,
and quoted the World a3 favoring tariff
revisions and tax reduction so earnestly
as to urge a special session of Congress for
the consideration of that important policy.
Mr. Cleveland was not entirely convinc
ed by Mr. Marble's arguments, but was
diposed to believe that they had some
strength and well deserved consideration.
Mr. Marble found an effective ally in Mr.
Henry Watterson, who supplemented the
appeal of his friend in his own impulsive
and impetuous mannei . Meanwhile mem
bers of the Cabinet were approached and
urged to favor the proposition of a Presi
dential message, stripped bare of all out
side adornments, and placed before Con
gress and the country as a naked tariff
revision proposition from the considera
tion of which neither party, nor any indi
vidual of either party, could escape. In
a short time afterwards, Mr. Marble laid
before the President his draft of a message
such as he advised. This wa the origin
of the nv.tch-disensMed documents, v hieh,
in the opinion of many persons, si ttled
the ! 'resident 5 al coc t e? t. As transmitted
to Congress there were some changes from
-Jr. Marb'.s coupc-si' iou, but the main
fe-tnies Wci-e preserved and in some of
the idi.-mat's expressions the ex-editor's
style can be easily recognized.
V 'nlw t'ltse d'scussions we re going on
Sec-etary Whitney wa indisposed and
absent fvom 'athirigton. Ov his return
to the e-.piol shoit'y Ufore the assem
bling cf Congress, he received a letter from
the President, who expressed a desire to
fee him. as soon as possible. Secretary
Whitney called at the White House, and,
in a private interview Mr. Cleveland, sub
mitted to liini the draft of his proposed
m.'ssige, which was then prepared. The
revelation was a surprise and a shock to
the Secretary, whose keen perception and
accurate political information ;:t once sug
gested to him that, however wi.-e and
commendable the propositions advanced
might be in the abstract, it was not the
right tim.; to cast them upon the country,
lie frankly expressed these views to the
President as the first impression made on
his mind by the message. Mr. Cleveland
was evidently considerably surprised and
disappointed at the position taken by the
Secretary, lie told Mr. Whitney that the
message had already been disenssed by
the Cabinet, and that his remark? were
the first hostile expressions he had heard
in resrard to it. He desired that the Secre
tary would take a little time to retlect on
the matter nnd see if he could not find
reasons to warrant a change in the views
he then expressed.
At this interview Mr. Whitney at once
discovered and pointed out to the Presi
dent one important in.-tance to which the
alleged facts advanced were not correct,
and the reasoning built upon them was
fallacious and open to -tractive criti
cism. The President was surprised at the
information and made a uote of it for in
quiry. Mr. Whitney was found to !e rh;ht
and the message was modified according
ly. The Cabinet was then called together
in'a special meeting, at which the message
was again considered. Mr. Whitney and
all the memlers being present. The dis
cussion which ensued was warm and pro
longed. Reflection seem "d only to h ive
corrmed Mr. Whitney's view s of the in
expediency of the policy, and when he
spok? he expresse." his opposition in no
uncertain terms
injudicious to gl
sue such as hey

lie believed it was most
the Republicans an is
v - de-'ired, and wliich
- tried i
false1 v for' e
vLen thev were search
ing anxiously, and up to that time vainly,
for a var cry. lie ir -i-ted that the merits
ard j'isti' rf the polky recommended in
the message had no pan in the discussion;
that the real point was whether it was ju
dicious to urge the policy on the eve of
the Presidential election, w heu there would
not be time enough at commaud of the
party to combat prejudice, to overthrow
false charges, and to educate the minds of
the working people up to an understand
ing of their true interests. Mr. Whitney
insisted that without this direct issue in
the approaching canvass the opposition
would have nothing to do but to make a
fisht by attacks on the general policy and
character of the administration, and on
this there could be no quest iou of their de
feat. The result would be the vindication
of the administration, audits pntrioelsm
and integrity would become historical
through the discussions on the canvass.
Mr. Whitney tnged the policy of first win
ning the battle and then securing the
forms and relief sought during the four
years of the next i-sue.
Ihe oher members of the Cabinet op-p..sc-il
Mr. Whitney's position aud urged
the expediency of the message at that
time. But it was reserved for Mr. Vilas
to assail Mr Whitney's views ith a force
which encroached on the limits of courtesy.
The flowery orator from Wisconsin talked
flippantly about the objectionable charac
ter of cowardice in politics, and accused
his colleay .e of a want of manliness in his
tenp rizing and ''expediency" policy. Irr
his calm reply Mr. Whitney remarked that
he had never hard that prudence in plan
ning a campaign was a mard of cowardice
or recklessness and bravado indications of
courasre. He had heard it somewhere said
that discretion is the better part of valor,
and certainly it was n n evidence eith
er of discretion or common sense to cast
down your fortifications, and open a clear
path for the enemy into the heart of the
citadel just before a battle for existence.
Mr. Whitney was left alone, however, in
his condemnation of the message as ill-
timed, inexpedient and full of danger for
the party.
It was determined that the message
should be sent to Congress. Put on the
night of the Cabinet meeting, Mr. Cleve
land was in consultation with his Private
Secretary until two o'clock in the morn
ing. He was greatly disturbed by the
position Mr. Whitney had taken, haviog
always regarded him as the shrewdest
political adviser, and the best equipped
statesman in the Cabinet. Finally he
threw the message from him in an irrita
ble outburst aud declared that it was too
late to retreat. The message was sent in.
It did not enable Mr. "Vilas or Mr. Endi
cott t decrease the Republican majorities
in their States. It lost New York to Mr.
C.eveland despite Secretary Fairchild's
confident predictions to the contrary.
No one believes that Mr. Manning, al
though like Mr. Whitney an honest friend
of tariff reform and tax reduction, would
have endorsed the policy of the President's
message as the opening gun of the cam
paign. The speedy return fire opened by
Mr. Blaine from the other side of the
ocean is said to have been the first eye
opener the President got to enable him to
see the wisdom of Mr. Whitney's position.
CONSOLATORY.
11EV. THOMAS DIXON POURS OUT

't soMncli ot a Cnlamitv - fter All.

Special Cor. Static Chkoniclk.
Boston, Mass., Nov. 30. Allow me to
oifer a few words of consolation to my
afflicted brethren of North Carolina and
the South especially to those who felt
that the very salvation of the earth de
pended on the continuance of Mr. Cleve
land in power. From the bottom of my
heart, brethren, 1 am sorry for you when
I think of the probability of a clean sweep
in the Federal offices of the South aud an
other four years of insolent domination by
men who hate you and all you represent,
w.' ieh means the sum total of the wealth,
virtue and intelligence of Uie community.
Of course there were some clean, hor.ei-t,
capable men who held office under Repub
lican Administration men who wre gen
tlemen men who were polite and atten
tive to the public and 'faithful to their
trusts, but it need not be said they were
the exception rather than the rule. But
after all Mr. Harrison is a man of rather
solid make-up and I am inclined to thins
will do as much, or more for Civil Service
Reform than did Mr. Cleveland there
may may not Imj a clean sweep after all.
It is certain that Harrison is a man who will
enter office singularly free from promises
and bargains, and he may take the bit in
his mouth and be a President after his
own notiou. Any how we can a -a ait the
result. Yon may lose the offices, you may
not. If you do it will be the greatest loss
you will suffer by the change of Adminis
tration, and after all, that will not be an
overwhelming one. What other loss wili
you suffer? Mr. Cleveland has made a
fairly good President but he did not rep
resent the better element of the National
Democratic party he couldn't and come
from a State north of Mason and Dixon's
line. No rne in his party could do any
thing much about his defeat personally
he is a man of no magnetic qualities but
rather repulsive than otherwise. He ap
pointed negroes to office about as freely as
did his predecessors so on that score he
did not differ materially from them.
But how about the tariff? The Repub
licans succeeded in fooling enough peo
ple on this question in New York State in
the interior to carry it. They raised, the
cry of tree trade and frightened a few
fools, and now th-y will turn around and
do themselves what the Democrats tried
to do and died in the effort, that is. re
vise the present tariff, reducing it a'oout
sixty-live or seventy millions. The duty
on rice aud sucar may be cut j retty se
verely, but I ilon't see any reason why
they should not be cut, do you? They ate
among the simplest necessities of life.
The Republican Aomini-tration will not
dare to inaugurate a bull dozing policy to
ward the South, and all the talk in that
direction is the rapid declaimation of ad
dled partisans. On the other hand it will
lx? 'he policy of Mr. HarrisoD to count to
the influence of the South for Republican
ism. Then will just as many credulous
people up here, who believed tht the elec
tion of Cleveland meant the ruin of the
country, as there were iu the South who
believed the contrary.
The news of Harrison's election set this
part of our great Republic wild with re
joicing the demonstrations were long,
continued and extensive. It was not a
feeling of sectional triumph either, I do
not think. Men are apt to judsre ,t party
by the examples they see about them
Men here judge Democracy by the Jim
mys, the Mikes, the Johnnies, t he McCroo
trans, the McFaddins and the Gilhoobes
who rise from the slums of our cities and
are monarehs of all they survey. The
triumph of R- publican i.-m means the down
fall of this element of loud smell, and
hence the crn-sit mass of t he decent would
rejoice. With you, the contrary is true.

the ascending of the lower element and!.
hence vou are sad. bet me can to v
minds, my (ear brethren, the fact that
sooner or later this good element of the
North will unite with the good element of
the South, and may spend that day! in
the North the Roman Catholic church is
the power behind the throne of the I'
mocracy (Mr. Cleveland knew this when
he sent his present to the Pope). The
Romish church is the deadliest enemy of
the free school to-day in America- !; r
priests have sworn to destroy it they
have thousands on thousands of' parachia!
schools already built and are fighting for
a division of the school funds. The elec
tion of Harrison meant a set back to Ro
manism hence another cause of rejoicing
of good people up here It is no use to
try to disguise the fact the mass of the
Northern Democracy means the unassimi
lated unamericanized foreign element as
yet a construct threat to the very life of
Government itself. With this frightful
rabble, my brethren, you have nothing iu
common except that you have voted the
same National ticket. They are generally
letl by a set of low bar-keepers and bribe
takers who do not hesitate to sell out to
tho highest bidder when it suits their pur
pose, see for instance, to elect Grant.
Mayor, they sold out Cleveland in the Inst
election.
There is to my mind but one great issue
in National politics worthy of the name,
and that is the death of the saloon! May
God hasten the day when the North and
South will join hand, ami rid the country
of this dire curse! Fisk has polled about
:-50t0G'O votes and this issue will be a hot
one. for the next four years. More at an
other time.

The friends of Capt. Swift Galloway, of
Wayne, desire for him the position of
Reading Clerk of the House. He has
abundant voice and would till the position
admirably. He was "as brave as the brav
est that donned the gray," and he suffers
to-day from the wounds he received in the
late war. I venture the assertion that
N'orth Carolina sent no more gallant son
to the front and none who suffered more
for the cause he so earnestly espoused.
His services to the Democratic party have
been unremitting and arduous. He is as
good a Democrat in peace as he was a sol
dier in war.
He is eminently qualified for the posi
tion and, we trust, the members of the
House will elect him unanimously.

The contemplated meeting of disabled
and indigent veterans in Raleigh on Jan
uary S2ud, ISsO, for the purpose of asking
additional pension legislation in their be
half, does not impress me as being either
prudent or v. i.-e,and it is to be hoped that
instead of a general meeting there will U;
county meetings held all over the State and
through them, iiv petitions, thus condi
tions rind necessities of these noble and
worthy claimants will be forwarded to
their members of the Legislature and, by
them, j: resen led for the consideration of
that body. This course would prove just
as effective and far less expensive. Many
veterans of the North Carolina Troops,
who are disabled and indigent, are, ua-que-tioa;;bie.
sadly iu need of assistance,
and to the full extent of the Slate's ability
they should be assisted, but to get proper
recognition and wanted assistance they
should proceed in a way that will impress
the thinking people of the state that it is
aid they want in their distress. Would
the expenditure of the amount they and
their friends will have to pay out for" x
penses to and from Raleigh and for their
entertainment while there bean evidence
of proper economical desire on their part?
On the contrary would it not have a ten
dency to show that they would be seeking
to do by display or force what their meri
torious services and needy conditions de
mand iu the name rf everything that is
good and glorious should be done for them
ou the broad and positive ground of justice.
In the Legislature of the State these
long neglected, and more than patient suf
ferers, will have several comrades and,
though justice has failed, so far, to hear
the cries of want that have been uttered
by the indigent heroes of the State, I be
lieve the day has come when the voices of
these veteran legNlators will not only be
boldly n.iscd in behalf of their indigent
comrades, bi t nobly sustained by then -re-enfatives

We know of a 1,000 government bond

much gold for fl.000 of greenbacks and
converting the greenbacks into the bond

For ten yea is this bond bore G per cent,

For fourteen years it bore 4 percent, in

It has never paid a cent of tax.
Last week this identical bond was

Here is more than six dollars for one!
We know an old soldier who served in

It is twenty three years since he came

He has paid back to the government $71

the designer of one of the 8,( 00 ton crui

There is cumulative evidence that President-elect
Harrison has tendered the State
portfolio to Senator Sherman. In offer
ing the chief cabinet position to his chi.-f
competitor in the National Convention,
Gen. Harrison follows the example set by
Lincoln, and it happens that, as iu the
case ejf Linco'n's appointment cf Se vard,
Gen. Harrison will recoii, if Senator
Shei man shall accept ihe id. J r cretary
of State. There ir n irr.pressiou stbrorui,
however, that Senator Sherman wi 1 not
accept a Cabinet position until hehasdefi
nite assurances as to who will succeed to
his vacant chair in the Senate. The :-en

President Cleveland is at last enjoying
a rest from the persistence of the office
seekers. His mail has fallen tiff largely
since the elect ion, the number of his callers
has decreased, and people t-eetn to be los

ever, have not deserted him as - his mor
ceau from a contemporary proves:
"The campaign, Dan, was not in vain,
Our tariff agitation
Has been a school where all ndirlit gain
A needed education.''
"I know it, sire, like country schools
I've known in this one teature.

Rose up and bounced the teacher."
"How are you, Joe," and "Hello Julius,"
were the exclamations with which two

each other upon meeting at the Capitol

candidacy of these two gentlemen, both
refused to say anything about the Speak

too early to talk about that matter now.
Representative McKinley arrived last

of that body to carefully con
b
; -idcr his eminent, qualifications, aud pe
1 culiar fitness for the place,
i Mr. Harrington was a member of the
! Legislature ot 1SS7, and impressed himself
as a careful, conservative, painstaking
: member, who seemed to be ever watchful
:' the public iutt rest, and especially that
i of the constituency which he was then
i representing. His habits of ouict indus-

j meoibers of that bodv.

liked Tom Haningtou
and
sought his e-ompany, ami at the closing
days of the session he was the hero of the
hour by his authorship of the "farewell"
of the members done up in excellent
rhyme and directed to ' Sally Ann." (Do
the members of 1837 recollect Sally Aun?)
But beyond all this, aud above all this, he
I.- thoroughly qualified and competent for
the delicate duties of Engrossing Clerk of
theHou.se This position requires an in
dustrious, accommodating, obliging, and
painstaking man; one who will devote his
whole ti i.e and attention to its duties and
not en; rust th m to hired and,perhaps,ir
responsible elp. Tins woik must be done
under the eye of a man who has had leg
islative experience and knows what is re
quired, and who will himself see to ii that
the important work ofjrs office is properly
and accurately done. No mistakts can
be tolerated.
Such a man is Thomas W. Harrington,
wdiom I nominate as a suitable candidate
for the position, and while there may be
others equally competent, 1 assert without
fear of successful contradiction, that no
one can be found more competent than
the candidate I have named.
Gentlemen of the next House, make no
mistake in the selcctio o of Engrossing
Clerk, and take my word for it, that you
will make none, if you select Thomas W.
Harrington, of Harnett.

Shelby, Col , Nov. :0. Driving across

a'oout dusk a little fellow some twelve
years old leading a diminutive burro.
Scarcely more than the long ears of the
animal were visabh- from under the M-'xi-can

had come sevtr-ty miies across the plain
and had passed the two previous nights
without shelter. It had turned very cold
aud the little fellow was evidently saft'er-

burro too if he could tie the be.. -t le 1
drove a. lead w hil'i hetnourted and follow

churned his property.

grasped by the miiul. But stand iu the
midst of an arid plain where the eye seeks
in vain a green leaf, a human habitation,
or a moving dot of life, and itleal vastness
is realized. The voice, if uttered, goes off
like a ghost into the waste air. The sound
of a rifle shot stems far away, unreal.
Away, away, towards the .-l.-ar cut hue of

But see! A wide lake appears and the
clear waier throws back ihe shadow of

but there is none, for it is only a mirage
only a strip of sky sec in a crooked way,
seen on cold days a- well as hot. bu1 doubly

Soon they ta:k to themselves and hear
strange voices; the see shapes stalking
among the cattle and gathering on the
plain. Then comes madness and suicide.
But there is scarcely a p.fiut in Colorado
where the desolation of the plains is not
relieved by a sitrht of mountain peaks
Two hurdred miles to the eastward they
