SENATOR HARRISON HEAPS
CRITICISM ON PRESIDENT
Declares Mr. Harding Is Doing
"Very Things for Which' He
Denounced Wilson."
Criticism was heaped on President
Harding and other leaders of the re
publican party in the Senate yester
day by Senator Harrison, democrat,
of Mississippi. He asserted that tlie
President was doing the "very tnmgfc
for which he as a senator had ae- ;
nounced President Wilson.' j
The President's message to ( on- J
gress, he said, constituted an appeal j
to partisanship and a warning to re- ,
publicans to disavow their allegiance
to "bloc" organization.
Mr. Harrison attacked the Senate
republican leaders, saying they had
"shifted and hopped until none of us
know where or when or why." i
Continuing, he said he was confident j
there had been a misprint in tn? j
President's message where Mr. Hard
ing had expressed appreciation of the .
"signal achievements" of the extra}
session. What the President meant,
he added, was. probably -single
achievement, for otherwise the mes
sage appeared "most contradictory
and conflicting." .
The action of the House in fixing a
50 per cent surtax rate in the revenue
bill, he declared, constituted a "plain
repudiation" of the executive s stand.
It was apparent, he added, that the
House action had "riled the President
considerably."
"But I insist, he said, that the
progressives in the House had cour
age and they told the President where
to get off." .
Secretary Mellon also was de
nounced as seeking. Tn his annual re
port of the Treasury Department, to
"help along" the ideas of President
Harding with respect "to relieving
the rich" of heavy taxation.
When Mr. Wilson opposed or urged
legislation. Mr. Harrison continued,
the then Senator Harding described
him as a "dictator and an autocrat,
and when Mr. Wilson issued his ap
peal in 181S for the election of a
democratic Congress Mr. Harding was
eaually bitter in his denouncement. |
"Yet we have the spectacle, he ?
said "of the President coming here
and'making a speech against the sol
dier bonus, a thing unprecedented.
Then, yesterday, he came here and ap
pealed" to the agricultural Rroup to
line up, to get behind the party ban
ner."
THREE ARMED mIn ROB.
Three voung colored men. one wearing
a mask and the others armed with pis
fois robbed Myer ShuKin at his grocery
store, at 900 Barry place, Jast nig.it
about 9 o'clock. A demand for the
grocer's cash was followed by taking
^out $10 from his i>ockets and about
,3Shukta offered no resistance. He was
able to furnish descriptions of the thiee
men.
Good Looks Depend
on Comfortv j
Did you evei/stop to think how
vour looks and your personality can
be affected by a pair of shoes?
Badly shaped shoes cause a nerv
ous tension which may mar the tace,
little by littje, with'wrinkles, and
make the muscles sag around the
mouth.
The annoying, nagging effect of
shoes which do not harmonize with
your feet makes your facial expres
sion less attractive than it could be
if "your feet were off your mind.
Very high heels sometimes bring
serious injury on the internal organs
because the body is tilted forward
out of natural balance and an un
natural strain results. This causes
much unhappiness and loss of looks.
Wear Cantilever Shoes and let
their comfort give to the lace a
happv expression, to the disposi
tion a pleasantness which men ad
mire, to the physique a strengthen
ing tonic which exercise develops
Cantilevers are good-looking shoes
too.
