tot many yean paat a great deal lias been written
In tbe newspapers ant) a great deal lias been said by
our lawmakers concerning the ravages which tbe
Social Eril is making in tbe metropolis, the horrors
It entalis upon tbe community wblch tolerates its
existence and tbe tendency It has to add to tbe in
crease of tbe worst crimes annually paraded on the
criminal calendar. It has been tune and again de
nounced in the pulpit as a something too frightful
?in ltoelf to contemplate, even for tbe sate of
axclting the autlpatby of the virtuous against it; as
,4he great canker of our metropolitan society, which
4a slowly eating Into its very vitals; as a monster

?toanefui results. But notwithstanding the combined
^influence of the pulpit and the press tnus brought to
?fcear upon the question as to the best way of getting
arid of tha evil, tt was but two yeurs
ago that tbe first practical step was taken
in this city to win from their lives of shame
Abe unfortunate persons whom circumstinces had
Abrown into tbe revolting business of prostitution.
Indeed it has ever been found a very easy tUlug to
denounce prostitution and to call down tlio ven
geance of Heaven upon tbe heads of those who
?ncourage it directly or indirectly, but it has also
"been fonnd that neither the finely rounded periods
?f tbe eloquent dlviues, composed for the delectation
of "respectable" congregations, nor the savage
editorials of virtuous editors on the subject nave
?ver served the purpose of converting a single way
ward sister from n er sad life or uf making her look
?tack upon ber innocent chlidhodd with the slightest
leellng of regret. Experience teaches, however,
and those who have at heart the welfare of the poor
girls, between whom and society there seems?aud
?only seems?to be an impassable gulf, finally
became convinced that denunciation of what
.could not be helped had no other eirect
than to harden tbe frail ones against their
well wishers and to regard them as so many tor
mentors, who desired If possible to make their lives
more miserable. They perceived, did these good
people, that to do battle successfully with the dread
iorror It was necessary to figlit it on the "compro
mise" plan?not only to so address themselves to the
(better feelings of the fallen women us to cause them
to repent of their past lives, but also to extend to
them a helping hand, to place them In such a posi
tion as would absolutely prevent their being obliged
aver to return to their formor calling to eurn their
dally bread; and above all to hold out to them the
tiope that society Is not a Harden of Eden out of
?which they were driven by au inevitable fata, and
the entrance to which, defeudod by an angel, not
a flaming sword, is lorevermore shut against them.
One of the first practical methoUB instituted for the
reformation of these lailen ones in this city was
TH0 MIDNIGHT MISSION.
This society had Its origin In an Informal con ver
nation lieln on the 1st of November, 18UU, between
the Rev. 8. It. Hllliard, chaplain or St. Barnabas mis
sion, and Mr. Qustavus a tern, now a missioning of
the Diocesan Board of the American Church Mission
ary Society. Mr. Stern had then just arrived from
PSngltuul, where he had bad an opportunity of ob
serving the operation of a mission among fallen
?women. Inaugurated ten years before, in London by
tt. Black more, lieuteuaui in the ro\ul n ivy, and since
Krosecuted with remarkable success by the London
lldnlght meeting movement. The subject was not
fiew to tne missionary's mind. it had eugaued in
bougbts for some time, ana he bad al
ready bad some personal experience in the
work. Ills interest, however, being newiy
awakened, and his zeal rekindled by
this conversation, be broucht the subject before the
members or the St. Harnabus MbslonaV Associa
tion, at one of it* regular meetings, ior their con
sideration. At this meetlug ho rehearsed Mr.
Stern's account of the methods and results 01 the
London work, and also read to the association some
sxtractr .oui the biography of Lleutcuunt Black
more.
Inspired by this favorable presentation of tne sub
ject two members of the association?Mr. Daniel
auntlnglou and Mr. I'btllp B. llcniy?at onco came
forward and offered to co-operate with Mr. Milliard
4n Inaugurating a similar effort In New York, o.v
ftin?an? 0| the distributiou of religious tracts and
.direct personal appeals to this c.ass of women in
bur streets, other gentlemen soou came to their
aid, and on the 2uth or January, 1867, the
?abject was brought belore tue Christian pub
lic through printed circulars, rend and distributed in
weveral of the churches, on tlio evening of the
Name day the Rev. Dr. Peters, rector of St. Michael's
church, New York, preached In Trinity chapel, be
lore the Protestant Episcopal city Mission Society,
a memorial sermon of tbe late Mrs. Richmond, who,
to all ber mauy worits aud labors of love auded self
sacrificing efforts in behair or fallen women. At
tbe close or the sermon a collection was taken,
which was appropriated to the new enterprise. At
a public meeting held in benali' ot the mission !u
the Trinllv chapel ou the 21st of January following
new members were added to the society aud several
ladies volunteered their services as coworkers in the
good cause. Being thus encouraged by oulcial sanc
tion Slid public approval and stimulated by pecu
niary contributions, another step was taken. Rooms
were hired for three months, on the corner ot
t welfth street aid Broadway, and comfortably lur
Ulshed.
TIH FIRST "RHCEITION"
was held on the 1st of February, printed cards of
invitation having been distributed by tliamcmbers,
(who went out two and two into tne streets two
-evenlngH in the week for that purpose. Not only
?were the cards accompanied by a short appropriate
Araot, handed to those willing to receive them, out
Kind words of importunity were sometimes added,
ty which many who at first declined were com
celled to come In. They were not merely ilius
Invited to I lie receptions held uvory Friday nighi,
but the cards also contained an Invitation to iac

might come, and to render pecuniary assistum: ?
|1X absolutely necessarv) to such as should
manifest a desire to abandon their life
fit shame. Many tbere were who, after resolving
rperhaps with innch reluctance) to accept the Invi
tation, as they approached the door would some
times falter; and they would shrink back from the
Ihougbt of encountering the eye of purity; then
very entrance being an acknowledgment of gutit.
Friendly hands were there, however, to opeu the
door, and to encourage them to go lu. As they en
tered warm-hearted christian ladles came forward
to greet them and make them welcome; first
jpflerlng them refreshments, then drawing them
Into conversation relating to their temporal
and spiritual welfare. At tills, the first re
ception, seventeen guests were prosent. And after
all had been cordially welcomed by tbe noble
Women, who bad left their pure, light homes in the
Inclement weather to mingle with and minister to
the poor lost ones of their sex, a hymn was given
Jiut, in the singing of wnich most ot those present
olned. There were no permuJcnt accommodations
for tbem at the time, and so, with heavy hearts, at
the close of this reception tbe good uosts were forced
to let them go their way.
SUCCESS ASSt'IlED.
On the l&th of February another reception was
beld, when twenty-six girls were preseut. and one
of tbem, despite tbe remonstrances and ridicule of
tier companions, resolved to go to the St. uurnubas
Home. It was discovered at the start that the giris
objeoted to going to places that could be looi.cd
upon in the llgnt of ' public institutions," partly be
cause of their publicity and partly Decause they re
garded them as a species of penitentiaries, ttic tine
formerly given to Magdalen asylums In England:
and the mnnagcrs of tlio mission at onco determined
If possible to make their home more like that or a
fir 1 vale Onrlstmn family, but little known to any but
themselves and the class whom they were desirous
of directlj benefiting, where the girls could enter
without observation and be under no needless re
straint. Thus they hoped they might tat
least in some instances; be spared the pain
of seeing those whom limy had drawn
for s while into a pure atmosphere, under saving hi
Auences, go out into those sinks of iniquity lrom
whioh they bad striven to win them, nut what
could tbev do? Ihoy had no such aocommoduttms,
nor yet the means wherewith to procure mem.
Afier no little deliberation, however. It was deter
mined to go forward in faith, relying upon Christian
liberality to sustain them in a step so imperatively
necessary to the full success of their enterprise.
A "CITY OP lUCKt'UR."
A commodious house was procured in Amity
Street, at a rent of $3,000 per annum, which would
afford adequate aocoramodallotls for nineteen or
twenu lodgers, rooro than they anticipated
having Ht say one time, as it was de
signed more as a city of refuse than a
permanent asylum. The parlors were neatly
and simply furnished, and, through the kindness of
lriends. adorned with a few books and pictures and
Illuminated texts, rendering thcin cheerful and at
tractive for the weekly receptions. The dormito
ries were comfortably tarnished. TIiuh far. as has
been stated, the managers did not aim at having the
mission house a peimanent home for those brought
under tlielr care, as ether noble institutions under
tbe care of the Episcopal Church subserve this end
to some extent. The mission, .however, offers a
ready and immediate refuge to any who under the
geadiaga ef conscience, the discouragement* of thutr

TUB GOOD likSULTS.
On the 1st or May, 1887, three months after the
opening or tlio mission, seveaty-sevcu girls had
resided in the pi&co for a longer or shorter
tune?some for a day or t*o, some tor
weeks or months. Of these seventy-seven, forty
six it was hoped had abandoned street
life. Fourteen obtained respectable homes. Seven
were restored to their friends. Seventeen re
mained in the house, aud eight in other kindred in
stitutions. Of the sad remainder, twenty-two re
lumed to their evil courses, aud mue were lost sight
or. There aie now in the home seventiseu girls, aud
during tlio nasi twelve months 122 had been re
ceived, making a total of list). Of this uuinber many
remained but a lew days, and otUers for several
mouths, and they all, while they did remain, fouud

Home. Die total number tue Mission iu their lost

Tlie gins are never allowed to go out on the
streets unless accompanied by oue or the ladies who
have charge of the Home, and all letters addressed

lady In charge Before they are delivered. This cen
sorship is a wholesome one, and is of course neces
sary, as vile ? outsiders" are never weary in their ex
ertions to induce the girls to reiuru to their former
lives. An example ol this will give au idea or tne
diUlculties the institution has to contend against.
Oue tiignt a girl ol tue lown, beastly lutoxicated,
called at tne iiome. She was admitted and wan rur
mshed wim a lied. She want away the uext morn
ing. forgetting even to thauk her beneiactors lor her
night's lodging. The next night a girl, a sickly little
thing aiiout sixteen years of age, called and ueclared
that she wanted to amend her lite, aud expressed
herself as h':anily disgusted with Ihtslnlul past. The
next morning she was seen whispering to oue of the
Kills wane tney were going through the hall to
breakfast contrary to the regulations ol the Home;
aud a short mue ulterward sue lugged to be
allowed 10 go away, as sue didn't waut to
stay in the place any louger. It- wasu't "jolly"
enough for her. .Mrs. bidden pleaded with her to stay,
but no, go she would and she went. The following
day. tue girl she had been seen whispering to, who
by the wav had been in the home for several months,
uemanded tier clothes aud loll the house. It would
appear that ttie drunken girl had recognized one of
her old tneuds In the inmate, ami, on reporting the
fact to her ' landlady," that worthy sent the little
sixteen year old to invite her by .-itrong inducements
to cuuie back to a life of sitifui pleasure. Tlio
tempter had coiue iu a weak mouieut, and the iu
mute feii. Another girl who determined to leave,
was told by the doctor I hat her constitution had been
impaired by excesses or years gone by, and that if
she returned to her loriner lire she would not last
three months. Sho turned a dcut car to his en
treaties and lclt. Tills was oil the 14th oi August
last. On the loth or November site died in a house
of ill fame iu i'rince street, c&ilitig pitcously lor her
benefactors or the Mission to come aud take her
back, that she intended to be good and did not want
to die with all iier sins upon her head. She was
buried by the Mission.
THOROUGH CONVERSIONS.
As an illustration of the practical workings of the
mission the billowing turinsacs a tair example:?

perfect satisfaction aud illustrating tue stability of

secured for her a situation in anotuer place, which
sho refused to accept "unless she could nave per

The following letter is fiotu a girl lor whom the
Ladies' Committee procured a situation:?

write to you. 1 think a letter from you would comfort me, I
It-el so lonely. 1 feel like oue aloue In the wide world. Dear

think ot you, a.id of how very kind you \4%re to me, and

The lady with whom she is living writes:?
She la not always cheerful, but is much attached to my
little boy. She Is c<>nselcnltous and diligent. I lael much
attached lo iier and Interested In her.
Those who are lound obdurate and who even after
reinainiug in tlie Home several mouths finally leave
to resume tlieir former lives, in nine cases out of
uii are or that class who to their other excesses
during their carecr of sin had added tiiat of the ex
cessive use of intoxtcatiug liquors. Mrs. Lidaell is
iu constant receipt of letters lie this from glris who
have been furnished with good situations and who
have become thoroughly reformed.
In conclusion it may be mentioned for tbe benefit
of the charitably inclined that this noble institution
is supported eutirely by private subscriptions, aud
that if the Mission had a large and commodious
house it could do ten times the good it is now doing,
ti Is a work that liod's blessing has rested upon
since it begau, aud those who can aid it should do
so, tortlie sake or Him who said that a cup of water
given in his name Would not be without lis reward.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
Muscat, Dec. 12, 1849.
Usually the meeting of Congress Hu been the occa
sion or considerable animation in Wall street, hot
the assembling of the National Legislature ibis year
has not been as yet productive of any very decided
effects upon financial matters. The President's
Message and Secretary Bout well's report rendered
the gold market firmer, and the price touched 124, as
against i:a*, the lowest point of the wee*. Their
eflbct has been rather to strengthen and steady the
market than to Impart buoyancy and activity. The
I gold operators who essayed a "bull" movement in
the beginning of the month have, therefore, received
no check from these public documents, but still have
found It uphill work to maintain the movement.
Enough of the policy of Congross has already de
veloped itself to warrant the belter that, whatever
steps are taken in financial matters, there will be ne
contraction or the currency. Some of the
Western members seem determined on legislation
which will swell the volume or greenbacks now
In circulation. Yvouldlt not be wise to pursue the
policy or masterly inactivity In all this busuiesa ol
the currency f Are we not steadily advancing to
specie payments without the aid of congressional
enactments f Gold has returned to figures which are
the lowest since the summer of 1862. In all proba
bility the decline will go on in the same ratio, and
bring us to resumption without the dangers or a
commercial panic. Who demands such measures
or Congress t Secretary Boutwed is In perfect ac
cord with General 0;?ant In the optulon that the
question is not one ror Immediate legislation. The
present session or Congress should devote itself to
the work of perfecting a plan to fund the national
debt at a lower rate or interest. The people at large
are moro desirous or a reduction or ttieir taxes than
of a return to specie payments, if any change Is
made let the banking system be made iree, each In
stitution to deposit non-Interest bearing government
bonds as security for its Issues. It is a deliberate
Imposition of the prosent banking system to tax
the people about twenty millions a year for the
privilege of its existence. It should give way to one
that would afford a market for a large traction or the
national debt. Last year the banks combated and
dereated all measures contemplating a redistribution
of the currency. There is no power in the land so '
strong as that or the national bank ring, which
wields the Influence and wealth or the 1,680 different
institutions to whtcu the privilege Is now limited.
It it was easy to dercat redistribution, which was
apparent and clamorous Justice, how much more
j easy will It be to stave off rree banking. The re
sponse from abroad to the suggestions or the Con
cessional reports has been of a flattering character.
The immediate effect was rather unfavorable to the
quotations or our five-twenties, inasmuch as London
and Frankfort speculators hau been led to
expect Immediate si>ecle payment recom
mendations on the part of the President, but
the foreign public, comprehending the honest
and honorable position or the Executive
and his Secretary of Finance, Invested so suddenly
that the speculators who reared a loss were aston
ished to find tho bonds go oil ihotr hands at a large
profit. The government market during me week
has been quite active, ir not excited, and under the
Impression tnat the funding process will deprive the
livu-tweniles of their value as a long investment a
sharp demand sprung up for the 1881's, the ten
lortles and the currency sixes, the first mentioned
going up two per ceut in one day, The Impression
is general among the leading government dealers,
both domestic and foreign, that the Secretary of the
Treasury will have no difficulty whatever in funding
the debt at lour and a half per cent. The stock mar
ket during the week was very strong and the cliques
successfully pursued their plan of ajjull campaign.
With rew exceptions every leading* stock on the
list was higher, bv an average of five or
six per cent, on Saturday night than It was
on Monday morning. The cliques rather have
it to themselves, however, for the volume of business
was small. It, Is difficult to enlist the public in any
movement, and will be until the September paulo
has been rorgotten or a new set ot buyers comes
into the street. The money market was easy and
little anxiety is shown as to Its future. The cotton
and wheat crops are moved, or as much as needs
assistance from this centre. The prospect ror tho
rcmaluder or the winter is a supply or funds more
than equal to all the demands that can arise beforo
the return or spring aotlvlty.
Tue weekly statement of tho associated banks
presents a ravorable exhibit, without differing very
much in Its geueral result rrom that or last week,
the slight outflow of currency that occurred during
the wees being more than counterbalanced by the
receipts during the same period. The roliowlng are
the totals or the last two statements:?

have been reduced $522,693, against a loss in re
sources or $22,022. The banks hold of lawful money
in excess or the legal reserve $22,623,813, which Is a
