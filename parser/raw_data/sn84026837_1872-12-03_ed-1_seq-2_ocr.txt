The President's Message.
Tha refusal of l'rmident Grant to hava hit
Message to Congress printed and forwarded to the
press of the various large cities, as has heretofore
been the custom, delayed the publication uf that,
once considered .important document several hours
and it was not circulated in 'Wilmington until a
late hour. As a consequence, the interest which
is usually attached to its reception passed awqy
when it was found that it could not be got and
perused in the club rooms and social circles during
the leisure hours of the evening on which it usually
makes its appearance.
The Message is long and covers a whole page of
some of the city deities; but is devoid of that com
pleteness and finish which a fine writer and man
ot learning and ability gives to literary work and
is dry and irksome. Aside from this tbe fact that
the Presidential office is filled by a man who it
the mere instrument of a party and incompetent to
propose a wise policy and inforce its adoption on
Congress by cogent reasons, and arguments be
coming a statesman, destroys tbe anxiety that
once existed to learn the course of legislation
which Presidents Messages once foreshadowed.—
This is no longer the case, and those who would
learn must wart until the caucus of a political par
ty has determined a policy.
A synopsis of the Messsge will therefore be as
much as our readers will care to wade through,
and this we have tried to furnish them in such a
manner as will give them a fair idea of the con
tents of the document.
The Message opens with s reference to the Bos
ton fire and remarks that otherwise we have been
free from pestilence, war, and calamities which
often overtake nations, and, ax tar as human judg
ment can penetrate the future, no "cause seems to
exist to threaten onr present peace."
A reference is then made to the Geneva arbitra
tion and the award of 115,500,000 in gold by the
government of Great Britian in tbe settlement oi
the Alabama Claims. Tbe decision of the Empe
ror William by which the United States is left in
undisputed possession of Sun Juan is detailed.—
The appointment of a "commission to act jointly
with one that may be appoiuted on the part of
Great Britain to determine the line between our
territory of Alaska and the exterminu, possessions
of Great Britain."
The joint commission for determining the boun
dary line between the United States aud British
Possessions, between the Lake of the Woods aud
the Hucky Mountains, has organized and entered
uj-on its work.
With France, our earliest all
constant and steady fnend of the
Germany, with whose Government aud people we
have so many causes oi friendship, aud so many
common sympathies, and the other powers ot
Europe our relations are maintained on the moat
friendly terms.
To further aid American exhibitors at the Vi
euna Exposition, it is recommended in addition
to an appropriation of money that the Secretary
of the Navy be authorized to" lit up two naval ves
sels to transport between our Atlantic cities and
Triest or the most convenient ]>ort to Yienua aud
bxck their articlea for exhibition.
Our relations with Mexico next claims the at
tention of the President. He regrets the acts of
lawieeiness on the border, and recommends a fur
ther appropriation to enable the Commission to
continue their investigation of the outrages made
upon Americans. He refers to Cuba anil says
Deeply impressed with the conviction that the
continuance of slavery is one of the most active
causes of the continuance of tbe unhappy condi
tion m Cuba, 1 regret to believe that citizens of
the United Btates, or those claiming to be such,
are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed
as property, but which is forbidden and denounced
by the laws of the United States. They are thus
* in defiance of the spirit ot our own Jaws, con
tributing to the continuance ot this distressing
and sickening contest.
Brax 1 and tbe Argentiae Republic and other
States in Central and South America are referred
to, but nothing of special note is said. "Uur treaty
relations with Japan remain unchanged. "
Tbe embassy fiom that country is flattered. Our
representetives in Japan and China have to de.
psnd upon interprétera who kuow our language
imperfectly and therefore it is recommended that
"an appropriation be made to support at least
f iur American youths in each of these countries
to serve as a part of the official family of our
ministers there. Uur representatives would not
even then he place upon an equality with tbe
representation of Great Britain or .f some other
piwen." We presume tbe President means that
these youths shall be educated in the languages oi
Japan or China, but the message does not dis
tinctly say so.
The Message neat refers to the Treasury, tbe
reduction of the public debt and the expenditure,
of tbe various departments, and recommends the
