ill E PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.?
President Cleveland's last annual
nessage, the full text of which appears
n our news columns, is just . such a
date paper as was expected from him.
t is a broad, comprehensive, conscrva
. live, patriotic discussion of public ques-
ions, and is in every particular charac
-7 eristic of the man who wrote it. There
s nothing to indicate that the sting of
lefeat rankles in . his bosom. In. con-
orming with the requirements of the
oiistitution, ho makes .[such frecoin-
nendations to congress as ; he. honestly
•elieves to be essential to the pub-
lie welfare, and proceeds to a dis
cussion of leading issues just as
i hough no election had occurred;
>r that it had resulted: in a popular yin-
dication of the policy he had heretofore
pursued. He is as true to principle in
the hour of defeat as be was in the hour
if victory. The only fault to find with
the message is one too common. with
state papers— its length. By good edit-
ing it might have been cut down to half
the space it occupies without destroy-
ing any of the meat.

STEAM-HEATING FRANCHISE.
STEAM-HEATING FRANCHISE.
At its meeting to-night the council
will probably act upon the petition for a
steam-heating franchise, which has been
favorably recommended by the commit-
tee to whom it was referred. The
Globe publishes this morning inter-
views with a number of prominent citi-
zens, who have been asked to express
their opinions on this matter. Some
are disposed to look upon it with favor.
some arc decidedly opposed to it, while
others either have not looked into the
matter or are indifferent about it.
The Globe has heretofore expressed
its opinion that the city government-
should be exceedingly cautious in
granting franchises of any character,
and more especially when they include
a monopoly. We find no reason in this
instance to change that opinion, nor
can we see why this application should
be made an exception. We have be-
fore our eyes to-day too many cvi-
dences of the folly of indiscriminately
granting exclusive franchises. The city
has been too much the victim of its own
generosity in the past ever to be
guilty of the same fault in the future.
We have reached that stage of metro-
politan growth when we are compelled,
in self-defense, to be watchlttl of the
Greeks who come into our midst bear-
ing gifts. So far as this steam-heating
franchise that is asked for is concerned,
it may be comparatively harmless.
But at best it is setting a bad prece-
dent to grant the applicants an exclu
sive franchise. And yet we do not know
but that this steam-heating pipe line?
if put into operation, may work a great
deal of harm. The fact is, we don't
know anything about it, because it is
yet an experiment, and, as one gentle-
man says in his interview, St. Paul
is the last city on the continent, to
select as an experimental city for a new
heating process. Our winters are too
long and severe to take any risks. But
it is not against the parties who are
making application for this franchise,
nor against the scheme, that our argu
ment is directed. We are simply tak-
ing the position that, as a matter of
principle, it is wrong for the city
government to grant an exclusive fran
chise, unless it is for something that is
absolutely necessary to the prosperity
of the city and can not be obtained in
any other way. And even then the
common council should go slow and
protect the city's interests in every
way that is possible to protect them.
Coming, as this application does, be-
fore a council that was elected on a re-
form platform, we take it for granted
that the body will act wifely in its dis
posal of this application, and will keep
the interests of the city well in view.
_^
SENATOR ALLISON.
SENATOR ALLISON.
The impression has gotten abroad
that Senator Allison is to occupy a
place in the Hakiuson cabinet, and it
is asserted on good authority that he
has already been booked for the next
secretary of the treasury. If this be
true, it exhibits more political sagacity
on the part of the president-elect than
he has heretofore been given credit for
possessing. . Taking everything into
consideration, Senator Allison is by all
odds the foremost man in his party to-
day. They may talk about Blame's
brilliancy and magnetism, or Sher
man's conservative statesmanship, but
it was Allison's cool brain and level
head that won the victory for the Re
publican party in the late presidential
contest. He won the fight by dig-*
ging the party out of the mire
into which the Chicago platform
had plunged it. He went to work and
constructed a new platform in accord
with Western ideas on the tariff and
financial questions, and it was solely to
the Allison diversion that the Repub
licans owe their victory. For this rea
son, if for no other, is Mr. Allison en-
titled to the choice of cabinet positions.
But there are other reasons which com-
mend him. Personally he is a man of high
character, and of very superior abilities.
No man has a better standing in the
senate, and certainly no Republican
senator can exhibit a cleaner record.
But there is . an additional reason,
and the strongest one of -all, why
Senator Allison should be given
the treasury portfolio. He is a
typical Western man, thoroughly
imbued with Western ideas; and if, as
secretary of the treasury, he puts into
practice the doctrines he has always ad
vocated iv the senate | and at home, it
will be a proud day for the West when
Allison is placed at the head of the
treasury department. It will require a
great deal of moral courage on the pait
of Gen. Harrison to stand up under the
storm of indignation that will sweep
down from Wall street in case Allison
is selected for the treasury department;
more, we fear, than he will be able to
muster. Yet, if he is courageous
enough to do it, his administration
will win public confidence at the
start. Wall street has had a sinch
on the treasury department so
long it will be like pulling the eye teeth
of the New York money kings to see a
man who is an honest . advocate of
bimc-talism now placed in control of the
finances of the government. Garfield
had it in mind to make Allison secre
tary of the treasury, but he didn't have
the moral courage to carry out' his pur
pose; so a Western man who was known
to be in sympathy with Wall street was
selected. To some it may seem im
pertinent for a newspaper with Demo-
cratic tendencies to offer suggestions
relative to cabinet appointments under
a Republican administration^ but there
is such an apparent fitness in the sug
gestion of Senator Allison's name for
the treasury portfolio the Globe would
be remiss in its duty to Western inter
ests if it did not signify its approval of
the proposed appointment.

THE GOLD DRAINAGE.
THE GOLD DRAINAGE.
There is something out of gear in
trade circles. . : There is too much gold
going abroad.' Under normal conditions
we should be importing gold at this sta
son, but instead of that the present ex
portation of gold is far in excess of the
importation. This is all-wrong, as
everybody must admit, but who can
suggest the cause or the remedy? .There

cause in the foolish rate cutting anions
the trunk line railways. Others
-attribute ;it to the equally foolish
wheat speculation, while there y are
others who are fully confident
that it is due to the unjust
discrimination against silver. Perhaps
all. are contributory causes, as there
may be others yet undiscovered. It is
true the foreign holders of - American
railway securities are not jubilant at
"the prospect of dividends in the face of
existing rate wars, and it would ybe a
most rational thing for them to do to
dispose of their American holdings and
salt their money down in , something
more substantial. The American : se
curities thus thrown upon the market
by foreign holders must be paid for in
gold when the balance of trade is
against it. Then the unhealthy specu
lation in wheat has -virtually stopped
all grain shipments, because the foreign
buyers can procure their wheat sup-
plies more cheaply from Russia and
India. Still, with the balance of trade
against us, and these • drains upon ; our
gold resources, this country is in a fair
way to hold its own for. a year or two,
anyhow. We have a stock of $500,000,
- of gold on hand and we produce
about $35,000,000 annually, so there is
no danger of a gold famine for a time,
at least. '-/'-' '"'.A. 77* 7?

NAMING THE DAKOTAS. 7
With division and admission in sight,
our Dakota friends are no little worried
over the selection of names for the twin
states when they enter the national sis-
terhood. This question is more of a
worry to the people of the northern part
of the territory than those in the south-
crn part. Congress 'will probably ob-
ject to the admission of any more North
and South states, Hereafter each new
state is expected to come in with a dis
tinct and separate name. If this idea is
adhered to in the division and admission -
of Dakota as two states, the southern
division will unquestionably cling to the
old territorial name. The northern
division will then be forced to adopt a
new* name, which they would dislike
to do because the name Dakota
has a value in all the wheat markets of
the world. Dakota wheat is known the
world over, ranking highest in quality
and price; and a great deal of it is
grown on North Dakota soil. If North
Dakota comes into the sisterhood of
states under a new name it will take
some time for foreign wheat buyers . to
adjust themselves to the change, and to
learn that Lincoln wheat, or Ilarrison
wheat, or whatever may be the name of
the new state, is grown on what was
once Dakota soil, and is the "same grain
that was once quoted as J Dakota wheat.
Under the circumstances, we are in-
clined to the opinion that congress
should waive its prejudice against
North and South •states, and allow both
ends of the greatest wheat-growing ter
ritory in the world to retain the ad-
vantage possessed in the present name.
BRIBE BY IN ELECTIONS.
7 There is a disposition, now that a po
litical calm is inaugurated, to investi-
gate the matter of bribery at elections.
It is conceded that it has become a
feature that may lead to the most dan-
gerous results if continued. The moral-
ize'* can hardly draw too dark a picture
of the possibilities in that line. Look-
ing through the fogs of partisanship, it is
beyond question that the practical hand
in national politics means a full one.
Reliance was not had upon the millions
of political tracts or diffused oratorical
roll. The arguments that convinced
had a metallic ring or rustled like new
paper. It is not insisted by the fair-
minded that the political conscience is
the exclusive property of either party.
It may be assumed that the managers
on both sides used all the money they
could get in whatever way they believed
would count in the ballot. The discus-
sion and investigation should be di-
vested of partisan features and a public
sentiment developed that will demand
the most rigid enactments against
bribery of voters or the use of vast sums
of money in elections.

. DISEASE GERMS. : ...
It is among the discoveries of modern
science that most the more common
diseases, and nearly all of the conta
gious . ones, are caused by bacteria—
micro-organisms. Their classification
and means of destruction without de-
stroying human life are suggested as
possible achievements of the future.
In the latest [number of the Forum,
Dr. Austin Flint regards it as highly
probable that the time will come when
the cause of every infectious disease
will be known; all such will be prevent-
ible or easily curable; protection will
be afforded against all .such diseases as
scarlet fever, measles, yellow fever,
whooping cough, etc., in which one at-
tack affords immunity from subsequent
contagion. The writer concludes, in
fact, that no constitutional diseases will
be incurable, and such scourges as epi
demics will be unknown. That is a con-
summation to be cheerfully welcomed, I
even if it does prolong the sojourn of a
class of. people better adapted to some
other world. x
WONDROUS WEATHER. .7 .
Oh, how gently those summer zephyrs
fanned our brows yesterday. Well,
there is no use talking about this
weather. When this Minnesota coun-
try starts in to do anything, it is done,
and there is no half-way style of doing
it, either. We started out to beat Cali
fornia on winter climates. We are
j .sorry for the Californians that it had to
be done, because its winter climate is
the only resource California had left.
But just see how we are getting along
with the job of laying out a California
winter climate. Here it is the first
week in December and people hunting
for the shady side of the streets. The
overcoat is a burthen, and the only com-
fortable man is the one who is not
ashamed to go ou the street in his shirt ,

A DEAD LAW.
Nearly all the states have laws-
against- betting on elections, but int :
stances of their enforcement are almos
unknown. There have occasionally been
indictments, but convictions did not
follow. A few years ago a judge ]in
Illinois thought he would be doing the
people a service in enforcing the stat
ute. He instructed the grand jury to do
diligent work, . and indictments were
brought in against about half the voters
of the town, but no competent jury
could be secured and nothing came of "
the effort. Betting is a mild form of
gambling; at least, public sentiment
views if very mildly, and a law isn't
worth much that is in antagonism to
public sentiment.

■'-': .George y M. Seymour, member-elect
from that portion of J the .Twenty-fourth'
senatorial district comprising " the ' Sec
ond and Third wards of the city of Still- :
; water, was born March j 26, . 1829, iv
Onondaga county. New York, where he;
passed his early life upon fa farm. At
sixteen ; years of : age :he took 7up the
carpenter's 7 trade, and after four years'
f service,, engaged in -business of 7 the
"manufacture of stoves and salt in Syra
cuse, in which he continued four years.
In 1858, having meanwhile been - em-
ployed as an arcnitect and builder, he
came to Stillwater, Minn., when, in
1861, he was awarded the contract for
prison labor, and engaged the convicts
in coopering and in the manufacture of;
sash, doors and blinds. He continued
under his contract for eight years, hay-
ing had several partners associated
with him, uutil in 1869, when the firm
of Seymour, Sabin & Co. came into ex-
istence, which was incorporated in 1874
under title of the Manufacturing Cor-
poration of Seymour, Sabin & Co., with
Dwight M. Sabin as president, and 6.
M. Seymour, vice president. When the
concern became absorbed by the North-
western Manufacturing & Car com-
pany, he became a stockholder in that
institution, retiring from it in the fail of,
1884. In 1880 he took a trip to Lead-
ville and spent some time there, for two
years acquiring a very general knowl-
edge of silver mining and obtaining:
mining interests, some of which he still
retains. During the war, Mr. Seymour;
served as deputy provost marshal, at its
close was elected sheriff of Washington

SOULS TO BE SAVED.
Protestant Clergymen in New
ni York Will Endeavor to Reap
7< Full Harvests Hereafter.
i Special to me Glol>e.
7,' New Yoke, Dec. 3.— The first of the
series of meetings under the auspices
of Protestant clergymen to consider the
best means of keeping religious work
abreast of the increasing population
of this city was held at Checkering
hall . to-night,' a large audience being
present. Hon. John Jay presided. The
exercises we're opened by the singing:
of the hymn, "Come Quickening Spirit.
Heavenly Dove." . Rev. Walpole War-
ren offered prayer. Mr. Jay then out-
lined the proposed movement. It was
to be ; neither sectarian nor narrow,
but broadly Christian and thoroughly
American.- A crisis had come in the
affairs of the city. The influx of the'
foreign tide was perverting our institu
tions, corrupting our politics, and es
tranging the people from .churches.
Evangelical Christianity must be 7 the
bulwark to check the flood of unbelief
and immorality. Mr. Jay introduced
Rev. J. M. King, of the M. E. churn, who
spoke on the topic "New York Above
Fourteenth Street." He displayed a
map of the locality named, and showed
that while the saloon had kept numeri
cal pace with the growing population,
the Protestant churches had remained
nearly stationary in number, and in
some cases had fallen off. If the saloons
were represented by small clouds on
the map, they would obscure the stars
which denoted churches. The saloons
controlled 40.000, and were open day
and night. Their proprietors did not
take vacations in the summer. In 32,300
tenements live 1,100,000 souls. Outof 500,
- population only 100,000 are
members of churches. Dr. King defined
the evils to be met as follows in the
order of their importance: Romanism
and its machinery, indifference, Juda-
ism and its exclusiveness, inactivity of
professing Christians, foreign-bred re- j
sistance to Americanizing influence, sa-
loons, tenements. These evils were still
greater below Fourteenth street. Dr.
A. F. Schauffler, V. P., of the
city mission, spoke of* "New
York Below Fourteenth Street."
and his map was far more
cloudy with saloons . and less starry
with churches than that of Dr. King.
The population down town, Dr.
Schauffler said, is denser, to-day. than .
ever before, . notwithstanding the on-
ward march of business. All told, there
were 137 churches below Fourteenth
street, while the population was 621,000.
Ten years ag(v when the population
was "considerably less, - there I were
141 churches. What was needed down
town was more home mission work,
more Christian workers who would go
among the tenements and encourage
their occupants to attend divine wor-
I ship; the attendance at the churches
I down town is gradually- decreas-
ing, in spite of the increased
population; if necessary, paid mis-
sionaries should be employed;
j missionary work was needed here more
"than in foreign lands. Unless Christian-
ity and order are firmly established we
must expect anarchy and revolt. - The
Rev. George U. Winner spoke concern-
ing the 400,000 Germans of the city.
Of these but 16,000 are church
members, 10,000 of them be-
ing Lutherans; internal dissen
sions in German churches, he said,
were the greatest cause of lack of in-
terest taken in church matters by Ger-
mans, and tenacious opposition to the
use of the English language in German
churches was another great reason. He
.urged English churches to appoint Ger-
mans as assistant clergymen, whose
duties should be to secure the attend- y
ance of German youths at the churches.
.The meeting will be resumed te-mor-
row morning. 7 '■'."■ .^

A correspondent of the Daily Tele-
A correspondent of the Daily Tele
graph in Rome had the honor of being
received in special and private audience
by the pope on Thursday, who con
versed with him at considerable length.
I presented myself (says the corre
spondent) at the main entrance to the
state apartments a little before 10:30,
and, upon giving my name, was at once
ushered through a suite of stately sa
loons to the throne room, at the open
door of which a monsignor— one of the
papal chamberlains— met me with
outstretched hand and kindly wel
come, begging me to wait for
a few minutes. An attendant Mon
signor was good enough to bear me
company, and to point out to me the
"new splendors" of the state saloons,
which have recently been refurnished
in crimson and gold and adorned with
beautiful tapestries, vases and objets
dart chosen from among the venerable
pontiff's jubilee gifts. The throne from
which the Sal del Trono takes its name
is the one presented to his holiness by
the Spaniards— a magnificent piece of
workmanship, daintily carved and richly
gilt. In the framework of its deep crim
son velvet baldaquin are encrusted two
superb agates about the size of ostrich
eggs.
Shortly after the innumerable clocks
of the state apartmeuts" had ceased
striking the hour, my summons came,
and 1 was conducted to a small, some
what dimly-lighted room at a right
angle to the antechamber leading out
of the throne room. At the further end
of this apartment, enthroned on a dais
raised a few inches above the ground,
sat Pope Leo Xlll.. his white robes and
mozzetta and pallid complexion cast
into high relief by the dark crimson hue
of the hangings covering the walls. On
either side of the throne were ranged
three chairs, to one of which the near-
est to him on his right hand— he mo-
tioned me after I had made the custom-
ary salutations, in acknowledgment of
Which his holiness half rose from his'
seat and bent his head toward me.
I then ventured to ask his holiness if
the German emperor's recent visit to
■ the Vatican proved satisfactory to my
august interlocutor. "I cannot say,"
he replied, "that we arc either satisfied
or dissatisfied with the emperors visit.
That he came to Home was not at our
request; nor was his object in coming
favorable to us, but rather to those who
are against us— to those who, for ten
years past, have practically compelled
me to restrict myself to this place, from
whicli I cannot issue. My dignity for-
bids me to do so. This young man
(questo giovane), having acceded to the
German throne, has been making a
round of visits to European courts, and
finally to . Rome, where his presence
was calculated to strengthen our ad-
versaries and consolidate their position,
not to benefit us. . lie came to see me;
it was an act of courtesy, and I was
glad to receive him. I had much to say
to him, but just as I was beginning my
discourse he interrupted me by calling
in his brother, in order to present him
to me.
"With regard to our modus Vivendi
with Germany, in many respects I have
good reason to be satisfied, Prom the
German government 1 have obtained
many valuable concessions. Bismarck
is a reasonable man; he can be con-
vinced, and I have found him willing to
accede to just requests. His son, too,
who had a long audience of me on the
evening of the 17th, seems very sensible
and earnest. With our episcopacy and
clergy in Germany all is going smoothly
and satisfactorily. The vacant offices
have been properly filled up with the
accord of church and state alike, and to
the contentment of both. We are in ne
gotiation about the withdrawal of the
"prohibitions affecting our educational
orders; but- there is great difficulty.
. The German government ' desires to
keep in its own hands the exclusive in-
struction of Catholic children. To this
I cannot consent. The teaching rights
of the church must be recognized, and
their exercise must be duly authorized
by the state. With less than this 1 may
not be satisfied; and, as you know,
when the pope is dissatisfied the Cath
olics are discontented."
The above (adds the correspondent),
allowing for certain invincible differ-
ences between the Italian and English
idioms, is the exact purport of the chief
statements and observations to which
Leo XIII. deigned to give utterance in
the course of his conversation with me
this morning, during an audience that
lasted twenty minutes. I have only here
set down those of the venerable pontiffs
remarks to which I feel justified in giv-
ing publicity. Whatever I have omit-
ted has been personal to myself or to
illustrious personages in England, with
verbal greetings arid messages to whom
his holiuess did me the high honor to
charge me. For the paternal kindness
and pleasant geniality with which .'Leo
XIII. received and conversed with me
I have no words wherewith to express
my acknowledgments. That Leo XIII. •
is one of the most amiable, as: well as
intellectual of living potentates, no one
who has seen him smile and heard him
speak can doubt.

President-Elect ' Harrison Hob-

Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. B.— The
president-elect had rather a quiet day
and was at work in his library most of,
the time. Gen. James Longstreet, of
Georgia, accompanied by 7 Hon. E. A.
Angier, of - Atlanta, and E. C. Atkins,
,of this ' city, was among the : callers ■_
upon Gen. Harrison this afternoon. The

crn soldier. This • evening Gen.
Harrison dined at the 7 residence of Mr.
Atkins. The other guests were Gen:
Longstreet, * E. , A. Angier, A. Angier,
Dr. Wilson and a half dozen -Indianap
olis gentlemen." Gen. Longstreet tells
the reporters that ."there is not the least
bit of political significance in his visit."
When asked what the South wanted,
the veteran laughingly replied;. ♦Kfhe
South wants every thin--, ;. it wants the
earth, if -it, can go* ft. But it wants,
more tbftii anything else, good, honest
and friendly spirit manifested toward
it. We simply want to be treated kindly
and considerately." Gen. Longstree't
and party will remain over until
to-morrow and then journey eastward.
A prominent gentleman engrossed Gen.
Longstreet in conversation ~ this morn-
ing regarding some of the great battles
he participated in. Among other state-
ments by Longstreet— to the
writer, at least, are new— was the
declaration that he made his famous
charge at Gettysburg against his own
convictions. He advised against the
attack, but Lee overruled him. He was
for pulling up stakes and marching rap-
idly down the valley upon Washing-
ton, and he believed the movement
would have been successfully accom-
plished. He said two great mistakes
were made at Gettysburg— oce by each
of the commanding generals. Firstly,
Lee should not have attacked when he
did, knowing the strength, the entrench-
ment and splendid condition of the
other forces. Secondly, when the Con-
federates began their celebrated re-
treat Gen. Meade committed a great
military blunder by not following tne
fleeing army and hurling his surviving
forces upon their rear. Had he done so
Gen. Longstreet declared he believed
the Confederates would have crossed
the Pennsylvania line without a single
organized corps. _
DR. CRENSHAW'S BLUNDER.
A. Cow Plays a Practical Joke on
a Popular Atlanta Dentist.
One of the best known men in town
is Dr. William Crenshaw, says the At-
lanta Constitution. Some people know
him because, of the fun he has had out
of his resemblance to Green Dodd,
Darnell and others; some know him as
a popular dentist; some know him as an
accomplished musician, while others
know him as a most charming compan-
ion. It is for this reason that I desire
to take my pen in hand and report a
little story that he tells on himself with
great unction.
Dr. Crenshaw lives in West End, near
the terminus of the Whitehall street
car line. Some time ago he bought a
new cow— a very desirable thing to
have in a family— and duly installed
her in his barn. The next morning, as
he chanced to look out of the window
and saw the cow going down the. road.
Some one had evidently left the lot gate
open. He hastily threw on his coat and
started after the cow. His intention
was to get ahead of her and drive her
back. When he got near her the cow,
as if divining his intentions, began to
trot, then she broke into a gallop.
She ran toward Atlanta until she
came to . the railroad, then she
turned to the right and went as far as
Anthony Murphy's place, sometimes
walking, sometimes trotting, sometimes
galloping, but always managing to keep
ahead of Dr. Crenshaw. Near Murphy's
the cow wheeled to the right, went
down to the grounds ot the West End
Shooting club, around by Wilson's pond
and up and down through several of the
back streets. Finally she headed toward
Culberson's store, went to the rear of
Allen Morgan's house and entered his
back gate, which was open. Dr. Cren- j
shaw followed and was trying to chase
her out again when Morgan's cook ap
peared in the back porch. and cried:
"What you doin' dar? Better let dat
cow alone."
"Why, I'm trying to drive her home,"
replied the doctor with some show of
indignation. At this the negro woman
put her head in the door and yelled:
"Mist' Morgan!; Oh. Mist' Morgan!
You better run here. White man out
here in de back yard try in' ter drive
yer cow off."
It was even so. Dr. Crenshaw had
been chasing the wrong cow. "I went
into the street," said he, in telling the
story, "and sat down on a bowlder and
began to think— and my thoughts were
as hard as the rock on which I sat."

SAYS IT'S BLACKMAIL.
Mail Agent Wright Rises to Ex-
plain the Registered Letter
Transaction.
To the Editor ot the Globe. .' -■_
Referring to your article : of the 24
from St. Thomas. Dak, I must say that
it is the worst piece of blackmail that
was ever perpetrated upon a • man. : I
will venture to state that there is not
another case on record since the begin-
ning of the , railway mail system that
parallels this. The trouble in this case
is that there is not a man that has had
anything to do with it, that knows any-
thing about the. railway mail service.
A man with half wit would never try to
do what this Postmaster O'Conner has
tried .to do with me. What is a post-
master's duty in such cases? It is his
duty when registered matter is lost to
report it to the postoffice department,
fltTu they send special inspectors to in-
vestigate, and their report is returned to
the department, and upon that report
the decision is made as to who is
at fault. This Postmaster O'Connor
concluded he would take this matter in
his own hands, as any fool like him
would, and make himself out to be a
great roaring lion, seeking whom ho
might devour. He and his crowd came
to my car and forced themselves in, and
1 could hardly findoutfrom his harangue
what he wanted, only . that he wanted
me to give him $100 for something that I
did not know anything about. He called
me a thief and demanded that I pay
him over this $100 or be put under ar-
rest. This 1 did not do. Ho then de-
manded that 1 deposit 5100 nt Neche,
Dak., to his credit. All this blow about
my promising to deposit $100 amounts to
nothing. I said 1 will willingly deposit
8100, or $500 for that matter, pending tho
investigation and decision of the post
office department. Frank Miller, the
conductor, heard what I said in regard
to this, and 1 would respectfully refer
any person caring to know anything
about this case to him. I was on my
north run that day, and tho postmaster
sent a telegram" to the marshal at
Neche, Dak., telling him to meet me at
the train, and if I deposited the $100 in
bank to his credit, alt right; if I did
not, to arrest me. But this marshal
did not care to undertake to do
so, knowing he had no right
to detain me. Now, if 1 had committed
this crime, what right had this i>ost«
master, O'Connor, to settle it for $100?
This he urged me to do, and it seemed
to be all that he wanted me to do. On
my trip south the next day this man
O'Connor attempted to enter my car.but
I stepped to the door and told him not
to undertake to repeat the assault of the
day before. He stepped back on tho
platform and began to abuse me like
any cowardly dog would. When he
finds his bluff game won't work, he con-
eludes to swear out a warrant for ray
arrest, which he did, and sent officer-
along the line to try to get me to como
back and have a hearing before him and
his gang, which 1 would not do. They
nut their warrant In the hands of Deputy
United States Marshal Shattock, of
Fargo, who is very much of a gentleman
and treated me like I was some sort of a
man. Mr. Shattock came to St. Paul,
and while here he met the chief post-
office inspector from Chicago, who ex-
plained the matter to him, and he re-
turned to Fargo without me. Ou my
next trip north, some. time after that,
Me, Sba^ocj- came to my ear ami wo
talked the matter over, and he went up
to Grafton, Dak., and there I
met this United Slates commissioner,
Yorkey; I tola him there was nocauso
for this action against me, but he said
he thought we had better set a day for
a hearing in the case, which we did, and
Nov. 14 was the day set. He presented
to me an agreement to appear on that
day, which I signed. I signed no bond
whatever, and all this talk about me
forfeiting a bond is false. I want peo
ple to bear in mind that this was all
done in my mail car. I was not out of
the car at any time on that trip. I did
not appear before the commissioner.
He appeared before me in my mail car.
This case was continued, first, by my
attorney; next, by the commissioner
himself, and it has been continued from
time to time by most anyone . that
wanted it continued. In the meantime,
the postoffice inspectors were Investi-
gating this case, and on the evidence of
postmaster and his deputy the depart-
ment decided that they were guilty and
should make good the loss, which they
did, and I have been exonerated by the
department, and in all the communica
tions and resolutions that have come
from St. Thomas, not one word has
oeen said in regard to the decision of
the postoffice department.
The dispatches sent from that place
in regard to this matter are criminal
libel, and the sender of those dispatches
will be indicted here on that charge.
The postal laws say that when a post-
master sends a registered letter to the
road be must first enter it upon his reg-
ister book, and then throw it in the
pouch loose: then he must copy this
entry on a receipt card 'and inclose this
card* in the package of letters so the
mail clerk receiving this mail will have
some guide that there is a registered
letter in the mail should it happen to
get mislaid. In this ease tho postmaster
does not claim that he fulfilled the
rules and law regarding such. •He
simply says that he tied up a registered
letter with other mail and sent out no
receipt therefor, and all the way I have
of knowing that I have not had it is by
my registered books. It doesn't appear
from any records that 1 have that any
such register ever passed through my
hands. And there is not one bit of
evidence against me in this case, *.•
The deputy postmaster says he care-
lessly threw a registered letter belong-
ing to his own oflice into a pouch that L
should have received. 1 can't remem
ber the, circumstances of opening the
pouch on that date, and I am positive
that this letter (toe letter in question)
has never passed through my hands.
This matter is being made personal. If
they had any case against me they
would not make half the fuss that they
do. All the trouble with Mr. O'Connor
and his gang is that I will not willingly
go up there and let them do as they like
with me. 1 have had "indignation
meetings" called for my benefit before
since 1 hays been in the mail service for
doing my duty, and I find I come out on
top of the heap every time. If you St.
Thomas fellows have nothing else to do
you can make your "indignation meet-
ings" weekly, and term it "Fool's Er»
rand." Respectfully,
M. C. Wright.

What He Came For.
Detroit Free Press.
A couple of young farmers were hay-
ing a dispute up Grand River avenue
yesterday. The team was being hitched
up when one of them said:
"Well. Bill, what about that beer?" '
"What beer?"
"The beer you promised."
'•i don't remember."
"Don't you? You were driving along
by my place this morning while 1 was
feeding the hogs?"
"Yes."
"You asked me to come to town. I
said I had a chance to earn twelve shill-
ings digging potatoes and couldn't spare
the time. You said come along and we'd
MS the. sights. I said it wouldn't pay.
Then you said we might .see a big fire.
1 said I'd seen 'em and didn't care.
Then you said if I would come you'd
treat to the beer. So I came. Where's
the beer?"
"Dunno."
"Hain't you goiug to buy any?"
"No."
"You haint?"
"No." B&PS
"Then, Bill Simmontls, 1 want to say
that you are a darned mean man, and
don't you never have the face to ask me
agin to lose a whole day and ride
twenty-eight miles to accommodate
you!" •
