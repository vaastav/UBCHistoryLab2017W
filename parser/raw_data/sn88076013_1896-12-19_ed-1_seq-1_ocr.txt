KENT'S SAD PICTURE.
Dally Re Will See From HI* Cell HI*
Own Little Farm.
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 12.—The last
act In the tragedy in which William
Wiley Pancoast, alias Myron R. Kent,
Iwj
taken so prominent a part, took
place at the state penitentiary this
morning when Sheriff Barnes con
signed the convicted wife murderer to
the penitentiary. At the door of the
prison the party was met by Warden
Wilson and Deputy McKenzie, lioth of
whom knew Kent while he resided in
Mandan. The usual questions asked
all prisoners were answered by Kent.
The great steel outer gate was then
swung open and the man whose nerve
lias never deserted him turned to the
newspaper men and said "Good-bye'
with a smile upon his lips, and then
disappeared down the iron staircase
leading to the cell room. Throughout
the ordeal he was courteous and oblig
ing, making a favorable impression on
the prison officials at the start. He will
be closely confined to his cell four
days, during which time he will study
the prison rules and familiarize him
self with his surroundings, and will
then be given employment in the
Kitchen. His cell is on the opposite
side of the cell room from that of
Swidensky, the self-confessed aceom
plice. Strangely enough, Kent can see
through the heavily barred windows of
the prison the little form house on the
further bank of the Missouri river
about five miles distant, where the
awful deed for which he was convicted
was committed.

Turkish government against the lan
guage used in the president's message

the Armenians and tbe general con
duct of the government toward the

Key West. Fla.. Dec. 17.—Fighting is
reported west of the troeha in Pinnr
del Rio section, where the insurgents
under Maceo's successor. Gen. Itivern,
have taken the field against the Simu
ish forces left there by Gen. Weyler.
No details have been received yet. but
fifty wounded soldiers came in yester
day from the neighborhood of Ar
ternisu. It is stated in Havana that
Gen. Weyler has called in some of the
troops now stationed outside of the
city, fearing an attack by Geu. Gomez,
who is reported as coming eastward
with a large force well armed and pro
visioned. The insurgents lmve already
occupied several small towns held by
the Spaniards in the Eastern part of
the Province of Havana and have had
hardly any defeats. Two train loads
of provisions and arms were captured
by the insurgents on the Matanzas
road Saturday or Sunday with slight
loss. It is reported than an expedi
tion from Honduras lauded on the
south side of the island Saturday with
large supiilies of ammunition and
arms, and that the cargo was safely
delivered into the possession of Geu.

Many American* Enlisting.
Washington, Dec. 17.—Tie attention
of officials here has been attracted by
the stories coming from all portions of
the country indicating that enlistments
arc going on of parties of men to go
to Cuba to Join the insurgents in their
struggle against the Spaniards. These
enlistments are in direct violation of
the neutrality laws and are prohibited
under severe penalties. For accepting
a commission to serve against Spain, a
country with which the United States
is now at peace, the penalty prescribed
by section 5281. Itevlsed Statutes. Is
$2,(100 fine and three years' imprison
ment. while for enlistment to serve
against Spain or hiring any one to en
list, the penalty Is almost as heavy.
No More Men Wanted.
Xew York, Dec. 17—The offices of the
Culmn junta were besieged to-day by
applicants for enlistment in the Cuban
army. Even before any of the officials
connected with the legation had ar
rived. a crowd of sturdy young men
stood at. the entrance to the headquar
ters waiting for the doors to open, and
liefore 8 o'clock the Cuban cause could
have had sixty able bodied recruits.
All were dismissed with the informa
tion that no men were wanted. The
Cuban officials said that they had been
quite overwhelmed with applications,
and that during the last twenty-four
hours nearly 800 men had applied for
enlistment, all of whom had been re
fused, owing to the law prohibiting en
listment here for service in foreign
armies. Many more applications bad
also been received by mail from near
by cities.
Weyler May Go.
Madrid, Dec. 17.—According to sur
face indications, Capt. (Jen. Weyler
will soon be relieved of his command
in Culm. The discontent with Weyler
is noticeable, even in the government
organs. They say that instead of go
ing to Havana to receive an unmerited
ovation, he ought to have continued the
military operations in .the Province of
Pinar del Klo. A bad impression has
also been created here by the dis
patches of the Spanish correspondents
at Havana announcing that Gen. Wey
ler has suppressed all dispatches re
ferrlng to the ovations in Spain in
honor of Maj. Cirujeda. It is supposed
tbe captain general's action was due
to Jeolousy, and it is currently report
ed that the government is disposed to
replace Weyler with Gen. Marin, now
governor of the Cuban province of
Porto Rico.

Phoenix, Ariz., Dec. 17.—At to-day's
session of the national irrigation con
gress E. It. Moses, chairman of the

port says:
"The work laid out by the executive
committee for l&Mi had not been fully
accomplished nor was it as satisfac
tory to the members as it would have
been if they had not lieen handicapped
in many ways in its advancement.
Xearly every senator and representa
tive in congress had been written to
and explicitly told what, was desired
and their co-operation was asked. A
very strong sentiment in favor of irri
gation had been found. The press had
given valuable assistance to the cause
and the railroads had shown no lack
of interest in the work, nany of the
officials of the railroads having given
personal atteution to the work in sev
eral ways that had been productive of
great good."
The congress has brought to Phoenix
about 1.000 visitors, nearly all men in
terested In water storage and its dis

state in the production of dairy prod
ucts. Over $500,000 a year had been
distributed by tbe creameries to the
farmers of the county during the past
throe years of hard times, and Minne
seta butter was now to be found on
the tables of such houses as the Park

HIS GHASTLY FIND.
Cliarle* Stromberar Stumble* Over
the Dead Body of Nel* Lawaon.
Minneapolis, Dec. 17.—In the dark
of the early morning Charles Strom
berg of 023 Quincy street northeast,
stumbled over the rigid corpse of Nels
M. Lawson on the Fifth street north
east viaduct. A pistol lay near by and
a little pool of blood near the head told
its awful story. His home was iu
Grove City, and he had been hoarding
at 448 Madison street norfhenht. There
are a number of peculiar circum
stances surrounding the case which a
casual examination cannot explain.
Two revolvers, one in his pocket and
the other near by him. and the ab
sence of all money on his person,
would seem to ioint to the manner of
liis death being other than suicide.
His watch was found in his hip pocket,
together with one of the revolvers,
There are a number of people who
think he was held up and murdered.
Lawson had some $40 with him at
Stockholm Olson's dance last night and
parties may have become aware of the
fact and followed him to the place
where his body was found. The re
volvers were both of the same make
and size and Chief Smith thinks they
were 1ought about the same time. He
was about thirty years old, fairly well
dressed and of excellent physique.
Narron- Raenpe.
Wefet Superior. Wis.. Dec. 17.—By the
burning of the East end fire depart
ment hall early this morning the city
lost upward of $25,000 of property and
the firemen had a narrow escape witli
their lives. Capt. Johnson and two
firemen were Injured by jumping and
broken glass, but otherwise there was
no casualty. The destruction of the
house leaves the city without a fire de
partment at the East end, and further
more without means of securing one,
owing to tiie depleted condition of the
treasury and the inability to incur fur
ther municipal indebtedness.

St. Paul. Dec. 17.—Five more barns
were burned early this morning. In
cendiary fires are evidently Incoming
numerous in the city and Chief Jack
son and his firemen have not been
sleeping much during the past tiyo or
three days. There have been no less
than twelve fires since Sunday morn
ing. and all of them, in the opinion of
Chief Jackson, are palpably of incen
diary origin, and he lias so entered
them upon his records.

Minneapolis, Dei?. 17.—According to
Information given out to-day the move
ment in which the warrant for City
Clerk Ilaney was tiie fust step, is fos
tered by the local brr.ucli of a national
secret, organization which lias for its
objeet the purification .f city govern
ment. This body is sMd to embrace
a majority of the lar (itics iu the
I'liited States, and to have at its hand
one of the finest systems of secret ser
vice in the country. Detectives have
been working on MinneaiKiiis affairs
for over four months. The exact na
ture of this organization may develop
as the cases are worked up.
It is wonderful to note tiie unanimity
with which the general public agrees
that there is much more behind the
attempt to arrest City Clerk llaney
than the desire to prosecute him on
the comparatively trivial charge of of
fering to disclose (ortain fuel bids to
a rival bidder. Trey feel that if be
was guilty of nothing else, and had
determined to leave the country for
ever. it would have been much better
to have let him go. Unfortunately for
the city's fair name, there is a proba
bility that the names of several other
public sen-ants will be dragged In the
mire before the mess which has begun
to be stirred has been thoroughly
turned over.

All kinds of sensational talk is rife
and many have it that wholesale ar
rests will follow in a few days. It
comes from a pretty reliable source
that more than a score of indictments
are very likely to be returned at the
first, report, of the grand jury which
meets to-morrow. At its last meeting,
the rumor lias it that the paving deal
which was so suspiciously managed
from stnrt to finish last, winter and
spring was carefully investigated by
the grand jury, which nt the time of
the adjournment had practically
agreed to find true bills against two of
the city fathers. The names of the
aldermen who are coupled with the
charge of imodiing are also mentioned,
but it is hardly wife to make them pub
lic yet. When the names are revealed
there will be a little surprise mani
fested with the possible exception of
one.
Many believe that Mr. Ilaney will
never be brought back to Minneapolis.
Those who are on his trail state that
he was wanied, and never took the
route that 1m intended. The city clerk's
name has leen coupled with the Elev
enth ward aldermanic contest in a
manner that many would not relish.
That there has been some crookedness
in the Ninth precinct is quite evident,

Senator Morgan Make* Red-Hot
Speech on the Cuban Question.
Washington. Dec. 17.—Senator Mor
gan (Ala.) held the attention of the
senate and well filled galleries for an
hour by his earnest i.dvocac.v of a
strong and decisive policy in dealing
with the Cuban question. The promi
nence of Mr. Morgan in the Cuban de
bate of last session, when he had
charge of the Cuban resolutions re
ported from the committee on foreign
relations, gave special Interest to his
speech to-day. lie spoke In dispassion
ate style, although his words had a di
rectness and severity In picturing tlu
horrors existing in Cuba such as is
seldom heard in the senate. Mr. Mor
gan spoke freely of the possibilities of
war. welcoming it if necessary, to
guarantee the protection of American
citizens. He asserted that Spain's
hankruptck would prevent the collec
tion of any indemnity for wrongs. The
senator questioned tile wisdom of the
president's position that granting of
lielllgerent rights would lie "untimely."
At the close of Mr. Morgan's speech
liis resolution was adopted requesting
the secretary of state for papers and
information relative to the Competitor
prisoners mid other American citizens
held in Culm by the Spanish authori
ties. Tile question of passing the bill
granting Nancy Allabach a pension,
the veto of the president notwithstand
ing, occasioned considerable debate,
but was finally passed over the veto—

Introduced a resolution for the appoint

ernor lias grauted a pardon to Mr. and
Mrs. Edward Clarke, who ure serving
a seventeen-year term each in the Deer
Lodge penitentiary for the murder of
John P. Stewart by poisoning. The
couple have spent nliout a year in pris
on, and would probably have served
out their sentence had not a confes
sion by an outside woman been made.
Mr. Stewart was a wealthy uiau, and
the subsequent trial of the Clarices at
tracted wide attention. Suspicion at
first pointed to Mrs. Mary Stewart,
wife of tiie dead man, and daughter of
Mrs. Clarke, as tiie murderer. She was
arrested in Spokane, Wash., and
brought to Missoula, where the trial
was held. To save herself she com
mitted perjury on tiie witness stand,
resulting in the conviction of her moth
er and stepfather of the crime of mur
der in the second degree. The daugh
ter testified against her old mother
who was at the time unable to prove
lier innocence, and saw her sentenced
to what would probably have been her
living tomb, with out any feeling. He
morse at what she had done finally
was too much for her, and she con
fessed to having sworn falsely oil the
witness stand. She confessed iu the
presence of an attorney for her par
ents, and afterward to ex-Gov. J. K.
Toole of tiiis city. She agreed to sign
a statement clearing her mother and
step-father, but before she did so com
mitted suicide.

that some time during the holidays a
band of twenty or thirty young Minne

TARIFF ON LUMBER
LUMBER INTERESTS ARE HOLDING
A NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Speeches Are Matle Against the Tar
iff of 1804 a* Discriminating
Against Lumber and Irglng the
Convention to Take Such Action
as Will Secure Protection to Lum
ber In the New Tariff Ulll.
Cincinnati, Dec. 17.— Pursuant to a
call, issued by J. E. Defcbaugh. pub
lisher of the 'lumberman, and W. B.
Judsou. publisher of the Lumbermau.
150 delegates, representing twenty
seven states, assembled here this
morning, when the national convention
of lumber interests was allied to order.
Previous to the perfecting of a tein
porar.v organization Messrs. Judsou
and Defcbaugh made elaborate ad
dresses, explaining tiie purpose of the
convention, tiie requests for a call,
and the present condition of the lum
ber hnslness. Both had prepared elab
orate statements, with statistics on
the lumber trade. They appealed to
the delegates from the Southern
states, which scction was largely rep
resented.
Most of the Southern delegates have
been free traders, but. in lesponding
to the welcome address of Judson and
Defcbaugh, these delegates insisted
that if there is to be a protective tariff
lumber should not be discriminated
against, and that they would do all
they could to secure a tariff on lumber.
They stated that all other articles
used iu connection with lumber, in all
sorts of construction, were protected,
and that the lumber trade was now so
depressed as to require relief.
A temporary organization was per
fected with 3. A. Freeman as chair
man, and J. E. Defcbaugh and W. B.
Judson as secretaries.
Mr. Freeman made a vigorous speech
against the tariff of 18514, as discrim
inating against lumber, and urging the
convention to take such action as
would secure just treatment to the
lumber interests in the tariff bill to be
enacted by the coming congress.
Secretary DefelMittgli read many let
ters from lumbermen who could not
be present but who pledged their co
operation In any action the convention
might take to secure a tariff on lum
ber.
The usual committees were appoint
ed by the chairman, and a division of
tbe work for the session of two days
was carefully made. While the pres
ent purpose is to scciire a tariff on
lumber, yet a permanent organization
is being perfected for the general inter
ests of luniltermen in tiie future.
Protection Demanded.
The following permanent officer#
were chosen: President. C. W. Good
year. Buffalo vice president. II. Clay
Tunis, Maryland, and 10. E. Skinner,
Florida secretary, C. W. Wells, Illi
nois. A committee of about twenty
live, on whicli are William Irvine of
Chippewa Falls, Wis., and S. T. Mc
Kniglit of Minneapolis, was appointed
to appear before congress in the Inter
est of lumbermen. After tiie adoption
of the following resolutions tiie con
vention adjourned subject to the call
of tl» president:
"Whereas, The placing of lumber on
the free list by tiie existing tariff law
not only promotes ruinous competition
on lumber from Canadian mills, but
discriminates against lumber as com
pared with other manufactures. There
for. lie it
"Itesoivcd. That this convention, rep
resenting Hie entire lumber industry of
the l.'nitcd States iu all lines, resiiect
fully petitions congress to place lum
ber on the dutiable list and lie it fur

tiie needs and condition of the lumber
Industry, to the end that they can con
sistently assist In the passage of tills

ination prevails iu some countries ill
South America and elsewhere as
against American lumber, and that
we are entirely opprsed to such unjust
discrimination, and we invoke the aid
of the I'nitcd States congress for tho
purpose of receiving tiie same either
by reciprocity or otherwise.
