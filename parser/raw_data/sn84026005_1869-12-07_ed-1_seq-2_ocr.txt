Tub President's Message. Tbe first
annual message of President Grant, bag
been sent to Congress and made lie appear
nncs In the leading newspapers of tbe
country this morning. Tbe various sub
jects of importance, at present before tbe
country are treated in a fair ana statesman
like manner. His treatment ot tbe finan
clal question is commended ly tbe leading
men ol both 'parties. lie announces that
tbe publio debt bus greatly diminished, and
that tbe country is in n flourishing stale of
prosperity, with a prospect of a still fur
ther decrease during the coming year. He
says: ''Tbe vast resources of tbe cation,
both developed and undeveloped, ought to
make our credit the best on earth. The
entire public debt could be paid In ten
years, but it is not desirttblo that the' peo
ple should be taxed to pay it In that time.
Yearly year the ability to pay increases
in a rapid latio, but the burden of interest
ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be
done without the violation of the contract
of tbe public debt" Tbe relations
of this country to foreign countries espec
ially to gpain and Cuba Is the subject
matter of a large portion of the message,
uud is treated in a fair and open-banded
mauner, which will undoubtedly give uni
versal satisfaction. The subject of Ibe Ala
bama claims is treated like manner.
In concluding his message tbe Picsident
sits: 'There are many subjects not allud
ed to in this messago which ought with
propriety fo be introduced, but I will re
train, believing that your patriotism and
' statesmanship will suggest tbe topio and
legislation most conducive to tbe interests
. of tbe whole people." Ofr spaco will not
permit ns giving a more extended synopsis
of this important document.
Wit have the particulars of a fad case of
abortion which recently happened at Pleas-
anlville, whereby a young woman, whose
parents reside not tar froai this place, and
who hud been at work in a hotel at that
place, fell a victim at tie bunds of ber se-
ducer aud a prominent physician of that
place. Tbe young woman diedurom tb
" effects of an attempted abortion, in conse
quence of which her seducer and the phy
sician have fled tho country. We retrain
from giving tbe mimes of tbe parlies to this
,' unfortunate affair.; .
A full bouse greeted Fattie Stewart and
bis really excellent company, at Sobel's
Hall, last evening. The different charac
ters taken by '-Fattie," kept the audience in
a roar of laughter, la bis line Mr. S. has
few if any equals. Tbe fancy dancing cf
Miss Robinson was excellent and was re-
nnatedlv encored. Her ballad and comic
singing was really meritorious. Tbe do?
V.vorcises. by the champions, Mr. Robert
Wilson and pupils, was immense This
really the best combination of talent tbut
has visited ibis place for a long time, and
our citizens Bhould avail themselves of tho
oDUorlunlly presented to wituces their per
formance thiB evening. An entire change
of programme, and positively last night of
the great company.
TitR Clarion Democrat has the following
interesting oil Items: A. Kltngensniitb
tested his new well at the month of Deer
creek, last woek, but did not get oil.. It
Is orly through the second sand rock about
5C0 feet deep.Ho intends to drill it to the
third sand. D. nhitehlll , is pumping bis
new well, near the tame point, and getting
a small amount of amber oil. Ten gallons
of pure oil was dipped from the old Bait
well there last week. Amos Black has a
new well down some 300 feet, near the
Wbitohill well, at the head of the dam.
The Clarion Rives well, neor Blyson, wllj
be cased, tubed und tested this week.
The oil business at Parker's Landing n
still increasing, and from the certainly of
obtaining oil, and the great length and
width of belt, it bids fair to equal
or excel any other territory in tho country.
Within tho laat few days several wells have
been completed and commenced yielding
oil. The North Western Independent, pub
lished at Luwrenceburg, contains a list of
over CO producing wells, and the daily pro
duction of each, amounting in tbe aggregate
to over 1,200 barrels. Perhaps this estimate
Is a little too high, but from the number of
wells now being finished and tested, there
s little doubt but that before the end c
this month, the yield will be over 1,500
barrels a day. Oil U $6 a barrel at the
wells. This will make an Immense revenue.
The territory is ail In Armstrong and
Clarion counties. A new well called the
Lone Star, on Slump Island, immediately
above the mouth of tbe Clarion river,
was finished on Friday of last week. On
Monday it pumped 24 barrejs of oil In 21
hours, giving promisa of being one of the
largest in the region. It is owned by Ed,
H. Long, Ed. Singleton, Wm. Hartley and
others.
There are over 20 wells, either drilling or
pumping, on the land of Samuel M. Fox,
Esq., on the west side of the Allegheny
river, about half a mile abeve the raoutb of
the Clarion. Tbe first weil finished on this
farm U tbe Palmer well, belonging to the
Clarion Borough Oil Co. It'was torptdoeJ
last Saturday, and when tubed threw out
some 10 barrels of oil. It then commence:)
pumping five barrels a day, with a pros; ccj
of increasing to a much higher Enure. The
Gray Eagle well on tbe a Ijoining lease, is
pumping 25 or 30 barrels a day. Tbe well
on lease No. 1 is being tesjed, with a pros,
poet of proving tbe la'.gest well io the re
gion. Several others will be finished soon
Mr. Fox gets one-fourth royalty, and thi.
will add to bis already larje income.
