What Kisd f a Government Have We 1
This (|UCBlioo wualil pimlc the Wain
I (f the meet sfcious, and we doubt if
satisfactory answer could be given.
I lint, aa the will of Congress is the u
| preste law of the hind, aud that will be
ing swayed by Jiutlor, Sumner and Wil
i sou, wo thiub it ia nearer a triumvirate
1 than anything elao.
There was a time when the I‘resident
J was a barrier to linooottitutisoal legts
; hit too, but that time has passed. Gen
ii era! Grant has thrown himself at the
[ feet of Cawgrcss and promises to do
’ their bidding. By promising “ rigid
• tidherencc to the law" ho virtually gives
I up the veto power. All he wauls is to
I hate the tenure of-ofiicc act repealed,
I so that he may appoint his relations to
• office, and his is willing to strictly cn
| farce the laws of Congress, uo matter
- whether they are just or adjust. If
| Congress grants this only wish of the
• President, they may make soy laws
they choose and ho will cause a “ rigid
• adherence" to them. One brooch of
| the government has thus given in to
Congress, and the other—the Supreme
Court—ia in danger of being made to
ncquicsoe. Already two bills have been
presented to Congress to limit its juris-
I diction. One, presented by Mr. Sum
• nor, deprircs the court of all jurisdic
lion over appellate cases brought before
it on writs of kubeo* enrptu- The oth
-1 or, introduced by Mr. Drake, is still
more sweeping. It provides “ that no
I court created by an act of Congress, or
, judge thereof, shall have power iu any
t ease to adjudge or hold any uct or joint
I resolution of Congress invalid, in whole
• or id part, for any supposed repugnancy
between such act or joint resolution and
I llie Constitution of the United Slates, or
J forauy supposed want cfautbority iu said
t onstitution for the same. Nor shall
the appellate jurisdiction of the Su
preiis Court of the United Stales be
, construed to authorise that Court, in
a*y ante now pending, or hereafter
before it, (u affirm that any or
dcr, judgment or decree shall, for that
t|tusc, bo reversed, vacated and annull
ed. Nor shall any juatice of said Su
pronto Court, in furtherance of the ox
etcistj of such appellate jurisdiction
make any order, or authorize or issue
aoy writ or process, nr taks any pro
ceeding based upon any such adjudging
or bolding by him, or by the said Su
preme Court."
The States, too, have lost their sover
eignty. The President in bis message
to Congress recommends (he reconstruc
lion uf Gegia. She has been rcoa
strutted once, and formally admitted in
to the Union, yet her representatives
haw been denied their seats because
she has not rstiied the Fifteenth
Amendment. Rejecting this Amend
ment constitutes her disloyalty and she
must undergo souther process of re coo
struction. What right has Congress to
force the Southern States to edopt the
IBth Amendment, any than she has to
•wake New York, Ohio, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, or any other State ?
She baa none, and she knows it. They
dare not attempt such a thing in these
States, aud it is only because they know
that the Southern States can't help
themselves, and have to submit before
Congress end the federal bsyoests, that
they force (hem to adopt measures so
averse to their convictions, asd make
tools of them that they may keep in
power and eorry out their cotigna.

the 15th Amendment, we suppose, will
also have to undergo another rcmcdel

reconstruction committee, said lately, is

wishing to have that State admitted,
“it has been given out (hat I intended
to oppose the admission of Virginia ;
this is incorrect, lam only desirous

Our Commerce.
Before the late unhappy civil war
our cominerciul marine exceeded that
of any other country, England not ex
oepted. The Uuitcd States hud a grea
ter amount of tonage than any other
nation, and it was our pride and boast
that we were the greatest luaratiuio
power of the world. The commerce of
1 the country was chiefly iu the hands of
* New England, and its profits helped to
* swell her plethoric coffers. Hut the
* war came—a New England war, iu its
origin at least—and our handsome clip
pers were swept from the seas. Our
rich argosies were the prey of the Ala
baoias and the Florida* set utio.it by
that unnatural strife, aud all the boats i
|. which were not captured were speedily
disposed of to foreigners, and put to sea
* under the flags of foreign power. A
high destructive tariff, another New
England measure, was urged through
Congress to meet the war debt, and the ;
duty oo much of the material required j
.for boat building so enhanced the price
of that species of properly, as to make
it unprofitable, if not ruinous, to engage j
iu it to any exteut. Thu consequence • ,
arc, that our ship yards arc idle, aud
our gallant tars have sought employ- | 1
moot abroad, and our commerce ia not J
restored. New England policy, for once, ,
has over readied itself But, it is seek ,
ing to regain, in another way, wh.it it
has lost through the tariff and the ‘
war. Congress is to be urged to grant
subsidies to ocean steamers, and plans!- i
blc but unsound arguments arc not 1
wanting to commend such a "policy to 1
that body. The Treasury of the United j
States is expected to pay back to New I
England, the sum of wealth which New 1
England cupidity has lost. But this ‘
expedient will out avail to restore a J
ruined commerce, even though a plastic ]
Congress should grant their requests, i
The tariff must bo greatly modified, and
our currency brought to a specie stand
ard, so that labor will not bo so far in
excess of European rates as to exclude I
our industrious ship builders from a 1
fair competition with those of other '
countries, before wo can regain what ,
we have lost and reinstate ourselves in t
our former prosperous mnmtimc coudi- I
tiou. Temporary expedients, or special ‘
legislation, will not cure the evil; there
must be a thorough change iu our policy,
if wc would again secure the largest *
share of the commerce of the world.— (
It is strange that the New England ,
mind, over alive to its material interests, I
controlling as it docs the policy of this '
country, has not perceived this truth. *
aud squared its action accordingly. A
blind fatuity, however, seems to lead it, j
like the will-o’-the wisp, over the bogs
and feus of error.
W e.stkun Maryland 11. It—An 1
ordinance is now before the City Coon
oil of Baltimore, authorizing and re- j
quiriug the Register of the city to s
endorse or guarantee the bonds of the 1
\\ estern Maryland Railroad Company, c
for the sum of $1,300,000. This or '
dioance has to be submitted to the Leg
Ulataro for their action, aud if an act 1
is passed by them, authorizing such cn- *
dorsement, then it goes before the peo *
pie of the city of Baltimore for their a
approval or disapproval. We hope this 1
question will soon get before the peo
pie, when, we have uo doubt, this aid
will be quickly giv.u us.

U the Union a Curse —Here is '
1 the way the New York Pbut “goes for’'
; those who urge the necessity of a higher
i tariff for protection :
If there is any such necessity for
i “ protecting” industry as some people ‘
| imagine, it would seem that such pro
. tection is far more urgently needed be
' tweeu the States of this Union than
1 between our country and others separa
ted from it by a wide ocean.
about a quarter more, for
instance, to produce iron io Pennsylva
nia than in Missouri Ought not the
poor Pennsylvania us to tie protected
against the Missourians ? Cotton goods
can bo produced more cheaply in Mas
sachusetts than in Michigan; ought not j
the Michigan manufacturers to be pro- j
tested against their rival* in the East? i
Again, if “protection” is necessary |
to establish “intant manufactures,” do
not the ftouthern States need to be pro
tected against the Northern ? Do not
the Western States need protection
against the Eastern?
ft is oo wonder some of the protec- i
tionist chiefs were willing to “let the i
805th go” io 1861. Oo their theory, t
to destroy the Union would have been
to benefit all the fragments of it. j

of tho foiled Slates, and to provide
for the redemption nf legal tender notes

Alabama, were admitted to their seals
The Senate on Wednesday, the Bth,
elected the members of the several
standing committees ns previously sc
looted by the republican caucus. A lining
the bills introduced and referred was
one to repeal the lost oath act. Mr.
Kerry, who introduced this hill, made
some very sensible remarks on tlie sub
ject. A resolution was adopted request
mg the committee on military affairs to
inquire whether any legislation is nec
essary to secure to colored citizens who
j have served in the armies of the United
i M l ua * 1 iglils with white citizens.
| The joint resolution to remove all polili

national banking free. It was referred
to the committee on wavs and means I

resolution in favor of the recognition of
the independence of Cuba, and declaring
that the House will support the Presi

tallied. Hills were introduced and re
ferred to abolish the duties on coal; to

calling upon the Secretary of War for

harbor ol Baltimore. The census bill
was then tukeu up in committee of tho
whole, when a spirited debate ensued,
but no result was‘arrived af, and the
House adjourned.
The Senate was not in session on
rriday. In the House the census bill
was again discussed and atueuded. but
no final vote was taken A motion to
strike out the enacting clause was voted
down by a Urge majority. The princi
pal objection to tho bill seems to be
that it creates too many federal office
holders. A largo im.; her of bills were
introduced and referred, among them
one to relieve farmers who sell their
own products from the necessity of tak
ing out license us produce brokers, and
another to make monthly sales of coin
in the United States t.easury, except
such us may be necessary for the pay
ment of the interest on the bonds of
tho United States.
The Senate was not in session on
Saturday. In the House, tho ways and
means committee wore directed .to in
quire into tho cxpediuncy of reporting
a bill to repeal so much of the internal
revenue law as imposes a manufacturer's
tax on provision dealers, and to roliuve
the provision dealers, and to relieve the
provision traJe from all taxation. Mr.
IngcfHoll again offered his bill to nn
thorixe an additional issue of forty four
millions of legal tender notes. A mo
tion was made to lay tho bill on the
table, but it was negatived by 88 nays
to 04 yeus. It was then, by almost a
similar vote, referred to the committee
on banking and currency. The com
mittcu on reconstruction submitted v
-eral documents in relation to the ud
mission of the Stale of Virginia. A
bill wns introduced and referred to dis
pense with spies and informers in tho
internal revenue offices. The consider
ation of the census bill was then re
sumed, and continued until the hour of
. adjournment.
In the Senate on Monday, the 13th.
a large number of memorials were pre
’ acoted, and a bill introduced to abolish
I fho franking privilege. Tho bill to
, further define and regulate the juris
j diction of the courts of the United
States was taken up and discussed nt
length. A bill was introduced provid
ing for tho farther “reconstruction” of
j the State of Georgia.
In the House, Mr. Butler, from the
committee on reconstruction, reported
i thrOe bills looking to the early admis
•ion of the Slate of Virginia. There
I does not seem now to be much doubt of
the admission of tho Slate before the
, holidays, although the House has re
solved to adjourn over from the 22d of
[ December to the sth of January. A
i bill was passed to remove political dis
f abilities from a number of Southern
