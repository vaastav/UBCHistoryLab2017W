THE. WAR DEPARTMENT.
Extracts' from Secretary lttklim' Report
on Its Iluslness Tor tho Year.
Washington, Doc. 5. Tho annual
roport of tho secretary of war has been
xnndo public. Tho efficiency of the
differont corps is tho subject of com
ment and tho rovlvnl of tho grudo of
lloutcnnnt general is urged, the follow
ing reasons being advanced:
"Tho interests of tho nation demand that tho
administration of military affairs BhaU bo at
tended with dignity and authority. To this end
It Is nccossary that tho commanding gcnoral
should bo conspicuously superior In rnnlc to nil
subordinates. Kxperionco hns Bhown that
rank, as well ns command, Is essential to give
proper effeot to authority In nny military or
ganization of Importance. Accordingly, jt is
recommended that tho lieutenant generaloy bo
rovlrcd as a pormanont grado of army rank."
Secretary Elkius wishes to elevate
tho enlisted personnel of the array and
makes recommendations as follows:
If good men aro wanted for tho army they
must bo paid something near what wago-carn-ers
recolvo In tho ordinary pursuits of civil life.
Under tho pressure of national prosperity rep
resentative men command good pay. Tho army,
under favorable conditions, should bo ono of
tho most desirable trades of youth, and thero
can scarcely bo a doubt thnt bright nnd ad
venturous young men would Bcek our colors in
considerable numbers If it were generally un
derstooa that courago and merit would bo
suitably rewarded. Under present conditions
thero Is senrcely any pcncunlnry benoflt to at
tract a man to tho ranks. Promotions to com
missioned grados aro necessarily fow, nnd tho
diffcrenco between tho pay of a prlvnto
nnd a non-commlssloncd olllcer is hardly
appreciable, when considered in tho light of nn
Inducement to enlistment. It is thercforo reo
ommonded that nt least tho pay of all non-com-missioned
grades bo lncrcesed to tho extent of
malting promotion thereto tho object of legiti
mate nmbition, theroby Inducing tho enlistment
of tho very best material to compovj for tho ad
vantages of promotion to the grade of both
commissioned and non-commlssloncd otllccrs."
The report urges that small posts bo aban
doned and that regimental posts should bo
located at or near tho principal cen
ters, whero transportation facilities aro
ample, and movements of both men nnd sup
plies may bo rapidly nnd economically in ado.
Tho army could bo maintained under
theso conditions much cheaper than ever bo
foro in its history. It is thought thnt tho
cities near which such posts may bo located
should be required by congress to donato to
the government sufficient land, say 1.0OJ acres,
In consideration of building and maintain
ing such posts in their lmmedtato
vicinity. Officers and men would thus
havo access to churches, schools, II
brarles, and other advantages which aro only
to bo found near largo centers of population.
Added to this, the prcsenco of troops in tho
states would famlllarlzo tho pcoplo with tho
army, lead them to better understand its opera
tions, and, it is believed, foster a kindlier inter
est in it.
Following aro tho recommendations regard
ing West l'olnt military academy:
'The high standing of the military academy
at West Point has been maintained. The re
ports of the boards of visitors and of
tho superintendent show marked advance
ment and speak well of tho condition
and management of tho institution. Its
capacity la not overtaxed. Vacancies in tho
list of cadets constantly exist, which it is Im
portant should he kept full. It is recommended
that the president bo given-authority to appoint
ten cadets nt large each year, as was author
ized by law prior to Juno 11, 1808."
Ilefcrrlng to military drill In colleges In tho
United States, the report says that ocr 1,000
boys aro now undergoing- such instruction by
army officers detailed for that purpose.
The following refers to the national guard:
"The Importance of maintaining and improv
ing the mllttla of the several states and the Dis
trict of Columbia Is generally udmlttcd. Tho
national guard Is the reserve forco of tho
army. Attention is invited to tho nec
essary appropriations for arming and
equipping this rescrvo force. In 1808
tho appropriations for tho mllttla of the states
nas SX),000. The highly-Improved arms nnd
equipments of tho presentdny cost for tho samo
number of men more 'than treble what they did
eighty-four years ago. Tho population of tho
country is many times what It was
then, and tho demand for thess
equipments has increased many times.
An appropriation of only 11 vo times the amount
opproprlated in 1808 can hardly bo considered
extravagant. Kecent appropriations havo been
entirely inadequatn and the war department is
under tho constant necessity of refusing sup
supplies called for from tho different states.
An appropriation of at least 11,000,000 for this

' ' For two years I suffered terribly
with stomach trouble, and was for
all that time under treatment by-a
physician. He finally, after trying
everything, said my stomach was
worn out, and that I would have to
cease eating solid food. On the rec
ommendation of a friend I procured
a bottle of August Flower. Itseem
ed to do me good at once. I gained
strength and flesh rapidly. I feel
now like a new man, and consider
that August Flower has cured me."
