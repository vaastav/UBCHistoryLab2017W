Met Death by Poison.
Five weeks ago John Ilartmitn, nn nffod
fanner livinjr north of Laiugsburp:, died
suddenly, and the cause of death was
plven as uraemic poison. A few days ago
Mrs. Hart man, his widow, died after u
few hours' illness. Dr. Scott, who was
called to her bedside just before death
ensued, found that William Uoehm, alias
lias?, and his wife, Knnua, who made
their home with the Ilartmans, had pur
chased quantities of opium at different
drug stores, and he laid this information
before the prosecuting nttorney. An in
vestigation was started, and nn inquest
was held. The jury returned n verdict
that Mrs. Hartman came to her death
by poison, and from the evidence sub
mitted had reason to believe that the
Itoehuis administered the same.

ever since then he has been figuring how
to get even. He has at last invented a
threshing machine that mechanics say is
practical and which is entirely different
from anything now in use. He has named
it "The Cripple's Revenge." A very suc
cessful exhibition of its working powers
was recently given.

Annual Grind Resins.
Washington correspondence:
HE regular or long
session of Congress,
as it is called, be
cause there is no
constitutional limi
tation upon the per
iod of its duration,
opened nt noon Mon
day. The leaders
and n very large ma
jority of the mem
bers of both houses
participated in the
opening ceremonies,
and President Mc
K I n 1 e y made the
journey to Washing
ton from the bedside
of his dying mother
that his absence might not delay the na
tional legislature at its assembling. The
extra session robbed the opening of the
regular session of the excitement and in
terest which usually attach to it. As
the House was completely organized nt
the extra session, and all the committee
assignments were made then, beyond the
natural stimulus produced by the return
ing statesmen aud the outlining of
schemes by members of the "third house"
or lobby, Washington on the uight preced
ing the opening was tranquil.
The ceremonies attending the opening
of Congress, though comparatively of a
routine character, make a siectacle which
In some respects is regarded as the great
est official event of the year at the na
tional capital. Monday the weather was
propitious. The sun shone brilliantly
from a cloudless sky, making a glorious,
bright December day, with a tinge of
frost in the air to invigorate the lungs and
a breeze just strong enough to keep the
stars and striies snapping from the flag
ttaffs. At the capitol the crowd swann
ed into the corridors at an early hour nnd
choked the marble steps as they ascended
to the galleries from which they were to
view the show. As is usual on such occa
sions, the reserved galleries were careful
ly guarded on both the House and Senate
tides, admission being only by card, and
the public had great difficulty in wedging
itself into the limited space set aside
for it.
The program at the House Monday was
Tery simple. The House was called to
order by the Sneaker, who, after the chap
lain's invocation, directed the Clerk to
cnll the roll. This having been accom
plished, and the presence of a quorum
demonstrated, the clerk was directed to
notify the Senate that the House wus
ready for business, and a committee was
appointed to wait on the President. After
that there was n recess to await the ar
rival of the President's annual message,
which was read upon its reception and
was followed by an adjournment until
Tuesday.
It is the intention of the House lenders
to proceed with the business of the ses
sion as rapidly as possible. The commit
tees will all begin their labors at once.
The appropriations committee has leen at
work for ten days, and Chairman Cannon
expects to pass two of the regular budgets
before the holidays.
Among the early general measures to re
ceive consideration will be the bankruptcy
bill. Whether it will be the Nelson bill,
which passed the Senate at the last ses
sion, or a modification of the Torrey bill
depends on the temper of the Judiciary
Committee, which will submit the meas
ure to the House.
Beyond doubt there will Ik? several res
olutions of inquiry during the first week
which may be more or less sensational,
nnd some of the radical pro-Cuba mem
bers will attempt to get consideration for
a Cuban resolution before the Foreign
Affairs Committee can act, but owing to
the nature of the House rules all these
hasty efforts will prove abortive, and they
probably will take their regular course.
Simultaneously with the fall of Speaker
Reed's gavel in the House, Yice Presi
dent Ilobart called the Senate to order.
Half nn hour before the Senate convened
the public and executive and reserved gal
leries were filled with spectators to wit
ness the opening of the session. The hand
some costumes of the ladies added much
to the brightness of the scene. The Sen
ate chamber at the opening was a verita
ble conservator-. The floral display was
unusually rich nnd beautiful, and the
odor of flowers was heavy in the ha-11.
Seventy-seven Senators responded to
their names on the roll call.
The Senate to start with had a calendar
of about 300 bills reported from the com
mittees during the special session. The
indications on the opening day were for a
little more activity than usual during the
pre-holiday session. This is largely duo
to the fact that the supporters of the ad
ministration and advocates of annexation
are very anxious to secure the earliest
possible consideration of the treaty with
Hawaii. Senator Davis, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, an
nounced his purpose of pressing annexa
tion at the earliest possible moment. One
point which the committee will be called
upon to decide is whether to proceed to
ratify the treaty of annexation or to an
nex the islands by resolutions. The an
nexationists have lost some votes during
the vacation, and there is now apprehen
sion that the two-thirds vote necessary to
assure the ratification cannot be secured.
Some members of the Foreigns Relations
Committee who favor annexation advo
cate this course because they tay they see
no reason for traversing the same ground
twice, as they would be compelled to do In
cose the matter should be first considered
In executive session, fail there, and then
be taken up in the form of a resolution In
open Senate and House.
Despite all opposition, it is not doubted
Hawaii will be brought under the stars
and stripes. No act of the American Con
gress in many years past has attracted as
much attention throughout the world as
the annexation of a distant island is sure
to attract.
What Congress will do concerning the
President's presentation of the State of
our relations to Spain and Cuba only the
future can determine. Unless some turn
of events rouses public opinion and finds
response In Congress It may 'be regarded
s fsirly certain the peace policy of the
rmsldcnt will be supported by both
houses of the national legislature. The
President! messngt, rend between the
lines, does not indicate that he hat aban
doned Cuba, but rather that he hopes ln
the future to achieve the practical inde
pendence of that island should Spain's
present efforts to restore peace prove
fruitless, and by methods which will be
the fruits of natural causes, and which
will not necessarily bring on war between
the United States nnd Spain.
Other topics which will be sure to cause
much talk throughout the world, and
some of which may be the subject of ac
tual legislation, are revision of the immi
gration laws, bankruptcy, pooling by ray
ways, rehabilitation of the Interstate con
merce commission, prevention of scalping
of railway tickets, the Central Pacific
Railway's debt to the Government and
the revenues of the Government under
the Diugley law.
. ECKELS MAKES REPORT.
Reviews National Banks and Favors
Aaiendlng N'ote-lnulnu Law.
The annual report of James H. Eckels,
Comptroller of the Currency, for the year
ended Oct. 31, 1897, opens with a brief
review of the history of the legislation
which constitutes the present national
bank act, and invites the attention of
Congress to amendments to the law rec
ommended in former reports without spe
cifically repeating them.
On the subject of bank note circulation
the Comptroller says:
It Is uotlcenble that In all the changes
which have been wrought In the national
currency act from Its Inception to the pres
ent time the feuture subject to criticism,
but which was Intended should constitute
fhe principal bom-tit to be conferred, has
remained comparatively unchanged name
ly, the note-lHHiiing function. Whatever Jus
tification there wus In the tlrst Instance for
restricting the Issuing of notes against the
bonds of the Government, deposited with
the Treasurer of the United States, to l0
per cent, of the pur value thereof, has long
since ceased, ln the report of every Comp
troller of the Currency during the lust twen
ty years the wisdom of changing the exist
ing law so that the banks and through them
the communities In which they nro located
might have the additional hem-tit of nn add
ed loanable capital has been urged. De
pplte all this the law still remains without
(iniendment. Not only should the bank act
be amended In this particular, but Con
gress should seriously consider such a change
In the method of bank note Issues as will
ennble the banks of the country to more ade
quately meet the demands of trade and com
merce In nil sections of the country.
It Is considered by every great commercial
government, except the t'nlted States, to be
the sole province of the bunks to Issue the
paper which circulates ns curreney. The
belief in a bank note currency ns being
better nnd safer than a government paper
currency prevailed unquestioned in this
country, until, under the apparent exigen
cies of the wur, the Government undertook
to Issue paper curreney. IOvcn under such
circumstances the promise was already giv
en, however, that It should be retired at the
CHrllest pruetlenl moment, nnd the admis
sion freely made that It was neither a wise
measure nor a safe form of currency.
Ret ween the competition of the Govern
ment note Issues on the one hnnd and the
unnecessary restrictions Imposed by law up
on the other, together with the increasing
price of bonds required to be deposited as
security, the note Issuing function of the
bnnks has been permitted to become merely
nn Incident to t lie conduct of the national
banking associations of the country. It has
been seriously suggested more than once that
the bank note Issues be done away with, and
all paper be Issued by the Government In
stead. The danger of such a course Is uot to
be overestimated. The experience of every
government has been that governmental cur
rency paper Is a source of weakness and
danger. In the United States, where there
hns been the nearest approach to success,
with the volume of the Federal paper com
paratively limited In amount, the credit of
the Government has been more than once
put ln Jeopardy through it, nnd the business
interests of the country subjected to unnec
essary loss and confusion.
The argument that the Government letter
tl nn the banks enn provide for the redemp
tion of paper note Issue will not stand the
test of a careful analysis. The Government
Jibs no means for caring for Its demand liabil
ities, except through borrowing and through
the levying of taxes. Upon the other hand,
the hanks have nssets which can be prompt
ly converted Into cash to meet their out
standing notes when presented.
The total number of national banks or
ganized since the system was put into
operation, in 1803, is shown to have been
5,01)5. On Oct. 31 last there were in act
ive operation 3,017, having nn authorized
capital of $030,230,205. The total out
standing circulation of the banks then in
operation was $229,109.SS0. of which
$202,094,555 was secured by bonds.of the
United States, and the balance by law
ful money deposited with the Treasurer
of the United States. The total circula
tion outstanding of all national banks on
Oct. 31 last was $230,131,005, of which
amount $1,558,800 was secured by bonds
held for account of insolvent and liquida
ting banks, and $20,205,325 by lawful
money deposited for their account and by
active bnnks reducing circulation. The
net decrease in the nmount of circulation
secured by bonds during the year was
$11,584,334 and the gross decrease in the
total circulation was $4,851,292.
During the year forty-four bnnks were
organized, with an aggregate capital stock
of $0,420,000. During the year seventy
one banks went into voluntary liquida
tion. There was paid to creditors of Insolvent
banks during the year $13,100,781 in div
idends. The magnitude of this unequnled
record, the report sa)-, will be more forci
bly illustrated if considered in the light
of what has been accomplished heretofore
In the way of dividend payments to the
creditors of insolvent institutions. In
1893 there was paid in dividends $3,433,
040; in 1894, $5,124,577; in 1S95. $3,380,
552; in 1890. $2,431,959, and in 1S97, $13,
109,781, making a total of dividends paid
within the five years from 1893 to 1897
of $27,500,515, or 304 per cent, of all the
dividends that have ever been paid to
creditors of Insolvent banks. From 1803
to 1897 there has been paid In dividends
$75,935,025, and in the year embraced In
this report $13,109,781, or 17 1-3 per cent,
of all the dividends that have been paid
during the period of thirty-four years of
the existence of the system. Since Oct.
31, the end of the report year, seventeen
additional dividends have been ordered,
amounting in the aggregate to about $025,
000. The report contains the latest compiled
statistics relating to the world's monetary
systems, and the stock of gold, silver and
paper currency. A very Interesting fea
ture of this statement la the per capita,
amount ot each kind of money, in the
countries named. The per capita aver
ages In the principal countries of the
world are as follows:
United States, $23.70; United King
dom, $20.05; France, $34.08; Germany,
$18.9.";Uustria-Huugnry, $9.33, and Rus
sia. $S.0B.
The Comptroller renews his recommen
dation of last year, urging that national
bank examiners be paid an annual salary
instead of feet as now.

HAYTIBOWS ITS KNEE
THE GERMAN FLAG SALUTED AT
PORT AU PRINCE.
Trouble Between the Little Republics
and the Kaiser's Kmplre Thought to
Be Settled-Native Residents Bitterly
Kesent the Government's Back-Down
"Wacht Am Rhine" Tooted.
The question of the indemnity demand
ed by Germany for the alleged illegal ar
rest and imprisonment of Herr Emit Lite
ders, a Gernnn subject, has been settled
to the satisfaction of Germany nnd
all the demands of that couutry have been
agreed to by the Government of Hnyti,
in face of the display of force made by
Germany and under the threat of a bom
bardment of the defensive works of the
port unless these demands were agreed to
within the eight hours following the time
the German ultimatum was delivered,
shortly after the arrival at Port au Prince
of the two German cruisers sent to back
up the demands of the German minister.
Naturally there is a strong feeling of
resentment against the Government on
account of the humiliation inflicted upon
the country by Germany; but it is not
thought that anything more serious than
a ministerial crisis will result.
The Trouble with Haytl.
The trouble in-twcen Hnyti and Ger
many arose from the imprisonment of
Emile Lueders, son of a German who
married a Hnytian woman. Up to a
short time ago Lueders was a Haytian
citizen, but, having been concerned in
various little affrays, among which are
EMIL LUEDERS.
mentioned four duels, he seemingly deem
ed it wise to change his nationality, and
registered his name at the German con
sulate. For an assault upon a Haytian
officer his second affair of the kind
Lueders was arrested, convicted and sen
tenced to a mouth's imprisonment. An
appeal was pending when the German
minister interfered, without invitation,
and forced his way into the private apart
ment of Tiresias Simon Sam, the presi
dent of the Haytian republic, and, in a
rude and peremptory manner, demanded
the release of Lueders, with an apology to
the German Government, an indemnity of
$1,000 a day for the time he had been
in prison, the immediate trial of the police
who arrested him, and the dismissal of
the judges who sentenced him. If the
prisoner was not released within twenty
four hours the indemnity was to be $5,000
a day for every day afterward.

When the President entered the room,
accompanied by his wife and his niece,
Miss Mabel McKinley, the sister of the
President, Miss Helen, said: "Mother,
here are William and Ida." The Presi
dent kneeled by his mother's ledside nnd
kissed her tenderly. As he did so she put
her arm about his neck and signified that
she knew him. She also recognized the
President's wife, and reached her hand
toward her.
It seemed to friends that she had some
how or other been waiting for the arrival
of her son. Soon after she lapsed into an
unconscious state, nnd the strength that
had been husbanded for the last meeting
of son and mother seemed to leave her.
The scene was a pathetic one that beg

there was a joy unspeakable in the breast

of the President. He had again been
permitted to see his mother alive, lie
had left her bedside to go to Washington
In answer to the obligations of his coun
try. He had witnessed the assembling
of Congress and had now returned before
the death angel made his visit and took
with him the spirit of the aged mother.
With the arrival of the President the chil
dren of Nancy Allison McKinley gathered
about her couch, made sacred by her ten
acious struggle agniust death. The re
union was complete.
While a recent performance of wild
beasts and their tamer was in progress
at a village near Kovno, Poland, the lion
tamer was killed by a lion and a tigress.
A fearful panic ensued among the specta

death, many others being seriously In

DECEMBER WHEAT SL09.
This Is the IIlKhest Notch Touched
Since the 1801 Corner.
Amid the wildest excitement seen on
the Chicago Board of Trade within the
memory of the oldest trader December
wheat sold for $1.00 Thursday. This is
the highest mark which the cereal has
reached since the historic combine of 1891.
During the four hours of session a rise
of 7V& cents over the opening price was
recorded. The Chicago price was 10 cents
over MinneniMilis nnd Duluth, 10 cents
over New York and 7 cents over St.
Louis.
At this price the wheat of an eighty
acre Kansas farm, land value $15 per
acre, was worth more than the land itself,
the fann equipment nnd the house and
barn. Not n farmer in Minnesota or the
Dakotns with 2.400 bushels of yhcat, the
product of eighty ncres last harvest, but
what could have sold his grain hi Chicago
Thursday for more than his land would
bring, nnd have a few hundred dollars to
the good.
If the pace of the first few minutes had
been maintained during the rest of the
lession it is probable that kernels of wheat
would have sold ns high as diamonds at
the close. The cereal shot up to $1.05
at a bound and the holders of big wheat
contracts could have disposed of them
at this stage without any trouble. When
$1.05 was bid for December wheat some
of the bulls thought the temperature was
getting rather high and dumicd a lot of
their claims. This action had the effect
of easing the market nnd checking tempo
rarily the efforts of the more aggressive.
len minutes of comparative quiet reign
ed in the stormy session, nnd then the
bulls by n coup started the figures their
ovn way again. So complete was the
surprise that many of the dealers declar
ed that they expected to see the price sail
up to $1.50 before the end of the session.
At $1.00 the explosion ot u Krupp gun
could not have been heard above the pan
demonium. The bulls forced the cereal
by fractions of a cent up to $1.07. Here
their focmen made u temporary rally and
brought another elevator full of grain
into their midst. A half hour of deadlock
resulted, but the dealers with the horns.
metaphorically speaking, concentrated
their forces on n weak point in the other
ranks and shot the price to $1.09, the high
water mark of the day and of six years.
Then succeeded the usual slump as the
time for the clang of the gong approached
and December closed at $1.07.
THE SKAGUAY PASS.
It Is a Trail of Horror and Death
Leading to the Klonkike.
The Skaguny Pass, en route to the
Klondike region, is thus described by an
American miner who has just returueJ:
Ihe Skaguuy Pass is a rank fake, nd
vertised by a lot of Shylocks and mounte
banks at the town of Sknpuay for the
purpose of making money out of the de
luded people who nre iersunded to go that
route. What is called the "Skaguay
Tasw is no-pass at all it is simply forty
eight miles of mire. I never saw such
human suffering in my life as I witnessed
THE SUMMIT OP WniTK TAS9.
among the 1,200 people who nre now
enmped in Skaguay Paws. Not five per
cent of them will get over and the others
nre coming Kick. I found men only
twenty miles away from the town, and it
had taken them forty days to get that fnr.
Horses get down in the snow nnd mire
and hundreds of animals have their legs
broken nnd must be shot. The lxittoms
of the canyons are covered with the car
casscs of dead animals that have been
rolled over the cliffs. There will be much
suffering and starving this winter nmong
the ieople camping in Skaguay Pass. I
saw one poor man, who had mortgaged
his home in Seattle for $500, gave his
wife nnd children $150 to keep them this
winter, nnd spent $300 for his outfit. He
could not get across the fake pass and
returned to the town of Skaguay to sell
his outfit. The eight or ten outfitters of
that town all stand together, and he could
get no more than $40 for his outfit. The
MAIX 8THKET OF 8KAOUAT.
, , j
poor man saw that he had lost his home,
nnd he was broken hearted. I felt sorry
for him and gave him $100, and his elo
quent thanks were the tears that stream
ed down his cheeks. This is only one of
a hundred like cases, and, for humanity's
sake, the Skaguay Pass should be de
nounced as a fake of unscrupulous swin
dlers. The town of Skaguay is full of
dissolute characters.
