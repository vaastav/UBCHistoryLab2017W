SCUANTON, DECEMIJKn 6, 1899.
History repeats Itself in the South
African wnr In the conduct of the Out
landcrs, upon whose behalf thousands
of British soldiers have been hurried
to battle and to death. As In Cuba nt
the time of the Spanish war, the people
who made the most nolne and called
with greatest persistence for nld In
.-rushing their oppressors have not
been visible save In the localities In
the rear where army rations ure dis
tributed. It Is possible that too much
Hympathy has been In many Instances
wasted upon the Outlanders.
The Atessage.
THE PRESENT executive doeh
not aspire to brilliancy in
the composition of state pa
pers, but he does aim to ho
accurate, thorough and practical nnd
that, after all. Is real statesmanship.
Ills latest message to congress Is .1
document of some length, but upon
points in wntioversy Its arguments
am masterly and Its citation of infor
mation fairly conclusive. The length
of the message reminds us that our'r
Is becoming n country of gteat and
gieatly diversified Interests covering
each year nn increased scope; nnd
that expansion of presidential mes-r-nfjis
Is as inevitable as Is expansion
of mitlonul InlHtence and sovereignty
If the traditional character of the mes
sage as a review of the condition and
needs of the government shall be pre
served. A In go port of the message relates
to subjects more or less routine in
character; its essential portions are In
refeience to cunency reform, trusts,
our new dependencies and the Inter
national responsibilities and opportu
nities affected by them. While thei"
nre no surprise in the allusions to any
of these themes, the elaboration of ar
gument and advice on each subject In
dicates matured conviction and con
structive ability of a high order. On
currency reform the president stand
in line with the Intelligent opinion of
the day for the gold standard, for
abolition of the endless chain, for bet
ter banking facilities and for more
good money for use In the country's
expanding business. He argues wisely
that the time to prepare for seasons
of adversity is In the period of pros
perity. Th,e very fact that the finan
cial condition of the country today Is
without precedent In Its encouragement
constitutes a superior reason why ad
mitted defects In the structure of our
banking and cunency laws should u
lemedled and secured against the con
tingency of another evil day.
The president' view of the problem
of the trust" Is essentially judlclul.
First ascertain the fucts. Is Hie par
ticular combination or trust beneficial
or injurious? Does it or does it not
puppress ordinary nnd natural compe
tition? Does it or does It not unduly
enhance prices to the general consum
er? If no, then the inquiry ends. If
yes. find out how far the laws already
enacted can be enforced to protect th
general welfare; and If more legislation
is needed, formulate, discuss and pass
it. This In substance Is the president's
position. He offers for gallery-tickling
purposes no prestidigitator's titck
device to effect an ostensibly mlracu
lous cuie.
The large chapter In the message
Is devoted to foreign and insular rela
tions and Is worth reading in full. The
I.'nlted States Is now fully launched
upon its careen as a woild power and
the story of its points of contact with
the other nations is by no means de
void of Interest. The policy of the Mc
Kinley administration, as revealed In
tills portion of the message, is to gain
for American commerce and for Amer
ican achievement in general the amp
lest recognition possible. To this end,
the constant endeavor Is to cultivate
friendly lelatlons with all the other
powers. At the same time, where
firmness has been necessary to prevent
or to correct foreign unfairness to
American interests, it has forthcome.
This chapter on our foreign relations
Is a very agreeable chapter to those
who like to see their country respected
among the nations.
Lastly and chief In jnterest and Im
portance, we have me president vlewT
of policy and duty regarding the new
dependencies; and they are the morn
significant because In spite of threat
ened opposition they are practically
certain to prevail. We can summailzo
his elaborate argument briefly by say
ing that with respect to Cuba ho U
true to the full spirit of the pledge
upon which American Intervention was
based, but does not propose to abandon
Cuba until there Is a native govern
ment fit to exercise the functions of
sovereignty: that for Porto Pico he
wants abolition of trade obstacles and
provisional civil rule leading up to ttv)
territorial form of government: and
for the Philippines, continued trust in
the executive arm and unequivocal no
tification to whom It may concern
that the American Hag In that splendid
archipelago, having been hoisted by
destiny for the uplifting of humanity,
Is up to stav.
Wo are hearing something and soon
will hear more from the intelligent
leaders left in the Democratic party
nbout the unprecedented power at pres
ent lodged In the chief executive of th
United States. It Is unprecedented.
No other ruler ever lived who pos
sessed power and responsibility so far
reaching. William McKlnley today
controls an army, a navy and a forca
of elyil employes larger than any ever
previously, joljeetod .under JhP.AniJrlenn,
biinneravo-puihajis during the-admln-titration
o't Abraham 'Lincoln; nnd not
oven Lincoln nt the zenith of his career,
had a dominion so complex, so wide
reaching or so absolute. The will of
the mnn In the white house rules 10,
POO.000 dependents without check; It
largely dominates the Internal admin
istration of affairs In this great repub
lic: find as bearing upon the foreign
relations of our own nnd other lands
It Is Influential if not at times supreme.
It becomes worth our while, there
fore, to know how this exceptional
trust confided to him by the people Is
being administered and what princi
ples nnd policies govern the details of
its administration: and for this knowl
edge all must turn to the president's"
message, which we publish In full.

Governing Liquor Licenses.
IN THE COUNTY of Schuylkill,
with a population similar to our
own, an agitation having for it?
purpose, the lessening of crime,
has reached the newspaper stage. One
of the leading citizens of Schuylkill, Mr.
William Wllhelm, In n letter contrib
uted to the Miners' Journal, offers some
advice concerning this matter which !s
of considerable Interest.
"The principal cause of crime," says
he, "is the Indiscriminate granting of
licenses. The licensees take to the busi
ness for pecuniary profit, nnd the thou
sand and more licenses granted make
competition so sharp that they cater to
the criminal, the drunkard, the de
bauchee, and those of immature age in
their struggle to make the business
pay. Sales are made nt nil hours and
at all times, irrespective of the law, so
they but gather In the shekels'. The
evil is In our present method of grant
ing licenses to anybody nnd everybody
almost that makes application. There
are no rules or regulations laid down
by the court for Its guidance that in
any way restrict the number of licenses
granted or the character of places
licensed. This evil can be easily cor
rected, nnd all that will be necessary
for the motal forces of this county to
do is to formulate some plan nnd ask
the co-operation of the court. This can
be done by memorallzlng the court:
First Not to grant more than one
license for each thiee hundred (300
people, unless in townships it shall be
conclusively proven to the court that
on account of special topographical
conditions more hotels nre necessary.
Second That no place be licensed with
in five hundred (WO) feet of a church
or school house unless It Is a well
established hostelry that provides sleep
ing or eatlnir accommodations to the
traveling public. Third No naturalized
citizen to be given license unless such
person shall have been a citizen of the
county at least five years before the
license Is applied for. Fourth No per
son who has been convicted of n felony
shall have license."
In proof that he Is in earnest, Mr.
Wllhelm proposes to give his profes
sional services as nn attorney free oC
charge in th presenting of memorials
to court petitioning for the adoption of
these rules or uiles similar in kind.
The Idea outlined by him is a good one;
and It presents undoubtedly a favor
able starting point in a general move
ment toward better law and order. Put
we must not forget that back of the
saloon stands the saloon patron; mul
that something Is wrong with the man
who becomes a victim to saloon In
fluences. No cure will be effective
w hlch does not reach down to the bot
tom of the trouble and by providing
proper education for the children of
the poor, especially the children of
alien parents, who will recruit the next
generation of drunknrds and law
bieakeis unless they are led Into paths
of sobtlety and self-development, seek
to remove the cause, Regulation is
good, but prevention is better No
better way of improving society has
been discovered than by improving the
human units who compose It.
Representative Sibley, it is said, has
been entirely cured of the free silver
mania and not only acknowledges his
error, but claims to favor expansion,
as well. Mr. Sibley's temporary aber
ration has always been a puzzle tn
those who are aware hat he should
have known better nnd his return to
reason will give pleasure to friends in
both parties.

Into possession of a rcmaikable con
fidential circular Issue 1 on July 11 last
by Frelherr von P.luinbaden, then
PrusFlan district president of Dusssl
dorf and now Prussian minister of tint
interior. It had also been sent pre
viously by the Pmsslon minister of
tlie interior, the predecessors of Rheln
baden. to all burgomaslcts and coun
cilors In Prussiu. The circular reads:
"According to a circular of July u,
1S91, In the ministerial journal for In
ternal ndmlnlstrntlon regarding all In
quit ps on the part of foreign con
suls hiving exequatuts In partlculir
districts, administration official can
pnswer these question if the matter
Is not of general Importance that Is
treated In the questions. I'.utl'.ularly
this applies to Ameiicun consuls, to
whom communications which will in
jure our Interests should not be given,
regardless of whether tlu-se inquiries
are on questions of Importance or no.-.
When In doubt at all nny iltst Inquiry
vhruld not be jinswertl at ence, but
report slouU be nade to rise. Infor
mation which by no means should be
given to American consuls I note par
ticularly: Statistical facts relating to
violations of the foodstuffs law nnd Ita
subordinate laws, especially the man
ufacture and distribution of injurious
articles of food and drink; reports on
tho manufacturo and salu of poisonous
toys- Inquiries regarding trichinae and
hog meusles In domestic nxats, anil on
tho condition of human nnd animal dis
eases. There will bo no objection,
however, to giving Information regard
ing theso points by referring to the
regular statistical reports in tho pub
lications of the Imperial health depart
ment. The furnishing of ony other In
formation Is not permitted. I ear-
nestly request that this matter bn kept
strictly confidential,' nnd subordinate
officials 'should iilso bo similarly 'In
structed respecting the- ottremcly con
fidential nature of the mine. Tho ac
commodating of American consuls
should bo avoided nnd In nil rases of
doubt repoit to the government presi
dent." The right of the Prussian govern
ment to withhold Information from nny
foreign consul or diplomatic represen
tative in matters pertninlng wholly to
internal administration is unquestion
able; but this discrimination against
American consuls In particular con
trasts stranwely with the expression
of good will for America nnd Ameri
cans credited recently to the German
emperor and to some of his chief
lieutenants. It Is unlikely that tho
Prussian agrarian interests, who are
scared at the growth of American com
petition, will causj any friction be
tween the two nations; but as a side
light on German politics the foregoing
circular Is at least worthy of perusal.

tied to use them, and asks congress tcr
provide some way to circumvent me
efforts of the class of alleged publish
ers that has proved such an expense to
the postal system of the United States.
If Is estimated that a wastci of nearly
$20,000,000 yearly is occasioned by the
stuff In the way of fake publications,
advertising sheets, pample packages,
etc., that masquerades as second class
mall matter claiming cheap rates of
transportation to which only legitimate
publications In the way of newspapers
and magazines are entitled. The -work
of the postofilce department is greatly
hampered by the expense entailed in
handling this class of mail matter, and
the regular service is thus made to
suffer on account of the time consumed
in distribution. In most instances
these publications deserve to be ex
cluded from the malls entirely Instead
of being allowed to pose as second
class matter, and it Is time that con
gress takes steps to eradicate the evil,
which Is a drag on the entire postal
system of the country.

HUMAN NATURE STUDIES.
Cfay Gould's Costly Eggs.
In the Washington Post Leslie J.
Perry tells this reminiscence of Jay
Gould: While on one of his periodical
tours of Inspection of his Texas rail
roads, Mr. Gould and his small party
fell short of supplies, and were com
pelled by hunger to stop off for a meal
at one of the mushroom towns on the
line. The small board hotel was an
unpromising place; meals were 2
cents, the entire bill of fare being cof
fee, bacon and hot biscuits. The great
railroad magnate's weak stomach re
colled, and he asked the landlord if h3
couldn't hustle up a dozen eggs. The
reply was favorable; the eggs were
produced, and eagerly devoured, tho
party be4ng pretty well satisfied with
their dinner.
Mr. Gould handed out two silver dol
lars for their entertainment, about
double the "house's" regular rates, to
make the landlord whole for his extra,
trouble about the eggs. Whereupon,
without a blush, the Texan announced
that his bill was $30. Gould was stag
rered by tho cool effrontery of the
ruffian, but he recovered and mildly
expostulated against the exorbitant
charge. Hut nothing would shnke tho
obdurate landlord; he Insisted that tho
charge was reasonable and a justifi
able one. Mr. Gould casually remarked
during the progress of the dispute, that
eggs wete high out there; that they
must be pretty scarce. "No," prompt
ly replied the landlord, "eggs aro plenty
round nbout hyar, and cheap enough,
for that matter, but men who are nblo
to pay $no a dozen for eggs are pretty
d scarce!"
He Got His Mustard.
It was In the army. The boys had i
meal of beef that had been corned by a
bath In a salt-horse barrel. It was
quite a treat. They all thought so un
til one of the party remarked; "A
little mustard wouldn't go bad."
"That reminds me," said another.
"You just wait a few minutes."
A quarter of an hour later he re
turned and producing a screw of pa
per, he said: "Oh, yes; here's that
mustard,"
"Where did you get It?" said the
others in chorus.
"Up at tho surgeon's. The sick call
you remember, sounded ns we were
talking about tho mustard. It oc
curred to me that a little mustard for
my lame back would be just the
thing."
"Hut you haven't got any lame
back."
"Hut I have got' the mustard."

Tho Mate and the Bishop.
Speaking of swear stories, there Is a
mate on the Mississippi who stands
pre-eminent among his fellows from
Bt. Paul to New Orleans for his versa
tile, sustained and forcible profanity,
says the New Orleans Times-Democrat.
On a recent trip the boat stopped ,u
a way landing, and as tho roustabouts
took to the gangplank at a trifle too
leisurely pace the mate opened his
mouth and the atmosphere became livid
with sulphur and brimstone.
"For heaven'H sake, Mike!" exclaim
ed the captain In a hoarse whlspei
from the boiler deck, "for heaven's
sake Btow that! Why, man, Illshop
is aboard I Stow It, man, stow it,
till wo pnss gray Duck, where ho gets
off."'
A big pile of sacks was to get off,
and as tlia mate stood there with his
every faculty literally benumbed by
the rcstrnlnt put upon him, tho larklcs
at first worked In silent astonishment,
and then began distinctly to shirk. It
Is a well recognized fact all up and
down the Mississippi river that negroes
can't be made to work without being
"cussed," nnd this fact came home to
the mnte with telling force.
Grasping his stick with a firmer
clutch, he raised his big hoarse voice
and fairly thundered:
"HI, there, you nigger sons! Get
along there, you blank, blank, blank!
You know what kind of a blank I
mean. Confound you. get along now!"
And passengers on that boat say
tho darkles looked like black streaks
as they moved up and down the gang
plank after that, while the reverend
bishop, who had come to the rail,
looked on, nearly bursting his sldc3
with laughter,
The Commodore.
The school teacher In a country dis
trict near San Francisco Is a buxom
widow with nn Interesting bpy. Many
times she explained to her history
clnsss that she had named her son
Perry because of her great admiration
for Commodore Perry, whom she con
sidered one of the moot heroic charac
ters In American history. Among the
admirers of the pretty school teacher
was Dob Taylor, one of the trustees,
and his attentions to her had been ob
served by the school children. One
day she nsked her history class to
name a naval hero In the war of 1S12.
Not a pupil could name one. "Of
whom do I think a great deal'" she
nsked by way of refreshing tho memo
ries of her pupils. "Bob Taylor!"
shouted tho class In unison. Ever
since Bob Taylor has been known as a
commodore. San Francisco Post.
The Mysterious Part of It.
Johannes Gelert, the sculptor, was In
his studio one day when 'a man and
woman called. They were apparently
a well-to-do farmer and his wife, who
were making their first tour in the
world of art. The sculptor explained
to them the mysteries of .undellng and
casting. At the end the man said: "I
think I understand It pretty well now,
but there Is still one thing that puzzles
me." "What Is It?" asked the artist.
"I understand how a statue Is In the
piece of marble that you buy, but how
do you cut away the stuff which is
around it?"
Slightly Confused.
At a recent church dedication the in
vited preacher followed his sermon by
taking subscriptions for the balance
needed to pay for the building. As the
subscriptions proceeded one of the col
lectors announced:
"The five Black children, U!"
This the courteous money raiser
amended by saying:
"Five little colored people, $1!"
Amid an outburst of laughter tho
pastor hastily explained that the don
ors were white children by fthc name
of Black.
A Republican Hat.
Michael Joseph Barry, the poet, was
appointed a police magistrate In Dub
lin. An Irish-American, says a writer
in the Green Bag. was brought before
him, charged with suspicious conduct,
and the constable swore among other
things that he was wearing a "Repub
lican" hat.
"Does your honor Know what that
means?" Inquired the prisoner's lawyer
of the court.
"I presume," said Barry, "that it
means a hat without a crown."
Finest Tribute He Ever Had.
Edward Terry, the actor, tells of a
pretty incident that occurred duting a
tour In Australia, says the Detroit
Free Press. "Do you know what I
consider the most glowing tribute I
over received? The compliment cam"
from a child. There was a crowded
house, an" intent audience, and humor
had for the Instant given place to
pathos. You might have heard a pin
drop, and I felt tho tension of tho
house was at breaking point. The in
tense silence was broken by n childish
voice a girl's who, turning to her
parent, asked, in a broken voice:
'Mother, is It real?' "
