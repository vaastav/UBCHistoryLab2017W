YOUNG ZELAYA IS!
IN TR0U3LE TOO
His Difficulties Are M'.'ch Greater
Than Those of Hie Uncle, the
Dictator.
New York. Dec. 17. Seventeen let
ters full of picturesque . expressions
of a tropical love constituted part of
the evidence presented at the trial of
Miss Elizabeth Juliette Hero's breach
of promise suit against Dr. Anibal
Zelaya. The plaintiff said she had
chosen these from the mass of g
5
g .epistles she received from
Zelaya when he wooed her while at
tending Columbia University.
Zelaya is a nephew of the Nicara
guan dictator. Miss Hero insists he
is wealthy and that $10(1,000 is none
too high a price tor her disappointed
affections.
Zelaya's counsel is trying to prove
that, far from being blighted by the
discontinuance of. his client's devo
tion. Miss Hero accepted the atten
tion of others after Zelaya ceased his
courtship about two years ago.
When Miss Hero took the stand
Zelaya's lawyer assailed her with
questions about her alleged friend
ship with other men. She hotly de
nied that she had ever gone to a
dance with another youn-j Latin
American physician, Zelaya's friend,
and would not even admit she had
played checkers with him.
"I never loved anyone else," she insisted.-
She told how she had purchased a
trousseau two and a half years ago
expecting, she said, to become Mrs.
Zelaya within a month. The young
Central American's income at that
time, she said, was from ?S0 to $100
a month. This brought a question
from the defense:
"Do you know how much it costs
two to live?"
"No," replied Miss Hero, and later
she admitted that she did not know
even how much it costs to support one
She said she aid not visit young
Zelaya once when he was sick be
cause "she did not consider it proper."
The defense later turned the tables
on Miss Hero by producing letters
they said she had written to another
admirer.; One.began "Mv dear, dear
Eugene," and said:
"1 want to be true, especially to one
I love so dearly I-Want to share your i
sorrows as well, as your' joys and want
-to strive rt o, jnake -you happy."

POISONED MILK FOR
WHOLE FAMILY.
Union County Stockman Has Narrow
. Escape From Death Authori
ties Investigating.
Special to the New Mexican.
Clayton, N. M.t Dec. 17. What ap
pears to be an attempt to poison the
entire household of J. P. Miera, a
well-to-do stockman at Barney, Union
county, was reported today. Mr.
Miera came home,'.last evening and
made himself -t-pffee.V-"' He poured the
milk that was standing in the pantry
into his cup and drank it. A few min-
utes afterwards he . became violently
ill. A physician was called and with
great difficulty saved vMiera's life.
Suspicion of the.", physician being
aroused he gave some . of the milk
to two cats. Both drank but a little
and then keeled over in ; convulsions
dying in short time. It was evident
that a stranger had invaded the Tiouse
during the day and had poisoned the
milk with some virulent poison. A
chemical analysis will be made to de-
termine the nature of the poison. Mr.J
Miera::does not suspect any one of
tL'eaeed as he knows of no enemies
who would commit so dastardly an
act The Union county ;,. authorities
are investigating. i.::.U.,r':,J

Letter to Tax Commission.
My Dear Sir: The territorial board

to investigate the assessment and col

to 'make such recommendations as
they deem proper to said board,
I thrMicrli tlio torritnrlal Fnvemnr
In pursuance to' that reo.uest I have
this day appointed such a 1 commis-

j its duties.
-As, this commission is an unofficial

The commission should visit the
various counties of the territory, ex

selves of tha character and value of
property, both real and personal, and
on such information base their recom
mendations to the board of equaliza
tion and the governor for a more
equitable assessment and collection
of taxes In the territory.
I desire to call your attention to

of the board of equalization, and trust

It is a well known fact that we have
! a higher tax . rate than most of the
adjoining territories, and this condi
X tion is caused by the fact that our
X property is assessed at a ridiculously
X low valuation. Homeseekers and in -
X vestors coming into New Mexico with
X a view of locating here, invariably
make inquiries relative to our school

As a matter of f:ict.
the taxpayer i;i New Mexico is not j
pa ing any moie on the dollar than in,
the adjoining slates and territories.
The valuation has been so low that
the rate has necessarily become high.
Hut when the taxpayer understands
that reasonable increase in valuation
will reduce the rate. 1 think he will at
once realize the wisdom of the ac-
j lion.
1 sincerely hojtp that our constitu
tional convention, if we are admitted
j to statehood during the present ses
I sion of Congress, and if not, our ter
ritorial legislature, will limit the
amount of taxes that may- lie levied.
not only for territorial, but for coun -
! ty and municipal purposes, so the tax-
payer will readily see that by increas-
ing valuations, the present high tax
rate, especially in municipalities and
counties, woum not ne maintained.
The increase in values during the
past year and the probable increase
for the coining year, will enable the
territorial auditor to reduce the terri
torial tax rate materially, probably to
less than twelve mills.
The reenrriu in the miflirm-'s nfflee
and in the ofliee. nf ,ha varim,,, enn. i
ty collectors and treasurers through
out the territory, will be placed at
your disposal, and I shall instruct all
the district attorneys to co-operate
with you and assist you in every way
possible, and I will appreciate it if i
you will report to me any failure on
the part of any public official to ren
der you every possible aid in the pros

mission, and they will meet with you
and give you every assistance in their
power.
The work expected of you by virtue
of this appointment will not be profit
