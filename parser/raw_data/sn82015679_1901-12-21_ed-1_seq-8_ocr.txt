Carnegie SnLI in Re Helping the AVn
bash Gettlre Into IMItahnrR Gen
eral and Personal Notes.
A number of railroad officials have re
ceived from the secretary of the American
Railway Association a list of seven ques
tions affecting the problem of charges for
cars on foreign lines. At the last meeting
of the association in St. Louis the commit
tee on car service was instructed to take
up the matter of per diem versus mileage
charges and be prepared to report at the
next meeting. Practically every railroad of
importance has representation, and the
results of their deliberations possess much
weighL There is every reason to believe
that the larger systems will make a deter
mined effort to have the per diem charges
put into effect. Cars tied upon railroads
and not returned promptly, despite the
urgent need, has been more manifest of late
than heretofore, and some more effective
method of fines in the mileage system now
In use must be adopted. Query is made in
the seven questions for the difficulties liable
to be met in the practical operations of tho
per diem system of charges, with sugges
tions to obviate these dilcultles.
Assisting; the Wabash.
Since the Wabash has undertaken to get
into Pittsburg there has been much specu
lation as to who is behind the movement,
and the Impression now prevails that An
drew Carnegie, who has been buying large
blocks of Wabash stocks and debentures
and telling his friends that the Gould com
pany had a good future before it, is the
man. In this connection it is recalled that
shortly before the disposal of his mills and
railroad to the steel trust, Mr. Carnegie
had a sharp light with the Pennsylvania,
because of the latter's rate on the trans
portation of steel, and he set about to get
a road of his own to tidewater. That was
the time he made the deal to give that com
pany a quarter of the entire tonnage of
the Carnegie Company, but instead of one
million tons of freight, as was supposed
at that time. the. contract called for more
than four million tons a year. This would
mean a net revenue to the Wabash of at
least ll.OUO.000. Whether this new story of
Carnegie lending a helping hand to Gould
to gain an Eastern outlet is true or not,
the fact remains that the Wabash mystery
must soon be solved.
A Frosperons Yenr for the Honds.
The year nearlng its close marks one of
the most important in the history of the
railroads, not on account specially of build
ing, but because of the enormous amount of
equipment orders given. From the begin
ning of the year up to the present time the
car and locomotive works have all been
kept working to their fullest capacity, and
even with the enormous output the roads
are still suffering severely. The trunk lines,
such as the New York Central and the
Pennsvlvania. have been so hart! pressed
for cars that they have had special agents
instructing shippers to unload and load
their cars swiftfy. but from present indi
cations the situation will not be improved
for some time. Within thirty days 622 loco
motives have born ordered, and several
thousand cars of different descriptions, and
each day brings new orders.
Like ft Department Store.
The Chicago Chronicle says: "Hereafter
the Burlington system is to be operated on
the principle of a department store. Every
representative cf the company has been ad
vised that he is to be sole manager of his
department, and that his protits and losses
will be charged to him instead of the rail
road company as a whole. Every repre
sentative, from the smallest up to the
president, will keep a strict account of his
department and submit monthly reports to
James J. Hill. This change in Burlington
methods will be made in order that the
auditings will correspond with the system
prevailing on the Great Northern road."
"Ciimt Iron" Not IInrI to Ilreak.
A cast-Iron agreement on freight rates
has been entered Into by the executive offi
cers of the roads operating between Chi
cago and the Missouri river. The officers,
who have been in conference in Chicago
for several days, yesterday signed what
they believe to be the strongest agreement
ever considered by representatives of
Western lines. One of the features of the
new deal will be the publication of all ex
port rates. Tho tariff for export shipments
have never been printed by these roads,
and publication of them is the best evi
dence of the strength of the new pooling
agreement.

Quakers who went to Greensboro, the Fale

The office of assistant to the president
of the Denver & Rio Grande system will be
abolished on Jan. 1 and George R. Kramer,
who has held the position since it was
created, will resign and become a personal
representative of George Gould on the
Colorado Midland.
The Southern shop officials have insti
tuted a boycott against Princeton (Ind.)
papers. Their reporters are barred from
the shops and from getting any official
news. This action was caused by two pa
pers publishing the story of a wreck which
some shopman had faked.
An official of the Erie Railway states
that the report of friction between Mr.
Underwood and other officials of the Erie
is unfair to him and to the company. On
the main points of his policy Mr. Under
wood is following out the line marked out
by Chairman E. B. Thomas.
J. H. Glover, secretary of the Jewett car
works, and formerly superintendent of the
Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at Connells
ville. Pa., was found dead in his office at
Newark, O.. on Friday, with a bullet hole In
his head. It was evidently a case of sui
cide, lie left a widow, but no children.
Traffic officials of Western roads say
there will be a big decrease in freight earn
ings this month in comparison with De
cember of last year, the principal cause
being the war on west-bound freight be
tween Chicago and St. Louis. The surprise
Is that with the car shortage there should
be any rate cutting.
Sumner J. Collins, who Is to be the gen
eral superintendent of the Toledo, St. Ix)ui3
& Western, a position that President Nor
ton has been filling temporarily, is on a
trip over the line. Ho was in Frankfort,
Ind., on Thursday and visited the shops,
etc. Mr. Collins has been general man
ager of the Wisconsin Central.
In the case of L. L. Rogers vs. the
Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Com
pany the ' Railroad Commission of Ar
kansas has established an important pre
cedent. The decision is in effect that the

point of destination, whether it be state or
interstate.
No action was taken at the meeting of
directors of the Wabash Railway Com
pany yesterday relative to interest on the
debenture B issue of the company's securi
ties. It had been reported that by sur
render of the right of the debentures to 6
per cent, interest, if earned, the holders
would receive a lower fixed Interest, but
the subject was not taken up.
G. S. McKee, master mechanic of the Wa
bash, has - made several changes at the
shops under his Jurisdiction. George W.
Smith, general foreman at Tilton, suc
ceeds Thomas B. Hindle as general fore
man at the Peru shops, and Z. A. Baird,
superintendent of the roundhouse, is pro
moted to general foreman at the Tilton
shops. Each change is in the line of pro
motion. The Columbus. Sandusky & Hocking Rail
road, running through Shawnee and San
dusky to Columbus, O., will be sold in the
United States Court on Tuesday next. The
prospective bidders and the probable pur
chasers of the road will be the Ohio Central-Hocking
Valley combination, and if It
succeeds in getting control of the property
the long talked of consolidation of Ohio
coal roads will be effected.
The resignation of Harry W. Ashley as
general manager of the Toledo & Ann Ar
bor Railway is much of a surprise. He
began his career in the railroad business
with the Ann Arbor twenty years ago In
a clerical position in the auditor's depart
ment. The last twelve years he has been
general manager of the property, and his
aggressive policy and keen foresight have
placed the Ann Arbor in the front of To
ledo lines.
The Baltimore & Ohio has announced
that hereafter it proposes to dispense with
the services of middlemen in handling Its
tourist business. To take the place of the
middlemen a book of coupons will be issued
which can be used for railroad fare, side
trips, meals, transfer charges and hotel
bills. Under the new arrangement the rail
roads hope to turn into their passenger re
ceipts the money that has been paid the
tourist agents.
No 'road in this country has been more
aggressive and made greater progress than
has the Southern Railway since organized
in 1S94. It has built up an immense system,
covering practically the whol South east
of the Mississippi, and has put the system
into good physical condition. An official of
the read says that traffic possibilities be
fore it are immense. The territory is build
ing up rapidly and industrial plants have
been located along the line.
Samuel B. Sweet, general freight agent
of the Lake Erie & Western, and Ford
Wood, general freight agent of the Peoria
& Eastern,, returned from Chicago yester
day, where they attended a three days
meeting of the Central Freight Associa
tion. The gentlemen state that much time
was occupied in discussing the car short
age question, every line being short ot
cars, and it was agreed that a per diem
charge was the remedy for a faster move
ment of cars.
A. M. Walte, superintendent of motive
power of the New York Central, has been

Michigan Central, the Nickel-plate, th Big
Four, the Lake Erie fc Western and the
Boston & Albany. It Is intended to hold
meetings every other month for the pur
pose of discussing mechanical matters per
taining to railroads.
A report is again persistent that a traffic
organization of the Baltimore & Ohio lines
west of Pittsburg is to be brought about
by the first of the year. The report is
based upon the fact that the jurisdiction of
D. B. Martin, passenger traffic manager of
the B. & O., has already been extended
over the Pittsburg & Western and the Ohio
River Railroad, leaving only the Balti
more & Ohio Southwestern, the Cleveland,
Lorain & Wheeling ami the Cleveland Ter
minal & Valley yet to be included.

CHECKED BY THE COLD
TRADE IX MAX Y LINES SHOWS COX
SIDERAI1LE DULLNESS.
Commission Merchants Are the Great
est Sufferers Grocers Ho a Gooil
Business Light Grain Arrivals.
Trade in holiday lines of goods Is some
what retarded by the unusually cold
weather for this season of the year. Espe
cially is this true on Commission row.
Yesterday found dealers waiting for more
moderate weather to make shipping possi
ble without freezing. Plenty of orders are
booked to be filled as soon as it is safe to
let stock leave the stores. Oranges are in
excellent demand and are so reasonable
that they! are meeting with large sale.
Irish potatoes are weaker, the weather
being too cold to ship them any distance.
Jersey sweets are firm. Higher prices are
predicted for cabbage and onions, as much
stock is reported as frozen. The tone of
the butter market is very firm, especially
for choice stock. Supplies are short of
the demand. Cheese Is meeting with bet
ter sale. Eggs are in active request at
the advance of Tuesday, and some sales
are reported above prices quoted. Receipts
of poultry, especially of chickens, are light.
Turkej-s are wanted in large numbers for
next week, and are expected to begin to
arrive to-day. But few ducks are coming
in, though there is a good demand. Rab
bits are in good supply at prices quoted,
which seem firm for the time being. The
wholesale grocers are having a good trade.
Soft sugars are weak at the reduced quo
tations of Wednesday. The reduction in
price is said to be due to an over supply.
Molasses and syrups are firm at quotations.
Coffee is steady and moves well. Flour
continues firm at quotations and moves
fast. In canned goods tomatoes are mov
ing slowly. Retail merchants buy cau
tiously, while for corn and peas there is
an active demand. Dried fruits are active
and the demand for evaporated fruit is im
proving. Hog products are moving well
and prices rule steady, and on most lines
firm. The dry goods houses, the hat and
cap dealers and milliners are experiencing
quiet times, it being between seasons in
these lines. Confectioners are very busy
and will be until the holidays.
Indianapolis Grain Market.
Receipts of grain are light even lighter
than last week. Farmers still hold their
cereals, expecting that the highest figures
have not yet been reached. Oats and hay

This Will Interest You.
In a word, we lay this copy In your hand
and leave all criticism and wonder to you.
The various Txed departments of our sup
plement rrisazlne are especially pointed
out. They will be conducted week by week
by the same fertile minds that conceived
the current Installments, and, when the
Intensity of Interest shows the slightest
diminution, new fields will be entered.
Nothing pernicious to religion, politics 0
morals will ever enter Into the make-up
of our NEW ERA Supplement, as whole
some Instruction and entertainment la lis
foremost and lasting aim. The lowest
priced magazine, often with undesirable
subject matter, will coat you 5 cents.
The NEW ERA Magazine Supplement
will always be found absorbingly fascinat
ing both in a literary and Illustrative point
of view. The wonderful transformation
effects are either highly Instructive or
amusing and at all times undeniably en
tertaining. The Hall Process employed la

Things that children should know art
made to rise up from the blank pages, and
lifelike object lessons will Impress them

Instructions for transformation effects.
The subject matter, as you will observe,
consists primarily of a new kindergarten
method of evolution Instruction for the
little ones to be graduated week by week
to meet the requirements of little minds.
By this method children readily learn la
a few weeks what formerly required
months to teach them.
The department for women win oontata
a wide and authentio range of fully de
scribed and beautifully Illustrated styles.
Art needlework, household economy and
matters Interesting to women are fully
treated, tersely and unäerstanfilngly, con
ducted by authorities you have confidence
in. Christmas matter has temporarily
crowded out this department.
Other features of this work are of numer
ous variety. What each nation is particu
larly fond of as an article of food Is con
jured up from blank space with humorous
effect. The man who dropped down one
hundred feet without a bruise Is shown In
