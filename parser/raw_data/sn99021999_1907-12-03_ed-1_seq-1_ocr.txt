CORTELIOU'S PLAN FAVORED
Leaders of House Inclined to Push
Currency Legislation.
TO HEAD OFF BUNS ON BANKS
Senators' Optaloa Net Yet Crystallised
Financial Qaontlons Com
mittees Will Be
Caaagea.
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Deo. 1 (8pec!al.)-Un-lcss
there are too many oooka to apoll the
financial broth and too many recipes for
making ths mixture, congress will at
the coming session do something with the
ftnencial leglslstlon wTjlch has been talked
of so much during the past three or four
years.
Unfortunat-!v 'Vore are at least a doien
men In the lum, . -4Ch with a scheme of
bis own. and K u.ways has been dlffcult
to bring about anything like unanimity of
action tn the committee on banking and
currem-y. In which body the panacea for
financial ills must originate. But thle time
It looka aa though the leaders of the house
sill Insist upon the adoption In a mo.lllle.d
form at least of the suggestions of Secre
tary Cortelj-ou. Thatgentleman has given
a great deal of thought and consideration
to the outline of a currency bill which
meets with the approval of the financial
Interests of the country as well as of the
president. This bill will be offered Just
as snon ss the committees are appointed;
and It Is understood to be the purpose
of Speaker Cannon to change the per
aonnel of the committee on banking and
currency so aa to assure less bickering
and fewer controversies In . that sub-body
of the house than has been the rule In
the recent pest. Representative Fowler
of New Jersey, who was chsirman of tills
committee In the last congress, openly at
tacked the action of. Secretary Cortelyou
In authorising the Issuance of $100,000,000 of
treasury certificates, and his untimely crit
icism will. It Is believed, result In his
elimination as a factor In the preparation
of financial legislation.
Senators of Many Minds.
And yet, . while it Is possible for the
leaders of the house to secure the early
adoption of a currency bill which will
meet with the approval of the adminis
tration, the outlook for tho endorsement
of the action of the house by the senate
Is by no means bright. There Is scarcely a
senator who has appeared In Washington
thus far who has not glvn utterance to
views upon the financial situation, and
these views Indicate that the divergence
of opinion among tha members of the up
per branch of congress is as great a It is
among the members of the house. But
while the house can be controlled by the
committee on rules, there Is no cloture In
the senate; and even though ths soeaksr
should be able to get a financial bill
through the lower branch It will be months
before such action can be taken by the
senate.
, la, the meantime there are likely to be
a number of measures proposed, not only
far the our of the financial tils ' from
whloh the country has suffered daring the
past few week, but also with' a view to
making runs on national banks' practic
ally Impossible, and this wl'l t done
by some sort of an Insurance proposition.
Senator Thomas H. Carter of Montana
voiced the sentiment of a number of mem
bers of the senate In both political bodies
when he expressed the view that runs on
banks might b eliminated by a very aim
pie process.
To Avoid Rill oa Ranks.
"During the forty years of the existence
of national banks," said Senator Carter,
"the loss to depositor has amounted to
less than one-tenth' of 1 per cent of the
average deposits. It would seem, there
fore, that If a tax of, say, one-quarter of
1 per cent of the averag yearly depniit
should bs assessed against the banks
holding national charters a fund would
thereby he created which would ensblo
the comptroller of the currency to abso
lutely Insure depoltor against Iohs, and
with such assurance the depositor would
r.ever become alarmed to a degree suf
ficient to Induce him to start a "run." Oon
fid'snc In the national banking system
would by this means be so firmly estab
lished that tho condition which have ex
isted during the last month or six wseks
would nsver occur again. Thousands of
million of deposit have been withdrawn
and placed in safe deposit vaults, old
stocking and teapot, with the result
that the circulation ha been materially
reduced. Now, If tha depositor of a na
tional bank couid be assured that bis
funds Were safe be would not be alarmed
whenever there 1 a flurry and would not
rush to th bank to withdraw hla cast.
One-quarter of 1 per cent on deposit
would be uf Solent to create a fund which
would be In the nature of a governmental
lnauranos, and this tax oould be reduc d
as th tunda accumulated. In fact. It
would be easy to provide that the tax
should cease altogether when the surplus
in this Insurance fund reached the stage
where further additions should b uu
necessary. Prwlaloms Are Htajhor.
Whil th housekeeper of Chicago,
New Tork and other center of population
war elated ' on Thursday morning when
they read that the prlo of meats and
poultry had beea reducad several cents a
pound, th people of the city of Wash
ington were correspondingly depressed,
and th reason la easy to understand.
Soma two or three week aso th press
dUpatchos from Omaha announorj that
th Cudahy Packing company kad re
duosd ths wholesale price of meats, anl
the fwllowlng day the retailer of Wash
ington Increased their price to the con
sumer. But now while It 1 reported thst
Armour & Company hav Issued a circular
noting general reduction all along the
lino In th price of their products the
Washington housekeeper fears It mean a
further Inoraao to team, it I a notori
ous fact that right her at th national
capital where th trust machinery la put
la operation th cltlaena and sojourners
are held up by th retail provision trust
and oompelled to pay higher prices for
similar good than are paid by any other
olty of equal els In th United Statea
Chrlataaa Bxoauroteas.
Every year or two the commercial people
of Washington take a splurge and decide
to branch out to eaptur trade from all th
surrounding country. This year a commit
tee of th Washington Chamber of Com
mero ha been formed far th purpose of
Invlt'tur th residents of th town and

WASHINGTON. Dec. I In a report to
th attorney general concerning his find
ings relating to peonage In the south. At
slutsnt Attorney General Chsrles W. Rus
sell makes a strong recommendation that
the federal ststute relating to slavery be
amended In a manner which will deatroy
all doubt as to the meaning of "Invol
untary servitude" a set f-vth therein. He
also suggests changes in state laws.
"It Is hoped," said Mr. Russell, "thst
an enlightened self-Interest and the de
mand for labor made necesssry by th
expansion of old Industries and ths In
troduction of new will lead to the amend
ment or repeal of the state laws which
are the chief support of peonag prac
tices. "Thes stste laws take varlou forms
and are used In various ways to uphold
peonage and other kinds of Involuntary
servitude. Some of them ar vsgr'.ncy
lawa, son: contract labor or employment
laws. Borne fraudulent pfdnse or false
promise laws, and there are divers others.
Rome few of those In question, such as ab
sconding debtor laws, labor enticing and
board bill laws, were not originally passed
to an-tlavo workmen, but tn view of the
use to which they are put need amendment
in order that they cannot be so sbused.
"These laws are used to threaten work
men who, having been defrauded Into go
ing to an employer by false reports aa to
the conditions of employment and the sur
roundings, naturally become dissatisfied aa
soon as they find how they have been de
frauded. They are used before Juries and
the local public to hold the peons up as
law-breakers and dli honest persons seek
ing to avoid their Just obligations, and to
convince patriotic Juries that the defend
ants accused of peonage should not be
convicted for enforcing. at"lll les for
threatening to enforce, the law of their
state.
"Whether constitutional or unconstitu
tional, they should all be wiped out, or so
amended as to be harmless for the purpose
of enslaving workmen."

WASHINGTON, D. C. Dee. 1 A brllllaas
scene characterised the meeting of t;e Six
tieth conrrers today. In the S'" ate and

gatherings In the ralle-los of repreemta
tlve of the official society of the capital.
The coming together for the first time of
the men who l ave been elected to the sen
ate end the house, about 100 of whom havt
not before served In congress, made th
invasion one of particular Interest.
Th striking scenes of th day were In
tho house of representatives, where tha
format selection of Joseph G. Csnnon nneln
to be spesker cf that body and th desig
nation by the democrats of John 8hari
Williams as their leader, wer occasion
for ovations for those gentlemem. Th
vast hall of th house of representative
rang with the cheora of republicans and
democrats for thlr lesders, and th
spesker received as warm a reception from
members of the minority as he did from
his own party.
The appearance of William Jennings
Bryan on the house floor also was the oc
casion for enthusiastic cheering by th
democrats.
When the adoption of rules for th gov
eminent of tha house during the Sixtieth
congress cam up, the rules of th 'sat
congress were opposed by John Sharp
Williams, and ho wss Joined In the opposi
tion by democrats and by a single republt.
can, Mr. Cooper of Wisconsin. The old
rules were declared to be too autocratic,
placing too much power In th hands of
the apeaker, but after a somewhat acri
monious discusion they were adopted by
party vote.
Committees were appointed by botlt
houses to Inform tha president thst con
gress had . met and was ready to reoelv
any message he might wish to oommunl
cate.
New senators and representatives wer
sworn In and both houses adjourned out of
respect to the memory of members who

the Interest of republican government te
many crises, whether of peace or war,
adversity or prosperity.
"Each generation fo statesmen has had
Its own peculiar problems and It own
particular embarrassment. No problems
of government ever recur In exactly th
same way. Th formulas of action In on
