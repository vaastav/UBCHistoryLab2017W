Taft—His Exciting Message
President Taft's first regular message to congress is strictly
'in accord with our conception of th. personality of the author,
It is n smoothly written, placid document, couched in sonorous
generalities and breathing an air of adipose optimism, such a**
hvotib! naturally he expected from a peace-loving, self-satisfied
Juan. "
The message is peculiar in what it does not say, more so
than by reason of what it docs. The larger questions of gov
ernment and policy which are now engaging earnest public
attention have been reset for other occasions and separate
treatment, leaving for consideration today those matters of
polity on which the president has often expressed his views
and .about which there has never been any - serious dis
agreement.
Apprehension over the possible domination of Manchuria
by Japan has never beta poignant or general; of the Niearaguan
difficulty we have been well informed "by the daily press; our
interest in the Congo has been sentimental and academic; the
North Pacific seal question interests ua but slightly; tit re
duction in the running expenses of the government will meet
with approval, -it hardly in proportion to the figure- given.
'As- to old age industrial pensions, postal savings banks,
the •accelerating and cheapening "' civil and criminal justice,
restrictions on the nuance of injunctions, revision of second
class mail rat.- all these arc old presidential standby*, They
arc tin- "property" subjects, treated mot, or leas expansively
in every message, having been carefully handed down froirt
administration to administration unimpaired.
The latest presidential message, eviscerated to liii- extent.
is left but a shell in which there is small matter for expectation
or consolation.
In conclusion the president deals with the increased cost of
living in a rather amateurish fashion. His reference to this
topic is for the purpose of justifying the new tariff law, and
absolving it from all blame for the disparity between the in
come and outgo of that unfortunate who bears the euphemistic
name of the "ultimate consumer." Here again the Taft penchant
for generalities asserts itself to no good purpose. It has long
since been recognized that errors lurk in generalities, even fraud
and deceit. The man who cannot strike a proper balance be
tween what he earns and what he expends will pass the presi
dent's views on this question as unimportant.
«From any other executive than President Taft, this mes
sage would have * been a disappointment. As it is, it. is
negligible.
