Washington, Dec. 3.—Following is the
message of President Roosevelt, read in
Congress today:
To the Senate and House of Representa
tives:
The Congress assembles this year under
the shadow of a great calamity. On the
6th of September, President McKinley was
shot by an anarchist while attending "the
Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo and
died in that city on the 14th of that
month. g
Of the last seven elected Presidents, he
is the third who had been murdered and
the bare recital of this fact is sufficient
to Justify grave alarm afnong all loyal
American citizens. Moreover, the circum
stances of this, the third assassination of
ac American President, have a peculiarly
sinister significance. Both President
Lincoln and President Garfleld were killed
by assassins of types unfortunately not
uncommon in history, President Lincoln
falling a victim to the terrible-passions
aroused by four years of civil war, and
President Garfleld to the revengeful van
ity of a disappointed office seeker. Presi
dent McKinley was killed by an utterly
depraved criminal belonging to that body
of criminals who object to all govern
ments, good and bad alike, who are against
any form of popular liberty if it 1« euar
anteed by even the most Just and liberal
laws, and who are as hostile to the up
right exponent of a free people's sober
will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible
despot.
McKINLEY, THE MAN.
It is not too much to say that at the
time of President McKinley's death he
was the most widely loved man in all the
United States; while we have never had
any public man of his position who has
been so wholly free from the bitter ani
mosities incident to public life. . His po
litical opponents were the first to bear the
heartiest and most generous tribute to
the broad kindliness of nature, the sweet
ness and gentleness of character which
so endeared him to his close associates.
To a standard of lofty Integrity in public
life he united the tender affections and
home virtues which are all-important In
the makeup of national character. A gal
lant soldier in the great war for the Un
ion, he also shone as an example to all
our people because of his conduct in the
most sacred and intimate of home rela
tions. There could be no personal hatred
of him, for he never acted with aught
but consideration for the welfare of oth-
ers. No one could fail to respect him
who knew him in public or private life.
The defenders of those murderous crim
inals who seek to excuse their crimin
ality by asserting that it is exercised for
political ends, inveigh against wealth and
irresponsible power. But for this assas
sination even this base.apology cannot
be urged.
President McKinley was a man of mod
erate means, a man whose stock sprang
from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who
had himself belonged among the wage
workers, who had entered the army as a
private soldier. Wealth was not struck
at when the President was assassinated,
but the honest toil which is content with
moderate gains after a lifetime of unre
mitting labor, largely in the service of
the public. Still less was power struck
at in the sense that power is Irresponsible
or centered in the hands of any one In
dividual. The blow was not aimed at
tyranny or wealth. It was aimed at one
of the strongest champions the wage
worker had ever had; at one of the most
faithful representatives of the system of
public rights and representative govern
ment who has ever risen to public office.
President McKinley filled that political
office for which the entire people vote,
and no President—not even Lincoln him
self —was ever more earnestly anxious to
represent the well thought-out wishes of
the people; his one anxiety in every crisis
was to keep in closest touch with the
people—to find out what they thought
and to endeavor to give expression to
their thoughts after having endeavored
to guide that thought aright. He had
just been re-elected to the Presidency be
cause the majority of our citizens, the
majority of our farmers and wage-work
ers believed that he had faithfully up
held their interests for four years. They
felt themselves in close and intimate
touch with him. They felt that he rep
resented so well and so honorably all
their ideals and aspirations that they
wished him to continue for another four
years to represent them.
A BASH DEED.
And 'Ms 1 was the • man at whom ; the as
sassin struck! That there might be noth
ing;? lacking to complete the Judas-like
nfamy of his act, he took advantage
occasion when the President was
meeting the people generally; «and ? ad-
Sricinf M lfrto take the hand outstretch
ed' to him in kindly and I brotherly fellow
ship he turned the noble and generous
cdnflden^rof.the^ictlmilnto^opportaj-,
to strike the fatal blow. Thereill no

ered ( between life and i death At last the
light was stilled in the kindly eyes and
the breath went from the lips that even
in mortal agony uttered no words save
of forgiveness to his murderer, of love
forjbl»t friends, and of unaltertng 1 I trust in
he will of the Most High Such a deattu
crowning the glory of such a Ufe,
us with infinite sorrow, but with _sucn
pride in what he accomplished 5 and
fn his own personal character, that we
feel the blow not as struck at him but

deWberat. «««MOs«^ JL^yKSrSbl
sensatloaallsm, and to os» «*•■■ •""" "^"^
ish visionary who. for whatever reason,
apologizes for crime or excites aimless
discontent.
The blow was aimed not at this Presi
dent, but at all Presidents; at every sym
bol of government. President McKinley
was as emphatically the embodiment of
the popular will of the nation expressed
through the forms of law as a New Eng
land town meeting is in similar fashion
the embodiment of the law-abiding pur
pose and practice of the people of the
town. On no conceivable theory could
the murder of the President be accepted
as due to protest against •'inequalities in
the social order." save as the murder of
all the freemen engaged in a town meet
ing could be accepted as a protest against
that social inequality which puts a male
factor in jail. Anarchy is no more an
expression of "social discontent" than
picking pockets or wife-beating.
The anarchist, and especially the an
arhist in the United States, is merely
one type of criminal, more dangerous
than any other because he represents the
same depravity in a greater degree. The
man who advocates anarchy directly or
indirectly, in any shape or fashion, or the
man who apologises for anarchists and
their deeds, makes himself morally acces
sory to murder before the fact. The an
arcist is a criminal whose perverted in
stincts lead him to prefer confusion and
chaos to the most beneficent form of so
cial order. His protest of concern for
workingmen is outrageous in its impudent
falsity; for if the political institutions of
this country do not afford opportunity to
every honest and intelligent son of toil,
then the door of hope is forever closed
against him. The anarchist is everywhere
not merely the enemy of system and
progress, but the deadly foe of liberty. If
ever anarchy is triumphant, its triumph
will last for but one red moment to be
succeeded for ages by. the gloomy night
of despotism.
ALL THE POWERS SHOULD ACT.
I earnestly recommend to the Congress
that ,in the exercise oT its discretion it
should take into consideration the com
ing to this country of anarchists or per
sons professing principles hostile to all
government and justifying the mund r of
those placed in authority. They and
those lik^ them should be kept out of this
country; and If found here they should
be promptly deported to th^ country
•whence they came; and far-reaching pro
vision should be made for the punishment
of those who stay. No matter calls more
, urgently for the wis st thought of the
Congress. •
The Federal courts should toe given jur
isdiction over any man who kills or at
tempts to kill the President or any man
who by the Constitution or by law is in
line of succession for -the Pr sidency,
while the punishment for an unsuccessful
attempt should be proportioned to the
enormity of the offense against our insti
tutions.
Anarchy is a /rime against the whol^
human race; and all mankind should band
against t£e anarchist. His crime s-hould
be made an offense against the law of
nations, like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the slave trade; for it
is of far blacker infamy than eith r. It
should be so declared by treaties among
all civilized powers. Such treaties
would give to the Federal Government thj
power of dealing with the crime.
COUNTRY'S 'PROSPERITY.
During the last five years business con
fidence has be n restored, and the na
tion is to be congratulated because of its
present • abounding prosperity. Such
prosperity can never be created by law
alone, although it is easy enough to de
stroy it by mischievous laws. If the
hand of the Lord is heavy upon any coun
try, if flood or dought comes, human wis
dom is powerless to avert the calamity.
Moreover, no law can guard us against
the consequences of our own folly. The
m n who are i-dle or credulous, the men
who seek gains not by genuine work with
head or hand, Wt by gambling in any
form, are always a source of menace, not
only to themselves, but to others. If the
business world loses its head, it los s
what legislation cannot supply. Funda
mentally the welfare of each citizen, and
therefore the welfare of the aggregate of
citizens which makes the nation, must rest
upon (individual thrift and energy, reso
lution and intelligence. NothiHg can
take the place of this individual capacty;
but wise legislation and Honest and in
tellig nt administration can "give Jt the
fullest scope, the largest opportunity to
work to good effect.
The tremendous and highly complex In
dustrial development which went on with
ever ace lerated rapidity during the lat
ter half of the nienteenth century brings
us face to face, at the beginning of the
twentieth, with very serious social prob
-1 ms. The old laws, and the customs
which had almost the binding force of
law -were once quite sufficient to regu
late the accumulation and distribution of
wealth. Since the industrial changes
which have so enormously increas d the
productive power of mankind, they are no
longer sufficient. The treation of great
corporate fortunes has not l>een due to
th' tariff nor to any other governmental
action but to natural causes in the busi
ness world, operating in other countries
as they operate in our own.
The President counsels moderation in
dealing with the subject of corporations.
The mechanism of modern business is so
delicate that care must be taken not to
Interfere with ie in a spirit of rashness
or ignorance. , , .
The first essential in determining how
to deal with the great industrial com
binations Is knowledge of the facts
nnhliHtv In the interest of the public,
fhe government should have the right
to inspect and examine the workings of
the great corporations engaged in \p
eratlte business. Publicity is the ojly
sure remedy which we can now invoke
What further remedies are needed in the
way of governmental regulation, or tax
ation can only be determined after pub
licity has been obtained, by process of
aw and in the course of administration.
The first requisite is knowledge, full and
complete— knowledge which may be made
public to the world.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION.
Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and Joint stock *or other associations,
depending » upon v any •* statutory 4 laws for
their existence or privileges, should be
subject to proper governmental 2, super
vision and full and accurate information

£ The large corporations commonly called

to get adequate tegulation through state
action. Therefore, in the interest of the
whole people, the ■ nation should, without
Interfering with the power of the states
in the matter Itself, also assume power of
supervision and regulation over all corpo
rations doing an Interstate business. This
Is especially true where the corporation
derives » a portion its wealth from the
existence of some monopolistic element
or tendency in its business. There would
be no hardship hi such supervision; banks
are subject to it. and in their case it i»

this question.
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.
The President recommends the crea
tion of a cabinet officer to be known as
Secretary of Commerce and Industries,
whose province sball be to deal with
commerce in its broadest sense, includ
ing among many other things whatever
concerns labor and all matters affecting
the great business corporations and our
merchant marine. He also recommends
the reenactment of the Chinese exclu-
sion law, and to strengthen it in what
ever particular is necessary to make its
enforcement entirely effective. Laws
'should also be passed which will do away
with the competition of convict labor In
the open market. Our present immigra
tion laws are declared unsatisfactory.
Intelligence should be a requisite for
admission to this country, as well as
sound bodily health and ability to earn
a good living. Both the educational and
economic tests in a wise immigration law
should be designed to protect and elevate
the general body politic and social. A
very close supervision should be exer
cised over the steamship companies
which mainly bring over the immigrants,
and they should be held to a strict ac
countability for any infraction of the law.
NO GENERAL TARIFF REVISION.
There is gene/al acquiescence in our
present tariff system as a national policy.
The first requisite to our prosperity is
the continuity and stability of this eco
nomic policy. Nothing could be more un
wise than to disturb the business inter
ests of the country by any general tariff
change at this time. Doubt, aprehension,
uncertainty are exactly what we most
wish to avoid in the interest of our com
mercial and material well-being. Our
experience in the past has shown that
sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt
to produce conditions closely approaching
panic in the business world. Yet it is
not only possible, but eminently desir
able, to combine with the stability of our
economic system a supplementary system
of reciprocal benefit and obligation with
other nations. Such reciprocity is an
incident and- result of the first establish
ment and preservation of our present Eco
nomic policy. It was specially provided
for in the present tariff law.
Reciprocity must be treated as the
handmaiden of protection. Our first duty
is to see that the protection granted by
•the tariff in every case where it is needed
is maintained, and that reciprocity be
sought for so far as it can safely be done
without injury to our home industries.
It is most important that we should
maintain the high level of our present
prosperity. We have now reached the
point in the development of our interests
where we are not only able to supply
our own markets, but to produce a con
stantly growing surplus for which we
must find markets abroad. To secure
these markets we can utilize existing
duties in any case where they 'are no
longer needed for. the purpose of protec
tion, or in any case where the article is
not produced here and the duty is no
longer necessary for revenue, as giving
us something to offer in exchange for
what we ask. The cordial relations with
other nations which are so desirable will
naturally be promoted by the course thus
required by our own interests.
I ask the attention of the Senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my
predecessor.
THE MERCHANT MARINE.
The condition of the American merchant
marine is such as to call for immediate
remedial action by the Congress. It is
discreditable to us as a nation that our
merchant marine should >be utterly insig
nificant in comparison to that ut other
nations which we overtop in other forms
of business. We should not longer sub
mit to conditions under which only a
trifling portion of our great commerce
is carried in our own ships. To remedy
this state of things would not merely
serve to tuild up our shipping interests,
but it would also result in benefit to- all
who are interested in the permanent es
tablishment of a wider market for Amer
ican products, and would provide an aux
iliary force for the navy.
Our government should take such action
as will remedy present inequalities. The
American merchant marine should t>e re
stored to the ocean.
OUR REVENUES.
The collection from duties on imports
and internal taxes continue to exceed
the ordinary expenditures of the govern
ment, thanks mainly to the reduced army
expenditures. The utmost care should be
taken not to reduce the revenues so that
there will be any possibility of a deficit;
but, after providing against any* such
contingency, means should be adopted
which will 'bring the revenues more near
ly within the limit of our actual needs.
Special attention is called to the need of
strict economy in public expenditures.
The interstate commerce law, the Presi
dent says, should 'be so amended that rail
road rates should be Just to and open to
all shippers alike. The government should
see to it that within its jurisdiction 'his
, is so and should provide a speedy, inex
pensive, and effective remedy to that end.
FOREST PRESERVATION AND IRRIGA
TION.
The practical benefits of forest preser
vation are touched upon, and the forest
and water problems are characterized as
perhaps the most vital internal questions
of the United States. Water
is dependent on forest conservation, and
proper legislation to this end should be
enacted. Natural storage reservoirs
should be constructed and controlled by
the government.
The reclamation of the unsettled arid
public lands presents a different problem.
The object of the government is to dis
pose of the land to settlers who will build
homes upon it. To accomplish this object
water must 'be brought within their reach.
The pioneer settlers on the arid public
domain chose their homes along streams
from which they could themselvse divert
the water to reclaim their holdings. Such
opportunities are practically gone. There
remain, however, vast areas of public
land which can be made available for
homestead settlement, but only by reser
voirs and main-line canals impracticable
for private enterprise. These irrigation
works should toe built by tbe national
government. The lands reclaimed by
them Bhould be reserved by the govern
ment for actual settlers, and the cost of
construction should so far as possible be
repaid by the land reclaimed. The dis
tribution of the water, the division of
the streams among irrigators, should be
left to the settlers themselves in con
formity with state laws or with vested
riphts. Tbe policy of the national gov
ernment should be to aid irrigation in the
several states and territories in such
manner as will enable the people in the
local communities to belp themselves,
and as will stimulate needed reforms in
the state laws and regulations governing
irrigation.
Whatever the nation does for the ex
tension of irrigation should harmonise
with, and tend to Improve, the condition
of those now living on irrigated land. We
are not at the starting point of this de
velopment. Over two hundred millions
of.private capital has already toeen ex
pended in the construction of irrigation
works, and many million acres of arid
land reclaimed. A high degree of enter
prise and ability has been shown in the
work Hself; but as much cannot be said
in reference to the laws relating thereto.
The security and value of the hones cre
ated depend largely on the stability of
titles to water; bat the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendered la ordinary suits at
tew. With a 4ew creditable exceptions,
the arid states have fatted to provide tor
the certain and Jnst division of stream
in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain
laws have made It possible to establish
rights to water in excess of actual uses
or necessities, and many streams have
already passed Into private ownership, or
a control equivalent to ownership.
NO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP.
Whoever controls a stream practically
controls the land it renders productive,
and the doctrine of private ownership of
water apart from land cannot prevail
without causing enduring wrong. The
recognition of such ownership, which has
been permitted to grow up in the arid
regions, should give way to a more en
lightened and larger recognition of the
rights of the public in the control and
disposal of the public water supplies.
Laws founded upon conditions obtaining
in humid regions, where water Is too
abundant to Justify hoarding it, have no
proper application in a dry country.
In the arid states the only right to
water which should be recognized is that
of use. In irrigation this right should
attach to the land reclaimed and be in
separable therefrom. Granting perpetual
water rights to others than users, without
compensation to the public, is open to all
the objections which apply to giving away
perpetual franohises to the public utilities
of cities. A few of the Western States
have already recognized this, and have
incorporated in their constitutions the
doctrine of perpetual state ownership of
water.
The benefits which have fo\Jowed the
unaided development of the past justify
the nation's aid and cooperation In the
more difficult and important work yet to
be accomplished. The larger development
which national aid insures should, how
ever, awaken in every arid state the de
termination to make its irrigation system
equal in justice and effectiveness that of
any country in the civilized world. Noth
ing could be more unwise than for iso
lated communities to continue to learn
everything experimentally, instead of
profiting by what Is already known else
where. We are dealing with a new and
momentous question, in the pregnant
years while institutions are forming, and
what we do will affect not only the pres
ent but future generations.
A careful study should be made, both
by the nation and the states, of the irri
gation laws and conditions here and
abroad.
CUBA AND PORTO RICO.
The prosperous conditions in Porto Rico
are briefly touched upon.
In Cuba such progress has been made
toward putting the independent govern
ment of the island upon a firm footing
that before the present session of the
Congress closes this will be an accom
plished fact. Cuba will then start as
her own mistress; and to the beautiful
Queen of the Antilles, as she unfolds
this new page of her desting, we extend
our heartiest greetings and good wishes.
Elsewhere I have discussed the question
of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba,
however, there are weighty reasons of
morality and of national interest why
the policy should be held to have a pe
culiar application, and I most earnestly
ask your attention to the wisdom, indeed
to the vital need, of providing for a sub-
Btantial reduction in the tariff duties on
Cuban imports into the United States.
Cuba has in her constitution affirmed
what we desired, that she should stand,
in international matters, In closer and
more friendly relations with us than with
any other power; and we are bound by
every consideration of honor and expe
diency to pass commercial measures in
the interest of her material well-being.

In : the Philippines our problem. is larg
er. : They are very rich tropical islands,
inhabited .by many varying tribes, rep
resenting widely; different stages of pro
gress toward J civilization.-; Our earnest
effort is -to help these people upward
along the stony and, difficult path that
leads to self-government. We hope to
make our administration of the islands
honorable to our nation by making it of
the highest benefit jto the Filipinos them
selves; f and 'as| an ; earnest of ' what -we
intend to > do, we : point • to ; what Iwe have

The signed treaty will at once be laid
before the Senate, and if approved the
Congress can then proceed to give effect

THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
Touching upon the Monroe Doctrine the
President says that should be the cardinal
feature oi the foreign policy of all the
nations of the two Amerkas. as It is of
the United States. Just seventy-eight
years have passed since President Monroe
In his annual message announced that
"The American continents are henceforth
not to be considered as subjects for fu
ture colonization by any European pow
er." In other words, the Monroe Doc
trine Is a declaration that there must be
no territorial aggrandizement by any
non-American power at the expense of
any American power on American soil.
It is in no wise intended as hostile to
any nation in the Old World. Still less Is
it intedded to give cover to any aggres
sion by one New World power at the ex
pense of any other. It is simply a step,
and a long step, toward assuring the uni
versal peace of the world by securing the
possibility of permanent peace on this
hemisphere. Our attitude In Cuba is a
sufficient guaranty of our good faith. We
have not the slightest deaire to secure
any territory at the expense of any of our
neighbors.
AS TO OUR NAVY.
The work of upbuilding the navy must
be steadily continued. No one point of
our policy, foreign or domestic, is more
important than this to the honor and ma
terial welfare, and above all to the
peace of our nation in th"c future. Wheth
er we desire it or not, we must hence
forth recognize that we have interna
tional duties no less than international
rights. Even if our flag were hauled
down in the Philippines and Puerto Rico,
even if we decided not to build the Isth
mian Canal, we should need a thoroughly
trained navy of adequate size, or else be
prepared definitely and for all time to
abandon the idea that our nation is
among those whose sons go down to the
sea in ships. Unless our commerce is al
ways to be carried in foreign 'bottoms, we
must have war craft to protect it.
Probably no other great nation in the
world is so anxious for peace as we are.
There is not a single civilized pow
which has anything whatever to fear from
aggressiveness on our part.
Our people intended to abide by the
Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon It as
the one sure means of securing the peace
of the Western Hemisphere. The navy of
fers us the only means of making our in
sistence upon the Monroe Doctrine any-
thing but a subject of derision to what
ever naiton chooses to disregard it. We
desire the peace which comes as of right
to the Just man armed; not the peace
granted on terms of ignominy to the
craven and the weakling.
It is not possible to improve a navy
after war breaks out. The ships must be
built and the men trained long in a I
van c. In the late war with Spain the
ships that dealt the decisive blows at
Manila and Santiago had been launched
from two to fourteen years, and they
were able to do as they did because the
men in the conning towers, the gun tur
rets, and the engine-rooms had through
long years of practice at sea learned how
to do their duty.
In this connection the President recom
mends that four thousand additional sea
men and one thousand additional marines
should be provided to man new ships.
The naval militia forces are state or
ganizations, and are trained for coast
service, and in event of war they will
constitute the inner line of defense. They
should receive hearty encouragement from
the general government.
THE ARMY.
It is not necessary to increase our army
beyond its present size at this time. But
it is necessary to keep it at the highest
point of efficiency.
Every effort should be made to bring
the army to a constantly increasing state
of efficiency. When on actual service no
work save that directly in the line of such
service should be required. The paper
work in the army, as in the navy, should
be greatly reduced. What is needed i«
proved power of command and capacity to
work well in the field. Constant care is
necessary to pjrevent dry rot in the trans
portation and commisaary departments.
Every promotion and every detail under
the War Department must be made solely
with regard to the good of the service and
to the capacity and merit of the man him
self. No pressure, political, social or per
sonal, of any kind, will be permitted to
exercise the least effect in any question
of promotion or detail; and if there is
reason to believe that such pressure is
exercised at the instigation of the officer
concernd, it will be held to militate
against him.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
I recommend the pasasge of a law which
will-extend the classified-servicei to;the
District of Columbia, or will at least en
able the President thus to extend .it In
my Judgment all laws providing for the
temporary employment of clerks should
hereafter ? contain „• a provision 1 that i they
be selected under the : civil service law.
It is important to have" this system oO
taln at home, trof.it is even more import
ant to have it \ applied rigidly:in .our in
sular possessions. -,i '• . . - iLl"*.'

THE OPENING DAY
SENATE AND HOUBE MEET AND
ORGANIZE.
Rules of the Last House Adopted With Slight
Amendment—Henderson Rcckcted Speak
er Without Opposition—Over Three Thou
sand Bills Introduced— Senate Opening Re
marfcablc for Display of Choice Flowers.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The organisation
of the Fifty-seventh congress wu accom
plished according to time-honored prrce
df>nts, and with only one little scrap,
which arose over the adoption of the
rules of the last congress, with slight
amendments.
Speaker Henderson was sworn in by
Gen. Bingham, and after delivering a
very graceful speech in recognition of
the honor bentowed upon him, he in turn
administered the oath to the memberv
elect The usual committees were ap
pointed to inform the president and the
senate that the house \v«a organised and
ready to do business; a committee of
three, consisting of Messrs. Payne, lling
ham and Richardson, was appointed to
join a similar committee of the senate
and wait upon the president and inform
him that congress was ready to receive
any communication he might have to
make: the rules of the last houtte were
adopted after the flight jar above men
tioned ami then the biennial seat-draw
ing occurred. This latter ceremony was
robbed of much of its interest by the fact
that under the new arrangement of seat*
there are more than enough to go round,
and those whose names are drawn hint
do not Hiiffer as they did on former occa
sions.
The flower show, which is the greatest
featujb of the opening day, was not as
imposing as usual. More than ever be
fore were sent to members, and after the
seat-drawing the house adjourned before
a third of them were brought into the
hall. Over three thousand bills were
introduced on the first day in the house.
PRINCIPALLY FLOWERS.
Display on Senatorial Desks the Principal
Feature of the Opening Session.
Washington. Dec. 3.—A profusion of
floral offerings quite unusual in quan
tity, variety and beauty, transformed
the senate chamber iuto a veritable
flower show. Almost every member of
the body was the recipient of one or
more of these evidences of the regard of
his friends, and the atmosphere of the
chamber was heavy with the odor of
rare plants and bloHsoms. The display
of chrysanthemums was notably beauti
ful, many of the specimens being of the
choicest varieties.
 After prayer ■ bjr the chaplain and the
appointment of the . usual •committee,

tion, which was withdrawn, adunittingf ree \
