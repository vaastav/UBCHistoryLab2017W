When Uncle Joo Dixon wandered

t did not despair of getting him back
U1Jot for itself at least for Florida
and finally locating the old fellow in
S
oae of his native haunts over in the
l great state of Mississippi we roped
r sad tied him and brought him to
JFlorlda once more We hoped to
p kep UHcle Joe on The Journal where
Ills charming style would always
cr5m tho readers of this paper but I
tkscaii of the simple lifo which he
i adlived so long over at Live Oak
as too strong and he leaves today
f for that place where the state press
L wjll no doubt hear from the old Bo1

Wcx Hoot Tyler left the Tampa
Tribune he also strayed out of the
i state but coming by way of Pensacola
ki got sonic of the proverbial Deep
Water City sand In his shoes with
the inevitable result that he is now
back again and will join The Journals I

S The Special Message
To the Senate
S
I inclose herewith a letter from
the secretary of war transmitting a re
port of the investigation made by Mr
Herfbert J Browne employed by the
department in conjunction with Capt
Wi G Baldwin to investigate as far
as ipossrble what happened at Browns
villa ori the 13th and 14th of August
1906 The report and documents con
tain some information of great value
and some statements that are ob
viously worthless but I submit them
in their entirety
This report enables us to fix with
tolerable definiteness at least some
of the criminals who took the lead in
the murderous shooting of private
citizens at Brownsville It establishes
clearly the fact that the colored sol
diers did the shooting but upon this
point further record was unnecessary
as the fact that the colored soldiers
did the shooting has already been es
tablished beyond all possibility of
doubt The investigation has mot
gone far enough to enable us to de
termine all the facts and we will pro
ceed with it but it has gone far

enough to determlsne WitH sufficidnt
accuracycertain facts of enougn Im
portance to make It advisable that i
place the report before you It ap
pears that almost all the members
Company B must have been actively
concerned in the shooting either to
the extent of being participants or tc
the extent of virtually encouraging
those who were participants As to
Companies C and D there can foe no
question that practically every man in
them must have had knowledge that
the shooting was done > by some of the
soldiers of B troop and possIbly by
one or two others in one of the other
troops This concealment was itselt
I a grave offense which was greatly ag
gravated by their testifying before the
senate committee that they were ig
norant of what they must have
known Nevertheless it is to oosa1d
in partial extenuation tkat they were
probably cowed by threats made by
the more desperate of the men vo
had actually tieen engaged in the
shooting as to what would happen to
any man who failed to protect the
wrongdoers Moreover there are cir
cumstances tending show that these
misguided men were encouraged by
outsiders to persist in their course
of concealment 1d deniaL I feel
therefore that the guilt of the men
who after the event Jthue shielded
the perpetrators of the wrong by re
fusing to tell the truth about them
though serious was lit part due to the
unwise and improper attitude of
others and that some measure of al
lowance should he made for the mis
conduct Tn other words T ibelieve
we can afford to reinstate any of these
men who mow truthfully tell what has
happened give all the aid they can
to fixr the responsibility upon thoio
who are really guilty and skew that
they themselves had no gullt < > knowl
