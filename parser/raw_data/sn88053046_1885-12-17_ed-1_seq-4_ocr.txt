Winnipeg, Man., Dec. 10.—Biel's re
brought here last night
Regina in charge of two Oathollo priests
in a private oar. The movement was
across the river
to St. Boniface, where Riel's brother,
Alexander, and a number of half-breeds
were in waiting. They placed the body
a sleigh and drove to his mother's house
ut St. Villes, where his family were. The
opened, disclosing the face,
somewhat blackened and slightly dis
figured. The house was ilrapod in black.
The funeral will tuko place Saturday,
when the body will be brought to St.
Boniface Cathedral, where, after requiem
mass is celebratcd.it will be buried in the
Catholic cemetery beside the father of
Riel.
Archbishop Tache has issued a mani
festo, in which he lays the blame of the
half-breed uprising on the government
ofiiciulu, and bolds the Metis blameless,
lie argues that the Indians bad been
badly treated by the government officials,
and also holds that they are not terrified
by the recent executions, and that they
fear of the military. Reourriug
to Riel he says the half-breeds went across
the border for him to come and lead their
movement to secure redress of their
grievances. Riel responded, pressed on
side and encouraged on the other.

Isaac Buzzard, before being sentenced,

Cleveland, Dec. 8.—An interesting
fact comes to light in connection with the
discovery of the big volume, well of nat
al gas on the property of the Cleveland
Rolling Mill Company a few days ago.
All tho opinions of local
against the presence of gas in large
volumes at the Hpot where it was struck
at a depth of 3*, 160 feet except Charles
Latimer, chief engineer of the New York
Pennsylvania & Ohio railroad, on whose
advice boring for gas was i
ago. The company got a small
well, but it was flooded and abandoned
three years ago. Charles Latimer, whose
experiments with tho diviuiug rod have
awakened much interest and curiosity nil
over the country, advised William H.
Chisholm, ptesulent of the Cleveland
rolling mill, to resume work. This Mr.
Cbisholiu was inclined to do, lmt he
determined to ill ill another well. Luti
nud his witch hazel wand wore called
upon. Laiimor made an examination and
predicted gas at 3,000 feet. Sure enough
it was struck aud in great quantities.
Under Lntimer's advice the old well will
be resumed. It also transpires that Lati
mer's rod indicated gas on the grounds
of J. II. Wade, the millionaire hanker,
and a weil of sufficient volume to heat
