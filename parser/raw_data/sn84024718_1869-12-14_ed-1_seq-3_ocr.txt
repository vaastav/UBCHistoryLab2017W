HEEMITAGE CHAPEL ON FISE.
From a respected correspondent, we learn that
at about half past ten o'clock on Wednesday
morning last, Hermitage Chapel was found to be
on lire. A school is kept in the church during
the week. Tha fire caught around the chimney
.abova the plastering, and next to the roof. For
tunately, there was a ladder upon the roof, and
ti trap-door iv the ceiling by means of which wa
ter was throwm on the fire inside, above the ceil
ing and on the roof. Most luckily, Dr. Kenner
ly and a hired man were at home, and, soon after
the cry of fire, were at the church, and by great
esc-rgy and perseverance, succeeded, with the
blessing of Providence, in saving the church. —
The tire got through the roof, but did not burn
very rapidly en the outside, as the roof was new
and kept constantly wet. The damage is about
ten dollars. This church was completed and
dedicated on the 17th of last July, and its loss
would have been deeply deplored by the
jjjunity,

Legal Advertisements
On the subject of publishing legal advertise
ments, the Fredericksburg Neics says:
"Cash in advance" was never required, and
while some lawyers honestly took the trouble to
see that the editor was paid, others collected
their own foes but forgot the ladder or the
bridge by which alone they could reach the
right to claim compensation for themselves.
Now look at it fairly. The lawyer "furnishes
the brains" to write an advertisement which
any boy in the office could write. The editor
furnishes type, paper, ink, wages, fee., fee., to
enable the"iawyer to prosecute his suit—that is,
advances his money to help the lawyer. In
these times it requires much capital to do such
a business. We submit that lawyers should re
quire clients to pay in advance the cost of liti
gation and not go to law (both lawyers and cli
ent*) really at the cost of editors, who have to
advance the cash to keep the lawyers going.'

We like one sentiment, at least, in the Now
York Indepedent. It says: "In order to in
crease our circulation, we shall not hang around
the skirts of associations, societies or rings, or
cliques, or any body of men, or of individuals
pleading for influence or endorsement. We
ask no help as a charity to us from any quarter,
and we ask no one to subscribe to our paper un
less lie thinks he can get his moneys worth in
sound, practical, useful knowledge."

Valley Musical Association.
This body assembled in this place on Tuesday
ot last week, and continued in session until Fri
day. Ihe closing Concert was given on Friday
night. A here were about eighty members of
the Association present, representing almost
every portion of the District. The sessions were
ali exceedingly harmonious, and the best feeling
prevailed during the entire time. The music
rendered was of a superior class and was ad
muablybrought out. We observed that soma
OF the choruseswere taken from compositions
Oi the most eminent comoosevs who have ever
lived.

President-Rev. T. D. Bell.
Vice-Presidents-H. T. Wartmann, Key. W.
T. Price, Emmett Guy and J. P. Balston.
Secretary—J. E. Boiler.
Treasurer—G. M. Effinger.
There were quite a number of fraternal mes

The following gentlemen were appointed to
attend the next session of the Shenandoah As

Balston.
The next session of the Association will be
held at Bethel, in Augusta county, at such
time as the Committee of Arrangements may
determine.
The Concert on Friday night was a complete
success.— Rock. Register-
Dubuque on the Water-Line.
_ Upon tha receipt of intelligence that the Na
tional Jioard of 'iVade, recently in session here,
had endorsed the centra water-line, the Mayor
of Dubuque convened the Council of thiit city,
and that body passed resolutions expressing its
gratification and tendering the thanks of the
city to the Board of Trade. The Council fur
thermore, on behalf of themselves and the cit
izens, tendered the hospitalities of Dubuque to
the Board, and £ny£t,«d tbetjj to hold their nest
annual i&eeting at that* place. Ttafa matters
were all telcgraphc-i] iQ the Board just'before
the close of its session.
The deep interest taken by Dubuque In the
central water-line Ia an example of the feeling
now spreading in the Northwest. Two years
ago Dubuque was profoundly indifferent to the
subject; but Mr. Monroe, mho resides there,
unfolded its advantages to that part cf the
world, and now even tjjis city is not more thor
oughly impressed with the practical advantages
and natbnal dignity of the enterprise. The
whole Northwest will soon be fully aroused in
its behalf. When Boston (as was seen in the
recent JJoard of Trade) discovers its impor
tance, surely no eojpoagity of the Mississippi
Valley should be blind to the bees§tf it prom
ises them.— Richmond Dispatch.
The (Ecumenic Council.
The general Councils heretofore held have
varied greatly in the duration of their session—
from three months to eighteen years. It is
supposed the present one will despatch its busir
ness in four or five months. The Pope is op
posed to a protracted session.
The Pope has expressed the wish to the
Bishops, who waited on him, that full freedom
of discussion sb?ll prevail in the Council, and
that every one shall express freely his views.—
We suppose this is subject to the limitation
that nothing is advanced that has been con
demned.
There are several vacant Cardinal caps —but
they will not be disposed of until the close of
the session—g.n.d these will be given to those
who have shown most aevction.
There is talk of a Bull by the Pope, making
arrangements for a conclave in case of his death
during the session of the Council. Without
such provision, delay in the election of a Pope
might occur and possibly schism.— Richmond
Whig.
Does the Kichmond Whig really believe that
its present course towards the mass ofthe Con
servatives, who elected Gov. Walker —for with
out their asd he would not have recsived 3,000
votes in the State—and who are every way dis
posed to support had sustain him in the dis
charge of his duties, —is calculated to do any
good whatever? Is this course not rather likely
to alienate the Conservative voters cf the State?
The epithets which the Whig is in the habit of
applying to all who do uot follow its plans, do
not disturb much the equanimity of men who
know how unjust they are, but they are at least
looked upou as unkind, if not ungrateful, to
say the least of them. Besides, all men do not
reason calmly about such matters—and if their
feelings become excited by ungenerous treat
ment, on the part of those who are placed in
position by their exertion.- 1 , is it not natural that
they should resent it? We speak in ali kind
ness. — Alexandria Gazette.
A Sensational Marriage.—The marriage
of Paul Gerard, brother-in-law of the Portu
gese Minister, to v Washington mulatto girl,
on Tuesday night last, is a subject of much
talk in Washington. l\ex name w?.s Mary B-
Wormlcy, a niece of Wormley, the restaurant
keeper. The ceremony was performed by a
Catholic priest, who obtained a dispensation to
marry a Catholic with an unconverted girl.—
Tbe company present numbered nearly a hun
dred, and several gentlemen and ladies were
present. The company were well dressed and
well behaved; the bricla was richly attired in
white, with veil and orange blcssoms. An
abundant collation was enjoyed by the guests.
The Richmond Dispatch, speaking of that
portion of the President's Message which re
fers to Georgia, says: «•
"We confess our surprise at*ts recommend
ations concerning Georgia. The sending back
that State to tha original proposition is a mat
ter somewhat infringing principles indispensa
ble to a Cijnfederacy of States existing even up
on a very moderate basis. If the proposed in
terference with Georgia be interpreted as no
more than proper, and within the purview of
the power of Congress, then, inded, the States
are at an end, even in the mildest form of their
existence."
The New Judges.—On the meeting of our
Legislature more than a hundred new judges
are to be appointed by that body. We do trust
that men of ability, integrity and experience
will be once more deemed eligible for such offi
ces, and that we shall no longer see the judi
ciary of Virginia polluted by men who recall
by their drunkenness and filthy conversation,
the palmy days of Jeffreys, and that it may
never more be the public scandal in her capital
that the gates of justice can only be unlocked
by a golden key.—Petersburg Index.

It lecomraends itself especially to the people
of the Valley and the South a? a Southern en
terprise inventing its money at home.
It is believed that its liberal charter will en
able it to make, to the assured, larger dividends
than is possible for most companies.
Seven-eighths of its profits are divided among
policy-holders on the contribution plan. It
guarantees on the face of its Policies, a definite
surrender value.
On tho Life Plan on ages under 55, a Loan
of 50 per cent, of the Premium wiil be given,
at tut per cent interest—thus insuring the largest
amount of insurance for the least amount of
monej-.
The Policies issued by this Company are in
contestable after five years' duration, for, or on
account of, errors or mis-statements, except as
regards age in the application ; it is believed
that all attempts at fraud will culminate within
that period, and, while it is the Company's du
ty and intention to guard, as a sacred trust, the
moneys which policy-holders deposit from year
to year, and to protect the same against fraud
ulent designs, tho above guarantee is given to
satisfy insurers that accidental mis-statements
or omissions cannot by anj' possibility effect the
validity of insurances effected with the "Vir
ginia."
B@°> NoWj therefore, aud in this most relia
ble Company, adopt the wise course of taking
a Policy. Put it not off till to-morrow. No
man can tell what a day may bring forth. If it
is hard for you to raise the premium, how much
harder will it be for the helpless ones you may
leave behind, to struggle with penury, if you
die without such provisiou for them ? For full
