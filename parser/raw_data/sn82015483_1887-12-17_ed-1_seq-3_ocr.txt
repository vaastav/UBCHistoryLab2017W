How a Dying Child
Was Sawed !
Cicrato, Hamltox Co., Iwn., Sept, 19, 1887.
The following is a true account of what your
8. S.S.hasdono for our little daughter, Harei,
bow four years old. When. 12 months old a
lump appeared on her heel, which slowly grew
larger. The family physician thought it was
caused by a pieca of broken glass or needle
but failed to bring anything to light. The
child became feebler all the time, seeming to
lose the use of her leg, and finally quit walk
ing entirely. The middle finger and thumb
of either hand became enlarged, the flesh be
coming hard. The hip Joints became involv
ed, so that when seventeen months old she
could not stand, having lost the use of leg
and arm. Partial curvature of the spine also
followed. The nervous system was wrecked,
muscles contracted, and there was general
wasting of flesh and muscle. At eighteen
months of age she was placed under the
treatment of a prominent physician of Bos
ton, Mass., but at the end of ten months she
had declined to such a degree that she was in
a dying condition. This was in April, 1SC0.
We took the child away not knowing what
to do. In this dreadful dilemma we were
over-persuaded by friends to try "one bot
tle " of Swift's Specific, which we did, and
before it had all been taken wo saw a change
for the better In her symptoms. We kept it
up. and have done so to this day, and will
keep it up, if the Lord wills, for many days
to come, for It has brought our dying Hasel
to life, to vigor, to strength and health again.
The ashen hue of her cheeks has changed to
a rosy tint. She Is able to walk anywhere,
her languor and melancholy have passed
away, and she Is now a blithe, cheerful, hap
py romping child. Should you wish to in
crease your testimonials of prooJT of the
virtue of S. 8. S., our names and what we
have said is but a portion of what we owe to
jrou. should you wish to use them.
Kindly yours,
Bkx. pr Swift,

Nkw York, Dee. 16..-4TtacToonTention oi
Republican clubs was called to order at 10:45
this morning by Temporary Chairman Ryan.
Committee reports were first in order and
Senator Chandler led off with the report of
the committee on rales and order of business.
Daring the reading of the names of the differ
ent clubs there was great cheering. There
were 313 club names to read and the cheering
was almost continuous as the following names
were repeated: John Sherman, U. S. Grant,
Charles Sumner, John A. Logan, Benjamin
Wade, Abraham Lincoln and James Q.
Blaine. On the last name they got in their
work. At each repetition the applause was
unbounded. Clubs omitted from the roll
were then called for by States. Fifteen clubs
in addition to those on record were read from
Ohio. The report of the committee on cre
dentials, after the reading of the names of
clubs, was adopted. A number of resolutions
were then offered by members, which were
referred to the committee on resolutions. One
of them referring to Secretary Lamar created
quite a sensation, its purpose being wildly
applauded. The mention of Mr. Lamar's
name was hissed and a colored delegate in the
gallery grew frantic as he wildly applauded
the offer ot tne motion. The resolution was
as follows:
Whereas, it is the opinion of this national conven
tion of Republican clubs that no man who at any
uuie ucuuuiuxu Aurautuu iihcuiu wouu lie was
President of che United States as a buffoon or
clown, or whoever declared from his seat in the
United States Senate that no man should denounce
Jefferson Davis as a traitor, or who, in his official
capacity as the secretary of the interior, ordered
that the flag of the United States should be display
ed at half-mast on the occasion of .the death of Ja
cob Thompson, or who, as a senator of the United
States, many years after the war, refused to vote
that the thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth
amendments to the constitutiou are valid and bind
ing, ought to be appointed to orjtiolil the high office
of justice of the Supreme court of the United
States; therefore
Resolved, ThatL. C. Q. Lamar ought not to have
been appointed justice of said court.
Senator William M. Evarts, who had been
chosen for permanent chairman, came on the
platform and was received with tremendous
applause. He was introduced by Judge
Byan and make a ringing speech. This con
vention would, he said, like the "grand old
party" never acknowledge that there could be
chosen a candidate greater han the party.
The Democrats always pride themselves that
they nominate men greater than their party,
but that illusion has about, been dispelled.
The election of the man who at present fills
the chief executive office of the nation has
caused this, : and the Democratic soothing
syrup has shown that it is totally devoid of
any medical properties. The Republican
party never has had any candidate of prin
ciples hostile to the country's best interests.
He spoke of the suppression of suffrage in the
Sooth and said we had a right to have
every vote counted there. The next
great topic as wide as the subject
of suffrage is labor and industry. There are
only three agencies of government over this
people. They are education, industry and
suffrage. We could do without . the soldiers i
to maintain the government when we have
education and industry. Some think we can
lay a hand on an industry without affecting
industry in every form. The Republican
party believes that to affect one affects all.
Mr. Evarts tnen pitched into the message of
Cleveland. He thought that the Democrats
might try to explain it away if possible later
on, and when they cannot do that they will
retreat. ' But we must hold him to it. We
have the right to that message. The
laboring man who reads that message
will see through the phrases in which it dis
guises his real position toward him. Some
people think the Republican Senate will
prevent the .President from doing wrong. A
nice way that, for people to elect a president,
believing that the opposite party will keep
him straight. We have a maxim in the law
that no injury can be done to a man that is
willing it should be done. So the nation is
under trial to see what wrongs it will suffer
without having them redressed. We have
another duty, and that is to protect the name
and fame of those who carried us through
the past crisis. Their name must never be
tarnished, their name must be preserved with
the same splendor which shone upon them
when they did their work.
Through Mr. Jtoyle, of Ohio, the commit
tee on permanent organization then reported
the following draft of the constitution of the
National league:

The reDort of the committee on perma
nent organization was adopted and a reoess
till 8 p. m. was taken. The convention set
tled down to ousiness gain at 4 p. m
When order had been obtained General Q
, S. Batcuellor gave a compiled report from
the: committee on credentials, showing that
350 clubs were represented in the conven
tion by 353 delegates. After Chairman
Evarts had taken his seat amid applause
there were repeated calls for General Nathan
GofE, who descended from the gallery and
climbed to the platform. After thanking
the convention for its rousing welcome to
him General Goff said: "I came from a land
south of Mason and Dixon's line and represent
ttepuDiicans. we are Republicans from con
viction. Wo are of a country that before the
organization of the Republican party was suf
fering from the blight of slavery, ignorance
and Democracy. Speaking for Republicans
who liave lived in the land I have alluded to
I waijt to tell you why we are" Republicans if
you have time (cries 'Lota of it.J) J We are
Republicans because living in the land we be
lieve that American labor and industry shall
be protected by law (cheers). The Democratic
party has been false to that idea. We jre
member when only the children of the favor
ed few could enjoy education, bat the Repub
lican party has allowed all to enjoy these
privileges. All .men who lived there did
not march under the stars and bars when
others hoisted the flag of rebellion. I with
others marched with Sherman and through
the Wilderness with the indomitable Grant
(deafening applause) until the peace of Ap
pomattox. But I represent also the men who
fought with Lee, but who at the return of
peace marched ont from the errors of the
past and they all voted at the last election
fer James G. Blaine (tremendous applause.)
Oar party has always dared to do right,
whether or not it was expedient. It has no
sympathy for the anarchists, the paupers of
other countries or polygamous men. It
stands for all that is great in human
action, grand in human thought. It
is the party that has torn down
and rebuilt the weak places of the govern
ment. The Republican party has purified
the institutions of our fathers and cleansed
the institutions of their children. I am not
going to name men for office; I am going to
talk about men. I am going to say the ma
terial of- our convention is so good that the
choice of a candidate for 1888 must be good.
With Allison of Iowa, Lincoln of Illinois,
Harrison of Indiana, Sherman of Ohio, Haw
ley of Connecticut, Evarts and Hiscock of
New York, Phil Sheridan of the United
States, and last but by no means least Blaine
of Maine, we should win." , .
Cheers followed each name, but the men
tion of Blaine aroused the greatest applause.
John A. Earren, of Iowa, then read the re
port of the committee on resolutions. The
report recites -the glorious history of ths Re
publican party, in its devotion to the educa
tion of the masses, the extension of liberty to
every human being within the national juris
diction by wiping out the accursed stain of
slavery, the regeneration of the national cre
dit, the resumption of specie payment, the
development of our national resources, the
addition of four States and five territories,
the encouragement of the activities of the
country by which the population increased
threefold, and the reformation of the civil
service. ' Reference also is made at
length to Cleveland's free trade message.
The various banents which have accrnded
under protection are recited at length, and
the resolutions close with thirteen declara
tions, refusing to abandon home protection;
predicting disaster under the Democratic
policy; declining to accept the proposition
of the President's message which favor for
eign rather than home laborers and indus
tries; urges substitution of home for
foreign competition and the development of
home markets and manufacturers by means
of cheapened inter-State communication; de
douncing the Democratic House for not ad
mitting as States those territories having a
sufficient - population; condemning the
same body for its hostility to meas
ures; for broad popular education, in
sisting on a free and honest
ballot in every State of the Union, charging
the Democratic party with failure' to build
up the navy and prepare seacoast defenses;
charging the Democratic administration with
culpable weakness in defending American
industries and individual rights on the high
seas and in foreign lands; condemning
Democratic prostitution of the civ
il service to partisan purposes;
charging the President with ignoring the just
claims of soldiers, closing as follows: "Up
on this history and this declaration we sum
mon to our aid not only the patriotism of the
country, but its labor, its industry, its com
merce and its statesmanship."
A number of pithy speeches favoring the
report were made. When the question on
the adoption of the report was reached Mr.
Eustis called for action first on the resolution
opposing Mr. Lamar's confirmation as Su
preme court justice, but he was ruled out of
order and the report was unanimously adopt
ed. Mr. Eustis then tried to offer his Lamar
resolution, but Chairman Evarts said the
resolution was in the hands of the com
mittee and Mr. Eustis was out of order.
E. T. Brockett, chairman of the New York
delegation, moved that the resolution be re
called froaa the committee. Mr. Rice, of
Massachusetts, said the convention should
not throw mud. Others expressed the same
view and Captain A. P. Cunningham, of
Washington, moved to adjourn. J. A. Kasson
seconded the motion and it was carried with
a rush. The convention meets again at 10
a. m. to-morrow.

A Very Enjoyable Entertainment In

The Atheneum was filled last night with
an audience of the best people of the city to
witness a performance given for the benefit
of the Women's Indian Aid association. The
programme consisted of tableaux, vocal ma
ris, a tragic cantata entitled "The Grasshop
per" and a comedietta, "Young Mr. Pritch
ard." The tableaux were all very prettily
arranged, the one entitled "The Dews of
Evening" bsing particularly attractive. Two
solos by Miss Warts were rendered In a
pleasing manner. Miss Hazlitt and Mr. E.
Bushnell sang and received well merited en -cores.
The troubles of Miss Hetty and Betty
in the comedietta caused much amusement.
The association will receive about $400 as
the proceeds of the evening's entertainment.
The programme was as follows:

Is worth a column of rhetoric, said an Ameri

the testimony of thousands of people, that
Hood's Sarsaparilla does cure scrofula, salt
rheum and other diseases or affections aris

IN VEST HAVEN.
The Estate Left Br the Iate Justice
metealf Estimated At About $12,
000 Inter est I nc Financial Questions
Arising Regarding: the Disposition
of the Property.
The late Justice Metealf of Went Haven, who
for a very long period was the trying justice
of that borough and had prominent official
duties in the local proceedings in the cele
brated Jennie Cramer cass, left a small es
tate which isestimated at about $13,000. The
old gentleuau. was ever prudent and - fore
handed, frugal and upright, and his old agS
and declining years was cheered with tha fact
that he was possessed of worldly goods uffi
oient to "keep the wolf from the door." He
came to West Haven from. New York State
when a young man and for several years Im
mediately afterward was the local or village
school teacher. He married late in life,
when about fifty, and marrying Mrs. Miles, a
widow, with two sons. Her first husband
was Clark Miles. One of her sons is dead,
and the surviving son is Mr. Harrison Miles,a
respected merchant of Ansonia. The wife
died a number of years ago. Mr. Metcalf's
estate in now in process of settlement
Some time before he died he deeded $2,000
or $3,000 worth of real estate to his stepson,
Mr. Miles of Ansonia. He also deed
ed to his sister, a Miss - Metealf
of West Haven, all the remainder of his
real estate and as near as can be determined
intended to leave or did leave the balance of
his wealth to her. It consisted of bonds and
stock of the West Haven horse railroad and
stock of tbe Consolidated railroad, etc All
appeared plain sailing as to settling the estate
when a claim was put in by Mr. Miles of
about $2,500 against the estate, and Mr.
Miles produces notes given in his favor by
the late Mr. Metealf for the amount of his
claims. Mr. Miles' mother brought property
to the amount of $2,500 to Mr. Metealf when
she married him. This property went into
the general household exchequer and was
absorbed into Mr. Metcalf's assets. It
is not known whether Mr. Metealf in deeding
Mr. Miles the $2,000 or $3,000 worth of real
estate intended that to extinguish the claim
against him arising from the notes he had
given Mr. Miles and as an equivalent for the
mother's property, or whether he intended
the transfer of real estate to Mr. Miles to be
a gift, leaving the notes he had given Mr.
Miles to be a claim against the estate. Miss
Metealf, it is stated, will contest the matter
and has engaged Mr. John W. Ailing as her
counsel, and it seems probable that the af
fair may go to the courts for settlement.
WATSON'S FINE PLAYING.
The New Havens Win as Usual Con
nors Gets Hit on the Head Hart
ford's Successful Spell Broken by the
Bridgeport.
The New Havens won last night's game
from the Waterburys by tha score of 8 to 2.
The game was played at Lincoln rink before
a good-sized crowd. At no time was the
game exciting as the New Havens had the
game won from the start.
It can now be said that the home team has
a goal tend, and not an amateur of the Boyle
type. By all means let Watson be kept at
the cage.
One of Newcombe's terrific drives hit Con
nors just over the eye on the temple. The
blow stunned Connors. He pat his hand to
his head and fell to the floor. He came to
after several minutes and pluckily played
the game out.
The New Havens played a fine game. The
WaterOurvs really made but one goal, tne
other one credited to them being made by
Watson, who in his attempt to stop the ball
unconsciously kicked it into the cage after
he had stopped it. Two goals were taken
off: by fouls. The score:

The Hartfords met with their first defeat
this week last night in Bridgeport. They
have been having a prosperous career of late,
led by the. king of goal tenders, Joe Eiley.
But the Bridgeports braced up last night
and pulled themselves out of last place by de

off by fouls.
The Standing.
The New Havens still hold first place. The
Hartfords and Meridens have had a hard
fight this week for second place. They are
now tied. If the Hartfords had not all at
once begun playing such a strong game the
Meridens and the New Havens would be
fighting for first place. The Bridgeports and
the Waterburys have been trying to get out
of last place. The Bridgeports have come
out best. The standing to date is as follows:

ALL SAINTS' CHAPEL.
Opening of a New ChrcU Xbls After,
noon.
The new All Saints' chapel, so plainly visi
ble from the West Haven horse cars on the
corner of Howard avenue and Lamberton
street, will be open for service this (Saturday)
afternoon at 3 o'clock. Many people from the
center of the city have contributed towards
ita erection, and will be interested in its
opening service. The rapid growth of the
city toward Oj ster Point renders the church
work there most encouraging. On Sunday
there will be services at the new chapel
morning and afternoon.
Entertainments.
FANTASMA.
At the New Haven (Opera House last even
ing "Fantasma" was presented for the second
time in this engagement to the largest au
dience of the season, every seat being occupied
before the rising of the curtain, and standing
room being cheerfully taken by late comers.
As on the preceding evening the prodnction
was greeted with enthusiasm, and the inter
est and attention of the audience was
well deserved. The action is continuous
throughout as there are no wearisome waits,
and constantly increasing novelties
are presented ia such rapid succession
as to thoroughly bewilder the audience.
Little Tootsey as Pioo, jr., played the part of
the smallest clown yet seen in this city, and
she stands high in the list of the many child
actresses of the present time. Miss Laura
Bnrt as "Fantasma" fully sustained her rep
utation, and her topical song was received
with ronnds of aDplanse. M'lle Martha
Phoite, the flying sprite, floats through the
air in such a natural bird-like manner that
there is doubt of her being human. Mr.
Louis Pizarello played the "Carnival of Ven
ice" in twenty-three different positions of the
violin and bow, and his improvisations were
very amusing. It would be well for Manager
Wall to provide, if possible, extra seating
capacity for the erowds who will attend the
matinee at 2:30 and the evening performance
at 8 o'clock.
WRECK ON THE CANAL ROAD.
A Flat Car Demolished Express Pas
sengers Have to If Transferred.
As the workmen's train on the Canal rail
road was coming in last night it broke in
two at Hamden, and in backing np the for
ward portion of the train collided with the
rear part with each force as to smash the
truck of one of the flat oars and demolish it.
The accident delayed the 8:55 p. m. express
train, and passenger coaches were sent from
the Union depot to the place of the accident
bo that the passengers would not have to
wait for the track to be cleared. A wrecking
car was sent to clear the track.

Rheumatism
We doubt it there is, or can be, a specific
remedy for rheumatism ; but thousands who
have suffered its pains have been greatly ben
efited by Hood's Sarsaparilla. If you have
failed to And relief, try this great remedy.
" I was afflicted with rheumatism twenty
years. Previous to 1S83 1 found no relief, but
grew worse, and at one time was almost help
less. Hood's Sarsaparilla did me more good
than all the other medicine I ever had."
- II. T. Balcom, Shirley Village, Mass.
" I had rheumatism three years, and got no
relief till I took Hood's Sarsaparilla. It has
done great things for me. I recommend it to
others." Lewis Bubeank, Biddeford, Me.
Hood's Sarsaparilla is characterized by
three peculiarities : 1st, the combination of
remedial agents ; 2d, the proportion; 3d, the
process of securing the active medicinal
qualities. The result is a medicine of unusual
strength, effecting cures hitherto unknown.
Send lor book containing additional evidence.
" Hood's Sarsaparilla tones up my system.
purifies mv Mood, sharpens my appetite, and
seems to make me over." " J. P. Thompson,
Register of Deeds, Lowell, Mass.
"Hood's Sarsaparilla beats all others, and
is worth its weight in gold." I. Babjunoton,
130 Bank Street, New York City.
