A REMINDER.
In a few weeks more the year 1887
will be numbered with the others that
have g-one before. To many the expir
ing year has been one of exceptional
prosperity, and to others it has been
exceeding calamitous. THE IRISH
STANDARD
may be classed in the for
mer list. Our business has increased
beyond expectation—so much so that
we feel quite sale in entering into cer
tain. contracts, which necessitate the
outlay of a considerable sum of money,
but
will vastly improve the paper, in
the matter of collections we have been
very fortunate, but yet there are many
who have not paid for their paper. To
those we would say that it would facili
tate our business arrangements consid
erably if the amounts due were settled
In cases where any cf our pat
rons have found it required all their
available resources to keep "the wolf
from the door," we do not wish to
be hard. All we ask is for those who
can pay to do so at the earliest possible
moment. By doing so they will assist
THE IiviSH STANDAUD in carrying out
contemplated improvements for the
year 18S8. But in no case is it desired
that a subscriber should seriously in
convenience or deprive himself and
family of the necessities of everyday
life in order to wipe out his indebted
ness.
In policy THE IRISH STANDARD will
pursue the same course that it has in
the past. Over and above everything
IT is a CATHOLIC PAPER. The Church
whose traditions are so honorable and
upright, and which has far surpassed
all other religious denominations in its
civilians influence and the elevation of
humanity, commands our first alle
giance.

THE IRISH CRISIS.
The wholesale arrests of the prin
cipals in the Irish agitation leave no
doubt as to the intention of Balfour to
smother the Irish National League, if
sucliTa" tiring lies within the range of
possibility. The only two leaders who
have not vet been threatened with ar
rP3t are Mr. Parnell and Mr. Davitt.
Why they should escape the indignities
consequent upon a two or three
months1 sojourn in one of Her Ma
jpstv's prisons is quite evident. Mr.
Pameli has carefully, and it might be
said discreetly in the light of past
events, abstained from an active par
ticipation in the public deliberations of
the Irish Nationalist party. Ill-health
was one reason why he did this, but
even if hisheallh had not necessitated
snch absence, he probably would not
have acted otherwise. In the case of
Mr. Davitt it might be said that
"that gentleman "has avoided everything
that would afford Balfour, no matter
how wilfully unjust the misconstruc
tion of the law might be, a pretext for
arresting him. But the time has now
arrived when Mr. Parnell. must come
forward The last of Mr. Davitt's
assistants will, in all probability, in the
course of a few days be under lock and
key, for it is said that lion-hearted John
Dillon will enjoy such luxury upon his
return from England. At this junc
ture it becomes necessary for some
to lead in the the Irish cam
paign. and there is only one
man available who can undertake
the trying position and carry it to a
successful issue.OThat man is Charles
Stnart Parnell. He has renderedln
valuable service to the Home Rule party
under like circumstance* in the past,
and without a doubt will come forward
at this critical moment—from the sick
bed, if necessary—and lead his party.
He is
cool-headedand
conservati ve., and
is
the man for the present emer­
gency. In Mr. Parnell is to be found
the necessary qualiflcations to maintain
the discipline oi the Irish forces. It is
in a crisis like the present that the
great Irish patriot shows to best advan
tage. It is safe to say that he will,
within the course of a week or so, be
again in the midst of the great struggle
for Irish legislative independence.
At present the greatest difficulty con
sists in not having sufficient money on
hand to defeat the aims of the Tory
Government. Any trouble between
the Dublin. Castle crowd and the peo
ple would at once render it necessary
to send on the "sinews of war." Rev.
Father O'Beilly, of Detroit, however,
will soon haT'e $50,000 to send to "the
men in the gap." We trust the friends
of Ireland scattered over the United
States will join hands ip the good cause
of Irish regeneration. In all probability
not a year will pass before there is a
dissolution of parliament, and then the
friends of Ireland the United King
dom will be knocking at the doors of
the House of Commons for the admis
sion of the Emerald Isle to an elevated
rank among the nations of the world.
HUM NATIONAL LEAGUE Of
AMEBI0A.
At a recent meeting of the executive
committee of the Irish National
League of America the question of
where the next National convention
should be held was taken into consid
eration and the whole matter was fin
ally placed in the hands of a committee
of seven with President Fitzgerald as
chairman, who will decide the timeand
place, after consulting co-workers in
Ireland as to the time that would suit
them best.
Undoubtedly the League convention
should be held as soon as pos
sible. There are many reasons for
this, not fr.e lea*t important one being
that next summer the country will be
plunged into what promises to be a
very
hot Presidential political contest.
In the past the Irish cause has suffared
very considerably by an attempt to
drag into it questions of a political na
ture, which affect this country only.
Some
members of the Irish National
League belong to one political party,
and^ome
Democratic party. The
administration of President Cleveland
for purity and integrity to the interests
of
the American people has been with
out
parallel in the history of the Repub
lic. Therefore, we cannot dp other
wise than extend to it our hearty and
te^tiiindvided support.

to another, but on the ques­
tion of Irish legislative independence
they are a unit. No individual mem
ber has a right
fto
say how Irishmen
should vote.
Should the convention be postponed
until next summer, there would be
some,
danger of misrepresentation, if
nothing else, and this is another good
reason why it should be, held imme
diately. The Irish struggle must be
entirely divorced from American poli
tics. The men who attempt to use the
Irish National League or any other
Irish
organization to assist this or that
party in order to advance personal ends
and ambitions are no friends of the
Emerald Isle, but are in the ^movement
for revenue only.'* It Is the cluty of
eyery Irish-American to vote, but he
has no right to drag the name of the
suffering land of his birth into the"
question. By all means let the conven
tion be held immediately. a
INTOLERANCE A MYTH.
It* would be well for some of the
bigoted Protestants who are coutinually
prating about the fear of Catholic in
tolerance, as au objection to Home
Rule, to read and inwardly digest the
following from the Dublin North and
South:
"Those who fear for Irish Protestant
ism in case Home Rule is 'conceded to
the Irish people should give some at
tention to the remarks made by, Arch
bishop Plunket of the Irish Episcopal
church, at the opening of the Synod.
Dr. Plunket disclaims all such fears,
while he recognises distinctly that
Home Rule cannot be very far off. He
says that be has far greater apprehen
sion of harm from a growth of irre
ligion, than from anything his Catholic
ff'llow-countrycoen will do to his
church and he protests against the
habit of speaking of Irish Episcopa
lians as thousrh they were devoid of na
tional sympathy. Perhaps the Arch
bishop recalls the fact that in the day
of their power he Irish Catholics never
persecuted. In 1.6S9 their Parliament
of Dublin established absolute freedom
of religion, and decreed that those who
paid tithes should designate the church
for whose benefit they should be appro
priated."
0HAMBEKLAIN SHOULD SPEAK NOW.
Before coming to this country Joseph
Chamberlain said that the only support
the Irish cause had in the United
States was the rag-tag and bob tail of
American life. Mr. Chamberlain has
now been long enough in this country
to see his mistake, and if he wanted to
be honest he would come out openly
aud say so. He knows that to repeat
the foul accusation in America
would bring him into ridicule. Mr.
Arthur O'Connor droye the lie home in
his speech in St. Louis the other night.
Speaking on the point, he said
"In every meeting which we have at
tended we have had in the chair either
the Mayor of the city or the Governor
of the State or men of Congressional
rank, like our distinguished President
of this evening. Upon every platform
we have had representative Americans
of every walk of life, judges as we have
had judges to-night, men at the head
of the commercial world, such men as
we have on the platform to-night, men
eminent in art, in literature and in
public affairs. And from the first
meeting till now we have-not found
wanting any class, creed or status. We
have not found absent any indication
or any proof which was in the power of
the people of America to supply the
depth and the earnestness of their sym
pathy with us."
Joseph Chamberlain should read this
portion of Mr. O'Connor's speech very
carefully. If he does he should go back
to England with a deep conviction that
the people of America uphold Mr.
Gladstone and condemn all who oppose
his Irish policy, especially radical rene
gades, like Chamberlain.
LOED MAYOR SULLIVAN IN JAIL.
Ireland is a good country for news
paper men to keep away from just at
the present time. A "scoop" on the.
latest National League news is re
warded with two months' imprison
ment. Lord Mayor Sullivan of Dublin
is now serving out the reward he re
ceived for his journalistic enterprise.
He has been convicted of having nub
lisbed his paper, the Dublin Nation,
reports of proclaimed branches of the
National League, and sentenced to two
months' imprisonment. He was first
placed in the jail in Dublin, where he
held a daily levee, but was afterwards
transferred to Tullamore jail to keep
Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Mandeville com
pa y. The remoyal of Lord Mayor
Sullivan from Dublin is an act of
petty persecution, which is beneath
contempt. Ostensi bly, says a dsspatch,
the change was made to prevent the
Lord Mayor from holding receptions in
the jail, which, it was claimed, partook
of the character of ovations to the dis
tinguished prisoner but the real ob
ject of his removal was to make his
term of incarceration as unpleasant
and impose upon him as great a degree
of hardship as possible, since bis sen
tence does not permit his keepers to ex
act the performance of labor. The
Dublin magistrates will continue their
visits to Mr. Sullivan, however, there
being no way in which they can be le
gally prevented. Mr. Sullivan is still
Lord Mayor of Dublin, and in such ca
pacity cannot be debarred from con
sultation with the magistrates of the
city, nor can the latter be denied the
right to confer with their superior of
ficer.

MICHAEL DAVITT says only what is
reasonable and just when he remarks
that Ireland, and Ireland only, must
settle her own land question. Expe
rience has taught statesmen the world
over that a country knows ber own
needs better and can settle them more
satisfactorily than outsiders.
Two THOUSAND Crofters on the Isle
of Lewes In ve commenced a campaign
to exterminate the forest. They allege
that 6 000 Crofters are starving who
ought to be living on the land which is
now given up to deer, and that in
adopting their present course they are
actuated by sheer necessity.
A RECENT investigation into the
price of wheat shows that the Ameri
can farmer has superior advantages for
competition in the wheat markets of
the world. Charges from Chicago to
Liverpool have been reduced within
seventeen years thirty cents per sixty
pounds, while the freight rates from
India, to Liverpool have not decreased
in that proportion, if at all.
THE latest news from Mr. Blaine is
that ha will arrive in San Francisco
from Japan five days before the meeting
of the Republican National Convention
of 1888, which will renominate him.
He will then make a triumphal tour
across the continent, which will be "the
greatest ovation ever accorded an
American statesman, not excepting
that of Gen. Grant in 1879." This is a
pretty piece of goods, but will it wash
TES President's message to Congress
is one of the most important delivered
for years, inasmuch as it treats of a
subject that concerns every class of the
people. It is wholly confined to the
surplus in the treasury, and recom
mends a reduction of the tariff as the
most expedient means of getting the
surplus back into the pockets of the
people. The major portion of this ses
siou of Congress will probably be taken
up with legislation tending towards this
end.
"You have heard it said," howled a
blatherskite who spoke at the Cooper
Union meeting in New York the other
night, "that the Anarchists do not be
long to this country. They do not
want to belong to this country. They
do not need to come under its flag.
Tbey have a flag of their own—their red
flag." Then the quicker they get out of
this country the better. We presume
it is only a matter of taste if they pre
fer the rope route. This country is
pretty big, but it is not big enough for
two flags.
MR. POWDERLY has declined to re
consider his previously expressed de
termination to retire from the leader
ship of fae Knights of Labor at the ter
mination of his present term of office.
This decision will cause deep regret
amongst the members of an order for
whose extension and welfare Mr. Pow
derly has been so solicitous and has
done so much. The letter declining to
serve after the next general session,
which Mr. Powderly has addressed to
his friends, is destined to create a vast
amount of sympathy for him.
IT looks as if Joe Chamberlain was
not carrying out to the letter his propo
sition to run the whole British end of
the Fishery Commission. Sir Charles
Tupper is doing all the work while the
English Judas Iscariot is compelled to
gaze silently on, This is fortunate, in
asmuch as with a reasonable man like
Sir Charles the Americans can settle
the matter with satisfaction to the two
countries directly interested -the
United States and Canada. It is ad
mitted on all sides that Chamberlain is
a greatly over-estimated man, and so
far as business-like statesmanship is
cone«nifid should not be mentioned in
the same breath with Sir Charles
Tupper.
REV. ISAAC TAYLOR, Canon of York,
recently stated in the English church
congress, that conyersions in India
were going on at the rate of 600,000 a
year to Mahommedanism, 50,000 to
Catholicity, and only 10,000 to the va
rious sects of Protestants. He further
state"5 hat the church missionary so
ciety of India, which has in its service
841 missionaries, at an annual cost of
$2".0.000, made last year but 297
converts, or about one convert to
every,. three 0 missionaries yearly.
This latter showing is bad enoueh, but
Canon Taylor further says that in Per
sia, Arabia and Egypt, 109 Christian
missionaries (of course, he means Pro
testants,) converted but one adult last
year, and she was a Mohammedan girl
in a Christian orphan asylum. In
presence of these stubborn facts, How
can sincere Pr#testanta cling to a faith
which is so barren of results in heathen
lands Can they entertain the least
doubt now that the command: "Go
teach all nations," was not delivered to
their missionaries
