the plil generation ,of- p ibl'tl man from
among us. He a nativ-i of tha Suto of
Tennessee, b.irn there in 179".,wh.3n it was
almost allusively an unse'ttloJ wilderness,
lie was " liberally educated, and after read
ing law went into the practice of that pro
fession, and served some time as a J udge
of tho Circuit Ciurt. Very early in life,
however, he engaged in the political contest
of the dav. and abnit thi year 1828 he was
chojen to represent, his. district in Uongnss,
and continued to serve in that capacity du
ring the whole eight years of General Jack
sort's Administration. At tha time of Pres
ident Polk's election Mr, Johnson wis se
lected by that officer as his Postmaster Gen
eral, and served until March 3J, 1849.
The Defeat of the Constitutional
Amendment.
The late elections have resulted in the
defeat of the Radical Constitutiona
Amendments. Delewhre, ' Maryland and
Kentucky have chosen Legislatures against
it. The ten unrepresented Stetus in Con
gress will not consent to it. , This makes
thirteen; States ,in all, without counting
Tennessee, who rejeet it. 1 There are now
tlirrty-six Stat.es. ' A required three-fourths
vote would be twenty' seven States, whereas
but twenty-three are .ohiainecL But, asks
an objector, can not this Majority be over
come by the admission" of new Western
Territories as States? Let us sec. They
will bavo to admit four new States in order
to gain one votel Thus,: if they shou'd
admit twelve States, it Would bring up the
whole' number of " States ' to forty eight.
Three-quarters of that .number would be
thirty-six States, whereas, after deducting
the thirteen anti-amendment' States, the
Radicals would have but thirty-five States,
or one less 'ran the required number, it is
most unlikely that the Radicals can possibly
croato so large a batch of new States as the
doxea that would be indispensable under
such circumstances. Therefore, unless the
Itadica Is resort to some revolutionary ex
pedient to revive or carry the project, it
my be considered shelved.
Political Rascality In Content-

The Washington Correspondent of tho
Bichmsnd (Virginia) Examiner thus notes
80ia. of the rascality and schemes the
majority in the Rump Congress entertain.
It y r- -,
''The "first act they will pass will be one
repealing the annestv set of July, 1802,
under which the President is authorized to
extend amnesty to any person engaged in
the late rebellion by- his proclamation. -
"The proposition fur a general amnesty,
either as an independent Executive act, or
as oouplcd with 'impartial suffrage,"', has
alarmed the .Radical majority. They fear
that tbe President will steal a march on
tbetn. ' : ; ,
The pardons already granted by the
President they deem an impeachable offense.
They will cripple his power -over the suh
- ject. aa far as they -can, leaving him only
the OoBstitutional power of pardon after a
"Ibe next 'tmi chief set' of th session
will be one under which the 8tate now
excluded shail b brought under tha war
nower of Uunsress Dower acknowled-
ging oo limitation. . The main object of this
aot.will be to give the political power of the

may, be dene by disfranchising the
. whites and enfranchising the blacks."

' Popular Dlsfraactalsesnent.
The Columbus Crrns well says that those
who advocate that worst of Biodern humbugs
miscalled "impartial suffrage,' as a prclimi-
nsry to the reJuu'wn of our social system to
the level of mongrelism, can have no inter
est in the proerity and happiness of the
cos n try, and it is a monrnful inetaaoc of the
demoralization of tha times that so great
and dangerous an inovation should be con
tern plated upon no other grounds than that
of partisan luccess, snd the spoils thereto
annexed. The Abolitionists favor it be
cause they tliink tbey can secure ;he negro
vote, and thus obtain a bats for tbeir sec
tional oreanisation in localities where it
does not now exist, snd so by perfecting
their pbliticil machine, retain the ascendan
cy which tbey now hold in defiance of the
great majority of the people. ,? Jo or threo
notorious sheets claimirg to be Democratic
have recently declared in favor of the hum
bug in the same hope of partisan success.
though tho stupid:ty of the latter proposi
tion is too great to be worth considering.
In m ny instances Abolitionists claim to
favor it on the general ground of justice to
the negro race, and that the negroes hhould
le admitted to social and political equality
as at abstract right, without reference to
the effect of such a change upon the coun
try. But in no instance that we can now
recall has' there been a rational sensible
attempt made to show that the introduction
of the negro element would promote . the
political, commercial and material interests.
ot the social -happiness of the people, simply
because no. reasonable man can affirm that
such would be the effect Demagogues
who eare for nothing but their own ad
vancement, or fanatics who are utterly in
differeul as to the financial or social con
dition of their own race, preach and howl
about negro raff race as if it was on indis
putable right belonging to the negro, for
the witholding of which no just reason can
be given; but these people carefully refrain
from citing the examples of similar experi
ments to show that it confers a benefit on
either raw, and as carefully omit to refer to
those well known instances where the
equality they seek to introduce has been
destructive to the ipatorial and social inter
ests of both races. In no country where
tho mad project of negro equality has been
tried, has it failed to involve the govern
ment, in ruin, and the p-ople in tbe lowest
depths 'or degradation.'. The appalling
social degradation and political disintegra
tion of the South American . States are
frightful examples of the effects of the
mongrelism which the Abolitionists, as a
mere political expedient, would now engraft
upon this country.. . The character is in
compatible with enlightened freedom and
the exerise of high political rights. Had it
been otherwise, the South American State,,
would not be the seething cauldrons of dis
cord that 'hey are. Had itbeon otherw'me,
the negroes of the South would have l ing
since gained and maintained the thing their
worshippers now seek for them.
The introduction of .negro suffrage as an
element in our politics can have no less de
structive effect thai) the reduction of popu
lar elections (already sufficiently farcical) to
a mere mockery. Where the negroes are
most numerous and ignorant, there would
thjy have the mi-st power. In many local
ities they would have complete cortrol, and
such localities would speedily retrogate into
jungles. . In others thijy would have enough
strength' to be an element of danger, nnd
confusion. Everywhere they would be con
trolled by demagngres of the lowest order:
everywhere would they be an element of
discord; everywhere would there be disgust
and danger, ..until the people, becoming
afraid of themselves, would coireiiinlfite
with complacency the establishment of a
despotism that would do away with this
mockery of popular elections. . lhis is lie
real object of the oligarehists who have t he
agitation under control. They want a moir
"ved aristocracy, exemption liom the mir-
dens of the Government, with the privilege
to draw their own enormous interests and
blood money- from the masses. They tear
that their own vast and shaky public debt
will some day become as burdensome to the
working people as is the public debt of En
gland to her laboring closse;, and then our
laboring masses would be as ready to shake
it down wish their votes as are the poor of
England to shake off the- debt which de
grades them and pampers their aristocracy-
. ', .. :' . . .
One of the evils of this monstrosity of
negro suffrage is the prospective disfran
chisement of' the laboring white' peoplo by
the introduction of new qualifications.
This whole Abolition revolution has been a
revolt in the direction of despotism as
against d mucraxjy, and negro auffnge and
popular disfranchisement are essential to
the complete triumph of despotism. .. ., i
The Oldest House li New tlam-
h Si I re. ';',.
The following is from, tho Portsmouth
(N. II.) Journal: , . ,
"The oldest house bow standing, built in
Portsmouth, isi tlm quaint briqk houso on
the Weeks' farm, Greenland. This is no
blunder although it seems like one for at
tho time that'' nouse was built, Greenland
was a part of Portsmouth; Ve o:w find no

but a family tradition dates its creation iu
1037, by the father of. Leonard Weeks.
The house was built on the mailt road,' but
the straichteninir of the road half a century
ago, throws it on-a circular and several rods
on the si Jo. ' 'lm' speckled appearance of
the house is made by having black headers
scattered among th'J. bricks all over the
front. The bricks were burnt in front of
the house. The walls of the house ". 're
eighteen inches thick. It is of two-stoiies;
the lower etory is uilit airl a na! teet, the
second eurlH reet. Ibe windows were
originally fit small diamond glass set in lead.
Some of them havo been in the house with

the plastering is on reft wood nailed to the

being inj jred , by i an marks of the house

ocrats generally mat it is ineir amy yo aia
in circulating sound paper, and in discour
aging the circulation of unbound ones, than
at at y former lime. But we are also con
vinced that in this respect we aro still far
behind our opponents. Thy will rarely
even tntu-h or read a Democratic paper, and
while this is carrying bigotry too tar, yet
Dt-mocrats nftt n err inoxaotly the opposite
extreme. For twenty five een's per year,
or some trifle equally as inconsiderate, they
will be induced tn Mthst-ribe for a paper that
will poison the minds of their children, and
make them inveterate ADoiitionists. ine
Abolition party having nearly all the mi.
nepotists, traders and manufacturers at the
North on their side, and i-apported as tln-V
arc mainly by the advertising patronago of
the mnnopoli t classe-1, tliey are ntten enab
led to outstrip more humble Democratic
newspapers that stand by the rights of the
people. These papers care only to get
enough to pay the more cost of their circu
lation, the profits of their business being in
advertising, of which only a limited amount
can be secured by Democratic papers
Democrats, if in earnest in sustaining tbeir
prireiples, ought really to pay at least one
third more for their pajiers than the Abo
litionists do for theirs, and even this would
not begin to be equivalent to uivtr adver
tisihg patronage, ' .
Our readers will see from this the disad
vantages under which Democratic papers
labor. It is no more than justice, to say
thet every man who now tuiolUlies a ireal
Democratic papfcr, does a self sacrificing
work, and taken as a class, we know of no
truer or more patriotic men than the Dem
ocratic editors of the Jfwthcru States. ' As
a body, they aro far in advance of the poli
ticians, who, in many instances, are a dew
weight upon them. We say, therefore, that
if there are any classes or men who deserve
well of Democrats, it is, taken as a whole
the Democratic editors. We urce, there
fore, that Democrats generally should try
to understand the difficulties under whiflh
their edi;ori labor, and when they seo what
advantages the Abolition press havo ever
them they, will feel like tiikiug hold and
aiJing them with material aid in their un
e.inai fi;;ht.
As the New Year approaches, let syste
matic efforts be made to givo a wido ex
tension to Democratic journals. . Active
Democrats "hould commense early making
out lits of those who ought to. and proba
bly in!! take (it called upon) a local paper.
Let it bo the business ot some one to see
his Democratic neighbors, and urge upon
them the necessity of sustaining their p"
pers. Don't wait until some Abolitionist
has been along ami got them to subscribe
for some' out and out M'ongn l sheet, or
some namby-pamby "Conservative" paper,
which is just as bad. Remember that ut
most every postmaster, tax gatherer, and
every clergyman, is an ajient for the monop
olists, negro-equalizers, and public plunder
ers. Democrats must be doubjoy vigilant,
if they would pirpetuate their principles
and save republican institutions from com
plete overthrow and their children from the
crushing taxation of a moneyed aristocracy
and a monopolist's despotism. Day Bonht

A Bold Feat.
The following from the Buffalo E.epresx,
is rather difficult to believe, but it miy be
true: . -1 ' ;. ' . '
A painf'ull-intcnso excitement Was ex
perienced by hundreds of people living
along Niagara River on Tuesday afternoon,
at the sighl of a vessel, w ith three men on
board, being rapidly borne down w!h the
current toward the falls, without any up
parent possibility ot rescue from the shore.
The facts are as follows', ' '
As a small Canadian trading Mmoner,
the .Whip. Captain J. T. Young, was being
towed out of Chippewa Harbor by the tug
Buffalo, the line bv which she was attached
to the tug was broken by ihe strmgth of
tho current,, and she was. swiftly carried
dnwu towarjj the rapids ab ivo the falls. -Th
captain two men : op beard saw at
once that they"' were in imminent 'danger,
havim? neither anchor nor small boat, and
being in such a position tht po one dared
attempt their rescue from the shore. By
this time hundreds of people were gathered
along the banks,' expecting nothing else
than certain destruction to the vessel and
her crew; but when within a couple of hun
dred yards of the commencement of ihe
rnpi'ls, the eViol head of thi Captdin con
oeivedan idol which saved tha lives of the
whole party as well as the vessel. There
were quite a (rale blowing up the river at
the time, and the master, wit!1 tho aid of
the two men.jseeing all other relief' out of
the question,-ordered all the sails hoisted,
and sailed out of the very jaws of death,
against the powerfull current of the river,
absolutely landing soon after at Hog Island
in safety, naving gone further down the
Niagara River than any other man ever
did in a bont'und escape, v "'-i
Ihe ad.inraMon and reliet ot the. people
along tho river banks, upon- the execution
'of the Captain's plan, found vent in frequent
cheers when It became .apparent that his
efforts would prove efforts would prove

Taking Sheep to thi West. The
Wheeling (Ya.) JuUefpcrr says. "The
taking- of sheep from Ohio and Brooke
counties, in this State and Washington
county, Pa., to tha West, aoJ patting them
out on shares has got to be a rat her exten
aive and profitable busiuCea. Ws have
known of several instances lately jn which
large profits have been realized. .'.Most of
the sheep thus put out have beta taken tn
Illinois, but a great many have gone also
to Westetp-4hifi and Indiana. The prooess
is to drive in t ay a hundred head of goo I
average sheep, and fin J a farmer who is
willinif to take them on his farm, attend to
them and divide the wool an J the increase
Kvfrv rear. Tho nrofks to the man who
puts out the sheep run np very .fast by this
arrangemei t, an 1 the bargain also pays the
farmer abundantly well for his trouble.
Sh'ep that can be bought in this. county for
two and three d-nars are wortnin me esi
five snd six The margin Of profit is very
handsome. . In this connection ... we may
mention a recent transaction with a gentle
man in Fargwvr county, Virgiaia, by which
he has been furnished with a thousand
sheep on shares for for a term of '.t?n years
He is to graav thorn on his farm, and at the
end of that tima restore a like number to
the seller, and in the meantime divide equal
ly the. wool and the inoreaso of the flock."
A Western exchange says that about a
month ago a party of young men hired a
sleeping car in Philadelphia, which, they
s-tored with all the luxuries and necessaries
desired for a buffalo hunt, and traveled in
it all the way to Fort Riley. Two miles
from Fort Riley the varty hired ambulan
ees, which eonveyod them betwern two. and
three hundreds miles distant,-whore herds
of buffalo were grazing. Having -killed five
or six of the huge animals, and enjoyed them
seivea to their heart's., content, the .party
returned, having been gono about three
weeksj and having traraJod the- whole dis
tance from Philadelphia to Fort Riley in a
sing'e sleeping rar. ; '"' ' ,u
