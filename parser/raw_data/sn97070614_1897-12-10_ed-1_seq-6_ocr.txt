U the well-known grocer, nt 621 N.Saginaw
Btreet, and thnt the statement he makes her
is true in every particular, goes without
saying. This is what he says:
M For as Jong as four years 1 suffered fro"
pains across my hack over the kidneys,
was that old backache, sometimes better and
sometimes worse. Anyone who has experi
enced such 11 pain will understand how dis
tressing it is. 1 was continually annoyed l.v
its presence. 1 knew the kidneys were at
fault, as there were other signs of kidney
disorder. That pain across the kidneys had
become very constant. If I accidentally
jarred mytelf, I would feel it much worse for
a time. One day I happened to read about
a remedy for the kidneys called Doan's Kid
ney Pills. I determined to try them, so 1
went to Dullam Bros.' drug store and pro
cured a box. I had taken only a few doses
when I felt relief tromtlie pain, I continued
to use them, taking altogether three boxes,
ami they have cured me. The backache is
entirely removed and I have felt its good
since as I ever did in mv life. Doan Kid
ney Pills are truly a kidney cure. As long
as I have a chance T shall recommend and
peak a good word for them, advising others
to use them."
Kvervwheie von go 'tis just the same as
this. No article or medicine has ever caused
such a stir in the world from it extraordi
nary properties as has Doan's Kidnev Pills
People call them "The little conquerors ol
kidney trouble," " The littlespecialist," "The
little enemies to backache," and many other
such names, and thev have good reason to.

C0NGRESS IN SESSI0N-
National Legislators Ready for Busi
ness at the Old Stand.
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY AT HIS POST
In Order to See the Statesmen Started
at Tl eir Work.
Plenty ofBunlneim Ready To Be Attended
To Meksttge Duly Read In Both
Iluuitn-home Prominent Ques
tions That Confront the
Congressmen.
Washington, Dec. 6. The regular, or
long session of congress, as it is called,
because there is no constitutional limi
tation upon the period of its duration,
opened at noon today. The leaders and
a large majority of the members of both
houses were here to participate in the
opening ceremonies, and President Mc
Kinley made the journey to Washing
ton from the bedside of his dying moth
er that his absence might not delay the
national legislature at its assembling.
The house was called to order by the
speaker, and prayer having been said
and the roll called and the presence of
a quorum demonstrated, the clerk was
directed to notify the senate that the
house was ready for business, and a
committee was appointed to wait on the
president. After that there was a re
cess to await the arrival of the presi
dent's annual message, which was
read upon its reception. It is the in
tention of the house leaders to proceed
with the business of the session as rap
idly as possible. The committees will all
begin their labors this week, and as all
of them have more or less bills on hand
which were Introduced at the extra ses
a slon there will be no lack of material
for the house to work on after the com
mittee hoppers have begun to grind.
Some beus.ttions In PronpeoU
The appropriations committee has
been at work for ten days and Chair
man Cannon expects to pass at least
two of the regular budgets before the
holidays the legislative, executive and
judicial and the pensions appropriation
bills. Among the early general meas
ures to receive consideration will be the
bankruptcy bill. Beyond doubt there
will be several resolutions of inquiry
during the week which may be more or
leas- sensational, and some of the radical
pro-Cuba members will attempt to get
consideration for a Cuban resolution be
fore the foreign affairs committee can
act. Representative Livingston, of
Georgia, is one of these. But owing tc
the nature of the house rules all these
hasty efforts will prove abortive, and
the resolutions will probably take their
regular course.
Three Hundred Bills In the Senate.
There was nothing except indisposi
tion on the part of members to prevent
the senate entering promptly upon Its
work upon convening today, as there
was a calendar already made for it
with about 300 bills reported from com
mittees during the special session. But
H is not customary for the senate to be
In a hurry about most things. The reg
ular routine of opening was duly ob
served; the committee to notify the
president that the senate was ready for
business was appointed, performed its
duty and reported. The president's
message was received and read, and
what may happen before adjournment
is reached had not developed at this
writing. The indications are now for a
little more activity than usual during
the pre-holtday session. This is largely
due to the fact that the supporters of
the administration and advocates of an
nexation are very anxious to secure the
earliest possible consideration of the
treaty with Hawaii.
Long Mesaion of CongreNM Begins.
Washington, Dec. 7. Nothing sensa
tional occurred at the opening of the
Fifty-fifth congress Monday. In both
house and senate the galleries were
filled with a curious crowd, and both
houses were full on the floor. The sen
ate was made gay with floral tributes
sent to the desks of senators by their
friends. The body was duly called to
order, a committee appointed to Inform
the president that such was the fact
and in due time the message arrived
and was read and was listened to with
attention. After the reading the senate
adjourned.
In the house Dingley, Bailey and
Grosvenor were selected as the commit
tee to call on the president and notify
htm that the house was In seslson. Then
the message was read, receiving a
round of applause at the close. Then In
honor of the memory of Senator George,
of Mississippi, and Representative
Wright, of Massachusetts, deceased
during the recess, the house adjourned.
There were a number of bills intro
duced, among them one to establish the
postal savings bank system.
Washington, Dec. I In the senate
yesterday 108 bills, many of them for
private pensions, were introduced with
several joint resolutions. Money, the
new senator from Mississippi, was
sworn In. A discussion as to right of
way for Lodge's immigration bill was
pending at adjournment.
The house, after a spirited debate,
divided the president's message among
the umrriHtees. Grosvenor made an at
tack on the civil service reform law,
which was warmly defended by John
son of Indiana, who charged Grosve
nor with being derelict In his duty to
the Republican party, which he said
had repeatedly Indorsed the law.
Ity Elections In M assachusetts.
Boston, Dec. 8. Seventeen of the
thirty-two cities of the commonwealth
hoi their municipal elections yester
day. In a majority of cases the Repub
licans were successful in electing their
mayor anil securing control of the city
government, although the results show
that the idea of independent or non
partisan COEtfOl of municipalities is
st"iidily STo.vlng In favor.
MESSAGE OF THE" PRESIDENT.
Salient Points of the Document That Was
Read to Ooagpnas Monday.
Washington. Dc. 7. President Me
Kinley's message to congress begins
with the currency question, and his
recommendations in that respect, out
side of an approval of Secretary Gage's
banking plan, is contained in the fol
lowing: "I earnestly recommend, as
soon as the receipts of the government
are quite sufficient to pay all the ex
penses of the government, that when
any United States notes are presented
for redemption in gold and are re
deemed in gold, such notes shall be
kept and set apart and only paid out in
exchange for gold."
In regard to Cuba he takes sub
stantially the same position as that
assumed by President Grant during the
previous revolution. His conclusion of
the whole matter la that, as Spain has
now evidently begun a policy of real
reform for the island, which proposes
reasonable terms of settlement of the
long-existing trouble, the government
of the United States should not inter
fere, until It is evident that this policy
is not accomplishing the results de
sired. The president strongly recommends
the ratification, by the senate, of the
treaty providing for the annexation of
the Hawaiian islands. In considering
other governmental affairs, the presi
dent extols the work of the bimetallic
commission; recommends Immediate
legislation for the improvement of the
conditions in Alaska; advocates the
establishment of a special commission
to investigate the causes of. and
remedies for. yellow fever; discusses the
sale of the Pacific railroads, and favors
the maintenance and possible extension
of civil service reform. He urges con
gress to observe the strictest economy
in appropriations.
CRISIS REACHES HAYTI.
It Is Brought There by a Conple of Ger
man War hi pa.
Port au Prince, Haytl, Dec. 7. The
trouble between Germany and Haytl,
the result of the arrest and imprison
ment of Herr Lueders, an alleged Ger
man subject, reached a crisis yester
day. Two German cruisers entered this
port during the morning, and an ulti
matum from the German government
was delivered to the Haytlen govern
ment, giving the latter eight hours In
which to grant the demands of Ger
many for an indemnity to Herr Lued
ers. The members of the diplomatic
corps here believe the government of
the republic has decided to accept the
conditions of Germany. In anticipation
of trouble the citizens of German na
tionality sought refuge Sunday on
board two steamers which were at this
port, and the French steamer Ville de
Marseille has been requisitioned by the
French minister in order to serve as a
place of refuge for French citizens. The
Tille de Marseille has arrived here di
rect from Porto Rico. The population
f this place is in a state of great ex
citement, but the Haytlen government
has strong forces of troops at its dis
posal and is resolved to maintain order.
RECOGNIZED BY HIS MOTHER.
President McKlnley's Dearest Wish Has
Been Granted at Canton.
Canton, O., Dec. 8. The president and
Mrs. McKinley arrived yesterday morn
ing. The fondest hopes the family has
cherished since the affliction came was
that the president might be permitted
to be present when the Inevitable disso
lution came and that the mother might
again realize his presence and he know
that he had been recognized. These
hopes have been granted them and they
now patiently and resignedly await the
end.
The scene in the sick room when the
president arrived was touching and pa
thetic. He gazed upon the dearly-beloved
face, showing only an emotion of
Joy when the mother's eyes opened and
her face lighted up with a smile of rec
ognition and of greeting. Then as he
stooped to kiss and caress her he felt
the tender entwining of her arm about
his neck. The president remains al
most constantly at the bedside.
Haytlan Incident Closed.
New York, Dec. 8. Advices from Port
au Prince, Haytl, say that President
Simon Sam has agreed to all the Ger
man demands and saluted the German
flag, the salute being returned by the
two German school ships now In the
harbor and which was all the naval
force Germany sent here. What this
"climb down" may mean for President
Sam is in the future. It may mean a
revolution, for the people are anything
but pleased with the humiliation of the
German affair, which, however, may be
considered closed.
Knd of the Railway Hearing. '
Washington, Dec. 4. -The hearings of
railroad men before the interstate com
merce commission In the matter of ex
tending the time for the equipment of
railway cars with safety appliances
have come to an end. but there will yet
be some testimony given under oath.
It Is hardly probable that the commis
sion will extend the time more than
three years, and It may only extend it
a year at a time, requiring each railway
to do a proportionate amount of equip
ment each year on pain of having the
penalty applied.

GAGE SEES DEFICIT8.
One for the Y.-ar f ifcMH.KOO.OOO und Over
$31,000,000 for Next.
Washington, Dec. 8. A notable thing
about the report of Secretary Gage, of
the treasury, Is that he figures out a
deficit not only for the current year,
but also for the next year. He esti
mates the deficit for the current fiscal
year at $28,000,000 and for next year at
121,647,885. With reference to the tariff
he says: "It is confidently believed
that when in full operation it will afford
ample revenue for the ordinary needs
of the government, while adequately
protecting our manufacturing and
agricultural interests. But the im
portant part of Secretary Gage's report
relates to the something necessary to
be done to put the currency on a dlf
fereut basis.
Upon this point he recommends the
establishment of a division in the treas
ury department to be designated the
issue and redemption division. To this
should be turned over all matters re
lating to the Issue and redemption of
currency; it should be furnished with
$120,000,000 in gold set over from the
general fund of the treasury, with all
the silver dollars now held for re
demption of silver certificates and with
$200,000,000 in legal tender notes of the
United States to be disbursed only in
exchange for gold. This is the plan
referred to in the president's message.
As to the currency he recommends
that the organization of national banks
be permitted with a minimum capital
f $25,000 in places of 2,000 inhabitants,
that the rate of taxation on circulation
be reduced to half of 1 per cent, and
that the banks be permitted to issue
notes to the par value of 2 per cent,
refunding bonds (the issue of which he
advises) when deposited with the treas
urer of the United States, or green
backs, treasury notes or silver certifi
cates similarly deposited to a total
amount of $200,000,000.
And here the secretary makes the fol
lowing recommendation: "After said
banks have deposited such bonds,
greenbacks, treasury notes or silver
certificates to the amount of 50 per
cent, of their capital they shall be per
mitted to issue bank notes in addition
to the 50 per cent, thus provided to the
extent of 25 per cent, of such deposit,
which said 25 per cent, may be unse
cured by any direct pledge of security,
but issued against the assets of the
bank." Gage would extend the gov
ernment guaranty to all national bank
notes, whether issued against deposited
security or against assets.
To secure the government against
loss he would impose a tax of 2 per
cent, per annum on the unsecured cir
culation for a "safety fund," and also
make the government's claim a first
lien upon all assets in case of failure
of the issuing bank. All national bank
notes to be of the denomination of $10
and upwrad. The secretary argues the
expediency and safety of his plan in
extenso, basing it primarily on the
recognized necessity for a reduction in
the volume of the demand liabilities
"now constituting a menace to the pub
tic treasury."
Need S-nvi.S47.sss to Ran Us.
Washington, Dec. 7. Secretary Gage
yesterday transmitted to congress the
estimates of appropriations required for
the service of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1899, as furnished by the sev
eral executive departments. The total
amount called for by the estimates is
$462,647,885, which Is about $32,000,000 in
excesB of the appropriations for 1897,
Including deficiencies and miscellaneous,
and about $41,000,000 more than the es
timates for 1898.

JUDGE BUCK KILLS HIMSELF,
He Was an Annotate Justice of the Hu
preme Court of Montana.
Helena, Mont., Dec. 8. Judge Horace
R. Buck, associate Justice of the su
preme court of Montana, shot himself
through the right eye about midnight
at his home In Lenox, a suburb of Hel
ena. He had spent the evening with a
party of friends at a neighbor's house,
seeming very cheerful. After chatting
for a while with his family he went to
his room, and soon afterwards the shot
that ended his life was fired. His wife
ran upstairs and found him lying on the
floor dead.
The judge had been breaking down in
health for some time and it is expected
he was seized with a sudden Impulse
to end his uneasiness. He was 54 years
of age and a native of Vlcksburg, Miss.,
and a graduate of Yale. He came to
Montao in 1879.

Of the Breast.
Mr. A. H. Crausby, of 158 Ken St.,

paid no attention to a small lump which
appeared in her breast, but it soon de
veloped into a cancer of the worst type,
and notwithstanding the treatment of
the best physicians, it continued to
spread and grow rapidly, eating two
holes in her breast. The doctors
soon pronounced
her incurable. A
celebrated New York
specialist then treat
ed her, but she con
tinued to grow worse
and when informed
that both her aunt
and grandmother had
died from cancer he
gave the case up as
hopeless.
Someone then re

and though little hope remained, she
begun it, and an improvement was no
ticed. The cancer commenced to heal and
when she had taken several bottles it
disappeared entirely, and although sev
