A CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE
FORMULATED.
The arguments against the holding
of a constitutional convention all re
solve themselves to these two points:
"It costs money to hold a constitu
tional convention," an argument
which applies as well to any other
kind of convention, party, church or
social, and "that It will do no good
to hold a constitutional convention,"
an argument which can also lie
urged against the holding of any oth
er kind of convention, for an argu
ment of that kind is as hard to dis
prove as it is to prove it, for it offers
no definite basis for any contention
as it all depends upon the point or
view. Any one can say: "There is no
use holding a legislative session and
none ought to be held because the
money might be saved."
Against these specious arguments
can be set the more definite conten
tions that the Territory of New (Mex
ico has elected at some trouble and
some expense to itself and to Indi
viduals, a body of sixty-six represen
tative men, who stand high in their
respective communities and in their
commonwealth, for the purpose of
gathering at the city of Santa Fe to
formulate a constitution for a pro
posed state that was to include New
Mexico. The fact that Arizona de
clined to enter in this arrangement,
does not preclude the assembling of
these sixty-six men for the purpose
for which they were elected, and
there is pending nt Hi la very day a
bill In the U. S. 'Senate providing for
the admission of New Mexico as a
state. It can also be urged with con
siderable force that the Republican
party, which has elected 41 of the
fiG delegates, pledged itself in conven
tion assembled at Las Vegas, to the
holding of such a convention ami that
this ipledge induced many people to
vote for statehood who were opposed
to it in the form offered but favored
single statehood. To break this party
pledge without very strong reasons Is
a breach of faith that the Republican
party will rue as a demonstration of
insincerity of the party on the ques
tlon of statehood. It can also be
urged that the adoption, of a good con
stitution, ratified by the Legislative
Assembly, may and probably would
indf.ee Congress "o admit New Mex
ico without further formality, and un
der the most liberal provisions possi
ble, as it would prove a fitness of
self government and a sincerity of de
sire that, would refute the charges of
insincerity and unfitness and would
leave Congress no excuse, except that
of sectionalism, to keep New Mexico
out of the Union any longer. The ef
fect of formulating such a constitution
should also have a beneficial effect
upon the legislation of the coming as
sembly and would be a good advertise
ment to the world of New Mexico's
desire to be a state and of its voters
to become citizens.
The final question of authority to
convene this convention can be found
in the authorized election of these
delegates, and if this is deemed in
sufficient, then in the general desire of
the people for statehood as expressed
nt. the polls last month. The Conti
nental Congress did not wait for a call
from King George; the Republican
or Democratic parties never wait for
a srmnions by the President of the
United States before assembling in
national convention. In fact, the
last named have no legal standing
greater than that of any other body of
citizens, to get together and nomi
nate any man thej desire for the
Presidency. If such man is elected,
lie would be as much R esident of the
United Slates as if he had been nom
inated by a convention that had been
called by the Congress or the Presi
dent of the United 'States, History
shows that more than one common
wealth held a constitutional conven
tion, formulated a constitution and
adopted it before it became a state
and without such a convention having
been authorized by Congress. What
has been done in other states can be
done in Xew Mexico. In fact, if New
Mexico does not hold a constitution
al convention under present circum
stances, posterity and historians will
regard It as an evidence of lukewarm
mess, of faint heartedness, of disgrace.
that will bo forever held as a blot
upon the memory of the present citi
zenship.
MORE FAKIR JOURNAL LIES
NAILED.
The Albuquerque Fakir Journal is
ait it again. It. claims that the normal
Republican majority in New Mexico
has been 10,000 votes during recent
elections and that the slump In the
Andrews vote on November Cth last,
iwas brought about because Mr. An
drews was an ': unworthy candidate"
and "had been forced upon the Re
publican ticket by dishonest and dis
honorable means." As usual the Fak
ir Journal tells lies.
The following Is the vote on the
Delegate daring the past ten years

These figures give the lie direct
to the assertions of the Fakir .Journal
that 10.000 majority has been the av
erage Republican strength in the
Sunshine Territory for years past .
Delegate Andrews was nominated
unanimously by a convention chosen
by fair means in honestly conducted
primaries by a great majority of the
Republican voters of the Territory. As
far as the condition in Iternalillo
County is concerned, it was pretty
much a case of the put calling Hie
kettle black, and everybody who Is
acquainted with the situation there
and desires to be fair, knows this to
be a fact. Without, the Bernalillo
County delegation, Delegate Andrews
would have been nominated by an ov
erwhelming majority in the l,as Vegas
convention. The Heiiialilio County
delegation absolutely nit no figure
and was nut considered of any im
portance by the Republican delegates
on account of the row and spilt In
the (party there. Figures of the elec
tion on November Mil last show con
clusively that in the counties where
them was the greatest difference be
tween the Republican vole for nomi
nations on county tickets and the can
didate for Delegate to Congress, the
charges that were made against the
Delegate's personal and official char
acter had nothing to do with the case.
In Rio Arriba County, for instance,
where Delegate .Andrews fell 700 and
more votes short of the regular Re
publican ticket, the fact of the crea- j
tion of the .leniez forest reserve anil j
the charge that 'he was Instrumental
in Ms creation for the benefit or the
cattle kings, cost him the voles he
lost there to the greatest degree.
This is too well established to be suc
cessfully contra. lioted. In San Miguel
County, there is no question that the
Democratic County und legislative
ticket was put. into the field simply
for the purpose of trading in favor of
l.anazolo on the Delegate vote. This
was done and accounts for at least
three-fourlihs of the large vote gained
by l.arrazolo over Andrews in tint
section.
These examples can be carried out
and similar reasons sfiown in every
one, of tihe few counties in the Terri
tory where the Delegate . fell behind
the regular Republican ticket. These
are facts despite the falsehoods, equiv
ocations and misrepresentations ad
vanced by t)he Albuquerque Fakir
.Journal. Any fair minded man at all
acquainted with political conditions
in New 'Mexico will so decide even af
ter only a cursory examination of the
situation and of the-conditions dur
ing the last campaign and on las!
election day.
REDUCTION IN PASSENGER
FARES.
The passenger departments of the
several Western railroads are getting
together on the question of reducing
passenger rates. If they do so they
will be acting timely and sensibly nnd
the sooner they act the bett"r for all
concerned. The first step in that di
rection will be In cost of mileage
books. It is stated from the head
quarters of many railroads centering
In Chicago that by so doing they
hope" to mollify the public sentiment
which Is demanding reductions in
passenger fares. The present 2,000
mile book of the Western Passenger
Association costs $00, a refund of
$19.50 being given for the cover. A
proposition to reduce t he price of I he
book to $50 and the refund to $!)..r,0
probably will be adopted at a siieclal
meeting of the mileage bureau next
week. It is also proposed to place on
sale a 1,000 mile book for $::fl, giving
a refund of $5. There has been no
change in the western mileage book
for ten years.
The German Reichstag has shown
its spirit of independence by refusing
to grant the ' government additional
vast sums for colonial experiments,
in view of the fact that German colo
nizaticn in Africa has thus far proved
a collossal failure. The vote was
close but nevertheless, the Reichstag
has been dissolved and new elections
will have to be held to disclose the
temper of the country as far a.s the
unfair election laws will permit. If
vote counted for vote as it does in
the United States, the Socialists
would control the next Reichstag, but
fortunately for the German Empire
although unfortunately for the cause
of liberty, one citizen Is not as good
as another when it comes to voting in
Germany and the men who vote the
Socialistic ticket do not happen to lie
the property owning class or the no
bility. Senator Piatt now says he will not
resign unless forced to. . He would be
forced fast enough, if those hanker
ing for his seat only knew how.

THE NEW CLERK OF THE FIFTH
DISTRICT.
Judge William H. Pope, presiding
judge of the Fifth Judicial District,
composed of the counties of Chaves,
Eddy and Roosevelt, did the right
tiling at the right time in the ap
pointment of Samuel I, Roberts, of
Carlsbad, to be clerk of the court, vice
Caul M. Bird, deceased. Mr. Roberts
has been a resident of Carlsbad for
seventeen years; he is a businessman
of excellent reputation, a citizen of
high standing, a public spirited man
and a true and staunch Republican
wfio has done yeoman service for his
parly In that stronghold of the. unter
rilled Texas and South Carolina Dem
ocracy in New Mexico. He has also
had the necessary experience fully to
qualify liim for the Important posi
tion, having served as deputy district
court clerk for Eddy County fctr a
number of years, All in all, Judge
I'ope coii'ld not. have made a better
selection and the NeX Mexican glad-
Iv makes this record.
THE NEW MEXICO INHERITANCE
LAWS.
The laws of Inheritance of the Tor
ritotv of New .Mexico are a mixture
of fetulalistic Ideas and more modern
notions, with no attempt at harmon
izing these two tendencies. The re
sult is a contradictory, indefinite, In
complete jumble of provisions that
do no inspire confidence or add to
the security of property. 11 opens the
way to fraud and injustice and there
is more justification to the utterance
that "New Mexico Is a good enough
country to live in but a bad country
in which to die," than Is generally
acknowledged. The coming legisla
tive assembly in providing for a re
vision of the statutes of the Territory
would be Justified In taking this siep,
if there were not other reason than
to provide a new and modern code
of the laws on inheritance, lint as it
Is, revision Is not only needed but ab
solutely demanded of every part of
the bulky accumulation of fragmentary
legislation and of oul-of-dale statutes.
THE "PASTORES" IN SANTA FE.
Ober Amtnengaii gathers shekels by
the thousands through its Passion
I'lay, Itayreuih has added ftmie to a
lustrous name by ils musical festi
vals and other cities have gained re
nown and wealth by some distinctive
celebration. Santa Fe might feature
the "Pastores" or survivals of the me
dieval miracle plays. They ought to
lie advertised far and vyide as one of
.he distinctive features of life In this
ancient cily and as such would attract
many tourists annually. Of course,
Santa Fe must first provide an ade
quate auditorium, and should also
make provision for the systematic
i raining asd instruction of players.
The fact, that the "Pastores" are giv
n in the Spanish language adds to
their charm, especially if at a formal
performance ndveriised to the out
side world, the program, gave in
English the story of the play and the
words of the dialogue and songs.
It is beginning to look brighter for
separate statehood for the Sunshine
Territory. Immediately after the No
vember elections and the defeat of
joint, statehood, the New Mexican re
sumed the battle for separate state
hood and tor the just rights of the
Sunshine Territory. Many of the
newspapers have joined in the fight
and the people generally are very
willing. Again, nothing can be lost
and much can and would be gained by
persistent, anil strong efforts to ob
tain the pasfflge of an enabling act
either during the short session of the
present. Congress or during the first
session of the (loth Congress. The
iron is hot and now Is the time to
!ilt it.
U. S. Senator Henry M. Teller, ol'
Colorado, in Introducing his bill for
in Enabling Act for New Mexico, is
again proving himself a staunch and
rue friend of the Sunshine Terri
'ory. All hough on the opposite side
hi politics from the dominating -party
in the ailniinislraliiin and in Congress,
nevertheless, the Senator has done
veotimn work for New Mexico and is
ready and willing to do more. His
iilM, Is in the night direction and his
agitation of the subject would help
and will do great good even should
not the bill be favorably considered
luring the present session.
Delegate Andrews may not stand
well with ihe voters in Rio Arriba
County, or with those of Chaves Coun
ty, but. thai he has great Influence In
i he Congress of the United States Is
clear and a fact nevertheless. That
he has made a. first class Delegate is
only contradicted by the Albuquerque
Fakir Journal and a few 'hide-bound
South Carolina Democratic sheets In
the Territory. If there Is a chance
for the passage of the Teller bill for
an enabling act for New Mexico, Delo
gale Andrews will be fonnd In tin
front and in the thick of the fray
serving his .people wrtl and faithfully.

Miss Harmount
Original.
When the wealthy Miss Harmount
eti me to arrange for the hospital she
was to build I saw In her carriage a
lovely girl of twenty, attended by a
short, fat old woman, a sort of duenna,
I supposed, whose presence would pre
Tent uny liability to scandal. To me
the old woman served as a background
to bring out her companion's beauty.
I understood that Miss Harmount was
enormously rich; but, judging from
her apparel, which was plain, and her
expression, which was sad, her wealth
did not bring happiness. It occurred
to me that like families who dress
plainly und put their servants in gor
geous liveries she lavished the finery
she might have bedecked herself with
on her duenna, who was arrayed ill
silk, while her fingers sparkled with
jewels.
Miss Harniouut's face haunted me.
If I read, her dreamy eyes thrust
themselves between me and the page.
If 1 walked out, 1 saw them looking
down from the blue heavens. I was
Impatient for the evening, for I had
an invitation to a reception to be giv
en to Miss Harmount at the resldeiiee
of one of the magnates of the town.
I was so Impudent that I arrived
among the first. Miss Harmount was
standing with the hostess aud her
duenna "receiving." The host offered
to present me to her, but I told him
thut Miss Harmount belonged to us
ull, aud 1 went up and spoke to her.
I tried to say something about her
munificence, but she fixed her eyes up
on me with an embarrassed surprise,
and I supposed any reference to her
gift must be repulsive to her, so I
stumbled In my speech, whereupon she
smiled kindly.
(riving place to newcomers, I went
away to dream of the lady and to
blame myself for not remembering
that she must be surfeited with being
called generous. She was so surround
ed during the evening that I bad no
further opportunity to get a word with
her. Her duenna never left her, nnd I
Judged that she must have some secret
Influence over her companion and the
disposition of her millions, for I no
ticed that she received quite as much
attention as Miss Hiirmount. Doubt
less she was the key that unlocked the
money vaults ami decided for the
young heiress upon her bequests.
Miss Harmoimt made us several vis
Its during the summer. One day 1 was
passing the place where the hospital
was being erected, and. seeing her car
riage there, 1 went Into the grounds,
hoping to get a word with her. 1
found her sitting alone on a wooden
bench, while her dueunii, or manager
or whatever she might be, was walk
ing about the building superintending
the work us if she had been a man. I
approached Miss Harmount with hat
In bund and reminded her that I had
met her at the reception. She bad uo
need t: be reminded of the meeting.
Indeed ih soon as she saw me coming
her sad face lighted up with pleasure.
"You seem." I said, "to have an ex
cellent executive."
"She is a remarkable woman," re
plied Miss Harmount, with the same
smile she had given once before.
"I suppose you will never have p.
husband to manage your affairs?"
"Why not?"
"You women of wealth can never
know but that you are loved for that
wealth und not yourself. Therefore you
either do not marry or risk making a
mistake."
"You are right. That Is the penalty
women pay for large possessions."
Now t had been dreaming 'of Miss
Harmount ever since I bad first set
eyes on her. Yet I knew that her
wealth was uu inseparable barrier be
tween us. I chatted awhile with her
on the subject 1 bad started, saying
presently:
"Would It please you to know that
there Is one who would love you for
yourself alone?"
Miss Ilarinouiit lowered her eyes,
and a color camo to her cheeks.
"Yes."
"I know such a person."
"Who Is be?"
"To know who he Is would do you
no good. He Is poor. You are rich.
He would never take you and yovr
millions together."
"Would he have me give them up for
him?"
"No."
"Then why have you told me of his
love?"
"Because to know there Is one who
loves you for yourself alone must give
you pleasure."
Miss Harmount turned away.
"You have not told me this person's
name," she said presently. "Do not
tell It. This fortune, as you say, stands
between us. Think what a position I
might place him In if I were to say,
'Take me without the fortune.' "
"lie would be overjoyed If the for
tune bad never existed."
"You may tell me his name," she
said softly.
At this moment' I looked up and saw
the fat little figure of the manager
waddling toward us. I would have
wondered why so refined a girl as Miss
Ilsrmount should have selected so un
attractive a - person for an executive
were It not for her manifest capability.
My companion rose and its the old wo
maa joined us said:
"Miss Harmount, this gentleman we
met at Mrs. - 's reception."
For a few moments the situation
fulled to pierce my stupid skull. Then
It rushed upon me, and with It rushed
a great joy. The barrier between me
and ray love had vanished. She whom
I bad mistaken for Miss Harmount
was ber paid companion.

LEATHER CHAIRS.
5f7 defining Them With a Lullirr of
IuhIIIc Soup.
Leather on chairs is best cleaned with
wet rag and soap. Select a pure castlle
or white soap never a laundry variety
-mnke a lather with lukewarm water
and with a damp cloth rub suds Into
the leather with a rotary motion, cov
ering the entire surface so one part
will not be clean and another have a
soiled nppearauce. When the seat or
back has been well scrubbed In this
way, rub the surface dry with a soft
flannel cloth, nnd the spots should not
disappear, but the leather should be
as shiny as It was when new. Where
there are grease spots on the leather
they should have an extra washing and
should first be cleansed with the suds
and damp chamois or piece of cheese
cloth, so that any stain will come out
when the entire back or seat Is scrub
bed. I would never rub oils Into leathery
for most of them make the surfaces
sticky, especially during hot weather.
Then, too, the leather Is so prepared
that no oil Is necessary, the only essen
tial In care of such upholstery being
a dusting every day or oftener If con
venient and a washing with suds aud
a damp cloth once In two or three
weeks. Don't forget that leather, must
be carefully rubbed and kept warm In
winter, and remember that It Is a bad
plan to sit down quickly on a leather
seat that has been kept In a cold room
for several days, for the upholstery Is
likely to crack und split, just as patent
leather does.-Xew York Telegram.
TRUE HOSPITALITY.
It U Slot Mude Ip of (irand Meali and
Kiilertulumenta.
In a home thut I have in mind the
real spirit of hospitality Is shown at
Its best. There Is often no liiuld, and
sometimes the mistress of this house
hold is nearly overworked, but invaria
bly the guest Is mude comfortable. If
It Is a hot day a tray bearing lemou
ade. Iced tea or ginger ale and wafers
Is brought at once to refresh the caller,
or on u cool day It will be hot cocoa or
tea or a bouillon cup of hot soup. In
variably there is something to express
a kludly feeling for one's comfort, nnd
It Is never preceded with the query
whether you will have the cup if It
should lie prepared.
Many a hostess will ask ber guest If
he will have refreshment, and It Is
rare thut one replies that be will, for
the question itself Implies effort, some
thing that should never appear In a
hospitable offering. The overconsclen
tlous hostess, who fears that ber bev
erage muy not be made Just right or
that her china Is not quite fine enough,
misses much pleasure for herself and
guest. The beginner In housekeeping
would do well to acquire the habit of
putting the true spirit of hospitality
Into her homelife at the outset, and as
she grows older her home will have ac
quired a reputation for comfort and
cheer that an ostentatious dinner or
luncheon now und then will never con
fer. Chicago Inter Ocean.
DRESS HINTS.
Iu pressing ribbons with a hot Iron,
lay them between two sheets of maulla
paper, and they will come out like new,
In sewing a piece of material on the
bias to a straight piece the former Is
apt to become stretched. To avoid this
the bias should be placed underneath,
and it will then be sewn In evenly.
If sleeves are too long or too full
don't rip them out. First take a tuck
or. fold In the tops, making them the
desired length, and baste. Try on und
If right cut off the superfluous material.
Skirts should always be provided
with three bands one on the right
side, one on the left and one to hold up
the drapery at the back. If this pre
caution Is taken It is much better to
hang up a skirt than to fold It and lay
It away.
In making up any material with a
nap remember that the nap should al
ways run downward. This fact should
not be forgotten when sponging and
pressing, otherwise you will make a
shiny streak on the surface of your
material.
Clean lug a Library.
To clean a library properly one
should have a real reverence for books.
After the furniture is all removed from
the roonj and the floor has received the
attentlou to be given it, then turn to
the books. Take one shelf at a time.
Wipe each book as It Is removed from
the shelf. Have a small hair dust
brush and' with this brush the tops,
sides and bottom of the books. Be
very particular to replace the volumes
In the proper order. Nothing exas
perates a book lover more than to have
well arranged shelves mixed up by
bouse cleaning methods.
Fumigating a Room.
To fumigate, or disinfect, a room
place an ordinary house shovel over
the Are until It becomes thoroughly
heated (not red hot); move to the cen
ter of the room with- it and pour on It
an ounce of No. 4 or No. 5 carbolic
acid. The shovel should be so placed
that none of the fluid can ruu off on to
the floor. The carbolic will be given
off In a vapor which will be strong
enough to disinfect a room, and If gen
uine carbolic is used, which Is not a
mineral corrosive add, the vapor will
In no way injure pictures, metals or
fabrics.
When One I Nervous.
If you arc nervous remember this
simple rule: Nothing is so effective as
taking a drink of water every hour or
two. Medical meu declare that we
should be helped in various ways if
we were more thoughtful aud persist
ent in this respect. It Is certainly a
simple rule and one that is within
reach of the busiest among us,
