&WRKT*nrK<i, 0. K., Dec. 4. ? The
court opened at 10 this morning, ami
ha* been orcnpiril all day with tlit? trial
of o?? Emery Chaml>erlaiii. for murder. j
It ai\}ourm'?l at halfpast four, without
having finished this case.
Mr. Devlin, i?f Montreal, cnium'l fori
the Fenian prisoners, arrived here this!
mnruiug.
Ceneral Arerill, United States Consul
Gruersl for liriti**li America, is expected
here ki-u?orrow afternoon, to watch the
trials on behalf of his government.
The Grand Jury had the indictment
i>f the Fenian prisoners submitted to
tliein at 11 A. M., and were at work on
them till C o'clock. They will proluhly
make their presentment to-morrow, ami
the prisoner** against whom true hills
may he found will tlu-n he arraigned.
Their counsel is ready to proceed at once
with the trials, which it ts believed will
commence on Thursday.
The whole of Thursday will in all
probability be occupied with legal ar
gil mentR.
It is understood that the prisoners
counsel will take exception to thr juris
diction of the court, couteuding that
tlio provincial courts are not competent
to try charge* of high treason. 11" will
object also, it is said, to the act under
whioh they are to I mi tried, contending
that it is" not within the power of a
Parliament of a mere dependency of the
empire to enact laws defining what shall
constitute high treason, and thereby it
will be urged that the prisoner* cannot
bo tried under ail rx post facto law. The
tl'euces were committed in June and
the act in its present sham- did not be
come a law till the 15th of August, the
uct of thu titli of June having been
amended and superseded by another
subsequently introduced.
The prisoners bad a lively time this
afternoon. Two of them, Crawford aud
Dan Coborn, had a fight in the Fenian
ward, aud Coburn, who is a powerfully
I built man, punished his antagonist bad
ly. They began the fight with fists,
ami Coburn finally knocked ilio other
down mxl kicked him in the face, dam
aging his nose anil nearly knocking out
one of his eyes with the toe of his boot.
The difficulty, according to the story,
arose out of a discussion between the
two as to which had rendered the great
est service to the Fenian cause. Craw
j ford's version of it is tliat the subject
! of dispute was whether the parties who
j attempted to kidnap George Sanders
were acquitted or not. He says also
: that the difficulty was aggravated by a
' reference to an old gambling transac
| tion, in which Cobnrn hud lost some
money. Cobuni applied to him a very
oppriidons epithet, and the fight then
began.
The gaoler and his assistants having
entered the ward, secured Coburn and
removed him to a solitary cell in an
other part of the gaol, where he will 1m*
fed on bread and water and deprived of
his allowance of tobacco.
Scarcely had the ail'air been disposed
of when it was followed by a new ex
citement about a quarter of an hour
afterwards. The gaoler entered the
ward to lock up the prisoners f<* the
night. Ho found the door of an inner
compartment of the ward shut, and on
opening it he discovered one of the
prisoners, Thomas Madden, in the very
act apparently of attempting to set fire
to the gaol. IIe had tilled one of the
tin cans, used asacoll'ee cup, with burn
ing coal from the stove, and had it set
on the floor under the ash pan. The
theory is that he wanted to set lire to
the tloor, or more probably that he was
to cany the coals to his cell and set lire
to the bed clothes, in the hope that in
tlio confusion caused by an alarm of
tire the prisoners might succeed in
! effecting an escape.
Madden's story is that he wanted to
light his pij>e.
Orders have been givfenthat in future
two or three policemen shall remain in
tl;t> ward with the prisoners, to preserve
order and to prevent the repetition of
any attempts at incendiarism.
All is quiet in the village.
There are |very few strangers here
from the I'nitcd States. Perhaps there
will be more when the trials commence.
Meanwhile, the capabilities of i lie
neighboring villages to provide board
and rooms for the crowd of otlieials,
military officers, policemen and others
who have been attracted here by the
trials, are taxed to the very utmost.

Lorevuu, November 30.
Our hoy packers have been quite busy
yesterday an?l to-day. The market,
therefore, is quite active, with receipts
; by mail of near 10,000 head for the two
days, with several droves eii route for
the city from Shelby connty. The sales
yesterday amounted to about 1,000 head,
! at au average of tic gross; also a lot of
1 700 at Ctc gross. I o-day the market
j was steady at SJafik gross, being from
I Jafe better than other Western market
rates. Sales of 300 head of hogs at
j The aggregate of hogs killed unto this
evening is neat 17,000 head. ? [Journal.
St. Lor is, November 30.
I Hogs have been arriving in more lib
eral numbers and are st?i;wly ; packers
[operating more freely as the weather
| grows colder. Prices range from 00
to $?> 35 gross, the principal sales being
at $ti 1 .">.?(! *25; about 2,000 head were
sold.
Ci.kvki.and. Nov. 30.
The continued decline in the Eastern
markets on all hog products takes the
conlideace entirely out of the packers in
the West, and they are operating with j
the extremest caution. They do not
offer over 6c for live bogs, and G}a7 j lor j
dressed, light and heavy weights, and 1
are not anxious to purchase very heav- 1
ily at even those fignres. ? [Herald.
Detroit, Nov. 30.
The receipts were light to-day. Pack
ers ivdliered to Wednesday's rate, $8 00
for heavy, but the offerings were ab
sorbed by the retail trade, mostly at
f>0, and in some cases a still higher
figure was realized. There is to-day a
very favorable change in the weather,
and tliu season's business will no doubt
soon commence in earnest. ? [Post.
Chicago, November 30.
The market opened quiet. Huyers j
were holding off, and demanding a re
duction of 25a50c, but holders were
tirm in their views and would not yield,
and up to 10 o'clock comparatively little
was accomplished In the way of sales,
but later in the day a compromise was
patched up, and a fair business was
transacted at a decline of 15a25c per loo
ibs. About 3500 head were taken, at
prices ranging from $5 50a5 -5 for com
mon rough uneven lots, and $6at> 50 for
fair to choice hogs, averaging from 'Mill
to 350 lbs. A few sales were made in
the morning at ?G 55a6 G5. though the i
great lmlk of the sales were taken at |
and within the range of $6a6 :$5. The
offerings were pretty evenly divided
between shippers and packers. The
market closes quiet with a number lcl't
over unsold.
