Jfew Haven Director Charged
With Complicated Finance.
Janitor of Portland Building
3Iade a Company Official.
New York. Dec. 17. The tangled
financial transactions alleged to have
been engineered by Edward E. Rob
bin, former general counsel of the
New York. New Haven & Hartford
railraod. to get the steamships Harvard
and Yale to the Pacific coast, netted '
him a profit of (691,000, according to
the reckoning of the government
counsel from testimony adduced
Thursday in the trial of Robbins and
ten other former directors of the New
Haven road, charged with criminal i
violation of the Sherman law.
In an effort to unravel the skein
the government called to the s.and
Warren X. Chase of Hartford. Conn.,
Robbing's chief agent in the dealings.
The transactions had their center in
Charles W. Morse's defunct Metro
politan Steamship company, which
owned the Harvard and Yale, and tour
freight boats. The government al
leges that the New Haven wanted to
get rid of the competition of the two
passenger steamers and gain control
of the freight boats and -.hat in behalf
of the New Haven, Kobbins advised
the scheme by which it could be done.
The scheme included the organization
within a month's time of five com
panies, maritime and otherwise, and
affiliation with as many others.
With Robbins pictured as ihe direct
.ing genius of the activities- of the com
panies, the testimony described the
tfwitchinsr back and forth among them
of their stocks, bond?, etc., with the
nei. result, it appeared, that the Har
vard and Yale were leased to the Pa
cific Navigation company, one of the
new organizations. Kobbins had an
alleged profit of $691. 0'JO. the freight
boats were sold to the Eastern Steam
ship corporation, stock in which was
owned by the New Haven, and Rob
bins became the owner of 8.000 shares
of that corporation s stock personally,
both together being enough to con
stitute a majority.
Warren D. Chase insisted that Rob
bins had told him that he had en
gaged in the enterprise purely for his
personal profit and that he never
heard Robbins say the New Haven
was interested in it, or knew of any of
Robbins's co-defendants having knowl
edge of it.
How the Metropolitan Steamship
company of Maine, No. 2, another of
the hastily formed companies, was
organized was told by its incorporator.
Benjamin G. Ward, a lawyer of Port
land, Maine. He said he had formed
the company at the request of Chase.
"Who were its directors and offi- ;
cers '" asked Mr. Osborne.
"Well, as I recall them they were
Orovcr f. Richards, brother-in-law of
my partner. my stenographer. the
janitor in my buildlnsr. the assistant
janitor and somebody from a theater.
Richard." testified that at the re
quest of Chase as treasurer of the
c'omp.mv he signed checks as high as
$1,500,000. A youth at that time.:
scarcely over 21. he said, he did not
know what the checks were for and :
would hve been unable at tne lime iu
give anv account of the transactions.
KIDS GETTING WISE?
Topeka Stores Keep Too Many Santa
C'lauws on the Streets for
the Youngsters.
In their laudable efforts to bring a
really truly Santa Clans before the
eyes "of the boys and girls of Topeka.
enterprising Topeka merchants hnvo
played havoc with the childish faith
encouraged in many local households.
It i a common sight on Kansas ave
nue to see two Kris-Kringlcs dodging
in and out among the children, passing
out candy, waving their hands and
arousing the suspicion of the little
ones generally.
one Santa Claus wears a mask and
it doesn't fool the kids, either. They
can't understand why their patron
saint should hide behind the facial
covering. Just as the embarrassed
parent settles their inquisitive little
minds on this point, along conies an
other Santa with pink cheeks. blue
eyes and a regular honest-to-goodness
complexion.
"Why did Santa Claus take off that
thing?" asks the child.
"Why. mother, they don't look alike
at all "
"Oh, mamma, there goes one in an
automobile '
"Gee. daddy, deres goes another ,
Santa Claus and he '
What's a feller goin to do?
