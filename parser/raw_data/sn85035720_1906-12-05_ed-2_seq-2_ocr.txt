I President Tells of Unprecedent
J ed Prosperity Voices Many
Important Measures,
i *
J WASHINGTON. Dee. 5. ? Presiden
I Roosevelt, submitting bis animal inea
' sage to congress. opens ft l>y nIlb'iniDj
I that as a nation we still coutiuuie t(
I enjoy a literally unprecedented pros
| perity" and It is probable that oulj
I reckless speculation and disregard oi
legitimate business methods on tbt
part of the Imsiness world can matcrl
ally mar this prosperity:
No congress In our time, lie says, bat
done more good work of importance
than the preseat congress. There were
several mutters left unfinished at the
last session which he most earnestly
bop.es will be completed before ad
journment.
The features of the message arc as
I follows:
A law prohibiting corporations from
contributing to campaign funds.
Revision of the sttitutes to give the
government the right of appeal in both
civil and criminal actions against
trusts.
Capital punishment for rape.
Rigid enforcement of the eight hour
law where practicable.
Shorter hours for rgjlway employees..
Investigation of the conditions of the
labor of children and vomeu.
A more stringent employers' liability
act.
Provision for federal investigation ol
controversies beiween capital and la
bor. .
Withdrawal of public coal lands from
sale or entry.
Amendment to meat inspection law
providing for placing ^ates 011 cans.
Some method whereby at an early
date the. federal government may ex
ercise a more complete control ovei
corporations.
! "A graduated Inheritance tax and, if
| possible, a graduated income tax," tc
I lie accomplished "when next our sys
I teiu of taxation is revised."
Xatlona\ laws oa divorce and polyg
! amy. , ..
Subsfith's for the development of
! AineWiflt shipping.
Revision of the currency laws,
l.ower tariff or absolute free trade
for the Philippines.
Citizenship for the Porto Ricaus.
I j An act providing for the liaturnllza
j tion of Japanese.
The amendment of the statutes so
that we can enforce the rights of
aliens under our treaties.
That the nuv.v be maintained at its
' present strength by replacing obsolete
ships with new ones.
A new principle of selection in both
tin- anny and navy "which will bring
into the higher ranks fewer men and
these at an earlier age."
Of race suicide the president says it
is "a sin for which there is no atone
ment."
Here and there the reading of the
document was punctuated with ap
plause and hearty haudeluppiug from,
Democrats as well as Republicans fol- '
? lowing its conclusion. During the ma
jor portion of the time of the reudlng .
of the message Representative Lacey
of Ioivu acted as speaker pro tein., be- |
ing the lirst of the defeated stand pat
ters to be recognized by Speaker Can
non. ?
In the senate President Roosevelt's
message occupied attention to the ex- (
elusion of almost all other business. 1
The exception was the introduction of '
a resolution on the Japanese situation '
b.v Senator Rayner of Maryland.
Air. Rayner's resolution says: 1
"That in the opinion of the seuiite J
llie government has no right to enter ^
into any controversy with any foreign s
government relating in any manner to 1
any of the public school systems of P
any of the states of the T'nion: and, ?
t'urtbef, t r
"That It is the duty of the president
of the putted States to notify the gov- =
eminent of Japan and to notify any
foreign government with which this
11 lies t Hiu may arise that the public
school institutions of the states are not
within the jurisdiction of the United
Stales and that the T lilted States has
no power to regulate or supervise their ^
administration."

islatlve committee decided yesterdaj
lo call Governor Stokes and his liv
ing predecessors to testify in the ri
Parian investigation, released the bat;
that has prevented the riparian com
mission from granting leases durinj
the investigation, and arranged s
hearing at Toms River, December 15
ofr the South Jersey oystermen whe
charge that a "trust" is endeavoring
to gobble oyster beds by means ol
riparian grants.
Senator Minturn and Assemblymen
Barber and Crotvther are a sub-com
mittee to hear the oystermen. The
riparian commissioners deny the
"gobbling" allegations.
The governors are excused front
testifying because they are merely
riparian commissioners ex-offlcio and
have 110 real knowledge of riparian
business.
The lifting of the riparian ban is
expected to result in the granting by
the commission of the right to the
Atlantic City and Ocean City rail
