President Arthur is one of the 130,000
members of the »'Ancient Order of Unitec
Workmen." He belongs to a New York
City lodge, and is in full and regular
standing.
After all the fever of doubt in which
which newspaper correspondents and edi
tors have endeavored to keep the public
over the result of the speakership election
Carlisle seems to have won so easily that
his success must have been a foregone
conclusion. Carlisle is a pronouncec
revenue reformer, and before being made
speaker said that in case of his success he
should so use his position that in future
the democratic party should go before the
people upon an aggressive and definite
platform, and that in forming committees
he should aim to appoint men of peculiar
fitness to deal with the various subjects of
legislation that are to engross the attention
of congress.
The account of mineral discoveries on
Stillwater creek contained in our corm
pondence from Big Timber will be read
with interest. We remember not many
months ago to have been told by one who
had been over the ground that the liveli
est town in the Yellowstone valley was yet
to l>e started and that such a town was to
be supported by mineral deposits in the
Stillwater district. While we expressed
a pardonable doubt about the prospective
town, we were impressed by the report of
the mines in the locality named because
we had confidence in the relator. But
they are a part of the Crow reservation,
and until that portion of it is thrown open
to public settlement will remain unpro
ductive. But all these discoveries, unim
proved though they may be for the pres
ent, go to prove that mining in eastern
Montana has only begun, and upon the
smallest scale compared with the record
to be made in years to come.
