Mr Disraeli's Laudation of Social Ilion
Lira in Enoland is very curious, though his
reference to other countries is not quite exact.
In his versatile speech at the University ban
quet at Glasgow, on the occasion of his instal
lation as Lord Rector, he told a little story
relative to the attendance of a distinguished
diplomat at one of Lady Palmerston's parties
while this diplomat was notou speaking terms
with Lord Palmerston. The diplomatist him
self expressed surprise or admiration at the
fact, aud said, "what a wonderful system of
society you have in England." Now, while
this might have served Mr. Disraeli for an
illustration of his remarks and to flatter
British pride, we do not think political differ
ences on the Continent of Europe separate peo
ple in social life generally, and in America
they never do unless there be some other and
greater cauBe for hostile fueling. Gentlemen
in public lifo and their fam'iics mingle to
gether socially in Washington, irrespective of
party or political differences. Mr. Disraeli is
rather disposed to assume a good dea* when
be wauts to make a point or to tickle Ilntish
yiBitaL
Ireland nod tike Irlah Hwest 1 on? Wlint
la (h? Situation t
Many of our readers have seen with unusual
interest the correspondence which the IIxkalo
has published daring the last few days from
Ireland. It is difficult to enter upon a sub
ject of this kind in a city like ours, which we
believe is entitled to the rank of being the
first Irish city In the world, and where any
question concerning the happiness or the
politics of Ireland is sure to be considered
with passion and prejudice and from its bear
ing upon our own local and social affairs.
There is no problem that enters more into
a large portion of New York society than the
Irish question. There is none which is so
frequently discussed, about whioh there are
so many opinions, and upon which we receive
so much conflicting information. In all Irish
questions our people are not judges, or critics,
but partisans. A citizen of New York whose
recollections go back to the days he spent in
Connaught or Kerry, or who came here from
Belfast or Londonderry as an industrious
emigrant, with canny Scotoh ways and opin
ions, is certain to look upon any Irish subject
with the traditions that come from his youth.
Ireland is his home probably in a higher
sense even, because absence gives home asso
ciations a tenderness that increases with exile,
and when we consider that there ore proba
bly no two men "upon the face of the
univeree who would have opinions more
opposite on the same question than an
Irishman from Connaught aud his fellow
countryman from Derry, we can understand
the difficulty which any journalist must have
in endeavoring to present an impartial view
ol the politics aud agitations of that unhappy
country.
In following the reports of our correspond
ent, who was sent into Ireland some time
ago, with instructions to investigate tfiis ques
tion and give us the fullest aud most impar
tial information, we observe that, no matter
what the cry of the hour may be, the "Irish
question" to-day is substantially what it has
been since the time of the English occupation.
Whether the agitation is a movement for re
peal, the rebellion ot Eimnett or Catholio
emancipation, Feniauism or home rule, we
notice that it is the same revolution, with a
new life, new names and new leaders.
The Irishman who would have gladly wel
comed the French in the time of the Republio
and Directory is the samo man as the
O'Connell who addresssd the monster
meetings for repeal, as those of our
own time who would gladly invade
Canada or burn a prison in London.
They go by various roads to the same pur
pose?the purpose of independent national ex
istence, separation from Great Britain. It is a
singular phase of this agitation that time has
not weakened it; that no concessions on the
part of the English government have dimmed
its intensity; that whereas the leaders of the
Irish party have compelled the Catholic eman
cipation, the disestablishment of the Irish
Church, the passage of the Ecclesiastical Tithe
act, and other measures, some of which almost
imperilled the administration of Mr. C? lot Intone
by the distaste excited in the minds of English
men, and that while the political result of this
agitation has been to compel from the govern
ment of England ono concession after another,
Ireland is to-day as dissatisfied and restive in
her allegiance as she was when Cromwell was
invading her soil, or when General Hoche and
his French expedition were hovering rouud
her coasts.
This may come from many reasons that oar
correspondent has not as yet presented to us.
The great difficulty in the way of any settle
ment of the Irish question is the strong
religious animosity that pervades the people.
In one part we have a population industri
ous, resolute, thrifty and spirited, who
have no memory more sacred than that of
Londonderry and William Prince of Orange,
and who feel it a duty to drink perdition and
shame to Irishmen who believe in the Roman
power. In another part there is a population,
chivalrous, high spirited, with a genius for
poetry and war, who look upon Cromwell and
the Prince of Orange as the enemies of the
human race; who long for the time when
Drogheda and Derry will be avenged, and
who cling to the Roman power with a stead
fastness that is seen in no other Catholic
people of the globe. So, between the Orange
and the Green, there is a civil war raging that
time and statesmanship have nover appeased.
The thought has often occurred to us that if
there were to be a separation between Eng
land and Ireland?if the English government
were to concede all that is demanded by Mr.
Butt, Mr. Sullivan and thoir friends?the
Orange and the Green could not exist in Ire
land without instant and atrocious civil war.
We attribute this animosity to that ignorance
which, in other countries and at other times,
has given rise to similar animosities. For
centuries the bitterness between the English
and the French, as seen in the old novels, the
comedies of the eighteenth century, the cari
catures about the times of Napoleon, the
books, pamphlets and broadsides published
during the reign of George the Third, was as
fierce and unwise as these dissensions in Ire
land. Even in the oliservatious of a philosopher
like Johnson, as keen an observer as Smollett,
or the pictures of a master kind, severe,
genial, like Hogarth, we note a deprecating
and vindictive tone towards the French,
which went far towards educating the minds
of Englishmen to many generations of latter
and unnecessary war, which loaded Franca
and England with stupendous burdens of debt,
j and which is only beginning to die away
I under the influence of education and inter
I change of thought. Even as the French ami
English have como to understand each other,
to know what is good and bad in each, and to
have alliances of commerce and literature and
trade, so we may hope that, whether Ireland
; should become an independent Power or not,^
the same influence of education permeating
her people will take away the animosities
which so long have burned under the Orange
and the Green, and make her sons as united
in feeling and patriotism as the people of
Germany or France or America.
Mr. Sullivan, whose viewB are presented by
our correspondent?a gentleman well known
! in America as a leader among bis fellows ?
seems to Chlnl that the Irish question will be
j settled by the organization of Ireland upon
| our federal American system, anrl that he and
his friends will be satisfied with an inde
pendent autonomy such as New York ikwhcssos
I in its relations to the United Htates. We are
1 not &um?i*ed at this feeling, which is giumlv
an expression of the communistic federal
feeling which we observed iu France dar
ing the Comniane reign, which animates
the leaden of the Spanish revolution,
and seems to be a panaoea in the minds of the
advanced thinkers in Europe for many of the
evils in the older oountries. There are many
things to be said in favor of the federal sys
tem, We think it would be wise for Spain to
adopt it, for in Spain there are distinct nation
alities and divisions of parties, language and
tradition, which make it easy tor the realm to
subdivide itself into cantons. If the leaders
of the Irish movement wish to make their
country a part of the English Empire, as New
York is a part of our Republic, it will be
necessary for them to go still further, and, in
stead of making Ireland one State, subdivide
it into four or five States or provinces. We
can understand how a subdivision based, let
us say, upon the old provincial distinctions of
Ulster, Leinster, Con naught and Mnustor
might give tho English Empire four independ
ent and powerful States, inhabited by people
different iu religion, tradition and custom, and
tending, we hope, to extinguish tho Animosities
which have retarded the prosperity and happi
ness of this beautiful lan4,'
The Public Prrj* on the President's
Message.
New York .Sun (independent):?"A weak
effusion for a President." "A rambling, dis
jointed affair." New York World (demo
crat):?"Clumsily written documeut." New
York Thnes (administrfttion):?"It would be
easy to wTite a more striking messnge." New
York lYibune (opposition):?"His notions
(about fiuauce) are not such as will com
mend themselves to the judgment of Congress
or the good sense of the people." New York
Evening Post (republican):?"Though much
mixed in character, is to be generally com
mended for its tone and the propriety of
many of its recommendations." Now York
Commercial (republican):?"Is a practical
document, but more or less mangled by the
telegraph." Philadelphia Ledger (independ
ent):?"His usual plain, concise and straight
forward style." Philadelphia Record (inde
pendent):?"Will amply repay a careful
perusalr' Philadelphia Press (republican) : ?
"Sensible and satisfactory." Boston Adver
tiser (republican), after recapitulating the
chief points ot the Message:?"These are all
practical questions, upon the decision of
which the President's decided and frankly ex
pressed opinion will have the weight it is en
titled to." Boston Post (opposition): ?
"There is nothing in messages of this stamp
that tend to exhaust their author's powers
to the extent of necessitating recreation
trom the very day on which Congress ad
journs." Providence Journal (administra
tion) :?"It would be idle to disguise the diffi
culties in the way of a sound solution of some
of the more fundamental questions ; but if
Congressmen are as apt to learn as the
people and endorse in act the sound
propositions of the President as to ilnance
as heartily as the country does in'
feeliug, we shall have great occasion to
congratulate the nation upon the present ses
sion of Congress.'' Baltimore American
(administration): ? ' 'We cannot see that there
is anything new or striking in the Message
concerning a resumption of specie payments."
"There is no telling whether the 'elasticity'
plan will work until it is tried." "On the
whole it is an excellent document." Albany
Argus (democratic): ? "A stale recapitulation
| of the events of a dying year." "Not a word
is said of the salary grab, nor a recommenda
tion made with regard to the imbecile course
of the Attorney General (now Chief Justice),
in his conduct of the Credit Mobilier suite."
"Evidently the President is still confident of
his ability to delude or defy public senti
ment" Worcester Spy (republican):?If not
a great statesman, Grant "is at least a saga
cious, candid and inflexibly upright man." |
Boston Journal (republican):?"It may not
be a document of great literary finish, but it
grasps its subjects welL" Ilarlford Courant
(republican):?"While open to severe criti
cism in some parte it is in the main excel
lent." The (Jovrant thinks the financial ques
tion "not thoroughly comprehended by the
Chief Executive."
And so on are the gist of the comments of
the press so far as thoy have been received.
The stench republican or administration
organs regard the Message as a model docu
ment of the kind ; the liberal republicans
hesitate to express a decided opinion, but
wherever they do it is adversely to the spirit
and recommendations ot the President; while
the democratic and thoroughly opposition
press denounce it upon its intrinsic merits as
a state paper.
The Pope anil (he Kalnrr.
We have a report from Home this morning
that the Holy Father is sick. It is also an
nounced that the Emperor William is seriously
indisposed. The Pope and the Kaiser?how
long the names have been associated ! It is
now well nigh two thousand years since Leo
III. placed on tho head of Charlemagne a
precious crown, hailed him Emperor of the I
Romans, and so established the Holy Roman
Empire, which lasted until 1800, when the
Emperor Francis IL of Austria abdicated ?
tho imperial crown and brought to an end
an empire and an arrangement which,
through many vicissitudes, had endured from
the Christmas day of the ninth century.
It was the dream of the I'apucy
that the Empire would yet be re
vived, and that the Empire and tho
Church would yet be one as in the days of the
golden past. It was the dream of G nuauy,
on tho other hand, that tho red-bearded
Frederic would yet arise and that the Father
land would he one. The latter dream has
almost been realized. Under Emperor William
Germany has become all but a unit; but tbe
hopes of tho Church have not been fulfilled.
New men may bring about new conditions;
and it is not impossible that under a new Pope
and a now Emperor the present antagonisms
will pass awny, and that something like the oh I
Holy Roman Empire may be revived. What
lies iu the womb of the future we know not.
But tho possible enrly passing away of the two
most prominent rulers in Europe is not with
out deep and suggestive importance.

To Whom Should the United Stntea
Surrender ?-Tk, Real Rulers of
Cuba.
Five yearn ago the Cuban revolutionists in
the district ol Yam, numbering some one hun
dred and fifty men, rose against Spanish rule
in the island. Before many days had passed
the small band had received such liberal
additions that the insurrectionists were
counted by thousands. From tw time to
the present moment the power of the Spanish
government, whatever form that government
way have taken, has boou unable to sup- !
press the rebellion. Monarchy, dictatorship,
provisional government, imported king, re
public, each in turn has held authority at
Madrid, and under each the condition of Cuba
has remained unchained. The rouson of this
is that a second rebellion followed that of
1808, a rebellion "which has Jong held power at
Havana and/ruled the rulers of the island.
There is a. triple authority in Cuba?the shift
ing head at Madrid, the insurrection of
tbe^ Casino Espafiol and the insurrection
of. the bush. The power of the home govern
ment is inoroly nominal; it must bo oxoroiscd
in accordance with the wishes of the Casino
Lspailol and its tools, the volunteers, or it
cannot be enforced. The Casino did uot like
General Dulco as Captain Goneral, and so it
drove him back to Spain. The Casino did
not like the action of the council of war which
acquitted the boy students of the Havana Uni
versity ol the alleged offence of injuring tombs
in the cemetery, and so itsent the volunteers to
clamor for their lives and to murder eight of
the children in dofiance of the law. The
iwpoteucy of the Madrid government has
been acknowledged in the debates in the
Spanish Legislature. On the 14th of October,
1872, Sefior Diaz Quintero, in a speech .in the
Spanish Senate, said, in relation to the ex
pulsion of tho Captain General, "If there had
been any senso of docorum in the gov
ernment General Dulce would have returned
with a squadron at his back to force
him upon these robols, for in plain truth the
real Cuban rebels are tho slave volunteers of
Havana." A few days later Sefior Benot, an
j other Senator, said, "Spain does not govern
in Cuba. Authorities in Havana have
ceased to exist Cuba is groaning under
the scourge of arbitrary power; there is no
law, no code, no constitution; the principles
01 law are trampled in the dust,
and the ancient laws are disregarded.
Childreu are immolated, judgment is
I passed on tho dead, the innocent
I suffer for the guilty, human ears are fried and
I eaten, tho only power is brute force, tho vile
J greed of bad officials and the infamy of
pirates and slavers." In the Spanish House
| of Representatives, only one year ago, Sefior
| rayelasaid:?"The government is asking us
I tor soldiers to send to Cuba as if it really
\ commanded in the island. I can tell you,
gentlemen, that tho power that commands in
Cuba now are the volunteers ot Havana;
and they command there because, for soma
reason which I do not know, they fear for
their lives and fortunes, and they believe i
better to think and act for themselves in the
matter of Cuba. The proof of this is that w*
send them generals and they send them back
to us agaiu. The volunteers of Cuba hold
councils of war of their own accord."
These plain words, spoken by Spaniards
themselves in their national Legislature
only a year ago, prove that the gov
erment at Madrid was then power
less in Cuba. It is as powerless
now. The little swashbuckler, Burriel, who
openly defied the orders of his superiors in
the murders at Santiago de Cuba, is feted and
lauded as he parades through the island, ex
hibiting himself as the hero whose first
bloody victory over the onomies of his country
was won over Ihe bound victims of the San
tiago slaughter house. The terms of settle
ment agreed upon by Secretary Fish, dis
honorable as they are to tho United
States, are repudiated by the Casino
Espafiol, notwithstanding the rose-colored
official reports from Havana, and the volun
teers will, in all probability, prevent the ful
filment of the conditions. The "pirates and
slavers" of the Casino Espafiol and the revolu
tionists of the bush divide the authority in
Cuba between them, and both are in rebellion
against tho government at Madrid. How al>
surd, thou, for tho United States to treat with
Castelar for a settlement he is powerless
to make ! How degrading to volunteer a
sacrifice of our national honor, when our
humiliation only draws down upon us fresh
insult and outrage! IIow idle to patch up a
dtsagraccful paper truce, in four and trembling
lest its compromises should be scattered to the
winds before they are carried out, and in the
certainty that tho atrocious acts thus insuffi
ciently atoned will be repeated by the offend
ers on tbo next opportunity!
If Secretary Fish is so eager to surrender
our national honor he should troat, not with
Seftor Castelar, hut with tho head of the Casino
Espafiol; not with Madrid, but with Havana.
The high flown compliments ho now showers
upon Admiral Polo should be paid to the
butcher of Santiago, the truculent Burriel. He
should laud the valor of tho bloodstained volun
teers and ring in their ears his contempt for tho
Cuban revolutionists. It is from tho casinos
ho should solicit tho return of the Vir
ginias and tho prisoners who have not yet
been slaughtered; it is from the casinos
ho should seek for information as to the char
acter of an American vessel; it is to tho
casinos he should pledge tho United States
government to punish those who may bo
shown by Spanish proof to have violated our
own laws; the casinos should give him to
"understand" that Burriel and his fellow
assassins are to be tried under Spanish laws
for murders authorized by Spanish laws; it
is with the casinos he should arrange for the
consideration of tho question of "reciprocal
reclamations'' at some luture day. If he did
this he mignt successfully carry to a consum
mation his disgraceful surrender of the honor
of tho American Republic to the demands of
the "pirates and slavers" who rule in Havana.
As it is, while he displays his willingness to
submit to national humiliation, he is in danger
Of having his terms thrown back iu his teeth
by the lawless ruffians in whose interest they
are offered.
Gbriun Naval Doticultt with Spain.-?
The Gorman government is preparing to no*
i tiiy, or avenge, an action which was com
| mi tied just lately by the Spanish naval au
I tborities against the commercial flag of the
i Empire. Two Prussian trad urn va**els the
Maria Louisa and Gazelle, were seized by a
Spanish man-of-war in the waters ot the
Sooloo Archipelago. The commanders and
crews were held in peril of their lives for an
allowed infringement of a blockade said to
be maintained by the Spaniards off the 1 hi
lippine Islands. British and Prussian subjects,
serving on the German traders, are still held
in oaptivity, although they assert that there
was no declaration of a Spauish blockade.
The imperial government in Berlin has taken
the matter in hand. The powerful frigate
Kronprinz and the corvette Augusta have boen
ordered to be made ready to sail for the
Sooloo at a moment's notice. The fiery Dons
are getting themselves into hot water all round.
Exploration in North America aa
Prosecuted bf the United States
Government.
President Grant states no more salient faot
in his Message than that twenty-five thousand
miles of railway have been built iu the last
four yoars. The locomotive is the mercury in
the glass tube ; the advancement of the rail
marks the approaoh of the Union to a health
ful political and commercial temperature.
Whou we consider that those four years and
four years almost immediately following an
exhausting war?have been signalized by the
construction of more than one-third of all the
railways on the Continent?for the sum total
is less than seventy-five thousand miles?one
of the principal causes of the rocentpanie
comes to the surface. We liavo boon building
railways too fast. We have shown incon
j siderate haste. Yet they are a fact, and the
fact is not displeasing^ t^ftt, iji Jth? lorty-two
years that railways have been an insti
tution in the Western Hemisphere, we
have in fourteen years achieved the
progress previously accomplished during
the lifetime of one administration. When the
dark cloud of our latp fiuancial disaster
first descended on the country we were told
that all grand enterprises must cease?that wc
should turn around and put our backs against
"Westward the course of empire takes its
way," and concentrate our industrial and
commercial forces for a grand unuistioo.
Wo believe that President Grant touched the
truth when he declared that the recent crisis
was a "blessing in disguise;" and, further
j more, the evidences are about us that what wo
i took for a fierce storm has expended its lorce
in an empty squall. There is no reason, then,
why we should abandon the developments
of the Continent ao vividly portrayed in the
brief paragraph of the Executive Message.
I "During the same period (four years) * * *
the population of the oountry has largely in
creased; more than twenty-five thousand
miles of railway have been built, requiring
the active use of capital to operate them.
Millions of acres of laud have been opened to
cultivation, requiring capital to move the prod
ucts. Manufactories have multiplied beyond
all precedent in the same period of time."
To what, we may inquire, has all
this advancement been due? The
answer is simple. Among the tew
objects long successfully carried out, and
j which have distinguished our government
above all others, has been the employment of
the army in exploring our unknown Western
country, in delineating its topography, in
surveying for the laying out of geological
maps, in using tho navy for the exploration
of the bed of the ocean and the accurate
cartography of our harbor and coast lines;
and no less need we add tho invaluable ser
vices performed by the army in exploring tho
air?in determining air currents for our daily
use at our breakfast tables. We do not be
lieve in Fourth of July rhetoric; but when wo
remember that England has not a respectable
map of her own little island wo can look to
these labors with pride. Exploration, thon,
is the avant courrier of the rail and telegraph,
of tho harbor and marine station, and, there
fore, of civilization in its highest type. Wo
no longer find it necessary to rely upon
the citizen traveller starting out with a
dictionary of the Indian dialects, a
belt of gold around his waist and
a generous supply of fire water in his
kit, for our knowlodgo of tho Western
wilds. That day has gono by, thanks to tho
departments and Congress. Expeditions aro
now equipped in scientific style, with all the
latest instruments used by savans acquainted,
not alone with their use, but with "roughing
it" in the field. The close of the year 1873
finds the ablest body of explorers our country
has ever known gathered at Washington,
busily Qngaged in condensing their observa
tions and elaborating their notes for the eluci
dation of tho physical googrnphy of tho West
ern States and Territories. We do not propose
now to notico especially tho resultd accom
plished, but simply to bring to the notico of
Congress and tho peoplo tho fact that, whilo
we are living among Cuban agitations, finan
cial disasters and sad episodes like that of tho
Villo du Havre, a silent corps is doiug work,
tho value of which will not bo vitiated cen
turies hence.

lie will laugh outright, no doubt, when bo
seos that the President actually referred in
his Message to Congress to this precious
document No ono has heard of a war or con
templated war by Hayti on St. Domingo. It
is a sheer bugbeur. As to the farce of a civil
war by Cahral, Luperon or any othor Domini

to as much as a street fight in New York,

All this suppliant trash, which Genesal Grant
wok foolish luiontrh to mention ;u his Mnasa^e

some valuo to the stock and to put money
into the pocket of Baca, There is no evidence
that Iluyti intends to make war on 8t. Do

it concern the United States ? Of the two
Republics the Haytiun is the most respocUhln

The Protestant Episcopal Secessionists.
It has long been known that there was great
discontent in the Episcopal Church, aud col
lision has been not infrequent between the
bishops aud incumbents of particular charges;
but it was scarcely expected that matters would
be pushed so far by the ecclesiastical authorities
as to necessitate secession, or that the disaf
fected woro so spirited and plucky as to take
the tlual step which wits necessary to organize
a new and independent Church. The troubles
in Jersey a few years ago; the unjust aud cruel
persecution of Dr. Tyug, Jr., which grew out
of the Jersey troubles; and, lator, the Chicago
aifair, in which the Rev. Dr. Cheney and As
sistant Bishop Cummins acquired notoriety?
the Bishop particularly suffering persecution?
these things have at last brought forth fruit,
and that fruit is now before us in the shape of
a now Church organization, which has begun
under auspices by no means unfavorable, and
has before it, to all appearance, a future the
very reverse of unpromising.
On Monday all those doubts were not at rest
by tho meeting which was held in the rooms
of tho Young Men's Institution. This meet
ing, it will be seen, though not largo, watt
highly respectable. Tho new Church, it was
agreed, should be called "The Reformed Epis
copal Church." Tho clergy were fairly repre
sented, considering the circumstances, and
tho laymen who were presont and took part
in tho proceedings were of tho right sort. The
work was gone through in an orderly and
business-like manner, and it is quite evident
that Bishop Cummins is a man who knows
what ho is about. The now Church is to be
based on tho Prayer Book of 1785, which, ac
cording to the Bishop, is the "most ooceptahle
Prayer Book yet prepared, and the one most
in conformity with Scripture." This Prayer
Book, however, is not regarded as perfect; and
the right is roservod to amend, alter, enlarge
or ubridge tho book, as "the Lord may guide
by His Iloly Spirit." The Declaration of
Principles, drawn up by Bishop Cummins and
approved by a committee appointed by the
meotiug, if looked at from the standpoint of
what is called Evangelical Protestantism,
will bo generally pronounced satisfactory. If
looked at from the standpoint of Catholicism
or Ritualism it will be generally condemned.
As against what is called Romanism and Rit
ualism the line is drawn clean and sharp. The
new Church is a thoroughly Protestant Church.
It is moro Protestant than tho Church of
Luther, more Protestant than the Church of
Ilonry Vfll. and Elizabeth. Bating Episco
pacy it comes very near to tho Presbyterian
standard. For the prosent Bishop Cummins
is sole Bishop of the organization. It was the
opinion of the Bishop that he was not equal
to tho task. He had received letters within a
few hours from Baptist, Mothodist and Pres
byterian clergymen, ollbring to join the move
ment; and he thought that a bishop should be
appointed to tako charge of the Northwest. A
strong otfort was made to have Mr. Cheney, of
Chicago, appointed to this office; but he de
clined until he could have au opportunity of
consulting with his congregation. As we have
said already, the new Church has a fair pros
pect of success. What effect it may havo in
begetting reform inside of the Episcopal
Church remains to be soon. It is already, we
notice, creating alarm among the Episcopal
leaders. It will now be necessary for ineu
like Dr. Tyng to define their position.
Spanish Inhumanity in the Patriot
War in Cuba.
While America is watching her government
making a shamefaced settlement on paper of
the bloody Virginius outrage the Cuban pa
triots in the fiold are taking vengeance for the
murdered by redoubling the vigor of their
attacks on the Spaniards, even in tho fortified
towns on the coast. The success attending
these movements is highly encouraging to tho
friends of free Cuba. The Heiiald corre
spondeuce from Manzanillo, published on
Tuesday last, faithfully describes tho opera
tions of the patriots in the Eastern Depart
ment To General Vicente Garcia the credit
must be given of obtaining astonishing
results. The Spaniards seem roduced every
where to the dofonsive, and as the Cubans
fight or avoid a conflict at will the victory is
nearly always to them. Tho feature whioh
will strike every one with pleasure in these
Cuban successes is tho fact that the turning
of tho tido of battle in favor of
tho patriots finds them disposed, even
anxious, to bo merciful to the defeated?
that is, to cany on the war with humanity.
Success to the Spaniards meant a hideous
aftercourse of horrors which should bo name
less. In the desperation of tho hour the
Cubans, in self-defence, adoptod the savage
tactics of their enemies?not giving quarter,
which they never received. That tho Spaniards
have paid no attention to the overtures ol the
Cubans lor an exohango of prisoners, and
liaVo rejected contemptuously tho appeal to
carry on the war according to tho rules of
civilization, afford strong reasons for tho
nooossity of putting an end to tho war alto
gether, by driving away tho brutal people who
cannot preserve order nor attempt to sustain
their power without tho aid of atrocities which
are a stain to civilization.
Citt Tbaps fob Liri; and Limb.?Now that
frost and snow are with us ouco again it is
time that we should make another effort to
get rid of thoso dangerous traps for life and
limb, the smooth iron sidewalks and cellar
traps of tho city. Last year over forty deaths
were reported in the bills of mortality occa
sioned by tails in tho street. The larger part
of these latal accidents and others attended
by serious and sometimes permanent injury
arc due to these iron traps, which, in slippery
weather, can scarcely bo trodden on without
occasioning a fall. A resolution lies in the
Hoard of Aldermen requiring the Public
Works Department to inquire as to flic most
desirable substitute for thoso iron traps
and sidewalks. Tho resolution should be
followed by an ordinance compelling,
under heavy penalties, tho removal of
all the smooth iron trans as soon a substi
