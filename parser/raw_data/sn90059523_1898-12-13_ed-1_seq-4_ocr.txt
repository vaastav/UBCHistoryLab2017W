The Uiiitea States Merchant Marine.
Tn his annual report, published a
few days ago, Commissioner of Navi
gation Chamberlain took an advanced
position with respect to the impor
tance ar.d. indeed, the necessity of a
large increase in the merchant marine
service of the I'nited States, if this
country is to conserve the advantages
to be derived from the carrying of our
immense volume of exports, the profits
from which must otherwise be enjoyed
by foreign ship owners.
Mr. Chamberlain states three prop
ositions with respect to the tianspor
tation of exports and imports; first,
leave our laws unchanged and rely
upon vessels under foreign flags to
perform the service; second, permit
foreign-built ships to register under
our fins?; third, "extend direct govern
ment aid to vessels built in the Onited
Slates ar.d thus increase both national !
navi era tion and national ship building." ;
it is not difficult to recognize the cor- I
rect one among these three propositions.
The multiplication of ship yards means]
increased employment for labor; the in- j
vestmenl in these vessels by American
capital means large additions to the 1
national wealth; the manning of them
by American crews moans the opening j
of a new occupation for thousands of .
men who would eagerly embrace the |
lift- of a seaman.
Hitherto the cost of raw material en- j
tering Into the production of steel, cou- j
pied with the higher wages paid in the
United States than those paid abroad j
for the .same class of mechanical la
bor, has been regarded as the princi
pal cause of our inability to build ;
ships at a cost that would enable the
< wners to operate them in competition j
with foreign-built ships, on a basis of
revenue that would insure a fair re- 1
turn upon the investment. More thSiu i
this, an immense lnK_f_t£sent"is neces
rsary to DpejviJe a plant of sufficient
ty;>acily for the construction of the '
],- rger class of steel vessels, and. Un- j
less enough orders are forthcoming to ;
1; p the establishment in constant op
eiation, the work cannot profitably be j
carried forward.
But the great foundii s of the coui -
try are now turning out steel plate ,
on a b isis of profit which admits of !
exports to Glasgow, v. bile steel rails |
m mufactured in the same localities i
are being shipped 'in considerable I
quantities to Australia, in competition j
v ith Flngland. The United Stabs has
r -ached the turning point in Ihis in- I
dusliy, so far as ability to manufac
ture cheaply much that enters into the ;
construction of a ship is concerned. If j
conditions favored the widening of this ]
industry, to a degree that would insure '
a constant supply of orders to keep
piants in orperation, a plenty of capi
tal is available to invest in ship yards. •
on both the Atlantic and Pacific.
• • •
But before any advance step can be
taken our navigation laws must be
amended in many important particu- '
lars. The sailors in the service of th-; j
British marine, for instance,are subject
t i certain regulations, the enforcement j
cf which is in the hands of consular i
cud other courts, to whom cases of i
mutiny i r other misconduct can be re- j
fcrred in the confidence that the offend- '
cr will be duly and justly punished, j
These regulations and ihis guarantee
that a ship's discipline will always be
maintaii ed contribute a sense of safe
ty always essential in the service of
the seas, our navigation laws are al
together deficient in these auxiliaries,
in that an offending seaman often es
fcapes just punishment through the
political influences which may be
brought to bear upon a magistrate
when a prisoner is arraigned before
him. There are many other deficiencies
of a minor character, apparently, in the
laws, but all going to make up an im-
I • : feet code, which must be revised
before much of an impulse can be giv
en to proprietary interest in American
steamships.
But, no matter what the regulations
and. the laws governing the marine
B.rvice may be, it is well understood
that little or no progress can be made
in the improvement of our national
r '•reliant marine, unless the govern
ment shall extend to it a helping hand
in the work of development. Objection
has always existed in this democratic
country to anything in the nature of
a subsidy, but, as Commissioner Cham
berlain very aptly says: "Nations and
individuals that dissent from the gen
eral theory of government and of pri
vate enterprise concede on political
grounds an exception in favor of ship
building and navigation."
Mr. Chamberlain is himself a Demo
crat and a "holdover" from Mr.
Cleveland's administration. Perhaps
ho may have had in mind, when he
wrote the above, the "Report on the
privileges and restrictions of the com
merce of the United States," prepared
by Thomas Jefferson, while he was sec
letary of state, and bearing date Dec.
I*.. 17 rC, in which ho said:
"If particular nations grasp at undue shares
of our commerce, and more especially lf they
seize upon tiie means of the United State*
to convert them into a'iment for their own
strength and withdraw them entirely from
the support of those to whom they belong,
defensive and protective measures become
necessary on the s>art of the nation whose
marine resources are thus invaded, or it
Wia bo disarmed of Its defense; its produc
tions will be at the mercy of the nation winch
has poesessed itself exclusively of the means
of carrying them, and its policies will be
influenced by those who command its com
merce. If we lose the seamen and artisans
whom it now employs, we lose the present
if marine defense, and time will be req
to raise up others, when disgrace
and losses shall bring home to our feelings
the disgrace of haVing abandoned them."
The above is especially interesting in
the light of our recent naval conflict
with Spain. But it is equally interest
ing as an argument why government
may properly and, in a season of emer
gency, as in the present, extend sup
port to the service of the merchant ma
rine.
• * *
Today the ocean carrying trade of the
Pacific is almost paralyzed because of
an insufficiency of ships to transport
the products of the United States to
Asiatic ports, the demand for which is
increasing so enormously that the Pa
cific coast is likely soon to outrank that
of the Atlantic in its volume of ex
ports.
"It will require," says Commissioner
Chamberlain, "at least eighteen months
to build vessels of over 5,000 tons and
sixteen knots, needed to meet new con
ditions in the Pacific. Meanwhile, a
combination of four large German lines,
aided by the reichstag, is hastening
to completion steamships to carry out
Cerman imperial policy in Asia.
"A relaxation of the registry law
was necessary to establish our trans-
Atlantic line, and a similar relaxation
is now necessary to meet conditions on
the Pacific. It is proposed that foreign
built vessels be admitted to American
register on condition that equivalent
tonnage be built in the United States,
as was done in the case of the Paris,
.New York, St. Louis and St. Paul. By
a similar policy Germany has built up
within fourteen years its great ship
yards. From ISSS to 1891 the North
German Lloyd spent $7,500,000 in Ger
man and $2,000,000 in British yards,
while from 1891 to 1597 it spent $16,000,
--000 in German yards and only $1,500,000
in British yards."
This is well for a beginning; but on
general principles Americans would
better enjoy the construction of their
own ships rather than place the flag
over those built elsewhere. But the
commissioner goes still further by say
ing:
"Toward steamship lines to the east coast
of Asia alone. Great Britain last year eon-
I $1,250.0„0, France $1,217,000, Germany
J4BOOCO, Spain (_897) fll-.CO'J. Russia $405,000,
Austria $-06,000, Italy $277,000. The United
SI :ites raid only $40,000 to American Haas ro
Afcia at regular mail rates. We have deluded
ours-.ves into the belief that the Pacific
trace wil' become ours without taking ordi
nary precautions to meeJt competition."
* * i
There is no doubt that lack of gen
eral appreciation of this Important
subject is largely due to lack of knowl
edge hitherto upon the developments
which have been going on in the direc
tion' of the Asiatic trade during the
past two or three years. Meanwhile,
President McKinley, in his annual
message, called the attention of con
gress to this expanding trade and de
clared that it would be his aim to sub
serve our large interests in that quar
ter by all means appropriate to the
constant policy of our government.
Perhaps the most feasible plan in the
way of extending aid is that recom
mended by James J. Hill, of this city,
namely, the bestowal by the govern
ment of a bounty, say of $2 per ton,
on all goods exported in American bot
toms for a period of ten years. Mr.
Hill illustrated this point in an inter
view published in The Globe Aug. 25
last, in which he said: "Suppose \ V q
send out 1,500.000 tons a »••_!»_•. That
would be a ship carrying 5,000 tons ev
ery. _>a__Sess day; and yet it would cost
the government only $3,000,000 annual
ly. And think of the value of the car
goes and the amount that would come
back to us from such an export trade."
There is perhaps no other subject
which could more profitably enlist the
interest of the commercial bodies of
St. Paul and Minneapolis than agita
tion of this general question involving
the improvement of the merchant ma
line on the Pacific. The development
of this growing Asiatic trade means
much for the Northwest, to which the
Twin Cities compose the gateway.
Battleships and New York Harbor.
The battleship Massachusetts left
the Brooklyn navy yard last Saturday
bound for Hampton Roads. While still
in New York harbor and in the vicinity j
of Governor's island, the vessel struck ;
some obstruction, smashing in three of j
her compartments and settling ten
inches and more before reaching the
navy yard, to which she immediately
returned.
The remarkable part of it all is the
pilot states that the ship started out
at low tide, and that, owing to the
heavy winds which have recently pre
vailed in the harbor, the water was
four feet lower than is usual even at
ebb tide.
In the light of these two important
admissions it would seem tbat some |
official high in command must be cul- j
pably responsible. There ought not to |
have been any attempt made to navi- j
gate at low tide an ironclad of the di- j
mensions of the Massachusetts, with i
j its twenty-six feet two inches of \
j draught, in a channel whose greatest
1 depth is only a little more than thirty '-,
! feet, to say nothing of the increased
j shallowness by reason of the winds j
! referred to by the pilot.
Naval vessels appear to have a \
! rather hard time of it in New York '
! harbor at the best. The channel by
• which they are obliged to make- their j
I way to and from the bay and the navy j
I yard is too shallow for vessels of such j
great weight, unwieldy bulk and ex- j
treme draught. Both the Montgomery j
and the Mayflower have within the ]
past two years met with accidents in
this same locality. Diamond reef, a
well recognized object of obstruction,
exists there, and at low tide, under the
most favorable conditions, lt is cov
ered by only twenty-six feet of water.
Why this,reef has not been removed
and the entire channel deepened by the
government is inexplicable. While
millions of dollars are annually thrown
away in tinkering with the Mississippi
river, the great harbor of New York,
with its approaches to the Brooklyn
navy yard, has been practically neg
lected, and one after another of the
great warships is permitted tn be
shattered and torn and structurally
weakened in that degree by frequent
groundings in their passage in and
out.
It would seem to be time for the
committee on rivers and harbors to
take this sublect up and treat it with
the promptness and liberality to which.
THE ST. PAUL GLOBK TUESDAY -DECEMBER 13, 1893.
by reason of its importance, it is en
titled.
Safe of the Philippines,
Before the treaty of peace at Paris
was signed and as if to prepare the
palate of the American public for the
dose which it carries with lt in the
matter of the absorption of the Phil
ippines, an announcement was made by
a New York newspaper that President
McKinley was in favor of their sale. If
the president was In favor, in the mid
dle or at the close of last we€k, of the
purchase of the Philippines for $20,000,
--000 and their sale for $200,000,000, why
could he not have communicated the
fact to the American people by means
of his annual message to congress last
Monday, rather than pursue the more
indirect and less proper course of con
fiding the fact, as is alleged, to a sen
ator who is himself in favor of such
disposition of the islands?
This story resembles in its charac
teristics and ear marks some of the
war bulletins which adorned lower
Fourth st-eet, St. Paul, ltst spring and
which generally started out with the
words, "It is rumored," etc.
It is not at all probable that Presi
dent McKinley knows just what he is
in favor of. He has not taken the
initiative in suggestion on any point
whatever, except in the matter of the
tariff, since he entered upon the "try
ing" duties of his offlce. As the Louis
ville Courier-Journal aptly says, "He
is a follower and not a leader."
A skillful caricaturist of an Eastern
newspaper very truthfully represented
Mr. McKinley's peculiar shrewdness in
the line of shifting responsibility in a
sketch which has appeared since the de
livery of the message last Monday. The
artist portrays a huge white elephant
labeled "Philippines," with a ring
around one of his forefeet, to which is
attached a chain forming the word
"message," the other end of which is
fastened snugly upon the knob of the
door of congress. Mr. McKinley is him
self represented as passing hurriedly
down the steps, wiping the big drops
of perspiration from his brow, while
the elephant is looking after him with
a pathetic expression of sense of un
fair abandonment in his eyes.
Unquestionably the Philippines have
been in the nature of a white elephant
upon the hands of the president. It
is now the duty of the people to see to
it that this burden shall not be trans
ferred to them. It is not within the
limits of probability that, once these
islands come into the possession of the
United States, they will be disposed of,
either in whole or in part, to any other
power or powers. They will continue
to be an incubus upon the nation and
meanwhile prove an excellent lever
with which to secure an increase of
the standing army, as well as legisla
tion for all sorts of speculative jobs,
to the promotion of which schemers are
already industriously applying them
selves.
No, there is no danger that Mr. Mc-
Kinley is buying the Philippines to
sell again at a profit. The bargain
counter day in this connection may be
regarded as indefinitely postponed.

| IN WOMAN'S REALM.
The Globe wishes to impress upon the
women of the Northwest that while it strives
to make all its columns meet the wants of
both men and women in the line of news
a<n<J information this particular column ls
devoted exclusively to the interests of women.
These are days when not only club women
and women in public life are doing some se
rious thinking, but when the thoroughly do
mestic woman looks from her home upon the
trend of social, industrial ann educational
affairs with an increasing thoughtfutaess and
growing convictions. The world has seen no
reform whose origin cannot be traced to
•scattered expressions of individual opinion.
It is such opinions which The Globe alms
to make effective by securing them fair and
serious expression. Signatures will be with
held from print if tt is so requested, but
we want the views as well as the news of
what is being done and what ought to and
can be done by club women and non-clu*b
women to improve the condition of the home,
the school and the industrial life.
We should especially urge that where wom
en, whether members of clubs or not, have
tried any experiment in connection with their
particular line of work they would describe
the results for this column, as nothing ls
so instructive, encouraging and inspiring as
example. Comparisons are always helpful,
and we are therefore anxious that clubs

THE SWEATSHOP SYSTEM.
What a St. Paul Woman Ha* to* Say
of the Sweating: llumucnh.
To The St. Paul Globe:
I am not a club woman, but there ls one
branch of work carried on by the National
Federation of Women's Clubs which I think
should have the support of every honest
woman, and that is tho work of the indus
trial committee. In the name of health,
purity and humanity we should flght the
"sweating system."
When I buy my boy a suit of clothes at a
price which my common sense tells me can
cover littlo more than the cost of the ma
terial I must shut my eyes to three things,
viz.: That it was made in an overcrowded
tenement house, or sweatshop, from whose
foul air and other unsanitary conditions It
has inevitably gathered disease germs; that
it was made by women who have to work
from 3 o'clock in the morning till 11 o'clock
at night to keep soul and body together; and
that such purchase has given one more en
couragement to a sysrem which makes child
labor necessary, and drives women and chil
dren with the lash of desperation to crime
and degradation. Is this a matter for club
women only to consider? For shame! Keep the
nickels, dimes and quarters which you put
into the church collections, and then when
you go to the store ask for union labeled
goods, even if you have to pay more for
them. —Cluhlesa.
South St. Paul, Dec. 12.
Club Corner.
Apropos of the views of "Clubless" on th*
sweating system, the Political Study Club of
New York city is devoting much time to
the problem. At the last meeting Miss Kerp
er, a member, made a vigorous attack on the
custom. Quoting Henry White, secretary of
the United States garmentmakers. she said:
"Sweating is more prevalent in tlie clothing
trade than any other, counting as olothing
everything personally worn from hats to
shoes. It is among these peop'e thait the con
ditions of living are so low. Clannish groups
of foreigners get together; ono gets more
capital. He starts a shop, brings in his
neighbors, and we hear that anoth-er shop is
started in the liast side. The goods are
made here in the midst of most unsanitary
surroundings. But thay don't stay there.
They find their way to Fifth avenue and Sixth
avenue. Getms are not daunted by we-alth
or petition, and they go along, too. They
find their way alike to prince or beggar."
Speaking of the reoent strike among the
women tailors, and alao of child labor. Miss
Kerper said further:
"These women are not properly protected
by factory or mercantile law. Dr. Daniel
declares it is a wrong for a woman to be
obliged to work from 2 or 3 o'clock in the
morning until 11 at night. What have we I
wi.iu. v been about?
"All children should be put under mercantile
law. No child under 10 years of age should I
be ob'iged to work from 3:30 o'clock in the j
morning until 11 o'clock at night, and yet ]
they do. I should say this was wrong in a j
Christian city and at the end cf the nine- I
toer.th century. Some say these poor crea
tures, who never have time even to eat to
gether, and not discontented. I tell you it la
the apathy of despair."
The great preventive against sweating is
the union label, wbicb is a sign of organiza
tion, union and power.
■-.Most cf the improved conditions," she con
ttnued, "come tiii\>ugh trades unions. Some
people think trades unions are only for i
strikes. Not so. You need organization as I
a protection to employer, employe and the j
public. If you were a collection of men, I
would s-ay buy nothing without the union
label. The National Federation of Women's
Clubs has organized au industrial committee.
It may be conservative, but I don't care; it
will grow, and the downfall of the sweating
system will be hastened. Put your disfran
chised shoulders to the wheel, and when you
purchase inquire where your goods are
made."

There is a Spauish «iub in Boston that has

MARRIAGES OF GREAT MEN.
Seem to Be Given to. Clio outing Maids
of Humble Station.
Byron married Miss Millbank to get money
to pay his debts. It turned out a bad shift.
Robert Burns married a farm girl, with
whom he fell in love while they worked to
gether lv the plow field.
Milton married the daughter of a country
squire. He was an austere recluse, while
she was a rosy, romping .country lass that
could not endure the restraint Imposed upon
her; so they separated. Subsequently, how
ever, she returned, and they lived tolerably
happy together.
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were
cousins, and about the only examples in the
long life of English monarchs wherein sin
cere affection existed.
Shakespeare loved and wedded a farmer's
daughter.
Washington married a. woman with two
children. It is enough to say that she was
worthy of him, and they lived as married
folks should—in perfect harmony.
John Adams married the daughter of a
Presbyterian clergyman. Her father objected
on account of John's being a lawyer—he had
a bad opinion of the morals of the profession.
John Howard, the great philanthropist, mar
ried his nurse. She was altogether beneath
him in social life and intellectual capacity,
and besides this wus fifty-two years o'.d,
while he was twenty-five. He would not take
"No" for an answer and they were married
and lived happily together until she died,
which occurred two yeffrs afterward.
Peter the Great c-f Russia married a peisant
girl. She made an excellent wife and a.
sagacious empress.
Humboldt married a poor girl because he
loved her. Of course, they were happy.
Edward Lyttou Bulwer, the English states
man and novelist, married a girl much his
inferior in position and got a shrew for his
wife. Of course, he was unhappy.—Philadel

Liked to Be Scolded.
The late Emperor of Russia, whose pas3lon
for peace was his most distinguished charac
teristic, was much attached to the late Queen
of Denmark, his mother-in-law, says Harper's
Weekly. Never having been educated for the
throne, the burden and cares of autocracy
sat heavily upon him. The late Queen of
Denmark had a shrewd tongue, and was wont
to exercise it on her numerous aud powerful
connections. As a mother-in-law she was not
deficient to those qualities attributed by bar
barian and civilized nations alike to the
mother of a man's wife. The Prince ot Wales
has not visited the Danish court except at
rare intervals. With the late Russian em
peror it was different. He enjoyed his an
nual visit to Fredensborg as the happiest
period of his year, and his zesfc was enhanced
by the way in which he was taken to task
by his mother-in-law, who vigorously scolded
him when his actions did not, ln her opinion,
achieve the standard she laid down for her
sons-in-law. I was told on one occasion,
when the czar was in Copenhagen, by a high
functionary at the Danish court, that the late
Russian emperor was probably tho only man
in Europe who looked forward to his mother
ln-aw's annual scoldins as one of the
keenest pleasure of his life.

A sandy-complexloned gentleman thrust his
head throuch the marriage license window in
the office of tho clerk of the district court
yesterday and beckoned to Deputy Harry
Sundberg, who was inside figuring how much
a month was contained in $1,500 annually.
*-Ay vant a license," said the stranger.
Mr. Sundberg smiled sympathetically and
pulled down the record of bliss a.-id prepared
to fill out the blanks. "What Is the name?"
he asked.
"Carl Hansen."
"And the other name?" inquired Sundberg
with his insinuating manner.
••Hilda."
"Hilda, what else?"
"Yoost Hilda."
Sundberg was puzzled. '-What is her age?"
he asked.
"Yoost seven yare," responded the appli
cant.
The startled clerk beckoned to Chief Clerk
; Fitzgerald to sneak around and apprehend
I the scoundrel, but before the capture couid

directed to the prefer place.
McCardy lir.it nn Idea.
Comptroller McCardv sings agiin his old
song about $2,000,000 cf interiit-bearing debt
having been paid by the city since he waa
e'eated comptroller In 1592.
It has always been contended by Mr. Mc-
Cardy that the Republican party and the Re
publican eorcptro! er ma.' this debt paying
j possible, and it could have been accomplished
| oniy by the grand »:d party and its present
i representative in the c.mptro.ler's .effioe.
Now, however, the comptroller sugg-«ts,
j inasmuch as tha < i:y needs some permanent
j improvements, that bonds r.r certificates cf in
j debtednesa be iss;vd which will make an-
I other generation bear a share of the burdens,
j just as t_x;>ayei_ I've been doing, for im
j provementa made previous to the time Mr.
McCardy assumed charge of the city'a cash.
It is possible that the officials whj arranged
for the ?2,Cho,COi debt which Mr. McCardy
and the Republican party have succee-ied in
paying oil tad the same idea as to tlie future
taxpayers standing tto expense as Mr. ilf>
Cardy now puts forward.

Minneapolis—December trade thus far
has met expectations, and in most cases job
bing business in November exceeded last

trade, and ln dry goods jobbers are receiving
good sorting orders. The volume of trade
in heavy hardware is not large, though for

GENERAL. TRADE.
Dry Goods—General operations are yet
moderate, but cotton fabrics are showing a
more healthy tone. These goods have mat
with a better business, and on many kinds of
goods recent sales show a marked advance ln
price. Heavy gray goods are costing more,
while light fabrics in the way of printcioths
are also doing better. The large surplus of
tlie latter goods has been cleaned up, and
buyers are more anxious to get in their con
tracts. Printed fabrics are quiet, and prices
ruling are too lew compared with the cost of
the unfinished goods. Ginghams are firm and
In good shape for the coming season. Dress
woolens are dull and unsatisfactory. Spring
orders placed are small, and the season ap
pears to be about over at first hands. Men's
wear woolens are quiet and conditions are
not good.—Bradstreet's, Dec. 10.
• * a
Dry Goods—The improvement in the tone
of the cotton goeds market noted last week
has been quite confirmed ln the course of this
week's business. There have been few open
changes fen prices, but quite generally sellers
have assumed a firmer attitude, and special
concessions in the shape of discounts are fre
quently withdrawn. In one way or another,
either by open price reductions or quiet
"deals," or by a good demand for export,
stocks ln first hands have been marked down
to a level bringing them under easy control,
and with a continued demand larger than
usual se'.lors are gradually recovering lost
ground. The retail trade is reported good,
and prospects encouraging for a large con
sumptive demand in the coming spring sea
son. In the woolen goods division also busi
ness has been on an encouraging scale, re
orders for spring in both men's wear fabrics
and dress gcod3 Improving. Tiie financial con

being heard on the score of backward col

Wool—The market ls showing fair activity
as a whole, and at the lower basis of prices
established manufacturers are disposed to
take more wool. The salea in Boston this
week foot up in excess of 5,000,000 pounds, of
which about 1,500,000 pounds were foreign.
These latter woo"ss hold strong in price, and
buy, ra who require supplies ar9 able to g»t
eseions. Of the sales made, about
!. yyi pounds were Australian, some of
the larger mi".s having r.aken quite large lots,
and are negotiating on other large lines.
Tbrse wools are being offered several cents
Per pound below the cost to import new sup
plies, and every sale made cuts into the
avalJaKe supply here just that amount More
fleece wools have been sold this week, about
755,000 pound's washed clothing and dt-iaines
being taken, but mostly on private terms,
which would indicate some concessions. In
washed fleeces are selling fairly and alio
pulled wools. Territory wools are in flair de
mand, sales Including about 1,500,C00 pounds
on basis of 40 to 45 cents scoured.—Brad

■Wool—Markets have been active, with
sales of 10,6t»5,2C0 lbs iv two weeks, which is
nearly the average for this season in pros
perous years. There is a much broader de
mand, many small manufacturers following
the larger who bought heavily when eoaeea
«i_j_. were Aral made, and reaorta show mo___.
extensive orders for goods. Prices average
nearly half a cent lower than about Nov. Ist
on 100 quotations by Coates Brothers, of Phil

tory fine and fine medium.—Dun's Review

Boots and Shoes—Doubtless storms cut
off Boston shipments, which were smaller
than for the same week in previous years
except in 1393, but certainly Increased beyond
all precedent shipments by wholesalers hero
and In other cities, many of the who'esale
houses working their full force until mid
night six to eight days in meeting orders.
Retail trade was also greatly stimulated, and
the result will probably be more activity for
the manufacture at once, which has still or
ders ahead for part capacity, but with much
machinery idle. There is noticed already a
little buying by jobbers.—Dun's Review,
Dec. 10.

Leather—While some concessions are
made to close stocks, and the average 13
lower, as it usual at this time ot" the year,
the market is generally steady, but remarka
bly inactive. A change of assortments in
glazed kid is equivalent to a concession in
price cf about half a cent.—Dun's Review.
Dec. 10.

Hides—A shade advance was denoted in
packer Colorados and country buffs, but oa
the whole the Chicago market shows little
activity. The usual report appears that lt

tle at the four chief Western markets wero
514,617 head, actually smaller than in any
year ot the past seven except 1-0", though

Iron and Stpel—Very few havo realized
what enormous sales of rai's followed the
rupture of the half formed combnation, nor
at What low prices, for while $17 Is generally
quoted at the East, sales at much lower
figures are reported, and the competition be
tween Western and Eastern Interests w; a ex
ceedingly sharp. This week purchases of ir,o,
--000 tons Bessemer pig by Pittsburg works are
reported, with $10 at Valley wo-ks quoted, and
100,000 tons billets were sold here at $15.60,
40,000 tons to one hoop mill. Valley furnaces
•sre said to have sold their output of Bessemer
for six months ahead. Pig is also st:onger
at the East, $11.50 being quoted here for No.
1 anthracite. An Inquiry for 10,000 ton«
Bessemer for Chicago from Russia is of In
terest.
The demand for finished products Is not oon
fined to rails, nor to cars for which, and for
bars and plates to be used therein. Tha
transactions at Pittsburg and Chicago are be
yond all prcctdent, while at Philadelphia the
mills are full, with one more steamship or
der for Delaware yards. Though it ls the
inactive season for structural works, an order
for 5,000 tons bridge material was placed at
Chicago. Rods are firmer, and 11,000 tons
wire reds were sold at Chicago at $23. In
black -sheets improvement at last appears, due
at Chicago to heavy roofing demands. With
out any change in prices of finished products
except rails, pig averages a shade higher than
at any other point this year.—Dun's Review

AMERICAN SHOE MANUFACTURERS.
In a recent issue the Boston Transcript re
lates that our shoe manufacturers are realiz
ing, as they have never before, the need of a
foreign cutlet fer the large number of goods
that, with their present facilities, they are
capable of producing and which cannot be
absorbed by our present population even
under the most favorable conditions.' They
are. consequently, casting a wistful eye
across seas and over our Sou -hern hemis
phere. Juat now England and Germany are
supplying the non-prcduc:ng countries with
tueir footwear, though there is abundant
proof that our manufacturers can undersell
cither on account of tho greater skill of our
workers or the sy.tem employed in our
shops; while, as a matter of fait, American
made snees are preferred over those of any
other country when the consumer is given the
opportunity to choose. There is admittedly
a great future for our export business ln
taese good, and the New England manu
facturers can be depended on to make the
most of it fen good season.
WILL CONFER WITH
SISTER CITY MILLERS
CHAMBER OF COMMEHCE HOPfiS
TO PRESERVF THE LOCAL
FEEDING OF SHEEP
Gon. Flower Yesterday Presented
tbe Subject In a Forcible Man
ner, and It Was Decided to Have
a Conference as Soon as Possible.
Gen. Mark D. Flower yesterday call
ed the attention of the chamber of
commerce to the danger which threat
ened tho local sheep-feeding industry,
recently so important a factor in the
city's wealth. Gen. Flower said that
an iniquitous combination of grain
dealers advancing the price of feed un
duly hud threatened to ruin an indus
try which had -j.",0,000 sheep feeding in
St. Paul this year.
He thought that the chamber ought
to appoint a committee of three to con
fer with the millers, as it was hardly
worth while to confer with the grain
dealers.
S. Li. Moore embodied Gen. Flower's
suggestion in a motion which was
adopted.
The report of the committee on leg
islation on the annual report of the
interstate commerce commission was
taken up as the special order.
Mr. Lindeke called attention to the
action of the Jobbers' union, which
had voted that the commission ought
not to he vested with additional powers.
W. H. Lightner's substitute resolu
tion, to the effect that the commission
ought not to be endowed with addi
tional powers, was adopted by a unan
imous rising vote.
The committee on membership re
ported new members as follows: Am
i-rose Tighe, E. Vf. Winter, Edward
Feldhauser, H. H. Horton, Charles E.
Hamilton.
The following gentlemen were report
ed to fill vacancies in the board of di
rectors: A. Albrecht, B. F. Ellison W
S. Flynt, R. C. Jefferson, C. K. Mac
kean, E. C. Rogers, Ambrose Tighe, F.
B. Doran, C. E. Dickerman and W. A.
Strickland.
The mercantile and manufacturers'
committee reported as follows upon a
communication from the Trades and
Labor Assembly of St Paul asking tha
chamber to rose its influence in secur
ing stone cutting for local buildings
for local stone-cutting unions:
A very important matter in any city Is tho
fact that owner, and contractor, are per
mitted to purchase material in the opeu mar
ket at market prices. Anything that ronflne.s
the pur£ha__ng of either labor or material *o
a certain locality vviil certainly mw an in
creace in the eest or will <<o.mpel tlie owner to
ptuchace unsuitable materia! or inlorior labor.
Bicad principles of trade ars Involved in the
copsir".-'ration of this matter. We believe it
is to the best Interests of the city at large
to encourage the erection of buildings j.nd be
lieve !'. wouid be detrimental to this end
should influence be used to compel > J waters or
contractors to purchase labor at one market
the result being that buildings will cost more
than they should, the trndemcy being to de
crease the number of buildings erected, nnd
previ ot capita] from seeking an Investment 'n
our locality. A decrease in the number of
boll-f-rg- erected would certainly he detri
ments! *o the interests of the stone cutters'
union ami the general market in the city.
We recommend that ho far as possible In all
enterprises preference be given to the horn*
labor marks*.
The report was adopted.
The committee on state affairs re
ported in favor of recommending to
Gov. Clough and to Gov.-elect Lind
the need of an appropriation for two
nev.' buildings at the state agricultural
school, one for the veterinary school
and the other for the school of natural
sciences.
An invitation from Dean Liggett, of
the school, to the chamber requesting
a visit was referred to the committee
on reception to fix a date for the visit.
-The chamber voted unanimously to
ha\e an annual banquet this year, the
place and time of the event to be left
with President Lightner and the ex
ecutive committee.
It was reported yesterday that ln conse
quence of the exposure of the corner In The
Globe, the price of screenings had been re
duced to }7 per ton.
