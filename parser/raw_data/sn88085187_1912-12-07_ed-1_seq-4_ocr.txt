We're All O. X.-Abroad
President Taft's "swan song" message sounds as if the swan had got
hold of a lot of things that were foreign to its usual menu, but which were
highly relishable to able bodies as weH as moi-ibund birds.
According to Cousin Bill about the biggest thing we possess is our for
eign trade, notwithstanding that we don't produce enough to fatten our
selves, and the biggest thing that has been done for us in four years is Bill's
Herculean labor in converting the state department from an "archaic and in
adequate machine" into a forceful and well greased engine for the promo
tion of American sales abroad at lower prices than the American can take
advantage of.
He calls particular attention to the fact that in thus cleaning the state
department stables of sloth, inefficiency, impotency and other augean filth,
he has retained in office a big bunch of ministers, ambassadors, consuls,
smaller diplomats and other left-overs from previous administrations.
This note of the song is so full-voiced that one is justified in suspecting
the mother swan is either trying to mollify the Bull Moose or to save some of
her own chickens from the hungry and prowling democracy.
However, the message indicates that our foreign business is good and
that Uncle Sain is some diplomat all along the line from measly little Liberia
to the august court of St. James. Jt is not a state paper that ' will set the
archives afire, but it surely is full of cheer to exporters.
The Produce Combine's Corner On Food
The prosecuting attorney of King county has taken steps to prosecute a
Combination of seven wholesale produce dealers of Seattle who are accrued of
controlling the prices on fruits and vegetables to the injury of both the pro
ducer and the consumer. This combine supplies many of'the retail mer
chants of Tacoina and when it was organized one year ago it was frankly
stated in letters sent out to fruit and vegetable shippers—those who actually
produce the foodstuffs of the Northwest, that because the seven firms in the
combine could buy in carload lots, they naturally expected to control or fix
the prices. The avaricious custom of Seattle produce merchants have been a
by-word with fruit and vegetable shippers in Pierce county for years. In one
season, the berry growers of Vashon Island were gouged out of more than
one thousand dollars by one Seattle firm; and ever since then the Yashon
growers have; preferred to ship their berries through the Tacoma market
Jhe activity of the King county authorities will be warmly welcomed by the
smaller fruit and vegetable growers of this section of the state for the threat
to exclude "kickers" fronj the Seattle market has invariably put the quietus
on any action that the growers might have contemplated. Surely the start
ing point in the war on high prices is with the agency which invents the hi"h
price system, and with market produce, it appears to be the wholesale pro
duce combine that invites investigating.
What's What?
Also the National Cash Register company is under investigation as a
trust, as the dispatches voluminously report in the world at large Tn fact
there seems to be reason for visioning a faint, rosy dawn of guapicioii about
this business.
Is it possible that every big concern in the country has decided to have
itseJt investigated on trust charges—for advertising purposes? What 1
There are so many eggs in storage in
New York, it is said, that dealers fear
the prices may drop to ten cents a
dozen by New Year's. Let's try to bear
it with Christian fortitude.
Already four Tacoma stores have the

Every day we can think of something
to say to bring fresh praise to the win
ter climate of Puget Sound, albeit some
of us affect to scorn it. For instance,
the golf enthusiasts enjoy their game
all the year 'round, while in the east
the links are buried 'neath an everlast

Next time the city builds a gravity

The artists and critics may rave
as they will
Of prudishness prlmand pre
cise,
They claim that it hampers the!r
art and their skill
To have to be proper and nice.
But for all of its squeaiuishnesß,
all of its cant,
It holds us to decency, plain,
And I'm willing to lift up my
voice in a chant,
A hymn to the "Puritan
Strain."
It may be a trifle too rigid and
grim
And hard on the spirit of
Youth,
But it keeps the commandments
from growing too dim
And it holds to the right and
the truth.
