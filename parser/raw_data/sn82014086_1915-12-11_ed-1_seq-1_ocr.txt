BULGARS FOUGHT WITH
Question of Interest Now Whether the Bulgarians and Ger

Peninsula, Where Fresh German Artillery is Arriving
Italians Have Gained
Front in the Direction of
London, Dec. 10, 10.10 p. m. The
Anglo-French forces have commenced
a general retirement from southern
Serbia and it is suggested that their
destination is the region of Saloni
ka. This retirement was necessitat
ed not only by the superior forces
Which the Bulgarians and Germans
opposed to the allies, but to a threat
of an outflanking movement from Pe
trovo, where the Bulgarians have ar
rived and also to danger to their line
of communication from Bulgarian ir
regulars who had crossed the Greek
frontier.
Bulgars Fought With Desperation.
Both the British and the French
forces, who are well supplied with ar
tillery and machine guns, engaged in
ft four days' battle in which they in
flicted very heavy losses on the Bul
garians, who fought with desperation
and the greatest courage. Attack aft
er attack was repulsed, but the Bul
garians still came on and each evening
the allies fell back to new positions
where events of the day before were
repeated.
Will Germans Enter Greece?
The question now arises whether the
Bulgarians and Germans will follow
the allies across the Greek frontier
and what attitude the Greek govern
ment will adopt. King Constantine
has promised to use his army to pro
tect, the retiring force if they under
take to reembark and has shown his
good faith by preventing Bulgarian
raiding bar.ds frorj destroying the al
lies' communication, but it is doubt
ful whether the allies will agree to
evacuate Saloniki, which under the
guns of their ships would provide a
good defensive position and a base
from which other operations could be
undertaken. It is on this point that
negotiations between Greece and the
entente allies are now proceeding and
the feeling here and at Paris and at
Rome is given briefly in the follow
ing printed in large type bv The Ev
ening Star:
Greece Must Soon Decide.
"The moment is approaching when
the Greek government must decide
The allies now more than ever before,
cMuiie iicruw. oL movement or Sal
onika TJithirto their demands had
been met by procrastination and a
refusal will mean war."
Montenegrins' Give Effective Assis
tance. While retiring from southern Ser
bia the allied forces have been given
effective assistance bv the Montene
grins and Serbians who fled into Al
bania. This is shown in the resist
ance which both the Serbians and the
Montenegrins are offering the invad
ers. The Montenegrins have been
fighting a series of rear guard actions
and delivering counter-attacks which
the Austrian? admit seriouslv delay
ed their advance. The Austrians are
now attempting a new advance from
the region of CBarani, west of Ipek.
Serbians Still Showing Activity.
The Serbians, who are now receiv
ing supplies from the Adriatic coast
are still showing activity. The
Italians also have reinforced the gar
rison at Alvona, from which place
they are sending relief to the Serbians
coming from Ochrida Lake district.
Russians Dispersed Rebels.
There is no further news from Mes
opotamia, where, according to last ac.
counts, the Turks were attacking Kut-el-Amara
and had actually reached a
point on the river below that town
but the success of the Russians in dis
persing a band of Persian rebels un
der German and Turkish officers at
Sultan Bulak Pass on the road to
Hamadan, it Is believed, will ease the
situation In that part of the world.
Much activity is reported on the
Gallipoli penisula, where it is report
ed, fresh German artillery is arriv
ing; and on the Isonzo front, where
the Italians have gained more ground
In the direction of Gorizia. Along oth
er fronts no important changes have
occurred.
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH
AUSTRIA ARE STRAINED.
Officials Preserve Silence, But Crisis
Is Grave.
Washington, Dec. 10.-Dipiomatic
relations wltah Austria are In grave
danger of being broken off over the
sinking ol the Italian liner Ancona
with the Jobs of American lives. All
officials here continue to preserve
silence over the negotiations with
Austria but through the veil which
has hften drawn around, the situation
Is seen a crisis just as grave as that
which attended the submarine nego
tiations wttlh Germany.
The question of breaking diplomatic
relations may he said to depend upon
a. satisfactory reply to Secretary Lan
sing's note, which now probably is be
fore the Vienna foreign office, demand

and assurances that passenger ships
shall not be attacked without warning
or an opportunity for non-combatants
to take places of safety.
The situation tonight is tense. It
is compared to the last days of the
Arabic negotiations with Germany,
when probably no one but President
Wilson himself knew how close the
country was to a severance of diplo
matic relations with Berlin.
Officials of the state department will
not discuss the American note, even so
far as to say they know whether it
has reached Vienna, or when they ex
pect to permit publication of it in this
country. It is taken for granted in
official circles generally, however, that
the communication cabled last Tues
day must have been delivered before
this, and a reply is anxiously awaited.
RECRUITING STATIONS IN
LONDON KEPT BUSY
On Last Day of the Trial Period for
Earl Derby's Plan.
London, Dec. 11, 1.30 a. m. The last
day of the trial period for the Earl of
Derby's recruiting plan opened with
reports from all parts of London that
there was no diminution but rather an
increase in recruiting, and all officers
in charge reported excellent progress.
A feature of the situation is that al
though single men are coming forward
in better proportion, married appli
cants seem to predominate at many
centers. Nearly all of the recruiting
stations kept open all night and until
the early hours today. Similar re
ports come from many of the pro
vincial towns.

kept up cries of "Peace! Peace!" and
even went so far as to use insulting
language toward the royal house.

SOUTH AMERICAN
COMMENT ON MESSAGE.
Press Unanimous in Praise of Presi
dent Wilson's Attitude.
Buenos Aires, Dec. 10. La Razon,
commenting on President Wilson's
message, says that the United States
will not takeu p arms for an aggres
sion against the other American na
tions. Continuing. La Razon says:
"There are elsewhere dangers which
suggest the need for tranquility and
solidarity. Neutrality, however, with
out any provision for defense, has no
value. President Wilson's message
sounds the alarm in order to uphold
the rights of civilization."
Other newspapers comment favor
ably on the m&ssage. La Manana
says: "Mr. Wilson's message embodies
a fine conception of American politics
and bears witness to the greatest ele
vation of mind, because it is inspired
by honesty. It is therefore necessary
to reject all apprehension, entertained
by a few, towards the so-called North
American peril."
La Prenza: "In the course of the
last few years the high political
tribune at Washington has become fa
vorably inclined toward the Occidental
hemisphere. Let us listen to the lang
guage of amity and solidarity, founded
on mutual respect and every one's
right. Here we already gave some
American personalities to understand
that the Monroe doctrine might re
nounce the tutelary character it as
sumed at first and must evolve towards
Pan-Americanism. We have never
hitherto listened to anything more
beautiful and more authoritative than
President Wilson's message, which
moved us deeply and afforded us an
immense satisfaction. It is an invalu
able document so far as the destiny of
the Americas is concerned. It is im
bued with the principles set by Roose
velt, Taft and Root. We rejoice over
the event and proclaim our adhesion
to Mr. Wilson's policy."
FAMILY OF THREE BURNED
TO DEATH AT TYLERVILLE.
Bodies Found in the Ruins of Their
Home Early Yesterday.
Tylerville, Conn., Dec. 10. Three
persons were burned to death here
early today when their home, located
near the Tylerville camp ground, was
destroyed by fire. The charred bodies
were found in the ruins several hours
later.
The victims were Joseph Ball and
his wife and their son Jacob. Ball
and his wife were each about 50 years
old and the son IS.
The house, an old building, was in
an unfrequented section and nothing
was known of the fire until a milk
man arrived on the scene several
hours afterwards.
The body of Ball was found near
the door, while that of his wife was
some distance away. The son's body
was found in the cellar, where it had
fallen when the floor gave way.

fire and had tried to get to the door,
but was overcome by the smoke and
suffocated.
It is believed that the fire started
from a wood fire which had been left
in the stove over night.

LEAVING DRAWBRIDGE OPEN
Through Which Automobile Dropped
Into Cape Cod Canal.
Barnstable, Mass., Dec. 10. David

over the Cape Cod canal at Buzzard's
bay, the opening of which last night

South Bethlehem, Pa.. Dec. 10.-An
explosion today in the fuse plant of
the .fcsethienem Steel company at Red
ington, six miles from here, killed one
workman and injured fifteen others,
several of them seriously. The acci

or the plant and resulted, it is De
No Question But
It makes little difference what the line of businesses it is suscep
tible to the influence of publicity if it is wisely used. It wasn't only a
half dozen years ago that pineapples brought into this country from
the Pacific were so small in amount that they were not even listed in
the government reports. An opportunity was seen for development
and thirteen of the leading producers formed an association for adver
tising their goods.
The next year the amount of such produce brought into this coun
try was valued at a million and a half. That has grown steadily un
til in 1913 the sum total of such importations reached over three and
a half million. The business had more than doubled in four years
because of the persistent and thorough manner in which advertising
had been resorted to.
It is a similar story to that which can be told of many other bus
iness development. Printer's ink rightly used and used where it
reaches the people insures results. That is the kind of service The
Bulletin renders because of the thorough manner in which it covers
its field. It should be used consistently at all times.

One Man Killed.
Philip Adams of Easton, Pa., was
the man killed. The injured were
brought to St. Luke's hospital in this
city. Their injuries consist mainly of
burns, but all will probably recover, it
is believed.
Room Badly Damaged.
The room in which the explosion oc
curred was badly damaged. All the
employes who were at work in ad
joining departments and buildings
were sent home for the remainder of
the day.
Information regarding the explosion
was for a time difficult to obtain, offi
cials of the Bethlehem Steel company
in this city maintaining their usual
silence as to what occurred within its
plant. When word of the explosion
was telephoned here, all available am
bulances of the steel works were im
mediately rushed to Redington and the
injured quickly brought to this city.
The fuse plant employes several
hundred men who are at present em
ployed chiefly in making shell fuses
for the entente allies.
This is the second explosion that
has occurred at the Redington plant
in nearly four months. On Aug. 20 ten
men were burned by a powder flash.
TWO ANCHOR LINE
GRAIN ELEVATORS BURNED
With an Estimated Loss of $750,000
at Erie, Pa.
Erie, Pa., Dec. 10. Two of the three
Anchor line grain elevators owned by
the Pennsylvania Railroad company
here were destroyed by fire early to
day with their occupants, about 500,
000 bushels of wheat. The loss is es
timated at $750,000. A third elevator
holding 350,000 bushels of wheat was
saved after a hard fight by firemen.
The wheat camef rom Canada and
awaited shipment to Great Britain and
her allies.
The fire which started at 2 o'clock
this morning, was virtually under con
trol four hours later. It had its origin
in the shaft of the main elevator and
was driven by a strong northeast wind
into the grain bins below. The fire
men were handicapped by a maze of
railroad tracks on which were many
freight cars.
The elevators stood on the share of
Erie bay. Several steamers at the
piers were saved by being towed into
the bay. An investigation of the ori
gin of the fire will be requested. No
other cause than spontaneous combus
tion has yet been assigned.

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF
WAR ON UNITED STATES
Discussed in Seven Column Article
Berlin Vorwaerts.
London. Dec. 11, 2.2S a. m. Copies
of the Berlin Vorwaerts received here
contain an article several columns in
length discussing the probable com
mercial and financial effects of the
war on the United States. Under the
heading, "The Real Victor," the writer
concludes that the United States will
reap the greatest economic advantages
from the war and that neither Ger
many nor Great Britain stands to gain
anything, whichever wins.
"The sudden withdrawal of Grmon
exports from the world markets," says
the article, 'affords the United States
a tremendous opportunity for extend
ing its trade, particularly in South
America, while the accompanying fin
ancial expansion will be made easy by
the new American currency laws.
"If the American operations are
skilfully carried out, the English
bankers in South America will feel
their effects and the Americans will
rapidly secure such financial predom
inance in the southern continent as
under ordinary circumstances could
be expected for fifty years.
"The European belligerents must
continue for a long time their large
orders of merchandist and foodstuffs
from the United States and the money
with which they will ipay for them
will provide plentiful resources for the
commercial campaign in South Amer
ica. "Thus we see that the war has not
resulted just as the English had ex
pected. True, German trade has been
shattered, but now amidst the din of
war a new competitor is seen arising
who will soon prove more dangerous
to England's position in the world
mraket than Germany would have
been thirty years hence.
"while the European countries grad
ually are exhausting themselves the
United States is paying off all its lia
bilities and laying up a financial re
serve which will assure her a per
manent place in world commerce a
place which the enthusiastic Amer
ican statesman of the past never
draemed possible."

Columbus, 0., and Many
where in the world, will assert itself
once for all in international affairs and
that if America preserves her poise,
preserves her self-possession, pre
serves her attitude of friendliness
towards all the world, she may have
the privilege, in one form or another,
of being the mediating influence by
which these things may be induced.
Spiritual Mediation.
The president explained he did not
mean governmental mediation, but
spiritual mediation, the recognition of
the world that here is a country that
has always wanted things done that
way and whose merchants when they
carry their goods, will carry their
ideals along with them. He declared

spread its influence to the end of the
world.

"and the men like you throughout the
United States, to apply your minds to
your business as if they were building
up for the world a great constitution
of the United States; as if you were
going out in the spirit of service and

that comes only through service; the
kind of service which is statesman .

rangements which are most service-,
able to the world."

FEDERAL JURISDICTION
OVER RAILROAD QUESTIONS
Favored by Howard Elliott, President
of the New Haven Road.
Boston. Dec. 10. Federal Jurisdic
tion over "some of the larger railroad
questions" which are now under au
thority of state commissions or legis
latures was favored by Howard Elliott,
president of the New York, New Ha
ven and Hartford railroad, when h
closed the company's case in connec
tion with the inquiry of the publie
service commission into the New Ha
ven's financial condition. "The publia
interest would be better served and a
great waste of energy and time of
those who are trying to administer th
properties would be obviated by such
a change," he said. Issue of stock!
and bonds were included in the sub
jects which he had in mind.
After F. A. Farnham, counsel foi
the road, had made a plea for valida
tion by this stale of the road's recori
in the past. President Elliott urged
upon the commission the expediency
of abandoning any further restrictiv
powers which might be contemplated
and said that no additional penaltiet
should be imposed for the violation ol
any laws now on the books.
Mr. Elliott advocated an extension
in the powers of railroad companies,
permitting them to acquire securities
of leased lands and to purchase th
stock or securities of any company "if
the public service commission finds
such purchase to be in the public in
terest." TEMPORARY OFFICERS
