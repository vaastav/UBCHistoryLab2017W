Gross, president of the Mllwaukeo Ameri

a Western leaguo franchise In Milwaukee,
where ho still retains tho old American
leuguo grounds. If ho la given tho fran
chise, ns ho undoubtedly will be, tho St.
l'aul franchise will probably bo given to
lilm, thus dropping St. Paul out of tho cir

Because catarrhal diseases nro so com
mon nnd becuuso catarrh Is not rapidly
fatal, people too often overlook nnd no
glcct It until naniD Incurable aliment de
velops as u result of tho neglect.
Tho Inflamed condition of tho membrane
of tho noso nnd throat makes a fertile sail
for tho' germs of Pneumonia nnd Consump
tion, In fact, cnturrhal pneumonia nnd ca
tarrhal consumption nro tho most common
forms of those dreaded diseases which an
nually cause moro than ono-quarter of the
deaths tn this country.
Itcmedlcfl for catarrh aro nlmost ns nu
merous ns catarrh sufforors, but very few
havo nny actual merit us n cure, tho only
good derived being simply a temporary re
lief. Thero Is, however, n very cffectlvo rem-
cdy recently discovered which Is rapidly
becoming famous for Its great valuo tu re-
llovlng and permanently curing all forms
of catarrhal diseases, whether locnted In
tho head, throat, lungs pr stomach.
Tho now catarrh euro Is principally com
posed of n gum derived from tho Kucolyp
tuB treo nnd tho gum possesses cxtrnordl
iiory healing and antiseptic properties. It
U tnken Internally In tho form of a lozcnga
or tablet, pleasant to tho tasto and so harm
less that Uttlo children tnko them with
safety and benefit.
' Uucolyptus oil nnd tho bark nro some
time used, but nro not so convenient nor
so palatable as tho gum.
Undoubtedly tho best quality la found In
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, which may bo
found In nny drug store, nnd any catarrh
.sufferer who has tried douches, Inhalers
nnd liquid medicine will bo surprised nt
tho rapid Improvement aftor n few days'
uto of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, which nro
composed of tho gum of tho Eucolyptua
tree, combined with other nntlBeptlcs
which destroy the germs of catarrh In the
Mood and expel tho catarrhal poison from
tho system.
Dr, Ramsdell, In speaking of catarrh and
Its cure, gays: "After ninny experiments
I hnve given up tho Idea ot curing caturrb
by tho uso of Inhalers, washes, siiIvcb or
liquid medicines. I havo always had tho
best results from Stuart's Catarrh Tablets;
the red gum and other valuablo antiseptics
contained In theso tsblets make them, In
my opinion, far superior to any of the
numerous catarrh remedies so extensively
advertised. Tho fact thnt Stuart's Cntnrrh
Tablets nro sold lu drug stores, under pro
tectlon of n trade-mark, should not preju
dice conscientious physicians against them,
becauso their undoubted merit and harm

For colds In the hend, for coughs, ca

Ng Poon Chow, tho well known Chlncso
editor of Snn Francisco, and three Chinese
musicians appeared last night at tho Sec-
ond Prcsbyterlnn church In tho interests
of tho Presbyterian Mission board. Mr.
Chow is a graduate of the Presbyterian
Theological seminary In San FrnncUco nnd
the young men who nro traveling with him
are highly educated Chinamen and sldllcd
musicians. ,
The program opened with several Chinese
songs nnd instrumental selections, mt.
Chow spoke on "The accent Trouble In
China ns Viewed from a Chlneso Stand
point." Ho explained by wny of Introduc
tion thnt Americans havo hnil but llttio op
portunity to know tho Chlncso version of
the recent unpleasantness nnd assured hln
henrers that It was a two-sided Quarrel.
Ho spoko In part ns follows:
"Doxer to an American Is n terrible word.
It Is nssoclntcd with tho butchery of
Christians. To Chinamen lloxer means n
flash of civilization. Tho Iloxors thought
thoy were doing a nohlo work In expelling
foreigners and .freeing China from intruders.
"Two causes led to tho trouble In China,
tho clash of two civilizations nnd tbo de-
slro of tho Chinese to prcservo their cus
toms. Nothing changes tn Chlnn. Every
thing changes continually In America. Tho
Chinese abhor tho continuous chnngo and
discontent of foreigners.
"Tho change of fashions In America antf
the litter lack of chnngo In China show tho
dlfforcnco between Chlncso and foreigners.
Yoiing women nro wearing tho clothing
. . . t ,i.in,.
inoir greai-BraniiinoiiiuiB wum uim mum
themselves In tho height of fashion. Chl
ncso people say their ancestors wero happy
without railroads nnd Insist that thoy must
bo hnppy without them.
"Chlncso hlenls aro In tho past nnd
Americans seo Ideals In tho futuro which
thoy dnslro to attain. China was at tho
height nf civilization when Romulus laid
tho foundations of Homo. Chinese people
aro studying tho books which wero written
boforo Christ. Chlncso education Is very
defective. Tho scholar Is honored, the sol
dier despised. Centuries of such trnlnlng
have mado an unwarllko nation'. China
men nro peaceful nnd nro considered cow
ards by other nutlonB.
"Aftor tho war with Japan tho young
Chlncso realized that tho greatness of tho
emplro was waning nnd decided that somo
reforms must come. But tho rulors silenced
this retfessnes8 nnd put a check on tho
movement for reform.
"Opium Is In part responBlblo for tho
massacro In China. It Is tho curso of
China, ns whisky 1b tho curso of Amorlcn.
Whisky makes'a bruto of a man, but opium
Is even worse. It tnkes the life out of a
man nnd renders him .usoless.
"In tho treatment of China western na
tions net on the theory tbnt might Is right.
China has been Imposed on becnuso It Is a
heathen nation nnd Is weak and unablo to
protect Itself. China has bcon terribly mis
treated by European nations. Ports havo
been seized nnd tho sacred land has been
encroached upon.
"The policy of tho United States In deal
Ing with China Is not tho policy of land
grabbing. It has cought mutual good In
reciprocity. Oreat sorrow swept over China
at tho time of tho assnsslnatlon nf Presi
dent McKtnley.
"This Is a critical tlmo In tho history
of China. Tho eniplro Is undergoing a com.
pleto change. If It' starts on tho right road
It will move on to greatness. If It start,
on tho wrong road It will go to ruin. Chris-
llanlty Is the only hopo for tho nation. It
Is the only foundation upon which a stable
government. cau bo established In China."
From Omaha Mr. Chow goes to Chicago,
and within tho next few weuks ho will lee
turo In most of tho larger eastern cities.
