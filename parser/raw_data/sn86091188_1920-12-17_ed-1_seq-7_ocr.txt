taxes has become an immediate
necessity. These taxes performed an In
d'spensahle service during the war The
need for their simplification, however, Is
lery great, in order to save the taxpayer
inconvenience and expense and in order
to make his liability more certain and
definite. Other and more detailed recom
mendations with regard to taxes will no
doubt be laid before you by the secretary
of the treasury and the commissioner of
internal revenue.
Vocational Training for Veterans.
"It is my priviege to draw to the at
tention of congress for very sympathetic
consideration the problem of providing
adequate facilities for the care and treat
ment of former members of the military
and naval forces who are sick or dis
abled as the result of their participation
in the war. These heroic men can never
be paid in money for the service they
patriotically rendered the nation. Their
reward will lie rather in realisation of
the fact that they vindicated the rlrhts of
their country and aided in safeguarding
civilisation. The nation's gratitude must
be effectively revealed to them by the
moat ample provision for their medical
care and treatment, as well as for their
vocational training and placement. The
time has come when a more complete
program can be formulated and more aat
Isfactorily administered for their treat
ment and training, and I earnestly urge
that the congress give the matter Its
early consideration. The secretary of the
treasury snd the hoard for vocational ed
ucation will outline In their annual re
ports proposals covering medical care and
rehabilitation which I am sure will en
gage your earnest study snd command
your most generous support.
Cold Storage Law Nesdsd.
"Permit me to emphasise once more
the need of action upon certain matters
upon which I dwell at some length in my
message to the second session of the
Sixty-sixth congress The necessity, for
example, of encouraging the manufac
ture of dyestuffs and related chemicals:
the importance of doing everything pos
sible to promote agricultural production
along economic lines, to Improve agri
cultural marketing and to make rural life
more attractive and healthful; the need
for a law regulating cold storage to limit
the time during which goods may be kept
in storage, prescribing the method of dis
posing of them if kept beyond the per
mitted period, snd requiring goods re
leased from storage in ail cases to bear
the date of their receipt. It would also
be most serviceable if it were provided
that all goods released from cold storage
for interstate shipment should have
plainly marked upon each package the
selling or market price at which they
went Into storage. In order that th# pur
chaser might be able to learn what
profits stood between him and the pro
ducer or the wholesale dealer. Indeed,
it would be very serviceable to the public
if all goods destined for interstate com
merce were made to carry u|H>n every
packing case whose form made It possible,
a plain statement of the price at which
they left the hands of the producer. I
respectfully call your attention alao to
the recommendations of the message re
ferred to with regard to a federal license
for all corporations engaged in interstat
commerce.
"In brief the Immediate legislative
need of the time Is the removal of all
obstacles to the realixatlon of the best
ambitions of our people in their several
class«'« of employment and the strength
ening of all instrumentalities by which
difficulties are to be met and removed
and Justice dealt out. whether hy law
or by some form of mediation and con
ciliation. 1 do not feel it to be my
privilege at present to suggest the de
tailed and particular methods by which
these object* may be attained but I
have faith that the inquir es of your sev
eral committee* will discover the way and
method.
