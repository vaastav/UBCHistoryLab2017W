A RADICAL KEY BOTE FOR CONORE88.
The New York Independent lays out for
Congress iti work for the winter, and among
the jobi which it would have done at once,
it mention the following:
Wo hope the lloiisa of Itapreseutatives
will promptly prepare articles of impeach
roent airninat the Supreme Court of thn
United Slates, including in whole bench of
judges, all and singular, for diiobedience to
tba Uiril itightl Mill. Ul course, when we
ay impeach men t, we mean tha mild pro-
cei of moral indignation, rather than the
toerce alternative of criminal proucution.
Tba thirteenth rale of aba Sokrwme Ooort is
as follows: ''The aerricn ( all aubpirnaa
thall be by a delivery of a vopjr thtirnof by
tne uthcur terving the iituie to the deiend
ant poraoually, or io cuae of huaband and
rile, to the buiband peraonallr, or by tear
ing a copy thereof at the dwelling-bouie or
uaual place ot abode ol each defendant,
with tome free white pertun, who i a mem
bar or resident io the family." Thi rule.be
it remembered, n a rule of the court over
which Salmon Portland Chaae, of ami slav
ery memory, daily presides!
iha unsettled condition of the South, the
continuous persecutions of the Negro, the
ostracism of Northern settlers, the continued
rebelliousness of many former rebola all
this requires the serious and stern attention
of Congress. We say it requires the atten
tion of Congress, not forgetting that it is the
duty of a 1 resident who Las said "Let
have peace ' to keep the peace. We hav
uttered few criticisms upon the admitiistra
tion of l'reaidoot Grant. It has seemed
us that from the bpsinning of his term
has been animated by a patriotic- desire to
do justice to the uetrro. Certainly, he has
signally proven bis willingness to see the
wronged race righted. He not only urged
in his inaugural the speedy passage of the
r tfteenth Amendment, but lie immediately
beean to appoint colored men to responsible
omces under the Uovernment. Only two
criticisms do we care to urge against our
well meaning Chief Magistrate: one of which
is that be has not alwnvs been ao happy
the selection of his white as of his black as
sociates in the Government; and the other
is that he has failed to make the negro's life
safe on the Southern plantations. If the
President answers, "I have done my best,'
then let Congress devise a way of doing bet
ter. I he need of interposition in the ne
gro's behalf was never greater than now.
Fnsumatio Train Braks.
Reference has already been made to the
contemplated testing of a new train brake,
invented by George Westioghaui Jr., of
Pittsburgh. An experimental trip has been
made on the Chicago L Northwestern road
and the new brake thoroughly and satis
factonly tested in the presence of a large
number of experienced railroad officers and
practical machinists. The Chicago Railway
Review gives the subjoined account of the
experiment :
The train was twice slopped with the
party on board, and all were astonished that
o sudden a stop under bigo speed could be
made witbout perceptible jar or jerking, or
other inconvenience to the passengers. Its
motion, due to the application of the pow
er equally and contemporaneously to all the
rbeels ot all too cars, can be com
pared to nothing more suggestive than the
motion of a "swing" approaching the ex
tremity of its arc. Having disombarked,tbe
party witnessed two applications of the
brake, the train moving m the first instance
about 32 miles, and in the second instance
(having backed two miles) more than 40
miles per hour. The first time it was stop
ped in 19 seconds, in a distance only 60 feet
greater thun its own length The second
time it came to rest in 18 seconds, in a dis
tance 50 feer more than its length. Con
taining only six day cars, the train was
considerably shorter than arc most of our
express trains with their baggage and long
palace cars.
J he apparatus is, as before described,
rholly under the control of the engineer.
and is applied by a motion similar to that
by which a valve is opened; bnt, though
operating solely from the engine, and dis
pensing with the service of brakemen, it
rorks in connection with tb band Drake, it
these are retained. In the present instance
the entir apparatus is the same that has
been in use daily for several months, on a
train making no fewer than 100 stops per
dav.
John G Saxe, at a Western hotel, the
other day, for some minutes undertook in
vain to carve a piece of beef. The wit laid
down knife and fork, glanced around and
spoke: "Gentlemen," said he, "that's an
infringement on Goodyear's patent."
Tha General Assembly of Kentucky met
yesterday, and elected P. H. Leslie, of Bar
ron county, President. J he uovernor s
message was then read. He takes a cheerful
tiew of the existing condition ef atTairs in
the State, and makes some important recom
mendations. A New York dispatch, says: ''The stock
and gold market were buoyant, but when
the President's Message became known there
was a reaction, especially on account of his
views about specie payments. The stock
market became dull aud drepreseed, and
there was a decline in gold, which rallied af
terward, but closed heavily. The greatest
activity was in Government bonds, which
advanced, under favorable news from Lon
don, bnt subsequently fell off."
The Montgomery (Ala.) Mail of Novem
ber 16, bas the following paragraph : "The
Legislature convened yesterday noon in re
gular session, at 12 o'cloek. All the thieves,
penitentiary convicts, Yankee bummers,
bigamists, barbers and shoemakers were in
their seats. Had there not been present
core of true Alabamians, in the shape of
the little band of Democrats, the concern
might have been mistaken for a lunatic
asylum or a penitentiary. The Assembly
may be generally characterized as low
browed and empty pocketed, tt i sugges
tive of wharf-rats, plug-uglies and snewi
thieves. Tobacco-spittle tricale pown from
the corners of it month; crow-feet radiate
from the contracted eyes, the akin is drawn
tightly over its nose; its breeches are greasy;
it boots are uablacked; it smells of cheese)
tad odor f Ariyue.''
