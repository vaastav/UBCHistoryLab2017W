The Drawback Fkacds?Coming and
Going.?Fresh light is likely to be thrown
npon the drawback frauds by the voluntary
return from Canada of the ex-Deputy Col
lector, Samuel T. Blatchford, who was alleged
to be the principal in the business. Mr.
Blatchford denies that ho was anything but a
scapegoat for other parties. It is fair to the
returning ^oputy to say that his friends have
all along claimed this position for him. What
ever he knows about the frauds he will pro
bably state frankly, as he has given bonds to.
answer any charges preferred against him.
In the meantime It is said that Blatchford's
coming back will result in the sullen going
away of a good many officials, who feel a little
ticklish about his probable revelations; so that
the Marshal may have to fall back upon the
extradition treaty after all.
Spoiling the Game.?Rocbefort was the
antl-climnx of the revolution that started with
such promise in Paris only a few months ago.
lie lus put it down more effectively than the
Emperor could have done with fifty thousand
soldiers, llis very nomination as a Deputy,
his presence as a foremost figure in the agita
tion, warned away the agitators and revolu
tionists by whom something might have been
done. They could not train in -such com
pany without los3 of prestige. If any of our

Two Giants in the Field.?Cardiff is

for sevorai days. By the IIeuald of yester
day w? see tjjat he is al?9 on exhibition in this
city and can be seen for a ITmfted period. We
forbear to distinguish between these giants or
to decide which is the greater of two humbugs.

The President'a Message is before our
readers. Marking a new departure in the
government it is u message of surpassing
importance. As the first full and deliberate
exposition of the views of General Grant,
broadly defining the landmarks of his adminis
tration on our domestic and foreign affairs, we
think it foreshadows in our great soldier our
first statesman of his day. It is the message
of an honest, earnest, clear-headed, practical
man, fully inspired with the grandeur and
glorious destiny of the country; but fully alive
also to the necessities and precautions sug
gested from the present conditions of our
domestic and foreign relations.
Ills opening on the abounding prosperity,
the comprehensive resources and immeasu
rable capabilities of the United StateB, is a
magnificent picture, and well calculated to
inspire universal confidence in the glorious
future of the "great republic." His specifica
tions and suggestions cover a great number of
subjects, which in detail it is needless here to
reproduce. On the leading questions of the
day, however, his opinions and propositions
to Congress are of such importance as to chal
lenge our immediate attention.
First, with regard to Southorn reconstruc
tion, while advocating the admission of Vir
ginia and hopiug that Mississippi and Texas
will como out all right, be recommends that
Georgia be required to say her lesson over
again, inasmuch as she has not conformed to
the terms laid down by Congress and the four
teenth amendment, lie recommends a bill
providing for the meeting of the original re
construction State Legislature of 18CS, includ
ing the negro members turned out by a
majority of the whites of the two houses, and
that they all be held to the oaths enjoined in
the terms of reconstruction, Ac. The bill
already introduced in the Senate will doubtless
be passed without unnecessary loss of time,
and in the interval Georgia may be considered
an outside State. In this business Genoral
Grant simply looks to the execution of the
laws.
On the national finances, pleading for the
funding of the debt at four and a half per cent
interest, and a gradual return to specie pay
ments and a steady extinction of the debt, the
judicious and carefully considered opinions
of the Message will, wo doubt not, command
the general approbation of the country. As
they aro the views, however, of the
Secretary of the Treasury, to which
we have devoted a separate article,
we need not enlarge upon them here.
It is gratifying to see from the Messago that
of all questions that to which General Grant
has given the most thoughtful attention, and
that in which he is most deeply interested, is
the money question and its earliest practicable
settlement, without disturbance, upon a broad
and solid foundation. In connection with the
funding of the debt he suggests the postpone
ment till next session of any general modifica
tions of the tariff or internal tax laws, except
a reduction of the tax oir incomes to three per
cent?a concession to the taxpayers whisk we
expect will be granted.
On Cuba the Message is non-committal,
except in the matter of our international obli
gations, on which it is very clear. It is pro
bable, however, that on this subject the Presi
dent prefers to leave the initiative to Congress,
with which department the question of peace
or war, in all its phases, properly belongs.
Let Congress act, then, and the President will
execute the law.
On the Alabama claims the Messago holds
substantially to the argument of Senator
Sumner's great Bpeech ; but in consequence of
the terrible commotion excited in both coun
tries by that speech, with the indignant rejec
tion by the Senate of the Johnson treaty, nego
tiations have not yet been resumed. The
President is waiting for tho opportunity, which
he thinks is coming, for a satisfactory and
comprehensive settlement.
The Message disapproves tho project of
Canadian reciprocity as a scheme for tho
benefit of the Canadians at tho expense of our
own people and public treasury, which is the !
correct view. The Quakor Indian policy, with j
Indian reservations for those unfortunate
people, is warmly delended; tho repeal of the
Tonuro of Oliice law is urged, and we suspect
it will have to bo ropealed; the movements
entered upon for the survey of the Isthmus of
Daricn, in view of an interocoanic canal, are
referred to; the repor.s of the several execu
tive departments aro drawn upon to show their
operations respectively and their condition;
the monopoly of tho French caMe is opposed,
and all ocean cable monopolies ; an increase
of salaries to certain public servants, including
Justices of the Supremo Court, is recom
mended, and properly, too, and finally, while
relying largely as to their measures of legisla
tion upon the patriotism and wisdom of tho
two houses, the President promises an adher
ence to the laws and their enforcement.
To sum up, on our financial affairs the policy
recommended in the Message is good and 1
soufid; on reconstruction it is (Sonalsteal with
the policy of a uniform application of the
laws; on our foreign relations it is carefully
conservative, perhaps a little too much bo on
tho Cuban question. Hut from drat to la it
there Is nothiug in the Message, excepting tho
Tenure of Office law, calculated to disturb tho
harmony promised between the PrcsiJont and
Congress, unless thero may be some trouble
created in the Senate touching the division of
the spoils. In a word, it is a good business
Message, and indicates a good administration
and peace and prosperity to the country under
President Grant, without panics and with a
steady reduction of the debt aud a quiet return
to specie payments.
Seeing Motes.?The Rev. Mr. Frothing
ham turns as savagely as u pastor may on those
who accuse him of tampering with the right
interests of society. He says that tho greatest
enemies of social order arc his assailants, and
that the true crimo against society is to "judge
in advance of justice" the assassin, seducer, <&c.
Now in this very argument he admits the
whole case against him. He Is the one who
judged hi advance of justice; for by gloss
ing over the act of Richardson he magnified
the crimo of McFarland. And when one
"judges In advance of justice" docB It make
fitly difference whether ho is for or against a
criminal'( Is not the evil result tho same?
The simple question is, then, Who began it ?
The Urnpog mf the Secretary of the Trea
eary.
Secretary Boutwell, ia his oomnmnicatlon
to Congress, takes pride In the large reduction
of the national debt, the details of which have
been already given to the publio in the debt
statement of the 1st inst. The feature of this
portion of the document Is the testimony It
bears to the fidelity with which General Grant
in assuming the administration of the govern
ment has carried out his promises in the mat
ter of the revenue and expenditures of the
nation. During the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1869, the excess of receipts
over expenditures was in round num
bers fifty millions of dollars, three
fourths of which accumulated during the
first four months of his term of ofllco. That is,
General Grant, in ono-third of the yoar, saved
three times as much as the previous adminis
tration did in two-thirds of the year. In other
words, the present administration of the gov
ernment is nine timos as efficient as the pre
vious administration. The receipts for the first
quarter of Vw jurrent fiscal year are already
over twenty-three millions in excess of the
expenditures, and it is estimated that the
excess for the three remaining quarters will be
over seventy millions?making a total saving
of ninety-three millions for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1870. An estimate for
1870-71, based upon the continued operation
of the present laws, promises an exceBS of one
hundred and two millions.
In the matter or a resumption of specie
payments Secretary Boutwell'a position Is wise
and conservative. Ho points out the condi
tions prerequisite to the restoration of our
paper currency to a specie standard. In the
first place he remarks that the ability of the
country to resume will not be due to any spe
cial legislation upon the subjeot, but to the
condition of its industries and to its financial
relations to other countries. Wo must so"
develop these industries that our exports shall
be substantially equal to our imports. In the
next place the diffusion of the curroncy over
tho South in the progress of its recuperation
from the prostration of the war, and to the
Western States and to California, whero paper
is likely to take the place of gold, will tend to
diminish the difference between paper and
coin. He favors a mild policy of contraction,
but touches.the subject with an evident desire
that it may not bo done with any risk of com
mercial disaster. He confesses that the exact
wants of the nation as to the amount of paper
currency are a problem, tho solution of which
bo leaves to be determined when prior and more
important Issues have been settled. He only
favors contraction because he Inclines to
the belief that the volume of the cur
rency, with a restoration of specie pay
ments, is more than sufficient for
the business requirements of the country.
He also deems it unwise to resume while so
largo a portion of the national dobt is held
abroad by European merchants and bankers,
whose investment in our national securities
has been speculative and temporary and not
permanent. Auy sudden appreciation in the
value of government securities would only
induce thoir reshipment to secure the profits
of the rise. On the other hand, a steady pro- I
I gress to specie payments, while rendering the
foundation of the uational credit more stabla,
would tend to render these foreign invest
| menfs permanent and prevent the danger
! of a panic such aa occurred In Europe in I860,
when upon the outbreak ot the Austro-Prus
I sian war there was a general sending home
of the different national bonds. He desires
that when the country does resume there shall
be no backsliding into suspension. In fine, in
the language of tis report, the practical ques
tion is not merely the resumption of specie
payment as a measure by itself, but the pro
blem is to resume under such circumstances
that the position can be maintained, not only
ia times of tranquillity, but alBO in periods of
excitement and peril. In discussing the
details whioh are to assist in paving the way
for resumption he dwells upon the necessity
for taking steps to revive and develop
our commercial marine, and ingeniously
proves the Important part which the
extent of our shipping interests play in modi
fying the balance of our foreign trade. The
voyage of every American vessel is a bill of
exchange in our favor.
In funding the national dobt Secretary
Boutwell thinks It will bo necessary to
doal with the five-twenties only, and with
$<1,200,000,000 only of ti.e whole loan afloat of
this class. He rccommends that tho new bonds
bo divided into three loans of $400,000,000
each, the first redeemable in fifteen to
twenty years, the second In twenty to twenty
five years and the third in twenty-five to thirty
years; that the principal and interest be made
payable in coin expressly; that the live
twenties shall bo receivod in exchange for
them; that tho rate of Interest shall not
exceed four and one-half per cent; that the
interest shall be payable In European cities
as the subscribers to the loan may clect, and
finally that the new bonds shall be exempt
frotu all taxation. It is doubtful whether
tho lant condition w"! JPSJV
popular sanction, inasmuch as the public
tendency is to exact an equal distribution of
the burden of taxation. In alluding to the
evils of the natioual banking system it points
out tho unjust discrimination which those insti
tutions make In lending their funds on pledge
of stocks In preference to accommodating tho
merchants, thus fostering speculation at the
expense of legitimate business, and suggests
tho remedy. Tho report is otherwise full and
detailed in recommendations tributary to tho
main features above sketched.
| A Ccban Pbimsb fob CoKqkess.?An excel
lent idea of the Cuban Junta Is that of laying
on the desk of every member of Congress a
miniature map of tho island of Cuba, contain
ing on its margin the length, brcadtfc, square
miles and number of acres in the Island; Its
exports, imports, population, and so forth,
j With this primer In his hand every member
can "speak by tho book" about Cuba, many of
whom probably have never studied the geog
raphy or resources of the island. This will
save time In the discussion of tho Important
1 question, and may cut many long Bpeechos
short, as every man will be his own instructor.
If this plan of education for members of Con
gress were adopted in other cases It would
[ save a great doal of tlmo. It is an excellent
I short cut to knowledge.
The Charter Blccttea ToDu>
The great and protracted excitement which
marked the entire charter election campaign
of 1869 will have its culmination and its close
to-night. There are many interests and con
siderations involved in the Aldermanic con
test that have been either overlooked by the
majority of the citizens or else have not
attracted the amount of attention which they
deserved. With the ohange in the political
supremacy of the city and State, the result of
the November election, a new era of restored
power dawns upon the Councilmanic Board.
This body will again be called upon to act
in concert with the Mayor In all munioipal
appointments to the heads of Buch bureaus
and commissions, the creation of republican
legislation, as may for another year be per
mitted to stand. But at all events, with the
chartered rights of the city so long wrested
from it restored, the Councilmanic body will
be once more olothed with its old prerogatives
as a power in the city government. It must
be a matter of regret that the thorough defeat
of the republican party in the late State elec
tion seems to have been accepted as a coup
de grace from which it could not even rally to
contest a sin<rle Aldermanic ward in the city
with the slightest prospect of success. Con
sequently tho citizens have but "Hobson's
choice" in the election to-day?to take the
Tammany candidates as they como?a rather
disagreeable alternative, no doubt, but still
the only one.
In the contcst for Civil and Police Justices
there has been a wider field for selection open.
The Tammany candidates, whether those
renominated or those nominated for the first
time for either Civil or Police Justice, possess
all the necessary qualifications for the office.
The election is not entirely confined to those
nominees, however, as thero are in two or
three districts independent democratic candi
dates running. In only one, tho Ninth (a new
district), the candidate is one not seeking
re-election, but comes for the first time before
the residents of his district as a candidate for
the office. Captain Wiley, however, is so
popular with all classes that he enters with
perfect confidence into tho struggle, and, with
an honest canvass of the votes polled, he has
no fears for the result to-night.
The candidates for School Trustees are, as
in the ca3e ot the Aldermanic candidates,
almost all Tammany men. It is, therefore,
needless now to reiterate our oft repeated
warning to the citizens to be up and doing
in the election so far as tho candidacy for
School Trustees was concerned. The general
apathy that prevailed as to party opposition
in regard to the other offices has had its
influence here, where even all political feel
ings should have been thrown aside, and
none but reliable and competent men put
forward.
It may be said that the charter election
for 18G9 goes to the winning men by default,
arising from the supposed uselessness on the
part of the republicans and outside organi
zations to contest it, and through apathy on
the part of the people themselves, who seem,
for the present at all events, to have confided
their whole political ozistence to the hands
of the Tammany leaders.
The RlcUardaon-MoFarland Tra?edy?Public
Opinion.
Public opinion is sometimes raBh, often jner
cileds, but in the long run it is almost always
just. In this case it has taken its usual course.
It was rash; it was somewhat merciless in its
first outburst; but it is now settling down, and
as it settles down we feel that it is coming
nearer and nearer to truth and justice. From
all quarters and among all ranks and classes
of the people the sentiment which is loudly and
emphatically expressed is the same. We are
forgetting Richardson, ignoring his female
friend, and willingly leaving McFarland In the
hands of tho law. Our attention is being more
and more concentrated on principles, and on
that class of principles to which mainly this
crime is to be traced. In public estimation
this marriage is as much to bo condemned as
the murder. Mr. Beccher and Mr. Frothlng
ham have both been heard in explanation of
their conduct in the matter; but it is only
truth to say that their explanations Lavo been
bo feeble that public opinion Is down upon
them more than ever. It is our confident
opinion that before thin affair is finally settled
theBeechers, the Frothinghams, the Greeleys,
the Calhouns and the rest will bo heartily
aBhamed of themselves. From tho clergymen,
particularly If they have been deceived, we
shall expect an open, hone3t and full confes
slon. We shall not be the laa? to forgive, but
for the present wo hold thorn largely to blame.
It is time that the dangorous "isms" of New
England were put down. This sad affair may
tend to open some dark eyes. . ?
The Work at IIell Gate.?Professor
Maillefert reports fair progress on his portion
of tho work In clearing the Hell Gato channel.
He has boon laboring with nitro-glycnrine,
and gunpowder, and divers, and scow
grapplers since last August on Tray's Roof,
Shelldrake and Pot rocks, with the following
results:?When lie commenced operations there
was only a vlipiS of ^joiyo and a half feet of
water at low tide on Tray's Reef. Uow ihofC
is an average depth of twenty feet. On
Shelldrake rock the channel lias boon Increased
from a depth of sixteen to iwonty-nine feet.
From the d brla of rock blown up by four
hundred discharges of nltro-glycerino It
appaars that forty scowloads, containing forty
five cubic yards each, have been successfully
grappled and carried off to be appropriated to
building docks and piers. This is not a bad
show for loss than five months' work. If the
other operations progress in tho same ratio
we need not despair of seeiug llell Gate clear
one of these days.
The Soranton Coal TJompanv in tfie
Way.?The last auction sale of Scranton coal
put the price down a little. Large orders
received at the mines in Pennsylvania pre
vious to that sale were countermanded imme
diately after It, and the organ of the miners
cries out for some "power under tho laws" to
stop such sales, so that the price may bo kept
up. Was ever the power of law invoked moro
crookcdly than this ? The great combination
to keep up tho price of coal wants (o punish
those who stand in its way. This Is no ii tho
thieves and rogute if all sorts should appeal
to tho law to proveut the police and honest
I men interfering with then! in tbelr vocations.
Second SMrion of the Forty-flm Ceegreee.
Yesterday the Forty-first Congress met,
organized, listened to the reading of the Presi
dent's Message, and entered promptly and
vigorously on the labors of its second session.
In the Senate the pressure of publio sentiment
in regard to certain urgent questions of import
ance wa8 indicated by the character of the
bills, joint resolutions and petitions which wero
offered at this early date. Prominent among
these were the petition from thirty thousand
citizens of Philadelphia praying Congress to
recognize the independence of the republic of
Cuba and to accord to it the rights of a bel
ligerent Power; the bills of Mr. Drake and of
Mr. Sumner with reference to the further defin
ing and regulating the jurisdiction and powers
of the courts of the United States; the bills of
Mr. Williams for the improvement of Oregon,
the establishment of a telegraph line from the
Columbia river to Great Salt Lake, and the
regulation of Chineso immigration; the bill to
relieve and removo tho political disabilities of
certain persons in Alabama; the joint resolu
tion for the relief of persons engaged in the
lato rebellion, and, particularly, tho bill or
Mr. Morton to provide for the reconstruction
of the State of Georgia by convening the
old State Legislature, with the conditions
that no person shall be admitted to
membership who is disqualified under the
fourteenth amendment, or excluded therefrom
on acoount of race or color, and then that IT
the Legislature thus organized shall ratify the
fifteenth amendment the State shalf be ad
mitted to representation to Congress?a bill
which corresponds so nearly to similar recom
mendations in the President's Message that
it very probably will bo passed; the bill
providing for the execution of the laws against
the crime of polygamy in the Territory
of Utah; the bill for establishing an ocean
mail Bervice between the United States,
Mexico and Central America, and the resolu
tion requesting the President for information
about tho presence of Governor William
McDougall at Pembina in Dacotah Territory,
and the opposition of the inhabitants of the
Selkirk settlement to his assuming the Gov
ernorship of the Northwest Territory, said
to have been lately transferred by the
Hudson Bay Company to the Dominion of
Canada. The bill of Mr. Sumner in reference
to the appellate jurisdiction of the Unite I
States Supreme Court, in causes or proceed
ings commenced by the writ of habeas corpus,
is manifestly designed to meet such special
case as that of Yerger; but the bill proposed
by Mr. Drake is of a far more Bweeping
character, and is so generally regarded as a
direct attempt to break down the judiciary
that it will doubtless meet with strenuous
opposition.
Among the bills and resolutions offered in
the House of Representatives tho most note
worthy were a bill providing for taking the
ninth census; for fixing the number of the mem
bers of the House and for their future
apportionment among the several States, and
a joint resolution declaring Virginia enti
tled to representation in Congress. Notice
was also given of a bill to prevent the appoint
ment of members of Congress to any place
of trust and profit under government. Oa
the whole the first day of tho second session
of the Forty-first Congress was a very busy
day, and a wide field for work was laid out for
the legislative plough.
A Cavalry General on a Whiskey Raid.?
There has been no better arranged or more
effective movement for enforcing the revenue
laws than tho sudden onslaught on the group
of illicit stills at Irishtown, in Brooklyn?a
move that owes its origin and discreet conduct
to General Pleasanton, now of the revenue
service and formerly commander of the cavalry
in the Army of the Potomao. The way in
which a man performs his duty, whatever bo
his post, is the best testimony to bis qualities,
and in the secrecy, the suddenness, the good
temper and complete results of this operation
we recognize in civil office the same acutenesa,
vim and dash that distinguished the General as
a commander of cavalry.
A "Bull Ron" in Earnest.?One of the
correspondents of the London Timet has been
prohibited from entering the Papal Slates.
We presume bo was commissioned to write
about the Ecumenical Council. This action
of the Pope throws "Bull Run" Russell com
pletely in the shade, for the gentleman now
aggrieved Ts run off by an original, genuine
Bull of the real old stock, whereas Mr. Russell,
in the moments of his very highest elevation,
only ran before the Black Horse cavalry of
Virginia. "Bull Run" Russell loses his tonsure
and consecration. He had them morely from
I Lie hands of the lato President Lincoln. The
"other man" of the London Times is ordained
by Pius the Ninth.
Beeoiier and Plymouth Ciiuboh.?For
tho sake of the exchequer of Plymouth church
it is the groatest of pities that the scats are
not for sale just now. If this were the time
for selling the choice places in that temple of
the Gospel they would no doubt fetch double
the ordinary price, for no sensation that
Beecher has dabbled in was ever more effec
tive than this Richardson-McFarland flurry.
Wh$ say th&i ioechet has blundered,
that he has "pui ?.'a into it," <fcc., do not
understand that clerical tumbler. It is tho
greatest success of his life, the most piquant
of all his ventures on the desperate edgo of
ministerial propriety.
One Van Dusen will glvo fifty thousand
dollars towards the organization of a vigilance
committee, and this proves that tho desperate
minded citizen is blind as a mole to the real
cause of all our trouble. Oh, Van Dusenl all
the mischief is due to money. It is because
the plunder of the city is so stupendous that
corruption and misgovernment are so great,
and now you want to add your little fifty thou
sand dollars to tho difficulty. Do you not know
that the rogues of this town will organize ?
vigilance committee merely to get the money
you offer and hnng you as the first rogue with
a rope purchased at your own expenso ?
MASONIC BALL
Tho second annual reception and ball of the Man
hattan Chapter, No. 184, R, A. M., took placo last
evening at tho Apollo Rooms, turner o! Twenty
elgfttb street and Broad war. Tbe affair was a very
enjoyable one, and notwithstanding the snow storm
there was a large attendance of ladles and gentle
men. Dancing was begun about nine o'clock ant
was kept up until tlM wee hours of the morniug.
