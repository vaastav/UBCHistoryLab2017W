Poirr Towwukjto, Dec. i.—{Special.}—The
barkentine K trkuat, Capt. B. D. Cutler,
arrived today from Honolulu with ad tires
to November four days after the
•learner Alameda sailed for San Francisco.
Minister Willis submitted to an interview
directly after tbe Alameda ealled, and
plainly told the people that tbe instruc
tions trom tbe United States government
which be brought out from Washington
City were not applicable to tbe condition
of affairs then existing in tbe islands.
This statement gave tbe annexationists
mucb satisfaction and the royaiista were
much nispleaaed. On account of many
rumors current of thecontempiatea action
of the queen's supporters the provisional
government found it necessary to keep
two companies of soldiers under arms sev
eral nights after the Alameda sailed.
The dispatch published in a New Zea
land newspaper to tbe effect that Presi
dent Cleveland was preparing to submit a
message to congress advocating restora
tion of the monarchy in Hawaii created
much eicitement. The editor of the
firming Star requested Minister Willi* to
submit a statement to the public to allay
the general feeling of uncertainty. He.
■aid: "Yes, I believe the time has come
in which it la rirht and proper for me to
use my discretion in this matter. Yon are
nuthoriced to say for me that no change in
the present situation will take place for
several weeks. I broupht with me certain
instructions from the I'nited States gov
ernment on the Hawaiian situation. Hmce
my arrival contingencies have arisen about
which neither the I'nited States govern
ment nor myself were aware when I left
Washington City. I have thought best in
the eiercise of the discretion allowed me,
to submit these matters to Washington
City before proceeding further in carry
ing out my original Instructions. 1 for
ward my dispatches to Washington City
by today's steamer, and until I receive an
answer to them no change will take place
in the present situation, nor will any be
allowed."
"What do yon mean by the expression,
"Nor will any be allowed ?' "
"I mean just this: That until the time
comes for nie to carry oat my instructions,
the peace and good order of this commu
nity will be kept undisturbed, in the inter
ests of humanity; that any attempt made
by any j>erson or persons to make trouble
will be promptly checked and punished.
You may put the matter more plainly and
aay that even if the provisional govern
ment diacharged the whole of its troops
today, no lawlessness would be allowed
for one moment under the present situa
tion of affairs. The whole Hawaiian ques
tion is now In abeyance, and nothing that
the newspapers can say or do will alter the
situation one iota. I make thia statement
on my own responsibility and in the hope
that it will allay the present excitement.
No one need fear trouble and no lawless
ness will be permitted."
This statement gave general satisfaction
to the annexationist* and brought forth
much grumbling from tbe royalists, nnd
immediately rumors began to fly about
that the queen's supporters would make a
final rally ia her behalf. Two companies
of troops remained under arms and the
crews of the Vnited States men-of-war
Philadelphia and Adams were held in
readiness to he landsd if any movement
were attempted.
The queen's advocates came forth the
next day with a redhot denial of the Wil
lia interview, saying he was misquoted,
and by inference gave encouragement to
the idea that Willis had or would have
imperative orders to restore the queen.
CapL Cutler, of the Klickitat, who has
sailed to the islands for the last twenty
years and is |*ersonatly acquainted with
leading citizens of both factions, says a
large majority of the better element
strongly favor annexation, but if left to
popular vote the natives and the foreign
element would outvote the annexationists.
K«fip*p»r accounts of ttlount's report
hod tint Iwen received in the islands when
tha Klickitat sailed, but on account of
Willis' intimation relative to his instruc
tions It ww surmised to be partial to tha
interests of the queen. Cutler said the
general sentiment prevailed that Hluunt's
report would be htasevi and unfair, inas
much as h« trained and hobnoid>ed with
the royalist crowd. The natives of Ha
waii agree that tfie queen Is an immoral
woman ami unlit to govern the islands,
and the pilncipal objection offered by the
royalists to the provisional government,
Cutler save. Is the manner in which it w.\a
installed. They want the I tiited States to
rotor* the queen and then allow them to
change the lorm of government if they
choose Jhe captaiu says no further
trouble need lx> anticipated until Willis
hss further instructions from Washington
City,
