houiu Te-rltory
Guthrie. O. T., Dec 7. (Special.)
At a meeting of the Inter-State Associa
tion of Livestock Sanitary commission
at St. Louis on December 2 and 3. It W3S
recommended to the secretary of agri
culture that the quarantine regulations
for 1S9S become effective on January 15
instead of February 15, as heretofore,
and the time of closing Is to foe the
Fame, November 15. It was also recom
mended that -the Wichita Indian reser
vation be placed wholly, below the line.
"While it Is not known positively that
this recommendation will (be followed,
yet it is presumed tha't it will, as the
secretary has expressed himself as likely
to be govraed largely by them. All of
Arkansas and a major part of Tennes
see is placed below the -line. This nvas
considered necessary after hearing the
report of the government experts who
have for months been investigating the
condition of those localities. It was
claimed by A. J. Edwards, secretary of
Oklahoma's commission, that these
states were the source of a great deal
of infeotion during the past season and
hence the stockmen of the territory are
to be congratulated upon this move.
A desperate effort was made to put Can
adian and Kingfisher counties blow the
line 'but on a showing by the commission1
that what little fever was ifound there
last year had now been completely erad
icated and the localities disinfected, the
line -was permitted -to" remain as it was.
With the above exceptions and changes,
the same line as last year was recom
mended. Feeders and stockmen- -will do
well to act upon the above recommen
dation as it is quite likely to be adopted.

comes more -twisted in the petition filed t
Saturday by Mr. Kent asking for the '
appointment of a receiver and for dam-
ages against the other partners of the

tle, "W. "W. Wheeler, Joshua Motter and
Francis A. Dameron, the last four doing
busines-3 under the firm name and style
o' Tootle, Wheeler Motter.
The petition states that Kent placed
in the -partnership a stock of goods
valued at 5S.000 and the other memfoers
of the firm were to put in $500 each in
cash; the latter to pay Kent 7 per cent
on 54,000; Kent to receive 50 per cent
of the profits, the other two 25 jer cent
each. McPhee -was to give -his time to
the business at $75 per month. Neither
of the defendants contributed the agreed

in cash to start thp business. The plaint
iff and McPhee have given their ser
vices and have been paid with the ex
ception of $75 due Mr. Kent. The plaint
iff alleges that he has contributed to the
besiness $9,727 and drawn out $1,149; a
balance due him of $S,59S. The sales of
the concern averaged about $100 per cay
and for uhe week prior to the closing
' $146 per day. The total indebtedness
of the firm is $4,300, of which only $500
is due, -fhere being sufficient funds to
meet that amount. The stock is esti-
J mated, in the -petition, to be worth

defraud the plaintiff.
To prove 2iis allegations he states the
following: On November 15. the de
fendants approached the plaintiff pro
posing to buy him out, offering their
j unsecured notes, -which Kent refused.
The defendants then demanded $1,000
each for their interests slating that they
had letters in their possession which if
published would ruin Kent socially and
financially and that he was beinc,
watched and that officers wocld arrest
him.

was at dinner, the defendants executed

JUST WASTE PAPER
HANNIS TAYLOR VENTILATES THE
AUTONOMY SHAM.
Also the President's Message, Which He
Denounces as "Heartless and Se'flih"
and as the Virtual Announcement of a
"Deliberate Conspiracy" Actonomr
Not ..Constitutionally Enacted, Henca
Not Binding Governor General Is Su
preme In Cuba, and Effectual Legisla
tion Is Nut to be Dreamed of.
Mobile, Ala., Dec. 7. Ex-Minister to
Spain Honorable Hannis Taylor, gives
out the following:
"The Associated Press has requested
me to express my views as to that part
of the president's message which re
lates to -the Cuban question. Putting
aside the irrelevant matter toy which it
is encumbered, the substance of the only
recommendation made by the executive
to congress upon that subject is that
this government cannot venture to do
anything to put an end to the inhuman
strife, which during the last three years
'has reduced the island almost to a des
ert, -because there i3 a prospect of a set
tlement between the comibatants upon
the basis of a so-called plan of auton
omy lately put forth "by the Sagasta
ministry. I believe congress should
firmly and scornfully reject such a pol
icy of Irresolution and non-action, be
cause the assumption upon which it is
founded is an empty illuznon.
NOT LEGALLY EXACTED.
The -vital question at issue has not
been touched 'by the revolutionary ef
fort of Sagasta to end the war by means
of a craftily incomplete proposition that
carries with it no constitutional guar
antee whatever. All who are familiar
-with Spanish legislation know that a
valid grant of an autonomous colonial
system that involves not only the repeal
-f1; " " ", T .,:.. Tt-
SSTjSSli
national revenue of
P TegSftuxe cannot
be? made exceit by an act passed by
Joth houses of the Cortes and approved
b Q cueen resent. Tne effort just
- - .7. . - ,aa
! made to secure that result by a mere
royal decree, unsupported by parliamen
tary action, has, therefore, been justly
denied by, Romero Rdbledo, late minis
ter of justice, as a purely revolutionary
proceeding in defiance of the legisla
ture. PREVIOUS PRETENSES..
"Only one law looking to home rule
in Cuba has ever been enacted, the Ab
azuza ianv of 1895, which passed both
houses of the Cortes unanimously be
cause It was utterly worthless. Two
years later, when Canova-3 was forced to
put forth a scheme for home rule, he
reaDlved to make it apparently genuine
upon its face, and for that reason he
Tvell knew the Cortes would never en
act it Into law. Under such circumstan
ces he invented an expedient for cir
cumventing the legislature fry assuming
that the en-tire legislative power of the
Spanish kingdom is vested in the crown
I alone.
I "Sagasta, confronted by tfhe same dif
ficulty, has. In 'like manner, resorted to
the unconstitutional attempt to legislate
j by royal decree.
"Knowing the nation is against him,
he does not dare to state his proposals
clearly upon the matter in question, and
It is certain that if he should assert
h5? tacoiDljflte scheme to the pres-
ent Cortes it woud be either rejected
entirely or so amended as to deprive it
of all vitality. Until the Sagasta plan
(has first been enacted into law by the
Cortes, it cannot rise 'to the dignity of
a proposal. From a legal, constitutional
point of view, it is only so much waste
paper.
"In one particular, the cabinets at
Madrid and Washington are in identi
cally the same situation. Both are striv
ing -with all their might either to defy
or circumvent the national will as em
bodied in their respective legislatures.
THE AUTOCRAT OF CUBA.
"But even if the Sagasta plan pos
sessed constitutional validity, a careful
inspection of Its artful terms must re
veal the fact that, like the pretentious
sham put forth by Canovas, it contains
cardinal provisos that would enable the
home government to reduce the whole
scheme at any moment to zero. The au
tocrat of Cuba has ever been the governor-general,
and the present plan con
templates his continuance as such, with
full power to cru?h by veto any and
every act ot tne coioniai legislature.
The following are the terms of the pro
vision in question: "The supreme au
thority shall be vested in the governor
general, acting for the crown, to which
he daall swear allegiance. As represen
tative of the home government he shall
have command of the military forces
and shall act as delegate of the depart
ments of state, war, navy, and the col
onies. He is empowered to suspend the
publication of national laws should he
deenPsuch publication inadvi?able. As
executive, of the insular government, it
shall be his duty to sanction and pro
claim the colonial statutes. Should he
consider an enactment of the insular
parliament liable to endanger the na
tional -legislation of Spain's sovereign
interests In the colony, he is authorized
to forward said enactment before its
approval, to the council of ministers of
Lie kingdom, who will decide wirhin two
months. Should the home government
fail to decide within the above specified
time, the governor-general shall sanc
tion and proclaim the act of insular
parliament.'
"In plain language, the governor-general
can destroy any act of the insular
parliament by refusing to 'sanction and
proclaim' it; he can have it destroyed
oy the ministry at -Madrid, of which he
is the mer& agent.
"The fact that the members- of such
an impotent assembly are- -to be elected
is of no importance whatever.
PROBLEM IS ECONOMIC.
"I have attempted to demonstrate else
where that the primary cause of the
endless conflict is economic; and that
difficulty can never be removed -until
Cuba Is independent or possessed of an
absolutely her own tariffs. Nothing
could be more disiagenloos than the de
vice employed to obscure the fact that
no such concession is contemplated. A
Cuban parliament is to be given .the
power to form -its own tariff, fixing both
import and export duties, provided the
assent of -ch home government can be
obtained thereto. In case of a disagree
ment, 'the point in dispute shall be sub
mitted to a committee of cnembers of 1
the Cortes, consisting of Jin equal num
ber of peninsulars and Cubans.' Every
body knows the Cuban deputies in the
Cortes at Madrid are mere men of straw
returned by the governor-general Even
if they were independent no change
could ever be made in existing -tariffs
without the consent of the peninsular
Spaniards, who would never listen to
such a thing.
FAILURE CONFESSED.
"At the end of three years of whole
sale destruction, provoked by Spain,
through unprecedented political and eco
nomic oppression that has brought death
and famine to hundreds of thousands,
the Spanish crown has at last confessed
that the Cubans are 'right and that their
wrongs ehould now be redressed by a gen
erous and genuine grant of home rule.
When the professed scheme Is examined
it is found to be not only indefinite and
illegal, but absolutely wanting in sincer
ity upon the two vital points at Issue.
Such proposal has 'oeen extorted by the
result of a struggle that has so com
pletely broken the military and financial
power of Spain that a, onquest of the
island is now hopeless. After expending
three hundred millions of dollars and af
ter sending over the sea 300,000 soldiers,
Spain has a fighting force in the island
of less than 70,000, while the revolution
ary army, now in possession of the great
er part of the country, numbers about
50.000.
"Who has the right to say that the he
roic men who have maintained in the
menlguas of Cuba such a conflict against
such odds are not capable of self-government?
Who will say that all the fneits
that they have won through death by
sword and famine should in the hour of
victory be surrendered for,, an empty
sham, which means only new bondage
under their old and pitilesj oppressors?
"THIS HEARTLESS MESSAGE."
"And yet this heartless) 6elfish mes
sage ha3 not one word of encourase
ment or sympathy for this suffering peo
ple, now dying and starving by thou
sands at our very doors: In it they are
contemptuously denominated as no bet
ter than their persecutors.
"Fortunately for fae honor of this
generous, Christian nation, "this message
with cool and serene cynicism admits
that it oes not represent the sentiments
of the Amreican people as expressed by
congress a year ago in the joint resolu
tion in whioh both houses declared that
a state of war did exist in Cuba and
that it should be so recognized by this
government. Congress la politely told
to attend to its own business; that If the
recognition of belligerency should be
come necessary in the future, the execu
tive power will act without congressional
interference.
DELIBERATE CONSPIRACY.
"It is generally understood that this
deliberate conspiracy to thwart the will
of the nation is to be carried out through,!
an appeal to the speaker of the house of
representatives, who is expected 'to so
manipulate its rules as to prevent the
passage of the pending belligerency reso
lution, which the senate has already ap
proved. In othr words, the tyranny of
the speakership in tiie hot&s- is to be so
used in behalf of Spanish tyramiy In Cu
ba as to prevent any expression what
ever of sympathy with, or recognition of,
a government whose status has within
the last few days been described as fol
lows:
" 'Washington, Dec 3. Consul General
Lee has informed the state department
that the insurgents in Cuba elected and
installed at Yaza, Porto Principe, on Oc
tober 23, the following officers:
" 'President, Bartolo Masso; vice pres
ident, Domingo Mendez Capote; secre
tary of war, Jose B. Aleman; secretary
of the treasury, Eames'to Font Stearling
secretary of foreign affairs, Andreas Mo
reno De La Torre; secretary of the in
terior, Manuel R. Sllva; general in chief,
Maximo Gomez; lieutenant general, Ca
lixto Garcia.'
UNDER REED'S THUMB.
"The house of representatives is either
to be muzzled or called upon to declare
that this revolutionary movement, which
has virtually crushed the power of Spain
in Cuba, has no suoh de facto existence
as will authorize a recognftion of war be
tween the contending parties. That ab
surd contention becomes the more gro
tesque when we remember that Spain
has expended without effect against
such revolutionary government far more
money and men than Great Britain em
ployed during our entire Revolutionary
war.
LIMITS TO PATIENCE.
"There are limits even to the patience
of the American people; and the time has
now come when the executive power
should be made to feel through public
demonstration that the nation will no
longer permit its sovereign will in a
righteous cause to be entirely set aside
in the Interest of a tremulous, selfish,
short-sighted policy. The whole con
test now centers in tiie passage of the
belligerency resolution, pending in the
house. If that cannot be carried, then
nothing whatever can be done to end a
strife that has been going on for fifteen
years out of the last twenty-five, and
wnich, after destroying our commerce
with the island, has become a war cloud
that today obscures every business en
terprise. If the present administration
proposes to Indefinitely pDstpone such un
certainty a': the cost of every business
Interest, it must '?e prepared to .accept
the consequences.
"At this last stage of the struggle,
there can hardly be a doub: that if bel
ligerency should be recognized within
three months, the insurgents would be
so domran: ha the island that the war
cloud would shortly be ended by the rec
ognition of Cuban Independence. Those
who are best informed firmly bll-sve
that without one word of aid or sympa
thy from us that result will be attained
within twelve or eighteen months. If
bungling diplomacy shall permit such an
event, the actuation may assume a seri
ous form that few ceem to contemplate.
CUBAN WORM MAY TURN.
"If we scorn and spit upon the Cabana
uncil vjevory and independence are won
without aid or comfort from us, 7?hy
should they not turn to one or other of
the great maritime powers that will then
be only too eager to supply ail their
wants and to enter into che closest rela-J
rioas with them? We have for a long
time declared that no European power
other tiian Spain shall ever possess Cuba.
We may so blander as :o be forced to
maintain that contention ac the point of
the sword. Out of such difficulties, the
vay is now clear and ezsy. Let the
pending belligerency resolution be
promptly passed by the house and

HORRIBLE LYNCHING IN NEVADA
Adam Tjber la Dragged Naked to the Place
of illsExecatloa
Carson, Nevada, Dec 7. One of tb
most horrible lynchlngs ever known In
Nevada occurred at Genoa, fourteen
miles from here, at 2 o'clock this morn
ing. Adam Uber, who last week shot
and killed Hans Anderson in a Miller
ville saloon, -was hanged by a mob of
masked men to a cottonwood tree half
a mile distant from the jail. When tak
en from his cell the victim had nothing
on but a shirt, his was 'torn off by the
lynchers and the nude body left hanging
In the air for nearly six hours. As the
body was being pulled up the mob rid
dled It with bullets. When satisfied that
the man was dead the vigilantes dis
persed and returned to their homes.
At the hour above mentioned the lead
er of the mob presented himself at the
side window of the county jail, and call
ing to Sheriff BrocklJss, stated that the
Gardnerville constable had arrived with
a prisoner he wished to have lockied up.
The sheriff, was some time -In responding,
and the mob, impatient at the delay,
battered down -the door of the recorder's
office with sledge hammers, captured the
sheriff and constable and placed them
under guard. The prisoner was then
awakened. He fought with a chair, but
was soon overpowered. He cried for mer
cy but was 6llenced wJfth a gag, and after
being bound was dragged through the
streets out of the city, and to a -place a
half mile distant, where the mob halted.
The sheriff and constable were farced to
accompany the -mob, and, still under a
strong guard, watched the execution.
The prisoner was in a fair way of re
ceiving trial and punishment 'for the
crime he had committed. The. prelimin
ary examination was held last week and
the grand jury had found an indictment.
A number of witnesses would hajve been
brought forward to-prove that Uber had
been assaulted "by Anderaou before, the

teacher In the territory who "has the good
of his profession at heart will be pres
ent If possible, and It is thought there
will "be between 600 and 700 In the con
vention. Already many of the best
rooms at the Kerfoot and. Caddo hotel3
in El Reno have been taken by those
who expect to attend, and the only fear
now is that it will be difficult to find
entertainment for the large number of
guests. Mr. Boyd says very great Inter
est is being taken in the meeting by
teachers all over the territory, the Inter
est being phenomenal, in fact.
The Oklahoma School Herald pub
lished a very handsome and complete
program of the exercises last week and
sent a copy to every teacher in the ter
ritory whose name cocld be learned. It
gave rates at Bhe hotels (which have
been materially reduced for the occa
sion) and all other nece?sary informa
tion. The railroads have also given re
duced rates.

Guthrie. O. T., Dec. 7. 1S57.
Amos A Ewlng. Inspector, Guthrie, O. T.
Dear Sir: You are respectfully ad
vf??d that the act approved March Eth,
1S35, creating the office of inspector of
oils and burning fluids and prescribing
his duties, was an act -tended for the
protection of the public against frauds
and imposition, and to give notice at the
time of tne purchase of the- character
of the oils cr burning fluids purchased.

safeguards erooad the traalc.,arid' pre
scribe the conditions at the sale., bat is
intended to prohibit the sale of & or.;
fluids that flash when a well lighted
match is applied at a less temperature

the sale of rejected oils under -the con
ditions prescribed in said section by pro
ceedings lccfcdng to the forfeiture, yet it
is equally c!ear that in no case shaJl
"rejected" oils be sold by any dealer
within the territory, because the prohi
bition and penalty applies to any per
son, manufacturer or dealer who does so.
It fa the putrse of the law to prevent j
the sale of oils that are dangerous to.
life or limb, or. in other -words, to re
duce the danger of the -use of such ofts
as are inherently dangerous, to the rrjn
imum. "When oils have once been Insreoted
and branded "Approved Standard Oil,"
no further Inspection Is necessary. It
i meant by this that the Inspection may
be made of the oils whlle in "tyie tanks,
barrels or other packages in Thidh they
have been transmitted vrithlnr our terri
tory. A regulation by the inspector that ail
oils should be inspeoted In the original
tanks or barrels, is a ceascAiable one anw
necessary for 'ffiie propep enforcement
of the la-w So ak3 is a regulation pro
hibiting dealers from transferring oils
from barrels or tank fine cars to storage
tanks, until the same has been in
spected. Oils rejected can only be disposed of
afe provided in Sections, Chap-rer 36 of
the acts of 1S&3, by forfeiture proceed
ings. I am dearly of the opinion that the
sale of "rejected" oils within the terri
tory of Oklahoma by merchants or
agents representing oil companies, is for
bidden by both a fair construction of the
letter, and by "the spirit of the law.
Very respectfully,
HARPER S. CUNNINGHAM.
