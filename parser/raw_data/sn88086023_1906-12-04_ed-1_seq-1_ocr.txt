Their Prosperity With Employes in

Chicago, Dec. 4. The National In
dustrlal association was addressed to
day by J. W. Vancleve, president of
the National Association of Matiufac
tuiers. Ho pleaded for fair play on
the part of both operator and opera

Schmltz and Ruef and said:
"The causes for the creation of the
movement these men typify Is rested
in autocratic and unjust employers
who go fur as they can without vio
lating the statutes, and always hold
a hostile attitude toward labor.
Trades union autocrats also exist.
The good employer and well be.

I mc oppressive employer is a worse
enemy to society than the deniagogu-

WITH
EMPLOYERS
ROOSEVELT TO FIFTY-NINTH CONGRESS
Washington, Dec. 4. President
Roosevelt's message to congress, one
of the best yet written by him, was
presented this ufternoon and caused
widespread comment because of some
of the radical recommendations made
in It.
The message contains 25,000 words
and touches upon every public Issue
before the nation. A synopsis of the
leading topics is as follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: As a nation we still continue to en
Joy a literally unprecedented prosper
ity; and It Is probable that only reck
less speculation and disregard of le
gitimate business methods on the part
of the business world can materially
mar this prosperity. "
No congress In our time has done
more good work cf Importance than
the present congress. There were sev
eral matters left unfinished at your
Inst session, however, which I most
earnestly hope you will complete be
fore your adjournment.
No Campaign Contributions.
I again recommend a law prohibit
ing all corporations from contributing
to the campaign expenses of any
party. Such a bill has already passed
one house of congress. Let individuals
contribute as they .desire; but let us
prohibit In effective fashion all cor
porations from making contributions
for any political purpose, directly or
indirectly.
Another bill which has Just passed
one house of congress and which It Is
urgently necessary should be enacted
Into law, Is that conferring upon the

Washington, Dec. 4. The . presi
dent's message was laid before the
senate today 10 minutes after the
opening? Assistant Secretary Latta
carried the message to the senate.
Printed copies were placed on all
desks. The senators closely followed
the reading except Tillman, who left
fefore tile reading began. Other
southerners gave close attention to
the discussion of ihe race problem,
and denunciation of mob law. Piatt
and Depew paid little attention, but
conversed and laughed Jovially occa
sionally. In the house practically the full

Y.'.i: himtton. Pec. 4. The presl

California delegation. McLaughlin,
of l.os Angeles, says
"it Is fierce. Tomorrow morning

Indignation. The entire west wlM

government the right of appeal In
criminal cases on questions of law.
This right exists In muny of the states:
it exists in the District of Columbia by
act of congress. It Is of course not
proposed that In any case a verdict
for the defendant on the merits should
be set aside. Recently in one district
where the government had Indicted
certain persons for conspiracy In
connection with rebates, the court
sustained the defendant's demurrer;
while in another Jurisdiction an in
dictment for conspiracy to obtain re
bates has been sustained by the court,
convictions obtained under it, and two
defendants sentenced to Imprison

Lynching.
In connection with the delays of the
law. I call your attention and the at
tentlon of the nation to the prevalence
of crime among us, and above all to
the eqldemlc of lynching and mob
violence that springs up, now In one
part of our country, now In another.
Each section, north, south, east or
west, has Its own faults; no section
can with wisdom spend Its time Jeer
ing at the faults of another section; it
should be busy trlng to amend its
own shortcomings.
To deal with the crime of corrup
tion It Is necessary to have an awaken
ed public conscience, and to supple
ment this by whatever legislation will
add speed and certainty In the execu
tion of the law. When we denl with
lynching even more Is necessary.

Japan would find every naturalized
Japanese citizen of this country doing

country."
McLaughlin said, "If the president
desires to take the part of Japan
against a sovereign state that Is his
affair, but the authorities . of Cali
fornia wlil not long be able to precent
overt acts by the people."
Knowlnnd said, "It Is a good thing
tor California congressmen tho pres
ident's message did not come before
the election."
Raynor of Maryland, Indignant.
Washington, Dec. 4. Senator Ray
nor of Maryland, regards the presi
dent's attitude on the Japanese ques
tion as absolutely Indefensible and
such a threat as using force against
the state as "outrageous and start
ling to the imagination." This after
noon he offered a senate resolution
directing the president to notify all
the world, Japan Included, that the
states have exclusive rights of their
schools.
The resolution proposed declares It
Is the opinion of the senate there Is
no provision in the treaty with Japan
that relates to the subject, or Inter
feres with the right of the state of
California to conduct Its . system of
schools In accordance with its own
legislation. Raynor will speak on
the subject tomorrow.
The Raynor resolution was laid
upon the table and the senate ad
journed.

'
Fntir Classes of Lnlxir Have Their Pay1
Advuneed From Five to 13 Per Cent

Fifteen employes In the mechanical
department of the O. R. & N. in this
city have enjoyed a raise in wages
ranging from 5 to 15 per cent In the
various classes of labor.
There are four classes of labor em
ployed In the mechanical department
here under Foreman F. P. Rounds,
as follows: Car cleaners, car repair
ers, car Inspectors and round house
men. For a number of years Pen
dleton has been on of the principal
enr repairing and car clennlng points
on the O. R. & N. system, nnd a num
ber of men are employed here in
those occupations.
The raise in wages of the various
classes of labor Is as follows: Round

retain experienced men In the me
chanical department of the road at
various . places during harvest season
as many of them went Into the har

better for a short time. By raising
the wages In the various positions the
