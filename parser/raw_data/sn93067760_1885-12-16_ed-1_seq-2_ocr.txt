The Lion Law.
A bill t<> abolish tho ?.'< ;.. ?.tiv,
has passed tho lower house by ti
voto of 71 to ID, ?nd it ls proba! I
tbwt it \\ ill also bo successful li
the Sonate. There appeared to
a strong doniand for the reji il":
this much abused law. Perhaps
we may get along better without
it, but we confess our inability lo
soo exactly what tho majority ol
of thc farmers will do for supplh s.
The people are not lu a condition
to pay cash, and indeed, lids ? not
practicable in any agricultural di
triet; yet they must work for
months before they receive pa A
for their labor. Now tho tpiestion
is, bow shall they live during Ibis
time. Wo believe timi when Un
laborer eau no long? r ? led
bis labor, an Increase of chat
tel mortgage? and mortgtij. of
real estate will bo the result. M< r
chants will not advance supplio
without some security, andan
aminatiou of the ofllees will show
that thc growing tendency i
give mortgages on stock ami html
in addition t<< tho lien on the crops,
A great many farmers baveagn al
?leal of land and rn? money. Tli
rent this land for a certain amoti il
of cotton. The renter gives n i i ^ n
on the crop for supplies. New, if
he could mit do this, tito landlord
must either advance them himself
and If he is (as most men are nov -
inlays), unable to do this, bc mi: !
give the land as security. Suecos
sive bati crop year- conic und thc
merchant wants bis money and
tho land ls sacrificed.
This is our view if tho matter
and wc d<> not believe that thc
people desire that tho lion law
should K?> without a substitute, at
least. It is abused, we admit, but
could it not be amended.
Emigration Agents.
For the past few years it seems
that our County hus particularly
suffered at the bauds of Emigration
Agents. That,th? se agents usedls
honcst moan-: to induce people to
follow them; that they make mis
representations and promts
it is impossible to ?ullin, aro fach
well known in Ibis community.
Not only this, hut they have caused
laborers to desert their crop "
they most needed attention, ?nd
caused a great deal of ineonvi ii?
ience and worry to tho farmer
Yet when the legislature seeks lo
protect the people by requiring a
heavy license from these agents,
we hOar one man deel ;:.<. i! ;- "nu
Anierleaj" another calls upon free
traders to oppose tho bill hccui I
is a "protective" measure. Wc ad
init it is protection, anti uni. -
have Inhered under an erroneous
idea the very object of government
is to protect the people
If the practice of these men w h i
entice the poor deluded nogo to the
malarial plains of th.0 west it 'lida
towards Interfering with labor,
then the law which declares thal
before they shall operati they shall
pay ^Tii MI int'? the County Treasury,
nm! for each violation i hall pay a
flue of not more than $1000 or le>
than two yours Imprisonment, <>i
both, is good, and we might ex] eel
to see ICmigrantion Agents nock
other fields in tho future for plying
his pernicious trade. But our Son
ators think differently, and cense
qtiently have killed Mr. Wharton's
bill.
His Message to Congress,,
The President's Message lia? I eon
received ami generally conceded
to bc an able document. He has
given bis views in unmistakable
language upon nil question* of im
portance, and, upon the whole, i? I .
strikingly in accord with the I? rm
ocratie plat form of Inst yea : I?
views as expressed on former oc
casions, and fully sustains his repu
tation as a reformer, a wise ami
Upright statesman, ami a true dem
ocrat.
Our limited space will not allow
a full publication of this valuable
paper, but for the benefit of those
if any there be who feel disposed
to fall in with the free hade party
that appears tobe Springing up in
thin Htnto, we cull Attention lo ld .
sensible view of tho tariff tjttes*

new, ls certainly correct. Tho
