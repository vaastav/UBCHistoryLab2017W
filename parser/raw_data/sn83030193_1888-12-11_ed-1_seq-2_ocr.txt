OAPITALIBTIO 00MMUHI8H.
President Ci.bvbland was not as felici
tous ns ho sometimes is in phrase-making
when ho contrasted tho "communism of
capital " with the "communism of oppressed
poverty and toll."
And yet thcro Is somo justification for tho
term that has been so much criticised. The
communism of the Socialists would hold
everything In common for tho alleged bcncllt
of tho many. To do this It lias, as the Presi
dent says, " attacked with wild disorder
the citadel of rule." Tho communism of
capital a Tnist, for example shares all
fio profits from extortionate prices on
necessities of the people, for tho enormous
enrichment of a few.
When these combinations of Capital con
tribute money to buy a President, as thoy
havo just done, they erect a Plutocracy
within tho Republic, and am morn danger
oils to republican Institutions than the
crazy Communism of Paris can ever become
here.-
NEW YORK A DEMOCRATIC STATE
Tho Tribune gives what purports to he
tho " complete ofllcial vote" of this State
for Congressmen. Tho Democratic vote
foots up (509,107 and tho Republican
010,880. This seems to glvo the Repub
licans n plurality of 20,183 over tho Democ
racy on the Congressional vote. But tho
figures aro deceptive, for these reasons ;
Tho Republicans had no candldato In the
Sixth District, and therefore aIjow no Con
gressional voto there. The Democrats
show no voto in the Sixteenth, Twenty-first
and Twenty-fifth Districts. The Sixth Dis
trict comprises tho First, Fifth and Ninth
Assembly District of this city. In these
the Republicans cast 0,020 votes for
KiiiiAiiDT for Mayor. Tho Sixteenth,
Twcnty-flrst and Twenty-fifth Districts
consist of the counties of Putnam, Dutch
ess, Columbia, Clinton, Essex, Warren,
Franklin, Onondaga and Cortland. In
thpM) counties Mr. Cleveland received
47,r80 votcs
If wo add these votes to tho columns to
which they respectively belong, that Is
0,020 to tho Republican and 47,680 to tho
Democratic Congressional column, wo find
that tho Democrats would have 10,718
plurality on tho Congressional voto of tho
State. If, as was doubtless the case, many
of tho followers of tho organization that
ran no candidate in tho Congressional Dis
trict voted for tho nominee of tho other
party, the Democratic plurality would bo
considerably increased.
In the tnble of pluralities tho deception
is still more marked. In the Sixth Con
gressional District tho plurality given Is
between two Democrats. In tho Seventh
District tho plurality of 1,014 represents
ono Dcmocratlo candidate over tho Repub
lican, while the real Democratic plurality
was 8,800. In the Eighth District the
plurality of ono Democrat over another is
sot down, the Republican running third in
tho race, whllo the tmo Democratic plurality
over tho Republican was 21,140.
Hence the Congressional returns as pub
lished afford no correct information as to
tho strength of tho two parties in tho State,
and only prove more conclusively than even
tho voto on Governor that Now York Is a
Democratic Stato and will ho so at least
while tho Prohibition party exists.
As tho Prohibition vote for Congress
reaches over 41,000 and is found in every
Congressional District in tho Stato, it does
not look ns though that party is losing
ground.
AH UNFOUNDED BUMOB.
The rumor that the Corporation Counsel
and the Commissioner of Public Works in
tended to resign yesterday In order to be
reappointed by Mayor Hewitt for a new
term of four years caused people to look
for a sensation at the City Hall. The re
port was ridiculous. A conspiracy to pirat
ically seize public offices does not proceed
in such a manner. Mayor Hewitt is too
adroit in political manipulation to make
any such blunder. Ho would not render
himself liable to suspension by an open de
fiance of law.
The plot of tho County Democracy Job
bers, which they yet hope to get tho Mayor
to sanction, contemplated secrecy. Thoy
desired concealment until Mayor Hewitt's
term expired. Then their plan was to let
their Public Works Commissioner and
Corporation Counsel produce certificates of
appointment for four years and to hold on
to tho offices, at least during a protracted
litigation.
The World's exposure frustrated the
conspiracy. The plotters now despair of
its success. They begin to understand that
the law as it exists must be obeyed until
it is set aside by the courts, and that if tho
Corporation Counsel and Public Works
Commissioner should be found holding
office on Illegal certificates when Mayor
Guant takes hold of tho government they
will bo summarily ejected. Their only
chance of holding their positions' until the
1st of next May Is to obey tho law and to
reform such scandalous abuses as havp long
existed In the Public Works Department.
A rAITJirUL BEEBLTF.
The people of Birmingham, Ala., are
not at present In a suitable frame of mind
to pass judgment on the conduct of their
Sheriff in protecting a prisoner in his
charge from lynching. Possibly the facts
are not as represented, but the idea of
arresting this officer for doing what his
duty compelled him to do is preposterous.
Altogether too many jail doors have been
broken open by mobs in this country, and
the almost unanimous sense of the Ameri
can people will bo that Sheriff Surra U
deserving of hearty commendation for his
brave and determined vindication of law.
He repeatedly warned the attacking party
to desist, and ho certainly had no sympathy
for the prisoner. It appears that somo of
those who wero shot were trying to dis
suade tho would.be lynchers, but thcro was
no way for the defending party to discrim
inate. There was nothing to show that tho
Birmingham courts wero not fully
adcuuato to deal justly with the accused
In this raso. When tho stntuto law Is in
the hands of tho lawless who will not dis
pense justice there may be palliation for
lynch law, but it Is tho same excuse which
justifies revolution. No such condition pre
vailed in Birmingham. Tho uprising was
ono of riotous contagion. The cry was
" Hurrah, boys, let us take tho law in our
own hands I" when it was in good hands
already.
All such outbreaks must be suppressed
if civilized government Is to prevail. Wo
honor Sheriff Smith while deeply regretting
the tragedy which has brought sorrow to
Birmingham.
THE REAL FBAUD.
After drawing his salary as n Clvll-Scr-vlco
Commissioner without ever reforming
anything, until there Is n Republican Presi
dent In sight, Judgo KnoEinoN, tho Hoosicr
mossback whom President Ci.ktei.and for
somo inscrutnblo reason appointed to
administer n law with which he had no
sympathy, breaks forth In an Interview in
denunciation of tho reform as a "hollow
fraud."
The value that should bo attached to any
opinion of this Bourbon relic may bo esti
mated from his remark that " wero it not
for the fact that three-fourths of tho em
ployees now holding olllco in tho Federal
departments were thcro in 1888, Mr. Cleve
land would still bo President after the 4th
of March." The idea that a great National
contest over two antagonistic principles of
taxation, which caused the ablest and hot
test debate of ony campaign in twenty ycors
and enlisted tho earnest nttentlcm of over
cloven million voters, turned upon tho re
tention or dismissal of n few thousand
mnchlnc-llko clerks in Washington meas
ures up Commission Edokkton exactly.
Tho " fraud " in connection with Clvll
Servlce Reform lay In tho appointment of
two hereditary and practised spoils politi
cians such as EnoEitTON and Odeiily to bo
Commissioners. It was like putting an
infant to nurse to an alien baby-farmer with
a private burying-ground.
THE BATTLE OF THE PILL8.
The battle between tho big pUls and the
llttlo pills of medicine broko out in a new
place at Chicago last week.
Tho students who are learning the em
pirical use of big pills at the College, of
Physicians and Nurses In the Windy City
declared a boycott against tho embryotlc
dispensers of little pills. And when one
disciple of Hahnemann ventured to attend
a clinic, tho Professor being temporarily
absent, the ono hundred and eighty-seven
" regulars " picked him up and tossed him
into the street.
Of all the survivals of bigotry and Intol
erance in this afternoon of the Nineteenth
Century lu free-thlnklng America, Is there
anything quite as absurd ns the assumption
of ono school of medicine that it alone
should have the right to doctor pcoplo who,
presumably, havo brains enough to select
n physician to suit themselves.
Tho blg-plll students could leam no
less because little-pill students heard tho
lectures and observed the clinics. Do
they not confess a fear of competition in
practice by objecting to equal preparation
for practitioners of another school ? It
will be interesting to see what the college
authorities will do about this outbreak of
puppyism.
Throughout the late canvass the carpet
manufacturing firm of Hiooiks & Co., of
this city, took an active part in depleting
the woes which would overtake American
wage-earners in the event of the re-election
of Cleveland upon a Tariff Reform plat
form. Cleveland was not re-elected,
but the firm has ordered a reduction
of wages. It cannot wait, It seems,
for the prosperity which is to follow
the inauguration of Mr. Harrison next
March. Now, if the Democrats had carried
the country at the late election, and the
Higglns concern had followed with a re
duction, would not tho Protection organs
have drawn a terrible moral from the in
cident ? Wo fancy wo can hear the voico
of the eminent statistician and Paladin of
the New England Tariff Barons, Rorekt
P. Porter, shouting the requiem of Ameri
can industry. But whero is the doughty
Robert now ?
Congressman Holman yesterday offered
a resolution in the House, reciting tho
charges made in Tub World of the use of
money for corrupt purposes In the recent
elections and providing for a committee of
inquiry. The committee is instructed to
make a thorough investigation of tho matter
and to report what legislation is needed to
preserve the purity of the ballot. ' As Gen.
Dinolky, of Maine, wanted tho Inquiry to
extend to the contributions of public offi
cials for political purposes, the resolution
went to the Judiciary Committee. Certainly
legislation is needed to put a stop to tho
crime of vote-buying. But is it possible
that it can bo secured f Well, let's see
about It.
Probably the most useful and influential
person in the next Administration will be
Mr. Russell Harrison, the son of the
President-elect. He Is a vigorous and very
self-assured young gentleman, with an evl
dent liking for practical politics. He was
here during the campaign, collecting money
for election purposes, and now He pays us
another visit to look after Cabinet matters.'
It, is said that everybody who has a con
suming dcslro for public duty and a salary
is anxious to make the acquaintance of the
coming. Princo of the Whito House It is
thought that Russell will carry tho key to
tho private pantry.
It is about tlmo that the discussion over
the success of American girls In securing
English husbands was ended. It Is only
necessary, In most cases, to look at tho
girl. Beauty is lis own excuso for being
won. But now it Is tlmo for the com
bined intellect of both nations to ad
dress itself to tho solution of tho prob
lem as to why tho British wooer so often
wins. But a happy accident lets in a flood
of light on this puzzle at tho outset. A
Paris despatch of yesterday states that
JosKi'ii CiiAMiiEHLAiN was seen last week at
Worth's rooms waiting for some one.

AImico and Lorralno aro recovered and Germany
is placed under military subjection. The name
of tho book Is "La Gnpiro do Domain. " It is
pretty hard on a Frenchman not to ho permitted

publication of incendituy fancies.
It is said that tho project of attaching a
patent automatic caso with opem-glaises inside
to tho backs of tho scats will bo carried nut
within a few weeks in ono of the theatres of this
city. The case will open when a sffver quarter
of a dollar is dropped in a slot at its aide. Just
what kind of a patent thcro is to provont tho
opera-glasses from going homo with their user is
not mentioned. Perhaps a simplo chain would
servo tho purpose. There is somo room for scep
ticism with regard to tho announcement. Tho
greater want of boxes at tho back of the scats
has rcferenco to glasses ot a different descrip
tion. A mlnlaWo bar 1 apparently what is

From (A Sprlngjltld (ifaff. ) Jfrpw&KeiM, )
Tho artist of the New York Would depicts tho
dilemma which confronts Gen. Harrison with
regard to tho disposition of Mr. Blaine. Thero
is a Tippecanoe Cabln-et filled full by the ele-phant-in
caso it is decided to admit him. Tho
tall and trunk project at each end, the four de
termined feet till tho comers and thero is no
room for tho admission of tho proprietor of tho
cabin. In tho event that it is decided not to
admit thoelcphant, "What WlllBurely Happen"
is portrayed. The huge creature, bearing tho
f aco of Blaine, rears his trunk and body in anger
and the cabin is demolished about the ears ot its
trembling owner.
"To be or not to be, that la the question.''
Whether the President-elect shall decido to call
' ' tho uncrowned king " of his party as his chief
sihicr, to acknowledge a political mortgage as
big as tho cabin and accept the inevitable popu
lar verdict that must accompany such a situa
tion, or whether to vlndicato his own person
ality, rise to tho dignity of his own success and
command tho situation, theroby'Jncnrring the
hostility of tho Blalno managers who were at
tho front of tho campaign such are the alterna
tives. m m

His friends now look upon him as the Demo
cratic nominee for Governor in New York in

for that oilico ho would stand tho beat
chance of getting, tho Democratio nomination
for tho Presidency in 1803. Tho fact that Hill
will bo out of ofllco when tho Presidential Con

NEW 8TATE8 AND TUB TARIFF.
Tho Democratic Canen Will Score Sen
ator and DlacuM Policies.
SHCIAL to ini WORLD. 1
Wasrinoton, Dec 10. Tho Democratio can
cna will bo held in the hall of tho House at 7.30
to-morrow evening to consider tho policy to bo
pursued in tho matter of admitting tho Territo
ries. It is expected that tho tariff Isbuo will also
bo taken up, and the attitndo of tho Democratio
Senators in failing to attack tho Republican bill
in the Bcnato is likely to be freely discussed.
With regard to tho admission of tho Territories,
Mr. Cox, Chairman of tho Caucus Committee,
said to The WonLD correspondent to-night:
"My impression is that no omnibus bill can
get through tho House. There will bo opposi
tion to somo of tho features of tho best measnro
wo could dovisc, and it is my opinion tho caucus
will decide to tako nn tho questions separately.
Dakota will be divided. There is some contro
versy among our pcoplo on this subject, but I am
confident this will be the outcomo of our deliber
ations. We must admit theso Territories: thcro
is no getting away from this conclusion. Thoy
aro sufficiently well developed to demand State
hood, and it will go hard with tho political
party that possesses tho power but re
fuses to let them come in. Such a
party need never expect to gain a foothold
among them. Tho Republicans wonld like very
well to havo ns neglect this duty, so that thoy
might take the credit to themselves in tho Fifty
first Congress, but wo don't propose to mako any
such mistakes. They will bo admitted, and a
Democratio Houbo will open tho door for them."
There is an urgent demand for more activity
on tho part of the Democratic Senators in fight
ing tho Senate Tariff bill, and tho caucus is
likely to adopt an informal resolution calling
upon tho leading Senators to hold tho bill in tho
upper house at least until after tho holidays.
Tho House has had its fill of the tariff for one
Bcsslon, and is not anxious to open another cam
paign on tho samo subject, especially now that
the elections aro over.
"HONEST YVL AXWORTHY.
The I.ntrst Theory of the Flight of Cleve
land' City Trranurer.
rZCIAI. TO THE WOULD.
Cleveland, Deo. 10. Collector of Internal
Bevenuo John Farley, ex-Mayor of this city, is
engaged in what promises to be a successful ef
fort to effect a settlement betweon Thomas Ax
worthy, tho defaulting City Treasurer, now in
London. England, and bin bondsmen. Mr.
Farley was ono of Axworthy's most trusted
friends, and it was through him largely that tho
defaulter was ablo to secure tho indorsement of
Benator Payne and J. II. Wade, jr. , on his bonds.
Yesterday Mr. Farley received a letter from him
offering to surrender $157,000 in enhh if tho
bondsmen would agree not to prosecuto and to
havo tho indictments against him quashed.
Over half of the money Axworthy carried off has
been attached in a London bank, but thcro is
no probability that tho attachment will hold.
Mr. Farley's statement of Axworthy's affairs
makes them look better for him and the bonds
men also, aud explains the Treasurer's sudden
flight. It is as follows: Tho defalcation is
$4:18,000. Axworthy could reduce this to
-'81,000 by turning over tho cash held by him
solf and tho London oanks. In addition ho left
property estimated to bo worth !M5, 000, and
which would earn t.10,000 to 435,000 a
year If relieved from legal stress and
rightly managed. Axworthy was interested
in organizations in Colorado holding 000,
000 acres under an old Spanish land
grant. He had arranged to dispose of his Colorado
interests to New York men for 100,000 by
Oct. 1. Tills would havo tided him ovor tho
period whon the new depository law would pinch
him, and ho relied upon it, but tho New Yorkers
disappointed him and he was wrecked. Ho fled,
taking with him only what ho thought would
supply hiB future needs, and left behind enough
property, as ho behoved and still behoves, to
satisfy his bondsmen.
Mr. Farley is confident that in a very short
time the money will be returned.

Quay and Senators Cameron, Plumb, Perkins

Mahono's most intimate friends appear to bo in

Tho universal belief here is that Quay and the

to confer with Mahono as to his wishes in refer

of election. They were charged with refusing

United Statos Commissioner Lewis to let him
withdraw the charges, but Mr. Lewis refused.
On cross-examination ho became very violent,
and it was not until ho was told that ho would be
locked up that ho cooled down. When the caso
was adjourned the Commissioner said that
Nicholas had asked for protection, as ho feared
for his life. Tho announcement was grcctod

To tU tailor tfrh4 World,
The dressmakers and the ministers have had
their say about tho "deoolletedreaa," and ths
artists and physicians are to follow, so perhaps a
"layman "has no right to speak in this meet I
lng. Nevertheless, I should ltko to eay a few
words, not so much about tho subject itself M
about something that has been said about it,
Robert Collyor says, "The woman of to-day
simply wears tho decollete dress in oompllane
with tho conventionalities of fashlonablo life.
Tho fact that sho does this releases hot from
criticism. " This is the strangort doctrine I ever
heard promulgated. Tho Apostlo Paul released
women from all moral responsibility bpr declaring
that "tho man is tho head of tho woman as
Christ is tho head of tho Church. " But Mr. Coll. 1
yerscts up a new standard " tho convention- f
alitics of faBhionablo llfo" and declares I
that woman is "rcleasod from crlti- I
oism" so long as sho complies with these. I
For a good many years a groat number or I
women havo been undermining their health by
wearing heavy skirts and snug-fitting, unyield
ing corsets. Every physician I havo ovor talked
with about it agrees that this is so. In a letter
of Eleanor Kirk's not long ago I saw the follow
ing: "Ono doctor told me he had been so dl.
(justed and discourage! in his professional work
by tho suicidal dressing of his women patient
that ho has been sorely-tempted to tako np soms
other lino of business."
But this is all "done In compliance with the
conventionalities of fashionable life," which
"releases them from criticism." "Great Is

Why Indiana Feel Consoled. '
From tht LiqonUr (n.) Bonntr,
The Wobld asserts that there are about
130,000. purchasable voters in the Stato of New
York. Tho fact is gradually dawning upon tho
minds of Eastern pcoplo that Indiana is by no
moans tho worst Btato in the Union so far as
vote-buying is concerned. There is every rea
son to believe- that our Btate is not near a bad
in that respect as four or five Eastern States
that might bo named. Wo incline to the belief
that voto-buyjng is carried on more shamelessly
in Now Hampshire- than in any State in tho
