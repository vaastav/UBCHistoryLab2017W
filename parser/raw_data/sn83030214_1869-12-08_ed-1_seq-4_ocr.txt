Newfoundland has gone heavily against Con?
federation, thanks Arst to a unanimous body
of Catholics, end second to a large uuiiibi i of
Protestants. Tho issue has not been a religions
one, therefore; but tho Catholics of tho
province havo nevcitheless distinguished them?
wives by tho earnestness of tleir opposition.
Although Mr. Shea, laid to bo the most prom?
inent and able of tho Confederate leaders, in
himself a Catholic, ho lost his ?seat, no less
than seven ?trient! having taken the hustings
against him. Keaction is hoped for, pcihaps,
on tho strength of religious prejudices more
than on the merits of Confederation; but tho
Anti-Confederates havo achieved ? popular
?success, and one hard to overturn.
Mr. TrumbuH's bill to relievo Members of
Congress from Importunity may and probably
will not become a law; but it is very likely to
juove a serious obstacle in tho way of tho
< i vil Service bill. What Mr. Trunihiill pro?
poses is that it shall be in ad o illegal for any
Senator or Representative to recommend nny
body for otlice. If pasted it would leave half
our present Congressmen with their voca?
tions gone. Manifestly the duty of a
Congressman is not to bo Importuning
the President or Heads of Departments for
otlices for his friends ; yet in tlie development
of representative government, whether in this
country or elsewhete, this has boon found thus
far one o? its irreparable evils. If Mr. Trum
bull eaa cure it, ho will elevate the ehSAUCtei
of InglslllOfS. and greatly purify the public
service._
The suit begun by a son ot Victor Hugo
axainst the liappcl is an evidence that the
Irieconcileablos aro not a happy family. Cer?
tainly this party of tho Enraged, as they aro
newly called by their moro spiritless enemies,
contains some problematic characters, and not
least, M. Henri Rochefort. When those who
altogether sneer at this man as the advocate of
ouiHTW government, make his generous loss of
fortuno in the cause to which he devoted him?
self square with their least critical denuncia?
tions, wo may belicvo tho worst said of tim.

claims upon our symjiathies. Tlie Iirecoucilc
ables represent all at this time that is avowedly
Republican in France. It would be Strange,
indeed, if we, foninl no merit in them, because
France fearfully prefers to tolerate its Em?
peror, aud because these Radicals are few.
Porto Rico lias just been granted a Constitu?
tion by which Slavery is Raid to bo in some
particulars restricted; private correspondence
declared inviolable; and entire freedom of
worship proclaimed. We may, therefore, pre?
sume that the lato refusal to allow the scanty
Protestants of that country to build ?i church,
because tho discussion of domina was pro?
hibited, will now cease to have effect. Tlio.

this will h" Increased during its Mostonato

Three hundred and thirty-six years ago, tin
common sense of tho British people, and th?

of England, upon tho then paramount questioi
of what was the true jiolitical economy for tin
nation, found complete expression in tlio fol?
lowing preamble to the statute UM, Henry VIII.
chap. 4) enacted to encourage the inanufactuii
of Linen :

Tho whole body of International Kconomy
is in tfals preamble. The truths it announced
then are truths now. Tho nation that imports
the manufactured ?roods it consumes is pun?
ished with the enforced idleucs? of a largo
proportion of its men, women, and children;
with poverty, public and private; in the end,
with national decay and ruin. God's laws of
Industry havo been appointed to nations as
well as individuals. The penalties for their
infringement are as inexorably visited on States
as they aro on the men who, "void of undir
" standing," fold their hands to sleep upon
their unemployed capital, deaf to tho Divino
threatening?-".So shall thy poverty come as
" one that travcleth, and thy want as an armed
" man."
And, on the contrary, it is as trtio uow M it
was when the British Pailianient enacted the
first law for the encouragement of the British
manufacture of Linen, that the countries which
make and export cloth, iron, steel, copper and
other products of industij, aie, in tho strik?
ingly wise words of that law, "greatly en
" riched, and a marvelous great number of
" their people, men, women, and children, are
" set on work and occupation and kept from
" idleness, to the great fuitlicianco and ad
"vancement of their common wealth."
We are glad to hear that it is the belief of
Senator Wilson that the present session of
Congress|wil1 be of a "strictly botlnens*1 char?
acter. \\v might hope that this idea would bo
leali.'.i d, if tve did not know that the moto
eloquent member?, will be beset hy all the
usual temptations to display their powers. It
may ser m at preaont that allait s. are very lT.it,
and that Congress cannot go outsido of lium
iIiuiii legislation. J?ut wait a little. Wait till
the lufflilj rhetorical sneakers get bold of tho
financial question, and the Chin?se question,
and the Cuban question,^and tbe African qrtes
tion, and the Alabama question, and a band
red other questioBa, which we are not now
?willing to mention, for fear our suggestion
bhoiihl bo taken advantage of before we get
our nerves braced op to Ijatea to tbe eloquence
that will VOt bo expeiideinBpon them. There
is one. subject that we Were going to beg our
spread-ea_fle friends in Congress to let alone
for the present ses ion. Put wo have con?
cluded, after reflection, not to mention it to?
day, for fear that we might to-morrow havo a
do/.eii speeches upon it, transmitted from
Washington by telegraph. Those members,
however, v. ho are very anxious to know what
the subject is, may possibly lind out by in

A bill has airead* bien Introdaeed into the
Senate providing for the execution of the law
against polygamy la Utah, This special law
for tho suppression of polygamy has been for
a long tiiuo tin the statute book, but it has
always been a ?had letter. Several at?
tempts wire made at the last session to secure
[tl enfofeentent, but they were all failures.
None of the measures propos? d for the purpose

There is BO doubt that if the nece.?.?iiics of the
casi ami the feelings of tos people could givo
us such a mode of conveyance, we would have
it immediately. Cur citi/ens lose enough money
and time every year, through the wastefulness
ami the delays af the horse-cars, to cover too

take hohl oi this great work T
Hot in.tutors are an entirely new defense

with excellent effect In Madison, Ohio. A

Wc do not see how it could be expect? ?1 that
the Cuban Degrees would take sides with tho
Spanish party, which holds them in slavery,
against the Republican party, which oilers them
