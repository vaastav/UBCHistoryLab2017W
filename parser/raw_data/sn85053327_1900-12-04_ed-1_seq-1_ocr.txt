FIVE CENTS
FOUND DEAD
IN HIS BED.
Mysterious Death of a Great
Falls Man.
HIS WIFE SKIPS OUT
But Is Caught In North Dakota— Refuses
to Return Without Requisition
Papers.
Great Falls, Dec. 4.—Louis Edwards,
bartender at the Milwaukee Beer Hall,
was found dead in his bed Sunday at
5 o'clock. The howling of a dog at
tracted the attention of people to the
room. On the door of the room was
tacked a notice reading: "Gone to
Helena, will be back Thursday." This
notice was signed with the initials of
Edwards, but was in the handwriting
of his wife. Inquiry at the depot de
veloped the fact that Mrs. Edwards
had not gone to Helena, but had taken
a train for St. Paul, early Sunday
morning. The police along the line
of the Great Northern were notified to
be on the watch for the woman. The
body of Edwards was beginning to
decompose when found and evidently
had been dead for some time. Edwards
and his wife had been married a num
ber of years, and so rar as known
there has been no domestic trouble,
and if a crime has been committed no
motive is known for it. Mrs. Edwards
was apprehended today by officers at
Minot, N. D. She refused to return
without requisition papers.
STAFFORD ON TRIAL
For Killing Deputy Sheriff of Valley
County.
Great Falls, Dec. 4.—The district
court of Valley county today called up
the case of the state against Stafford,
charged with murder in the first de
gree for killing Sheriff John P. Elder,
at Culbertson. Stafford was a stock
inspector for Valley county, and claims
that in the discharge of his duty he
attempted to arrest Elder for driving
cattle from their customary range.
Elder resisted and threatened to shoot,
whereupon Stafford fired, killing Elder
instantly. Self defense will be claimed
as justification of his act by the ac
cused. The coroner's jury exoner
ated Stafford, but a more definite ex
amination, which was conducted at
the request of friends of Elder resulted
in producing sufficient evidence on
which to hold the defendant on the
charge Of murder.
MEMORIAL MONUMENT.
Union Miners of Butte Will Honor
Marcus Daly's Memory
Butte, Dec. 3.—At a meeting of the
Business Men's association tonight it
was decided to accept the offer of
J. C. Calderhead, chief of the bureau
of labor, agriculture and industry, to
include a write up of Butte in the next
issue of the departments official re
ports. A committee was appointed to
take the matter in charge. It was
also decided at the meeting to give
way to the miners' union of Butte in
the matter of erecting a monument in
memory of Marcus Daly. This was
done because, as many speakers as
serted, Marcus Daly was so closely
identified with the laboring people
that they should have the privilege of
taking the first place in doing honor
to his memory by an appropriate mon
ument.

great mine, and to Mr. Clark's advant

Oil financial interests.
The case against J. A. Greig, the

FOR NEWS TAKE THE BEE.
THE OPENING
SESSION
Of Congress Marked By Good
Feeling.
WINNERS AND LOSERS
Are In Good Humor—House Adjourns As
a Mark of Respect to the Memory
of Dead Members.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The opening
session of the house was brilliant,
but not exciting. There were the
usual throngs in the galleries, and the
usual display of floral gifts, but the
proceeding were of the most peaceful
form, consisting mostly of rapping to
order and calling together of mem
bers. Despite the fact that the presi
dential campaign had just concluded,
the best of feeling seemed to prevail
between the victors and vanquished.
The reading of the president's mes
sage, which naturally was the feature
of the day, occupied over two hours,
and it was listened to with respectful
interest by both sides. Deaths of the
late representatives, William D. Daly,
of New Jersey, and Hoffecker, of Del
aware, and Senator Cushman K. Davis
of Minnesota, and Gear of Iowa, was
announced, and as a further mark of
respect to their memories the house
adjourned until tomorrow.
When Speaker Henderson called the
house to order at noon the desks of
half of t he members were weighted
with flowers from admiring friends or
constituents, and the profusion of the
floral display gave the hall an appear
ance of a huge bower rather than a
legislative hall. Speaker Henderson
commanded the floor and gallery to
remain quiet and the chaplain deliv
ered the opening prayer. In his invo
cation the chaplain referred feelingly
to the deaths of the late representa
tives from New Jersey and Deleware,
which occurred during the recess. The
speaker then directed the clerk to
call the roll. As soon as the clerk
began, conversation on the floor and
in the gallery was resumed, and the
confusion became so great that the
clerk could not hear the responses,
and the speaker was obliged severa;
times to call for order. The speaker
announced that 250 had responded to
their names, and they were ready for
business. At 2 o'clock the president's
message was laid before the house.
Its reading was listened to attentively.
The reading occupied two hours and
ten minutes time, but there was no
demonstration during the reading, but
as the clerk finished there were rounds
of applause. The opening session of
the senate was brief. The only busi
ness being the reading of the presi
dent's message and administering the
oath to one new member.

young man who was accidentally shot
by his brother, Thursday night, near
Lolo, died Sunday afternoon, at the
Sisters' hospital from the effects of
the wound.
DILILAH OF SOUTH AFRICA.
Story of a Boer Woman Diplomat
Who Was Matched Against Kitch.
ener.
Some of the English correspondents
in the Transvaal do not hesitate to
say that the length of the war there
is largely due to a woman's machina
tions. Mr. A. G. Hales, of the Lon
don News thus describes her person
ality and her successful methods of
Wheedling information for Kruger
from English officers:
"She was a woman of about thirty
years of age, of German or Swedish
nationality, married to a Russian civil
engineer. She was not a beauty, but
her face was full of charm, her eyes
had the gift of eloquence and she
could say more without opening her
mouth than most women can impart
who possess a tireless tongue. She
could be gay or sad, pathetic, pleading
or imperious at will.
"Her hands were shapely, soft and
white, and had a trick of clinging ca
ressingly to masculine lingers when
the humor suited the dame, and men
who knew her well and later on came
under her spell have said that there
was a magnetism in her touch which
drew men to her as mooiight draws
the sea.
"But Delilah met her match in
Kitchener.
"She ran her eyes over the tall,
gaunt figure, the rugged, ugly face.
She looked into the prominent, all
seeing eyes and knew at a glance that
she was face to face with a magne
tism stronger than her own, and noth
ing would induce her to go near him
again.
" 'That is the most dangerous man
in Britain,' she said. 'I feel as if I
were within the shadow of death
when I am near him. lie; is a man for
men to conquer. No woman can reach
him to use him; he would read me
like an open book in an hour, and I
believe he would shoot me as he would
shoot a Kaffir if he caught me red
handed. No wonder he conquered in
Egypt. I think he will conquer in
hades.'
"By and by this extraordinary crea
ture began to feel she was suspected.
So she went up country for a change
of air.
"Wherever she went she was wel
comed by our officers, and it was a
noticeable fact that disaster to our
arms followed her friendship. A time
at last arrived when she found it ab
solutely necessary to confer with the
Boer leaders. She had our whole
military system at her fingers' ends,
the gist of things she had sent to her
friends, but full details could noly be
conveyed by word of mouth. So she
determined to make an effort. Dyeing
herself black as the inside of a camel
with nitrate of silver and logwood,
she stood transfixed as a Kab
man, and it was then that her glori
ous figure stood her in good stead.
From farm to farm right through the
Free State on to Pretoria she was
passed. And in Pretoria she gave
the Boers information worth a king's
ransom."—New York Mail and Ex

PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE.
A Brief Synopsis of the
Document
WHICH WAS VERY BRIEF
Not Over Two Thousand Words in All.
Outline of Legislation Desired By
the Republicans.
Anaconda, Dec. 4. — The Anaconda
Standard this morning publishes a
terse synopsis of President McKin
ley's message which was delivered to
congress at Washington today. The
message itself is not over 20,000 words
in length. The Standard's brief
summary of the more important points
in the document is as follows;
Foreign relations—Full expiation of
the Boxer outrages is demanded, and
the real culprits to be punished. China
is probably unable to pay a sufficient
money indemnity. Increased guaran
antee of foreign rights is necessary.
Americans are congratulated on the
prizes won at the Paris exposition.
Restrictions have destroyed the
meat trade with Germany.
Settlement of the neutral rights
question with Great Britain.
Italy demands satisfaction for the
Tullulah lynching. Federal restric
tion is recommended in such cases.
Lynching is again denounced.
The Isthmian canal—Nicaraugua is
ready to open negotiations. Ratifica
tion of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty is
urged.
Commercial treaties — The ratifi
cation of the pigeon-holed commercial
treaties with European and southern
American countries is again urged on
Congress.
The Philippines — Instructions have
been given the commissioners to call
for the gradual establishment of civil
government as the rebellion Is put
down. Natives to he preferred,
when possible, for civil officials. Fun
damental principles of American gov
ernment to he applied.
The standing army — It is recom
mended that the regular army be in
creased to tiO.OOO men, with 100,000 as
the limit in case of necessity.
Funds—A reduction in the war taxes
to the extent of thirty millions recom
mended. There is a surplus of eighty
millions for the last fiscal year as a
result of a reduction in expenditures.
Merchant marines — A remarkable
showing in the foreign trade totals.
McKinley again urges the passage of
the ship subsidy bill.
A Warning Hint—The country must
he careful lest it get reckless in its
habits in these times of prosperity.
GRANTS A SIGNAL VICTORY.
W. J. Bryan's Views on "The Eelec
tion of 1900."
New York, Nov. 28.— W. J. Bryan
contrlbutss to the December number
of the North American Review an ar
ticle on "The Election of 1900." in
which, considering the cause of the
result of its influence on the future,
he says in part:
"The republicans have won a sig
nal victory—a much greater victory
than the preliminary polls made by
either party indicated. At the time
this article is written the returns are
not sufficiently complete for careful
analysis, but, generally speaking, as
compared with 1890, the republicans
lost in the east and gained in the
west, whiie the central and southern
state sshowed comparitively but little
change. Again, speaking generally,
the democrats gained In the large cit
ies and lost in the smaller cities and
in the country.
"The republicans had another advan
tage in having a large campaign fund.
The republicans were also able to se
cure transportation for all republi
can voters who were away from
home. Instances are known where
prices of tickets were furnished for
long distances. The democrats were
not in a position to secure passes or
to pay transportation. This advantage
alone was sufficient to change the re
sult in close congressional districts
and in close legislative districts.
No Imperial Policy.
"It is impossible at this time to cal
culate the effect of colonization, or
the extent to which votes were pur
chased by the direct payment of money
or by employment for political work.
There are instances where as much
as $500 was offered to one man for
his political services for a few days.
"The republicans had another ad
vantage. the influence of which it is
difficult to estimate, viz.: The ad
vantage which accrues to an adminis
tration while a war is in progress. The
old saying that It is not safe to swap
horses while crossing a stream was
used for all it was worth notwith
standing the fact, in this instance, it
was ocean instead of stream that was
being crossed; for imperialism is an
idea of European origin. Many Were
led to the support of the administra
tion by the plea that the insurrection
must be suppressed before any plan
could he adopted for dealing with the
Philippine question. They refuse to
believe that the republican leaders
contemplated an imperial policy.
Potent Prosperity Argument. ..
"The most potent argument, how
ever. used by the republicans in the
campaign was the argument which
compared present conditions with
those which existed from 1893 to 189G.
To the laboring man the republican
party would say, 'Remember how
many w'ere idle during the last ad
ministration. Do you want to risk
a return to hardtimes?' The prosperity
argument influenced many farmers."
Mr. Bryan gives a list in detail of
the trusts, with a capitalization ag
gregating $700,000,000, that have been
formed within the last four years,
all of which used their influence in se
curing Mr. McKinley's election.
Continuing, he says: "All of these
trusts and many others had a pecuni
ary reason for suporting the republi
can ticket, for they not only have en
joyed immunity during the past ad
ministration, but they had every rea
son to expect further Immunity in case
of republican success; while the demo
cratic platform and the democratic
organization were outspoken in their
condemnation of private monopolies,
and the candidates were pledged to
aggressive measures for the extermin
ation of all combinations formed in
restraint of trade."
JOHN BLOOR'S FUNERAL.
