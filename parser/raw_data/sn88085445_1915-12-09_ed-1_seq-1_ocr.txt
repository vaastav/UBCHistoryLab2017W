Raised In Increments of One
Hundred and Thirty-three
Thousand.
FOLLOWING is the message oi
President Wilson delivered nt B
Joint session of the seimte and
bouse at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress;
Gentlemen of the Congress—Sluce i
Inst hud the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the Union the wui
jof nations on the other side of the sen
which had then only begun to disclose
Its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threateniug utid sinister scope
until it has swept within its tiatiic
some portion of every quarter of the
globe, not excepting our own betnl
sphere, has altered the whole face ot
International uilairs, uud now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen anil
I peoples have never been culled ui«oi
!to attempt before.
The president tells how this country
practiced neutrality and declares thul
he hopes thut when the time couic
for readjustment and recuperation thi.-
country will be of Infinite service. Re
f erring to Central and South American
problems, the president declares thai
we should retain unabated the spirit
which has Inspired us throughout the
whole life of our government uud
which was so frankly put Into words
by President Monroe.
We have been put to the test In the
case of Mexico, aud we have stood the
test Whether we have benefited Me\
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes ure In
her own hands. But we have ut leas,
proved that we will not take advan
tage of her In her distress and under
take to impose upon her an order and
government of our owu choosing. Lib
erty Is often a tierce and intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be sei
and to which no Inuinds of a few
men's choosing ought ever to be set
|SVery American who has drunk at
the true fountains of principle aud tru
ditlon must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vlr
glnlu bill of rights, which in the grea;
days In which our government was so
up was everywhere among us accept
eel as the creed of free men. That doc
trine Is, "That government Is or ottshl
to be Instituted for the common Line
fit. protection nnd security of the ueu
pie. nation or community;" that "ol
all the various modes nnd forms of
government, that is the best which is
capable of producing the greatest de
gree of happiness uud safety and is
most effectually secured against the
danger of maladministration, and thai
when any government shall be found
inadequate or contrary to tltese pur
(Kjses a majority of the community
hath an Indubitable, iuallenuble and
Indefeasible right to reform, alter 01
alx/.ish It iv such inutiuci us shall be
Judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unh v*itu tliigly ap
piled that heroic principle to the cuse
of Mexico nnd now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which bad so much of which to purge
Itself and so little sympathy from uny
outside quarter in the radical but nee
essary process. We will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her. and our course with regard to ber
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer-

PRESIDENT WILSON'S LATEST
PICTURE.
(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.)
Ica that we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIPE'S SPIRIT.
Economic Adjustment* Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
The mural Is that the states of Amer
ica nre not hostile rlvuls, but co-op
erating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of Interest,
alike in matters political uud la mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
uew Significance us factors lv interna
tional affairs uud In the political bis
lory of the world. It presents them a*
In a very deep and true sense a unit
in world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether. quick with common sympathies
and common Ideals. Separated, they
ure subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of bos
tile rivalries; united in spirit mid pur
pose, they cannot he disappointed ot
their peaceful destiny.
This Is pan-Americanism. It has none
of tbe spirit of empire in it. It is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and Independence
ami liberty and mutual service.
The president cnlls attention to the
meeting in Washington recently of
representatives of the pan-American
republics and says that economic ad
justment Is Inevitable in the next gen
eration.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people foe whom we
are appointed to speak can fail to per
ceive that their passion Is for peace,
their genius heel displayed in the pmc
tlce of the arts of peace. Great democ

Greatest Danger to Country
Comes From Within Our Bor
ders.
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to the lad
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of Independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed It as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
he; have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
pie against aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without. We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
in times of peace as In times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force—Four
Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
Cut war hus never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It Is a tiling
of disciplined might. If our citizens
are ever to light effectively upon v
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and Immediately effective. And
tbe government must bo their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the truinlng they need to take care of
themselves and of it. The military
arm of their government, which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their Independence secure, and not
their own independence merely, but
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they also be put In jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied liy principle and by chastened am
bttJon to play.
It is with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which will be laid before
you. and which I urge yon to sanction
and put Into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed
They seem to me the essential first
steps, and they seem to me for tbe
present sufficient
They contemplate an increase of the
standing force of the regular army
from its present strength of 5.033 offi
cers and tfW.MH enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7.130 officers
and 134.707 enlisted men. or 111.843
all told, all services, rank and Die. by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
const artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 780 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all Important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak, 702 non
commissioned officers for service in
drill, recruiting and the like and the
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
>rps. the ordnance department and
♦her similar auxiliary services. These
are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for lta present du
ties, duties which It has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our interior
army posts, but also In the Philippines.
In tbe Hawaiian Islands, the Isth
mus and In Porto Rleo.
By way of making tie country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and ui>on a larger scale
should occasion arise the plan also
•■onteuiphites supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 dlsclpllued cltl
zens, raised In Increments of 133.000 a
year throughout a period of three
year*. This it Is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at call
;»t any time throughout au additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400,090 men would be pro
vided with personal accouterments as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready *.o be supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the Jf -tular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months In
the year.
The president says it Is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Alw«y« Looked to It Our First and
Chief Line of Defene*.
The program which will he laid be
fore you by the secretary of the oavy
Is similarly conceived. It luvolvesouly
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out, hut It does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit, held In the minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed In the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that it will be to the advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next Aye
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
chief line of defense; we have always
seen It to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the seas.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high in
deed among the navies of the maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termtne how we shall complete what
we have liegun and how soon.
Tbe program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
Aye years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun-
Iwats, one hospital ship, two ammunl
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It Is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five const submarines, two gun
lioats and one hospital ship; tbe second
year two battleships, one BCout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship; the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines: the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen const submarines, one ammuni
tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tie cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat, one am
munition ship nnd one repair ship.
The secretary of the naTy is asking
also for the Immediate addition to tbe
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors.
S.fpOO apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma
rines. This Increase would be suffi
cient to care for the ships which are
11 be completed within the fiscal year
1917 and also for the numlier of men
which must be put In training to man
the ships which will be completed
parly In 1011. It Is also necessary that
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by at least 300 In order that
the force of officers should be more
rapidly added to. and authority Is ask
ed to appoint, for engineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
ing colleges, and for service in the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this full program should be carried
out wo should have built or building In
1021. according to the estimates of sur
vival nnd standards of classification
followed by the general board of the
aepartraent, an elective nuvy consist
ing of 27 battleships of the first line, «
battle cruisers, 2." battleships of the
second line. 10 arjored cruisers, 18
scout cruisers, 0 first class cruisers, 8
second class cruisers. 10 third class
