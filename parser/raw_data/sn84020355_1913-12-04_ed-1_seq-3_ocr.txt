tions prior to the last Presidential

the increased prosperity the mills
are enjoying since the election of
a Democratic President.

by the parcel post system.

The September bill was allowed
for $229.62, $221.85 of which was
vetoed by the auditor and passed
over the veto by the commission*,
ers. The $7.80 passed by the audi
tor was for meals and beds for the
supervisor. Among the items
vetoed, wert the following charges*
Steel Garage $ 35 05
Vulcanizing Works 22 25
2 auto casings 116 00
2* inner tubes 17 80

In the October bill the following
items appear:
Expense Steel Garage... .$ 65 30
Expense Elko Vulcanizing

$ 88 10
From the above it will be seen
that the road supervisor's automo
bile is a very expensive animal to
the taxpayers of Elko county. If
it was an "Expensive" auto when
purchased, it is keeping up its re
cord in splend'd shape.

ARE THEY EXTRAVAGANT?
Thi county commissioners are
fast getting a reputation for ex
travagance. Whether or not they
deserve the reputation, is a ques
tion that we are nut wholly prepar
ed to answer at this time, as we
know very little of their work dur
ing the year. But from what we
have seen since October, we have
no hesitancy in saying that the
criticisms heard wnenever taxpay
ers discuss county affairs have a
solid base to rest upon.
The bill allowed for the care of
the horpe that figured in the Mr
Comb case is one that tends strong
ly to support1 the charge of extrav
agance. The writer learned that
when this horse wns first hrought
to Elko she was cared for by
Sheriff Harris at 50 cents a day for
four days. The horse was then
taken from the Sheriffs care and
placed in charge of a keeper at $3
per day and feed furnished. The
Commissioners may not be respon
sible lor this arrangement as we
understand it was the act of the
district attorney and the other at
torneys in the case. But be this as
it may the commissioners get th?
slame for allowing $3 a day to a
teeper for 53 days for caring for I
icr. It looks to the average man
is if this animal could have been ,
iu*t as well taken c&re of and just i
is safely kept for all the purposes 1
)f the trial for very much leas
. money.
Another source of complaint, is
the expense bills allowed the road
supervisor. The November bill will
be found elsewhere. It should be
read and studied by the taxpayers.
From the items of the November
bill it will be seen that the county
pavs for washing the automobile
and for everything needed in keep
ing it in repair. It will also be
seen that for an "expensive" ma
chine it needs a great deal of fixing
every month. For the three months
it has been used by the road super
visor the bills for repairs, cil, etc.
amount to over $300, or over $100
per month. This added to the sal
ary makes, the cost of this officer
$250 per month.
We have no intention of criticiz
ing the work of the road supervis
or as we know nothing about it
but we do think that he should keep
his own machine in repair.
Some people who pay taxes say
that the county is paying alto
gether too much money in settling
Mr. Agee's private grievances. As
proof of this they point to his
trouble with Sam Bachman that
cost the county a snug sum We
believe Mr. Agee is entitled to the
same protecton as other citizens
and no more. His property should
have all thq protection accorded by
the law to all citizens. If the
prosecutions he brings are based on
personal spite, and brought to
wreak personal vengeance, he is un
worthy of any protection. But this
we cannot believe.
WELLS FARGO
MOST PAY TAXES
Judge Ducker has decided the
case of the State of Nevada against
the Wells Fargo Express company
in favor of th?> State. This suit was
brought in February 1911 to com
pel the company to pay its taxes
for 1910. Several other suits were
started against the company by
other counties but were^ not press
ed"for trial, it being understood
that the outcome of this suit would
determine whether or not the ex
press company would be legally
compelled to pay its taxes in this
state for the years it has refused to
pa v.
The decision upholds the contcn
| tion of the state on every point
and, if not appealed from, will re
sult in this greedy corporation pay
ing for some of the Drotection the
state has given it for many years.
A COMSTOCK ACCIDENT
The following from the Carson
Appeal of December 2,1879, bringB
to our memory the worst mining
accident of ifs kind that ever hap
pened on the Comstock. If our
memory serves us right, some of
the men fell into the shaft, but the
most of them struck the sheet iron
floor and were either killed out
right or horribly mangled:
About 6 o'clock this morning a
/
cage was run up into the sheaves
at the Union Con, by the engineer.
The cage had eighteen men on
board and shot like a flash to the
heavy timbers, forty feet above the
mouth of the shaft, and all the men
but one were precipitated to the
floor. The seven and one half inch
cable, capable of sustaining eighty
tons, snapped like a thread. There
was talk of lynching the engineer.
The Woman In tho Caaa.
"Dlgby, you are worrying about
wm? woman." "Blfllea, I am." "I
knew ltl Bhe la constantly la your
thought*." "I can't get her out of b||
mind." "I wouldn't droam of aakltf
you to tell me her name." "1 have
no objections to letttng you know bar
name. It 1* Mrs. Fruner, my land
lady. I owa her for alx months
board."
What Made Him Resigned.
A tourist from the east, visiting
an of prospector In hla lonely oabtn
In th? bills, oommented: "And yet
yon seem to cheerful and happy."
"Tea," replied the one of the pick
&nd shovel. "I spent a week In Boa*
ton once, and no matter what hap
pens to me, I've been cheerful evaff
ilnoe."
. ?
What Ha Called It.
"Are you troubled -with lnsomnle?
Sleeplessness T" "I should say. I am.
Borne sights I don't sleep three
hours." "That so? I've got It awfully
bad. I've been afflicted now about
two years. The doctor calls It neurls
tnsomnls paralaxltis." "I're had It
about eighteen months, and we call It 1
BtheL"-?Ocean View Vldette.
Cultivate 8ense of Humor.
A sense of humor Is certainly the
salt of life, either of the married var
stety or the plain, single existence.
It certainly helps a wife to laugh off
many a little bruise that otherwise
would grow into a festering sore. To
see the funny side of many of the
trivial annoyances of life at the time
they happen certainly eases the situa
tion.
Softening Granite 8labs.
*- \3 been observed that, under
conditions which have not
plained, granite will warp like
v.i .. A slab set in a wall has been
under observation in Switzerland, and
a perceptible distortion has made ltr
self apparent.?Harper's Weekly.
8ave0 by Cigarette Case.
Ambulance surgeons tell of many
cases where a bullet has struck a
man's cigarette case a glancing blow
and not even so much r.s pierced the
lining of the pocket in v. hich the case
was carried.
Of Doulrh'Jl Btatth.
"Have you much of a friendship
with Wombat? I He9 you going home
with him occasionally." "The status
of our friendship Is a puzzle to me.
He nerer takes me to his house except
when he has been drinking."?Louie
Tllle Courier Journal.
Politics and Friendship.
"Have you decided how you are go
ing to vote?" "Yes; but let's change
the subject. There's no reason why
you and I should not continue to be
friends."
8urely Had Forgotten Something.
An Eastbourne, Sussex (England)
woman recently started on a railway
Jonrney with the uneasy feeling that
?he had forgotten something. ThlB
turned out to be correct, for she had
to take the next train back to pick
up her child, which she had left on the
station platform.
Concerning Woman.
When Qod thought of mother, he
must have laughed with satisfaction
and framed it quickly?so rich, so
deep, so divine, bo full of bouI, power
and beauty was the conception.?*
Henry Ward Beecher.
I Flareback.
"Had your diamonds stolen lately?"
Inquired the cub reporter. "Engaged
to any duke*?" "Kindly omit banall
[ ties," responded the stage favorite.
"Actresses don't talk that kind of stuff
nowadays. If 2 ~m to be Interviewed,
I shall discuss ethical questions only."
?Louisville Courier-Journal.
Within tho Nursery Doors.
The best covering for a children's
playroom is cocoa matting, ?whlch can
easily be taken up and shaken twice .
a week. 1
Barley and lime water given to a
baby strengthens it and helps to
make bone. It also renders the milk 1
readily digestible.
It is an excellent plan to put a piece
of white oilcloth under a child's plate.
It can be wiped after every meal and
saves the tablecloth.
Hair pillows arc nice for baby's
cribs or carriages. They can be
washed In the hottest of water 'and !
dried by artificial means and no dam
age Is done them.
To make baby's hair curl brush It
upward and twist It round the fingers
(after damping the hair). Brushing
downward makes the hair grow
straight and smooth.
