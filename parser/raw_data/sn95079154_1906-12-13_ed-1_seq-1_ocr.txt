PEXTER BURTON DEAD QF WOUND
Man Shot by E. P. Eskridge Near Vlokers
Dies In Radford Hospital.
EastRadford, Va., Dec. 10.-Dexter
Burton, who was shot by Edgar P. Esk?
ridge, near Vicker'a Switch, December
1st, died at the Tidewater Hospital here
this afternoon, while undergoing an op?
eration.
Burton, it will be remembered, was
?kot at the home of Mrs. Edgar P. Esk
?jridge by the latter's husband, who was
jealous of the attentions paid his wife
by Burton, a tenant on Mrs. Eskridge's
farm.
Eskridge and his wife have not lived
together for two years, he residing at
bis old home on New River, and she on
a farm a few miles distant.
Going to his wife's home about ten
o'clock on the night of the shooting,
and finding Burton there, Eskridge fir?
ed upon him, shooting him in the back,
the bullet passing through one kidney
and breaking two ribs.
Eskridge went to Justice Otey after
the ,?hooting and gave himself up, claim?
ing thV unwritten law as justification of
his act.
Eskridge belongs to an old family of
tche Southwest. His father, the late J.
E. Eskridge, was state senator in read
duster days, and his mother is still liv?
ing. Mrs. Edgar Eskridge was a Miss
Terrell, of London, England, and her
mother retides in the north of France.
Burton's attention to Mrs. Eskridge
. date back for a number of years, it is
i said.
Sympathy is with Eskridge.
Mrs. Eskridge claims that Burton,
-who had been watching for thieves in a
.corn field nearby, merely stopped in to
?warm, and that her husband broke down
tthe door and entered in an intoxicated
?of?dition and fired at Burton as he went
out of the door.
Burton was brought to the Tidewater
hospital today in a very precarious con?
dition and died just after tne operation,
A coroner's inquest showed that he
died from collapse due to previous inter?
nal hemorrhage. Burton was about for?
ty years old and leaves a wife and six
children. His wife was at his bedside
when he died. The body will be taken
to Vicker's tomorrow for burial.
Allen T. Eskridge, of Pulaski, will de?
fend his kinsman, Edgar Eskridge, when
the case is tried in the court of Mont?
gomery at Christiansburg.
NEW RAILROAD.
Will Conneot With Norfolk and Western
at Bristol
New York, Dec. 10.?According to
Col. Malcolm H. Crump, of Bowling
Green, Ky., Kentucky commissioner to
the Jamestown Exposition, a new rail?
road is being built in Kentucky, which
ha? for one of its great objects direct
connection between Norfolk and all the ,
long strips of Southern Kentucky,
from Cairo, 111., on the Mississippi
River, to Cumberland Gap, where Vir?
ginia, Tennessee and Kentucky boun?
daries meet.
The Cairo and Cumberland Gap Rail?
road is the name of the new line.
About 50 miles of track is laid. Its
route parallels the Kentucky-Tennessee
boundary clear across the former State
from Cairo to Cumberland Gap.
From Cumberland Gap it is proposed
to extend it to Bristol. There it will
connept with the Norfolk and Western
and for Tidewater Virginia. *
Cairo, JH., as well as the territory
tracked by the proposed new railroad,
is due west of Norfolk. It has no di?
rect steam railroad connection with
tidewater for the delivery of its mining
products.
The projected route from Cairo to
Cumberland Gap, thence to Bristol and
on to Norfolk by the Norfolk and West
furnishes the direct tidewater rail con?
nection, which Col. Crump says that
great stretch of Southern Kentucky
needs so badly.

dor Meyer, at St. Petersburg, by the

President and Secretary Root of apply?
ing civil service principles in relation to
promotions in the diplomatic service.

agreed upon as follows:

ferred to Peru, and Minister Dudley, to
Peru, to be Ambassador to Brazil.

Nen Near Dungannon.
Gate City, Va., Dec. 10.-Deputy
Marshall Flournoy Quillin and posse
captured William Ramey and William
Brickey, who were operating an illicit
distillery in the bluffs near Dungannon
Friday night. The officers brought the
prisoners to jail and left two men to
guard the distillery.

ginia penitentiary for murder. He has

JAP AMBASSADOR'S VIEWS.
Thinks Adoption of President's Recom
mendatlon Would be a Solution
Washington, December 8.? Favorable
action by Congress on the recommenda?
tion of the President in his last message
that an act be passed specifically pro?
viding for the naturalization of Jap?
anese who come to the United States
intending to become American citizens,
will go far toward securing a contin?
uance of the traditional friendly rela?
tions between this country and Japan,
in the opinion of Viscount Aoki, the
Japanese ambassador.
The ambassador expressed the belief
that there were not so many Japanese
in this country to take advantage of
naturalization if it were granted, but he
thought that such an opportunity should
be afforded them along with the citizens
of other countries. He said he did not
think it probable that those Japanese
who were emigrating in large numbers
to Hawaii and the Pacific coast would
avail themselves of naturalization, be?
cause of the fact they represented the
poorer classes and most of them ulti?
mately returned to Japan.

The Pythian Lecture.
The Pythian Lecture which was an?
nounced to be delivered in the town hall
on last Thursday night by Rev. John
Hallowell Dickinson, of Richmond, Va.,
drew an excellent crowd, many persons
not members of the fraternity attend?
ing. Mr. Dickinson proved himself a
most interesting and eloquent platform
speaker, and for about one hour enter?
tained delightfully the audience with a
discussion of the splendid principles and
tenets of the Order. He is rector of one
of the Episcopal churches in Richmond,
and is destined to become one of the
popular and useful ministers of his
church.
At the conclusion of the lecture the
Pythians and quite a number of invited
guests went to the Jeffersonville Hotel
where an excellent banquet was served
and heartily enjoyed. Mr. and Mrs.
Kelly proved that they were equal to
such occasions by the nice supper they
had prepared for the occasion. The
dining room was tastefully decorated
and the supper nicely servad.

In Memory of Jennings Beavers.
Jennings, the little infant son of Mr.
Jas. P. Beaver, was born October 31st,
1905, and died at the home of his grand?
parents, Mr. and Mrs. T. C. Christain,
November 16th, 1906, of bronchitis and
pneumonia. He was taken sick on the
9th, but was not thought to be serious
until a day or two previous to his death.
Dr. Baylor gave medical aid but all
medicine was of no avail. His mother's
death which preceded his only three
months and eight days, brought much
sorrow to the bereaved husband, but
the little prattling babe seemed to con
Sole him even in the deepest hours of
his grief, but when the death angel call?
ed and took the little one, he was rob?
bed of ail that was so near and dear un?
to him here below.
The remains were taken to the home
of his grand-mother, Mrs. Susan Beav?
ers, on the 17th, and on the 18th, were
interred in the family burial ground.
Services were conducted by Rev. E.
Linkous.
The little one was fondly loved and.
cherished by all who knew him, but?
"Let fate do her worst,
There are relics of joy,
Bright dreams of the past,
Which she cannot destroy;
\Vhich come in the night-time of sor?
row and care
And bring back the features which
joy used to wear.
Long, long be one hearts
With such memories filled,
Like the vase in which roses have once
been distilled?
You may break, you may shatter
the vase if you will
But the scent of the roses will hang
'round it still,"

BURNED TO A CKISP,
Thought That Death of Aged Soott
County Farmer May Have Been
Due to Foul Play.
Gate City, Va., December 8.?John
