Thursday, December 5, 1901.
Reed is there do longer, but his
rules still run Congress.
The President has Congress on his
hands, for the first time.
The President has fired his shot at
the trusts?but he never touched
them.
The Steel Trust has had prosperity
the past year. Its profits have been
$75,000,000.
Congress is in session once more,
and the trusts are still doiDg business
at the old stand.
Whatever else Congress may do,
there will be no failure to dispose of
the surplus in the Treasury.
Senator Scott has conceded that
Brewer Schmulbach has the right to
run for the Senate. Now let the beer
flow.
President Roosevelt had nothing
spectacular in his message to Congress.
Ferhaps he is arranging for some fireworks
later on.
"There must be no disturbance of
the tariff," boldly declare those who
are getting rich from the present schedule.
Of course not?it is too good a
thing?for them.
The business of train robbing in the
West seems to be a little slow, but the
trusts are going on with their peculiar
style of robbing seven days in the
week?and nights also.
The Hon. Mark Hanna has no
reason for falling out with President
Roosevelt. There seems to be no disposition
to withhold anything that the
bosses in the party may desire.
There is talk of running our friend
W. L. Mansfield for Congress in the
fifth West Virginia district. If the
people want to be represented by an
honest and able man, he's that sort.
Perhaps the recommendation of
the President that Congress should be
economical in its expenditures was intended
for a joke. That big surplus
in the Treasury and economy do not
go together.
The President says that there are
still troubles ahead tor us in tne runippines.
This is indeed true. We
are likely to have four hundred years
of worry, just as Spain had, if we hold
the islands bo long.
The position of Senator Wellington
in the United States Senate is a very
peculiar one. The Republicans won't
have him and the Democrats don't
want him, so about the only thing he
can do is to dock by himself.
The President wants to see a great
Navy established by our government.
We think that the question as to who
really won the battle of Santiago
ought to be settled before anything
further is done. Was it Sampson or
was it Schley?
When it comes to a question of
passing the ship subsidy bill or just
throwing open the Treasury vaults,
there is really not much choice, except
that in the former event the
swag will not have to be divided
among so many.
The President may be very indedependent,
indeed, but his message
shows that be has no idea of running
independence into the ground. He'll
probably suit the party bosses just
about as well as the average occupant
-f il. Tf 71_ 1a. - XT

The Supreme Court haa decided
that the Philippine Islands are a part
of the United States, and that tariff
duties on goods imported from the islands
are illegal. The Court also decides
that Congress has the right to
impose tariff duties if it so desires.
There is little doubt that Congress
will be absolutely dominated by the
small but powerful clique of politicians
who usually run things to suit themselves.
Men of independence who
seek to remedy some of the glaring
evils in public affairs are to be unceremoniously
choked off.
Congress assembled in Washington
on Monday. In the House of Representatives
the Republicans elected
Hon. David B. Henderson, of Iowa,
Speaker, the Democrats voting for
Hon. James D. Richardson, of Tennessee.
The Republicans have a majority
of about 50 in the House. The
Senate was called to order by Senator
Frye, of Maine, president pro tern.
It is announced that au agreement
has been reached by the United States
by which Denmark will sell to us the
islands of St. Thomas and St. John,
known as the Danish West Indies.
These two islands contain together
about 44 square miles, and we are to
pay between four and five millions of
dollars. This is a pretty steep price,
for them, but a good deal cheaper of
course, than the Philippines, which are
costing us something like a million
doUars a day?and even at this rate
we still have to fight for a foothold
in them.
Islands come very high, but Uncle
gam seems to want them.
President Roosevelt's Message.
The first message of President Roosevelt
was submitted to Congress on 1
Tuesday. Although he discusses many
subjects of public importance, the
President has no startling recommendations
or suggestions, nor does he say (
anything to which his party may ob- ,
ject.
He refers to the assassination of
President McKinley, and adviees that
no anarchist should be permitted to
remain in this country, but should be
deported. The President takes up the
subject of trusts, but thinks that action
relating to these combinations should
be cautiously considered. He 6ays:
The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized in one
State, always do business in many
States, often doing very little business
in the State where they are incorporated.
There is utter lack of uniformity
in the State laws about them; and
as no State has any exclusive interest
in or power over their acts, it has in
practice proved impossible to get adequate
regulation through State action.
Therefore, in the interest of the whole
people, the nation should, without interfering
with the power of the States
in the matter itself, also assume power
of supervision and regulation over all
corporations doing an interstate business.
This is especially true where
the corporation derives a portion of
its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency in
its business. There would be no hardship
in such supervision; banks are
subject to it, and in their case it is
now accepted as a simple matter of
course. * * * I believe that a
law can be framed which will enable
the National Government to exercise
control along the lines above indicated,
profiting by the experience gained
through the passage and administration
of the interstate commerce act.
If, however, the judgment of the Congress
is that it lacks the constitutional
power so pass such an act, then a
constitutional amendment should be
submitted to confer the power.
The President favors reciprocity,
but does not believe there should be
any general change in the present tariff
laws. He favors the restriction of immigration.
Not only would he reenact
the laws excluding Chinese laborers,
but he would apply an educational
and economic test to Europeans
who come to the United States. He
thinks that the shipping interests
should be built up, and here's the
chance for the subsidy to the rich ship
owners. He advises that a new cabinet
officer be created, to be known as
the secretary of commerce and industries.
He favors the acclamation of
arid lauds in the West by a vast system
of irrigation, and also suggests
government action looking to the preservation
of forest lauds.
Referring to foreign affairs, he says
our government intends to abide by
the Monroe doctrine and insist upon
it as the sure meane of securing the
peace of the Western Hemisphere.
*" . L 1 1 j ,1..
mere are sun irouoits aueau iu iue
Philippine Islands, he says, and iu
dealing with the people of these inlands
we must show patience and
strength, forbearance and resolution.
We must give them opportunity for
industrial development. The President
wants the work of increasing the
Navy kept up; more battleships must
be built; 5,000 additional seamen and
marines should be provided and a national
navy reserve established. The
Army is big enough at present.
He thinks a cable should be laid to
Hawaii and the Philippines. A canal
across the isthmus connecting North
and South America should be commenced
as soon as possible. He advocates
the civil service laws and
stauds for meiit as the chief recommendation
in making appointments.
He desires liberal appropriations for
the National Museum and the Zoological
Park, and speaks favorably of the
fairs at Charleston and St. Louis. The
President concludes his message with
the declaration that "we are at peace
with the nations of mankind, and we
firmly intend that our policy shall be
such as to continue unbroken these
international relations of mutual respect
and good will."

A. J. Snell wanted to attend a party,
but was afraid to do so on account of
pains in his stomach, ?hich he feared
would grow worse. He says, "I was
telling my troubles to a lady friend, who
said: 'Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera
and Diarrhoea Remedy will put you in
condition for the party.' I bought a
bottle and take pleasure in stating that
two doses cured me and enabled me to
have a good time at the party." Mr.
Snell is a resident of Summer Hill, X.

The wedding of Lula M. Good and
John F. Dunn, of Hagerstown, set for
Saturday night, did not take place.

night the prospective bride went to

and became hysterical.
It is believed that an attempt was
made last Sunday night to wreck a

ten coaches full of people returning
to Baltimore and Washington.

At Hagerstown the jury in the case
of Frank Rinehart, tried for causing
the death of Miss Finfrock by upsetting
a boat in Lake Royer, near PenMar,
after being out 41 hours, were
unable to agree. Judge Stake discharged
them. The State's Attorney
stetted the case and it will probably
not be tried again. Reinhart goes
free, but he had a good soare and paid
pretty dearly for his foolhardy exploit.

Pains in the "Back
Are symptoms of a weak, torpid or
stagnant condition of the kidneys or
liver, and are a warning it is extremely
hazardous to neglect, so important
is a healthy action of these organs.
They are commonly attended by loss
of energy, lack of courage, and sometimes
by gloomy foreboding and despondency.
"I had pains in my back, could not sleep
and when I got up in the morning felt
worse than the night before. I began taking
Hood's Sarsaparilla and now I can
sleep and get up fceilng rested and able to
do my work. I attribute my cure entirely
to Hood's Sarsaparilla." Mrs. j. N. Perby,
care H. S. Copeland. Pike Road, Ala.
Hood's Sarsaparilla
and Pills
Cure kidney and liver troubles, relieve
the back, and build up the whole svstem.
