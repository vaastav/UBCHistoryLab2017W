No Amrihti for Summer, Schurz, Tipton
asp Trumbull.?In the caucus of republican
Senators yesterday it is said that Vicc President
elect Wilson favored the policy of granting
amnesty to the liberal republican Senators, but
other Senators would not listen to this propo
sition.
Henry M. Stanley writes to the committee
of invitation accepting the dinner tendered him
by the journalists here, and appointing January
11 as the time most convenient to him. A meet
ing of the general committee ao<l oi the corres
pondeuts generally is called at the oflice of Mr.
Ki.owtton, "Newt-paper Bow," next Friday
night to complete the arrangements.
There was no caucus of republican Sen
ators this morning; the committee of tive ap
pointed yesterday to rearrange the statu ling
committees ol the Senate not having completed
thtir work. They will probably be ready to re
port to moi row. The Senate adjourned to-day
without transacting any business, on aceouutoi
the committees not yet being designated.
Sou bed by defeat at home, Mr. ltepresenta
tive Roosevelt seems disposed to vent his spite
against the District of Columbia during his
brief stay in Congress. An original capital
mover, it is not strange that he should note with
dissatisfaction the evidences of progress au<l
improvement here, which have destroyed the
hope of reviving that project.
Transjer of Naval Officers Lieut.
Geo. E. Ide ordered to the receiving ship Ver
mont; Commander 1>. L. Braine detached as a
member of the board of inspection and placed
on waiting orders; Lieut. B. l'.Gainberton from
the California and ordered to proceed home and
wait order*; Lieut. Commander Yates Stirling
detached from the receiving whip Independence
and ordered to the California.
Though the Senate caucus has not yet taken
detinite action, it seems to be the opinion that it
will be decldcd to put the republican Senator*
who did rot vote for Grant upon the same foot
ing a> democratic Senators. That i.?, the demo
cratic and liberal republican Senators will be
allowed to settle among themselves who shall be
designated to the minority representation ou the
committees.
Illness of Mu. Si mmku.?Senator Sumner
was seized with a rather sharp attack of his
complaint (heart disease) while on his way from
Prof. Tyndall's lecture to the street cars, and
suttered" a good deal last night. His friends
have warmly urged his cessation from all his
Senatorial labors, but be was iti his sent to-day
at the opening of the session, evidently deter
mined "to die in harness."

MilO.L Prudbh , for many years a clerk in
the Judge Advocate General's office, has been
detailed tor duty at the Executive Mansion.
The statement that Mr. Levi P. Luckey has
been promoted as assistant to Gen. Babcock is
a mistake. Mr. Luckey is assistant private
secretary to the President, and will continue to
occupy that position, simply changing his pres
ent quarters to the room adjoining the Presi
dent's office, occupied by Gen. Babcock.
The report of the southern claims commis
sion covers some 2,200 cases, of which about 500
are from Virginia. The amount claimed is the
2,200 cases is about *4,600,000, of which some
?*0,0->0 is allowed, and the rest-about
ja,* 0,000? U rejected. They have abont fifteen
thousand claims yet to decide and report, in
which the di*proj>ortion between the amounts
claimed and allowed is expected to be as great
and probably greater.
What Postmasters May Not Do At
torney General Williams has decided, in answer
to a communication from the Postmaster Gene
ral, that post office officials have no right to
oi>en or detain letters or other matters trans
mitted through the post office, though they may
know that they contain obscene matter. The
Attorney General adds that postmasters hive
no more authority to open letters (other than
those addressed to themselves) thau any other
Citizen of the United States.
Death of Mr. J. B. Batous.?We regret to
announce the death last evening in this city of
John Heading Briggs, stationery clerk or the
House of Bepresentatlves. Mr. Briggs was well
and favorably kaown in this community, and
bis death will be generally deplored. He was
torty-seven years of age, and In early life was a
journalist. Hi* dying request was that his body
should be taken to Chicago for Interment. Mrs.
Briggs, ("Olivia") a well-known Washington
correspondent of the Philadelphia Preti, was
the wire of the deceased.
Tn Ofeiifg Lecture by Prof. Tyndall
last night, on "Light," drew to Lincoln Hall
one of the largest and most select audiences
ever gathered In this city. For once Mr. 8um
fter'was drawn from his scholarly chamber, to
assiat In the reception of tbe disUagnished Eng
lish scientist. - Professor Henry occupied a seat
on the platform, and the lecture-room fairly
bristled with notables In various walks of life.
A report of the lecture lacking the aid of the
brilliant illustrations fails to give any adequate
idea of its spirit, and we advise all who can find
seats or standing room to avail themselves of
the opportunity to attend the course.
Tbi District im Congress Mr. Harris, of
Va., introduced in tbe House to-day a biil to

Bcnmtora t'eaton and Rumnrr on the
Death of Mr. Vreeley.
If Mr. Cameron, who moved that the Senate
adjourn yesterday, had withdrawn that m>tton
in accordance with the request of Mr. Fenton,
the latter Senator would have said; -'I desire to
leave for New York at one o'clock, and there
fore venture upon the indulgence of the Senate
to make a motion at this time. It has reteren -e
to the great bereavement we all so deeply feel
in the death of Horace Greeley. This sad event
touches the hearts of all our people. Not on'.y
tn our land, but the struggling and the good in
all lands, of whatever rank or condition will
unite in deep and long lament over his death.
In further public recognition ot an event so im
pressive, of a grief so universal and profound, I
move that when the Senate adjourn to-day. it
adjourn to meet on Thursday next. I may
remark that several Senators desire to attend
the funeral, and it is semI-officially announced
that the President and Vice President of the
United States will leave for New York to-day for
the same purpose.
Mr.Sumner weuld have said: "Mr. President,
I have been requested to second this motion.
One word, if you please. A funeral will take
place to-morrow on which the eyesof the nation
will rb^t, while innumerable hearts 'lirob with
grief and the people everywhere learn the insta
bility of life and the commandment of charity.
It is proper, therefore, for the representatives
of the nation to suspend labor, that thev too may
be penetrated by the lessonoi the day. More tor
them than the illustrious dead is this needed.
He is gone beyond any earthly call; we remain.
Duties are always tor the "living, and now,
standing at tie open grave of Horace Greeley,
we are admonished to forget the strite of party,
and to remember only truth, country ami man
kind, to which bis honest lite was devoted. In
other days the horse and armor of the departed
chieftain have been buried in the grave where
he reposed. So. too, may we bury the ani
mosities, if not the badges, of the past. Then,
indeed, will there be victory for the dead, which
all will share."'
Tbk Meeting ok the Massachusetts
Sk>atobi*.?At Canal street Mr. Wilson got
into an omnibus. A gentleman who sat next to
the door assisted him in getting in. Senator
Wilson did not know at tirst who it wa?, when
he suddenly heard a voice?" Hallo, Wiinon!"
It was the gentleman who had helped him in.
Senator Wilson looked at him, and, beaming in
a smile, said: "Hallo, Sumner!" TUe two
friends shook hands cordially. ''Well, 1 declare,
this in a surprise," said the next vice president.
4 Well, old bov, how are you'."' the eloquent
champion of Horace Greeley at-ked. "I'm very
well, old boy; how are you?" Senator Wilson re
turned, still shaking his friend's hand. Sena
tor Sumner said he was pretty well; indeed he
was very well. His health had greatly lm
S roved. "Yes, you look a great deal better,"
enator Wilson said, delighted; "the trip to
Europe has done you good. You look a great
deal better. And now tell me all about Euro;?e.''
Senator Sumner told him everything?every
thing he told the Herald reporter the day be
fore. At the city ball the two friends got out
and went to the Tribune office, where they ha 1
another good long talk. Roth were delighted to
see each other, and not a word referring to pol
itics or the presidential election was spjkeu.?

AnotHKK L'KPt BL18MKU l.KTTKR FROM MR
Greelby In a letter to the Hon. Masou \V.
TBf pan, dated November 8, one of the very
last that Mr. Greeley wrote, he expresses great
gratitude to Mr. Tappan for going into tho
recent contest in his behalf with such zeal; ao 1
says in bis gravely jocular manner: "I !.v.
been so bitterly assailed that I hardly know
whether 1 was runuing for the Presidency or tor
the penitentiary." Mr. Greeley thus speak'of
tbe death of his wife: "In the darkest hour mv
long-suffering wife left, not too -?K>n, a? she ha 1
suffered too deeply and long. I laid her in the
r ave with hard, dry eyes. Well, I am used up.
have slept little for weeks, and mv eyes are
bard to cloce, while they mmid open again.''

Mbssaqk.?The l<ondon papers of yesterday all
publ sh the President's message, and generally
speak in complimentary terms of it. The TIiu-js
says "the message of President Grant is a sen
sible, unpretending, lucid and business-like
document, which canuot well be abridged. It
challenges no special remarks or adverse criti
cism. There is an entire freedom from all
political or sectional bitterness of partisan spirit.
The tone is catholic and kindly, and Its recom
mendations are broadly national and patriotic.'*

M r. Roosevelt said the board had given out a
portion of the work by contract, and was doing
others by dav's work, and the iniormation ne
cessary could readily be obtained.
Mr. Starkweather (Conn.), chairman of the
committee on the Diatnct. said thai the nrst
part ot the resolution was objectional, but the
latter part would involve much labor. It was
easy to ascertain by reference to the published

in the course of the next year nobody could tell

I he inquiry proposed would involve a larger
amount of work than could be done by the com
mittee this session. The committee could not
tell what Congress would do. The committee
on appropriations Lad had before tht-m thi

time betore the committee. The rep >rt ot t ie
committee had been laid betore the Mouse and
the committee and the board ot public work*
were willing to stand by that report, and were
ready to go before the committee on approb
ations. He did not wish to shut out anv lt*h?
uikjii the subject, but there had been a thor

the Mouse. The comui.iue on appropriations

Mr. lioosevelt said that wa< precise!v what he
desired to accomplish. It was necessary that
the committee on appropriations should kno?
what was only known by the board oi public
works. He wanted the House to know that he
