ELKTON, DECEMBER 11, 1860.'
The President’s Message.
The President's Message was read from
the manuscript iu both Houses of Congress
on Monday last, the first day of the session.
The document is much shorter than any
previous annual message of the President,
touching briefly hut pointedly every point
of interest which claims the President s at
tention within the hounds of this vast
country, as well as our intercourse with
foreign nations. Though brief, compara
tively as it is, wo have not space to give
the message entire, and present those parts
which are of most vital interest with a sum
mary of the less important details. The
message opens as follows:
To the Senate and House of Jlepresentalieei :
In coming before you for the first time as
Chief Magistrate ot 'this great nation, it is
with gratitude to the Giver of all good for
the many benefits we enjoy. We are bless
ed witli peace at home, and we are without
entangling alliances abroad to forhode
trouble; with a territory unsurpassed in
fertility, of an area equal to the abundant
support of five hundred millions of people,
and abounding in every variety of useful
mineral in quantity sufficient to supply the
world for generations with abundant crops.
After enumerating the vast resorces of
tho nation and glancing at its future pros
pective power and resorces, and reminding
Congress of the weighty responsibilities
resting on them and him, the message con
tinues;
Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic
magnitude, aided as it was by the sympa
thies aud assistance of nations with which
wo were at peace, eleven States of the Union
were, four years ago, left without a legal
State Government. American Commerce
was also almost driven from the seas, the
industry of almost one-half of the country
taken from tho hands of the capitalists and
placed in those of the laborer. The work
of restoring State Governments loyal to
the Union has not met with the success in
all particulars that was desired, hut has
yet been more satisfactory than could have
been reasonably anticipated.
Seven States which passed ordinances of
secession have been fully restored to their
places in the Union. The eighth (Georgia)
Yield an election, at which she ratified her
constitution, republican in form, elected a
Governor, members of Congress, a State
Legislature, and all other officers required.
The Governor was duly installed, and the
Legislature met and performed all the acts
required of them by the reconstruction acts
of Congress. Subsequently, however, in
violation of the constitution they had just
ratified, as siuce decided by tho Supreme
Court of the State, "they unseated the
colored members of the Legislature, and
admitted to seats some members who are
disqualified hy the third clause of tho four
teenth amendment to tho Constitution, one
article which they themselves had contri
buted to ratify.” Under these circum
stances, I would submit to yon whether it
would not he wise, without delay, to enact
a law authorizing the Governor of Georgia
to convene the members originally elected
to the Legislature, requiring each member
to take the oath prescribed hy tho recon
struction acts, and none to ho admitted
who are ineligible under the third clause of
the fourteenth amendment.
The means provided for paying tho pub
lic debt are deemed more than ample.
The admission of the Senators and Rep
resentatives of tho State of Virginia and
the restoration of the State to her place in
tho Union is recommended.
Among the evils growing out cf the re
bellion, and not yet referred to, is that of
an irredeemable currency. It is an evil
which I hope will receive your most earnest
attention. It is a duty, and ono of the
highest duties of Government, to secure to
the citizens a medium of exchange of fixed
and unvarying value. This implies a re
turn to a specie basis, and no substitute
for it can be devised. It should be com
menced now, and reached at the earliest
practicable moment consistent with a fair
regard to the interests of the debtor class.
Immediate resumption, if practicable,
would not he desirable. It would compel
the debtor class to pay beyond their con
tracts the premium on gold at the date of
purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and
ruin to thousands. I see but one way, and
that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem
its own paper at a fixed price whenever
presented, and to withhold from circulation
all currency so redeemed until sold again
for gold. The entire public debt could he
paid in ten years, but it is not desirable
that the people should be forced to pay it
in that time. Year by year the ability to
pay increases in a rapid rate, but the bur
den of interest ought to lie reduced as rap
idly as can be done without a violation of
contract.
The message recommends that that part
of the public debt represented hy 5-20
Bonds he refunded, at a lower rate of in
terest not exceeding 4] per cent.
The revenues of the country are greater
than the requirements, and it is recom
mended that a reduction he made.
The report of the Secretary of the Trea
sury shows the receipts of the Government
for the fiscal year ending June 30 1809, to
be $370,943,747. and the expenditures in
cluding interest, bounties. &c., to be $321,
490,597. Tho estimates for the ensuing
year are more favorable to the Government,
and will, ao doubt, show a much larger de
crease of the public debt. Tho receipts in
the Treasury beyond expenditures have ex
ceeded the amount necessary to place to
the credit of tiie sinking fund, as provided
by law. To lock up the surplus in the
Treasury and withhold it from circulation
would lead to such a contraction of the cur
rency as to cripple trade and seriously af
fect the prosperity of the country. Under
these'eircumstanees the Secretary of the
Treasury and myself heartily concurred in
the propriety of using all tho surplus cur
rency in the Treasury in the purchase of
Government bonds, thus reducing the in
terest-hearing indebtedness of the country,
and of submitting to Congress tho question
of the disposition to he made cf tiie bonds
so purchased. The bonds now held by
the Treasury amount to about $75,000,000,
including those belonging te the Sinking
Fund. I recommend that the whole be
placed to the credit of the Sinking Fund.
The office of Commissioner of I sternal
Revenue is one of tiie most arduous and re
sponsible under the Government. It falls
hut little; if any, short of a Cabinet posi
tion in its importance and responsibilities.
I would ask for it, therefore, such legisla
tion as in your .judgement will place the
office upon a footing of dignity commen
surate with its importance and with the
character and qualifications of the class of
men required to till it properly.
The President acknowledges the warm
sympathy felt hy the people and Govern
ment of tho United States for tne strug
gling patriots of Cuba; hut tho contest has
never assumed a condition which amounts
to a war in the sense of international law,
or which would show the existence of a de
facto political organization of the insur
gents sufficient to justify a recognition of
belligerency. The principle is maintained,
however, that this nation is its own judge
when to accord the rights of belligerency,
either to a people struggling to free them
selves from a government they believe to
bo oppressive, or to independent nations at
war with each other. The United States
have no disposition to interfere witli the
existing relations of Spain to her colonial
possessions on this continent. They be
lieve that in due time Spain and the Euro
pean powers will find their interest in ter
minating these relations, and establishing
their present dependencies as independent
powers, members of the family of nations.
The subject of an inter-oceanic canal, to
connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
through the Isthmus of Darien, is one in
which commerce is greatly interested.—
Instructions have been given to onr minis
terto the Republic of the United States of
Columbia to endeavor to obtain authority
for a survey hy this Government in order
to determine tiie practicability of such an
undertaking, and a charter for the right
of way to build, by private enterprise, such
a work, if the survey proves it to he prac
ticable. Towards the close of the last Ad
ministration a convention was signed at
London for the settlement of all outstand
ing claims between Great Britain and tho
United States, which failed to receive tho
advice and consent of the Senate to its rat
ification. The time and the circumstances j
attending the negotiations of that treaty
were unfavorable to its acceptance hy the
people of the United States, and its pro
visions wore wholy inadequate for the set
tlement of the grave wrongs that had been
sustained hy this Government, ns well as
hy its citizens. The injuries resulting to
the United States hy reason of the course ;
adopted by Great Britain during our late !
civil war, in tho increased rate of insurance,
in tho diminution of exports and imports, j
and other obstructions to domestic Indus- |
try and production; in its effect upon the
foreign commerce of tho country; in the
decrease and transfer to Great Britain of
our commercial marine; in the prolonga
tion of the war. and in the increased cost,
both in treasure and in lives, if its suppres
sion could not he adjusted and satisfied as
ordinary commercial claims which continu
ally arise between commercial nations; and
yet the convention treated these simply as
such ordinary claims, from which they dif
fer more widely in tho gravity of their
character than in the magnitude of their
amount. Great even as is that difference,
not a word was found in the treaty, and
not an inference could he drawn from it,
to remove the sense of tho unfriendliness
of the course of Great Britan in onr strug
gle for existence, which had so deeply and
universally impressed itself upon the people
of this country. Believing that a conven
tion thus misconceived in its scope and in
adequate in its provisions would not have
produced tho hearty, cordial settlement of
pending questions which alone is consis
tent with tho relations which I desire to
have established between the United States
and Great Britain, I regarded the action of
tho Senate in rejecting tho treaty to have
been wisely taken, in the interest of peace,
ami as a necessary step in tho direction of
a perfect and cordial friendship between
tho two countries. A sensitive people, con
scious of their power, are more at ease
under a great wrong wholly unatoned than
under the restraint of .settlement which
satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor
their graves sense of tho grievance they
have sustained. The rejection of tho trea
ty was followed by a state of public feeling
on both sides which I thought not favora
ble to an immediate attempt at renewed
negotiations. I accordingly so instructed
the minister of tho United States to Great
Britain, and found that views in this regard
were shared hy her Majesty’s minister. 1
hope that the time may soon arrive when
the two governments can approaoh the
solution of this momentous question with
an appreciation of what is duo to the rights,
dignity, and honor of each, and with tho
determination not only to remove the caus
es of complaint in tho past, hut to lay the
foundation of a broad principle of public
law which will prevent future difficulties
and tend to a firm and continued peace and
friendship. This is now the only grave
question which tho United States have
with any foreign nation.
A rnewal of the Reciprocity Treaty be
tween the United States and Canada, is
opposed on the ground that Canada is
alone benefited hy such a treaty.
It having come to my knowledge that a
corporate company organized under the
British law proposed to land upon the
shores of the United States and to operate
there a submarine cable under a concession
from his Majesty the Emperor of the
French, of an exclusive right, for twenty
years of communication between the shores
of Franco and the United States, with the
very objectionable feature of subjecting
all messages conveyed thereby to the scru
tiny autl control of the French government,
I caused the French ami British legations
at Washington to be made acquainted
with the probable policy of Congress on
the subject, as foreshadowed by tho bill
which passed the Senate in March last.—
This drew from tho representatives of the
company an agreement to accept as the
basis of their operations the provisions of
that hill, or of such other enactment on
the subject as might he passed during the
approaching session of Congress; also, to
use their influence to secure from tho French
government a modification of their conces
sion so as to permit the landing upon
French soil of any cable belonging to any
company incorporated hy the authorities of
the United States, or of any State in the
Union, and on their part not to oppose the
establishment of any such cable. In con
sideration of this agreement, I directed the
withdrawal of all opposition by the United
States authorities to tho landing of the
cable and to the working of it until the
meeting of Congress. I regret to say that
there has been no modification made in the
company’s concession, nor, so far as I can
learn, have they attempted to secure one.—
Their concession excludes the capital and
the citizens of the United States from com
petition upon the shores of France. I rec
oin mended legislation to protect the rights
of citizens of the United States, as well as
the dignity and sovereignty of the nation
against such an assumption.
Onr manufactures are increasing with
wonderful rapidity under the encourage
mont which they now receive. With the
improvement in machinery already effected
and still increasing, causing machinery to
take the place of skilled labor to a largo
extent, our imports of many articles must
fall off largely within a very few years.
Gu my assuming the responsible duties
of Chief Magistrate of the United States,
it was with the conviction that three things
were essential to its peace, perpetuity, and
fullest developments.
First among these is strict integrity in
fulfilling all our obligations.
Second. To secure protection to the per
son and property of tho citizen of the
United States in each and every portion of
our common country, wherever he may
choose to move, without reference to origi
nal nationality, religion, color, or politics,
demanding of him only obedience to the
laws and proper respect for the rights of
others.
Third. Union of all tho States, with
equal rights, indestructible hy any consti
tutional means.
The repeal of the Tenure of Office Law is
asked hy the President. The management
of the Indian tribes hy agents selected hy
the Society of Friends has proven thus far
most satisfactory.
Tho report of tho Secretary of War
shows the expenditures of the War Depart
ment for the year ending the 30th of June,
liSO;', to he *80,014,042, of which $23,882,310
was disbursed in the payment of debts con
tracted during the war, and is not charge
able to current army expenses. Ilis esti
mate of $:M,i)31,031 for the expenses of tho
army for the next fiscal year is as low as it
is believed can ho relied on.
The report of tho Secretary of the Inte
rior shows that the quantity of the public
lands disposed of during the year ending
30th of June, 18G0, was 7,006,000, exceed
ing that of the preceding year hy 1.010,409
acres. Of this amount 2,8!)!),544 acres were
sold for cash, and 2,737,305 acres entered
under the he ncstcad law.
During the year ending the 30th of Sep
tember, 1809, the Patent Office issued 13,-
702 patents, and its receipts were $680,389
—being $213,920 more than the exjiendi
tures.
The report of the Postmaster General
furnishes a clear and comprehensive exhibit
of the operations of the Postal service aud
of the financial condition of the Postoflicfc
Department. The ordinary postal revenues
for the year ending June 30th, 1809, amoun
ted to $18,344,510, and tho expenditures
$23,098,131 ; showing an excess of expen
ditures over receipts of $5,353,520. The
excess of expenditures over receipts for the
previous year amounted to $0,437,992. —
The increase of revenues for 1809 over
those of 1808 was $3,051,909, and tho in
crease of expenditures was $937,539. The
increased revenue in 1809 exceeded tho in
creased revenue of 1808 hy 900,306, and
the increased expenditure in 1809 was
$2,52t,5i0 less than tho increased expendi
ture in 1808, showing by comparison this
gratifying feature of improvement, that
while the increase of receipts in 1808 was
$2,438,535, tho increase of expenditures
over tho increase cf receipts in 1809 was
$1,084,371.
Your attention is respectfully called to
the recommendations made hy the Post
master General for authority to change the
rate of compensation to tho main trunk
railroad lines for tho r services in carrying
the mails ; for having post route maps exe
cuted ; for reorganizing and increasing the
efficiency of tlie special agency service ; for
increase of the mail service in the Pacific
and for establishing mails under the (lag of
the Union on tho Atlantic, and most espe
cially do we call for your attention to his
recommendation for the total abolition of
the franking privilege. This is an abuse
from which no ono receives a commensur
ate advantage. It reduces the receipts for
postal set vice from 25 to 30 per cent., and
largely increases the service to lie perform
ed. The method by which postage should
tie paid upon public matters is sot forth
fully iu the report of the Postmaster Gen
eral.
An increase of tho salary of the Justices
ol the Supreme Court is recommended.
Texas.— The first reports of the elec
tion in Texas which reached us wore un
favorable to the Republican tickat, but
when the returns were received the aspect
of affairs were changed. Tho Republicans
have not only defeated Jack Hamilton hut

Congress, and perhaps all of them, and car
ried the Legislature hy a larger majority.

bed of u number of Ikxklh, amounting in value to nearly
$20,000.
The Bank is situated in a room in the new Town Hall,
and the thieves effected an entrance hy prying open u
back window. In the Bank were two firee-proof safes,
in one of which was the money belonging to the Bank, i
and in the other books, papers, Ac., and a number of I

of U. S. bonds, belonging to J. U. Cazier, and &&U in I'.
S. securities, belonging to Miss A. J. Simpson, a school
teacher. The robbery is supposed to have been commit
ted about 2 o’clock on Friday morning, os a noise was
heard in the building about tlmt time. It is supposed
that the thieves became frightened and left in a hurry,
as their tools, (which were of the kind used by profes
sional burglars.) were left behind, and also a SI,OOU Paci

Tho Circuit Court adjourned on Thursday, the 2d, after
a session of nwnrly four weeks. From the report of the

$219.10.
The railroad continues to be the all-absorbing topic of

PROPOSALS FOR MAIL LOCKS.
Post Office Department. Washington,
October IC, 1869.
SEALED PROPOSALS for furnishing Mail Dicks nnd
Keys of new kinds, to he substituted for the Locks- and
Keys now used on the United States Mails, will he re
ceived at this Department until 9 o’clock, a. m., the lid
•lay of FEBRUARY, IS7O. It is desirable to obtain
Locks and Keys of a new construction for the exclusive
use of the Unite<l States Mails, nnd, if practicable, in
vented expressly for that purpose. As the exposure f a
model Lock and Key to public examination would
impair, if not destroy, its utility for the mails, the De
partment prescribes no model for bidders, but relies for
its selection on the specimens of mechanical skill and
ingenuity which a fair competition among inventors,
hereby invited, may develop. It is sufficient to describe
the principal requisites of a Mail Lock, as follows; Self-
Locking uniformity, security, lightness, strength, dura
bility, novelty of construction, ami facility of usj. Two
kinds of Locks'and Keys; one of brass and tho other of
iron, different in exterior, foi;in, and interior, construc
tion or arrangement, are required ; and Propisals should
specify separately the price of each brass lock, each key
for same, each iron lock and each key fur same. Dupli
cate samples of each kind of locks and Keys proposed
are required to bo submitted with the proposals; one of
each sample lock to bo rivited up and finished, and
another to bo open or unrivited, so that its internal
structure and arrangement may easily be examined.—
Every sample should he plainly marked with the bidder’s
name, and, if the sumo or any part of it be covered by a
patent, the date of such patent, nnd the name of the
patentee must also lie attached thereto.
The internal plan or arrangement of the locks offered,
and the particular shape of the key requisite to open
them, must not be like any now or heretofore in use.
They must Iki warranted not to infringe upon or con
flict with any patented invention of which the bidder is
not the patentee. Preference will be given to a lock,
the key of which has not been exposed to general obser
vation or been publicly described, disclosed, or suggorded.
A decision on the various specimens and proposals will
be made on or before the 3d day of March, IS7O, uml,
unless the Postmaster General shall deem it to be for tin*
interests of the Department to reject all the Proposals
and Spe< imens submitted under this advertisement, (a
right hereby expressly reserved for him.) contracts will
be entered into as soon thereafter as practicable, with
the succi ssful bidder whose locks shall ho adopted, for
furnishing similar locks and keys for four years, as they
may Ire required and ordered. If mutually agreed to in
writing by tho contractor and the Postmaster General
for the time being, not less than six months before its
expiration, the contract may be extended and continued
for an additional term of four yours. But on and after
the expiration of either term of tho contract, or on and
after its rightful annulment at any time, the Postmaster
General shall have tho right to contract w ith or employ
any other party to furnish the name, or any other kind
of locks and keys; and if he shall deem proper, to de
mand and receive from the late or defaulting contractor
all finished or unfinished keys and the internal parts < f
the locks contracted for. and all die*, gauges, and de
signs. (which would enable others to make or forgo such
locks <>r keys.) in the possession of such contractor, who,
after their surrender to the Department shall be paid f..r
the same, nt such price us may be ascertained by fair
appraisement.
Tho contractor must agree nnd be able to furnish, if
required and ordered. 20.000 Brass Locks and 3.000 Brass
Keys within three months from the time of entering into
contract, and 80.000 Iron Locks and GO.UOO Iron Kcvs
within ten months from such time. But tho Postmaster
General will reserve the right to increase or diminish, as
tho wants or interests of the service may demand, the
quantities of tho Locks and Keys al*ove specified, with a
proportionate allowance of time to furnish them.
All the Dicks furnished by the contractor must le
warranted to keep in good working order for two years
in the ordinary use of tho service, when not subjected to
obvious violence; such as become defective within that
time to be replaced with perfect Locks without charge.
All the Loeks furnished under contract are to b, each,
distinctly marked “ U. S. Mail,’’ in either sunk or raised
letters, ami nil the Keys are to ho numbered in tho nat
ural order ; each Key having its appropriate number dis
tinctly stamped upon one side of tho bow and “ U. S.

containing not more than two hundred locks each. The j

duly and specially authorized in each case, to take charge
of and convey the same from the cun tractor’s manufac

either as to furnishing the supplies ordered within a
reasonable time, or ns to guarding the manufacture of
the Mail Locks and Kays w ith due privacy, integrity, and
care.
No Proposal wall therefore be accepted if not accom
panied witli a bund oi the penal sum of Twenty Thous
and Dollars, duly executed by the proposed sureties, I
(whose responsibility must be certified by a.fudge of a 1
Court of Record nearest to their place of residence, at- |
tested by the Clerk of such Court under the seal thereof,) ;
and conditioned for their becoming responsible as sure- |
tics on the required bond for the fulfilment of the con- {
tract, in case such Proposals shall ho accepted. The
manufacture of Mail L" ks and Keys is, of necessity, a
highly important and delicate trust which tho Depart
ment will confide to no bidder whose Proposals are not
also acemn pan led with testimonials of good character. j
In deciding on the |*roposals and Specimens, the Post- 1
master General may deem it expedient to select the .
Brass Lin k of one bidder and the Iron Lock of another. ;
He. therefore, reserves the right of contracting with dif
ferent individuals for such different kinds of lax-ks as he
may select.
Proposals should be carefully sealed nnd addressed to
the - Second Assistant Postnuister General,” and endorsed
