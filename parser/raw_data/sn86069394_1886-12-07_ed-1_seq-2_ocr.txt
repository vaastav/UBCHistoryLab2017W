The nine-mile railroad from Glaa

Editor O'SuIlivan, of tho Commcr

there were so many other marriages

I Henderson Gleaner.
The office of superintendent of pub
lie instruction requires for the suc
cessful discharge of its duties a man
of practical sense, business sagacity,
executive ability and of broad, com
prehensive views of the aims and ap
plication of educational system. With
our large school per capita, it is la
meutuble that we have such a defect
ive system of common schools. The
oublo is there has uever been had a
clear view of our educational wants
and necessities. We need at the
head of our common school system a
man who knows Kentucky and Ken
luckians, who kuows the demands of
the hour, who has an intuitive con
ccptiou of and tho executive ability
to apply the remedial agencies. ThiB
no time for experimenting with
nice theories. We want a man who
knows what to do, how to do it and
who will do it and who will do it
quick. Such a niau is Prof. J. W.
Rust, of Hopkinsville. He Is literal
ly an educator from "way back."
He was born in Logaucounty, feu.
14, 1819. Tho first fifteen years of
his life were spent on a farm. Early
in life the ambition to be and to do
something became manifested iu him.
A few mouths at a time in school,
studying half-worn textbooks by the
dim light of the old log lire after the
day's work was done; catching a
point hero and there and gathering
inspiration from his very obscurity ;
at first a simple teacher in the old
Held school, then a wanderer with
out friends or money and only a
smattering of grammar and arithme
tic with which to keep soul and body
together ; another decade and he is at
the head of au academy, then the
president of a college, and now, ripe
with experience and honor, he i6
contributing the wisdom of his life
to the cause of education. Only thir
teen months did he receive instruc
tion, over fifty years has he beeu au
instructor. One college and two uni
versities have conferred honorary de
grees upon him who never entered a
college until called on to preside over
one. Such a man, we say, knows
experimentally tho educational status
of Kentucky. He has watched our
development along this line with the
keen eye of a practical observer for
over fifty years. He knows what ed
ucation is as few men know. He is
not burdened with the chimerical
schemes of theoretical educators. lie
sees what the masses need and his
experience furnishes the wisdom to
supply promptly tho demand. He is
to education in Kentucky what Dan
iel Boone was to pioneer life, ami Pe
tor Cartwright to early Christianty
Ho is the man to take hold of and
manage our common schools. He
can do right at tho work and will do
it in a quick, common sense way
The reform we need is less red tape
and more plain, common sense work,
Prof. Rust has received tho most
complimentary solicitations to make
tho race. From all parts of the state
his friends most earnestly have ap
pealed to him to enter the contest,
hut, so far as we know, he has never
intimated his intention or desire,
Tliis is one of the cass in which the
"office should seek the man," and if
we read the signs aright there is a
regular ground-swell for Prof. Rust.
Should he intimate, his intention of
running, it is doubtful if bis nomina
tion could be headed off. lie is pre
imiuently a man for the people, such
a man as could take hold of popular
education in Kentucky and push it
to the highest possible standard in
the shortest possible time.
