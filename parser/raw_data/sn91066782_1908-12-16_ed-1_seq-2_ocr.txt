Abel Kincaid of Biehmond, the remains
of whose body were found scattered along
the Maine Central railroad tracks and
which were identified lat Monday night.
The cmcials place the time of kincaid a

one of the latest train in the evening,
probably the freight train due a little
after 11 o'clock, that stroek him.

Washington, Dec. 16 Tho House In
surgents wont out yesterday in a prelim
inarv ckirmich over the revision of the
rule, of that body, ,
Representative Gardner of Massachu
setts moved that the committee on for
fign affairs be discharged from further
consideration of uls resolution calling on
the state department to secure informs
tion concerning proposed chani'ei in the
rules of the British llouso of Commons.
On a yea and nay vote, Mr. Gardner's
motion was adopted, 14 to 131, the IHm
ocrats voting with the Republican insur
gents.
Then Mr. Gardner moved an amend
ment to the resolution, providing for tho
appointment of a aommittee of live He
publicans and three Democrats to take
under consideration the revision of the
(louse rules and to report not later than
ten. 1, liHW.
ltonreseiitativa Dalzell made a noint
of order against the amendment, and was
sustained by hrM-aker Cannon. Re pre
sentative Gardner took an appeal from
the chair, and another yea and nay vote
was liegun.
The move of Gardner was a shrewd
trick, which took Speaker Cannon and
the Republican leaders completely by
surprise. The old guard, however, rai
ned and began a desperate fight. The
passage of the Gardner resolution would
nave put the question of the revision of
tue rules squarely bafore the Houe, and
would have presaged the defeat o,the
speaker on this issue.
On roll call, the motion of Representa
tive Tayne to table the motion of Repre
sentative Gardner appealing from the de
cision of the chair, was adopted, 149 to
uo. au tne iMas.-ai'lmselts delegation
voting supported the machine, except
Representatives Gardner and Peters,
Mr. Gardner then addressed the Houe.
He began an attack on the rules, on the
committee on rules, when a point of or
der by Representative Dalzell shut him
off. Gardner a fight had failed when he
was within sight of victory.
The outeome showed the strength of
the speaker. Townsend and Hepburn,
two of the leading insurgents against the
rules, evaded the issue and refused to
support Gardner.

can be produced in competition with
wood pulp wa'thfl purport of a qualified
report that Vt. 11. T. Galloway of the
bureau of plant industry of the depart
ment of agriculture made to the House
committee on agriculture yesterday when
he appeared before it to account for the
disposition of the appropriation given
to the department for experiments along
this line. lr. Galloway said that labor
atory teRt seemed to warrant the con
clusion that print paper could be manu
factured from corn stalks in competition
with wood pulp, adding that a commer
cial test would soon be made by a mill
in Jlsinr. Jle explained that If the ven
ture proved a success it would be due
to the production of a by-product, a
coarse quality of molasses such as i im
ported and is used in large degree, es
pecially in the South, to feed cattle and
mules. The laboratory tests indicated,

habit is so firmly established as in the
United States. In this country the ma
jority of the eople are addicted to the
too frequent use of medicinal prcjvara
tions containing habit-forming drugs.
No mater how slight an ailment otte may
have, every friend he meets advises him
to take this or that remedy. Such ad
vice is often followed and as the rt'ult
the person seeking a remedy takes prep
arations which in many cases transform
liim into a drug fiend."
