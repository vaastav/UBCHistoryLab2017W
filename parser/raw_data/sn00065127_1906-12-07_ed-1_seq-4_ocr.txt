FOB PRESIDENT 1908
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
By Will of the People.
Committeeman Thoraon Speaks.
Under the above heading the Sioux
Falls Press reviews the Kittredge
farewell address and we believe
proves to the satisfaction ot any un
biased mind that Senator Kittredge
made another blander in trying to
convince the people of this state that
truth is a He, because anyone familiar
with the Inside history of the last
legislature knows that the Kittredge
men defeated the primary petition on
orders sent by him from Washington.
The Press reviews the matter modest
ly and truthfully as follows:
"There is general discussion in
South Dakota and in the contiguous
states of the prepared statement put
forth by Senator Kittredge coincident
with his departure for Washington
and published simultaneously in the
local machine organ and Minneapolis,
St. Paul and Sioux City papers.
It is a statement calculated
evoke discussion, containing as it
does a belated recantation of some of
the •sophistries of the senator's politi
cal past.
In
this, the first declaration or his
position on certain important issues
that he lias designed to bestow upon
the public. Mr. Kittredge expresses
the opinion that the people will be
slow to believe that be or his friends
contemplate opposition to his party's
plans relating to legislation during
the coming winter. He says there is
no truth in such a supposition and no
foundation for it.
Upon this feature of the case the
evidence is against him. There Is a
foundation broad and long for the
supposition in the course pursued by
the active members of the Kittredge
faction during the campaign leading
up to the June convention and the
campaign leading up to the Novem
ber election.
Upon the subject of this evidence,
Tom Thoraon, of Canton, a former
secretary of state and now member
of the republican state central com
mittee, speaks in a Thanksgiving
Interview In the Sioux City Tribune,
saying:
"Kittredge never showed his bead
in the republican state headquarters
during the last campaign, although
they were located In bis home town.
"He had a oompalgn of his own to
conduct, and we have absolute proof
that he went into deals with stal
warts and democrats to beat Insur-
Koping
ent candidates for the legislature,
even after the walloping he
got at the state convenjblon to defeat
the will of the people and his party."
Mr. Thoraon speaks as a member of
the republican committee, entrusted
with the condoct of the campaign,
when he says: "We have absolute
proof that he -went into deals with
stalwarts and democrats to beat in
surgent candidates for the legisla
ture."
That was the information gathered
at republican headquarters in Sioux
Falls during the progress of the cam
paign and upon the authority of
headquarters it was used by the few
newspapers of the state that espoused
the cause of the republican commit
tee, acting as the representative of
the party.
Mr. Thoraon, member of the repub
lican committee, declared in the
Sioux City interview that "Kittredge
oannot fool the people of South Dako
ta any longer"—that "he is making
this declaration because he knows
that he must, step out of the party if
he does not make some show of lining
up with the party platform"-that
"he will be retired to private life two
years hence, when his successor is
elected."
These are the statements of a mem
ber of the republican organization—
of the state central committee. It
will be conceded that the faith of the
party in the party's senator is a
minus quantity when one of its
authorised representatives takes so
strong a position against the sincerity
of the senator and against his con
tinuance in the high office to which
he was once chosen in the name of
the party.
Mr. Thoraon declines to accept Mr.
Kittredge's statement that be took
no part In the conspiracy that result
ed In the overthrow of the petition
for a primary election law. He says:
"This will be amusing to those who
were at Pierre and knew of the delay
while a telegram was sent to Kitt
redge at Washington asking for ad
The Boor leaders of the senate
•Ice.
^at and the measure was killed.
Everybody knew it was the dictum of
Kittredge."
In touching upon this phase of the
question, Mr. Thoraon reflects the
common belief and the common be
lief is well sustained. The Minneha
ha county delegation in the last legis
lature was at flret in favor of the sub
mission of the primary bill to a vote.
The delegation, with the exception
of one member, afterwards came out
In opposition to the submission of the
bill and when it was stated in a meet
sing of the delegation that the people
petitioned for Mich submission,
jj one of the members of the delegation
said that Senator Kittredge was op
pond to the primary bill and that he
was then to represent Mr. Kittredge
and not the people. I
The evidence Is therefore quite con
^Titwing that there was some Interfer-
a®?
IF#'
ence from Washington with the free
course of the primary election peti
tion and bill.
Mr. Thomson, of Dell Rapids, a
member of the house for Minnehaha
county, a friend of the primary
principle, is authority for the state
ments in relation to the attitude of
the Minnehaha delegation and its
change of intention and lie has given
The Press authority to use the infor
mation.
It appears, therefore, that the Min
nehaha county members of the legis
lature believed that Mr. Kittredge
wanted the legislature to defeat the
primary election petition and bill.
Everything Denied.
The Sioux Falls Press takes a fall
out of Senator Kittredge's farewell
message, and Editor Bowen handles
the subject In his usual unvarnished
language. He says: "In his farewell
address to the Argus Leader, Senator
Kittredge denies all charges of which
lie lias been convicted by a jury of
the voters of South Dakota. Either
the jury was wrong or the senator is
wrong.
While he was on trial, he made no
plea of not guilty, but fought his way
through the court of public opinion
down to the defeats of June and No
vember.
Now that a final verdict has been
rendered in favor of all the reforms
opposed by his combination of politi
cians, he being the dictator, he de
clares that be has been greatly mis
represented in the prevalent supposi
tion that he opposed the victorious
issues.
It would have been asupurb exhibi
tion of political sagacity had he put
forth the same declaration at the
time the opposing faction took pos
session of the June convention.
Had he then notified his party that
he was in sympathy with the issues
that bad prevailed and that he yield
ed allegiance to the demands of the
majority voice of the convention, he
would have placed himself in harmon
nious relation to the party and would
have been accepted as one of the pro
moters of its success.
But in spite of his implied denial,
the opinion has prevailed that he was
opposed to the demands of the plat
form of the party and to the success
of the faction that won the party vic
tory at the polls.
He participated in none of the work
of the campaign, holding himself
Aloof
from the party organ iza ton and re
fusing the counsel and influence that
is expected from one whom the party
had honored to the limit of its abil
ity- "v-i
The organization went through the
campaign under the belief that it was
contending against his influence, to
gether with the influence of the dem
ocratic party, although there was no
suspicion of an alliance between the
two.
The only activity displayed by Mr.
Kittredge during the campaign was
centered in Minnehaha county and
here it was arrayed against the fac
tion of the republican party that had
gained control of the state at large.
Mr. Kittredge will have to excuse
the members of what was the insur
gent faction of the republican party
If they still refuse to believe that he
was loyal to the principles espoused
by them and carried to a successful
Issue by their unaided effort- even
though he now declares tliat he has
in no way opposed^them.
His course during the campaign
speaks more loudly than his profes
sions now that the conflict is at an
end.':
President Roosevelt's message is
before congress, and be gives the na
tion's lawmakers plenty of good ad
vise. He covers the field of labor ex
haustively, and reviews the condi
tions existing between capital and
labor, including women and children
and employer's liability.
On the question of withdrawing all
coal lands from settlement he says:
"It is not wise that the nation
should alternate its remaining coal
lands. I have temporarily withdrawn
from settlement all the lands which
the geological survey has indicated as
containing, or in all probability con
taining coal. The question, however,
can be properly settled only by legis
laton which, in my judgement,
should provide for the withdrawal of
these lands from sale or from entry,
save in certain especial circum
stances. Toe ownership would then
remain In the United States, which
should not, however, attempt to
work them, but permit them to be
worked by private individuals under
a royalty system, the government
keeping such control as to permit it
to see that no excessive price was
charged customers."
He takes advanced ground in favor
of placing greater power in the hands
of the national government for the
control of corporations under in
ter-state commerce, and favors a
graduated Inheritance and Income
tax, and logically proves the justice
of such legislation in a concise discus
sion on the subject.
Marriage and divorce, he believes,
should be regulated by national laws,
because the different state laws per
mit scandals and abuses, and such
laws as might be passed by oongress
would wipe out polygamy forever.
He favors a shipping bill and asks
that citizenship be granted to the
people of Porto Rico, and states that
the provisional government in Cuba
will end with the establishment of a
peaceful and orderly home govern
ment.
The message is just such a docu
ment as one would expect from a man
who believes in a square deal, from a
man who not only believes in justice
but wants to see justice done to
rich and poor alike. He tells con
gress in plain language what be
thinks would benefit the country and
he will undoubtedly help congress to
solve the problems so lucidly discus
sed for its nenefit.
Traveling Grocery Fake*.
A couple of peddlers, it is reported,
are engaged in traveling over this
county taMng orders for groceries and
supplying those who buy with such
stuff as may be sent them. A ped
dler's order generally includes a lot of
stuff that the buyer has to take to
.11 the order which is of little use to
him and often of no practical value
to anybody. M»t peddlers put in
enough pepper and other like stuff to
do a family a year or two, and by this
means fool the buyer and gloss over
an order that costs farmers from 15
to 25 per cent more than his average
order would cost him at the home
store.
We once saw a car load of grocery
orders at Parker and it was the
dirtiest looking stuff we had ever seen
in the old territory when bacon and
mud were no strangers. One order
contained 5 pounds of pepper, and the
stuff might have gone through a pep
per mill.
Men who are out peddling now are
selling old adulterated stuff because
the pure food law goes into effect
January first, and the big stocks on
band in jobbing houses must be dis
posed of at any price.
Home merchants should meet this
faking trade by publishing their groc
ery prices with a guarantee for qual
ity. So long as our home merchants
keep still and indicate by their si
lence that they don't care about groc
ery trade so long will these out of the
town ducks waddle around and fool
people.
The newspapers are powerless to
head off these fakes so long as the
home merchants say nothing.
"Why should the spirit of mortal
be proud"—Kit.
There seems to be some trouble
with the Homesteak miners.
State Senator Dowdell will be no
corporation or machine man. He is
built on different lines.
Sioux Falls is getting some justly
earned hard knocks over her lawless
ness and crime record.
Congress is doing business again,
and there wili be a few Rooseveltian
flank movements that will surprise
the standpatters.
That farewell address of Senator
Kit's seems to meet with contempt
from all who love the truth. As a
blunderer in politics he has few
equals.
The suggestion of the Leader some
time ago that the membership of the
supreme court be increased from
three to five has found favor in all
quarters. Every lawyer in the state
knows that the supreme court is over
worked and not able to keep up with
the increasing business that comes
before it.
The man who finds fault with the
President's order disbanding the sold
iers of the 25tb Infantry, has no
knowledge of discipline. Soldiers be
longing to this regiment "shot up"
Sturgis once, and they escaped pun
ishment. When troops, white, black
or red become murderers through riot
punishment must be swift and com
plete. If the innocent elect to go
with the guilty, it is their own busi
ness.
Foot Ball and Basket Ball.
The Canton and Hawarden high
school foot ball teams played a nice
clean game on Thanksgiving day, and
the Canton and Hawarden basket
bailers also played a very interesting
game at the conclusion of the foot
ball contest. The football boys were
evenly matched as they struggled
manfully for tbegreat part of an hour
to get a touch down or a goal kick
but both failed.
Tom Yates of the Hawarden team
got his shoulder blade broken near
the close of the second half and was
taken to Dr. Corrigan's office.
The playing of Horace Ringheim,
Clauds Coons and Millard Kennedy
was especially fine and the entire
team played well.
The basket ball game proved very
attractive and the big crowd enjoyed
it. The Hawarden young ladies, it
may be stated, had little practice be
fore coming to Canton and they were
no match for Canton's swift team.
The playing of Edna Lee, Marie
Juel and Edith Thompson was re
markably good, Anna Lunder and
Ethel Minor, as guards, did splendid
work and Canton Is proud of them.
Score 36 to 3 in favor of Canton.
Supt. W. W. Collins, of the Cham
berlain-San born division, was over the
line the latter part of last week, and
was making inquiries as to supplies of
coal and feed in the towns west of
tbe river, as a precaution against the
possibility of isolation by snow block
ades Parties in from the west end
yesterday report that at the present
time the railroad extension is graded
and ironed thirty miles west of Mur
do, or within two miles of Belvidere.
Reports from the Rapid City end in
dicate that grading and ironing ex
tend fifteen miles east from that
place. Probably eighty per cent of
the intervening distance Is graded.
In our opinion, and despite predic
tions to the contrary, we do not look
for trains to be running from Cham
berlain to Rapid City sooner than
midsummer of next year.—Chamber
lain Democrat.

Arrangements have not been com
