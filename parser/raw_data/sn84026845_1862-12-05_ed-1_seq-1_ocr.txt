[OFFICIAL COPT.]
Hkadquartbbs of tub Army, ")
Washington, Nov. 23, 1862. /
To this Gen. Halleck returned the fol
lowing reply:
4i Washington, Aug. G, 1802.
Major'General McQldlan, Commandingtete.t
Berkeley, Va.:
General, your telegraph of yesterday
was received this morning, and 1 immedi
ately telegraphed a brief reply, promising
to write you more fully by mail. You,
General, certainly could not have been
more pnioed at receiving my order than I
was at the necessity of issuing it, I was ad
vised by high officials, in whose judgment
I have great confidence, to made the order
immediately on my arrival here, but I de
termined not to do so until I could learn
your wishes from a personal interview, and
even after that interview I tried every
means in my power to avoid withdrawing
your army, and delayed the decision as long
as I dared to delay it. I' assure yon. Gen
eral, Ht wa9 riot haSty aud inconsiderate,
but on the contrary it caused me more anx
iety than any other of my life, but after full
and mature consideration of all the pros
and cons,lwa8reluctantly forced tothecon
elusion that the order must be issued. There
was to my mind noalternative. Allow me to
allude to a few of the facts of the esse. You,
and your officers at one of the interviews
estimated the enemy's forces in and around
Ricbmoud at two hundred thousand men.
Since then you und others report that they
have received and are receiving large re
enforcements from the South. Gen. Pope's
army, now covering Washington, is only
forty thousand; your effective force is only
about ninety thousand. You are thirty
miles from Richmond, and General Pope
eighty or ninety, with the enemy directly
between you ready to fall with his superior
numbers upon one or the other, as he may
elect; neither can reinforce the other in
case ot such an attack. If Gen. Pope's
army be demanded to reinforce you, Wash
ington, Maryland and Pennsylvania would
be left uncovered aud exposed. If your
force be reduced to strengthen Pope, you
would be too weak to hold the position you
uow occupy, should the enemy turn round
and attack you in full force. In other
words, the old army of tho Potomac is split
iu pieces, with the entire force of the ene
my directly between thqm,... They can't be
united by tan^, without exposing,both to
destruction ; and yet they m^st be unite 1.
To "send Pope's force by water to the Pen
insula is, under present eircutrstances, a
military impossibility. Tho only alterna
tive is to send the forces on the Peninsula
| to some point by water, say Fredericksburg,
I where the two armies can be united.
Let me now allude to some of tbe objec
tions which you have urged. You say to
withdraw from the present position will
cause the certain demoralisation of the
7&SUi wljiplrU now jn excellent discipline
and condition. I cannot understand why
a simple change of position to a now, and
by no means distant base will demoralize
nn army in, excellent discipline, unless the
officers themselves assist in tbe demoralisa
tion, which 1 am satisfied they will not.
Your change of front from your extreme
right at Hanover C. H., to yourpresent po
sition (Marover thirty miles; but I have
not heard that it demoralized your troops,
notwithstanding tbe severe losses thejr sus
tained la effecting it.
A new base on the Rappahannock, at
Fredericksburg, brings yon within about
sixty miles of Richmond, and secures a re
ecforement of 40,000 or 50,000 fresh and
disciplined troops. The change, with
sach advantages, will. I think, if prop
erly represented to JQur army, encourage
rather" than demoralise your troops.
Moreover, you yourself suggested that
a junction might be effected at
YorjUown ; but that a flank march across
the Peninsula would be more hazardous
than to retire to Fortress Monroe. You
will remember that Yorktowa is two or
three miles further from Richmond than
Fredericksburg isj besides the latter is be
tween Richmond and Washington, and cov
ers Washington from any attack by thfl
enemy. The political effect of tbe with
drawal may at first be unfavorable; but I
think the public are beginning to under
stand its necessity and that tbey will have
much more confidence in a united army
than its separate fragments. But yon will
reply, why not reinforce here so that I can
strike Richmond from my present position.
To do this you said at onr interview that
you required 50,000 additional troops. I
told you that it waa impossible to give you
so tnaoy. You finally said that yon would
have some chance of success with 20,000,
but you afterward telegiaphed to me that
you would require 35,000, as the enemy was
being largely reinforced. If your estimate
Of the enemy's strength waa correct, your
requisition waa perfectly reasonable j but
it was utterly impossible to fHl it until
troops could be enlisted and organised,
which would require several weeks. To
reach your army in its present position,
until it could be so reinforced, would al
most destroy it in that climate. Tbe
mouths of August and September are al
most fatal to whites who live on that part
of James river, And even after yon go,t the
^-enforcement! asked for, y?u most reduce
Fort Darling and the river batteries before
fortification* would not require asmMh ??
those atTorktown. This delay might not
only be fatal to.. tbe. bcaj^ti otjo^r.axmr.
but In tbe meantime Gen. Pop*'* (<rc*a
would be expoted to the beary Moari o'f
flie enemy, without tbe slightest hope of
assistance from you.
In regaiAto the demoralising effect ot a
withdrawal (torn the Peninsula to the Rap
10,4 ifCni&si V &l.l' "*
pahannock, I mast remark that a large
oumber of your highest officers, indeed
most of those whose opinions have been
reported to me, are decided!/ in favor of
the movement. Several of those who orig
inally advocated the line of the Peninsula
now advise its abandonment. I have not
inquired, and do not need to know, by
whose advice, or for what reasons, the Ar
my of the Potomac was separated into two
parts, with the enemy between them. I
must take things as I find them. I find
the forces divided, and I wish to unite
them. Only ooe feasible plan has been
presented for doing this. If yon or any
one else bad presented a better one, I cer
tainly should have adopted it; but all of
your plans require reinforcements, which
it in impossible to give you. It is very
easy to ask for reinforcement, but it is not
easy to give them when you have no disposi
tion of troops atyonr command. I have writ
ten very plainly, as I understand the case,
and 1 hope you will give me credit for hav
ing considered the matter, although I have 1
arrived at different conclusions from your J
own.
Very respectfully your ob't serv't,
[Signed] H. W. Qallkck,
General-in-Chief.
Halleck states that about this time he
received news of a heavy rebel force pre
paring to attack Pope, and menace the Cap
ital. He thereupon sent urgent messages
to McClellan, but still the evacuation of
Harrison's Landing was not commenced till
eleven days after it was ordered. In this
emergency Cox's troops were ordered for
ward in great haste from Western Virginia.
Halleck then recites the history of Pope's
campaign, and brings out a letter from Pope
in which that officer pronounces Sigel
wholly unreliable. He commends Pope's
earlier dispositions for isolating Jackson's
forces as vtell plaoued. The delays of some
ot McClellan's troops in inarching to Pope's
relief, were neither creditable nor excusa
ble. He says no foil official report of the
campaign has yet been received from Pope.
He concludes this subject by saying that
if McClellan's troops bad arrived a little
earlier, the rebel army would have been
easily defeated, and perhaps destroyed.
H a Heck's report sketches the history of
the Maryland campaign, denounces the sur
render of Harper's Perry, and emphatically
censures McClellan for it. He then com
plains of McClellan's long inactivity in the
face of a defeated enemy, and says be was
utterly ignorant of what his plan of the
campaign w?s, as toward the close McClel
lan sent no report to him, but only to the
President direct. Hallcck next sketches
Buell's campaign, and says that as a com
mission is ordered to investigate it, it
would be obviously improper for him to
express bis opinion now. He says an in
vestigation has been ordered of Morgan's
Strange abandonment of Combeland Gap.
Grant's and Rosecrans' operations are
sketched without comment. Curtis' with
drawal to Missouri is termed unfortunate,
and is said to have pievented the carrying
out of intended movements in Arkansas.?
He says it is quite possible that the Indian
hostilities may be renewed in the spring,
and preparations will be made according
ly. The forces in South and North Caro
lina are pronounced too small to accom
plish much.
General Halleck calls attention to the
fact that our victories have not been fal
lowed up, and says that in Maryland, Vir
ginia, Kentucky and Middle Tennessee the
| rebel armies have exhibited much more
| mobility and action than our own. lie says
this is partly owing to our euormous bag
gage and immense transportation trains,
and says that our troops, especially in the
East, have been little accustomed to march,
at least such as is required by aotive
operations. Absenteeism, straggling and
desertion are spoken of as crylngevils, and
military laws on this and other subjects are
said to need revision.
The whole report, Of which the above Is
a condensation, is one thousand wbrds
longer than the President's message.
The Trnndle-Bed.
Aa I rummaged through the attic,
Ltat'ning to the falling rain
AS it pattered on the shingles
And against the window pane
Peeping over chests and boxes,
Which with dast were thickly spread,
Saw I in the farthest corner
What was once my trundle-bed.
So I drew it from the recess
Where it had remained so long.
Hearing all the while the music
Of my mothers voice in SODffi
As ahe song in aweeteat accents,
What I since have often read:
'?Hush, my dear, lie still and alumber,
Holy angels guard thy bed."
