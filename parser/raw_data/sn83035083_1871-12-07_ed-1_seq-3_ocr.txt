Correspondence
Again the resistless march of time
has left another year to mingle with
misty items of the past, since the peo-.
plo ot the State of Ohio observed a
day of thanksgiving and praise to the
Divine Creator, for the blessings and
abundance of the year which prcceeds.
Although our land, as prosperous as
its rulers will allow, has in some parts
been visited by the lire fiend, with
terrible effect, yet it has been visited
with a fair degree of prosperity.
On the morning of Thanksgiving
day our citizens gathered together at
the Congregational Church, and lis
tened to a very able and well prepared
discourse which was delivered by
Elder Bowen, who has been the pastor
of the Baptist Church in our village
during the last year. In the evening
the Phil ologian Literary Society pre
sented one of their popular plays,
called the " Dream at Sea," to a large
audience in the Buckeye Hall. This
entertainment was held for the benefit
of the "Western sufferers. The re
ceipts amounted to about fifty dollars.
On the evening before Thanksgiving
a turkey raffle was held in this village
which resulted in the disposal of quite
a number of the feathered tribj. Dur
ing the progress of the raffle we are
informed that some-enterprising indi
vidual was desirous of obtaining a
little interest on the money invested,
without authority from head-quarters
appropriated two gobblers which were
in very good order for the occasion.
A few days since G. H. Adams dis
posed of hisV.ore building and village
lot on Silver street to J. H. Bugrand
and S. S." Beecher, who contemplate
to soon remove the frame building
now occupying the premises and erect
ing in its place a first-class brick
building. This seems to be another
step in the right direction to add to
the general appearance of the street
and to decrease the existing danger
of fire. Southern.
GarrcttsvUle, Dec. 2d, 1871.
On the 27th ult., a horse valued at
$70 was stolen from the stable of a
Mr. Thomas, at Yellow Springs, and
the citizens were seriously contem
plating the matter of Ku-Kluxing the
thief. Nothing had been heard from
Grant at the latest reports.
Terrific Hurricane.
Boston, Dec. 1. A special dispatch
to the Traveller from Halifax says:
A hurricane visited the northern side
of the Island of Cape Breton on the
night ot the 27th ult., doing immense
damage to houses, barns, trees and
shipping. The gale began at 8 o'clock
and lasted until five next morning.
The tide was four feet higher than ev
er known before. The w.harf at Port
Hood was swept away, and in the vil
lages several houses were blown down
A number of vessels aucbored at Port
Malgrave dragged their anchors and
passed out of the strait to the sea.
The Berraudian brig .Tabor, from
Charlottetown, was wrecked on Fox
Islaud and only one man saved. Ten
schooiicrs were wrecked in the strait
of Canso. It is feared theirs has been
considerable lost of life by the gat.
A case is on trial at Columbia, South
Carolina, involving the constitutional
ity of the Ku-Klux act of last Con
gress. Hon. Reverdv Johnson, of
Maryland, and Hon. Henry Stanberry,
of this State, are employed as counsel
against the validity of the bill.
According to a Salt Lake dispatch
the snow at Little Cottonwood on the
27th nit, was about six feet deep on
the level, and the residents of Alta
City had to dig themselves in and out
of their dwellings. That must be a
delightful country we think not.
A negro who murdered Mr. E. E.
King in Haywood county, Tennessee,
was arrested near Brownsville, while
reading to his family. That's another
Ku-Klux outrage for the Radicals to
howl over. A poor, intelligent and
reliable colored citizen rutblessty torn
from the bosom of his family merely
for killing a white man!
According to the authority of the
Radical journals there is great tribnla
tion in the Democratic party over the
Presidential question. But the jour
nals that wear the Grant collar have
very little to say about the way the
Radical mind is torn up these days
over the opposition of Grecley.Schurz,
Dana, Gratz Brown and numerous
prominent bead-lights and leading
journals of the Radical household, to
the re-nomination of their master the
rooss receiver.
on. 1- W. Voorhees on the Democratic
Situation.
Terre Hacte, Ind., Nov. 27. Hon.
Daniel W. Voorhees is out in a card
in the Journal, of tbis city, in which
he proposes an important Democratic
party movement.
tie says: 1 Keenly appreciate the
importance of an authoritative express
ion of the principles which are to guide
ns in the future as in the past. It
should be made, too, at an early date,
in order that the organization shall be
perfected, and confidence restored bv
the time the approaching campaign is
npon us. This, however, should be
the work of a National Convention,
embracing delegates from all the
States.
I am iu favor of calling such a Con
vention at some central point in the
west, and on a dav not later than the
22d of February. The call should be
issued by the .National Executive Com
mittee. Delegates should be to care
fully and patieDtly weigh all the views
before it, and to agree upon and pub
lish a definite declaration of princi
ples upon all matters effecting the po
litical welfare of the people and the
safety of our free institutions. This
beinsrdone, it should adjourn to a day
fixed for the nomination of a candidate
for the Presidency, and in the mean
time discuss and approve or disap
prove of what has been done. It wou ld
then be the duty of all Democrats tak
iug part in politic, to submit to the
majority. If there are such as prefer
their own convictions, even to the plat
form of a National Convention, they
can step aside in quiet, without em
barrassing anybody else.
Let us, however, have political, as
well as personal harmony, and success
is within our reach. If the entire Dem
ocratic vote can be consolidated, in
spired with enthusiasm and brought
to the polls, General Grant cannot be
re-elected. It was the vote in our par
ty that stayed at home on the days of
the late elections which wrought such
wide spread defeat. There is no in
crease of the Republican vote.
I make the above suggestion, know
ing that it is entirely practicable, and
that it meets a just . demand of the
present crisis. I .shall respectfully
urge it upon the attention of the Na
tional Executive Committee and ask
for the favorable consideration of Con
servative men everywhere. . .
The, New York correspondent of
the Springfield (Massachusetts) lie-
publican savs that Congress, at the
coming session, will make no general
revision in tlfe tariff. Of course it
will not. The monopolist manufac
turers and the corrupt rings will have
full sway as long as the Grant Ad
ministration lasts.
The Richmond State Journal, the
Republican organ in that State,. wants
a reconsoiiaation with the dismem
bered counties composing the State of
West "Virginia. It says, with plain
earnestness, " we believe, as we did at
the time, that the division of "Virginia
into two States was wholly uncalled
for and unwarrantable. The reasons
given for it were puerile and inade
quate. No good whatever has or can
grow out of it, but it will be a matter
of contention for . a generation be
tween two weak fragments of what
was once and may again become a
noble State. We are unalterably for
the reconstruction of the old common
wealth of Virginia, in its original ter
ritorial integrity." Very likely this is
to be the platform of the reconstructed
Radical party of the State.
A Slight Discrepancy,
On the 21st of July, 1868, says the
Washington Patriot, Mr. Bout well
stated, iu the House ot Representatives
that the debt had been reduced, be
tween April, 1855, and January, 1868,
one thousand and sixty-six millions of
dollars. According to the public debt
statement, it has been further reduced
since March 1, 1871, 273,749,811 98,
making a total reduction, according to
the Secretary oflie Treasury, of over
$1,349.000,000 fn the last six years. On
the 30th of June, 1865. the total debt
$2,680,646,869 64; deduct from this the
reduction stated by the Secretary of
the Treasury, namely, $1,340,748,971 98
and the total debt should now be Sl,
330,898,047 76.
But according to the public debt
statement of the first inst., it is S2,
361,051,842 21, a discrepancy of o,ver a
thousand millions of dollars precise
ly $1,030,143,785 05!
These arc the figures of the Treasu
ry Department, and the statements of
its chief; it is not for ns to recoucile
or explain them. They are matter of
record, and, we call upon the support
ers of the Administration to attempt
their denial or refutation. We can
show book and page where they can
be found of record, placed there by
the Secretary of the Treasury and we
challenge contradiction.
George Wilkes a vigorous sup
porter of the Republican "party here
tofore, is alarmed at the political drift
iu the direction of monarchy. He
considers that the public liberties in
the United States and its very form of
Government is threatened by the grow
ing tendency to conspiracies of wealth
in the form of land, railway and steam
ship monopolies and monied corpora
tions. There ought to be an awaken
ing among our people iu regard to this
matter before it is too late.
