ASIBIjUXAB SELECTIOH'.
The announcement of the appointment to
the Supreme Bench, of Judge Brewer, otthe
United States Circuit Court, is an extremely
disappointing one in many respects. The
passing OTer of the names which hate been
presented for the position, in order to ele
vate Judge Brewer, suggests a principle of
selection which can only be to the discredit
of the administration.
rThe main quality which has made Judge
Brewer's name known beyond his circnit
has been the remarkable facilities which the
most unscrupulous corporation manipulators
ive had for securing from his court what
Ter action they mieht desire. This was
especially brought out in the case of the
"Wabash receiveiship, and a second time in
the case of the Iowa railroad law, in which
the State supervision of railroads, previous
ly declared by the United States Supreme
Court to be the exclusive jurisdiction of the
States, was held by Judge Brewer to be
subject to the review of the United States
Circuit Bench on which he sat.
The corporation questions which are
likely to come before the Supreme Court
are among the most vital at stake in this
country since the war issues. To make ap
pointments (or the purpose of insuring de
cisions favorable to the corporations would
be a distinct betrayal of the public rights,
let there is little assurance that such is not
the ease, when the Judge who exposed and
removed Jay Gould's wrecking receiver of
the Wabash system is passed over in order
to promote the Judge who appointed and
upheld the wrecker.
THE PBOSPEBOUS OUTLOOK.
The placing of large contracts for iron ore
in Pittsburg, two months ahead of the usual
lime, coupled with the brisk activity which
pervades all our mills, and the active move
ment of coke and iron products over the
railroads, make it clear that next year's iron
trade will equal, if not surpass, the activity
and prosperity of the year that is just draw
ing to a close. All indications point to this
desirable conclusion. Indeed, the only
features which the constitutionally pessimist
ic mind can find to criticise are the tendency
toward increased cost of materials and
products, which may go to a point where
consumption can be checked, and the dis
position to spread out in extensions, to an
extent which might be inconvenient if tbe
check should come. "With these dangers
guarded against, there is no reason why the
present prosperous outlook should not be
regarded as promising a long and steady era
of good business.

' The time is approaching when we shall all
lave that delightful dury of buying Christ
inas presents forced upon us. The premoni--.

The mails are full of circulars, announcing

peculiar suitability of this or that article

TWOOFAXDTD.
)'- It is rather interesting to find that the
'speech which the Hon. William. Walter
"'Phelps made at the Thanksgiving dinner in
Berlin, attended by Count Herbert Bis
marck, does not -please the Kevr York
World. Taffy is universally recognized as
an international commodity in diplomatic
dealings; but the esteemed World is decid
edly of the opinion that in the exchange of
compliments between our Minister and the
younger Bismarck the balance of trade was
left too decidedly on the tide of Germanv.
It declares that Mr. Phelps "'slathered'
the German Emperor with laudations fit
only to proceed from the mouth of a Prus
sian subaltern officer eager to 'bend the
pregnant hinges of the knee that thrift
might follow fawning." This indicates
that the Bepublican Mr. Phelps must have
rivaled the adulations which under the last
administration the Democratic Mr. Phelps
offered up at the shrine of British royalty
and aristocracy. As to surpassing Mr.
Phelps, the Democratic Minister to En
gland, in that line, that is beyond the power
of Mr. Phelps, the Bepublican Minister to
Germany.
A BTAHDABD OP CEEDU1ITT.
The exceedingly high standard set by
certain lawyers, when the exigencies of
their case demand an exceptional degree of
stupidity or credulity in the jury, has often
been commented upon. But the lawyer in
a spiritualistic libel case at New York, Tues
day, who got bis own case thrown out of
ccurt, because be would have no juror who
'fjL .was not prepared to give credit to the in-
Ky uie, id euuueu m uc vuaiujjiunsaip.
insist that the jury which tries a
ous murderer shall be of the stupid
(bat never reads the newspapers and
ows nothing of public events, is a thread-
requiiement; and really, considering
general character of juries, it does not
m altogether unreasonable. But this
lliwyer baits at no such common-place limi
tation. If the juror is not ready to lend a
"willing ear to testimony that a grease-spot
&onlhe floor developed into visions of de-
aflight from the seventh heaven; or that a
flovely young 'woman shut up in a burglar-
proof vault emerged thtnee without
f-.mellocki-he jcannot
litigation. In abort, this
ryfitnesa,'reqnlres the juror to
. unbelievable and. lead the ear of
if only to the statements of
iy and common-place facta.
ae utility of this theory is by no means
-jnfiued to the prosecution of sniritualist
lawsuits. Tbe illustration already sug
gested might be of great use in defending
the 'safe-crackine profession; while in a
green-goods case the requirement that a jury
should be prepared to believe testimony
that 10,000 in first-class greenbacks was put
into a satchel and turned into waste paper
on the way to the depot would be very use
ful in earning iigb fees. There is bardly
any department of criminal effort which
might not be benefited by the theory that
the jury must believe the most incredible
testimony, if furnished to order.
The developments of such theories of the
legal profession are calculated to arouse our
special wonder. But the trouble is that
they leave the public esteem as an entirely
undeveloped and dormant faculty.
ONCE KOBE OH THE SHELF. .
It is not the fault of the real estate agents,
or of the reporters of the city press, if the
Pennsylvania Bailroad does not eventually
get a new and handsome depot in the heart
of the city, For three years or more the
newspapers have been planning for that
convenience. They have selected this site
and that; they have purchased property for
the road, drawn up designs for the new
buildings done everything in fact that an
enterprising press, conscious of the require
ments of the situation, could -be expected to
do; and finally when the prospect seemed
most hopeful, and even the real estate agents
began to believe in tbe transactions they
were themselves represented as making, lot
there comes a cold, unsympathetic denial
from the highest local authority ot the road
so inclusive in its negation as to sbnt out
pretty much all such depot projects, past,
present or immediately prospective.
However, this would but make more mys
terious the recent unusual activity of real
estate at high prices in the district in ques
tion, were there not one evident reason to
give for it. That is simply the pressure for
business room in the old part ot the city.
Tne tremendous rate of growth here for . the
past few years has compelled merchants to
look out, not only for present accomodation,
but to take into account also future neces
sities. This condition of things will of
itself keep the real estate men and report
ers active, even though tbe cherished depot
project is laid away once again on the shelf.
AH LtfSTBUCTlYE COHTEABT.
While Pittsburg is enjoying a business
aspect of almost unalloyed prosperity
with the exception of tbe merely local bank
failure in Lawrenc'eville Wall street is dis
playing a panicky feeling. The reason of
the difference is not hard to discover, nor is
it without sound business instruction.
Pittsburg's prosperity is based on tbe
legitimate supply and the country's demand
for iron and steeL It is based on conserva
tive prices for whatever Pittsburg sells, and
as a result the demand is expanding to an
extent in excess of immediate supply that
forces prices into an advancing tendency.
New York, on the other band, has been
plunging into the trust speculations.
Founded on equal disregard of the laws of
trade and the laws ot the country, these
concerns were successful for a short time in
getting up an inflation of their stocks and
persuading tbe Wall street public to em
bark in them. The inevitable collapse has
been hastened by the discovery that the
laws do not permit themselves to be nulli
fied without protest, and the shrinkage in
four trust stocks alone during the past few
months is between $100,000,000 and $150,
000,000. It is fashionable among Wall street organs
to ascribe the panio of 1873 to granger legis
lation. The fact is, bowever, that it was
caused by the reaction from an era of the
wildest railway inflation building roads on
a capitalization of three or four times the
amount of bona fide cash cost. The same
feature has produced financial reverses both
before and since that date. We presume, if
any serious complications arise from the
collapse of the trusts, Wall street will make
haste to lay the responsibility somewhere
else than on the dishonesty and inflation of
those schemes.
Nevertheless it will be worth while to
bear in mind the fact, shown by the contrast
between Pittsburg and New York, that when
legitimate business is kept up panics do not
come. Those reverses are invariably prod
uced by speculation and inflation.
REPUBLIC gAKTTCS WANTED.
The United States have always been
ready to give the people of the old world,
who still retain the burden ot royalty or
imperial despotism, the benefit of their ex
perience in self-government, but now the
time seems to have come for more practical
aid in tbe transformation of institutions
which is taking place slowly but surely in
Europe. What we mean is that a company
of experts in Republic making combining
bright minds of this continent with the
more fiery spirits of South America would
find a field for remunerative labor in several
parts of Europe, Talking of SouthernB e-
publicans the accomplished revolutionists
of Brazil, who turned a monarchy into a Be?
public with no more fuss than it they had
been breakfasting, ought to be very much
sought after when the Latin races of South
ern Europe determine to rule themselves.
Aside from the philanthropic aspect of
tbe enterprise, it ought to be profitable.
People oppressed by effete or any other kind
of undesirable Kings, Emperors or
Princes surely would be willing to pay for
the rapid, easy and safe erection of Repub
lics. In England, and we dare say in other
countries, skillful hands could put up a Be
public, "while you wait," as it were. There
is money in it and honor, too.
BTTBHIKG TIP FOOD.
The report that Kansas farmers are burn
ing corn for fuel is regarded by some of our
cotemporaries as indicating an economic
saving. It may be so in one sense, as it is un
derstood that the price of a bushel of corn in
Kansas is actually less than the cost of a
bushel of coal; but it is, nevertheless, an
economic waste which is indicative of
something wrong.
While it is natural, under certain circum
stances, that an abundant yield of corn might
make its cash market value so slight that it
cannot bear the cost of transportation to
market, and therefore cannot be promptly
turned into cash, it ought to be worth more
as the raw material which can be converted
into staples that can be transported, such as
pork or beef, than it is to burn up as fuel.
What all the circumstances may be which
subject tbe farmers to this loss may not be
clear; but in the combinations which on one
side sustain the cost of anthracite coal, and
on the other are alleged to keep down the
price of cattle anil hogs, a partial explana
tion may be found of tbe circumstances
under which Western farmers finding coal
too dear to buy and corn too cheap to sell,
are using the latter-as fuel.
Illustrations of this sort, balanced by the
dlfficulty'of we-?kw''WrouT cities to
obtain an abundance of , feed, are decidedly
strong indicatibns that the financial methods
of the day are- levying undue burdens on the
common people.

themselves. The same consideration also per

Siberian exile does the appearance of a mes

,or other has reminded me ot General Wiley's
experiences with the horde ot pestering men
and women who descended npon him when he
had charge of the Department of Publlo Safety
In the reorganization of battered Johnstown.
The other day I heard a story which illus
trates some of the trials General Wiley en
countered in his position. A certain woman
who came to Johnstown on a very charitable
and honorable mission went to General Wiley's
headquarters the night she arrived and asked
him to send an orderly with her to pnt up her
tent General Wiley directed the orderly to
raise the tent and make it habitable'to the best
of his ability. The orderly obeyed orders and
returned in due time to headquarters. Hardly
had he arrived whep the distinguished woman
trotted into the General's presence and said:
"Oh, General, could you let me have an
orderly again. I want tbe tent turned around
the other way." '
"Certainly, madam," said General Wiley.
The orderly disappeared with the lady and
again returned. Once more upon his heels
came the lady with a request for an orderly to
take her trunk up to tbe tent from the depot.
This was done and then for the fourth time the
petitioner again appeared with a request for an
orderly to move her tent a few teet higher up
the bill. Exactly what General Wiley said I
don't know, but It was something like this:
"Madam, you can take all the orderlies I hare,
and have them turn your tent upside down, or
on Its edge, or any way yon please," and when
the great lady was gone the handsome soldier
made some editorial remarks whose strength
and size could not be conveyed in smaller typo
than long primer. ,
No wonder that when that clear-headei
business-like woman of affairs. Mrs. Dr.Eastvn,
went into General Wiley's headquarterslat
Johnstown, and asked him simply to point lut
to her from his tent door the Bureau of infor
mation and declined his offer to send an officer
to show her the way, he broke out in astoi
bed
pleasure: "You are the first woman, Mrs.

JAPAff WANTS IKFOEMATION
As to tho Propor Mode of Stock Gambling
and Speculation.
Chicago, December 1 T. Ogawa, a member
of the Organization Committee of the Tokio.
Japan, Bourse, is at tbe Grand Pacific, on his
way to New York. He Is on an important mission
to the United States. Said he to a reporter.
'There are at present in Japan 12 rice and five
stock exchanges. The licenses under which they
are now operated expire June 1, 1891,af ter which
time it is desired by the Japanese Government
and the principal exchange managers
that certain improved methods should
be introduced, and for this purpose the
aid and earnest co-operation of leading
merchants and ' business men of Japan
were invited. In order to better bring
about tbe result, It was thought best to insti
tute inquiries both in Europe and America as
to practical methods, both present and past,
of conducting exchanges there In vogue;
and I was appointed one ot a commis
sion for collecting such data. My questions
would be based upon tbe practices of tho ex
changes in Japan, for which reason many in
dications of dissimilar methods observed in
American exchanges will be found. Much is
expected by my people as to the result of the
report which my commission will make, and
for this reason I respectfully go about bother
ing your board ot trade and exchange people."
Amontr the things Mr. Ogawa will ask Chi
caeo business men will be those concerning the
capital stock and share holders, the steps to
secure permission from the Federal or State
Government for the establishment of ex
changes, and the relations which exist between
tbe Federal or State Governments and the ex
changes in regard to tbe business of the latter;
members of the exchanges, departments of the
exchange hall, terms for future or direct
delivery price, and limitation of amount of
transactions; securities, breaches of contract,
and penalties, tbe relations between members
or brokers of the exchanges and principals
who delegate business to them, and kindred
subjects. Mr. Ogawa will occupy a year in
America gathering bis information.

Eane-au-kai Is the name of a stone near
Walmea, on the Island of Oihff. It has a very
curious legend connected with it Many years
ago how many, this deponent saith not the
fishermen of Waimea went out on a morning to
fish. They cast their nets as usual, but op
taking them up, found tbey had caught noth
ing. They moved a little away to some other
spot, but with no better success. They ohanged
again, but failed. After these futile attempts
had been often repeated, they were about to'
haul in their nets and return homeward, for
the gods of the sea seemed, that day, at least,
to be unpropltious. However, tbey deter
mined, before leaving, to try once again. This
time tbe net was loaded. Tbey supposed, from
the weight, that some monster of the deep was
in the meshes.
On hauling the net ashore, they found

into the sea, another cast of the net followed,
and again it came np heavy. There was in it
a stone, and amazed were they to find It the
same stonO tbey had already flung into the sea.
A second time the offending stone was cast
into the deep, and the fishermen moved off to
a new location. One mora attempt was made
at fishing, when, a third time, up came the
identical stone. The fishermen were, by this
time enraged. With vigorous strokes, and'

and tossed the intruding stone overboard.
Certain that now they were rid of it, they re
tired to their fishing grounds and proceeded,
on the spur ot fresh excitement, to ply Jhetr
labors. The net filled and now they palled
shoreward with many congratulations. They
rejoiced in the prospect of a good return to
offset the adversities of the morning. Out of
the not came the stone, only that and nothing
more. Awed now by its miraculous reappear
ance, they carried it reverently. to land, and
kneeling around, paid it divine honors. Re
turning to their work, they cast their net, and
now were they rewarded with the finest haul of
fish ever they had taken. Thus runs the legend,
and, to this day, on returning from the harvest
of the ocean, the first fish taken by tho head of
the party is laid, tor future good luck, on tbe

Joslah Brewer, was a missionary to that coun
try when the Justice was born, but returned to

nently named in connection with the appoint
ment. After a years study of the law in New
York City, Mr. Brewer removed to Kansas,

profession. He served two terms of six years
each on the bench of the Supreme Court of
that State, and bad entered upon tbe third
term when President Arthur appointed him
Judge ottbe Eighth Judicial Circuit, to suc
ceed George W. McCrary.

Stephen J. Field, his mother having been a
member ottbe famous Field family. The ap

presided, speaks of him in the warmest terms,
ranking him among the ablest of Judges on the
bench. Dr. Morrison says tbe appointment will
give satisfaction to all parties in Kansas.

18PICIAI. TILXQEAM TO TBE DISPATCH.
Richmond. December 4. At noon to-day the
Virginia Legislature, elected in tbe contest of
November 6, was opened. Both branches are
overwhelmingly Democratic In the Senate
that party has 81 of the 10 members, and in the
House 85 of the 100. Soon after the two houses
were organized Governor Fitzbugh Leo, who
will be succeeded on January 1 next by Cap
tain Philip McKlnney, sent in his last annual
message. Tbe feature of this paper is its
treatment of the debt, the question which has
been the cause of so much political strife in
this State for tbo past 12 years
Some of tbo best financiers think that Gov
ernor Lee, in this message, has come nearer a
solution of this question than any of bis prede
cessors. 0TEE A MILLION A MONTH.

months of the fiscal year were $18,783, 350. an
increase of M, 039,331, as compared with the col
lections during the corresponding period of
the last year.
The Increase has averaged over $1,000,000 a

THEY WANT NO SUNDAY. LAWS.
Missouri Citizens Object to Compulsory
Obiervanco Of tho Snbbatb.
Washington, December 1 Senator Cock
roll to-day presented a memorial of citizens of
Ralls and Pike counties, Mo., remonstrating
against the passage of any bill for the observ
ance of Sunday, or any other religious institu
tion or rite, and also against any amendment
to the Constitution, providing for religious in
struction in the public schools.
It prays that the Government be kept strictly
secular, and that church and state be entirely
separate.
ON THE MESSAGE.
NEW Yoke Evening World (Dem): Though
tinged with bitter partisanship the message is
an Important one and deserving of tbe careful
consideration of every American citizen.
New York Herald (Dem): President Har
rison's message is a plain, business document,
well written and making recommendations
strictly in the line ot the Republican platform.
Philadelphia Inquirer (Rep): President
Harrison has given Congress a thoroughly old
fashioned message. Itis conservative and yet
decisive, unpretentious except as to length, and
doos not attempt to usurp any of tbo functions
of tho legislative branch of the government.
Cleveland Leader (Rep): The dominant
characteristic of President Harrison's first
message to Congress is its strong Republican
ism. It expresses and illustrates the spirit of
progressive and patriotic Republican policy In
every paragraph. It is the address of an earn
est and thoughtful executive.
Philadelphia jPreit (Rep): It is the
strongest proof at once ot tbe prosperity of the
country and tbe prudent common sense of
President Harrison that, save on four or five
subjects, his recommendations in regard to the
vast work of Federal Administration urge a
policy which every good citizen will approve.
Philadelphia Timet (Ind. Dem): The
President's first message to Congress is just
such a cautious, conservative paper as was to
have been expected from him. If any one
looked to Mr. Harrison for a bold declara
tion of party policy, like that conveyed in Mr.
Cleveland's famous message to the Congress
before this, the expectation was hardly justified
by bis past deliverances and will certainly not
be realized by the present.
NEWY0EK2W6une(Rep): Its most strik
log characteristic is the absence of pretense,
exaggeration or rhetorical flourish, and there
is no attempt to enlarge upon especial topics
tor tbe sake of catching temporary popular ap
plause or partisan advantage. It has the tone
throughout of conscious strength and sincerity,
and ot profound conviction that the people
will unwaveringly sustain the national policies
to which they gave approval by their votes one
year ago.
NewYoek Bun (Dem): For originality,
grasp of public questions andonse of perspect
ive in the statement of the condition of 'nat
ional affairs, General Harrison's message com
pares unfavorably with the first message sent
to Congress by Mr. Hayes twelve years ago.The
weakest man that ever ocenpied the White
House had more to offer to CongTessJin tho way
of information and suggestion, and offered it
with a more vigorous individuality ot thought
and expression than the present Individuality
ot the thought and expression than the present
chief executives! the United States cm ex
hibit or command.

Early this morning a hatless man staggered
up Third avenue, near tbe Park, with his throat
cut and bis sbirt front covered with frozen
blood. A policeman who met him called aa am
bulance and sent him ton hospital. At noon
tbe man regained his senses sufficiently to say
he was Christian Happ, aq employe ot tbe New

know how he got his tbroat cut. He was paid
off yesterday and got drunk early in the even
ing. He was thrown out ot a saloon at mid

raigned for sentence to-day before Judge Mar
tine. He was sentenced to State's prison for 16
years and 11 months, and in imposing sentence
Judge Martina said: ''Human life Is held too
cheaply la this community. There seems to be
amaudlin feeling in behalf of those who com
mit crime a feeling entirely for tbe slayer and
little feeling of sympathy or kindness for the
slain. Too frequently, when persons are killed
there is an attempt in various ways to create
sympathy for the person who kills, rather than
punish him or her for tbe crime committed.
This is entirely wrong, and the ends of justice
in this manner are not served.'

struck by a blizzard from the Northwest. Tha
snow blew so furiously that she 'lost her way
and traveled aronnd in a circle for Severn
hours. Finally she sat down to rest and eat

Out in Creston, la., one Saturday night
not long ago, there happened an amusing inci
dent which railroad trainmen will appreciate.
Creston Is a division point on the Burlington
road, and the town .is naturally tbe stopping
place as well as the home af a great many rail
road employes. On the evening mentioned,
Donnelly and Girard were-playlng "Natural
Gas" there. The bouse was crowded, and
among the gallery gods were some 250 brake
meu, switchmen and yardmen, who had coma
directly from their work, consequently tbey
were nofr only dressea In their laboring garb,
but each man carried his lighted lantern.
About the middle of tbe performance, when
the railroad boys were enjoying immensely the
funny specialties of the two comedians, a smut
covered chap rushed up to tbe door and in
quired of Manager Bert Riddle whether or not
Jimmy McCool was la the audience. "If be is
I want to see him right away," he added.
Riddle replied that be did not know "Jimmy"
by sight, but said that as soon as the act was
over he would go out before the curtain and
call for him. This did not appear to satisfy
the smut-covered party. He pushed by Riddle,
rushed up stairs, and called out in a loud voice:
"No. 7, east-bound, on time; No. 3, going west,
one bour late; all hands wanted in tbe yards!"
At this every mau of the 250 left bis seat, and,
with lighted lantern in band, marched out.
The effect of such a disturbance npon the per
formance may be Imagined. It simply broke
tbe actors all np and completely knocked them
out,
