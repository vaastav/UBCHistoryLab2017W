HOI-MAX'S RETIREMENT.
The voluntary retirement of Con
gressman Hot. max from the appropria
tion committee is both an evil and a
benefit. There is always a disposition
on the part of certain members of con
gress to secure appropriations for their
districts quite regardless of the neces
sity for expenditure, and solely on ac
count of the popularity that would
thereby accrue to them.
By a system of trading on the princi
ple of "you tickle me and I'll tickle
poll,-' many items of that nature creep
nto the appropriation bills which
should be kept out of them. Mr. Hoe
«an has always had a keen eye for
ittle defects of this kind, and his vigi
ance has on many occasions prevented
;he absolute waste of the public money.
Looked at in that light, Mr. Hoi.man's
retirement is to be regretted.
But on the other hand he has, in his
ambition to deserve the title "watch
dog of the treasury." only too often ob
structed progress on the appropriation
bills, and indeed delayed the whole
course of legislation, through motives of
false economy. Objecting in season and
out of season, be has often tried the
patience of his fellow committeemen
by resolutely refusing his assent to ap
propriations absolutely needful, but
yet which seemed to the Indiana states
man of the most pernicious character.
He played the part of an obstructionist.
■onetimes to good and sometimes to bad
purpose, and nearly always with little
discrimination.
From the point of expediting public j
business, therefore, the retirement of !
Mr. Hoi. man to a less important com
mittee is hardly to be deplored.

MR. RANDALL'S PLEDGE.
It is reported that Mr. I.._m>.w.i. has
given his pledge to his fellow Demo
cratic members that if he is allowed to
retain his place on the ways ana means
committee of the house he will not re
sort to any obstructive tactics to defeat
any tariff bill that the committee may
recommend. There probably is no
foundation for the report, except that
Mr. Randall recognizes, as every sen
sible man must, that the time has come
when a man cannot consistently affiliate
with the Democratic party and at the
same time be an obstructionist when a
tariff reform measure is before congress.
Mr. Randall is in the unfortu
nate position of being a Democratic
representative from a Republican dis
trict. His duty to his constituents con
flicts with his party loyalty. The best
that he can do under the circumstances
is to content himself with voting against
the tariff bill that the committee on
ways and means will report. When he
has done that he will have discharged
his duty to his constituents without
having given offense to his party associ
ates. But the very moment he under
takes to lead in open opposition to
the Democratic tariff policy, or to
resort to strategy to defeat any
measure that the Democratic ma
jority may agree upon, then he
becomes the enemy of the Democratic
party and should be forced to take bis
place in the Republican ranks. Mr.
Randall is too wise a man not to
know his duty in the premises, and it
is unreasonable to suppose that he is
going to kick out of traces or will
enter into a positive conspiracy for the
overthrow of his party. Mr. Cleve
land has forced tariff reform as the
one issue on which next year's battle is
to be fought. If Mr. Randall can't
stand with the Democrats on that plat
form, he will probably find it conven
ient to go to Europe for his health
during the coming summer.
SHERMAN'S CHEERFULNESS.
John ShK-O-A-S has a buoyant nat
ure. -Nothing depresses him. When
Chicago was selected as the place for
holding the Republican convention Mr.
Sherman* laughed over it and told his
friends that it was all right— had
been to Chicago last summer, and there
was not really such a Blame boom in
that locality as people generally sup
posed. And now that the Republican
clubs have completed an organization
Mr. Sherman is downright hilarious
over the result. He points with pride
to the fact that a Shekman
man was made temporary chair
man of the convention and
that when his own name was mentioned
at least forty-two of the delegates
clapped their hands and shouted, "Hur
rah Cor Sherman* !" The buoyant Mr.
Sherman* construes all this into mean
ing that he is riding Into the presiden
tial nomination on a popular wave. He
shuts his eyes to the fact that, while 42
delegates were lisping his name, 242
others were shouting themselves hoarse
in praise of James G. Blaise. He
fails to remember that, while his friends
got control of the temporary organiza
tion, Mr. Blaine--* friends were solid
on the permanent organization^ and
gobbled up everything that was worth
having. - One.cannot help admiring Mr.
Sherman's cheerfulness under all these
depressing circumstances. The truth
is that Mr. Sherman* is a man so un
used to popular applause that it takes a
very light encore to bring him before
the curtain.

OUR NEW POSTMASTER.
There will be no ground for dissatis
faction with Mr. Cleveland's appoint
ment of a new postmaster for this city.
Mr. Lee is an old resident of St. Paul,
and well known to all our people. His
name has been prominently mentioned
in connection with the ofliee ever since
a Democratic administration came into
power, and it is reasonable to suppose
that it there had been any objections to
his appointment they- would have been
made public by this time. The fact
that no one contested the place
with Mr. Lee is evidence of
his popularity and a universal
recognition of his qualification for the
office. Mr. Lee will enter upon the ad
ministration of his office with the abso
lute confidence of our people in his
capacity to discharge its onerous duties,
and with their best wishes for his suc
cess.
It is due to Dr. Day, the retiring post
master, to say that the government
never had a more efficient man in its
postal service, and President Cleve
land did a wise thing in permitting him
to serve out bis full term. The St.
Paul postoffiee is by no means a
sinecure position. The labors
and responsibilities are out of
all proportion to the salary.
For twelve years Dr. Day has worked
earnestly and faithfully in perfecting
the work of his office, and we are en
tirely within the bounds of truth when
we' say that no city in the Union has a
postoffiee in which there is more
thorough system in the management of
it- affairs than St. Paul. And it is all
due to Dr. DAY'S splendid executive
ability.
It rarely occurs that there is more
unanimity in according to a retiring
official and bis successor a tribute of re
spect and an expression of confidence
than the people of St. Paul accord to Dr.
Day and Mr. Lee.

cause they are to get the first class to

says that Yolapuk is intended espe
cially for commercial purposes, as a
written and not a spoken language,

one can learn to read and write Yolapuk

Ignatius Donnelly will have to
support Mr. Blame out of gratitude.
Mr. Blame is advocating Mr. Don
nelly's book in Europe. In a recent
Paris interview Mr. Blame said that
the French were taking no interest in
the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy
simply because they had no use for
Englishmen in any shape or form. As
for himself, he was interested in the
subject because he knew Mr. Donnelly
personally and knew him to be a very
ingenious and subtle student; but for
all that he didn't think that Mr. Don
nelly could unhorse the bard of Avon.
He cited Marlowe and Brass as in
stances of men who lounged around
public houses, drank bad whisky and
led notoriously bad lives; yet these
facts did not argue against the genius
of either one of them.

Another attempt on the life of the czar is

St. Pail turned out handsomely at the Na

Mr. Blame's enemies have gained control
in Maine, and yet he treads "the primrose

Mattson on Protection.
Gen. K. W. Johnson — Hon. Hans
Mattson in an interview in Saturday's
Dispatch puts the whole thing in a nut
shell in the following lines: "I believe
in the protection of home industries to
some extent, but as it is now the capi
talists and monopolists are protected to
the detriment of agriculture and the
working classes. * * * * The agri
cultural interests of the Northwest,
which have heretofore been passed un
! noticed, are demanding . recognition.
| The tariff must be revised, and if the
j Republican party does not assist in
| bringing it about it will go hard with
the party. It is an outroge that 60,000,
-000 people should be compelled to pay
duty on sugar amounting to $60,000,000
in order to protect the sugar interests id'
Louisiana, whose entire products do not
amount to over 510.000,000. It would be
bett rto subsidize the Louisiana sugar
raisers and abolish the import tax." •

A BAD ACCIDENT.
A Duluth Train Jumps the Track
At Pickering— Engineer Thomas
Killed.
Special to the Globe.
lli.vckley, Minn., Dec. 19.— The
limited train, which let St. Paul at 2
p. in. for Duluth, ran off at Picker
ing. The cause is unknown. Engin
eer Thomas, the oldest engineer on
the road was killed. The fireman, Mike
Lynch, had a leg broken. The engine
and baggage car rolled down the em
bankment. None of the passengers are
known to be injured. Engineer Thom
as' body will be taken on No. 6 to St.
Paul.
GLEANED IN ST. PAUL.
The Version Given by the Officials
of the Road.
The limited train on the St. Paul &
Duluth road, leaving St. Paul at 2:15 p.
m. yesterday, was ditched on Pickering
side track, 120 miles up the road at
(1:30 o'clock last evening. Engineer Will
iam Thomas was killed outright, and the
fireman, whose name is unknown, had
his hip dislocated. According to the
reports received by President Fisher,
none of the passengers were injured,
although all were badly shaken up and
some of them severely bruised by
the shock. The cause of the
accident was a misplaced switch, and
whether the switch was turned by ac
cident or with malicious intent, the
authorities of the road do not
say. The train was running slowly at
the time, having just climbed to the top
of Pickering hill, one of the steepest
grades on the line. It consisted
of the engine, a combination bag
gage and smoking car and two coaches.
Only the engine, the combination car
and one coach were derailed. A
physician was on the train
and attended the wounded as
best he could until two more arrived on
a special from Duluth. The main
track of the road was blockaded
only an hour and a half when
traffic was resumed as usual. Tho
nearest station to the place of the acci
dent is Bariium, two and one-half miles
distant.
Engineer Thomas was one of the old
est engineers on the road. He made his
home in St. Paul with his family, and
his superiors say he was a good and re
liable man in every way.

A SALOON CASE.
Ch icago Liquor Men Can Sell to
Minors.
Chicago, Dec. Judge McAllister
this morning decided that the city ordi
nance prohibiting the sale of liquor to
miners was void. A few days ago Oscar
Matthia. who keeps a concert saloon,
was arrested for selling wine to Linnie
St. Clair, a sixteen-year-old girl, who
was abducted by a young man whom
she had met in concert saloons. Mat
thia applied for release under the
i habeas corpus act. The judge held
| that the portion of the ordinance which
; revokes a saloonkeepers license on a
; second offense is unconstitutional.
; Among the grounds of this opinion are
I that the general incorporation act does
I not give the city council power to pass
such an ordinance. The act gives the
: council power to levy fines not to ex
ceed $200 and imprison the offender not
! to exceed six months. Forfeiture of
I license is neither fine nor imprison-
I ment. Again the dram shop act pro
| vides a punishment to saloonkeepers
selling to minors, except in cases where
the minor brings a written request from
the parents. The ordinance punished
the seller or giver away of drink regard
less of such request, thereby contraven
ing the statute. Matthia was dis
charged and the decision gives great
joy to the saloonkeepers.

NERO DREWA CROWD
An Immense Audience Greet
ed the National Opera Com
pany Last Night,
And Enjoyed the Magnificent
Production of Rubinstein's
Spectacular "Nero."
The Work of the Operatic
Stars Was Fully Appreci
ated and Approved.
Swell Society Turned Out in
Full Force in Its Opera
Garments.
nE opening night
of the National
Opera engage
ment was a dis
tinct success. The
Grand opera
house presented a
scene last evening
unparalleled in
opera performan
ces in th city.
Fashion turned
out in its gayest
attire to pay tril»
ute to art, and it turned out in full
force, too. It was not simply a full
bouse— it was packed from the orchestra
to the uppermost perch in the gallery,
and the individual who came late and
wanted standing room only had to hustle
to get it.
"Nero" is the first of Rubinstein's
operas which
has been sun«
on this side of
the water. This
country has
heretofore been
considered toe
young to appre
ciate music of
snch a high
class, and man
agers have
thought it toe
risky a business
to mount an
opera like thb
at the enormouf
expense requir
ed to mount it
properly. What
ever may be the
outcome of his
venture, Mr. Locke is unquestionably
entitled to credit for his faith in the cul
tured musical talent of his countrymen.
If all his audiences were like his .St.
Paul audience last night he will be com
pensated.
The story of "Nero" as told in Rubin
stein's opera is familiar to the Globe
readers, having been published .in
these columns some days ago.
If the composer had rested his fame on
the first and second acts he wouldn't
have cut much of a figure in the musi
cal world. There is very little melody
IN the first act,
and no great amount of it in the second.
The work is chiefly done by the chorus
and the solos are principally declama
tory or in recitations. Yet what is lack
ing in the way of gratifying the
ear in these two
acts is made up
by dazzling the)
eye. But while
the stage ; ; car
penter and the
scene painter
and the ballet
master are. per
mitted to run
away with the,
first acts, the
composer appro
priates the third
act more exclus
ively to his own]
work. It is here
that the great
Rubinstein £ is
seen, or rather
beard, at his
musical best.
Cbrysa's open-
ing solo, "Ob, Fates Ye Cast," sung by
Miss Juch,is a marvel of beauty. its sweet,
simple melody being in direct contrast
to the turbulent music that preceded
it. Then her duct with Ludwig. who
saying 'Vindex"
was an exquisite
piece of writing,
combining the
expression of a
pure passion
with a devotion
al character of
the highest
form. The lul
laby sang by
Miss Poole, who
impersonates
Epieharis, is a
number full of
tender melody,
the orchestral
accompaniment
being as dainty a piece of composition
as one ever hears. Aggrippina's lament
over the dead Hector, as she sings to
the accompaniment, of Nero's lyre, is a
magnificent number, and was sung
with such im
mense nerve and
power by Miss
Luddington as
to raise the au
dience to the
highest pitch of
enthusiasm.
Not since Tatti
was here has a
St. Paul audi
ence hearda
voice with such
clear, bell-like
tones, so sweet,
so tenderly ex
pressive, as that
of Emma Juch.
Her acting is as
good as her sing
ing, and her
beauty adds to
the charm in the sympathetic role of
the Christian girl. Mme. Pierson did
superb work throughout the perform
ance, her solo in the second act catching
the first encore. Misses Poole, Lud
dington and Fabris are all artists
of deserved repute. Mr. McGuckiu's
Nero was admirably done, and espe
ially as this was his first attempt to sing
the role. William Ludwig was immense
as Vindex. his duet with Miss Juch in
the first scene of the third act being one
of the finest renditions ever given in
opera.
THE SCENERY.
The scenery was superbly effective in
every act, but the climax was the scene
descriptive of the burning of Rome. At
first a red tinge lights up the sky, which
gradually becomes stronger until a fork
of flame appears in the background.
Then the red light deepens
and the black smoks - pours
up, and the conflagration is raging in
its terrible fury, licking up massive
buildings in its pathway. The scene is
one of such horrible splendor and in
tense realism that an audience really
hangs between the fascination to see
the completing work of the devouring
element and the impulse to get up ana
fly from its approach.
The orchestra was immense, the cos
tuming brilliant, and in every respect
the production of "Nero" was in keep
ing with the promises of Manager
Locke.
Fursch-Madi wasn't on the list, but
she never will be missed as long as
Juch sings her roles.
To-night Wagner's "Flying Dutch
man" will be sung. Afterseeing "Nero"
last • night we are prepared to
see Manager Locke fulfill all
Ids '" promises 'in regard to the
brilliant scenic and spectacular part of
this opera, which are said to be of the
most wonderful description, particu
larly as respects the use of electricity
in the great storm scenes of the first
and second acts. The entry of the ships
into port with the fury .of the
hurricane is said to be grandly realistic.
Bertha Pierson, the dramatic soprano
who made such a splendid success
last . night in the role of Poppcea in
"Nero," will take the part of Senta and
William Ludwig will appear in his
famous character of the Dutchman.

HENRY GEORGE IS GLAD
The President Expressed His
Views on the Tariff.
New York, Dec. Henry George
lectured at the Academy of Music last
night. "I thank God," he said, "for
Graver Cleveland's message. It was
not the message of a Hebrew prophet.
A Hebrew prophet would not expect a
renomination by the Democracy. Nor
was it the message of a free trader. It
was the message of a president of the
United States who is inclined toward
free trade. It is an anti-protection mes
sage. Mr. Cleveland is as yet afraid
of his horses. But, if I mistake not,
when he once lets them drive they
will carry him much further than he
now believes. lam glad of the mes
sage. Why? Because of the great
work it is doing— aye, the great work it
has already done. It has brought the
question of free trade before the public.
No longer will the discussion be as to
how much to raise or lower the tariff.
It is now whether it be protection or
free trade. lam as glad of Cleveland's
bringing this question into politics as I
would have been if our most sanguine
hopes had been realized in the last elec
tion. And I believe we ourselves have
largely contributed toward bringing the
question up."

Lord Cairns Marries a Hebrew
Lady Who Has Money.
London, Dec. . 19.— The addition to
the Cairns fortune through the mar
riage of Lord Carins to Miss Behern
to-day is £300.000, which more than com
pensates for the outlays incurred by his
lordship's engagement to Miss Forte
scue and Miss Grant. . Miss Behern is
a member of a very wealthy Hebrew
family in Manchester and will probably
receive large legacies from time to
time, in the event of her surviving some

markably cool during the marriage
ceremony. .
Austria's Preparations.
Vienna, Dec. 19.— Saturday evening
the bourse wound up in a sudden rout.
Securities of all kinds were recklessly
thrown on the market. It is estimated
that on Friday and Saturday 200,000,000
florins were lost. It is stated that at
Monday's council resolutions will be
proposed to place 25.000,000 florins at
the disposal of the war minister to build
200,000 huts in Galicia, and for the im
mediate purchase of uniforms and ac
couterments for the landwehr and the
last class of the reserves. A wide-spread
outbreak of cattle disease is reported in
Poland. This is regarded as a sure sign
of large arrivals of beasts from the in
terier for military provisioning.

A SOUTHERN CYCLONE
Causes Great Loss of Life and De-
st ruction of Property.
Little Rock, Ark., Dec. 19.— spe
cial from Cove, Polk county, reports
that a destructive cyclone visited Arm
strong academy, Indian territory, Fort
Washita and Green at an early hour on
Saturday morning, causing great de
struction of property and loss of life.
The following are the casualties as far
as known :
FRENCH ADAMS, United States army,
Washita, killed.
A. B. /_. LINCOLN, Washita, killed.
HENDERSON JACK, Green, killed.
PETER RESON, Green, killed.
Two children, names unknown, killed.
WILLIAM COVINGTON, Armstrong acad
emy, both lees broken.
HENRY WAIT, Washita, arm and leg
broken.
Mrs. WAIT, Washita, arm broken.
A terrific rumbling sound was heard
about 5 o'clock. It startled the few set
tlers from their sleep, only to awaken
them to the horror of impending death.
A heavy black cloud, funnel-shaped,
was seen in the distance and rapidly ap
proaching. When about a mile north of
Fort Washita it struck the ground, and
from this point south for miles the work
of ruin was continued. The cyclone
traveled at about the rate of a mile a
minute. In an instant from the time it
struck the earth half the bouses in Fort
Washita were in ruins. Light outhouses
and dwellings were picked up and made
into kindling wood by the fury of the
wind. Armstrong academy was not
ereatly injured, but ranchers in the im
mediate neighborhood suffered greatly.
At Green, a little hamlet six miles south
of Armstrong, the damage was very
heavy and many persons were injured.
Seventeen houses and a general store
were carried away bodily, while many
horses and cattle, within the territory
covered by the storm king, lay killed or
maimed, The damage at this time can
not of course be estimated, as the full
extent of the storm is not known. The
two children killed at Green were car
ried about sixty yards by the wind and
dashed to the ground, mangled so as to
be almost unrecognizable. Many cattle
and other stock were also killed by
lightning. The storm only lasted about
six minutes at any one point.
Threw a Bomb.
Stanstead, Que., Dec. 19.— At about
1 o'clock this morning a bomb, to which
a lighted fuse was attached, was thrown
through a window into the dining room
of Dr. Canfield's residence. Mrs. Can
field, hearing the crash and the hissing
of the burning fuse, sprang out of bed
and succeeded in detaching the fuse.
The bomb contained enough giant blast
ing powder to wholly demolish the
house and kill all the inmates. Dr.
Canfield's father, who is a bailiff, has
been engaged lately in serving processes
for violation of the Canada temperance
law, and bad been threatened with vio
lence if he did not desist.

PRISON ENTERTAINMENTS.
' — — — — — ' ■f_*"*'s*#-5
Objections Urged Against Hold
ing Them on Sunday— General
Stillwater News. ';.-/■. "X"
■ There has been much said by differ
ent parties relative to the entertain
ments given by various troups at the
prison, who chance to remain in this
city over Sunday. The majority are of
the opinion that a treat now and then
is good for the boys confined behind
the bars, as it tends to elevate them and
turn their minds to more pleasant
themes. Last night the evening paper
of this city produced an article to which
the writer did not sign his name, which,
. among other things, contained the fol
lowing fling: "Do you suppose a the
atrical company could be induced to
play to them (the poor) for merely the
honor? Oh no, but they can be induced
to entertain a mob of thieves,
murderers, outrage** of woman's honor
and all the disreputable characters in
the criminal calender." This, and a lot
more in similar strain, is the body of the
article. There is much said in favor of
the prisoners, and the general senti
ment seems to be entirely in favor of
letting the "boys" enjoy a good thing
once and a while, and not be ground
down simply because it is the wish of a
few. The writer of the article in the
evening paper is receiving considerable
attention, and those who speak of it
commend the action of those entrusted
with the charge of the prison, and do
not uphold any such theories as are ad
vanced by the writer.
PERSONAL AND GENERAL.
Newton Beers at the conclusion of the
company's entertainment at the prison
on Sunday made a few brief remarks
relative to the pleasure he had. with his
company, experienced in entertaining
his hearers, and in conclusion said he
did not want to lecture but would only
say "Remember, boys, there is always
room at the top."
The firemen are making extensive
preparations for a grand inaugural ball
at the new engine house on Thursday
evening. A large number of tickets
have already been sold and everything
bids fair for an excellent gathering and
a marked success.
Work on the natural gas find £roes
steadily on near the levee. Already a
twenty-six-foot pipe has been sunk and
the quality and quantity of gas that
forces its way up the narrow tube
proves most excellent and voluminous.

TO DO AWAY /WITH PICKETS.
Drawbaugh Has a New Electrical
Machine for Detecting the Ap-
proach of Armies.
IlAKnisnrito, Pa., Dec. 19.— Daniel
Drawbaugh, the supposed inventor of
the telephone, is now at work on an in
vention by which the presence of large
bodies of men on land and ships on the
ocean can be detected. It is an electri
cal machine, and Drawbaugh claims
that a general with this new contrivance
in his tent can tell by its peculiar mo
tion if the enemy is near and prepare
to give him a warm reception. The
commander of a war vessel can also tell
the approach of any vessel, hostile or
otherwise, the resistance of the water
on the approaching vessel causing suffi
cient friction to establish a current that
will cause the indicator to sound
the alarm. Drawbaugh refers to
his latest discovery as an "Elec
trical paradox. It hasn't any name yet,
although a portion of it has already
been patented and the entire arrange
ment has been sent to this city for in
spection. The instrument consists of
what Mr. Drawbaugh calls a microphone
ami a registering dial. The microphone
is placed in a hollow iron tube, which is
hermetically sealed. The microphone,
when it is to be used on land, is at
tached to an iron screw with a very wide
thread, by means of which it is sunk
firmly into the earth. An insulated
wire, whicii may be buried or carried
over tree tops as the emergency may ne
cessitate, connects with a galvanic bat
tery and the registering dial, which
may be placed miles away. The practical
working of the instrument is intended
to do away almost entirely with the
picket lines of an army. To give an in
stance, a commanding officer may sit in
his tent supplied with a registering dial
and keep informed of the approach of a
large body of troops from any direction
by a proper distribution of the stakes
containing the hermetically sealed mi-
I crophones, a dozen of which may be
1 used as the occasion demands. The in
stant the air or earth vibrations caused
by the tramp of feet or the sound of
voices affect the microphone, that in
stant the effect is shown on the face of
the dial by the turning of the needle
from the zero point.

IN THE RAILWAY WORLD.
The City of Sioux Falls in an Ecstatic
Temperament
BECAUSE OF A NEW ROAD.
The Railroad Commissioners Trying to
Make the Northern Pacific Re
duce Its Rates.
Special to the Globe.
Sioux Falls, Dak., Dec. 19.— Sioux
Falls is a happy city to-night. Six
months ago the Illinois Central was a
speculation; to-night it is a fact, the
last spike having been driven at 10
o'clock. The tracklayers worked to-day
through a storm (almost a blizzard, and
into the night. When the track was
down Mayor Norton, the city council
and many leading citizens representing
the city, and Supt. M. Gilleas and
officers of the road representing the
road, with the aid of warm furs and
electric lights, drove the golden spike
which marks the completion of the
road. After this ceremony the visitors
were conducted to the Halcyon, where
an elegant supper was served. Gov. L.
K. Church arrived at 10:35. He was
met at the depot by the mayor, citizens
and band and escorted also to the Hal
cyon, where he was given a right,
royal Sioux Falls welcome.
The following were the guests
of the city: Gov. L. K. Church, E. T
Jeffrey, general manager of the Illinois
Central; Horace Tucker.general freight
agent; A. 11. Hanson, general passen
ger agent; J. E. King, private secretary
of the general manager; George M. Nix,
traveling freight agent; J. F. Merry,
general Western passenger agent; M.
Gilleas, general superintendent of the
lowa lines; F.A. Ilill,geiieral engineer;
John Sullivan, roadmaster; E. Wise,
bridge supervisor; C. K. Dickson, train
master; 1). C. Rice, assistant engineer.
A THREE-CENT RATE.
The Railroad Commissioners Are
Determined to Have Their Or
ders Obeyed.
In November the board of railroad
and warehouse commissioners notified
the Manitoba and Northern Pacific
roads that they must make a reduction
in their passenger rates to 8 cents per
mile. This was not done. The com
mission then notified the roads that it
would have printed and posted in the
various stations along the lines of these
two roads in Minnesota a reduced pas
senger rate. As no attention was paid
to either of these notifications, the com
mission has had a circular prepared and
addressed to the traveling public. This
circular notifies all people that the com
mission has reduced passenger fares on
the Northern Pacific road to 3 cents in
Minnesota, and suggests to passengers
to tender the exact amount at the rate
of 3 cents per mile and demand a ticket.
If refused enter the car and make the
same tender. If the conductor demands
more the passenger can select whether
to pay more under protest or stand upon
his legal rights at the risk of being
ejected from the car. The commission
believes that the person so ejected can
recover damages.
Excursionists Homeward Bound.
SALEM, Or., Dec. 19.— California
excursionists who attended the ceremo
nies of the driving oijthe last spike on the
California & Oregon railroad left Ash
land early yesterday, followed by a train

which points snort addresses were made.
The train arrived at Salem at 10:35.
There was a reception at the state cap
itol this morning, after which the jour
ney to Portland was continued.
No Advance Probable.
Chicago, Dec. 19.— 1t is probable that
the $-20 advance in round-trip excursion
rates between the Missouri river and
the Pacific coast recently decided upon
by the transcontinental lines will not go
into effect. The Chicago roads and the
Atchison, it was learned to-day, oppose
the move.
Chips From the Ties.
The general freight agent's department of
the Chicago & Not th western has sent the fol
lowing circular to its agents: Owing to the
crowded condition of the Eastern lines, until
advised to the contrary, you will discontinue

ST. JOHN ROASTS BLAINE
For His Views on Taxing Tobacco
and Liquor.
New Yop.k, Dec.l9.— James G. Blame
received special attention from Prohibi
tionist ex-Gov. John P. St. John in
Cooper Union yesterday. Mr. St. John
addressed the Manhattan Temperance
association. "The greatest men are fed
some time to make the greatest blun
ders," said Mr. St. John. If so, the
reputation of James G. Blame for great
ness has been thoroughly established by
the egregious blunders he has made.
His latest blunder appears in an inter
view published in the Tribune, his per
sonal organ, where he advocates the
repeal of the tax on tobacco,
on the ground that millions of
men use tobacce, and therefore it
is a necessity. "Mr. Blame," continued
the speaker, "opposes the removal of
the tax on the liqi o : traffic because it
would destroy 'h excellent high
license laws son: o' the states have.
Thank God, we lis v.; smoked him out on
that." Mr. St. J< bu continued: "The
sooner the high dense laws are de

says he opposes a! olition of the whisky
tax, because its consumption would
thereby be incre:s.d. Then does not
the same rule apply to tobacco. Ah,
but Mr. Blame avers tobacco is a neces
sity, because, as he says, 95 out of 100
use the weed. If there was the same
proportion of rum drinkers, and gam
blers, and blasphemers, would rum,
swearing and gambling-houses be ne
cessities too. We appeal to our boys
to throw away the accursed and health
destroying cigarette. He replies it is a
necessity."
Have Quit Work.
Chicago, Dec. 19.— One hundred and
thirty-three men, employed by the Min
nesota Granite company, have quit
work. The men all worked by the
piece. Two representatives of the Na
tional union are here attempting to ef
fect a compromise. It is not probable,
the employers think, that the strike
will last long. All work is at present
suspended, except in the polishing de
partment. The company does not at
present contemplate any importation oi
non-union men. The men were em
ployed in cutting stone for the new
Auditorium building, which is the one
in which the national l.epublican con
vention is to be held.
