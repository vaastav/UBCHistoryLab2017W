Declare! Thai Their Opera
tion Should Not Be Stopped
or Interrupted by the Con
ceited Action of Organized
Bodies of Men Until a Pub
lic Investigation Shall Have
Been Instituted.
one of the shortest messages
ever sent to congress President
Wilson urges that early action
be taken to complete his pro
gram of "settlement and regulation"
recoimpended at the last session. The
message In full It at follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty
laid upon me by the constitution of
communicating to you from time to
time information of the state of tike
Union and recommending to your con
sideration such legislative measures as
may be judged necessary and expedi
ent 1 shall continue the practice, which
I hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the repdrts of the several
beads of the executive departments
the elaboration of the detailed needs
of the public service and confine my
self to those matters of more general
public policy with which it seems nec
essary and feasible to deal st the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this sessioli and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible. But there
were some tilings left tindoue at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the Interest of the public
to do at once.
The Railroad Problem.
tn the first place, it seems to me Im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should he aci'orde-l the remaluing
measure.'^ of the program of settlement
tnd regulation which I had occasion to
last session In view of 'lie public dan
gers disclosed ly the uuaA-omuiodated
difficulties which then existed and
which still unhappily continue to ex
ist between the railroads of the coun
try and their locomotive euglueers,
conductors and trainmen.
Second.'(Jie establishment of an eight
hour day as the lejjal basis alike of
work and of wages in the employment
of all railway employees who are ac
tually engaged in the work of operat
ing trains iuterstate transportation-
Third. the aittjioriaati'in pf the ap-»
IKnntmeut 1" the-rpresldeut of a small
liody of men to observe the. actual re
sults in ex|crieuce of the adoption of
tW eight hour day in railway traitspor-
ttitioii £l»fc for the men and for the
railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of tl}e .consideration by the In
terstate commerce cotnniis^fon of an
increase of freight rafes to meet such
additional -elfc^ndiyires by„ the rail
roads as may bave.befcn rendered nec
essary by tbe adoption of tbe eight
hour day and which have no* been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed Justify, the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation aid arbitration
of such controversies as tbe present by
adding it a provision that, in case
the nie&ods of accommodation now
tf-bvided for should faH. a full public
investigation of the merits of every
such -utepufe shall be Instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
-IControl by the Executive.
And. sixth.' the lodgment in the
haudg "rtf 'the executive of the pow«r.
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railways of tbe coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
tbe military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
The second and third of these rec
omtnendations the congress immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight
hoar day as tbe legal basis of work
and wages |n -train service and it au
thorised tbe appointment of a .commis
sion to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed, but
It postponed action upon the otMr sug
gestions until an opportunity should be
offered for a more deliberate consider
ation of them.
The fourth recommendation I do not
deem It necessary to renew. Tbe pow
er or tbe interstate commerce commis
sion to grant an Increase of rates on
tbe ground referred to is indisputably
clear, and a recommendation by tha
congress with regard to such a s»attear
might seem to draw in question the
scope of tbe commission's authority «r
its Inclination ta do Justice when there
Is no reason to doubt ettWr.
The other stv^stlone-ptbe increase
in the Interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and Id Its facilities
for performing its manifold -duties, the
provision fof full .public nvestlgatk»u
and assessment of industrial disputes,
and the grant to the eiecuthre of me

The necessity for such legislation Is
manlfeat and pressing. Those who bar*
Intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would find it
bard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find It practical
ly impossible, with its present member
ship and organisation, to perform Its
preat functions promptly and thorough
ly. but it is not unlikely that it may
presently be Tound advisable to add to
its duties still others equally heavy and
exacting. It must first be perfected as
an administrative instrument.

Ta Safeguard Industrial Processes.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upoo the suggestion ahould I
make it, that any man in any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue In an employment which be da
sired to leave.
To paw a law which forbade or pre
vented the individual workman to l?ave
his work before receiving the approval
of. society in doing so would be to
adopt a uew principle Into our Juris
prudence which I take it for granted
we are not prepared to Introduce. But
the proposal that the operation of the
railways tf tbe country shall not be
#to[Jp^d
or interrupted by the concert-
'*1 action of organized bodies of men
until a public investigation shall have
befn instituted which shall make the
whole question at issue plain for the
Judgment of tfif opinion of the nation
is not to propose any such principle.
It Is based upon the very different
principle .that the concerted action of
powerful bodies of men shall not be
permitted to stop tbe Industrisl pro
cesses of the nation at any rate before
tbe nation shall have had an opportu
nity to acquaint itself with the merits
at tbe cast as between employee and
employer, time to form tts opinion upoo
an impartial statement, ojf .the merits,
and opportunity to consider all practi
cable means of conciliation .or arbitra
tion.
I can see nothing in that proposition
but the Justifiable safeguarding by ao
dety of the necessary processes of Its
very life. There is nothing arbitrary
ar unjust in it unless It be arbitrarily
and, tyijtyrtly done. ean a^nd should
be done with full. an4 »crupulous re

all concerned as well as for the per
manent Interests of society' Itself.
Three matters of capital Importance
await the action of tbe senate which
have already been acted upon by tbe
bouse of representatives—the bill which
seeks to extend -greater freedom of
combination to those engaged In pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of tbe
laws against monopoly, tbe bill amend
ing the present organic law ef Porto
