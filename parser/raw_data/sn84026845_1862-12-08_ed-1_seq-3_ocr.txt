Yorso Mas?We direct attention 10 the
list ol deserters advertised by ?lie Provost
Marshall in another colum^ in the hope
that some of our readers knowing of their
whereabouts may be induced to give infor
mation of them. There is one case which
we happen to know something .of which
seems to merit a passing notice?that of Wi
D. Cunningham, Co. G, 12th Va. Infantry;
\S\ D. C., or William Drake for brevity,
is a disciple of Esculapius, generally knojrn
among bis Acquaintances as Doctor, and j
Iflieved by them to be secesh in his pro
clivities- Ho enlisted at Sbinnston, instl.
gated it is believed by the fear of the draft
and the expectation of the surgeon's com
mission, in both of which alike the Doctor
was disappointed.
While his regiment was in camp on the
I?Iand, William Drake not deeming it pru
deotto in tike an abrupt change in habit
found it necessary to imbibe Urge quanti
ties of alcoholic liquids, and experiencing
trouble iu getting out of camp as often as
he wished, he one day while oat on a pass
procured a pair of lieutenant's shoulder
strap*, and putting them on stealthily as
occasion demanded passed the guards ad
libitum, frequently passing his comrades
oat with him on the strength of his sup
posed official dignity. This lasted some
time, till one day his Captain happened to
discover this ruse de guerre and put a stop
to the Doctor's peregrinations, likewise to
the supply of liquids; all of whioh was be
yond doubt highly disagreeable to the said
William Drake, taken in connection with
the fact about that time a surgeon was ap.
pointed for the regiment, a little enquiry
enabled hiin to discover was not bim
frelf.
About six weeks ago, perhaps, while
the 12th was at Buckhannon, the Doctor
made bis appearance at the place where
he was enlisted, announcing to his friends
thit he had ju9t returned from Wheeling
where he had been commissioned by Gov
ernor Peirpoint as 2d Lieutenant to recruit
for the 15tb Ya. Infantry. He exhibited
what purported to bo his commission,
signed by the Governor, but which it now
appears must have been bogus. The last
seen of him out there by the writer of this
he whs riding a hired horse, booted and
spurred, with a large cargo of stimulant
aboard, just about starting out on a re
cruiting expedition. Our impression is
that he stopped so often along the road to
recruit bis supply of whiskey that he nev
er got any reciuits of any other sort. The
Doctor's military cAreer thus far has been
rather gay, and no donbt be will have more
experience of the same sort when Major
Darr gets hold of him.
J^^Countkrfkit Postage Currkkct.?
The fifty cent notes of the new postage
currency bare been extensively counter
feited. The following directions for their
detection should be observed: 1st?The
paper is thinner tban the genuine. 2d.?
The fife faces of Washington vary consid
erably from each other in the counterfeit?
so much so that two or three of them, if
standing alone, would hardly be taken to
be portraits of Washington?while on the
genuine they all closely resemble each
other. 3d.?The linked letters UU. S.,"
under the middle face of Washington in
the counterfeit, do not show the lower end
of the ?S.," ituidc of the leg of the "U."
while in the genuine tbey do. This mark
is easily seen. 4th.?The border ronnd the
lettering and ??50" on the back of the coun
terfeit is dark, and the lines are crowded,
while in the genuine the border is open,
with a line of light dots running thrpngb
the middle all the way round. In the
counterfeit this middle line is almost invis
ible, while in the genuine it ir-so distinct
as to catch the eve at once.

tOT" Tea Ball at RiTCHiKTowTf.^-fOn
Friday evening last, the largest dancing
party of the season, assembled in one of
the large and commodious upper rooms of i
the new Tannery of Wheat & Sons, in
Hitchietown. The dancing was kept up
from 9 o'clock in the evening till 4 o'clock
on Saturday morning, and we do not re
member when we have witnessed a greater
degree of genuine enjoyment. The whole
affair was conducted with admirable order
and not one thing occurred to mar the hap
pines* of those present. Rjgby and his
band, who discoursed tlie music of the oc
casion, and who were enveloped in Ameri
can flags, were particularly happyin their
performances.

The river continues to recede.steadily at!
this point with fire feet by the pier mark,
lust evening.. TJhe weather yesterday was
raw and cold, and"fears are entertained that
the river will freeze np before, long.
Business continues very qniet and dull at
i the wharf, which may be attributed entire
, ly to the scarcity pf boats. There is plenty
of freight her? watting for shipment, and at
full rates, too, but there are, comparative
lyspeaking,>no.boat*ta receive it.
The R. B. Hamilton, formerly a gunboat,
but now a fine passenger a nd freight craft,
arrived yesterday from Cincinnati with an
excellent trip. She reports leaving the Mel
notte and Partheni&at "Buffi ogion," unable
to get through in consequence of low water.
They, are both heavily loaded, and it Is
doubtful whether they will get up unless
there is more water.

The went tier was cold and cleat yester
do/. The rirer is tailing again at Pitts
burgh, with 5J feet ia the channel. We
h?*e no intelligence from the Kanawha and
Cumberland. Both streams are doubtless
swelling slightly. Here, the river has re
ceded five inches daring the past twenty
four hours. Business continues moderate
ly fair along the levee. The rates to Pitts
burgh ruled at $1 for whisky and oil, GOo.
for Hour, and 800 for pound lots.
Louisville.?TUe Journal, of Thursday,
says:
The river is falling slowly at this point,
with four feet water in thociuial last even

: The Jesse K. Bell, with Ohio soldiers on
board, passed down yesterday.
The silver Cloud, a new Pittsburgher,
passed down for St. Louis, heavily laden.
Ca'pt: Hicks King's new Des Arc will leave
the Portland wharf for Cairo, Hickman,
and Memphis on Saturday.
St. Louis.?The Democrat, of Thursday
day, says .
Three feet scant is reported in the Mis
souri by the West Wind, which arrived
yesterday from St. Joseph.
To Keokuk there is about 41 feet, and no
prospect whatever of improvement before
ice covers the rivers.
There is 6& feet water in the Illinois, and
no likelihood of improving before next
year.
To Cairo there is 6A feet water.
The Mississippi and all its tributaries
above Cairo are falling.
The weather continues cold, and settled
weather ot a wintry kind is expected.
Business is cooling off gradually but
sufcely, the little of winter we have had
having pressed all the boats, or nearly all,
out of the Missouri and the Upper Missis
sippi.
fftap-Sitjlll Change Ourrenct.?There
is now a proposition before our City Coun
cil favoring' the issning of shin plas
ters by the city corporation. Before
any actioni is taken it would be well to ob
serve how the system works elsewhere. In
the city of Cleveland the various shin plas
ters have driven the postage currency out
of circulation just as the postage currency
have the silver. The local of the Leader
has interrogated "the winged winds that
round his pathway roar, but the only re
sponse he* has been able to obtain is?
"postage stamps be blowed." Jle says.'
We have sblnplasters of all colors, sixes
and denominations. Some are worth fifty
cents, some worth a quarter, aoipo worth
fiveaud teu cents; and some ain't worth a
cuss, (excuse the warmth of the expression,
bntwe have recently had several of the lat
ter class poked on to us, and we can't get
rid t>f them, they at e a dead loss.) The
city orders are the most acceptable form
which the shinplastera have assumed, and
people take then readily. Whether or not
they pass enrrent in the interior of.Africa
we can't say.
Tub "Daily Ouskrvjcb.?This is the
title of a new evening pflper, which made
its appearance on Saturday evening. The
Obterctr is published by Hamilton and Sil
vey, both practical printers, and clever, in
dustrious men. The paper is qaite small*
but is neatly printed and promises to be
wide awake. The Observer declares un
mistakably for the war and the Union.'We
heartily wish the new paper and its propri
tore may meet with success. v
Cold Wbathbb is coming as

Tbe difficulties heretofore existing in the

Burnside's order recommending tbe (lis

There had been a tremendous gale at As

the British brig Bolivar and the steamer
Avon, were wrecked. No lives were lost.
The steamer Ocean Queen lost her pad

Tbe U. S. brig Bainbridge was abandon
ed by her officers and crew, after throwing
overboard her guns aud stores.
All communications between Panama
and Aspinwall were suspended, the wires
were broken down and the railroad under
water. It expected to be in running order
by the i!6tb, us tbe water was subsiding.
Nothing new from Central America.
The ship George Washington was over

Another Peace Canard Exploded.
Nkw York, Dec.fi.?The Tribune's Wash
ingtou dispatch says: The statement in
Barney'a letter, printed in to-day's Tribune,
that Harney hud an interview with Presi
dent Lincoln, Is contradicted ou the high
est authority. It is further to be stated on
the sarnu authority, that the President has
no kuowledge whatever of the statements
contained in the letter, and no communica
tion on that subject or embodying such in
formation has been made to him in any
way. Leading Republicans deny all know
ledge of the matter, and the supposition
that this letter has any weight for their al
leged utteution to Barney 8 statements is
entirely erroneous. It may be added that
no recent communication from Fernando
Wood has been received by the Presideut,
and none whatever on these or similar sub
jects.
Private advices from one of the mostem
inuul frieods of America in France, repre
sents that the reeent offer of mediation by
Napoleon is there regarded as expressive
of a deliberate and matured purpose from
which the Emperor won't recede, and that
it ia considered a serious blow to our
cause in Europe, and to the cause of free
dom in Europe not less than in America.
Another Vessel Burnt by the ''Ala
bama."
Boston, Dec. C.?The bark Harriet Spaul-j
ding, Capt. Peabody, from Xew York to j
Havre, was captured and burnt on Nov.
19th, by the pirate Alabama. The crew
were kept irons for several days, but were
finally transferred to the brig Hiram, from
Pieton, which landed them at Fall river.?
Three other crews were also aboard the
Alabama.
LATER.
The above story is probably a hoax, as
no brig Hiram baa arrived at Fall river,
and the Captain of the Spanlding is named
| Wallace, not Peabody.
The owners of the Spaulding state that
Peabody is a swindler and that there is no
j truth in the story.
