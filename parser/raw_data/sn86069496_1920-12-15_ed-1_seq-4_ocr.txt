In our issue of last week we
spoke of the friendly relationship
of the Commonwealth, a Repub
lican paperlpublished at Somer
erset by Mr. R. Mont Feeae, and
the Journal, a Democratic paper
in same town, published by Mr.
Cecil Williams. Our article was
based on a statement made by
a gentleman, close to Mr. Feese,
who had just returned from Som
erset The News stated that
the two papers were published
in the same building, only a par
tition separating them and that
the business waB conducted in
partnership. We learn from the
editors of the two papeas that
we made a mistake; that they
are not,inpartnership and that
the business is conducted entire
ly separate. Mr. Feese has
iiothing whatever to do with the
Sentiment of the Journal and
Mr. Williams is not responsible
for any matter the Common
wealth contains. The offices are
not in the same building, but ad
joining buildings. When the
statement came to us, as we
published last week, we thought
that it was good for brethren to
dwell together in unity, so far a.
Dusinesswas concerned, and su
stated. We knew that neither
one of the gentlemen were for
sale.

also devotes some space to the
tax question. Taking it alto
gether it is a splendidly written
document. The closing para
orranh in his messasre reads: "I
have not so much laid before
you a series of recommendations,
gentlemen, as I sought to utter a
confession of faith, of the faith
in which I was bred and which
it is my solemn purpose to stand
by until my last fighting day. I
believe this to be the faith of
America, the faith of the future,
and of all the victories which
await national action in the days
to come, whether in America or
elsewhere."

The President's last Message
to Congress is the shortest one
he has written since he became
the occupant of the White House.
While it takes up little space it is
full of thruths and sound admoni
tious. He said not a word direct
ly about the League, but you
could tell from certain para
graphs that he had that impor
tant document upon his mind.
It may be that he will take up
the League in another message
to the present Congress. He rec-

THE UNIVERSAL CSfcR
FORD ANNOUNCEMENT.
In considering the extent to which they can further the growth of Ford dealers gen
erally, the building up of their individual organization, and the extent to their activi
ties. The Ford Motor Co., have permitted us to operate in unrestricted territory. But
knowing that we can not give the proper after service to our friends and customer who
live beyond our territory, we have decided to confine our activities to Taylor and Adair
counties. By increasing our organization and strengthening it, it places us in a better
position to look after our old and new customers in after service, and places us also in
a position to offer time sales to all who have not felt, during the past, that they were
able to pay for a new Ford Car or Tractor at the time of its purchase. We are now
prepared to offer the buyer our time sale proposition. Insurance on the car and the in
terest are the only additions the buyer is required to pay.
