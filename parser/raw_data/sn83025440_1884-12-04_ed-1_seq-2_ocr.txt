THE SEWSBOYS'S CAT.
BY E. T. COBBETT.
Want any paper, mister?
Wish you'd JLuy 'em of me—
Ten years old, an* a lam'ly,
An' bizness dull, yon see.
Fact, boss! There's Tom an* Tibby,
An' Dad, an' Mom, an' Mam's cat.
None on 'em earnin' monev—
What do yon think ot that?
Couldn't Dad work? Why yes, Boss.
He's working for cov'mcnt now—
They give him his board for nothin'—
All along of a drunken row.
An' Mam? Well, she's in the poorhouse—
Been there a year or so
Eo I'm taken care of the other,
Doin' as well as know.
Oughtn't to live eo? Why, mister.
What's a feller to do?
Some nights, when I'm tired and hungry.
Seems as if each on 'em know—
They'll all three cuddle around me,
Till I get cheery, and say:
Well, p'raps I'll have sisters an' brothers
An' money, an' clothes, too, some day.
But if 1 do get rich, Eoss,
(An* a lecturin' chap one night
Bald newsboys could be Presidents
If only thev acted right'
Eo, if 1 was President, mister,
'J he very first I'd do,
I'd buy roor Tom. an' Tibby
A dinner—an' Mam's cat, tool
Kone o" your scraps an' leavin'e,
But a good square meal for all three:
If yon think I'd tkimp my friends, Boss,
That shows you don't know m'\
So ere's your papers—come, take one.
Gimme a litt if you can—
For now you've heard my story,
You see I'm a fam'ly man!
XKIFLES.
As I gave you?
f:
Uncle Malachi had three loves—his
cat, Mike, his garden, and his daughter
Doralhy.
This cat was the wonder of the vil
lage. "Mike1* was a name used only by
intimate friends and near relatives.
His full court title, and that used by
the vulgar herd, was "Dark Michael
Schlem"—a name given him far back
in his early youth by some unknown
benefactor, and which was peculiarly
appropriate, inasmuch as it had been
once borne by a certain Russian Chief
of Police remarkable for great sagacity
and penetration. Mike was not attrac
tive at first sight. It was whispered in
his youth he had been noted for his
manly, or rather tom-catly grace and
beauty. But the meridian of his
charms, so to speak, had been passed.
His tail was gone. Likewise one eye.
His left ear, too, had a forlorn appear
ance—probably mournful at the ab
sence of its mate, which had been lost
in the same nnluck fray in which the
tail vanished. Portions of his hide had
also been denuded of the covering with
which Nature had provided it But
Mike's lofty soul soared above these
petty vexations. His friends soon for
got his rather dubious physical appear
ance in admiration of his rare intellect
ual qualities. There was in his every
action such an indefinable air of mys
tery, of preconceived and elaborate de
sign, and a-me n, withal, of such lofty
and serene dignity, that not only was
the beholder's wonder and surprise
aroused, but his respect was
commanded
as welL No one, probably, was more
thoroughly impressed with the abilities
of this remarkable animal than Uncle
Malachi Sometimes, after indulging
in several cup3 of triple-strength tea,
which was Uncle Malachi's sole weak
ness—if tea of such strength can be
called a weakness—he had been known
to say, with much empressement,
"Michael, thou art a wonderful cat
which remark was plainly understood
by Mike, for, though at the time mew
ing in a deprecating manner, as though
disclaiming all pretensions to great
ness, it was nevertheless observed that
for some hours thereafter his natural
hauteur would be largely increased.
He was not on the best terms with Miss
Dorothy. There was acertain youthful
giddiness and flippancy about her
which did not meet his approval. True,
he always treated her with courtly po
liteness in consideration of her father's
feelings, but nevertheless there was a
considerable coldness between them.
If he had not, however, been utterly
impervious to the attractions of female
beauty, this coldness could never have
existed. There surely never was a more
charming bit of femininity than Miss
Dorqthy. Her wealth of nut-brown
hair, her little snub nose, her gleaming
teeth, her shell-tinted ears, her spark
ling, dancing eyes, her dainty waist, all
made up a picture of butterfly beauty
as delightful as it was lovable. But
little Miss Dorothy was no shallow
minded doll. She had a heart of ster
ling purity and nobility, and inherited
from her father the grave and gentie
sweetness of disposition which charac
terizes the Quakers.
Miss Dorothy had that indispensable
possession of every truly sensible young
lady—a lover.
Edward Wadham had not been in the
village for a long time. His home was
there but he had been away at college,
and now returned for the first time in
five years. He was surprised to find
that his former playmate and partner
in the mud-pie business had grown to
be a very charming and self-possessed
little woman. He was a great, curly
haired, black-eyed, rollicking giant, and
the first thing he did was to fall in love
urith dainty Dorothy Dill, and she re
turned the compliment warmly. In a
very short time, therefore, they were
talking of love in a cottage, and devis
ing financial plans of surprising acute
ness for the economical administration
and occupation of said cottage.
fe~
Miss Dorothy was now walking in her
father's garden awaiting the approach
of Mr. Wadham. The garden was a
good spot for a lover's trvsting-place.
It was inclosed on three sides by a
high stone wall and on the fourth by
the house:' Shade-trees were dotted
around, and sweet-smelling flowers
filled the spaces between the trees. So
completely was the sky obscured by
the foliage that the place seemed to be
a floral cavern rather than a garden.
This little garden was Uncle Malachi's
peculiar care and pride. Here he was
accustomed to spend a considerable
put of his time, sometimes spading and
hoeing, watering a plant here, pulling
up a, weed there, encouraging some
timid bud, or sitting under one of the
trees attended by his guide, philosopher
and friend, the redoubtable Mike, al
ternately caressing that noble animal
and taking mighty draughts of Young
Hyson.
Pretty soon Miss Dorothy heard a
familiar step on the walk outside, and
immediately began to manifest deep
interest in a rose she held in her hand
—pulling the petals aside, looking care
fully between them one by one, turning
the flower upside down and gazing
anxiously at the lower side, and alto
gether giving tbe beholder the idea
that she had lost a lage sum of money
and strongly suspected that it had
found lodgment in the depth of the
rose. In consequence of this absorbing
occupation she was greatly surprised
when two hands covered her eyes and
two lips kissed hers with a sounding
smack.
"O! O! Who is it?" exclaimed this
poor bewildered maiilen.
"It's only me," said Ned, removing
his bands from lier eyes, under the
fond impression that he was giving her
a great surprise.
"O, then, I don't mind," said she,
with such a rad.'ant b'ush that he found
it necessary to repeat a certain part of
his former proceedings—which part I
won't say.
Then his arm and her head assumed
the conventional attitude, and they
walked around the garden, chatting
volubly. I
"l'ou don't know how lonely I've
been since you went away j'esterday,"
said she.
"Too bad, too bad," said he soothing-

What will it matter in a little while,
That fo a day
We met and gave a word, a touch, a smile,
Upon the way.
What will It matter whether hearts were brave,
And lives were true
That you gave me the sympathy I crave
These trifles! Can It be they make or mar
Human life?
Are souls as lightly swayed as rushes are
By loveor stife?
Tea, yea a look the fainting heart may break,
Or make it whole
And just one word, if said for love's sweet

MALACHI DILL'S REMARKABLE
CAT.
Perhaps the reader lias heard of the
Town of Soskowigh, Indiana, commonly
pronounced "Sosky" by its inhabitants.
It is nothing but a conn try town,
and like
most country towns has its local "char
acter"—its odd genius, 'ihe odd genius
in this case happened to Malachi Dill,
usually called "Uncle Malachi." A
good old man was Uncle Malachi, and
eke a Quaker. He was born in the vil
lage, and had lived there all his life
except a period of about six months,
daring which he had paid a visit to
some relatives of his who lived in New
England—an adventure of which Uncle
Malachi was never tired of talking.
TTia face, seamed and wrinkled by many
a year of toil, beamed with benevolence
and good-will. Good old man, I seem
to see him yet, walking down some
shady lane in "Sosky," smiling and
bowing to his acquaintances, clad in
snuff-colored garments of ancient cut,
with his white beaver hat, his large
buckled shoes, and his red bandana
flung to the breeze from its retreat in
his coat-tail pocket. Uncle Malachi
had not an enemy. Good old soul, he
had never spoken an unkind word to
man or beast. The very. birds loved
him and fluttered'to meet him, sure of
getting their fill of crumbs and cher
ries. It was a pretty sight to see him
taking his stroll of a sunny afternoon,
little children chirping Tound him, lit
tle birds chirping above him.
I
"Yes, and I've got the loveliest idea,"
said she, with sudden animation. I
went to the store to-day, and they have
got the prettiest wall-paper. It's made
to represent platters and plates and
knives and forks. Now wouldn't it be
por ectly splendid to put that in the
dinning-room so appropriate, you I
know.
'"Yes, and I've got one, too," said he,
struck with a brilliant idea. "Let's
get a lot of ctures of fruit, and game,
and everything of that kind, and hang
them around on the walls. What do
you think of that
"Splendid," said she. "But—O! O!
Let's have the floor covered \?ith Turk
ish rugs ornamented with figs, and
chickens, and venison, and cherries, and
—everything. That would be awful
nice. The rugs-would cost only about
$20 apiece, and ten of them would easi
ly cover the dining-room."
"Well, but, my dear," said Ned, dubi
ously. "We can't stand the expense.
Just think of it—$200 for one room."
"O, well, never mind the expense on
the dining-room," said she. "Don't you
know, some great person, Oscar Wilde
or somebody, says—well, something or
another, I don't exactly remember
what—anyway, it meant that you ought
to make the dining-room pleasant, even
if you don't fix the rest of the house so
well."
"Oscar Wilde may be all right, but
we can't put $200 into the dining-room,
that's certain. A carpet will do just as
well, and wouldn't cost an eighth of the
money."
"Well, but I don't want a carpet—I
want rugs. I think I might have my
own way once in a while."
"I'm willing you should have your
own way to a reasonoble extent, but
this is too much. We'll have a carpet,
that's flat."
'And I say we'll have rugs," said
the demure maiden, with sudden
anger.
'And I say a carpet," said he, equally
angry.
•Rugs!"
"Carpet!"
"Very well, sir, you can have whatev
er you desire," she said, with sudden
and blood-curdling calmness. "I don't
wan't to marry a man with such an aw
ful temper. Here is your ring."
"Thank you, madam, and here is
yours. Good-day."
He turned on his heel and left her,
while she, after gazing at his receeding
form with great indignation, ran hastily
up to her own room.
Mike had observed this scene from
his lofty eyrie in one of the trees with
feelings of increasing amazement and
alarm. Tim loud bickering and alter
cation shocked his ideas of dignity and
decorum. .Why those vociferous re
marks? Why this sudden parting?
As a friend of the family he deemed it
best to follow and investigate the do
ings of his young mistress. So he
stepped unobtrusively into her room,
and, taking up his station on the hearth
rug, watched the development of
events.
Miss Dorothy marched straight up to
her room and sat down. Here she re
signed herself to angry recollections of
the late interview. It was'all over now
between her and Ned, and she told her
self she was glad of it. And yet how
handsome and proud he looked, with
his face pale a3 death and his swelling
nostrils and shining eyes, and how clear
and ringing his voice sounded. After
all, what was it they had quarreled
about A mere nothing—whether they
should have a carpet or rugs on the
floor. And he had been right, too.
Two hundred dollars was too much for
one room. She ought to have deferred
to his opinions, anyway. Was it not
his right to command! How obstinate
and unreasonable she had been. Poor
fellow, he must be feeling awful bad.
Maybe he would kill himself, or become
a misanthrope, or something awful.
Merely as a matter of charity it might
be best for her to yield in this instance
—yes, merely as a matter of charity.
Not that she cared anything about a
reconciliation herself—O, no. So she
wrote him a note:
NED: Somebody is awful angry now, I guss.
Come back, darling. It shall be carpets, or
matting, or anything you want. DODV.
She read this over two or three times,
and was beginning to feel quite pleased
with herself in the character of self
sacrificing philanthropist,
when she sud
denly happened to ask herself ho .v he
would receive her note. Probably, after
reading it, he would say, with a com
placent smirk:
"Poor fool, how she adores me.
Come back, darling.' Ha, ha I"
And then he would saunter into the
garden with negligent ease, and, after
receiving her penitent confession, for
give her and graciously allow her to
renew the engagement. Horrible! And
Miss Dorothy threw the letter into the
grate and left the room.
Mike saw the episode of the letter,
and concluded that he would look at it
more closely, so pawed it out of the
grate and began to examine it. Some
thing in the way the paper was twisted
struck his latent sense of humor, and
with a sudden accession of youthful
spirits he began to worry and chase it
around the room. Finally, becoming
tired of this paper, he jumped up on
the window-sill to rest from his ardu
ous labors. The paper, however, stuck
to his claws and went up with him.
This annoyed him, and he began to
claw at it, finally being successful in
jerking it off, whence it flew down into
the street. Ned Wadham happened to
be passing at this moment, and the note
fell directly in front of him. His heart
gave a great bound as he stooped to
pick it up. He scanned its contents in
a moment and then looked up at the
window. Seeing nothing there but a
rather disreputable-looking old tom-cat,
he concluded that Dorothy had thrown
the note at him and hidden herself.
Wild with joy, he rushed into the
garden, and, seeing Dorothy there, fell
down on his knees before her and cried
out:
Dody, Dody, darling, forgive me. I
was wrong, all wrong. It shall be ruga
—nothing but rugs. We'll paper the
walls with rugs if you'll only say the
word."
She, imagining that he had taken the
first step, raised him up, threw herself
into his arms, and
I draw the veil on what followed, and
will only remark that they never found
out the mistake, compromised on waxed
floors, and had no more quari els.
LIFE is a series of surprises, and
would not be worth taking or keeping,
if it were not. God delights to isolate
ns every day, and hide from us the past
and future,—Experience.

INTRODUCTORY.
THE ELECTION LAW3.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.—To the congress of the
United States: Since the close of your last ses
sion the American people in the exercise of the
highest right of soflrase have chosen their
chief magistrate for the four years ensuing.
When it is remembered that, in no period in the
country's history, has the long political contest
which customarily precedes the day of the na
tional election, been waged with greater fervor
and intensity, it is a subject of congratulation
that after the controversy at the polls was over,
and while the slight preponderance by which the
issue had been determined was as yet unascer
tained, the public peace suffered no disturbance,
but the people everywhere patiently and quietly
awated the result. Nothing could more strik
ingly illustrate the temper of the American citi
zen, his love of order, and his loyalty to the law
—nothing could more signally demonstrate the
strength and wisdom of oar political institu
tions.
Kight years have passed since the controversy
concerning the suit of a national eleetion
sharply called the attention of congress to
the necessity of providing more jirecise aud defi
nite regulations for counting the electoral
votes. It is of the gravest importance that this
Question be solved before conflicting claims to
the presidency shall again distract the country,
and I am persuaded tnat by the people at large
any of the measures of relief thus tar proposed
w.iuld be preferred to continued inaction.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
CONTINUE AMICABLE.
Our relations with all foreign powers continue
to be amicable. With Belgium a convention has
been signed whereby the scope of the present
treaties has been so enlarged as to secure to the
idtizens of either country within the jurisdiction
cf the other, equal rights and privileges in the
acquisition and alienation of property. A trade
mark treaty has also been concluded.
The war between Chili and Peru is at an end.
I'"or the arbitration of the claims of American
citizens who during its continuance suffered
through the acts of Chilian authorities, a con
vention will soon be negotiated.
The state of hostilities between France and
China continues to be an embarrasser of the
future of our eastern relations. The Chinese
government has promptly adjusted and paid tho
claims of American citizens whose property was
destroyed in the recent riots at Canton. 1 renew
the recommendation of my last annual message
that the
CANTON INDEMNITY FUND
be returned to China. The true interpretation of
the recent treaty with that country permitting
the restriction of Chinese immigration, is likely
to be again the subject of your deliberations. It
may be seriously questioned whether the statute
passed at tho last session does not violato the
treaty rights of certain Chinese who left
this country with return certificates, valid under
the old law, and now seem to be debarred from
landing from lack of certificates required by the
new.
Tho recent purchase by the United States of a
large trading fleet heretofore under the Chinese
flag has considerably enhanced our commercial
importanco in the east. In view of tho large
number of vessels built or purchased by Ameri
can citizens in other count ries. and exclusively
employed in legitimate tralhc between foreign
points, under the recognized protection of our
flag, it might be well to provide a uniform rate
for their registration and documentation, that
the bona fide property rights of our citizens
therein shall be duly evidenced and the property
guarded.
TIIE CONGO BASIN.
Pursuant to the advice of the senate in tho last
session, I recognized the flag of the international
association of the congress of that of a friendly
government, avoiding in so doing any prejudg
ment of conflict in territorial claims in that re
gion. Subsequently, in the execution of tho ex
pressed wish of the congress, I appointed a com
mercial agent for the Congo basin. 'Ihe impor
tance of the rich prospective trade of the Congo
valley has led to the general conviction that it
should be open to all nations upon equal terms.
The international conference for the considera
tion of this subject, called by the emperor of
Germany, is now in session at Berlin. Delegates
are now in attendance on behalf of the United
States. The reeulta of the conference you will
lie duly advised of.
LEGATION PREMISES IN THE EAST.
The government of Corea has generously aided
the efforts of the United States minister to'secure
suitable premises in the use of the legation. The
conditions of diplomatic intercourse with east
ern nations demand that the legation premises
be owned by the represented power. 1 advise
that an appropriation bo made for the acquisition
of this property by the government. The United
States already possesses valuable premises at
Tanzies as a gift from the sultan of Morocco, as
is stated hereafter. They have lately received a
similar gift from the Siamese government. The
government of Japan stands ready to sell to us
extensive grounds at Tokio. wherein to erect a
suitable building for tho
legation. A court-house
and jail and similar privileges can probably be
secured in China and Persia. The owning of such
premises wonld not effect a largo saving of the
present rentals, but would permit of the due
assertion of extra territorial rights in those coun
tries and would the better serve to maintain the
dignity of the United States.
RELATIONS WITH EGYPT.
The failure of congress to make appropriation
for our representative at the Ottoman court
of the khediye has proved a eerions embarrass
ment in our intercourse with Egypt, and in view
of the necessary intimacy of the diplomatic rela
tionships, due to the participation of this gov
ernment of the treaty powers in all matters of
administration effecting tho rights of foreigners,
I advise the restoration of the agency and con
sulate-general at Cairo on its former basis. I do
not conceive it to be the wish of congress that
the United States should withdraw altogether
from the favorable position they have hitherto
held with respect to the khedive, or that citizens
of this republic residing or sojourning in Egypt
should hereafter bo without the aid and protec
tion of a competent representative.
WITH FRANCE
the traditional cordial relationship continues.
The Bartholdi statue of libertj- enlightening the
world, the generous gift of the people of Franco,
is expected to reach New York in May next. I
suggest that congressional action be taken in
relation to the spirit which has prompted this
gift, and in aid of the timely completion of tho
pedastal upon which it is to DO placed.
OUR RELATIONS WITH GERMANY,
a country which contributes to our own some of
the best elements of citizenship, continue to be
cordial. The United States have extradition
treaties with several of the German states, but by
reason of the confederation of these states under
the imperial rule the application of such treaties
is not as uniform and comprehensive as the in
terests of the two countries require, therefore
we should open negotiations for a singlo con
vention of extradition, to embrace all tho territo
ries of the empire.
It affords me pleasure to say that our
INTERCOURSE WITH GREAT BRITAIN
continues to be of a most friendly character.
The government of Hawaii has indicated its
willingness to continue for seven years tho nre
visions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such
a continuance, in view of the relations of that
country to the American system of states, should,
in my judgement, ba favored.
The revolution in Hayti against the established
government has terminated. Wliile it was in
tropress it became necessary to enforce our neu
trality laws by instituting proceedings ugainst
their infringements. These prosecutions were in
all cases successful. Much anxiety has lately
been displayed by the various European govern
ments, and especially by the government of Italy,
for the abolition of our import duties upon tho
.works of art.
It is well to consider whether the present dis
criminations in favor of the productions of
American artists abroad is not likely to result,
as they themselves seem very generally to believe
it may, in the practical exclusion of our painters
and sculptora from the rich field for observation,
study and labor, which they have hitherto en
Joyed.
There is prospect that the long-pending revis
ion of the
FOREIGN TKBATIES OF JAPAN
may be concluded at anew conference to be held
at 'i'okio. While this government fully recog
nizes the equal and independent station of Japan
in the community ot nations, it wonld not op
pose the general adoption of such terms of com
promise as Japan may be dispos to offer.
In the furtherance of an uniform policy of
INTERCOURSE WITn WESTERN NATIONS
during the past year .the increasing good will
between our own government and that of Mexico
lias been variously manifested. The treaty of com
mercial reciprocity, concluded January 20, 18&J,
has heen ratified and awaits the necessary tariff
legislation of congress to become offective. The
legislation will, 1 doubt not, be among the first
measures to claim your attention. A foil treaty
of commerce, navigation and consular rights, is
'much to be desired, and such a treaty I have reo
sonto believe that the American government
stands ready to conclude. Soino embarrassment
has been occasioned hy tho failure of congress at
ts last session to provide meens for the due oxo
eutionofthe treaty of Jnlv 2!*, 1882, for tho re
survey of tho Mexican boundary nnd the re-loca
tion of the boundary monuments.
With the republic of Nicaragua a treaty has
been concluded which authorizes the construc­
tion by the United States of a canal railway and
telegraphic line across the Nicaragua territory.
By the terms of this treaty sixty miles of the
river Ban Juan, as well as Lake Nicaragua, an
inland sea forty miles in width, are to constitute
a part of the projected enterprise. This covers
for actual canal construction seventeen miles on
the Pacific side and thirty-six miles on the At
lantic to the United States, whose rich territory
on the Pacific is, for the ordinary purposes of
commerce, practically cut off from communica
tion by water with tho Atlantic ports. The po
litical and commercial advantages of such a pro
ject can scarcely be overestimated. It is be
lieved that when the treaty has been laid before
you the justice and liberality of its provisions
will command universal approval at home and
abroad.
'Ihe death of our representative at Russia
while at his post at St. Petersburg afforded to
tho imperial government a renewed opportunity
to testify its sympathy in a manner befitting the
intimate friendliness which has ever marked the
intercourse of the two countries.
RELATIONS WITH SIAM.
The course of this government in raising its
representation at Bangkok to the diplomatic
rank has evoked from Siam evidence of warm
friendship, ami angurs well for our enlarged in
tercourse. The Siamese government has pre
sented to the United States a commodious inan
ition and grounds for the occupancy of the lega
tion, and I Buggest that by joint resolution con
gress attest its appreciation of this generous
gift.
this government has more than once been
called upon of late to take action in tho fulfill
ments of its international
OBLIGATIONS TOWARD SPAIN,
agitation in the island of Cuba hostile to the
Spanish crown having been fermented by per
sons abusing the sacred rights of hospitality
which our territory affords. The officers of the
government have been instructed to exercise
vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality
laws at Key West and other points near the
Cuban coast. 1 am happy to bay that in the only
instnnco where the*e precautionary measures
were successfully c-luded, the offenders, when
found in our territory, were subsequently tried
and convicted.
The growing need of close relationship in in
tercourse and traffic between
TUB SPANISH ANTILLES
and their natural market in the United States
led to the adoption, in January last, of a com
mercial agreement looking to that end. This
agreement has since been superceded by a more
carefully framed and comprehensive convention,
which I shall submit to the senate for approval.
It has been the aim of this negotiation to open
such a favored reciprocal exchange of produc
tions, carried under tho flag of either country, as
to make the intercourse between Cuba and Porto
liico and ourselves scarcely less intimate than
the commercial movement between our domestic
ports, and to insure a removal of the burdens on
shipping in the Spanish Indies, of which in the
past our ship owners and ship masters have so
often had cause to complain. Tho negotiation
of this convention has for the time been post
!oned, and the prosecution of certain claims of
our citizens which were declared to be without
the jurisdiction of the Spanish-American claimB
commission, we therefore remitted to diplomatio
channels for adjustment. The speed of settle
ment of these claims will now bo urged by this
government.
Negotiations for a treaty of commercial
reciprocity with the Dominican republic have
been successfully concluded, and the result will
shortly be laid before the senate. Certain ques
tions between tho United Statos and
THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
still remain unsolved. Complaints in behalf of
our citizens are not satisfactorily adjusted. The
porte has sought to withhold from our commerce
the right of favored treatment to which we are
entitled by existing conventional stipulation,
and the revision of the tariff is unaccomplished.
The final disposition of
PENDING QUESTIONS WITH VENEZUELA
has not as yet been reached, but I have good
reasons to expect an early settlement, which will
provide the means of re-exchanging the Caracas
awards in conformity with the expressed desiro
of congress, and which will recognize the justice
of certain claims preferred against Venezuela.
The Central and South Ainericm commission,
appointed by authority of the act ef July 7, 1884,
will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been fur
nished with instructions which will be laid be
fore you. They contain a statement of the gen
eral policy of the government for enlarging its
commercial intercourse with Amorican states.
The commissioners have been actively preparing
for the responsible task by holding conferences
in tho principal cities with merchants and others
interested in Central and South American trade.
THE INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAH CONFERENCE,
lately convened in Washington upon the invita
tion of the government of the United States, was
composed of representatives from twenty-five
nations. The conference concluded its labors on
the 1st of November, having, with substantial
effect, agreed upon the meridian of Greenwich as
the starting point whence longitude is to be com
pared through ISO degrees eastward and west
ward, and upon the adoption for all purposes for
which it may bo found convenient of a universal
day which shall begin at midnight on the initial
meridian, and whose hours shall be counted from
zero up to 21. The formal report of the trans
actions of the conference will be hereafter trans
mitted to congress.
INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS.
This government is in frequent receipt of in
vitations from foreign states to participate in in
ternational exhibitions, often of great interest
and importance. Occupying, as we do. an ad
vanced position in the world's production, and
aiming to secure a profitable share for our indus
tries in the general competitive markets, it is a
matter of serious concern that the want of means
for participation in these exhibits should so
often exclude our producers from the advant
ages enjoyed by those of other countries. Dur
ing the past year the attention of congress was
drawn to the formal invitations in this regard
extended by the governments of England, Hol
land, Belgium, Germany and Austria. The ex
ecutive has, in some instances, appointed hon
arary commissioners. This is, however,
a most unsatisfactory expedient, for
without some provision to meet the
necessity of tho working expenses
of a commission, it can effect little or nothing in
behalf of exliibitors An international inventors'
exhibition is to be held in London next May.
This will cover afield of special importance, in
which our country holds a foremost rank, but
the executive is at present powerless to organize
a proper representation of our vast national in
terests in this direction. I have in several pre
vious messages referred to this subject. It
seems to me that a statute, giving to tho execu
tive general discretionary authority to accept
such invitations and to appoint honorary com
missioners without salary, and placing at the
disposal of the secretary of state a small fund for
defraying their reasonable expenses, would bo of
great public utility.
MARATIME RELATIONS.
This government has received official notice
that the revival of international regulations for
tho preventing of collisions at sea have been
adopted by all the leading maratime powers ex
cept the United States, and came into force on
the 1st of September last. For tho due protec
tion of our snipping interests the provisions of
our statutes should at once be brought into con
formity with these regulations.
The question of securing to authors, com
posers and artists,
COPYRIGHT PRIVILEGES
in this country in return for reciprocal rights
abroad, is one that may justly challenge your
attention. It is true that a convention will be
necessary for fully accomplishing this result.
But until congress shall, by statnte, fix the ex
tent to which foreign holders of copyrights shall
be here privileged, it has been deemed unad
visablo to negotiate such a convention. For this
reason the United States were not represented
at the recent conference at Berlin.
1 recommend that the scope of
THE NEUTRALITY LAWS
of the United States be so enlarged as to
cover all patent acts of hostility committed in
our territory and aimed against the peaco of a
friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the
fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict
the shipment of explosives. Though the enact
ments in the latter respect were not framed with
regard to international obligations, bnt simply
for the protection of passenger travel, all these
statutes were intended to meet special emergen
cies that had already arisen. Other emergencies
have arisen since, and modern ingenuity supplies
means for the organization of hostilities without
open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering
parties. I see no reason why overt preparations
in this country for the commission of criminal
acts, such as are under consideration, should not
be alike punishable, whether such acts are in
tended to be committed in our own country or
in a foreign country with which we are at peace.
The Drompt and thorough treatment of this
question is one which immediately concerns our
national honor.
Our existing
NATURALIZATION LAWS
also need revision. Those sections relating to
persons residing within the limits of the United
States within 1795 and 1798 have now only a his
torical interest section 2,172, recognizing the
citizenship of the children of naturalized parents,
is ambiguous in its terms, and partly obsolete.
There are special provisions of law favoring the
naturalization of those who serve in the army or
in merchant vessels, while no similar privileges
are granted to those who serve in the navy or
marine corps. An uniform rule of nutralization,
such as the constitution contemplates, should,
among other things, clearly define the status of
persons who have been within the United States
subject to a foreign power (section 1,992), and of
minor children of fathers who have declared
their intention of becoming citizens, bat
have failed to perfect their naturalization.
It might be wise to provide for a central bureau
of registry, wherein should bo filed authenticated
transcripts of every record of naturalization in
the several federal and state courts, and to make
provision also for the vacation or cancellation of
such record in cases where fraud lmd been prac
ticed upon the court by the applicant himself, or
where he had removed or forfaited his acquired
citizenship. A just and uniform law in this
respect would strengthen the hands of the gov
ernment in protecting its citizens abroad, and
would pave the way for the conclusion of trea
ties of naturalization with foreign countries.
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE.
The legislation of tho last session effocted in
the diplomatic and consular services certain
changes and reductions which have boon produc
tive of embarassment. The population and com
mercial activity of our country are constantly on
tho increase, and are giving nso to new, varying,
and often delicate relationship with other coun
tries. Our foreign establishment now embraces
nearly double the area of operations that it did
twenty years ago. The confinement of such a
service within the limits of expenditure then es
tablished is not, it seems to me, in accordance
with trae economy. A community of 60.000,000
of people should be adequately represented in its
intercourse with foreign nations. A project for
tho reorganization of tho consular service, and
for recasting of the scheme of extra territorial
jurisdiction, is now before you. If the limits of a
short session will not allow its full considera
tion, I trust you will not fail to make
suitable provision for the present needs for the
service. It lias been customary to define in the
appropriation acts the rank of each diplomatic
office to which a salary is attached. 1 suggest
(hat this course be abandoned and that it be
left,to
the president, with the advice and consent of the
senate, to fix from time to time the diplomatic
grade of the representatives of this government
abroad, as may seem advisable, provisions be
ing definitely made, however, as now for the
amount of salary attached to tho respective sta
tions.
ins river and harbor improvements
and arsenal 89,429,608.88
For the nival establishment, includ
ing vessels, machinery and im
provements at the navy yards 17,292,601.44
For miscellaneous expenditures, in

For the sinking fund 46,790,229.50
Total ordinary expenditures 290,916,483.8B
Leaving a surplus of $57,603,396.09
As compared with the preceding fiscal year,
there was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 in
the amount of the expenditures. The aggregate
receipts were lees than those of the year previous,
by about 454,000,000. The falling off of revenues
from customs made up nearly $3.000,0U0 of this
deficiency and about :23,000,000 of the remainder
was due to the diminished receipts from internal
taxation. The secretary estimates the total
receipts for the fiscal year, which will end June
30. 1885, at $330,000,000, and the total expendi
tures at $290,620,311. 16, in which is included the
interest on the debt and the amount payable to
the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus
for the entire year of about $39,000,000.
THE VALUE OF EXPORTS
for the United States to foreign countries during
the year ending June 30,1884, was as follows:
Domestic merchandise .. $72f,9f1.852
Foreign merchandise 15,518,757
Total merchandise 0.518,509
Specie 183,383
Total exports of merchandise and

I concur with the secretary of the treasury in
recommending the immediate
SUSPEASION OF THE COINAGE OF SILVER
DOLLARS
and the issue of silver certificates. This is a
matter to which in former communications I
have more than once invoked the attention of
the national legislature. It appears that an
nually for the past six years there have been
coincd, in compliance with the requirements of
the act of February 28, 1878, more than -'7.1
TRADE DOLLARS
have ceased for the present at least, to bo an ele
ment of active disturbance in our currency system,
some provision should be made for their surren
der to the government. In view of the cir
cumstances under which they were coined,
and of the fact that they have never had a
legal tender quality, there should be offered for
them only a slight advance over their bullion
value.
The secretary, in the course of his report, con
siders the propriety of beautifying the designs of
our subsidiary silver coins, rnd of so increasing
their weight tnat they may bear their due ratio
of value of the standard dollars. His conclu
sions in this regard are cordially approved.
In my annual message of 1S82 I recommended
the
ABOLITION OF ALL EXCISE TAXES
except those relating to distilled spirits. This
recommendation is now renewed. In case these
taxes shall be abolished tho revenue that will
still remain to tho government will, in my opin
ion. not only suffice to meet its reasonable ex
penditures, but will afford a surplus large
enough to permit such tariff reduction as may
seem to be advisable when the results of the re
cent revenue laws and commercial treaties sfmll
have shown in what quarters these reductions
can be most judiciously effected. One of
THE GRAVEST OF THE PROBLEMS
which appeal to the wisdom of congress
for a solution is the ascertainment
of the most effective means of in
creasing our foreign trade and thus reliev
ing the depression^ under which our industries
are now languishing. The secretary of tho
treasury advises that tho duty of investigating
this subject ba entrusted in the first instance
to a competent commission. While fully recog
nizing the considerations that may be urged
against this course. I am nevertheless of the
opinion that upon the wholo no other would be
likely to effect speedier or better results.
That portion of the secretary's report which
concerns
THE CONDITION OF OUR SHIPPINO
interests cannot fail to command your attention.
He emphatically recommends that as an incen
tive to the investment of American capital in
American steamships, the government shall be
liberal in its payments for mail transportation
or otherwiso lend its active assist
ance to individual enterprises declares his
belief that if that course be not pursued our for
eign carrying trade must remain as it is to-day,
almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners.
One phase of this subject is nowespocially prom
inent in view of the repeal of the act of June 28,
1S84, of all salatary provisions arbitrarily com
pelling American vessels to carry the mails to
and from the United Statos, as it is necessary to
make provisions to compensate tho owners of
such vessels for performing that service after
April, 1885. It is hoped that the whole subject
will recoive the early consideration that will lead
to the enactment of such measures for the re
newal of our merchant marine as tho wisdom of
congress may devise.
BOND TRANSACTIONS.
The 3 per cent, bonds of the governmont to the
amount of more than $!0,l)00,tXX) have since my
last annual message been redeemed by the treas
ury. The bonds of that issue still outstanding
amount to a little over $200,000,000. about one
fourth of which will be retired through the
operations of the sinking fund act during the
coming years. As those bonds continue the chief
basis for the circulation of the national banks,
the question of how to avert the contraction of
the currency caused by their retirement is one of
constantly increasing importance, it seems to
be generally conceded that the law governing
this matter exacts from the banks excessive
security, and that upon their present bond de
posits a larger circulation than is now allowed
•cay be granted with safety. I hope that the bill
which passed the senate at the last session per
mitting the issue of notes equal to tho face value
of tho deposited bond will commend itself to the
approval of the house of representatives.
THE WAR AND NAVY.
WAR DEPARTMENT EXPENSES.
In the expenses of the war department the sec
retary reports a decrease of more than S9,000.000,
of which a reduction of §5,600,000 was effocted
in the expenditures for rivers and harbors and
$2,700,000 in the expenditures for the quarter
master's department Outsideofthatdepartment
the annual expenses of all the army bureaus
proper, except possibly tho ordnance bureau, are
substantially fixed, changes in which cannot be
materially diminished without a change in the
numerical strength of the army. Tho expendi
tures in the quartermaster's department can
readily be subjected to administrative discretion,
and it is reported by the secretary of war that as
a result of exercising such discretion in reducing
the number of draught and pack animals in the
army tho annual cost of supplying and caring
for such animals could bo reduccd. The annual
cost for this is now $1,108,085.90, less than it was
in 1882.
The reports of tne military commanders show
that the last year "una been notable for its entire
FREEDOM FROM INDIAN OUTBREAKS.
In defiance of the president's proclamation of
Joly 1, 1884, certain intruders sought to make
settlements in Indian territory. They were
promptly removed by a detachment of troops.
During the past Bession of congress a bill to
provide a
SUITABLE HKE-PROOF BUILDING
for the army medical mupeum and tho library of
the surgeon-general's office, recoived the approval
of the senate. A similar bill, reported favorably
to the house of representatives by one of its com
mittees. is still pending before that body. It is
hoped tnat during the coming session the meas
ure may become a law, and thereafter immediate
steps be taken to secure a place of safe deposit
for these valuable collections, now in a state of
insecurity.
The funds with which the work for tho
IMPROVEMENT OF RIVEUS AND HARBORS
were prosecuted during the past year were derived
from the appropriations of the act of August 2,
1882. together with such few balances as wero on
hand from previous appropriations. Tho balance
in the treasury subject to requisition July, 1KS3,
was $10,021,619.55. The amount appropriated
during the fiscal year 1SSI was $13,196,346,27, and
tho amount drawn from tho treasury during the
fiscal year was $8,228,703.54, leaving a balance of
$3,112,580.63 in the treasury, subject to requisi
tion July 1,1884.
The secretary of war submits the report of the
chief of engineers as to the practicability of
PROTECTING OUR IMPORTANT CITIES
on the seaboard by fortifications and other de
fenses able to repel modcim methods of attack.
The time has now come when such defenses can
be prepared with confidence that they will not

THE FINANCES.
A GENERALLY SATISFACTORY CONDITION.
The condition of our finances and the 9pera
tion of the various branches of the public ser
vice which are connected with tho treasury de
partment are very fully discussed in the report
of the secretary of the treasnry. It appears that
the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended
June 20,1881, were:
From customs (195,067,489.76
From internal revenue 121.588.072.58
From all other sources 81,866,307.65
rove abortive, and when the possible result of
in making such preparation is seriously
considered, delay seems inexcusable. For the
most important cities, those whose destruction
or capture would be a national humiliation, ade
quate defenses, inclusive of guns, may be
made by the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000, a
sum much less than victorious enemy could
levy as a contribution. An appropriation of
about one-tenth of this amount is asked to begin
the work, and I concur with the secretary of war
in urging that it be granted.
MANUFACTURE OF ORDNANCE.
The war department is proceeding with the
conversion of 10-inch smooth bore rifles into fj
inch rifles, by lining tlio former with tubes of
coiled wrought iron. Fifty gnns will
be thus converted within the year. This,
however, does not abate the necessity of provid
ing means for the construction of guns of the
highest power, both for the purpose of coast de
fense and for tho armament of war vessles.
Tho report of the gun
foundry board, appointed
April 2,1883, in pursuance of tho act of Alarch 3.
1883, was transmitted to congress in my annual
message of Febranry 8, 1884. In my message of
March 26,1884.1
called attention to
the recommen
dation of the board that the government should
encourage tho production of private steel works
of the required material for heavy cannon, and
that two government factories, one for the army
and one for the navy, should be established for
the fabrication of guns from such material. No
action having been taken, the board was subse
quently reconvened to determine more fully
tne plans and estimates necessary
for carrying out
its recommendations. It has received information
which indicates that there are responsible steel
manufacturers in this country who, although not
provided with the necessary plants, are willing
to construct the sam* and to make bids for con
tracts with the government for the supply ot tho

same
Total ordinary revenues $348,519,569
The public expenditures daring the eai
period were:
For civil expenditures $23,312,907.71
For foreign intercourse. 1,260,786.87
For Indians 6^75,999.24
For pensions 55,429,228.88
For military establishment inclnd-
requisite material for the heaviest guns adapted
to modern warfare, if a guarantee order of suf-
shall be made by oongress. All doubts as to the
feasibility of the plan being thus removed, I re
new my recommendation that such action be
taken by congress as will enable the government
to construct its own ordnance upon its own ter
ritory, and so provide the armaments demanded
by considerations of national safety and honor.
THE NAVY.
The report of the secretaiy of the navy ex
hibits the progress which has been made on the
new steel cruisers authorized by the acts of
August 5,1882, and March 3, 1883. Of the four
vessels under contract, one, the Chicago, of 4,509
tons, is more than half finished. The Atlantt
'annched. an
Boston, also
3,000 ton8t has b?en successfully launched, ant
her machinery is now fitting. Tho Boston, nlsK.
3,000 tons, is ready for launching, and the
Dolphin, a dispatch steamer of 1.500 tens, is
ready for delivery. Certain adverse criticisms
upon tho designs of these cruisers are discussed
by the secretary, who insists that the correct
ness of the conclusions reached by tho advisory
board and by the department, have been demon
strated by recent developments in ship bnilding
abroad. The machinery of the double-turreted
monitors, Puritan, Terror and Amphitlirite,
contracted for under tho act of March
3. 1883, is in process of construc
tion. No work has been done
during the past year on their armor for lack of
tho necessary appropriations. A fourth monitor,
the Monodnock. still remains unfinished at the
navy yard in California. It is recommended that
early 6teps be taken to complete these vessels
and to provide also an armament for the monitor
Miontonomah. The recommendations of the
naval advisnry board, approved by tho depart
ment, comprise the construction of one steel
crniber of 4.500 tons, ono cruiser of 3,0U0 ton
two heavily-armed gunboats, one light cruising
gunboat, one dispatch vessel armed with llotch
kits cannon, one armored ram and three torpedo
boats. The general designs, all of which are cal
culated to meet the existing wants of the service,
are now well advanced, and the construction of
tho vessels can be undertaken as soon as you
6liall grant the necessary authority.
ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS.
The act of congress approved August 7,1R52,
anthorizc-d the removal to the United States of
the bodies of Lieutenant-Commander Geo. W.
DeLong and his companions of the Jeannette ex
pedition. This removal has been successfully
accomplished by Lieuts. Harber and Scheutze.
The remains were taken from their graves in tho
Lena delta in March, 1883, and wero retained at
Yakutsk until the following winter, the season
being too far advanced to admit of their imme^
diate transportation. They arrived at New Yorkl
February 20,1884, where they wero received with
suitable honors.
In pursuance of tho joint resolution of con-,
gress, approved February 13, 1884, a naval expe4
dition was fitted out for the relief of Lieut. WJ
Greely, of the United States army, and of tha
party who had been engaged under his command
in scientific observations at Lady Franklin bay.
The fleet consisted of the steam sealer Thetis,
purchased in England the Bear. pur
chased at St. Johns, N. F., and tho
Alert, which was generously provided by tho
British government. The preparations for the
expedition were promptly mado by the secretary
of the navy, with the active co-operation of tho
secretary of war. Commander Geo. W. Coffin
was placed in command of the Alert and Lieut.
W. H. Emory in command of the Bear. Tha
Thetis was entrusted to Commander Winfield 8.
Copely, to whom also was assigned the superin
tendency of the entire expedition. Immediately
upon its arrival at Upemavik. the fleet began tho
dangerous navigation of Melville bay and, in
spte of every obstacle, reached Littleton Island
on June 22, a fortnight earlier than any vessel
had before attained that point. On the same day
it crossed over to Cape Sabine, where Lieut.
Greely and the other survivors of his party were
discovered. After taking on board the livij
and the bodies of the dead, the relief ships
for St. Johns, where they arrived on July 17.
They were appropriately received at
Portsmouth, N. H., on August 1, and
XX),OQ)
silver dollars. The number now outstanding is
reported by the secretary to be nearly 185,000,1100,
whereof but littlo more than 40,000,000, or less
than 22 per cent., are in actual circulation. The
mere existence of this fact eoems to me to fur
nish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal
of the statute, which has made such failure pos
sible, but there are other and graver considera
tions that tend in the same direction. The sec
retary avows his conviction that unless this
coinage and tho issuance of silver certificates be
suspended, silver is likely at no distant day to
become our 6ole metalic standard. The com
mercial disturbance and the impairment of the
national credit that would be thus occasioned
can scarcely be over-estimated. I hope that the
secretary's suggestions respecting the withdrawal
from circulation of the one dollar and two dollar
notes will receive your approval. It is likely
that a considerable portion of the silver now
encumbering the vaults of tho treasury might
thus find its way into the currency. While
New York on August 8. One ol
the bodies was landed at the former place. The
others were put on shorn at Governor's Island,
and. with tho exception of one. which was in
terred in the National cemetery, were forwarded
thence to the destination indicated by friends.
The organization and conduct of this relief ex
pedition reflects great credit upon all who con
tributed to its success.
In this, the last of the stated messages that I
shall have the honor to transmit to the congress of
the United States, I cannot too strongly urge on
its attention
TOE DUTT OF RESTORING OUR NAVY
as rapidly as possible to the high state of effici
ency which formerly characterized it. As tha
long peace that has lulled ns into a sense oi
fancied security may at any time be disturbed,
it is plain that the policy of strengthening this
arm of the service is dictated by considerations
of wise economy, of just regard for our futura
tran(juility. and of true appreciation of the
dignity and honor of tho republic.
POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
CONDITION AND NEEDS OF THE SERVICE. I
The report of the postmaster-general acquaints
you with the present condition and needs of th«
postal service. It discloses the gratifying fact
that the loss of revenue from a reduction of the
rate in letter postage as recommended in my
message of December, 1882, and effected by the
act of March 3, 1883, has been much less than
was generally anticipated. My recommendation
of this redaction was based upon the belief that
the actual falling off in the receipts from letter
postage for the year immediately succeeding the
change of rate would be $3,000,000. It has proved
to be only $2,275,000. This is a trustworthy indi
cation that tho revenue will soon be restored to
its former volume by the natural increase ot
sealed correspondence. I confidently repeat
therefore, the recommeudation of my last annual
message that.
SINGLE RATE POSTAGE
upon drop letters be reduced to 1 cent, wherever
layment of 2 cents fa now required by law. The
_ouble rate is only exacting at offices where the
carrier system is in operation, and it appears that
at these offices the increase in the tax upon local
letters defrays the cost, not only of its own col
lection and delivery, but of the collection and de
livery of all other mail matter. This is an in
equality that ought no longer to exist. I approve
the recommendations of the postmaster-goneral
that the unit of weight in the rating of first-class
matter should be one ounce instead of one-half
ounce, as it now is. In view of the statistics
furnished by the department it may well ba
doubted whether tho change would result in any
loss of revenue. That it would greatly promote
the convenience of the public is Deyond dispute.
TOE FREE DELIVERY SYSTEM
lias been lately applied to five cities, and the
total number of offices in which it is now in
operation is 159. Experience shows that ita adop
tion, under proper conditions, is equally an ac
commodation to the public, and an advantage to
the postal service. It is more than self-sustain
ing nnd for the reasons urged by the postmaster
general may properly be extended. It is tho
opinion of that officer that it is proper to provide
means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing
with letters in free delivery offices may be securi
by the paymeDt of extraordinary postage. Thi-j
scheme might be made effective uy the employ
ment of a special stamp, whose cost should bo
commensurate with tho expense of the extra
service. In some of the large cities privato ex
press companies have undertaken to oatfitrip the
government mail-carriers by affording for the
prompt transmission of letters better facilities
than have hitherto been at the command of the
postoffice. It has always been tho policy of the
government to discourage such enterprises, and
in no better way can that policy be maintained
than in supplying the public with the most
efficient mail service that, with due regard to its
own best interests, cau bo furnished for its ac
commodations.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
THE INDIAN PROBLEM.
Of the various governmental concerns in
charge of the interior department the reports of
its secretary presents an interesting summary,
Among tho topics deserving of particular atten
tion I refer you to his observations respecting
our Indian affairs tho pre-emption and timber
culture acts the failure of railroad companies to
take title to lands granted by the government,
and tho operations of the pension office, the pat
ent offico, the census bureau and the bureau of
education. Allusion has been made already to
the circumstances that both as between different
tribes and as between the Indians and the whites,
the past year has been one of unbroken peace.
In this circumstance the president is glad to
find justification for the policy of the govern
ment in dealing with tho Indian question, and
confirmation of the views which were fully
expressed in his first communication to the
Forty-seventh congress. Tho secretary urges I
anew the enactment of a statute for the punish
ment of crimes committed on Indian reserva
tions. and recommends tho passage of the bill now
ponding in the house of representatives for the
purchase of a tract of 180,00(1 square miles from
the Sioux reservation. Both of these measures
are worthy of approval.
TIIE LAND LAWS.
I concur with him also in advising the repeal
of tho pre-emption law, the enactment of stat
utes regarding the present le^al complications
touching lapsed grants to railroad companies
and the funding of the debt of the several Pa
cific/ railroads under such guaranty as shall
effectually insure its ultimate payment.
POLYGAMT.
The report of the Utah commission will be
read with interest. It discloses the results of re
cent legislation looking to the prevention and
punishment of polygamy in that territory. I
still bolieve that if that abominable practicc can
be suppressed by law it can only be by the most
radical legislation consistent with tho restraints
of the constitution. I again recommend, there
fore that congress assume absolute political con
trol of the territory of Utah and provide the ap
pointment of a commission with such govern
mental power as in their judgment may justly
and wisely be put into their hands.
THE TARIFF.
MAIN CONDITIONS OF THE PROBLEM.
In tlio course of this communication reference
lias more than once baen madg to the
policy of this government as regards the
extension of our iforeign trade. It seemB
proper to dsclare the general princi
ples that should, in my opinion, nnderlie our
national efforts in this direction. The main con
ditions of tho problem may bo thus stated We
area people prominent in mechanical pursaits
and fertile in invention. Wo cover a vast extent
of territory, rich in agricultural productions and
in nearly all the raw materials nccessesary for
successful manufacture. We havo a system of
productive establishments more than sufficient to
supply our own demands. Tho wages of labor
are nowhere else so great. The scale of living
of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure
their personal comfort, and the development of
those higher morals and intellectual qualities
that go to tho making of good citizens. Our sys
tem of tax and tan iff legislation is yielding «i
revenue which is in excess of the present needs
of the government. These ore elements from
which it is sought to dovise a scheme by which
without unfavorably changing tho condition of
tho workingman, our merchant marine
shall be
raised from its enfeebled condition and new
markets provided for the solo beyond our bor
ders of the manifold fruits of our industrial en
terprises. The problem is complex, and can be
solved by no single measure of innovation or
reform. Tho countries of the American conti
nent and the adjacent islands are for the United
States the natural market of supply and de
mand. It is from that wo should obtain what
we do not produce, or do not produo in a suffi
ciency, and it is to them that the surplus pro
duction of onr fields and mill:), and our work
shops should flow, and under conditions that
will equalize or favor them in comparison with
foreign competition.
FOUR PATHS OF POLICr
seem to point to this end:
First, a series of reciprocal commercial
ieswith the countries of America, which
foster between ns and them an tuiham.
movement of trade. The conditions of these
treaties should be tho frooadmission of such mer
chandise as this countrv doe* not produce in re-
]7t_
ww3@gm WGg*
torn tor ths admission free, or under favored
hchemes of duties, of our products, tha benefit*
pf such exchange to apply on thee* goods carried
under the flag of the parties to the oontract. Tha
removal oa both
sides from vessels so privileged
Of all tonnage dues and national imports, so tnat
their vessels may ply unhindered between our
ports and those of the other centraoting parties,
though without infringing on the reserved home
coasting trade. The removal or redaction of
burdens on the_ exported products of those coun
tries coming within the benefits of the treaties
and the avoidance of the technical restriction!'
and penalties by which our intercourse with
those countries is at present hampered.
Secondly, The establishment of the consclir
service of the United States on a salaried footing,
permitting the relinquishment of consular fees,
not only as respects vessels under the national
flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty na
tions carrying goods entitled to tho benefits of
the treaties.
Thirdly, The enactment of measures to favor
the construction and maintenance of a steam'
carrying marine under the flag of the United
States.
Fourthly, The establishment of an nnifonn
currency basis for the countries of America, so
that the coined products of our mines may cir
culate on equal terms throughout the whole sys
tem of commonwealths. This would require a
monetary union of America whereby the
output of the bullion-producing countries
and the circulation of those which
yield neither gold nor silver, could be ad
justed in conformity with the population,
wealth and commercial needs of each. As many
of the countries furnish no bullion to the com
mon stock the surplus production of our mines
and miners might thus be utilized, and a step
taken toward the ceneral remonetization of sil
ver.
To the accomplishment of these ends, so far as
they can bo attained by separate treaties, the ne
gotiations already concluded, and now in prog
ress, have been directed, and the favor with
which this enlarged policy has thus for been re
ceived, warrants the belief that its operations
will ere long embrace all or nearly all the coun
tries of this hemisphere. It is by no means
desirable, however, that the policy tinder consid
eration should be applied to these countries
alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade
with Europe, Asia and Af ica should be sought
by reducing the tariff burdens on such of their
wares as neither we nor the other American
states are fitted to produce, and thus enabling
ourselves to obtain in return a better market for
our supplies of food, of raw materials and of
the manufactures in which we excel.
It seems to me that many of the embar
rassing elements in tho great national
CONFLICT BETWEEN PROTECTION AND FREE
TRADE
may thus be turned to good account that the
revenue may be reduced so as no longer to over
tax the people the protective duties may be re
tained without becoming burdensome that our
shipping interests may be judiciously encour
aged the currency fixed on a firm basis, and.
above all, such an unity of interests established
among the states of the American system as will
bo of great and of ever increasing advantage to
them all. All the treaties in the line of this policy
which nave been negotiated, or are in process of
negotiation, contain a provision deemed to be
equisite under the clause of the constitution
umiting to the houce of representatives the au
thority to originate bills for raising revenue.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
WORK OF THE COMMISSION.
On the 29th of February last I transmitted to
the congress the first nnnml report of the civil
service commission, together with communica
tions from the heads of several executive depart
ments of the government respecting the practical
irorking of the law under which .the commission
had been acting. The good results therein
torshadowed have been more than realized. The
•ystem has fully answered the anticipations of
its friends in securing competent and faithful
public servants, and in protecting the appoint
ing of officers of the government from the
pressure of personal importunity, and from the
labor of examining the claims and pretensions
rival candidates for public employment. The
law has had the unqualified support of the presi
dent and of the heads of the several departments,
ind tho members of the commission haveper
formed their duties with zeal and fidelity. Tneir
report will shortly be submitted, and will be ac
companied by such recommendations for enlarg
the scope of the existing statute as shall {com
mend themselves to the executive and the com
missioners charged with its administration.
MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS.
A BANKRUPT LAW.
In view of the general and persistent demand
throughout the commercial community for a
national bankrupt law, I hope that the differ
ences of sentiment which have hitherto pre
vented its enactment may not outlast the present
session.
THE CHOLERA PLAQUE.
The pestilence which for the past two years
has been raging in the countries of the east
recently made its appearance in European porta
with which we are in constant communication.
The secretary of the treasury, in pursuance of a
proclamation of the president, issued certain
regulations restricting, and for a time prohibit
ing the importation of rags and the admission
of the baggage of immigrants and of travelers
arriving from infected quarters. Lest this courso
may have been without strict warrant of law. 1
approve the recommendation of the present sec
retary that the congress take action in the
premises, and I also recommend the immediate
adoption of such measures as will bo likely to
ward off the dreaded epidemic, and to mitigate
its severity in case it shall unhappily extend to
our shores.
FEES OF WITNESSES AND JURORS.
The attorney-general renews the recommenda

the fees of witnesses and jurors. He favors a
radical change in the fee, but the adoption of a

I recommend that in recognition of the emi
nent services of Ulyses Grant, late general of the

VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS.
Of the measures that seem to me necessary and
expedient I have now, in obey

CONCLUSION.
As the time draws nigh when I am to retire
from the public service. I cannot refrain from
expressing to the members of the national legis
latures with whom I have been in personal and
official intercourse, my sincere appreciation of
their unfailing courtesy, and of their liarmonions
co-operation with the executive in 6o many
measures calculated to promote the best interests
of the nation, and to my fellow citizens generally
I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the
support which thoy nave accorded me in my ad
ministration of the executive department of the
government.

THE GDRKENCY.
Report of the Comptroller of the Cur
rency on the National Bank
ing System.
The Iteiundinff of Bonds, the Issues
of Rotes, and the Coin
Standard.
The Comptroller's Views as to the Bela
tioa of Silver and Gold—The
Fortner's Yaluei
The rnnual report Of tbe Comptroller of the
Currency shows during the year end'.'d Nov. 1,
1881, l'.'l banks have been organized, with an
aggregate capital of $16,012,£S0. Circulating
notes have bsen issued to these new associations
amounting to ti.MjU.230. These bauk- are lo
cated by gcographcal divisions as follows:
Eastern Stbt 10 banks, with a capital of (B10.
000 Middle States 25, ca, ital fsr.,'26'i Southern
Stat :«, capital $2,991,100: Western States 102,
capital 1^,905,8^1 Pacific States 6. capital *3»V
000: Territories 19, capital $1,1*:',ooo. Since tbe
establishment of the national banking system,
Feb. 25, lHtM, there have been organized 3,261
naticnal bank?. The total number in existence
Nov. 1, 1-81, was 2,671—the largest number In
operation at any one time. Eleven national
banks, «1th an aggregate capital of $1,2S.',UOO,
have failed and lcen placed in the hands cf re
ceivers during th-' year.
Tbediffercnt items cf re-ourcesand liabilities,
as tabulated, indicate that the business of the
national banks durlnv the l»st eleven years has
gpnerailv Increased. The items of United States
l.onds and circulation thereon decrease 1 during
the last two years. The aggregate liabilities of
liat onal banks to depositors and correspond
ents were reduccd dur.nir the year upward
M.OOO.OOO. This reduction of liabilities and the
general reduction of loans by backs, which
amounted to over t«J,oto,ooo during the year,
the Comptroller says was doubtless occasioned
by tho financial troubles of May and general de
pression of business. During the same period
nat'onal tanks increased their cash resources
by about t2l.fx»o,'(0 spei ie and tII,1'JOO.OOO legal
tenders and United States certllicates of deposit
for the same.
The to'al number of banks still in operation,
organized under the act of June 1861, and
the provisions of the Revised Statute*, In pe
riods of snccession, which will terminate un
less hereafter renewed during the years previ
ous to 1000, is 1.1I-8. with a capital of $ S71,1(3], 113
and a circulate of $191,745,:,0.'.
The banks held Nov. j, 1881, $105,601,100 3 per
ccnt. bonds, payable at the pleasure of the Gov
ernment, of which 0 have been called
for payment, interest ceasing Nov. 1, 1H3I.
If these bonds are not replaced by others bear
ing interest, there will be an Immediate reduc
tion in circulation of 90 per cnt. of their
amount. Nov. 1 there were I1Q1,1'.KI,500 3 per
cent, bonds payable at the pleasure of the Gov
ernment. These bonds wdl probably be
paid within the next two voars. even if con
siderable chances are made in tbe tariff and
from 1»*7 to 1891, when $.60,000,000 of 4Si per
cents mature, there will be no bonds which the
Government can call in for redemption. No
doubt the accumulation of turplus revenue, if
it continues to accrue at tbe present rate during
the four years between 1887 and 1891, together
with he r. vennes of 1892, will be more than
sufficient to pay off the 1^ per cents, and from
1*92 until 19II7 it will be impossible for the Gov
ernment to u*e any of its su plus revenues for
tbe ay men of its bo.ids, except at the option
of their holders. It is apparent that the Gov
ernment cannot accumulate and hold Its t-nr
plus revenues, even during the short period
from 1887 to JH92, withou" reat distuibances to
the busines intei ests of the country, and mucb
less can It do so during .he loneer period from
1892 to 1907.
It appears, therefore, that the forexoing con
siderations should be given due weight in any
plan for funding the 1 per cent, ben 's maturing
in 1907, and the Controller therefore suggests
that the principal dlthcultles of the situation
may. perhaps, b3 obviated as well as a reduc
tion of interest effected by fundfng these bonds
into others which shall matu.e iu proportionate
amounts at certain fixed Interna s. Thus the
$708,000,0001 per oente might be funded into an
equal amount of 3 or 2*4 er ccnt. bonds, one
fifth of which, or $it7,r.oo,'ioo, to mature at in
tervals of five years, the first installment due
July 1, 1897, and the remaining installments of
$u'.roo,000 each of the 1st of July in the last
year each succeeding period of five years, viz.:
1902. 1907, 1912, and 1917. The average ma
turity of these five classes of bonds would be
the same as that of the present per cents—viz.:
July 1, 1907.
Whatever course may be deemed expedient by
Congress In regard to the funding or future
payment of the public debt, the Controller Is of
opinion that it Is penectly safe and will afford
great benefit to the public to permit an Issue
by the national banks of circulation to the ex
tent of looper cent—par value—of bonds de
posited. Instead of per cent. Even admit
ting that bonds representing the public debt
when funded at lower rates miuht at times In
the future be below par in the market, the Gov
ernment would, if forced to redeem the notes of
insolvent national banks, always have
a right to
cancel bonds on deposit securing the same, and
thus extinraish an amonnt of Its debt equal,
dollar for ?ullar, to the notes redeemed. It is
further rubmitted that the profit on circulation
may be increased to a point which will induoe
banks to keep np their circulation to the maxi
mum, and stop contraction of their circulation,
which is now occurring, by repelainz the law
tixing such circulation at the rate of one-half of
1 per cent., seml-annnally. The expenses ol
keeping up the national banking system by the
Government are at present paid In part from the
proceeds ot th'S tax and in part by assessment
on banks. If this tax be abolished all these ex
penses should bo paid by the last named
method.
In concluding this subject the Comptroller
wishes to have it distinctly understood that he
Is not In favor of any measure which will cause
inflation. He is of opinion that the present ag
gregate paper circulation, made up of legal
tender and national-bank notes and gold and
silver certificates, 1« ample for all the need* of
business. He believes, however, that a sudden
contraction of national-bank circulation, which
without appropriate legislation is imminent, will
seriously embarrass the business of the country,
and that if this contraction is permitted to go
on it may result in the entire discontinuance of
tbe issue of notes by national tanks. Tbe
Comptroller believes that this form of currency,
which can be increased or diminished in accord
ance with natuial laws which control business,
should be continued in preference to any other
now permitted by law.
In regard to the circulation based on silver,
the Controller savs the people of the United
States now hold paper circulation based upon
silver dollars in amount equal to more then one
third the national-bank circulation. If it is
for the best interests of the United 6tates
to issue circulation based upon silver, the Con
troller believes circulation should be issued
upon coin or bullion which contains a sufficient
number of grains of silver to have intrinsic val
ue equal in tbe markets of the world to its nom
inal value. Some writers have suggested that
the circulating medium might be based upon
bullion, both gold and silver, and the Controller
is of opinion that nnder certain restrictions and
regulations it would be far more correct In prin
ciple to issue silver certificates based upon
tbe deposit of bullion, to be valued in exaot
proportion of silver to gold, than to continue
the issue of certificates under the present law.
If this were done, silver bars mivht be stamped
at their market value and held in the Tre sury
for the redemption of certificates whic would
call an amount of silver equal in va'ne to their
nominal or face valne expressed in gold. The
bullion represented by certificates should bo
periodically valued at its market price in gold,
and a certain proportionate amoun of silver so
held might perhaps be coined to provide means
for the redemption of certificates, if redemption
was required for business purposes. The Con
troller believes that tbe use ot sllv as money in
this manner, and its periodical valuation would
have more influence in appreciating the market
value of silver among the nations of the world
than the present arbitrary co nage or
grains of silver as a dollar. The issue of cur
rency based upon silver should not, however, be
un'lmited, and the present laws making the
purchase and coinage of a fixed amount of silver
bnlllon mandatory are very pernlt ions In their
effect, as tbe unlimited and continu issuance
of full legal-tender silver coin, and certificates
eed thereon, of intrinsic valu» less than their
face, has already caused the hoarding of gold,
and will eventually drive it from the channels of
tride, Hereby tatulng a practical suspension of
gold payments. There are many indications
of this, notably the unrasiness in financial cir
cles in June and July last,
caused by the rrserve
of gold in the Treasury fall ng so near to a
point at which under the law the issuance of
gold oe ticates oeases. It will also be observed
that during the present year national banks
throughout th* ountry have increased their
holdings of gold, luc udin tert'ficates, in the
sum of $19,616, 5". The Comr trol'er concludes
his report with a discrasion of the subject ot
bank examination* an 1 consideration of the
financial troubles of May, 1881.
LIFE-SAYING SERVICE.
Annnal Report of the Hnperintendent.
The General Superintendent of tbe Life-Bar
ing Berrice, In his annnal report, aaye Total
number of disasters during tbe year, 439 total
value of property' involved, $10,60T,940 total
valne of property saved, $9,161,SM total
value of property lost, $1,4(6.586 total
number of oereone involved, 4.432 to
tal number of persons saved, 4,412 total
number of persons lost, 20 total number of per
sons sncoored at stations, SS2 total nnmber of
days'snocor afforded, 1,319 number of vessels
totally lost, 64. Investigation's held after each
case of loss of life show that twenty persons
who perished were severally beyond human aid,
and that In no instance could their loss be at
tributed to any failure in duty on the part of
the life-saving crews. The number of disasters
during the year exceed by twenty-thre.: the
number the year proceeding, which was seventy
one more than any previous year in the history
of the service. The amonnt of property involved
was $3,365,220 greater than in preceding year,
but the amount lost was 1124,434 less, while
the amount saved was $3,489,664 more.
The assistance rendered daring tne year in
the saving of vessels and cargoes has been
much larger than in any previous year. Three
hundred and ninety vessels, which Is tilty-three
more than in preceding year, having been work
ed off when stranded, repaired when damaged,
piloted ont of dangerous plaoes, and similarly
assisted by die station crew. There were be
sides 240 instances. 116 more than in preceding
year, where vessels running into danger of
stranding were warned off by the night signals
of the patrol B,most of them thus bei prob
ably eaved from parti 1 or total destruction.
The following general summary is given of
the statistics ot the service from date of the
introduction of the present system in 1871 to
the close of the fiscal year. Tbe loss of life, as
stated below, includes 188 lost at the wrecks of
the Hnron and Metropolis, which report says in
strict justice are not chargeable to the service.
Number of disasters, 2,647 valne of property
involved, $47,123,314 valne of property saved,
$32,898,346 value of property lost, $74.
230,968 number of persons involved,
23,217 number ot persons saved,- 22,
771 nnmber of perrons lost, 446 num
ber of perrons succored at stations,
4,261 nnmber ot days of euooor afforded, u,62t.
Deducting the number of persons who perished
st the wrecks of tbe Hnron and Metropolis from
the figures given above, the lives lost wonld
leave the remarkable exhibit of only 263 in thlr
tocn years made.
In conclusion, Superintendent Kimball says
"The splendid efflciencry of tbe corps is attribut
able mainly to its being made np entirely en
the grounds of professional qualification, the
policy ef keeping tbe service entirely exempt
from political influences having been steadily
continued."
