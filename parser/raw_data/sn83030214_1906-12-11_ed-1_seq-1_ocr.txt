That anything was ever written to the Presi
dent by my «Ift t» the effect "that Mr. Ch«aie
az:& <>neral Porter were not proper persons to
be ambassadors"' is news to both of us. For both
tiese d:siineui?he<l men we have, and have had.
nothing but respect and gro.»d will, personally
tz£ officially. It would have Ix^n an honor to
gay one to take any post ever filled by either of
tijesi after they ceased to occupy It. And the
cnlr feefla* possible is one of regret that both
of ihTn have been lost to the public service since
Jir. " Roosevelt was reflected.
A* to ilr. Root, the press in 1'>»1 was full of
tUtwn** I**1 ** that he might not l>e able to remain

be succeeded by General Porter, which wi»ul\l
leave Paris vacant.
I give in full a letter from the President in an

I do this both because it is a letter for him to be
proud of from its full appreciation of eminent

Jlv dear Maria: You w^d never be afraid of writ^
jsf'ne or of asking anything. If it is In my
sower to grant it I shall <lo po. If for any reasons.
irttetiie: political in the narrow or In the largest
aanrt I ranntw, I shall t*"Il you so frankly. I'er
tosal reasons can never exist when I do not do
yftytfcfag >ou Pay. Bellamy was ripht about it be
yg r.eecl^ss to write me in order to keep him In
aged I think cf both of you all th» time, and
tire pone ever several times possible plans. First,
v to Lhe <- ab:ner_ It is very unlikely j.ow that 1
jiall rhar.?« any member of the present Cabinet,
you haw probably eeen that I hay« asked them
i 3 to Ft ay. Tn» secretary of War, Root, is one
cf thp vry strongest men before the people In our
whole partr- His Canton speech was the most
effective delivered in the campaign last year. His
advice is Invaluable, r.ot merely in, reference to his
acpartsießt. but in reference tt» ajl branches of the
iemee. As lor his department, it is at the present
laa* raofit iir.porrar.t in the entire government. It
vcsM be a public calamity to have him leave the
Ctbrr.Pt t.ovf and I use the words public calamity
•firisedly. Re is a sick man. a condition that gives
jb» p«a.t Tineasir.eF". not because there is the fear
cf fc:s death, but lest he may have to give up his
rork here. If be went our I should have to con
sider nothing whatever but the question of getting
tat besi man the entire country afforded to do the
work necessary to be done. It may be that, after
artful !y lookinjr over the niarter. I should con
dase that B'llamy was the man for the purpose.
It nay b* that I should hsve to conclude that
■rase or.* els*, of whem I have no tbooght at pres
et, would be the best man, and if so I should be
la hor.or bound to take him, and not to consult
•ay personal preference of. mine In a matter so
tttal to the country.
I &o not b»lieve that Secretary Long intends to
kav« the r.ayy. In this deyaxirfv-'nt lam sure, with
« 3 further Lhcyrht. that Bellamy would be admir
tiue: but in Sliirff tr;y vacancy in the Cabinet I
mo'Sii have to tail* note of all kin of -tiers. -
tloas. I should count Bellamy's relipion in his
livor for a _ r.-: pla> c. Other things being
JQBH, I should like to have a Catholic In the
Cii^et. I in E'jre that in the Navy Department
st vosld to exceedingly well f-s Secretarj*. I do
tct kai-iw whether geographically he would be th<»
rjfht man. For insuuice, I should like much to
S*t a Pacific Ptope man into the Cabinet, and par
ticularly in tha >?avy Department, and I do not
*Uh to leave New England unrepresented. At
prwent, I pee no Pacific Slope man who would be
competent t^> 2il the position. Moreover, if possible,
I fhould like to get one or more members if the
Cabtact »ho are in close touch with the people,
orrr.rjr «reifbt when they explain the policies,
pETpotea p.r.d acts cf xny aaminisrraiion.
Ttis \e the one point In which t'.ie present CaM
«t is not as Ftror.g- as it should be. I do not be
li«re that a finer, abler, more hig-h minded body
tf?ubl:c servants was ever cot tog-ether around a
President; but there is no one of thr-m, with the
J»s;Ue exception of Root <who is so busy that ♦.»
ens harily ever sp*-ak>. who can appear before the
country with tbe prestige of a great political leader
to €splair. and champion my administration. If
I eou'd el any Time fill this want I should most
KMEtly desire to do &o. In other words, for a
Cibinet place, the man should, 't possible, be not
•*!t eosbiently fit for the administration of his
cepartnier.t, but also, if possible, a party leader of
•eight, and furthermore it 13 rarely that one can
tda. Cahinet position with reference only to Itself
-aJ aiinuwffflt^ oonditions must be taken into ac
fouiit. Now, aftf-r foreign affairs, my inquiries
«pee<3i:y develop th» fact that a Cataolle Just at
STfser.t irould not 1* a man whom it would be wise
to s*n<J t. Germany. For wholly different reasons it
*"oiad hf wise to Ff-nA him t<> Italy. I had not

REVOLT IX VEXE7XELA.
Capital of Lara Reported Captured
Humors of an Action.
Fort de France. Martinique. Doc. 10.— The
French Lin© steamer Xormandie, which touched
at La Guayra, Venezuela, en December 8. ar
rived here to-day and reported that in view of
the apparently approaching: death of President
Castro revolutionary appeals were being circu
lated at La Guayra and Caracas.
In the best Informed circles In Venezuela It Is
believed that grave happenings are likely to
occur shortly. Government troops left Caracas
on December 6 for the western part of the re
public, where a serious revolutionary movement
has begun.
The- Venezuelan Insurgents commanded by
General Mantilla have captured Barqueslmeto.
GENERAL ANTONIO f£rEDES.
"Who will lead uprising against President Castro.
capital of the State of L^ra. a hundred and
sixty miles from Caracas.
It was rumored at La Guayra when the Nor
rr.andie left ther« that General Parades, a for
mer revolutionary leader, landed recently at
Coro, capital of the state of Falcon. Venezuela.
and defeated the government troops In an en
gagement there.
PAREDES GETS ARMS.
Has 15,000 Rifles • and 8,000,000
Rounds of Ammunition.
The statement of General Antonio Paredes. of
Venezuela, contained in a cable dispatch from Mar
tinique, yesterday, that he had at his disposition
fifteen thousand rifles for an insurrection against
President Castro, was fully confirmed in this city
yesterday. It was further learned that a part of
these arms was obtained m New York by General
Parades on his recent visit here, and that already
five thousand rifles and three million cartridges
had been clandestinely landed In Venezuela.
The revolutionists have an official representative
In this city, who la attending to the financial and
executive departments of the undertaking. He is
anxious that he should not appear in the game
until it had been fairly launched, which he be
lieves will be soon after January 1. He said yes
terday:
awJtf^f^orabfe^S: rronev and « **
awi-.t'r.g a favorable time. • and *"* ÜBt
General Paredes came to this city from Trinidad
last summer, and announced then his Intention of
organtsiag an armed movement against President
Cr-stro. He worked quietly, and from what his
representative said yesterday, it appears that his
efforts were not without effect . General Pared«. a
not only succeeded in obtaining here and through
friends in Europe funds sufficient to put his revolt
afoot, but eot promises for more if it was re
quired. The general sailed for Trinidad on Octo
ber 13. announcing that he would return to New
York as soon as he had completed some re - m ii
ir.ary details.
Now. it develops that his promise to return here
was only a ruse to foil the agents of the Venez
uelan government, who were closely vatehing his
every movement. When he left here his local
. spokesman said he was fully prepared ;o take the
field. In fart, since returning to the West Indies
General Paredes has been thrice on the point of In
vading Venezuela, but has been held ba<",c for po
litical reasons.
General Paredes. who himself has n reputation
for valor and military ability, has the support of
several able Venezuelan leaders, who also are ex
iled In Trinidad and Curacoa. His greatest mili
tary glory was attained in his fi>ht in 1?93 against
Prep-dT.t «'astro during the latter' ■ revolution
against President Andrade.
The official representative of General Pa rede? in
this city defined the latter's position yesterday a.*
follows:
We have been working on our plans for some
months, and they are now perfected. It is true, as
General Paredes suys in to-day's cable dispatch
from Martinique, that we hav^ obtained 15,000
Mauser rin>-s. Some of these were purchased in
Germany iin-1 some in this country. There have
already be.-n landed 5.00Q riles and 2.<W>\<W round*
of ammunition. The rf-maiivl<-r will be shipped as
soon as needed. Where we gut our funds ] am not
at liberty to say. but we have ample for our pur-
X>ose. General Parades, contrary to what most people
will believe, does n:>t aspin- to the Presidency of
Venezuela. In that respect r.is Insurrection is" dif
ferent from any that has ever tiken place in
Venezuela. lie is a patriot. He s«-^ks only the
■■■'-■•■ gov^rnm^nt in his
country— one created by the people and conducted
for their welfare and not for th» gain of a few
r.-olit)Hßn<*. who "Mirround President < 'astro. If lie

demand a fjiir election, which lias not b*>«?n h»<a in

EDUCATION BILL DEAD.
AMENDMENTS REJECTED.
New Measure To Be Introduced at
Next Session.
London. Dec. 10.— The government has decided
to reject all the House of Lords' amendments to
the Education bill. The Secretary of Education,
Augustine. Birrell. announced the fact in the
House of Commons this afternoon, giving as a
reason that the amendments were destructive
to the fabric and main principles of the measure.
Mr. Birrell expressed the hope that the upper
house might withdraw the amendments as a.
whole and substitute others more limited in
scope and operation, and Intimated that the gov
ernment was prepared to consider some conces
sions, but the present amendments in th»lr ex
isting state, or anything like it. were quite un
acceptable. He added that if the peers per
sisted in their original amendments the bill
would be sacrificed.
Mr. Birrell then announced that the Premier,
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, would to-mor
row move a resolution asking the house to re
ject the amendments as a whole, and in the mean
time he asked the house to proceed to discuss
them.
Herbert J <;:.ulston<>. Liberal, then moved
that the discussion of the amendments be ad
journed until to-morrow, and this was agreed to.
In the course of to-day's debate A. J. Balfour.
Conservative, said that the Rovernment evi
dently desired that the bill be lost, and said he
himself wanted it to perish rather than see lt
passed In the shape which the government de
sired. John Redmond, the Irish leader, inti
mated that the concessions foreshadowed by the
government would satisfy the Nationalists, but
Robert W. P^rks, Liberal, speaking on behalf of
th° Nonconformists, warned the government
that the Koncont iad reached the utmost
limit of their c<*
The unexpected decision of the Cabinet to re
ject the amendments came as a complete sur
prise to m,,st of the members of the House. It
Indicates that the Nonconformist influent
too strong for the government to withstand, and
seals the fate of the bill. Any compron
now regarded as hopeless. Tho bill certainly will
be dropped and a n^w biil will be introduced at
the next set Parliament. The decision of

was prepared to make, but they are too limited

MORETREASDBT RELIEF
SHAW RELEASES 920.n0*->, noo.
Will Deposit $10,000,000 in Banks
and But/ ■$10,000,000 Bonds.
[From Th« Tribune Bureau 1
Washington, Dec. 1«"> .— The Secretary of the
Treasury announced to-day that, with a view to
relieving the great stringency in the money mar
ket, he would immediately deposit $10,000,000
of the surplus now in the Treasury with govern
ment depositaries in the leading cities of the
East. South and Middle West, taking as security
therefor securities acceptable for savings bank
investments under the laws of New York and
Massachusetts at fJO per cent of their value, and
would also Immediately redeem $10,000,000 of
United States bonds of lf*)7. the registered at
101 and the coupon at 102.
Secretary Shaw is of the opinion that the pres
ent stringency is due only to the great prosperity
Of UM country, that it is incident to the present
crop moving: season nnd will be abated soon
after January 1.
Secretary Shaw had an interview to-day with
the bankers' committee, now in session in the
city, and later made the following announce
ment:
I have received In the last ten days an un
usually large number of letters from business
men representing all sections of the country,
complaining of the extraordinarily high rates of
interest. I hare conferred, during the same
period, by letter or personally, with a large
number of bankers scattered through the South
and Middle West, as well as in the East. I have
to-day conferred with the committee of the
American Bankers' Association now in session
in this city. These men represent Chicago. St.
Louis. Ne-*- Orleans. Atlanta, Plttsburg, Indian
apolis. Dcs Moines and other cities. From the
beta information I --in get I think the following
describes the situation fairly well:
Our blessings are tile real cause of the actual
stringency in money, recognized everywhere.
An unusually large crop and unexampled indus
trial activity have created an unprecedented de
mand for money. The world Is everywhere
prosperous, and money is in great demand
throughout Europe as well as in the United
States. We never had such a volume of credits,
and they are based on an unequalled volume of
assets. The manufacturers of cotton are buying
that staple by the trainload. The cotton planter,
unlike the Western farmer, demands actual cash
and he carries it home in his pocket. The West
ern farmer is paid in checks, which he deposits
In the bank to his credit, and therefore does not
absorb actual money, as does the cotton planter.
This money should be returned to the banks
when the planter settles with his merchant soon
after January 1, but between now and then the
cotton consuming. country, as well as the cotton
producing country, is short of money.
>.'• v. England has sent millions to the South,
and the manufacturers of cotton throughout the
South have exhausted the capacity of local
banks and are trying to borrow elsewhere. There
is no occasion for alarm, but I believe there is
occasion for relief. This I have decided to grant
in the following manner:
I will deposit $10,000,000 in existing deposi
taries in the cities designated below, to he se
cured by bonds acceptable for savings bank in
vestments under the laws of New York and
Massachusetts, taken at !>■> per cent of their
value; these deposits to be returned, one-half on
January 2«» and the remainder on February 1.
1 will also bay 510.000.Q00 of the bonds of 190"
at the following prices?: Registered bonds ex
interest, at 101. and coupon bonds, at 102. In
the event that the bonds purchased are now held
a^ security for government deposits, security of
the character above Indicated will be accepted
in lieu thereof. Not more than $I.oTN>.fslo worth.
however, will be purchased from any single in
stitution under these conditions.
The deposits will be made as follows: New
York and New Otleans, ?1 .500.000 each; Boston.
Philadelphia. Baltimore. Chicago and St. Louis.
$I.<;<M»,«HH'> each Cincinnati. Louisville. Atlanta
and Memphis, $500,090.

A mail wagon, containing seven hea\-y sacks of
mail, believed by the police and postoffice author
ities to contain several thousand dollars worth
of money orders, registered letters and loose
money and stamps, was stolen shortly after 10
o'clock last night from the rear of the postoffice
Sub-station M. at Broadway and GOth street.

collecting mail from the various sub-station*
for the outgoing mail from the Grand Central
Station, which leaves at 11:30 o'clock, and white
he was in Station M the wagon was stolen. Th»
police were unable to get any clew to the Identity
of the robbers.
A small boy told the driver that he thought
he saw two or three men drive away in the
wagon. Every detective in the precinct was pat
on the case. The reserves were also called out
and sent to scour the neighborhood. It seemed
as though the horse and wagon had been wiped
out of existence. The police believe the men
drove away a short distance, and then cov

no connection between this Incident and that o.
the stolen wagon, as in the former case nothing
had been stolen.

Traffic Tied Up in Rush Hour by
Sleet Storm. X
The steady downfall of drizzling rain an 6*9
yesterday and nearly all nfsht. following a
slight fall of snow that left the street and side
walks covered with an eighth of an inch Si flan
gerously slippery ice. almost blork"d traffic en
tirely on the surface ami elevated lines and so
consr p 3t«»d the subway lines that annoying de
lays t<> traffic were causer! in every part of tho
city. There were several blocks on both tho
underground and surface roads, a fire on tha
Se»-or.d avenue elerated line and; " **• steal con
ditions at th" Brooklyn Brt>ie*. In Brooklyn
or.* man was killM by falling: on the Ice.
The worst block of the day occurred to th«
I subway about 5:3»>. when a northbound Lenox
avenue express train Jumped, th» track In the
cut where the Lenox avenue trails swing: oat
of Broadway north of the O»".th street station.
The train settled acmsa the Lenox avenu«
tracks In such a way as to block both, north)
and south bound traffic. Although not a soul
■was reported Injured, intense excitement pre
vailed on the express tra!n. ami at the 9Cth
street station the homeward bound crowds got
bigger and bbots Impatient every moment. Tne>
passengers on the train that Jumped the track
made a mad rush for th* ticket of3ce> the mo
ment the guards threw open th<» doors to let
them out. and at once- demanded block tickets.
The crowds waiting for trains joined in the de
mand and soon ther« wer© at l»-ast fiften hun
dred men. women and childen demanding ex
change tickets for the elevated systems.
The agent refusal, and when th** excitement
was at Its height George Smith, a passenger on
the train that went off the track, and Lotits
Gutelman began to pummel each other. Th»
reserves from the l«X»th street station were
rushed to the scene, under Captain Burfemd.
The crowds persisted in demanding block tickets
and the agents, aetinsr under orders, refused.
Some at the officials of the road happened along
and Captain Burfeind had a talk with them
which resulted in block tickets being issued a3
fast as t'.vo men could do> the work.
RUSH FOR BLOCK TICKETS.
The wonder was that some one. was not hurt
In the rush from the train through the subway
to the ticket office. Several of the passengers
climbed out of windows and the others became
so persistent that the guards thought It was
beat to throw open the gates. The accident
caused a block at every station along the line.
and not a train moved north-ward until almost
7 o'clock. It occurred at the worst hour of th*
day, when hundreds of thousands were rush
ing from offices and factories.
The accident caused such an •sMVaMHsi rush
for local trains that the entire local system was
stalled for nearly an hour. The trains could
not move. In the mean whilo the Grand Central.
14th street and the Brooklyn Bridge stations
were jammed to the surface -with the homeward
going crowds. A detail cf police was sent to
all the big stations to prevent disorder. The»
wrecking crew, after more than hour's work. got
th? train on the tracks again. As usual, there
was no explanation of the accident.
Earlier In the day there was another b!ock in.
the subway at the time the same crowds caught
In the night rush were hurrying downtown.
This was caused by the blowing out of one o?
the larsre safety fuses protecting the third rail
on the downtown local track near Times Square.
The stations at ~>Oth street, Times Square. 4:M
street. Grand Central, and at 33d street were
plunged Into darkness. Every light on these
stations and in the trains on the downtown local
track was extinguished. Such excitement as
followed was only equalled by that later In rhi
day at o*Uh street and other stations along the
line.
The subway troubles began long before day
light and were due directly to th© storm. This
storm came so rapidly, according to General
Manager Hadley. that before the officials could
begin to have the s'eet brushed off trains on.
the elevated portions of the subway were almost
stalled, or moving so slowly -'..■»• a virtual
block.
On the "tt'est Farms division of the Lexington
avenue line, when the time came to start trains.
at 430 yesterday omrning; it was found imprac
ticable to move them over the Icy rails.
TROUBLE ON THE "L.-
On the elevated systems trouble began early.
On the Second avenue line trains stopped run
ning soon after midnight yesterday, and did not
start again until 4:30 o'clock. Shortly after that
hour a train between 164 and OSth streets got a
short circuit, and th© trestle -worts caught flrsv
The current was shut off and not tomad, on,
again until ".:SO o'clock. Even then it was dif
ficult for trains to move, and it required two
hours and sixteen minutes for the first train to
run from O^th street to the Battery.
At S o'clock traffic was stopped again when
the motor car on a northbound train took fire at
T^d street.
At '.• o'clock the blooknde had not been lifted.
and the officials of the Interborough system gave.
orders that some of the Second venue trains bo
switched to the Third avenue line. This was ac
complished at Chatham Square. At th© same
time thore were similar blocks on the Sixth and
Ninth avenue lines.
Conditions on the surfa.ee car llr.es were
equally bad. This was particularly true of tha
Madison and Third avenue lines. On these ave
nues nothir.ar like schedule time was kept by th*
cars, and in some instances they were ftfte*a
and twenty minutes apart. Then four ■ fiv»
cars enme a'ontr together.
Policemen along Fifth avenue w»re kept busy
assisting drivers in picking up their horses.
Th» r »? were about a dozen accidents in Man
hattan, mostly cases of men slipping on the icy
sidewalks. They were not of a serious nature.
In Brooklyn, however, one man was killed by
slippins on the ice. H<* was Joseph R«ddy. m
No. lir. Carlton rfrenue 1 . 'Whn* working ■ th«
rear of the onVers' quarters in the navy yard
he slipped on the Ice and broke a blood vessel.
He died before medical assistance reached him.
