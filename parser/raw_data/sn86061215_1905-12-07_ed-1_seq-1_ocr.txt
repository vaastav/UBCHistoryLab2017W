With President Roosevelt's Recom
mendatlons—Lacey Likes the Mes-
sage.
"Washington, D. C., Dec. 6.—
(Special).—Congressman Lacey in

a bureau of mines and mining in
the interior department, with a
chief at $5,000, the object of the
bureau. to be to make a study of
mining and investigate its various
phases with a view to improve
ment and to the prevention of ac
cidents.
Major Lacey is much pleased
with the President's message.
Asked what he thought of the
President's views on the tariff, he
said: "Delighted." and he looked
that way when he said it.
A prominent congressman speak
ing of the President's message this
afternoon said the views of the
,' President on the tariff have been
frequently and persistently mifi
represented and he was gratified
that the President had indicated
that he was thoroughly sound on
the tariff along the lines Lacey
and others have advocated for
years.
Washington, D. C., Dec! 6.—
(Special).—Senator Dolliver intro
duced a hill this afternoon to re
peal the bankruptcy law. The bill

'^Washington, D, C., Dec. 6.—•
The senate adopted without debate
ft resolution directing the commit
tee on judiciary affairs to inquire
into and report whether under the
constitution congress has author
ity to revise marine, flre and life
insurance.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 6.—The
senate today confirmed the nom
ination of Ellhu Root to be secre

Washington, D. C., Dec. 6. The
Esch-Townsend railroad rate bill,
which passed the house at its last
session, has been redrawn and was re
introduced in the house today by Rep
resentative Townsend. The bill em
braces all the features of the former
measure, but is drawn so as tp spe
.clfy particular things which may be
done by the interstate commerce
commission.
Provisions of Bill,
In addition to this the bill has the
publicity feature and gives the com
mission jurisdiction over refrigeration
and terminal charges. It also directly
prohibits a carrier from granting any
shipper the privilege of collecting his
product and then getting a special rate
under a short term provision for
changing the rates.
Townsend Explains Bill.
As explained today by Townsend,
the bill "expresses the ideas of the
President as detailed in his message
and will, if enacted into law, amend
the. interstate commerce law so as to
make it more effectual in securing ex
act justice between carriers, shippers,
producers and consumers.
What the President Asks.
"The President in his message calls
^particular attention to three matters,"
said Mr. Townsend' today, "which
should be included in any measure to
amend the interstate commerce law:
"First—To provide against the so
called midnight rates.
"Second—To empower the commis
sion with authority to fix, upon com
gtplalnt and full hearing a reasonable
||maxlmum rate in place of one found
Yby the commission to be unreasonable
and have it go into early effect.
"Third—To compel the widest pub
send bill fully accomplishes."
Canal Bill First of All.
The session of the house committee
on rules was held just before the
house convened today and resulted in
the preparation of a rule which will
force consideration of the canal ap
propriation bill should una.nftnous
consent be refused. The rule pro
vides for unlimited debate. McNary,
of Massachusetts, introduced the bill.

In explanation of the drastic action,
the management of the railroads says
the decision was reached, not as a re
sult of the recent attitude of President
Roosevelt, nor as the result of the poli
tical situation, but because the railroad
has come to the conclusion that the
spirit of the interstate commerce law
does not favor free-passes and that
the custom shrould be abolished.
The management of the Pennsyl

lowed by similar action by the Read

Chicago, Dec. 6.—State Senator
Frank C.. Farnum, charged with being
an accessory to the murder of County
Commissioner John Kopf, was today
held to the grand jury in bonds of $20,
,000 for hearing December 16.
Farnum, who represents the nine

will necessitate every member of the
legislature who attends the special
session at Harrisburg in January pay

innovation.
The arrest of Farnum was the start

turn was the culmination oi long con
tinued bitterness between warring fac
tions of Lorimer and Deneen republi
cans in the thirteenth ward.
Evidence Laid Before Collins.
Captain Peter M. Kelly of the War
ren avenue station, who has had
charge of the case from the day of the
ward club election, held a conference
with Chief Collins early yesterday aft
ernoon and laid before him the infor
mation that had been secured. The
result was ..the decision t? arrest Far

The police, continue to hold that be
yond a doubt Roberts, the 'election
clerk, was the only man who had a
hand in the actual stabbing, which
took place in the voting room at 1460
West Madison street. Numerous wit
nesses have stated this to Captain
Kelly, and there is no,reason for be
lieving that Senator Farnum will be
accused of taking physical part in
the riot which occurred about the
judges' table during which Rooerts
thrust his pocketknife into Kopf's
side.
Congressman Lorimer arrived in
the evening from Washier ton to at
tend the funeral of Mr. Kopf, which
took place this morning.
Denounced as Result of Plot.
The stabbing of Commissioner Kopf
attracted widespread astonishment in
political circles throughout the city.
The entire Lorimer following at once
denounced the entire occurrence as a
deliberate plot on the part of the fac
tion led by Senator Farnum, W. J.
Jackman and Fred F. Bullen, which
supported Deneen in the last election.
The severity of their criticism and
the general indignation on''the west
side stirred the Warren avenue police
to speedy action, which resulted in
Farnum's arrest.
Such an arrest has not before been
made in the history of Chicago poli
tics. Late Straday evening, sifter 411

Washington, D. C., Dec. 6.—For the
first time since the agitation regarding
railroad rate legislation became acute
Senator Elkins, who voices the railroad
view- of the situation, last night gave

measure, which'he believes would be
a solution of the problem that has been
vexing the country tor a long time.
Senator Elkips, who is cbalrinftn of
the committee on Interstate com
merce, after reading the President's
message, made the following statement
regarding rate legislation:
"As I understand it, the President
does not desire to vest the compiission
arbitrary and uncontrolled pqwer to
fix rate$. He has repeatedly stated
hoiri tn sminH inw in vtnnAa rtf *ofi fixing a rate should top subject to re

It should give to the commission
