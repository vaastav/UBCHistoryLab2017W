State, and the State shall receive thereunder
the benefit* of the constitutional provision
wWch declares that the IT. S. shall guaran
tee to every State in this Union a republi
can form of government and shall protect
each of them against invasion, and on ap
plication of tbo Legislature or the
Executive when the Legislature convened,
against domestic violence.
And I do furtberproclaim, declare and make
known that anv provision which may be
adopted by such State Government in rela
tion to the treed people of such State,
which shall recognize and declare their per
inanent freedom a^ provide for their edu
cation, and which may yet be consistent, as
a temporary arrangement, with their pres
ent condition as a laboring, landless and
homeless class, will not be objected to by
the National Executive. And it is suggested
as not improper that in constructing a loy
al State government in any State, the name '
of the boundary, the sub-division, the con- 1
stitution and the Federal code of laws as
bef ro the rebellion, be maintained, subject
oniy to modifications made necessary by
the conditions herein before mentioned, and
such others, if not contravening said con
ditions, which may be deemed expedient by
those framing the new State government.
To avoid misunderstanding, it may be
proper to say that this proclamation, so far
3S it relates to State governments, has no
reloreece to States wherein loyal State gov
err.ments have all the while been maintain
el. And for the sarao reason it may be
proper to lurther say that whether rnein
' hers sent to Congress from any State shall
60 admitted to seats, constitutioually rests
exclusively with the respective Houses, and
imt to any extent with the Executive, and
*till further that this proclamation is in
tended to present to the people of the
Slates wherein the national authority has j
been suspended and loyal State governments
ti&ve been subverted, a mode by
which the national authority over every
loyal State government, may be established
within said States, or any of them, and
while the mode presented is the best the
Executive can present with his present im
pressions, it must not be understood that
mother possible mode would not be ac
ceptable.

LEGISLATIVE _PROCEEDINGS.
SENATE.
Wednesday, Dec. 9, 1863.
A message from the House annonnced
that it had insisted upon its disagreement
to the Senate's substitute for the House
Bill for tho establishment of a system of
free schools, and asked a committee of con
ference, which was agreed to.
The House has agreed to the amend
meats of the Senate to the House Bill in
relation to the fees of justices and consta
bles.
Mr.Maxwell offered a resolution dispens
ing with the office of door keeper of the
Senate after the present session, but sub
sequently withdrew it.
Mr. Bunker offered a resolution, which
was adopted, allowing the pages of the Sen
ate $1 25 por day during the present ses
sion.
Tbe bill making appropriations for the
payment of certain militia claims was taken
up and passed.
The bill making provision for Uaiou men
who havo been robbed by rebels was taken
up, but was subsequently laid on the table
without action.
On motion of MfvHubbaiJ, the Senate
took a reccs?.
HOUSE OF DELEGATES.
Wednesday, Dec. y.
Prayer by Rev. John Moffat.
A communication from the Senate an
nouced the passage of House Bill No. Lr>3,
providing for the appraisement of property
stayed by the provisions of the Stay Law,
with amendment*. The amendments were
agroed to.
Also that Senate Bill No. 4b, making ap
propriations for the payment of certain
militia claims had been passed The Bill
was read a first time.
The vol# by which tbe services of a door
keeper for the House were dispensed with,
was reconsidered, and the resolution in
definitely postponed.
Mr. M'Grew offered a resolution, which
was adopted, authorizing the Clerk of the
House to send, as soon as possible, either by
Express or mail, as he may think most ju
dicious, to the Speaker and members of the
House, such portions of the Acts and Jour
nals as they may be entitled to, and as have
not already been delivered to them.
Senate Bill No.*3, providing for issuing
grants for land in certain cases, was taken
up.
Mr. Bee favored the immediate passage
of the Bill; it had been before the House for
many months, and wa9 porfectly understood
by all. He was surprised to see any man
oppose the Bill. Were we to wait until the
Southern Confederacy was subdued before
we take any action about these lands.
Mr. Wheat also favored the bill ; if the
House failed to pass this Act, which had
been before it for several months, and had
probably ouat some twenty-tivo thousand
dollars, it would have been far better for us
if we had adjourned six wetks ago. No
body can toeeanyting bv tbe passage of the
bill, while many will be greatly benefitted
by it.
Mr. Hagar was opposed to the bill j If we
passed it we would be doing great injury to
the people of the border connties- In his
county, (Boone), he ijnew many men who
would lose tbeirsproperty if this bill was
passed.
The report of the committee was adopted,
aud the Bill is passed by the House.
Mr. Wheat moved to take up the Bill
extending the Stay Law until the first day
of March, and called for tbe yeas and nays
on the question. The motion was lost.

The Speaker stated that it was necessa
ry that a majority of the members of the
House should be present when the acts
were to be signed:? "tie observed that many
were leaving, and would make this remark
for their information.
House adjourned.
Up to 2 Q*Clock. A.. M,
New Yoi-K^Dec.* 8. ? The rtport of the
Secretary of War is of conaidarabla length.
It raviewa our victories and pays high tri
bute to the bravery and skill of our troops.
He says the combined operations of our
army and navy against Charleston have
not as yet accomplished what was expected
of them. In Texas, a large force operating
under Banks, will give protection to the
people of that State, and cut off a chief av
enue of the rebels for foreign commerce
and foreign aid.
The armies of Lee and Meade now occu
r y relatively the samo positions that the j
did at the date of the last annual roport
West Virginia is now clear of rebels, and the
people of that State are enjoying in compar
ative peace the blessings of civil govern*
ment. ,
The rebel forces in Missouri hare been
driven beyond the Arkansas river.
No military operations of any magnitude
have taken place in Virginia or North Uar
olina. ? . . .
The Federal forces are new firmly plant
ed in every rebel State.
The success of our arms during the
oast year has enabled the department
make a reduction of over 200,000,000
in the estimates fur the ensuing year.
The trouble in regard to the exchange of
prisoners is reviewed at length, and the
blame for the non exchange is thrown en
tirely upon the rebel authorities. He al
ludes to the good treatment the rebel pris
oners have recaived at our hanps, and he
denounces the rebel authorities for the'
cruel manner in which they have treated
our prisoner3 in their hands. He than dis
cuses the act of Congress or enrolling and
calling out the national furces and says the
law has been enforced in 12 States, yielding
50,000 soldiers and ?10,000,000 for procur
ing substitutes. i
The $300 clause is allnded to, aud the
conflicting opinions in regard to it? justice
and injustice. Ho sayl a large portion ol
the troops whose terms expire next year
will reenlist, it being stipulated by the
Government that they shall have at least
one month's furlough before their present
term expires. The indications are that the
force required will, in a great measure, be
raised by volunteering and without a dratt.
An appropriation for bounces should be
maee. He speaks of the valuable service
rendered by the Invalid corps, now num
bering 20,000, officers and Privates.
Immediately after the issuance of the
President's proclamation, dilligeut efforts
were commenced and have continued until
the present time for raising colored troops.
Fifty thousand colored men are now organ
ized and the number will rapidly inerease
as our armies advance. The treed slaves
make rood soldiers and are easily disciplin
ed and are full u? courage. The slave has
proved hii manhood and capacity, and
makes a good iuiauiry, artillery or cavalry
soldier as has been evidenced on several oc
casions
The eolorod troops havo been allowed no
bounties under the construction given by
the department. They can only by the
existing law receive 10 dollars per month
for their services, while white soldiers re
ceive 13 dollars with clothing and a daily
The fortunes of war have brought within
lines large numbers of colored women and
children, and some aged and infirm persons.
A solemn trust rests upon the government
for their care and protection, the AUJ
Gen. reeommends the term of enlistment
in tha regular service be fixed at three
years instead of five, in accordance with
the act of lbCl, whioh expired by limita
tion on the 1st of Jan'y 1H03. The Sec y
rives a list of the principal ordnance ma

tho beginning of the war, &c., and thequan

Wo say with safety that ninety cases out of every

Dr. Wishart has treated in the past twenty yners,

1 have been grievously adiicied for the last twenty
eight ve*rs, *nd for ten years of that tune have not
been free from its p?n one week at a time. I have
had it in its worst form, and have dragged on a most
miserable eiistenoo? in pain day and night. Every
kind of food that I ate filled me with wind and pair.,
it mattered not how light or how small the quantity.?
A continued belching was sure to follow. I had no
appetite for any kind of meats whatever, and my die
trees *u to great for teveral montha before 1 heard of
your Pills, that I frequently wished for death. I had
taken everything that I hadheard of for Dyspepsia, with
out receiving any benefit, but on rour Pills being re
oommended to m e br one who Lad been cured by tneoi,
I concluded to give them a trial, although I bad no
faith in them, fo mr astonishment I found mrself
getting better before 1 had taken ene- fourth of a Loot
and. after taking a half a box, I am a vail mac, and
can eat anything I wish, and enjoy a hearty meal
three timee a d*v, without inoonvenienoe from any
thing I eat or dnnk. If you think proper, you are at
liberty to make this public and refer to me I will
cheerfully gave ail desirable information to any one ,
who may call on me.
Yours, respectfully, JOHN 11. MABCOCK.
