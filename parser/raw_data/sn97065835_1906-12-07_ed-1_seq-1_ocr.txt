IMPORTANT CONTEST CLOSES
IN LINCOLN
120 BUSHELS RAISED ON ACRE
Some Valuable Hints by Harry W
Olderosr, Second Prize
Winner
The corn contest which clos
ed at Lincoln Neb November
20, was a great success. About
150 Neb. boys competed for the
first prize of $50. This was a
warded to a young man who
raised 119 buhsels and 20 pounds
on an-acre of ground. Harry
W. Olderog of Gretna, Neb
who captured the second prize
of $40, raised 118 bushels and
thirty pounds on his acre. He is
a member of the Boys Agri
cultuarl club, and is greatly in
terested in matters pertaining to
farming. He writes the follow
ing interesting article on his
method ot preparing the ground
for a prize crop:
The ground on which I raised
my corn for the contest was se
lected and prepared in the fol
lowing manner:
I selected a piece of black
loam soil that had been in pas
ture for five years, and was lo
cated along a small ravine, thus
getting apiece of soil that has
received rich deposits daring
the freshets of the past few
years. Also the rich alluvial
soil as it was washed from the
adjoining hillsides. The ground
was plowed during the early
spring, about six inches deep,
and allowed to remain as it was
turned over until time to plant,
thus allowing the soil to receive
he early spring rains also to
allow the air to circulate freely
through the surface soil, and
hasten decomposition of grass
roots, etc. About the middle
of May I harrowed the ground
twice, following the same way
as I plowed it, in order to har
row the upturned sods down
ward rather than turning them
with the grass surface upward
and retarding deoomposition.
Next I went out onto the field
with a disk and disked it twice
crosswise, thus chopping the
heavy sods to a fine soil. But
upon a close examination I
found the under soil to be quite
coarse and not packed suffi
ciently close to allow the under
ground water to be carried to
the surface by capillarity, also
that in planting the crop some
of the seed would fall into these
hollows and not have a perfect
seedbed to rest in, so I rolled
the field carefully with a heavy
roller to in are a full-packed
seed bed. I harrowed it again
to be sure of a perfect surface
mulch and then I considered the
field ready for planting.
The field was new and I
thought it unnecessary to add
any fertilizer, so none was used
whatever.
I carefully '. watched the
ground and. tested it daily in
regard to temperature and
moisture, and found it to be in
good condition for planting the
ft
UNION Kttaluhed in 1886.
17th day of May, temperature
ranging in different parts be
tween 65 and 70 degrees F.
After the corn had been planted
several days I found the ground
to be drying out quite rapidly,
so I harrowed it again to pre
serve a good surface mulch,
thus checking evaporation and
hastening the growth of the
young sprouts. In a few days
days after I harrowed the field
the corn came up nicely and
every stalk seemed to be large
and healthy. The weather
continued dry, so I turned into
the field the cultivator and
gave it a thorough cultivation
thus forming a deeper surface
mulch and at the same time stir
ring the soil around the corn
and makine it more available
for plant food. A few days af
ter I had cultivated the crop for
the first time we had a heavy
rain, thus packing tee soil quite
hard, so as soon as the surface
was sufficiently dry to warrant
it, I entered the field and culti
vated it again, to prepare the
surface mulch so that a large
portion of the rain might be re
tained in the soil to ward off the
drouth which was prophesied by
many of the farmers. The same
method was followed during the
remainder of the growing sea
son, but I was very cautious
during the last cultivation to
plow very shallow and at quite
a distance from the corn to
guard against injuring the corn
roots which were then extend
ing across the entire row. The
last cultivation was more to
prepare a good surface mulch
and kill a few small weeds which
were sprouting rather than hill
ing up the corn or attempting
to cut out any large weeds which
might be found standing near
the corn.
I took great pains to keep the
field free from suckers, as this
proves great injury to the corn,
and especialty would this have
been true had the season been
a dry one.—World Herald.
Railroad Men Leave.
Following the closing up of
tracklaying work on the lines of
the Milwaukee and the North
western there is a marked exo
dus of railroad men from the
city this week. Probably 200
or more will go south or east
this week, but they are all or
nearly so on a contract to re
turn in the spring and resume
work. There is, in consequence,
a temporary lull in the rush of
railroad activity.
Don't Stop for Snow
Despite the late storm, the
land seekers from the east are
arriving daily from the
south and also overland from
the east. All these late arrivals
is the straw which indicates the
direction of the wind for next
year. The people are coming
our way, and there is no head
ing thetti off. There is a hand
writing upon the wall that tells
the future of Rapid City, and
there is something added to the
inscription daily.

FLATTERING REPORT OF MINE
INSPECTOR
$7,000,000 TAKEN OUT IN 1906
Four Thousand Men Working in
the Mines of the Blaok
Hills
State Mine Inspector Tre
week's annual report to the
governor shows the total gold
production of the Black Hills
for the year 1906 to be $6,986,
900, says the Custer Chronicle.
This is a decrease of $250,000
from last year but unavoidable
delays in the completion of a
number of mills that would
have increased the output, has
held the figures down.
Most of the delay mentioned
above is in the arrival of ma
chinery for the plants that were
expected to have been in opera
tion this summer. The figures
given above will be increased
before the year is out as they
include merely the estimates of
the managers of various prop
erties in the Hills and do not
take into account probable out
put from any property that ex
pects to have a mill in opera
tion before the year is out nor
the generally recognized activ
ity during the past month that
has undoubtedly a bearing on
the annual figures which were
comdiled by Mr. Treweek some
weeks ago and which are just
made public.
The report of this year's pro
duction by mines is:
Alexander Maitland. $ 300,000

Mainstay 9,855
Mogul 285,485
Puritan 5,000
Wasp No. 2 92,560
Total.. ........ $6,988,900
The report shows four thous
and men working in the mining
industry in the Hills, the aver
age wage being being $2.50 for
surface men, to $3.50 for miners
and higher for skilled men.
Lack of water is being looked
upon as serious and is hamper
ing the development of the
mineral industries of the hills.
The report recommends amend
ments to the present laws re
garding safety devices in mines,
to make them more specific in
thier terms. It asks for a law re
quiring heavy wire screens a
round cages when they are be
ing carried in or out of the shafts,
and also asks for a specfic law
in regard to handling and thaw
ing dynamite.
The school of mines is recom
mended for the work which it is
doing for the mining industries
of the hills.
The report shows seven deaths
and fourteen serious injuries
from accidents the past year

The Hunt's Return Again.
Return engagement of the fa
mous Hunt Stock Company in
three of their greatest successes,
December 10, 11 and 12. The
opening play will be ''The
Music Master's Ward. What
the Lead Call says of this great
play: "The standard of the
plays produced at the Deadwood
theatre by the Hunt Stock Co.,
has been above the average,and
the last production,"The Music
Masters Ward," which was put
on in such an admirable man
ner last night, was a winner.
The Music Master's Ward is a
comedy drama, and the situa
tions are so natural, so near to
life and are totally devoid of
strained, artificial construction.
Mr. Burnham, the music mas
ter, received a great ovation af
ter his wonderful scene in the
third aet, and such a finished
piece of acting has never been
seen before in the Hills. Jane
Hampton, as the music masters
ward, did an exceptionally
strong piece of emotional act
ing. The other honors of the
piece were divided equally bt
tween Mr. Cotton, Mr. Fisher,
Mr. Conoughy, Mr. Howard,
all of whom had ecoptionaliy
interesting parts. The pla^
was handsomely mounted and
thoroughly enjoyed by every
one."

The Union is Twenty.
It has been discovered by
the office boy just as we go to
press, and the same has been
confirmed by reference to the
title page of the paper that the
Black Hills Union is twenty
years old to-day. With1 refer

rumors set afloat by those who
seem to be familiar with its his

of certain facetious paragraph

been as varied iand storm-tossed
as (he passing soldier of for

chances for a further and subse

much alive at this time that.it
is able to sit up and take notice,
some, and ere it attains the age

Neither was there much of a fall
in th& temperature, for the
snow was soft, and stuck to the
walks, seemingly as it fell. Old
settlers say that it was the
heaviest fall of the "beautiful"
that has come to the hills within
a period of many years, and
they are vainly trying to make
excuses for the new antics of
the weather in the newer town
which was once the old. They
are making vain attempts to ex
plain this outlandish proceed

but little success.
The new settler is also vainly
seeking several men who stood
up last fall and without turning
a hair, said that there was abso
lutely no snow in this country,
and no winter. He, the new
settler, is also seeking the loca

sled from out the miscellaneous
junk of his car of household
goods, and sarcastically asked,
"whatit is?"
From the standpoint of mois

is worth millions to the semi

prays that more of it will come

The following latter received

the folly of undue haste in the
