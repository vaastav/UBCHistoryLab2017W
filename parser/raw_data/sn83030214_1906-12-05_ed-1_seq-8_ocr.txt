BRIDGING THE HUDSOX.
The size and representative character of the
meeting held at Tenafly to advance the cause of
a bridge over tLe North River indicate that
Northern New Jersey is thoroughly alive to the
edvauujges of euch a structure. These are cer
tainly euSdent to Justify much enthusiasm.
Improved means of communication between the
metropolis and the extensive suburban area lying
to the westward of It would enhance the at
tractiveness, for purposes of residence, of scurfs
cf email dries and large village*.
Tears ego, when a bridge across the Hudson
was flret proposed. it was advocated mainly as
r.n adjunct of the railway systems of New Jer
*s■. At least one of the trunk lines which
would have been thus beneSted has now con
structed a tunael. and It Is not Improbable that
several of the others will sooner or later secure
Fiicllar facilities for reaching New York City.
There eiitts, nevertheless, a large amount of
traffic which tunnels can never accommodate,
«nd this ha* enormously increased of late years.
Better provision for vehicles than 1b afforded
by the ferryboats Is unquestionably demanded.
The Binaries growth in the population of this
city In the lest fifteen or twenty years and the
Invention of the automobile have almost com-
I-ietely revolutionized the situation and have
created needs of which nobody dreamed a gen
eration ago. if any further argument were re
quired to demonstrate the value of a bridge over
the Hudson, it could be found In au hour's ob
servation of what takes place on the old Brook
lyn Bridge during the busiest period of the day.
Übeful as the proposed thoroughfare would
be to private carriages and trucks, It could not
Mi to prove a boon to itedestrtans as well. If,
»•• appears to be Intended, the river la to be
iToaasd In the vicinity of 51«.b street, the region
:.at»ly adjoining the western terminus
would :i -t compare In density of population with
Brooklyn and Ix>ng Ifcland City. Hence, for a
few yttare, perhaps only a comparatively small
I; umber of men nnd women would walk between
Their homes and the city. On the other hand,
tbe view which Is to be had as one looks up the
Hudson Is Incomparably more beautiful than
. ij;.ib.i*s to be seen on the East River below
:-Jth street, and a bridge, therefore, might prove
to b« a popular proujenade.
Ah ex-Governor Werts, chairman of the New
Jersey commission, remarked the other evening,
virtually the only question low left for con
sideration La, Who shall build the bridge? It
aseo* probable that a substantial revenue
would be derived from It. at least after a few
years, and this might even be sufficient to yield
« reasonable dividend on the Investment As
jret however, private capital looks askauce at
Hie -. • m kMasjaj 110 one Is able to make en
<r^r.t calculation of the return to ha expected.
That Deir^ tL cat?, it may b« nec-esscry to
rc^- ♦- ■ >J-:-*!y on appropriations bj the I*;?!?.
1 latures of New Tork and New Jersey, if the
j appeal for such aid were made r.t Albany and
: Trenton, a reasonably strong case could be pre
1 sented. Though $25,000,000 or $35,000,000 looks
j like a large sum to devote to the construction
j of « thoroughfare scarcely more than a mile
' lons, there is a growing faith In the soundness
of the principle of swdi an expenditure. lirhlfjes
i are public highways, and tuny be p.j» much needed
ias good roads. If the Hudson River bridge
were constructed by the states of New York and
I New Jersey, It might be thought bet to exact
jco toll from those who used It. If that policy
I were adopted. New Jersey would enjoy a tem
porary advantage over Long: Island, and under
those circumstances possibly the municipal au
| thorities of New York might decide to make nil
1 the East River bridges free also.
THE MESSAGE.
The President's message is no perfunctory
document. It Is not merely oSdaJ, but dis
tinctly personal. It expresses Mr. Roosevelt's
views on every large topic of public debate.
His interests are as broad as the country, and
everything which Interests him Interests him in
tensely. The message is more tuan a report;
It bristles with recommendations to Congress
for legislation. It is more than ■ mass of legis
lative recommendations ; it is full of The dis
cussion of subjects regarding which no legisla
tive suggestions are formulated. It is a message
to Congress, but It Is still more a message to
the people, for the President's state papers to
day are addressed chiefly through the news
papers to the public.
The President earnestly recommends the pas
sage of a law prohibiting campaign contribu
tions from corporations. He renews his sugges
tion for legislation giving the United States the
right of appeal in criminal cases, which would
specifically help the government in its anti
trust prosecutions. lie favors an eight hour
day for labor, so far as thai la practicable; a
federal commission of inquiry and publicity
looking to arbitration in strikes, au amendment
to the employers' liability law placing the en
tire "risk of the trade" upon the employer, and
some restriction of injunctions in labor disputes.
He advises legislation for currency reform and
the passage of a shipping bill, though iv neither
case does he explicitly advocate auy specific
measure. There are recommendations for legis
lation regarding foreign and Insular affairs of
which we treat In another article on this page.
This makes a considerable bulk of sugges
tions for important progressive legislation, but
the most interesting portions of the message are
those which the President alms, beyond Con
gress, at the nation at large. There is no ex
pectation that these Ideas will be Incorporated
immediately into legislation. That, Indeed, is
not suggested. They are left for the indefinite
"future." They are Mr. Roosevelt's views on
economic and soda! problem*, and he takes this
opportunity again to invite public consideration
of them.
The President's convictions concerning a -rrn'l
tifited Inheritance tax and a graduated income
tax are now for the first time formally an
nounced, though it has been known to the coun
try since bis recent llarrisburg speech that he
was prepared to advocate such measures. They
are presented in the message for consideration
"whon next our tax system Is revised." Mr.
Boose tt Is aware that the subject "needs long
"find careful study in order that the people may
"U'cpme familiar with whar Is proposed to be
"done" and "may clearly Bee the necessity of
proceeding with wisdom and Felf-re?tra*int."
He would have all inheritances taxed. the rate
of the tax increasing as the size of the property
Increases. This should be done not with the
Idea of confiscation, but "In a spirit of entire
justice and modcratiou" and "to distribute the
"burden of supporting the government more
"equitably than at present." The proposal of a
graduated Income tax encounters at once a stiff
obstacle, for the Income tax passed in the last
Cleveland administration was declared unconsti
tutional by the Supreme Court. It was then held
that an Income tax was a direct tax, and, there
fore, must be apportioned among the various
States according to their population. Mr. Roose
velt has no suggestion for obviating this consti
tutional difficulty. He recalls, however, that the
decision of the court was reached by a major
ity of only one, and he surmises that a law
might bo so drawn as to be acceptable to the
court. Those who have done the President the
Injustice to suppose that he would assume a
defiant attitude aud pronounce a rasping judg
ment on these grave and complicated questions
should take particular vote of his moderation
njid of the explicit terms in which be enjoins
thorough study end extreme caution In dealing
with them.
This Is by no meanp all That the President
has to say upon the economic questions which
are m-day uppermost In his mind. He Is
greatly pleased with the results of the Rail
way Rate law. alluding to the extent to which
its operation has "amusingly falsified" the dire
predictions of its opponents. He favors enlarg
ing the powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission and a federal license for corpora
tions, but enlarged powers by no mr-ani prom
ise a policy of running amuck at combined
wealth. He observes:
Often railroads would like to combine for the
purpose of preventing a Mp shipper from main
taining improper advantages at the expense of
email shippers and of the genera] public. Such
a combination, instead of being forbidden by
law. should b« favored. In other words. It
should be permitted to railroads to make agree
ments, provided these agreements were sanc
tioned by the Interstate Commerce Commission
and were published. With the*-? two conditions
complied with. 11 is impossible to see what harm
such a. combination could do to the public at
large.
The message Is characterized throughout by
that courage with which the President habit
ually faces public questions. The policy of the
administration indicated by It will be to pro
ceed along Oh lines Initiated so successfully
last winter, with constant solicitude to remedy
the ev.lls from which all suffer directly or in
directly, and scrupulous regard for the rights
of all.
THE RECOGNITION OF AGRICULTURE.
Secretary Wilsons showing of the paramount
magnitude of the agricultural Industry, -mm,,,
i«inforoed in the President's message, iui
nls-hes ample reason for the increasing Interest
which Is felt in and the Increasing study which
Is given to agriculture as a business and ■■-
Brience. Beyond question, an industry of such
dimensions la worthy of all possible interest snd
attention. It is tie greatest of our Industries,
it engages the activities of •:• greatest Dumber
of the people, and its pr •:;;- are the createst of
all. These circumstances, ire might hay. are a
matter of course, because agriculture is essential
and fundamental to all other occupations.
it la, however, a strange and paradoxical fact
thut because of its very importance agri
culture has been too lightly regarded, If not
actually treated with neglect and contempt it

There was not In it the fascinating element of

summation of the commonplace! But !>eoplo are
at last learning that even the commonplace Is
worthy of expert attention and that the neces
sities of life are worth cultivating, as well os
the luxurious fad* and fancies. Indeed, there
may be some danger o; their treating agricult

Nor may It be amiss to note, not to our na
tional credit tbnt, apparently because of those
very qualities of necessity, agriculture has not
always received the encouragement nnd aid
which have b<H>n given by the «tate to some
othrr industries. Manufactures nnd commerce

and It would be well if a generous measure of
the same solicitude were exercised, thoueh per
haps in different ways, toward this prealept of
all our industries. There can bo no more au

FOREIGS AFFAIRS.'-
President Roosevelt's method of treatise for
eif:u affairs in his tnessasej has nnp decided
advantage over, the old «ry!e. -It fnftiile* him
to diseiißs s:ili»'nt topics- in a hichiy interesting
wi(v. Brief references ,ia alphabet ica] order to
all the nations of tho plobe and our dealings
or lack of dealings with then served the pur
pose of record in a year book, but.iv ,-i vital
utterance which Ii at once the voice of the
President to the people and tin- voice of this
nation to the outer world, it is far more profit
able jin.l inspiring to hare a frank and full
discussion of the really important features of
our international activities. Not hi it amis?
to nave s<» tersely nnd purigeiitly presented to
us the argument with which the President
Introduces that portion of bis message. He
strikes the centre of the targei when he re
minds as thai if. as the world so largely now
concedes, the ™<le of morals which obtains
among Individuals should also obtain among
nations, then the generosity and the altruism
which ar<» conceded to exist widely in indi
vidual life should be not only possible but
actually prevalent in international affairs. That
Is a splendid challenge which he throws be
fore the world, in denouncing the theory of uni
versal selfishness in Internationa] relations as
a mistake and as betraying a spirit of foolish
cynicism, and it is one which lie himself has
done much to sustain.
Hut it Is not only on the altruistic ground,
but on grounds of justice, of reason and of
selfish interest as well, that the President ar
gues the cause of Japan and of the 'Japanese
within our borders. Hi* words are true in
their citation of the marvellous history of
Japan, in their characterization of the Japan
and the Japanese of to-day, in their descrip
tion of Japan's industrial and commercial Im
portance to us and to all the world, and In
their recognition of the right of the Japanese
"to stand abreast of the foremost and most en
lightened peoples of Europe and America,"
a right which they "have won on their owu
merits and by their own exertions." We be
lieve his words are equally true when he says
that "the overwhelming mass of our people
"cherish a lively regard and respect for the
"people of Japan, and In almost every quar
"ter of the Union the stranger from Japan is
"treated as he deserves." There is point to
his reminder that In every first class college
and university In the land Japanese students
are welcomed and esteemed and bis reference
to the exclusion of Japanese children from the
public schools, nor Is it Inapt for him. recur
ring to the Initial text that the Individual code
of morals should prevail among nations, to
urge that good manners should be an Interna
tional no less than an Individual attribute. We
believe that the American nation will cordially
respond to his appeal for whatever legislation
ruay be essential to the fulfilment In spirit
and in letter of the treaty which we have with
Japan, aud. indeed, all other treaties, so as to
leave "no panic's of doubt as to the power of
"the national government completely to per
"form and enforce its own obligations to other
"nations." In no other way can we escape the
anomaly, which he describes as "unthinkable,**
of continuing in a policy under which a state
or a city is free to commit any offence asralnst
a friendly nation, and the national government
is not able to prevent or to punish the offence,
but must In the last resort protect those who
committed it against the consequences of their
own wrongdoing. The appeal for justice to
Japan Is truly made, as its maker says, not
only for Japan's sake a'Jil for the sake of Im
manity and civilization, but for our own sake
as well.
The nation will welcome every word which
the President Pnys about our neighbors at the
south of us. it will strongly echo the hope
which be expresses that the people of Cuba
will realise the imperative need of doing jus
■■♦■ and maintaining order in their island. It
Is absolutely true that this nation wishes Cuba
to be prosperous and Independent But it is
no less absolutely out of tne question that the
island should continue independent if it should
persist in making Its elections a farce and
keeping Itself in a chronic state of disorder.
The President's words to Cuba, spoken In be
half " this nation, arc full of encouragement,
but also of solemn warning. Happily, there Is
reason to expect that they will be heeded, and
thai the Cuba which we «et free at so great
cost to ourselves will prove worthy of its free
dom. There Is ample reason ;'<>r the -rntula
tory, not to nay exultant, ton!- of tho Pre«i
dent's references to the Pan-American Con
gress, to Secretary Root's visit to South Amer
ica, and to the invitation, for the t!r>r time,
to all American states to participate In tb«»
World's Peace Congress at The Hajrn?. He
, i- •..- . felicitously Dr. Drago's correct appre
ciation of the Monroe Doctrine, and affords
cause for ronfidPiiee thru this country's Inter
pretation of and attitude toward the Uraco
Doctrine is no less satisfactory to the states
of South America. As for another topic, half
domestic and half foreign, which follows. the
simple figures which ho rites should, '•• snrri
cient to move the nation and thp world to in
stnr.t action. la 1874 the seal herd at our seal
islands numbered 4.700.000; in ISO!. 1,000.000.
and now. •-..•••■ How this reduction has been
effected is explained by the fad that in ISTW
H..0C0 young seals were found on the Islands
starved to death through the slaughter of their
mothers at sea. iii! in 1£97 300.W10 young seals
thus miserably perished. If these fleures do
not cause the universal prohibition of pelagic
sealing, humanity and reason must he less po
tent thai we suppose.
Entirely accordant, too. with what be says
at the -beginning on individual and interna
tional morals is what the President says In
conclusion on peace and war. It should b?
righteousness, and not merely peace, which
binds the conscience of a nation, as it does or
should bind that <<f an individual— the right
eousness which makes for peace and which is
the only sure basis of It. We commend what
he snys on this point to the special attention
of those austere moralists who are unweary-
Ing in their contentions — which are sufficiently
correct— that what la right or wrong in an indi
vidual man must be similarly right or wrong
In a nation of men, and also that no Individual
mnn can or should sui reader his conscience to
another's keeping. How, then, may a nation
surrender Its conscience to the keeping of any
but itself? That is the cogent and convincing
argument of a President who has been justly
acclaimed by the world as tbe foremost peace
maker of bis time, and it is an argument which
harmoniously and with equal force drives home
the facts that it is criminal for a nation not
to prepare for -war. and that although, and ln
de*>d tW'iuiM -we pr*»par<» for war, wo mar
«nd should do all in oar power to hasten th«
day when there shall be peace among the na
tions — peace based upon Justice, and not
upon cowardly submission to wrong." That
Is good morals for a man in relation to his
neighbors, and it Is good morals for this and
for every nation In Its relation* with all the
world.
When James Smithnon founded the Institution
In Washington which perpetuates his name he
expressed the wish that it might be devoted to
"the Increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.'* Ould>d by un acquaintance, with his in
dividual tastes, those who have executed the
trust have directed their efforts to The dissemina
tion of scientific knowledge only, but even that
task has called for a familiarity with the fruits
of many kinds of research. The requirements of
th* bequest have been admirably met. Yet
every secretary of the Institution ha?, of neces
pity, been a distinguished specialist. Josoph
Henry, the first man appointed to the off.cc. was
best known 10 ' ; ie world before he wwiH to ';>
national capital for his studies of electricity.
Spencer F. Balrd. who succeeded him. 'a as a fa
mous zoologist. .Professor Langley. the third
incumbent, was primarily an astronomer, al
though he gave much .attention to the funda
mental principles of the aeroplane, In like man
ner Professor Henry F. Osborn. on whose shoul
ders the responsibility now rests, has spent his
life in a single class of investigation — the dis
covery ; and Interpretation of fossils. By the
thoroughness of his past, work and his breadth
of vision be has fairly earned the distinction he
has now won.
For year* Dowle was "It" and they all be
lieved in him. Now he goes to smash, and they
all declare that ho was only a "faker." But forth
with a lot of them rive their adh*>r<?nre to an
other leader, and regard him as "It.*' In a few
years, or sooner, his course will be run. and then
they will troop off after somebody else. It i? a
regular "endless chain" of delusion.
The dinner given to Robert C. C>gder: on Mon
day night by the men and women whom he had
marshalled for the work of raising national edu
cational standards was a fitting tribute to a
man of unique usefulness. The educational
world commonly honors two classes of men,
the great teachers and the givers of great
endowments. Mr. Ogden belongs to neither
class. He heads no university, manages no
educational system. He is not a man of great
wealth, and his gifts to Institutions, though
generous, are not relatively large. His faculty

To find a parallel to the case of the yo ing officer
of tht> Connaught Ranger? who has resigned his
commission and re-enlisted as a private one has
to go back a long way In English military history,
says "The Pall Mall Gazette." The only analogy
cms to be presented by the career of the famous
John Ship;'. A workhouse boy, an.l tin son of a
private soldier In th" Royal Marines, young BMbb
enlisted as a youth in the Cheshire Regiment. In
the year IMB he so distinguished himself at the a?-
uilt on Rhi rtpore that Lord Luke promoted him
to an er?i,;r''; in th<s ■■•'■ Foot. On his return to
England b< fourd himself heavily :r:: r: debt, and had
no recourse but to s<il hi? commission. But em
