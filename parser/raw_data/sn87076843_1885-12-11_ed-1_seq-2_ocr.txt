lliroegnod points In tlio following pirn
graph, regarding lliopeii'ioiiingof s.i Idlers,
especially the red tspo nnd iho freedom
from par y partlsuuihip:
"liverr lionnrnblv dlfcharrfed ITidnn
soldier In tlio Uiuteil.Slntes should lie rcn
sonnblv pensioned, and this rrd-tntc pro
crnsllualing Im-incss ceae, Hidilicrs an-
not lo Iw cl:isl as party parllsans full of
gau aim venom, nut us llio true ilelt'iitlers
nf tli nslioira life, as free from coutracled
partisanship as the air ami water usisl by
Iho masse. The Government mny re
quire tlio aervices of theso lirnvo hovs
ngnin, and It behooves it In don I justly
with Ihoso who tnlce upon themselves the
credit and honor ol preserving It with
their lives nnd sacrificed physical'. The
patriot liliic-coaled Union difvii.tor Is
fully entitled to every cent and dollar
they get, for without their priceless serv
ices wlicro would tho grsnd old country
boT That is the question for iIiimo whii
think the soldier wni well paid for risking
his health, properly, hapjiinesa nod life,
that Iho nolilo linme-gusrds might enjoy
life, liberty nnd Ihe pursuit of hnppiness.
Let tho Government liquidate this obliga
tion and rest in peace."
Wo believo we can safely say thai (hero
am no more glaring frauds practiced upon
the Govorunient tlinn have been practiced
through llio piet system adopted of pen
sioning soldiers ot the lata war. While
there aro worthy nnd deserving soldiers
who have had their papers on llio for
years, whom every ono acquainted Willi
tho fncta feel (hat it is n burning shsnio
thnt their enso is permitted lo drag nlonc
year nfler year with but little prospect of
justice being dolio until it is loo lute, yet
through boibio litllo technicality and with
out politic il Influence they nre compelled
to watch nnd wail. Thousands of olhor
cases more deserving thnn tlioo who hnd
no apparent (rouble in securing pensions,
disgusted with the operations! of pension
laws and thoso who frndulcnlly operate
them, hnvc not and will not apply tor re
lief. Almost every community hnve
pnrnlcll cases wliero men who probably
never carried n musket for a day while
they were intlio army, nnd whoeo principle
occupation for the subsequent twenty years
hns been to punish nil tho poor whisky
they could get hold of, yet they hnvc no
apparent trouble in gelling a ponison
and a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars
usually Insts them less than n year.
These aro not tlio men upon which Ihe
hopo of a Republic rests.
We have a case in our mlnd'a eye whero
n Union (?) soldier wrote letter after
letter homo discouraging re-enlistments,
pronouncing il "a d d Abolition war,"
anilf-eized upon lite first pretext of n slight
flesh wound to get out nnd remain out
of Ihe Md d Abolition war. He was a
'horn' Democrnl, but seired upon the first
opportunity to gel an office in Iho Repub
lican party mid "nil of a sudden" hec.ime
a rampant Republican. During (lie years
of reconstruction nnd political excitement
Iho opportunity dawned for fortunes
about the i.iinc as that presented to the
pick-pocket in the rush of a mass ot peo
ple to get on n host or train which was
improved by this Republican Union sold
ier nnd fortune followed fast. The road
from poverty lo nflluence was a shorl one.
Arrogance and men of 'fliience' followed.
Some of theso visited Wnshiiigtun fre
quently, hnd nn axe to grind and get in
terviewed. This patriotic soldier who
had already become fnt at public expense
went down on llio Government he fit nnd
(il lo save fur coid thouasnd of hack
pension and through these men of 'fiuence'
bad 110 trouble in gelling it.
Another case, visible to the naked eye
in Wood county, la a soldier f?J who.
according to the testimony of his com
rades in tho same regiment, scarcely
ever carried a musket while in Ihe service,
but was a hnnger-on around headquarters
and devoted tlio priuciplo part ol his
time and talent with the rations dcvlcrs
for gambling through which Iiu could gel
from his honest and les experienced com
mand Iheir SIC per month in greenbacks
worth 51 cents on Ihe dollar. In an evil
hour, while far in the rear of his com
rades, as report says, were two soldiers
astride of a log playing pnkcr. A piece
of a stray shell found lis way to this spot
and fractured the leg ol one of ihu Bohlirr.
Il hnd to he nmpuUled ami he beeauio n
pensioner upon Ihe Government, and aiib.
sequent ly a stool pigeon for money sharks
and political demagogues. Ho has en
joyed the freedom of tlio county offices fur
some eighteen years past. UN knowledge
of "ways Hint are dark and (ricks that nrc
v.dn" have become invaluable to the new
officials as lliey nie sent in by iho people,
one, two nnd three at a time lo transact
die business nnd look after the welfnro of
tho county. Il lias proven n bonanza, anil
report saya he can now give his family
$f0 per week, pin money, with instruc
tions to be libera with (be churches.
It Is such cases as these (hat disgust
the people nnd cause them nnd their rep
resentatives in Congress lo feel indifferent
in regard lo dtdng j.islice lo Ihe union
soldier. Those who seek Jlligilimitely to
rob the Government nf III ' treasury nnd
lands In 1885 nrc exactly in the sumo boat
wllli thee who in 18S1 robbed it of some
of its money, nrms and omunltlnn and
sought to carry offn portion of its terri
torybut failed. There Is only ono dis

WASHINGTON lisTTTEIt.
From Our IlcKiilar Correspondent.
WAsmxtiTOX, 1). C, Dec. 7, 18S5.
Amid nil of the incongruous political
elements of which the approaching Con
gress will be composed, ll seems to he
taken for granted thnt the principle and
perhaps the only bone of contention will
bo that between tho tariff icformcrs and
tho formidable cloiucnt comprising the
inon of bulli parlies who aro out nnd out
puro and simple fico traders. Tho latter
havo the Speakership, nnd with the Spea
ker, Ihcy of course hnve tho composition
of the entire 47 standing committees -ol
t lie House, ns well as that of nny select
committee which mny be appointed to con
sider questions grnwiiig out of the tariff.
During the vacation the free traders have
been busily ut work in tho creation of
public sentiment in fnvnr of their pel
tlicury, while Mr. KmiiIuII and Mr. Kelley ,
have been cqu illy busy in putting iu n
good word distinctively prottctivc. Of
course when il comes to a downright figut
between the lriends of Mr. Raiubill uud
those of Mr. Curll'-le, the Pennsylvania
statesman will find himself the under,
amine in the contest, Iu which position,
Iionover, ho wilt not forget to c.ill upon
his Republican lrieuds ol the Pig lion
Kelley persuasion lo help him out, nnd be
may nol call in vain. Taking theso things
together, then, I may safely predict, that
there will be some legislation upon Ihe
InrifTlhis winter, Ih it wilt bo something
more than n tariff for revenuo only, for
Mr. Ruidsll is not sent here to eecure Hint
kind uf a 1 11 riff.
1 do not know the capiclty of Mr. J.
Flo)d King's epidermis tu withstand the
attacks of a letter writer who mems busi
tuss, but if the suid King has not some
sort of rcsxinse to make to the epistle
sent lo him by Mr. Culhbert Ilullitt Jones,
he and lieu linller would make a good
tandem team, with King In the lead.
Even Butler has never rcreived 3iich an
unmerciful ll.igelhitiun an this. As both
come from Louisiana whero attacks of
this diameter areonly resented by a re
sort to the inevitable pistol, it lias all
along been expected Hint the usual chal
lenge ami the selection ol "mends" would
take plnce. lint Bob Acres King hns per
mitted all his courage to ooze through a
newspaper card to Ihe public, in which he
charges Jones with being an nssassin, and
being an assnsiu, Jones washes his hands
ol hlin incontinently.
The death ol Vice-President Hendricks
Riiggesls again to the American peoplo the
possibi Illy of n recurrence of the dsngcrs
that besot us in 1877, when n resort wns
bad to a device unknown lo either org.mic
or slalulnrv laws of the land. The fact
that but one life atsmls between the life of
the Government and some small politi
cian iu frightening somebody, will have
ahiiiil as muuli terror lor the nenate nn 0
jumpiug-jick. It strikes me I lint when
lxv wild an army ol iU,U(AJ men sloou
nllhiu sight of Washington, icady lo
pounce upon il llko a lurkey upon n June
ling, there were some danger lurking ahuut
the mailer of Iho cniiltnnanco of the Gov
ernment, but there is nothing of this kind
that is now threatening us, and tho death
of Mr. Cleveland, wills the possible deci
mation of his whole Cabinet, nnd Iho Hen
ale besides, would be ns a fly upon n drive
wheel in retarding Iho onward progress of
Ibis Government of the people, by the peo
ple, and fur the people, Dom Pcouo.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE
liquor qunhTiox.
On Sunday, 8th November, IUMiopOflmourof
Clovcloud sjioko to Ills congrcKatlon Uoii tlio
question of closInK the saloons nn Sunday. Tlio
l'laln Jkaltr copied portions of this cJilrem, unit
tbo Catholic UuimK gives to what tho rialn
DtaUr copied a miasl ofllcful Indorsement by re
prlutluKlt. Tlio Untrcrtc has reproduced the following ex
tracts which innko very appropriate (Sunday
reading:
nEQUMTiojr nv the statu.
"There can bo no unubt that tho Statu lias a
right to regulato tho sale of liquor. Society lias
a rlb'ht to protect Itself against clear mid mani
fest llolotlon of order nnd propriety. Tho salo
of liquor In (Uelf Is licit and permissible,
though liable to grave and dangerous nbuso.
Thoro Is often n great readiness to cover up tlio
abuso by tlio uso, aud eo many engaged In tlio
liquor business socle to defend thu present inoilo
of soiling liquor under tho general pica that tho
salo and uso of liquor aro permissible Tho
uso," Iho lll'liop euld , "must bo distinctly sep
arated from tlio abuse, nnd nil engaged In thesalo
ot liquor must bo clearly and flrtaly told that
T1IEIIR is A LIUIT
beyond which society has a. right to cry halt.
Tlio liquor Interests liao assumed such propor
tions as not only lo menace local government
but even to lucnuco our general Stuto govern
ment. Against sucli attempt society bos not
only a right but a bnunden duty to protect
Itself and to say to the liquor Interests, that ut
best they are but a tolerated erll, aud as such
should be satisfied with being tolerated and not
auuiuo to dominate and dictate. There can bo
no doubt that tho city ot Cleveland lias the
right, If Iho citizens to will, to clobo tho saloons
ami barrooms on Sunday, Tho abuso to which
the sale of liquor on Sundays has been carried
seems not only to Justify the execution of tho
prcsont laws but to call upon every well minded
citizen who lii)s tho wcllfara of tho city nt heart
to assist the olllccra of tho law to sco that tho
Unsure executed, Thcro are plenty of laws to
control tliotalo of liquor. What la needed Is to
urge tho courts to excuto them. Courta nnd
ntnecra must bo sustained and urged on If law fa

(From the Xcw York Kvcnlng Tost.)
The almost incredible announcement is
made that the republicans of the Korlli
have decided lo muko Mahouc's cause in
Virginia Iheir own by sending money nnd
speakers to his aid. Among tho speiktrs
who nrosaid to be going upon this extra
ordinary errand, nre Judge Fnniker, Gen
eral Logan, Congressman Kelley, of Penn
sylvania, nud Senator Hoar's name is not
nn the list, but it ought lo be lo make it
complete. Three of Ihe men named,
Fornker, Sherman, nnd Logan, aro, next
In Mr. Iloir, the republican lenders of Ihe
North who are most deeply concerned
nbout Iho Importance ol tho sectional
question and ila bc-iring njion the "rights
of tho poor negro." They s.iy that (Ins is
the overshadowing issue iu national poli
tics, and thai nothing will induce them to
abandon its agitation. Yet they nro go
ing to Virginia to help Mahone, in the
name nf the republican parly; thus identi
fying him and his cause with the cause of
the repblicnn parly, thus making his work
in the South typical of what the rcpubll
can paily would liko to see sustained there
if it were in power.
Il is not possible to say of these men,
especially ol Messrs. Sherman and Logan,
that they do rot' know what Mahone
stands for in Southern politic", for they
have been in tlio Senate with lnni in the
disreputable political bargain by which
his vote wns purchased for the republicans
In return for Ihe idwnlule control of the
Federal patronage nt Virginia. That such
a bargain wns made nnd kept Is a matter
of political hislory. Mesrs, Sherman
and Login nrc entirely consistent in still
standing by their old confederate; but
their audacity in doing it, in the present
state of public opinion, and in the face of
their sanctimonious utterances about the
poor negro, is almost bewildering. Let us
ree what they nrc going lo endorse in the
name of the Northern republican parly
when they look up Mnhonc'a cause:
1 They must endorse his course ns n
repudiated from 1873 down to the present
time. When he appeared In the politics
of Virginia in 1873 Ihe State was firmly
and appircr.lly Inflexibly set against the
repudiation tide which was submerging
the fair credit of other Southern States.
A small faction ot uniiifluenllal voters
were agitating for repudiation, bill they
were overwhelmingly outnumbered by the
honest people ot the'.Siiile, who stood" 1111
falleringly liy Iheir State's honor. M"
hiuie began bis agitation by im-idintisly
aronsriig public teiilimcut in Invor of 11
ptidlaliuu, on the f.ihc ground that the
Stale wns over loudened nilh luxation uud
could mil pay Iik dt hts. Unappealing to
the most ignorant white sentiment, mid hy
rallying in his support Ihe solid negro
vote, he succeeded so well thst during 1 lie
nine yesrs between 1873 and 1882 lie hud
induced llir Slate, through Us LecWalnre,
first to repudiate one half the interest fir
nine years nn iu refunded Slulu dibt nf
530,000,000 , second, Iu lepudinle outright
one-third nf the priucipl, miming Ihe
debt to 510,000,000; ami ihird. lo repudi
ate hnlf Hie interest nn this Sl'J.000,000
This work was the sippping-i'loiic to Jin
hone's sent lo Ihe United Stales Senate,
and il was this whiili Senators Hoar,
Sherman, Logan, mid their pr(y associa
tes approved when they made Iheir com
pact vvlih hlin.
2 They musi endorse Mnhnne'j" me'liods
wllli the negroes. These hnve been 10 ap
peal lo (heir lowcl race prcdjudicis by ss
miring llicm ckhIhiiiIv- that nothing hill ihe
persistent voting ol the Republican tiil.el
will save them from 11 return lo slavery ;
In lench theni that Ihere is iiu such thing
as public faith or polilicil honcsiy; 1l1.1t
office is n mere reward for p.iriy r-ervicr,
uud thai 110 Republican call hnve or hold
office who does not yield himself nbsnliilv
ly lo hl Ixus and surirmler his manhood
completely lo his dictation.
3 They must ciulnr'c ns worthy Repub
lican Irnil Ihe ciop which Midline's sow
ing hns yielded lu Virginia a iiiiiud
public credit, a public cuiisciiiice so de
iiauchi-d Ihat nil parlies are open uud
ahamclei'S ndvocales cf repudiation, act
ually competing iu Iheir zeal for dishon
esty, so thnt Iheru is not in iho South lo
day n commonwealth which presents a
spectacle more pitiable than the proud old
"mother of Presidents."
4 They must cndori-a the Confederate
Brigadier who is Mshone's candidate for
Governor, Ihe plunk in the Republican
plulforin which favors "such annual up-
irjiiriatioiiK aamay be ndrijuiile to provide
or the care and support of disabled Vir
ginia (rebel) soldleis who need such pro
visions," uud Ihe dslly declaration ol
Mnhune's newnpaper organ Unit the Re
publicans in ihe lust Virginia Legislature
introduced 11 bill appropriating $05,000
for Iho relief nf disabled lehel soldiers, nnd
Ihe Democratic members defeated it, the
samo being proof (hat the Itetiiibllcnns aro
heller friends lo rebel pension schemes
man the Democrats are.
hy should tho republican party of Ihe
North voluntarily, and for no obvious
gain whatever, either good or bad, assume
such a burden 11a Ihls? Yet we mu glad
lo have (hem do II, for It gives Ihe He lo
all (heir professions of devotion lo Ihe ne
gio, Iho sanctity of Ihe ballot, nnd nil the
rest of Iheir sectional claptrap. After
helping Mahone Messrs, Sliiniiiii nud Lo
