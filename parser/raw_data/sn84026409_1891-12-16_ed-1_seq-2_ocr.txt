Icn"otr 14,
A Christmas approaches the pressure
on the po-ket becomes more pronounoed.
Ik Siaker Crisp comes to knotty
ujtioii and doesn't know just how to
run Congress, there is Tom Eeed on a
front seat Landv.
Every iine and every sentence of the
President's message is notably American.
"Stand by the flag" is the order that
rings ont in every rounded period.
iM'tAKER Ckp was a private in tbe
Confederate army and was complimented
for his bravery. He is the fret man
low tbe rank of "colonel" we have heard
of in the South since the war.
This Michigan Democrats want the
President to mind his own business and
leave Michigan's gerrymander alone.
That's what the Southern bulldoxers and
the law breakers generally ask to be let
alone.
The President favors international bi
juetalism, but he does not believe in free
silver coinage as a means of bringing it
about. The mine owners of the West
are many of them agreed with him in
that opinion. They are not all free silver
advocates.
Cosr.r.BMAS Spkisger is opposed to
preparing and trying to pass an exhaus
tive tariff bill like the Mills bilL Mr.
Springer was in Ohio last fall and learned
the sentiment of the people regarding
tariff legislation. He discovered that
the Mills brand of tariff reform is not
popular.
If the Democrats and republicans in
Congress were nearer evened op Jerry
Simpson might become a great man. As
the matter stands he won't amount to
"a yaller dog tied to the hind axle of the
Land wagon." Jerry struck lolitics in
the dark of the moon.
Cosi,kex r-iit;Ei: is confident
that the defeat of Mills will have no ef
fect on the "paramount issue" next year.
The "paramount issue" has received one
black eye since November 1, and if the
Iternocrata are willing to send it into
the ring in that condition they should
have the attention of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Tub llepublicans of ( thio are making
arrangemt-cts to give Governor-elect Mc
Kinley such an inauguration as has not
been in the Buckeye State for many
years. Republican clubs from every
county in tbe State, the National Ouard,
and Republicans generally will go to
Columbus January 11 to show MtKinley
that they are still in fighting trim and
ready to keep the State in the Republican
column next year.
Messrs. Cnisr, Blount, and others in
Congress, in renewing their old-time
vonrtesy and complimenting Messrs.
Reed, of Maine, O'Xeil, of Pennsylvania,
and Ilolman, of Indiana, showed the
spirit that should prevail in Congress.
Men can be politicians and still remain
gentlemen in the best sense of the word.
It was a good start for the new Speaker,
for which he should have due credit.
President Harrison" sounded the
death-knell of the Democratic party
when he said in his message: "Rarely,
if ever before, in the history of the coun
try, has there been a time when the pro
ceeds of one day's labor or tbe product
of one farmed acre would purchase so
large an amount of those things that en
ter into the living of the masses of tbe
people." The poor old Iemocracy have
nothing to hope for now nothing to live
for. Prosperity killed it the prosperity
of the country.
Tire Xew York 77m. thinks Governor
Hill and Tammany are on top. It says :
"H is not to be denied, therefore, that
the election of Crisp is, to a marked ex
tent, a triumph for the element in the
Democratic party in this State repre
sented by Mr. Sheehan, by Senator Hill,
and by Tammany Hall." It adds: "That
this result of the first deliberate action
of the Democratic Representatives is, in
our judgment, full of peril for the party
and for the cause that has made the
party in the recent past acceptable to us
and to the great body of those who have
come to its support within the past seven
years, we need not say."
Xow that the defeat of Mills has been
effected and notice served on Grover
Cleveland that the Iemocratic party is
not his private preserves, the next thing
in order will be to conciliate the van
quished. Whether that can be done
satisfactorily without stirring a fever of
revolt in the blood of the victors may
well be doubted. The patronage, includ
ing desirable couintitteship positions, at
the command of the Democracy is very
limited. Mr. Crisp could hardly satisfy
his own backers if he gave them every
thing, and if he meets the demands,
even half way, of the Millsites the cry
will go up that he is placating his ene
mies at the expense of his friends.
Just at present there is a lalL Both
sides can wait for future developments.
Rut the daily press is not in a position to
maintain silence. It is not built that
way. The newjpapers of the mugwump
stripe have no occasion to wait. They
are immeasurably disgusted. It is said
that Sherman Hoar, of Massachusetts,
the most distinctive representative of
that element, did not vote at all hen it
came to the actual election for Speaker,
and one of his colleagues followed his
example. This was the logic of the situ
ation. Whatever else the election of
Crisp means it proclaims in a clear tone
loud enough to be beard distinctly by
every mugwump in the country, that
is not to be a repetition of 18S3. If
the mugwumps want to come in and be
merged in the Democratic party, weil
and good, but as for allow ing tbe tail to
wag the dog again and the party to be
cheated ont of half the spoils of victory
civil service reform ideas, that 1s not
to be tolerated. If Mr. Cleveland runs
at all it must be as a leraocril, simon
nre, and nothing else.
The I emocratie press seems to be
ttouteahat lildered. Evidently the
magnates of that branch of the press were
not prepared for hat happened. Kven
those who fought Mills the root bitterly
tlid not export much to win, and in an
important sense they did not. It was not
their victory. They were on tbe win
ning side, but only as tbe fly was on the
caach. Nrvtr was there a contest in
politics which was more exdoMvely con
fined, as a battle-field, to the politicians.
It would be absurd to aay tbat publw
sentiment in favor of Crirp had been
worked up, or that the If ilia people had
tt'ewpted to hatnatriag him by nets
lpw auau'.ta. The a i!y politicians tuet
at Washington and played a game upon
the chess board without coiae. At aa
point of the game was there any ' going
to the country" lor consultation as to
w hat move to make. The tone of the
Democratic press, now that Crisp has
"won out," shows plainly a dazed frame
of mind. Even those editors who want
ed Mills beaten are by no means certain
they have got what they really wanted.
There is a Russian proverb to the effect
that to scratch a Cossack U to find a Tar
tar, and in this case it is already evident
that beneath the Cri?p coat beaU the
heart of David B. HilL The Governor
Senator was not in Washington himself.
He was busy at Albany trying to steal
tbe State of New York, an occupation
which gave him great favor in the eyes
of the Southern Democracy. It makes
him their "blood brother." But it now
looks as if his theft would not be accom
plished. Public sentiment against the
outrage is too strong to be resisted, and
Hill will enter npon hia Senatorial duties
immediately after the recess, covered
with shame of defeat, instead of tLe pres
tige of success, and the Crisp-Hill com
bine will prove in still another sense the
catching of a Tartar.
Why Blaine May Decline,
WasHiscros, D. C, Dec 13. In reserving
last week the promise which he made in
Washington on bis way from Augusta to
Washington to attend the January 7 dinner
of the Merchants' Association of Boston,
Secretary Blaine disclosed tbe fact known
hitherto only by their friends that Mrs.
Blaine 'a health ia the cause of great solici
tude to her family.
He would keep hit promise, he said to the
committee of the Merchants' Association if
Mrs. Blaine' health would permit. It is re
garded a entirely possible that her condi
tion of health may be such at that time as
to prevent Mr. Blaine from going to Boston.
Tbe strain of the past two years, the death
of her son and o fher daughter together with
the stress of the constant attention day and
night, which she has given her husband's
health, have all told upon Mrs. Blaine's
strength, ao that the change in her has been
the cause of much sympathy among her
friends.
The friends here of Secretary Blaine say
that if he is thinking of making the an
nouncement of declination, which Harrison
so confidently expects, it will be tbe condi
tion of his wife's health, which would
prompt him to it. Tbe Secretary may have
to take Mrs. Blaine away for a thorough
change and for rest in a more congenial
climate.
Blaine's Candidacy.
Washisi.tos, V. C,Pec. 11. Hon. J. S.
Clarkson, the Chairman of the Republican
National Committee, held a conference this
morning with Secretary Blaine. Last night
Mr. Clarkson was with President Harrison
for several hours.
It is generally agreed by the Harrison and
Blaine men that the question of Blaine's
candidacy will probably be settled this
week. If the name of Stephen B. Ei kins is
sent to tbe Senate as the next Secretary of
War it may be taken that Mr. Blaine will
not be a candidate.
Mr. Clarkson is undoubtedly now discuss
ing the subject with tbe Secretary of State,
and if Mr. Blaine communicates to the pub
be it wiU be through Mr. Clarkson. It is
desired to have the iuestkm settled before
Clarkson starts on his Western tour.
Congressmen Scared.
Washisgtos, D. C, Dec li. About 1
o'clock to-day an explosion occurred in the
ball of the House, making a noise that could
be heard all over the building, and nearly
causing a panic among tbe members and
others present.
The House was not in session, and not
more than l'A members were in the hall,
together with a large number of the usual
hangers-on. Suddenly a report like the ex
plosion of a heavy blast sounded through
the building, and with a shout every man
in the hall made a rush for the corridor.
The explosion occurred in the corner of
the ball nearest the Speaker's room, and the
first idea wat that some one had thrown a
bomb in that room.
A volume of steam pouring through the
hall with a roaring sound, however disclos
ed the fact that it was merely tbe bursting
of a steam-pipe used in heating tbe House.
Some Coming Bills.
Washisgto. , Iec It. When the House
is in a condition to proceed to business, Rep
resentative Kyan, of Nebraska, will propose
a constitutional amendment that will, if
adopted, permit any State so desiring to elect
its United States Senators by the vote of the
people. Another measure be lias in view is
intended to correct an evil that he says ex
ists to a certain extent in the Northwest. He
proposed to compel tbe sale of all property
under United States Court processes in the
county where the property ia sold, and caus
ing tbe advertising of the same to be like
wise made in tbe county. Another measure
he proposes to push to paisage if he can, ia
one providing that after a certain amount
has been realized tbe inventor of a patented
article shall cease to be protected.
Mills' Senatorial Boom.
Galvistos, Texas, Dec. in The defeat of
Roger Q. Mills for the Speakership has giv
en widespread support, it ia said, to the ef
forts of his admirers to elect bini to the
United States Senate. .
Governor Hogg has stated that an extra
session of the Legislature will be called in
March or April. The election of a successor
to John M. Reagan will be one of the duties
of tbe body.
Senator Cbtlton holds his appointment
from tbe Governor, and although a candi
date for election by the Legislature, the
friends of Mills are said to be confident of
electing the tariff reform champion.
A Second-Sight Baby.
Hasover, Pa., Dec 1'!. In its first issue
the Hanover Adranre publishes a remarka
ble story of an infant prodigy, aged 20
months, the son of Joseph Rickrode, who
lives near the Red Hill school-house, in Ox
ford township, Adams comity.
Young as he is, the baby has been a plain
talker for nearly a year. But what is parti
cularly wonderful is his apparent gift of
second sight, if there is such a thing.
Awaken tbe child at any hour of the night,
ask birn the time, and without any hesita
tion be will tell it to the minute without
seeing or hearing a clock or watch.
One night recently be aweke, and calling
to bis father iu the same room, be cried :
"Papa, to-morrow you will have to go to
Bonnea'.:vil!e, because your uncle baa just
died."
On tbe next day Mr. Rick rote was inform
ed of the death of bis relative, which, upon
inquiry, was found to have occurred at the
exact time the night before when the child
had announced it.
Young Kit Carson too Free With a
Cun.
La JrirTA, Coh, Dec 10 Kit Carton, jr.,
a of the famous old scout by the same
name, to-day killed his aged father-in-law
and mother in law and then made good his
escape. About a year ego Carson married
M j.-s Susie Richardson, but because of bis
drunkenness and cruelty she was compelled
to returned to her Cither ' borne, which is in
Nine Mile Bottom, some twenty-five miles
from here.
To day Carson went to Mr. Richardson's
house and demanded bis wife. The old
gentleman refused tbe request when Carson
shot at him, tbe ball passing through both
hips. Mrs. Richardson, who was in tbe
kitchen, beard tbe shot and hurried to tbe
room where Carson was and was shot di
rectly through tbe forehead, dying instantly.
The murderer then mounted ber bora and
escaped into Bent Can mi, beaded for New
Me Wo. This b not the first shooting affair
Carson has txan implicated in, and it cap
tared this time there is svery reason to be
I eve this one will be hi last.
Typhoid and Diphtheria.
Fran tee Fiti-lurgn Cwcaict- Tc"u irripb.
Tbe Siate Board of Kealtnf s report touches
upon UiphtU-ria and typhoid fever in a
timely manner.
It gives a warning of the contagious char
acter of diphtheria and removts a wide
spread misapprehension a to the contagious
ness of typhoid fever.
Diphtheria has been unusually prevalent
in the past year, and at to this malady tbe
report rays : " W bile the disease ia uuboubt
ediy maintained, fostered and intensitUd by
the filthy conditions which prevail in most
of our small loans, yet tbe principal reason
of its widespread existence and its long con
tinuance in rre:ghborho--Khi is to be found in
uninterrupted corouiunication between the
sick, the convalescent, the inhabitants of in
fected bouses and the well, and residents of
uninfected houses. When we succeed in
establishing this fact in tbe minds of people,
and in inducing them to adopt tbe precau
tions which it necessitates, we shall have
rendered epidemics of diphtheria as rare as
those of smallpox now are."
As to thecontagionsness of typhoid fever,
the report says : "This disease, on the con
trary, is not spread by direct contact and in.
fection. It is important that this fact should
be as widely diKi-minaleU as the other. In
an inspection made by tbe Secretary within
the last month a hapless individual who,
with several members of bis family, had re
cently suffered from this disease, complain
ed that tbe neighbors were all afraid that
tbey would not come into the house, and
be and bis family found it difficult to obtain
the necessaries of life and nursing care.
This belief prevails quite widely, and is en
tirely unfounded. A well person may nurse
a typhoid fever patient night and day with
impunity, only taking tbe precaution not
to eat or arms in tne sic room, auu iu
drink no unboiled water."
How to Preserve Potatoes.
Tbe French Minister of Agriculture pub
lishes tbe details of the process in tbe ofilcial
ZJkWci'h du SlinUtere de t Agriculture for
March 1S91. Tbe following ia a translation
of the essential part of the scheme.
I. The method of preservation consists in
plunging the tubers, before storeing them
away, for ten hours into a ' per cent, soln
tion of commtrcial sulphuric acid in water;
two parts of acid to 100 p;irts of water.
3. The acid penetrates the eyes to the
depth of about one-fortieth inch (two milli
meters1, which serves to destroy theirsprout.
ing poser; it does not have any appreciable
effect upon tbe skin of tbe potatoes.
3. After remaining ia the liquid ten hours
the tubers must be thoroughly dried before
storing away.
4. Tbe same liquid may be nsed any num
ber of tiroes with tqually good results.
.". A barrel or tank of any kind will do
for the treatment. Tbe arid is so diludeit
does not effect the wood.
;. Chemical analysis shows that potatoes
treated by this process sre as nutritious and
healthful after eighteen months as when
frehly dug.
7. Potatoes thus treated are of course
worthless for planting.
Tried to Kill a Priest.
Uoii.tDAVsr.i ao, l'a., Dec 13. An attempt
to murder Rev. Father John Heine, of St.
Michael's Roman Catholic Church, last
night has aroued the people of this vicin
ity, who sre making great efforts to locate
the would-be assassin.
Two murderous robbers pried open a win
dow of tbe residence leading into the kitchen
late at night. Tbey crawled through very
duietly, felt about for tbe door leading up
stairs where the priest was sleeping, and
mounted tbe stairs. Rich carried a revolver
in bis band.
Father Heine was disturbed from his sleep
by a click of of tbe door latch and arose and
walkad into the halL Quicker than a Hash
the burglars each fired a shot at him and
fled. The pries was unharmed, but was so
dated by the astounding reception be met
that it wai a few minutes before be could
give an intelligible alarm.
A Pipe of Dynamite.
Bostoic, Mara., Dec 10. A novel means
to try to kill an Italian was employed by
some unknown person last night. Angelo
Marino, of Boston, is employed on the sewer
at Faneoil, Mass., and his solace, after a
bard day's work, has always been h s pipe.
Lat night, as be was about to retire, be
lighted the pipe. At the same moment there
was a loud explosion, and tbe pipe was
blown to atoms. When Marino recovered
from the first shock of the explosion he saw
that tbe ends of three fingers and a thumb
on one hand had been blown off, and a bole
was made through the knuckle joint of his
third finger on the other hand. Somebody
bad tilled the pipe with dynamite with the
probable intention of killing him.
Jewels in a Tramp's Lunch.
F.ejk, Pa., Dee, !'. A lady's beautiful gold
ring, set with rubies and pearls, unconscious
ly given sway in a sandwich to a tramp
that is the circumstatiee which has just come
out in tbe tramp's hearing before an Erie
magistrate Tbe tramp had called at an
East Second street home and asked for
bread.
The young lady of tbe house took off her
ring, laid it on tbe kitchen table, cut two
slices of bread, unwittingly laid one on tbe
ring, placed that slice over the other with
its layer of meat, and tbus involuntarily
gave away ber ring, which adhered to tbe
bottom of tbe npper slice of bread. Tbe
tramp's effort to sell tbe ring led to arrest,
identification and recovery.
Four Little Victims.
Lancaster, Fa., Dec. In. Two of tbe chil
dren of J. Lindman and two children of
Isaac Hess have died during tbe past few
days from diphtheria. The deaths have oc
casioned considerable talk because it is
learned that the little ones had not been at
tended by a physician.
Hess baa a daughter who was an invalid
for years. She tock no medicine, but sud
denly became well or at least thought she
bad been restored to good health. Tben it
was given ont that sbe had experienced a
miraculous cure that she bad been "an
notated." The family were not wholly
satisfied of this, however, for this daughter
began a course of medical reading; in other
words, she studied medicine in a crude way,
and sbe, it is understood, has been doctoring
the children who have died.
A Miserable End.
West SirxBioa, Wis, Dec 10. Thomas
K other came here in .1Sj.'J from Pennsylva
nia, and that bis time has not been lest since
tben (11 proved this morning when a neigh
bor, alarmed at the old man's non-appearance,
broke into bis residence and found
bim stretched dead on bis bed, a pile of
gold beside bim, a bundle of bills on tbe
table, and a miscellaneous assortment of
Government bonds, mortages and other se
curities scattered on the floor.
Wealth to the amount of over $Ji,Xi0 wss
scattered about the room. Investigation
showed that the ell man bad been engaged
in counting bis wealth when stricken by
heart disrate.

Farmers' Annual Institute.
The Third Annual Session of the Somerset
County Fanners JnJtlt ate, which meets la
the Court House, January &th and -tb.
promises to equal at least, if not exceed, in
interest tbe sessions that have already been
held. Hon. John A. Woodward, of Centre
county, who was so highly appreciated by
all who had tbe pleasure of bearing him
two years ago, will be present to talk npon
some special topic, and to take part in the
general work of the session.
Hon. Thoa. J. Edge, Secretary of the Mate
Board of Agriculture, who is an " unabridg
ed dictionary" of general Information on
all subjects connected with Agriculture,
will also be here, to give to tbe farmers of
Somerset county, the bemfit of bis special
training in this particular line.
Mr. S. B. Heigf, 0 York county, who
has a large experience in Institute work, has
promised his presence, snd will not only aid
in tbe general work, but will deliver a lect
ure on geology or some other subject of spec
ial interest to farmers, at some time during
the session.
Mr. J. T. Ail man, one of Juniata county's
moat active farmers, and lecturer of the State
Grange, will talk about " tbe good time com
ing and how to help it on," and will prove
himself an active " man of all work."'
Wm. Fiear, Professor of Agricultural
Chemistry in the state college, cornea to give
ns light on tbe " chemical analysis of fertil
izers, and the general relation that tbe sci
ence of cbamistry bears to the agricultural
industry."
A number of ladies and gentlemen of our
own county will read papers and discuss
questions of special interest to farmers and
their families. No work undertaken by our
people in the past, has excited more interest
than was manifested in the former sessions
of onr County Farmers' Institute. They
are regarded as a means of education that
farmers and their families can not afford to
miss.
Tbe expenses are met by an appropriation,
made by tbe State to tbe State Board of Ag
riculture, and every farmer who wishes to
secure bis full share of the benefit of this
fund expended by tbe Commonwealth for
tbe special benefit of his class, should not
fail to be present.
Application has been made for special
rates on tbe railroad running through the
county, which we have no doubt will be
granted, as has been the case in tbe past.
