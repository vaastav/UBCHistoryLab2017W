This message is tbe drat of several
which 1 shall send to congress during
tbe Interval between tbe opening of
Its regular session and its adjourn?

amount of information to be comma

government, tbe number of Important
subjects calling for comment by tbe
executive and tbe transmission tocon

commissions make it impossible to in

of the national legislature at its first

The Anti-trust Law—The Supreme
Court Decisions.
In May las* the supreme court band
ed down decisions in the suits in equi
ty urougbt by the United States to en
joii tbe further maintenance of the
Standard Oil trust and of tbe Ameri
can Tobacco trust and to secure their
dissolution. Tbe decisions are epoch
mnking and serve to advise the busi
ness world authoritatively of the
scope aud operation of tbe anti-trust
aci. of 1800. Tbe decisions do not de
part in tny substantial way from the
previous decisiops of the. court in con
etrning and applying this important
flatute, but they 'clarify those deci
sions by further defining tbe already
No Change In the Rule of Decision,
Merely In Its Form of Expression.
The statute in its first section de
clares to be illegal "every contract,
combination in tbe form of trust or
otherwise or 'conspiracy in restraint
of trade or commerce among tbe sev
eral states or with foreign nations"
and in the second declares guilty of a
uiisdemeauor "every person who shall
monopolize or attempt to monopolize
or combine or conspire with any other
person to monopolize any part of the
trade or commerce of the several states
or with foreign nations."
In two early cases, where the statute
was' iuvoked to enjoin a transporta
tion rate agreement between inter
state railroad companies, it was held
that it was no defense to show that
the agreement as to rates complained
uf was reasonable at common law, be
cause it was said that the statute was
directed against all contracts and com
binations In. restraint of trade, whether
reasonable at common law or not. It
was plain from the record, however,
that the contracts complained of In
:bose cases would not have been deem
id reasonable at common law. In sub
sequent cases tbe court said that tbe
statute'should be given a reasonable
construction and refused to include
.within .its Inhibition certain contrac
tual restraints of trade which it 'de
nominated as Incidental or as indirect.
These cases of restrant of trade that
the court excepted from the operation
:f tbe statute were instances which
at common law would have been call
ed reasonable. In tbe Standard OH
und tobacco cases, therefore, the court
merely .-adopted tbe tests of the com
mon-Iriw and in defining exceptions to
the literal application of the statute
only substituted for tjie test of being
incidental or Indirect, that of being
reasonable, and this without varying
iii tbe slightest the actual scope and
effact of the statute. In other words*
nil the cas«s under the statute which
have now been decided would have
been decided the same way if the
court bad originally accepted In Its
eonstructioj tbe rule at common law.
It bas been said tbat the court by in
troducing into tbe construction of the
•statute common law distinctions has
emasculated it. This is obviously un
true. By its judgment every contract
and combination in restraint of inter
state trade made with tbe purpose or
necessary effect of controlling prices
by stifling competition or of establish
ing in whole or in part a monopoly of
such trade is condemned by the stat
ute. The most extreme critics cannot
instance a case that ought to be con
demned under tbe statute which is not
brought within its terms as tbus con
strued.
Tbe suggestion is also made that the
supreme court by its decision in the
lust two cases bas committed to tbe
court tbe undefined and unlimited dis
cretion to determine whether a case of
restraint of trade is within the terras
nf tbe statute. This is wholly untrue.

The test of reasonableness was never
applied by the court at comman law
to contracts or combinations or con
spiracles In restraint of trade whose
purpose was or if hose necessary effect
would be to stifle competition, to con
trol prices or establish monopolies.
The courts never assumed power to
say that such contracts or combina
tions or conspiracies, might be lawful
if the parties to them were only mod

cured and did not exact from the pub
lic too great and exorbitant prices. It
Is true that many theorists and others
engaged in business violating tbe stat
ute have hoped that some such line
could be drawn by courts, but no court
of authority had ever attempted It.
Certainly there Is nothing in the deci
sions of the latest two cases from
which such a dangerous theory of ju
dicial discretion in enforcing this stat
ute can derive the slightest sanction.
Fere* and Effectiveness of 8tatute a

We have been twenty-one years mak

seemed to remit to the states the whole
available power to attack and suppress
tbe evils of the trusts. 81ow!y, howev
er, tbe error of tbat judgment was cor
rected, and only in the last three or
four years bas the heavy hand of the
law been laid upon tbe great illegal
combinations that have exercised auch
an. absolute dominion over many of our
industries. Criminal prosecutions have
been brought, and a number are pend
ing. but juries haTe felt averse to con
vtttting for jail sentences andjudges
have been most reluctant to Impose
such sentences on men of respectable
standing in society whose offense has
been regarded as. merely statutory.
Still, as the offense becomes better un
derstood and the committing of it par
takes more of studied and deliberate
defiance of the law we can be confi
dent that juries will convict, individu

posed.
The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution.
In tbe Standard Oil case the supreme
and circuit courts found the combina
tion to be a monopoly of the interstate
business of refining, transporting and
marketing petroleum and Its products,
effected and maintained through thir
ty-seven different corporations, the
stock of which was held by a New Jer
sey company. It in effect commanded
tbe dissolution of this combination, di
rected the transfer and pro rata distri
bution by the New Jersey company of
tbe stock beld by it in tbe thirty-seven
corporations to and among its stock
holders. and the corporations a&d indi
vidual defendants were enjoined from
conspiring or combining to restore
sucb monopoly, and all agreements be
tween the subsidiary corporations tend
ing to produce or bring about further
violations of the act were enjoined.
In tbe tobacco case tbe court found
tbat the individual defendants, twen
ty-nine in jjumber. bad been engaged
in a successful effort to acquire com
plete dominion over the manufacture,
sale and distribution of tobacco in this
country and abroad and that this had
been done by combinations made with
a purpose and effect to stifle, competi
tion, control prices and establish a
monopoly, not only is the manufacture
of tobaicco. but alto of tin foil and lic
orice used in its manufacture and of
its, products of cigars, cigarettes and
snuffs. 'The tobacco suit presented a
far .more complicated and difficult case
than the Standard Oil suit for a decree
wblcb would effectuate tbe will of the
court and end tbe violation of the stat
ute. There was here no single hold
ing company, as in the case of tbe
Standard Oil trust. Tbe main company
was the' American Tobacco company,
a manufacturing, selling and holding
company. The plan adonted to de
stroy tbe combination and restore com
petition involved tbe redlvlsion of tbe
capital, and plants of the whole traat
between some of tbe companiee con
stituting the trust and new companies
organized for the purposes of the de
cree and made parties to It and num
bering, new. and old, fourteen.
Situation After Readjustment.
Tbe Americata Tobacco' company
(old), readjusted capital
$92,000,000
tbe Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company
(new), capital $67,000,000 the P. Loril
lard oompany (new), capital $47,000,
000. and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
company (old), capital J7.ri2vj.fl00. are
chiefly engaged in the manufacture
and sale of chewing and smoking to
bacco and cigars. The former one tin
foil company is divided into two. one
of $825,000 capital and' the other of
$400,000. The one snuff company is
divided into three companies, one with
a capital Of $16,000,000, another with a
capital of $8,000,000 and a third with
a capital of $8,000,000. The llcoftce
companies are two, one with a capital
of $5,758,800 and another with a capi
tal of $2,000,000. There 'is also :the
British-American Tobacco company, a
British corporation, doing business
abroad* with a capital of $26,000,000,
the Porto Rlcan Tobacco company,
with a capital of $1,800,000. and the
corporation of United Cigar Stores
with a capital of $9,000,000.
Under this arrangement each of the
different kinds of business will be dis
tributed between two or more compa
nies with a division of the prominent
brands in the same tobacco products,
so as to make competition not onlyf
possible but necessary. Thus the
smoking tobacco business of the coun
try is divided so that the present in
dependent companies have 21.39 per
cent, while the American Tobacco com
pany will have 33.08 per cent, tbe Lig
gett ft Meyers 20.06 per cent, tbe Lorll
lard company 22.82 per cent and the
Reynolds company 2.66 per cent. The
stock of tbe otber thirteen companies,
both preferred and common, bas been
taken from the defendant American
Tobacco company and has: been dis
tributed among Its' stockholders. All
covenants restricting competition have
been declared null and further per
formance of them bas been'enjoined.
The preferred stock of thai different
companies has now been given voting
power which was denied it under tbe
old organization. The ratio of the pre
ferred stock to the common was as 78
to 40. This constitutes a very decided
change in the character of tbe owner
ship and control of each company.
In. the original suit there werp twen
ty-nine defendants, who were charged
with being tbe conspirators through
whom the illegal combination acquired
and. exercised its unlawful dominion.
Under tbe decree these defendants will
hold amounts of stock in the various
distributee companies ranging from 41
per cent as a maximum to 28% per
cent as a minimum, except in tbe case
of one small company, .the-Porto Rlcan
Tobacco company, in which tbey will
hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine in
dividual defendants are enjoined for
three years from buying any stock ex
cept from each other, aid tbe group is
thus prevented from extending its'coh
trol during that period. Al parties to
the suit and the new companies who
are made patties are enjoined perpet
ually from in any way effecting, any
combination between any of the- com'
panles in violation of tbe rtatute by
way of resumption of the old trust.
Bach of the fourteen companies is en
joined from acquiring stock in any of
the others. All these companies are
enjoined from having common direc
tors or officers, or common buying or
selling agents, or common offices, or
lending, money to each otber.
8ize of New Companiee.
Objection was made by certain in
dependent tobacco companies that this
settlement was unjust because it left
companies with very large capital in
active business and that tbe settle
ment tbat would be effective, to put all
on ah equality would be a division of
the capital and plant of the trust into
small fractions in amount more near
ly equal to that of each of the inde
pendent companies. This, contention
results from a misunderstanding of
the anti-trust law and its purpose. It
is not intended thereby to prevent the
accumulation of large capital in busi
ness enterprises in which' such a ^com
bination can secure reduced cost of
production, sale and distribution: It
is directed against sucb an aggrega-
I venture to cay that not in the history of American law has a decree
mere effective fer euch a purpose been entered by a court than that
againet the tobacco truet.
tion of capital only when its purpose
is tbat of stifling competition,, enbanc
inr or controlling pricea and establish
ing a monopoly. If we shall have by
tbe decree defeated these purposes
and restored competition between the
large units into which the capital and
plant have, been divided we shall have
accomplished the useful purpose of
the statute.
Confiseation Not the Purpose of the
Statute.
It is not the purpose of the statute
to confiscate tbe property and capital
of the offending trusts. Methods of
punishment by fine or Imprisonment
of the individual offenders, by fine of
tbe corporation or by forfeiture of its
goods in transportation are provided,
but tbe proceeding in equity Is a spe
cific remedy to stop tbe operation of
tbe trust by lnjqnction and prevent
tbe future use of the plant and capital
in violation of the statute.
Effectiveness of Decree.
I venture to say tbat not in the his
tory of American law bas a decree
more effective for snch a purpose been
entered by court than that against
tbe tobacco trust. As Circuit Judge
Xoyes said in his judgment approving
tbe decree:
"The extent to which It has been
necessary to tear apart this combina
tion and force it Into new forms with
the attendant burdens ought to demon
strate that the federal anti-trust statute
is a drastic statute which accomplishes
effective results, which so long as it
stands on the statute books must be
obeyed and which cannot be disobey
ed without Incurring farreachlng pen
alties. And, on the other hand, the
successful reconstruction of this or
ganization should teach that the effect
of enforcing this statute Is not to de
stroy, but to reconstruct not to de
molish. but to recreate in accordance
with the conditions which tbe congress
has declared shall exist among the
people of the United States."
Common Stock Ownership.
It has been assumed tbat tbe pres
ent pro rata and common ownership In
all these companies by former stock
holders of the trust would insure a
continuance of the snme old single con
trol of all the Companies into which
the trust has by decree been disinte
grated. This is erroneous and is based
upon the assumed inefflcacy and innoc
uousness of judicial injunctions. Tbe
companies are enjoined from co-opera
tion or combination they have differ
ent managers, directors, purchasing
and' sales-agents, If all or many of
the -numerous stockholders, reaching
Into the thousands, attempt to secure
concerted action of tbe companies with
a view to the control of the market
their number Is'so large that such an
attempt could not well be concealed,
and its prince movers and all Its partic
ipants would be at once subject to con
tempt proceedings and imprisonment
of a summary character. The immedi
ate result of the' present situation will
necessarily be activity by all tbe com
panies under different managers, and
then competition must follow or there
will be activity by one company and
stagnation by Mother. Only a short
time will inevitably lead to a change
in ownership of the stock, as all op
portunity fpr coptinued co-operation
must disappear. Those critics who
speak of this disintegration in the trust
as a mere change of garments have not
given consideration to the Inevitable
working of the decree and understand
little the personal danger of attempt
ing to evade or set at naught the sol
emn injunction of a court whose object
Is made plain by the decree and whose
inhibitions are_ set forth with a detail
and comprehensiveness unexampled in
tbe history of equity jurisprudence.
Voluntary Reorganizations of Other
Trusts at Hand.
The effect of these two decisions has
led to decrees dissolving the combina
tion of manufacturers of electric
lamps?-a southern wholesale grocers'
association, an Interlocutory decree
against tbe powder trust, with direc
tions by the circuit court compelling
dissolution, and otber combinations of
a similar history are now negotiating
with the department of justice looking
to a disintegration by decree and re
organization in accordance with law.
It seems possible to bring about these
reorganization? without general busi
ness disturbance.
Movement For Repeal of the Anti
trust Law.
But now that the anti-trust act is
seen to.be effective for tbe accomplish
ment ofvth^ pUniose of its eriiactment
'k 71 VJf
ttt
statute and of constructive legislation
intended to accomplish tbe purpose
ind blaze a clear path for honest mer
chants and business men to follow. It
may be tbat auch a plan will bej
evolved, but I submit that the discus
sions which have been brought out In
recent days by the fear of the con
tinued execution of the anti-trust Isw
have produced nothing but glittering
generalities and have offered no line
of distinction or rule of action as defi
nite and as clear as that which the su
preme court itself lays down in en
forcing the statute.
Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not
Repeal or Amendment.
I see no objection, and Indeed I can
sec decided advantages, in the enact
ment of a law which shall describe
and denounce methods of competition
which are unfair and are badges of the
unlawful purpose denounced in the
anti-trust law. The attempt and pur
pose to suppress competitor by un
derselling him at a price so unprofita
ble as to drive him out of business or
the making of exclusive contracts with
customers under which they are re
quired to give up association with otb
er manufacturers and numerous kin
dred methods for stifling competition
and effecting monopoly should be de
scribed with sufficient accuracy in a
criminal statute on the one hand to
enable tbe government to shorten its
task by prosecuting single misdemean
ors instead of an entire conspiracy and
on- tbe other hand to serve the purpose
of pointing out more la detail to
the business community what must be
avoided.
Federal Ineorporatien Recommended.
In a special message to congress on
Jan, 7, 1910, I ventured to point out
the disturbance to business that would
probably attend the dissolution of these
offending trusts. I said:
"But such an investigation and pos
sible prosecution of corporations whose
prosperity or destruction affects tbe
comfort not only of stockholders, but
of millions of wage earners, employees
and associated tradesmen, must neces
sarily tend to disturb tbe confidence
of tbe business community, to dry up
tbe now flowing sources of capital
from its places of hoarding and pro
duce a halt in our present prosperity
tbat will cause suffering and strained
circumstances among tbe innocent
many for the faults of the guilty few.
The question which I wish in this
message to bring clearly to the con
sideration and discussion of congress
Is whether, in order to avoid such a
possible business danger, something
cannot be done by which these busi
ness combinations may be offered a
means, without great financial dis
turbance, of changing the character,
organization and extent of their busi
ness into one within tbe lines of tbe
law under federal control and super-
But now that the anti-trust act is eeen to be effective for the accent
-pljshment of the. purpose of its enactment we are met by a cry from many
different quarters for its repeal. It is said to be obatruetive of business
progress, to be an attempt to restore old fashioned methods of destructive
competition between small units and to make impossible these useful
combinations of capital and the reduction of the cost ef production that
are essential to.continued prosperity and normal growth.
we are met by a cry from many differ
ent quarters for its repeal. It is said
to be obstructive of business progress,
to be an attempt to restore, old fash
ioned methods of destructive, competi
tion between, small units and to make
impossible those useful combinations
of capital and the reduction of the cost
of production that are ^essential to .Con
tinued prosperity and normal growth.
In tbe recent decisions the supreme
court makes clear that there is noth
ing. iii the statute which condemns
combinations of capital or mere fc.'j
ness of plant organlzed'to secure econ
omy in production and a reduction of
its cost. It is only, when tbe purpose
or necessary effect of tbe organization
and maintenance of the combination
or tbe aggregation of immense size are
the stifllhg of competition, actual and
potential, and the enhancing of prices
and establishing a monopoly tbat the
Stafhte Is violated. Mere' size is no
sin against the law, The merging of
two or more business plants necessari
ly eliminates competition between tbe
units thus combined, but this elimina
tion Is in contravention of the statute
only when the combination is made for
purpose of ending this particular com­|company
petition in order to secure control of
and enhance prices and create a mo
nopoly.
Lack of Definitciiess'ln the Statute.
Tbe complaint is made of tbe stat
ute that it Is not sufficiently definite
in Its description of tbat wblcb Is for
bidden to enable business men to avoid
its violation. Tbe suggestion is that
we may have a combination of two
corporations which may run on for
years and that subsequently the at
torney general may conclude tbat It
was a violation of the: statute and tbat
wbich was supposed by the combiners
to be Innocent then turns out to be a
combination in violation of tbe statute.
Tbe answer to this hypothetical case
is that when men' attempt to amass
such stupendous capital as will enable
them to suppress competition, control
prices and establish a monopoly they
know the purpose of their acts. Men
do not do such a thing' without having
it clearly in mind, if what they do is
merely for tbe purpose of reducing tbe
cost of production, without the thought
of suppressing competition by use of the
bigness of the plant they are creating,
then they cannot be convicted at the
time tbe union 1 made, nor can they
be convicted, later unless it happen
that later on they conclude to sup
press competition and take the usual
methods for doing'so and tbus estab
lish for tbcmselves a monopoly. Tbey
can in such a case hardly complain if
the motive which subsequently Is dis
closed Is attributed by the court to the
original combination.
vision, securing compliance with the
anti-trust statute.
"Generally in the industrial combina
tions called 'trusts' tbe principal busi
ness is the sale of goods in many states
and in foreign markets—in other words,
the interstate and foreign business far
exceeds the business done in any one
state. This fact will justify the fed
eral government in granting a federal
charter to sucb a combination to make
and sell in interstate and foreign com
merce tbe products of useful manufac
I ture under sucb limitations as will se
{cure a compliance with the anti-trust
law. It is possible so to frame a stat
ute that, while it offers protection to a
federal company against harmful, vex
atious and unnecessary invasion by tbe
states, it shall subject it to reasona
ble taxation and control by the states
witb respect to its purely local busi
ness.
"Corporations organized under this
act fcbould be prohibited from acquir
ing and holding stock in otber corpo
rations (except for special reasons,
upon approval by the proper federal
authority), thus avoiding the creation
under national auspices of the holding
witb subordinate corporations
I in different states, wbich bas been
sucb an effective agency in tbe crea
tion of the great trusts and monopo
lies.
"If the prohibition of tbe anti-trust
act against combinations in restraint
of trade is to be effectively enforced
it is essential that tbe national govern
ment shall provide for the creation of
national corporations to carry on a le
gitimate business throughout the Unit-!
ed. States. Tbe conflicting laws of tbe
different states of the Union with re
spect to foreign corporations make it
difficult, it not impossible, for one cor
poration to comply with their require
ments so as to carry on business in a
number of different states."
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
porations to engage in trade and com
merce among the states and with for-
eign nations. Every argument which
was then advanced for such a law and
every explanation which was at that
time offered to possible objections bas
been confirmed by our experience since
the enforcement of the anti-trust stat
wtm h*st amiss* la the actual dissolu-
tion of active commercial' organiza
tions.
It is even more manifest now than
it was then that the denunciation of
conspiracies in restraint of trade
should not and does not mean the de
nial of organizations large enough to
be Intrusted with our interstate and
foreign trade. It has been made more
clear now than it was then tbat a
purely negative statute like the anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by specific provisions for tbe building
up and regulation of legitimate na
tional and foreign commerce.
Government Administrative Experts
Needed to Aid Courts In Trust
Dissolutions.
The drafting of the decrees In the
dissolution of the present trusts, with
a view to their reorganization into le
gitimate corporations, has made it es
pecially apparent that the courts are
not provided with the administrative
machinery to make the necessary in
quiries preparatory to reorganization
or to pursue such inquiries, and tbey
should be empowered to invoke the
aid of the bureau of oorporations in
determining the suitable reorganiza
tion of the disintegrated parts. Tbe

were greatly aided In framing tbe de

The anti-trust act is the expression of the effort o* a freedom loving

his industry, hie ingenuity, his intelligence and his independent courage.
an expert from the bureau of corpora
tions.
Federal Corporation Commission Pro
posed.
1 do not set forth in detail the terms
and sections of a statute which might
supply the constructive legislation per
mitting and aiding the formation of
combinations of capital into federal
corporations. They should be subject
to rigid hiles as to their organization
and procedure, including effective pub
licity, and to the closest supervision as
to the issue of stock and bonds by an
executive bureau or commission in the
department of commerce and labor, to
which in times of doubt they might
well submit their proposed plans for
future business. It must be distinctly
understood tbat Incorporation under a
federal law could not exempt the com
pany tbus formed and its incorporators
and managers from prosecution under
the anti-trust law for subsequent Il
legal conduct, but tbe publicity of its
procedure and the opportunity for fre
quent consultation with the bureau or
commission in charge of the incorpora
tion as to the legitimate purpose of its
transactions would offer it as great se
curity against successful prosecutions
for violations of the law as would be
practical or'wise.
Such a bureau or commission might
well be invested also with tbe duty
already referred to of aiding courts
iu the dissolution and recreation of
trusts within the law. It should be an
executive tribunal of the dignity and
power of the comptroller of the cur
rency or the interstate commerce com
mission, which now exercises supervis
ory power over important classes of
corporations under federal regulation.
The drafting of such a federal in
corporation law would offer ample op
portunity to prevent many manifest
evils in corporate management today,
including irresponsibility of control in
the bands of the few who are not tbe
real owners.
Incorporation Voluntary.
I recommend that the federal char
ters tbus to be granted shall be volun
tary. at least until experience justifies
mandatory provisions. The benefit to
be derived from the operation of great
businesses under tbe protection of such
a charter would attract ail who are
anxious to keep within the lines of the
law. Other large combinations that
fail to take advantage of the federal
incorporation will not have a right to
complain if their failure is aacribed to
unwillingness to submit tbelr transac
tions to tbe careful official scrutiny,
competent supervision and publicity
attendant upon the enjoyment of sucb
a charter.
Only Supplemental Legislation Needed.
The opportunity thus suggested for
federal incorporation, it seems to me.
is suitable constructive legislation
needed to facilitate tbe squaring of
great industrial enterprises to tbe rule
of action laid down by the anti-trust
law. This statute as construed by the
supreme court must continue to be the
line of distinction for legitimate busi
ness. It must be enforced unless we
are to banlsb individualism from all
business and reduce it to one common
system of regulation or control of
prices like that which now prevails
with respect to public utilities and
which when applied to all business
would be a long step toward state so
cialism.
Importance ef the Anti-trust Act.
The anti-trust act is the expression
of the effort of a freedom loving peo
ple to preserve equality of opportunity.
It is the result of tbe confident deter
mination of such a people to maintain
tbeir future growth by preserving un
controlled and unrestricted tbe enter
prise of the individual, bis industry,
bis ingenuity, bis intelligence and his
independent courage.
For twenty years or more this stat
ute has been upon tbe statute book.
All knew its general purpose and ap
proved. Many of its violators were
cynical over Its assumed impotence.
It is said that the act has not done good. Can thie be said in the face
of the affect of the Northern Securities decreet That decree was in no
way se drastic or InMbitive in detail ae either the Standard Oil decree er
the tobacco decree, but did it not atop fer all time the then powerful
movement teward the control of all the railreade of the country in a ain

It seemed impossible of enforcement.
Slowly the mills of tbe courts ground,
and only gradually did the majesty of
the law assert itself. Many of Its
statesmen-authors died before it be
came a living force, and tbey and otb
era saw the evil grow which they bad
hoped to destroy. Now Its efficacy Is
seen now its power la heavy: amr Ma
object is near achievement. Now era
hear the call for Its repeal on tbe plea
that it interferes with business pros
perity. and we. are advised in moat
general terms how by some other stat
ute and In some other way the evil
we are just stamping out can be cured
If we only abandon this work of twen
ty years and try another experiment
for another term of years.

ALLIGATORS IN BATTLE.
The Victor 8tieek Hie Victim as a Dog
Would a Rat.
Two alligators belonging to a Flori
da man after living peacefully togeth
er for eight years finally got together
for a fierce and fatal fight. For some
weeks the two great reptiles bad been
showing signs of discontent with each
other, but no one anticipated the ter
rible and fatal termination of this cu
rious quarrel.
One day the attention of the garden
er, who was at work near the tank,
was attracted by a commotion in the
water, nnd. looking up. he saw the
two animals were engaged In a des
perate struggle. The man rushed to
tbe spot, but was powerless to stop
the fight, which was raging so fiercely
that the water was lashed into foam.
The larger of the combatants was
seeking to get the body of the smaller
in his wide open jaws, but the other
was too quick to be caught and moved
around and around, striking the big
reptile with bis tail and sometimes
getting the enemy's legs in his Jaws
and biting them. The tank soon was
reddened with the blood which flowed
from the wounds inflicted.
The gardener attempted to separate
the maddened contestants by beating
them witb along pole, but they paid no
attention to this and continued tbeir
fight all the more desperately. They
rolled over each other, sometimes in
the water and at times on the bank,
but always lashing with their tails.
The smaller and more agile 'gator con
tinued to bite the legs and body of the
big alligator, wbich moved about slow
ly. seeking to make a successful gral*
at his opponent's body. Their sleepy
eyes had become bright and snappy,
and it was evident that the fight was
to be to the death. At last, in an effort,
to snap the spinning tail of the larger
tbe small alligator fell over en his side,
and before be could get out of the way
the big jaws of his enemy were closed
upon him.
Then occurred the most cntions fea
ture of tbe battle. Raising himself
slightly upon his forefeet, the big alli
gator lifted the smaller one from the
surface of the water and shook him as
a dog would shake a rat—shook him, in
fact, until his back was broken and be
lay dead and limp in the great jaws.
Then the victor dropped the body and
moved off to sun himself.—New Tork

The Earthly Facts.
A story told of Lord Holt, who was
lord chief justice of England in tbe
eighteenth century, shows what a dead
ly enemy to wild superstition a sense
of fact may be. A man presented him
self to Lord Holt and said:
"A spirit came to me from the other
world and told me that la your next
case you must enter a plea, of not
pros"—that Is, refusal to prosecute.
Ixrd Holt looked at the man a mo
ment and then smiled.
"Do you believe that such a message
is wise for a human being to obey?"
"It is absolute."
"And do you believe tliat tbe messen
ger bad a full knowledge of the law of
England?"
"Tee. and of all law. By following
this heaven given advice you will be
doing justice."
Well, you tell your messenger if !ie
comes again that ha should have seat
his message to the attorney general.
The lord chief justice of Kngtepfl
asr.
er prosecutes, and if the spirit kgew
anything about the English law he
would know a simple thing like that"
Incident ef the French Revolution.
Mme. de Crequey, a French court
lady who was imprisoned in the Lux
embourg at the time of the revolution,
tells in her diary of "a small, pal*
woman" who never said a word for
the two or three days she was in the
same room, never went to bed, but sat
in a chair watching a casket she hsd
brought witb her. "One morning on
returning from tbe yard," she eeys.
"we found the little woman gone and
only the casket remaining. A jailer
came in about an hour after to fetch
it. Mme. Buffaut boldly asked hint
whether the owner would return. His
only answer was to pass his hand
across the back of his neck. Then be
proceeded to break open the casket. It
contained a man's bloody shirt with
out a collar, which was always cut off
before an execution also a handful of
silky black hair and a piece of paper
on which was written, 'For my mother.'
Our jailer never would tell us the name
of this unhappy woman, nor did we
ever discover who and what her sen
was."
