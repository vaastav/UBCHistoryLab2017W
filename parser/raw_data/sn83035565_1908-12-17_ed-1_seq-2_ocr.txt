No Danger of Militarism.
The opening of the war college at
'Washington gave opportunity for
showing the characteristic American
spirit. This was fitly Illustrated In
what was said by Secretary of State
Root, who is regarded as the "father"
of the war college because he, while
secretary of war, gave Impetus to the
movement which has resulted In the
completion of the structure. There
was nothing inconsistent, said Secre
tary Root In effect, In a nation devoted
to peace possessing at the capital
such an institution as this. The neces
sity for military Instruction was never
more apparent than now, in the light
of the demands of modern science.
And the country, however friendly re
lations may be with others, that neg
lects proper precautions assuredly Is
not wise. Secretary Root added: "We
are not a military nation, and never
shall be. We are warlike enough to
rise in defense of our rights. We are
singularly like the English, and singu
larly uulike most of the nations of the
continent Our ideas are political and
not military. We do not therefore na
turally run into the mold of military
organization." Fears of the United
States being swept into the vortex of
"militarism" are absurd, declares the
Troy (N. Y.) Times. But preparations
for effective defense are based on the
soundest principles and the purest
patriotism. Secretary Root's address
at the war college struck a note to
which the common sense of the c
try responds with promptness.
Tragedy of Vanishing Forests.
There are some men in public life
who profess to believe that trees grow
about as fast as they are used and that
it is foolish to worry about the future
and try to make provisions for it. This
opinion is sometimes heard in the
hulls of congress. Secretary of Agri
cultural Wilson, who has given the
subject much attention, says: "We are
now using in one year as much wood
as grows in three, with only 20 years
of virgin growth In sight." This is an
alarming prediction, but Chief Fores
ter Pinehot thinks It is too favorable.
He says the country is now consuming
100,000,000,000 feet of lumber, board
measure, annually, which will exhaust
otir supply of timber in 14 years. We
cannot afford to run out of American
lumber in 14, 20 or 30 years, declares
the Philadelphia Press. The waning
supply must be replenished. Our bare
hills must be reforested on a large
scale. When the necessity of this Is
demonstrated so that the most Incred
ulous must believe it, the Indifference
to reforestation will give place to zeal
and spasmodic efforts here and there
will be succeeded by a comprehensive
and continuous work of tree planting.
A Kansas school teacher is In trou
ble because she pasted strips of court
plaster over the lips of a boy who
would whisper In school. Now the
father of the boy has hired lawyers to
see whether the constitution provides
for such forms of punishment, and if
not to make the teacher share a part
of her salary with the boy to soothe
his ruffled feelings. If the teacher
wins out before the courts what a
large field it opens up! What a fine
thing it would be, for example If thoso
running for office could paste broad
strips of court-plaster over the mouths
of their fool friends! They could feel
comparatively safe with only their
enemies running at large. Many
homes might be happier if the man of
the house when he wanted to sit
down for an evening of quiet medita
tion could just seal in this way the
lips of the dear and devoted wife who
wanted to spend the same evening
telling him of his shortcomings.
The mulberry, "wisest of trees," as
Pliny termed it, really "likes Lon
don," and fruits profusely even In the
grounds of the Charterhouse, at murky
Smlthfield, London mulberry trees are
mainly derived from a fad of James
I., who wanted to found a silk-growing
industry. With the proverbial folly of
a pedant, the British Solomon intro
duced the black mulberry, disliked by
silkworms, instead of the white varie
ty, which forms their food. The black
mulberry had been planted by Cardi
nal Pole at Lambeth in 1555, and
there were still older specimens In the
garden of Syoi. Houie. According to
a pretty Greek legend, all mulberries
were originally white; but a mulberry
treat was growing beside "Ninny's
tomb" when Pyramus and Thisbe
died there, and the blood of the lovers
turned the fruit to its present color.
The English suffragettes have elect
ed again to go to jail. This is ominous
for the conquering of the movement,
for when women make martyrs of
themselves they can succeed better
than any known agency in making life
highly undesirable for other people.
A daughter of the celestial kingdom
has just joined the 707 women now

HAD HIS EXAMINER WITH HIM
One Comparatively Easy Way cf Ob
taining a Diploma.
Representative Littlefleld of Maine
is very proud of the high praise he re
ceived when, as quite a young man.
he passed his bar examination.
One of the examiners was an old
judge whom Littlefleld held in great
esteem, and uot a little awe. One of
the questions asked Involved an intri
cate point of law upon which the judge
had once written a treatise and which
young Littlefleld had learned almost
by heart. When he came to answer
the questions he quoted, as nearly as
ho could remember, the judge's exact
words.
Never a blush o'erspread the brow
of the future statesman when the old
Judge called him up before the class
of candidates. "Young man," he said,
'I want publicly to congratulate you
upon the way In which you have an
swered this question. I am amazed
that so young a man should have so
prolound a knowledge of the law."

It is now possible to secure a homestead of 160
acres free and another 160 acres at $3.00 per acre.
Hundreds have paid the cost ot their farms (if
purchased) and then had a balance of from $ 1 0.00
to $12.00 per acre from one crop. Wheat, barley,
oats, flaxall do well. Mixed farming is a great
success and dairying is highly profitable. Excel,
lent climate, splendid schools and churches, rail,
ways bring most every district within easy reach
of market. Railway and land companies have
lands for sale at low prices and on easy terms.
