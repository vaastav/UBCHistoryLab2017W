The Darlm Expedition.
We chronicled on Sunday the departure, on
the preceding day, of the United States ship
<juard, Commander ?. P. Lull, for the
isthmus. Commander Selfridge, the com
mander of tbe new Darien expedition, as he
was of the last one, was on board, with a
acieatiflc party and the naval and marine
officers detailed for the explorations to be
undertaken during the present season. The
departure of the Guard was hastened by Com
mander Selfridge, who was prudently anxious
to reach the isthmus as soon as possible, in
order to avoid tbe dangerous delays which
: prolonged the work of last year's expedition
too for into the sickly rainy season. The
United States steamer Nipsic, Lieutenant
Commander Wilson, will leave Washington on
January 1, and go to the mouths of the Atrato,
whence it will take Cemmander Selfridge and
a portion of his exploring party to Aspinwall.
Crossing the isthmus by the Panama Rail
way?along the line of which, after all, It
may ultimately be decided that the most
feasible route for an interoceanic canal exists ?
Commander Selfridge will find the United
States steamer Saginaw, Lieutenant Comman
der Greene, awaiting him, and ready to convey
film to the mouth of the Tuyra, or Darien,
river, on the Pacific side. It is earnestly
hoped that the results of tbe new Darien expe
dition will be more direotly valuable than
were those of last year's expedition.
That the latter were indirectly of great
value ? that, in fact, they cannot easily be
over-estimated, if only on account of having
eliminated a vexatious multiplicity of elements
.hitherto involved in the problem of inter
oceanic canal communication ? Is plain from
tbe summary of Commander Selfridge's
report presented in the Annual Report of
"Mr. Robeson, Secretary of the Navy. Each
of tbo three routes explored and surveyed ?
the Darien route, the Sassarti route and tbe
route of San Bias ? was found to be impracti
cable for a ship canal. In the first an eleva
rtion of 553 feet, in the second of 284 feet, and
In tbe third of 1,142 feet must be overcome
by tunnels, varying in length from six to ten
miles, and involving an expense too monstrous
for any hope of profit or advantage. Secretary
Hobeson finds in Commander Selfridge's re
port abundant proof that the expedition was
conducted with great industry, zeal and skill,
and that, although no feasible route has yet
been discovered, the field of future explora
tion has been materially diminished. He
adds that it is the purpose of the department
to prosecute the plan of exploration and com
plete the survey during the present season in
such a manner as to settle definitely tbe ques
tion of a ship canal by any of the Darien
routes.
iReport of the Comptroller of the Cur
rency.
The report of the Comptroller of the Cur
rency, which we print in another column,
gives some interesting statistics concerning
the banking interest of the country, coupled
With several suggestions which are practical
and to the pnrpose. It seems that tbe total
Dumber of new banks organized under the
Fifty-four Million bill of the last session of
Congress is only thirty-one, although applica
tions are on file for two hundred and fifty
)more. These applications, experience has
shown, are generally experimental, the requi
site capital being wanting when the time
cornea fer the deposit of the collaterals.
From this the Comptroller argues that
"the amount of capital in the Western and
Southern States, net permanently invested or
actively employed in business of various kinds,
but immediately available i'or the purpose of
organizing national bank*, cannot bs very
large," and concludes that "the improssion that
many millions of cash capital were awaiting tbe
opportunity of investment in national banking
institutions has not been fully sustained. The
provision inado by the lute act is undoubtedly
ample for the supply of those States which
Jiave less than their proportion, and would
probably suffice to supply all reasonable
demands even if not restricted in its distribu
tion." The removal of such restrictions after
the expiration of one year from the date of tbe
passage of the act is suggested. Only one
gold bank has been established under the pro
?visi'ins of the same act. Tbe prac'ice of allow
ing interest on deposits in the national banks is
one which does not need, as yef, any inter
ference, unless to restrict the New York
agents of the country banks from the custom.
Such a modiflja'ion would insure all that is
desired. On one point he is decidedly em
phatic ? viz., the establishment of a general
Clearing House at New York tor all the
national banks of the country. The benefit
arising from a fiscal agency so truly national
in its character, regulating the currency, the
ctchanges anrl tho banking interests of the
country, beyond the contrul of any ring or
Clique ? becausa managed by all for the benefit
of all ? would be, in bis estimation, of the
most substantial and enduring kind. This, his
concluding suggestion, is eminently practical,
and should receive special atteation at the
Lands of Congress.
Tire Coal Mink its of Scranton, it seems, are
about to engage in another strike. These
miners appear to be the worst stricken class in
Christendom. The lower they go into the
dopths of the Earth the higher they want
their wages to be rais-d. Some people
will never be satisfied. Apropos of this sub
ject, what is the latest report about the con
dition of the Avondale suflerers' fund?
Flippant Journalism.? Will the Southern
papers never cease 1 impooning General But
ler? The Charlotte (N. C.) Observer has tho
following : ?
"If l were a Cape Cod fisherman," said General
Holler, la a receur speech, "and anybody lnteriered
wuti nijr rights, 1 would tlcht.'' Ho wouldn't do
auytnliurof the kind. He would attempt to blow up
h.s persecutor wtiu a powder ship, du a caual
around him. or slip round aud confiscate Urn spoous.
Whether orlgintu or not, this flippant refor
to a personage occupying a prominent
position In tho councils of tho nation ought not
to bo tolerated bv respectable journalists.
<!%? Ohi ?T tl? PwfloM* OalHeot.
We glva in another column an aocount of ft
very interesting: interview between Mr. Calll
cot, in the Albany Penitentiary, and one of
onr reporters, in which the recently pardoned
convict spoke very freely of the circumstance,
which led to his two years' Imprisonment and
the heavy penalty of ten thousand dollars
fine Having Berved out his term the Presi
dent has remitted the fine, thus placing Calh
cot at liberty. For this the released prisoner
expresses himself very grateful to General
Grant, but he awaits tho advice of his oounsel
as to whether he shall go forth into the world
until his character is claar of the charges
against him of defrauding the government
while In office as Collector of Internal Revenue
In Brooklyn. He alleges that his perfect inno
cence can be proved, and, as will be seen
by his conversation with our reporter, he refers
to many details connected with his trial as
regards the witnesses and the jury. All these
facts he proposes to make public when such
justice Is doue to his injured character as will
warrant him iu accepting the President's
pardon.
There has always been a mystery about
this case of Calllcot. It was alleged by his
friends that he was the victim or a conspiracy
to shield other parties more guilty than him
self; and, notwithstanding that his trial aid
conviction were apparently fair, he was little
more than a scapegoat In the transaction.
This view Mr. Callicot evidently takes him
self, strictly affirming that he was not the
principal In any fraud committed against the
government. At present Calllcot assumes
the attitude of a martyr. His promised
revelations, If they ever appear, may be ex
pected to stir up some old and curious stories
In connection with the operations of tho
Revenue Department.
A NKW DOIXm Off TIIS REPUBLICANS in
CONURK39.? It is intimated that the republican
majority in Congress may attempt to manipu
late the Congressional elecliou laws so as to
require that tho names of tho candidates for
Congress shall be placed upon the 3ame tickets
with those containing tho name* of candidates
for State offices and bo balloted for at tho same
time tho latter are. By this means the repub
licans hope to be ablo to influence Statu ns
well as Presidential and Congressional elec
tion# by interposiug the power of the federal
government. Tbo essential failure of the ex
periment of federal intcrfcreuce in our recent
election in this city should deter the republi
cans from a similar attempt in the future. But
that the effort will be made to make tho law
goneral seems to be the general impression at
this session. Let us see how Congress will act
upon the subject.
Bohemian Correspondence. ? Western pa
pers are again complaining about tho impo
sitions practised by a oertain class of Bohe
mians wh? concoct to order correspondence
for them from this city. This is a Bpecies of
spurionB journalism that brings more discredit
upon the profession than anything else. In
most cases these correspondents comprise a
class of writers? male and femalo? who have
been dismissed from respectable journals for
Incompetency or for misconduct, and who
write as much, in some cases, from pure
personal malice as from motives of pecuniary
gain. On the other hand, there are a number
of very worthy and judicious professional cor
r spondents here who are a credit to the
papers they correspond for. With 'he latter
class little fault is ever found. It is only
against the malicious and snappish, backbiting
and scandalous class of New York corres
pondents for the iuterior press that there are
substantial grounds of complaint.
The Fancy will be delighted to know that
Jem Mace and Joe Coburn have determined
on a real fight, according to the usual regu
lations of the prize ring. It will take placa in
Cauada on the 11th of April next, for ane
thousand dollars a side, and will be as vicious
and life-' ike as the strong enmity existing
between tho two men since their collision
some time ago, the size of the stakes and the
esprit de cvrp on each side can make it.

The third session of t lie Forty-first Congress openod
to-day under the most auspicious circumstances.
The members wore in the best of humor; tUe weather
resembled May more than December; everybody
seemed to feel well disposed toward everybody else,
and the occasion was more liko a ./Ute than the
assembling of a legislative body ler serious bnsl
ness. Hut thts is notblng unusual. Whatever may
be the result of a session, whether it la serene
or stormy, it generally opens well. The members,
coming fresh from their homes and from the people,
uro lull of exuberant spirits and of confidence In
the fut;:re. They have not been overworked and
b >rou for weeks and months by impaitent consitu
ents and Impecunious office seekers; their tempers
are not sou rod by the disappointments and defeats
which follow in the train of nearly every politician;
in short, tney are tresli and the cares of place
weigh lightly upou them. The last session of
a Congress has more or these characteristics 111 its
members than its predecessors. Members who are
ambitious or remaining know their status Tor the
comlu* Congress. Having been re-elected, they
feel a certain decree or independence which they
have not known si ace their drat election. These
were unquestionably among the reelings that In
fluenced the condu t 01 Congressmen to-day as the.r
strolled leisurely through the marble halls or the
Capitol As usual on such occasions, th'--re was
a great crowd or idle and or interested spectators;
but many of those who come to see ihe opening of
Congress come with much the game feelings as they
would go to a theatre or a cin us. instead of ihe
actors ami wild beasts ihe Senators and meuC.ers j
were the objects of Interest. Occasionally some
stranger, who had heard much of the Capitol but
had never seen it, would stop to inspect the coiossal
proportions or the building, with its magnificent
appointments; but these attractious were only Inci
dental. Manifestly what they wanted to see most
of all was the men wiihout whose living presence
this great temple or the nation would be little
more than the ruins or Pompeii or Hercularicum.
Long before the hour for the asscmhllug or Con
gress the masses? the "sovereigns," as they call
thuniseive-1 ? jostled each other iu the rotunda and
through the broad passages and lobtpi. s with oa
much freedom and unooucern as if ttiey owned the
building. There wore people rrom all part* or the
country, except, perhaps, Alaska, in every style or
costume, and representing every conc eivable shade
of opinion In politics and reUgtou. Somo of
them were old stagers, men and women, too, whose
faces are as familiar to the h ahUwu of the Capitol
as those of Senator Suaiuer or oold Hen Boiler.
There con! 1 be no difficulty in placing these charac
ters. They belong to the "third house"'? tne lobby,
which seems as certain to swarm around legislative j
halls oh for vultures 10 hover around a de id carcass.
It was a study to note the movements or Mils class
of the sovereigns. The.r were more busy than
the tireless aud ubiquitous reporters or the
preBS. They mado It a nolui to shako
hands with evervbodoy? that is, everybody In
oillcial position? it did not seem to make much de
ference w he* her it was a member of Congres* or a
Cabinet officer. These harpies seem to know them
alt, or rather affect to know them. This was all the
same to their poor dupes, whom Hiey propose
fleecing, aud who looked on from a distance with as
much awe as the poor publican when he saw the
I'l arlsee go about his elaborate devotions
In mkmon'H temple. It is wouderlul
what adepts these men ate In their business.
1 saw a lobbyist approach a .Senator to
day with the customary fawning salutations
and I heard that Senator say. "Sir, I don't want to
bo seen speaking to you in public or in private."
That man went away, and a few minutes atter
wards was discoursing to a wondering crowd ot
needy i>illce-seek<?rs and claimants about his inti
macy and influence with the aforesaid Senator.
This is an instance which might be multiplied by
the hundred.
Tho reassembling or Congress to-day was not
marked with the novelty and Interest which
attachos to the opening of a new Congress, it was
mot e animated and hearty. Members knew each
other rroin long association. There was no seem
ingly purport less wandering around such as you see
when new , Senators and members enter the Senate
Chamber ami the hull or the House to begin their
Congressional career. F, very man knew bis place,
and reeling certain that he would Hnd it when
he was ready to take It, lie relt that he might sarely
spend the time in congratulating Ids fellow mem
bers aud Inquiring how it Tared with tlieru since
the close oi the last session. Congratulations were
the order of the morning and Inde.-d, or the day, lor
they did not cease until both houses had adjonrned.
Even while the President's Message was neiug read
the process of hand-snaking was gomg on to some
extent. The Sonato Chamber looken quit'- hand
some, with its new carpets and general renovation.
Here, upou the eve or the opening of the
session, as at all other times, the dignity wniu1. in.
comes "grave and reverend solgoors ' was ;?< veiely
Observed. The Inevitable and universal handshak
ing was indulged iu, but it was less demonstrative
than in the House. Thcie was no slapping on the
shoulder, with the accompaniment of "How are jou,
old boy *" or "Glad to see you, old fellow Hut still
the Senators greeted euch other cordiallv enough
in their way. The good humor which prevailed was
remarkable. One Seuator said he had no objection
to a dozen newspaper corres|>onilerits standing
around Ins seat, provided they did not report him
verbatim when he relt like swearing a little.
Sprague, of lthode Island, rolt more disposed to
talk or the fine weather and tne prospect of the
success or tho proposed carnival on Pennsylvania
avenue than upon the more heavy subject of tho re
lations of capital and labor. Wilson, or Massachu
setts, was disposed to bo generous, lie wanted
harmony iu the party. He was willing to
receive Schurz as the Indulgent father received his
prodigal son. Sumner's face was wreathed In
smiles. He shook hands with hair a dozen Senators
at once, and at the sauio time bowed with the ease
and grace or a polished courtier to as many more
congrogated around bim. As Tor the rebellious
Schurs, both parties seemod anxious to cultivate
him. and he doubtless relt llko the swam who cx
claimed,
How hippy could I be with eltlirr
W ere t'other dear cb?rin"r nway.
Morton, or Indiana, seemed to be the centre of
attraotion ror all those who were eager to ascertain
the contents of tho President's Message. Known,
as ho is, to be the right hand of the President, it was
naturally supposed that he had read the Message
aud knew ull about It. But ho was reticent to each
and all. Fenton held a sort of an amateur court.
He seemed to know everybody, and shook hands
with all comers. Cameron was discussing Pennsyl
vania politics with the Jolly Secretary of the Navy and
Oolouei Forney, wnen Cameron is so engaged he la
too much absorbed to head what la going ou around
hnn. Sc.itt, Cameron's colleague, was hanging upon
the outskirts an il he were a rci>el unci intended
carrying out literally Andy Johnson's motto by
taking "u buck seat." When Uie Vloo President
called r.tio Senate to order lie interrupted the t'tf-'j
U'tr of what appeared 10 be a very nappy company.
In me House matters presented a wore boisterous
aspect. I Hero wax an air of uixtntltm altout every
thing that was cutirely absent in the Senate. The
mart si's roamed around wltli less restraint. Tliey
were in some Instances offensively familiar with the
members. They aat m their Keats, tossed their let
ters and papers about and behaved generally as if
they felt perfectly at bome. The member* them
selves reminded you of so many schoolboys after t he
expiration of the summer holiday*. There was leas
of the dignity and decorum of tl?e Senate. Member*
slapped each other on the shoulder ad libitum and
aaid, "Old boy, how do you do?" more frequently
than anything else. The few who were successiul
In the late campaign congratulated each other and
laughed and talked over the scenes of the canvass.
Those who were defeated? and they were In the
majority ?condoled with each other and came to
tlie sage conclusion that Congressional life
ts a bore. The democrats surrounded
James Brooks, and speculated upen the cnaucos of
making a combination in the next congress with
the reveuue reform republicans. Ueneral Schenek
seemed to lie the magnate among the republican*.
Many were the Inquiries abeut his defeat by Lew
Campbell and the connection of nis name with the
hngilsh mission, (ienerat Banks was quiet and
dignified as usual, but seemed animated by the
spirit of the occasion. Sain Co* was here und
there aim everywhere, laughing, talking and acting
all at once. Fernando Wood sat gravely In his seat,
disclosing the late campaign with Judge Woodward,
of Pennsylvania, l.ogan was a target lor Innumera
ble inquiries about the prospect of the Senaioiihlp
In Illinois, and *o every member seemed to have his
specialty. Nobody was out of temper. TUere was
a feeling of general geniality pervading the 'our
which made Hie most irnt able aud nervous feel quiet
aud happy.
In the Senate, when the hour tor openl g the pro
ceedings had arrived, there was a law representa
tion of Senators on the floor, and when Vice Presi
dent Colfax appeared in lite Speaker's chair they
speedily lock their lespectlve seals. The galleries
were crowded wish spei tators, the ladles' gallery
especially presenting a brilliant uppe i ranee. Mr*.
%raut occupied a seat In the gallery reserved for
the members of Hie diplomatic corps ami their
lamUtes. Precisely at twelve o'clock the Vice Presi
dent called the Senate lo order, and its chaplain,
the Itev. Dr. Newman, "tiered a beautiful, approprt
ate and impressive prayer. Alter tills had been
concluded the Senate immediately proceeded to the
transaction 01 i ubllc business. Senator Windhain
presented his credeuiUls as Senator i rout Minne
sota, in place of Nortou, deceased, and
lie was sworn In by the Vice President.
Then the usual resolutions for the appointment
of committees lo Inform t tie House and that
I lie Senate was organized aud ready to proceed to
business wero presented und adopted. Several
Dills were lutrodnced aud motions made which
are given lu derail in the regular renert of the
proceedings. At the suggestion ol Senator Sumner,
a resolution, proposed by Senator Peuion. calling
for copies of ail the correspondence lo tiio
state Department concerning the war between
l-'rance and Prussia, was postponed until after
the reception and reading of the President's Mes
sage, aud Senator Kenton introduced it Just pre.
vlous lo adjournment. After the Senate had been
in session a short lime it t<K>k a recess
to await the arrival of tlie Message. when
tho document arrived, at twenty minutes
to two o'clock, the Senators resumed
? heir seats and listened to the readiug of it with
marked utteuilou and Impressive interest. The Pre
sident's closing expression, applied to voting "just
once," created universal laughter, ? hich was the
only demonstration of any kind Witnessed lu the
Senate, and s ion atterwards that body adjourned
till to-morrow in the oesl of humor.
The House was calked to order promptly at twelve
o'clock. Tho members miucd to ho uearly ail pres
ent sud th* result of the roll call showed that not
more tnan twenty were absent. The opening
prayer oi ttio chaplain produced a lull, wlncli
seemed u striking contrast to the noise ami con
fusion of the pruced.ng Hail.; but the calm
was of snori duration. White the roll was bemtf
culled ?Se confusion Decani? so great ai tlruex tliat
the Clerk could not bear I fie responses, and the
Speaker came down witu hn yavoi upon his desk
Iik<- it ti ipharani -r upon an anvil The roll call wan
completed, when Ben Butler appeared upon the
scene. Everybody had been Inquiring for
him, end at he walVe I in there was a
buzz hi the galleries of ?? i here comes Duller,'' The
tielHxerent lien too* no more notice of the gftllorlot
than if the; bad been (lilel wit,n Blue Nom and
Brltlsnen. Depositing ' his hat aud coal, in the
<ioik room ne weui. directly to his seat.
He wa-t hardly settled there, however,
before he espied Ins beloved friend Ulnif
ham, a>id lie darted toward tna'. gentleman's
seat. The meeting was observed by the who'.e House,
of course. It was characteristic. Butler cnbroc^d
Bmghaul and Bingham in turn embraced Bnller.
The good feeling was contajflois. Bingham sits on
the democratic side of the House, IJU (
neighbors are Sain Cox. Eldridge, Itandall.
Woodward, Nlldack and other well known demo
crats. When the fraternal meeting with Bingham
was over Butler grasped Cox warmly by the hand.
The same operation was repeated with the
other democrats I have named. Counor,
of Texas, who, it will ba remembered,
denounced Butler as a circus clown when he made
his d?but in the House, happened to be standing
near him. The era of good feelinu wa-< so great tnat
lie, too, came in for a shake of the hand of the Essex
statesman.
After calling of the roll several memb ?rs, elected
id succeed others w ho have died during the recess,
were sworn 111. Scltenck, as the leader
o the House, presented the customary
resolutions appointing a committee to wait upon
tne President, and then a recess of an hour was
taken. The House reassembled at u quarter of
iwo o'clock, and the reading of tho .Message
was commenced by tne Cleik of the House.
Hs reading occupied precisely one hour.
The members gave it tne closest attention, and
when It was concluded there was applause
on the republican side of the House. The members
sjiiieu at that oart of the message in wUlcll tie
President discusses the acquisition of Ht. Domingo.
The democrats seemed to think it a good Joke,
and some of tliem made comments as the
Vlerk proceeded. There was a loud laugh at the
President's hit at the revenue reformers. The lariiT
men were Jubilant at the recommendations in favor
of protection, while t.ho free traders seemed consid
erably disappointed and depressed. Judue Kelley
called Logan's attention to this part and grinned all
over his lace as an indication of lus pleasure. Soon
alter the readiug of the Message the House also art
j urned uutil to-morrow.
Fiie I 'resident's Message is the absorbing subject
of conversation in Washington to-night. So far as
can be ascertained from tho criticism It receives, it
is regarded as able and adroit. Taken as a whole It
in ireneially commended, especially so by the repub
licans, but disappointment is expressed that
the President saul so much upon points
which it Is thought should have had little
more than a passing reference, and said so little
upon others which are deemed oi m>re vital intorest
and importance. Those who expected ttmt by
trimming to the popular breeze aud boxing tlio
political compass be would expose his anxiety
'q bo his own successor in IsT'i were sadly
disappointed. Tho attitude of the Presi
dent with reference to tho war Between
France and Prussia calls forth constuorable
censure from the friends of cach of these contend
ing parties, who, viewing the subject from their
special standpoint, are disposed to complain of Uio
non-oxprc.ssion of sympathy with Prussia as a
Powor friendly disposed toward the United States
or with France as a republic. There w is
a good deal of disappointment evinced
at that part of the message wherein the
Cuban question is discussed. It was expected
that the 1'resldcnt would tako a different. Wew ot
me situation of affairs in the Antilles after no long a
struggle on the part of the Cm ban patriots. This

more upon the subject of tho Alabama claims. Tho
publlo Uliod had risen to fever lieat upon this
jtolnt, partly by riwa of trie recent bellige
rent expressions of Ben KutJer, who was believed
to have rorosbadowca tho President's ideas, and it
wm expected that home definite lino of foreign
policy would be officially announced. However, the
recommendation that tbe government assume the
responsibility of settling tbe claims with Great
Britain, so at* to make the question altogether a

The publication of tho letter written in lHrtft by
Admiral Porter to (iidiMm Welles. who then
Secretary ol the Saw, created some sensation for
Hit" momeui hero; i>ut the excitement wlilcii it occa
sioned hi certain circles has now almost subsided.
When tlio circumstances under which t.he <>ptMtle wan
Indicted and i Hi; trieudly relation* which have so long
existed between the President ami tin; Admiral art
well an the tuxn opinions which each entertained or
the other were carefully considered, the matter
noon tost the Uctitlou? importance tliat wan attached
<0 it at tlrst, ?<? the gnu rai sen' ment here Is that,
the publication at this time wilt fall to produce the
effect tlikt whs evidently intended. President Urant
and Admiral Porter nave always im on tne moat
friendly terms, oitlolally and socially; and the
friend* of cacti the mutual frlt-mfc* of both,
deeply deplored an occurrence which threatened
to sever (lie ttonds of amity whtcn were formed l>e
twocn them durlug a t rying period or our national
history and strengthened r>y subsequent otiiotal and
private Intercourse. After the nutilloatlon of the
letter tne greeting which tlie President gave the
Admiral, when the latter called at the White
Mouse to rotifer wl'h him about it was
anything hat cordial. Immediate reconciliation
was impossible. The President felt not ho much
Incensed against the Admiral as injured by him,
and at that interview, laboring under the ltnprnsslon
that he was deceived l.i h a ear i mate or one In
whom lie had placed implicit confidence, the Presi
dent gave utterance to the melancholy expression
that the occurrence had 'made htm loae his faith in
human nature." Alter considering the subject ami
listening to tlie . oucillaiory sentiments or geutle
nien who are admirers of himself as well as of
tlie Admiral, the Preside >t does not now seeui
disposed to look upon the matter lr? so serious a
manner a? he did in the beginning. In explanation
of the circumstances under which the letter was
written the Admiral has addressed the following
frank communication to tho President, and it is
undoubted that whatever reflect ton the letter may
be thought to have cast against the Provident is fuiiy

Washington, iiec. 3. ihto.
Mr. Prksipknt? Mt first impulse on reading thn
letter published in ihe .New Vork Witri.il was to go to
you at once ami pronounce it a fabrication; ror as
such I considered It; hut as it purported to have
been wiltteu six vears ago and published by a per
son who once neld a prominent position under the
government, 1 determined to ascertain lullv if l had
ever indited such a letter before add ressiiig you on

who has served with mc eigin years, could recall
to our recollection any circumstance of the kind, l
could uoi conceive ihat I hau uttered seutimenis i

witli those that 1 have uniformly expressed towards
you. Ttie letter, it appears, w.is a private one, and
vindictive mu t have tieeu the part of the man tint
could be guilty of so grave a breach of confidence;
and depraved, indeed, must be the character who,
to grutilv his mischievous instincts, could make
public u c aildenual letter, written, pcrliam,
under great cxrlteinent, and at this distant
day not even remembered. It seems line a poor re
turn for yuui unilorm cougdoncc and kiudness to

letter I had passed through a long and (aligning con

others know what I had to undergo, bodily and '
mentally. 1 presume It was wane under tins ex- j
ciieinent thai I wrote the letter which you say has j
made you lose your taith in human mituie- I
I have no recollection of it any more than
I would have of outer passing circumstance*
of six tears ;igo. When soveral persons have at
