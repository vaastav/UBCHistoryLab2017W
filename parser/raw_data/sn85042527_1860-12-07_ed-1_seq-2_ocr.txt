Be ii Stalp, mill mil us an unorgnnizcd mass of
Iti?liVfdlliils, uiul that the action ?>f each State
w-ns independent of (lie others, ami if any
proof of this fuel be wanting it may be found
in t.lin uetioii of North Carolina, which State,
did not enter the trnion until more than o year
after it #ni> formed by the admission of mine
Sluice, which titirn> er was required by the
Convention that adopted the present Constitution
of th? United Slates.
It is true that no provision ts made in tlic
Constitution for dissolving the Union, and it is
very probable that the patriots who framed
the instrument bad no idea that a loathsoinu
fiViiatioiMn, pundeVcd to by Northern politicians.
would ever make it necessary for the
Kafvty of the South that they should dissolve
I hp ctmin.ici on npprmnl. nf ii? In- (Ka
irtlier section ?f the Confederacy ; but it must
he remembered ns a rule of universal application,
that n vio'ation of a compact or agree- ;
incut by one party releases the other party j
from its binding obligation, ami the only question
is, who is judge of the infraction. From
the very nature of the case, in a compact with
sovereigns, there cm be 110 umpire, unless one
fs provided by the instrument itself, and in the
language of Mi. Jefferson, "each State must
judge of the infraction and the mode and mca surv
of redress." A compact between sovereign j
States, with the understanding that the majority
should put their construction upon its provisions,
would not bo worth the paper upon
which it was written. Majorities need no
protection, for they eon protect themselves,
but minorities insist upon constitutions to re
strain the mojojity, and to allow it to put its
construction upon the compact, is equivalent to
givii.g tluni Absolute nowtr to govern the
in i no lit irrespective of any restraints.
The simple statement of the ease is this:
each State entered the Union under the Constitution
; the Federal Government is the agent
of the Stales, created for special purposes and
circumsei ihed in its action hy the orticles of
agreement, or in other words the Constitution.
Whenever the States having the power to '
control this agent, permit or command him to j
violate the compact, each State, not having j
surrootier-ed its sovereignty, has a right to remonstrate
or withdraw a? she may think proper,
and no earthly power h is the right to
prevent her.
It is urged by sonn* as an argument against
fwcession, that the existing Government would
(?? destroyed by a State seceding; that the
revenue laws would become inoperative, and
the wheels of Government stand still. My answer
is this, that in the exercise of an undoubed
right and heing forced to exercise it by the
party that is likr'y to suffer, it cannot complain
of I he consequences of its own acts. If
?? ?in i - I
kjvuvn viuuiiii.i ivcaic, uiv uuveriiiiieni will ui'
iu no worse condition, except for a very short
time, limn it would have been if South Carolina
Imd never entered tiie Union, which is
acknowledged on all bauds she was not bound
to do.
The idea Hint a majority must always govern,
which has taken possesion of the Northern
inind, is as mischievous as it is fallacious, and
is contradicted by all the analogies of a Hepublican
government. .If a mere majority is
to govern, why have two bouses of Congress?
a Sennit- and House of Representatives? Why
give the l'ret-ideni the veto power? Why submit
the nc-liim <if nil i<> o iiwi:?i?l
_ -- .... J""".."' V...,..nal?
Why require juries to 1m; unanimous in
giving their ver<lict ? The conclusion is irresistible
thot it is for the protection of minorities
aud the safety of the citizen. 1 may be asked
if o niinoril3" should govnrn. My answer is,
no; but they should be able, by constitutional
restrictions, to restrain the majority from acta
of injustice and oppression. In the copartnerships
formed by individuals, the majority is
not permitted to construe the article of agreement
to the injury of the minority, but in this
case there is a disintersted tribunal to ilecide
the question. In a compact between Stales,
from the nature of the case, there can be no
tribunal to decide violations of it, and the
remedy rnnst b<r a dissolution of the agreement
without any right on the port of the majority

ui mi; uuiu a m jMoi-ni me wiuiurawai oi an}'
of the parties, otherwise might would make
right, and a compact be an unmeaning and
worthless piece of parchment.
It follows from the views presented, that
the Federal Government cannot rightfully use
force to prevent a State from seceding or force
lier back into the Union ; but, in the language
of the Intc Judge Harper: "men having arms
in their hands may u#e them and I cannot
too earnestly urge upon you the importance of
arming the State at the earliest practicable
period, and thus be prepared for the worst. It
is gratifying to know that if we must resort to
arms in defcnce of our right*, and a blow
should be strack at South Carolina, before the
other States move up in line, we have the tender
of volunteer from all the Southern and some
of the Northern Slates, to repair promptly to
our standard and share our fortunes.
In urging the State to arm, it is nol to be understood
that vre are defenceless; by examining
the report of the Adjutant and Inspector
General here with trnntmitU-d, you will see
that ufe have sufficient arms to supply the num
bor of soldiers that will probably be necessary
for some time to com*. and many of our arms

PERSONAL LIBERTY BILLS.
The action of the Legislature of Vermont
may be tulccn as an indication of what it is
probable all the other Northern States, with
the exception of Pennsylvania and Rhode
Island, arc likely to do in the premises. A
bill to repeal the Personal. Liberty law in Vermont
was introduced into the Legislature of
that State, and was rejected, through twentyfive
of the more moderate republicans voted
for it. There is no reason to suppose that the
result will be different in any other Northern
States, excepting Pennsylvania, Connecticut
and Rhode Island, whose commercial connection
with New Vork city and tho South will
probably render an appeal to the sober second
thought of the people effective to the extent
of removing from the statute books the obnoxious
nullification of a law of Congress and the

SYN0PSI8 OF THE REMARKS MADE IN I
THE COURT HOUSE, MONDAY, DEC. 3,
BY JUDGE D. L. WARDLAW.
lie appeared nt the roquet, t of somo friends, |
who eaid that his views were misunderstood; j
hia purposo was, very briefly, to express Ins I
pinions on thejnost important points of the :
grent subject how before the people.
At the Mas* Meeting lie was not callcd ontill
Ihfl day wns far spent?lie endeavored, to j
condense what ho paid, and was not permitted j
to tnko the course of observation that he in I
tended.
It was a grout mistake to fay ho was for sub- j
mission. He believed that the quiet subniU
sion of the South now, w<ml<l amount to the
coiiiirmntion of ft decree <if emancipation? i
even worse, would be the unalterable establishment
of a consolidated government, under
which this section of the United States would j
be subject to thc'dcspotic control of ft majority
in the other section, hostile in interest, and bi< terly
inimical in feeling.
He ardently favored secession?effective, per- ;
petunl secession. For tliis lie zealously desired j
u Southern Confederacy, which he believed
would be safe, powerful and successful.
With the in format ion now before him, he j
thought that the immediate secession of this
State would be the wisest step to be taker ?
1 > ,
the means m-jst likely to cll'ect the desired ,
Confederacy.
I5ut. if, upon the meeting of the Convention, j
it should appear from trotn representations of j
friends in Georgia, that some delav would bet- I
? ' ?
ter pro- mote the accession of that importnnt
State to the great Southern league, then reasonable
relay he thought ought to he nllowwl.
Nothing that he now had in mind induced
him to suppose that, in any event, delay in the
secession of this State, beyond tiie 4th of (
March next, should take place. Hut he ;
thought members of the Convention ought to !
be in a condition to be guided by circumstnn- !
ccs. Their responsibility would be groat? j
their labors severe?the requisitions upon their !
Statesmanship and caution, not less than upon t
their firmness would he exacting ; and the}* !
should have a chnneo to deliberate and exer- j
cise their judgement.
If his follow citizens slioulJ require liis ser- |
viccs, tliey would be rendered to I lie best of liis
Ability; but if be went to (lie Convention lie J
must yo unpledged. The place of n delegate to J
which he had been nominated was highly honorable;
but lie deprecated divisions and exhorted
to lmrmony; and trusted thai no perru
11 nl considerations for himself or any other
man, would prevent the union of nil, in a cause 1
which affected all, and which would be injured
by the alienation of an}'. lie
was born and had a ways lived here, j
here he expected to die?all that he had, and
all that he was belonged to his Slate; To what
his fe]low-cilizci>s knew of him, they must
trust if they srlected him.
Others thought him, it was snid, not up to
the mark. He wished only that in the time of
suffering and trial, which must come, all mny
make their deeds exceed iliei r words as far as
he would endeavor to make bis.
THE TRIUMPH OF REPUBLICANISM?ITS j
FUTURE POLICY.
With the triumph of Republicanism, and
Southern acquiescence, the doom of slavery in !
the Union is irrevocably sealed. The platform ;
of the party denounces the institution ns a
"twin relic of barbarism," with polygamy, and
afiirma the right and duty of Congiess to abol.
inli it in the Territories, while the leading Republican
Statesmen, and the organs of the party
proclaim the "irrepressible conflict''?that
this Union cannot endure "half slave and half
free,"?"that the States must become cilhcr all
slave or all free"?and that the election of Lincoln
is the first great triumph in a Campaign
which is to result iu the "final downfall of
slavery." Such is the great end which the
leaders of the party have proposed to themselves,
and every measure which policy can devise
will be put in operation to effect its consummation
; and as they themselves have announced
the battle will not be stayed until the
foot of the last slave shall press the soil of this
Continent
It is not to be supposed that n revolutionary
policy is to be inaugurated, or that the Repub
uunii jcHuere win ahiempi io enect ui?-ir purpose
cxcept under the lorms of the Constitution.
The end is (o be accomplished without
incurring unnecessary risk, and our destruction
to be effected gradually and insidiously.?
With the power of the Government in tlie
hands of our enemies, there will be no more
slave territoiy and no more slave States. The
Snpreme Court will be re-constructed on a
free soil basis?slavery will be abolished in the
District of Columbia?the internal slave trade
will be prohibited?the fugitive slave law repealed?abolition
ercisaried and newspapers
w ill find their way into our midst under Pederal
protection?slavery will retreat from the
uui uer omi?? ucivre tne surging waves OI flDolitionism,
and the pressure of free labor?until
the Cotton urates beset 011 every sido by a
cordon of hostile interests without; and exposed
to servile insurrection within, will be forced
in self protection to adopt the policy of emancipation.
Such ja the avowed polio)' of the leading or gans
of a part}' which has just elected the
Chief Magistrate of this Confederacy and who
I are fast monopolizing the whole power of the
Government, and yet we are advised to wail
au overt act. Mr. Stephens tells us that we
have nothing to fear from Lincoln's Administration
as he will be controlled by nn opposition
in the Senate and House. This at best
would be only a temporary respite; bnt-in.
deed the fnct is otherwise, and it has been
clearly shown by oui1 hading journals that there
is a strong probability, tlrat }n both Sennte and
House, tliife will be a Northern majority op
..posed to Sonther^i interests upon all .cardinal
questions, whilst every year will witness new
accessions tg^he strength of our enemies.
A temporising' vacillating policy is above
all things to bo dreaded in the,present crisis?
equally disheartening to friends and encouraging
to oar foes. Prompt dcton by our Stite

it|nijy honor lo ho associated with n people who i
?ave no respect for you?nay, who hold vou in I <

your Gospel ministers to innke way for negroes. j I
They have twitted, insulted, and bullied yonr i
members of Congress. They have utilised every ^
President who respected your rights, and every
court thiit dues not acknowledge tho lieurolo he
the equal of the white ma:i. They have done
everything that detestation ami disdain could
suggest. to hninble you in the e_\en of the world.
By your self-respect, hy your pride, by your
honor, then, I iikI? yon, why do you desire to
fa-ten yourselves to thin hoily of death any Ion- (
per? i)o vou sav. 'for rcvprciipp of one faUu-rM' I
legncy ; f?r (liu glory of our grent nud widely j
e?tended country : nud for tin* perpetuity of our

l>y "our fathers' legacy" tlie Constitution, they
luive denounced that wil)i baptized lips, in terms <
too profjine In be repeated. nnd tliey linvc thrown ,
ith tnttered fragments in your teeth.
Who gave your country its vast exteht ? Vir?- giuia,
n Virginian, and southern arms. How '
inucli do you own of ii ? You tried to plnnt ]
your feet upon h strip of it, and you were driiep' '
from it by arms suliffiibed for m I lie Imus^of i?
(ii'd, bv women, preacher*, professor*, nnd eltl- '
ilt-iits. And when 11 ic high captain of this new- I
funglcd commissariat turned -his bloody arms |
from the land of purchase to I ho laud of the pur- '
chaser, they gloried at the alarms he spread j 1
among women and children?did all tliey could j
to save Ins neck, placed his name in the roll of j
martyrs, nnd consecrated the day of his execution.
Mow much of ilie "glory'' of the country
do \ on share 7 Mo-t. of it belongs to you nnd i
your sir< s by riehts, hut yon {jet none of it. All
tliut the world knows of ymt, is from the reports
of your enemies, and they debase you. If you
won in iiii nw on your servility, unci n^iime a |
national clisimeter, the world would know you,
court yon, fear you. respcct you ; but you have i
clung to the rotten Union until you liuve almost
become ii stench in the nostrils of the world.?
l)o you know the true s?cret of Lincoln's overwhelming
majorities t I can tell it to you.?
Your speakers went to the North, nnd set up the
olil yell, that the Union was in danger. It nauseated
the Democrats, and inspirited the Republicans.
None of them helieved that there wan
either truth or con race in you, and the}' determined
to prove it. They meant to hold you up
to the eyes of the world as specimens of slaveholding
verity and valor.
The Dcmocra s, who had always stood by you,
knew that they would keep down the Abolitionists
if the South would prove to them, by
some unequivocal act, her determination to dissolve
the Union, or to maintain her rights. With
every threatened .aggression, they warned the
people of its danger to the Union?said it was
grossly unjust, or unconstitutional, and that the
South could not and would not submit to it. It
came, nnd the South blustered a little, and did
submit to it They (the Democrats) became

with tlic people'. Of course they waned with
every recurrence of lhe?e circiunstnncrs, until
they expired l-o risono more. They regard you
us the authors of their overthrow, and they feel
towards you accordingly. You have, then, no
friends al the North, and millions of hitter enemies.
Why do you wish to continue the conneelion
? Yuur enemies will soon have everything
their own wuy. You cannot reach tlicm
through the ballot box, or in any other way ; but
they can and will reach you with a whip of
scorpion*. You hnvo them for once under
nlurmx, (thanks be to much-abused little iSoutli
Carolina for it,) but 3-011 will never alarm thein
again. For several years to come their whole
aim will be to pluce you where you dure not
dissolve the Union. When they have you hampered
securely, then comes the long promised visitation,
with horrors unknown this side ol perdition.
Let mo not be misunderstood. I-enntinol promise
you an easy, quiet, retreat from tho Union.
This breaking up of government)! is a critical
thing; it is apt to be attended with much trouble.
Bui 1 can promise you much less trouble than
you will endure by remaining in the Union.?
Thin trouble is certain?it is foreordained. The
other is contingent. So fur us 1 can see, if the
southern Stules will move off in u body, with one
heart and one mind, there would be no trouble
at all. It would be ihe most peaceful, quiet,

A.B. LONG STREET.
IV.
A few reasons now why the South should quit
the Union, and a few answers to the arguments
ngniiitjl it, und 1 have done.
A secession of the Southern States will insure
to them domestic pence anil security.
Tliia is a oonsideruiion of infinitely more im
portance limn it is generally taken to be. Let
i t be remembered that disquiet has made its w?y
into our families, and has been increasing for
some time past, while we are in the Union, and
where it will end. if we remain in it finlrl nntu
knows. With every recurring Presidential Election
it is to be renewed, if wc take any part in
(lie contest. It is the everlasting stump speaking
in behttlf of rival candidates for Congress
and tiie Presidency, tlie indiscreet table-talk
whi*h it naturally suggests, the inflammatory
extracts /roiii northern speeches and editorials
constantly paraded in the southern press, which
bring unnsincss into our families?not the things
said and done by the (analics Afar off.
Now, oil this ends where the separation begins.
The force of this argument will be tested
at the next mcetiDg of Congress. Mark,
if you plenee, the change and tone of manner
which the rankstnnd most defiant Republicans
will assume in that body. If one anti-slavery
measure is proposed by any.of them?if one
threat, or taunt, or dare is thrown out by the
rudest, find most, rnmnanl r\f itmm oil

of the "peculiar institution"?call mono

with this topic. Here 13 a dangerous
leak stopped. But I have a better argument
than all this. It ib universally understood
among all classes here, that South Carolina
will 6ecede from the Union; and the effect upon
the slaves in this scction of the State, (I
know no^ how it is below,) is just as I said it
would be a year ogo ; and just as it has been
in all age?, (see Prof. Reynolds admirable
article in the last DelJow;) and just as it ever
will be, if" we treat our servants as God's
Word requires 119 to treat them. Seeing cockodftB
mounted everywhere, and continual parade^
they think that war is coming certainly;
and numbers of them are inquiring whether
they.will not be permitted to tight with their
matters. If not( they propose to accompany
their masters as waiting men, cooks, <Lo.
I suppose Ihe.y-Muuk Black Republicans are
negroes, (no greaOTmistake, seeing .th.'y 1?V?
each other desperately.) and thff- idea of a
parcel qf negroes coming here to fight "white
peoplo" is against all their notions of delicacy,
and common sertse ; and, having internal evidince
that thov are certain to be whipped, they
dona to take this honor off their master*
hands. Be this as it may, all iq quite here.

Mr. Ji'ditor: lit the midst of politics and
>ther exciting topics, permit a spectator to
5*ivo your readers, though imperfectly, the
niprcssions made upon liiin by tliin cxauii
tation.
Jiethel is a Meeting House, of the M. E.
ZJluircli, South, situated in about two miles of
he f-inious Lon^ Cane Creek, and five and a
iiolf of Abbeville C. II., on the cross from
LheSllakc, to the Augusta Roads, in the neighborhood
ol Messrs. .J. T. I?rooks, 1). M.
Wnrdlaw, and A. L. CJray. A neat and coin
modious School House has been erected.near
the .Meeting House. A llourisliirig Sehool has
been kept up at this place for several years
p:ist. During the last ten months it has been
presided over by Miss Jane l'ennal, who graduated
nbont two years ago, at the Masonic l"e"
male College, at Cokesbury. Miss I'ennal came
into our community with the reputation of not
only being more than ordinarily endowed, bul
that that endowment had been well cultivated
iind prepared for the responsible duties upon
which she was about to enter. How well her
conduct has verified that reputation, her patrons,
and the neighborhood generally, who at
tended this examinati .-n, woulil most abundantly
testify.
The writer happened to be there by an invitation
giveu but a few days previous to the
examination, and he will venture his reputation
for all ihht he know.*, or pretends to know, in
letters, that such un examination has not been
witnessed in Abbeville District, withiu the last
ten years. The pupils cxnmined were of both
cxcc, from the age* of about eight, to about
fifteen. [leading. Spelling, the Arithmetic,
History, Geography, Composition, Declamation,
and English Grammar, were the subjects exhibited,
and examined upon ; and a proficiency
in nil them was presented from the youngest
to the oldest such as the writer, although he has
attended many an examination both at the
l'riinary and higer Schools, or Colleges, never
witnessed before. What struck the writer us
peculiarly remarkable in this examination was
M iss Pennnl. in advance of nineteen out of
twenty now engaged in this important business,
Rectus to have comprehended her true mission
ns teacher?which was simply to nid in the
development and discipline of the intellectual
faculties; leaving the storing of the mind with

iii.uviiiita x ui luiuiu vuuugut, lor uu uitfjr
period.
Considering the unpleasantness of the day,
a very gratifying number, independent of pal.
rons, were present, and all were evidently delighted.
At llie close of the examination exercises
Mnjnr II. A. Jonesr who was present, was
called upon for some icinarks, to which he
responded i'i a speech of ahout twenty minutes'
length ; in which, whilst he expressed his great
gratification at the examination he had witnessed,
and congratulated that community upon
their good forluue in having secured the services
of so competent a Teacher, he dwelt- upon
the importance, or rather necessity, of education,
in general, and urged upon parents their
duty, in particular, in this regard, us taking
prcccdcnco of all other matters that could engage
their attention, and stated, briefly, how,
in his judgment, this most important object
might be most efficiently accomplished.
Dr. A. Paul, and A. L. Gray, Esq., were
ftlno called upon, and made appropriate remarks.
We arc informed that Ihe services of Miss
l'cnnat are engaged for another year. This is a
pleasant community, and healthy; a.id parents
and Guardians having children, or wards tliey
desire to be educated, would do well to take
advantage of this opportunity.
It is very gratifying, to the writer at least,
that Miss I'eunal, who has thus undertaken the
responsible position of guide to the growing
iutellect, was born and educated in our own
District. No Yankee here. So, parents need
have no fears as '.o the morals of their children.

very significant parogrnyji, showing

in the British Indian possesions, the attempt
has been at length abandoned as hope
