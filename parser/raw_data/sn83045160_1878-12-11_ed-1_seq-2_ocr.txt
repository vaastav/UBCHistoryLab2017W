At the mettintf or the school board en
Monday night, llr. KJr inprton ottered" a re-o-luLioo
recomniendintt the reappointment of
CjlontliLeon Trousdale as State fiuper'u:
tendentof instruction, tu? position so ably
fill ed by him for tha past two years. Thlt
resolution was unanimously passed, and will
le inoet cordially indorsed by the people i
idemphin, where Colonel Trousdale once r -ided,
and where ho in universally estccinn!.
The people of Memphis, of Shelby, of
Tecntsee.and we may say of the entire State,
with lingular unanimity, favor the retention
yf Colonel Trousdale in the place he hia
filled to satieratcrily. The Callatin Exam
iiier lays:
The teacher tralit at.: for this conre.ional
Oi-Utrt has bt-ca in se.-sion at the courthouse
eince Wednesday lust. It is, oi course, un
der the immedinte direction of Colonel Irm
'i'rousdide, the Slate supTinUnilent of public
inttfruction, and this a fit occasion to ail ule
to the great work that has bw n accomplished
by Colouel Trousdale during his term ct" rer
Ttoe. Ho bas awakenel a general public in
terest in the cause of education, without
which it could not be eupported by populnr
approval. He has ortraniz"d and set iu mo
tion in every district of the State educational
institutes, whose clject is keep alive the sup
port of improvement and public sentiment.
Without these powerful efforts of Colonel
Trousdale we have no doubt that the school
sysfra of IVnnessee would have been a sig
nal failure. We hope tna tJovernor Maiki
will reappoint lam. Doubtless there are
ruauy other pewous in the State fully compe
tent to the woik, but they nre untried.
olonel Troupdalt has bea tried and is not
lound wanting. He has been weighed in the
scales and proves a success. This id bo
time now for swapping horses. Let well
enough alone. If Governor Marks desires
his administration to be a success he must
1-nv" tried and competent men about hiui tor
ft-- work. New men will have to learn their
work.
j-uch seems to be the general voice of the
oople ot tho Slate. Certainly Shelby counly
is solid in favoring tho appcintmeut ot
Trousdale. Ho bas every qualification for
tlie position, a Lai been demonstrated by
his sacccB3 as State superintendent, and he is
loved throughout the State on account of his
fidelity to friends and principle; his frank
ness and truthfulness in all things; his
amiability and aversion for causeless corflict;
hi prudence of speech and action, end his
faultless sense of justice and knightly co ir
tesy. Sudt a man is Leon Trousdale, and he
nhculd hi retained in the place he adjrns
with 1 h f'.iolurly attainments and preut per
sonal popularity.
RADICAL I.VT1MIOATIO.V,
Ten yea i-j ago, a negro in the southern
states voted the Democratic ticket at the
peril of his life. Tho whites were disfran
chised, and if a colored voter intimated a
dicpositiJa to tio justice to the whites, by
Toting for their enfranchisement, ha was set
upon by the black mob and kicked and
ab ibed like a dog. There ore several col
ored men here ia Memphis who bear upon
their persons marks of violence, inflicted be
cause thpy were guilty of the crime of votiug
tho Democratic tich'-t. Before (he southern
people were enfranchised and given home
rule, a colored Democrat wa3 ostracised by his
race, and if ho voted lfu honest convictions,
kicks acd cuffs were the penalty. This practice
has njt bien entirely abandoned. We see
it stated tht at Society Hill, South Carolina,
at the last election a colored man br the
name of Granville Tool, who voted with
tho Democrat November Mb, has been
deposed from his place as a dea
con in a colored liaptibt church for his
offense. A colored preacher named Kpps,
who refused to voto with the Republicans,
bas been ordered out of the pulpit and told
that he must confers to having corcmilted a
sin and must beg forgiveness of the church
before being rdlowcd to preach again. At
Murfreesboro', North Carolina, a negro who
voted the Democratic ticket was terribly
beaten by his colored neighbors, and many
others have been turned outof theirchurche?.
All these are well-authenticated cases end it
would be well for candid Republicans
throughout tho north to consider them before
falling into line with the virulent Republican
press in abusing the southern Democracy for
alleged wrong-doings. If there have been
instances of bulldcz'n? oa thclpart of the Red
'Shirts ot South Carolina and Louisiana,
it is only evident that the Republi
cs in those States have been guil
ty of the same offense, and the score
is therefore even. Of course we do not for a
moment sympatliizj with any such lawless
methods of carrying elections. We believe
in every voter being untratumcled and secure
in his constitutional right to vote according
to the dictates cf his own conscience. But
when the northern Republicans take up ru
mors of a few isolated caes of election frauds
on the part of ii responsible Democrats ia the
back districts; and when a Republican Presi
dent gives space and credence t3 these ru
mors in his annual message to congress, it is
about lime for Democrats to bein showing
np the other side of the story, and placing a
fair share of the responsibility for these south
ern "outrages'' where it rightfully belongs
upon the shoulders of the Republican patty,
JAl'RSOV HIBKSAV
Every town aftlioted by yellow-fever pre
sents a hero. Friars Feint, Mississippi,
furnishes one in the person of Jackson Kirk
man, the editor of tho Coahomian. Mr.
Kirkman is a bachelor, had but lew ties to
bind hiui to the community, but, loving bu
inanity more than himself, ho breasted the
storm of death in taking care of the sick and
burying the dead. A9 an evidence of the
"unbounded admiration, respect and esteem'
which the people of Friars Point entertain
for Mr. Kirkman, they held a public meeting
a few nights since uud presented him with
an elegant watch tnd chain. Mr. Dun
Scott, sou of Chancellor Scott, who lived
and died in tbij city, was selected as the
speaker for the occasion. His eulogy tTpon
Mr. Kirkman was as beautiful and eloquent
as it was appropriate and deserving. We
make tho following extract from Mr. Kirk-
man's reply.
Gentlemen and friends, it is altoetL.t r un
necesiary that I should attempt to (xpreos
me artection inspired in my Heart I y tuis
manitestation of your regard, lint, ar as
is the thought ot your approval of my con
duct, flattering as is this demonstration of
your affection, dearer, unmeahurably i!i arer,
is the knowledge that, in some dejvje, I
may have lessened the sting of dw.fli lor
friends, and the assurance that my presence
and eilorts were a consolation to diNiiessed
survivors. 1 do not wish to revive hi r, to
night, a vivid picture of tho sad scei.es it
was my fate to witnesa. but will merely
mention that from each and every one of our I
noble dead, in whose funeral rites I assisted,
with the exception of our lamented Judge
Rucki, who died a tow moments before I
reached him, and the sweet lady. Mrs.
George Alcorn, whom 1 did not sea living in
sickness I ay from each and every one of
our nt.ble dea l, wi'h these expptiocs, I had
expressions of love and appreciation that will
nnir sweetly in the ear of my memory as
irng m that lacuity is preserved. uenue
uii'u, I a.cfpt our t ntimonial, and hall re-L-ard
it. like that from mv doar ladv friends.
as my most valuable property. Millions of
money could not buy it, nor would 1 utr..-u-der
it to force mere willingly than I
would my own heat's blood. And yet, I
must con'.. I was oppressed with a feeling
cf un worthiness while listening to the
clcqn-nt and beautiful compliment of my
intiuiata and calttmed friend, Mr. IUn
Scott, whoji you have selected to repiei-ent
yru in jour 'x'n-nie goodness and favor.
(' iiti'-mtn, I trunt Ibis beautiful watch, tn-
iianced a it is by the love I bear you, may
he uext my heart and bt at in consonunce with
it, hk'i tautl! ;d drjms, silent marches to an
aed grave, but that it shall never indicate
the lime when I shall be guilty of a dishon
orable action, or forgetlul of your loving
kindness.
Alter the delivery of his speech Mr. Kirk-
man was overwhelmed with the congratula
tions ot his friends, who crowded around
him to xpress their gratitude. The heroism
which Mr. Kirk man displayed during the ep
idemic fully illustrates what is often said,
and which we can only repeat in substance,
that "the bravest are the loving, the tender
et ore the daring." At the last Methodist
conference Kirkman took the premium for
being the biggest sinner in the State. But
in the hour of gloom, when death was hold
ing high carnival, and when the pious saints
fled from danger, the glorious heart and
chivulric soul of Jackson Kirkman loomed
up in sublime grandeur. Mr. Kirkman "was
born with a silver SDOon in hw mouth." He
belongs to one of tho oldest, most respects
ble and aristocratic families of North Ala
bam a. We have known him since he -ore
bareleet, and rejoice to know that if time
has dnalt harshly with him, and misfortunes
have swept from him the opulence of other
days, he is still rich in the powession of a
bes.rt that throbs for the woes of others.
PROSPERITY AXI COSKIUKSCE.
A gratifying thing about the present pros
perity of Memphis is that it does not come
only from what we sell, but from what we
save. We used to buy all ouj: corn, oats and
hnv from tha west, now a good portion of
these necessaries is grown in the country
around u. We grind a large portion of the
cornmeal we consume, we make a great part
of the boies tnd barrels our merchants use
in nackinir. we have units a ronsiderable
thaie cf the butter, eggs, potatoes, poultry
bogs, onions, beans, cabbages, cucumberp,
fruit and lettuce, peas, peaches and strawber
rits we rcGoit-e, produced in the country
around a?. Not only so, but a are eendicg
every spring immense quantities of vegeta
bles, poultry, eggs, butter, peaches, apples,
pluius, potatoes, and very many other things,
to the north, a or pearly all these things we
used to be dependent on tiii north, and now
we are commonly exporting in the siting
to places where we used to buy all through
the fpricir and the winter. So we go,
every year raising more products that
we can send north while there 2 demand
for early garden-stuff, and what the north
does not want re consume at home, instead
of sending away cash w bay it. Memphis
par-tlz-id! Memphis has within iiwaolt,
within the country around her, within the
commercia.1 ta&iiitiee her position gives her,
resources that defy tuUfoi-tuii tsure prog
ress, and make wealth and prosperity every
year more certain and more rich than the
year before. Memphis believes in going
ahead, and she acts on lief creed. The New
Ycrk Herald, of Saturday, was very correct
when it said: "The south is rising more per
ceptibly out of the universal depression than
foe north. In spite of the hard times, which
have weighed like an incubus on all the in
dustries of the country, the southern people,
colcred as well ai whites, tiava bee.n ail
vauciag in well-being, ia comtort, and they
are covji'h'ttt of a prosperous future."
With yelow-ffcver added to hard times,
Memphis i;a &U that confidence, and with
gOOj M&30C.
Tbk State debt of Tennessee is the largest
of all the southern Stake, with the exception ot
that of V.rginirt, which with accrued interest
amounts to something like fifty millions ot
dolLai'H. In speaking of the Virginia debt
the Philadelphia Press says: "It was con
tracted before the war, and no portion of it
can be charged to the much-abused 'carpet
bagger, for at the period these obligations
were incurred, none but native-born Vir
ginians, sciots of the first families, were per
mitted to sit in her legislative councils. The
bonds were iosued for the benefit of various
woiks of internal improvement, and the
corporations becoming bankrupt, were neither
able to repay the loan nor to meet the in
terest thereon." It is not true that all of this
debt was contracted before the war. Much
of it was incurred while Virginia was nnder
the iron heel of despotism, and the State
rnled by adventurers. Even if the whole
debt was contracted before the war, that
lessens the obligation for paying it, as tho
guaranteed property in slaves was abolished
and the people of Virginia were losers ot
millions of dollars, and thereby deprived ot
the facilities for paying.
TiiAMrs for want of the means of getting a
living, and million? of acres unproductive for
want of occupants, is one of the strange
phenomena to be found in the United
States. In the Netherlands persons able to
work, but found begging, are sent to a
government farm and made of use; is such a
sensible proceeding impossible with us? We
should not punish a man because be has not
got work, but find him work and make him
do it. Ia that way many individuals who
have never been taught how to make a living,
would acquire that valuable accomplishment;
many who are "botches" at what they have
learned would become excellent laborers at
the plow, in the harvest field, and among
sheep and cattle. Tho proper way to deal
with tramps, and to help all who want vrork
and cannot get it, is to find them work on
our unfilled acres and have them do it.
Thb New Orleans Times pleads for a full
celebration of the carnival when next Mardi-
Ura.i arrives, and asserts that those who op
pose it were trie runners-away Irom the epi
demic; adding: "Why should not the C res
cent City throw off the yoke of sadness
which has been forced upon her, and re as
sume tho olden and gladdening mantle of
festival?" and concludes, "Le Hoi jaune est
mort! Virele Roidu Carnival!" We dear
ly love the Mardi-Graa celebration in Mem
puis, ouc our nearts are too heavy and our
sorrowing memories too busy to observe it this
year. The :sew Orleans Picayune, we ob
serve, also favors the celebration as an incen
tive to business. It says: "The carnival fes
tivities being our greatest attraction to our
customers in adjacent cities and States, and
to strangers from the north and west, it is
not only wise to give them, but extra exer
tions should be luada."
l ue jjeinoaisi L,nrtsitan Advocate sees in
the willingness of some of the Episcopal
ministers to condemn the conduct by which
their church drove Wesley's followers out of
it, a desire to win the Methodists back to the
old fold. The Advocate pithily says : ' 'Where
would our friends of the Protestant Episcopal
church put us? Once in their fold, we would
outnumber them, outvote them, change their
canons right and left; in short, wholly de
stroy their identity,"
Is California, instead of selling grain by
the bushel, they sell it by the cental that is,
by the one hundred pounds. The trade
committee of the Mew York produce ex
change has been called upon to introduce the
cental. Cincinnati and St. Louis adopted
the cental several years ago, but did nt
succeed in carrying it out. It is a much-
required improvement.
A tOMMt-'NiriT paper, remarking upon the
injustice of the rich toward the poor, give?,
as an instance, that fact that while thousands
of the ill-ussd, starving poor die every month,
there is hardly one king dies in a year. That
does seem unjust; how is it to be accounted
for?

Nashville Banner. 6th: Having learned
that the senator-elect from this county, Hon.
Clay Roberts, was engnged in preparing
quite a number of bills to be presented for
... . i ia. j:
parage to the next general assemuiy lenuing
to a reduction ot the current expenses cf the
State government, and amendments to the
criminal laws ly which a large amount ot
costs will be saved to the Staty, we called on
that gentleman yesterday and were shown
the following bills:
To reduce tha compensation of the judges
of tha supreme court Irom four to three
thousand dollars Der annum.
1 o reduce the compensation oi the circuit
judges and chancellor from twenty-hve nun-
Ureii to eighteen hundred dollars per annum.
To repeal the law allowing the adjutant-
general of the State a salary of eighteen
hundred dollars per annum.
To repeal the law allowing the comptroller
a clerk at the expense of the State on a salary
of twelve hundred dollars per annum.
To repeal the law allowing the secretary
of state a salary of twelve hundred dollars
per annum.
To repeal theliw authorizing the appoint
ment of a superintendent of the penitentiary
at a salary of twenty-five hundred dollars
per annum, and requiring the warden of the
penitentiary to perform the duties now lm
posed by law on the superintendent without
Additional compensation.
To repeal the law creating a bureau of
noriculturo. statistics and mines, which is
now costing the State twelve thousand two
hundred dollars per annum.
To repeal the law allowing the State geol
ogist a salary of one hundred dollars per an
num.
To reduce the compensation of the supenn
tendent of the Capitol from fifteen hundred
dollars to six hundred dollars per annum,
To reduce the compensation of the State
librarian f rom one thousand to six hundred
dollars per annum.
To reduce the compensation of the superin
tendent of public instruction from three
thousand to eighteen hundred dollars per
annum.
To eaualize and regulate the salaries of
certain public officers. The bill provides that
no clerk of the supreme court, clerk and mas
ter of the chancery court: clerk of the crimi
nal court, clerk of the county court, collector
of revenue, district attorney-general, treasu
rer, secretary of state or comptroller, shall
receive, directly or indirectly, irom the lees,
emoluments or perquisites of his office, nor as
trustee, commissioner, trustee or receiver, or
from anv position or place ot trust, or em
ployment to which he may be appointed by
any court or judge, any sum greater than
two thousand dollars er pnnum, and requires
all the officers enumerated to uako -nder
oath and file with the comptroller, on the
first Monday in January and July of each
year, a true exnioit or an fees received oy
them for the previous half year, and pay over
to theconiptroller.lit aState officer, and to the
county trustee, if a county officer, any amount
in excess ot two mousana aoijars, iao ui.i
then provides that the judges of the various
courts may authorize the clerks to employ as
many deputies as are absolutely necessary to
pertoiu. :e Unties ot tne omce, ar a salary or
not exceeding liltv doil&rc rer month each.
A bill civin? circuit and criminal judges
discretionary power whether they will hold

clerks have taken insufficient securities.
A liii requiring parties imprisoned, while
waiting for trial, id co to tiio ponty v;ork-
house in place or the. au.
A bill prohibiting appeals to the supreme
court in manvcases where now allowed.
Mr.' jtobeiLa ptorrrsus that the amount to
which he desired to reatuue iue salaries ot the
governor, the judges of the supreme' court,
and the circuit judges and chancellors, are
the same that were paid them in 1861, at the
breaking out of the f -r, find as the cost of
living and of transportation va never u'ueiip
er than it is at present, he is satisfied that alt
salaries should be reduced accordingly. He
say3 that until within a few years back nei
ther the governor, the comptroller nor the
secretary of state were allowed clerks at the
expense of the State; that the duties oi these
officers are nofc aiore onerous than they were
before 1372, and if they desue to hae forae
coo to do their work for them it is but just
and proper that fcey should bear the expense
out of their own pockets.
Tbs superintendent of the Capitol now
dravs Salary of fifteen hundred dollars per
annum, white tii.ea fjre tnndreds of young
men in the State worthy"i8d poaipetept po
fill the place at lea than half that afaount.
In support of his bill to abolish the office of
agriculture, statistics and mines, Mr. Roberts
informs us that he fully appreciates the value
of immigration, and that if Tennessee was
out of debt be would go as ikf- as the farthest
to encourage immigration; but an the State i2
now unable to pay what she owes, he is not
willing to spend twelve thousand two hun
dred dollars per annum for this department.
He has, by way of amendments to the crim
inal code, proposed a bill giving magistrates
jurisdiction to dispose pf many small offenses
that now go to the circuit and ciujici! courts.
Mr. Roberts has also prepared a bill with
much care, e&t;Ued "An act to regulate as
signments for the benefit of creditore." It
prescribes, in substance, that every bSoin
ment made by any debtor for the benefit of
creditors shall provide for a proportionate
distribution of all his personal and real etalo,
except what is exempt by law from execution
and attachment, among all his creditors in
proportion to the amount of their respective
claims.
Without cowtiiiUinsr ourselves to the sup
port ot all these measures, wa present them
to our readers, acd particularly to the mem'
hers of the general assembly, as matters that
will be up tor consideration when the legisla
ture meets. he panner has been alive to
the importance of economy and retrenchment
in the management of State afiairs, and will
at all times be found in advocacy of measures
tending in that direction. It may be that
soma of the bills in question go a little too
far, but in every case where legitimate re
forms can be affected and unnecessary ex pen
ses cut down, the Banner will be found on
the sida of economy and reform.

VVashington Post: The Preaident and his
wife will receive all calls and return none.
During the session cf congress stated re'
eeptions are given, which all may attend. A
morning reception should be attended in the
usual morning reception costume, hut it is
not considered respectful to appear in less
than evening toilet at an evening reception,
and for an evening call merely demi-toilette
is preferable. When entering, your name is
announced by the usher, whereupon the
marshal of the district introduces you to the
President, and afterward to other members
of the family who may be present. It is a
vexed question as to whom properly belongs
the second place in tha scpial grade the
chief-justice or the Vice-President. Much
may be eaid on both sides. The significance
ot our social etiquette is not personal, but
political, and it simply resolves itself to the
Question, which is of mora political import
ance, the chief-justice or the Vice-President?
the hrst named is certainly, in some respects,
much more responsible and dignified. He
holds the ultimate power of appeal: he can,
st times, control the executive, and, holding
his omce for Ins. he is a hxed star in the na'
tional firmament. The Vice-President,
: I 1 " T J L 1 ' I
Bimpiy as ice-i reaiuem, nas no spwiai po
liticU significance. His greatness is antici
patory rather thin actual, consisting in the
remote contingency of his becoming Presi
dent, and the dignity ot his position arises
from his being president of the United States
senate. A social congress should be called to
settle these weighty matters of the law, and
until that is done the dilemma may be met
as a distinguished Washington lady meets it
by not inviting these two dignitaries to her
table at the same time. 1 be fourth planet in
our social system is the Bpeaker of the house,
who is three removes from the Presidency,
and is often a political power of the first im
portance. All these dignitaries are entitled
to the first visit. In regara io the cabinet,
great confusion of opinion prevails
a to the question ot social precedence,
and though it is a question which needs
be settled only on occasion of State
dinners or official receptions, the Post would
not be fulfilling the whole duty ot man utr
less it stated the case t'uiiy. The order to be
observed is the priority in which tho offices
were created, yiz: The state, the treasury,
the war, the navy, the general postofbxe, the
interior and the department of justice. The
difference of opinion as to who should receive
the first visit, the cabinet officer or the sena
tor, is gradually being decided in favor of the
senator. The "first visit" seems to have
been an apple of discord at a very early date,
it is ot th's that Mr. Adams's letter, before
referred to, chiey treats, and he quotes
voluminously from "Mrs. Auass." what she
did and did not do. After all it is the wo
men who watch the social boundaries, and
carry on in Washington parlors the wars of
the political arena. iFor this senatorial claim
to precedence is based on the argument that
the senator represents State sovereignty,
while the cabinet officer is simply ap
pointed and depends on the confirmation of
the senate. Still, the senator is also
subject to tho State legislature, and so of
course and yet, such K the dignity and re
sponsibility of a cabinet officer that well,
tho massive brain of the Post reels under
una a veightof argument, and can oily fee
bly suggest thalotuciai aimng-tabies be made
like that celebrated table in John O Groat's
house, where eight jealous brothers of the '
bouse oi O Uroat tat down, each one at lb
head of the octagon table. The ladies of the
cabinet probably work harder through the
season than any one else in Washington.
The demands upon their time and strength
are enormous, and it must require a good
deal of muscular Christianity to go through
the crush ot a "card reception in the night
of the season.

Tbe Opinions of lta Xewsjpapera.
Panola (Miss.) Star: "A stranger who
bad never heard of the late terrible epidemic
would not suppose, on visiting Memphis now,
tbat it had done any damage to the business
there at all. The numerous people he would
meet clad in the habiliments of sorrow might
give an idea ot the sad reality, but the activ
ity on the streets and in the stores would
c luse him to regard Memphis as she is the
Uueen City of the southwest. Here and there
a gloomy, despondent merchant may be
found, it is true, but these are exceptions.
and such may be found anywhere and every
where. 1 he merchants generally, however,
are in good spirits, and while they are
fully aware that a substantial portion of
their legitimate and valuable trade has been
swept away by the scourge, they have sense
enough to know that the same country has
yet to be supplied to a very large extent, and
that Memphis is the natural fountain from
which the supplies are to be drawn. It would
be a sad day lor West lennessee, Worth Ala
bama and Mississippi that should witness the
downfall of Memphis, for all must sink or
rise toe-ether. In adversity or prosperity
they are inseparably cooncted. and it is the
duty and the interest of Memphis to stand by
these surrounding communities as it is their
duty and interest to stand by her. Let the
merchants ot Memphis becneertui and nope
t'ul. and thev will all be thoroughly convinced
ere long, 'There's life in the old land yet.' "
Okalona (Miss.) Times: "n our recent
visit to Memphis, we found everybody and
everything busy: goods remarkably low, and
of quick sale. Judging from the receipts to
date, Momphis will handle more cotton this
season than she has for years, and perhaps
than ever before. The population is increas
ing and the outlook is decidedly good. We
were told by several gentlemen, who were
well posted about the city, tbat the popula
tion vas decidedly larger nqw than it was
before the occurrence of tho late scourge.
Not withstanding the predictions of many.that
Memphis would never rise rgain, her exports
and imports will prove to the contrary. If a
recurrence of the yellow-fever can be pre
vented, in a few years she will become sec
ond to none along the great Mississippi."
The Ieadhea4 Fiend,
irom a New York programme: "Give me
three for the matinee, or two, say, for the
evening. Give them to me! oh, give them
to me!
I was passing through a corridor of the lu
natic a.yluiu on Blackwell's Island, says a
writer in Xoah's Times, when I heard the
above appeal. It came from a middle-aged
man, whose wan countenance and appealing
attitude attracted my attention and caused
me to halt.'
Seeing me, he approached, and, extending
one hand, asked in wheedling tones i
" Give me two for a matinee."
" Can't a man come to the Island for a
pleasure tour among the unfortunate without
beinsr followed by the tree-ticket iNemesise
thought I, and asked the keeper what was
the matter witu the m8-".
Vlt's a bad case," said he, "a very bad
case.'
' "What is the matter with him ?"
'.'Ite ia a' ir$ picket lunatic, resulting from
a very dangerous and increasing maiauy. it,
is born of the desire to get something for
nothing.
"Do you know his history?"
"Well, it acnecrs that in sorr.e evil mo
ment a man gave hicV a deadhead pass" 'to
the theater. For a time he was hnppy, and
he SDent a great deal ot time and money in
getting or trying to get free tickets. He
sctceeded. but the more he obtained the
morV be 'wanted, inti; te jjegire for fre
Beats became a mania With' him, and this
finally resulted in complete lunacy. Ab, it's
a terrible thing, ' said the keeper, as he
gazed at the poor lunatio and sjghed.
"Can't yoii get rde fdinf to-mght:'! asked
the lunatic,
I did not consider this as an evidenco of in
curable lunacy, because I had heard the re
quest so frequently made by supposed sane
people.
"No," I replied, "I cannot give you four.
but would you like three to the .National the
ater. and see the Ilavpv t'lamiluf."
lbe lunatic shuddered, his eyes rolled, and
ha 8?,id, with a sudden burst or passion, JNo,
I don't."' r
I remarked to the keeper that I did not be'
lieve this man was so utterly incurable as he
had sun posed.
I left tha H-ene nd the lunatic, who was
amusing himself with little pieces of cards,
the corners of which wei a cut off. What a
terrible lesson there is in this case. What a
caution to the great army of bores and
"ticket-fiends." They had driven a great
many people unto lap verge Qf lunacy by
their persistency and cheek in search ot free
passes and tickets, but I did not imagine that
they were so constituted aB to suiter them
selves. This is not only a caution to the so-
called ticket-fiends, but to managers who
cater to the crowd.
SI Oder n Conveniences.
Baltimore Sun ; f'At a jneeting of scient
ists held in London some three weeks ago a
ptper yas read on the subject of neglect in
sanitary matters.'' After dPspribuig tha now
well recognised rules which must be' conir
Elied with to insure the sanitary safety of a
ouse such as trapping drains ' and cutting
off direct communication between them and
the cisterns, sinks, overflow from baths, etc.
and the serious danger arising from neg
lect in these particularf.it was suggested that
he duty should be devolved upon health
departments of eaapip; the condition of
houses having what is termed ''modern con
veniences," and tbat every house-holder be
fore taking a house should require from the
owapr a certificate from the health authori
ties as to ipa sanitary sufficiency. If such
suggestion could be carried in practice there
can be no doubt that ' it would lead to more
skilful plumbing, and would tend very ma
terially to lessen the number or cai.es of dip
theria in families, as well as of zymotic dis
eases generally on this side of the Atlantic.
The New York board of health is clothed
with power to enforce the correction of bad
plumbing whpn ii. ia hov7n that the escape
of sewer gas has caused sickness ift the
house; but the board has no right to enter a
house before a tenant occupies it. The pow
ers cf the Baltimore board of health are
more limited, yet it is obvious that the true
policy ot eglslators. whether atate or mu
hicipal, is to grant j.o boards ot health the
largest ireeuum oi action cumpauoie Willi
the rights of others, where thpy have to deal
with preventable diseases,''
How irortnnes are Lost and Won.
A Colorado mine operator and a ranchman
discovered a large deposit of carbonate of
lead and zinc blend near the south Arkansas
river, about seventy miles south of Lead
ville. A dipp-te arose between them, and
the ranchman agreed to sell out tq his part
ner for six thousand five hundred dollars, it
the whole amount of money was paid within
eight months. The mine operator actually
stinted himself and family the common nec
essaries of life to get the money, and paid
four thousand out of the six thousand five
hundred dollars, but having a large number of
unpatented mines to work out the annual as
sessment required by law, could not meet the
last payment in time. He went to St. Louis,
and tried for three months to raise the money
by ottering ope-half the mine to any good
business man that would join him and pay
the 6ix thousand five hundred dollars that the
entire share, when fully paid up, would cost,
but failed to raise the money, On his return
to Colorado, his ranchman-partner coolly
told him that his time was np, and it would
just take about one hundred thousand dollars
to get his share in the mine. During the
miner's absence in St. Louis, the ranchman
had worked a few feet into the mine, and
uncovered as great a deposit of carbonates of
lead with silver as has yet been discovered.
These gentlemen now hold their property at
the snug little sum of five hundred thousand
dollars.

"Tiint l Certain! V for Me,"
A row incurred in a leading Chicago thea
ter the other day. This is the explanation
given by one ot the afternoon papers: "Dur
ing the third act, Mr. L?arock, who plays the
part of 'Elliot Gray,' so acquitted himself
as to be called before the curtain by the
plaudits of the enthusiast if a"d;eco. In
answer to ibis call he appeared, and, with
his hand upon'his breast, jrade a vr-rv grace
ful salaam. In the fourth act Mr. L-oarock
again so acquitted himself as to draw from
hie admirer' a manifestation of their warm
approbation. Just ' as Mr. Learock was
stumbling over the stage furniture and dodg
ing between the scenes to answer the c&Ui he
claims t'pat Mr. Siiai g, the manager, rang
the curtain ud on the last act, thus cheating
him of his anticipated ovation." The Tribune
says; " call before the curtain is more to
a 'rising young actor' than a thousand dol
lars. To 'take the cuttain' is the proud
est momept of his life, To be defrauded
of that extulsita priviie&e liy an en
vious manager, afraid tbat his actors will
put on airs over it, is worse than throwir g
him into a well. Mr. Learock suffered this
ignominy. We all know that beautiful scene
in the gypsy camp, and the tableau which
follows the recovery of tha 6tolen child by
'Elliot Gray.' The audicnco clap their hands
and stamp their feet as the curtain falls upon
it, and the curtain rolls up again, and again
the audience stamp and clap. If there
ghould be o;ie or two e;tra stamps, the prin
cipal figure in the. scene the hero says:
'That is certainly for me,' and he 'takes the
curtain.' Something of this kind happened
several nights, ad the tage manager and
the leading man failed to agree as to what
the audience meant. Some expressions ot a
mutual affection ensued, which resulted in
the temporary withdrawal of the 'Elliot
Gray' and the substitution of another actor
in his place , The whole matter was subse
quently disposed of by auiicablo settlement."
