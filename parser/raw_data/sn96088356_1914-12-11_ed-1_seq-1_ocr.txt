PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE TO
FINAL SESSION OF 63RD CONGRESS
Washington, D. C President Wil
son's message, delivered to congress
Tuesday, is as follows:
Gentlemen of the CongreBi: The aeislon
upon which you are now entering will be
the closln? session of the (Wd Congress, a
Congress. I venture to say, which will
long be remembered for the great body
of thoughtful and constructive work which
It hag done, in loyal response to the
thought and needs of the country. I should
like tn this address to review the notable
reoord and trv to make adequate assess
ment of it. but no doubt we stand too
near the work that has been done and are
ourselves too much part of it to play the
part of historians toward It.
Moreover, our thoughts are now more of
the future than of the past. While we
have worked at our tasks of peace, the
circumstances of the whole age have been
altered by war, t
New Task! Are Faced,
What we have done for our own land
and for our own people we did with the
best that was in us, whether of character
or of intelligence, with sober enthusiasm
and a confidence In the principles upon
which we were acting which sustained us
at every step of the difficult undertaking,
but It Is done. It has passed from our
hands. It is now an established part of
the legislation of the country. Its useful
ness. Its effects, will disclose themselves In
experience.
What chieflv strikes us now, as we look
about us during these closing days of a
year which will be forever memorable in
. the history of the world, is that we face
new tasks, have been facing them these
six months, must face them in the months
to come follew them without partisan
feeling, like men who have forgotten every,
thing but a common duty and the fact
that wb are representatives of a great
people whoBe thought-is not of us but of
what America owes to herself and to all
mankind in such circumstances as these
upon which we look amazed and anxious,
Europe Will Need Our Help.
Wsr has Interrupted the means of trade
not onlv but also the process of produc
tion. In Kuroue It is destroying men and
resources wholesale and upon a scale un
precedented and appalling. There la rea
son to fear that the time Is near, if It
be not already at hand, when several of the
countries of Europe will find it difficult to
, do for their people what they have hitherto
been always easily able to do many eBBen
tlal and fundamental things. ' At any rate,
they will need our help and our manifold
services as they have never needed them
before, and we should be ready, more fit and
ready than we have ever been.
It ts of equal consequence that the Na
tions -whom Europe has usually supplied
with innumerable articles of manufacture
and commerce, of Which they are in con
stant need and without which their economic
development halts and stands still, can
1; now get only a small part of what they for-
merly imported and eagerly look to us to
supply their all but empty markets.
New Markets Must Be Supplied.
This is particularly true of our own neigh
bors, the states, great and small, of Cen
tral and South' America. Their lines of
trade have hitherto run chiefly athwart
the seas, not to our ports, but to the ports
of Great Britain and of the older con
tinent of Europe. I do not stop to Inquire
why, or to make any comment on probable
causes. What Interests us just now Is not
the explanation, but the fact and our duty
and opportunity tn the presence of it. Here
are markets which we must supply and
for which we must find the means of action.
The United States, this great people for
whom we speak and act. should be ready,
as never before to serve Itself and serve
mankind: ready with Its resources, its
energies. Its forces of production, and Its
means of distribution.
It ts a practical matter, a matter of ways
and means. We have the resources, but
are we fully ready to use them? And If
we can make ready what we have, have we
the means at hand to distribute It? We
are never fully ready; neither have we the
means of distribution. We are willing, but
we are not fully able. We have the wish
to serve and to serve greatly, generously;
bat we are not prepared as we should be.
We are not ready to mobilise our resources
at once. We are not prepared to use them
Immediately and at their best, without de
lay and without waste.
Errors Moat Be Corrected.
To apeak plainly, we have grossly erred
In tha way in which we have stunted and
hindered the development of our merchant
marine. And now, when we need ships, we
have not got them. We have year after
year debated, without end or conclusion,
tha best policy to pursue with regard to
the use of the ores and forests and water
powers of our National domain In the rich
atatea of the West, when we should have
acted; and they are still locked up. The
key Is Still turned upon them, the door shut
fast at wmch thousands of vigorous men,
full nf Initiative, knock clamorously for ad
mittance. The waterpower of our navigable
trtftin outside the National domain aiso,
even In the Eastern Mates, where we have
worked and planned for generations, is still
not used as It might be, because we will
. and we won't; because the laws we have
made do not intelligently balance encour
agement against restraint. We withhold by
rnnilntlnii.
I have come to ask you to remedy and
correct these mistakes and omissions, even
at this short session of a Congres which
would certainly seem to have done all the
work that could reasonably be expected of
It. The time and the circumstances are
extraordinary, and so must our efforts be
also. i
Unlocking: of Resource Urged.
Fortunately, two great measures, finely
conceived, the one to unlock, with proper
' safeguards, the resources of the National
domain, the other to encourage the use of
the navigable waters outside that domain
for generation of power, have already
passed the House of Representative and
are readv for Immediate consideration and
action by the Senate. With the deepest
; earnestness I urge their prompt passage. In
them both we turn our backs upon heslta.
tlon and makeshift and formulate a genu
ine policy of use and conservation, 1" the
beet sense of those word. We owe the one
measure not only to the people of that great
Western country for whose free ana sys
tematic development, as it seems to me,
our legislation has done so little, but also
to the people of the nation as a wnote; ana
we as clearly owe the other In fulfillment
. of our repeated promises that the water
power of the country should in fact as well
as In name be put at the disposal of great
Industries which can make economical and
profitable use of It, the rights of the public
being adequately guarded the while, and
monopoly in the use prevented.
To have begun such measures and not
completed them would Indeed- mar the rec
ord of this great Congress very seriously. J
hope and confidently believe that they will
oe completed.
And there la another great piece of legis
lation which awaits and should receive the
sanction of the Senate. I mean tha bill
which alvea a larger measure of self-gov
ernment to the people of the Philippines.
How better. In this time of anxious
questioning and nerplexed policy, could we
show our confidence In the principles of lib
erty, as the source as well as the expres
sion of lifer How better could we demon'
strata our own self-possession and stead
fastness in the courses of Justice and dis
interestedness than by thus going calmly
forward to fulfill our promises to a depend
ent people, who will now look more anx
iously than ever to aee whether we have
Indeed the liberality, the unselfishness, the
courage, the faith we nave boasted and pro
fessed? I cannot believe that the Senate
will lei this great measure of constructive
juatlce await the action of another Con
gress. Its passage would nobly crown the
record of these two years of memorable
labor. ...
But t, think you will agree with me
that this does not complete the toll of our
duty. How are we to carry our goods to
the empty markets of which I have spoken
if we have not the ships? How are we to
build up a great trade If we have not the
certain and constant means of transporta
tion upon which all profitable and useful
-ommerce depends? And how are we to
get the ships if we wait for the trade to
develoo without them?
Flag Must Be Restored to Seas.
To correct the many mistakes by which
we have discouraged and all but destroyed
.he merchant marine1 of the country, to
retrace the steps by which we have. It
seems almost deliberately, withdrawn our
flag from the sea's, except where, here and
there, a shin of war Is bidden carry It or
some wandering yauat displays It, would
take a long time and Involve many detailed
Items of legislation, and the trade which
we ought Immediately to handle would dis
appear or find other channels while we de
bated the Items. . .
The case is not unlike that which con
fronted us when our own continent was to
opened up to settlement and Industry
and we needed long Ilnee of railway, ex
tended mean of transportation prepared
beforehand, If development waa not to lag
Intolerably and wait interminably. We lav
ishly subsidised the building of tranaoon-J
uuciiaai rwuriNiAiM. we luu utvua. uyuu mm
vlth retcret now. because tha subsidies led
to many scandals of which w are ashamed;
but we know that the railroads had to be
built, and If we had It to do over again
should, of course, build them, but in
another way. Therefore I propose another
way of providing the means of transporta
tion, which must precede, not tardily fol
low, the development of our trade with our
neighbor atatea of America. It may seem
reversal of the natural order of things,
but It 1 true that the routes of trade must
be actually opened by many ship and reg
ular sailings and moderate charges before
streams of merchandise will flow freely and
prozitauiy tnrougn tnem.
Shipping Bill Imperative.
Hence the pending shipping bill discussed
. the last session, but as yet passed by
neither house. In my judgment such legis
lation Is Imperatively needed and cannot
wisely be postponed. The Government mint
open these gates of trade and open them
wide : open them befwre It 1 altogether
profitable to open them, or altogether rea
sonable to ask private capital to open tbem
venture, it la not a question or tne
Government monopolising the field. It
should take action to make it certain that
transportation at reasonable rate will be
promptly provided, even where the carriage
is not at first profitable; and then, when
the carriage has become sufflclentlty prof
itable to attract and engage private capital,
and engage It In abundance, the Govern
ment ought to withdraw, I earnestly hope
that the Congress will be of this opinion.
and that both houses will adopt thia ex
ceedingly Important bill.
Rural Credit Deferred,
The great subject of rural credit still re
mains to be dealt with, and it Is a matter
of deep regret that the difficulties of the
subject have seemed i to render It Impossible
to complete a bin for passage at this session.
But it cannot be perfected yet, and there
fore there are no other constructive meas
ure the necessity for which I will at this
time can your attention to, out I would oe
negligent of a manifest duty were I not to
call the attention of the Senate to the fact
that the proposed convention for safety at
sea, awaits Its confirmation and that the
limit fixed in the convention itself for Us
acceptance is the last day of the present
montn. Tne conierence in wmch this con'
ventlon originated was called by tha United
States: the representatives of the United
Slates played a very Influential part indeed
iraming tne provisions or tne propoaea
convention, and those provisions are in
themaelvea for tha moat part admirable.
It would hardly ba consistent with the cart
we have played In the whole matter to let
it drop and go by the board aa If forgotten
and neglected. It waa ratified in May last
by the German government and in August
by the Parliament of Great Britain, It
marks a most hopeful and decided advance
International civilisation. We should
show our earnest good faith in a great mat
ter by adding our own acceptance of it.
Coasts Should Be Charted.
There la another matter of which I must
make special mention, if I am to discharge
my conscience, lest it. should escape your
attention, it may aeem a small tning. u
affecta only a single Item of appropriation.
But many human lives and many great en
terprises nana upon it. it is tne matter
of making adequate provision for the survey
and charting of our coasts. It Is immediate
and exigent In connection with the immense
coast line of Alaska, a coast line greater
than that of the United States themselves,
though it is also important, Indeed, with
regard to the older coasts of the continent.
We cannot use our great Alaskan domain;
ships will not ply thither if those coasts and
tneir many nmoen dangers are not thor
oughly surveyed and charted, The work Is
Incomplete at almost every point. Ships and
lives have been lost In threading wnat were
supposed to oe wen-Known mam channels.
We have not provided adequate vessels or
adequate machinery for the survey and
charting, We have uaed old vaasels that
were not big enough or strong enough and
which were so nearly unseaworthy that our
Inspectors would not have allowed private
owners to senu in em 10 sea.
This is a matter which, as I have said.
seems small, but la in reality very great.
Ita Importance has only to be looked Into
to oe appreciated,
Economy Is Enjoined.
Before X close may I say a few words
upon two topics, much discussed out of
doors, upon which it is highly Important
that our judgment ahould be clear, definite
and steadfast?
One of these 1 economy In Government
expenditures. The duty of eoonomy la not
debatable. It Is manifest and Imperative.
le appropriations we pass we are
spending the money of the great people
a nose servants we are not our own. we
are trustees and responsible stewards In the
spending. The only thing debatable and
upon which we should be careful to make
our thought and purpose clear Is the kind
of economy demanded of us. I assert with
tne greet eat commence that the people or
the United States are not Jealous of the
amount their Government coats If they are
sura that they get what they need and de
sire for the outlay, that the money is being
spent for objects of which they approve
and that It la being applied with good bual
neas sense and management.
Governments grow, piecemeal, both In their
tasks and In the means by which those
tasks and In tho means by which those tasks
are to be performed, and very few govern
ments are organized, i venture to say, as wine
and experienced business men would organise
them if they had a clean sheet of paper to
write upon. Certainly the Government of
the United Statea ia not, I think that It is
generally agreed that there should
systematic reorganisation and reassembling
of its oarts so as to secure greater efficiency
ana erieet consiosraoie savin r in expense,
But the amount of money saved in that
war would, i believe, though no douht eon
alderable in Itself, running, it may be. Into
millions, be relatively small small. I man.
In nroportion to the total necessary outlays
or tne Government, it would be thorough!
worth effecting, as every saving would,
great or smalt Our duty la not altered
by the aeale of the saving.
Necessities Not Cart ailed.
My point la that tha people of the United

London The Chronicle has pub
lished a letter from Athens praising
the activity of the American ambas
sador, Henry Morgenthau, in Constan
tinople on the night of November I,
when the English colony was not al
lowed to leave the city.
. The action of the Turks caused a
pmnie among the British refugees, but
the American ambassador assured them
be would endeavor to get them away
jrext day. The refugees passed a ter
rible night of anxiety and besides the
police were harsh and brutal.
The sights be saw made Ambassador
Morgecthaa determine to make the
Turks respect his wishes. He formal
ly advised the Turkish government
that unless the British colony was al
lowed to depart he would demand his
passports and take them all as his pri
vate guests on his special train.
The Turks, the letter says, had no
desire to fight the United States as
well as the allies, so they gave in, but
took revenge by assessing the refugees

of thla Government: they wish, rather, to
enlarge them: and with every enlargement,
with the mere growth. Indeed, of the coun

Inevitable inorease of expense. The sort
of economy we ought to practice may be
effected, and oueht to be effected, by a
careful study and assessment of the taskB
be performed: and the money spent
ought to be made to yield the best possible
returns In efficiency and achievement. And,
like good stewards, we should so account
for every dollar of our appropriations as to
make It perfectly evident what it was spent
for and In what way It was spent.

It will chide ua only If we forget for whom

ards, but they ere not very difficult of ap
plication to particular oasea. . .
The other topic I shall take leave to men.
tlon goes deeper Into the principles of our
national life and policy. It is the subject
of national defense.'
It cannot be discussed without first an
swering some searching questions.' It is
said in aome quartora that we are not pre
pared zor war. wnai is meant oy oeins
prepared? Ia it meant that we are not
ready upon brief notice to put a nation
In the field, a nation of mea trained to
arms? Of course, we are not ready to do
that: and we shall never be in time of
peace so Ions- as we retain ' our present po
litical principles and Institutions. And what
It tnat it is suggested we snouta do
prepared to do? To defend ourselves against
attack? We have always found means to
do that and ahall find them whenever It
necessary, without caning our people
awav from their necessary task to render
compulsory military service in times of
peace.
Allow me tn sneak with areat plainness
and directness upon this great matter and
to avow my convictions with deep earnest
ness. I have tried to know what America
what her people think, what they are,
what thev most cherish and hold dear, I
hope that some of their finer passions are
in mv own heart some of the great con
ceptions and desires which gave birth to
this Government and which have made the
voice of this people a voice for peace and
hope and liberty among the peoples of the
world, and that, speaking my own tnougnts,
I shall, at least in part, speak theirs also,
however faintly and inadequately, upon this
vital matter.
We are at peace with all the world. No
one who sneaks counsel based on fact or
drawn from a just and eandid interpreta
tion of realities can say that there- is
reason to fear that from any quarter our
Independence or the Integrity of our ter
ritory Is threatened. Dread of the power

are not jealous of rivalry in the fields
of commerce or of any other peaoeful
achievement. We mean to live our own
live as we will: but we mean also to let
live. We are. Indeed, a true friend to all
the nations of the world,- because we
threaten none, covet the possessions of none,
desire tha overthrow of none. Our friend
ship can be accented and is accepted with
out reservation, because it Ib orrered in a
BDlrlt and for a purpose which no one
need ever auestion or suspect. Therein lies
our greatness, we are the champion of
peace and of concord. And we should be
lealous of this distinction which we have
souaht to earn. Just now we Bhould be
nartlcularlv lealous of it. because it la our
dearest present hope that tnis cnaracter
and reputation may Dresently, in God's prov
idence, bring ua an opportunity such as
has seldom been vouchsafed any nation,
the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace
In the world and reconciliation and a heal-
in i settlement of many a matter that has
cooled and interrupted the friendship of
nations. Thia la the time above all others
when we should wish and resolve to keep
our strength hv self-possession, our Influ
ence by preserving our ancient principles
of action.
From the first we have had a clear and
settled policy with regard to military estab
lishment. We never have had, and while
we retain our present principles and ideals
wa never shall have, a large standing army,

Let ua remind ourselves, therefore, of the
onlv thin we can do or will do. We must

should encourage such training and make

men will learn to value.
a tinwerfnl new we have always

should construct and when will they be

efficiency of craft of different kinds and

It change under our very eyea In these last
few months?
But I turn eway from the subject. It la
not new. Tharo ia no new need to discuss It.
We shall not alter our attitude toward it
because some amongst us are nervous and
excited. We shall easily and sensibly agree
upon a policy of defense. The question nas
not changed its aspects because the times
are not normal. Our policy will not be for
an occasion. It will be conceived as a per
manent and settled thing, which we win

State department. Secretary Bryan
had retired when the army orders be
came public, but it is known that this
action followed the exchange of tele
grams between the Federal govern
ment and Governor Hunt, of Arizona,
in which the latter described the firing
from the Mexican factions acrosB the
line as a serious menace to residents
of Arizona.
It is understood that when the tele
grams from Governor Hunt were laid
before the cabinet, the President also
directed Secretary Bryan to transmit
a warning through American consuls
to both Mexican factions fighting near
the boundary that firing into American
territory must be discontinued.
While the outcome of Buch negotia
tions as will be conducted through the
State department is awaited, the ar
tillery and cavalry of the American
army will Btand guard ready to carry
out any orders which ; may develop
from the conference with the Mexican
chiefs.
The forces of General Benjamin
Hill, loyal to -Carranza, are ranged
close to the line, while those of Gov
ernor Maytorena, supposed to be a fol
lower of General Villa, but often re
ported as independent of his authority,
constitute the attacking force.

Steel Made Many limes
Stronger by Scientist
Chicago The discovery of a revolu
tionary method of treating steel by
which it is made several times the
strength of the present product was
annuonced before the National Acad
emy of Sciences Wednesday by Pro
fessor A. A. Michelson, winner two
years ago of the Nobel prize for phys
ical research work.
Professor Michelson explained the
new steel,- which he said would revolu
tionize warfare by making fortifica
tions as well as ammunition many
time stronger than at present. The
new Bteel would advance peaceful proj
ects, he said, by permitting the erec
tion of skyscrapers to heights never yet
undertaken and the construction of
greater suspension bridges than have
heretofore been possible.

New Measure Proposed
to Protect Stock Breeders
Portland At the annual meeting of
the Oregon Cattle and Horse Raisers'
association in a local hotel Wednesday
night, a bill wag drafted which will be
presented at the coming session of the
legislature providing for more rigid
inspection of brands.
The measure provides that a brand
inspector shall be appointed and paid
by the association, and shall have full
legal authority to make arrests and
seize stolen animals or to hold animalB
suspected of having been stolen. It
will make it compulsory also for cattle
shippers to fill out a certified state
ment giving the names, ages, sex and
lawful owners of all animals shipped,
as well as the names of the consignees.
A duplicate copy of this statement
must accompany the shipment, if the

are being shipped, according to the
bill. .
The meeting was held in connection
with the livestock show, which is
being held at the Union Stockyards
this week. The Oregon Cattle and
Horse Raisers' association was organ
ized with 100 members in May, 1913,
and now has 282 members. The asso

dues of $5 and 8 cents a head for all
cattle owned by the various members.
The initiation fee is $5. According
to reports made to the secretary, S. O.

The reports further show that feed

War Tax Question Is
Raised by State Official
Salem Declaring that congress had
no right to impose a tax on state de
partments, Corporation Commissioner
Watson has notified the Pacific Tele
phone & Telegraph company that he
would not pay a war tax of one cent
on each long-distance telephone call of
his department. The local agent noti
fied Mr. Watson and the heads of other
departments that they would be ex
pected to pay the telephone tax.
"The telephone tax will not amount
to much," aaid Mr. Watson, "but I
am confident none of the war tax can
be collected from departments of the
state. Numerous decisions of the
higher courts have said that congress
has no right to levy such a tax against
state departments. It would mean a
great deal of money to the state if it
were compelled to provide all Btamps
for certificates and other state papers.
I feel certain that the state is exempt.
At any rate I have informed the man
ager of the telphone company that the
corporation department will not pay a
tax on long-distance telephone calls."
Assistant Attorney General Benja
min, In an opinion asked by Insurance
Commissioner Ferguson, held that the
insurance agents and not the insurance
department would have to provide the
stamps, costing 10 cents each, under
the war tax measure, for each certifi
cate of authority Issued by the insur
ance department.
Attorney General Crawford was not
in the city, but James Crawford, first
assistant attorney general, said he be
lieved that the state departments
would have to provide the war stamps
for certain legal documents.

Salem Governor West, in his mes
sage to the legislature will recom
mend the repeal of all continuing ap
propriations but those for educational
purposes, according to an announce

he says, because they are not pruned
by legislatures, as are appropriations
made every two years, and, further,
because the legislature in making ap
propriations for certain departments,
fails to take note of the continuing ap
propriations. He, however, thinks the
educational Institutions should remain.
