sliownth.it such euterjnisis ar.- of nulio’ial
interest. He nuggUMt* that n ioimniion;
be appointed which shall Is; alhori/e<l to
take the .whole |Oeßtion of cheap

the propriety of exaiiiinhig and reporting 1
njsiii the praetieahilily ofojs ning an almost
eolitinoua line of navigable vvatei com
inunieutlon from Maine to the tiulf of .
Mexico,an an internal improvement which
would lx? of inestimable value in cum* of u |
foreign war.
The Report of the Secretary of the Navy j
is briefly referred to. und ids suggestions
recommended to the careful eonaidemtion
of Congrem*.
Next in ••rtler comes a ay nop is ol the
doings of (he Poitoffice Pepartuieiit. The j
receipts wore $21.1* 15.12*5.37; the exjieridi
tutvs $20.058,11*2.31. The fav.niddo con
sidoratioii of Congress is asked to the
recommendation of the Postmaster (Jeiieral
for an iuen-ase of wrvieo from monthly to
semi-monthly trips on the mall steamship
route in Bru/ii, for u subsidy in aid ot the
4-stab)ishnieiit of an American line of mail
steamers Ix-tween San Francisco, New

of JHa-loffice saving hanks, and fir un in
* l ease of tiie salarios of the bonds of
bumans.
The President repeats his I'nruier lotom
meiidatum for abolishing the banking
privilege accorded the national bunks; but.
believing that Congress will nut adopt bis
opinion on the subject suggests that the
]rivilege be so modified as to correct its
glaring and costly abuses. He also reeom
tuends tho purchase of all the telegraph
lines now in ojx*ration. and eunneetlng this
service with the |mxUil service.. He also
asks that iiiieral coulraota be authorized
for carrying the mails by the Pacific Mail
S.eam-dilp Company; the ITiitctl States
und Brazil line; und the California. New
Zeahi.Hl and Austrailin lino, those U ing
the only three lines plying between the
Tinted 8 4 ates and foreign port* which are
operated u.tdr our flag.
The next iwragraph of the message
refers to the import of the Secretary of
the Treasury, \rlllch, it is stated, ""‘ill
show un alarming foiling off in our carry
ing trade for the la.if ten years, nnd even
for the past year." The only reinedv in
directly suggested for this state 4t things
is. that Congress shall grant subsidies to
the amount of five millions of dollars fl
year for five years, to tbe owners of vessels
flying the United Slates flag, and trading
with foreign ports, (’ougross is oahed b>

Federal Finance*.
j Howefer gratifying it nuiy lie to an
j uounee a monthly reduction of the public
, debt, the fact is not to be lost sight of that
| this reduction comes not. from the economy
j of the Government, but from (he enorm
ous taxation imposed upon the )teople.
These tuxes, even for the last fiscal year,
ending June 30, 1H72, were largely over
ONK MILLION A DAV FOR KVKHV DAY IN
TIIKYKAH—SB74,IOO, H>7—5210,370,280
from customs and $130,042,177 from in
ternal revenue. The ordinary expendi
tures, including $117.357,839 for interest
on the public debt, were $270,550,095,
leaving for current expenses, exclusive of
intrest. $153,191,854. Over one hun
dred millions was raised by taxation over
the union ot necessary to curry on the
Government, which amount was $153,000.
000 for the several Departments. The
; balance went to reduce the national debt,
j and $99,900,253 was applied to that pur
; pose. The moral effect of this immense
amount of money taken from the pockets
of the people and put into the Treasury
has been to create an amount of extravag
ance which would not be tolerated for a
moment, if the income from taxes in some
measure corresjKaided to the real necessi
ties of the Government. These ordinary
expenses have more than doubled since the
civil war. and are out of all proportion to
what ought to be considered a wise and
intelligent administration of public affairs. \
The Secretary of the Treasury, is not con
tent with a reasonable reduction of the
public debt, but seems to have a childish
ambition to reduce it as much as possible
while he is in office, ami without the least
regard to the hundreds of millions of tax
iiiqsised upon the people. The amount of
money in the Treasury is the excuse for
all sorts of jobs in Congress, and for this
session pipe is laid for putting through, by
hook or by crook, more of these measures
than over before. It. therefore, becomes
the true friends of tin* Government not to
tolerate these unjust expenditure*, and at
the same time keep the taxes down to the
point of sinking the public debt to $25,-
' 900,000, instead of nearly $100,000,000,
u year. The n*eeipts for the year ending
June 30,1874,art* estimated at $320,300,-
000. and the exixmditureM at $280,000,000;
estimated surplus, $33,700,000. The ex
penses ought nut to be ao large, and the
! n*! surplus much greater, for the reasons
i we have named.—jv. Expert*.
