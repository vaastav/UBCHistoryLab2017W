The Ville ilu Havre was formerly the
Napoleon 3rd. She was altered ami
much enlarged last winter and came
here for the first time as \ ille du Havre
in the month ol April, making the pass
age from Brest to this port in nine day
and twenty-three hours. \\ ith the ex
ception of "the Great Eastern she was
largest steamer that ever entered this
port, her dimensions being 430 feet by
4X feet. Her carriage capacity was
3,500 tons weight ami measurement. ,
ller mam saloon was fitted up with mm- i
l>le wainse??t ting ot three ditleieiit \.i
rieties. The upholstering was in velvet, !
and W'XkI work carved in the most unii|iu'
design. Her engines were compound
direct acting 3.200 horse power, made ]
by Leslie & Co., New Castle-on Tyne.
"The eighty seven persons saved trom
the wreck of the steamship Ville tin
Havre, were rescued by the Locheam
ami not the Triniountain as was first
stated. They were transferred from
the Locheam to the Triniountain on ihe
same daj The survivors arrived at
Brest oil to-day. There is intense ex
citement in London over the disaster.
The bulletin boards at the newspaper
offices are surrounded by great crowds

the particulars of the disaster were sold
at double the usual price.
Boston, Dec. 1.? The announcement
of the loss of the Ville du Havre creat

T11E LATEST VAKTICULAUS ? DESCUllTION j
OK THE TEKltlltl.E SCENE. j
London, December 1. ? The following '
additional particulars of the luss ot' the
Ville du Havre have been gathered
from the officers and passengers at Cur
The Ville du Havre experienced a
thick fog until the 20th. At the time of
the collision the weather was clear and
little wind was Mowing, hut there was a
heavy sea. The captain had just retired
and the second officer was in charge.
The lights on the steamer were all right
imd the collision was wholly unexpect
ed. The Loch Earn struck the steamer j
amidships and made a chasm twelve feet
deep and from twenty-five to thirty feet I
wide. The exact position of the Ville
du Havre at that time was lat. 42.21,
long. 3.>.31.
A panic took possession of thepassen- j
gers. Five minutes after the collision
the main and mizzen masts fell across
two large boats which were filled with
people and ready for launching,. The j
boats were crushed, and many of their
occupants killed and injured.
In the brief interval between the col
lision and the sinking of the steamer
the crew were able to launch only a
whale boat and the captain's gig. The
Loch Earn went a mile before stopping.
She then got out four boats to pick up
^he people struggling in the water.
Meantime the whale boat, under the j
command of the second lieutenant of
the Ville du Havre, picked up one load
of those who were clinging to the
planks, spars, ?fcc., aud took them to the
Loch Earn. She returned to the scene
and rescued another load.
Captain Surmount, who remained on
deck to the last, was rescued' by this
boat. Three quarters of an hour after
the collison one of his officers swam a
mile to the Loch Earn, and was hauled
on board with a rope. The boats con
tinued to search the water in the vicini
diff.
ty of the disaster until there was no
hope of saving more lives.
The cold was intense. Many of the
survivors were immersed two hours, and
were almost lifeless when rescued. The
ship Trimountain sighted the Loch
Earn at eight A. M., six hours after the
sinking ot the steamer, and received the
survivors before reported. '1 he saved
speak in the highest terms ot the kind
ness of Captain Urquhart, her comman
der. There were six stow-a-ways on
board the V'ille dti Havre.
The Yilte du Havre is insured in Lou
don for j?90,0t)j, ot about

Judge Kufns If. Peckham, among the
lost passengers, was one of ihe most
promim-nt members of the judiciary in
New Vork State, and was judge ol the
Court of Appeals. He was a father of
\\ heeler H. Peckham, of New Ycrk,
and lint us Peckham, district attorney
at Albany. Judge Peckham, on ac
count of ill health, was obliged to dis
continue his labors on the bench, and
sail on the \ i lie du Havre, for a brief
stay in Europe, in company with his
wile. His indisposition was only tem
porary, it is said, and his general health
w as good for a man of his advanced
age, nearly TO years.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The President's message, which was
j delivered to the two houses ot Congress
yesterday, shortly after one o'clock, and
! was published in a Sun Extra within
two hours afterwards, while it touches
; upon a great number of important sub
jeets, hardly discusses any of them in a
way to challenge special criticism or
comment. In the very tirst sentence of
the message the President speaks of the
past year, "esjiecially the latter part of
it," as "an eventful one to the country,'
and then proceeds to summarize the
events that have happened, somewhat
oddly including among them, and in the
same breath with the Yirginius affair,
I the fact that "potitical partisanship has
almost ceased to exist, especially in the
agricultural regions." The statement
is somewhat obscure, and whether in
f tended to refer to thcriseof the granges
at the A Vest, or the decline of the Ku
Klux at the South, does not clearly ap
pear. In any ease the fact chronicled
can hardly be classed among eoenln.
Following the usual order of subjects
observed in such documents, the mess
age begins as far from home as possible,
j with our foreign relations and with one
of the remotest of these ? the Emperor
of China. Gradually approaching mat
ters of more consequence, the President
refers to the payment by Great Britain
i of the Geneva award, and urges the
j appointment of a commission to make
I distribution of the amount among the
parties entitled to it. Common honesty
would suggest as much, and it is to be
hoped that the President's recommcnda
1 tion will be acted upon. There can be
no justification lor the appropriation or
j retention of this money by the United
, States. A very sensible and timely re
j commendation is made in retence t'j the
; subject of expatriation. It is shown
how exceedingly detective our present
legislation is, and how anomalous 'the
position of this country before the world
in this respect. The nation which was
the first to resist the slavish doctrine of
perpetual allegiance is now among the
last to indicate how its own citizens
may elect a foreign nationality.
Upon the subject ot the Yirginius
nothing new is communicated in the
message. The terms ot settlement are
stated in the most favorable manner
j possible to the United States, with a
curious omission to mention those pro
visos and qualifications which the public
! have been given to understand form
part of the settlement and which were
evidently inserted as safeguards of Span
, ish honoi and to soothe Spanish pride.
I The President excuses himself from
I going into greater detail, upon the
ground that the correspondence between
the two governments wos conducted in
( cypher and by telegraph, and he awaits
the receipt ot the actual text by mail.
Passing from matters foreign to do
mestic, the President recommends fur
thcr amendments to the constitution
authorizing the executive to veto bills
in part ami to approve in part; prohibit
ing any legislation by Congress within ?
the last twenty four hours ot its sitting, !
and restricting that body when conven
ed in extra session to such business as ;
the executive may lay before it. Jt is !
questionable whether any of these mea- j
ures are sufficiently important to require I
an amendment of the constitution.
In introducing the subject of the ua ,
tional finances, the Presidont alludes to
the present dillieulty to make both ends
meet, and the necessity of greater econ
omy in the matter ot government ex
penditures. One saving recommended,
being the suspension, for the present, of j
work upon government buildings not
yet commenced, the hope is incidentally
expressed that one day we may feel rich
enough to build houses at Washington |
for the cabinet officers and all persons
who now receive commutation for quar
ters or rent at government expense, and '
that the States may be tempted to do
the handsome thing by building similar ,
residences for their Senators.
Later on in the message the city of ,
\\ ashington, its improved streets and
avenues, and its board of public works,
come in for a "first-rate notice" at the
hands ot the President. The idea, which
has ceased to be a novel one, is present- j
ed that the embellishment cl the capital '
should be an object of pride and interest
to the whole country, and that the im- '
provements in question should be re- i
garded as "a national investment."
Upon the subject of finances generally,
ami the cognate topics of the currency
and the "panic," the message will hardly
satisfy the expectations of those who
have been more or less eagerly awaiting
its utterances. There is a want of clear
ness in the language of the message
which is painfully suggestive of want of 1
clearness in the ideas of the writer.
First and foremost we ha\e the declara- 1
tion "that we cannot have permanent
prosperity until a specie basis is reach
ed, and that a specie basis cannot be
reached and maintained until our ex
ports, exclusive of gold, pay for our iin- J
ports, interest due abroad, and other |
specio obligations, or eo nearly so as to
leave an appreciable accumulation of the |
precious metals in the country from the
product of our mines."
Next we are shown how, from in
crease of population, increase of manu
facturing industries, aud the habit of
the southern negroes to carry their
wages in their breeches' pockets instead
of depositing them in savings banks,
the currency is practically in a state of
gradual contraction. It is further re
garded as "patent to the most casual
observer that much more currency is
required during the fall aud winter
months" than during the rest ot the
| year, and it is more than intimated that
with a non-elastic currency panics may
thus come to be an autumnal institution j
like the equinox, connected with "mov- I
ing the crops." To meet this emergen* j
cy it is suggested that power be given
to the Secretary of the Treasury during ,
these periods of annual stringency to
issue to national banks a certain amount
of their own notes upon a deposit by
them of an equal amount of government
bonds, the bonds to be redeemable by |
the banks at their pleasure by returning
an equal amount oi their bills for can- ;
cellation. |
In this way it is supposed thedifhcul
ty of a non-elastic currency can be over- j
come, and elasticity be imparted to the ;
present paper issues ot the country.
The establishment of clearing houses,
the prohibition of payment of interest
on deposit, and a law requiring the
i banks to hold their reserves in their
I own vaults, are further suggested as
useful modifications of the present na
tional banking law, with a view to "a
prevention of the use of other people s
! money in stock and other specks of
speculation." From all this .however,
! it is difficult to deduce any policy, or
i the suggestion of a policy, which leads
up to resumption, or either looks steadi
i ly in that direction. Inflation is cer
tainly not the road to specie payments,
and the President's scheme lor impart- i
ing elasticity to the currency is praeti
J eal and periodical inflation ? and notli
j ing less. It is idle to expect that anj
j rotation of the seasons can bring with
i it those periods of alternate contraction
i and inflation which are to cause now
' bonds, aud now currency, to flow from
j the treasury, like the ebb and flow ot a
tide.
i Next to that portion of the message
! which treats of financial matters direet
! ly. perhaps the most important is that
I which relates to the bankrupt law, of
; which the President recommends, if not
j the absolute repeal, at least the repeal
j of so much as provides for involuntary
bankruptcv on account of the suspension j
j of payment There can be 110 doubt 1
i that the whole law, and especially this 1
feature, is susceptible ol very great 1m- 1
provement and needs careful revision.
Of the topics that formerly occupied
the largest space in General Grants an
, nual messages we find in the present
I one a notable dearth. St. Domingo is
! onlv alluded to in a single sentence,
, where we are told that that republic (?) ;
has applied for the exercise of an Amer
ican protectorate over it. About the
Ivu-Klux, Louisiana, and southern law
! lessness generally, there is not one word,
j A sentence is devoted to a renewal ot
1 former recommendations in favor of
, general amnesty. The Mormons ul^
I escape this time, although additional
| legislation is asked for to enable the ;
United States Courts in Utah to obtain |
juries, and a restriction of the jurisdic
tion exercised by the territorial probate ,
courts is also urged. The reccommen- j
! dation in fauor of an immense system I
j ot civil improvements, to be undertaken ;
| at the expense of the general govern- .
: ment, is not renewed. . 1
Hy a curious infelicity of expression
J the President is made to say that cheap
transportation "has contributed to, it it j
has not been the direct cause of, the re
cent panic and stringency." We sup
1 p jse the President to mean that oxces
1 sive speculations in new railroads, pro- ,
: moted by unwise legislation 011 the part ^
; of Congress, has contribuied to that .
? disastrous result ? but he does uot say 1
I it. He recommends Congress to un
dertake the care of the Erie canal and
of the Illinois State canal, upon the
! condition that those canals should be
opened for general traffic, but otherwise
defers any further expression of his
views until the special Senate commit
tee on transportation shall have made
its report and recommendations. One
other exception the 1'resiilent makes to
his general policy of opposition to fur
ther laiul grants by the general govern
ment. It is in favor of an irrigating
canal to be constructed across the arid
plain which stretches troni the eastern
slope of the llocky Mountain to the
Missouri river.
No change in the Indian policy of the
l government is hinted at. A quinquen
nial census is recommended. Civil ser
vice reform is again discussed as some
1 thing to be accomplished one of these
j days, in some uncertain and blessed fu
| ture, when the ''rule" shall have been
definitely settled, and for that purpose a
! conference between a committee of
Congress and the civil service board is
1 deemed advisable. A more effectual
method of "squelching" the whole sub
ject could not be advised. Finally, in
j a single sentence, and that the last of
I the message, the passage of a law to
better secure the civil rights of the
| "newly enfranchised" is recommended,
which Mr. Snmner will probably think
a very insufficient notice of the subject,
but then Gen. Grant, unlike Mr. Sum
ner, is not a man of one idea .-Bait. tSun.
Shot his Sweetheart Deai>. ? A
fresco painter named Poehler, went in
to a restaurant in Providence, It. I.,
last night, with Mary Rose, aged sev
enteen years, to whom he had been j lay
ing attention several months, and while
seated in one of the booths said to the
saloon-keeper, "Mary says she is going
to New York to-night to enter a con
vent." Soon afterwards reports of a
pistol were heard, and it was found that
Poehler had shot Marv dead. He then
shot himself three times, and was re
moved to the hospital in a dying condi
tion. After the shooting he reiterated
to a German acquaintance who came in,
the complaint that Mary said she was
going to a convent. Both parties bore
a good character. It is conjectured that
the girl was talking of entering a con
vent for the purpose of teasing him.
In Congress, A. H. Stephens, a mem
ber from Georgia, formerly vice presi
dent of the Southern Confederacy, was
the principal object for the curious to
level their opera glasses at Mr. Ste
phens is a thin, spare man, and wore
his hat to keep the draught from off his

crutches, aud was warmly congratulated
by his old friends, irrespective of party.

LIFE INSURANCE decision.

A policy of insurance which indem- .
nifies'a public enemy against $ loss in
time of war is unlawful; and where en- ,
tered into before hostilities, is abrogate* I ,
when they occours. The relations it
establishes are illegal between beliger- (
ents. . , . . . ? '
Where a life policy provides that it;
shall be void upon the non-payment ot
premiums within the time prescribed,
such payment is a condition precedent; ,
time is of the essence ot contract, and
there can be no recovery it punctual
payment is oiumittod.
When the performance of acondition
precedent becomes unlawful, or bv the
act of God, impossible, this will not au
thorize a recovery upon the contract
without performance. Such case distin
guished from those in which subsequent ?
impossibility and illegality are rclie*.
upon as a defence.
A contract of insurance, the continu
ance of which depends upon the elec
tion and acts of the insured, is not nice
a debt, the obligations of which abso

^The relations between the members
of a corporation tor mutual insuiamt

between ordinary co-partners.
The reasons for the dissolution ot ex
ecutory contracts by war are not alone
that such contracts involve inter-corn- !
muion across the hostile lines, or that,
they relate to property liable to capture; ,
but more especially because their exe- .
cutions increase the resources ot t.ie en- ;

A Mi i.n Winter Predicted.?' Those
comforters of men, the inild weathei
prophets, announce that the present
season of storms and cold weather is
only the herald announcing the approach
of Indian summer. They have also dis
covered that the coming winter will be
a mild one, basing the prediction on the
action of certain animals, who scein to >
have a weather bureau of their ou n,
that deals with facts and not with mere
"probabilities." The muskrats, it is
said, have built their houses "both srnal
and li?'ht." This is held to be a good
sign, and it may be, if their economy in
the use of building materials lias not
been caused by the stringency in the
money market instead ot by faith in the
instinctive foreknowledge of mild win- l
ter weather. The birds also, who have ,
neglected to emigrate south at the usu
al season, may possibly heve some t?ns- j
portation problems and questions of the
rate of charges or through freights that
need adjustment before they take pas
sage. Still the winter may be a uiild
one, and it is to be hoped that the musk- .
rats have this year made no mistake.

A medicine thai has done more than all the
prescriptions of trie pharmacopseia to protect
the human system against ti.e bodily ills su
perinduced by uiiDealtb) sui roundups, ii cer
tainly worthy of universal confidence. It is
mainly on account of its extraordinary pre
ventive properties that Hosteller's Stomaeli
liilters is so exceedingly popular in localities
subject to ihc visitation of miasmatic levers
and other diseases produced by empoisutied
air. A family that has escaped scikness dur
ing a sick!) season inconsequence in using the
[litters as a safeguard, is a living advertisement
of the v irtues of a preparation. The whole
neighborhood rexlizc tbe facl "I couldn't have
believed it," says one. 4,i scarcely credited
the advertisements* but one must believe what
one sees," says another. "It is tne very thing
we need in this unwholesome section of coun
try," remark* a third. And the result is that
the instinct of self-defence, the tirst law of na
ture, induces three-foui ths of that community
to obtain a supply of the great vegetable anti
dote before the next sickly season sets in. In
winter, wfoen the system requires extra vigor
and elasticity to enable it to batik* the elt'ecls
of daairi and cold, the Bitters will be found
particularly serviceable. Rheumatism will not
be apt to fasten upon muscles and nerves that
have been braced up by this excellent ir.' igo
rant and nervine; nor will the severities of the
season, which have such a disastrous effect on
the pulmonary organs of the feeble and delicaie
be likely to exercise the same untoward wtlu
ences in cases where the stomach and extern
al surfaces of the body (which always sympa
thizes with the digestive organs) have betn
toned and stimulated by ihe course cf the re
storative. The tils of indigestion and irregu
larities of the bowels which proceed from sud
den changes of weather may always he avert
ed by a timely use of the Bitters.
