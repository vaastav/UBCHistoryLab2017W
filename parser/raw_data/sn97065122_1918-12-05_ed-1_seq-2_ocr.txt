NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS.
The U. S. War Industrie Board hat issued aa order
forbidding publishers continuing subscriptions after date
f expiration, unless subscriptions are renewed and paid
for.
While it has been the general rule of this newspaper
to stop all papers promptly, there are some few who have
asked for time on their subscriptions both to the Daily
and Weekly Sun. These subscriptions will now have to
be discontinued under the new law.
If you want the paper continued to you, send in your
renewal subscription before your time expires.
Any er .jneous riflection upon the character, standing or
repuation of any person, firm or corporation which may
appear in the columns of this paper will be glady cor
rected if brought to the attention of the editor.
Only sixteen more shopping days until Christmas.
Now, congress, you know all about America's plans
in the peace conference.
The German people will never forgive their faithless
leaders, who failed to destroy the allied nations.
The air of expectancy that broods over Europe is not
necessarily anxiety as to the exact date of George Creel's
arrival.
The silence that greeted the President's suggestion that
the United States should apologize to Colombia was about
as opposed to applause as frost is opposed to warmth.
1 The kaiser says he has friends left in America, and
.would be glad to issue a statement to them had he not
retired to private life. Wonder where Wilhelm got this
information?
We hope some of our leading citizens will interest them
selves in the soldier monument movement suggested in
this newspaper and will feel free to discuss the question
through the columns of their home newspaper.
Greeneville hasn't quite so many manufacturing in
dustries as some other towns we know of, but it can be
said for those operating here that they are enjoying a
good business and have never experienced the ' slightest
trouble, financially or otherwise.
In discontinuing subscriptions to The Daily Sun as
they expire upon our books, there are likely to be slight
mistakes made, and we desire to say that if for any reason
your paper should be discontinued before the time is out,
you will do us a kindness by notifying us.
The President's failure to set forth his peace plans in
his message to congress raised the ire of members of both
houses. President Wilson has been equal to the occasion
so far and we feel sure he will be able to make a satis
factory explanation when the proper time comes.
Everybody is now demanding the surrender of the
kaiser, his trial and conviction and punishment accord
ing to the crimes committed by his bloody barbarians in
carrying on the savage war into which he plunged the
world. And when all the world wants a man punished
it is not likely at all that he will escape.
I Before criticising the delays in the forwarding of the
casualty lists, as appears to be the disposition of certain
members of congress, it might be well to await the ex
planation of Gen. Pershing who, Secretary Baker says,
is doing all that human ability can do to get the lists over
promptly. It is an immense job collecting data about
each of two millions of men scattered over hundreds of
miles.
The annual value of poultry and eggs sold is more
than that of the silver, gold and pig iron produced. There
is millions of money in poultry and eggs, and but small
capita required. ' The annual imports of eggs in Eng
land approximate 100,000,000, dozen, and into I'f
United States 17,000,000 dozen a year. Here is an in
dustry in which the demand is greater than our home
supply. Look well to the" poultry, and they will assist
you to find the "golden egg."
Following his usual custom, Postmaster Gouchenour
.tells us he will provide additional help at the local post
office during the holiday rush in order to give our people
the very best service possible. Our people have little just
complaint to make at the service they are receiving from
the Greeneville office. Our people do not appreciate
fully just what we are enjoying in this respect. Many
towns many times the size of Greeneville do not enjoy
the accommodations afforded here.
THE PEOPLE RESERVE JUDGMENT.
For good or ill, President Wilson leaves for Europe
without the united support of the American people. It is
not so much that some of the people are opposed to Mr.
Wilson's plans as it is that they are ignorant of them.
He had an opportunity yesterday to take Congress and
the people into his confidence on the all-important sub
jects comprised under the head of peace plans, but he
did not choose to discuss the matter. Consequently,
while Congress and the people have only the best of
wishes for Mr. Wilson in the fateful journey that he is
taking, they reserve judgment, as they must do in the
absence of information, on the matters with which he
will have to deal. They are familiar with the "fourteen
points, "..as are all the allied and enemy nations, in prin
ciple; but between the principle and the application of
the principle to distracted and disorganized Europe there
is a world of room for difference of opinion, or even for
bitterness and estrangement.
No other American has ever assumed quite as heavy
a load of responsibility as Mr. Wilson has assumed in
going to Europe. At least, the responsibility shouldered
by others has not been so pregnant with big consequence.
It was not at the suggestion of the people that the Presi
dent decided to go abroad. In fact, the people were at
once disquieted by the news of his decision; and it was
most natural that they should eagerly await his state
ment of intentions in representing them so intimately
in an errand so vitally affecting them. They expected
from him an outline, at least, of his views, and upon his
statement of them they would have gone far to acquiesce
in his views, even if they seemed somewhat Utopian, for
the sake of showing a united front to Europe.
Instead of discussing this subject, the President chose
to discuss the railroad question and other domestic sub
jects, which, however interesting they may be, are nec
essarily subordinate to the overshadowing plan of ar
ranging the world's peace. Thus the public must remain
in the dark concerning Mr. Wilson's specific ideas; and
being in the dark, the people will be extremely cautious
before they commit themselves.
When the President goes into conference with the ex
ecutive heads of the larger allied governments he will
find that each of them is supported like a stone wall by the
people of his country. Mr. Lloyd George has shrewdly
called an election for December 15th in, order to receive
fresh from the British people a mandate to stand firmly
for the interests of the British empire in the peace nego
tiations. Premier Clemenceau is t,he living voice of
France, and France's aims are thoroughly understood by
every Frenchman. Premier Orlando is backed by the
people of Italy in a clear-cut program. Thus each of
these leaders enjoys what Mr. Wilson now lacks; that i$n
the united and sympathetic support of all the people in
putting forth a clear-cut national program.
Mr. Wilson unquestionably looms far above any other
statesman in expressing the aspirations of the free and
freed peoples of the world. His opinions will have im
mense weight in the preliminary conferences, notwith
standing the fact that the allied premiers are not under
any illusions concerning American politics. They are
as well aware as anybody that Mr. Wilson was unfor
tunate at the November election and that his spokesman
ship for America is therefore impaired. But they are
quite ready to yield him the frst place as spokesman of
the enlightened sentiment of the world. It is only when
ipecific peace arrangements begin to be considered that
.the allied statesmen will be slow to yield in matters di-
The variety of questions covered by the peace negotia
tions will be so great, and their importance so transcend
ent, that the people of the United States cannot refrain
from exercising their own judgment, to the best of then
ability, before they place themselves unreservedly in the
hands of their ambassador. They would have exercised
their judgment more fully if t,hey had had more infor
mation. If Mr. Wilson's power in the conferences should
be lacking because of the lack of consolidated national
support, it will not be entirely because of political differ
ences in this country, but partly because the people do
not know Mr. Wilson's intentions. Washington Post.
The Russian bolshevists are seeking peace with the
allies on any terms not related to internal affairs; but
as internal affairs constitute the real interest the allies
now have in Russia the delivery of the people from
anarchy and chaos it is not likely that the bolsheviki
will get a hearing. The world doesn't want peace with
bolshevism, but it must be destroyed, as its unspeakable
antithesis, autocracy, has been destroyed. The future
peace, order and happiness of the peoples. of the world
depend upon the establishment of just, righteous and
humane governments responsive to the will and wishes of
all the people and not a minority of them, and that mi
nority the most ignorant, bloodthirsty and selfish of all.
The Sun has been deluged with soldier letters, and we
would be glad to publish all of them, but we find that
many of them are purely personal and concern only those
to whom they are addressed. We will continue to print
as many as possible, however, and especially those of a
general public interest. Many of these letters are hur
riedly written and in preparing for publication require
careful editing, and we have not the time to do this.
Anyone sending a letter for publication will please send
return postage, so that in case it is rejected it can be
returned.
The editor of The Daily Sun is indebted to Mr. Henry
R. Brown for the good letter he sent us yesterday. We
feel that much good will result from the suggestions he
had to offer. If the patrons of The Daily Sun over
looked this letter in Wednesday afternoon's paper, we
hope they will look up their paper and read it.
