Adown Titncj river sleeping wide
The swift soul frcfghted barge of years
1 j 1 Swings round the Isle of Chnstmastide

False beacons beckoned whirlpools drew
And sunken rocks their deathtraps piled i
Beneath the waters placid view

THE SECOND ADVENT
IM 1
rbWp The first advent of our Lord in the meridian of time
+
I h v is the great event of history The overshadowing event of
prophecy is His second advent of which the Scriptures
1 1 t i speak with certainty and clearness that leave no room for
i s doubt This same Jesus which is taken up from you into
ji n < a cc t u heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go
+ c 1 into heaven Acts i n This is a prophetic declara
c 1 tion with no uncertain sound
aim f
fJ t i t j There is diversity of opinion as to the interpretation of
i s Scripture passages relating to the second advent the mil
i I I tiL Icnium and kindred subjects and it is necessary to be watch
It ful against premature conclusions and uncharitable criti
rf 1t cisms But as it is a fact that the Lord will come and estab
> I t
dish His kingdom upcn this earth it behooves the Bible stu
r
+ dent humbly to watch for thy signs of His coming and to
j ti 4 l be prepared for the midnight cry
r r The present time is undoubtedly the hour of Gods prep
Vii aration for the great Millennial day When we behold the
ondcrful inventions and disccovcries of our age we arc
t H forced to the conclusion that we arc drawing nearer and
nearer the establishment of the promised kingdom of the
r F a rt tr > m Lord This is the tune of the end in which as the Prophet
ji i ii Daniel expresses it inarty shall rim to and fro and knowl
tt sty t edge be increased In his comments on this text Sir Isaac
z m Newton wrote I should not be surprised if the time
s would conic tliat men would travel at the rate of fifty miles
tlr an hour Voltaire ridiculed Sir Isaac Newton and called
S tr tit 3 m him a poor old dotard because he declared that he found in
l f
h rj + sl m one of the prophecies of Daniel a prediction of speedy travel
ash tlw r as one of the characteristics of the time of the end But we
r + believe Newton has been more than vindicated by the events
It td nM as we notice them around us every day
str i As for the increase of knowledge another character
istic of the period of the end when was there a time in the
history of man in which this increase was so marked as the
j present Children from ten to fourteen years of age arc
d ifov generally instructed upon subjects of which in former
rH q l generations only few did ever dream A century ago bare
i ly to read and to write were deemed great achievements To
1 S day a child that does not know something of algebra lan
n guages and the numerous other subjects that go to make up
i a the studies in the common schools is considered ignorant
i t Knowledge is increasing Man is approaching the very
boundaries of the spiritual worM that is manifest in the ma
rt1 terial creation Dr Locb believes he has found some of the
t f 4 secrets of life He has announced that he has succeeded in
r ti producing organisms showing all the essentials of animal
3 life Prof Lc Due a Frenchman has just announced thnt
jr t plant life can be producedby chemical action His plants
w 1 s I have nothing of the vegetable in their makeup but they bc
the a N Have after their production as do the real vegetables they
g h t1 resemble under natural conditions Into the makeup of
r these products nothing living enters Prof Le Due makes
119 r k r l seeds in pill forms one port of sulphate of copper and two
ff parts of glucose These arc deposited in bullion made of
+ gelatine to which is added 3 per cent of ferro cyanide of
tl potassium and a little sea salt The seeds give birth to
is r ° plants resembling seaweeds and other marine plants The
j plants thus produced arc influenced similarly by heat and
w cold as are the vegetables they resemble The achievements
i1i i q of scientists are realty marvelous No prophecy has ever I
l been more clearly fulfilled than this concerning the increase
a
f 5 m of travel and the increase of knowledge
fim ftI4 I i We arc also told that one of the characteristics of the I
r r time of the end is the multiplication of trouble If we II
i look about us we think it is not hard to discern the elements I
ji from which a multitude of troubles will finally spring We i
seem to be nearing the time in which human passion his

CHRISTMAS GREETING
i Again the Christmas News ill the sPiril of the season cordially greets its friends ami patrons throughout
the world WI find no more appropriate words ill which to express our sentiments than the beautiful strains in which A
the heavenly hosts heralded the first advent of our Lord and Redeemer Glory to God in the highest and on earth
peace good will toward men f
The Christmas Nncs lids under its present efficient management become an important feature of Western
periodical literature It has become a power for good It is fulfilling a great mission The Netstas established
when Utah still was in its infancy with the prophetic ors gltI that inspired the early Pioneers in all their enterprises
with a view to the glorious future of this intermoiinlain region It was founded to be an exponent of truth and a
champion of liberty and of every laudable nndeitaking for the development of these alleys It has grown from year
to year keeping pace with tle advancement which it has been its privilege to promote as well as to witness Today the
friends of the Sews rcganffil at one of the great journalistic institutions of the West Dili its glory is that it has
ever been loyal to the cause of truth liberty and progress 4
Great events have by the fates been inscribed during the year in the annals of history References to these
will be found in other parts of this imprint and especially in the Greeting of the First Presidency of the Church to the
readers of the Xcus in both hemispheres There arc records of crime and disasters of intrigue and plotting
against governments and the activity of all the evil forces the triumph of which would mean chaos and death but also
of the still mightier forces that are at work for the gradual reconstruction of the new heaven and Ihe new earth in I
which righteousness is to dwell Congresses such as the panAmerican the transMississippi and various peace gath
erings arc among the signs thai augur the coming of a brighter day So is the construction of lines of communication
such as the Panama canal in the interest of which President Roosevelt undertook his untu eccdcnted journey Looking
at the past we find only cause for gratitude and encouragement The two opposing powers have been in mortal com
bat as ever but the victory belongs to light and truth to God and those who arc on the Lords side The final outcome
is not doubtful
Let us on this glorious anniversary and for ever lay aside all animosity and all strife and open our hearts and
homes wide for peace joy and that brotherly love which is broad enough to embrace all the children of the eternal
Father even those who hire erred and gone astray Let us remember the poor and needy and the wounded whom roc
may find on the road to Jericho waiting for the good Samaritan Let the season be one of giving and receiving of joy and
gladness of helpfulness and loving sacrifice Someone has said that in heaven everyone wants to give everyone else
all he has in Inferno everyone wants to take away from everyone what lie has Christmas is the season in which
heaven draws scar unto earth Let us open our hearts to its influence and make it remain with us for ever
PROGRESS IN EDUCATION
Christmas is essentially the childrens holiday and a few
lines on education would therefore seem appropriate at this
time
New courses of study recommended for the schools by
leaders in educational work and more or less adopted by
superintendents and principals show a strong tendency to
wards industrial activity in schools and the correlation of
school work with the great occupations and industries of the
country That this subject is of immense importance may
be gathered from the attention paid to it by President Roose
velt in his message to Congress
The former basis of elementary education still continues
to be practised leading to proficiency in the socalled three
Rs reading writing and arithmetic but the basis of train
ing has been shifted Formerly the training in these
branches was mainly upon words selected from stories or
literature liked by adults with the idea that the children
should be drilled into the use and meaning of these words
and facts by amt exercise of the memory This principle of
education is long since obsolete in theory even if occasional
vestiges of it arc found to survive in practice
The new education deals primarily with things with
facts with laws i it uses words merely as the vehicle for ex
pressing what has been learned by experiment and obser
vation This way of looking upon education as so much
work to be done upon things has resulted in the establishment
of the laboratory method of the colleges and the activity
methodthe play work development exercises of the kin
dergarten
But between the kindergarten and the college stand
the elementary or common schools and the secondary or
high schools
A candid inquiry among our leading educators met by
equally candid answers from them has elicited the almost
uniform declaration that neither the common nor the high
schools have been fully converted in practice at least to
the real laboratory principle and that in some respects the
mere laboratory method is still struggling to find a foothold
in most of the common and in some of the high schools
It is not asserted that cither the common or the high
schools of this country do not in form recognize and prac
tise to some extent the laboratory method j but that they do
not as a rule put into operation what that method really
signifies
All the schools study things to a greater or less degree
according to the genius and training of the teachers but
the trouble is that some study things as mere things
and not as related to the ital permanent and real interests
of the learner
I The high school or district school course in physiology
for example usually deals with certain elements of the sci
I ence of anatomy the mysteries of the internal car the com
position of bone or muscle etc as if the student were tak
and would next study
ing the first steps in a medical course
in a college of medicine But that is what less than one in
each hundred is preparing to do and even for that one it is
doubtful whether or not such instruction would be of real
value to him in his subsequent career The relation of
physiology to daily life the hygiene of deep breathing
slow eating of muscular exercise of regular and sufficient
sleep of preserving the eyesight etcthese arc the kind
of things which every student requires and it is not so much
a knowledge of them as a drill in their practice that the
schools should give High school botany we apprehend
has little significance when it largely consists as is generally
the case of peering through a microscope to learn the mys
teries beautiful as they are of cellformation and
The science
and the theories of biology great
and art of agriculture is what botany should
not lead to as the high school teachers explain
school itself The idea
but what it should actually be in the
that any subject should not be but should only prepare for
some other subject valuable in itself seems to originate
from the theory that the common school prepares the stu
dent not to do independently anything for himself but
prepares him for another school the high school that the
high school in like manner prepares not for life but for
college umd tbaLtbccolkcc Piepara for thejtuiiYcrsiiy
This idea will some time be recognized as a fundamental
error in school work
We might show that district and high school zoology
to be immediately practical and useful in the field of agri
culture should be something far other than it actually is
that high school physics at present is merely a preparation
for engineering courses if it is even that i and that chemis
try with all its laboratory method and the beauty and won
der of its laws is still unrelated to ae real life and interests
of the people
But indications arc not lacking all along the line that
the laboratory method of dealing with things will presently
be changed into the idea and practice of dealing with things
as they concern the daily life or the permanent interests of
mankind that school courses will not only deal with real
ities but with such realities as are immediately useful to the
bodily the mental the noral or the financial affairs of life i
that the common and high schools no less than the kinder
gartens and colleges are not a preparation for life much
less a preparation for some other school or college but arc
life itself and that perfect education is simply perfect liv
ing
We trust that nothing herein will be construed as any
sort of endorsement of the mistaken idea that only work
with the hand or body is practical education i for only
that training is practical which fits for life and life today
means work with the head far more than with the hand
We feel however that our schools arc tending in the
right direction and that the steps already taken to that end
deserve congratulation and encouragement
TESTIMONY OF EARTHQUAKES
Shortly after the establishment of the Church the mes
sengers of the Gospel wens told For after your testimony
cometh the testimony of earthquakes that shall cause groan
ings in the midst of her and men shall fall upon the ground
and shall not be able to stand And all things
shall be in commdtion and surely mens hearts shall fail
them for fear shall come upon all people Doc and Coy
Section 888991
Some of the events of this year forcibly remind us of
this prophetic forecast It has been in a marked degree a
year of commotion The works or men have gone down
to ruin in calamities such as the records of few years show
The long list opens with the outbreak of Vesuvius From
the impulse of hidden forces the very shape of the historic
mountain was changed and many homes were totally destroyed
slrojed In the heart of the South Sea through volcanic
outbursts valleys were filled up plantations destroyed and
the population driven away to seek refuge in new localities
The destruction of San Francisco
belongs to the awful rec
ord of this year The earth for miles slipped several inches
and the movement was enough to humble into the dust the
pround city of the Golden Gate Then came the doom
of Valparaiso a city which was a wealthy center of the
worlds commerce long before the North American ports had
become worldrenowned These calamities
have been mon
umental Each would be sufficient to mark an epoch in UK
annals of disaster But to these numerous others must he
added to complete the record Floods and storms famine
and pestilence have visited many places It is a year in
which as the New York Sun some time ago expressed it
the acts of God have been made manifest
It is curious to reflect upon the fact that we arc travel
ing through space on this little globe of ours at a rate of
speed that even imagination fails to grasp and that the
slightest derangement of existing conditions would mean in
stant destruction The slightest lack of
balance in
our mo
tion around the sun the slightest shifting of the poles would
mean that the oceans would overflow the continents and
wipe out every living being A slight change of the average
temperature would mean death to the entire human family
A collision withiltl of the
any other bodies that also whirl
through space and the entire globe would be reduced to
fragments
The destructions caused by volcanic eruptions b
by earth
quakes hurricanes tidal waves floods and other agencies
arc but reminders of our dependence upon tfiei almighty
Power that governs the world to whose word it owes its
existence and maintenance They are testimonies
i
THREE GREAT STATES
Big with opportunities of future greatness if
they are not already entitled to that distinction iudH I
are the
rapidly expanding states of Utah Idaho and Nevada In
that period of time that is measured by the calendar
1906 theirs has been an almost phenomcnalrnowth yea
growth
Sure
ly they exemplify and emphasize the verity of 0 the ure
word i
of
one who long ago looked into the times ahead I
and
declared r
that westward the
course of empire should make its
Hither one of this trilogy of young Way
almost an empire in extent of area commonwealth
that beyond shadow of question Consider in that reV = I
regard
their united wealth of
resource industry and
attractiveness
and all men will concede the title to be worthily ess
worn To
day enterprise capital laborall three
are engaged
in their
material development with such zeal that thinking
their population will be doubled during the men say
next dead
Perhaps this view may be looked upon as a little extravagant
as applied to Utah the older sister of the triad whose
MO
pl outnumber those of the other two But as to Idaho peo
and
Nevada the prediction may come near having fulfillment
owing to the larger pristine conditions that prevail in them
At home it is a matter of widest knowledge
and con
gratulation that 1906 will go down in history as hating dis
tributed its gifts and blessings more generously by far than
any of its predecessors Everywhere the hum of prosperity
is heard There has been and is now plenty of work for all
who desire employment and that
too at that
wages have
in the main been higher than ever before Fields farms
and orchards have established new records and
the
mines
and mills have yielded profits heretofore unreached The
livestock interests have thriven to unexpected proportions
and new industries have in
sprung up man places
many wth the
certainty that numberless more arc to follow in their wake
In our own fair city the star of hope is not only luminously
resplendent as relates to the future but its rays ate making
brilliant the present A Greater Salt Lake is assured Its
growth cannot be checked its good name ruined or its place
among the larger western cities successfully assailed What
nature did not do for it its loyal inhabitants will The
time is not far distant when Salt Lake will assert its position
so positively that the defamers and croakers must retire for
very shame at their onslaught
In the Gem State to the north of us are a people who
arc very proud of the section of the west they call uVir
home And they have a right to be for its progress for m
cral years past has as they say in the army been made at
double quick step This year the march has increased
almost to a run and the country is beginning to wonder
when it will ease down to a normal gait On every hard
its manifold resources are being turned to rich account
It is a significant fact that more new homes have been k
in Idaho during the past three years than in any other wes
ern commonwealth Her fertile soil is producing crops f
astonishing yield and more of it is being constantly c K
vated Vast stretches of land hitherto unbroken by man
is being made productive through the application of water by
private and government rcscrvbir and canal building en
terprises and soon prolific farms and teeming gardens ul
supersede the waste places
Nevada is no longer slightingly referred to as the Rot
ten Borough The mighty fortunes that have been made
in it of late cause men to speak of it with respect and to
flock to it by thousands In the last year new towns have
been placed on its surface almost in a night and in a few
weeks or months they have become populous and fabulously
rich It is true that lurid tales have been told of Xtvadas
regeneration that the heads of men have been turned in
some cases when its marvelous mineral wealth has been re
counted and it is doubtless also true that there has been
some wildcatting indulged in But behind it all arc actual
gold and copper finds that have startled the worldfinds
which will do much to transform the Sage Brush State from
its present physical condition to one of largely increased
population and industry and which incidental arc pouring
much of their treasure in the direction of Salt Lake the
natural and logical center of the intermountain country
and particularly of Utah Nevada and Idaho
