President's Message.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate
and House of Representatives.
year ly
abundant harvests has paused. For
theso, and especially for the improved
condition of our national affairs, our rc
nowod and prolound gratitude to Qod is
duo. "Wo remain in peace- and frioml
ship with foroign powers. Tho efforts
of disloyal citizens of thoUnitod States
to involve us in foroign wars to aid in
thoir inexcusable insurrection havo bcoa
unavailing. tier Briltanio Majesty's
Gorornmont as was justly expoetod, havo
oxercised thoir authority to provent tho
tloparturo of the new host i lo expedi
tion from British1 ports. Tho Em
peror of Franco has by a liko proceeding
Eromptly indicated tho neutrality winch
o proclaimed at tho beginning of tho
contest.
Quostions of great intricacy and im
portance havo arisen out of tho blockade,
and othor belligerent operations botweon
the Government and soveral of tho mar
itimo powors, but they havo been discus
sed, and, so far as was possible, accnm-.
modatod in a spirit of frankness, justice
and mutual good will. It is especially
gratifying that our prizo courts, by tho
impartiality of thoir adjudication, havo
commanded tho respect and confidonco of
maritimo powers.
Tho supplemental treaty between tho
United States and Great Britain for the
suppression of the African Slavo Trade
made on tho 17th day of February last,
has been duly ratified and carried into
execution. It is bclioved that bo far as
American ports and American citizens
ore concerned, that inhuman and barba
rous traffic has been brought to nn end.
I shall sabtuit fcr tho consideration ol
the Senate a convention for tho adjust
ment of possessivo claims in Washing
ton Territory, arising out ol tho treaty
of tho 15th of Juno, 183G, between tho
United States and Great Britain, and
which have been tho source of some dis
quiet among tho citizons of that now
rapidly improving pait of the country.
A novel and important question involv
ing tho extent of tho maritime- jurisdic
tion of Spain in tho waters which sur
round 'tho Island of Cuba has been
'debated without reaching an agreement,
and it is proposed in an amicable spirit,
to refer it to tho arbitrament of a friend
ly power. A communication for that
purpose will be submitted to tho Senate.
I havo thouglh. it proper, to concur
with tho interested commercial powers in
an arrangement for tho liquidation of the
Scheldt dues upon tho principles which
have been heretofore adopted in regard to
tho imposts upon navigation in tho wa
torB of Denmark.
Tho long pending controversy between
this Government and that ofOhili, touch
ing tho seizure, at Bilana, in Peru, by
the Chilian officers, of a large amount
in treasure, belonging to citizens of tho
United states, has been brought to a
closo by tho award of his Majesty, tho
King of tho Belgians, to whose arbitra
tion tho question was roforred by the
parties. Tho question was thoroughly
and patiently examined by that juetly
respected magistrate, and although tho
Bum awarded to tho claimants may not
havo been as largo as they expected thcru
is no reason to distuist the wisdom of
His Majesty's decision. That decision
wos promptly complied with by Chili
when tho liitclliuenco in regard to it
reached that country.
Tho joint commissioner under tho last
session, tor carrying into efiect tho eon
vention with Pciu, on tho subject of
claims, has been organized at Lima, and
is engaged in tho business with which it
is entrusted.
Difficulties concerning oceanic transit
through .Nicaragua are in course ot ad
rnirablo adjustment, in conformity with
tho principles sot forth in my last Annu
nl Message. 'I have recent representations
from the U. S. of Columbia, and have
credited a minister to that Republic.
MILITARY EXEMPTIONS.
Incidents occurring in tho progress of
our civil war, have forced upon my at
tention tho uncertain fetate of internation
al questions touching tho rights of for
eigners in this country and of citizens of
the United States abroad. In regard to
Bomo Governments thoso rights aro at
least partially defined by treaties. In no
instanco, howevor, is it expressly stipu
lated that in tho instance of a civil war
a foreigner residing in this country, with
in the lines of tho insurgents, is to bo
oxompted from tbo rule which classos
him as a belligerent, in whoso behalf tho
Government of his country cannot ex
press any privileges or immunities dis
tinct from that character. I regret to
say howover, that such claims havo been
put forward, and in somo instances, in
behalf of foreigners who havo lived in
tho 'United States tho greater part of
their lives. There is reason to believo
that many persons born in foreign conn
tries, who have declared their intontions
to become citizens, pr who havo been ful
ly naturalized, havo evaded tbo military
duty roquired of them by denying the
fact, and thereby throwing upon tho
Government the burden of proof. It
has been found difficult or impracticable
to obtain this proof from want of guides
to tho propor sources of information.
These niignt bo supplied by requiring the
Clerk of Courts, whoro declarations of
intention may bo mado or naturalization
effected, to send, periodically, lists of tho
names of persons naturalized, or declar
ing their intention jo become citizens, to
the Secretary oT tho Interior, in whose
department these names must be arrang
ed and printed for general information
There is reason to bolievo that foreigners
frequently become citizens of the United
States for tho sole purpose of evading the
duties imposed by the laws of their na
tive country, to which in becoming nat
uralized bore, thoy at onco repair, and
never returning to tho United States,
they still claim tho interposition of tho
Government as citizens. Many alterna
tions and great prejudices have heroto
foro arisen out of this abuse. It is thero
fore submitted to your serious consider
tion. It might bo advisablo to fix a lim
it boy on d which no citizou of tho United
States, residing abroad, may claim tho
interposition of his Government. Tho
right of suffrago has often boen assumed
and exorcised by alions undorprctonco of
naturalization, which thoy havo disavow
ed when draftod into tlw military sorvico.
I submit tho cxpodicn:y of such an
amendment of tho Laws as will mako
tho fact of voting an estoppel against
any plea of exemption from military
service or other civil obligations, on tho
grounds of alienage
JAPAN.
In common with othor Wostorn Pow
ers, our relations with Japan havo been
brought into serious jeopardy through
tho porvorso opposition of tho horoditary
aristocracy of tho limine to tho enlight
ened and liberal policy of tho Tycoon,
designod to bring tho country into tho
society of nations. It is to bo hoped,
although r.ot with cntiro confidonco, that
these difficulties may he peacefully over
come. I ask your attention to tho minister
residing thero for tho damages he sustain
ed in tho destruction by firo of tho rosl
donee of tho Legation at Yeddo.
INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.
Satisfactory arrangements havo bcon
mado with tho Emporor of Russia which.
.111 ! I . VI .
u is ueuoveu, win result, in eiiecting n
continuous line of tolcgroph through
that Empire from our Pacific coast. I
recommend to your favorablo considera
tion tho snlnoct of an international tola-
graph across tho Atlantic Ocean, and
also a telegraph botweon this Capital
ntul tho National 1'orts along tho Allan
tic soa-board and tho Gulf of Mexico.
Such connections, established with any
rcasonablo outlay, would bo economicrl
as well as effuctivoaids to tho diplomatic,
military and naval services.
CONSULAR SYSTEM.
Tho consular systems of tho United
States under tho enactmonts of tho last
Congress, begin to bo solf sustaining,
anu tnero is leason to nopo that K may
becomo entirely so, with tho increaso of
trade which will ensuo whenever peaco is
rcstorod. Our Miniters abroad havo
been faithful in defending American
rights. In protecting our commercial
interests, our Consuls havo necessarily
had to incroaRod labors and responsibili
ties growing out of tho war. Theso thcy
havo lor the most part mot and discharg
ed with zeal and efhetency. Ihis ac
knowlcdgcmenr. justly includes thoso
Consuls who, residing in Morocco, Chi
na, Egypt and other central countries,
aro charged with complicated aod extra
TERRITORIES.
Territories is generally ratisfactoiy, al
though tho Indian disturbances in Now
Mexico havo not boon ortiroly suppress
ed. Tho mineral resources of Colorado,
Nevada, Idaho, Now Mexico and Arizo
na aro proving far richer than heretofore
understood. I lay bofore you a commu
nication on this subject from tho Gover
nor of New Mexico.
FOREIGN IMMIGRATION.
I again submit to your consideration
tho expediency of establishing a system
for tho encouragement of immigration.
Although this source of national woalth
is again flowing with greater freedom
than for feoveral years before tho insur
rection occurred, thero is still a groat do
ficiency of laboiers in every fio'.d of in
dustry, especially in agricnlturo and in
our mines, as well of iron and coal as of
precious metals. While tho demand. for
laborers is thus increased horo, tens of
thousands of persons destitute of remu
nerative employment aro thronging to
our foreign Consulates and offering to
emigrate to the United States if essen
tial, but very cheap assistance can bo af
forded thom. It is easy to fceo that un
der tho sharp discipline of civil war tho
nation is beginning a now life, and this
noble effort demands tho aid, and ought
to receivo tho support and attention ot
the Government. Injuries unforseen by
the Government and unintended, may in
some cases havo been inflicted upon the
subjects or citizens of foroign countries,
both at sea and on land, by persons in
the seivico of tho United States. As
this Government expects rediess frorn
other powers when similar injuries aro
inflicted by persons in thoir sorvico upon
citizens of the United States, wo must
bo proparod to do justice to foreigners.
If tho judicial tribunals aro inadequato to
this purpose, a special court may bo
authorized with powor to hoar and decido
such claims of tho charactor reforrod to,
as may hsve arisen under treaties and
public law. Conventions for adjusting
claims by such commission havo bcon
proposed to sovno Governments, but no
definite auswer to tho proposition has
yot been received from any.
In tho course of tho session I shall
probably havo occasion to request you
toprovido indemnification to claimants
where docrecs ot restitution havo ueen
awarded by tho Admiralty Court, and in
othor cases whoro this liovornment may
be acknowledged to bo liable in princi
ple and where tho amount of that liabil
ity lias been ascertained by an informal
arbitration.
TAXATION OF FOREIGN CONSULS.
Tho propor
havo deemed themselvos requirod by tho
law of tho United Slates upon tho sub
ioet. to demand a tax upon tho lucomos
of Foreign Consuls in this country;
whilo such a demand and instructions
may not bo an indication of public law,
or porhaps of any existing treaty between
tho United States and a foroign country,
the expediency of so far modifying tho
act as to exompt from tax tho incomes of
snch Consuls as are not citizons of tho
United States, Jerivod from tho emolu
ments ol their office, or from property
not situated in the United Statet, is sub
mitted to your serious consideration.
mako this suggestion upon tho ground
that a comity which ought to be recip
rocated, exempts our Consuls in all oth
er countries from "taxation to tho extent
thus indicated. Tho United States,
think, ought not tp bo exceptionally
ill Iboral to International trado'and com
merce.
THE TREASURY.
Tho operations of tho Treasury during
last yoar havo bcon successfully conduct
ed, Tho onactraent by Oongicss of a
National Banking Law has prpvod a val
uable support of tho public credit, and
tho gon era! legislation in relation to loans
has fully answered tho expectations of
its favorers. Some amendments may bo
required to perfect existing laws, but no
chango in their principles or gonoral
scopo is bolievod to bo needed. Since
thoto measures havo been in oporation
all demands on tho Treasury, including
pay to tho army and navy, havo been
promptly mot and fully satisfiod No
considerable body of troops, it is boliov
cd, woro over moro amply provided and
tnoro liberally and punctually paid, and
it may bo added thai by no peoplo wero
tho burdens incident co a great war over
moro cheerfully borne. 'Ilio receipts du
ring tho year from all sources, including
loans and balance in tho Treasury at its
commencement, wore 8991, 125, CG4 86 ;
tho aggregato disbursements 8805,790,
G'dO 05; leaving a balnnco on tho 7th of
July, 1803, of 85,829.044 21; of tho re
ceipts thero woro derived from customs
809.059.042 40; from intcrnol rovonuo
837,040,787 05; from direct taxes 81,
485,108 01; from lands 8167,017 17;
frsm miscellaneous sources. 83,940,615
85; and from loans 8770.082,371 57,
making tho aggregato $991,125,074 00.
Of tho disbursements thoro wero $232,
439 22 for pensions, etc.; $4,210,529
59 for interest on public debt, $24,729.
840 51 for War Department; 8599,298,
600 83 for tho Navy Department 863,
211,105 27; for payment of funded and
temporal debt 818.160.635,07 ; making
an aggregato of 8895,706,630,05, and
leaving a balance ot $5,320,044,21 ; but
the payment of the fnnded and temporal
dobt having been mado from monies bor
rowed during tho yoar, must bo regarded
as merely nominal payments, and tbo
monies borrowed to make them as mere
ly nominal receipts, ond their amount
8101,085,624,07 should thoreforo bo do
ducted both from tho receipts and tho
disbursements. This being dono, there
remains actual receipts 8714,709,995,58.
leaving tho balance as already stated.
Tho actual receipts for tho first quarter
and tho estimated receipts and disburse
ments for tho remaining threo quarters of
tho curront fiscal yoar of 1803 will 'bo
shown in detail by tho report of tho Sec
retary of the Treasury, to which' I invito
your attention. It. is sufficient to say
hero that it is not bolievcd that tho nat
ural results will exhibit a state of the
finances, less favorablo to tho country
than estimates of that officer heretofore
submitted whilo it is confidently expected
that at the nlnso nf tho year both dis
bursements and debts will bo found very
considerably less than has been anticipated.
SECRETARY OF WAR.
Tho report, of tho Secretary of War is
a document of great intorost. It consists
of
1st. Tho military operations of tho
year, detailed in tho report of tho Goner-al-in-chiof.
2d. Tho organization of oolorcd per
sons into tho war services.
3d. Tho oxchango of prisoners of
war, fiillyot forth in thojottor of Gon.
llitckcock.
4th. Operations under the act for en
rolling and calling out tho national for
ces, detailed in the report of tho Provost
Marshal General.
5th. Tho organization of tho Invalid
Corps, and
6th. The operation of tho several
Departments of I ho Quartermaster
General, Commissary General, Paymas
ter General, Chiet of Engineers, Chief
of Ordnanco, and Surgeon Gonoral.
It has appeared impossible to mako a
valuable summary of this roport, oxcopt
such as would be too extended for this
place, and banco I content mytelf in re
ferring your attention to the roport it
self.
THE NAVY.
I
I
Tho duties devolving on the naval sor
vico during tho year, and throughout tho
wholo of this uuhappy ' contest, havo
been discharged with fidelity and emi
nent success. Tho extensive blockade
has been constantly increasing inefficien
cy, as tho navy has expanded. Yet, on
so long a lino, it has so far been impos
sible to entirely suppress illicit trade.
From tho returns received at the Navy
Department, it nppears that moro than
ono thousand vessols havo been captured
sinco tho block-ado was instituted, and
that tho valuo of prizos already sent in
for adjudication amounts to over thirteen
millions of dollars. Tho naval forco of
tho United States consists, at this time,
of fivo hundred and fifty oight vessols,
completed and in the courso of comple
tion, and of these seventy-five aro iron
clad armored stoamors. The ovonts of
the war gives an increased interest and
importance to tho navy, which will prob
ably extend beyond the war itsolf. Tho
armored vessels in our navy, completed
and in service, or which aro tinder con
tract and approaching completion, aro
boliovcd to exceed in number those of
any other Power; but whilo these may
ho reliod upon for harbor dofonso and
soa coast survey, others of groator
strength and capacity will ho necossary
for cruising purposes, and to maintain
our rightful position on tho ocean,
facilities for reaching our distant posses
sions. This policy has received its most
signal and boneficiont illustration in the
recent enactment granting homesteads, to
actual settlers. Since tho first day of
January last tho boforo-mentiouod quan-

provisions. This fact, and the amount
of sales, furnish gratifying ovidence of
l.nds.-not'wituWnding the great struggle
;n t,;d ttm nf d naiinn has
tbp increasing settlement upon publio
in which the enerergy of tho nation has
boon engaged, and which has required so
large a withdrawal of our citizens ram
thoir
ir accuBtoned pursuits, cordially
concnr in tho recommendation of tho Sec'
retary of tho Interior, suggesting a mod'
ificatfon of tho net in favor of thoso on
gaged in tho military and naval servico
of tho Unitod States. I doubt not that
Congress will cheerfully adopt such mea
sures ns will, without essentially chang
ing the goncral foaturcs of the system, re
euro to tho greatest practical oxtent its
benefits to thoso who have loft their homes
in dofonso of tho country in this arduous
crisis. I invito your attoution to tho
views of tho Secretary of War as to the
propriety of raising by appropriation of
the Legislature, a rovonuo from tho min
eral lands of tho United States.
THE INDIANS.
Tho measures provided at your last
session for tbo removal of certain Indian
tribes havo been carriod into effect. Sun
dry treaties havo boen negotiated, which
will in duo timobo submitted for'tbo con
stitutional action of thft-Senate. Thoy
contain stipulations for extinguishing tho
possessors' rights of tho Indians to largo
and valuablo tracts of land. It is prob
ablo that tho effect of these treaties will
result in tho establishment of permanent
friendly relations with such .of thoto
tribes as havo been brought into frequent
and bloody collissions with our outlying
sottlomonts and emigrants. Sound poli
cy and our imperative duty to these wards
of Government, demand our anxious and
constant attention to thoir material well
being, to their progress in tho arts of civ
ilization, and, abovo all, to that moral
training, which, under tho blessings of
Uivino Providonce, will confer upon
thom olevating and sanctifying influen
ces, tho hopes and consolations of the
Christian faith. I BUggostcd in my last
annual mcasago, tho propriety of remod
eling our- Indian system. Subsequent
events havo satisfied mo of its necessity.
Tho details sot forth in tho report of tho
Secretary, will cvinco tho nrgont need for
immediate Legislative action.
I commend tho benevolent institutions
established or patronized by tho Govern
ment in this District to your generous
and fostering caro.
INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
The attention of Congress during tho
last session was engaged to somo extent
with a proposition for onlarging the com
munications between tho Mississippi riv
er and tho North castorn seaboard, which
proposition, however, failed for tho time.
Since then, upon a call of tho greatest
respectability, a convention has been held
at Chicago upon tho Bamo subject,
summary of whose views in a memorial
aauresBea to ine l'resioeni ana uongress,
which I now havo tho honor to lay beforo
you. That this interest is ono which,
erelong, will forco its own way, I do not
entertain a doubt, whilo. it is entirely
submitted to your wisdom as to what can
bo dnnn nnw, .Augmented interest is
given to this suhjoot by the actual com
mencement of work upon tho Pacific
Railroad, undor auspices so favorablo to
its rapid progress and completion, that
enlarged navigation becomes a palpable
need to tho great road.
I transmit tho second annual report of
tho Commissioner of the department of
Agriculturo, asking your attention to tho
developments in that vital interost of tho
nation.
THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.
When Oongross assembled a year ago,
tho war had already lasted nearly twenty
months, and thero had boen many con
flicts on both land and'soa, with varying
results. Tho robollion had been pressed
back into reduced, limits, yet tho tono of
public feeling and opinion at homo ami
abroad was not satisfactory. With oth
or bigns, the popular demons tnen yasx
past, indicated uneasiness among our-
selvos, whilo amid much that was cold,
menacing, the kindost words coming from
Europe wero uttered in accents of pity
that wo wero too blind to surrender. Our
commerco was suffering greatly by n few
armed vessels built upon and furnished
from foreign bhorcs, and we were threat
ened with Buch additions from tho same
quarter as would sweep our trado from
tho sea and raise our blockade. We had
failed to elicit from European Govern
ments anything hopofnl upon this sub
ject. The Emancipation Proclamation
which was issued in bepterabor, was run
ning its assigned period to tho beginning
of tho Now Yoar. A month later the
final proclamation camo, including tho
announcement that colored men of suita
ble condition would be received into the
war bervice. Tho policy of emancipation
and of employing 4laolc sol Jioie, gave to
tho futuro a now aspect about which,
hope, and fear, and doubt contended in
uncortain conflict.
According to our political system, as a
matter of civil administration, tho gen-
oral government bad no lawful power
to offect emancipation in any State; and
for a long timo it had been hoped tho ro
bollion could Do suppressed without re
sorting to it as a military measure. It
was all the whilo dcomed possible- tuat
the necessity for it might come, and that
if it should, tho crisis of tho contest would
then be presented. It camo, and, as we
expected, it was followed by dark and
doubtful days, iiiovcn months naving
been passed, wo aro pormitted to take an
other review. Tho robol borders are
pressed still further back, and by tho
comnleto ODoning of tho Mississippi river
tho country dominated ovor by tho
rebellion, is divided into distant parts
without practical communication between
them. Tennessoo and Arkansas havo
boen substantially cleared of insurgent's
control and influonco, and tho citizens in
each, and owneisof Blavoa and advocates
of slavery at tho beginning of the rebell
ion, now oDenly declare for emoncipation
tn their resnectivo States. Of thoso
States not included in tho Emancipation
Proclamation Maryland and Missouri
neither of which years ago would tolerate
any restraint upon tho oxtonsion ot sla
very into tho new territories, only dis
pute now as to the best uiodo of removing

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
During tho past fiscal year tho finan
cial condition of tho Post Office Depart
ment has boon ono of increasing prosper
ity, and 1 am grotihcd in being ablo to
state that tho recoipts of postal reveauo
havo nearly equalled tho entire expendi
tures, tho lattor amounting to eleven mil
lion thrco hundred and fourteen thousand
dollars and eighty four conts, and tho
former to oleven million ono hundred and
sixty-threo thousand seven huudred and
eighty-nine dollars and nino cents, leav
ing a deficiency of but one hundred and
thirty thousand and four hundred and
seventeen dollars and twenty-hvo cents.
In 1860, tho year immediately preceding
tho rebellion, the dehcicnoy amounted to
$5,656 705.47; tbo pos.tal receipts of that
yoar being 82,645 J22.19 less than thoso
of 1863. Tho decrcaso sinco 18G0 in tho
annual amount of transportation has been
only about 25 per cent, but tho annual
expenditures on account of tho same, has
been reduced a per cent, it is manuosi,
thoreforo, that tho Post Uliico Liepatt
ment may becomo self-sustaining in a few
yoars, oven with tho restoration of tho
whole service. Tho International Con
ference of Postal Delegates from tho prin
cipal countries' of Europe and America,
which wnu-colleu-Tit the suggestion of the
Post Master General, met at Paris on tho
llth of May last, and concluded its de
liberations on tho 8th of June. The
principles established bv tho conference
as best adapted to facilitate postal :nter-
course botween nations, and as a basis of
future conventions to inaugurate a general
system of uniform international charges
at reduced rates of postago, and cannot
fail to produco benohoial results. 1 reier,

PUBLIC LANDS.
Tho quantity ring
tho last and first quartor of the pres
ent fiscal year was threo millions eight
hundred and forty-ono thousand and livo
hundred and fortyniuo acres, of which
161,911 acres wero sold for cash, 1,456,
514 acres woro taken up under the Homo-
stead Law, and the rosiduo disposod of
under laws granting lands for military
bounties, for railroad and other purposes.
It also appears that tho salo of publio
lands is largely on the increaso. It has
long been a chorished opiuion of somo of

we
havo tho reckoning. Tbo crisis
threatened to divido the friends
which
of tho
Uni0n is nasi. Looking now to the mes-
!cntand future, and with referenco to a
resumption of the National authority
having been suspended, I havo thought
fit to issuo a proclamation, a copy of
which is herewith transmitted. On ex
amination of this proclamation it will
appear, as is believed, amply justified by
tbo Constitution. True, the form of an
oath is given, but no man is coerced to

ty is also proftcred that if many ol
the States named a real government (.hall
bo in the modo prescribed, set np, such
government shall bo recognized and guar
anteed by the United States, and that un
der it the State shall on the constitutional
condition bo protected against invasion
and domestic violence
Tbo constitutional obligations of tho
United Statos to guarantee to every State
in tho Union, a Republican form of Gov
ernment, and to protect tho State in tho
cases stated is explicit and fall; bnt why
tender tho benefit of this provision only
to a btato Government set up in this par
ticular way? This section of tho Consti
tntion contemplates a caso wherein tbo
clement within a State favorablo to a He
publican Government in tbo Union, may
be too feeble for an opposito and hostile
element external to end even within the
State, and such aro precisely tho cases
with which wo aro now dealing. An at
tempt to guarantee and protect a revised
Stato Government constructed in wholu
or in preponderating part from tho very
element against whoso hostility and vio
lence it is to be protected, is simply ab
surd. There must bo a test by which to
separate opposing elements, so as to build
only from tho sound, and that test is a
sufficiently liberal one which accepts as
souud whoever will mako a sworn recan
tation of his former unsoundness. But
if it bo proper to require as a test of ad
mission to the political body an oath of
allegiance to the Constitution of tho Uni
tod States and to tho Union undor it, why
also to laws and proclamation in regard
to slavery? Those laws and proclama
tions were enacted and pnt forth for the
purpose of aiding in tho suppression of
tho rebellion. To givo them their fullest
effect, there had to bo a pledge for their
mamtcnanco. in my judgment thoy have
aided and will further aid the causo for
which they were enlisted. To givo up
this principlo would bo not only to relin
quish a levor of power, but would also
bo a cruel and astounding breach ot laitu.
NO RETRACTION.

-
I may add at this point, that while I
remain in my present position I shall not
attempt to retract or modify tho Emanci
pation Proclamation, nor shall I return
to slavery any person who is freo by the
terms of tho Proclamation, or by
any act of Congress. For theso and
other reasons it is thought best that
the support of sons shall be in
cluded in the oath and it is be
lieved that tbo Executive may law
fully claim it in return ior pardon and
restoration of protected rights which he
lias clear constitutional power to withhold
altogether, or grant upon tho terms which
we shall deem wisest for tbo public inter
est. It should be obser.ed that this part
0f tho oath is subiect to tho modifying
ttIlli abrogating power of tbo legislation
anj supremo and judicial decision. Tho
proposed acquicsrenco of the Natianal
Executivo in any honorable tomporary
gato arrangement for the 'freed peoplo,'
is mado with tho view of possibly modi
fying tho confusion and destitution which
must attend all classes by a total revolu
tion of labor throughout wholo States.
It is hoped that the already deeply afiiie
tod pooplo in thoso States may bo somo
what more ready to-givo up tho causo of
their affliction, and to this extent, this
vital matter is left to them telves,
whilo no power of tho National Execu
tivo to prevent an abuso is abridged by
tho proposition. Tho suggestion in tho
Proclamation as to maintaining tho polit
ical framework of tbo States, or what is
called reconstruction, is made in tho hopo
that it may do good without tho dangor
of harm. It will savo labor and avoid
great confusion, hot why any proclaraa
tion now udod this subiect ?
This question is bosct with tho conflic
