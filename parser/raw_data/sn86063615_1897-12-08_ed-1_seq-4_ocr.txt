THE PARIS EI,OSITIO APPROPHI
ATIOY. President McKinley. In his message, has
again calle-d attention to the necessity of
mjking a large appropriation for the pur
pose of furnishing an adequate represent
ation of this countrj's resources and in
dustries at the Paris exposition, to be held
In MOO. The president points out the fact
that since the appointment of a special
commissioner it has developed tint un
usual Interest prevails among those who
arc expected to furnish our exhibits, and
that In consequence much larger space has
been secured and much greater conces
sions have been promised than it was
originally supposed would be necessary.
As the Paris exposition Is designed to
represent the progress of the worjd dur
ing the century, no other nation Is en
titled to greater consideration and no
other should etlncc greater pride than the
United States, which has made larger
strides In dev clopment than any other na
tion of the world during the present or any
previous century.
While it may be necessary to observe
economical lines in making the appro
priations for this j car, there should be no
small policy in providing all the funds
necessary to facilitate In every consistent
way the representation of this country at
the Paris exposition. Here we shall be in
direct competition with every other na
tion In the world. The exposition appro
priation should not be one of the allow
ances to suffer by suggested economy.
ABOLISH THE CAUSE.
There Is one way, and only one way, to
stop these heavy Judgments constantly be
ing rendered against the city on account of
injuries from defective sidewalks. Every
board sidewalk ought to be condemned and
removed. A large portion of the property
owners have been compelled to put down
stone walks, and there is no good reason
vhy the rest should bo favored at public
expense. Damages are being piled up
against the city at a rate which will In a
short time amount to an appalling total.
There is no escaping Judgments of this
character. It is tho city's duty to see that
sidewalks are in good condition, and when
it fails in this duty and Injuries result It
has to pay the bill, and rightfully so.
There is never any assurance that a board
walk will be in good condition a week
ahead, after It is a few months old.
M'.YALL AXD THE TRAVELERS.
While waiting for Superintendent McXall
to say something or do something In the
matter of the Xew Tork Life Insurance
Company which, according to McXall's own
showing, is doing business in defiance of
the Kansas laws. It may perhaps be In
teresting to take up the case of another
Eastern insurance company which has
been having a great deal of trouble with
the Kansas superintendent.
Some months ago Mr. McXall asserted
through the public prints that he had rea
son to believe that the Travelers Com
pany of Connecticut had misrepresented its
affairs; that its assets were not what the
officials reported them to be; that it was
padding Its resources with worthless prop
erties, and that, in short, the Kansas de
partment suspected the companj's solv
ency. At tho bamo time Mr. McXall an
nounced his intention of proceeding to
Hartford for tho purpose of making an
examination along tho line of his suspi
cions. '
At this point President Battcrson, of tho
Travelers, broke into the case with tho
statement that while his company had no
objections lo such an examination it must
be made at the expense of the state. In
support of this posltlonlhc named a num
ber of instances where 'the agents of Mc
Xall had irtually blackmailed Insurance
ccmpanles out of a great deal of money
under the pretense of making examinations
and finished by declaring that the Travel
ers was not In the blackmail btisiness. At
tho same time the attorneys for the Trav
elers went into tho ,UnIted States court
at Topeka and asked for an injunction to
pi event the examination proposed by tho
Kansas official. The court failed to sustain
tho Travelers view of the case and de
cided that tho examination might be made
at the discretion of Mr. McXall.
On Saturday Mr. McXall r-gain went Into
print. He caused to bo published a letter
which he had written to President Hitler-
son, in which that official was Informed
that some time after the 1st of next March
tho KannJ department would make an
examination of the Travelers affairs. That
Is to say, four months heme the public
will be able to learn whether or not the
company Is In a solvent or insolvent
condition, and In tho meantime It mav con
tinue to take the hard earned dollars of
Kansas ptople for Insurance which maj
or may not be good. To a casual observer
this would ecm to be a most extraordinary
proceeding, or. rather, lack of proceeding.
rMr. McXall has informed the pople of
Kansas that he his grave reasons for be
lieving this Insurance company to be in
solvent, and jet lie sets a far off date for
determining facts that mnv serve for their
protection. Under such circumstances any
citlzcn of Kansas who loses money throjgh
an insurance company ought to have re
course upon the state for placing such an
Inefficient ofliclal In power.
It will not do to assume, however, that
Mr. McXall Is so thoughtless of tho wel
fare of his own peorlo aR to leave them
to be prejed upon for so long a time by
I 'an unsojnd Insurance companj. and jet
we mutt accept this view or turn to an
other Infinitely more discreditable. This
alternative is the belief that Mr. MeXall
Hit. ROBERTS Ah. SOCIOLOGY.
In a recent sermon att lcking the death
penalty and pleading for mercv for a mur
derer now awaiting execution in this coun
ty, the pastor of the Church of This World
sought to strengthen his position by an
appeal to .sociological theorj. His argu
nent may be brie 11 stated thus: That
society is an aggregation of individuals,
possessing sllch powers onl as each Indi
vidual has voluntarily delegated to It: th it
the stream cannot rise higher than Its
source, and that, therefore, the taking of
1 uman life, being wrong for an individual,
is wrong for soelet. and "the Judge and
js-ry are accessories before the fact."
Xow, the fict that a man Is honestl
Pleading for humanity and ihampioning the
cause of the friendless and the weak does
not relieve him from the thralldom of
facts, or place his conclusions bevond ic-vicw-
by the intelligent thought of his da.
Tho Journal does not underestimate the
importance of giving an Ignorant criminal
an equal chance with more favored evil
doers, but some other things are important,
too. It is important that the members of
n.odern society should understand the fun
damental laws of the structure of which
they form a part, and enlightenment on the
subject of capital punishment will come
at too dear a price if It prove necessary
to swallow a one-sided and vicious theory
of all social obligations In order to get it.
When such teaching as the foregoing Is
given from high places, it behooves the
thoughtful man to look well to the founda
tions. The theory outlined above is slmply
Rousseau's "social contract" theorj-; it
was considered good sociologj- 120 jears
ago. It represented the social relation
simply as one of bargain and sale; each
irdividual came to society with so much
power, and traded off a certain part for
certain social goods which he desired. The
man dissatisfied with his bargain might go
back on it, cut himself off from society,
and retire with his capital.
Traces of this doctrine appear in the
Declaration of Independence. Although not
a complete social theorj-, it had the ad
vantage of killing that evil microbe, the
divine right of klrgs, and our forefathers,
needing such an Intellectual germicide, saw
it in this teaching, and used it like good
Yankees. But the theory is vicious and
one-sided. It justifies the anarchist who
wishes to repudiate the claims of society
upon him, and It comes to the Ignorant and
unfortunate man, ground under the heel of
evil Institutions, and sajs: "You have no
cause of complaint; jou are a party to
the social contract; jour ejes were open
when jou made It. Talk of jour rights!
If you are sick of jour bargain, draw out
jour capital and retire!" The social con
tiact theory-of society has therefore broken
down utterlj-. It is held to-day, so far as
we know, only by the pastor of the Church
of This World.
Tho relation of man to society Is not a
relation of contract. It Is a relation of
life. Society Is not an organization: It is
an organism. The new-born Infant comes
Into societj- not to m.iko a bargain, but
to grow into recognition of a vital tie.
Society protects babies from smallpox and
scarlet fever and hunger and ignorance.
They have not bargained with society: the
relation Is as that of the parent and the
child.
Man Is not a party to societj; he is a
part of It. A carpenter, for example. Is a
man who has been so shaped bj- social
forces, set In motion centuries ago. that
he has knowledge of work in wood, and
that onlj-, and must depend on society for
a'l else. He cannot get on alone. Con
tract Implies freedom, and a man helpless
without society is not free in his relation
to it.
Societj- is an organism. We have grown
into It so that we are helpless without
it. Alone, the civilizd man is weaker than
the savage. His life Is bound up in that
of societj-.
Hence, the state's right to punish. Pun
ishment of crime Is society fighting In self
defense. Its right to protect its own life
cannot be impugned. An individual may
take life In defense of his own; so may
societj-.
Tho question of the death penalty must
b fought out on the lines indicated. Is It
necessary to the self-preservation, of the
social organism? This Is a fair question
for discussion, but It will never be settled
by representing an ignorant negro as a
worsted bargainer with societj-, and re
ducing the highest relations of life to a
commercial formula. All necess irj reforms
in our penology can surely be secured with
out going back almost a centurj- and a half
to invoko an exploded social theorj-, orig
inated for polemical purposes, which has
proved too weak to bear the strain of rea
son and fact.
are about J32.O0O.O00 in excess of those last
placed before congress.
While these expenditures contemplate
large public improvements, the expediency
of all and the necessity of many of which
are manifest, it Is the dutj of congress
to follow the pollcj of the president in
guarding against deficits that might be
avoided bv rigid cconomj-. It may be con
fidently expected that this policy will bo
urged in ever- consistent waj b the pres
ident, for It Is in keeping with his busi
ness sagacit and his conservative meth
ods The revenues of the government have
bec:i for months, and will be for some
months to come, conslderablj less than
the normal operations of our tariff law
would make them. The rush of Importa
tions to head off the Dingier law stocked
the countr.v with m.inv commodities that
brought little or no revenue under the
Wilson law. but which will ield large rev
enues when the present supplies are ex
hausted. That Is the reason, and the only
reason, that there is an necesslt for

THE PRESIDENT AD ECONOMY.
The concluding recommendation of Pres

the expenditures of the government easily
within the limits of its revenues. The ad

like protection, but
don't like tho gold standard. Some Demo

Just as many of the friends of Major
Inman expected, a Kansas paper Ins seized
the occasion of the major's sudden jump
Into prominence as an author to recite the
story that he had been cashiered from his
position in the United States arm v. And.
as might also have been expected, the stor
Is recited without such a fair explana
tion as will leave the major In the proper
light before the public.
Before the war Major Inman was a pri
vate in the Sixth United States Infantry.
Xot long after the firing upon Fort Sum
ter he was commissioned a lieutenant in
the volunteer armv, and. before the war
closeel, had been promoted to the rank of
major for soldierly conduct. At the re
organization of the army shortly after 1SB5
ho was commissioned in the regular ser
vice and became quartermaster at several
different posts From 1SC7 to 1S70 he was
depot quartermaster at Fort Harker in
Kansas, and was chief in that branch to
General Sheridan who. In 1S6S. conducted
the Indian campaigns in Western Kansas.
In this capacltv- he was in charge of an
enormous amount of property. He had
control of huge wagon trains and crent
shipments of stores to the other forts along
the border. Hid best friends have never
claimed for him that he was possessed of
large business capacity, and it is not sur
prising, then, that confusion made its ap
pearance in his quartermaster accounts.
Certain stores to a large amount became
missing without being accounted for, and
at last. In 1S70 we think, he was summoned
before a court-martial at Fort Harker,
where he was found guilty and sentenced
to dismissal from the army. It was not In
evidence that Major Inman had appropri
ated an thing to himself; in fact. It was
pretty thoroughly established that he had
been roblied by subordinates, but he was
the responsible officer and was forced to
suffer the consequences.
Senator Plumb once told a Kansas friend
that he had interested the secretary of
war in Major Inman's ca-e and that tho
secretary had made an investigation with
the result of agreeing to recommend to
congress the major's reinstatement. Ho
would not agree, however, to recommend
that tho major should receive back pay for
the time during w hlch he had been deorivert
of it or that he should be placed upon the
paj roll In the future. While nothing had
been adduced to touch the honor of tne dis
missed officer ihero was sufficient evidence
of culpable carelessness to stand in the way
of the complete restoration proposed. In
man Insisted upon .a complete restoration
and the matter was dropped without pre
sentation to congress
Tho sale of Major Inman's book continues
without abatement. The third edition of
10,000 copieb will soon be Issued and it is
the opinion of his publishers that 40,000
copies will have been sold within a
ear. This means $12.fti0 to the author,

Inman and Buffalo Bill will mike its ap
pearance earn in the coming summer. The
manuscript is now about half prepared. It
will deal with tho old Silt Lake trail, tak

Logan Ridge, a section of country south
of Ozark, has become a great peach or
chard. Last summer the fruit crop was
large and peach seeds, of course, were
abundant In that locality, but no one at
that time thought of putting them to any
valuable use. As the weather grew cooler
and the annual demanel for winter fuel
began to be felt, someone discovered that
peach seeds would burn and yield more
heat than ordinary combustible material.
Xow the denizens of Logan Ridge warm
themselves around fires fed by the handy
peach stones.

The final nr.d decisive proof as to wheth
er prosperity has returned was sure to be
given when winter began. During v arm
and mild weather there Is much out-of-door
work to be done even In hard time, and
the unemployed also can endure, privation
much easier. But with the coming of cold
weather manv- resources are cut off at tho
same time that the cost of living Is In
creased. Then comes the real test. If
business Is prosperous and Industr Is pro
ceeding at its normal rate there will bo
a moderate increase of the applicants for
charity at the beginning of winter, but If
bid times prevail the demands on chanty
will be sudden and alarming.
How- does the present season bear this
test? There is no better point to judge
from than Chicago That city felt tho full
force of the disastrous times which fol
lowed the beginning of the Cleveland ad
ministration and the result was evident
there all through the Democratic attempt
eo fsiaoiisn a low ear in policy. The ac
cumulated result was felt last winter when
thousands of people who a few ears ago
had been In comfortable circumstances were
compelled to appeal for assistance. The
long strain of four jears of depression had
exhausted their resources and left them
no recourse but charity. These people added
to tho usual number seeking help made the
destitution in Chicago appalling. Extra ex
ertions and appeals had to be made to
prevent deaths by starvation.
This was tho situation one jear ago. How
does it compare with the situation to-day?
The Chicago Times-Herald said the; other

A new form of railway has lecn tricel on
a sm ill scale in Bavaria, and Is soon to
bo o;encd for regular service. In th!-. sys
tem the force of traction, which is derived
from a balloon. Is directed vertically up
ward. A single T-shaped rail directs tho
cour-e of the train and keeps the balloon
with its -load captive. The car grips the
rail from the sides and from below. The
rail is anchored to the ground .it distances
of about fifteen feet. Gravity is the pro
pelling force in the descent, and the bal
loon acts as a check, preventing accelerated
motion. The truck carries a water recei
tacle, which can be opened bv- aeronauts
on a Journey, and which provides any
addltlonal downward force reemlred. The
difference In weight caused oy passengers
entering or leaving the car Is regulated by
uslng separate weights, a number of wnlch
will be kept at each station. The testa
of tho sstem have been so favnmble that
the inventors are preparing to build a sim
ilar line to run up the Hochstauffen to
Bad Riechenhall, Bavaria.

The frame of a horse Is constructed on an

are attached to the mouth of the horse.
By pulling these, the driver causes the an
imal to turn In anv desired direction- The
maximum speed of this strange steed is
six miles an hour. Tho device has been
operated successfully attached by thills to
a two-wheeled road cart. A gasoline mo
tcr is mounted on the wheel, which has .i
tire four inches wide. Two sprocket chains
run horizontally, while a third operates
perpendicularly, running over a thlrteen
iridi sprocket, attached to the front wheel,
and a four-inch sprocket, fastened to a
shaft directly over it. The machine weighs
7C pounds, but the Inventor expects to re
duce the weight to about "KO pounds.
