Loss of S500 in New Town by Blaze
in Hotel.
Geddes, S. D., Dec. 5.—Geddes ex
perienced its first lire, which originated
in a rear room of the Kittorman hotel
yesterday. The room was sued for
storing furniture and bedding and the
fire started in some mattresses, prob
ably from spontaneous combustion.
In the absence of water works a
bucket brigade was formed and soon
had the flames under control. The
happening will serve as a spur to urge
the speedy completion of the water
works system authorized by recent
election. The loss is placed at $500,
fuiiy covered by insurance.

sentenced from Lawrence county on a
robbery charge.
The governor refused to follow the
recommendation of the board in the

by the court at the time sentence was
passed on a plea of guilty.

MITCHELL, SOUTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6,1901.
NEW TANGLE IN
THE LAND OFFICE
The "Commuters" on Yankton
Reserve Furnish a Dif
ficult Problem.
UNDER MISAPPREHENSION
Didn't Understand the Law, and Now
Cannot Get Back Their Money
Nor Secure Title to
Land.
Armour, S. D., Dec. 4.—It seems that
the government officials at Washing
ton do not know just what course to
pursue in regard to the parties who
commuted their land on the Yankton
reservation in ignorance of the law
which required the additional payment
of $2 per acre, after having already
paid $1.25 per acre in order to make
proof. They are now asking to be re
instated in their rights in order that
they may live out the full five years
before making proof. Assistant Com
missioner W. A. Richards has written
a letter to Attorney J. W. Lindsay at
Geddes, in which he says:
"You ask this office to advise you
how to proceed in order to secure for
such settlers the return of $1.25 per
acre paid by them and the privilege
of perfecting their entries by five
years' residence. In reply, I have to
state that in the absence of an actual
case before this office I cannot express
an opinion in the premises, and can
only say that should the settlors re
ferred to by you present application
for the repayment of the money paid
by them respectively on their several
entries and ask permission to perfect
the same under section 2291, R. S., af
ter the expiration of the full period of
five years' residence upon the entered
land, such applications would be duly
considered and disposed of in accord
ance with the facts and law relating
thereto."
PROSPECT OF CONTEST.
Two Companies After Electric Car
Line Franchise in Sioux Falls.
Sioux Falls, S. D., Dec. 4.—Some time
ago Colonel Chase, an eastern pro
asked for a franchise for an electric
line between this city and Madison
asked for a franchise for a nelectric
line on the streets of this city. Last
June Hon. H. H. Natwick and other
residents of Sioux Falls secured a
franchise for a central heating, lighting
and power plant, and at the meeting
of the city council last evening Mr.
Natwick had an amended ordinance
Introduced giving his company the ad
ditional rights of putting in an elec
tric street line. This amended or
dinance was referred to a committee.
This action on the part of the Nat
wick company undoubtedly, means a
fight between the Natwick and Chase
forces for the city franchise. Mr.
Chase has claimed all along that his
suburban line would not pay without
the local line nor would the local line
pay without the suburban line. If the
city gets an up-to-date electric line
out of the scrap no one will care par
ticularly which company secures the
franchise.

Sioux Falls, Dec. 4.—Fred B. Smith of

to collect the $15,000 of what he claims
is due the state in back taxes from the
order for doing business in South Da
kota. J. T. Smith, chairman of the
committee on laws of the grand lodge,
and French & Orvis of Yankton, have
been retained to look after the lodge's
interest. If is hoped that the matter
can be so arranged to have it submit

date.

Mitchell, S. D., Dec. 2.—The jury in

AWOKE TO DIE.
Death of the Famous Sleeper ol
Kansas.
Hiawatha, Kan., Dec. 5.—J. S. Lytle,
a Kansas pioneer, died here this morn
ing. His sickness lasted three years
and was particularly noticeable in that
he slept most of the time. While in
Santa Ana, Cal., he slept from May 2S
to August 20. He was brought home
early in September and has been sleep
ing continuously since the second day
of that month. He died a few minutes
after awakening from his last sleep.
During his long sleep he was fed by
means of a rubber tube.
HAS LOST $12,000,000
Copper King Lav/son Says the
Squeeze Has Cost Him
That Sum.
Chicago, Dec. 5.—A Boston special to
the Tribune says:
The squeeze in copper has cost Thos.
W. Lawson $12,000,000. This statement
is based on his own admissions.
To Boston financiers Mr. Lawson's
position is a puzzle. As a friend, he is
frank and open as the air as a specu
lator he is usually as silent and mys
terious as the sphinx, even to his inti
mates.
There has been an apparently well
founded belief the last week that Law
son had disposed of lis holdings of
242,000 shares of Amalgamated and that
he was now on the right side of the
market. These mental speculations
were jarred when Mr. Lawson issued
an open letter, in which he said ve
hemently that he had not disposed of
his stock, and, further, that no mortal
man could get it, even if it went to $1
a share.
So, taking Mr. Lawson's statement
that he holds 242,000 shares of Amalga
mated and that his losses when the
stock sold at 88 were $7,000,000, it would
seem that he has suffered a further
shrinkage of $3,872,000, or a total of
nearly $12,000,000 in one stock.
For several days wild gossip has been
current regarding the Amalgamated
Copper company, and the markets of
two continents have been used to
achieve some secret purpose. What
that purpose may be is a subject for
conjecture.
The Industrial side is a simple one.
The proposition is thus: There has
been an overproduction of copper,
which Amalgamated people are seek
ing to offset by curtailing the output of
certain mines which they control. The
overproduction arises from reduced
foreign consumption and from the high
nominal price. This overproduction,
even considered from the highest claim
of surplus, is not large, but stock spec
ulation has magnified it many times.
The visible supply in this country is
mostly invisible and is purposely kept
so. There is practically no visible sup
ply of merchantable copper in England
and France.
The domestic situation justifies a
good price for copper. It may be 17
cents or 16 cents or 15 cents. The for
eign situation justifies a price some
cents lower, perhaps 14 cents, or 13
cents, or 12 cents. European consum
ers are in about the same attitude, yet
would buy freely if the price was
stable.
The Amalgamated people appear to
be antagonizing the copper industry by
their endeavor to maintain a higher
price than the .world at large can af
ford to pay, and in doing this they are
limiting consumption and stimulating
production the world over.
Wall street in New York and State
street perceives all of these things and
many more. They perceive the specu
lative side of the enterprise. They are
jnindful of the overcapitalized position
of the Amalgamated company. The
promoters of the concern capitalized a
boom and made many enemies by the
manner of doing It. The company itself
has supplied the speculative world
with all the material needed for a
speculative campaign.
It is impossible to throw the clear
light upon the mass of report and ru
mor now current. What amount of
copper is being sold and the price ar6
surrounded with considerable doubt,
but the indications are that three
quarters of what is said is baseless.
Copper has been sold in a small way at
17 cents within a few days. It would
probably relieve the tension tremen
dously if the Amalgamated people
would dismount from their monopoly
horse and put copper down to a price
more in harmony with the world's
trade condtions.

Congress Manifests Keen In

State Paper.
THE INSULAR DECISIONS
Cabinet Considers Supreme Court's
Latest Opinions in Regard to.
Relations With New
Possessions.
Washington, Dec. 5.—In anticipation
pf the receipt of the first message of
.President Roosevelt, the members of
the senate and house assembled early.
(Despite a cold, penetrating rain, the
galleries were well filled with interested
'(spectators.
At 12 o'clock Speaker Henderson
•called the house to order. After the
journal was read and approved, Mr.
Cooper of Texas, and Mr. Wood of Cali
fornia, who were not present yester
day, were sworn in.
On motion of Mr. Payne, floor lead
er of the majority, it was agreed that
when the house adjourned today it be
until Friday.
The speaker announced the appoint
ment of a committee on rules as fol
lows: Henderson, Dalzell, Grosvenor,
.Richardson and Underwood of Ala
bama.
Close Attention to Message.
Mr. Bingham of Pennsylvania, at the
head of the committee appointed to
wait upon the president, reported that
the committee, accompanied by a like
committee from the senate had per
formed its duty and the president said
he would at once communicate with
the two houses in writing. Two minutes
later Major Pruden appeared at the
main entrance and announced the mes
sage from the president. Speaker Hen
derson handed the document to the
reading clerk and directed him to read
it. Ordinarily presidential messages at
the opening of congress are listened to
in a perfunctory fashion, but today
throughout the reading the keenest in
terest was manifested. Hardly a mem
ber left his seat until the reading was
concluded. There was a slight mur
mur of applause when in concluding his
recommendation for legislation to put
down anarchy the clerk read:
"No matter calls more urgently for
the wisest thought of congress."
There was a burst of applause when
the clerk read:
"The American people are slow tc
wrath, but when their wrath is once
kindled it burns like a consuming
flame."
Probably no other portion of the mes
sage attracted so much attention as
that relating to trusts. No demonstra
tion was evoked by reading this portion
of the message, but the recommenda
tion for the -re-enactment of the Chi
nese exclusion law drew aplause from
both sides of the house.
The reading of the message was con
cluded in the house at 2:35. Mr. Gros
venor then offered a resolution of re
spect to the late president similar tc
the one adopted by the senate. The
resolution was adopted and the house
then, as a further mark of respect, ad
journed.
In the Senate.
In the senate, after some routine busi
ness was transacted, Major Pruden, as
sistant secretary to the president, pre
sented the message of the president,
the reading of which was begun at
once by Chief Clerk Rose. Close at
tention was given to the reading by all
the senators.
The reading of the message consumed
two hours and fifteen minutes. When
it was completed Senator Foraker of
fered the following resolution:
"That a committee of eleven senators
be appointed to join such committee as
shall be appointed on the part of the
house to consider and report by what
token of respect and affection it may
be proper for the congress of the Unit
ed States to express the deep sensibil
ity of the nation to the tragic death of
the late president, 'William McKinley
and that so much of the message of the
president as relates to that deplorable
event be referred to such committee.
The resolution was adopted, and then,
as a further mark of respect to the
memory of the late president, the sen
ate adjourned.
CAB NET MEETING.
Insular Decisions the Chief iTopic ol
Discussion.
Washington, Dec. 5.—The time of the
cabinet meeting today was principally
consumed in a discussion of the insular
decisions handed down yesterday by
the supreme court. On the whole, it la
believed that the view of the majority
of the court is quite satisfactory to the
administration. It was pointed out that
the ultimate results of the decisions are
in a measure speculative at present,
with the exception that customs duties
collected in this country on goods
shipped from the Philippines since the
ratification of the Paris treaty will have
to be refunded. It is not thought the
aggregate will be large. Secretary
Gage expects it will be within $1,000,000.
The present tariff now in operation in
the Philippines, Gage thinks, will need
little or no revision. The preparation
of a tariff on Philippine importations
into the United States, however, Is ex
pected to consume considerable time of
congress.

NUMBER 9.
COMMENT ON MESSAGE.
Press Opinion in Berlin Is Mostly
Commendatory.
Berlin, Dec. 5.—The message of Pres
ident Roosevelt caused a mild thrill in
Germany. On the bourse, where it was
eagerly awaited, the message was re
ceived with uncommon interest and the
market generally was slightly stimu
lated upon the posting of a bulletin
containing President Roosevelt's utter
ances about trusts. The shares of the
steamship companies fell one or two
points on account of the immigration
inspection paragraph and the proposed
development of the merchant marine.
Several financial journals aver that
there is no reason why the United
States should encourage ship building.
They say that if the United States be
comes possessed of a commercial fleet
she will have to build it, inasmuch as
the attempts to buy German lines o£
steamers have been defeated.
President Roosevelt's words concern
ing the restriction of immigration con
tain an unpleasant suggestion in the
present state of depression, where, as
the Berliner Volks Zeitung says, the
hard times make an overflow of the
laboring population of Europe neces
sary. The free trade and liberal news
papers welcome the reciprocity recom
mendations, but regret that President
Roosevelt did not recommend a spe
cific tariff reduction.
The first impression of the president
message in German official circles is
that the repression of anarchists by
international agreement is much more
likely to be carried through upon the
initiative of the United States than by
that of any other power.
An anti-anarchist proposition from
Germany along the same lines as that
of President Roosevelt is probably al
ready on its way to the state depart
ment at Washington.
The Vosslsche Zeitung says the pres
ident's message indicates that the feet
of the United States are well in the
imperialistic path, and that ventures
abroad seem to agree with them.
The National Zeitung alludes 'to the
strong and confident tone used by
President Roosevelt, and to his large
purposes.
Taking the message altogether it has
been favorably received, both popularly
and officially. The references it con

British Comment.
London, Dec. 5.—The London daily
papers this morning, looking at Presi
dent Roosevelt's message from the
point of view of its literary power and
the wealth of weighty matters dis
cussed, regard it as one of the most
characteristic and remarkable mes
sages ever sent to congress. At the
same time the papers recognize its
conservative and businesslike modera
tion, and that no attempt has been
made, as the Morning Post remarks,
"to strike an attitude or to carry his
listeners away."
On the whole, however, the newspa
pers are skeptical of any great outcome
from the president's efforts in the di
rection of reform of the trusts, anti
anarchism or reciprocity, the idea be
ing that the senate will effectually
step in and prevent any great changes
in the existing system.
Most of the papers remark upon the
tone of exultation adopted by Presi
dent Roosevelt in dealing with the
canal question, but they do not show
the slightest disposition to cavil there
at.
The Daily Telegraph says it would
have been an inconceivably disastrous
blunder to have opposed America's
wishes in this matter, and to thus have
driven her to build a still greater fleet
than she already contemplates, which
it Is safe to predict will twenty years
hence make the United States the sec
ond sea power in the world.
The Telegraph thinks that President
Roosevelt's policy is calculated rather
to diminish than to increase European
dread of "the American danger."
The Standard comments upon the
president's uncompromising assertion
of the Monroe doctrine as somewhat
unnecessary inasmuch as there is little
desire on the party of any foreign pow
er to extend its area of militarism to
the new world.
The Daily Chronicle hopes that al
though President Roosevelt shows
great tenderness for protectionist sus
ceptibilities, his proposed policy is a
step in the direction of free trade.
COLOMBIAN. SITUATION.
Peace Commission Starts for the
Interior.
Colon, Colombia, Dec. 5.—According
to news just received here the interior
of the country is almost entirely quiet.
Only a few scattered and insignificant
insurgents bands are here and they are
waging guerrilla warfare. This causes
the government no anxiety.
A peace commission has started for
the interior to obtain an interview with
Generals Diaz and Lugo and to induce
them to give up the struggle and re
turn to Panama.
The guard of American marines,
which has been stationed in front of
the offices of the railroad company
here, has been withdrawn. A small de
tail of marines still accompany the
passenger trains across the isthmus.
Both ends of the isthmus are orderly
and quiet.
Among the prominent persons killed
on the government side during the re
cent engagements on the isthmus were
Colonel Manue) Pachon, Captain Da
nian Espinosa, Major Molinares and
Everado Paredes.
Just prior to the capture of Colon
the liberal Generals Cortiza and Catrl
ani were drowned in an imprudent at
tempt in a small boat and through a
rough and high sea to reach, surprise
and seize the Colombian gunboat Gen
eral PInzon. On the side of the liberals
General Sa,n Zuniga was killed in the
Culebra engagement.
Among the non-combatant and gov
ernment officials killed in Colon were
Senor Muskus, chief of the department
of hacienda (finance), and Senor .Taon,
judge of the criminal court.
The total number of killed and
wuunded on both sides is estimated at
about 400.
Colon, Dec. 2.—The city of Panama
continues quiet. Following General Al
ban's orders, the Columbian gunboat
Boyaca, towing a launch for use of sol
diers, left Panama. The destination of
this expedition is reported to be Agua
Dulce. From this point the government
soldiers will attempt to clear the re
maining bands of liberals from the de
partment of Panama. General Belisario
Porras, the liberal leader, is supposed.
to be in the vicinity of Agua Dulce.
