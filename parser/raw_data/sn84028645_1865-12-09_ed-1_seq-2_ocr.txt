How the Abolition Press View
President Johnson's Message.
Generally throughout the country the
Abolition press, from the extreme radical
down to the most conservative of the con
seryatlve, greet the Tresident's message
with great satisfaction. They speak of it
as a well written, able state paper. It is
very trite that many of them do not concur
with the President on the subject of "re
construction;" but they are pleased with
the manner in which he urges these views
the absence of an emphatic avowal of
maintaining them and in his turning the
whole subject over to Congress they And a
perfect placer of satisfaction. Tbe Chicago
Republican, which is one ot the most in
tensely radical, as well as one of tbe most
ably conducted Abolition journals in the
country, eoncladed its review of the mes
sage with this paragraph :
"Upon, the whole, we think the country,
in view of the doubts and uncertainties of
the past six mouths, will feel very grateful
lor the message. It is exceedingly well
written, and betrays that earnest thought
and deliberation which is characteristic of
the President. It will prove more gratify
ing because of the total absence of any
spirit of resistance or defiance to the well
known wishes of the people in the matter
of reconstruction, and because, therefore,
it promises tuo utmost harmony between
tbe Executive and tbe National Legisla
ture." v " i ;-
CoL Fobkky, in bis review of the message,
ascends into, the third heaven .of joy over
it, and be exclaims :
Itrafty flot fully satisfy 'what are called
'extreme men,', but it eatlslies everybody
who looks to a permanent and harmonious
adjustment of our national ' dittlcultiea.
Above ali, th ; President Wiktt' argument
against the possible platform of hit party
friends. 1 He does'not cf'n'tate' td "Congress.
' He submits a plain Statement ot the history
of events, and. tells tbe manner-in which
his remedies nave resulted, and then he
leaves the whole subject to 'the considera
tion of the representatives of the people
thut binding the national U nion party indissol'
ubly and ruter natty, iitsurttiy Us continued as
tendency in the administration of the General
Government.-" ..-'.
The If tie fork tribune1 1 gratified with it,
except on the poiut of reorganization, and it
gives Its opposition to that point ia the fol
lowing language t ' r , ' " , '
"On a single point, we non-concur with
the President. Ills assertion that, If he bad
assumed to extend the right of suffrage to
blacks in the States lately in revolt, he must
have done the same with all tbe States, is
clearly mistaken, as Mr. Johnson must see,
if he will vary the form without varying
the essence of his Dronositlon. no' that it
shall reftd 'It I had assumed to appoint
Provisional (governors lor toe States lately
In revolt. 1 must nave appointed such Uov
ernors lor all the States.' His light to med
die at all with the Internal polity of any
State, sprang from the participation of that
State that is, of its chosen representatives
and rulers la the slaveholders' rebellion.
Delaware is a very small State, and not an
eminently loyal one; yet the President has
no more right to provide her with a Gov
ernor than to endue her. with a Chief Jus
tin and Legislature; ' ' j"-r )'
f Wt do not care to chop logic with those
who, insist that no ttote has ever gone oat
ot the Union; If it means only that all the ter
ritory included within the area of the United
States, as dtiii jeJ by its Constitution and by
treaties. made since in pursuance thereof,
has remained and still remains within the
Union, o matter though, temporarily ia
tbe power of an invading or insurgent
force, we do not care to object; But if any
one chooses to assert that the body politic
and corporate known to the world as the
State of Georgia or of Mississippi has not
been alienated from1 and at war with the
Ualou, we must be allowed to bold a con
trary opinion That it had no right to en
ter into any treaty, alliance or confedera
tion,' we well know; that it did what it was
thus precluded from lawfully doing, we
also know. The dialectics which prove that
no State has been outol the Union would as
easily demonstrate that no man ever com
mitted burglary or forgery, hecsnsemone
had any right to do aught of the sort; . ,
"The Conntitutlon and Government re
spectively of ten States were perverted to
the u8of treason, and thereby overthrown.
The Union 'repossessed' those. UU Jy
the StroHg arm. It acquired thereby the.
right to insist that their framework of gov
ernment and polity should be purged of
' wh&tevef ha3 oeen proved inimical to Its
own existence, safety and tranquility. 'And
if the President, either directly or through
his Provisional Governor, had summoned
the whote people of each State whether
previously enfranchised or not to choose
delegates to frame and Submit a new
Constlution, adapted to their changed cir
cumstances, he would have been amply jus
tified In so doing, and would have had as
clear authority for it as for appointing a
Provisional Governor, and prescribing cer
tain fundamental bases of reconstruction.
"To talk of relerrlng the suff rage ques
tion to the States, is to darken counsel by
"dextrous phrases. Theobvious question,
'Who constitute the State?' at once shows
that the difficulty is not solved but evaded.
To submit this fundamental question to all
the peop le of the State, is very well; to sub
m it it totliat portion only of the people who
hnve, with hardly an exception, beeu reb
els, and allow thum to punish the steadfast
Unionists by rigorous disfranchisement and
proscription, is not well. And if 'good
faith requires' of the Union 'the security of
the rreedmen in their liberty and their
property, their right to labor,' and its Just
recompense, then it must be that we have
power to compass these ends by enfranchise
ment, since nothing short of this will provo
effective. Good faith cannot require us to
achieve an end whereof the means are be
yond our power." " '
Looking upon the message as having turn
ed ' everything pertaining to tbe reorgan
ization and reconcilement of tbe South over
to Congress, the labors of the Radical press
will be devoted to backing the Senators and
Representatives thereof up in, the most
Radical measures. They at. present see
their way clear, the message having thrown
no impedluifrt into It. . From the President
they apprehend no balk, whether truly or
not remains for tbe future to disclose.
Meanwhile, Democrats and Conservatives
generally will share the following implied
regret expressed by the New York Evening
Post, a journal that has for nearly; a life
time been devoted to an advocacy of the an-tl-
slavery cause, though it eschews the rad
icalism and madness that seem to rule the
counsels of the Republican party :
"He the President Is not a strong and
decided as we expected from the energy of
his character, or as the circumstances wouia
warrant in his treatment of reconstruction
He defers more to the opinion of Congress
than we supposed he would. His previous
eourse had led us to hope that he would in
ist upon as rapid a restoration of the po
litical relations of the South as might be
compatible with safety. The passage of the
Constitutional Amendment, which really
removes the whole ground of controversy,
we imagined, would be made his single con
dition, tine qua nnn, his test of loyalty, his
means or general conciliation auu settle
ment. But he abandons the entire matter to
Congress, xeith a simple history of what he had
. htmse'f done.
Good faith to the South, if not to the con
servative masses of the North, East and
West, require that the President should
make " the passage of the Constitutional
Amendment, which really removes the
whole ground of controversy," "his single
condition, fine qua non, bis test of loyalty,
his means of general conciliation and set'
tlement;" and it is cause for infinite regret
and disappointment that he did not do so
with unmistakable emphasis in bis mes
sage. If be abstained from emphasizing
such a purpose put of respect to Congress
as a co-ordinate branch of Government, and
hoping that that body would accept his ar
gument for their line of action and illus
trate a conciliatory feeling toward the
Southern people without his demanding of
them that they should do so, it may not
work to his disadvantage ; but if be shall
allow bis argument to be treated contempt
uously La Congress, and if he shall ratify
their repudiation of his implied pledges to
the Southern people that he would use the
Executive power of tbe Government to as
sure to them their right of Representation
in both branches of tbe National Legisla
ture, unenviably will be pass down through
history.
Thanksgiving in Columbus.
The churches of this city were generally
well attended on Thanksgiving l)ay; and
more than ordinary interest seemed to be
manifested in tbe devotional exercises of
the occasion. Business houses were closed ;
and our people found abundant cause for
Thanksgiving in the manifold blessings of
tbe year. With devout hearts, they could
offer up grateful thanks to the Almighty,
for staying the bloody and devastating civil
war which ravaged tbe land for four long
years, and for the return of peace; for the
escape from the calamities ot pestilence and
famine; and for the frultfulness of the sea
son. ' For years our blessings have nOt been
so signal and so worthy of especial remem
brance and pious " commemoration.
"Though, on looking back and around, we
behold much to deplore and to make us ap
prehensive" i yet, Columbus could say : "0
give thanks unto the Lord ; call upon His
name ; make known His deeds among the
people." . i. ... t ,
An Argument That Strikes the
Radicals Dumb.
[Special to the New York Daily News.]
Washihoton, Dec. 6-The leading Re
publicans here are getting somewhat
alarmed at the recent precipitate action of
the House in choking down Mr. Maynard
pfTennessee, a thoroughly loyal man and
a strong personal friend of the President.
It is understood that Mr. Johnson has de
clared that he will not confer the offices at
his disposal upon those who oppose his pol
icy of reconstruction, nor will he appoint
the friends of those opposing him in this
policy., , . - ' ...
r Tho Republican leaders are therefore
comforted with the loss ot all Executive
patronage, and it staggers them prodigiousr

hot some favors to ask. for his political
Irlends., Already many of the members be

The Treasury Report.
Of the report of the Secretary
Treasury we present a synopsis ot Its most
important statements of fact and of opinion,
Including the three topics of Currency,
Publio Debt, and Revenue, and pursuing
the order in which they are treated by Mr.
MtCulloch. - '
I. The Currency. -The. key to the policy
which the Secretary advocates 'mav be
found in the declaration of his belief that
the authority of Congress to make the ob
ligations of the Government a legal tender
resides outside of the Constitution, and that
the Inflation which has followed upon the
necessary exercise of tbstautborlty during
the war it prejudicial to both 'pubho And
private Interests. While, therefore, he does
not advocate the repeal of the legal tender
acts, nor believe It possible to reduce the
voldme Of the currency J violent -measures,
he is of opinion that those acts should
be regarded as only temporary, and that
the work ot retiring the notes which have
been Issued under them' BliouliT be "com
menced without delny and carefully and
SeraibUntly continued, until all are wltb
raWn". The rapidity ol.the 'process will
depend Mjon the ability to. dispose of se
curities."' The- speclflo measures -recommended
are as follows :. i: it
First. That Congress declare that the
compound interest notes shall cease to be a
legal tender from the day of their maturi
ty. These notes were intended to be a se
curity rather than a circulating medium,
and such a declaration by Congress would
be neither injurious to the publio nor an
act of bad faith to the holders.
Seemd. That the Secretary be authorized
in his discretion to sell bonds ot the United
States, bearing interest at a rate not ex
ceeding six per cent., and redeemable and
Payable at such periods as may be conduc
ive to the Interests of tbe Government, for
the purpose of retiring not only compound
interest notes but United States notes.
The amount which the Secretary esti
mates as necessary to be retired in order to
bring the currency within proper limits is
from one hundred to two hundred millions,
in addition to the comtmund notes, the
amount of which latter, Oct. 31, was $173,
0UH1, all due In 1807 and 1863. The total
paper circulation ot the United States at
that date was $704,218,033, to which should
be added $30,000,000, the estimated amount
of compound Interest notes actually in cir
culation. The total is likely to be still
further increased by the issue of notes to
tbe National Banks now daily going on, and
destined to continue till the limit ot $300,
000,000 authorized by law shall have been
reached, as it will be at no distant date. A
but $185,000, OOOof National Bank notesare
Included in the estimate of $734,218,038.20.
there remain $115,000,000 to be added, and
the aggregate amount of circulation will
then be $840.218.038 20. If the recom
mendations of the Secretary in regard to
contraction be fully carried out by retiring
$.200,000,000 of United States notes and the
$30.ou0.000 of compond iuterest notes ac
tuallv in circulation, there will still remain
a total circulation of $C19.218,038. 20, even
supposing that no extension ot the amount
of National Bank notes now authorized to
be issued be granted by Congress. It is,
perhaps, in view of these or similar cal
eolations that the Secretary adds to his
suggestions the remark that "neither the
amount of reduction nor the time that will
be reqiiired to bring up the currency to
the specie stanaara can now oe estimated
with any degree ot accuracy. r tfrst
thing to be done is to establish the policy of
contraction.
II. The Public Debt. The Secretary re
gards it as a public burden, tbe work of re
moving which should not be long postpon
ed. He sees no way of doing that except
by an Increase of the national income be
youd the national expenditures. The first
sten is to fund the obligations that are soon
to mature- The next, to provide for rais
ing revenues necessary to pay tne interest
on tbe debt, and a certain definite
amount annually for tbe reduction ot the
principal, on the 3 1st ot October, since
which time no material change has taken
place, the public debt amounted to $2,808,
540,437.55. Receipts lor the fiscal year end
i:igJune30, 1865. were $1,898,532,533.24, of
which $8tH,t33,4,JJ.17 were from loans ap
plicable to expenditures, and $0O.3tl.l'4l.
68 from loans applied to payment of public
debt, and f 309. 464.215.25 Irom internal rev
enue. Expenditures were $1,807,074,224.09.
of which the War Department is charged
with $1,031,323,360.79; redemption of debt
as above stated; interest on publio debt,
$77,307,712. Balance July 1.1865, $85809.
15. Total increase ot public debt during
the year, $941,902,537.04. -The
receipts for the quarter ending Sep
tember 30, 18C5, were $140,226.770 27; ex
penses, $373 068.254.93; leaving balance
October 1, $67,158,515.44. Estimated re

i The past due debt on the 31st of October,
beside the compound interest, tbe United
States and the fractional notes, amounted to
$1,373,920.09; debt due in 1865 and I860, to)
$187,549,646.40; debt due in 1867 and 1868, to
$848,323,591.80. Of the latter item, $830,1
000,000 consist of, 7 3-10 notes. As they
are convertible into bonds, only at the
pleasure or holders, (ne secretary desires
to be authorized to fund them, whenever it
can be advantageously done, la advance of
their maturity.- To meet deiiciency ror tne
present fiscal year he desires authority to
sell, ip i his discretion, bonds of a similak
character, toj reduce the temporary loan, to
pay maturing certincaies oi inaeoteupess,
and also to take up any portion of the debt
maturing prior to 1869 that can be advan
tageously -retired. -"It is not probable," re
marks tbe Secretary, "that it will be ad vis-;
able, even if Hcould be done without press
ing them upor the market,- to sell a much
larger amount of bonds within the present
or,the next fiscal year than will bencoes.
sary to meet any deficiency of the Treas
ury, to pay the past due and maturing ob
ligations of the Government, and a part of
the temporary loan, and to retire an amount
of the compound interest notes and United
Statss 'notes sufficient to bring hack the
business of the country to a healthier con
dition. ; But no nana can result from In
vesting the Secretary with authority to
dispose of bonds if the condition ,of the
oiprket will justify It, in order to anticipate
tlte payment of those obligations that must
soon be provided lor."
1 The total debt on the 1st of July, 1866, Is
estimated at $3,000,000,000. The Secretory
believes tbo whole amount may eventually
be funded at a rate of interest from 5 to bx
percenWand he suggests the application
of $200,000,000 per annum to thS payment
of principal and Interest together,by which
the whole would b extinguished id from
23 to 32)8" years. , r
' III. Internal Revenue: The Secretary re

awaits tibo report of tha special oommis

In. reference to the Southern States, tbe
L,wrriirff mwnmmends that the collection
qt taxes accruing before the establishment
therein of revenue offices be indefinitely
postponed ; that sales of property for direct
taxes be postponed till the States have an
opportunity of assuming those taxes, as tbo
loyal States did; and that all transaction
invalid for want ot stamps be legalized so
far as lies in the power of Congress.

Officer Huffman and the Burglars.
The bursters, of whom we gave some ac
count in our last paper, commenced their
operations on North High street, then went
to Long, and thence to Rich street, une
firing that occurred, on tho corner of High
and Gay streets, after the arrest of one of
their number (a boy), was between the two
other burglars on one side, and Officer
W. B. Huffman on the other. On the cor
ner four shots were fired at Huffman, three
of which made holes in his coat. Without
flin'chlnz. having two revolvers, be returned
their tire. They fled down Gay to Water
street, Huffman pursuing, and he and the
fuzitives alternately firing at each other.
He succeeded in pretty severely wounding
in the bio the rogue who was afterward
captured at the North Grave Yard. For
his coolness and intrepidity, Officer Huff
man deserves high praise.
A White Boy Stabbed by a Negro.
The Wheeling Register gives an account of
the stabbing, on Tuesday lust, of a white
boy named William Wilson, of that city, by
a negro named Charley Morris. The boy
was engaged washing himself at his home,
when the negro approached and struck him
a blow with a billy, knocking hifn down.
Wilson attempted to escape into the
house, but before he could do so, the ne
gro pulled a knife from his coat pocket,
with which he cut the boy, inflicting a
severe if not dangerous wound. The negro,
Morris, fled to Bridgeport, but was arrested,
brought back to Wheeling, and placed in
jail. This is the third time, the Register
says, this same blackguard has attempted
to cut and kill white persons. No cause is
assigned for this assault on young Wilson,
who is a quiet and peaceable boy.
