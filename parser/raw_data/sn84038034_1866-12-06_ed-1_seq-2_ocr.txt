Tbc most important portions or the "Pres
ident's message are before our readers, but
tbej will hardly rceopnize its miltl terms as
the utterances of the itumblc imlividnar
who, but a few weeks since was loastinjj
of his power to proclaim himself Dictator.
In his introductory remarks, which we
omit, he addresses the men whom he late
ly denounced as a laxly hanging on the
verge of the government and calling itself
Congress," as 'Fi-llow-titizens of the Sen
ate and House of Representatives," nor
does he have a word to say in reference to
Iii proposed Congress to le composed of
Copperhead ami rvbels U whom his mes
sage was to hav e leen sent. In the pres
ence of those who have the power and the
courage to imp aeli and depose him. Mr.
Johnson fails to repeat his St. Luw threat
to place a gnard at the door of Congress
and compel the admission of the Senators
and. Representatives from the reln-l States.
IS j marked a change in the ' demeanor of
the President toward the representatives of
the people cannot fail to attract general at
tention, and we trust it is n indication of
the return of calmer times, when in the dis
cussion of the really momentous questions
of the hour we shall hare less of the logic
of the bar-room and more of patriotic fer
vor and purpose.
Aside from this, the President seems to
have learned nothing since last he address
ed Congress upon the subject of reconstruc
tion. He still holds that his iocket gov
ernments, set up by himself in the seceded
States, without shadow of authority or law,
are States entitled to representation in the
national legislature. Although the people
have so declared, Mr. Johnson does not
think guarantees should be demanded of
rebels, but asks for them all the rights
which, he argues, they fought unsuccessful
ly for f. mr long, bloody years to dives
themselves of. His reasoning may be re
garded as satisfactory by thote who regard
the great struggle for national life and ex
istence as a mere trial of strength and skill
between rival sections, but the same strong
arms and earnest hearts who conquered
the rebellion have already pronounced
overwhelmingly against it.
Our foreign relations seem to be serious
ly com plicated. So interested luve the pub
lic have been in matter of domestic con
cern, that they given but Jittle attention to
our foreign policy. It has 1kti shrewdly
surmised that Mr. Johnson would welcome
a Avar with France or Great Rritain, hoping
that necessity would then compel the ac
cep?ance of his domestic policy. There is
need of great wi'sdom and tact jut now in
Congress in handling the delicate questions
growing out of the situation in Mexico and
our claims against Great IJritain, and it is

such a temper in their treatment that, while
avoiding war and its attendant horrors, the
integrity of our sister Republic shall be
hpeeuny eecurcu ami our national honor in
all respects vindicated.
Our finances arc in a condition of com.
ywrative security. The.recciptä of the gov
ernment are in excess of its expenditures,
and the national debt is being rapidly ex
tinguished. The country is prosperous,
yet much of our wealth is due to the char
acter of our currency. The Secretary ad
vocates preparations for a return to specie
payments. The reduction of taxation has
bad a salutary effect, and it Is expected of
Congress that it will still further decrease
the burdens new airily imposed upon the
business of the country. '
" Congrcs.
The first few days of the session will of
course be occupied by Congress in making
arrangements for work, and, therefore, we
Lave little to record of its doings. How
ever, on Monday a bill passed the Honse

dent to pardon rebels and restore confisca-

The Reported Invasion or
Mexico.
The report that Gen. Sedgwick, com
manding the sub-district of the Rio Grande,
Lad crossed over into Mexico with a brig
ade of Federal troops and occupied Mata
mqras, first telegraphed, we believe to the
New York World, and then to a Chicago
paper proves to have been purely can
ard. There is ground for congratulation
in this fact, for however decided may be
the sympathy of Americans generally with
the Liberal cause in Mexico, it must be
apparent that the occupation of Mexican
soil by United States troops cannot but
have the effect to render our relations with
the French Government extremely deli
cate- result sincerely to lc deplored
at ft time rrhen we are looking for the
teaceful solution of the whole question at
an early day by the voluntary withdrawal
of the French troops. The report is alleg
ed now to have originated from some dis
patches sent by Gen. Sheridan- to t Gen.
Heintzclman disapproving 'certain acts of
the commander of the Rio Grande.

Instead of being a candidate for State
Agent, as stated elsewhere in this paper,
we learn from the Indianapolis Journal that
Genera Milroy aspires to the Directorship

sition' We had feared that Milroy and
Gresham would be rival candidates for

Hogs. Pork packers' are laying back
and awaiting developments. At present
rates they refuse to Invest In hogs; and as
farmers are unwilling to" take the pricea
offered, prefering to hold on, it is unlikely
that much will be doa in the packing bu

killed so far have been done on commiss

killed at other houses on like conditions.
P RESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President sent his message to Con
gress.on Monday, the first day of tho ses
sion. Wc present the most important por
tions this week, but are compelled to defer
his summary of the reports of the Sec
retary of the Treasury, War, etc. After a
few - introductory remarks, the President
proceeds to discuss the quest ion of the
RESTOUATION OF TBK STATES.
In my message of the 4th of December,
1ST, Congress was informed of the meas
ures which had been instituted by the Ex
ecutive with a view to the gradual restora
tion cf the States in which the insurrection
occurred to their relations with the Gener
al Government. Provisional Governors
had Ix'en uppointed, Conventions called.
Governors elected, Legislatures assembled,
and Senatorsand Representatives chosen
to the Congress of the United States; courts
had lcen opened for the enforcement of
laws long in abeyance; .the blockade had
ljeen removed, custom houses re-established,
and the Internal Revenue laws put in
force in order that the people miuht con
tribute to the national income. Postal op
erations had lieen renewed, and eJorts were
beinjr made to res'cre them to their former
condition and ct'icioii?y. The States them
selves had been asked to take part in the
high function of amending the Constitution,
and of thus sanctioning the extinction of
slavery, a one of the legitimate results of
our internicinc struggle. 1 lavin? progress
ed thus far, the Executive Department
found that it had accompliscd nearly nil
that was within the scope of its constitu
tional authority. One thing, however, yet
remained to be done before the wc rk of
restoration could be completed, and that
was, the rdmission to Congress of loyal
Senn tors and Representatives from the
States whose rn'ople had rclcned against
the lawful authority of the General Gov
ernment. The question devolved on the
respective Houses, which, by the Constitu
tion, are made the judges of the elections,
rot urns and qualifications of their own
memliers, and its consideration at once en
gaged the attention of Congress. In the
meantime, the Executive Department no
other plan having been proposed by Con
cress continued in its efforts to "perfect ns
far as was practicable, the restoration of
the proper relations between the citizens of
the respective States, the States, and the
Federal Government, extending, from time
to time, as the public interests seemed to
require, the judicial, revenue and rostal sys
tems of the country. With the advice and
consent of the Senate, the necessary oflicers
were appointed and appropriations made
by contrress for the payment of their sala
ries. The proposition to amend the Fed
eral constitution so as to prevent the exist
ence of slavery within the United States, or
any place subject to their jurisdiction, was
ratified by the requisite numler of States,
and on the 1 Sth day of December, 1?;.., it
was officially declared to have become val
d as part of the Constitution of the United
States.
All of the Slates in which the iusurrec
tion had existed promptly .amended their
constitutions, so as to make them conform
to the great change thus effected in the or
ganic laws of the land; declared null rnd
void all ordinances and laws of .-ecession;
repudiated air pretended debts and obliga
tions created forthc revolutionary purin
es of Inurrectioq, and proceeded in -gixnl
faith to the enactment of measures for the
protection and amelioration of the condition
of the colored race. Congress, however,
yet hesitated to admit any of the States to
representation, and it was not until towards
the close of the eighth month of the sesion
that an exception was made in favor of Ten
nessee, by the admission of her Senators and
Representatives.
EXCLCSIOS OF LOT At, SOrTIIEKX SESATOI
ASP r.EPKEXTATlVES.
I deem it a subject of profound regret
that congress has thus far failed to admit
to scats loyal representatives from the oth
er States, whose inhabitants with those of
Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion.
Ten States more than -one-fourth of the
whole numlier remain without representa
tion. The seats of ."Omemtters in the House
of Representatives, and of 20 members in
the Senate, are yet vacant not by their
own consent, not bv the failure of election
but by the refusal of congress to accept
their credentials. Their admission, it is l
lieved, would have accomplished much to
ward the renewal and strengthening of our
relations as one people, and removed seri
ous cause foe discontent on the part of the
inhabitants of those. States. . .
It would have accorded with the great
principle enunciated in the -Declaration of
American Independence, that no people
ought to bear the burden of taxation, and
yet be denied the right of re present at "urn.
It would have been in .consonance with
Ihe express provisions of the constitution'
that each State shall have at least one repre
sentative, aad that no State without its con
sent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage
in the Senate. These provisions were in
tended to secure to every State, and to the
people of every State the right of represen
tation in each House of congress, and so
important was it deemed by the trainers of
the constitution that the equality of the
States in the Senate should be preserved,
that not even by an amendment to the con
stitution can any State, without its consent,
be denied a voice in that branch of the na
tional legislature.
INTEGRITY OF ALT. TnE STATES.
It is trie it has been assumed that the ex
istence of the States was terminated bv the
rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and that
the Insurrection having been suppressed
they were thence forward to be considered
merely as conquered territories. The leg
islative, executive and judicial departments
of the Government have, however, with
great distinctness and uniform consistency
refuseiTto mnction an assumpt ion so in
compatible with the nature of our republi
can system. Throughout the recent legis
lation of congress, the undeniaLlc fac t makes
itself apparent, that the ten political com
munities are nothing less than States of this
Union. At the very commencement of the
rebellion, each House declared with a una
nimity as remarkable as it was signttiCant,
that the war was not "waged on our part
in any spirit ofoppression, nor for any pur
pose of conquest or subjugation, nor pur
pose of overthrowing or interfering with
the rights or established institutions of those
States; but to defend and mainhun the su
premacy of the constitution and air laws
made in pursuance thereof; and to preserve
the Union with all the dignity, equality and
rights of the States unimpaired; and that ns
soon as these objects were accomplished,
the war ought to cease. . In some instan
ces. Senators were permitted ..to - continue
their legislative functions, while in other
instances, Representatives were elected and
admitted to seals after they had formally
declared their right to withdraw from the
Union' and were endeavoring to ' maintain
that right by force of arms.
All the States whose people were in in
surrection, as States were included in the
apportionment of the direct tax of -'O.tKtO.-O'io
annually laid upon the people of the
L nited Males ry tlc act approved "tu Au
ernst, 1 8 I. Congress, bv the act of March
4th, 18:?, and by the apportionment of rep
resentation thereunder, also recognized
their presence as States in the Union, and
thev have, for iudicial purposes been divi
ded into districts as States alone can be di
vided. The same recognition apiears in
the recent legislation iu reference to Ten
nessee, which evidently rests upon the fact
that the functions or the Slate were not de
"stroyed by the rebellion, but merely sus
pended, and that the principle is of course
applicable to those States which, like Ten
nessee, attempted to renounce their places
in the Union. The action of the Executive
Department of the Government upon this
. 1 1 A. .1 5
subject lias been equany uenniie r.nu uni
form, and the rmrpöse tf the war was iie
cificallv stated In the proclamation issued
by my predecessor on the 23d day of Sep
teml)cr, 18(12. It was then solemnly pro
claimed and declared that hereafter, as
heretofore, the war will be prosecuted foV
the oblect of prat ticallv restorlnar tia con
stitional relation between the United States
and each of the States and the feople there
of in which States that relation iscr may be
suspended or disturbed.' : J -" J
The recognition of the State; by the Ju
dielal Departmenfof the Government i has
also becnxlcat and conclusive in all pro
ceedings affectl"grhem as Stalcfcaha in
the supreme, c5rcun and district courts.
i t OtJALTSfcXTlcbaÖr MEMBEttäLt '
In the admission of Senators and Repre
sentatives from any and all the States there
can be no lust ground of apprehension that
persons who are disloyal will be clothed
with the powers of legislation; for this cod
not happen when the constitution and laws
are enforced by a vigilant and faithful con
gress. . Each house is made the judge of
the elections, rcturr j and qualifications of
its own members, and may, with the con
currence of two-thirds, expel a member.
When a Senator or Representative presents
his certificate of election, he mry at once
lc admitted or rejected; or, should there
be any question as to his eligibility, his
credentials may be referred to the appro
priate committee. If admitted to a scat, it
mu6t be, upon evidence as satisfactory to
the house of which he then becomes a mem
ber, that he possesses the requisite consti
tutional and legal qualifications. If refus
ed admission as a member for want of due
allegiance to the Government, and returned
to his constituents, they are admonished
that none but arsons loyal to the United
States will be allowed a voice in the "legis
lative councils of the nation, and the polit
ical powcr'nnd moral inlluence of congress
are thus effectively exerted in the interests
of loyalty to the Government and fidelit'
to the Ua'nn. Upon this question, so vital
ly affecting the restoration of the Union and
the permanency of our present form of gov
ernment, my convictions heretofore ex
pressed, have undergone no c hange; but on
the contrary, their correctness has been
confirmed by reflection and time. If the
admission of loyal members to their seats
in the respective houses of congress was
wise and expedient a year a;o, it is no less
wise and expedient now. if this anoma
lous condition is right now: if in the exact
position of these States at the present tii le
it is lawful to exclude them from represen
tation, I do not see that the question will
be changed by the influence of time. Ten
years hence, if these States remain as they
are, the right of representation will le no
stronger; the right of exclusion will be no
weaker.
ADVANTAGE OF AOMITTIXO LOY A I. SOCTIIEUN
MEMBERS.
" The Constitution of the United States
makes it the duty of the President to re
commend to the consideration of Congress
such measures as he shall judge necessary
or espedient. 1 know of no measure more
imperatively demanded by every considera
tion of national Interest, sound "policy and
equal justice, than the admission of the loy
al members from the now unrepresented
States. This would consummate the work
of restoration, and exert a most salutary in
fluence in the establishment of peace, har
mony and fraternal feeling. It ould tend
great Iv to renew the coufidence of the
American people in the vigor and btability
of their institutions. It would bind us more
closely together as a nation, and enable us
to show the world the inherent and recu
perative power of a government founded
upon the will ol the ieopIe. and establish
ed upon the principles of liberty, justice
and intelligence. Our increased strength
and enhanced prosperity would irrefrag.ihly
demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments
against free institutions, drawn from our
recent national disorders, by the enemies
of republican government. The admission
of loyal members from the States now ex
cluded from Congress, by allaying doubt
and apprehension, would turn capital now
awaiting an opportunity fr investment in
to the channels of trade and industry. It
would alleviate the present troubled condi
tion of those States, and by inducing Iimiii
grants, ai l in the settlement of fertile re
gions now uncultivated, audited to an in
creased pro 1'ietion of those staples which
have added so nmch to the wealth of the
nation, and the commerce of the world.
New fields of enterprise would Ik opened
to our progressive pecple. and soon the de
vastations of war would be rcjwired. und
all traces of our domestic ditliculties effaced
from the minds of our countrymen.
In our effirts to preserve "the ULity of
government which constitutes us one peo
ple, by restoring the Stutes to the condition
which they held prior to the rebellion, we
should lie cautious lest, having rescued our
nation from ci i!s of threatened disintegra
tion, we resort to consolidation, and in the
end absolute despotism, s a remedy fcrthe
recurrence of similar troubles.
The war having terminated, and with it
all occasion for the exercise of powers of
doubtful constitutionality, wc should has
ten to bring legislation within the bounda
ries prfscrilK'd by the Constitution, and to
return to the ancient landmarks established
by our fathers for the guidance of future
generations. The t onsiitution which at
any time exist.-, until changed by an explicit
and authentic act of the whole people, is
sacredly obligatory ujon all. If, in the
opinion of the people, the distribution or
modification of the constitutional powers
be in any particular wrong, let it Ik? correct
ed by an amendment, in the way in which
the Constitution designates: but let there Ik
no change bv usurpation, fur it is the cus
tomary weapon bv which free governments
are destroyed." Washington spoke these
words to his countrymen when, lolioweu
by their love and gratitude, he voluntarily
retired from the cares or public lite, "in
keep in all things within the pale of our
constitutional powers, and cherish the Fed
eral union as the only rock of safety," were
prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action
to endear to his countrymen the true prin
ciples of their Constitution and promote a
Lmon of sentime nt and action equally aus
picious to their happiness and safety. Jack
son said "that the action of the 'General
Government should always be strictly con
fined to the sphere of its appropriate du
ties," and justly and forcibly urged, 'that
our Government is not to be maintain ?d
nor our Union preserved by invasions of
the rights and powers of the several States.
In thus attempting to make our General
Government strong we make it weak. Its
true strength consists in leaving ieuividu-
als and States as much as possible lo the n-
selves. In making itselr felt, not in its
power, but in its leneficc nee; not in binding
the States more closely to the centre, but
leaving each to move unobstructed in its
proper constitutional orbit."
These are the teachings of men whose
deeds and services have made them illus
trious, and who, Jong since withdrawn from
the scenes of life, have left to their country
the rich legacy of their council, their wis
dom, and their patriotism. Drawing fresh
inspirations from their lessons, let us emu
late them in love of country and respect for
the Constitution and laws.
-
THE MEXtCAX. QfESTlOX.
- In the month of April last, as Congress is
aware, a friendly arrangement was made
between the Emperor of the French and the
President of the United States, for with
drawal from Mexico of the Frenc h expedi
tionary military forces. The withdrawal
was to be made in three detac hments, the
first of which it was understood would
leave Mexico in "November now past; the
second in March next, and the third and
last in November, 18ß7. Immediately up
on the completion of the evacuation, the
French Government wai to assume the
same attitude of non-intervention in regard
to Mexico as Is held bv the Government of
the United States. Repeated assurances
have been given by the Emperor since that
agreement that be would complete the
promised evacuation within the period
mentioned or sooner. It was reasonably
expected that the prcccedings thus con
templated would produce a crisis of great
political interest In the Republic of Mexico.
The newly appointed Minister of the Uni
ted States, Mr. Ccmplcll, was, therefore,
sent forward on the ninth day of Novcm
tcr last to assume his proicr functions as
Minister Plenipotentiary of the United
States to that Republic. It was also
thought expedient that he should be attend
ed in the vic inity ot Mexico by the Lieu
tenant General of the army of the United
States, with a view of obtaining such in
formation as might .be important to det er
mine the course to be pursued by tho Uni
ted States in re-establishing and maintain
ing necessary .and, proper intercourse, with
the Republic- of Mexico-. 'Deeply 'inter
ested in the cause of liberty and humanity,
'it seemed n obvious duty on our part to
'eiereise whatever inlluence we possessed
for the restoration v and permuient estab
lishment in that country of a domestic and
republican form of Government.
'' Such was the condition of affdrs in re?
gard to Mexhoo, when, pn the . 23d or No
vember last.1 DlBcial information 'was-re
ceived from Paris that the Emperor of
France had, some time before, decided not
to withdraw a detachment ot ntaiorcei in
the jnontli of November past, according to
engagement," but that thte decisioa was
made w ith the purpose of withdrawing the
whole of those forces in the ensuing spring.
Of this determination, however, the United
States had not received any notice or inti
mation, and as soon as the Information was
received by the Government, care was taken
to make known its dissent to the course of
the Emperor of France. I cannot forego the
hope that France will reconsider the sub
ject, and adopt some resolution in regard
to the cvnf uution of Mexico, which will
conform as nearly as practicable with the
existing engagement, and thus meet the
just expectations of the United States.
The papers relating to the subject will be
laid before you. it is believed that with
the evacuation of Mexico by the expedi
tionary forces, no subject for serious differ
ences between France and the United States
would remain. The expressions of the
Emperor and people of France warrant a
hope that the traditionary friendship be
tween" the two countries might, in that
case, be renewed and peraiantlv restored.
A claim of a citizen of the United States
for indemnity for spoliations committed on
tiie high seas by the French "authorities, in
the exercise of a belligerent power against
Mexico, has been met by the Government
of France with a proposition to defer set
tlement until a mutual convention for the
adjustment of all cbiims of citizens and
subjects of loth countries, arising out of
the recent wars on this Continent, shall le
agreed upon by the two countries. The
suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but
it belongs to Congress to direct the manner
in which claims for indemnity by foreign
ers, as well as citizens of the United States,
arising out of the late civil.war, shall be ad
judicated and determined. Ihavc no doubt
that the subject of all such claims will en
gage your attention at a convenient at.d
proper time.
oi:k t nniTATX?
It is a matter of great regret that no con
siderable advance has been, made towards
an adjustment of the difterences between
the United" States and Great Britain, ari
sing out of the depredations on our nation
al commerce, ana other trespasses, com
mitted during our civil war, by llritish
subjects, in violation of international law
ami treaty obligations. The delay, how
ever, may be believed to have resulted, in
no small degree, fr m the domestic situa
tion of (Jreut Hiitian. An. entire change
of ministry occurred In that country during
the last session of Parliament. The atten
tion of the new ministry vis called to the
subject at an early day, and there is some
reason to expect that it will now be consid
ered in a bec oming and friendly spirit.
The importance of an early disposition of
the question cannot be exaggerated.
Whatever might 1 the wishes of the two
Governments'" it is manifest that good will
and friendship between the two countries
cannot le established until a reciprocity in
the practice of gwxl faith and neutrality
shall be restored between the respective na
tions. THE FEXIAX IXVAS10X OF CAXADA.
On the ( of June last, in violation of
our neutrality laws, a military enterprise
against the liritish North American Colon
ies was projected and attempted to be car
ried on within the territory and jurisdic
tion of the United States. In obedience to
the obligation imjiosed upon the Execu
tive by the Constitution, to see that the
laws are faithfully executed, all citizens
were warned, by proc lamation against ta
king part in or aiding such unlawful pro
ceedings, and the proper civil; military und
naval oilier r were, directed to take ail ne-
cessary measures fcr theenforccment of the
laws. The expedition failed, but it has
not been without its painful consequences.
Some of our c itizens, who. it was alleged,
were engaged in the expedition, were cap
tured, and have been brought to trial, as
for a capital offence, in the Province of
Camdi. Judgment and sentence of death
Iir.ve been pronounced against some, while
others have been acquitted. Fully IkTicv
ing in the maxim of government that
severity of civil punishment for mis
guided persons who have engaged in revo
lutionary attempts, which have disastrous
ly failed, is unsound and unwise, such rep
resentations have Ix'en made to the liritish
Government in behalf of tho convicted per
sons as Ifing sustained by an enlightened
anil humane judgment, w ill it is hoped, in
duce in tl'.eir casc an exercise of clemency
and a judicious nmnctj' to all who were
engaged in the movement. Counsel has
been employed by the Government to de
fend citizens of the United States on trial
foreripitsl offences, in Canada, and a dis
continuance of the prosecutions, which were
instituted in the courts of the United States,
against those who took part in the expedi
tion, has been directed.
I have regarded the expedition as not
only political in Its nature, but as also, in a
great measure, foreign from tho United
States, in causes, character and objects.
The attempt was understood to be made in
symp ithy with an insurgent rrnrtj' In Ireland,
and by striking a British province, on this
continent, was designed to aid in obtaining
redress fur political grievances, which, it
was assumed the iveople of Ireland had
suffered nt the hands of the liritish Govern
ment during a eriod of several centuries.
The persons engaged in it were chiefly na
tives of tint country, some of whom had
not become citizens of the United States
under our general laws of naturalization.
Complaints of misgovernmenl in Ireland
eontir.uu'ly engage the attention of the
British nation, and so great an aerilaiion is
now prevailing in Irelind that the Rritish
Government have deemed it necessary to
suspend the writ othahea$ ewrput in that
country.
These circumstances must necessarily
modify the opinion which wc might other
wise have entertained in regard to an ex
pedition expresly prohibited by ourncutral-
ity laws. So long as these icmain upon
ur statute book ihey should be faithfully
exec uted, and if they operate harshly, un-
justlv or oppressively Congress alone can
apply the remedy by their mouiccation or
repeal.
coxcLfstox:
In the performance of a duty imposed
ujion tue by the Constitution, I "have thus
submitted to tLc representatives of the
States and of the people such information
of our domestic and foreign affairs as the
public interests seem to . require. Our
Government is now undergoing its most
trying r.deal, and my earnest rVaycr Is that
the peril may be successfully and finally
passed without impairing its original
streiigth and symmetry. The Interests of
the. nation arc best- promoted by the revi
val of fraternal relations, the complete oblit
eration of oür past differences! and tho re
inauguration of all the pursuits of ic.ice.
Directing our efforts to the early accom
plishment of . these great ends, let us en
deavor to preserve harmony between the
cordinnate departments of the Govern
ment, that each in its proper sphere may
cordially co-operate with the other in
securing the niaintainance of " the Consti

Rv the Cvntx. The Rritish officials
throughout Ireland continue to make arrests
of persons' supposed to Ikj interested in the
Fenian movement The Austrian Cham-
lcrs have approved the terms of the recent
treaty of peaces... ..It is stated in official
quarters that an early peace will be satis
factorily arranged between the Spanish
Government and the allied Government of
Chili and Peru Tho American resi
dents in London gave a banquet as an ob
servance of their" national thanksgiving at
which there was a-1ane attendance It ia
announced that the illness of the Empress
Cflriotta lias assumed n more serious aspect,
and fears are entertained ' that it will soon
provp fatal... ...It is now nnncmnced that
the hmpror Maxraman is' expected to ar
rive in Paris early in December. '
In the city of Dublin there arc station
ed at ' p 'Cscnt eighteen thousand regular
troops, boused in the various strong bar
racks and fortifications of the city. : To
drive these ont it will be necessary to have
organized, tlurty-fivo. thousand Fenians,
who lyust be thbroughjy arm ml and organ
ized. It is more than possible, however,
that within .tp ri days an Insurrccticm will
break, out, iu Ireland, and as a consequence
much blood will be shed, with, however,
but one pnssiVh; result the defeat of tho

Dourbon Correspondence.
Bocebox, Dec. Sch
Eds. Rep. We are occasionaly amtiaed
at the position taken by some of our prom
inent Copperheads in their efforts to ouj
radical the Radicals on the suffrage ques
tion. When the famous universal suffrage
article appeared in the columns of the
Chicago Time$ the Bourbon Democracy
were sorely vexed and many and bitter
were the anathemas heaped upon the Edi
tors of that sheet; but they, are now re
versing their judgment and Radicalism is
nowhere. When they become steadfast
in their ft. ith and are fully committed to
the new doctrine we will give them the
benefit of a more extended notice.
As we are destitute of news items, and
as dialogues are the cream of some pop-ul&r
journals, we will report one supposed to
have occurred at or near a neighboring
village between a couple of young gents.
"How arc yon Jake? Where have you
been?"
u Well, Bill, just set down here and I'll
tell you the whole Story. There is a poor,
silly fellow Staying in Bourbon who has
been saying a great deal alxmt cheap goods,
&c. I was determined to hear it from his
own lips so I went up and he told me the
following. "
Well, go on Jake."
"Well, he told me the Tailors, Merchants
and Druggists wcre.vcry anxious to get rid
of their goods; that he had got a fine suit
of clothes and some Dry .Goods very cheap,
and ou time too, and that I might do the
same, and after I got the goods I could do
just as I pleased about ever paying for
them. For his part he never intended pay
ing for his. You sec.
"Sec what? go on."
"You sec, as the fellow tries to I some
body and hold his head up, I was tempted
to go and do likew isc and--
"What: act dis
"Hold on and I II tell you all about it.
I thought I had as much brains as he (and
that isn't saying much is it?) and as I
thought I'd try it too.
"Well, what came of it?"
'The first place I went was Mr. Scar's
Clothing Store, and, after selecting a fin';
suit, 1 asked for credit."
"What did Mr. Scar say?"
He said "Money mad'. the marc go! and,
having some experience in the credit bus
iness, he couldn't sec it. I felt a little
angry and told him he had trust el another
man (naming him) and I was just as good
as he was."
"What did he say, then?"
"lie said he guessed I couldn't be any
worse for that fellow got a nice suit to help
him on in "ekrating" himse lf in society and
promised to pay in a few days, but he had
worn out a good pair of boots running
after his money and bad given it up as a
bad job, consequently had quit the credit
business. "
"Well, go on."
"I visited several Dry Goods houses and
one Drug establishment and met with the
same success. Don't von think that fellow
was indebted at every store I went to and
each proprietor had the very same story to
tell."
"Then you didn't get any thing?"
"'fes, but not on credit, fort hat abonm
niabic fellow has entirely ruined the credit
business in Bourbon. But the goods were
so cheap that I borrowed some money of
a friend and bought me a fine suit of
clothes at Sear's and a dress for my wife
at Cless and a pair of boots at 1 lagans' but
I'm in a hurry and cant tell all now."
"But stop, did you borrow the money of
that credit ruiner?"
"Not any, he hadn't a red, and people
there ay he never has that article."
"Do you intend to refund the lorrowed
money?"
"Indeed I do. I have learned that
"honesty is the best policy" and I shall
endeavor to profit by the lesson tx. An
honest man can get along any where but
confidence games soon play out. Youll
never catch me at any thing dishonest
hereafter.
"GotxU I am glad to hear you acted the
man."
" rtcll, I must go. But IU tell you those
business men up at Boutbon arc gentle
men and I want you to go up there the
next time you want any thing. "Good
by."
"Alt right, good by, Jake; but hold on,
do you take a paper?" "Yes, I subscribed
for the Marshall County Republican to
day." -All right.
Xowgo home."
Although no oflicial communication has
Ix-cn mach; to this Government, there is no
loul)t that information has been verbally
furnished of Napoleon's intention to re
move the French troops from Mexico at
the earliest practical time. The arrange
ments for this purpose arc now progressing.
The reason why the first detachment, or
one-third of the troops, was not embarked
in November, according to the Emperor's
own programme, is that the other two
thirdi might have been seriously damaged
by the Liberals.
It is believed in Montreal that the Brit
ish Government has refused to pay the Al
abama c laims, and that Canada would have
to look out for trouble with the United
States. It is further believed that France
has cje pressed her willingness to assist in
the defense of the Canadian provinces,
provided that the British navy would op
crate w ith her in the Gulf of ilexieo.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE.
Daily, Tri-Weekly ao.il Ycekly Edition?.
DEVOTED TO
News, Commerce, Politics, Agricul
ture, Manufactures, Literature
and Science.
The best Newspaper, the best Political
Paper, the lx-st Commercial Paper,
the most Valuable Family Paper,
tbc Largest Paper in the
Northwest.
It publishcH more Telegraphic News, Bet
ter Market Reports, "more Interesting
News, and a Greater Variety of Unlia
ble and Useful Information than any
other Paper in America.
The Chicago Twnrxs, now apnr.jr.c'iiüg
its twenty-first year, is recnirni.ed n the
leading organ and exponent of the grenl.
patriotic, dominant Republican p:iriy f
the Northwest. The Timim-xe is no
ephemeral concern of do ibtful duration
but a permanently established institution,
known and respected throughout tin:
United States. Itscircul.ttion exceeds the
combined issues of the other Chicniro
dailies. Its pa.t record und career mav be j
pointed to with pi i b- it m l pleasure by its
conductors. Since the: K 'publican p;irty
was organized, the (,'hlr :i"o TiMisfXK has
stood by it, tlirou :!i evil ns well is good j
report; never in the nvir. but i.hv.-us in the
front beckoning it onwar.l nd upward;
never faltering or weary, but always Iiojk'
ful. earned, fearless. Its blows Iiave fallen
incessantly on slavery oligarchy and trea
son. During the entire period of the re
bellion it blew no uncertain b!?-ts, but
sounded the charge und cheered on the
defenders of freedom to renewed efforts,
assuring litem of a glorious triumph forthc
right as the reward of preserve ranee and
sacrifice.
And now when the wicked rcltcllion is
crushed, the oligarchy conquered, and sla-
very abolished, the Chicago Tiuki xe insist
that the legitimate fruits of our victory
shall not K yielded luck to vanquished
rebels by nn ajostate Executive, who has
basely and wickedly b-t rived the loyal
people who intrusted hitn with Prcsidcniial
powers. The TuiarxE opens a new
campaign to secure to the. Union anendnr
ingje:tce, and a reconstruction based on
the principles of
Equal Rights and Exact Jastlcs
to All Hen!-
It t iicrcfore advocates Impartial Suffrage,
irrespective of color or birthplace. Right
wrongs no man, and no nun's rights are
abridged or endangered by giving to every
law-abiding citizen all Iiis rights. And no
scheme of recoii'tnictio:i will prove satis
factory or enduring that denies equal civil
and political rights and privileges to any
class of loyal citizens. No Dmiorrat can
oppose impartial suffrage and equal rights
without shameful inconsistency and stultifi
cation. And th" S mt!i can never be tru'j
free, proqifTKis or happy until all its
citizens are recognized as equal before the
law, and equal in making the laws, which
they nm-a obey, regardless of color or p i
tion. The Chicago TiunrxE sincerely believes
in the Declaration of lndcK.'ndcnrv. and i
therefore i:a:i:t.i. in its ai:m. imn ilses and
endeavors, mid is confident of witnessing
at an early day, the acceptance and
adoption of the lienelieient doctrines of
Kcpubiiru'.iis'n in every section nnd sub
division of our common country.
The readers of tho Tkihuxk will lear
testimony tint the policies it Ins opposed
have generally been discarded: the meas
ures it has supported have nearly all tn-en
adopted, and that its predictions have Wvw
singularly verified. T!t" secret of its in
fluence on p lb'ie. atfuis i-, that it espouses
what is i:ii.i;t, (arnesllv. and combats
what is vs:oX( boldly; an 1 t'.ir glass wifi
which it sees into ihe fature is implicit
faith iu th : power of Truth and tiu- ulti
mate triumph of the Riht.
1 First-CIas? rVciyspaiirr.
The Chicago TiunrxE. wiiile fearless in
the expression of its opinions, and pal rot ic
in its endeavors, aims at bein a FIRST

news to tli. people oft he Northwest several
days so )!i.-r than th ; "pipers of the sea
board, and surpasses -11 its eontcinporarie
in the Northwest ia every department o.
news enterprise.
