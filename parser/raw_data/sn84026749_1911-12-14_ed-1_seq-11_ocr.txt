Skyscrapers Win
Words of Praise
From Ambassador
Architects who feel responsibility for
having erected skyscrapers, have a
kindly feeling1' today for Ambassador
Jusserand, who, last evening, said a
good word for the tall office buildings,
generally abused. M. Jusserand spoke
at the medal presentation to George B.
Poet at tho exercises of the American
institute of Architecture at the National
luseum. '
The affalrwaVa brilliant one. Before
the exerclseB, at which President Taft
and Charles D. Walcott, secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution spoke, a re
ception, was held, attended by 600 men
and women, who included visiting archi
tects and their wives, and other persons
prominent in Washington's official, sci
entific, or social life.
President Taft spoke briefly, asserting
that architecture is unique among the
rcfasHlons in the way In which its
adlng exponents are definitely and con
'cretely honored, and distinguished from
their fellows of baser metals.
"I am glad to lend the weight of the
office which I am temporarily occupy
ing," .said the President with a smile,
"to this occasion, and, personally and
officially, to give such sanction as I
can to tho honoring of Mr. Post."
President Taft at the beginning of his
address 'leaned forward, resting both
arms on a collapsible desk sitting on the
table in the center of the platform. The
desk abruptly descended about a foot.
The audience smiled, and President Taft
looked unhappy. But a few minutes
later he roared with laughter, , and so
did the audience when Ambassador
Jusserand followed suit In the accident.
M. Jusserand expressed the conviction
that the skyscraper will yet become a
thing of beauty individually, "as it now
Is when a number are considered in en
emUe." The ambassador spoko In this
connection of vho wonderful sky line of
Now -York city, as viewed from Brook
lyn Bildge or a Jersey city ferryboat.
President Pond began the exercises by
reading a brief sketch of Mr. Post's
career. When the speeches had con-
