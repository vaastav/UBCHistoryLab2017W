AboT all, do not forget your over

flshball trust Is suspected.
In some respects this has already
been an old-fashioned winter.
And so far no one has invented
oft spot for aviators to fall on.
The English courts have small use
for hypothetical questions or brain
storms. One thing is certain, there Is plenty
of room for aviators to make high-flying
records In.
The Ideas of the weather clerk are

The nervous wrecks In Newport are
the grocers who cannot collect bills

In football, as in politics you cannot
always tell. The same is true of
love and the stock markets, how

Dirigible balloons are dirigible,
only when they move with the wind.
They cannot buck the wind as a real
man-bird does.
The statement is made by a Swiss
doctor that drunkards live longer than
total abstainers. But even if they do,
what's the use?
The population of the Philippines
has decreased 25 per cent since we
took them over. Does race suicide
also follow the flag?
That fringe of puppy dogs at a New
York wedding has become almost as
famous as the monkeys that dine with
"the 400" at Newport.
Canada levied no duty on the bal
loons that started from St. Louis and
went northward across the border.
It did not know how to do it.
A New York judge has decided that
Nevada divorces are no good. Just
like a New Yorker- discarding
things because they're inexpensive!
Aeroplaning to Europe is the latest
upon the aviator's schedule. It would
be well to put off the attempt - till
after winter say about flytime.
Every little while somebody wins
the world's championship at typewrit

typewriters never get splendid offers
to go on the stage.
The man who never sees a $100 bill
has no reason to worry because of
that very dangerous counterfeit which
the Washington authorities say is in
circulation.
According to statistics there are
10,000,000 telephone stations in the

when you want it.
Thirty-four aviators have met with
fatal accidents during the past year.
Still, some of them might have

Somebody says that the way to

Another aviator has broken the

happens even more frequently than
the launching of the largest ship or

Horace Fletcher says that If one is

Somehow, we find it almost impossi

he did go into it with his eyes open.
A Harvard professor declares that
the late and loveless marriages are re

Yankee blood. Most persons have
thought this was due to the wholesale

A Los Angeles woman used a stick
of dynamite on her washboard, sup
posing it to be soap. The fact that
there was no explosion indicates that
the wretched makers of dynamite are

A Chicago professor has discovered
''that women gossip because gossiping

much, it ought to be possible to dis

With 3,000 inventors at work per

PRESIDENT FOINTS OUT NECES
SITY OF CURTAILING EXPEN
SES TO LAWMAKERS.
ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ
Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For
tification of Panama Canal Lead
ing Topics Discussed Has
Little to Say About Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 6. Economy In
government affairs is the keynote of
President Taft's annual message read
before both houses of congress today.
The message approximates 40,000
words and is one of the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
ship subsidy, fortification of the Pana
ma canal and the continuation of the
pre&ent tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re
views the work of the various gov
ernment departments and concurs in
recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the service, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet.
Economy Is Urged.
In dwelling on the urgent need for
economy In government expenditures, the
president says: "Every effort has keen
made by each department chief to reduce
the estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June 80.
1912. I say this in order that congress
may understand that these estimates thus
made present the smallest sum which will
maintain the departments, bureaus and
offices of the government and meet its
other obligations under existing law. and
that a cut of these estimates would re
sult in embarrassing the executive branch
lti'
of the government in the performance of
This remark does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates, except
to those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does it apply to the
public building bill nor to the navy build
ing program. Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all Of
the estimates for them without interfer
ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob
ligations of these functions of its depart
ments, bureaus and offices.
"Against the estimates of expenditures
140.4:M. 013.12. we have estimated receipts
for next year JOSO.O'O.OOO, making a proba
ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or
dinary expenditures of about $50,000,000. or
tnking into account the estimates for tho
Panama canal, which are $56.920.S47.69, and
whi'h will ultimately be paid in bonds.
; It will leave a deficit for the next year of
I about $7,000,000, if congress shall conclude
to fortify the canal."
Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation he de
votes considerable space to forest, coal.
Oil and gas. phosphate lands and water
power sites. As to the reservation of
forest lands he says: "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any more forest
hinds In Oregon. Washington. Idaho.
Montana. Colorado and Wyoming, except
by act of coneress. I am informed by the
department of agriculture that the gov
ernment owns other tracts f)f timber Innd
In these states which should be included
In the forest reserves. T recommend t
congress that the limitation herein Im
posed be repealed.
"Congress ought to trust the executive
to use the power of reservation only with
resprct to-land most valuable for forest
purposes. Purine the present administra
tion. 02. "."O.ono acres of Innd largely non
timbered have been excluded from forest
reserves, and S.TiOOOOO acres of land prin-
l rijially valuable for forest purposes have
been included In forest reserves, making I
a reduction In
timbered land
fi'rest reserves
amounting to
(if non
2.7."0.oro acres."
Wants Canal Fortified.
Regarding the Panama canal, the presi
dent asserts that unless unexpected ob
stacles arise the waterwav will be com
pleted well within time limit of .Tanu-
I prv 1. 1m,", and within estimate of cost,
j fSTTi.nnn.ooo. Suggestions for levying of
' tolls and management are made, and re
i gar llng fortification of the canal, he
lays:
I "Among questions arisincr for present
solution Is the decision whether IT.e canal
shall be fortified. I have alreadv stated
to the congress that I strongly favor for
tification and I now reiterate this opin
ion and ask your consideration of the
subject In the light of the report already
before you made hy a competent board.
"Failure to fortify the ,-anal would
leave the attainment of both these aims
In the position of rights and obligations
Which we should be powerless to enforce
and which could never in any way be ab
solutely safeguarded neainst a desperate
and Irresponsible enemy."
Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such action as he
belifves will Increase American trade
abroad, and says:: '
"Another instrumentality indispensable
to the unhampered and natural develop
ment of American commerce Is merchant
! marine.
All maritime and commercial na
tions recognize the importance of this
factor. The greatest commercial nations.
j our competitors, jealously foster their
I merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere is
; the need for rapid and direct mail, pas
I senger and freight communication quite
j so urgent as between the United States
j and I,atln America. We can secure In no
j other quarter of the world such lmme-
dlate benefits in friendship and com
merce as would flow from the establish
ment of direct lines of communication
with the countries of T,atfn America ade
quate to meet the requirements of a rap
Idly increasing appreciation of the reci
procal dependence of the countries of the
western hemisphere upon each other's
products, sympathies and assistance.
I alluded to this most Important sub-

t often been before you and I
need not re
capitulate the reasons for its recommen
dation. Unless prompt action be taken
the completion of the Panama canal will

A Quick Recovery.
"It seems that prizefighters never
'come back."
"Maybe not, but 'blind tigers' do.
One resumed business the other day
in 15 piinutes after it had been
raided."
Depending on Chance.
"I wonder why there are so many
failures in the world."
"Probably because so many people
go through life hoping to win some
day on a 100-to-l shot."
His Selection.
"I am afraid to go near Sharp's
bouse or to meet him; he has such a
vicious dog for a pet."
"But you must remember that
Sharp considers himself such a cynic
he wouldn't keep any other dog than
a biting kind."
Department of the Interior.
Seymour Did you visit the depart
ment of the interior while you were
In Washington?
Ashley I guess so; I was in the
cafe where the congressmen eat
tlon unable to avail In international mari
time business of this great contribution to
the means of the world's commercial In
tercourse." Criticism of the Tariff.
In the space devoted to the tariff the
president says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty in
the Payne tariff act have been aubjected
to a great deal of criticism, some of it
Just, more of it unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The act was adopted
in pursuance of a declaration bjr the par
ty which is responsible for it that cus
toms bill should be a tariff for the pro.
taction of home industries, the measure
of the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of producing the imported
article abroad and the cost of producing
It at home, together with such addition to
that difference as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff is that in
respect to a number of the schedules the
declared measure was not followed, but a
higher difference retained or Inserted by
way of undue discrimination In favor of
certain industries and manufactures. Lit
tle, If any. of the criticism of the tariff
has been directed against the protective
principle above stated: but the main body
of the criticism has been based on the at
tempt to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to investigate
the cost of production of various articles
included in the schedules of the tariff,
and concludes:
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued, and the degree of protec
tion to be accorded to our home indus
tries, are questions which the people must
decide through their chosen representa
tives. But whatever policy is adopted. It
Is clear that the necessary legislation
should be based on an Impartial, thor
ough and continuous study of the facts."
Recommends Parcels Post.
The adoption of the parcels post Is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft says: "With respect to the parcels
post, I respectfully recommend its adop
tion on all rural delivery routes, and that
11 pounds the international limit be
made the limit of carriage in such post.
The same argument is made against tho
parcels post that was made against the
postal savings bank that it Is Introduc
ing the government into a business which
should be conducted by private persona
and is paternalism. The postoffiee depart
ment has a great plant and a great or
ganization, reaching Into the most remotw
hamlet of the United States, and with
this machinery It is able to d a great
many things economically that If a new
organization were necessary It would be
Impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditures." Department of Justice.
Discussing the affairs of the department
of justice, the president says:
"I invite especial attention to the prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
called 'bucket shops.' and of those
schemes to defraud in which the use of
the mall is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which
have saved ignorant and weak members
of the public and are saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars. The viola
tions of the anti-trust law present per
haps the most important litigation before
the department, and the number of cases
filed shows the activity of the govern
ment in enforcing that statute.
"Tn a special message last year I
brought to the attention of congress the
propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen
eral law providing for the incorporation
of industrial and other companies engaged
in interstate commerce, and T renew my
recommendation in that bPhnlf ."
The crying need in the I'nited States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying judicial procedure and ex
pediting final Judgment is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
Is urged.
The president recommends an Increase
In the salaries of f---d.-r:'i judges.
Postal Affairs.
In regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pride to its present effi
cient management and the recent reduc
tion in the defMt. The present unre
stricted franking privilege comes in for
comment with a suggestion for the adop
tion of better methods for its regulation.
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged hy the set rotary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption.
and continues:
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard,
and has studied the uses of the navy
yards with reference t- the necessities
of our fleet. With a fleet considerably
less than half the size of that of the
British navy, we have shipyards more
than double the- number, and there are
several of those shipyards expensively
equipped with modem mchinery, which,
after investigation the secretary of the
navy believes to be entirely useless for
naval purposes. TTe arks authority to
abandon certain o; them and to move
their machinery to . 'her places, where It
can be made of use "
Speaking of our f' reign relations the
president says: "T -ing the past year
the foreign relations f the United States
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
"The year has been notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement of two impor
tant international controversies before the
permanent court of The Hague.
"The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence since the fisheries convention of 1S18,
has given an award which is satisfactory
to both parties. This arbitration is par
ticularly noteworthy not only because cf
the eminently just results secured, hut
also because it is the first arbitration held
under the general arbitration trcatv of
j April 4. 130S. between the United States
j and Great Britain, and disposes of a con
; troversy the settlement of which has r-
sisted every other resource of diplomacy
- and which for nearly ninety years has
. been the cause of friction between two
; countries whose common interest lies in
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
. relations with each other.
; President Taft makes a few recommen
dations for changes in the interstate com
! meree law and says:
j "Except as above, I do not recommend
! any amendment to the interstate com
! merce law as It stands. I do not now
recommend any amendment to the anti
: trust law. In other words, it seems to
j me that the existing legislation with
i refprenr? to the rcsnilatlnn of cornora-
i tlons and the restrnint of their business
has reached a point whre we can stop
for a while and witness the effect of the
vigorous execution of the laws of (he
statute books In restraining the abuses
which certainly did exist and whiah
roused the public to demand reform."

Willis So the play will appeal to

A Contrary Way.
"An acrobat goes against ail
re-
ceived ideas of making a living."
"Why?"
"Because ha supports his family b
the reverses in his business."
It Was Not Fair.
A fight in a restaurant was caused
by the customer offering to pay for
two fried eggs he had ordered if the
proprietor would eat them. That was
an unfair proposition. A man may
keep a restaurant, but he isn't com
pelled to eat there.
Its Nature.
"I wonder why a wheel is counted
among the sources of energetic pow
er?" "Why shouldn't It be?"
"Why, isn't it always tired?"
PESSIMIST RAISES A WAIL
Incidentally Gives a Hard Jolt to
Time-Honored Conception of New
England Thanksgiving.
"Oh, yes; the New Englanders make
a great time of Thanksgiving," said
the insurance man as the subject was
under discussion. "Yes, they are great
on Thanksgiving."
"All the relatives gather for a big
dinner, don't they?" was asked.
"Yes. My Uncle Ben, up in Ver
mont, gathered thirty of s at his
house last Thanksgiving."
"What a visit you must have had!"
"Oh, yes."
"And the banquet. I can picture if
"Can you?"
"There was turkey, goose, duck,
chicken, roast pig and sparerib.
There was mince pie, pumpkin pie
and cider. There was a big cottage
pudding and cranberry sauce. Ah, it
must have been a royal feast."
"Yes, it was," dryly replied the in
surance man. "My Uncle Ben killed
off four old roosters, his wife made
four or five apple pies, and stewed
up a peck of prunes, and we sat
down to the feast."
"But but It was Thanksgiving."
"Sure, Mike. If it hadn't been we
wouldn't have got the prunes."
"And and that was all?"
"All except that after dinner my
Uncle Ben took up a collection for
the heathen, and we chipped In BO
cents apiece. My Uncle Ben was the
heathen, you know. Oh, yes New
England Thanksgiving. I've been

16 YEARS OF SKIN DISEASE
"For sixteen long years I have been
suffering wkh a bad case of skin dis
ease. While a child there broke out a
red sore on the legs Just in back of
my knees. It waxed from bad to worse,
and at last I saw I had a bad skin
disease. I tried many widely known
doctors in different cities but to nc
satisfactory result. The plague both

In winter and being on my leg joints
it made it impossible for me to walk,
and I was forced to stay indoors in the
warmest weather. My hopes of recov
ery were by this time spent. Sleepless
nights and restless days made life an
unbearable burden. At last I was
advised to try the Cuticura remedies
Cuticura Soap, Ointment and Pills
and I did not need more than a trial
to convince me that I was on the road
of success this time. I bought two
sets of the Cuticura Remedies and
after these were gone I was a differ

Benny on Benevolence.
Benevolence is a great thing. When
you have benevolence youcannot rest
until you do something to make other
people feel grateful to you. The other

to find a lot of old clothes to give
to poor people who could not afford to
buy any clothes for themselves. While
she was hunting around she found a

Thousands of men and women who

dread disease, Rheumatism, which is

color or rank, will be interested to
know that it is one of the easiest af
flictions of the human body to con
quer. Medical science has proven It
not a distinct disease in itself, but a
symptom caused by inactive kidneys.
Rheumatism is uric acid in the blood
and other waste products of the sys
tem which should be filtered and
strained out in the form of urine. The
function of the kidneys is to sift these
poisons and acids out and keep the
blood clean and pure. The kidneys
however, are of sponge-like substance.

times, either from overwork, cold or

in their function of eliminating these

the untold suffering and pain of rheu-
