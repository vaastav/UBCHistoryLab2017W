Washington, Dec. S. — President
Roosevelt's annual message to congress
Is a voluminous, document of nearly
30,000 words, by far the longest mes
sage he has ever submitted to congress.
The opening subject of the message is
the financial corditlon of the country,
and for which the president lays much
of the blame upon unscrupulous stock
speculators, and says:
"In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and if the conditions are
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with impunity, their
example Is a very evil thing for the
community. Where these
of great sagacity and of tem
are busi
ness
perament both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions are such
that they act without supervision or
control and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they delude
many innocent people Into making in
vestments
embarking In kinds of
business that are really unsound.
When the misdeeds ot these successful
ly dishonest men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
upon the Innocent men whom they
have misled. It Is a painful awakening,
whenever It occurs; and, naturally,
when It does occur those who suffer
are apt to forget that the longer it was
deferred the more painful it would be.
In the effort to punish the guilty it la
both wise and proper to endeavor
far as possible to minimize the dis
tress of those who have been misled by
the guilty. Yet It is not possible to
refrain because of such distress from
striving to put
that are the ultimate causes of the suf
fering, and. as a means to this end,
where possible to punish those
sponsible for them. There may be hon
est differences of opinion as to many
governmental policies; but surety there
be no such differences as to the
need of unflinching perseverance in the
war against successful dishonesty."
He quotes at length from his mes
of last year in which he advo
end to the misdeeds
sage
c..ted federal control of corporations
doing interstate business, and believes
that in such control would be found the
remedy for overcapitalization and
stock speculation which he believes
have brought about the present finan
cial conditions. He says:
"Our steady aim should be by legis
lation, cautiously and carefully under
taken, but resolutely persevered in, to
assert the sovereignty of the national
government by affirmative action.

In substance it is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regula

"No small part of the trouble that we
have comes from carrying to
treme the national virtue of self
liance, of independence in
and action. It is wise to conserve this
virtue and to provide for its fullest ex
ercise, compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become

the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation Inevitably breeds.

Bons have now
the Interstate commerce by water Is In
significant compared with the amount
that goes by land, and almost all big
business concerns are now engaged In
interstate commerce. As a result, it
can be but partially and imperfectly
controlled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states; such ac
tion inevitably tending to be either too
drastic
else too lax, and in either
Ineffective for purposes of Justice.
Only the national government can In
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. This does not mean
that there should be any extension of
federal authority, for such authority
already exists under the constitution in
amplest and most far-reaching form;
but it does mean that there should be
an extension of federal activity. This
is not advocating centralization. It is
merely looking fsQts In the face, and
realizing that centralization In business
has already come and can not be avoid
ed or undone, and that the public at
large can only protect itself from cer
tain evil effects of this business cen
tralization by providing better methods
for the exercise of control through the
authority already centralized In the
national government by the constitu
tion Itself. There must be no halt in
the healthy constructive course of ac
tion which this nation has elected to
pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur
ing the last flix years, as shown both In
the legislation of the congress and the
administration ot the law by the de
partment of justice. The most vital
need is in connection with the railroads.
As to these, in my Judgment there
should now be either a national Incor
poration act or a law licensing railway
companies to «ngage in interstate com
merce upon certain conditions. The law
.ahould be so framed as to give to the
interstate commerce commission power
to pass upon the futurs Issue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to «liable the commission, when
ever in Its Judgment it le neceesary, to
make a physical valuation of any rail
road. As 1 stated la my message to the

In existence and then attempting to de

"The congress has the power to charter
corporations to engage In Interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law
be enacted under the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and
tion* could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should be a method
of predetermining by some federal board
or commission whether the applicant for
a federal charter was an association
combination within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision should also be
made for complete publicity In ail
affecting the public and complete protec
tion to the Investing public and the share
holders In the matter of Issuing corporate
securities. If an incorporation law is not
deemed advisable, a license act for big
Interstate corporations might be enacted;
or a combination of the two might be
tried. The supervision established might
be analogous to that
national banks. At least, the antitrust
act should be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which
perlence has shown have been of most
service In enabling monopolistic combina
tions to crush out competition. The real
owners of a corporation should be com
pelled to do business in their own name.
The right to hold stock In other corpora
tions should heareafter be denied to inter
state corporations, unless
the proper government officials, and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the listing with the government of all
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning such stock and by
the corporations In which such stock is
owned.
"To confer upon the national govern

I advocate in the antitrust law, power of
supervision over big business concerns

point of the public there is need for ad

improvements in the actual handling of

government should Increase Its efforts
to conserve our forests and should In

resources of the nation he says:
"In the eastern United States the
mineral fuels have already passed into
the hands of large private owners, and
those of the went are rapidly following.
It is obvions that these fuels should he

be well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, to far
as that can still be done. What ha*
been accomplished in the great oil
fields of the Indian Territory by the
action of the administration offers a
striking example of the good rasults
of such a policy. In my judgment the
government should have the right to
keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas
fields In its own possession and to lause
ths rights to develop them ««der
proper regulations; or else, If the con
gress will not adopt this method, the
coal deposits should be sold under lim
itations. to conserve therçi as pxbllc
utilities, the right to mine coal being
separated from the title to the soil.
The regulations should permit coal
lands to be worked ip sufficient quan

excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render It necessary that
there should be either fraud or'else

inches and in September of 11.65 Inches.
Finally, in October, the record was
again eclipsed, the total excavation be
ing 1.661,719 cubic yards; a truly ex
traordinary record, especially in view
of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1
inches. In fact, experience during the
last two rainy seasons demonstrates
that the rains are a less serious ob
stacle to progress than has hitherto
been supposed.

AMERICANS WON T WORK.
Trying to Live Off Each Other In
stead of Laboring.
Washington.—"The Americans won't
work any more. They arc so busy spec
ulating ami trying to lire off each other
that they have abandoned labor, and
the foreigner collect* the wage* and
sends the money abroad."
This 1« the arraigment of the nation
delivered by Senator Reed Smoot of
Utah at the White House today. Sen
ator Smoot laid much of the blame for
the present financial stringency upon
the shoulders of hi* work-no-more coun
trymen, and Haiti he hoped the mouey
trouble* would teach them a lesnon.
"Out in my State and in the sur
rounding State* you can not find an
American laborer," said Mr. Smoot.
"All tho work I« performed by foreign
ers, mostly Greeks at present, and th«
moment, they get their pay they ship
every cent over living expenses to their
home* in the old «nun try. That mean«
more Greeks.
"I do not think that the postal bank,
as suggested by l'ostmaster-Geuera!
Meyer, or any other scheme of govern
ment guarantee would keep that money
from going across the ocean. If th«
foreigner 1* paid more money than ho
actually noed* to live on he will send il
home. Perhaps the financial panio will
teach us a lesson, and some time in th«
future the Americans will go back to
work."
SECOND ONLY TO ENGLAND
Kvtiry Nation Constructing Warship*
na Fast as They Can.
Wellington.—The Uoited Htstea has
taken her plane on the eeoond naval
power of the world—at least »0 far M
ance of tonnngo. This country today
possesses warship» registerings greater
tonnage than any other nation on th*
globe save England. This Is shown by
the annual report of Secretary of the
Navy Metes!»!, which was made publie
tonight.
This report also brings out with start
lint; clearness the faut that every na
tion on the t;lohe Is constructlnif war
ships as fast as means will permit. In
some cases, as In that of Germany, the
construction of war vessels of all type«
has been provided for for 100 years to
come.
As shown by the table submitted by
the secretary, the Unit d States pos
sesses war vessels registering in tho
aggregate 011,816 tons, and while Kng
land leads this with a registered ag > ré
gate tonnage of 1,6111,111, Japan, ar hielt
vjun said to be striding Into tho fore
front of world naval powert, stands
fifth on the result. Her aggregate
tonnage Is only .174,704. '
France Is third with an aggregate ot
800.079 tons in warships of all kinds,
while Germany Is fourth. Her aggre
gate register In war craft Is placed at
520,032.
If all tho warships now under con
struction were afloat Uncle Nam's fleet
would be third, France being second.

oggo, cx-comptroller of the currency,
made a s(>ee<'h here todajr concerning
"the present financial situation, lte
causes and leraons." He declared that
Frealdent Hoosevelt Is not responsible
for tho rocent financial stringency,
despite opinions held by critics of tba
president, and asserted that neither
could the responsibility for tho mone
tary crisis bu assigned to any particular
group of speculators In Wall street.
He said the stringency resulted from
too grant a disproportion between tba
cash in debts that are redeemable and
the. debt* themselves.

of people walking the street« of Baa
Francisco and Los Angeles who haya
no permanent work and vho were
brought In by the railroads on colonist
rates," said Kdgar J. Vesey, who baa

Is estimated that the railroads brought
