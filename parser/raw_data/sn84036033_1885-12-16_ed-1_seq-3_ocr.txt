If you are looking about for a handsome
and instructive present in the shape of a
book, buy Patience Stapleton's volume of
sketches, entitled "The Major's Christ
mas, and Other Stories.." It is a good,
pure, wholesome book, for the reading of
which mankind will be the better. Mrs.
Stapleton's name is familiar to magazine
readers, as a charming writer of light
fiction. The story given the first place
in her book is not by any means the best
"At Dresden b.v the Sea," is a delightful
Christmas story. It fairly beams with
cheer and is beautifully' tonder in its senti
ment. The character Sue is particularly
well drawnf and it is done in a few words.
And there is an atmosphere about the farm
house of Luther Trask that is refreshingly'
natural. One of the bright stories in this
book has been specially written for E. A.
Buck, Esq., of New York, who will publish
it in the Christinas edition of his great pa
lier, the Spirit of the Times. There is no
more charming book for the Christmas
tide.
The police authorities in Washington,
District of Columbia, are in a quandary' to
know what disposition to make of a drunken
officer connected with the Chilian legation,
named Senor Del Campos, who îh in tiie
habit of getting on a spree every week or
two and trying to tear up the town. He
lias repeatedly been arrested and taken
home in a hack, because the divinity which
hedges around the King protects a member
of the diplomatic corps also. The police
men are tired of paying hack-hire to take
the youn g ma n to his lodgings, as it would
be a cause for war if he was locked up in a
cell like any' ordinary drunkard. The Chief
of Police thinks that if his antics are to oc
cur regularly in the future, that there should
be some special provisions made for his
disposition. This fellow's immunity from
arrest is owing to the stiff, unbending prin
ciple of the law of nations, which exempts
foreigners connected with embassies from
fine and imprisonment. There ought to be
international houses of correction estab
lished for the care of such characters.

Political principles are very often in
bred and it does seem as though in many
instances they, like other family traits,
a re inheritable and pass down from gener
ation to generation. There are, in our
national history, cases recorded showing
that sons have become prominent in po
litical organizations that their fathers
were distinguished members of. There are
also many cases showing that the sons
have cast their destiny with the party op
posed to the one to which their fathers be
longed to. The latter,there is a good reason
lor believing, inherit their political senti
ments from their mothers, especially if the
fathers happened to be Whigs or Republi
cans, as the following clearly shows: The
little son of Mr. James G. Blaine's next
friend, Mr. "Steve" Elkins, whom about
four years ago Mr. Elkins named for Mr.
Blaine, .becomes furiously angry whenever
any one, on hearing his name, asks if lie is
named for James G. Blaine, and exclaims:
"No I ain't named for that old Jim Blaine
and I wouldn't be. If you say that again
I'll hit you." He even made this saucy de
nial to Mr. Blaine himself, although the
latter, when the child was named, presented
him with a silver cup and saucer, spoofi
and rattle in a very handsome case in
scribed with his name. Mr. Elkins' wife is
a daughter of ex-Senator Davis, of West
Virginia, one of the staunchest Democrats
in the land. Mrs. Elkins coming from a
Democratic stock it was only natural that
the children should be imbued with the
true faith politically, which means De
mocracy.

The proverb which says that "it is better
to be born lucky than rich," may be aome
consolation to those who envy such as
have inherited wealth. Those, however,
who are envious of riches cannot have
much praise to bestow upon others who
have been more fortunate than themselves;
because luck, in the sense it is used in the
proverb, means something which has led to
wealth. Generally luck and riches go hand
in hand together. Success in business, pol
itics, speculation, gambling, war, or any
thing else, is said to be luck. Luck, there
fore, generally brings riches or fame, and
excites the irascibility of the envious.
Those who are lucky or rich care very little
for the opinions or others, especially of the
covetous.
The legatees named in the will of the late
William H. Vanderbilt may be said to be
both lucky and rich, for they have been so
fortunate as to fall heirs to immense wealth,
and at the same time were born rich, be
cause Cornelius Vanderbilt, the father of
William, was ranked as a millionaire before
the present generation was born. The elder
Vanderbilt was ambitious to be the ances
tor df a long line of millionaires; hence he
bequeath«^ to his eldest son ninety mil
lions. This immense sum his fortunate
legatee, in the short space of six years, in
cieased to the fabulous fortune of two
hundred millions of dollars, and had ;
scarcely time to calculate his wealth when
he, without warning, was called away from
life, leaving behind him a limited number of
lucky heirs.
The widow, she who doubtless contributed
much by her advice and counsel, and the
proper management of the household, to
increase her husband's wealth, docs not
appear to have been one of the lucky ones,
for she has been cut off with an allowance
of only two hundred thousand per annmn
during her life, together with the use of the
mansion appurtenances, and the right to
will, to whom she pleases. $500,000 out oi
the estate. This bequest is subject to the
payment of taxes and other expenses inci
dent to the management of the real estate
left her. At the same time the children re
ceive five millions eacli and the income of
$70,000,000 to be divided equally among
them, there being eight of them. After
leaving $1,000,000 to a grandson, the tes
tator bequeathes $1,300,000 to public in
stitutions, and gives the balance of his
estate to two sons, Cornelius and William
K. Vanderbilt.
The two last mentioned are more lucky
than the others, for they received equal
shares in the provisions made for all the
children, and one-half of the residue,
which amounts to nearly fifty millions
each. This is an unfair distribution, no
matter how it may be considered. The
widow, although she may be well provided
for, ought to have had the income of one
third of the whole estate during her life
time, to dispose of as she might deem
proper. In some States, the Legislatures
have been wise and considerate enough to
equitably protect thî widow in her rights
by providing that she shall enjoy one
third part of the rents, issues and profits
of the real estate during life, and one-third of
the personal property absolutely where
there are children and a much larger share
where there are none. This is the better rule
because the wife should always be con
sidered a partner with the husband in the
accumulation of money or other valuable
property, hence, when death dissolves the
partnership, she should have her share in
the assets.

In Pennsylvania, the widow's one-tliird,
or dower, as it is known in the common
law, cannot he destroyed by a testamentary
disposition of the testator's property. If
this rule prevailed in New York, Mrs. Van
derbilt.could claim and efijoy that which
she is justly and equitably entitled to.
There is no instance on record of a com
bination or luck and riches leading to the
acquisition of such an immense fortune as
that willed by the late William H. Vander
bilt. He was born rich, and afterwards
was lucky enough to inherit from his father
ninety million dollars, and in the ßhort
space of six years to increase that fabulous
sum more than double. He is reputed to
have been the richest man in the world.
This distinction, no doubt, was the only
ambition of his life. The millions he
accumulated were derived from specula
tions; and as the hundreds, or even thou
sands, of dollars, wrung from others to
make up his great wealth, passed into his
hands, the losers were compelled to endure
untold mental and physical sufferings. The
penitentiaries groan with his victims, who,
in order to extricate themselves from his
iron grasp, were tempted to use trust
moneys, in their charge, and thus become
defaulters and criminals.
How much better it would have been for
the communities from which the millions
forming the wealth of Mr. Vanderbilt were
drawn, had he, after amply providing
for his family, bequeathed the immense
surplus to relieve the impoverished and dis
tressed. Such an act would havo partially
atoned for the misery the accumulation of
the immense fortune caused those who were
compelled to contribute toward it.
The raid against polygamy in Utah is
daily increasing in rigor, which shows that
the Mormons must go. Judge Boieman, of
the Second District, recently, in charging
the Grand Jury, said, among other things,
that "certain district judges had been
loudly praised for their leniency in cases of
polygamy or unlawful cohabitation, but
as for himself he eared nothing for the
blessings of this people, and, in fact, would
rather have their curses than not; that
men, women and children had always per
j ured themselves in cases brought under
the Edmund's law, and that as in the past
so they would undoubtedly do in the fu
ture when in the witness chair; that the
jnry would notice tluft fact and that the
proper place for such persons was the peni
tentiary." Yes, those who perjure them
selves to screen their cohorts in this in
famous crime, must also be taught
obedience to the laws of the land. When a
few examples are made of the vile per
jurers, as Judge Boremgm proposes, there
will be no more acquittals in polygamy
cases.
The ladies of St. James Church, of Butte,
are now engaged in completing the prepara
tions for their great fair, which begins at 2
o'clock to-morrow. The fair will be held in
the Court House, and will be one of the so
ciety events of the season. A debt of $3,000
now rests on the rectory, and to liquidate
this indebtedness the ladies have in
augurated this enterprise. The cause is in
deed a worthy one and will readily com
mend itself to the generous people of the
camp. The enterprise, energy and laudable
ambition of the ladies having the matter in
hand will enlist the sympathies of the
men, who have nothing in the world to do
hut to come forward and spend their money
for the many handsome things that will
be displayed for sale. Even those who
have no intention of purchasing should at
tend to feast their eyes on the many beau
tiful articles that the intelligent eyes and
fingers of the ladies have wrought in this
cause. The fair will, undoubtedly, be a
great success from the beginning, and it will
close with : 'a pink and blue party," a nov
elty in the way of parties.
The New Year Miner will not make any
pretense at being a history of Montana,
though it will contain a large amount of
historical matter. It will be in the nature
of a handbook, rather, to which any ona

to go for information. No one can afford
to be without it. Leave your orders at
the office now.

The Miner is informed that there is on foot
a movement to bring about the removal of
Postmaster Smith and to secure, in a quiet
manner, the «appointment of a Democrat
in his place. The whole movement is
characterized by stealth and dark-lantern
methods. It is said that a petition has
been circulated in one portion of the city—
mainly by Republicans—in the interest of
a gentleman well known in the community,
and that he received some signers.
The position of The Miner upon the sub
ject of changes in office is well known. It
believes that a. change in the party in
power should mean a change in every sub
ordinate office also. The President re
quires the hearty co-operation of Demo
cratic office-holders in bringing about the
reforms he has in view. An army of office
holders arrayed against an administration
—no matter howsoever wise and good—
would render it powerless for good. Wo
believe that "to the victors belong the
spoils." We believe that every Republican
office-holder should be displaced by a
Democrat. Therefore, we believe that
Postmaster Smith should be removed,
with the rest, as a party measure and as a
natural sequence of a political revolution.
We do, however, make tiie proviso that
the Democrat who succeeds him shall be in
every respect as good a man, and that he
shall be acceptable to 1 he rank and file of
the Democratic party.
There is no appointment within the gift
of the President in which the people of
Butte are so universally interested as in
that of postmaster. He is a man with
whom they all have dealings—even down
to the little toddlers, who receive their
Easter cards, birthday mementoes and the
tokens of the Christmas-tide U-crin "the
postman."
The Postmaster holds a semi-conliden
tial relation to the whole people. He is to
a degree the custodian of many of
their secrets. He should be a man
generally satisfactory to the masses,
and one, at least, who lias the
confidence of the whole community. He
should be an honest man and a, so'ot r one.
He should be a man of the strictest integ
rity and the purest honor. His record
should be stainless and his every act above
suspicion. He should come from the best
elements of society and be endorsed gener
ally by the business community. He
should be a man of business training and
business habits. He should possess execu
tive ability and the faculty of systematiz
ing so complex a business.
Such men are not scarce in the Demo
cratic ranks, if they are only looked for.
They rarely seek an office, however, and
the place must seek them. For that
reason we oppose any dark-lantern
schemes and efforts to fill the office by
stealth. Let the people have a choice in
the matter, or a chance, at least, to give
expression to their preference. This is all
that they ask, and that much should be
accorded them.
The Miner does not believe that Dele
gate Toole or Postmaster General Vilas
will fall into any such trap, or that they
will lend themselves to such a scheme. No
change will be made at once, and the
people will be given a chance to speak.

Many criminals have been permitted to
escape punishment in consequence of the
heavy expense of trving and supporting
them after conviction. It is a very rare
thing, however, for them to be allowed to
run at large when accused of capital
offenses. The taking of the life of a human
being is so revolting to the sensibilities of
communities as to impel them generally to
incur expenses, without limit, to bring the
accused to the bar of justice. In'October.
1884, an Italian laborer was murdered in
Delaware county,Pennsylvania, and robbed
of §200 by a companion, who escaped. The
authorities subsequently traced the mur
derer to Italy. When the District Attorney
learned of the murderer's whereabouts,
through the Italian Consul at Philadelphia,
he notified the Chief of Police and the Coro
ner. The District Attorney sent the com
munications of the Italian Consul to the
County Commissioners. He knew it was
the county's place to bring hack the mur
derer; that a man would have to be sent to
Italy to bring him back and that a young
girl would ha ve to be brought also as a wit
ness. The County Commissioners got out
their pencils and began to figure. They did
not think so much Of the shocking murder
as they did of the number of dollars it
would take to bring the murderer back. It
was plain that it would take $500 to com
plete the job, and maybe twice that amount,
so they conclded that the murderer of the
taliau laborer was too expensive to be
hanged, and so he was never sent for. This
is a species of economy with which the peo
ple of the Northwest are unfamiliar, for it
is no uncommon thing in this region to
offer as high as §1,000 reward for the ap
prehension of horse thieves; but when
murderer is wanted neither time nor ex
pense are spared to bring him to justice.
John Roach is still on deck. The in
solvent iron ship builder who contracte!
to construct four iron cruisers for the Gov
ernment, under the Arthur administration,
has nm lost all his vitality yet, and still
clings, like grim death, to his old method
formerly so successfully employed by him for
the purpose of influencing officers any! othe
connected with the Navy Department. It
will be remembered that of the four vessels
contracted to bo built by him, only the
"Dolphin" was ready for delivery at the
time of his failure. This vessel was at first
rejected, because she had not- been con
structed according to the contract; but
owing to the fact that Mr. Arthur's Secre
tary of the.Navy had advanced Mr. Roacli
nearly all the money due on her, Mr. Whit
ney, the present Secretary, was compelled
to accept her conditionally. Mr. Roach
being unable to finish the other three, the
Government took them off his hands.
The second vessel, the "Chicago,"* was
launched at Chester, Pennsylvania, on the
5th inst. The launch is described as being
one of the most successful ever witnessed.
Mr. Roach arrived in Chester from New
York the day before the launch, and imme
diately set about making preparations for
a gala day, as in the time when launches
were made under his ow n auspices. He
purchased a large number of hams and a
box full of turkeys, which were turned over
to the caterer with instructions to put
them into an edible shape. At 4 o'clock in
the afternoon the hams were thrown into a
cauldron of hot water and the turkeys were
prepared for roasting. At this point in the
preparations a wagon dro\e up in post
haste and a messenger from Mr. Roach told
the caterer that the lunch was off. The
parboiled hams were fished out of the caul
dron and, together with the turkeys, were
loaded on a wagon and returned to the
grocer from whom they were purchased.
The ex-contractor disco .-ered that Mr.
Whitney's officers are not allowed to par
ticipate in big feeds set up for the purpose
of perverting their judgment and influencing
them to disregard such defects as may be
apparent in the construction of the ship.

for their silly fears as unsparingly as they
did then; but many of the Gentiles still
believe that if prompt action had not been
taken last July there would haye been an
uprising, and there is at least no harm in
j preparing for an event that may possibly
I happen at almost any time. The relations
between the Mormons and the Government
; have been getting strained more and more
! every month, since the recent prosecutions
! under the Edmunds law began. The
most prominent Mormon leaders have been
driven to flight, and are now compelled to
address the faithful from a safe distance,
instead of face to face, while many
polygamists have been sent to jail, and the
rest are sure to follow. In this strained
state of affairs the United States Marshals
are regarded with peculiar hatred by the
Mormons, and it was an assault on one of
these by a gang of Mormon rowdies that
has brought on the present crisis. Marshal
Collin, when assaulted, drew his pistol and
shot one McMurrin, who has since died of
his wounds. Collin gave himself into cus
tody and is now awaiting trial. The Mor
mons, however, regard the shooting
of McMurrin as a high-handed mur
der, and threaten to lynch Col
lin if they can get him. So omi
nous have been their muttering? about
this matter, and so significant the utter
ances of their newspaper organs, that the
Gentiles—who are outnumbered three or
tour to one in Salt Lake, and more than
that almost everywhere else in the Terri
tory —are naturally somewhat anxious and
like to know that there is a sufficient force
at Fort Douglas to suppress any uprising
that may possibly occur. It might be bet
ter in tiie end if the Mormons should resort
to arms, but it would bring about a great
deal of present evil, and tiie Government is
bound to prevent any fesurt to force if it
can do so by a show of strength before
hand."
The Appellate Court of the Third Dis
trict of Illinois has just given a decision of
extraordinary interest regarding the re
sponsibility of bank directors for the safe
keeping of bank deposits. The facts are
reported as follows: "Gardner Case was a
depositor in the Bank of Bunker Hill, III.,
and John Delano and others weredirectors.
The bank failed, and Case hrought. suit
against Delano and others, individually,
to recover the amount of his deposits, rest
ing his claim upon the ground that as such
officers they were bound to know the
financial condition of the bank; and the
acceptance of his deposits after they might,
by exercising due diligence, have known the
fact of its insolvency, constituted a per
sonal and individual responsib lity to him.
The trial of the issue was had before Judge
Jesse J. Phillips in the Circuit Court of
Macoupin County, where judgment was
rendered in favor of Case. The defendants
appealed and the Appellate Court new
affirms the judgment of the Court below."
This, says an exchange, is a new departure
in rulings upon this question, and if it is
made the law of the land, as we believe it
should be, it will greatly lessen
tiie number of hank robberies hv
hank officials in the future. Directors
are supposed to direct, hut as a matter of
fact bank directors as a rule are mere
figureheads, whose names are used for the
purpose of promoting confidence in the in
stitutions with which they arc connected.
They usually leave the management of the
bank's affairs to some officer who does as
he pleases with the fluids. Of course, if
the man thus trusted is honest, competent
and careful, everything goes well; but if the
bank is robbed by a trusted president or
cashier, the directors immediately piead
the baby act and declare that they never
knew what was going on. We believe that
bank directors should be held individually
responsible to the full extent of their pri
vate means for any fosses that may be suf
fered by depositors through dishonest or
incompetent management-, and we have no
doubt that if this rule were generally ap
plied the number of bank failures wounld
soon he reduced to a minimum.

The railroad companies of the West have
fallen into a bud habit of attempting to
muzzle the press in case of accidents on
their roads. This is as foolish as it is un
wise. The press cannot be muzzled. It
will get the facts anyway, and in pursuance
of a demand from its readers will publish
them. The charge that newspapers are
''afraid of railroads," or influenced by them
to suppress facts, is not well-founded. The
railroads invariably get more from the
newspapers than they give to them. They
ire, as a rule, dead heads, both as to ad
vertising and subscription, and the occa
sional trip or annual pass is doubly paid
Ihi the other hand, the charge of sen
sationalism, to the extent of preferring
falsehood to truth, made against the press
is equally untrue. In an extended experi
ence. covering fifteen years of active work
in city and country, we have never yet
found a newspaper man who preferred
falsehood to truth. No class of men will
work harder to obtain facts and to verify
rumors than reporters. Railroad com
panies would serve themselves, the public
and the press by giving reporters every
facility for gathering news and especially
in gaining facts in case of accidents. Thus
the truth only would be given to the !
world, the names of killed and injured
would bo correctly published and public feel
ingand the anxiety of those ha vingrelations
and friends on a wrecked train would be
allayed. A great Eastern railroad em
ploys a man who, in addition to other
literary work, furnishes the press with full
details of every accident that otcurs on the
road. These reports are absolutely correct,
and no effort is. made in them to shield
either the company or its employes. Why
should not die Union Pacific and the
Northern Pacific adopt this course, in
stead of sealing the lips of their employes
under penalty of discharge and even going
so far as to attempt to close the service of
the Western Union Telegraph Company
against the peess. The Miner will at no
time spare labor or expense in securing re
ports of accidents. It will always be glad
to take the statements of the officials of
the road, but it does not propose that any
aristocratic airs on the part of officials
shall prevent it from getting and publish
ing the new. If the telegraph offices are to
be closed against us, as an effort was made
at Missoula some time ago, we shall have
to resort to the mails. We want to be on
friendly terms with the railroads, but we
want news a good deal more.

The jury system in Iowa does not ap
pear to have made much progress, and the
actions of some juries there are not calcu
lated to inspire much confidence in litgia
tion. A case was tried last week at Eldora,
in that State, in which one Charles Hender
son was the defendant. The jury had been
out some time, and being unable to agree
they resolved to decide the case upon a toss
of a penny. In this case it was "heads I
win, tails you lose," sure enough, for by
the toss they were to render a verdict < f
not guilty, but instead of that they came
into court next morning with a verdict c f
guilty: Judge Henderson having been ad
vised of this "inis-flip," set the verdict
aside. This does not speak well for a State
that turns out an army of lawyers from
her law schools, twice a year. She had
better stop flooding the country with law
yers and use her schools to train jurymen.
The new Congressman must experience a
feeling of disappointment when entering
upon the duties of his office, for all his ex
alted opinions of the dignity of his position
are dissipated when he finds that-he isonl
a small atom in the great body of men
forming Congress. A correspondent of the
Philadelphia Daily News thus graphically
describes him: "If there is any display of
dignity it is made by the new Congressman,
who is present one hundred and thirty
strong. But who can blame him? Remem
ber that in many cases he has just arrived
from a town where, when he made his de
parture, there was no greater man than
he and where all eyes were centered upon
him. He is not yec aware that his indi
vidual greatness has been absorbed by the
superior greatness of the body of which he
is a small, fractional part. He does not
yet know that the great speech he has pre
pared with so much care will never have
any other audience than what the looking
glass exhibits to him in his rehearsing
pangs. Very few men in the House do any
talking. The power of the Speaker, under
what is known as the Randall rule, is abso
lute. A man might be a Congressman for
ten years and if the Speaker sees fit to ig
nore him he might as well talk to the waves
on the Kanischatkan shore as endeavor to
secure recognition. There is exactly one
day in the session when a member, if he
happens to be chairman of one of the sixty
committees, may get a chance to be heard
for one hour, despite the Speaker; but
events may occur that might even deprive
him of this right."

TELLERISM.
The Senate has been .in session long
enough to have given some attention to the
abuses in the Interior Department under
the Arthur administration. The fraudu
lent land entries and general corruption
that obtained in the land and Indian de
partments are facts of history. Mr. Teller
used his office in the most disgraceful man
ner to further his political ends. The In
terior Department was the most serious
blot on the Arthur administration. The
most damaging things have been revealed
and others are constantly coming to light
It is the plain duty of the Senate to order
an investigation of the affairs of this De
partment. The fact that Mr. Teller is now
a Senator should not cause justice to be
thwarted. "Senatorial courtesy" should
not be allowed to interfere with the fullest
and freest investigation of the land and In
dian offices, at any rate.
If Mr. Teller is satisfied that his office
was honestly conducted, that his agents
have'been belied and lie villified, he should
be the first to move for the investigation.

and Envoy Extraordinary to the imperial
Court of Austria. Two such overtacts of
discourtesy, following each other so closely,
would not only havesevered the diplomatic
gelations between any two European Gov
ernments, but would have caused open war
fare. The attitude of Austria towards the
United States is not such an one as is cal
culated to enlist the sympathies of other
Nations, but will doubtless receive their
well-merited condemnation. The relations
previously existing between the two coun
tries bave been of the most amicable char
acter, ever since the formation of the
American Union. There having been,
during all that time, not even a ripple of
disturbance in the diplomatic relations,
except such a trifling one as may have been
occasioned by the forcible arrest of one
Martin Kosta, by Austrian naval officers
in the Bay of Tripoli, over thirty years
ago
In the diplomatic controversy growing
out of the Kosta case, the same principles
of international policy were involved as
will doubtless be considered in discussing
and determining Austria's recent action of
ostracism against German Americans.
Martin Kosta was born in Austria, emi
grated to the United States, and in due
course of time became under our naturali
zation laws, entitled to all the rights of
citizenship. Some years afterwards he was
taken from an American vessel lying in the
Bay of Tripoli, Africa, by Austrian naval
officers and imprisoned upon some politi
cal charge. He was shortly afterwards
discharged upon a peremptory demand
for his release being made by Commander
Ingram, of one of our naval ships on that
station. This led to a long diplomatic con
troversy between the two Governments,
out of which our Government came vie
torious, through Hon. William L. Marcy
Secretary of State under President Pierce.
As Austria was compelled to take water in
that case, so she will doubtless do in the
controversy which will grow out of her
recent order imposing disabilities upon
America n naturalized citizens sojourning in
her domains, provided diplomatic relations
are again restored.
The restoration of diplomatic relations
between the two countries may he more
difficult than most of our people at present
imagine. From present appearances it
looks as though President Cleveland may
exhaust our diplomatic material in his
efforts to secure a minister who, in person,
together with his family and their lineal
and collateral connections, may all be free
from any religious professions that might
by any possibility offend the refined spirit
ual sensibilities of -the «esthetic court
Vienna. No Jews need apply. So, at least,
the august, dignified, proscriptive, fanati
cal, imperial and stupid asses, who run
the Austrian superannuated governmental
machine say. Mr. Keiley, the American Min
ister appointed by President Cleveland, was
rejected for no other reason than, accord
ing to Austria's ideas of the qualifications
of an Envoy Extraordinary, his having
wedded by civil marriage a Jewess. Be
cause of this unpardonable canonical of
fense his presence at Vienna would be un
tenable -even impossible. Angels and min
isters of grace defend us? Can it be possi
hie in this Nineteenth century, that such
fanaticism exists among an enlightened
people and in an imperial court? If such a
reason had been advanced by the King of
the Cannibal Islands, a century ago, for
preventing a missionary to land, it would
have shocked the civilized world.
There are 1,125.000 Jews in Austria and,
excepting Russia, more than there are tobe
found in the combined countries in Europe
and nearly three times as many as there are
in America. Is it possible that the Austri
ans persist in persecuting these people as
did the Romans one thousand yeurs ago?
If so, it is high time the civilized nations of
the earth came to the rescue of those down
trodden peopie and destroyed the tyranni
cal system which oppresses them. The time
has arrived when religious liberty should br
proclaimed throughout the world and
when no man, sect or creed should he per
secuted for their opinion's sake. In Amer
ica, thank God, all men and women are
privileged to worship according to the die
tates of their own consciences. There is no
distinction before the laws between Jews
and Christians, and there should be none
any where else. Mr. Keiley's wife, as an
American women, is the peer of those whose
brows are encased in coronets of gold and
precious stones in the monarchies of the
old world, and as such she is entitled to as
much respect and kindness; yes, and even
homage, as the proudest empress, queen or
princess in Europe. Yet weak, sick, dying
superannuated Austria summons strength
enough between her gasping paroxisms to in
sult the United States and all other civil
ized nations, by saying our representative,

No wonder that Secretary Bayard says
to the Austrian Minister: "The question
