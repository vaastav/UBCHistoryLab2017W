departments' who are chiefly charged with the
executive work of the government. In an ef
fort to abridge this cammunieation as m-ich
a- to consist- it with ita purpose, I shill
supplement a brief reference to the contents of
these departmental reports by the mention of
such executive business .ind incidents a- are not
embraced th re And by such recommendations
as appear to be at this particular lime appro
priate. While our foreign relations have not at I
all limes during the past ye ar been entirely
free from perplexity no embarrassing situation j
remains that will not ield to !h Stlirlt of fair- 1
neps .ind love of justice, which joined witb con
sistent fairness characterizes a truly American
foreign policy. ,
Foreign Affairs.
My predecessor having accepted the office
of arbitrator of thrt long standing bound
ary disputes, tendered to tie president
by the Argentine; republic and Brazil, it has
been mv agreeable duty to receive the special
envoys commissioned b.- those states to lay be
fore me evidence and arguments In behalf of
their respective governments. The outbreak 1
of domestic hostilities in the republic of '
lirazi! found th United States alert to watch
the interest of our citizens in thatcountr ? with
which we carrv on important commerce Sev
er il vessels of our new nav- are now, and for
some time have been stationed at Hio do
Janeiro The struggle being between the es
tablished government, which controls the
machinery of administration. and with
which we maintain friendly relations and
certain officers of the navy employing
th- vessels of their command in an attack
upon the national capital and chief seaport,
and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided
administration, I have failed to see that the
insurgents can reasonably claim recognition as
bellfeerant3. This far the position of our gov
ernment has been that of an attentive but an
impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict
In passing.our fixed policy of impartial neutral

I deem it neeessar I to disallow in a

The questions nffectiu-r our relations with
Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of
fri. ndliness. Ne otiations are in progress be
tween lhe two governments with a view to
such concurrent action as will make the award
and regulation aereed upon bv the Behring
pea tribu al of arbitration practically effective,
and it is not doubted that Great Britain will
co-operate freely with this country for the ac
complishment of that purpose. The dispute
growing out of the discrimination tolls imposed
in the Wetland canal upon cargoes
of cereals bound to and from the
laVe ports of the United States, was adjusted
bv the substitution of a more equitable sched
ule of charges and mv predecessor thereupon
suspende his proclamation imposing iscrimi
nating tolls upon British transit th ough our
canals. A q est for additions to the list of
extr.iditable offenses covered by the existing
treaty between the two countries is under con

It is. hardlv nece-sary for me to state that

been subv-rted with the active aid of
our representatives to that g vernment and
through the intimidation caused by :he pres
ence of :vl arm -d naval force of the United
Seates which was landed for that purpose at
the instance of our minister. Upon the facts
developed it seemed to me the oniy honorable
course for our government to pursue was to
undo the wrong that had been done by those
representing us and to restore as far as prac

The Treasury.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the government from all sources
during lhe fiscal year ended June 3 1. 1 8.-3,

$58. 485," 17. The sum paid from the treasury
for sugar bounty was $S,713 .8-t. an increase
over the preceding year of $ ,031,053 oft.

river and in tue central and southern states
The total number of banks in existence on the
Slst day of October, laftt, was 3,7ft i, having an
aggregate capi al of .695,55 ,12i. 1 h net in

the year was :3 -8 5.872. The recent repeal of
the provision of law r-. quirin-r the purchase of
si.ver bullion by the overnment as a feat ire
of our monetary scheme has made an entire
change in th" c molexi. n of our currency af
fairs I do not doubt that the ul imate result
of this action will be most salutary an 1 far
reaching.
In the nature of thin.-s. however, it is impoi

Kxee-.'ion of this law in its early stair, s does
no -co in to have been in accord with its true

construction has been fo' .vc d T :s had the
effe-. t of limiting the operai m at he law to its
intended purpose- The disc v.-rv having been

pension roil by me ins of srh. le- le and gi.'-antic
frauds, the commissioner susn tntfed payments
upon a number of pensions wbieb seemed to be
fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete
examm.fci.ion, giving noti.e to :he pensioners,
in order tbat the might have un opportunity
to e3 abrisb, if po-sible, the justice of their
claims notwithstanding app .r- at invalidity.
This, I unders-and, is the practice which has
for a long t me prev 1 -d i i the rend n bureau,
but after en t-ring upon :;e recent in vestia

not to allow, until after a com-le'e examina

why fra' ds m t e pension office should not be

THE NEW HANDSHAKE.
With Some Reference to Hand
nhalftng in General
The w Style Would Probably Kid .the
Country of the Habit TTatlmlj B
Ways That Are pa If Irian grae
The fear is expressed by one of
our esteemed contemporaries at the
east that the world's fair may fasten
on the country "for good and all"
the new handshake which has the
sanction of the prince of Wales,
Ward McAllister and other celebri
ties. It would be a great pity, says
the Detroit Free Press. One can
hardly conceive of a more ridiculous
spectacle than that which would be
presented by a nation so addicted as
ours is to shaking hands adopting
the latest wrinkle. Americans, as
a rule, shake hands whenever they
meet, and the sight of any consider
able number of them standing on
the street or elsewhere with their
hands at the level of their eyes, do
ing the new thing in shakes, would
be calculated to create the impres
sion that we are a nation of imbe
ciles. And if it should ever be
adopted to the extent that it would
prevail at presidential receptions
and other functions the extra labor
entailed on entertainers and enter
tained will tend to make national im
becility something more than imag
inary. In one direction there is hope.
The attempt to establish the new
fad may help to bring all hand
shaking into disrepute and thus
profit the nation. There are some
handshakes with which we would
not willingly part, but there are so
many which are an abomination that
for the sake of getting rid of the latter
we can well afford to sacrifice them
all. There is the vise-like clasp
which the perpetrator fondly be
lieves exhibits in an attractive way
his affection for the recipient, when
it only crushes the latter's bones
and makes him wish that the shaker
had paralysis. Quite as obnoxious,
though less painful in the infliction,
is the shake of the man or woman
though it is of tener man than woman
who does not know when the
shake is over. These are they who
hang on to the hand with a gentle
but tenacious pressure, intended to
express a lingering fondness, until
you are fairly wild for release. And
the worst of it is that they feel just
as anxious to be through with it as
you do, but do not know how to let
go any better than some men do
when they have brought in "on the
ground floor" to a scheme which
proves to have no other floor.
But worse than all, there are the
handshakers who simpty invite you
to take their hands and never dream
of doing their share of the shake.
With thumb held rigidly back from
inclosing contact, they permit you
to shake them and give you about as
much pleasure as you would receive
from contact for an equal length of
time with the lin of an inanimate
codfish. If the new fad will only rid
us of this detestable form of the
handshake it will be thrive welcome,
with all its unattractiveness.
Senator Stanford's Horses.
The late Senator Stanford never
would permit anyone employed on
his big stock farm at Palo Alto, Cal.,
to abuse one of his horses. Whip
ping was not allowed. ''When you
handle a horse," he would say to his
men, "treat him a little better than
anyone else does." The result was
the finest stock ranch in America;
but there is no evidence that the
men who worked for him were any
better than other trainers and hos
tlers. A story is told by a gentle
man who was dining with the sen
ator. Just after the dinner one of
the drivers insisted that he must see
Mr. Stanford. He was ushered in,
with blood over his faee, which was
badly cut. "John knocked me
down," explained the man, referring
to one of the trainers.
'"What did you do?" asked the
senator.
"Nothing," replied the man.
"But you must have done some
thing. I want the truth," persisted
the senator.
"I kicked a horse, and John
knocked me down," said the man.
"Those were John's instructions,
and I think he did just right," said
the senator.
Too New.
Father So you want to marry
my daughter. Have you any vices?
Suitor No, sir. I don't smoke or
play cards and never touched a drop
of liquor. Not only that, sir, but I
have never kissed a girl in my life.
Father Well, young man. you go
and learn how and then I'll talk to
-j-ou. Judge.
