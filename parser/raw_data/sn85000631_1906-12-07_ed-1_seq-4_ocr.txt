OFFICIAL ESTRAY PAPER FOR STATE
OF NORTH DAKOTA.
FRIDAY. DECEMBER 7, 190G.
If you want some interesting
reading, read President Roosevelt's
message.
It is a nice thing to live in
coal belt along with the oranges
and lemons.
Congress convened last Monday.
This session is liable to prove an
interesting one as many questions
of national importance will come
before it.
All over the state a cry of "car
shortage" has gone up and the cry
has been so long and vigorous that
those in high places are awakening
to the fact that there is going to
be something doing in the near
future. The loss to the farmers of
the state through the shortage of
cars, is hard to estimate, but will
reach a large sum. In many of
the places the farmers are unable
to dispose of their grain and in
consequence thereof are unable to
meet their bills and the tradesman
must suffer with them. The Min
neapolis Journal has taken up the
matter and is doing good work in
giving it publicity. Congressman
Marshall has also takea up tin
car shortage question and it is now
up to the Railroad Commissiners
to see what they can do. The peo
ple of Washburn have been very
fortunate so far in being able to
get cars for grain shipment.
An Explanation.
Mr. Editor: I should like to be
permitted to make a short explan
ation to your Readers in regard to
a certain scurrilous attack made
upon the character of our county
superintendent of schools on the
eve of election .'v The matter to
which I refer was an affidavit pur
porting to be made by the Rev. S
H. Gray and sworn to before me,
as a notary public.
I did take an acknowledgement
for Mr. Gray at that time and very
likely for i.the instrument under
consideration.'..
At this point I wish to make it
clear to all the readers of this pa
per just what connection a notary
public has in connection with pa
pers that are acknowledged before
him. The notary public's busi
ness is to see that a document is
signed by the identical person rep
resented as signer and to determine
that such person signs the docu
ment as his free act and deed and
to administer oaths. The notary
public simply verifies these
facts to the public. He does
not usually know what is in
the instrument he acknowledges.
Moreover, it is none of his busi
ness what the instrument con
tains. Indeed, the notary who at
tempts to read what is in the pa
pers he acKnowledges is frequent
ly reminded that it is none of his
business what the subject matter
is. For the reason stated I did
not know what the affidavit con
tained for the reasons stated, also,
it was none of my business what
the papers contained.
I am not attempting to deter
mine the truth or falsity of the
statements made in the affidavit.
The man whose character is tra
duced is present and in among
friends and hence competent to
defend himself. The young wo
man, whom many of us kenw and
remember as a respectable and es
timable girl is absent and defense
less. Such a report whether true
or false made public and circulat
ed by one who should be her natur
al friend and protector, deserves
our severest condemnation.
There are a good many people
in the county who have been led
to believe that I must have known
the nature of the document and to
some extent endorsed the state
ments therein when I administered
the oath and acknowledged the
signature of the maker of the affi
davit. It is for these reasons es
pecially that I wish to thus pub
lieally testify that I knew nothing
of the nature of the affidavit and
that I utterly and unqualifiedly
condemn it as indecent, scurrilous,
and unfit for publication, whether
true or false. J. M. Casey,

Tuesday evpning Violet Gradin,
dughterof Sheriff Gradin, lit a lamp
in her room up stairs, and when she
turned the wick down the kerosene
in some way caught fire. The
child did not know what to do and,
carried the lamp around when'
Mrs. Gradin told her to throw it
quickly. The child did so, just in
time, for a terrible explosion oc
curred the moment the lamp was
out of her hand. It strucK on the
cement floor, and fortunately no
damage wad done. The fire was
quickly smothered with 'a blanket
which Mrs. Gradin took from a
bed near.
The woes of a county treasurer
are many and it is a wonder that
they are always in such good hu
mor (present company excepted.)
The other morning we called at the
court house as the treasurer was
going through the mail. One let
ter contained a check for taxes due,
but no description of land or for
what the money was to be used
for. Another asked for the amount
of his taxes, bi forgot to sign his
name. This fellow will prolSably
say hard words about the treasurer
because no reply was received.
It should be remembered that the
county treasurer has spmwhere in
the neighborhood of 75,000'names

EXPLANATION:
Calculating, that it would not pay to run the Restaurant during the winter months
we decided to convert the Restaurant into a Music Store and consequently bought
home a car load of Organs and Pianos. But as the restaurant business is keeping
up as usual and especially for the sake of our many regular boarders we find our
selves compelled to continue the restaurant business and for that reason have no
place to display the instruments, They must therefore be disposed of at once at a
sacrifice of the profit we could have had by keeping them during the winter and
selling them at regular prices. Now it means to you a saving of $25 to $150 in
buying one of these instruments.
It is no Cheap Stuff but all from the Old Reliable
CABLE and KIMBALL COMPANIES
and descriptions to look alter and
he can't remember them all. It
will be seen how necessary it is
for the prompt transaction of busi
ness with the office of the county
treasurer to have the name, the
postoffice, the section, township
and range. Don't forget this..
