The American Economfst holds that
the Republicans could have won the
election if the fight had been made
on the tariff Issue. Maybe so. That
ts the issue on which the Democrats
won in the last two previous elections
in which they were successful.
President Wilson inherited the Mex
ican problem from Taft. Nearly fbur
years have elapsed and the problem
is no nearer solution than it was on
the day of the president's inaugura
tion. The situation has not changed
materially in any particular. There is
no government down there and Villa
still is in the saddle.
The talk of an embargo on Ameri
can food products, hardly seems time
ly, in view of the fact that millions
across the Atlantic are said to be suf-
leritig iruni jctiti ui iuuu. a mi mti -more
it seems unnecessary when one
takes into account those 72,000,000
eggs stored in Chicago.
"There appears to be no dissatis
faction in the United States over the
government's interference in San Do
mingo. The South American republics
are yet to be heard from.
That which appears to be sauce for
the Dominican goose is by no means
sauce for thu Mexican gander. Uncle
"Sam has taken over the administration
of government in the island rather
than permit anarchy to prevail. But
of course 3,000,000 people are much
more easily managed than 15,000,000.
Besides the inhabitants of Hayti are
mostly negroes and the Democrats
know how to handle that class of per
sons, as the result of long experience.
...It is proposed to add a 2H cent
piece to the coinage. This probably
would be followed by a new chain of
eLores and a whole outfit of slot ma
chines. According to a story in the Decem
ber issue of The American Boy, a
youth named Oliver Stedman was the
first Christmas tree merchant in New
York City. More than one hundred
years ago it was when Oliver and his
friend Mark Carr went out into the !
woods up the Hudson river, and cut a
.large wagonload of fir trees. and car
ried them down to the corner of Broad
way and Vesey streets, where they
made their stand. Before that, if a New
York resident wanted a Christmas
tree, he crossed the river and cut a
fir tree for himself and carried it
home.
Probably, among those who will be
Clad if the eight-hour day really be
comes universal, are the hired men
on the farms.
Boston People are contributing
money to buy rifles for use in the next
Irish rebellion. Boston ought to be
a good place to work up sympathy for
that Spanish heiress.
We don't see how the government
could well do less than award a rea
sonable amount of naval construction
to California yards.
. Business has been so good this year
that it is hard to tell when the Christ
mas shopping began.
THE AUSTRALIAN W AY.
Commissioner P. E. Chinn, of New
South Wales. Autralia. now in this
country, has been giving the American
people some pointers on the regulation
of the cost of living.
The labor government of Australia
has taken drastic steps, he says, to
control food prices that, naturally
enough, show the same tendency to
climb skyward as they do in this coun
try. The dealers are complaining bit
terly because the vision of big profits
has been dissipated.
A food commission is regulating
prices, much as the Interstate Com
merce Commission in this country reg
ulates railroad rates.
Butter in Sydney costs 36 cents a
pound, and cannot jump to 40 tomor
row and 4 5 next week at the will of
the merchants or the dairymen. If it
goes up, it will be only with the au
thorization of the commission, follow-
ing a hearing at which both dealer
and consumer will be represented.
Cheese sells at 12. 14 or 18 cents a
pound, according: to kind and quality.
The commission recently ordered a re
duction in price of 5 cents.
Eggs the newly laid variety may
be had in he big cities, for from 25 to
30 cents a dozen.
New South Wales has a state bak
ery that sells a two-pound loaf for 7
cents. Sydney owns municipal trawl
ers and cold-storage warehouses,, by
means of whicht has broken the "fish
ring" and reduced the price of fish to
the consumer.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Readers of the annual message
which President Wilson read to con
gress Tuesday, will look in vain for
any reference to the relation of the
United States to foreign governments.
A search for any word in regard to the
Mexican problem will be equally
futile.
The president's utterance is confined
almost wholly to a plea for the solu
tion of the present and other possible
controversies between railroads and
their employes.
The message contains a carefully
worded invitation to congress to be
stow upon the executive, in case of a
general strike, the power to take over
the operation of the railroads on the
plea of public necessity.
As a further measure of safety
against the possible paralysis of the
country's business by a railroad strike
it is urged that legislation be enacted
looking to investigation and arbitra
tion. Possibly the president will be heard
from later on matters of public con
cern which are omitted from the mes
sage under consideration. On the
other hand he may plan to await the
incoming of the new congress before
taking up the Mexican situation.
MORE ZEAL THAN SENSE.
The attempt of the members of the
Women's Congressional Union to
heckle the president, while he was de
livering his annual message to con
gress shows more zeal than sense.
The adoption of their cherished Susan
B. Anthony amendment by congress
would place them no nearer their goal
than they are now. A vote for suf
frage by three-fourths of the states in
the Union still would be necessary be
fore that amendment could become ef
fective. The states which already have suf
frage could be counted upon, but how
about the others? The southern states
would almost certainly reject it. In
many of the other states favorable ac
tion has been sought, in some more
than once, but without success. Is it
likely that the voters of these states
would be any more amenable to ar
gument when voting on a national
amendment than when voting on a
state amendment?
When the suffragists can count 36
states in their list, it will be time to
ask that the other 12 be forced into
line. Their chances of winning would
then be almost assured.
THE RICH MAN'S WAY.
The December Woman's Home
Companion has an article in which
this passage occurs:
"The nuisance for the man who has
acquired great financial resources
usually is that he doesn't know what
he wants. Possessing the resources
and feeling the moral necessity to have
recourse to them, he looks about for
something to want, and he selects the
most costly thing. The acquisition of
this most costly thing always involves,
in practice, the separation of the rich
man from society. Thus, he will ac
quire a large estate, or several large
estates, and cut himself off from the
world by gates, doors, miles of drive,
lodge keepers, menials, and secreta
ries. Or he will acquire a two-thousand-ton
yacht and cross the Atlantic
privately, tho less quickly, less com
fortably, and even less privately than
on a great liner. Or he will keep a
private orchestra, instead of being
seen at concerts. All which, though
magnificent, is anti-social and silly.
and is secretly felt to be so by the
rich .man when he happens to wake up
in tne middle of the night and cant
go to sleep again."
TURN OF THE TIDE.
A tendency toward a reaction in
the riotous condition of prices is
noted by Henry Clews in his weekly
review of the business situation. Much
of the change is attributed to the re
volt against the high cost of living.
Following is one of the striking state
ments in the review:
"Natural law is still superior to all
human interference, which usually re
sults in a new set of ills, worse than
those attempted to displace."
He says further:
For several weeks past reactionary
symptoms have been developing in
the stuck market. Under the stimu
lus of war inflation the situation had
become very one-sided, and the danger
of too violent . reversal was becoming
more and more apparent, unless the
brakes could be applied with discre
tion. The first check came from a
perfectly natural cause the desire to
take profits. A great deal of liquida
tion has already occurred during the
month Just closed, insiders in a posi
tion to know being fully aware that
it was advisable to lessen their hold
ings before the movement had reached
a climax. To this extent the technical
situation has been improved, espe
cially by this week's decline.
But other influences have also been
at work temporarily favoring a re
action. The first of these was the genT
eral uprising against high prices, es
pecially in commodities. Dear food
was breeding serious public discontent
and paving the way for further Gov
ernment interference with business.
Again there were signs that our pros
perity wave while 'not ended is ap
proaching, if it has not reached, its
zenith, and that owing to the greatly
increased cost of doing business there
will be no such profits in 1917 as in
1916. Labor is securing a liberal pro
portion of these profits, and when the
increased costs of labor, raw materials
and distribution are taken into con
sideration, the margin of profits, it
will be discovered, has been materially
affected. Moreover, high prices are
already causing lessened consumption
and increased production. Thus does
natural law in the form of supply and
demand automatically correct abnor
mal conditions more surely than any
of the fads and nostrums advanced by
those who believe in Government reg
ulation. Another cause of reaction was the
increased tightness of money. The
expansion of credit has been enor
mous, and in spite of the marvelous
growth of banking resources, the de
mand for accumulation was growing
at a pace that rendered a slowing
down Inevitable. The Immense vol
ume of business at abnormal profits,
the great expansion of credit, the ab
sorption of foreign-held securities, the
huge amount of money invested In
various foreign loans and the demands
of new enterprises at tiome, all meant
heavy demands upon the local money
market. Lenders and investors are
consequently asking and securing bet
ter rates; in other words, capital, like
other things, is rising in value be
cause demand is overtaking supply
and owners are enabled to hold for
more advantageous terms.
Off the Coast.
(By Susan E. Clagett.)
Just why Lavinia Payton was deter
mined to carry out her plan in the
face of angry opposition she' could not
have told. Probably it was due to the
opposition. But this last idea, fad,
idiosyncrasy, whatever her friends
were minded to call it, passed anything
tnat naa gone before.
Yet it was a very simple thing she
proposed to do merely to shun the
beaten path that led toward White
Sulphur Springs and go anywhere that
would take her away from the life her
people had led for generations and
expected her to live. White Sulphur
or Saratoga during the summer, Rich
mond and Washington during the win
ter months, with frequent trips to New
York.
When asked where she was going
she shook her head with a smile.
"I have no definite plan," she t6t
plied. But far back ifi the recesses
of her brain was a very positive idea.
She was going somewhere by water
and alone. She longed for Portugal
or the fjords of Norway, but she sailed
on a steamer for the fjords of New
foundland, the Norway of America.
The walk to Signal or Cabot's Tow
er, is not one to take alone. It is
long. It is steep. The road follows
the shore until it begins to ascend and
is lonely. When steamers come there
is always a sprinkling of people, most
ly driving toward the tower, where
there is a magnificent view of the har
bor and ocean. This'and much more
was told in the booklet Lavinia had
learned by heart. But there was one
grave omission. Indeed, two. The
first was wind, the other, mist What
was fog in the city was a fine rain
higher up, and the wind was a gale.
She had felt wind before, but never
like this. It whipped her wet skirts
about her until she thought she would
never move again. She tried to loosen
them as she stumbled along the rocky
path, her breath coming and going in
gasps. Ahead was the tower, gray and
somber, built to defy the elements.
She saw a little group of people stand
ing in an angle of the granite mass,
one figure apart from the others and
nearer to her. Then everything was
blank. She was conscious only of
blind terror as the wind caught and
whirled her about. For a space, eter
nity fronted her, then the awfulness
of the wind subsided and she found
herself clinging desperately to the
gray sleeve of an ulster.
"What made you attempt that
alone?" the man said roughly-, giving
her a little shake as he let her go. But
Lavinia had no mind to be let go and
clung to the arm that was half with
drawn. "Don't dare to faint," the voice went
on sharply. "Didn't you know Signal
Hill was no place for a woman unless
she had a man with her?"
"I don't know. The book said walk,
so I walked."
"Why didn't you bring some one
with you?"
"I am alone."
"Surely you made friends coming
up on the steamer."
"No. That was lust what I didn't
wish to do. All my life I have wanted
to get away from everybody."
"Well, you missed it by the fraction
of a second. . Another such truest and
you would have got away from ev-
erjDoay. t caugnt you just in time."
He left her in the angle of the wall
and stepped forward, a tall, broad-
shouldered, athletic-looking man v.-ith
Keen oiue eyes ana a determined
mouth.
"Come." he said. extending his
hand. "You must see the view before
we go."
She hesitated.
"Come." This time the word was im
patient. "If we are to make Quidi
Vidi we must be off."
"But I am not going to Quidi Vidi."
"Yes, you are. The village is r-y
objective point."
"It is not mine."
"See here." For the first time she
saw his face and it was filled with an
ger. "Do you think I am going to give
up my trip because you are obstinate
ly determined to go back the way, you
came?"
"What has my determination to do
with it?"
"Can you cross that strip alone?"
He nodded toward the narrow path
where the wind had full sweep altho
she could not feel it where she sat. "J
should think one experience would be
sufficient. You and I are alone. The
others who were here left some time
ago. I am going on. You are coming
with me. Hurry. - The climb down
the rocks will soon be dangerous."
She arose with such evident reluc
tance that he threw back his head
and laughed.
It was a long and rough scramble
to the little fishing village, one of the
most picturesque- on the Newfound
rand coast. It was a glimpse of na
ture never to be forgotten and impos
sible of description.
For a time Lavinia 'stood silent.
"To think I might have missed it,"
she said at last. "Thank you for mak
ing me come."
"I take it you are not often made
to do anything," he said, with a smile.
"This is the first time within my
memory." She answered his smile.
"I imagine you are not often crossed,
yourself." ,
"I pretty generally have my way,"
he replied carelessly. "Do you see
that tiny, whitewashed cottage over
yonder? I boarded -there one sum
mer. I am glad to remember I was
there. The following winter was most
severe. There was much suffering, so
in a small way I helped my landlady
over a perilous time." He glanced at
her curiously. "Does it ever occur to
you to wonder how the other half
lives?"
She shook her head. "This is my
first escape from the beaten path."
"Don't you ever long to get away
from it," he asked casually.
They were loitering along the two
mile stretch of road between the vil
lage and St. John's. As he spoke she
paused and looked back at the lovely
view. "I wouldn't be here if I had
not felt I must escape from it."
When they parted neither knew the
other's name. Lavlna did not think it
necessary to mention hers, as they
would never meet again, and if there
was a purpose behind the keen.
amused eyes as the man touched her
hand in parting there was no out-'
ward sign that he did not acquiesce
in her decision.
The next morning she left for
Labrador.
She was a little late in reaching the
steamer, and, somewhat breathless
from haste, was following the stew
ard down the deck when the back of
a rough, gray coat, caught and held
her attention. There was something
familiar about IU so familiar that she
moved hastily forward, confronting
the owner with blazing eyes.
"You!"
"Why not?"
"You came because you knew I
was sailing on this steamer?"
"Partly. I intended taking the trip.
It made no difference if I came now
or later on. Do not misunderstand
me. It was not for your charming
society, but because I know it is not
desirable for a woman, especially a
young woman, to take this trip
alone."
"And how am I to know you will
not make yourself as unpleasant as
other people. You are as much a
stranger as they."
He regarded her steadily. "You will
take that back," he said at last.
"No." She turned from him with
out another word. '
They ran into fog that night, de
pressing, penetrating fog. There were
eleven davs of it, and the trip was
lengthened to a fortnight, but long
before the fourteen days were up La
vinia had offered friendliness. It was
one thing to be alone in sunshine,
quite another to be alone and weighed
down by a heavy gray blanket that
allowed no view other than that of
the steamer's deck.
He accepted her overtures with no
degree of eagerness, but under his
apparent indifference was a steadfast
determination that made itself evident

ended the silence that had fallen be
tween them by saying:
"You have not yet retracted the
words you said to me the morning we
left St. John's."
"It is not fair that you should hold
them against me. I was beginning to
regard you as a friend." - y
"You had recognized' the possibili
ties of friendship even before - you
spoke."
"You are mistaken. I had given it
no thought."
"You knew I was to be trusted.
She did not answer directly. "For
two weeks we have neither of us
known who the other was. I do not
even know your name, but I am going
to ask you to my home. Will you
come?"
His eyes softened to a wonderful
gentleness. "When ?"
"And you may ask for "
He interrupted. "You need not tell
me."
"You know me?"
"Your picture stood on your broth
er's desk at college. He is my very
good friend and the picture is a won
derful likeness."
He did not consider it necessary to
tell her he had begged the picture
from his friend. That would come
later. She was not ready for what he
had to say and he coatd wait. (Copy

BED TIME TALES
BY CLARA INGRAM JVDSOX.
TOMMY JAY KNOWS AUTUMN IS
COMING.
Such a scampering and a scrabbling
as there was in the trees after that!
Of course. Foxy Squirrel, being inter
ested in his own affairs, had supposed
that he was the only squirrel who had
received the autumn's message. But
he soon found out his mistake. All
his friends had heard the dropping
nuts and every little squirrel in the
whole woods was out for food.
But, dear me! Mother Nature had
prepared for them! There were nuts
and plenty for all nobody would have
to go hungry this fall, that was sure.
For every little breeze showered down
nuts and more nuts, and plenty of
nice ripe acorns for all. The squirrels
didn't even have to hunt far; they only
had to store up the goodies that were
right close to hand.
t'p he ran, clear to the tcJp.
After Foxy had carried three loads
of nuts up the tree to his private store
house, he decided that he would get
some few nuts right off the tree. So
he raced up the nearest oak, jumped
over to the next, and ran up to the
topmost branch. Xow Foxy knew
very well that he could get all the
nuts he could store that djiy, right
down on the ground, oh, yes, he knew
that. But he also knew that he would
like nothing better than a run up to
the top of that oak tree. And you
know yourself how easy it is to per
suade yourself that you ought to do
eomething that you wish to do. It
wasn't two minutes till Foxy had de
cided that he really should look for
nuts up that tree; and up he ran, ciear
to the top. '
And there he saw Tommy Jay.
"Hello there, TommyV' said Foxy,
this is a fine autumn day." ("That'll
surprise him, I guess," thought Foxy,
" cause he don t know that autumn
has begun!")
"Fine, indeed," replied Tommy, "and
It's time you were gettiag to work,
seems to me!"
Now that didn't please Foxy one bit.
He wanted to be the one to tell Tom
my what to do, it's lots more fun to
tell than to be told. So he spoke up
real tartly, "If you know that au
tumn's here why don't you fly south?
And how do you know it's autumn
anyway? You don't have to listen for
the fall of nuts!"
"No, I know I don't," replied Tom
my, good-naturedly, just as tho he
didn't hear the crossness of Foxy'a
voice, "but I know when autumn
comes just the same. Don't you see
that the leaves are dry and golden?
Don't you see that there are fewer in
sects each day for me to eat? I'll be
going south very soon very soon!"
And then Foxy was sorry for his
temper for he knew he would miss
Tommy, miss him very much. (Copy-

OUT FORSPEAKER
A. 31. Keene of Fort Scott Ex
pects to Preside In House.
He Claims to Have Enough
Votes to Elect Him.
Claims of pledges from fifty-six of
the eighty-six Republican members of
the house of representatives were
made today by A. M. Keene of Fort
Scott; candidate tor speaker of the
1917 session. Keene expects to win
the nomination on the first ballot in
the Republican caucus, he told Topeka
friends in. a visit to the state house.
Pledges claimed by the Fort Scott man
are twelve more than the number of
votes required to nominate.
It is probable that J. M. Gilman of
Leavenworth, will be a contender
against Keene in the speakership fight.
The Fort Scott man, however, ex
presses confidence that his election is
now assured. In addition to voluntary
pledges from fifty-six Republican
members. Keene stated that he ex
pected to win at least a half dozen ad
ditional votes on the first ballot. In
addition to the Keene and Gilman can
didacies. Frank Travis of lola, has
been mentioned as a probable candi
date, but has made no announcement.
Voluntary Pledges.
"Voluntary pledges have been re
ceived by me from fifty-six of tiie
eighty-six Republican members of the
House, saia J.eene. I am sure l snu.u
teen votes on the first ballot and may
win by an even larger majority than
now indicated."
Two years ago Keene was a candi
date for speaker, but was defeated by
Robert Stone of Topeka. During the
1915 session. Keene was chairman of
the ways and means committee of the
house. He directed the appropriation
fight for the administration and was
a member of all of the numerous ap
propriation conference committees.
This year Keene returns for his fourth
term in the house and is again a can
didate for the speakership.
SUIT IN BANKRUPTCY
Eli Ulamperl Must Answer for Alleged
Removal of Goods. '
A petition in bankruptcy against EH
Ulamperl, proprietor of the store at
419 and 421 Kansas avenue, has been
filed in the federal district court by
J. David & Sons. Choen & Casner,
Alper, Schultz & Hirschfield and Har
ris Weisberg, all of New York City.
The petition charges that Ulamperl
has removed from the store and ship
ped out of the city as baggage and ex
cess baggage goods he purchased of
the petitioners. It charges that he has
been disposiing of goods secretly and
at ruinously low prices to local per
sons. The petition was filed by the firm of
McClintock, Quant & Krauthoff of
Kansas City. Subpoenas have been
issued for a large number of witnesses
to appear before Judge J. G. Slon
ecker, referee in bankruptcy.
Harry Friedberg of Kansas City, at
torney for Mr. Ulamperl, states that
the whole matter is a scheme to ruin
the business of the Topeka merchant.
He states that Ulamperl's purchases
have been even lighter than usual this
year and that he has shipped less
goods out than in previous years.
WOMEN DEMAND FLAG
Suffs Take Back Banner 'Captured'
by Page In Congress.
Washington, Dec. 6. Miss Hazel
Hunkins, of Billings, Mont., and Mrs.
Bessie Fapandre, of San Francisco,
two of the congressional union suf
frage hecklers, who waved the banner
from the house gallery while the pres
ident was addressing congress, went
to the capitol today to demand the re
turn of the captured flag.
The flag was turned over to the serjeant-at-arms
of the house after Page
Jimmy Griffen had torn it down.
"The flag is ours and we want it,"
said the women as they r ached the
capitol. "We don't expect c refusal."
They refused to cay what tack they
would take if they got one.

Villa or recaptured after a fight was
not stated. All foreigners, with ' the
possible exception of Theodore Hoe

SOLVE COAL SHORTAGE HERE
Question of Delays in Cars Will
Be Probed.
Operators May Have 'to Share
in the Blame.
The public utilities commission to
day directed all railroads in Kansas
to file weekly reports showing the
number of cars requested and sup
plied Kansas shippers for handling of
various commodities. The order of
the state commission is fo the filing
of reports until February 1 and is is
sued in an effort to solve the coal
shortage troubles.
No positive orders were issued in
the car and coal shortage case. But
all railroads and coal operators were
asked to co-operate with the commis
sion in meeting the present situation.
A report issued 'by the commission
showed that many cars furnished by
the railroads were held by operators
who delayed their prompt moving.
These delays are claimed by the com
mission to have -been due to strikes
and sundry troubles of the mining
companies.
With the high prices and shortage
of coal, the commission reports that
many operators have withdrawn their
travelling men from the fi"ld and for
some weeks have not solicited sales or
contracts.

The Bock Island Golden State Lim
ited reached Topeka today with every
place on the train taken, except the
day coach seats, and most of them
were filled. The limited goes to Cali
fornia and Arizona points, and carried
an extra car today. 'The Santa Fe's
best thru California train ran in two
sections, and passenger agents are be-
glning to lose the lank and hungry
look that distinguished them during
November, the dullest month of the
year in passenger traffic.
Two hyphenated landseekers from
the first homeseekera special train
which has passed thru Topeka over
the Rock Island ror many months,
managed to get on the wrong side of
the Golden State limited, which was
in the Topeka yards at the same time
the special was there, and missed
their train, today. Their train pulled
out before they could reach it, and
they went on to Herington on the
Golden State, to intercept it.

SEE' CHARTER BOARD
Kansas Oil and Bank Promoters W ant
nights of Business.
Kansas oil companies and bank pro
moters axe spending another un
pleasant and decidedly nervous day
before the state charter bard. This
afternoon several oil companies which
had been ousted Irom tne state oy
blue sky department, sought reinstate
ment and brought their attorneys to
Topeka to help in the fight. In addi
tion to the troubles of the oil compa
nies, several bank charters are this
afternoon hanging in the balance.
In November the charter board re
voked permits of several oil compa
nies and directed them to adjust their
affairs. Method of operations of sev
eral companies were decidedly unpop
ular with the board and as '. result of
conditions found by blue sky depart
ment investigators, drastic orders were
issued by the state department. Sev
eral of the companies .re now seeking
new permits, while additional compa
nies were . today haled before the
board for cross examinations as to
their affairs.
Several new bank charter applica
tions also came bef ore tne board. The
bank fights brought a score of men to
Topeka. The contests will occupy the
attention of the charter boa-d during
the entire afternoon session.
GOES UPJOR LIFE
Mexican Who Killed Topeka
Woman Found Guilty.
Admitted Just Before Jury
Went Out He Did It.
Camuto Gabriel, the Mexican who
shot thru the -doo; of a house in "Little
Mexico" two weeks -go and killed
Teofila Hernandez, a young married
woman .was found guilty of first de
gree murder in the first division of
the district court today.
The sentence for the offense of
which he is convicted is life impris
onment.
The case began in court Tuesday
afternoon and while Gabriel denied
on the stand that he fired the shot
that killed the woman, or that he had
ever had anything to do with her, he
admitted to his attorney just before
the jury went out that he was guilty
and wanted to plead Tuilty to man
slaughter.
Jay Jensen, his attorney, took the
matter up with W. K. Atchison, coun
ty attorney, immediately, but Mr. At
chison declined to agree to such I
pleading. He was confident the jury
would find Gabriel guilty of first de
gree murder.
The whole case was conducted thru
interpreters. Gabriel is rnly 30 years
of age and is far above the average
Mexican in appearance.
There was testimony to the ef
feet that Gabriel anoyed Krs. Hern
andez with his attentions when her
husband was not at home. . On the day
the murder was committeed he went
to the house and attempted to gain
admission. Mrs. Hernandez asked who
it was at the door and when he gave
his name she refused to open the door.
He fired thru the door then walked
around the house and fired other shots
thru the walls. One ef them struck the
woman and she was found dead when
the officers opened the house.
FOXHALL KEENE HURT
Widely Known Sportsman Thrown
When Mount Hurdles Fence.
Baltimore. Md., Dec. 6. The condi
tion of Foxhall P. Keene, the widely
known sportsman of New York, who
was seriously injured yesterday while
riding in a hunt meeting at the Har
ford Hunt club, near Farmington. Md.,
was reDorted unchanged this morning.
He lay all night in a semi-conscious
state:
Mr. Keene's physician said the pa
tient was injured about the head, but
that no bones were broken. The club
man's horse fell taking a fence. It is
thought that when his mount went
down Keene was thrown heavily
landing on his head. He was found
unconscious in a clump of bushes and
taken to the club house.
In April, 1902, Keene was injured
severely while riding with Melton
Mowbray pack. In January, 1892, he
fell while riding to hounds in Ire
land and the cables at first reported
him killed. He has been in several
other minor accidents.
Keene Recovers Consciousness.
Baltimore, Md., Dec. 8. After
night of restlessness, Foxhall Keene,
sportsman, thrown from his horse near
the Harford Hunting club yesterday,
fully regained consciousness today.
HARVEY MAY GET IT
Second Assistant May Take K. M.
Brady's Place in Court.
X. S. Harvey, it Is reported, will
succeed the late Francis M. Brady as
assistant United States district attor
ney. Mr. Harvey now holds the of
fice of second assistant at a salary of
$1,800 a year. The office of first as
sistant pays $2,400 a year.
It is said there are almost a dozen
applicants for Mr. Brady'.s place but
that the list diminishes rapidly as it
becomes known that the appointee
will get the place now held by Mr.
Harvey and not Brady's place.
Gossip from Wichita Is to the effect
that the appointment was offered to
Sam Buckland and that he declined
it; that it was then offered to Dudley
D. Gardner and he declined it; also
that W. O. Jochems or W. E. PepL
perill, either, may have the appoint
ment for the asking, but that they do
not want it. wicntta appears to have
a. lot of prosperous attorneys who
couldn't afford to look at an $1,800
job.
It is not known that any Topeka at
torney has made application for the
place. The appointment will be made
by Fred Robertson, United States dis
trict attorney, and he has not been in
Topeka since the death of Francis M.
Brady. The appointment of Harvey
to the place is said to be Assured.

ON MANAGER PLAN
Garland Explains New City
Government Scheme.
He Tells Chamber of Commerce
of Success in Dayton, O.
RUN CITY LIKE A BANK
Manager Is Retained as Long as
He Makes Good.
Porter Insists That Dayton Has
Nothing on Topeka.
D. Frank Garland, former minister.
and nead of the welfare department
of the city of Dayton, Ohio, explained
to more than 200 business men at the
Chamber of Commerce this noon the
city manager plan of city government
in operation at Dayton. Fully 100
more business men attended the meet
ing than were expected.
1 ne speaker described the city man
ager plan as similar to the plan gov
erning the operation of banks. He
stated that the citizens held the same
position in a municipality as the stock
holders do in a bank. These stock
holders elect directors, who. in turn,
elect a cashier who is directly respon
sible to them for the success of the
bank.
Under the city manager plan, ths
so-called stockholders comprise a com
mission serving without salary, all men
of ability in the various departments
which they represent in the city gov
ernment. In Dayton, he declared, the
various departments on the city com
mission are men of ability recognized
thruout the city and all are men scry
ing without pay, men who could not
afford to accept such a position for
the salary it would pay.
Commissioners Have Vote.
The services of the five commission
ers expire on alternating years and
thus shorten the ballot. These com
missioners outline and vote on the
general policy of city government.
They appoint a city manager, a man
from anywhere who has proper quali
fications for the position and pay him
a large salary, one equal almost to the
combined salaries of the city commis
sioners. The city manager makes his own
appointments of all department heads.
These department heads make their
appointments, which are checked up
to the city manager for approval. But
the commission has nothing to do
with the personnel of the appointees.
They either hire or fire the city man
ager upon the results of his work.
Full publicity, civil service, initia
tive, referendum and recall, city
budget system and city planning are
all features of the citv manager plan
asoutlined by the Dayton man.
"A manager knows he will remain
in office as lonsr as he makes good
and not for Just two or three terms "
said Garland. "Therefor., be rl.. tnr.
Improvements of lasting oralities. For
instance, after our manager was se
iected he planned a change in the
water system that will tnko nf -
city of 230,000."
Nothing on Topeka.
"That government has nothing nn
ours," said Commissioner Porter fol
lowing the address, "excepting possi
bly in the appointments of department
heads, which the commission does not
confirm as is done in this city.
"City commissioners and mayors
can remain in office as long as they
behave themselves and satisfy the
people right here in Topeka There ;s
no limit on our terms of office."
v ommissioners Porter and Wasson
and employes in their departments, to-
gether with Fire Chief Joseph Hanlon
were the only city officials seen at
the meeting. All were invited.
Garland spoke of visions of the fu
ture, injected Biblical phrases in his
address, and spoke of a new Jerusalm
which could be huilded in this worM.
which contained all the materials
used in the building of the mythical
Bible city.
Provide for Children.
The speaker also pleaded for a city
of the future which provides for the
children. He stated that. 33 per rent
of the population of Topeka is chil
dren. He spoke of the unequal distri
bution of wealth, declaring that 2 per
cent of the population of the I'nited
States own 60 per cent of the 200 bil
lion dollars, the total wealth of ths
country. The rapid increase in the
size of cities, the need for city plan
ning, the wastefulness of municinal
government in cities and all other ills
of American cities were described by
the man from Dayton.
