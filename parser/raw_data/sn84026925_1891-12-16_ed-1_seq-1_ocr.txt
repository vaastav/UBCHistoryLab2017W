SYNOPSIS.
Chapter 1.?John Dorison, son of the
head of the house of Dorison it Co., deceased,
returns after eight years of wandering
under a cloud, to the old home in
New York city. The basement is used as
a saloon, and stepping in Dorison makes
a chanoe acquaintance with Job Nettleman,
who knew the Dorisons in their
best days
Chapter 2.?Nettleman leaves the
saloon and in a few moments blood is
seen trickling from the ceiling. The saloon
keeper and his customers rush to the
s front stairway to reach the floor above.
Dorison goes up the rear stairs and And a
a young woman weltering in blood. He
/iio/wviiM a mininfnm nortait of his
B. ripg on the stand,
both or which ho secures. A scrap
of paper in the dead woman's hand ana
another on the floor are also taken and secreted.
The entry of detectives and police
Elace him nnder suspicion. The room
i used as a costumer's establishment by
Mme. Delamour.
Chapter 3.?Dorison, using the alias
> James Dudley, calls on Nettleman to help
him conceal his identity. At Nettleman's
office he meets Simon Cathcart, a private
detective, who engages him to assist in
working up the murder case. Dorison's
father died while writing the letter, which
apparently aocused the son of grave
crimes. The scraps found in the costumer's
room are inTlthe t handwriting
of Dorison, senior, and appear to relate
to the subject broached in tne unfinished
letter.
Chapter 4.?Madame Delamour, the
oostumer, is Mrs. Farish. Cathcart goes
to her private house and finds that she has
been murdered in the same manner as
the young womanlin the'costumer's shop.
? The latter was Mrs. Farish's daughter
Annie. A mysterious young man called
on the Farish's at intervals, and on his
last visit went away angry. Cathcart finds
a man's glove near Mrs. Farish's body.
Chapter 5.?Mystery in the Farish
house. Mrs. Farish assumed mourning,
Annie withdrew from isociety and a son
disappeared, all about the date of Dorison's
death. The glove found near Mrs. Fari
ish's body has an extraordinarily long
thumb.
Chapter 6.?Cathcart starts Dorison out
as a young man of fashion to discover the
wearer of the glove withta^long thumb.
Chapters 7 and 8.?Dorison saves a
young lady from being run down by a
carriage on Broadway. She is the daughter
or an old friend of his father, Mr.
Eustace.
Chapter 9.?Dorison protects a woman
from insult and arrest, and discovers a
man with a long thumb.
Chapter 10.?The man with the long
thumb is Charlie Eustace, brother of the
rescued girl.
Chapter 11.?Dorison dines with young
Eustace in a restaurant, while Cathcart
' looks on and concludes that Eustace is the
man with the long thumb. A man believed
to be the myterious caller at the
Parish's is "'shadowed" as suspect no. z.
Chapter 12.?The new suspect is Harry
Langdon, a dissipated young man who
has been in company with Annie Farish.
Chapter 13.?Harry Langdon was an
occasional caller at Farish's. C'atheart secures
a lancet found on the floor of Mrs.
Farish's room after the murder. ? Langdon
associates with crooks.
Chapter 14.?Dorison learns that Charley
Eustace, though educated in surgery,
never owned an instrument, hence
the lancet was not his. Harry Langdon
has forced himself on the Eustace's
through the physician of the family, Dr.
Fassett, and is secretly intriguing with
young Dorothy Eustace.
Chapter 15.?A close intimacy existed
in bygone years between the elder Eustace
and Dorison's father. Cathcart puts
Dorison on track.
Chapter M.?Dorison joins a theatre
party with young Eustace and his' sister *
Evelyn. Langdon appears. A womad
warns Dorison that Langdon* seeks to
harm him.
Chapter 17.?Cathcart learns from the
elder Eustace that Dorison, senior, married
a second time secretly, the:iissues beingla
son and a daughter; that he left with
Eustace $150,000 in trust.
Chapter 18.?Cathcart convinces Eustace
that Mrs. Farish was Dorison's secend
wife. The unfinished letters of the
dead merchant are believed to relate to
the son by this marriage.
CHAPTER XIX.
A mystery revealed.
A tingle glance ^informed him that the
old man tvat in a happy humor.
In compliance with the old detective's
request, Dorison appeared in the evening.
A single glance informed him that the
old man was in a happy humor.
"I received a note from you in the
early afternoon," said Dorison, "but all
of it I could understand was that you
desired to see me this evening. And
here I am."
"You are not quick of comprehension.
I meant your case is as plain as a pikestaff.
You had, or have, a brother?the
latter I think."
Dorison stared in astonishment at the
detective, his anger rising at the same
time. However much he had in his own
heart condemned his father for the
charge which for eignt years had embittered
his life, he was not willing
* others should cast reflections upon him.
But Catbcart was not a man to regard
the emotions of others, and though,
doubtless, he quickly, enough perceived
the anger of the young man, without
preface, apology or effort to soften the
news he had given him. he went directly
at the statement
Very soon Dorison's anger was lost in
the astonishment the story gave rise to,
and when he learned that all this had
been obtained from Mr. Eustace, he

"Now," continued Cathcart, "as I say,
it is as plain as a pikestaff. 1 have reasoned
the whole thing out to a certain
conclusion, my reasoning being based
upon information obtained from Mr.
Eustace, papers of your father I have
had access to, confirming them by public
records and the examination of books of
private institutions, and that unfinished
letter. I shall not waste time by going
over the processes, but will give you my
conclusions in the shape of a statement:
"When your father was twenty-one or
twenty-three he met Emma Ludlow, a
very pretty girl, daughter of a costumer
of Chatham street. Ludlow was an Englishman
who had in his own country I
been connected with a family of prominence.
There drifted to this country I
one of the younger members of that |
family, named Parish, who also saw the j
girl Emma, and desired to marry her. i
The father felt honored that one of the
family he had been a servant in desired I
to marry his daughter, and, having the |
notions of parental authority Englishmen
entertain and overlooking the faults J
of the man Farish, which were 60 great j
he was compelled to leave England, op- |
posed your father and forced the marriage
with Farish. Subsequently your
father yielded to the wishes of his family
and married Mary Clavering, your j
mother. That marriage was an exceed- j
ingly happy one, notwithstanding the !
previous romance.
"Your father and mother had been
married twelve years when you were
born, the youngest of a family of five,
the elder of whom had all died. When

mpany and published by special arrange- !
i them.]
you were four your mother died. A
year later your father met Mrs. Farish,
then, as he understood and as she believed,
a childless widow. His love returned
for her and he Becretly married
her. Why, does notyetappear, but hiaexcuse
was that he was retiring from business
and did not want to announce his
second marriage until that project was
fully accomplished. After two years of
this'sort of life, during which two children,
a boy and girl, were born, Anne 1
and Harold Farish. the husband turned
up on the scene, to separate your father
and the woman. Mrs. Farish was a
good wournu. and although Farish, who
seems to have been a scamp, was paid
well to keep away and make no scandal,
his wife insisted upon an absolute severance
of relations between your father
and herself. In view, however, of all
that had happened your father provided
well for her and his children. In eighteen
hundred and fifty-four he gave her
the house she lived and was murdered
in and fifty thousand dollars, which he
invested for her, I suppose.
"The low spirits your father showed
at that time were not due to his having
retired from business, but to this uifor
tunate complication. The children grew,
and the boy early went wrong. Between
the years he was sixteen and nineteen he
committed defalcations and forgeries, the
latter principally of your father's name,
which indicates that he knew of his relation
to your father, and which were
paid by his father and yonrs, and as
well much more money to save him
from punishment?foolishly, to be sure,
but compelled to it to save the good
name of the woman, the mother, ;.f for
no other reason. This used up the property.
Wheu he died he was appealing
to Mr. Eustace for assistance. When he
died the scamp Harold disappeared.
Three years ago he reappeared again and
rained his mother by his insatiable demands
and"
"And," interrupted Dorison excitedly,
"he is Harry Langdon, and murdered
his mother and sister."
"Such would seem to be the logical
conclusions," said the detective calmly.
A thousand questions crowded tumultuously
upon the brain of Dorison.
He did not know which to ask first?he
wanted to ask them all at once. Finally,
he said:
"But do you know all this tg be true?"
"No, not in its entirety," replied Cathcart
"Some of it I do know to be true,
the rest I sincerely believe. It is now,
however, a mere work of time to verify
everything. The mystery is solved. The
ungrateful son is Harold Farish, alias
Harry Langdon."
"But what was the cause of the mur
aer?tnatwasu nornDie taing to uo,
asked Dorison.
"There 1 have proof, 1 think, of the accuracy
of my theory in the beginning.
I said the object of the murders was not
robbery, but the possession of documents
of value to somebody. I assume
they were proofs of crimes committed,
forgeries and the like, which so long as
they were held by the mother ai.d sister
were a protection to a certain extent
to them, und a menace to him. And
perhaps?and we will not quite know
until we force the rascal to confessionsome
one pursuing him was on track of
them and he was determined to secure
and destroy them, and perhaps, which 1
think even more probable, one other
reason, to obtain an order fof a large
sum, possession of which would secure
possession of the sum, which he thought
they held. Of this, however, 1 will not
speak at present for reasons of my own."
"Do you then think the murders were
deliberately planned?"
"No. The first, that of the daughter,
was unpremediated, but was dore in a
moment of exasperation. The second?
of the mother?was a consequence of the
first as a matter of self preservation."
Horrified and much excited, Dorison
was silent. His head was in a whirl,
and every moment fresh thoughts, each
one coming to him as a shock, occurred.
The murderer was his half brother; the
beast, Harry Langdon, was bis half
byother. The same blood coursed in
their veina The passions and emotions
which possessed him he could not stop
to analyze, they succeeded each other so
rapidly?indeed, became so entangled
and exhausted him so with their violence
that he became confused and sick, incapable
of thinking clearly; but over all,
as a lambent light, was the thought that
his own name was clear and he could
walk erect amoug other men in his own
own person.
Cathcart was the first to break the silence.
"Your friend, young Eustace, is out of
it," he said.
Dorison roused up with something like
a start
"We have had him under examination."
continued Cathcart. "and he told |
a clear tale. Say nothing to aim about
it, and if he speaks of it to you do not
admit any knowledge of it. I do not
want him to know that you ever suspected
or watched him."
"He will never know from me. I am
far more anxious than you. 1 cannot
look upon' that part of the search with
anything but self contempt."
"But 1 never believed he w.is in it,"
said Cat heart.
"Why, then," asked Dorison hotly,
"did you force me to an intimacy with
that idea in view?"
"Because the glove business must be
explained, but principally because early
in my search into your part of 'the affair
I had come upon the intimate relation of
the elder Eustace to the elder Dorison, '
through Cousiu Nettlemun, and I fore- i
saw then an intimacy with the family I
would be^a necessary thing, and that 1 j
might have to use you to elicit the in- |
formation I wanted. At the time 1 I
could not give you the details, but I had !
to give you a reason for seeking the in- '
timacy, since you are ono of those un- j
comfortable persons to work with who
must have a reason for everything. But I
your blundering and the coolness which j
you permitted to grow up between the
elder Eustace and yourself necessitated j
my doing the work 1 intended for you.
As it is, I am glad it turned out as it
did You could never have gotten the ;
story."
Agitated and excited its he was, Dorison
appreciated the truth of the old !
man's words.
"You do not know the reason of the
old man's coolness to you?"
"No."
"I do."
"What?" asked Dorison eagerly.
"He suspected you to be the son of
Dorison by Mrs. Farish."
"Oh!" The possibility of such a thing
had not occurred to Dorison.
"But that is no reason why he should
treat me coldly since, as you have told
me, he was not then, at least, aware of j
the bad character of that son."
"There was a stain on the birth of that
son of the elder Dorison."
"Even then it should have appeared
more as a misfortune than a crime of the
parents."
"True, so far as hs might have looked
upon such a son in the abstract, but as
a person whom be had received as an
equal into his house, was entertaining as
a guest at his own board, an.l bringing j
him into association with his daughters,
there was a great difference to a man of
his views of life and of his station. He
would naturally draw a line on a man !
of such birth at his own door, commiB- '
eratmg the man for the necessity at the
same time."
"True. Yon are right." replied Dorison
thoughtfully.
"1 think you ought to appear before
the elder EuBtace now in your own person."
Dorison was startled at the idea, and
shrank from it
"Are you so certain of your case
then?" he asked.
"1 am absolutely certain. It is now a
mere matter of time to prove it in all its
details."
CHAPTER XX.
A.N UNEXPECTED TURN.
Calmly turning the key he threw open the
inner door.
When Dorison left the house in which j
were Cathcart's rooms he was still in a
whirl and confusion of thought The >
dream he had entertained for eight years !
seemed on the point of realization. If :
the old detective were to be believed it |
was even then practically realized. And j
the revelation had come, bo far ns he was ;
toncerned. at a moment when he was '
rank into the deepest pit of despair? j
when the case looked darker and more
hopeless than ever.
The honse occupied by the old detect- j
ive was farther from Broadway than j
from the Bowery. So it came that he
had some distance to walk before he j
reached the former street
He was aroused by the noise of a
stumble behind him, and turning quick- ;
ly received simultaneously a severe blow
upon his left forearm, a blow evidently I
intended for his head, and so powerful as
to send him to the pavement At the 1
same time he heard a cry.
'Ah, yon rascals!"
This cry frightened his assailants, who j
dashed across the street and were lost in j
the darkness. i
By the time the one who cried out had !
come running up, Dorison, faint with
pain, bad struggled to his feet
'The woman was right I should have
heeded her warning," he mutteyed con- 1
fusedly to the man who had come to his
assistance, and who was none other than '
the officer Cathcart had instructed to fol- 1
low Doris&n as a protection. 1
"You must return at once to the
chief," said the officer "Are you much 1
hurt?"
'My arm pains me a goou aeav replied
Dorison, "but it is better than if it
were my head."
The officer hurried him to Cathcart's
apartments.
The old detective comprehended the
situation before he could be informed
by the officer.
"Where were you hit?" he asked.
'On the left arm," replied Dorison.
Quickly and gently the old man bared
the injured member.
"I am not a surgeon," he said, as he
manipulated the arm, "but I can generally
tell whether bones are broken or
not" ?
He looked serious as he plied it To
the officer he said, "Get a coach as
quickly as you can."
Leading Dorison to a lounge he laid
him upon it. saying: "Rest there a moment.
1 cannot tell whether your arm
is broken of not. We will go Immediately
to a Burgeon. By heavens!" he cried
to himself, "that is an idea, and he is
not far off."
He sprang to his bureau and opening !
the lower drawer took out a light gray
wiar and beard. With a rapidity that <
astonished Dorison, watching him in
great pain as he was, the old detective
put them on, and with the ose of cosmetic,
rogoe and "powder presented in a
moment an entirely different face and
head. Darting into an adjoining room
he issned a moment or two later in a
black broadcloth suit To put a gold
chain around bis neck and to assume a ;
gold eyeglass Becured by a small gold 1
chain, was the work of a moment more, i
and when completed he was a prosper- I
ous merchant or banker, ready to receive
the announcement of the officer who ?
entered that the carriage was ready.
The interest of this strange proceed- i
ing was so great to Dorison that he had
not asked a question, contenting himself
with watching. 1
'Come." said Cathcart, "1 will take <
you to a physician?a Burgeon."
As Dorison. with the help of the others,
arose. Cathcart said to the officer,
"You are to go with us." I
After Dorison had been placed in the
carriage Cathcart told the driver to go 1
to number - Tenth street. Dr. Fassett.
Even this conveyed nothing to Dorison,
somewhat dazed with the pain he i
was enduring.
Dr. Fassett was in, and they were at
once taken into his consulting room.
The surgeon bared the arm and examined
it
"1 should say this injury was inflicted <
with a sand club. What are the cir- 1
cumstancesr
. Before Dorison could reply, Cathcart 1
interfered.
"Robbery, 1 should say. This young
man, who is my nephew, was passing
along Bond street. My friend and my- (
self were some distance behind him,
when three men rushed from a place of
concealment upon him. He heard them, i
for he turned, and a blow aimed for his
head fell upon bis arm. My friend cried i
out, 'Ah, you rascals!' and they fled i
without inflicting further injury. Call- 1
ing a carriage, I drove right here, for 1 '
had heard my friend Eustace speak of 1
your skill." 1
The surgeon had been manipulating
the arm while Cathcart was talking.
"No bones are broken, 1 am sure, he
said. Take him home immediately and i
apply cloths dipped in hot water, as hot 1
as he can stand it, and keep this up con- 1
stantly for four or five hours. Then to- I
morrow morning bring him here to me
before ten o'clock."
The physician was curt, prompt and 1
imperative. Cathcart was disposed to 1
engage him in conversation. But Dr.
Fassett ended further talk by saying:
"1 have told you what to do. You <
must not detain me. I have an impor- 1
tant case, and must go out now."
"Can we not set you down where you
want to go?" asked the old detective. ' !
"What you want to do," said the doc- j
tor, "is to get your nephew under treat- I i
ment of hot water as soon as you can." | 1
There was nothing left on this but to > i
go, and they did, with very bad grace <
upon the part of the old detective.
"That was a misplay," he said, as he i
entered the carriage. "1 hoped to be 1
able to talk with him so as to bring in
Langdon. 1 want to know what the > '
doctor knows about him. Not much, I 1
perhaps, but everything counts in this 1
business. However, 1 will have a chance ! '
at him tomorrow morning." j i
"That was the physician that knocked
Miss Eustace down on Broadway with | 1
his houses," 6aid Dorison faintly. "He
did not recognize me." | '
Arriving at Dorison's apartments, to j <
which they were rapidly driven, Cath- :
cart and the officer devoted themselves j
to the treatment recommended by the < 1
surgeon, after which, and putting Dori- I '
son into his bed, Cathcart dismissed the j
officer, with instructions to go to his <
rooms in Bond street early in the morn- I
log and bring what mail be might find
there to him before nine. Then he laid
himself down on the lounge to sleep.
The treatment he had been subjected
to eased the puin that Dorison had been
suffering from, yet he lay a long time
unable to sleep. The events of the day
and evening had been many and startling.
They were destined to have a very
considerable influence upon his life.
Just what, he could not tell, but one
thing was certain, it would now be turned
into another channel than that he had
followed for the past eight years. Though
he tossed on hiB bed because of the excitement
of the day, Cathcart slumbered
so peacefully and easily that Dorison
became unreasonably provoked with
him..
However, as the morning light
streamed into the windows, he fell into a
sleep, from which he was aroused shortly
after eight by Cathcart and bidden to
dress and partake of the breakfast he
had sent for. He was barely prepared
for it when the officer entered with Mr.
Cathcart's mail.
Among the letters was a telegram
which Cathcart opened. Heading It, he
handed it to Dorison, with an expression
of satisfaction and the remark:
WAtwjnntnivfA AAma ** I
"UJUUruiauuuo mo ijcgiumu^ w wwm
DoriBon read it. It ran:
"Langdon was known as Harry Farish
here Beven years ago?then a mere boy;
afterward he got into prison. Turned
np in Chicago five years ago as Harry
Langdon. See letter mailed to-night."
"That settles that part of the theory."
remarked Cathcart.
Having partaken of the breakfast,
Cathcart proposed to set out to call upon
Dr. Fassett.
To this Dorison demurred. His arm,
though stiff and sore needed no more
treatment than had been given it
Bat Cathcart said:
"No; 1 took advantage of your accident
to get to Dr. Fassett naturally, and
we must go to fulfill the purpose I was
balked in last night How much Fassett
may know about Langdon is uncertain,
but 1 propose to obtain all he does
know. Your injury gives us the natural
excuse."
Therefore they set out On arriving
at the house of the physician and entering,
the receptiou room was found to be
not only full, but actually crowded.
Dr. Fassett happened to be in the hall
at the moment of entering, and said:
"1 am afraid you will have to wait a
little, for 1 have a nice operation on
hand." To his attendant he said, "James,
take these gentlemen into my private
office," and disappeared.
The attendant was evidently astonished.
"I've been with Dr. Fassett three
years," he Raid, as he led the way, "but
rve never known this to occur before,
though I've Reen them sitting in the hall
before this."
Cathcart whispered to the officer to
remain in the hall.
The private office of the physician was I
a small room, evidently an extension j
from the main building, for it was light- I
ed pleasantly from the side.
Between the two windows was a small j
roller top desk. In the center a flat table
where the physician evidently did his
writing. At one window was a large
operating chair, but devoted by its owner
to the pnrpo.se of ease. A low easy chair,
Into which DoriBon dropped, was on the
side of the center table, opposite to that
on which the writing chair stood. In
the corner was an iron safe, the heavy
door of which was open, the inner one
Dnly being closed.
So soon as the door was shut upon the
attendant Cathcart began a minute examination
of the room, much to Dorijon's
annoyance, who thought his companion
was displaying an impertinent
ouriosity
He even opened the portfolio of the
doctor and turned over its leaves. Between
two of them was a letter partly
written, and Cathcart did not scruple to
read it Nor a letter addressed to the
physician.
Unable to contain himself longer, Dorison
protested, intimating that it was
highly improper to read the private papers
of a gentleman who had trusted
them to the extent of turning them into
his own private room.
To this Cathcart made no answer, but
asked coolly:
"Didn't that woman Bay that Langdon
had some hold on Dr. Fassett?"
"Yes."And
young Eustace suspected something
of the kind from the way in which
Langdon treated Fassett?"
"Yes."
"Well, they are both right," I should
judge, from these things. This letter,"
taking up one. "is signed 'Harry,' and
intimates that they must have some
more business from the doctor or the
fur will fly. This one," taking up the
one partially completed, "tells Harry
that there will be no more business;
that he has been his servant as long as !
he ever will be, and that the end is j
reached, since he is now in a position to I
do for Harry what Harry threatened to I
do for the writer. It seems to be a declaration
of independence."
He closed the book, leaving it precisely
as he found it. On the mantelpiece
he found a case of instruments and became
much interested in it, taking out
each one and examining it closely, putting
them back one by one.
Every visible object in the room !
seemed to go under his touch, but when
he went to the roller top desk, and taking
a wire from his pocket deliberately
picked the lock and softly moved up the
top, Dorison could stund it no longer.
"If you do not end this thing," he I
cried, "1 certainly shall ask the doctor to '
come here."
"Be quiet," said Catheart contemptuously.
"Everything is grist that comes
to my mill."
His search was not rewarded, and he
closed the desk.
The safe now claimed his attention, j
The key had been left carelessly in the
inner door; calmly turning it he threw
it open and as calmly and coolly inspected
its contents. Perceiving in one of
its pigeonholes a bundle, he took it out <
and ran over the ends of it. This seemed
to be interesting for him, for he closed
the door, turned the key and walked to
Dne of the windows. Taking off the !
elastics which bound it he shuffled the .
various papers in his fingers, and put- j
ting the rubber bands on again went
back to the 6afe as if he intended to re- J
st-nrn +Viotn tVion t.nminf? nnicklv on his i
heel, went to the door and called the
officer, who was awaiting him in the !
hall.
To Dorison he now turned and said;
"I have found something which will ;
throw some light on Harold Farish and
the relations existing between him and |
Fassett."
Dorison was about to protest, but he
observed that the old man's eyes were j
lashing fire.
To the officer who entered he said:
"I want you to sit down here and keep \
your mouth shut."
He put the package of papers in the
Inner pocket of his coat, und going to '
the center table leaned against it, thrust- !
Ing his hands in his vest pockets and
dropping his chin on his breast.
There was something so extraordinary
In his manner that both men watched
him silently.
Perhaps ten minutes elapsed, when
the attendant opened the door and said
that the doctor would see them.
Dorison rose to obey the summons, i
but Cathcart waved him back with an j
imperious gesture.
"Tell the doctor," he said, "to come
here?it is important."
The attendant disappeared, and Dori- j
jon looked to the old detective for an
explanation.
None was forthcoming.
In a moment more Dr. Fassett hurried 1
in, with a frown of impatience and an- j
noyance clouding his brow.
"Close the door," said Cathcart to the
Dfficer.

Prom MnrHthon, also, dated a new departure
in the conduct of warfare, since of
course a field so surprising in its results
had its genius and its hero for the emulation
of men who should come afterward.
This was Milt.iades, a citizen of Athens,
who had been in the service of Darius
the Mede, and had shurpened his wits as a
soldier of fortune in some of the conquered
colonies where he was a satrap of the Persian
king. The Athenians forgave him
grave sins and elected him one of the
ten generals of their army, when ho returned
to them with a price upon his head
for an act of dariug treachery to Durius.
The Persian army set out in the year 490
B. C. to punish Athens for having assisted

usurpation and ty:ranny, and having conquered
the neighboring Eubcea and razed
its city, Eretria, es an example of what
would befall Athens, they landed on the
plain of Marathon with over 100,000 men,
intending to match upon Athens. The
Athenians went out to meet them 10,000
strong, summoning their neighbors to
lend a hand. The Spartans promised to
do so, but religious scruples detained
them, and the Pla seans sent 1,000 men to
repay a similar service rendered some
years before.
When the Athenian generals saw Darius'
host before them and beheld their own
weak muster a division of opinion showed
itself at once. The Persian troops up to
this dnte bad proved invincible in every
contest waged against the Greeks, and the
very name of Mede sent terror to the souls
of the bravest son of Hellas. The Athenl- ]
a lis, Ijowever, had immense advantages in
spite of their weak battalions, and five
generals out of ten voted for nn immediate
battle. The Pers ans had landed on a low
plain but slightly elevated from the beach,
and the Greeks were upon a heighi; that
encircled the plain nearly from fihore to
shore. At the extremities of the height
were marshes which at the season?autumn?were
impassable for troops. Five

sians hod corno to light, they should be allowed
to take the initiative and butt their
heads against the Athenian spears that
would awuit them at every turn. Besides,
Bince the Spartan i were coming up to aid
their fellows, it would be best to postpone
action until their arrival at least.
On the other bend, Ave colleagues voted
for immediato attack on the Persian camp.
Miltiades headed this party and founded
bis opinion on his knowledge of the Persian
troops, whom be deemed inferior to Greeks
when the latter were well bandied, and his
belief in the uncertainty of human affairs,
no matter how rose colored they might appear.
Athens was twenty-two miles distant
from Marathon, and there, Bafely hiding
while better men were on the warpath,
were factions of scheming men ready to
betray the state into the hands of Darius for
their own ends. An expelled tyrant of
Athens, Hippins, was in the Persian camp
instigating the warfare on his people in
OKBEK PIGHTI.NO MES\
the hope of being reinstated as a satrap of j
the conqueror. Of course he had tools nt
work in Athena, and hence Miltiades believed
thut what might be gained by delay
in the Held w ould be lost in giving time for
plotters to get up a fire in the rear.
The ten generals were evenly divided, and i
In such emergencies the war ru ler had the
deciding vote. That oflico was fille<l by an
Athenian noble, Callimochus, who was listening
gravely to the discussion of the gen- j
erals. Miltiades appealed to bin:, with somewhat
blunt, but forcible eloquence, to vote
for an offensive policy. "It now rests with
you, Callimochus," he said, "either to enslave
Athens, or, by assuring her freedom,
to win for yourself immortality of fame,
such as not even Harmodius and Aristogeiton
have acquired; for never Hince the
Athenians w ere a people were they in such
danger as they are at this moment. If they
bow the knee to these Medes they are to he
given up to Hippias, and you know what I
they then will have to suffer. Butif Athens !
comes victorious out of this contest she
has is in her to become the first city of
Greece. Your vote is to decide whether we
are to join battle or not. If we do not bring
on a battle presently some factious intrigue
will disunite the Athenians and the city
will be betrayed to the Medes. But if wo
fight before there is anything rotten in the
state of Athens, I believe that, provided
the gods will give fair play and no favor,
we are able to get the best of it in an engagement."
Callimachus was won, and theothergen- j
erals elected Miltiades chief for the campaign
and acted under his orders.
The Persians meanwhile were doing j
nothing except to urge on Hippias in his j
schemes of fomenting treachery behind the j
backs of the Greek soldiery. Miltiades !
counted upon the superiority in organismtion
and armor of his soldiery and upon I
tiieir patriotic enthusiasm. The situation
demanded bold tactics. The custom of his j
time was to advance the whole line of bat- !
tie slowly and steadily in uniform phalanx. |
But the llehl of Marathon was so broad us |
to call for n.u extended line, and Miltiades
concentrated heavily on the wings and i
weakened the center. The formation of '
the ground favored his movements of !
preparation, unobserved by the cnc(fi?, un- |
til all was ready. Then the trumpet sound- ;
ed, hymns and exhortations werti chanted, j
and 11,(XX) spearmen rushed down t,he-slope !
upon the unsuspecting Asiatics. The rapid- j
ity of movement was also an innovat ion, j
but the objections usually urged, that sol- !
dicrs who go in on the run exhaust theii j
wind before they get into action, would
not apply to Athenians, who were trained I
runners from youth, l'ompey in his time !
held to this objection, but Cluesar believed |
that running excited the soldiers' courage j
and gave force to their blows.
The Persian army was composed of many !
mongrel hordes, nevertheless it had a substantial
force of disciplined men under aide
leaders. The rush of tho Athenians took i
all by surprise, and tho irregulars, who ,
acted as mounted men, did not have time
to get in line. The Greeks were heavily
equipped, bearing spears, holinets, breastplates.
shields, greaves and short swords,
The' Persians had no armor and only
wicker shields, with short lances and
cimeters for weapons. The shock of the
first attack broke down the front line of
Persians, but they rallied and set to work
to retrieve, individually and by weight of
numbers, what they had lost in the surprise.
The best Persian troops were in the
center, and they succeeded in not only repulsing
the Greek center, but in driving it
back across the plain up a valley that divided
the mountain side. The Greek wings,
however, had been successful, and had
routed everything opposed to them. This
was the turning point, and the faith of
Miltiadcs in the organization of bis soldiery
was justified.
In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
victorious soldiers rush wildly in pursuit
and go too far. Such a mistake at Marathon
would have changed the history of the
world. Put the Greeks in both flanks

| nt their head and led them upon the victorious
Persian center. The discomfited
Greek center, seeing this, rallied and renewed
the fight. The compact formation was
the one for the new emergency, and Greek
discipline enabled Miltiades to vary his
tactics in the heat of action.
The solid ranks of the united columns
of the Greeks and their heavy nrraor
and superior equipment for fighting at
close quarters defeated every effort of
the Asiatics, and flnully the whole Persidn
host was in a rout. And at this time, the
proper moment, the spirit of carnage that
had come upon the Greeks by reason of
their successful blows was given full pluy,
and they pursued the shattered masses to
I the water's edge, and cut them down in the
ships drawn upon the l>each for embarkation.
Many ships were lwarded and fired,
and the Asiatics who had the temerity to
offer resistance were drowned or slaughtered.
The Greek loss was mainly sustained
on the bench. Cnllimachus fell there, and
also one of the ten generals. Seven Persian
galleys were burned, and the rest
quickly pushed off, l>earing away a vast
army, so far as numbers went, despite the
enormous loss in battle.
But Miltiades' work was not ended.
Athens was still exposed to treachery, and
tothecruft of Darius' able general, Datis.
Hippins had l>ccu killed in the battle, but
his emissaries might unwittingly betray
the scantily garrisoned city to the Persians
if tn iln so while the-Athenian
army was at a distance. The hero of Marathon
did not sit down on his laurels, but
left a guard over the fabulous spoils of the
field, aud before daylight on the morning
after the battle mustered his weary soldiers
on the heights above the city, where,
to tho umazement of the Persian leader,
they lay in full view of his fleet ns it entered
the harbor of Athens after u rapid
night's sail.
The victory was complete. The Persians
withdrew, aud tho moral effect was such
that Grecian courage never quailed and
never yielded before the monster hordes of
the Orient.
The Persian dead on the field were over
b!x thousand, and great numbers were
drowned in the sea or burned in tho ships.
The Athenian dead, numbering only 192,
were exceptionally honored by interment
upon the battlefield, where a mound was
raised over their bones, and ten columns
I were erected to commemorate the fallen of
the ten tribes which took part in the bat
[ tie. The Spartan re-enforcements to the
numl>er of 2,000 made a forced march of
150 miles in three days, but were too late
to share in the glory. Tho tactics of Miltiades
at Marathon have been a study for
military men ever since. Had he adhered
to Grecian custom uud spread his men in a
uniform line they would not huve been
able tx> strike a telling blow at any given
point, and could have been broken with
ease. Had he sent them in at a slow pace
the Persians would have had time to form
and offer stout resistance. The formation
in heavy wings and a weak center was better
than a strong center and light wings,
because the center, even though successful,
could have been flanked by the Persians
with their ample forces and the favorable
open ground on either side. Yet
for a.U this it was the steadiness of the
Greek wings in stopping the pursuit at the
proper time and in re-forming to assail the
Persian center that carried the day.
The Persian cavalry, believed to have
been 10,000 strong, seems not to have put
in a blow, although the Persians selected
the plains of Marathon as u spot especially
adapted for this arm of service, of which
tho Greeks had none.

Fate of a Faralytlo Smoker.
About once in so often a tragedy is announced
as the result of smoking in bed.
The latest victim is Louis H. Heberlim, a |
helpless paralytic, aged 65, who was fatally
burned at his home in Brooklyn one evening
recently. The old man, who was unable
to leave his bed, was left alone by his
wife while she went out to do the marketing.
His 14-year-old daughter was in anotner
part of the house, and after a while
had her attention attracted to the smell of
smoke. On searching for the cause she
discovered that it cume from her father's
upnrtinent, and on entering was horrified
to see the bed in flames and the old man
feebly fighting for his life. Her brother, a
barber, who was employed next door, was
the first to answer her frantic calls for
help. In his endeavor to rescue the invalid
he was badly burned about the hands, but
his efforts to save his father's life were unavailing,
as he was found to bo dead when
the flames wero extinguished. An investigation
showed that the dead man had
lighted a pipe, and in this way had set fire
to the bed.
She Went Mad and Died.

her arrival erased tho writing, but she
worried so over the affair that she fell ill,
went mad and died within the week. Now
the people are anxious to make the acquaintance
of the scoundrel responsible
for her death. The charge of murder was
based on rumors in connection with a
tragedy that occurred twenty years ago.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
What tbe President Said to the S2nd
Congress.
The president's message was read
before both houses of congress on their
assembling last Wednesday. It is a
lengthy document and here is a synopsis
of it.
The message begins by calling attention
to the reports of the heads of departments
and the members of congress
are advised to read them all. It is
stated that terms satisfactory to this
country have been agreed upon in the
controversy about the Behring sea seal
fisheries.
The president recommends that provision
be made for joint demarcation
of the boundry between the United
States and Canada wherever the same
is rendered necessary by the increasing
settlement along the frontier.
He is gratified to be able to report
that Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria
and France, in the order named,
have opened their ports to inspected
American pork.
THE NEW ORLEANS LYNCHING.
The lynching at New Orleans in
March last of eleven men of Italian^
nationality by a mob of citizens was a
most deplorable and discreditable incident.
It did not, however, have its
origin in any general animosity to the
Italian people, nor in any disresp&it
to the government of Italy, with which
our relations were of the most friendly
character. The fury of the mob was
directed against these men as the sup
posed participants or accessories iu iue
murder of a city officer. I do not allude
to this as mitigating in any degree
this offense against law and humanity,
but only affecting the international
questions which grew out of it.
It was at once represented by the
Italian minister that several of those
whose lives had been taken by the
mob, were Italian subjects. A demand
was made for punishment of the
participants and for an indemnity to the
families of those who were killed. It
is regretted that the manner in which
these claims were presented was not
such as to promote calm discussion of
the questions involved, but this may
be attributed to the excitement and indignation
which the crime naturally
evoked.
The views of this government as to
its obligations to the foreigners domiciled
here was fully stated in the correspondence
as well as its purpose to
make an investigation of the affair with
a view to determine whether they
would present circumstances that could
under such rules of duty as we had indicated
create an obligation on the
United States.
The temporary absence of a minister
plenipotentiary of Italy at this capital
has retarded the further correspondence,
but it is not doubted that a
nnn/>liioinn ia nttoinnhlp
11 1C11UIJ I/UUVIUOIVU IO MV?Ml**wvw?
The president recommends that congress
make offenses against the treaty
rights of foreigners domiciled in the
United States cognizable in the federal
courts.
THE CHILIAN WARFARE.
The president rehearses the history
of the Chilian revolution and of the
Itata incident, and says: The instructions
to our naval officers and to our
ministers at Santiago from first to last
of this struggle enjoined on them the
most impartial treatment and absolute
non-interference.
I am satisfied that these instructions
were observed, and that our representatives
were always watchful to use
their influence impartially in the interest
of humanity, and on more than
one occasion did so effectively. We
could not forget, however, that this
government was in diplomatic relations
with the then established government
of Chili, as it is now in such relations
with the successor of that government.
I am quite sure that President Montt,
who has, under circumstances of promise
for the peace of Chili, been installed
as president of that republic, will
not desire that, in the unfortunate event
of any revolt against his authority the
policy of this government should be
other than that which we have recently
observed.
No official complaint of the conduct
of our minister or of our naval officers
during the struggle has been presented
to this government. It is a matter
of regret that so many of our own
people should have given ear to unofficial
charges and complaints that manifestly
had their origin in rival interests
and in a wish to prevent the relations
of the United States with Chili.
THE "BALTIMORE" INCIDENT.
Concerning the attack on the sailors
of the United States man-of-war, Baltimore,
in the harbor of Yaparaiso on
the 16th of October, and the killing
of several of their number, the president
recites the demand for reparation
made by this government on the Chilian
authorities and says:
It is to be regretted that the reply
secretary of foreign affairs of the provisional
government was couched in
an offensive tone. To this no response
has been made. This government is
now awaiting the result of an investigation
which has been conducted by
the criminal court at Valparaiso. It is
reported unofficially that the investigation
is about completed, and it is expected
that the result will soon be communicated
to this government, together
with some adequate and satisfactory response
to the note by which the attention
of Chili was called to this incident.
If these just expectations should be
disappointed or further needless delay
intervene, I will, by a special message
bring this matter again to the attention
of congress for such action as muy ue
necessary.
KIOTING IN CHINA.
The late outbreak against foreigners
in various parts of the Chinese empire
has been a cause of deep concern in
view of the numerous establishments
of our citizens in the interior of that
country. This government can do no
less than insist upon a continuance of
the protective and punitory measures
which the Chinese government has
heretofore applied. No effort will be
omitted to protect our citizens peaceably
sojourning in China, but recent
unofficial information indicates that
what was at first regarded as an outbreak
of such violence against foreigners
has assumed the larger form of an
insurrection against public order
The position taken by the Chinese
in refusing to accept Hlair is referred
to us untenable, for the reason that if
China objected to Hlair because of his
opposition to Chinese immigration,
then, of course, that country must
also object to our legislation on the
subject.
The president recommends that the
government guarantee the bonds of
the Maritime Canal company engaged
in the construction of the Panama
canal.
He says that he believes a full test
will develop the fact that the McKinley
tariff act in favorable in its average
effect upon articles coming in common
use. Continuing, he says: "During
the twelve months from October 1,
1890, to September 30, 1891, the total
value of our foreign commerce?im- i
ports and exports combined?was $1,747,800,44(5,
which was the largest of |
any year in the history of the United i
States. The largest in any previous
year was in 1890, when our commerce
amounted to $l,(i">7,139,093, and the
last year exceeds this enormous aggregate
by over $100,000,000." He pursues
the subject with a long array of
figures to prove the wisdom of the liepublican
tariff policy.
The report of the secretary of the
treasury, he says, shows that the toiai
receipts of the government from all
sources for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1891, were $458,544,233.03, while
the expenditures for the same period,
were $421,304,740.46, leaving a surplus
of $37,239,762.57. The receipts of the
fiscal year ending June 30,1892, actual
and estimated, are $433,000,000, and
the expendigires $409,000,000. For
the fiscal year ending June 30. 1893,
the estimated receipts are $455,336,350
and the expenditures $440,300,093.
THE SILVER QUESTION.
Concerning the effect of the silver
act of the last congress,'the president
says:
I hope the depression in the price of
silver is temporary, and that a further
trial of this legislation will more favorably
affect it. That the increased value
of currency thus supplied for the
use of the people was needed, and that
beneficial results upon trade and prices
have followed this legislation I think
must be very clear to every one; nor
should it be forgotten that for every
dollar of these notes issued a full dollar's
worth of silver bullion was at the
time deposited in the treasury as security
ffrrffeTedempttoir.11 Upon
this subject as upon the tariff,
my recommendation is that the existing
laws be given a full trial, and that
our business interests be saved the distressing
influence which threats of
nhnnpA ftlwnvs imnart. Under
X'
existing legislation it is in the power of
the treasury department to maintain
that essential condition of national
finance as well as of commercial prosperity,
the parity in use of the coin
dollars and their paper representatives.
The assurance that these powers
would be freely and unhesitatingly
used has done much to produce and
sustain the present favorable business
conditions.
I am still of the opinion that the
free coinage of silver under existing
conditions would disastrously affect
our business interests at home and
abroad. We could not hope to maintain
an equality in the purchasing
power of the gold and silver dollar in
our own markets, and in foreign trade
the stamp gives no added value to the
bullion contained in coins. The producers
of the country, its farmers and
laborers, have the highest interest that
ever dollar, paper or coin, issued by
the government shall be as good as any
other. If there is one less valuable
than another its sure and constant
errand will bo to pay them for their
toil and for their crops. The money
Ipndnr will nrotoct himself bv stipula
tion for payment in gold, but the laborer
has never been able to do that. To
place business on a silver basis would
mean a sudden and severe contraction
of the currency by the withdrawal of
gold and gold notes of such an unsettling
of all values as would produce a
commercial panic.
I cannot believe that a people so
strong and prosperous as ours will promote
such a policy. The producers of
silver are entitled to just consideration,
but they should not forget that
the government is now buying and
putting out of the market an equivalent
of the product of the entire silver
mint.
SURPLUS, CIRCULATION, ETC.
The president states that on March
1, 1889 the surplus in the treasury was
$183,027,190.29. That surplus has
been applied to the redemption of interest
bearing securities, of which,
since the above date $259,079,350 have
been redeemed, resulting in a reduction
of $11,684,675 in the annual interest
charge. He says that on March
1, 1889, the circulation of the country
was $1,404,205,816, or $23.03 per capita
and on December 1, 1891, it was
$1,577,262,070, or $24.38 per capita.
THE POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The president compliments the work
of the postmaster general and says
that the revenues of the department
show an increase of over $5,000,000,
with the deficit for the year 1890 of
less than $4,000,000, while the estimate
for the year '93 shows a surplus
of receipts over expenditures. The
president concurs in the recommendation
that the free delivery system be at
once extended to towns of 5,000
population. He also endorses the suggestion
for a rural postal delivery.
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The Newark, Concord, Bennington
and Miantanomah have been added to
the navy during the year with an aggregate
of something more that 11,900
tons. Twenty-four war ships of all classes
are now under construction in the
navy yard and private shops, but while
work is going forward satisfactorily the
completion of more important vessels
will yet require about a year's time.
The president recommends that steps
be taken looking to the acceptance of
citizenship by the Indians on the various
reservations, and to that end that
they be represented in congress.
THE PENSION BUREAU.
The president says that the administration
of the pension bureau has been
characterized during the year by great
diligence. The total number of pensions
upon the roll of June 30, 1891,
was 676,160. The appropriation for
the payment of pensions for the fiscal
year 1890 and 1891 was $127,685,793.89,
and the amount expended was $118,530,649.25,
leaving an unexpended surplus
of $8,155,144.64. In concluding
his comments on the pensions, the
president says: "While these disbursements
to the disabled soldiers of the
great civil war are large, they do not
realize the exaggerated estimate of
those who oppose this beneficent legislation."
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS.
The president calls attention to the
departure taken by the State of Michigan
in changing tire mode of selecting
presidential electors, so as to elect them
by districts instead of for the State at
large, which he regrets as an unfortunate
and even a threatening episode,
and one that may well suggest whether
the States who have given their ap
proval to the old prevailing method
ought not to secure by a constitutional
amendment a practice which has had
the approval of all. The Michigan
method, the president says, brings the
selection of electors under the influence
of a gerymander, and establishes
a minority rule that only a political
convulsion can overthrow."
"It is not my purpose here to discuss
the question whether a choice by the
legislature or by the voters of equal
single districts is a choice by the State,
but only to recommend such regulation
of this matter by constitutional amendment
as will secure uniformity and
prevent that disgraceful partisan jug- I
glnry to which such a liberty of choice,
if it exists, oilers a temptation."
THK KLKtTlON qLKSTION.
Nothing just now is more important j
than to provide every guaranty for the
absolute fair and free choice by an equal
.suffrage within the respective States of
all the officers of the national government,
whether that suffrage is directly, I
as in the choice of members of the i
house of representatives, or indirectly
as in the choice of senators and elec- ;
tors of president.
Respect for public officers and obe- !

characteristics of our people until our ;

fraud, suppression or gerrymander. ;
If I were called upon to declare ;
wherein our chief national danger lies,
I should say without hesitation, in the
overthrow of majority control by the
suppression or perversion of the popular
suffrage. That there is a real danger
here all must agree, but the enor

chiefly expended in trying to fix the
responsibility upon the opposite party
rather than in efforts to make such
practices impossible by either party it
is not possible now to adjourn that interminable
and inconclusive debate,
while we take by consent one step in
the direction of reform by eliminating
the gerrymander, which has been denounced
by all parties as an influence
in the selection of electors of president
and members of congress. All the
States have, acting freely and separately,
determined tha t the choice of electors
by a general ticket is the wisest
and safest method and it would seem
there could be no objection to a constitutional
amendment making the method
permanent. Jf a legislature chosen
in one year upon purely local questions
should, pending a presidential contest,
meet, rescind the law for a choice
of electors by the legislature and this
trick should determine the result, -it
is not too much to say that the public
peace might be seriously and widely
endangered.
THE FORCE BILL.

bers to the house of representatives.
The power of congress is ample to deal
with this threatening and intolerable
abuse. The unfailing test of sincerity
in election reform will be found in a
willingness to confer as to remedies and
to put into force such measures as will
most effectually preserve the right of
the people to freo and equal representation.
An attempt was made in the last
congress to bear the constitutional
powers of the general government for
the correction of frauds against the
suffrage. It is impossible to know
whether the opposition to such measures
is really vented in particular features
supposed to be objectionable, or
includes any proposition to give to the
election laws of the United States adequacy
to the correction of grave and
acknowledged evils.
I must yet entertain the hope that it
is possible to secure a calm, patriotic
consideration of such constitutional or
statutory changes as may be necessary
to a choice of officers of the government
to the people by fair appointment
and full elections. I believe it would
be impossible to constitue a commission
non partisan in its membership and
composed of patriotic, wise and impartial
men, to whom a consideration of
the question of the evils connected
with our election system and methods
might be committed, with a good prospect
of securing unanimity in a plan

The constitution would permit the selection
of the committee to be vested
in the supreme court if that method
would give the best guarantee of impartiality.
This commission should be charged
with the duty of inquiring into the
whole subject of the law of elections, ,
as related to the choice of officers of
the national government, with a view
to securing to every elector a free and
unmolested exercise of the suffrage,
and as near an approach to an equality
of value in each ballot cast as is attainable.
While the policies of the general government
upon the tariff, upon the restoration
of our merchant marine, upon
river and harbor improvements, and
other such matters of grave and general
concern are liable to be turned this
way, or that fcy the resultsjof congressional
elections and administration policies
sometimes involving issues that
tend to peace or war, to be turned this
way or that by the result of a presidential
election. There is a rightful
interest in all the States, and in ever}'
congressional district that will not be
deceived or silenced by the audacious
pretense that the question of the right
of any body of legal voters in any State
or in any congressional district to give
their suffrages freely upon these general
questions is a matter only of geneor
local concern or control.
The demand that the limitations of
suffrage shall be found in the law and
only there is a just demand, and no
just man should resent or resist it. My
appeal is and will continue to be, for a
consultation that shall proceed with
candor, calmness and patience upon
the lines of justice and humanity, not
of prejudice and cruelty.
To the cousideration of these very
grave questions, I invitejnot only the
attention of congress, but that of all
patriotic citizens. ' We must not entertain
the delusion that our people have
ceased to regard a free ballot and equal
representation as the price of their allegiance
to laws and to civil raagistration.
I have been greatly rejoiced to notice
many evidences of the increased
unification of our people and of a revived
national spirit. The vista that
now opens to us is wider and more
glorious than ever before. Gratification
and amazement struggle for supremacy
as we contemplate the population,
wealth and moral strength of
our country. A trust, momentous in
its influences upon our people and upon
the world, is, for a brief time, committed
to us, and we must not be faithless
to its first condition, and the defence
of the free and equal influence of the
people in the choice of public officers
and in the control of public affairs.

Too Important.?A reasonable degree
of self-confidence is almost essential
to one's comfort and efficiency, but
if a man has a very exalted opinion of
his own abilities, he will do well to
keep it to himself.
An exchange relates that a certain
dry goods clerk was in the habit of
saying to his associates that the concern
would find it pretty hard to get
along without him. These remarks
came to the ears of the senior partner,
and he called the clerk into the inner
office.
"Mr. Jenkins," he begun, "you nuvo
been very efficient and we highly appreciate
your services, hut we have
heard it said that if you were to die
the business could not possibly survive
the loss. This has worried us a good
deal, for you like all the rest of us, are
liable to drop off' suddenly.
"We have concluded, therefore, for
j our peace of mind, to experiment while
j we arc both in good health, and see if
the concern can bear up under your
loss. You will accordingly consider
j yourself dead for one year, and we will
j try to get along without you for that
| length of time."

flaT" There is one French custom we
should like to see introduced into the
United States and become universal.
In France, when a funeral passes every
man raises his hat to salute it. The
deceased person may have been a child,
a pauper or a beggar; it is no matter;
the cortege is saluted by every man
whether he be prince, millionaire, or
mendicant. It is a good and lovely
custom.
