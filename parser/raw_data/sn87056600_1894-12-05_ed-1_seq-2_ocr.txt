THE INDIANA STATE SENTINEL, WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 5, 189i.
but they include practically the entire sum
necessary to complete ana equip all the
rew ships not now In commission, so that
unless other new ships arc authorized, the
appropriations for the naval service for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1837. should fall
below the estimates for the coming year
by at least $12,000,000.
The secretary presents, with much
earnestness, a plea for thi authorization
of three additional battleships and ten
or twelve torpedo boats. While the. un
larmored vessel- heretofore authorized,
including those now nearing completion,
will cons.Itute a fleet which it is believed
L sufficient for ordinary cruising pur
poses in time of peace, we have njw but
four first-class battleships and but few tor
pedo boats. If we are to have a navy for
warlike operations, offensive and defensive,
we certainly ought to increase bdh the
number of battleships and torpedo boats.
The manufacture of armor requires ex-
pensive plants and the aggregation of many
skilled workmen. All the armor nces-irv
to complete the vessels now building will
bo delivered before the 1st of June next.
If no new contracts are given out. contrac
tor must disband their workmen and their
plant must lie idle. Battleships authorized
at this time would not be well under way
until late in the coming fiscal year, and at
least three yearj and a half from thj date
of the contract would be required for their
completion. The secretary states that rot
more than 15 per cent, of the cost of euch
shipa need be included in the appropriations
for the coming year. I recommend that
provision be made for the construction of
additional battleships and torpedo boats.
The cretary recommends the manufac
ture not only of a reserve supply of ord
nance and ordnance material for ship3 cf
the navy, but also a supply for the
auxiliary fleet. Guns and their arpurten
ances should be provided and kept on hand,
for both these purposes. We have not to
day a single gun that could be put upon
the ships, Paris or New York, of the In
ternational navigation company, or any
othr ship of our reserve navy. The manu
facture of guns at the Washington navy
yard is proceeding satisfactorily, and none
ef our rew ship. will be required to wait
for their guns or ordnance equipment.
An important order has been issued by
tha secretary of the navy, co-ordinating the
duties of the several bureaus concerned in
the construction of ships, This ord-r. i: is
believed, will secure to a greater extent than
has heretofore been p issible. the harmonious
action of these several bureau.-;, and make
the attainment of th? best results more cer
tain. During the past fiscal year there has
been an unusual ar.d pressing demand in
many quarters of the w rM for the pres
ence of vessels to guird American inter
ests. In January last, during the Brazilian
Insurrection, a large 11. vt was concentrated
in the harbor at 1:1 de Janeiro. The vig
orous action of Hear Admiral Henh.im in
protecting the personal and commercial
rights of our citizens during the disturb -d
conditions afforded results which will, it is
believed, have a far-reaching and whole
some Influence whenever, in like circum
stances, it may become necessary for our
naval commanders to interfere on behalf of
our people in foreign ports. The war now
in progress between China and Japan his
rendered it nece.-siry or expedient to dis
patch eight vessels to those waters.
Hoth the secretary of lhe navy and tha
secretary of the trcisury recommend the
transfer of the wrk of the coast survey
property to the nivy department. I hearti
ly concur in this rec mniend itlon. Ex
cluding Alika and a very small area be
sides, all the work of mapping and chin
ing our coasts has been completed. The
hydrographic work, which must be done
over and over again by reason cf the shift
ing and varying dr-pth of w iter consequent
upon the action cf streams and tides, has
heretofore Icen done under the direction
cf naval officers, subordinate to the su
perintendent of the coast survey. There
seems to b no good reas u why th? nivy'
should iut hive entire charge hereafter of
sueh wirk, e.-peciilly a the hydr o graph in
office of the navy department is n'"w. and
has ben for many years, engaged in mak
ing efnVL-nt maps entirely similar to tho.se
prepared by the coast survey.
The Iteronimentlxitl'tn.
I fe-l it my imp-rative duty to c ill at
tention to th recommendation of the
feerilary in regard to the personnel of
the l:n of the navy. The stagnation of
th? promotion of th;s. the vital branch
of the r-crvii i'. is so groat as to serlou-dy
impair its efTiciency. I consider it of the
utrrii-l in.p.irr.m.e that the young and

The report of lac secretary of the in

The public latd d:p . d of during the
yeer :m n:;d It 10 "C. 100.77 a -res. ira lud
ing 23.8TC.OS acres of Indian lards. It is
estimated that the public d main still re
miinir.g amounts to a little m re thin ßfiO,
000,000 acres, excluding, h e.vever, ab nit
2'3ö,000,0'K acre3 in Alaska, as well as mili
tary reservation aid riilroad and other
elo2tins of lands yet unadjudicated. The
tatal cish receipts from sale of lands
amounted to $2.671 2Sä.T9, including J91,
$31.03 received from Indian lands. Thirty
five thousand patents were issued for ag
ricultural lands and 3,100 patents were is
sued ta Indians for allotments of their
holding; In severalty. th- land to allnttt-.J
b?lr.g inalienable by the Indian allntees
for a pert-xl of twenty-five years after
patent. There were certified and patented
on account of railroad and wag an road
grant3 during the year S3.V,.j6.4.j atre.s of
land, and at the clse of the year 20,0;)0.0')0
acre3 were embraced in th lists Df selec
tions mads by railroad and wigo.a road
companies and awaited settbm'nt.
The select isriis of swamp lanris, and that
taken a3 indemnity iher?for, since the
passage of the act providing for the same
in 1843. amount ta nearly or qirtie So 000.000
acres, cf which 5S.0o0.0W have been patent
ed to states. About 1 S.S. 000 acres were pat
ented during the last year. Nearly 820.000
acres of school and educational grants
wpre approved dur.ng th? year, and at
Us close 1,250,363.81 acres remained unad
justed. It appears that the appropriation for the
current yv&r on account of special serv
ice for the protection of the public lands,
and the timber thereon, is much less than
those for previous years, and Inadequate
for efficient performance of the work A
larger sum of money thin has been ap
propriated during a number of years past
on this account, has been returned to the
government, as a rult of the labors of
those employed in the particular service
mentioned, and I hop it will not be crip
pled by insufficient appropriation.
I fully Indorse the recommendation of
the secretary tnat adequate protection be
provided for our forest reserves, and that
a comprehensive forest system be inaug
urated. Such keepers and superintendents
as are necessary to' protect the forests
already reserved should be provided. I
am of the opinion that there should be an
abandonment of the policy sanctioned by
present laws under which the government,
for very small consideration, la rapidly
losing title to immense tracts of land -jov-ered
with timber, which shruld be prop
erly reserved as permanent sources of tim
ber supply.
The suggestion that a chance be made
in the minner of securing surveys of the
public lands is especially worthy of con
sideration. I am satisfied that these sur
veys should b mad1 by a corps of com
petent Purveyors und -T the immediate con
trol and direction of the commissioner of
the general land office.
An exceedingly important recrmmen iation
of the. secretary relates to the manner in
which contests and litigated cases growing
out of efforts to obtain government land are
determined. The entire testimony upon
which these controversies depend in all their
stages in taken before the local registers and
receivers, and yet these ofllers have no
power to subpoeni witnesses, or t enf orce
th"ir attendance to testify. These cases,
numbering three or four thousand annually,
are tent by the local officers to the commis
sioner of the general land pfflco for hw ac
ti n. The exigencie.4 of his other duties
oblige him to act upon the decisions of the
registers and receivers without an oppor
tunity of thorough personal examination.
Nearly twn thousand of these eas-s are
appealed annually from the commissioner to
the secretary of the interior. Iturdened with
other important administrative duties, his
determination of these appeals, must be al
most perfunctory, and based upon the ex
amination of others, though this determina
tion of the secretary operates as a final
adjudication upon rights of very great im
portance. I concur in the opinion that the
commissioner of the general land office
should be relieved from this duty of de
ciding litigated land cases, that a non-par-tban
court should be created to pasa on
such cases: and that the decisions of this
court should be final at least so far as the
decisions of the department are now final.
The proposed court might be given authori
ty to certify questions in matter of especial
importance to the supreme court of the
United Spates or the court of appeals for
the D-'striet of Columbia for decision. The
creation of such a tribunal would expedite
the dispofal of cases, and insure decision of
mire satisfactory character. The registers
and receivers, who originally hear and de
cide these disputes, should be Invested with
authority to compel witnesses to attend and
testify before them.
Condition of the Indians.
Though the condition of the Indians
show3 a steady and healthy progress,
the situation is not satisfactory at all
points. Pome of the Indians, to whom al
lotments of land have been made, are
found to be unable or disinclined to fol
low agricultural pursuits, or to otherwise
beneficially manage their land. This 13
especially true of the Cheyennes and
Arapahoes, who. it appears, by reports
of the agent, have in many Instances
never been located upon their allotments,
and In yome cases do not even know
where the allotments are. Their condi
tion has deteriorated. They are not self-
supportlng, and they live in camps and
spend their time in Idleness.
I have always believed that allotments
of reservation lands to Indians in sev
eralty should boj made sparingly, or at
least slowly, and with the utmost cau
tion. In these days, when the white agri
culturalists and stock-raisers of experi
ence and Intelligence lind their lot a hsrd
one. we ought not to expect Indians, un
less) far advanced in civilization and
habits of industry, to support themselves
on the small tracts of land usually al
lotted to them. If the self-supporting
schem by allotment failsi, the wretched
pauperism of the allottees which results
is worse than their original condition of
regular dependence. It is evident that
the evil consequences of ill-advised allot
ment are intensified in cass where the
f.:lse step can not be retraced, on account
of the purchase by the government of
reservation lands remaining after allot
ments are made, and the disposition of
su.-h remaining lands to settlers or pur
chasers from the government.
I am convinced that the proper solution
of the Indian problem and the success of
every step taken in that direction depend
t :i very large extent uin the intelli
gence and honesty of the reservation
agents and the interest they have in their
"ork. An nuent littul for his place can
much nward preparing the Indians
under his i-narge for citizenship and al
lotment of their lands, ;md his advice as
to any m Itter eor.cv rning their welfare
will not mislead. An fnfU agent will
make no tfTort ti advan.v the Indians on
his reservation toward civilization or
pre p:i ration for allotment of lands, in
sevr 'ty, and hi- opinion as to their con
dition in this and other regards is heul-lc-ss
and valu-'less.
The indications are that the detail of
c.-iry rtlico'-s as Indian agents will result
ia improved management on the reserva
tions. V.nenecer allotments are made and any
Indian on the reservation has previously
sejtl'd upon a lot and cultivated it, or
.h.ovii a disposition to improve it in any
way, such lot .should certainly be allotted
ti Km. and this -h ou! 1 be made plainly
oi Vi-c l tory by statute. In toe lifiht of ex
j rieti,-., and considering the uncertainty
of th Iiuu.tn situation, and its exigencies
io the fui'ire. I am pot only dispo-ol to be
very i.-tuiiiu's in making allotments, but
T incline t ;:gr, e with the sc retary of
the iaterior in the (.pinion tiiat when
: liotnients are made. the balance of
reservation land remaining after allot
ment, instead of being b night by the
givernment from the Indians, and
opened for s et t h rr.en ; . with su.-h scandals

ord-tiy way, :;r.i at led prices to b
determined by its location and desirabil
ity, and that the proceeds, le.ss expens.-s.
srto'.iid be held in trim tor the benefit of
the Indian proprietors.
The intelligent Indian school man ge
rn -en: of the past yetr has ben followed
by gratifying rfi'ti't". Efforts have, be-n
made to advance th" work in a sound and
practical minner. rive institutes of In
dian teachtr have been held during the
year, and hive proved very beneficial
through the views exchanged. and methods
d:.-cu -sr d, particularly applicable to Indian
education. Efforts are being made In the
directi n f a gradual reduction of the
number of Indian contract schools, so that
in a comparatively short time they may
Kive way altogether to government schools,
and it is hoped that the change rpay be so
gradual as to be perfected without too
Kreat expense to the government, or undue
disregard of investments mad? by those
wh- have established and are maintaining
such contract schools.

I'etmionn.
At the close of the last fiscal year, on
the 30th day of June, 1S31, there wert
9G9.544 persons on our pension ro"s, being
a net Increase of 3,532 over the number re
ported at the end of the previous year.
These pensioners may be classified, as fol
lows: Soldiers and pallors, survivors of
all wars, 753.963; widows and relatives of
deceased soldiers. 21.1.1G2; army nurses in
the war of the rebellion, 414. Of these pen
sioners 32,039 are surviving soldiers of In
dian and other wars prior to the late civil
war, and the widows or relatives of
such soldiers. The remainder, numbering
937.505, are receiving pensions on account
of th? war of the rebellion, and of these
469.314 are on the rolls under the authority
of the act of June 27, 1S90, sometimes
called the "dependent p-nsion law." The
total amount expended for pensions during
the year was $139,S04.461.05, leaving an un
expended balance from the sum appropri
ate! of t25,20.-',712.ßr. The sum necessary
to meet pension expenditures for the year
ending June 30, 1S03, Is estimated at $140,-
oon.ooo.
The commissioner of pensions is of the
opinion that the year 1S'.., being the thir
ti 'th after the close of the war of the le
bi Hi on. must, according to sensible human
calculation, see the highest limit of the pen
si jn roll, and after that year it must begin
to decline. The cliima pending in the
bureau have decreased mere thin 90,000 dur
ing the year. A large proportion of the
nw claims filed are for increase of person
by those now on the rolls. Th" number of
certificates issued was 80,213. The r.arnes
dropped from the roll for all causes during
the year numbered 37,951. Among our pen
id mors are nine widows and three daughters
of th' soldiers of the revolution, and forty
live survivors of the war of 1S12.
The barefaced and extensive pension
frauli oxposrd under th direction of the
courage .us and generous veteran soldier
now at the head of the bureau leaves no
room for the cl urn that no purgation of our
pen-hn roll was needed, or that continued
vigilance and prompt action are not nec
siry to the tsam end. The accusation that
an effort to detect pension frauds is evi
dence oc unfriendliness toward our worthy
veterans and a der.ial of their claims to the
goner oi-ity cf th'- government suggests an
unfortunate hdi'T-'ienoe to the commission

Kvporl nnil Imporl.s of Various Farm
lro! uetn.
The secretary of agriculture in his report
rcvi us the operiti ns of his department
for the 1 fiscal year, and makes recom
mendation.? for the further extcn-ion of
its usefulness. He reports a saving in
expenditure? during the year of $'100,000,
w'.ak-h is covered back into the treasury.
This sum is 23 per cent, of the entire ap
propriation. A special study has been made of the
demand for American farm products in
.all foreign market?, especially Groat
Britain. That country received from the
United Sutes during the nine months end
ing Sept. 30. 1S!M. 300,910 live beef cattle,
valued at 526.500,000, as against 1S2.611
cattle, valued at 516,631,000, during the
same period for 1S93. During the first Fix
months of 1891 the united kingdom took
also 112,000,000 pounds of dressed beef from
the United States, valued at at nearly $10.
000,000. The report shows that during the
nine months immediately preceding Sept.
CO. 1S94, the United States exported to
Great Britain 222,676,000 pounds of pork;
of apple-s, 1,900.000 bushels, valued at 52,
5O0.000, and of horses, 2.811, at an average
value of $139 a head.
There wa3 a falling off in American
wheat exports of 13.f00.000 bushels, and the
secretary is Inclined to believe that wheat
may not in the: future be the staple ex
port cereal product of our country, but
that corn will continue to advance in im
portance as an export on account of the
new uses to which it U constantly being
appropriited. The exports of agricultural
product from the United Sta.es for the
liscal year ending June 30. 1S94. amounted
to $62S.363,03S. beinjr 72.28 per cent. of
American exports of every description,
and the united kingdom of Great Uritain
took more than 54 per cent, of all farm
products finding foreign markets.
The department of agriculture has un
dertaken during the year two new and
important lines of research. The first
relates to grasses and forage plants with
the purpose of instructing and familiar
izing the people, as to the distinctive
grasses of the United States, and teach
ing them to how to introduce valuable for
eign forage plants which may be
adapted to thi.s country. The second re
lates to agricultural soils and crop pro
duction, involving the analysis of sam
ples of soils from all sections of the
American union to demonstrate their
adaptability to particular plants and
crops. Mechanical analysis of soils may
be of such inestimable utilitv thnt If i
foremost in the new. lines of agricul- i
tural research, and the secretary therefore
recommends that a division having It in
charge be permanently established in the
department.
The amount appropriated for the
w other bureau was $931.100. Of that
sum, $133,500, or 14 per cent., has been
paved and is returned to the . treasury.
As illustrating the usefulness of this
service, It may be here stated that the
warnings which were very generally ;
given of Iwo tropical storms occurring
in September and October of the present
year resulted In detaining safely in port
2.303 vessels, valued at $.1C,2S3.913, laden
with cargoes of probably still greater
value. What is much more important
and gratifying is that many hman lives
on these ships were also undoubtedly
saved.
II n renn of Animal Indnntry.
The appropriation to the bureau of
animal Industry was $$50,000 and the ex
penditures for the year were only $495,
429.21, thus leaving unexpended $354,570.76.
The inspection of beef animals for ex
port and interstate trade has been con
tinued, and' 12.944.0ÖG head wore inspected
during the year at a cost of 1 cents
per head, against 4i cents for 1&93. The
amount of pork microscopically examined
was 35.437.937 pounds, against 20.C77.410
pounds in the preceding year. The cost
of this Inspection has been diminished
from 8; cents per head in 1893 to G'.fc cents
In 1S94. The expense of insjecting the
pork sold in 1S94 to Germany and France
by the United States was $SS, 922.10. The
quantity inspected was greater by 16,
OoO.OOO pounds than during the preceding
year, when the cost of such inspection
was $172.367,028. The secretary recom
mends that the law providing for the
microscopical inspection of export and
interstate meat be so amended as to
compel owners of the meat inspected to
pay the cost of such inspection, and I
call attention to the arguments presented
In his report in support of this recom
mendation. The live beef cattle exported and tagged
during the year numlered 353.535. This
Is an Increase of 69..Ö33 head over the
previous year. The sanitary inspection
of cattle shipped to Euro? has cost an
average of 10i cents for each animal,
and the cost of Inspecting southern cattle
and the disinfection of cars and stock
yards averages 2.7 cents an animal.
The scientific Inquiries of the bureau of
animal industry have progressed stead
ily during the year. Much tuberculin and
mallein have been furnished to state
authorities for use in the agricultural
colleges and experiment stations for the
treatment of tuberculosis and glanders.
Quite recently this department has pub
lished the results of Its investigations of
bovine tuberculosis, and Its researches will
be vigorously continued. Certain herds In
the District of Columbia will be thorough
ly Inspected, and will probably supply
adequate scope for the department to In
telligently prosecute Its scientific work
and furnish Fufllcient material for pur
poses of Illustration, description and
definition.
The sterilization of milk suspected of
containing the bacilli of tuberculosis has
been, during the year, very thoroughly
examined in a leaflet by Dr. Salmon, the
chief of the bureau, and given general
circulation throughout the country.
Iterlnien SlntlonK.
The office of experiment stations, which
is a part of the United States department
of agriclture, has during the past year
engaged itself almost wholly in preparing
for publication works based upon the re
ports of agricultural experiment stations
and other institutions for agricultural In
quiry In th? United S'ates and foreign
countries. The secretary, in his report for
1S93. called attention to the fact that the
appropriatlon.-i made for the support of
the experiment stations throughout the
union were the only moneys taken out
of the national treasury by act of con
gress for which no accounting to federal
authorities was required. Itosponding to
this suggestion the Fifty-third congress,
in making the approbation for the de
partment for the pre -ei: fiscal year, pro
vided that the secretary of agriculture
shall prescribe th- f-rtn of annual finan
cial statement require! by s- c. 3 of aid

The best Service of th-e statistician of
the department -f agriculture is th?
ascertaining by dilig--; ' and care of the
actual and real c cief i .;:, fivorable or
unfavorable, to th f irm-.-rs of the coun
try, and to seek to - cius-es which produce
these conditions to th e.vl that the facts
ascertained may trni. b then- intelligent
treatment.
In obedience t j this "iw. th- department
of agriculture in.-ii i jj-iy nt out blank
forms of expense i ftr..- t each station
and proposes in od!:- .n to make, through
trusted experts, syst-;i iti examination of
the several stati e:s l uing -ach year for
the purpose of ac'inirng by persona! Inves
tigation the dets1.;'. -d : - f irm it ion necessary
to enable the svr -tory of agriculture to
mike, as the statu: - ir vi l--, a s itlsfac
tory report to r.ress. Toe boards of
management of the several stations, wi-h
great alacrity and oordiility. have approved
the amendments to the law, providing for
this supervision of their expanditurf s. an
ticipating that it will increase the efficiency
i f the stations and protect their directors
and managers frm loos? charges concern
ing their use of public funds, besides
bringing the department of agriculture into
closer and more confidential relations with
the experimental stations, and through
their joint service largely increasing
tht ir usefulness to agriculture of the coun
try. Acting upon a recommendation contained
in the report of 1S03. congress appropriated
SI 0.000 "to enable the secretary of agricul
ture to investigate and report up m the
nutritive value of th? virious articles and
commodities used for human food, with
special suggestion of full, wholesome and
edible rations less wasteful and more eco
nomical than those in common use." Un
der this appropriation the department his
prepared, and now has nearly ready for
distribution, an elementary discussion of
the nutritive value and pecuniary economy
of food. When we consider that fully one
half of all the money earned by the wage-
eimers of the civilized world is expended
bv them for food, the impirtanoe and util
itv of such an investigation is apparent.
Th? department expended in the fiscal
year 1S02. $2.354. S0O.55. and cut of that sum
the total amount expended in seintific re
searches was 45.6 per cent. I5ut in the
year ending June 30. 101, out of a total ex
penditure of $1.945.9S'.3'. the department
applied 51.8 per cent, of that sum to scien
tific work and investigation. It is. there
fore, very phirdy observable that the
economics which have be-'n practiced in th-1
administration of the department have not
been at the expense of scientific research.
Document jinil SeedN.
The recommendation contained in the re
port of the secretary for 1S93, that the
vicious system of promiscu ous free distri
bution cf its lYp.artmontal documents be
abandoned, is again urged. Those publica
tions may well be furnished without cost to
public libraries, educational institutions ar.d
the officers and Iihrarii3 of states ana of
the federal Roycrnr.icnt. Hut from all in
dividuals applying for th'm. a price cover
ing the cost of the document asked for,
should b? required. Thin the publications
and documents would b se -ure 1 by those
who really desire them f or proper purposes.
Half a million of c: pies of the report i f the
secretary of agriculture are pritt-"d f r dis
tribution at an annual co.st of about $300.000.
Large numbers of toem are cumbering core
rooms at the capitol. anl the shelve.-! of second-hand
book stores throughout the coun
try. AH this labor and waste might be
avoided if the recommendations of th3 sec
retary were adopted.
The secretary also again recommends that
the gratuitous distribution of seeds cease,
and that no money be appropriated for that
purpose, except to expetinoent stations. He
reiterates tho reasons givn in his rep rt for
lS:i3. discontinuing this unjustifiabl?
gratuity, and I fully concur in tho conclu
sions which he had reached.
A further important ptility In agricult
ural statistics Is found la their rlucidation
of the relation of the supply of farm prod
ucts ta the demand for them in the mar
kets of the Urd'.ed Stit?3 and of the
world.
It Is deemed possible that an agricult
ural census may be taxen each year
through the agent3 of th? statistical divi
sion of the department. Such a course is
commended for trial by the chief of that
division. Its scope would be; (1) The area
undfr each of the mora important crops.
(2) Tha aggregate products of eacla of -uch
crops. (3) The ouaotity of wheat and corn
In the hands of farmers at a data after th
spring sowing and plantings and before
the beginning of harvest t and also the
quantity of cotton and tobicca remaining
in the hand3 of planters either at the sama
dite or at some other designated time. The
cost of the work is estimated at J500.0O0.
Owing to the peculiar feilty of ,the
statistician's work and the nitural and ac
quired fitness necessary to it 3 successful
prosecution, the secretary of agriculture
expresses the opinion that every person em
ployed in gathering statistics, under th?
chief of that division, should be admitted
to that service only after a thorough, ex
haustive and successful examinithn at the
hands of th? United Stites civil service
commission. This has led him to call for
euch examination of cindidato3 for the
position of assistant statisticians, and al3a
of candidates for chiefs of sections in that
division.
Th? work done by the department of ag
riculture is very superficially dealt with
In this communication, and I commend the
report of the secretary and the very im
portant interests with which It deals, to
the careful attention of the congress.

SpeuUn a Oootl AVord for Civil Service
Iteform.
The advantages to the public service of
an adherence to the principles of civil serv
ice reform are constantly more apparent;
and nothing is so encouraging to those in
official life who honestly desire pood gov
ernment as the increasing appreciation by
our people of those advantages. A vast ma
jority of the voters of the land are ready
to insist that the time and attention of those
they select to perform for them important
public duties, should not be distracted by
doling out minor offices and they are grow
ing to be unanimous in regarding party or
ganization as something that should be used
in establishing party principles, instead of
dictating the distribution of public places as
rewards of. partisan activity.
Numerous additional offices and places
have lately been brought within civil service
rules and regulations, and some other3 will
probably soon be included.
The report of the commissioners will b?
suhmitted to congress, and I invite care
ful attention to the recommendations it con
tains. I am entirely convinced that we ought
not to be longer without a national board
of health, or a national health officer
charged with no other duties than such as
pertain to the protection of our country,
from the invasion of pestilence and disease.
This would involve the establishment by
such board or officer, of proper quarantine
precautions, or the necessary aid and coun
sel to locate authorities on the subject;
prompt advice and assistance to local boards
of health, or health officers in the suppres
sion of contagious disease, and in cases
where there are no such local boards or of
fieers the immediate direction by the na
tional board or officer of measures of sup
press m; constant and authentic information
concerning tho health of fore-ign countries,
and all parts of our own country as re
lated to contagious diseases; and considera
ti n of regulations to be enforced in foreign
ports to prevent the introduction of con
tagion into our cities, and the measures
which should be adopted to secure their en
f irecment. There seems to be at this time
a decided inclinati n to discuss measures of
protection against contagious diseases in in

Hy virtue of a statute of the United
States, passed in 1SSR, I appointed, in
July last, the Hin. John I). Kernan of the
state of New York and the Hon. Nicholas
K. Worthington of Illinois to form, with
the Hon. Carroll I). Wright, commissioner
of labor, who was designated by said stat
ute, a commission for the purpose of
making careful inquiry into the causes of
the controversies between certain railroads
and their employes, which had resulted
in extensive and destructive strikes, ac
companied by much violence and danger
ous disturbance, with considerable loss
of life and great destruction of property.
The report of the commissioners has
been submitted to me, and will be trans
mi ttod to the congress with the evidence
taken upon their investigation. Their
work has been we'd done, and their
standing and intelligence give assurance
that the report and suggestions they
make are worthy of careful considera

The tariff act passed at the last session
of the congress needs important
amendments if it is to be executed
effectively and with certainty. In addi
tion to such necessary amendments as will
not change rates of duty, I am still very
decidedly in favor of putting coal and
Iron upon the free list. So fur as the sugar
schedule is concerned, I would be glad,
under existing aggravations, to see every
particle of differential duty in favor of re
lined sugar stricken out of our tariff law.
If, with all the favor now accorded the
sugar refining interest in our tariff laws, it
still languishes to the extent of closed re
fineries and thousands of discharged work
men, it would seem to present a hopeless
case for reasonable legislative aid.
Whatever else is done -or omitted, I
earnestly repat here the recommendation
I have made in another portion of this
communication, that the additional duty
of one-tenth of a cent a pound laid upon
sugar imported from countries paying a
bounty on its export be abrogated. It
PtemM to me that exceedingly important
considerations point to the propriety of
this amendment.
With the advent of a new tariff policy,
not only contemplated to relieve the con
sumers of our land in the cost of their
daily life, but to invite a better develop
ment of American thrift and create for us
elisor and more profitable commercial re
lations witl th? rest of the world, it fol
1 iws as a logical and imperative necessity
that w? should at once remove the chief
if not the only obstacle which has so long
prevented our participation in the foreign
carrying trade of the seas.
A "tariff built up on the theory that it
is well to cheek importo and that a home
market should bound the industry' and ef
fort of American producers, was fitly sup
plemented by a refusal to allow American
registry of vessels built abroad, thouga
owned and navigated by our people, thus
exhibiting a willingness to abandon all con
test for the advantages of American trans
oceanic carriig?. Our new tariff policy,
built upon th? theory that it is well to
encourage such importations as our peo
ple need, ani that our products and manu
factures should find mirkjts in every part
of the habitable globe, is consistently sup
pi ne.n ted by the greatest possible liberty
to our citizens in th? ownership and navi
gation of ships in which our products 3nd
manufacturers may be transported. The
Trillions now paid to foreigners for carry
ing American passengers and products
across the seas should b? turned Into
American hands. Ship building, which has
been protected to strangulation, rhould bo
revived by the prospect of profitable em
ployment for ships when built, and the
American sailor should be resurrected, ar.d
again take Ms place, a sturdy and indus
trious citizen ia time of peace, and a patri
otic and safe defender of American inter
ests in the day of conflict.
The ancient provision of our law deny
ing American registry to ships built abroad
and owned by Am?ricans appears in th?
light of present conditions, not only to be
a failure for good at every point, but to
be nearer a re'le of barbarism than any
thing that exists under the permission of
a statute of the United States. I earnestly
recommend its prompt repeal.
CARLISLK'S PLAX OF FIXAXCE.

During the last month the gold reserve
In the treasury for the purpose of redeem
ing the notes of the government, circulat
ing a3 money in the hands of the people,
became so reduced, and Its further deple
tion in the near future seemed so certain,
that la the exerclsi of proper care for the
1 A
public welfare, It became necessary to re
plenish this reserve, and thus maintain
popular faith in the ability and determina
tion of the government to meet, as agreed,
its pecuniary Obligation. It would have
been well if in this emergency authority
had existed to Issue the bonds of the gov
ernment bearing a low rate of interest and
maturing within a special period, but th?
congress having failed to confer such au
thority, resort was necessarily had to the
resumption act of 1875. and pursuant to
its provisions, bonds were issued drawing
interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per an
num and maturing ten years after their
issuance, that being the shortest time au
thorized by the act. I am glad to say,
however, that in the sale of these bonds
the premium received operated t reduce
the rate of interest to be paid by the gov
ernment to less than 3 per cent.
Nothing could b? worse or further re
moved from sensible finance than the re
lations existing between the currency the
government has issued, the gold held for
its redemption, and the means which
must be resorted to for the purpose of re
plenishing such redemption fund when
impaired. Even if the claims upon this
fund wce confined to the obligations
originally intended, and if the redemp
tion of these obligations meant their can
cellation the fund would be very small.
But these obligations, when received and
redeemed in gold, are not canceled, but
are reissued, and may do duty many times
by way of drawing gold from the treas
ury. Thus we have an endless chain in
operation constantly depleting the treas
ury's goid and never near a final rest. As
If this was not bad enough, we have by
a statutory declaration that It Is the
policy of the government to maintain the
parity between gold and silver, aided the
force and momentum of this exhausting
procss. and added largely to the currency
obligations claiming this peculiar gvld
redemption. Our small gold reserve Is
thus subject to drain from every' side.
The demands that increase our danger
also Increase the necessity of protecting
this reserve against depletion, and It is
most unsatisfactory to know that the pro
tection afforded is only a temporary
palliation.
Don da.
It 19 perfectly and palpably plain that
the only way, under present conditions,
by which this reserve when dangerously
depleted can be replenished is through
the issue and sale of the Ixonds of the
government for gold; and yet congress
has not only thus far declined to author
ize the issue of txnds best suited to such
a purpose, but there seems a disposition
in some quarters to deny both the neces
sity and power for the Issue of bonds
at all. I can not foe a moment believe
that any of our citizens are deliberately
willing that their government should de
fault in It? pecuniary obligations, or that
its financial operations should be reduced
to a silver basis. At any rate I should
not feel that my duty was dons if I
omitted any effort I could make to avert
such a calamity. As long, therefore, as
no provision is made for the final re
demption, or the putting aside of the
currency obligation, now used to repeat
edly and constantly draw from the gov
ernment Its gold, and as long as no better
authority for bond Issues is allow d than
at present exists such authority will be
utilized whenever and as often as it be
comes necessary, to maintain a sufficient
gold reserve anil in abundant time to save
the credit of our country, and make good
the financial declarations of our govern
ment. Klnatirlt - of Currency.
Questions relating to our banks and cur
rency are closely connected with the sub
ject Just referred to and also present some
unsatisfactory features. Trominent among
them are the lack of elasticity in our cur

most needed In other parts of the country.
The absolute divorcement of the govern

Ideal relationship of the government to the
circulation of the currency" of the coun
try. This condition cannot be immediately
reached, but as a, step In that direction,
and as a means of securing a more elastic
currency and obviating other objections- to
the present arrangement of bank circular
tion. the secretary of the treasury presents
In his report a scheme modifying present
banking laws and providing for the issue
of circulating notes by state bank3 free
from taxation under certain limitations.
The secretary explains his plan so plainly
and Its advantages are developed by him
with such remarkable clearness that any
effort on my par: to present argument on
its support would be superfluous. I shall
therefore content myself with an unquali
fied indorsement of the secretary's pro
posed changes in the law and a brief and
imperfect mention of their prominent
features.
The Xevr I'lan.
It Is proposed to repeal all laws provid
ing for the deposit of United States bonds
as security for circulation; to permit na
tional banks to issue circulating notes not
exceeding in amount 75 per cent, of their
paid-up and unimpaired capital, provided
they deposit with the government as a
guarantee fund, in United States legal
tender notes, including treasury notes-of
1X90. a sum equal in amount to 30 per cent,
of the no.es they desire to issue, this de
posit to be maintained at all times, but
whenever any bank retires any part of it3
circulation a proportionate part of Its guar
antee fund shall be returned to it; to per
mit the secretary of the treasury to pre
pare and keep on hand ready for issue,
in ca an increase In circulation Is de
sired, blank nationil bank notes for each
bank having circulation, and to repeal the
provisions of the present law Imposing
limitations and restrictions upon banks
desiring to reducn or increase their cir
culation, thus permitting such increase or
reduction within the limit of 75 per cent,
of capital to be quickly made as emergen
cies arise.
In addition ta the guarantee fund re
ouired, it ds proposed to provide a safety
fund for th? immediate redemption of the
circulation notes of failed banks by im
posing a small annual tax. say one-hilf of
1 per cent., upoja the average circulation
of each bank until the fund amounts to 5
per cent, of the total circulation outstand
ing. When a bank fails, its guarantee
fund Is to bo paid into this safety fund,
and its notes are to be redeemed in the
first Instance from such safety fund thus
augmented, any impairment of sucli fund
caused thereby fa be made good from the
immediately available cash assets of said
bank, and if they should be insufficient,
such impairment to b? made good by a
pro rata assessment among the other
bank3, their contributions constituting a
first lien upon the assets of th? failed bank,
in favor of the contributing banks.
As a further security, it is contemplated
that the existing provision fixing the indi
vidual liability of stockholders Is to be re
tained, and the bank's indebtedness on ac
count of dts circulating notes is to be made
a first lien on all its assets. For the pur
pose of m?eting the expense of printing
notC3, official supervision, cancellation ana
other Ilk? charges th?ro shall be imposed
a tax of say one-half of 1 per cent, per an
num upon the averag? amount of notes
in circulation. It i3 furth?r provided that
there shall be no national bank notes is
sued of les3 denomination that $10; that
each national bank, except in ca3? of a
failc-d bank, shall redeem or retire its
noteä in the fir.st intance at its own office
or at agencies to be designated by It, and
that no fixed reserve used be maintained
on account of deposits.
State Itankn.
Another very important feature of this
plan is the exemption of state banks from
taxation by the United Slates in cases
where it Is shown to th? satisfaction of the
secretary of the treasury and comptroller
of the currency by banks claiming suca ex
emption, that they have not had outstand
ing their circulation notes exceeding 75 per
cent, of their paid-up and unimpaired cap
ital; that their stockholders are individual
ly liable for the redemption of their circu
lating notes to th? full extent of their own
ership in stock; that the liability of said
banks upon their circulation notes consti
tutes under their state law a first lien
upon their assets; that such banks have
kept and maintained a guarantee fund in
the United States legal tender notes, in
cluding treasury notes of 1S90, equal to 30
per cent, of their outstanding circulation
notes, and that such banks have promptly
redeemed their circulating notes when pre
sented at their principal' or branch offices.
It is quite likely that this scheme may
be usefully amended in some of its details.
but I am ratlsfled It furnishes a basis for
a very great improvement in our present
banking and currency system.
I conclude this communication, fully ap
preciating that the responsibility for all
legislation affecting the people of tha
United States rests upon their representa
tive3 In congress, and assuring them that
whether lr accordance with recommenda
tions I have mad? or not. I shall b? glad
to co-operate in perfecting any legislation
that tends to the prosperity and welfare of
our country. GKOVKlt CLEVELAND.

WASHINGTON. D. C. Dee. 3. Both
houses of congress met at high noon today.
Promptly at 12 o'clock Vice-President
Stevenson called the senate to order and
Chaplain Milbum in eKment terms offered
the opening prayer. He referred feeling
ly to the critical illness through which tha
daughter of the vice-president had safely
p.ussed. On motion of Mr. Hanson the
secretary of the senate was directed to
give the usual notice to the house of repre
sentatives that the senate wns now ready
to proceed to business. Mr. Harris offered
the customary resolution asking that a
committee be named for the notification
of the president that the senate was in
session and ready to receive such com
munications as he might wish to make. On
the adoption of the resolution the presiding
officer named Messrs. Harris an J Man
der.on as the committee.
Mr. Coekrell, chairman or the commit
tee on appropriations, offered a resolution
which wa3 adopted, providing that the
daily sessions of the senate tegin at 12
noon. The vice-president then directed a
roll-call, which developed the presence of
sixty-six senators, considerably more than
a quorum. The senate then took a recess
until 12:30 p. m. Flowers were to be seen
on the desks of many senators.
At 1:30 Executive Clerk Prüden immedi
ately appeared at the main door and thr
white-haired Isaac Hassett of the senate
stjiff announced "Message from the presi
dent." A large document was carried to
the vice-president, who directed that the
message be read. Most of the senators
paid dose attention to the reading. Thera
was special attention ta the reference to
the Chinese-Japanese war. It was the first
official information known even to mem
bers of the foreign committee. It wns
r.uieh briefer, however, than had been ex
pected and left still open the exact details
of the negotiations. Shortly before the
reference to China-Japan was reached
the Chinese minister, attended by Mr.
Chung, an attache, entered the gallery
reserved for the diplomntic corps and were
interested listeners to the foreign features
of the message.
The reading of the massage closed at
3:40 o'clock, having taken Jast two hours
and ten minutes.
Mr. Turpie offered a resolution reciting
that the time had now come for the elec
tion of United States senators by direct
vote of the people. Mr. Turpie announced
that on Friday next he would submit some
remarks on the resolution and in the mean
time the resolution went over.
Mr. Lodge offered a resolution calling on
the secretary of state for particulars con
cerning the execution of two Jaixine.-w stu
dents by the Chinese authorities at Shang
hai when the students had been given the
protection of the United States. At tha
request of Mr. Gorman the resolution went
over under the rules until tomorrow.
Mr. Ttlanchard presented a resolution
protesting against the recent Turkish
atrocities against Armenians and directing
that! the remonstrance of this government
be communicated to Turkey. The resolu
tion went to the committee on foreign rela
tions. Mr. Dolph presented a memorial from th?
commercial organization of Portland, Ore.,
favoring the Nicaragua canal. Mr. Dolph
briefiy urged the importance of the Im
pending measures for prosecuting the ca
nal. Mr. Peffer offered two resolutions. The
first directs the judiciary committee of the
senate to investigate the circumstances and
legal authority under which the secretary
of the treasury made the last two Issues
of bonds. The second resolution calls on
the president for information concerning
the circumstances ana necessity for send
ing United States troops to Chicago during
the pendency of the Pullman strike. Both
resolutions went over under the rules.
Mr. Call offered a resolution for the ap
pointment of a special committee to in
quire as to what extent the Louisiana lot
tery, or Honduras lottery, was operating In
Florida: whether either of th?m had sought
to control state or national elections;
whether money had not been expended by
them In the recent elections of members
of congress and whether they did not own
or subsidize newspapers In Florida. The
resolution went over.
The annual report of the government di
rectors of the Union Pacific railroad was
received from the secretary of the inte
rior. The secretary of the navy submitted a
reply to a senate resolution calling for the
relative number of American citizens and
aliens In the United States navy.
The annual reports of the various de

At 4 o'clock, on motion of Mr. Gorman,
the senate adjourned.

The opening of the short session in the
house was picturesque in a way, but de
void of interesting features. The victorious
republicans and the defeated democrats ex
changed greetings and gave and took
thrusts on the result of the recent political
battle with much animation, but through
good nature. The galleries were crowded
ar.d half the desks on the floor were smoth
ered with flowers. The leaders on both
sides got enthusiastic receptions from their
respective partisans, the appearance of
Speaker Crisp. ex-Speaker Reed. Mr. Wil
son and Mr. Burrows being the signal for
long and loul outbursts. There was no
chane? in the first day's proceedings for any
public reference to the election so that tha
actual proceedings were dull and uninter
esting. Seven rev members were sworn in
and after a long wait, the president's mes
sage was read. Although listened to at
tentively, it was concluded without a single
mark of approval or disapproval Th? death
of the late Representative Wright of Penn
sylvania was then announced, whereupon
the house, as a mark of respect. aJj lurned.
The roll-call developed the presence of 216
members, forty-seven more than a quorum.
The speaker announced the fact that sever
al members elected' to fill vacancies, oc
casioned by death or resignation, were pres
ent, and Georg? P. Harrison of Alabama,
John S. Little or Arkansas. William L.
Henry, Charles K. Ooffln and William L..
Liir of Maryland, Willi am M. r.eckner of
Kentucky. J. H. llromwcll of Ohio and
Michael Griffin were escorted to the bar
of the house and sworn in. The speaker
announced the resignation of Amos J. Cum
min gs cf New York, who resigned to accept
an appointment as sub-way commissioner
of New York City.
Upon motion of Mr. Wilson a committee,
consisting of himself, Mr. Holman and Mr.
Iteei. was appoimed to join a similar com
mittee from the senate and inform the presi
dent that a fluorum cf both houses was
present and congress was ready to receive
any communication Jie desired to make.
Several other resolutions, fixing the hour of
m eting, etc.. were adopted and at 12:30 the
hiuse took a recess to await the president's
mtsage.
At 1:35 Mr. Pruden. the president's ex
ecu live clerk, appearrd vi:h the message,
which, by the direction of the speaker, was
read by th? clerk of the house, Mr. Kerr.
The reading of the message occupied an
hour ar.d forty-five minutes. It was lis
tened to with careful attention, hut there
was no demonstration when it was con
cluded. Several routine reports were pre
sent!, after which Mr. Serant n announced
the death of P. Wright, late representative
from the Fifteenth district of Pennsylvania.
The usual resolutions were presented and
adopted, and then, as a further mark cf
respect, the house, at 3:20 p. m.. adjourned
until tomorrow at 12 o'clock.
