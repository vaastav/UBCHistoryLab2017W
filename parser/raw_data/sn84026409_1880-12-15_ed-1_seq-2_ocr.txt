Tin: Commissioner of Internal
Revenue in his annual report shows
that the government can raise suffi
cient revenue without the tax on
bank-chock, matches patent medi
cines, bank deposits and bank capi
tal, and he recommends the repeal of
the tax collected from these sources.
He says that sufficient revenue can
lc raised from the taxes on spirits,
malt liquors and tobacco. The taxes
promised to be aholihed on the
alKiyc articles amounts to $11,000,000
jht annum, and the fact that the
burdens of the peoj Je can be light
ened this much, shows not only the
prosjxrous condition of the country,

We lay liefore our readers in this
issue the last annual Message of
President Hayes. It is very long,
but it will well repay perusal, and
in its general scope and exhibit of
the a flairs of the Nation will doubt
less prove eminently satisfactory.
Publishing as we do almost the en
tire text of it, extended comment is
uncalled for. Each reader can and
will make up his own judgment, and
we doubt not that judgment w ill be
most favorable to its author. To all
sve most heartily commend it.
It is reported from Washington
that some of the leading Democrats
in the House are dickering with the
Oreenbackers with a view of captur
ing the organization of the next
House. It is said they offer to sup
port a Greenback Congressman Mr.
Padd of Maine for Speaker. It can
not be done, and the proposition
only shows to what a depth the
Democratic party has fallen, when
its leaders propose to make it the
tail of a half dozen Greenhackers.
Congressm an IIckd of Ohio, who
is an out-and out Democratic free
trader, and belieses in the doctrine
of "a tariff for revenue only," has
introduced a series of resolutions in
the House denouncing our present
protective system, and is mercilessly
whipping his Democratic colleagues
into line against protection. With
Watterson of the Louisville Courier
Journ,d and other Bourbon Demo
crats, he believes that true Dem
ocracy means free trade, and is de
termined to make his party toe the
mark. Mr. Speaker llandall and
other professed protectionists in the
party, will have to do some tall
dodging and squirming in their at
tempts to serve two masters. The
result of the late flections is not
very encouraging to Northern Dem-
oceats who ha-c the wit to under
stand the drift of public sentiment,
on the question of protection to
home industry.
The electoral college of Georgia
assembled last week, and of course
cast the vote of the State for Han
cock and English. As the law S3ys
the electors shall assemble and vote
on the first Wednesday of Deccm
lr, they cannot therefore legally
vote on any other day, and having
failed to vote on the day fixed by
lasv, their subsequent action amounts
to nothing, and the vote of the Stite
is lost. As well might Somerset
County have refused to observe the
Stite law, and held her election on
the Third Tuesday of November,
and then demanded that her vote be
counted. Georgia having clearly for
feited her right to have her vote count
ed, we insist that there is no posver
existing anywhere that can now
authorize or legalize its being count
ed. To cour.t it is to violate a plain
provision both of the Constitution
and of the law, and it is no excuse
to say that this thing has been done
before, or that it can make no differ
ence as to the general result. To do
so is not only adding strength to a
bad precedent, but is a most fla
grant violation of the law that can
not be justified, and we trust that
no sentimentalism will induce Re
publicans to countenance the effort
that will le made in that direction
Those who thought that the re
sult of the late election had taught
the Democrats a lesson were badly
mistaken. Your regular Bourbon
Democrat is as thoroughly incapa
ble of learning anything new, an is an
old dog of being taught new tricks.
Inste-ad of the present short session
of Congress being strictly devoted to
the transaction of necessary busi
ness as was hoped by the country,
the Demexrats have forced a pro
tracted debate, which has already
wastctl three days, over a proposed
new rule for counting the electoral
vote. If there was any dispute like
ly to arise os-er the counting of the
the vote cast last month, 'there
might be a necessity for speed
ily adjusting the manner of the
--j- s - -
nt, but as the election of the Re-
dican candidates is admitted
cou
publ
without the slightest cavil, and four
years must elapse before the ques
tion can again arise, it might well
and me t properly be deferred to a
more fitting season. The time hon
ored custom from the organization
of the government to the election of
Mr. Lincoln, was for the two House
to meet in joint convention, each
House h -letting a teller who summ-1
eel up ami delivered the result to the!
Vice President, whe. thereupon do-'
dared it to the nwmhleel Consw."
Now the Democrat want to in-'
troduce a now method of deehmni::
but to Bay the least
tlie introduc-
tionof it at this time when no dia-1
piste h to-the result" of the late elec-
tion is made, and the attempt to
force it through under the gap of the '
previous question, looks more than ;
