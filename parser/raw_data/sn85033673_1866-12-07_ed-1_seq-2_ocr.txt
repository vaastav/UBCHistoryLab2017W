CONGRESS.
The second session of tho so-called
Congress of the United States is now
sitting in Washington. When it is stated,
says the descent, that this is the same
body which passed eight. months of the
last year in the effort to devise ingenious
expedients for stimulating the vindictive
passions of one section, and for inflicting
oppression on another section, specula
tion as to its course for the nest three
months becomes entirely superfluous.
Those are said to be bjessed who expect
nothing; and it is precisely in this happy
relation that the South stands towards
the United States Congress. We shall
probably witness a renewal of the exper
iments by which the Radical majority
hope to terrify the Southern people into
such an acquiescent condition as will
insure the supremacy of the Republican
nartv: we shall have all sorts of
tluns and devices for doing eve
rything except restoring the Union
on a basis of justice and equal rights;
we shall read, if we have the patience
to read them, interminable discourses
on liberty and equality, illustrated by
proposals of general disfranchisement
and sweeping confiscation ; we shall be
bored to death with endless plutitudes
about the duty of establishing "manhood
suffrage," as a natural right, and demon
strationB of the still higher duty of not
letting "rebels" vote at all ; but we shall
have nothing in the way of sensible prac
tical legislation; nothing for tbe pur
pose of restoring the integrity o.f that
Union for which three thousand million
dollars were squandered and a half mil
lion of lives sacrificed. It does not ap
pear then that the assembling of Congress
can be an event franght with much of in
terest for us. To be sure it may do much
evil. Of this we have already bad ample'
proof. The body which iuflicted the
Freedmen's Bureau on the industry
of the country, which passed the absurd
but tyrannical and pernicious civil rights
bill, and which invented the cotton tax
is capable of doing almost any act of
malicious folly. But it is hard to see bow
more of this sort of thing can be accom
plished. The ingenuity of vindictiveness
may contrive further irritations and an
noyances; but as we are powerless to
resist them in any way whatever, we can
do little better than wait for the devel
opment of the Radical programme. In
the meantime it is gratifying to know
this year at least there will be no South
ern Representatives and Senators be
seeching admission to a legislative hall
in which their part in the performance
would bo restricted to an ineffectual
protest against injustice, or to an im
plied acquiescence in oppression. In
fact it is much better for the South to
remain apart from contentions in
which she can be nothing else than the
sport of rival theories or the victim of
competing oppressions.
WEDDINGS.
Perhaps never before has the matrimo
nial excitement run so high in the social
circles of Memphis as fet present. Day
by day we are called upon to record the
marriage of some of tbe most beautiful
of our ladies. During the four long years
that grim visaged war held sway matri
mony had partially ceased in this city,
but now it seems to have returned with
increased fury. We like this, as it ex
hibits an appreciation of the sublime and
beautiful which characterizes every re
fined people. Nothing so purifies a man's
moral nature .as the admonitions of
a pure, sensible woman nothing so
stimulates him to fight life's great
battle with renewed energy and
vigor as the encouraging eoiilii
of her who is sharing his joys and
dividing his sorrows. It was hut two
evenings since, at Greenwood, that we
witnessed one of the most magnificent
of weddings. Tbe bride, arrayed in pure
white, crowned with orange wreath, and
with long flowing veil, was a perfeet
angel of light, surrounded by her attend
ant bridesmaids, representing in their
Urrss all tbe colors of the rainbow,
seemed like fairies in the dreamland of
enchantment. , Scarcely have we ever
witnessed such a beautiful scene, and it
made our bachelor heart, seared ai it is
by the rude shock of broken vows, leap
with rejoicings.
PREPARATIONS IH IRELAND.
It is announced, says the Dublin cor
respondent of the Loadon Timet, that
the executive in Ireland is quietly pre
paring for any attempt which may possi
bly be made in Ireland by tbe Fenians
during the present winter. Some of the
military barracks are being put in a state
of defense, while the metropolitan police
are being carefully drilled in the use of
cutlass and revolver, as the body most
likely to be called on, in the event of a
Fenian disturbance, to cope more imme
diately with it. To be fore-armed is,
undoubtedly.as good as to be forewarned.
At the same time, those who have good
opportunities of judging the matter,
aswrt that there need not be the slightest
apprehension of a "rising," the banuh
ment of leaJVrs, the rapid retreat of
otliirs. and a long spring and summer
incarceration of other conspirators under
the power of the suspension act, convey
ing scvoro lessons to the idle and disaf
fected spirits who, through indolence,
discontent and indulgence in liquor, are
ever ready in every country to join in
such hopeless schemes as the , Fenian
one. .
THE MANNER OF WEARING SHAWLS
The ladies have adopted what is cnlle
the Arabian stvle of wearing thei
shawls. A portion of the article is draw
into a pouch between-the shoulders.iike
the contrivance whereby a squaw was
habituated to carry her juvenile offspring.
It looks as if it were thrown on with
pitchfork. To conform to the same taste
displayed in wearing the shawl, tbe gen
tlemen should gather the skirls of the
coats and fasten them with a bodkin to
tha waistband of their cants. But the
ladies know their swsy is so despotic
that the most ridiculous absurdity
costume they can assume will not d
miniah their nower. and they seem to
ilnnt tlioan oddities to exemplify the
fact
SIGNIFICANT.
The Nashville Banner of the 27th con
tains the following paragraph : "A col
ored man of intelligence and education
and whose influence among the freedme
is widely recognized, called at our oflice
yesterday, and, in the course of conver
sation, expressed his belief that, in case
any law be passed by the present Legjs
lature, discriminating against the mass
of the white citizens of Tennessee,
favor of the blacks, as regards the matter
of suffrage, the colored vote would be
almost universally given in favor of can
didates advocating the removal of the re
strictions imposed by tho present Fran
chise law. We believe him." ,
THE PRESIDENT.
Statements made by a number of the
leading representative men of both the
Republican and Democratic parties, tend
to confirm the few intimations that have
leaked out from the recent consultations
at the White House, that the President
is on the eve of a grand coup d'etat that
will gratify his friends and bewilder his
enemies. It is safe to conclude, at the
very least, that there is an earnest desire
on both sides to settle apon some feasible
plan of securing harmonious action be
tween Congress and the Executive in the
future.
THE 80UTHEBH STATES.
Nearly all (he Southern State Legisla
tures have met and received messages
from their respective Governors. These
documents universally speak of a gloomy
condition of affairs; of an impoverished
people ; of a lack of food in many sec
tions ; of impending destitution ; of a
scarcity of labor, agricultural imple
ments and money; of people emigrating
to the North, and of hostility to th
Northern section of the country, which
taken altogether, are as mournful a set
of public documents as we have perused
for many a day. .
THE TABIFF.
It is well known that the bill muking
a considerable increase in the duties on
imports, which passed the House of Rep
resentatives at the last session, is now
pending in the Senate. It is also an
nounced that another lanu bill, pre
pared by David A. Wells, Revenue Com
missioner, will be submitted to Congress
with the annual report of the Secretary
of the Treasury. The latter, it is be
lieved, will also provide for considerable
reduction in the internal duties, besides
great changes in tho tariff duties on
mparts. , .
THE MUD! THE MUD!
The streets of Memphis to-day, and
have been for several days, almost im
passable. No other city, surely, is so
afflicted with mud. Where are our new
Mayor and Aldermen, and the reforms
they were to introduce in the manage
ment of the city's affairs T Where is the
chain gang, that the crossings of the
streets cau't be kept passable T As it is,
locomotion is almost out of tbe question,
We sigh once more fur a beautiful sun
shiny day such as makest the heurt
glad.
TBADE 021 THE MISSISSIPPI.
The New Orleans journals are highly
delighted at being able to record that
trade is beginning Is return to the chan
nels in use before the war. They state
that large quantities of flour and produce
are once more comit.g down tbe Missis
sippi on their way to the Atlantic Stales.
THE PRESS ON THE MESSAGE.
Nkw Yoke, Dec. 4. Tie World, com!
muuting on tbe message, says tbe 1 real
dent adheres to bis lunner views with
resolute, indomitable steadiness, hut,
with the calmness of conscious strength,
he refrains from discussing or suggesting
any new conditions of the admission ol
the Southern members because be recog
nizes no authority on the part of Con
gress to impose any. Both the tone and
the arguments Of the message on the
leading topics arc excellent.
On the other hand the Tribune says:
It has no heart to dwelt en this dreary,
lifeless document. There is nothing
that any loyal man can read with com
fort or hope. Andrew Johnson is as
much an enemy as when he menaced
the nation from tbe White II oust ten
months ago. The duty devolved upon
Congress now becomes more solemn and
responsible, and we look to Congress
with infinite yearning
The Herald thinks the message an ar
gument to tbe court after the jury bad
rendered their verdict. The President
talks of the ancient landmarks as if noue
of them had been swept away by tbe lute
Southern deluge ot fire and blood, as if
the war had changed nothing, arid as if
the recent elections had dcidi'd nothing.
The Timet finds cause fur regret that
the President has neither modified his
views nor give any indication of a readi
ness to concede aught of principle or
policy to tbe demands of the governing
Stales and Congress.

. Washington, Dec. 6. Mexican cor
respondence communicated to Congress,
reveals the true condition of our forces.
Of the Mexican complication, on August
16th, Mr. Seward says to Monthalon :
"The President thinks it' proper that
the Emperor of France should be in
formed that tho assumption of adminis
trative functions at this time by Gen.
Osmont and Mr.' Frious, under1 the
authority of the Prince Maximilian, is
not unlikely to be injurious to the good
relations between the United States and
France." On the 17th of August, Mr.
Hoys says to Mr. Seward: "I callod
yesterday upon tbe Minister of Foreign
Affairs, and spoke to him of the report
that Maximilian s stay in Mexico had
become conditional on a modification of
the course of action in the French Gov
ernment, as agreed on with the United
States." He replied that "there bad
been no modification, and there is to be
none. What we announced as our in
tention to do we will do."
October 8. Seward to Bigelow : " A
disposition on the part of the Emperor
to depart from his engagement, has un
avoidably produced a wide popular dis
trust of tbe Emperor's sincerilv in
making engagements, and of his good
faith in fulfilling them. We are waiting
for the beginning of the evacuation."
OctoSer" 12. Bigelow to Seward:
"The Marquis de Monstcer received the
diplomatic body yesterday for the first
time. He asked if it was true, as
reported in the journals, that our official
relations were soon to terminate, ex
pressed his regrets to learn that it was,
and it was his desire to have co-operated
with me in cultivating friendly relations
between our respective countries."
October 20. Seward, to Campbell,
announces confidence on the part of the
President of Napoleon's sincerity, and
that the evacuation would commence in
November and soon bo completed..
Campbell is urged to be in the vicinity
during the evacuation, and is instructed
to recognize officially only Juarez.
Desire of conquest, or purchase of any
part of Mexico, is disavowed.
October 26. President to Stanton, re
quests that General Grant accompany
Campbell
October 30. Grant finding himself
uoable to go, Sherman is substituted. -
November 8. Bigelow to Seward:
"The Minister of Foreign Affairs an
nounces Napoleon's determination to
postpone the evacuation till spring The
Emperor stated that the postponement
was merely and purely military, as tbe
reduction of force would render those left
in peril. Tbe Emperor admits having
advised Maximilian's abdication."
November 9. Seward to Bigelow, an
nounces the departure of Campbell and
Sherman on the following day fur Mex
ico or its vicinity.
November 23. Seward to Bigelow, is
instructed to inform the French Minister
that a change of programme is inconve
nient and exceptionable. "We cannot
acquiesce; first, because next spring is
too indefinite; second, because we have
no authority for stating to Congress and
the American people that we have better
guarantee for the withdrawal of the whole
expeditionary force in the spring than
we bad for the withdrawal of part of the
number in November; third, in full reli
ance upon at least a literal performance
of the Emperor s existing agreement,
we have taken measures, while facili
tating the anticipated French evacuation
to co-operate with the Republican Gov
ernment of Mexico, for promoting the
pacification of that eountry, and for an
early and complete restoration of the
proper constitutional authority of that
Government, as a part of these measures.
Mr. Campbell, attended by Sherman,
has been sent to Mexico in order to con
fer with Juarez on subjects deeply in
teresting the United States, and of vital
mportance to Mexico. Our policy and
measures thus adopted, in full reliance
upon the anticipated beginning of the
evacuation, were promptly made known
to tbe French Legation here ; you have
doubtless made them known to the Em
peror's government ia Paris. The Em
peror will peccive we cannot recall
Campbell, nor modify the instructions un
der which he may now be treating with the
Republic of Mexico. That government
will of course earnestly desire and con
fidently expect early and entire discon
tinuation of foreign hostile occupation.
You wiil therefore state to the Emperor's
Government that the President sincerely
hopes and expects that the evacuation of
Mexico will be carried into effect with
due conformity to existing agreement as
the imperative complication which calls
for this dispatch shall allow. Campbell
wiil be advised of that complication.
Instructions will be issued to the United
States military force of observation to
await in every case special directions
from the President This will be done
ith the confident expectation that the
telegraph or mail will reasonably bring
as a satisfactory answer.
The Emperor in reply to this note as
sures the French Government that the
United States, while they seek the relief
of Mexico, deaires'nothing more earn-
stly than to preserve peace and friend
ship with France, nor does the President
How himself to doubt that what has
been determined ia France, moet unsus
piciously as we think, has been decided
pon inadrerUntly, without full reflection
on the embarrassment it must produce
here, and without any design to retain
the French expeditionary forces beyoud
the full period of eighteen mouths orji-
nolfy stipulated for the complete evacua
tion. , '

At the regular meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce this afternoon, a memo
rial was read praying Congress to abolish
the export duty on cotton. Figures were
given to show tho relative production of
cotton here and in Europe, and not only
control of the European market is un
approachable, but that American cotton
is likely to become more and more insig
nificant in that market, unless the ex
portation of the staple is perfectly free

from this tax might reach $20,000,000

What Shall We So?
" What shall we do ?" is the caption of
a very sensible editorial in a late num

the condition of the South, our Texas
cotemporary answers bis own interroga
tion by venturing to suggest that we
keep quiet, peaceable and orderly, obey
ing the laws and constituted authori
ties. Be sober, .industrious and frugal,
and endeavor to cultivate a cheerful dis
position, thinking as little of past sor
rows as possible. Strive to adapt our
selves to onr new situation and circum
stances. Be kind and just to the freed
men, and convice them that we are their
best friends. Let us show to the world
what we can do, under the pressuro of
calamities, which might have utterly
overcome a less noble people. Are our
lortunes gone, our lands laid waste, our
dwellings in ruins, onr families thinned
by battle and disease r Let us, in the
language of Scripture, throw off the
sackcloth and ashes, gird up our loins,
and begin anew gather up and consol

Aa Error in Harrises.
Almost any error in life may be reme
died save an error in marriage. If a
man mistakes in one thing, he can rec
tify it by doing right in another; if one
mine be unproductive, or one field bar
ren he can try for gold in some fresh
direction it is competent for him to
turn up the sods of different acres, and
plant and reap there; but to find yon
have chosen wrongly in marriage, is
when a man discovers just as his sun is
close upon setting, that he has erred
through Inc. I here is no retracing
either road, there is no getting rid either
of the spent existence or of the lawful
wife ; the day is gone, the die is cast, the
decision made beyond recall; and un
happy indeed is ho who finds he has
taken the wrong turning.
The Condition of the South.
Northern creditors of Soutbern.debtors,
if we can believe what the latter say,
have treated them with much greater
generosity than creditors in their own
neighborhood. General Reuben Davis,
in a recent address at Aberdeen. Missis
sippi, said, " The Yankees show a liber
ality towards our people which should
put our local creditors to shame." The
Examiner, published at Aberdeen, in
dorses this sentiment, and so docs the
Memphis Avalanche, which says, " We
are glad to be able to heartily indorse
Gen. Davis in this statement" Southern
people who think tbe North harsh and
unkind will at least admit that in money
matters tbey are not so.
Golden Opportunities.
How lamentable that we should go
through tbe world so misunderstanding
one another, letting slip golden opportu
nities for glimpses into men's better na
ture, which might have knit our hearts
to theirs in a brotherhood of love, and
drawn the veil of charity over faults
which, in our blindness, seemed to ns
without a virtue to balance there. Angels
turn sorrowing away from this soul's
blindness of ours, and fiends laugh over
the final fall of despair which our helping
hand might at such moments have
averted. Well for us all it is that. He
who is Himself without sin, more merci
ful than man, "sees gathering tears in
eyes that we deem hard and dry.

WILSON HARVEY.
New York. April 7,105. 27 Pitt Street.
Tbe following is an interesting oase of a man
employed in an Iron Foundry, who, in pouring
melted iron into a Uask that was damp and wet
caused an explosion. The welted iron was
thrown around and on him in a perfect .bower,
and he was burnt dreadfully. The following
certificate was given to me by him about eight
weeks after the accident:
Nkw York. Jan. 11, l.SOfl.
My name is Jacob Hardy ; I am an iron foun
der; I was badly burnt by not iron in November
last; toy burns healed but I had a running sore
on my leg that would not beat; I tried Mageiel's
Salve, and it cured m in a few weeks. This is
all true, and any body can now see me at Jack
son's Iron Works, Second Avenue.
