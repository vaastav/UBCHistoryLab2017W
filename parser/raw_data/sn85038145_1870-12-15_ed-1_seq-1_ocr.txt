THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and
, House of llejiresentalives ;
A year of peace and general pros
perity to the nation lias passed
sincd the Inst assembling of Con
gress. We have, through a kind
Providence, been blessed with
abundant crops, and have been
spared from complications and war
with loreign nations. In bur own
midst comparative harmony has
been restored. ,
RECONSTRUCTION.
It is to bo regretted, however,
that a free exercise of the elective
franchise has, by violence and in
timidation, been denied to citizens
in exceptional cases, and that in
several of the States lately in rebel
lion the verdict of the people lias
been thereby reversed. Tho States
of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas
hove been restored to representa
tion in our national councils. Geor
gia, the only State now without rep
resentation, may confidently be ex
pected to take her place also, at the
beginning of the new year, and
then, let us hope, will be completed
the work of reconstruction.
THE WAR IN EL'KOPB.
Soon after the existing war was
commenced in Europe, the protec
tion of the United States Minister
in Paris, was invoked in favor of
the North Germans domiciled in
French territory, and instructions
were issued to grant tho protection.
This has been followed by the ex
tension of American protection to
citizens ofSaxony, Hesse, Saxe
Coburg, Gotha, Colombia, Portugal
and Uruguay, the Dominican Re
public, Eqnador, Chili, - Paraguay,
and Venezuela, in Paris.
The charge was an onerous one,
requiring constant and severe la
bor as well as the exercise of pa
tience, prudence and good judg
ment. It lias been performed to
the entire satisfication of the Gov
ernment, and, as I am olflcially in
formed, equally so to the Govern
ment of North Germany. 1
RECOGNITION OP THE FRENCH IlEPCU
LIC. As soon as I learned Hint a Re
public had been proclaimed at Par
is, and that the people of France
had acquiesced in the change, the
Minister of the. United States was
directed by telegraph to recognize
it, and tender my congratulations
and those of the people of the Unit
ed States. The rc-establishment
in France of a system of Govern
ment disconnected with the dynas
tic traditions of Europe, appeared
to be a proper subject for the felic
itations of Americans. Should tho
present struggle result in attaching
the hearts of the I rench to our
simpler form of representative gov
ernment, it will be a subject of still
further satisfaction t our people.
Whilo we make no efforts to im
pose our institutions upon the in
habitants of other countries, and
while we adhere to our traditional
neutrality in civil contests else
where, we cannot be indifferent to
the spread of American political
ideas in a great and highly civilized
country like France.
Wo were asked by the new Gov
ernment to tiso our good offices
jointly with those of European'
powers, in the interest of peace.
The an.-wer was made that the es
tablished policies and the true iu
'erests of the - United States for
bade their interference in Euro
pean questions, jointly with Euro
pean powers. I ascertained inform
ally and unofficially, that the Gov
ernment of North Germany was
not then disposed to listen to such
representation from any powers.
Although earnestly wishing to see
the blessings of peaea restored to
the belligerents, with all of whom
the United States are on terms of
friendship I declined, on tho part
of the Government, to taue a step
which could only result in injury to
our true interests, without advanc
ing the object for which our inter
ve"ition was invited. Should the
time come when the action of the
United States can hasten the return
of peace by a single hour, that ac
tion will be heartily taken.. ,'
OUR NEUTRALITY. "'' ' a
I deemed it prudent, in view of
the number of persons ot Uerman
and French birth living in the Uni
ted States, to issue, soon after of
ficial notice of tho war had been
received from both belligerents, a
proclamation defining the duties of
the United States as a nentrai ana
the obligations of persons residing
within tho territory to observe their
laws and the laws of nations. 1 he
proclamation was followed bjl oth
ers, as circumstances seemed to dd
niand them. The people, thus ac
quainted in advaiice of their duties
and obligations, liave assisted in
preventing the violations of the
neutrality of the United States.
THE WAR IN CUBA. . if
It is not understood' that the
condition of tho insurrection in
Pnim hn mflteriallv chanced since
the close of the last session of Con
gress. In an early stnge or the
contest the authorities of Spain in
augurated a system of arbitrary ar
VVASlilNGTQN, FAYETTE CO., O., THURSDAY, DEC. 15, 1S70.
rests, of close confinement, of mil
itary trial and execution of persons
suspected of complicity with the in
surgents, and the summary embar
go of their properties: and seques
tration of their revenues by execu
tive warrant. Such proceedings, as
far as they affected the persons or
property of citizens of the United
States were in violation 'Of . the
proviion of the treaty of 1 7J5 be
tween the United States and Spain.
Representations of injuries result
ing to' several persons claiming to
bo citizens of the United States, by
reason of such violations, were
made to the Spanish Government,
from April, 1 009, to June last. The
Spanish Minister at asliington
had been clothed with a limited
power to aid in redressing such
wrongs. That power was found to
be withdrawn, in view, as it was
said, of the favorable situation in
which the Island of Cuba then was,
which, however, did not lead to the
revocation or the suspension of
the extiaord nary and arbitrary
functions exercised by the execu
tive power in Cuba, and we were
obliged to make our complaint at
Madrid.
ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS AGAINST
SPAIN,
In the negotiations thus opened
and still pending there, tho United
States only claimed that lor the fu
ture the rights secured to their cit
izens by treaty should be respect
ed in Cuba, and that as to the past,
a joint tribunal should be establish
ed in the United States, with full
jurisdiction over all such claims.
Belore such an impartial triliunai,
each claimant would be required to
prove his case. On the other hand,
Spain would be at liberty to trav
erse every material met, ami uius
complete equity would be done. A
case which at one timo threatened
seriously to affect the relations be
tween the United States and Spain,
has already been disposed of in
this way. The claim of the "Lloyd
Aspinwall" for the illegal seizure
and detention of that vessel was re
ferred to arbitration by mutual con
sent, and has: resulted, in an award
to the United States for the owners
of tho same, to.tho amount of $19
702. CO. '' ' 1 1
Another and long ponding claim
of like nature, that of the whale
ship Canada, has been disposed of
by friendly arbitration during the
present year. It was referred by the
joint commission of Brazil. and the
United States to the decision of Sir
Edward Thornton, Her , Britanic
Majesty's Minister to Washington,
who kindly, undertook the labori
ous task of examining the volumi
nous mass of correspondence and
testimony submitted by - the Gov
ernments, and awarded to the Unit
ed States tho amount of $100,740
09 in gold, which' bas' since been
paid by tho Imperial Government.
Th.ese recent examples show that
the mode Which the United States
have proposed to Spain for adjust
ing the pending claims, is just and
feasible, and that it may be agreed
to by either nation without dishon
or. ' It is to be hoped that this
moderate demand may be acceded
to without .delay. Should the pend
ing negotiations unfortunately and
iniexiiectedlv be without result, it
will then become my duty to corn
municato that fact to Congress and
invite action on tho subject.'
TUB SPANISH AMERICAN fACJIS CON
FERENCE.
Tho long deferred Peace Confer
ence between. Spain andjthe allied
South' Anietican' Republics, "has
been inaugurated in Washington,
und'.r the auspices of the United
States. Pursuant to the recom
mendations contained in a resolu
tion of the House of Representa
tives of the 17th of Dec, 18(S0, the
Executive Department of the Gov
ertment offered its friendly ofllces
for the promotion of .ponce and har
mony between Spain and the allied
Republics. Hesitations and obsta
cles occurred to the' acceptance of
tho offer, t Ultjimateb:,; .however, a
conference was arranged, and was
opened in this city' on the 29th of
October last at which I authorized
the Secretary uf State, to preside.
It was attended by the Ministers of
Spain, Peru,' 'Chilli nnd - Ecuador.
Id consequence of the absence of a
representative- from Bolivia, the
conference was adjourned until the
attendance." of a , plenipotentiary
from that Repulse could be secur
ed, or -otter measures could be
adopted toward compassing its ob
ject. The allied and other Repub
lics of Spanish origin on this conti
nent may see in this fact a new evi
dence ofiout .sincere .interest in
their welfare ; . our desire to see
them blessed with good Govern
ments capable of maintains order
and preserving their respective ter
ritorial integrity, aud ,of eur sin
cere wish to extend our . own com
mercial and social relations with
them. " The time is now probably
not far distant, when in the natural
course of events the European polit
ical connection with this continent
will cease. ' Our policy should be
shaped i lewf of this probability,
so as to ally the ' commercial inter
ests of the Spanish ,' American
States more closely to our own,

THE ACQUISTION OF SAN DOMINGO.
During the last session of Con
gress, a treaty for the annexation
of the Republic of San Domingo, to
the United States, failed to receive
the requisite two-thirds vote of the
Senate I was throughly convinced
then that the best interests of the
country, commercially and materi
ally, demanded its ratification,
r: i. l.. ..... :..

view. I now firmly believe that the
moment it is Known
. . . - . . . . .
ted States have entirely abandoned
the project of accepting as a part
of its territory, the Island of San
Domingo, the establishment of a
free port will be negotiated by Eu
ropean nations, in the Bay of Sama
na, and a largo commercial city
will spring up, to which .we will be
tributary without corresponding
benefits., The national folly of our
rejection is apparent. The Gov
ernment of Sail Domingo has vol
untarily sought this annexation. It
is a weak power, numbering proba
bly less than one hundred and
twenty thousand souls, and yet pos
sessing one of the richest territo
ries under the sun, capable of sup
porting a population of ten mil
lions of people in luxury. The
people of San Domingo are not
capable of maintaining themselves
in their present condition, and
must look for outside support.
They yearn for the protection of
our institutions ; our progress, and
our civilization. Shall we refuse
them '
The acquisition of San Domingo
is desirable because of its geo
graphical position. It commands
the entrance of the Carribean sea,
and the Isthmus transit of com
merce. It possesses the richast
soil, the best and moat capacious
harbors, and most salubrious cli
mato, and the most valuable pro
ducts of the forest, mine and sod,
of-any of the West India Islands.
Its possession by the United States
will, in a few years, build up a
coastwise commerce of immense
magiiiliulp?,;'.which will go far to-warUs-restoring
to us our merchant
marines. It will give us those r
ticles which wo consider of great
value, and do not produce; thus
equalizing our exports and imports.
In case ol foreign war it will give
us command of all the West India
Islands, and thus' prevent an ene
mv from again possessing himself
of a rendezvous upon our coast. At
present, our coast trade between
the States bordering upon tho At
lantic and those bordering- on tho
GulfofMcxiio is ly the Baha
mas and Antilles. Twice we must
as it were, pass through foreign
countries to get by sea from Geor
gia to tho east coast of Florida.
San Domingo with a stable gov
ernment, under which her immense
resources can lie developed, will
give reinui.erative wages to lens of
thousands of laborers not now up
on tho Island, This labor will take
advantage of every available means
of transportation to abandon the
adjacent islands and seek tho bless
ings of freedom and ;its sequence,
each' inhabitant receiving the re
wards of his own .labor. Porto
Rico and Cuba will have to abolish
Bla'oiy as a measure of self-prcscr-! States and Franco reached China ' nial authority known as the "Do
vation to retain their laborers. Ban snon after the massacre. It would : minion of Canada," and this semi-
Domiugo will become a large, con -
sumer of the: products of .JSorth-
farmers and manufacturers .. The
cheap rate at which her citizens
can be furnished with food, will
make it necessary that contiguous
islands should have the same ad
vantages, iff order to compete in
the production of sugar, coffee, lo
baccoj tropical fruits, &a. This
will open to us a wider market for
our products. The production in
San Domingo, chiefly of these ar
ticles, will cuttoif more than ono
hundred millions of our annual
imports; besides increasing our ex
ports. . With such a picture it is easy to
see how our largo debt abroad is
ultimately to be extinguished. With
a balance Of trade against ub, in
cluding interest on .bonus held by
foreigners, and the money ship
ments of our citizens' traveling in
foreign lailds, equal to the entire
yield of precious metalB iti this
country, it is not - so easy to see
how this result is to be Otherwise
accomplished; The acquisition of
San Domingo-is an adhesion to the
Monroe doctrine ; is a measure of
national'protcction ; it is an asser
tion of our just claim to a control
ling influence over the great com
mercial traffic soon to flow from
west to cast by way of the Isthmus
of Daricn ; it is to build' up ohr
former merchant marine; is to
furnish a new market for the pro
ducts of our farms; shops and man
ufactures ; it is to mr.ko slavery in
supportable in" Cuba and Porto
Rico at once, and ultimately bo in
Brazil ; it is io settle the unhappy
condition of Cuba, and end the
exterminating conflict; it is to pro
vide honest means . of paying our
honest debts, . .without overtaxing
the people; it is to furnish our cit
feeus with the necessities of every-
day life at cheaper rates than ever
before ; and it is, in line a rapid
stride towards that greatness which
tho inlelliuencc, industry and en- I
tcrprixe of theritizens of the L'n.t
ed States entitles this
assume among nations.
. In view of the importance of this
question, I earnestly urge upon
Congress an early expression of its
views as to the best menus of ac
quiring Sun Domingo. My sug
gestion is that by joint resolution
of the two Houses of Congress,
the Excutive be authorized to ap
point a commission to negotiate
lor a treaty with the authorities of

tion may then be determined by the
action of the two Houses of Con
gress upon a resolution of annexa
tion, as in the case of Texas.
So convinced am I of the advan
tages to follow from the acquisi
tion of San Domingo, and of the
great disadvantages I might a!
most say calamities to flow from

subject has only to be investigated,

Tho massacre of the French and
Russian residents at Tcin-Tsin, un

ty, were supposed to have been pre

minate foreigners. : The evidence
falls to establish such' a supposi
tion, but shows a complicity by tho
local authorities. The Govern
ment at Pekin, however, seems to
have been disposed to fulfill its
treaty obligations so far as it was
able to do so. Unfortunately tho
news of war between tho German

came possessed, with the idea that
this contest would extend to the

THE FISIIEllY QUESTION.
The course pursued by the
Ca
nadian authorities towards the fish
ermen of the United States during
the past season has not been mark
ed by a friendly feeling. By the
first article of the convention of
1818, between Great Britain and
the United Slates, it was agreed
that the inhabitants of the United
States should have forever, in com
mon with British subjects, the right
of taking fish in certain waters
therein defined. In the waters not
included in the limits by the Con
vention, within three miles of ports
of the British coast, it has been the
custom for many years to give to
trading fishermen of the United
States a reasonable warning of their
violation of the technical rights of
Great Britain. The Imperial Gov
ernment is understood to have del
egated the whole, or a share of its
jurisdiction or control of these in
j shore fishing grounds to the colo-
independent but irresponsible
agent has exercised its delegated
powers In an unfriendly way.
Vessels have been seized without
notice or warning, in violation of

the hardy fisherman of the United

authorize tho officers or other per
sons to bring vessels hovering
within three marine miles of any of
the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors
of Canada into port, to search the
cargo and examine the master on
oath, touching the cargo and voy
age, and to enfliet vpou him heavy

any vessel of the United Slates

proposition, which is identical with
the construction now put upon the
language of the Convuition, was
emphatically rejected by the Amer

was abandoned by the British Pic- I
nipotenliaries, aud article one as
it stands in the Convention was!
substituted. If, however, it be '
said that this claim is founded on
provincial or colonial statutes, and
not upon the Convention, this
Government cannot but regard
them as unfriendly and in contra

ofthe Convention, for which the
Imperial Government is alone re
sponsible. Anticipating that an
attempt may possibly be made by I .
the Canadian authorities in the
coming season to repeat these un
neighhorly acts toward our fisher
men, I recommend you to confer
upon the Executive tho power to
suspend by proclamation, the oper
ations ol the laws authorizing the
transit of goods, wares and mer
chandise in bond, or access to the
territory of the United Stares from
Canada; and further, should such
an extreme measure become nec

F1IEE NAVIGATION Of
HENCE.
THE ST. LAW
A like unfriendly disposition has
been manifested on the part of
Canada, in the maintenance ofthe
claim of a right to exclud'! thu cit
izens of the United States from the
navigation of the St. Lawrence.
This river constitutes a natural out-
l,(t to t,IG 0WI for
States of the
Union with an si-isrrvgate popnla-

foreign commerce of our ports on
these waters is open to Iliitisli
competition,. and the major part of
it is done in British bottoms. If
the American seninun be exclud
ed from this natural avenue of the
ocean, the monopoly of the direct
commerce of the lake ports -with
the Atlantic would bo in foreign
hands, their vessels on trans-Atlantic
voyages, having nn access to
our l..ke ports which would be de
nied to American vessels on simi
lar voj ages. To state such a prop
osition is to refute its justice.
During the administration of John
Quincv Adams, Mr." Clay unques
tionably demonstrated the national j
right of the citizens of the United
States to the navigation of tjiis riv
er, clain iigthat the act ofthe Con
gress oi' Vienna in opening the
Rhine and other rivers to nil' na
tions, showed the judgment of Eu
ropean jurists and statesmen, that
the inhabitants of a country thro'
which a navigable river passes, have
a natural right to enjoy the naviga
tion of that river to and into the
sea, even though passing through
the territory of another power.
This, right does not exclude the co
equal right of the sovereign pos
sessing the territory through which
the river debauches into the sea, to
make such regulations relative to
the policy of navigation as may lie
'rer.5onably necessary; but those
1
rcgithnion? should be framed In a
spiiit of comity, and should not
impose needUHs lindens upon the
commerce which has the rij,ht of
transit. It has been found in prac
tice more advantageous to arrange
these regulations by mutual agree
ments.' The United State are
ic;.dy to make any arrangement us
to the police of thu St. Lawrence,
which may be suggested by Great
Britain. If the claim by Mr. Clay
was just, when the population of
S;.iles bordering on tho shores of
the lakes was only 3,J00,l!00 it now
derives greater forco and equity
from the increased population,
wci.Hii, production and tonnage of
the States on the Canadian f.on
tier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his
argument in behalf of our right.lho
principle for which he contended
has been frequently and by various
nations recognized by law, nnd
by treaty has been extended
to several great rivers .
By the treaty concluded fit May-

Uy the Convention between Spain
slid Portugal, concluded in 18!i5,
tho navigation of the Douro
all nations. In 1S.VJ the Para
guay was made free by treaty, nnd
in December, lKliO, the Emperor
of Brazil, by imperial decree, de
clared the Amazon to be open to
the frontier of Brazil, -to the mer
chant ships ofall nations.
The greatest living B.itish an
thoiity on the subject, while asser
ting the abstract righ,t of the Brit
ish claim, says it seems difficult
to deny that Great Britain may
rround her refusal upon strict law,
l,ut ' U PT,!1'.V
dillicult to deny
(ir-4, that in so doing she exercises
j harshly an extreme and hard law ;
! secondly, that her conduct with re
., ;n - , Mili(.i8(.)nni tnok

navigate the entire volume of its

the right of navigation, though
i about half of the waters of lakes

and the whole of lake Michigan,

The whole nation is interested
in securing cheap transportation
from the agricultural States of the
Wist to the Atlantic seaboard. To
the citizens of those Slates it se
cures a greater return for their
labor; to the inhabitants of the
seaboard it oilers cheaper food;
and to the nation an increase in
the annual surplus of wealth. It
is hoped that the Government of
Gnat Britain will see the justice of
abandoning the n: rrow and incon
sistent claims to which her Cana
dian Provinces have urged her ad
herence. oi l! Di:ri;nssi:D commerce.
Our depressed commerce is asub-
ject to which I again call your spec
ial attention. At the hist session,
I suggested that we will in the fu
ture have to look more to the coun
tries south of us, and to China and
Japan for its revival. Our repre
sentatives to all these Govenrmeuts
have exerted their influence to en
courage trade between United
States aud the couutries'to which
they are accredited, but the fact
exists that the carrying is done al
most entirely in foreign bottoms,
and while this state ot affairs exists,
we cannot control our due share
ofthe commerce of the world.
That between the Pacific States and
(.ii ina and Japan is about all the
carrying trade now conducted in
American steamers ; ono that will
insure its success and even in
creased usefulness. The cost of
building iron vessels, the only-ones
that caif compete with foreign ships
in tl e carrying trade, is so much
greater in the United States than
in foreign countries, that without
some assistance from the Govern
ment they cannot successfully be
built here. There will be several
pn positions laid before Congress
iu tlie course ofthe present session,
looking to a remedy for this evil.
Even if it should be at some cost
to the National Treasury, I hope
such encouragement will be given
as will secure American shipbuild
ing at home.
the government archives.
The condition of the archives at
the Department of State calls for
the crlv action of Congress. The
building now rented by that De
partment is a frail structure, at an
inconvenient distance from the Ex
ecutive mansion ai.d from the other
Departments. It is ill adapted to
the purpose for which it is used,
has not capacity to accommodate
tho archives, and is not fire proof.
Its remote situation, its slender
construction, and the absence of a
supply of w ater in the safety for
either tho building or its contents
in case of the accident of a fire.
Its destruction would involve the
loss of the rolls containing the
original acts and resolutions of
Congress, of the historical records
of the revolution, and of the con
federation ; of the whole series of
diplomatic and consular archives
since the adoption of the Constitu
tion, nnd of the many other valua
ble records and papers left with,
that Department when it was the
principal depository ofthe Gov
ernment archives. I recommend
an appropriation for the construe-
