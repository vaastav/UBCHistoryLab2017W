One of Chief Missions.
Washington, Dec. 3. The house as
sembled today with but one object in
view, which was to listen to the read
ing of the president's message, and
adjourn. Frlnted copies of the docu
ment were distributed among the mem
bers, who made a close scrutiny of the
message while the reader plodded
along apparently only for the benefit
of people in the galleries.
Quick Action la Senate.
The annual message of the president
was received by the senate at 12:13
today, and within a minute Secretary
Bennett had begun reading the docu
ment. The secretary read with delib
crativeness and distinctness, and was
followed closely by many senators who
held printed copies of the message.
The galleries were crowded, and many
visitors gave close attention to the
reading.
I. Idle New or Novel.
In the main the document contains
little that is novel; nor does it indicate
that the president has changed his pol
icies. Frequent references are made
to his speeches hitherto delivered, out
lining the president's wishes and de
sires for corporation regulation.
The message recommends currency
legislation and reform, but the presi
dent does not suggest any specific
form of legislation. He points out that
he recommended currency relief in his
last message to congress, but, as on
the former occasion, he takes no stand
on how to provide the necessary elas-J
ticlty to the currency problem. I
Ilnp at Money Moardern.
That the president takes cognizance
of the present strained condition of
the money market and the nervousness
of bank depositors is evident by his
reference to the money hoarders. He
calls attention to the great natural re
sources of the country and provides
statistics to show how prosperous the
nation is. He urges that people have
confidence in the banks and that they
not hoard their money.
The president again urges further in
telligent development of the supervis
ion over interstate commerce and asks
for legislation permitting "pooling" un
( der interstate commerce supervision,
(inoil Need Not Fear.
In the message the president takes
tip the questions of irrigation, drainage
and canals in the localities where they
are most needed. He again discusses
the good corporations, and reiterates
that they need not fear legislation. He
refers to his previous speeches wherein
he has promised that tne wrongdoers
shall be punished.

Washington, Dec. 3. Ambassador
Aoki has been summoned to Japan by
his government to explain personally
the precise situation in this country
in regard to Japanese immigration
problenis.
The ambassador has been making, a
very, careful inquiry on ids own ac
count and through various Japanese
consular officers into the extent of-the
reported race feeling existing' in some
sections of the United States towards
Japanese immigrants.
One Iteport Already Madr.
Already Baron Ishii, one of the sec
retaries of the Japanese interior de
partment, has made an investigation of
conditions existing not only in Califor
nia. Oregon and Washington, but also
in British Columbia on the north, upon
which he has based a special report
to his government, but it is believed
the purpose of the Japanese govern
ment in summoning Aoki to Tokio is
to secure from him information which
Baron Ishii could not possibly have
acquired during his short stay in
America regarding the attitude of the
administration here with particular
reference to measures which have re
cently been applied by the Japanese
government to restrict the departure
from Japan for America of the coolfa
element.

STATE FUNDS GO
Michigan May Lose $600,000
Deposited jn Bank of
Treasurer Glazier.
LATTER FAILS FOR BIG SUM
Arrest of Official May Be Made if It Is
Shown Public Money Is Involved
in Private Affairs.
Detroit, Mich., Dec. 3. As a further
result of the financial troubles of State
Treasurer Frank P. Glazier of Chelsea
which were made public last night,
the Commercial bank of Stockbridge,
Mich., a private institution of which
Glazier is president, today closed its
doors.
Make No Statement.
It was impossible to secure a state
ment of deposits and resources. It
is said, however, the deposits are be;
tween $100,000 and $200,000.
G. H. Gay, partner with Glazier in
the bank, says he closed the doors for
fear the news of Glazier's troubles
would start a run and that he expects
to pay the depositors in full.
Fnila for Large Amount.
Detroit, Mich., Dec. 3. It is an
nounced that State Treasurer Frank
P. Glazier, president of the Glazier
Stove company, the Glazier Savings
bank and the Chelsea Grain and Pro
duce company, all of Chelsea, Mich.,
has failed.
His liabilities are $1,000,000. It is
not yet known what the assets are,
but Detroit bankers say they are much
less than the liabilities. The creditors
probably will realize, 25 cents on the
dollar.
In order to prevent a run on the
bank today, State Banking Commis
sioner Zimmerman announced that it
would not open for business. That
the grain company and the stove fac
tory will be involved in the troubles
is regarded here as a certainty.
Glazier is sick in bed in his home in
Chelsea.
Stair Fund In Feril.
The state of Michigan has $3S4.000!
of the $3,342,000 state treasury funds
on deposit in the Chelsea bank, but
Attorney General Bird says that the
state is protected by the state treas
urer's bond of $150,000 and the bank's
bond Of $200,000. " r
State bank examiners are making an
investigation of the books of the in
stitution to determine whether or not
Glazier used any of the state's funds
to carry on his stove company and
other concerns.
If it is shown that he did use the
money belonging to the state for his
private ventures he will be arrested
on the order of Attorney General Bird.
Hi Scheme VlHlounrj-.
Glazier's failure is due mostly to his
visionary schemes for amassing great
wealth, the profits of which he esti
mated on paper while he was placing
many real thousands into a home for
aged persons, a library for his em
ployes, a fine summer home, an ex
pensive Detroit terrace, a newspaper
plant in Ann Arbor, and other ven
tures. In these he expended $335,000,
and gave many thousands more for
charitable purposes. Then came the
financial stringency and he was pinch
ed for ready money.
Financier in llopclex i'nse.
It has been known for some time
that Glazier's finances have been hope
lessly involved, but he hoped to pre
vail upon his creditors, who met here
yesterday, to extend the time on his
obligations. This they refused to do.
Of the sum that he owes, $640,000 Is
due to Detroit banks.
After the creditors' meeting the pres
ident of one bank announced that
$150,000 was due his institution and
would be charged to profit and 'loss.
Glazier's career has been a spectac
ular one. A year ago he was charged
with freezing out of the stove business
his partner, who alleged each had a
half interest in the business, which
started from a small shop and now

refute this by quoting from the evi
