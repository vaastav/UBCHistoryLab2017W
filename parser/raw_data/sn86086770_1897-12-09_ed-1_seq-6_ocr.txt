quickly into the currency question.
Tin- evil of our present system, he
says, Is found in tlie great cost to tlie
govt i nmeiit of nialnUlning at par
ity with gold our different forms of
money and the experience of the past
Rui years ban demonstrated that
.i . no) onlj u expecsl ze t I*
upon tlie governnient but a dangerous
menace to t ti<> national credit . Ris
rranlfest thtii we must devise some
plan to protect the government
against bond issuett for repeated re
demptions. We have $900,000,000 of
ciirency whiiih the government by sol
emn enact mem luus undertaken to
keep at Iu- and nolsxly is obliged to
iadeem in gold but the government,
whloh must liorrow the gold. The
law whU-.li requires the payment out
of the treasury of redeemed I ulted
Btates notes demiuww a constant re
plenishment of the gold reserve, es
pecially In tiim-s of panic and insut
fleient revenue; and during the pre
coding ndrnlnlsl rat ion $202,225,100, i'n
lir cent Icin/is were issued and sold
to sutain the gold n-scive tind pay
the expenses of the government In ex
r-ss of revenue While it Is true that
:t greater part of this is used to sup
ply tleflcleni revenues, a considerable
portion was required to maintain Go
gold reserve If ..o furl her legisla
tion is to Is* 1 nun to correct tills and
the |Killcy i>f selling bonds is to lie
continued, then congress sliould give
the sw-ndury of the treasury author
ity to sell bonds U long or short per
iods bearing ;i less rite of interest
than Is now authorized by law The
president ays "1 earnestly recom
mend ns soon OS the receipts of the
government are quite sufficient to i>tty
all expeii s.-s of I lie government that
when any I’nlUvi Btat.-s notes are pre
sented for redemption in gold, sueti
iiulns shall Is- kept and set apart and
only paid out in exchange for gold.
This Is an obvious duty. If the
holder of the Fnlted States note pre
fers gold and gets it fr >m Gie govern
ment. he should not receive back from
the government a Fnlted Stales note
without paving gold in exchange for
it," That amounts to giving an in
t crest-lieartng übt, a government
bond for a non-interest hearing debt,
a Fnlted Stales note The govern
ment should lx- relieved from the bur
den of providing all Ihe gold required
for exchanges and exports. This

prosperity and utficl(*nl receipts wc

Secretary Gage In the recommends
tion tbit national banks be allowed
to issue notes to tlie face value of
their bonds deposited; that the < ircu
fining tax lie reduced to one-half of
one per rent , and tfi.i national banks
may lie established with a capital of
$25.1100 He also recommends that
the issue of national bank notes fie
restricted to the denomination of $lO

tary operations continued on humane

b ft free to conduct military opt rations
and great political re.'o-ms while the
I'ntied Staten lor its part should en
force neutral obligations and cut off
the assistance which the insurgents, it
was asserted, received from this coun
try. Marly mol complete pacification
is hoped for. The president declares
tliat the Spanish disposition to ohargt
i,3 with failure to meet international
duties is baseless and points to the ef
ferts this government have made at
the cost of millions and by employment
of the administrative machinery of the
nation to perform Its full duty. He
a iso says that the fact that no military
expedition or armed vessel has left
cur shores has been diplomatically rep
iebenfed with Spain, promising that
throughout all the horror and danger
to our own peace, the I 'lilted Stales
has never abrogated its right, to deter
mine its policy as to Cuba. The
piesfdei't points out that of untried
measures there remains only: Recog
nition of the tnsuigents as belliger
ei tf, recognition of the independence
of Cuba; neutral Intervention to end
i he war by imisming a rational corn
pi mlse between the contestants; an
intervention in favor of one or the
other party. He says. "I speak not
of forcible annexation, for that can
not be thought of. That by our coda
of morality would be criminal aggres
sion. ” Taking up the que. tiion of bel- <.
llgerency, the president quotes at
length from President Grant's mes-
Hngc of Dec. 7, 187£, wherein he de
clared that the conditions in Cuba
warranted neither the recognition of
independence nor the recognition of
belligerency. He adds, moreover, that
a recognition of belligerency would
confer ujxm neither party to the con
flict a statu* not heretofore actually
IKASsessed, while It would weigh heavi
ly In Spain's behalf, giving her the
right of search on the high seas and
extending her maritime rights to the

pi inis to the hopeful change in the

A liberal appropriation Is bespoken
in order that the United Stales may
make a creditable exhibit at the ap
picaching Paris exposition. The pres
ident iKiints to tlie necessity for
speedy legislation to procure the armor
for the three battleships now building
which would be otherwise useless. He
speaks in terms of praise of the qual
ity of our shiiis and refers to the lack
of docks and urges that three or four
of the largest of doc kb-be provided on
the Atlantic; at least one on the Pa
cific. and a floating dock In tihe gulf.
There should also lie ample provision
for munitions of war and an increase
of officers and enlisted men. Addi
tions are also necessary to navy yards
and as there are now on the stocks five
large battleships, it is recommended
that an appropriation be made but for
one mere battleship on the Pacific
coast. Bevc.al torpedo Ixyats are also
necessary.
Speaking of .he pending site of die
Kansas Pacific railroad, It is said that
it no better bid is received than the
Union Pacific set price fixed by Che
court, the government would receive
only $2,500,(KM) on its claim of nearly
$13,000,000. He believe# that the gov
ernment has the authority to bid on
the ixkul and has directed the secretary
of the treasury to make the deposit of
$900,000 required to qualify as a bid
der, and to bid at the sale a sum at
least equal to the principal of the debt
to the government.
I’he president devotes the last chap
ter of his message to the civil service,
Ihe practical improvement of which he
says, lias long l>een a subject of earnest
discussion and which has of late years
received increased legislative and exec
utive approval. During the itast few
mouths the service lias been placed
upon a still firmer basis of business
methods and personal merit. While
the right of deserving veteran soldiers
to reinstatement has been asserted,
dismissals for merely political reasons
tiave been carefully guarded against;
the examinations improved and made
practical and a distinct, ad va’ -e has
been made by giving a hearing before
dismissal upon all case# where Incom
petency is charged or a demand made
for the removal of officials. This las
hes been done without impairing the
power of removal, one of the vital
safeguards of the system. Much re
mains to lie done before the system
j can t-e perfected and the president
| says that he shall not hesitate to ex
• a pt cases which he thinks have been
I in- :>roperly Included la the classified

J Ignienl will best promote the public

to uphold and extend It.
THE REPUBLICAN' PARTY.
Some Facts Connected with Its Origin
lu the Year 1854.
it Us not claimed here that Bovay is
the creator of tlie republican party
I'he spirit was active in 1854, in every
village and city in the free states,
which would have created that party
even If Bovay and Greeley had never
l>eon born. Bovay, however, was the
first person who set out in it resolute,
persistent, ami practical way to form
the party; lit 1 was the first to suggest
the name; and Greeley, through his
paper, which had the largest circula
tion and Influence of any journal in tlie
country at that time, gave Ills valuable
aid in making the party project and
mime known to tlie country.
Some histories say tlie republican
party originated in the eastern states,
and New York and Massachusetts a r e

birthplace, George Tlcknor Curtis'

States, volume 2. published in 1596.

which was elected in that year. Jacob

Electric Road...
...UP THE...
Jungfrau.
A connected history of the annual
conventions of the American Street
Railway association, the last meeting
of which occurred at Niagara Palls,
would present a most interesting view
of the development of motive power
on street railways. At its early meet
ii gs only horse roads were represent-,
od, and the main topics of discussion
were, how many bushels of oats and
how much hay ought to be given to
the propelling power, and the best
methods of shoeing. In the course of
time cal'e roads were Introduced In
the vert and extended to the eastern
cities, when the manufacturers of
machinery suitable for such roads
made exhibits of models at the con
ventions. Later the manufacturers of
electric street railway devices were
represented with their exhibits, but
in recent years the department of ex
hibits of the annual meetings has con
sisted solely of devices that are sult
ab’e to electric roads.
Today there are nearly 1,000 electric
street, railways in the United States,
on which 35.000 cars run over 19,000
miles of track. Resides there are
many companies In the various
pean countries, but It Is generally ad
mitted that America has nothing to
learn from the companies across the
water, for she Is far In advance In the
line of electric railway construction.
In 1835 Thomas Davenport, a Yankee

blacKsmlth in Vermont, astonished ■
the scientific world by exhibiting a |
model of an electric railway embrac- |
Ing all of the essential features of
Lie system now generally employed.
He was unable to secure recognition
from capital, so that his model never
came into practical use. Professor
Moses G. Farmer built an electric lo
comotive which hauled a car carrying
two passengers, the power being fur
nished by a battery of small Grove
cells, each about the size and capacity
of those now employed for ringing
electric l>ells and similar work. This
occurred fifteen years after Daveni>ort
announced his ideas. In 1875 the
present trolley system was first ser
iously considered and an attempt was
trade to operate a trolley hy George
F. Green of Kalamazoo, Mich., who
like Davenport and Farmer, was a
poor mechanic studying scientific
problems principally for entertain
ment and his own personal gratifica
tion. His Invention was necessarily
crude, but it has been affirmed by the i
courts to have been the foundation of
the present trolley system, and it is
generally acknowledged that the
Michigan Inventor is entitled to the
oredit of making the discovery, al
though he has enjoyed scarcely any
other reward.
In 1882 the next etep war taken
when Stephen 1). Field conceived the
idea of a conduit trolley system,
which was put in operation in that
yc.tr, u. hough not In commercial use.
In the same year Charles Van tie
Poole, by experiments in Chicago,
demonstrated the practicability of the
overhead trolley. About the same

Gregor railway at Saratoga. N V..

New York elevated railroad managers
In his system, but as tie was ton far
ahead of the times, he finally aban
doned the field. In July, ISS4, the East
CU-veliind Street Railway company in
augurated a conduit trolley road.
which was abandoned early in ISSS, as
it could not be operated with economy.
The credit of the first electric street
railway that deserves the name belongs
to the city of Richmond. Va., where
Frank .1. Sprague in that year began I
the work of transforming the T'nlon
Passenger railway fjrom a horse to an
electric system. He has since declared
that much of the work he did on that
road was done in the face of what
seemed to him at the time certain fail
ure. but he persevered, and his grim
determination and great versatility
finally turned defeat info victory and
brought him honors and wealth To-!
day the equipment would not be ac
cepted in a lumber camp, but at that
time It was admitted by everybody to
he fir in advance of all former at-;
! tempts, Sprague's successful operation
of the Richmond road led others to
adopt electricity upon a larger scale.
| The West End company of Boston was
I the first large concern to signify Its
belief in the practicability of the sys
tem by ordering a complete equip
ment. From this point interest was
shown everywhere, but especially
throughout the west, and every town
In the northwest was soon clamoring
for the trolley.
The efforts of all the practical men
interested in the operation of electric
street railways have been directed to
lessening the cost of operation. In
track construction the rails have been
made heavier than the sections in use
on steam roads, and great care has
been given to bonding, there being
many patents issued on devices whose
object Is to prevent the escape of elec
tric current into the earth on its way
back to the power house, which has
resulted in the continuous rail in which
the ends of the rails are welded to
gether, either by electricity or joined
by the cast welding process. When
the originators of these processes first
brought them to the notice of the
street railway men they were consid
ered impracticable because it had been
customary for the steam roads to leave
spaces between the rails to allow for
contraction and expansion, and this
practice has been followed in street
railway work. As street railway rails
are almost entirely covered by the
pavement and the steam road rails
are some Inches above the ground, it
has been demonstrated that in the for
mer ease there is comparatively little
expansion or contraction, but there is
great economy as the ioes of current 1
is minimized. Some roads bond the
rail sections in addition to welding
them.
In 1892 the third rail system which
was in use on the electric railway at
the world's fair first made its appear-'
ance. The first large installation was
that of the Metropolitan Elevated rail
way of Chicago, which was followed
by the Lake Street Elevated road.
When the Consolidated road of New
England decided to try the experiment
of equipping its Nantasket Beach
branch with electricity, because Its pa
trons demanded better service and the
highest efficiency that could be ob
tained from steam was already util
ized, a special overhead wire was used,
which gave way to the third rail sys
tem. The first experiment was so suc
cessful. that the company decided to
equip a large portion of its road in the
same manner, ns it was proved that
there was greater efficiency of service
at leas cost than when the road was
operated by steam.
There have been a gn*at many un
and some of them are in practical use
derground conduit systems proposed,
in the east, although none of them
have been tried in cities where there is
a heavy snowfall in winter. The stor
age battery system also does away with
the overhead trolley, but there is only
one large installation, and that has not
yet passed the experimental stage.
This company has been operating tills
summer a suburban line in Chicago,
but there have been no tests made dur
ing the winter months. Compressed
air motors have also been tried for
operating street ears with some suc
cess.
The trolley is even beginning to re
place the alpenstock, and soon neither
age, weakness nor timidity need deter
the European tourist from making a
record as a moutmiin climber. The
construction of an electric railway up
the Jungfrau is being actively prose
cuted, and It is expected that the first
section of the road will be open for
traffic by next season. The construc
tive details have now nearly all been
decided on. and among the most im
portant are the electric locomotives,
which will depend for tractive effort
( on a rack rail, owing to the gradients,
which reach as high as 2a per cent.
The trains on this line are very heavy,
on account of the endeavors of the
management to combine great power
with great economy. A train consists
of one passenger car with motors on
it. and one other cor for either pas
sengers nr freight. The driving cog
wheels are made as large as possible.
