PRESiDEHFS MESSAGE.
To (In: ( iitgrf of (h: United State.
"Ai rcprcM-utativesof the people in
t!: legislative hratich of the (tim-rn-mt.-ut.
vou huve K.ssomllcl ot a time
when (he strength ami excellence of our
free institutions and the fitness of our
citizens to enjoy popular rule have leeu
aiaiu made nianifiU A xlitieal eon
test invol vitifT momentous consequences
fraught with feverish appreheusion,
and creating ajrresivenes so intense
as to approach hitterness and passion,
has leeu wared thru,rhout our land,
and di'tormined hy the decree of free and
independent suilrae, without disturb
anc? of our tranquility or the least fin
of weakness in our National ntru-ture.
''When we consider these incidents
and cointcmpiate the ik.-a.eeful obetii
enee and manly suhtnissina which have
succeeded a heatcvl ciajh of political
opinions, we discover :i'.und tut evi-deni-eof
a tlctcnuination on thepirt
of our countrymen to ahide hy every
verdict of the jtopular will, and to be
tHtntrolk-d sit all times by au abiding
faith in the agencies established for the
direction of the a Hairs of the (Sjvern
incnt. "Thus our people exhibit a patriotic
ui.-jvir.it ion which et titles them to de
mand of tho.e who uudcrtake to make
and execute their laws, such, faithful
and unseliinh service iu their behalf as
can only lie prompted by a serious ap
preciation of the trust and eonfideuce
which the acceptance of public duty
invites."
The President then expres.s-s his re
gret at the unimproved condition of
allairs in Turkey. While he says no
citizens of the I'nited States in Turkey
have thus far been killed or wounded,
their safety in future is by no means as
sured. Kliorts have not U.'en spared,
and will not be, by the (iovernmcnt or
the United States Minister at Constan
tinople to protect our misioii:tries iu
Ottoman territory. "Hut," r:iys the
President, "the detp feci i and sym
pathy that has levn arou.il a-M :&
our p.siple ought not to so far b.inil
their reas-jfi and judmciit as to lead
them to demand impossible things."
An adequate force for protection, would
he adds, lie resented by both Turkey
and the Powers. Nothing vi I lie omit
ted to tiring about the prompt settle
ment of the claims for destruction of
missionary projierty at Harriot and
Masash. Hojie is expressed that no
obstacle will in future be iuterjKwd to
prevent the cMjie from Turkey of all
those who seek lo avoid the perils
which threaten them there, and that
the present sombre prosjiect in Turkey
will not long be erniitted to olfend
the sight of Christendom.
Considerable space is given to Cuba.
The President finds it diilicuit to per
ceive that any prigreas has thus far
been made toward the pacification of
the Inland, notwithstanding Spain's
strengthened detcrminatlm to put
down the insurrection. "There is much
reason to be ieve that the Insurgents
have gained iu point of numliers, char
acter, and resources, and are none the
less inflexible in their resolve not to
succumb without practically securing
the great objects for which they took
up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established
her authority, neither have
the Insurgents yet made good their
title to le regarded as an independent
State." The only civil government
maintained is that by Spain, more or
less imperfectly, in the large towns
ami their immediate suburbs. "It is
rcKrted, indeed," the President pro
ceeds, "on reliable authority, that, at
the demand of the Commander-in-Chief
of the Insurgent army, the putative
Cuban government has now given up
all attempt to exercise it.s functions,
leaving that government confessedly
(what there is the best reason for sup
posing it always to have been in fact)
a government merely on papi-r."
Arguing from the inability of the
Spanish troops to bring aliout a pitch
e l battle, the President paints out that
there is hardly a limit to the time hos
tilities may be prolonged, and the
Spanish authorities pceiu to have Im
itated the Insurgents in a policy of
"w!y!ti!? V1" 1 ion p5;;ErJv',f U;
it may not b used by their opponents.
At least from foit.OtfJ.t) to $"t),fK)0,Kr
of American capital are invested in the
Island, and there is an immense tra le
between the United States and the Is
land, liesidc, Cuban residents in this
c untry, many of them uuturaliz 1,
promote the Insurrection by means
which the laws and the spirit of our
institutions can not reach, ami Ameri
can citizens express their oyuipathy in
many substantial ways, thus necessi
tating coustaut claims by this country
for protection of its citizens and for
damages now estimated at many mil
lions. The demands made for the ac
cording of belligerent rights tolhelu
surgents, the recognition of their inde
pendence; the purchase by the Unittd
States of the Island, or the interven
tion of the United States to end the
strife, even at the cost of war with
Sjiain, are all dismissed by the Presi
dent Tl:c restraint and patient endurance
of the United States of conditions in
Cuia are pointed out, as well as the
respect aud regard for Spain thus man
ifested by the American jieople. Final
ly the President suggests : "It would
seen that if Spain should o.Ter to Cuba
genuine autonomy a measure of home
rule which, which, while preserving
lh ivcnignty of Spain, wxuld satisfy
a'l rational requirements of Iter Span
ish subjects there should lie in just
reason why the pacific.it ion of the Is
land might not be elleetcd on that
basis. Sjc'ii a result would appear to
lie in the true interest of all concerned.
It would at once stop the con diet
which is now consuming the resources
of the Island and making it worthies
for whichever party may ultimately
prevail. It would ke p intact the pos
sessions of Spain w ithout touching her
hunor, which will be vindicated rather
than impugned by the adequate redress
of admitted grievances. It would put
the prosperity of the Island aud the
fortune of its inhabitants within their
own control without severing the nat
ural and ancient tics which bind them
to the mother country, ami would yet
enable them to test their capacity for
self-government under the most favor-,
0111

able conditions. It has been objected
on the one side that Spain should not
promise autonomy until her Insurgent
subjects lay down their arms; on the
other side, that promised autonomy,
however liberal, is insufficient, because
without assurance of the promise b
ing fulfilled.
"Hut the reasonableness of a require
ment by Kpain, of unconditional sur
render on the part of the Insurgent
Cubans before their autonomy is eou-
oeded, is not altogether apparent It ig
nores important features of the situa
tion the stability two j-ears' duration
litis given to the insurrection; the feas
ibility of its indefinite prolongation, in
the nature of thiDgs, aud as shown by
past experience; the utter aud immi
nent ruin of the Island, unless the.
present strife is speedilj' composed;
above all, the rank abuses which
parties in Spain, all branches of her
government, and all her leading public
moil e.nteede to exist and profess a
desire to remove. Facing such cir
cumstances, to withold the proffer of
needed reforms until the parties de
manding them put themselves at mer
cy by throwiug down their arms, ha
the apca ranee of neglect! ng the gravesD
of perils and inviting suspicion as t
the sincerity of any professed willing
ness to grant reforms. The objection
on behalf of the Insurgents that prom
ised reforms can not be relied upon
must of course be considered, though
we have no right to assume, and to
reason for assuming, that anything
Spain undertakes to do for the relief of
Cuba will not be done according to
both the spirit and the letter of the un
dertaking." The 1 'resident deprecates an assump
tion that Spain would evade any obli
gation she undertook toward the In
surgents, but realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the part of the
weaker party are natural, "it wsls iuti
mated by this (iovcrnmeut to tlte Gov
ernment of Spain some months bro
that, if a satisfactory measure of honu
rule were tendered the Cubau Insur
g -nts, and would be accepted by them
upon a guaranty of its execution, the
United States would endeavor to fiud
a way not objectionable to Spain of
furnishing such guaranty. While no
definite response to this intimation has
yet been received from the Spanish
Government, it is believed to be not
altogether unwelcome, while, as al
ready suggested, no reason is perceived
w'ny it should not tie approved by the
Insurgents."
The friendly offices of the United
States, he says, in this or any other
way are at the disposal of either party,
and we should object to the acquisition
of the Island, or any interference with
its control by any other nation. "It
should be added that it ran not be rea
sonably assumed that the hitherto ex
pectant attitude of the United States
will be indefinitely maintained. While
we are anxious to ao-ord all due respect
to the sovereignty of Spain, we can not
view the pending eonllict iu all its
features ami properly apprehend our in
evitable close relations to it and its pos
sible results without considering that
by the eourse of events we may be
drawn into such an unusual and un
precedented condition as will fix a limit
to our patient waiting for Spain to end
the contest, either alone and in her own
way, or w ith our friendly co-operation.
"When the inability of Spain todeal
successfully with the Insurgents has
Income manifest, and it is demonstrat
ed that her sovereignty is extinct iu
Cuba for all purposes of its rightful ex
istence, and when a hopeless struggle
for its re-establishment has degenerat
ed into a strife which means nothing
nitre than the useless sacrifice of hu
man life and tho utter destruction of
t ue very subject matter of the conflict,
a situation will be presented in which
our obligations to the sovereignty of
Spain will be superceded by higher ob
ligations, which we can hardly hesitate
to recognize aud discharge. Deferring
theehoiceof ways and methods until
the time for action arrives, we should
make them depend up.ni the precise
conditions then CTisf'nigj. and they
should not ue ae&rniined upan with
out giving careful imi to every OT.
STion 'nvavini;ollr ij0lll)r auj in-
tereot or the international duty we owe
to Spain. Until we face the contin
gencies suggested, or the situation is
by other Incidents imperatively chang
ed, we should cjntiuue in the line of
conduct heretofore pursued, thus in all
circunistan vs exhibitingour obedience
to the requirements of public law aud
our reg.wd for the dJty enjoined upon
tu by the jiosition we occupy ill the
family of nations."
The closing of the Venezuelan ques
tion aud the far advance with promise
of an early siicjessful consummation of
negotiations for a general arbitration
treaty with Great Britain are briefly
noted.
Hope of co-operation with Great
Itritaiu for the better preservation of
seal life iu Behring Sea is expressed.
The statistics from the Treasury De
partment, including those of the reve
nues, are submitted without comment
or recommendation. The same is true
of the statistics of immigration. The
progress in coast defense is alluded to
as the one form of military preparation
essentially pacifie in its nature. Sum
maries of the reports of the Attorney
General and the Ptsttuaster-General
are included. The postottlee deficit,
due to "carrying at the nominal rate of
one cent a pound the serial libraries,
including trashy and even harmful
literature, and other matter which,
under the loose interpretation of a loose
statute, has been gradually given -ec-ond-class
rates," is poiuted out as an
abuse that should be corrected. An
adequate appropriation for the enter
tainment of the International Postal
Union Congress in Washington is rec
ommended. On affairs of the Navy
and Interior Departments there is noth
ing in the message not contained in
the reports of the Secretaries. Of the
Pension Commissioner's report the
President says:
"In my opinion, based upon such
statements as these and much other in
formation and observation, the abuses
which have been allowed to creep into
our pension svsteni have done incalcu
. . . . . ...
lable harm iu ; demoralizing our pople
o.i i.i,l. r-oioiti,- from! eitizonshin."
The President urges the importance
erset
ESTABLISHED 1827.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 1G. 181)0.
of an adjustment of Pacific ltailroad
obligations. Of the case of the Union
Pacific, he points out that proceedings
to forclose a first mortgage upon added
parts of the main line to which the
Government lien is subordinate and the
default occurring on January 1, 1S'.7,
must emphasize the mandate of the Act
of 1SS7 to foreclose. "Therefore, unless
Congress shall otherwise direct orshall
have previously determined upon a dif
ferent solution of the problem, there
will hardly appear to exist any reason
for delaying beyond the date of the de
fault above mentioned such Executive
action as wiii promise to suljserve the
public iutcrests and save the Govern
meiit from the loss threatened by furth
er inaction."
The work done by the Agricultural
iH'partment is especially commended,
but the discontinuai.ee of tbe gratuit
ous distribution of seeds is urged.
The progress of Civil Service Reform
for the year is reviewed as a cause for
the utmost congratulation. The amend
ment of the 1 nter-State Commerce Act
is recommended.
Iiecurring again to the statistics of
the Treasury Department, the President
oilers some suggestions regarding the
present Tariir law and its operation,
lie says: "Whatever may be its short
comings as a complete measure of Tar
iir Iteform, it must be coiieieded that it
lias otiened the way to a freer ami great
er exchange of commodities between us
and other countries, and thus furnish
ed a wider market for our products and
manufactures."
Continuing, the President says: "I
believe our present Tariir law, if allow
ed a fair opirtuuity, will in the
near future yield a revenue which, with
reasonable economic expenditures, will
overcome all deficiencies. In the mean
time no deficit that has occurred or
may occur need excite or disturb us.
To meet any" such deficit we have in
the Treasury, in addition to a goid re
serve of one hundred millions, a sur
plus of more than one hundred and
twenty-eight millions of dollars, ap
plicable to the payment of the expen
ses of the Government, and which must
unless expended for that purpose, re
main a Us less hoard, or, if not ex
travagantly waste!, must in any event
be perverted from the purj.xise of its
exaction from our people. The pay
ment, therefore, of any deficiency iu
the revenue from this fund is nothing
more than its properand legitimate use.
The Government thus applying a sur
plus fortunately in its Treasury to the
payment of cxjienses not met by its
current revenues, is not at all to be
likened to a man living Iieyond his in
come ami thus incurring debt or en
croaching on his principal."
The President renews his former rec
ommendation for tlu retirement of the
greenbacks. "I am more convinced
than ever that we can have no assured
financial peace and safety until the
Government currency obligations upon
which gold may lie demanded from the
Treasury are withdrawn from circula
tion and cancelled. This might be
done, as has licen hetetofore recom
mended, by their exchange for long
term bonds, bearing a low rate of in
terest, or by their redemption with the
prtweeds of such bonds. Kven if only
the United States notes known as green
backs were thus retired, it is probable
that the Treasury notes issued in pay
ment of silver piircha-es under the act
of July 11, 1.;0, now paid iu gold when
demanded, would not create much dis
turbance, as they might, from lime to
time, when received in the Treasury
by redemption in gold or otherwise, hi
gradually and prudently replaced by
silver coin.
"This plan of issuing Imnds for the
purpose of redemption certainly ap
pears to lie the most effective and di
rect path to the needed reform. In de
fault of Ibis, however, it would lie a
step iu the right direction if currency
obligations redeemable in gold, when
ever so redeemed, should be cancelled
instead of being reissued. This oper
ation would be a slow remedy, but it
would improve preseut conditions.
.."National Hanks should redeem their
issue circur.tf to the par value of
bonds deposited as security for its re
demption, ami the tax on their circula
tion should be reduced to one-fourth of
one per cent"
The message concludes as follows:
"Another topic iu which our jieople
rightfully take a deep interest may be
here briefly considered. I refer to the
existence of trusts and other huge ag
gregations of capital, the object of
which is secure the monopoly of some
particular branch of trade, industry, or
commerce, and to stitl.i wholesome
comjietitioii. When these are defend
ed, it is usually on the ground that,
though they increase profits they also
reduce prices, and thus benefit the pub
lic. It must be remembered, however,
that a reduction of prices to the people
is uot one of the real objects of these
organizations', nor is their tendency
j necessarily in that direction. If it oc
curs in a particular case, it is only be
cause it accords with the purposes or
interests of those managing the scheme.
"Such occasional results fall fur short
of compensating the palpable evils
charged to the account of trusts ami
monopolies. Their tendency is to crush
out individual independence and to
hinder or prevent the free use of human
faculties and the full devclepment of
human character. Through them the
farmer, the artisan, and the small
trader is iu danger of dislodgenient
from the proud position of being his
own master, watchful of all that touch
es his country's prosperity iu which he
lias an individual lot aud interested in
all that effects .he advantages of busi
ness of which he Is a factor, to le rele
gated to the level of a mere appurte
nance to a great machine, with little
free will, with no duty but that of pas
sive obedience, aud with little hope or
opportunity of rising in the scale of
responsible and helpful citizenship.
"To the instinctive belief that such ia
the inevitable trend of trusts and mon
opolies is due the widespread and deep
seated popular aversion in which they
are held aud the not unreasonable insis
teuce that whatever may le their inci
dental economical advantages their gen-
eral eflect upon personal character,
prospects, and usefulness cannot be
otherwise than injurious. Though
Congress has attempted to deal with
this matter by legislation, the laws
passed for that purpose thus far have
proved ineffective, uot because of any
lack of disposition or atU mpt lo en
force them, but simply because the
laws themselves, interpreted by tli
courts, do not reach the difficulty.
If the insufficiencies of existing laws
can be remedied by further legislation
it should be done. The fact must le
recognized, however, that all Federal
legislation on this subject may full
short of its purjiose, liecause of inher
ent obstacles, which, while making the
Federal authority supreme within its
sphere, has carefully limited that
sphere by metes and bounds which
cannot be transgressed. The decision
of our highest court on this precise
question renders it quite djubtful
whether the evils of trusts ami monop
olies can Inadequately treated through
Federal action uulcss they seek direct
ly and purposely to include in their ob
jects trausiiortatiou or intercourse be
tween States or between the United
States and foreign countries.
"It does not follow, however, that
this is the limit of the remedy that
may be applied. Kven though it may
be found that Federal authority is not
broad enough to fully reach the case,
there can be no doubt of the xwtr of
the several States to act effectually in
Che premises, and there should be no
reason to doubt their willingness to ju
diciously exercise such power.
"In concluding this communication
its last words shall lie an appeal to the
Congress for the most rigid economy in
the expenditure of the motley it holds
in trust for the people. The way to
perplexing extravagant e is easy, but a
return to frugality is diilicuit. When,
however, it is considered that those
who bear the burdens of taxation have
no guaranty of honest care save in the
fidelity of their public servants the du
ty of all jxissible retrenchments is
plainly manifest.
"When our differences are forgotten
and our contests of political opinion
are no longer rememlcred, nothing in
the retrospect of our public serxitsj will
lie as fortunate am! omforting as the
recollection of ofiicial duty well jier
formed and the memory of a constant
devotion to the interests of our confid

An amusing little story about the
present emperor of Germany, Will
iam 1 1, aud a Vienna coachman was
narrated at a banquet lately given at
Vienna by some diplomatists, the nar
rator lieiug himself a well known anil
prominent member of the corps di
plomatic.
In the year 1SS7 the present p.niper-
or William 11. ol tiermany, men
Prince William of Prussia, came to
Vienna, visiting his particular friend
ami chum, the late Crown Prince Iiu
dolf of Austria. Joined by the Prince
of Wales, who was at that time also a
frequent visitor to the Vienna court,
thctluee princes took a fancy to ming
le with the commons of the Vienna
population. Dressed in ordinary
clothes they visited jilavs which are not
in the least regarded as suitable for
princely guests.
One day they catered a hotel, but in
stead of going into the dining mom
thev walked into the "schweiiim"," a
place which answers in some tb-gree to
the bar room of an American hotel ; in
this room coachmen and the servants
of the hotel guests take their meals.
The three princes took seats at an
empty table, and listened, htgiiiy
amused, to a fierce debate a'iut poli
tics between several stout members of
that class of fashionable Vienna coach
men who are known all over Kurope
as "fescue Wiener fiakcr." The dis
tinction of those charioteers is a kind
of gnod naiutvd -imldiicss and drcll
familiarity toward their customers as
well as to perfect strangers.
After listening awhile Prince Will
iam put in a word, and s.oti was
drawn into the excited discussion.
Suddenly a stout, red faced coach man

princes were seated, an I, tapping.
Prince illiain gently on the shoulder,
said, "Now, if you s'io jld ever have
anything to say hi politics, you
wouldn't set a riv.-ron fire, I'm sure !"
As every public coachman in Vienna
wears a number, this coachman was
upon a special request of Prince Will
iam easily identified. The prince
sent him a tantlsome scarfpin with
his initials as thanks for the amuse
ment he had famished, and thus the
man learned in amazmi -nt w'.io; po
litical abilities they were that he had

Famous Farmer Boys.
There are some jieople foolish enough
to laugh at the homely virtues of a
farm life. They are fortunately few,
and they are fortunately growing few

the list of great men who came up
from the farm not all of them, for
that would fill a thousand volumes,
but some of the most able ones that
flash into mind in a moment Nearly
three-fourths of the men who have
lieeu chosen by the jx"ople for the great
ollices of the nation are men who were
early familiar with wooded bills and
cultivated fields, says the Kansas City
Times; for example, Lincoln, Grant,
Garfield, Hamlin, Greeley, Tilden, liar
rison, Hayes, Blaine, ami many others
almost equally conspicuous iu current
events or living memory. Among
journalists, Henry Watterson spent his
early life iu rural Kentucky, ami JIu

THE MAKING
OF CITIZENS.
The following able address was dcliv
en-d by Virgil It Saylor, A. M prin
cijal of the Salisbury public schools,
in restionse to the Address of Welcome
before the Teachers' Institute, Dec.
LiulU and (! ntli nn n of Siiier.vt and
t ieinifif :
III liehalf of the teachers of Somer
set county, I thank you for your kind
words of welcome spoken through
your representative. Your welcoming
us to your beautiful town is not a
new thing. The teachers, directors
and instructors for forty years have ex
perienced your hospitality. What
d'x s it represent? It tells us that the
tehools are of great vulue, and the
work we are doing is of vast import
ance. The nation, not less than the
States, is dependent for prosperity and
security ujion the intelligence and mo
rality of the jieople. This was seen to
le of such vast importance that com
mon interest ve-ry early suggested na
tional aid in the establishment and
endowment of schools and colleges iu
the new States.
When this town was laid out by the
early settlers, the first thing iu con
templation was the erection of school
houses for the education of their chil
dren and children's children. When
we consider the prosperity of our coun
ty, we do not wonder that you so hear
tily welcome the teachers of the
schools which have been so largely in
strumental in bringtug us this prostx-r-ity.
What a testimony it is to the
American character that, however in
tense the push for the tilings of this
TTfe, however eager the pursuit of gain,
you can never assemble a community
of two hundred jieople that they do
not lx-gin to organize schools fr the
children. Why? liecause the scIkk. Is
are nurseries of intellectual training,
morality and true citizenship.
We strive to give the pupils an intel
lectual training. This county, State
and nation is judged first, from the in
telligence of its citizens. But, let us
remember, fellow teachers, that more
di'i-emls upon what a human being te
comcs in the school than what he
learns there. Culture is to lie consid
ered the higher aim; instruction, us
the principal means to this end. We
are too prone to give undue prominence
to the mental training. There is a just
mean, I think, between a system of in
tellectual conijetitio!i which de-stroys
the body and a system of physical
training that eliminates the mind. It
is the duty of every true teacher to
strike this happy mean so that the citi
zens, in battling with the problems of
life, will have sufficient culture and
physical ability to battle well.
I am glad your representative men
tioned the public sclxiol as a nursery of
morals and reform movements.
"Knowledge maketh a wise man;" it
may also arouse all the evil tendencies
in one, thereby making him a demon.
Hut, if we educate the whole man, giv
ing equal weight to the mental, moral
and physical natures, we will scud
forth future citizens who will hav, sta
bility and permanency in whatever vo
cations and wherever they may lie.
Iu the education of the children, you
all agree, that the school is not the
place for hair-splitting differences in
reference to mere opinion, but that we
must devote our time and energy to
some wider and more comprehensive
scheme of work, if we wish to be lead
ers in those great movements which
have for their object the general im
provement of the moral, social and in
tellectual condition ef our State and
country.
The public schools have been leaders
and valuable agitators in all reform
movements. Other countries have
.seen the good work our se-hool system
is doing and have lieen benefited by
her. Said an experienced F.nglish
sehtxd-nixstcr: "The Knglish school
system is fettered by ancient laws and
customs; but the parliamentary acts
of lS'H and ist', giving partial! v tree
-- t ion. may be traced to two potent

point with pride to the school systeui
of our State and nation when such a
country as England will take lessons
from her.
The teaching in the English schools
in regard to events which have occur
red between that country and ours is
often ludicrous. An American teacher
entered a London book-seller's and
asked to be shown a copy of the En
glish history most used in the common
schools. The clerk handed her an
English history; she turned to the
Revolutionary War and found that the
writer stated the cause of the war to be
due to the fact that the English church
did not send over bishops enough to
teach the Puritans their duty. The
Pilgrim fathers did their duty and
"while the breaking waves dashed
high on New England's stern and
rock-bound coast," they were plantiug
principles which shaped the destiny of
our nation.
But the schools are not simply nur
series of intellectual training and mo
rality, they are also nurseries of true
citizenship. For, after all, the strength
and dedense of our institutions, ntt on
ly in peace, but in war, are to be
foun in the young of the laud who
have received from the lips of patriot
ic teachers the story of the sacrifice
which our fathers made to establish
our civil institutions, and which their
sons have rejieated on hundreds of battle-fields.
The organized army of the
United Stated, if we include the mili
tia of the State, is of insignificant
projMirtion when put in contrast with
the armies of other great powers of
the world. Our strength is Hot in
these. It Ls in that great reserve to be
found in the instructed young of the
land, who come to its defense in time
of peril.
It is not simply our duty to give the
power that comes from education, but
to give that jxwer safe direction. He
is not a benefactor of his race who

power. Therefore, we must insist that

Indies and gentlemen, your presence
here shows us that we are welcome'.
It is encouraging to know that the good
jMKqde all over our land are heartily in
sympathy with our work. The intel
lect is the region of cold attraction.
It touches life in seeking ways and
means of act ion, but without reaching
the better side of human nature syni
jathy it is cold, hard, cheerless, and
oftentimes cru-el. Sorrow and suffer
ing, misery and wretchedness are everywhere-.
Shall these ills be lessened
by our work ? Is it belter to alleviate
the sum of human woe, or contribute
to it? Is it better to instill into the
hearts and consciences of our boys and
girls resjie-et for truth and hajpiaes of
others, than to seek advantages by re
sorting to cunning and sharp practices?
I imagine which of these two theories
you believe to be the more important.
We net'd your sympathy Just as much
as the j'Upils need our symjiathy. You
symjiathizc with the work in which
we are engaged because you see in it
the safety of our country, but what is
more, jx-rhaps, the safety of society.
Give Us that communicating touch of
syiujathy, and it will shed its encour
aging influence wherever it goes.
The citizen, and w e have him, who
criticises the teacher aud his work, yet
never crosses the threshold ef the
school room is a meuaco to the schools
and a menace to his country. Then,
let no dark sjnitsof envy, hatred, mal
ice or jealousy l found lurking in the
he-art of any cue connected with the
public school system ; and, if there
should U-otie unfortunate so distressed,
let the fctd stain Le wiped cut or
smothered forever.

Pennsylvania, whose j uhiic schools
are also the jiride of the State and na

this indifference and change the
apathy int-j enthusiasm, ymjatby and

Now, ladies and gentlemen, again
I thank you. May our stay in your
midst le a pleasant aud jirofitable one,

Hade PayaMj in Tobacca by the Coa
tiacatal Congress-
Two curious facts were brought into
prominence by Register Tiiinnn iu his
recent report They are that the first
loan made by the United Stares was
made payable in tobacco, and that Sec
retary Alexander Hamilton negotiated
a loin in the absene'e of any law au
thorizing him to do so. The loan made
payable in tobacco was authorized by a
resolution of the Continental congress
on December lTTrl. Tiie length of
the loan was indefinite, and the
amount authorized was lO,(i.),bO.
The amount issued was $1SI,., which
sold at par, with interest at " per cent
This was rcceuved June 4, 1777, from
the Farmers Genera! of France. The
purjiose to which the loan was applied
was the "purchaso-'of supplies and to
aid the building of cruisers to prose
cute the war of the revolution." The

The Secretary said : Ohviotis considera

A third loan followed under the ret

negotiated by 1 hessMcut V ttshingtou,
and the amount issued was i",!M.
The contract for the loan provided f t
its repay:ne;it tjmu similar ter.us t.s
the preceding loan from the bank of

duties on imports and tonnage being
pledged for its redemption. The mot: y
