COAL BLEND ORDER
TO DEALERS FIXES
Substitutes Must Be Sent

Wav.
TON BUYERS EXEMPTED.
Rigid Enforcement Will Avert
Famine Here, Woodin
Asserts.
In Issuing to coal dealers to-day
copies of tho ordor wlhch requires
them, beginning Monday next, to
split their deliveries into proportions
of three-quarters nnthracte and one
quarter bituminous or other substi
tute fuel, the State Fuel Administra
tion also Instructed coal dealers how
deliveries nre to bo mndo and how
prices nre to be charged.
For Instance, a consumor ordering
four tons of coal will first receive one
ton of bituminous or other substitute,
such as steam coal, and latter in an
other lot, will receive the thrco ton
of anthracite, making tho total of
four tons. Tho bill for theso four
tons will bo split similarly as tho coal
delivery was split. Tho bill will con
tain ono Item for the substitute and
another Item for the domestic an
thraclte and tho total will constitute
tho wholo order as dollvered.
Arthur S. Lcaredy, local Fuel Ad
ministrator for the First Judicial Dls-
tlrct, drew tho order so as to exempt
consumers pucrhasing les sthan ono
ton from tho requirements of this
ordor.
Dealers are warned to see that
customers do not evade tho restric
tions by ordering ono ton when their
allotment would Da two. On tha sec
ond ton, In such cases, tho dealer
must deliver a substitute or withhold
tha entire order. The FjoI officials
think the dealers will co-operata In
enforcing the order, which is as fol
lows: Each delivery of the sizes of .m-
thracito known as arato, broken,
stove, chestnut or range coal, wbero
such coal is used tor heating purposes
and whero tho delivery consists of
two tons or more, shall be iroceded
5r accompanied by a dellwry of not
.ess than 26 per cent of bu-.kwheat,
coke, bituminous coal or other sub
stitutes. No delivery of lesb than ono
ton of substitutes is requi'ed under
this order.
To meet tha presont emergency It
Is further recommended tnat when
ever possible tho minimum of substl-
tu's of 25 per cent, be increased and
that wherever practical substitutes be
delivered with orders ol less 'nan two
tons. The support and co-operation
of the publlo Is essential If the utmost
relief posslblo 1b to be obtilned under
this ordor, and consumers ate urgid,
for their own protection and for the
public good, to order the highest pos
sible ratio of substitute fuils.
Tho order la Issued as a result of
Thursday's conference In Albany, or.d
applies to parts of Nassau and Suf
folk Counties, Long Island, as well
as tho five boroughs, all being In Mr.
Lcaroyd's districts, Nos. 1 and 2. Mr.
Learoyd explained that tho ordor wis
necessary because much coal nos
lying Idle In and near New York as
a result of the refusal of consumers
to use substitutes. He added that If
this order does not do tha trick there
may bo n moro drastic one.
Tho Fuel Administrator made It
plain there Is sufficient ooal on hand
now so that if tho Instructions art
carried out thero Is no danger of suf
fering. TOSCANINI LEAVES

TIGER REPUDIATES
LEAGUE OF NATIONS
Says Versailles Treaty
Wouldn't Prevent War,
President's Program Will.
PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 9. Georges
Clemenceau, War Premier of France,
to-day proposed tho Immediate open
ing of negotiations nt Washington for
an agreement between tho United
Htatc nnd tho othor nations of the
world, that he indicated could take
the placo of tho League of Natloiw
and return thin country to the coun
sels of Europe.
The old French statesman made
thin statement Immediately after ho
lind flatly declared to a great audlonce
lu tho Academy of Music hero that
he did not believe In tho League of
Nations us a means of preventing
war.
His recommendation for the nego
tiations at Washington was based on
President Harding's statement in his
address to Congress yesterday sug
gesting that aramgomcnts simitar to
the Four-Power Pacific Treaty of tho
rms Conference could be made in
other parts of the world.
"I was greatly encouraged yester
day by thin paragraph In tho address
of President Harding before Congress
In Washington," the speaker said,
Then tho Tiger told of tho President s
suggestion about the possibility of
widening tha four-power pact.
"That was n great, Important and
noblo word to Europo," the old Tiger
raid. "I don't think it would be
wrong for peoplo to engago to have a
talk In Washington to see what can
be dono towurd making satisfactory
arrangements for the United States
Joining In tho settlement of these
Qucstlona."
"You have heard of tho League of
Nations," said tho Tiger as ho was
approaching the end of his speech. "I
personally don't bellcvo in it," ho' do
clared. amid applause. Hastening to
explain his statement, Clemenceau
said:
"I don't believe that it can over
bring about an end of war. At the
same time I believe that uny effort to
that end la good." This statement
was greeted with upplause, perhaps
moro than followed the preceding one.
