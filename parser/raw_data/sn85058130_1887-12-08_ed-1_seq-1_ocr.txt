Harper trial this morning Eckert of
Wilshire Eckert Co was recalled to
give additional testimony 01 the points
upon which he was prevlouslyexamined
Hinch assistant receiving teller was
then put on the stand and examined in
I
the same line He as heretotore fol
lowed concerning the transactions of
l Harper as shown by the books
In the Harper trial today Howard

Maurice Rosenfeld of Chicago testi
fied concerning his dealings with
Wilshire Eckert Co He recognized
accoants curreatwith them for thepur
chase of about 500000 bushels of wheat
His house received 389000 in money
The sensation of the day was the tes
timony of Frank M Hayes an expert
who had been sent here by the govern
ment to assist in the prosecution of the
case He said he was an expert ac
countant and had about ten
years experience in banks us
all positions up to assistant
caehier he had made careful examina
tion of the books of the Fidelity Na
tional Bank of the First National
Bank of New York and of the Chem
cal National Bank so far as they re
late to the dealing with Harper and the
Fidelity Bank He had also examined
the accounts of Irwin Green Co
and C J Kershaw Co with refer
ence to their dealings with Harper and
the Fidelity National Bank He said
he found a charge ticket at the
Fidelity one of 200000 a credit to E
L Harper and a charge against the
Firsttfational Bank of New York and
another of the same kind and a third
for 100000 Then on March 17 there I
was one crediting Harper with 300000
t and charging the Chemical National
Bank of New York with the same
amount From his examination of the
books of the First NationalBank he
found no such credits or charges and
4 no money subject to the draft of the Fi
y delity Bank In the case of the Chemical
Y National Bank the Fidelity had a credit
hero by reason of certificates of deposit
forwarded to them but that the certifi
cate entered on the books of the Fidelity
and the First Natianal had two ac
counts with the Fidelity one showed
credits to the Fidelity the other over
drafts By reference to both it appears
that the Fidelity had to its credit March
11887 but 9000 One of the accounts
at that time ehowcd a credit of 209003
The other showed overdrafts to the
nmonnt of 200000 On April 1st these
two accounts were consolidated when
3 There was 5832 to the credit of
the Fidelity on the books of the First
National Bank of New York On April
30th there was to the credit of the
Fidelity 100000 on the books of the
First National of New York by reason
of two certificates of deposit for 200
000 each but these certificates of deposit
were not entered on the Fidelitys
books Previous to this time Harper
was credited with 400000 and thus the
books of the two banks were made to
agree Turning to the Chemical Na
tional Bank he said their books showed
that the Fidelity had a credit of a 300
000 marked loan indicating that the
Fidelity had borrowed that amount
but on the Fidelitys books there is
nothing to indicate the loan Instead
a certificate of deposit lor 300030 is
issued and the stub is marked can
celled Mr Hayes then traced from
day to day how Harpers credits had
been exhausted by drafts etc and that
all went to persons Interested in the
wheat deal The showing was minute
nnd in detail He followed out the en
tire 800 000 in this way showfng that
of this sum there remained to his
credit on March 17th but 459120
Returning to the First National he said
the draft record showed a draft by the
Fidelity on the First National for 100
000 The First National never paid that
draft but Harpers account in the
Fidelity is charged April 14th with
4 10000 and this made the books
agree The witness stated that two
drafts drawn April 28th and 30th for
100000 each were not entered on the
Fidelitys books until June 18th al
though one of them was paid in New
York on May 4th Hayes then took
up the accounts of Irwin Green Co
and stated that the Fidelitys books did
not show such credits to their accounts
as the letters of advice indicated
Irwiu Green d Co credited Hoyt
with 340000 all this except 2932
was drawn out by Harpers checks
There was no entry of the letters of
credit to Hoyt amounting to 235000
until June 10th to 13th C J Kershaw
Co were advised by four letters of
credit that Hoyt had deposited to their
credit 201 000 Kershaws books credit
Harper with four amounts 50000
each corresponding in date to the let
ters of credit The witness went on to
show that this 200000 was absorbed in
the wheat deal Thtre was really but
761 actually put to the credit of Ker
shaw in the Fidelity Bank Harpers
Attorneys made no effort to obscure the
light being thrown on their clients I

of troops on the Russian frontier says
it is evident that the force of Russian
troops now in Poland is not sufficient to

PARIS December 7According to
private advices from Warsaw the
massing of Russian troops on the
frontier is attributable to information
received by Russia of a concerted plan
by Grmany and Austria for nui ed
action in the event of war between
either those powers and Russia In
that contingency it was proposed that
Germany and Austria should suddenly
Invade Russian Poland and occupy
Warsaw by using greater facilities for
mobilizing In consequence ofthe dis
covery of this alleged project Russia
resolved to compensate for her slow
power of mobilizing by the permanent
increase of her frontier forces The
movement implies no aggression but

Blaine on5tbo Message
NEW YORK December 7The Tribune i
tomorrow will contain a long interview
with Hon James G Blaine on Presi
dent Clevelands message He Bays
I I have been reading an abstractof the
Presidents message and have been es
p cially intereste1 in the comments of
the London papers The papers all as
sume to declare that the message is a
free trade manifesto and evidently are
anticipating an enlarged market lor
English fabrics the United Sates as
a consequence of the Presidents recom
uiendanon Perhaps that fact stamps
the character of the message more
clearly than words can II
Yon dont mean actual free trade
without duty inquired the reporter
No replied Blaine nor do th °
London papers mean that they simply
mean that the President has rec
ommended what in the United
States is known as a reyenue
tariff rejecting the protective fea
ture as an object and not even
permitting protection to result freely as
an incident to revenue duties
I dont know that I quite compre
hend that last point said the reporter
I mean said Blaine that for the I
first time in the history of the United
States the President recommends re
taining the internal tax in order that
the tariff may be forced down even
below a fair revenue standard He
recommends that the tax on tobacco be
ret iuerl and thus that many millions
annually shall be levied on domestic
aroduuts which would far better come
from tariff on foreign fabrics
hen do you mean to imply that
you w uld favor the repeal of theto
bacco tax
Certainly I mean just that said
Mr Blaine I should urge that it be
done at once even before the Christ
mas holidays It would in the first
place bring great relef to growers of
tobacco all over the country and
would moreover materially lessen the
price of that article to the consumer
Tobacco to millions of men is a neces
sity The President calls it a
luxury It is well to remember
that a luxury of yesterday be
comes a necessity of today
Watoh the number of men at
work on farms in coal mines along
railroads in iron foundries or in any
calling and you will find 95 to 100 chew
ing whSje they work After each meal
the same proportion seek the solace of
the pipe or cigar These men not only
pay millions of tobacco tax but pay an
enhanced price which tax enables the
manufacturers and ictallers tj impose
Tho only excuse for such tax is actual
necessity under which government
found itself during the war and the
years immediately following To retain
the tax now in order to destroy
protection which would incidentally
low from raising an amount of money
on foreign imports is a most extraordin
ary policy for our government
Well then Mr Blaine would you
advise the repeal of the whisky tax
No I would not Other considera
ions than those ot financial administra
tlon are to be taken into account with
regard to whisky There is a moral
side to it To cheapen the price of
whisky is to Increase the consumption
enormously There would be no sense
in urging a reform wrought by high
license in many States if the national
government neutralizes the good effect
by making whisky within the reach of
every one at 20 cents a gallon It would
destroy the nigh license at once in all
the States Whisky has done a vast
deal of harm in the United States I
would try to make it do some good I
would use the tax to fortify our cities
on the seaboard In yiew of the power
ful letter addressed to toe Democratic
party on the subjectof fortifications by
Samhel J Tilden in 1835 I am amazed
that no attention has been paid to the
subject by the Democratic administra
tion Never before in the world has
any government allowed great cities
on the seaboard to remain defenseless
But said the reporter you dont
think we are to have war in any direc
tion
Certainly not but we should
change the remote chance into an ab
solute impossibility
liufc would our fortifying now pos
sibly It ok as if we expected war
Why should it any more than the
fortifications made by our grandfathers
when hey guarded themselves against
successful attacks from the armaments
of that day We dont necessarily ex
pect burglar because we lockour door
at night
But after fortifications are con
structed would you still maintain the
tax on whisky
Yes so long as there is whisky to
tax I would tax it and when the
national government should have no use
for the money I would divide the tax
among Federal union with the snecific
object of lightening the tax on real
estate If ultimately relief could be
given in that direction it would in my
judgment be a wise and bereficial
policy Some honest but misguided
Friends of temperance have ur ed that
government should not use mo cy
derived from the tax on whisky My
reply is that the tax on whisky by the
Federal government and consequent
enhancement of price has been a
powerful agent in temperance reform
by putting it beyonu the reach
of eo many The amount of
whisky consumed in the United States
per capita is not more than 40 per cent
of that 1snmed thirty years ago
In my judgment the whisky tax
should be so modified as to permit
those who use cure alcohol in the arts
or mechanical pursuits to have it free
in all such cases The tax could be
omitted without danger of fraud just
I
J
y
as now he tax on spirits exported is
remitted
Besides your general and sweeping
opposition to the Presidents recom
mendation have you any further spe
cific objections
Yes answered Mr Blaine
I should seriously object to
the repeal of the duty on wool To
repeal that would work great injustice
to many interests and would seriously
discourage what we should eurcvtly
encourage namely sheep culture
among farmers throughout the Union
To break down wool growing and be
dependent on foreign countries for the
blankets under which we sleep and
coats that cover our backs is not a
wise policy for the national government
to enforce
to Do you thi k if the Presidents re
commendationswero adopted it would
increase our export trade
to Possibly on some few articles of pe i
culiar construction it might but it I
would increase our import trade ten
fold as much in the great staple fabrics
in woolen and cotton in iron and steel
in all a thousand and one shapes in
which they are wrought How are we
to export the staple fabrics to the mar
kets of Europe unless we make them
I cheaper than they do in Europe And
how are we to manufacture them
cheaper unless we get cheaper labor
than they have
Do you think the question of labor
underlies the whole subject
Of course it does replied Mr
Blaine It is in fact the entire ones
tion Whenever we can force carpen
ters masons ironworkere and me
chanics in every department to work as
cheaply and live as poorly in the
United States as similar workmen in
Europe we can of course manufacture
as cheaply as they do in England and
France But I am totally opposed to a
policy that would entail such results
To attempt it is equivalent to a social
and financial revolution one that would
bring untold distress
Yes but might noc the great
farming class be benefited by importing
articles from Europe instead of buying
them at higher prices at houie
The moment answered Mr Blaine
you begin to import freely from Europe
you drive our own workmen from
mechanical and manufacturing pur
suits In the same proportion they be
come tillers of tile sou increasing
steadily the agricultural product and
decreasing steadily the large home de
mand which is certainly enlarging as
the home manufacturers enlarge
That of course works a great injury to
the farmer glutting the market with
his products and tending constantly
to lower the prices
Yea but the foreign demand for
farm products would be increased in
like Tatio would it not 1
Even suppose it were said Blaine
how do you know from which sourca
twill be supplied The tendency in
Russia today and the Asiatic possessions
sessions of England is toward a large
increase of the grain supply grain
being raised by the cheapest possible
labor Manufacturing countries will
buy breadstuff where they get them
the cheapest and the enlarging of the
home market for the American farmer
being checked he would search in vain
for one of the same value His foreign
sales are alrca y checked by the
great competition abroad There never
wae a time when an increase of a
large home market was so valuable to
him The best proof is that far ers
are prosperous and in proportion to
the nearness of the manufacturing
countries and a protective tariff tends
to spread manufacturers in Ohio and
Indiana For example though not
classed as manufacturing States the
annual value of tabrics is larger than
the annual value of agricultural pro
ducts to
But those holding the Presidents
views remarked the reporter are
always quoting the great prosperity of
the country under the tariff of 1846
That tariff did not involve the one
destructive point recommended by the
President namely the retain
ing of direct internal taxes
in order to abolish the indirect
taxes levied on foreign fabrics
but the country Had peculiar advan
tages by the Ciimean war involving
England France and Russia and
largely impairing their trade All these
incidents or accidents if you choose
were immensely stimulating to the
trade in the United States regardless of
the nature of our tariff But mark the
end of this European experience with
the tariff of 1846 which for a time gave J
an illusory and deceptive show of
prosperity Its enactment was imme
diately followed by the Mexican war
then in 1848 by the great convulsions
of Europe then in 1849 and succeeding
years bv the enormous gold yield
of California The Powers made
peace in 1850 nnd at the same
time the output of gold in California
fell off Immediately the financial
panic of 1857 came upon the country
with disastrous force though we had
in these years mined a vast amount of
gold in California Every bank in New
York was compelled to suspend specie
payment Four millions in gold had
been carried out of the country in eight
years to pay for foreign goods that
should have been manufactured at
home we had years of depression and
distress atonement for II
as an our folly
It is remarkable that Pres
President Polk racommended the tariff
of 1846 on precisely the same grounds
that President Cleveland recommends a
similar enactment now Mr Polk in
sisted on emptying the Treasury by a
free trade tariff then rushed the
country into debt by borrowing 150
000000 for the Mexican war
Do you mean to Imply that there
should be no reduction of the national
revenue
No What I have said implies the
reverse I would reduce it bya prompt
repeal of the tobacco tax and would
make here and there some changes in
the tariff not to reduce proJec ion but
to wiselyfosterit
Would you explain your meaning
more fully
hI mean that no great system of
revenue like our tariff can operate
with efficiency and equality unless the
chang s of trade be closely watched
and the law promptly adapted to those
I changes But I would make no change
that should impair the character of the
whole body of the tariff Four years I
ago in the act of 1883 we made changes
of the character I have tried indicate
If such changes were made and the 1
fortifying of our seacoaav thus under
takin no surplus would be found after
that already accumulated had been dis
posed of
But what about the existing sur
plus f
The abstract of the message that I
have seen replied Blaine contains no
reference to tnat point I theretoie
make no comments further than to In
dorse Fred Grants
remarks that a
surplus is always easier to handle than
a deficit
The reporter repeated the question
whether the Presidents recommenda
tion would not if adopted give ug the
advantage of a large increase lnex
ports
hI only repeat answered Blaine
that it would 7astly enlarge our
imports while the only export
it would seriously increase would
be our gold and silver That would
t f w out bounteously just as it
r l under tho tariff of 1S4G The Pres
luents recommendation enacted into
law would result in making way for
a deluge inflow of fabrics to the de
struction of home industry
Mr Blaine thought it was important
to increase our export trade but it ia
vastly more important not to lose our
own great market for our own people in
the vam effort to reach an im
possibility It is not our foreign trade
that hasoaused the wonderful growth
and expansion of the republic It is
the vast domestic trade The whole
amount of our export and import
trade together would never ha
thought reach 1900000000 in any one
year The internal home trade reaches
the enormous annual aggregate of mc e
than 40OOOOCO000 and perhaps thin
year OOOOOOOOO It is into this in
imitable trade even now in its infancy
and destined to attain a magnitude
not dreamed of twenty years ago
that Europeans are struggling to
enter It is the heritage of
the American people of their children
and their childrens children It gives
absolutely free trade over territory
nearly as large a s nil Europe and a
profit on all our own President Cleve
and now plainly proposes a policy
that will admit Europe to a share of
this trade
Mr Blaine is in favor of extending
our foreign trade In all practical and
advantageous ways but not on the
principle of free traders by which we
snail be constantly exchanging dollars
for dimes
Asked how the Presidents message
will be taken south Blaine said he dared
not answer that question The truth
has been so long obscured by certain
local questions and unreasoning pre
judice that nobody can hope for in
dustrial enlightinent among their lead
ers just yet But in his view the south
above all sections of the Union
needs a protective tariff He did think
the Presidents recommendation to ad
mit raw material will find strong sup
porters by wise protectionists in oar
time Should that recommendation of
the President be approved it would
turn 100000 American laborers out of
employment before it had been a year
n operation
The marked and general effect of the
Presidents message Mr Blaine
thought will bring the country where
it ought to be brought to a full and
fair contest the question of protec
tion The President himself makes it
one issue by presenting no other in his
message The Democratic party in
power is a standing menace to the in
dustrial prosperity of the country
That menace should be removed or
the policy it foreshadows should be
made certain There is nothing so
mischievous to business as uncertainty
