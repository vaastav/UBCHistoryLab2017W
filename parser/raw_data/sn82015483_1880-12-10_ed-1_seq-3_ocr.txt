Land League Tactics In Ulster Terror-
Ism maid Lawlessness .Bajreotting A p-
plled to the Constabulary A New Peril
tor Parnell. -
London, Dec. 9. A Dublin dispatch to the
Times says :
The Land League is conducting the campaign in
the North with considerable skill, modifying its pro
gramme and proceedings to avoid offending the pre
judices of the people of Ulster. In that province
there is quite a ounerent tone in weir speeches rrom
that prevailing in other parts of the country, with the
view of conciliating Presbyterians, Liberals and
Orangemen. The system of 'Baycotting' has been ap
plied to six detachmeutB of constabulary in different
parts of Ireland."
The government has ordered accommoda-
dation for one hundred and fifty soldiers to
be prepared at Ballina, Ireland, where a lady,
a landowner, was recently mobbed and as
saulted in the street.
Any two magistrates can bind over per
sons whom they have reason to suspec of
even an intention to participate in unlawful
proceedings or assembly, or in case of re
fusal to be bound over they can commit them
to jail. They can bind over any person
whom they believe can give evidence relative
to such proceedings, and if they refuse to be
bound over to give evidence they can commit
them to jaiL The correspondent of the
Time at Dublin, commenting on this, says :
"The truth is the magistrates, agents and
landlords generally are panic-stricken, and do
not venture to enforce the law. A prosecu
tion brought by the Attorney General at Bal
linsloe, and another in Sligo, have broken
down, which has had a discouraging effect.
There is also a difficulty about treating Land
League meetings as unlawful assemblies. The
magistrates do not feel justified in regarding
the threat to 'Baycott' as coming within the
act, as it does not imply violence."
The London correspondent of the Leeds
Mercury says he hears that the law officers
are considering Mr. Farnell's recent speech
at Waterford, and it is not improbable that
be may be indicted on a distinct and separate
charge in connection with that speech.
Mr. bhaw-Leievre, the new Commissioner
of Works and Buildings, who is universally
recognized as holding the most liberal views
on the subject of Irish land, and who has
said that he was advanced to his present post
specially with a view to the services he could
render in debates on the land question, in
his speech at Beading last night said that
ownership was the highest degree of se
curity known to the law, but there were
manr degrees of security for tenants
short of this which might be capable of more
immediate application, rue formation of a
class of peasant proprietors, he said, must nec
essarily be slow, unless w are prepared to ex
propriate the landlords at our own price. It
would be easy to show that this oould not be
for the benefit of Ireland. It would multi
ply the evils of absenteeism five-fold, and
would result in not only a fifth to but all the
rent of Ireland being sent out of Ireland in
the shape of interest on purchase money. A
system of extended ownership could not last
if it had its origin in confiscation and robbery.
Whatever rs aone mast te witn every regard
to the rights or compensation of the landlord.
He said he had no sympathy with the plans
of intimidating and the violent methods of the
Land League. They had set up a govern
ment in opposition to that of the Queen, and
this was a state of things which could not be
allowed to continue.

A Sad Case of Eviction An Old Man Kl
pires in the Arms ofthe Process Servers.
Dublin, Dec. 9. A special last night from
Monaghan to thf Dublin Express says the
greatest excitement prevailed at Monaghan.
Lord EoBsmore was accompanied by Lord
Mandeville, who will assist at the anti-League
meeting. Mandeville telegraphed to his agent
at Fortadown to send one thousand men to
Scotstown without delay. Another telegram
was dispatched to the district grand master
of the Orangemen of Armagh to send ten
thousand men. A similar dispatch was sent
to Lord Crichton to send one thousand men
from Fermnagh. These are certain to ar
rive, and the number will be more than
doubled by men from Monaghan and the sur
rounding neighborhood. The . men will be
supplied with some means of defense. The
most active eff orts are being made by the con
stitutional party to make the meeting a suc
cess. - The assemblage will be the most for
mal and perhaps the most dangerous to the
peace that has been witnessed in Ulster for
some years. If the.- Ulster landlords take
pattern by the example set them by Lords
Bossmore, Mandeville and Crichton . the
Leasruers would have little to say in Ulster.

An attempt was made to strangle one bum
van, a process server, near Skibbareen. Law
lessness in Cork is increasing to an alarming
extent.
A sad and dramatic eviction took place in
county Wicklow yesterday. An - old man
named Arthur xlavanagh, in feeble neaitn,
who had a cabin on the property of Earl
Fitz william, had fallen behind in his rent. A
decree of ejectment was obtained by the Earl
at the last Wicklow Sessions. His game
keeper, with two bailiffs, went to execute the
decree yesterday afternoon. They had to
carry Kavanagh out of the house, and as he
was crossing me tnresnoia oz ms caDin me
poor old man gave one gasp and died in the
gamekeeper's arms. His body was laid by
the road. Over it for hours sat his only
mourner, a granddaughter. Kavanagh was
formerly in a good position. He had been
unable to work for two years, and was bed
ridden for some time.
An immense land meeting was held at

Congressional Legislation The Electoral
Connt A Lobs; Debate Expected The
Proposed . Honor to , General Grant
The Coateiat for Senator "Wallace's
Beat General - Garfield's Senatorial
Office Contested Election Cases. .
Washihotoh, Dee. 9.-There is no telling
how long the debate on the electoral count
resolution will run. Mr. F. Wood again tried
to-day to bring the House to an agreement
with reference- to closing the discussion. He
wanted to know how long the gentlemen
on the other side proposed to disturb the pub
lic business. - No answer was vouchsafed.
The House Committee on Military Affairs
will on ' Tuesday next consider General
MeCook'i bfll to place General Grant on the
retired list of the army. This bill has cre
ated considerable discussion among Senators
and Representatives. Some Democrats op
pose the bill on the. ground ' that . General
Grant took an active part in the recent presi
dential election. It is believed, however,
that enough Democrats will unite with the
Republicans to secure favorable consideration
of the measure. ! " l ' ' "' '. "",
: A gentleman whose nomination to a judi
cial position wiU be sent to the Senate soon
test evening called Judge Strong's -attention
to the publication in the dispatches of his in
tended resignation. "It is practically cor
rect," said Judge Strong. 'In a very short
time I will be off tbe bench.n
In speaking of the Pennsylvania Senator-
ship to-night, Senator Wallace said that while
he regarded Hon. Galusha A. Grow as lead
ing in the "contest, yet in the event of any
combinations that would operate disad van-
tageously for the ex-Speaker he thought his
successor would most probably be c Hon.
Thomas M. Bayne, representing the Twenty-
third Pennsylvania district in . Congress.
When reminded that ft had been rumored
here for some days that Governor Moyt was
developing much strength in the direction of
the Senatorship, he replied that he did not
think that the Governor would enter the lists
at all, as the information received from Har
risburg to-day indicated such a determination
on his part.
The credentials of General Garfield as Senator-elect
from Ohio are still among the arch
ives of the Senate. It is expected though that
within a day or two General Garfield will
by letter request the Vice President to return
the same to him so he may return them
through the Governor of Ohio to the Legis
lature. In thus returning the credentials the
General will also transmit a letter declining
the Senatorial office to which he had been
elected. Senator Pendleton, in a conversa
tion on the subject of the vacancy which will
be caused by General Garfield's declination,
said he was clearly of the opinion that the
Legislature could legally proceed to elect a
successor to Senator Thurman ten days after
it received the notice of President-elect Gar
field's declination. He had carefully studied
the law concerning the case and his opinions
based on the result of a very laborious re
search of all the legal authorities bearing on
the subject.
The Committee of Ways and Means held a
meeting to-day to consider the recommenda
tions made by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue in his anuual report. A majority of
the committee were of the opinion that the
present law relating to the adhesive stamp
tax upon proprietary medicines, cosmetics,
bank checks and deposits, &c., should be
modified. At the same time it was felt it
would be impossible to do anything on the
subject at the present session. The subject
was referred, however, to the Committee
on Internal Revenue, of which Mr. Carlisle
is chairman.
Congressman Hurd intends if possible to
secure action in some manner this session on
his bill, the supplement of which is an act to
establish regulations as to imported goods in
bond and with duties paid and for other pur
poses. Mr. Hurd's bill was intended to pre
vent discrimination against certain "railroad
lines and the trading public in the matter of
transportation of goods through Canada. The
bill provides that it shall be unlawful f orUnited
States customs officers to seal any car in
which goods, wares or merchandise
shall have been placed to be transported from
one point or place in the United States to an
other point or place in Canada. The bill also
levies a duty of 80 per cent, ad valorem upon
every railroad car manufactured in the Do
minion of Canada and brought into the United
States. In conversation this morning Mr.
Hurd said if he could not secure action on
his bill this session he had another plan in
mind by which he thought he could accom
plish Ms purpose. The abrogation of the
treaty of Washington would do away with all
the unjust and discriminating regulations in
force in the Dominion. With reference to
American lake ports he said he contemplated
offering a resolution directing the President
to give notice to Great Britain of the inten
tion of the United States to abrogate the
treaty of Washington. Mr. Hurd believed
that the New England representatives who
represent the people that have suffered on
account of the persecutions of American fish
ermen would vote for such a resolution. A
new treaty could then be made which would
not only regulate the fisheries, but adequate
ly protect the interests of lake ports border
ing on Canada.
. There are nine contested election cases re
maining to be decided by the House. Some
of them will probably never be heard of. Mo
brief has been filed in the contest of Harrison
against Shelly of the Fourth Alabama dis
trict. The evidence adduced by Mr. .Harri
son is meagre, and the case will probably
neverbe brought before the House. There
are two reports in the case of Bixbee against
Hull, of the Second Florida district. The
majority report is in favor of the sitting mem
ber, Mr. Hull. Mr. McCole, who is contest
ing the seat of Mr. Orth, from the Ninth
Indiana district, has - asked for more time
in which to file evidence. It is not believed
that Mr. McCole will make out a case, and
the contest will hardly be brought before the
House. Messrs. Merchant and Herbert gave
notice of their intention to contest the seat of
Mr. Acklen, of the Third Louisana district,
but they have failed to present any evidence
and the contest will probably be dropped.
The committee is ready to report in favor of
the sitting member in the contest of Boynton
vs. Loring, of the Sixth Massachusetts dis
trict. No report has yet been made in the
celebrated Donnelly-Washburne case.
The Electoral Connt A Republican Cau
cus A Policy of Active Opposition to
the Morgan Resolution.
Washington, Dec. 9. The Republican
Representatives and Senators in joint caucus
to-night decided unanimously to oppose the
passage of the Morgan joint rule by every
parliamentary device. There was some dif
ference of opinion in the caucus held last
night by Republican Representatives alone
on the question of filibustering to defeat the
Morgan resolution. The exponents of the
extreme theory were in a small minority, and
they did not seem to be very firmly grounded
in their suggestions for conservative action.
The fact that there was a difference of opin
ion, however, led to the call for a joint
caucus at 7:30 this evening. There was a
large attendance of Republican Congressmen.
Senator Anthony was made chairman of the
caucus and Townsend of Ohio secretary. Mr.
Conger briefly stated the object of the joint
caucus. He said that the question presented
for decision was whether the representatives
of the party should resist the passage of the
"infamous Morgan resolution." Mr. Conger
was decidedly of the opinion that it should
not be allowed to pass. He explained that
on the evening previous in the caucus of
Republican Representatives Judge Lapham,
of New York, had offered a resolution which
he believed met the approbation of a
majority ot those present. Judge
Lapham's resolution was read. After
a preamble reciting the belief that
the Morgan resolution was unconstitutional
this resolution pledges the Republicans to
resist its passage by every means known to
parliamentary law. Mr. Robeson made one
of the principal speeches of the evening. He
avowed the belief that the Morgan rule origi
nated as a . part of a scheme to count in a
Democratic President in the event of a close
election. He outlined the position assumed
by the Republican Representatives in oppos
ing the resolution and pointed out what he
claimed were inconsistent and incongruous
features of the resolution. He believed the
resolution to be unconstitutional and revolu
tionary, and thought that its passage should
be firmly resisted. Senator Blaine made a
speech which elicited great applause. It was
ringing and stalwart in tone. After criticising
the resolution he spoke of the old twenty
second joint rule which had been cited
by the Democrats as a precedent for
the new rule they now proposed
to enact. Blaine denied " that the
old twenty-second rule was a precedent
for anything. . He claimed that the rule was
rendered extinct and disposed of as a prece
dent by the creation of the electoral commis
sion, a tribunal in the creation of which
both Democrats and Republicans had a hand.
He maintained that the proposed rule was
dangerous, because . it was at variance w ith
the theory of the framers of the constitution
that Congress should not have the power to
elect a President, v
Speeches were also made by Messrs. Keif-
er, Lapham, Teller, Saunders, Ferry, Robe
son, Hisoock, Conger, Burnsido, . Hawley,
Haskell and Butterworth. These gentlemen
were all of the opinion that the electoral rule
implied a usurpation of power on the part of
Congress in assuming the right to count the
electoral vote. , The Lapham resolution was
finally adopted without a dissenting voice.
FORTY-SIXTH CONGRESS.
f - Washington, Dec. 9.
Senate. On motion of Mr. Pendleton, of
Ohio, so much of the President a annual
message as refers to civil service reform, non
assessment of government clerks for political
purposes, etc., was referred to the select
committee to examine the several branches
of the civil service - with instructions to re
port at an early day by bill or otherwise.
Mr. Pendleton introduced a joint resolu
tion for the purpose of obtaining the privi
lege of opening a, road -and highway from
the Canada line of the United States and
British America through British Columbia to
Fort Wrangell and Sitka in Alaska. Referred
to Committee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. Randolph gave notice that immediately
after the morning hour on Monday ne would
call up the bfll for the relief of Fitz John
Porter, and desired to call the attention of
the Senators to the amendment offered by
him yesterday.
Mr. Plumb reported the bill to extend the
time for filing claims for horses and equip
ments lost by officers and enlisted men in the
service of the United States.' The time for
filing these claims expired in 187;. The bill
was opposed by -Messrs. Thurman,; Kern an
and others, on the ground" that the govern
ment could not now obtain rebutting evidence
where false or irregular claims were present
ed. Without disposing of the bill the Sen
ate,-on motion of Mr. Ferry, at 2:45 p. in.
went into executive session and five minutes
later adjourned to Monday.
Houhb. Mr. Baker, from the Committee
on Appropriations, reported the fortification
appropriation bill and it was ordered printed
and recommitted. It appropriates $100,000
for the protection and repair of fortifications,
$400,000 for the armament, etc., of fortifica
tions and $50,000 for the purchase of torpe
does. 1
The House then resumed consideration of
the Senate concurrent resolution relative to
the electoral count. Mr. McLane, after read
ing the twelfth article of the Constitution,
said it gave an express grant to both houses
of Congress to count the votes. He doubt
ed whether many men on the other side
would take the position, of Mr. Robeson,
that the power to count the votes
is - vested in the vice Jfresiusnt
bv -the Constitution : that the theory has
never been seriously accepted in the history
of the country. Nor could the theory be ac
cepted that Congress could constitute a tri
bunal to count and declare the result of the
electoral votes for President and Vice Presi
dent. Congress did once by law establish a
tribunal, and the count made under it would
stand as a monument of disgrace. That tri
bunal, McLane argued, was established after
pressure because the country had an Execu
tive who proposed to use the army and navy
even to defeat the will of the people. It
was under such a pressure that the
gentlemen agreed to pass that law. But
nearly all men of any distinction expressed
regret that they should be called on to vote
for such a law establishing such an exception
al President, and authorized another body to
perform a duty which devolved on the two
houses of Congress. As a proof that the
authority of the two houses of Congress to
count the votes had been heretofore recog
nized, Mr. McLane referred". to the fact that
Mr. Lincoln in a message to Congress remon
strated against being called upon to share the
responsibility of declaring the result of the
presidential election. That message was one
of the acts which the gentleman from New
Jersey would like to wipe out. Mr. McLane
then made a long argument to show that un
der article 12 of the Constitution the two
houses counted the vote.
A long and tedious discussion ensued as to
the operation of the proposed joint rule in
reference to its action on the vote of States,
the Republicans contending that under the
proposed rule one house really determined
the result in each State ; while the Democrats
argued that it required the concurrent action
of both houses to receive or reject a vote,
and that they regarded it as the fairest solu
tion ofjthe question. Mr. Lapham, ofjNew York,
expressed the belief that the Democrats had
some ulterior object or they would not press
this matter with such pertinacity. He gave
notice that he would resort to all parliament
ary expedients to defeat it. He insisted upon
the right of the Vice President to - count the
vote, claiming that no Vice President would
ever defeat the will of the people. He did
not regard it as possible to count a fraudu
lent vote. In the course of his remarks he
referred to the quotation by the Democrats
of Mr. Lincoln's message on this subject, and
intimated that they had no right to quote
Mr. Lincoln, as they had regarded him as a
mere rail splitter.
Mr. Herbert, of Alabama, in reply denied
that there was the least occasion to impute
ulterior or bad objects to the Democrats. Me
admitted the election of General Garfield, but
said the Democrats wanted to establish the
fact that the Vice President should not count
the vote. Referring to Mr. Lapham's re
mark about Mr. Lincoln's message, ha claimed
that no section of the country had more re
spect for Mr. . Lincoln's memory than the
South, and they regarded his assassination as
one of the greatest evils that could have be
fallen that section.
Mr. Newbury, of Michigan, closed the
day's debate, arguing in favor of the right of
the Vice President to count the vote, and at
the close of his speech the House adjourned.
UEW YORK.
The Combination Against Kelly Politi
cal Circles in a Stew.
New Yokk, Dec. 9. The excitement in
political circles over the combination to con
firm the heads of departments to-morrow at
the meeting of the Board of Aldermen con
tinued unabated to-day. The City Hall pre
sented a Evely appearance and all tbe prom
inent politicians of both factions were dis
cussing the latest information. The friends
of Mr. Kelly seemed in better spirits than
yesterday and were willing to wager even
terms that the combination had been broken.
The Republican leaders are not agreed over
the combination and held a caucus this after
noon to decide whether the combination will
be kept or not. It is stated on good authori
ty that Mayor Cooper will not include among
his nominations to-morrow a candidate for
Comptroller out of courtesy to Mr. Kelly.
The Mayor has intimated that he will hold
back for a week or so the nomination of a
candidate for the Coniptrollership. Those
opposed to Kelly say that a combination in
some shape or other will be formed and suc
cessfully, notwithstanding whtt is said. The
wnole thing rests on the action of the Repub
lican caucus.
Arrival of the Steamer Victoria.
New Yokk, Dec. 9. The overdue steamer
Victoria, of the Anchor Line, from London
November 14 for New York, arrived off Sandy
Hook at 1 o'clock this afternoon having in

FIRE RECORD.
A Variety Theatre Destroyed.
St. Louis, Dec. 9. At 12:30 p. m. to
day Manager Smith, of the Theatre Comique,
discovered fire under the stage of the theatre.
The water had been turned off owing to some
repairs and the hose was useless, and by the
timo the tiro department had arrived all hopes
of saving it were gone. The whole interior
was gutted and the costumes of the large va
riety troupe playing there were destroyed.
The loss on decorations and stage fixtures
will be about 8,000, insurance unknown.
The fire was confined to the theatre. The
property is in litigation. It was sold two
years ago for $40,000, subject to a $15,000
mortgage. It is one of the oldest theatres in
the city.
Fire at Springfield, Mass. Heavy Losses
of Manufacturers.
Spbingfield, Mass!, Dec. 9. The most dis
astrous fire which has visited this city for a
long time occurred this morning on Taylor
stieet, in the heart of the small manufactur
ing business part of' the city. After the fire
was pronounced extinguished it broke out
again, and the damage by the second
fire was greater than that by the first. The
losses are estimated ' at $100,000, the
largest of which are sustained by the follow
ing : Wason Manufacturing company, $10,
000 on building ; Ray fc Taylor, paper col
lar manufacturers, $30,000; Blair & Fiske,
lawn implement manufacturers, $15,000 ; C.

Seymour, paper dox manufacturer, $5,000.
Several other firms lose from $10,000 to $30,
000 each. Most of these parties are well in
sured, and the larger losses are fully covered.
Chief Engineer Leshire and several firemen
were injured more or less severely.

Receipts and Expenses.
The annual report of the County Commis
sioners was completed and signed by them
yesterday, and a copy will be forwarded to
the Secretary of State. The document is one
that will be read with interest. It will be
seen that the debt of the county has been re
duced $1,000 since the last report, when the
balance on hand was only $77.91. The bal
ance remaining in the treasury is $1,524.20,
which is also a manifest gain over that re
ported on hand one year ago. With a few
years of such efficient management the coun

Women's Christian Association.
At the weekly meeting of the Y. W. C. A.,
held last evening at Association Hall, there
was a good number of ladies of the city
present, and evident interest manifested in the
work of thisiew organization. The new
officers elected last week assumed their do
ties at this meeting," Mrs, Heman B. Allen
presiding, and Miss L. R. Bliss taking the
nrantfnn rfmri i n u aecretarv. After sing
ing, Miss Ferguson, formerly missionary to
Snuih A fr-ia n-ffarAd nrftver. and the follow
ing business was transacted by the associa
tion : A finance committee of five or more
persons was authorized, appointments to be
made by the executive board. By the recon
sideration of a vote of a previous meeting,
the appointment of a committee in each of
the churches to solicit new members and
also subscriptions was referred to the execu
tive board. It was also understood that the
names of new members may be presented by
any member oi me association. The pres
ent membership is over one hundred and
fifty. From the executive board, who have
already held two meetings, it was reported
to the association that after full consideration
of the matter of appointment of a general
secretary for the association, there being
several applications for the place, it was
unanimously decided to ask Miss M. A. Ford,
one of the members of the board and not an
applicant for the place, to endeavor to ar
range her present business, if . possible so
that she could accept this position to which
the ladies of the executive board have elected
her. We understand that Miss Ford has the
matter under consideration, and it is hoped
will be able to engage in the responsible du
ties expected of her by the time rooms for
the use of the association are secured and
furnished. The appointment of committees
on the furnishing of rooms, employment and
on boarding houses was considered by the
members present, and after an interesting
discussion of these subjects, with suggestions
byitev. Mr. Mossman, city missionary, and
Mr. Harned of the Y. M. C. A., the appoint
ment of these committees was referred to the
executive board with favorable recommenda
tion. Hlore Licenses Granted.
