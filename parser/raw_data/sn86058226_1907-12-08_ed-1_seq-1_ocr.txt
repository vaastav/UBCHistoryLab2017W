"Bill," just an ordinary yellow dog,

canine in the city. His soul's affinity.
Judge Henry C. Fox, who was out of
the city two days last week, has re
turned home. From a legal stand
point Bill is not the property of Judge
as his lord and master.
When J Jill met Judge Fox it was a
case of love at first sight, on Bill's

New Congressional Directory
A Most Interesting Volume
Cortelyou Likened as to
King Wang" by Many.
Washington, Dec. 7. The attitude
of congress toward the president's
message now that members h;ive had
an opportunity to study its recommen
dations carefully, may be summed up
as follows: '
Most of his recommendations have
merit in them, but we doubt the wis
dom of attempting to enact them into
law at this session. The advice we
get from our constituents is that the
country wants a rest a sort of
breathing spell. What may be called
the Roosevelt policies will in the main
all be adopted eventually; but with
the financial situation uncertain and
with a presidential election coming on
we think it best to let most of the
president's suggestions wait until the
next session or until a special session
immediately after the presidential el
ection. This, be it understood, is not the
unanimous view of the republicans in
either senate or house by any means.
In each branch are republicans who
are anxious that congress shall pro
ceed at once to carry out practically
all the recommendations the president,
makes. Senator La Follette, for in
stance, savs emphatically that the fi
nancial situation has not influenced
him to abandon his fight for more
drastic railroad legislation.
Sentim-nt in the House.
Over in the house of representatives
perhaps one-third of the republican
members are willing to follow the
president's advice. !
What may be called the old guard
in both senate and house seems to be
fixed in the determination that there

shall not be any legislation inimical
to the business interests of the ro.in.,i
try at this session.

seems improbable hat favorable legis
lation can be put through.
Some far-seeing politicians are dis
posed to predict that if the republi
cans are not careful they will make
a good deal of capital for the demo
crats before the winter is over. It
must be said for the minority that it
seems to have more ginger in it than
it has had for several years.
Directory is Instructive.
The new congressional directory is
a highly instructive volume. The
longest autobiography in it was con
tributed by an Iowa member, Daniel
Webster Hamilton, democrat, of Sig
ourney, who tells how be labored on a
farm- and taught school. As a climax
he says he "married Elvira Gibbons,
a Quakeress and a resident of his
home country and they now have a
Rooseveltian family of nine chidlren."
In spite of the fact that William Alden
went to the senate and George W. of
Illinois died, there are still five
Smiths in the house. The shortest
autobiography is that of Representa
tive Robert Bruce Macon of Arkan
sas, which occupies exactly three lines
and is so condensed that he does not
even give his age. Then there is
Joseph Grant Beale. a new republican
member from Pennsylvania who
claims to be a thoroughbred". This
is what he says: "Mr. Beale's forefath
ers came to this country with William
Penn, so he claims that he is a thor
oughbred Pennsylvanian. and his fore
fathers, as well as himself, have been
born in Pennsylvania until the mem
ory of man does not run to the con
trary." Another new member has
pride of ancestry; this is Represen
tative Richmond Pearson Hobson ofi(jause
Mernmac lame, wno coasts that he
is the tenth in descent from Elder
Brewster of the Mavflower.
Cortelyou Like "King Wang."
Secretary Cortelyou is very much in
the position of the gracious "Kins
Wang," with the difference that In
stead of having an elephant on his
hands he is anxious to acquire infor
mation about three that are some
where in this country under bond of
$1,000. If anybody can identify Rog
er, Tom and Alice, as the pachy
derms have been christened, he will
confer a favor on the secretary of the
treasury by stepping to the front.
Roger, Tom and Alice were introduced
to the customs officials a year ago,
but as those officers were not expert
judges of paehydermul beauty, they
have forgotten Jhe features of the
three big beasts. Th trio has trav
eled much in its day. and the treasury
department says that the beasts are
now in this country under a bond of
the owners, amounting to $1,000, to
pay the duty on them. The owners,
seek to avoid the payment of duty on
the ground that duty was paid ou the
first visit of the elephants to this
country. The owners, however, can
not identify the animals to the satis
faction of the customs officials and
the latter are almost as much at a
loss to accomplish the same result.
Hence Secretary Cortelyou will call
down blessings on the head of the
man who cau help him out.
PUBLIC WHIPPING
FIT PUNISHMENT
FOR WIFE BEATERS
Judge Wm. C. Converse of the
City Court, Says the Pun
ishment Not Harsh Enough
For Fiendish Wife Beaters.
CITY CANNOT PUNISH
BY THIS METHOD THOUGH
Solitary Confinement With
Bread and Water Diet, Is
Good Enough for Such Men
Says Police Sergeant.
Judge W. C. Converse, of thme city
court, believes that a public whipping
post for wife beaters, would be a desir
able thing, but he states that this city
could not authorize such punishment,
owing to the fact that the legislature
provides the methods by which
law
violators shall be punished and as yet
,. , . . 4 , .. ,
the legislature has not seen fit to en-
a law autnorizing pumic wmppin
as a puishment for wife beaters.
Judge Converse made this statement
ed by b.Mng given a public whipping.
Of all the classes of offenders that
appear before Judge Converse, he Is
harshest with wife beaters. A man
convicted f such an act need not look
to Judge Converse for leniency he can
' depend upon a long sentence in
the
even a wife beater, but he says that he
does think such brutes should be pun
ished by hard labor or solitary con
finement on a bread and water diet.
A local newspaper man. who witness
ed the public whipping of a negro at
Georgetown, Delaware, states that pun
ishment is a most cruel one and sick
ens the. person who chances to witness
it. However. Delawareians say that
the punishment has the desired effect
and it is a rare thing when a man once
whipped gives the authorities the op
portunity to punish him by this meth
od a second time.

MINES WILL REMAIN THERE.
Goldfield, Nev., Dec. 7. Tonight all
is in a buzz of excitement over the re
port that on Sunday, four hundred non
unionist strike breakers will 'arrive in
this city to take the place of the strik
ing miners. Knots of sturdy men
stood about discussing tho outlook.
All were armed to the teeth and loud
threats were heard ou every hand
against the incoming miners. Blood
shed will certainly result If they make
their appearance. Leaders of the
"strike attempted to impress upon the
men to keep clear heads and shun liq
uor, as brains would have to be used
on the morrow.
Col. Reynolds and part of the United
States troops who were assigned to
keep order during- the miners' strike,
immediately took possession of ithe
mine properties.
The unionists were in session in the
headquarter at the time, and a dlscus-
jslon of the situation is still, In prog
; ress there. The section of the train
carrying three hundred soldiers did
not reach here till late this afternoon.
Numerous highway robberies and as
saults have been committed in the last
few days. . but no outbreak can be
traced to the miners, who deny respon
sibility for them.
Threats Against Soldiers.
Threats have been made though tha
miners' officials, speaking for tho
membership, repudiate responsibility
for them that the regulars will not
long be left without warfare to keep
them busy.
It has been learned that an attempt
was made Thursday night to dynamite
the line which furnishes power and
light to Goldfield. It failed only be
cause the explosive was frozen and fail
ed to go off. The miners are holding
a series of secret meetings and are al
ready circulating a round robin among
the citizens. Informing President
Roosevelt that troops are not needed.
The report that troops would be or
dered to the camp was at first regarded
by the miners as a "bluff," intended to
intimidate them. President MeKla
non of the local miners' union, a broth-
I er-In-law of William D. Haywood, is la
charge of the miners campaign. Vin

that several buildings had been dyna
