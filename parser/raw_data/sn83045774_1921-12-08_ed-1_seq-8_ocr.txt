Dr. Lorenz Should Stay.
Tt is sincerely to be hoped that Dr.
JtORENz will not permit himself to be
driven away from this country by
the attitude of a few persons who do
not in any way reflect the American
spirit or the ethics of American
medicine.
The great Vienna surgeon is a sensitive
man. Coming here from a country
which before it was dismembered
and reduced to poverty was
one of the Central Powers, he may
have feared that he would encounter
prejudice. That he has met with
none among the masses of the people,
that the American newspapers have
almost without exception hailed him
as a great world figure, are facts of
which he and Americans alike should
be proud.
But a few persons, some of them in
Dr. Lorenz'k own profession, narrowIn
their professional jealousy, have
made slighting remarks. To these
petty manifestations have been added
mutterings to the effect that the great
orthopaedic surgeon was mercenary.
There may have been grafters who
traded on a fictitious association with
Dr. Lorknz. but nobody familiar with
the princely opportunities for fees
v hich he has declined will doubt Dr.
J iOrf.nz h une motives. uii me point
of accepting remuneration there
ould be no more legitimate criticism
of Dr. Lorenz for receiving private
fees for his services than of anyAmerican
physician for taking fees.
Dr. Lorenz announced that he had
come to do certain things and he has
kept his promise. He has given of
all of his strength, even to the verge
of prostration, for humanity.
Dr. Lorenz should not be misled
by the mutterings of the few persons
v.-hom Health Commissioner Copejand
aptly describes as "damn fools."
He should not worry because those
few keep talking about nationalities.
Science and mercy know no boundary
lines. Even assuming that after
three years there remained any American
animosity toward the wreck of
Austria, the visit of Dr. Lorenz went
a great way toward dispelling it: a
longer way than formal treaties of
peace or visits of diplomats could go.
If Dr. Lorenz should be driven
away by the few small minded and
cmvious persons his going would be
the cause of shame to the millions
who appreciate not only his genius
but his fine spirit. The medical profession
of New York, representative
of the best in America, should get
together and hold Dr. Lorenz here,
and as an evidence of their good
feeline and their anoreciation of his
fn*eat work they should give him
such a testimonial as could leave no
doubt of the attitude of the profession
and the people.
New Jersey Protects Bird Life.
It would be difficult to estimate
the amount of good which has been
accomplished in the way of bird conservation
by the National Association
of Audubon Societies, whose
members are found in every part of
the Union.
It has been untiring in work to
preserve the wild bird life of America.
It was organized too late to
save some species from extinction,
notably the passenger pigeon, hut it
has been able to safeguard others
which might have disappeared but
lor the protective influences thrown
about them by the millions of lovers
of nature throughout the TTniteH
State*.
One of the most active of these
hint protective bodies has been the
New Jersey Audubon Society, whose
president is J. Drydk.Y Kusir of
BernardsvlUe. Mr. Kcser takes spe
cial pride In the fact that his or
pinicatlon secured the passage ol
Atfeuhon bobolink bill, whereby
the bobolink or reed bird was trans
l'erred from the gamp bird list to a
place among the song and insectiv
orous sperieH with permanent pro
tection from gunners.
Another accomplishment which
speaks well for the spirit behind th<
movement in New Jersey Is the for
nation during the year of 213 jnnloi
I Audubon classes In the schools of
the State, with a total membership
of 10,689. The Interest of these chil- j
dren promises to insure the perma- \
' nonfo nf tho wr?rIr
That New Jersey stands sixth
among the States in the matter of
organization for bird protection during
1921 is a matter of pride among
I the members of the Audubon societies.
The State occupied a similar
position in 1920, and a special appeal
is being made for the recruiting of;
nov%- members during the coming
year. The educational campaigns
conducted through the newspapers
and by means of lectures illustrated
by photographs and motion pictures J
will be continued.
Among the activities planned is
the strict enforcement of the legislation
against stray cats, than which,
in the opinion of some bird lovers,
l there is no greater peril to bird life.
The Montclair Bird Club has induced
the Town Commission to place traps
in strategic spots to rid the town of
vagrant cats. That the surrounding
i country is a fertile field for the I
ornithologist is indicated by the re- j
port of Field Secretary Barbour, |
who says that 184 species of birds J
were seen during the past season by
members of the Montclair Bird Club !
within six miles of Montclair.
Secretary Mellon's Report.
In one of his messages the President
already had advised Congress
and the country of the magnitude of
the fiscal transactions which loom
: big and overshadowing in the report
| of the Secretary of the Treasury submitted
yesterday. The Director of
i the Budget had covered in detail the
i Government receipts and expendi-j
' tures, actual and expected. Some of
I the edge has thus been taken off Sec- j
retary Meixon's presentation of the
I Government's huge financial busi;
ness. but the fact remains that his
I report is a fine exhibit of the
: trained, scientific, business management
of the Government finances
! under one of the country's clearest
thinkers and soundest hankers,
j One of the interesting and important
operations of the Treasury
under the direction of a thoroughly
I competent financier is the way it;
! has prepared for the handling of j
| iiUctvy vmveriiiueiH uuii^aiiutin BUUII |
to fall due. Within the next year |
j and a half six and three-quarters;
j billions of dollars of such debt will,
| mature. If it were possible to do sol
| it ought to be discharged. Refund !
j ing short term debt costs more in |
! the long run, of course, than paying j
jup. But in the present situation I
| clearing off a debt to stop interest j
| charges on it is a theory; the utter;
I inability to clear off the debt is;
j a condition.
The short term notes and bonds!
| must be refunded in the near future I
' because nothing else can be done, j
| With this in view Secretary Met.ton
has been rearranging the maturities'
; of Treasury certificates and short j
term notes?this in itself a process;
i of refunding?so that they will not
j be coming in for payment at the
same time the 1918 series of war
j savings securities fall due a little
j more than a year from now and the
! victory loans eariy in
With the work Secretary Mellon
I already has done In redistributing the
j Treasury notes not only will the Held
I be clearer for.the necessary refunding
of the bulk of the savings securities
I and the Victories, but there will be a
better chance to cut the interest
rates to the further lightening of the
i current tax burden. And every dollar
that can be taken off the interest
load helps just that much to reduce
ultimately the principal of the towerj
ing debt.
Another important feature of the
' Treasury report is the attention it
gives to a thorough, lucid and convincing
exposition of the bad effects
upon revenues of the unsound taxation
methods which Congress has continued
to keep in force. If the revenues
in the last two years had maintained
anything like the levels that
ivt?rp PYnrrfpH nf th?m flip Trpnsnrv
would not now be compelled to make
technical manoeuvres for refunding j
maturing debts; it would be counting j
the cash already in hand to meet
them as they come due, or buying
them heavily in the open market to !
cancel them before maturity.
But, as Secretary Mellow shows,
| the bottom has been gradually fall,
ing out of the revenue producers that
are most favored by Congress. The
very highly taxed incomes above $300.000
a year, for example, dropped In
number from 1.206 in 1916 to 1,015
in 1017 and 670 in 1919. The taxatye
incomes in that class went down from
$093,000,000 In 1916 to $731,000,000 in
1917 and to $140,000,000 in 1919. The
incomes above $300,000 from dividends.
interest and Investments fell
from $707,000,000 in 1916 to $616,000,- '
000 in 1917; $344,000,000 In 1918 and I
$315 000.000 in 1919.
Still more striking are the figures ;
of taxable inrome from Interest, exclusive
of Government obligations, i
for incomes of $300,000 and over. In
1010 the taxable amount was $166,-'
000,000; in 1917, $111,000,000; 1918,
$75,000,000, and 1919, $60,000,000. i
| ? ' ? ? ,
Yet, as the report emphasizes, actual
incomes were not thus diminishing'
in those years which marked the,
| country's highest prosperity. It was
the taxable principal which was shifting
out of active Industrial and bnsl-l
r.ess investments. The Treasury has
i been losing the revenue; worse yet
i the country has been suffering the
-1 costly withdrawal of those invest-1
- ments from taxpaying productive
; channels into tax exempt channels,
i! Secretary Mr.Lt.ox argues earnestly
? for rational tax methods and bearI
able tax rates which not only will en- j
r I courage mobile capital to go beck

THE NE
into the active productive fields where
rt ia needed by industry, business
and labor, but will collect from such
taxable investments more revenue for
the Treasury than can be collected by
the excessive rates driving capital
out of business into tax exempt
securities.
President Harding urged the same
thing upon Congress when it was revising
the tax measure in special session.
Ho has informed Congress now
in regular session that he is going to
lay the matter before it again. Perhaps
Congress will respond at last.
Then the country cau look ahead to
better clays.

The President's Appeal.
A little more than a week ago
Tick New York Herald, commenting
on Sir Philip Gibbs's despatches
from the starving region of the
Volga, suggested that now was the
time for the great Powers to act
lest hundreds of thousands of Russians
perish.
President Harding has gone even
further than asking Americans to
contribute in their individual capacities.
In his message to Congress
on Tuesday he recommended an appropriation
necessary to supply 10,000,000
bushels of corn to the American
Relief Administration's Russian
forces. The President states the case
briefly and clearly:
"A severe drought. In the valley of
the Volga has plunged 15,000,000
people Into grievous famine. Our
voluntary agencies are exerting
themselves to the utmost to eave the
lives of children in this area, but it
Is now evident that unless relief is
afforded the loss of life will extend
into many millions. America cannot
bo deaf to such a call as tiiat.
"We do not recognize' the Government
of Russia, nor tolerate the
propaganda which emanates therefrom,
but we do not forget the traditions
of Russian friendship. We
may put aside our consideration of
ail international politics and fundamental
differences In government.
The big thing is the call of the suffering
and the dying!"
Congress ought to follow the President's
suggestion immediately. The
emergency is so great that every
day's delay means hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of deaths among women
and children.
Bonding Habitual Crooks.
In a letter printed elsewhere on j
mis page UEOBr.r, r. krictt rails aliention
to a dangerous practice which
has sprung up in recent years.
Bonding companies go bail for habitual
criminals. The housebreaker
under bond 1s free to go back to his
crooked business. Frequently when
a criminal is arrested it is announced
that he was Indicted some months
before and was out on bail bond
awaiting trial at the time of his
second crime.
Such conditions should not exist.
They are perilous to the community.
When a burglar is caught with half
the citizen's silver the citizen should
r.ot have to fear that the burglar will
be back two nights later for the remainder
of the family plate. Judges
have called attention to the bonding
evil. If the bonding companies that
want to reform the practice cannot
do away with it because of others
that do not want to, then the Legislature
should.
Enver Pasha's New Adventure.
According to a cable message from
Constantinople, based apparently
upon authoritative Information from j
the Caucasus, Enver Pasha, the for-j
mer Turkish leader who aligned Tur-1
key with the Central Powers in
the world war, is stirring up new
trouble in the Near East. The last
news which the world previously
had of Enver was that he had
crowned himself King of the Kurds
and had settled down to an investigation
of the Kurd treasure chest and
to diseoverins how he could best do
feat the allied plans for bringing
peace to the remnants of the old Ottoman
Empire.
In the first place the. Kurds' treasury
was empty, In the next place the
Kurds came to the opinion that they
did not wish as ruler a man who was
denounced by tho Paris Conference as
the most notorious of war criminals,
and who was sentenced to death by
the Constantinople Government for
ordering the Armenian massacres,
looting the Turkish treasury and absconding
as a common thief. So the
Kurds went back to their old chieftain
rule and turned their King loose
for new adventures. Envr.n first
sought affiliation with the Turkish
Nationalists, but Ki:mai? knowing
and mistrusting his intentions, would
have nothing to do with him.
Smarting under this insult to Ills
dignity, be made advances to the
Moscow Soviet and was entrusted
with the raising of an army in southern
Russia and the overthrow of the
half dozen small republics established
In the Caucasus region. The subjugation
of these weak little States was
a comparatively easy task. With an
army back of him it was also not
difficult for him to force upon tho
people the Soviet rule, with himself
as the chief representative of Moscow.
He had thus defeated the Paris
plans for northeastern Turkey, and
he had taken revenge upon the allied
nations. His next move was to even
up matters with Kkmal. He has nnidertnken
to do this by organising a
Bolshevist force in the Caucasus,
with the consent of Trotzrt, and hy
marching against the Nationalist capital
at Angora. He is snld to have
promised the whole of Anatolia to
Moscow and the conversion of the
;w YORK HERALD, T
Turks of Asia Minor to Bolshevism.
This is rather a big contract and
one which more capable men than
Exveb have failed to carry out.
The end of this adventure that
would undoubtedly prove acceptable
; to most of the world would be the
capture of the wily Envkr and his
confederate, Djkmai. Pasha, by the
j Nationalists. By turning the pair .
! over to Constantinople Kemal could
j rid himself of two dangerous rivals
. iuiu at inw hume nine icwunio mm*
! relf to the Bosporus Government for
any mistakes he may have made in
j the past. It is said that the gal- j
lows erected for the two rascals is
still standing in the hope that Allah I
would be good enough to bring them 1
at last to deserved punishment.
Too Liberal With Our Oil.
One sentence can embrace a world
1 of meaning when it is uttered by an
i authority. Walter C. Teagle, president
of the Standard Oil Company of
| New Jersey, said at the Chicago
1 meeting of the American Petroleum
! Institute: "The United States has
j been doing a little better than Its
! share toward the maintenance of
. _
t he world s petroleum supplies.
More than a billion barrels of pe-1
troleum have been taken out of Amer-1
ican subsoil in the last three years j
to promote world commerce and Industry.
We have supplied the ships,
railways, automobiles, airplanes and i
farm machinery of other nations!
with fuel, while these nations kept
their own oil sealed in the ground.
We produce 68 per cent, of the oil
consumed in the world, and the percentage
is rising instead of falling,
as it should to conserve our own
supplies. The concentrated demand
of more than two-thirds of all oil
consumers centres on our wells. In [
1919 this demand reached 324,000,000 i
barrels. It was at the annual rate i
of 575,000,000 barrels in some months j
of 1920. In February, 1921, it dropped
to the annual rate of 421,000,000, and |
in September last it rose again to
the unprecedented annual rate of
cr\r. nt\f\ r?nn fius?fi?o_
tions in prices, with consequent hardships
to both consumers and producers
in this country, resulted from the
great variation in demand.
Mr. Teagle prescribes as a remedy
for these spasmodic price movements
that we build up a big reserve of oil.
We can build up this reserve out of
domestic output only when foreign'
fields, carefully guarded for future
use by other nations, are opened up
to supply some of the demand in
parts of the world where American
oil is contributing more than its
share.
We are far too liberal with our oil.
Private Vikoren's Anabasis.
One morning in March, 1920, Private
Sydney Vikoren*, Company M,
Thirty-first United States Infantry,
| awoke in Nikolsk, ninety miles west
of Vladivostok, Eastern Siberia. His
memory was indistinct. The last
thing he could remember was that he
had gone on a vodka party. As a
choice of routes he had behind him
Vladivostok and his commanding officer,
before him some 6,000 miles and
the Atlantic Ocean. He chose the
latter way home.
It might be natural to suppose that
Private Vikorkn was broke. That
would be the usual result of a vodka
party or any other similar party
anywhere in the world. So there
was an interesting, if not exciting,
phase added to his transportation
problem. In a year he had reached
Omsk, near the frontier of Russia in
Europe and about 4,000 miles from
his starting point. The whole journpv
spcms to have been an allnrna.
tion of arrests and releases; but
how much of It he tramped and how j
much he rode is not stated.
The remainder of the year and a
half was spent in the journey from I
Omsk to Moscow and from there j
to Riga, which place he reached
Wednesday of last week. In the
meantime his regiment had left j
j Vladivostok and Private Vikoren was |
reported as lost. The last lap of his'
| European journey will be to Coblenz, I
' where he will be asked to give the \
[United States military authorities'
' some of the unreported details of his
adventures.
Private Vjkoren's experience was |
more remarkable perhaps than that]
of any other American doughboy. It i
has at least a variety which entered I
into the service of no other one of j
them. When he is back home at
Grand Forks. North Dakota, he will
have some fireside stories for the
winter night. Possibly he may tell
whether or not he regrets that vodka
party in dear old Vladivostok.

Nicaragua Was Neutral.
She Sold No Arms to Panama During:
the Dispute With Costa Rica.
To Thh New York Herald: You
printed on Tuesday a despatch from
Han Juan del Sur in which it Is nfflrmed
t that "the Nlcaraguan Government has
received a large consignment of arms
and munitions from the United States
to replace the armaments sold to Panama
during the late conflict between
that country and Costa IUca.
I wish to deny in the most emphatic
manner that Nicaragua supplied or sold
armament to Panama. On the contrary,
ttlcaragva declared her neutrality
in the' conflict between that republic
and Costa Rica.
Nicaragua, it is true, has bought
armament lately in the United States,
but it was solely to replace the very
antiquated military equipment she had
and It was needed to keep the public
order that had been lately threnteaed
by some revolutionists or bandits
who boasted of no flag nor any political
affiliation. Tortbio Tijerino,

Another Great Housekeeper.
Hiss Catherine Beecher's Book of
Cookery mid Household Lore.
To The New York Herard : With no
wish to take a single leaf from the
laurels editorially bestowed on the late
Mrs. Lincoln permit me to say that as a
pioneer of household economy she cannot
hold a candle to Miss Catherine
Boerher, eldest of that famous family.
Hor book?I think It is called simply
"Miss Beecher's Cook Book"?published
In 1846, is proof positive that in the mat*
tsr of good eating no section could possibly
have surpassed New England at Its
best. Indeed, to read it Is a liberal eduffltinn
ir rloit fr\r\A ana fhir.lca nrtfhir?tr
of Baying "Take twenty eggs" In some of
her cake receipts and Is otherwise as
generous.
Xn addition to cookery lore there are
many other things well worth while?
directions for building a brick oven, for
example; for making a water bed to be
used for wasted fever .patients, delicate
diets for the ailing, useful hints as to
ihe care of children. Altogether I have
found no other single volume so oozing
with wisdom of its special kind.
And I know whereof I speak, having
a wide acquaintance with such literature
and being equipped by practice to judge
the value of what It says. The makers
of It for the most part doubtless knew
whereof they wrote, but some of them
must have cooked by hearsay or evolved
their deliverances from their inner consciousness.
If I had the ear of a publisher
In search of something really
worth reprinting I should certainly bid j
him search out Miss Beecher's book and
thereby deserve as well of this newerl
im:e as sno cna 01 me einer one.

'They're After Me."
Jimmy Hoey and Not Tony Pastor
Said to Have Sang This Song.
To The New York Herald: Your correspondent
"J. U. F." of Brooklyn is
Just as far from being right as was Herbert
Stanley Renton In saying that Tony
Pastor sang "They're After Me."
"P. H. S." of Bayonne Is alRo wrong
but not so wide of tho mark as the
.wo other gentlemen. The chorus of the
disputed song ran:
They're after me; they're after me.
To capture ine Is every one's desire.
They're after me; they're after me.
I'm the Individual they require.
The song was sung by Jimmy Hoey,
brother of Old Hoss Hoey and a much
better comedian. At tho time that
Jimmv Hoey sang this song he was do
ing a team act with Pete Dailey billed
as Hoey arid Dalley.
I heard the song sung In Tony Pastor's
Theatre In Fourteenth street which
was part of Tammany Hall. At the
same performance I heard Tony Pastor
sing his hit of that time, which was
"Granny Only Left to Me Her Old Arm
CThatr." The chorus as I remember It
was:
How they tittered, how they chaffed.
How my brothers and my sisters laughed.
When they heard the lawyer declare
Granny only left to me her old arm chair.
The song described how the old arm
chair Anally fell apart, disclosing a fortune
hidden In the seat. These songs
were sung about thirty years ago and
at that time Brooklyn had not been
heard of, which probably accounts for
the Inaccuracy of "J. G. F."

Poe's Religious Faith.

To The New Tor* Hrramj: I have1
read with Interest the letters regarding;
Fee's religious views.
The records show that Poe was
brought up during his youth In the
Christian faith, always entertained a
belief and respect for Almighty God and j
at his death attested to this. There 1s |
now preserved and will be Illustrated in I
the forthcoming new life of Poe. by
Mnry E. Phillips, Poe's own Bible. Those J
who "Knew say that while Poe was undccidad
1n hie own mind as to the practices
of any specific form of religion
he never for a moment douhted the ex- j
lstence of an Almighty God.
Poo wrote to Interest tho reading pubHe
and was capable enough artist to
manage what he wished to write. Poe's,
aim was not minutely to reproduce every
day life, and society but to work out
the peculiar applications and manifestations
of the faculties of reflection and
volition, as conditioning and conditioned
by abnormal tendencies and incidents.
And In doing this he never used an
Improper word. In any view of "Eureka"

Austria Seeks Hel]
America Refusing to Waiv

i
1 Special Cable to Tub N'bw Yokk Herald.
j i~~cpyr%gnx, iuxi, oy the r*E\v ionic hbbai.d.
I Vienna, Deo. 7.?The Allies having
I failed to earn' out their plan for resJ
cuing Austria owing to the American
j refusal to consent to waive claim*
, for some $24,000,000 for foodstuffs Aus
tria is now seeking credit assistance
I from her neighbors, Czechoslovakia
cncl Jugo-Slavia. This la the real reawen
j behind Chancellor Schober's visit to Fori
elgn Minister Bones in Prague, and
j The New York Herald correspondent
! here Is informed that their conversations
i will be devoted exclusively to financial
I questions, especially the idea of a
j Czecho-siovakia loan for financing sup;
plies of coal and sugar for Austria,
while Jugo-Slavia will ibe asked to similarly
provide a credit for fats and other
foodstuffs which the ^ierbs are able to
export.
Meanwhile Austrian manufacturers are
seeking assistance from private British
firms. For Instance, the Berndorfer
metal ware factories, which hitherto
have been considered the Austrian
Krupp, Intend to immediately increase
their capital 100,000,000 crowns, the new
| shares to bo handed over to a British
| group headed by the Robert Whitehead
and other important British interests.
The final estimate of the damage
done In the rioting here last Thursday,
when many shops and residences were
looted, is 1,250,000,000 crowns. The city
is now quiet. A repetition of the riots
! has been made Impossible by police rej
enforcements and military contingents
I from outside Vienna.
Sir William Goode, British member
I of the Austrian section of the Reparation
Commission, said the outbursts of
Thursday may be regarded as a sign
I .-.e -e-rt thimra If Austria does not act
foreign financial help, which is India-1
pensable In overcoming: the present
crisis. This confirms the opinion of
foreigners who are conversant with
Viennese "gemuthllchkelt." One who
was through the Good Friday riots two j
years ago told The New York Herald
correspondent that the most notable feature
then waa that although the starving
mobs attacked the Parliament Building
wealthy automobllisto passed
through the streets unmolested and nb
attempt was made to destroy private
property. That the privations which
the people have since undergone have
brought about attacks on private property
is a very striking sign that the
recent crisis Is pregnant with evil possibilities.
CHARITY ENTERTAINMENTS.

The annual Christmas sale for the
benefit of the Art Workers' Club for
Women, which began yesterday, will
continue to-day Rt 224 West Fifty-eighth
street. There will be on sale practical
gifts, decorated glass book ends, aprons,
costume dolls, children's dresses,
sketches in oil and water color and
original designs In salutation cards and
calendars. There will De a tearoom
In Trinity.
Without the din. the clangorous jars:
Within the hush, the rapt release:
Without the strife, the greed, the scars:
Within soft shadows that increase
As day goes toward its twilight peace.
The organ pipes in silent trance
Brood, yet the soul of music there.
As on the verge of utterance
Trembles; the circumambient air
Seems holy, sanctified with prayer.
Symbol and sign and saintly face
High in the western windows glow;
With beatific gleam and grace
The apostles shine. It is as though
Christ summoned them in radiant row.
The figures on the reredos
Poise reverent forevermore:
The base, the selfish and the gross,
Where these celestial ones adore.
Are as spent foam upon the shore.
Hark, the faint passion of the bells
Drifts down the silence silvernly.
Until within the heart there dwells
A super earthly ecstasy
In those dim aisles of Trinity !

Bonding Mabitu&l Criminals.
A Practice Which Permits the Robber
to Keep on Robbiuv.
To The New York Heraij) : Society
and the newspapers are complaining of
the crime wave which overwhelms this
country at present. Through the columns
of your Influential anrl widely
circulated journal I desire to call attention
to an evil practice which definitely
Increases the number of crimes and
which can be stopped.
Certain bonding companies In this
city and elsewhere furnish ball bonds
to habitual criminals, that Is, those who
have previously been convicted of crimes,
the effect being to leave these criminals
free to resume their preying upon society.
sometimes for many months before
their trials can be reached in the
present crowded condition of our criminal
courta, during which period robberies
and many other crimes arc committed.
Judgo Talley and other Judges of
the Court of General Sessions have
celled attention to this evil practice
again and again. It is only necessary,
I believe, to call 1t to the attention of
tho general public and of the responsible
officials of the bonding companies
to have It stopped.
The continuation and increase of the
crime wave has startled our cities from
coast to coast Many reasons for It
hs.ve been offered and the blame le
placed in many quarters. The effect on
the ipubllo morale has been dangerous
and haa come at a most unfortunate
moment of social and political crisis.
So long ss habitual criminals are
freed immediately after arrest by the
issuance dt these bonds the crime wnve
cannot be expected to decrease. Public
opinion should be brought to besr upon
this matter of furnishing ball bonds to
suoh habitual criminals, so that the
problem may be attacked at one of its
most vicious sources.

matter?oil?in the waters of the harbor
and the minimum penalty, namely, $250,
has been 'Imposed. In the case of the
Wamer-Quinlan Company of New Jersey,
referred to the United States Attorney
for the District of New Jersey, and
In which the defendant was accused of
permitting the escape of oil from its
works at Tremley Point, the penalty of
$500 was Imposed by the District Court,
and on appeal to the United States District
Court of Appeals for the Third District
the penalty was confirmed.
In addition there are pending in the
Federal courts a number of cases reported
by the deputy Inspectors under
this office against oil burning steamships
for polluting the harbor by the discharge
of refuse oil In the waters thereof;
in these cases libels have already
been filed.
The information on which convictions
were obtained in these cases was obtained
by deputy inspectors employed under
this office, as it has bean Its experience
that citizens cannot be depended on
for Information leading to a successful
prosecution, as they are averse to furnishing
other than anonymous communications
and dei-llne to appear as witnesses
upon the ground that it would hurt their
business to have their identity known?
this notwithstanding the fact that the
law authorises one-half the fine to be
pa'd to the Informant.
In Snvltlng attention to the efforts of
I tliis office to protect the harbor of New
York and Ite tributary waters from injurious
deposits of any kind. Including

to mitigate this menace of the flrst order.
