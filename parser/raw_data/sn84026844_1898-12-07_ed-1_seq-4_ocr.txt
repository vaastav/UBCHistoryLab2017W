Victories of American Pact.
p.- That is a splendid tribute Mr. William
M; T. Staid, a special correapondent of the
Associated Press, writing: from Comrian||.
tlnople, pay* to the American "victories
?*.; ' of peace" In the Old World, particularly
S?, In the Orient, rile citations from perP
sonal knowledge and investigation of
f?;- what has been accomplished %y Amerl% ?;
can Influences In the Ottoman empire?
4nhat regeneration of the vast compost
?<t "-i""' unop.innr# nrlnclnallties and
I nationalities," as Mr. Stead styles It. He
refers to the work which has been done
in the Orient by American- missionaries
; and their contributions toward the
i epread of civilization. He details how
the American Chrisiians in-the esrablishment
of Robert College In Turkey have
spread ^through the sultan's domain
American methods, and how that college
has become the hope of the future of the
millions who inhabit that dominion.
Aside from the great new Influence
this country is wielding in the world,
and the inroads It is making in the wide
field of commerce and trade, the social
and Christianizing influences of these
factors referred to by Mr. Stead are of
the greatest importance to the country.
While they are not carried on by the
government they pave the way for
&peace conquests by the country in the
m commercial world and add to oUr pres
E*"- tlge in many other respects. The same
Is true of China and Japan as of the
% Turkish possessions.
Ijj?. Mr. Stead eloquently calls attention
to (acts whlc": are little known by
fv':. Americans, and \vhich they will d-> w*ll
; V to post thsnselves on, when he tells how
4; the Americanizing of the Orient by the
? " swarrtis of missionaries arc putting new
I "pi life Into the Asiatic race.1*. He slates a
* powerful fact when he declares:
*M They are busy everywhere, teaching,
wi; preachlnfr, begetting new life in these
Asiatic races. N<> one hears of them,
gl/ They eschew polities. They stick to
Cf their Bibie and their spelling book, but
g-every year an Increasing number of Ar{
menlans and other orientals lssu?* from
&?: the American school familiar -with the
Eg principles of the declaration of indc
fpenfloncf ana mt* iun<iujm-Hnw uuttrines
of iha Amrrican constitution. Anil
so the leaven Is spreading throughout
the whole land.
The sultan doesn't like all this which
Is taking place in Armenia; the czar of
Russia looks upon it with disfavor, but
they cannot help it. It Ls a peaceful
war. for pcace and of peacc. It can do
nothing but good in the world to sproad
the impress of American principles
abroad among the benighted ones of the
| Orient. Its affect on the remainder of
k?* iInt Th?? vlrinrlpA
PJ of American peace arc no less renowned
figithan the victories of war.
The President's Captions Critics*
It was not expected that the DemoJjg
cratic leaders and organs, and those
who have taken Issue with the President
fay Jn regard to the so-called policy of "exp.1
pansion." would be altogether pleased'
*& ; /With the mc&age. It is not surprising
that, after being unable to ilnd any|jj&
thing in It to criticise, save those things
? which may be called party Issues, some
of them, the Inconsiderate ones, should
: * .tftraln at a criticism and And one In the
> - President's omission of a discussion
; of the government of our new possesi
elons, and the outline of a policy con- I
cernlng them.
B Such leaders of the Democracy as |
.'V
Ohairman Jones, of the national (free j
silver) Democracy, Bailey, of Texas,
McMillan, of Tennessee, and others, for
purposes which arc very apparent. And |
In this omission great cause for criticism
and "disappointment." They dei;
dare that the President should have
outlined a policy and discussed freely
bis Ideas for the government of the possessions.
Republican leader? generally,
appreciating the real reason for this
omission, and a proper reason It Is, se.i
nothing In the message Jo criticise.
; , The absurdly weak and the only Straw
r upon which to cling In captious criticism
is al.'o grasped by the emallcr fry
; of newspaper organs of the Democracy.
In Its usual manner of mlsrephesentlng
things, the Register makes this polni.
i?': almo.H the koIo topic of its comments:
and the next moat Important Democratic
'? falsifier In the state? the Parkersburg
v Sentinel, exposes Its Ignorance of the
contents of the message in thl# way:
"Thp President declines to take the people
Into his confidence ns to his purpones
In connection with the Philippines Is
he I* maturing ? mc iiidofcnjribi* project
that he dare not irrak* public?"
The absurdity Ik at oncc apparent,
flow could th?? President carry out a
project relating to the Philippine question
witftout miking It publicT When
<1U1 the President ever fall to take the
public Into his confidence? What President
?va? ever In elor-r touch with th-*
people? Of thr? Philippine mutter and
the in?*ft*agr, rnoro further on. Our profoundly
fttatcsmanlikc and knowledge11
oua contemporary, the Register. also I
came* forward with the startling state- <
ment that it to evident that the "Preti- <
dent ha? no poller, or none that he dare <
stand by."
How unjust thai cumment!? concern- i
Ing a. President who has bravely as- I
timed and performed a great responslblllty
thrust upon him, and who haa i
borne a burden (with credit to himself, i
and with flrmnesa and courage), such <
aa but one other American Executive <
has faced In the paat century. And the \
Register continues that the President <
wvA th* PMiinnine Aubiect a very "wide 1
berth," and that "evidently he stands
too appalled at the Immensity of the
problem confronting: us to even discuss
It with Congress." We might odd that (
evidently, alia, the wrher of the above
did not read the message, and that evl- <
dently he la m> blinded by partisan prejudice
that he cannot aee that hli as- <
sumption Is absurd on Its face.
The facta In the case can be briefly ^
stated and are sufficient to show the absurdity
of criticisms of this nature, by '
whomsoever they are nude. They ex- ,
pose either a desire to create prejudice,
a purpdse to misrepresent the President, .
or an Ignorance of the Executive's reasons
given In the message for his omls- ]
alon at this time to discuss the policy
to be pursued on these matters and to
outline his own views on the whole matter.
Fair criticism Is not misrepresentation.
Let the President speak for i
himself. In that part of his message
relating to the peace commission the i
President eaye:
. "I do not discuss at this time the government
of the future of the new posses- '
slons which will come to us as the result
of the war with Spain. SUCH A D1S- |
? ij Tiw inDonDDIiifB
UUOS1UA VVJKli Lti-j
AFTER THE TREATY OF PEACE I
SHALL BE RATIFIED. In the meantime.
and until Congress has legislated j
otherwise, It will toe my duty to continue j
the military governments which 'have <
existed since our occupation, and give
to the people security in life and property
and encouragement under a Just and
beneficent rule."
All of which is clearly in accordance
?,,u " ? ?fnt?r Whv fihnuld
anything else be expected? "Whyebould
the President recommend on these mat- 1
tera or discuss them In advance of the 1
agreement on the treaty? Why should
citizens be so inconsiderate?
The President plainlymak** clear three
things: First, that it is inappropriate to '
officially discuss these government quea- 1
tioha in advance of the treaty. Second,
that the matter will be made the subject
of a special message to Congress after '
the treaty Is a fact. Third, that it being
a matter with which Congress must deal
by legislation, it is proper, and is the 1
President's intention, to submit it to that
body with his views and recommendations
when the possessions are ours by ;
virtue of the treaty and the formal 1
transfer.

effectually- disposes of all the captious
objections -to it on tlie point referred to. ^
and .which seems to be the principal
point of attack. President McKinley
can Tae trusted in the future as he has
been in the past by the people. The
fault-flnders may keep at it Time, and
a very short time, will reward the confidence
of the country.
Was a Deliberate Deceit.
All that the Democratic organ can say
regarding the action of the Intelligencer
in not publishing a letter written by a
relative of Governor-elect Roosevelt, a
matter which was optional with the Intelligencer,
will not excuse the Register
In the minds of the public for dellber- j
ately changing the wording of the dis- j
| patch in order to credit the letter to
Governor-elect Roosevelt, when It wan
plainly stated In the Introductory sentence
that It was another Roosevelt. (
The fact that the gentleman was a
i relative of the governor-elect did not in- I
crease the value of the letter, nor did it
I warrant the Register in dishonestly 1
practicing a deceit upon Its readers, j
I When the Register declares that the In[
telllgencer misrepresents it in calling (
attention to Its alteration of the dlsrm-*r.h.
and oxcuses itself on the plea
| that it wa*? mistaken, it indulges in another
deceit. There was no mistake 1
| about It. It was-a deliberate alteration
of the text. "Robert H. Roosevelt" was
[ stricken out by the editor handling !t
| and the words "Governor Roosevelt"
were cubstituted. The Intelligencer has
| a copy of the original, and can prov^ its
charge by a manifold copy of the dispatch
delivered to the Register.
Furthermore, when the Register complains
of the Intelligencer for using its
own option and proper privilege in publishing
legitimate news, it fails to say
It used that same prerogative in regard
to this same dispatch, in not publishing
the proceedings of the Inquiry board in
connection with the dispatch referred to.
Our only purpose was to expose a dishonest
change made In a dispatch to alter
Its meaning and significance. In violation
of journalistic honor and the rules
of the Asfoclated Press.
A Plan that Failed.
The astounding purpose of -the demand /
on the part of the Democrats for a re- 1
count In Marshall county as to the vote j
for state eenator, and two members of
the legislature was exposed yesterday '
when ?the attorneys for the Democrats 1
asked for a continuance of the re-count ,
for the second time, and were refused
by the court which was ready to pro- f
cced. The attorneys then withdrew the
demand altogether. When the demand
for a re?rount was made the Democratic
managers expected th" court to refuse;
when it granted the i. quern, they were
taken by surprise am! asked for a postponement,
which was granted. The new
date came and they again asked a postponement.
The Democrats expected, on a refusal,
to take the matter to -the legislature and ,
have tho two legislative candidates who
wore defeated seated, should tho house
be con-trolled by the Democrats. Seeing
that hope depart, the demand for the recount
was withdrawn. It was n slick
trick but It failed. The certificates of
Sturm und the two delegates-elect have
been forwarded to the secretary of s>Ut*.
The account of the whole proceeding
will be found elsewhere.
