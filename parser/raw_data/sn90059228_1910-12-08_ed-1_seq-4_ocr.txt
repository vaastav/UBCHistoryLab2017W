uegal Advertisements at Legal Rates.
The railroads are doing their ut
most to obtain permission to advance
freight rates their plea being that
the present rates are confiscatory.
The real reason why they want to
raise rates is that they want the puu
lie to build new lines of railway for
them and make extensive improve
ments on their properties, without,
getting the money from their stock
holders as they ought to do. At pres
ent rates nearly all the roads pay
good interest on their stock, whether
watered or not, and even declare divi
dends and the public should not be
asked, to contribute any more.
The census of Minnesota just made
public reveals a very satisfactory
growth during the past ten years. Yet
there is room for improvement. The
growth of the country has not kept
pace with the growth of the cities.
It is very apparent that our greatest
need is more people to till the land
and develop the great agricultural re
sources of the state, and that with
that end in view a vigorous "back to
the land" movement must be begun.
President Taft's message to con
gress, which we publish this week,
is an able state paper. It is calm,
dignified and conservative in tone,
yet sufficiently progressive to empha
size the fact that a man who has the
interests of the people at heart is at
the helm of state. The country's
economic and social conditions are
clearly reviewed and many recom
emndations made that congress will
do well to heed.
It the members of the Minnesota
State Banking Association have their
way the legislature at the next ses
sion will appropriate $100,000 to ad
vertise the state.
The matter was brought before the
association at its meeting in Minne
apolis and at once met hearty approv
al. The campaign was put in the
hands of the executive committee.
eBr'ore the legislature meets every
lawmaker will have been seen and
urged to vote for such an appropria-1
tion. The money is to be speni un
der the direction of the state immi-i
gration department, which under the
present laws has an appropriation of'
only $25,000 a year.
Kvery banker in the state who is i
a member of the association will be i
urged to use his influence with the!
i
member from his district to have the
proposed legislation adopted. The
bankers would advertise Minnesota
acreage, the forty-year purchase con
tracts, low taxes and other induce
ments which will rend to build up the
agricultural and dairy lands of the
state particularly in the central and
north central parts.
The people of the east are wont to
look upon Minnesota as a state that
if already thickly settled and when
they think of moving west to settle
on a farm they have the idea that all
the good chances in this state have
already been taken advantage of. To
(oneit tins impression and let the
eastern people know that thousands
oJ acres of the b*st farming lands in
the country are still undeveloped is
one ot the objects of the proposed ad
vertising oamj aifcn The Minnesota
Federation ot Commercial clubs will
hold its annual convention in St. Paxil
in January and will take .up the ad
vertising matter tor discussion It is
lelieved that the federation will
adopt resolutions urging the legisla
ture to appiopriate the amount sut:
^ested bv the bankers.
BRIGHT STAR OF HOPE
Beautiful star' Bright shining
star!
Up in the dark blue sky afar,
Dost thou look down on this world
below
So cold and dark, but for thy bright
glow,
Would be but a dark and dreary
night.
When on the ocean night has^come,
A ship which has sailed far from
home,
Looks up to thee, and by thy light,
Safely reaches the shore thru the
perilous night.
Lead us bright star forever more
Till safe beyond to that other shore,
Thou hast guided our frail vessels
o'er
The sea of darkness.
Over many a shoal and barrier,
TTntil by thy bright light,
'Ye have reached our goal.
Ida Johnson.
