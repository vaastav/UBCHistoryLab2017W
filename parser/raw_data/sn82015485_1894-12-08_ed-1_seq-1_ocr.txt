SIXTEENTH YEAR.
I PRESIDINFS MESSAGE
Washington, Dec. 3. The following1
Is the president's message to congress:
Message to the congress of the United
States: The assemblage within the nations
legislative halls of those charged with the
duty of makin ; laws for the benefit of a g en
herons and free psople impressively suggests
the exacting obli ;ation and inexorable re
sponsibility involved in their task. At the
threshold of such labor no w to be undertaken
by the congreis of the U nlted States and in
the discharge of an executive duty enjoined
by the constitution, I submit : his communi
cation containing a brief statement of the
condition of our national affairs and recom
mending: such legislation as seeuuto be neces
sary and expedient.
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations and our peaceful relations with
them at this time, additionally demon
strate the advantage of consistently adhering
to a firm but just foreign po Hey, free from
envious or ambitious national schemes and
characterized byentire honestyand sincerity.
l)uring the past year, pursuant to a law of
congress, commissioners were appointed to
the Antwerp industrial exposition, though the
participation of American echibitors fell far
short of completely i'lustraling our national
ingenuity and industrial achievements, yet it
was quite creiitable in view of the brief time
-allowed for preparation.
The termination of the civil war in Brazil
ha3 been followed by the general prevalence
of peace and orJer It appeariaj at an early
fctasie of the insurrection that its course would
call for unusual watchfulness on the part of
this government our naval force in the harbor
of Rio de Janeiro was strengthened. This
precaution I am sitistleJ. trtnied to restrict
the issue to a simple trial of strength between
the Brazilian government and the insurgents,
and to avert complications which at times
seemed imminent Our lirm attitude of neu
trality was maintained to the end. the in
surgents received no encouragement of event
ual asylum from our commanders and such
oppositson as they encountered was for the
protection of our commerce and was clearly
Justtfled by public law. A serious tension of
relations bavin r arisen at the close of the
war between Brazil and Portugal by reason
of the escape of the insurgent Admiral De
gama and his followers The friendly offices
-of our representatives to those countries
wera exerted for the protection of the sub
jects of either within the territory of the other
Although the government of Brazil was duly
notified that the commercial arrangements
existing between the United States and that
country, based on the third section of the
tariff act of 189J, was abrogated on Aug. 23,
1891, by the takin? effect of the tariff law now in
force, that government subsequently notified
, us of its intention to terminate such arrange
ment on the first day of January, 1895, in the
exercise of the right reserved in the agree
ment between the two countries. I invite a
mention to the correspondence between the
secretary of state and the Brazilian minister
on this subject
The China-Japan War.
A gratifying re cognition of the uniform im
partiality of t his country towards all foreign
states was man ifested by the coincident re
finest of the Ch inese and Japanese govern
ments tint the a. cnts of the United States
should within proper limits afford protection
to the subjects of the other during the sus
pension of dip lomatic relations due to a state
of war T his delicate office was accepted,
and a misapprehension which gave rise to the
belief that in affording this kindly unofficial
protection our a ents would exercise
the same authority which the with
drawn a.'cnts of the belligerents hid
exercised, was promptly corrected. Although
the war between Ch( na and Japan endangers
no noiioy of the United States it deserves our
era vest consideration, by reason of its dis
turbance of our growing commercial interest
in the two countries and the increased dangers
which may result to our citizens domiciled or
sojourtiin? in the interior of China Acting
under astipulation in our treatv with Korea,
the first concluded with a Western power)
I felt constrained at the be,'i nnin? of the
' controversy to tender our good offices to
induce on amicable arrangement of the
initial difficulty growing out of the Japanese
demands for administrative reforms in
Korea, but the unhappy precipitation of
actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose ,
uep loring me obstructive war between the
two most powerful of the Eastern nations
and anxious that our commercial interests in
those countries may be preserved and that
the safety of our citizens there shall not be
Jeopardized. I would not hesitate to heed any
Intimation that our friendly aid for the
honorable termination of hostilities would be
acceptable to both belligerents.
The German Meat Prohibition.
Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas
fever in cargoes of American cattle the Ger
man prohibition against importations of live
stock and fresh meats from this country has
been revived. It is hoped that Germany will
soon become convinced that the inhtaition is
as needless as it is harmful to mutual in
terests. The German government has protected
.against th.it provision of the customs tariff
ct which imposes a discriminating duty-of
one-tenth of one cent a pound ou su ars com
ing from countries paying an export bounty
thereon, claiming that the exaction of such
duty is in contravention of articles live and
nine of the treaty of 182$ with Prussia. In the
interests of the commeraj of both countries
and to avoid even the accusation of treaty
violation. I recommend the repeal of so muoh
of the statute as imposes thit duty and I in
vite attention to the accompany in r report of
the secretary of state containin g a discussion
of the questions raised by the German pro
tests. The Hawaiian Incident.
Since communicatin? the voluminous cor
respondence in regard to Hawaii and the ac
tion taken by the senate and house of repre
sentatives on certain questions submitted to
the judgment and wider discretion of congress
the Organization of a government in place of
the provisional arrangement which followed
the deposition of the queen has been an
nounced with evidence of its effective opera
tion. The recognition usual In such cases
has been accorded the new government
Bluefields Affair.
Prominent amonz the questions of ter
ritorial jurisdiction of the year was the Blue
fields incident in what is known as the
Mosquito Indian strip, bordering on the At
lantic ocean and within the jurisdiction of
Nicaragua. By the treaty of 1863 between
Great Britain and Nicaragua, the former
government expressly recognized the sov
ereignty of the latter over the strip and a
limited form of self government was
Guarantee! to the Mosquito Indians to be
exercised according to their customs for
themselves and their dwellers within its
limits. The so-called native government
which grew to be largely made up of
&Veas for many years disputed the sov
ereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and
s claimed the right to maintain therein a practi
cally Independent municipal government.
Early in the past year efforts of Nicaragua to
maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito ter
ritory led to serious desturbances culminating
la the suppression of the native government
and te attempted substitution of an Impract
icable impact administration in.whtch Nicar
agua ant alien residents were to participate.
1 . SO.
Ptflure was followed bv an insurrectloa whica
for a time subverted Nicaraguan rule, expell
ing her officers and restoring the
old organization. This in turn gave
way to the existln? local government
established and upheld by Nicaragua.
Although the alien interests arrayed against
Nicaragua in these transactions have been
largely American and the commerce of that
region for some time ha3 been and still is con
trolled by our citizens, we cannot for that
reason challenge the rijhtful sovereignty of
Nicaragua over this important part cf her
domain. For some months on and during part
of the term, two of our naval ships have been
stationed at Bluefields for the protection of
all legitimate interests of our citizens. In
September last the government at Managua
expelled from its territory twelve
or more foreigners including two
Americans for alleged participation in the
seditious or revolutionary movements ajainst
the republic at Bluefields already men
tioned Through the earnest remonstration of
this government the two Americans have been
permitted to return to the peaceful manage
ment of their business. Our naval commanders
at the scene of this disturbance by their con
stant exhibition of firmness and good judg
ment contributed largely to the prevention of
more serious consequences and to the restora
tion of quiet and order.
I regret that in the midst of the.se occur
rences there opened up a most grave irritating
failure of Nicarauan justice An American
citizen named Wilson, residing at Rama, in
the mosquito territory was murdered by one
Arguelio, the acting governor of the town
After some del ly the murderer was arrested,
but so insecurely confined or guarded that he
escaped, and natwithstmlinj our repeated
demands it is claimed that his recapture has
been impossible by reason ot his flight beyond
Nicaraguan jurisdiction.
The Nicaraguan authorities having given
notice of forfeiture of their concession to
the canal company on grounis purely
technical and not embraced in the
contract receded from taat position.
Peru, I rejret to say, shows symptoms of
domestic disturbance. du9 probably to the
Slowness of her recuperation from the war of
1831. Weakened in resources, her difficulties
in facing international obligations invite our
kindly sympathy and justify our forbearance
in pressing Ion? pending claims. I have felt
constrained to testify this sympathy in con
nection with certain demands urgently pre
ferred by other powers
The recent death of the czar of Russia called
forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and
sympathy on the part of our government with
his bereaved family and the Russian people.
As a further demonstration of respect and
friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was
directed to represent our government at the
funeral ceremonies.
Treasury Department.

War Department.
The message reviews and comments on the
report of the secretary of war. The president
does not believe there is any necessity for in
creasing the army to 30, 03 J men, as recom
mended by Secretary Lamont He advises
arainst the creation of new military posts.
The secretary's plai of the adoption of the
batallion system is recommended The strike
troubles of last summer are briefly referred to
and the action of the military commended
In recognition of the Ion? and distinguished
military services and faithful discharge of
delicate and responsible civil duties by Major
General John M. Sc hone Id. now the general
commanding the army, it is suggested to con
gress that the temporary revival of theerade
of lieutenant general in his behalf would be a
just and gracious act.
Department of Justice.
The report of the attorney general notes the
gratifying progress made by the supreme
court in overcoming the arrears of its busi
ness and in reachin; a condition in which it
will be able to dispose of cases as they arise
without any unreasonable delay. This result
is of course very largely due to the successful
working of the plan inau;urating circuit
courts of appeals. In respect to these tribun
als the suggestion is made in quarters entitled
to the highest consideration that an addi
tional circuit judre for each circuit would
greatly strengthen these courts and the
confidence reposed in their adjudications
and that such an addition would not create a
creafSr force of judges than the increasing
business of such courts requires. I commend
the suggestion to the careful con3ideraticn of
the congress. Other important topics are
adverted to the report accompanied by recom
mendations, many of which have been treated
at lar?e in previous messages, and at this
time they need only be named, I refer to the
abolition of the fee system as a measure of
compensation to federal officers. The en
largement of the powers of United States
cemmissioners in the territories. the allowance
of writs of errer in criminal cases on behalf
of the United States and the establishment of
degrees in the crime of murder A topic dealt
with by the attorn ey general of much import
ance is the condition of the administration of
justice in the Indian Tejritory. The perma
nent solution of what is called the Indian
problem is probably not to be expected at
once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of
present conditions of the existing system will
admit ought not to be neglected. I am satis
fled there should be a federal court estab
lished for the territory with sufficient judges
and that this court should sit within the ter
ritory and have the same jurisdiction as to
territorial affairs as now vested in the federal
courts sitting in Arkansas and Texas.
Eight years ago in my annual message I
urged upon the congress as strongly as I could
the location and construction of two prisons
for the confinement of United States prison
ers A similar recommendation has been
made from time to time sines and a few years
ago a law was passed providing for the selec
tion of sites for three such institutions. No
appropriation has, however, been made to
carry the act into effect and the old and dis
creditible condition still exists
Postal and Navy Departments.
The message next takes up the report of the
postimster general and strongly urges the
recommendations of that official looking to
the correction of the abuses of the second
class mail matter privilege by publishers of
advertising matter, who send tons of papers
through the mail and defraud the government
out of millions of dollars postage annually.
The free carriage of seeds of grain throu.'h
the mails is also condemned. If these abuses
were rectified the department would be self
sustaining. The report of the postmaster
general, which has already been published, is
reviewed at length.
Attention is called to the report of the sec
retary of the navy which shows very gratify
ing progress in the construction of ships for
our new navy.
I recommend that provision be made for the
construction of additional battle-ships and
torpedo boats The secretary recommends
the manufacture not only of a reserve supply
of ordnance and ordnance material for ships
of the navy, but also a supply for the auxil
iary fleet Guns and their apurtenanoes
should be provided and kept on hand for both
those purposes We have not to-day a single
gun that could be put upon the ships Paris or
New York of the International Navigation
company or any other ship of our reserve
navy. The manufacture of guns at the
Washington navy yard is proceeding satis
factorily, an d none of our new ships will be
required to wait for their tuns or ordnance
equipment.
Interior Department.
The report of the secret sry of the interior
exhibits the situation of the nam;rou3 and in
teresting branches of the public service con
nected with his department. I recommend
this report and the valuable recommenda
tions of the secretary to the careful attention
of congress.
I fully indorse the recommendation of the
secretary that adequate protection be pro
vided for our forest reserves and that a com
prehensive forestry system be inaugurated.
The recommendations of the secretary in
regard to dealing with the Indian question is
concurred in and has already been published.
Pensions.
The barefaced and extensive pension frauds
exposed under the courageous and generous
veteran soldier now at the head of the bureau
leaves no room for the claim that no purgation
of our pension roll was needed or that con
tinued vigilance and prompt action are not
necessary to the same end The accusation
that an effort to detect pension frauds is evi
dence of unf riendline-s towards our
worthy veterans and a denial of their
claims to the generosity of the gov
ernment, suggests an unfortunate indiffer
ence to the comissions of any offense which
has for its motive the securing of a pension
and indicates a willingness to be blind to the
existence of mean and treacherous crimes
which play upon demagogic fears and make
sport of the patriotic people.
Agricultural Department. -
The secretary of agriculture in his report
reviews the operations of his department for
the last fiscal year and makes recommenda
tions for the further extension of its useful
ness- The recommendations of the senate
are concurred in. The prohibition of free dis
tribution of seed by the department is again
creed.
The work done by the department of agri
culture is very superficially dealt with in this
communication and I commend the report of
tie secretary and the very important inter
est with which it deals to the careful atten
tion of the congress.
An exceedingly important recommendation !
of the secretary relates to the manner in
which contests and ' litigated cases growing
out of efforts to obtain government land are
determined. The entire testimony upon
which these controversies depend in all their
stages is taken before the local registers
and receivers and yet these officers have no
KANSAS, SATURDAY,
f power to subpoena witnesses or to enforce
their attendance to testify. These cases,
numbering three or four thousand annually
are sent by the officers to the commissioner
of the general land office for his action. The
exegencies of his other duties obliie him to
act upon decisions of the registers and re
ceivers without an opportucity of thorough
personal examination. Nearly 2.0J) ot these
cases are appealed annually from the commis
sioner to the secretary of the interior. Burden
ed with other important administrative duties.
his determination of these appeals must be
almost perfunctionary and based upon the ex
amination of others. Through this determina
tion of the secretary operates as final adjudica
tion upon rights of very importance. 1 concur
in the opinion that the commissioner of the
general land office should be relieved from
this duty of deciding litigated land cases: that
a non-partisan court should be entreated to
pass on such cases and that the decisions of
this court should be final, at least so far a3
the decisions of the department are final.
Civil Service Reform.
The advantages to the public service of an
adherence to the principles of civil service
reform are constantly more apparent and
nothing is so encouraging to those in official
life who honestly desire good government as
the increasing appreciation by our people of
these advantages. A vast majority :of ths
voters of the land are ready to insist
that the time and the attention of
those they select to perform for
them important public duties, should not be
distributed by doling out minor offices and
they are growing to be unanimous in regard
ing party organizations as something that
should be used in establishing paity principles
instead of dictating the distribution of public
places as rewards of partisan activity
Numerous additional offices and places have
been brought within civil service rules and
regulations and some others will probably
soon be included. The report of the commis
sioners will be submitted to the congress and
I invite careful attention to the recommen
dations it contains.
National Board of Health.
I am entirely convinced that we ought not
to be longer without a national board of
health or national health officer charged with
no other duties than such as pertain to the
protection of our country from the invasion
of pestilence and disease. I earnestly recom
mend that the inauguration of a national
board of health or similar national instru
mentality, believing the same to be a needed
precaution against contagious diseases and in
the interast of safety and hea th of poor
people.
Strike Commission.
By virtue of a statute of the United States
passed in 1883, I appointed in July last Hoa.
J. D. Keen ot the state of New York and
Hon. Nicholas E Worthtnjton, of the state
of Illinois, to form with Hon. Carroll D.
Wright, commissioner of labor, who was des
ignated by said statute a commissioner for the
purpose of making careful inquiry into the
causes of the controversies between certain
railroads and their employes which had re
sulted in an extensive and destructive
strike, accompanied by much violence and
dangerous disturbance with considerable loss
of life and great destruction of property. The
report of the commissioners has been sub
mitted to me and will be transmitted to con
gress with the evidence taken upon their in
vestigation. Their work has been well done,
and their standing and intelligence give as
surance that the report and suggestions they
make are worthy of careful consideration.
Tariff Amendments Urged.
The tariff act passed at the last session of
congress needs important amendments if it is
executed effectively and with certainty in ad
dition to such necessary amendments as will
not change rates of duty. I am still very de
cidedly in favor of puttin? coal and iron on the
free list So far as the su?ar schedule is con
cerned, I would be glad under the existing ag
gravations to see every particle of deferential
duty in favor of refined suar stricken out of
our tariff law. If with all the favor accorded
the sugar refining interest in our tariff laws it
still languishes to the extent of closed re
fineries and thousands of discharged work
men it would seem to present a hopeless cese
for reasonable legislative aid
Whatever else is done or omitted I earnestly
repeat here the recommendation 1 have made
in another portion of this communication that
the additional duty of one tenth of a cent per
pound laid upon sugar imported from coun
tries paying a bounty on its export be abro
gated. It seems to me that exceedingly im
portant considerations point to the propriety
of this amendment With the advent of a new
tariff policy not only contemplated to relieve
the consumers of our land in ths cost of their
daily life, but to invite a beuer development
of American thrift and create for us closer
and more profitable commercial relations
with the rest of the world it follows as a logi
cal and Imperative necessity that we should
at once remove the chief if not only obstacle
which has so lonr prevented onr participa
tion in the foreign carrying trade of the sea.
A tariff built upon the theory that it is well to
check imports and that a home marketoshould
bound the industry and effort of American
producers, was fitly supplemented by a re
fusal to allow American registry vessels
built abroad thou;h owned and navigated by
our people, thus exhibitin? a willingness to
abandon all contest for the advantages of
American trans oceanic carriage. Our new
tariff policy bill upon the theory that it is
well to encourage such importations as
our people need and that our products and
manufactures should find market in every
part of the habitable globe is consistently
supplements by the greatest possible liberty
to our citizens in the ownership and naviga
tion of ships in which our products and man
ufactures may be transported The millions
now paid to foreigners for carrying American
passengers and products across the sea
should be turned into American hands. Ship
building, which has been protected to
strangulation, should be revived by the pros
pect of profitable employment for ships when.
built, and the American sailor would be resur
rected and again take his place, a sturdy and
industrious citizen in time of reace. and a pat
riotic and safe defender of American interests
in the day of conflict The ancient provision
of onr law denying American registry to ships
built abroad and owned by Americans, ap
pears, in the light of present conditions, not
only to be a failure for good at every point,
but to be nearer a relic of barbarism than any
thing that exists under permission of statute
of the United States. I earnestly recommend
its prompt repeal.
The Gold Reserve.
During the last month the gold reserves in
the treasury for the purpose of redeemini the
notes of the government circulating as money
in the hands of the people became so reduced
and its further depletion in the near future
seemed so certain that in the exercise of
proper care for the public welfare it became
necessary to replenish this reserve and thus
maintain popular faith in the ability and
determination of the government to meet a
agreed, its pecuniary obligations. It would
have been well if in thisemer;ency authority
had existed to issue t he bonds of the govern
meet bearing a iow rate of interest
and maturing within a special period,
but the congress havin? failed to confer such
authority resort was neceesanly had to the
resumption act of 1S75, and pursuant to its
provision, bonds were issued drawing interest
at the rate of five per cent per annum and
mat.urin? ten years after their issuing, that
being the shortest time authorized by the act
lam glad to say, however, that i the sale of
these bonds the premium received operated to
reduce the rate of interest to be paid by the
DECEMBER 8, 1894.
'government to less than three per cent
Nothing could be worse or further removed
from sensible finance than the relations ex
isting between the currency the government
has issued, the gold held for its
redemption and the means which
must be resorted to for the purpose of replen
ishing such redemption fund when impaired.
Even if the claims upon this fund were con
fined to the obligations originally intended
and if the redemption of these obligations
meant their cancellation the fund would be
very smalt But these obligations when re
ceived and redeemed in gold are not cancelled
but are re-issued and may do duty many times
by way of drawing gold from the treasury.
Thus we have an endless chain in operation
constantly depleting the treasury's gold and
never near a final rest As if this was not
bad enough we have a statutory declaration
that it is the policy of the government
to maintain the parity between gold and sil
ver aided the force and momentum of the ex
hausting process and added largely to the cur
rency obligations claiming this peculiar gold
redemption. Our sm ill gold reserve is thus
subject to draw from every side The de
mands that increase our dan rer also increase
the necessity of protecting this reserve
against depletion and it is most unsatisfactory
to know that the protection afforded is only a
temporary palliation It is perfectly and pal
pably plain that the only way under present
conditions by which this reserve when
dangerously depleted, can be replen
ished, is throush the issue and
sale of the bonds of the gov
ernment for gold and yet congress has
not only thus far declined to authorize the
issue of bonds best suited to such a purpose,
but there seems a disposition in some quar
ters to deny both the necessity and power for
the issue of bonds at all. I cannot for a
moment believe that anj of our citizens are
deliberately willin? that their government
should default in its pecuniary obligations, or
that its financial operations should be re
duced to a silver basis At any rate I
should not feel that my duty was
done if I omitted any effort I could
make to avert such a calamity. As long
therefore as no provision is made for the
final redemption or the putting aside of the
currency obligation now used to repeatedly
and constantly draw from the government its
gold and as long as no better authority for
bond issues is allowed thin at present exists
such authority will be utilized whenever and
as often as it becomes necessary to maintain
a sufficient gold reserve and in abundant time
to save the credit of our country and make
good the financial declarations of our govern
ment Questions relatin : to our banks and
currency are closely connected with the sub
ject just referred to and they also present
some unsatisfactory features
New Banking System Advocated.
Prominent among them are the lack of elas
ticity in our currency circulation and its fre
quent concentration in financial centres when
it is most needed in other parts of the country.
The absolute divorcement of the government
from the business of banking is the ideal rela
tionship of the government to the circulation
of the currency of the country. This condi
tion cannot be immediately reached but as a
step in that direction and as a means of secur
ing a more elastic currency and obviating
other objections to toe present arrange
ment of bank circulation the secretary
of the treasury presents in his report a
scneme modifying present bankin; laws and
providing for the issue of circulating notes by
state banks free from taxation under certain
limitations The secretar explains his plan
so plainly and its advantages are developed by
him with such remarkable clearness that any
effort on my part W present arguments in its
supports would be surpuflous. I shall there
fore content myself with an unqualified in
dorsement of the m secretarys' proposed
changes in the law and a brief and imperfect
statement of their prominent features
It is proposed to repeal all laws providing
for the deposit of United States bonds as se
curity for circulation to permit national
banks to issue circulating notes not exceeding
in amount 75 per cent of their paid up and un
impaired capital provided they deposit with
the government as a guarantee fund m United
States legal tender notes including treasury
notes of 1890, a sum equal in amount to 81
per cent of the notes they desire to issue, this
deposit to be maintained at all times but
whenever any bank retires any part of its cir
culation a proportional part of its guar
antee fund shall be returned to it; to
permit the seretary of the treasury
to prepare and keep on hand ready for issue
in case an increase in circulation is desired
blank national bank notes for each bank hav
ing circulation and to repeal the provisiohs
of the present law imposing limitations and re
strictions upon banks desiring' to reduce or in
crease their circulation, thus permit tin? such
ncrease or reduction within the limit of
iseventy-flve per cent of. capital to be quickly
made as emergency arise In addition to the
guarantee fund required it is proposed to pro
vide a safety fund for the immediate redemp
tion of the circulating notes of failed banks
by imposing a small annual tax say one half
of one per. cent upon the average circulation
of each bank until the fund amounts to five
per cent of the total circulation outstanding.
When a bank fails its guarantee fund is to be
paid into this safety funds and its notes are
to be redeemed in the first instance from such
safety fnnd thus au mentei: any impairment
of such fund caused thereby to be made good'
from the immediately available cash assets of
sal4 bank, and ij these should be insufficient,
auch impairment to be made good by pro-,
rata assessment among the other banks, their
contributions contituting a first lien upon
the as-ets of the failed bank in favor of the
contr.buting banks.
As a further security it is contemplated
that the existing proposition fixing the indi
vidual liability of stockholders is to be re
tained and the bank's indebtedness on ac
count of its circulating notes is to be made a
first lien on all its assets. For the purpose of
meeting the expense of printing notes, offi
cials, supervision, cancellation and other like
charges, there shall be imposed a tax of say.
one-half of one per cent per annum upon the
average amount of notes in circulation. It la
further provided that there shall be
no national bank notes issued of
a less denomination than ten dollars:
that each national bank, except in case ol a
failed bank shall redeem or retire its notes in
the first instance at its own office or at
agencies to be designated by it, that no fixed
reserve used be maintaihed on account of de
posits. Another very important feature ot this plan
is the exemption of state banks f&m taxa
tion by the United States in cases where it is
shown to the satisfaction of the secretary of
the treasury and comptroller of the currency,
by banks claiming such exemption, that they
have not had outstanding their circulating
notes exceeding seventy-five per cent of
their paid up and unimpaired capital
that their stockholders are individually liable
for the redemption or their circulating notes
to the full extent of the ownership of stock
that the liability of such banks upon
their circulating notes constitutes
under their state law a first lien upon
their assets. that such banks have
kept and ' maintained a guarantee
fund in United States legal tender notes in
cluding treasury notes of 1830 equal to thirty
per cent of their outstanding circulating
notes, and that such have promptly redeemed
their circulating notes when presented at
their principal or branch office
I conclude this communication, fully appre
ciating that the responsibility for legislation
affecting the people of the United States rests
upon their representatives in congress and
assuring them that whatever accordance with J
recommendations I have made or not I shall
be glad to co-operate in perfecting any legisla
tion that tends to the pros perity and welfare
of onr people.

TOO POOR.
Trade With Poor People Does
Not Pay.
As Many Made Idle During; the Week a
Are Employed Neither an Enlarge
ment of the Working Force
Nor Better Wages.
Changes Without Improvement.
New York, December 3. R. G. Dun &
Co.'s Weekly Review of Trade says:
The complete success of the government
loan and the replenishment of the gold re
serve have not perceptibly affected business
nor prevented an advance of foreign ex.
change near the exporting point. Mean
while, domestic trade and industry have
net been influenced by the heavy defalca
tion in one bank and minor disorders in two
others, nor by failures of the Erie railway
to meet inter3St on its bonds. The closing
of sugar refineries will diminish the indus
trial force more than it is increased by the
resumption of the Bethlehem steel works
and a few other concerns. The control
ling fact is. that although in two instances
wages have been increas?d, the earnings of
the working force, and its purchasing power
re not, on the whole, enlarcins at pres
ent and prices of the chief farm products do
no matcrially improve.
Wheat is 1'4 cents higher th"n a week ago
ana western receipts still exceed last year s,
amounting since July 1 to 103,700,000 bush
els Against 100.800,000 last year, while exports
from all ports have been about 21,000,000
bushels smaller.
The smaller quantity received last year
paid more debts by about $3,000,000 than
the large quantity this year and wheat sell
ing for the first time below 50 cents just
alter harvest may naturalfy be held back
tor better returns.
Corn has advanced a fraction. receiDts be
ing larger than a year ago, and on the whole
the outcome for farmers has not so im
proved as to promi&e larger buying by the
the west and south.
The great industries fairly maintain the
production previously reported, but cannot
be expected to increase at this season.
A few more iron works have gone into
operation and the demand is reported lareer.
but there is a distinct weakness in prices,
especially at Pittsburs. and Bessemer iron
billets, nails and some structural forms are
quoted lower. The rail combination bis
agreed to a reduction of $2 per ton for the
next year.

Germans Too Poor to Buy.
Washington, D. C, December 3. Secre
tary Morton is in receipt of a communica
tion from John Mattes, jr., special agent to
the department of agriculture in Germany,
referring to -possibilities of extending the
market in that country for American meats.'
Mr. Mattes writes under date of Kovember
15 as follows: '"Last year German farmers
and stock breeders were compelled to sell
their cattle irrespective of price and condi
tion. It was then predicted that Germany
would be short on beef cattle, resulting in a
rapid advance in the price of meat, which
would give foreign meat exporters an oppor
tunity to establish themselves in the German
market., I have visited many of the princi
pal German cities and paid attention to the
sales of imported meats, but in my opinion
Germany will never become a large con
sumer of imported meats. It is true the
consumption of American salted bacon and
other meat products in cans may increase
in such abnormal years, but under normal
conditions it may be said the poorer classes
cannot allow themselves the luxury. The
more fortunate are, as a rule, unreasonably
prejudiced against foreign meats.
"The sale of imported fresh meats is, how
ever, conducted with many difficulties and
possibly with great lo8 to the exporters,
brought about by local regulations. At the
best, the business always rests upon a specu
lative foundation."
New Rules for Diagnosing Lung Diseases.
Cincinnati, Ohio, December 3. Special.
An edition of 100,000 copies of Prof. W.
R. Amick's new treaties on lung diseases has
just been sent out to physicians by the
Amick Chemical company, compounders of
Dr. Amick's Chemical Treatment. Old
practitioners say the book contains the most
complete set of rules for diagnosing con
sumption ever published. The disease is
divided into distinct phases and stages, ena
bling the least experienced to determine the
condition of the patient's lungs. Indica
tions for treating complications are given,
together with many valuable prescriptions.
The company will distribute from Cincin
nati a large free edition to consumptives
throughout the country.
Monument to an Invader.
Montbeal, December 3. The Quebeo
Press is loud in condemnation of the pro
posal to erect a monument to the memory
of General Montgomery in Quebec.
The Chronicle says: "Let Montgomery's
memory alone. He came here as an inva
der and got just what we hope to give every
invader. When Americans come here as
friends they will get the warm welcome
which Canada always gives to visitors and
especially to Brother Jonathan."
Other journals express similar view.
To Arrest Millionaires.
New York, December 3. The sheriff of
this county has received, from a sheriff in

Dear Sib: I have mailed your governor.
RP. Flower, requisition papers for John
D. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller, Henry
M. Flagler, John D. Archibald, Benjamin
Brewster, Henry H. Rogers, Wesley H. Til-
ford, of your city. W hen you receive the
governor a warrant please execute at once

A Batch of Resolutions.
During the first session of the senate a
number of resolutions were presented and
referred to appropriate committees. Among
them are :
Senator George, democrat, of Mississippi,
one, directing the committee on rules to re
port a revision of rules with a view of expe
diting business and compelling a vote. . t
Senator Hoar, one requesting the president
for information not incompatible with the
public service, concerning the recent mas
sacres of Armenians in Turkey and as to
what protests, memorials, etc., had beea
presented by American citizens.
Senator Turpie, democrat, one. reciting
that the time had come for the election of
United States senators by direct vote of the
people.
Senator Blanchard, one, protesting against
the recent Turki-h atrocities against Armen
ians, and directing that the remonstrance of
this government be communicated to
Turkey.
Senator Peffer, two. One directing the
judiciary committee of the senate to investi
gate, the circumstances and legal authority
under which the secretary of the treasury
made the last two issues of bonds. The sec
ond resolution calls on the president for in
formation concerning the circumstances and
necessity for sending United States troops
to Chicago during the pendency o"f the Pull

All That Can be Afforded. '
Tofeka, December 5. General Manager
J. J. Frey, of the Santa Fe, does not believe
there is any immediate prospect that the)
company can employ additional men in its
machine and repair shops at Topeka or else
where. In his judgment the company al
ready has all the employes that the business
will justify. .
"There will have to be a decided increase
of business," he says, "before the force can
be increased. Indeed, we are endeavoring
to cut down expenses wherever we can,
rather than increase them. The notion that
work is accumulating is erroneous. If the
traffic demanded further work wo certainly
would have it done, but everything necessa
rily depends on the demand. We thought
last year's business was poor enough, but
this year is much worse, and I can see no
reasonable prospect of an immediate in
crease. There is no corn to handle and the)
cattle shipments are practically over for the
season. We are employing about two-thirds
of a usual force at the shops and from pres
ent indications that is all we need.
"In regard to general business I think
there are some evidences of improvement,
but it is coming slowly, and I do not be
lieve we will realize any great business re
vival this winter."
Report of Pension Bureau.
The report of the pension bureau shows
that the entire number of pensioners upon
the rolls June 30, 1804, was 969,544. The esti
mate for the fiscal year 1896 is $140,000,000.
Pensioners added to the roll during the
year was 39,055; number dropped 37,951.
1 he greater part of the cases now pend
ing in the bureau are old cases. Many of
them have been pending for years, and have
been examined one or more times prior to
the present administration. Upon examina
tion it has been found, in many instances,
that proof was not sufficient to sustain a
pension. The attention of the applicants
having been called to the defect in some
cases, efforts have been made to supply the
needed testimony.
the great discrepancy between the num
ber of cases now beinz allowed and the
number allowed two or more years ago
grows out of the fact that the pending cases
constitute a remnant of an immense number
of claims, of which those well established
have already been adjudicated.
Ihe secretary says the work accomplished
in eighteen and a half months is unprece
dented in the history of the department, be
ing more than twice the number of cases
disposed of in a like period by the prior ad
ministration. Policy About Indian Schools.
Washington, D. C, December 5. Secre
tary Hoke Smith thus expressed his policy
for Indian schools:
"I agree fully with those who oppose the
use of public money for the support of sec
tarian schools. But this question should be
considered practically. The schools have
grown up. Money has been invested m
their construction for the time when they
were recognized as wise instrumentalities
for the accomplishment of good. I do not
think it proper to allow the intense foelintr
of opposition to sectarian education, which
is showing itself all over the land, to induce
the department to disregard existing insti
tutions. We need the schools now or else
we need a large, appropriation to' build
schools to take their place.
"it would scarcely be lust to abolish them
entirely, to abandon a policy so long recog
nized. My own suffeestion is that they
should decrease at the rate of not less than
20 per cent a year.
"lhis is the policy which is now control
ling the department and unless it is changed
by legislation it will continue. The decrease
in the amount allotted for the the present
fiscal year is 20 per cent."
Cholera Fund Held Up. ,
Topes a. December 5. In a lengthy opin
ion handed down by Judge Hazen, of the
district court, in the famous "cholera fund
cise" the court decided in brief that this
state was not threatened during the year
1894 with an invasion of the cholera and for
that reason that the defendants have no ,
right to draw any portion of the cholera
appropriation. Atemporary injunction will
be allowed.
Judge Hazen bases his opinion on the
grounds that the legislature intended the
appropriation to be used only in case of
actual invasion of the state by the disease
and the evidence showed that this never oc-.'
cured, nor was at any time imminent.
Appointment of Librarian.
! Topeka, December 5. The supreme court
has issued an order appointing James L.
King, of this city, state librarian to fill the
vacancy caused by thedeath of H. J. Dennis.
Mr. King will assume the duties of the
position at once. He is required by law to
give bond in the sum of $10,000, which he
will do immediately and enter upon the du
ties to which he has beenappoioted.
