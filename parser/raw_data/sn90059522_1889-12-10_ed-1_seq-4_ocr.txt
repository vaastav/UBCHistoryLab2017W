I.KF.P AN fcYK ON **n.KM.
That there are wounds and heartaches
resulting from the late senatorial fight
in North Dakota is fairly evident from
the way a leading Dakota politician
talked to BrDD Reeve the other day.
And it is natural that there should be.
With all the scandals that have been at
tached to senatorial elections within re
cent years there ha. nowhere been a
grosser exhibition of perfidy, combined
with skullduggery, than was displayed
in the North Dakota senatorial election.
That high sense of personal honor
which is nowhere so essential as in pol
itics was utterly lacking. A political
combination is In the nature of a con
tract formed solely upon honor, for in
demnity bonds cannot be given or
taken, nor is there any method of re
dress in case of a forfeiture of the con
tract. That peculiar sense of honor
which is supposed to prevail even
among thieves is the sole secur
ity of the politician who enters
a combine. Hence it 19 looked upon
in political circles as the basest
perfidy for a man to betray the confi
dence reposed in him by his political
associates. It is a singular fact that in
the election of North Dakota senators
this element of political integrity was
wholly eliminated. Taking the state
ment of Gov. Orbwa _'s friends as the
basis of our remarks, and they surely
know the facts, we find that there was
a combination between Pierce and
Obi* way, by which the latter was to
help tiro former to knock the tallest
persimmon* then, in return for such,
service, the former was to help the lat
ter to the second seat of honor. Ord
way performed his part of the contract
to the letter, and then the combine
.seemed to have exhausted itself. When
Pierce "rot safely boused in the sena
torial fold he- apparently forgot that
Ordway was still on the outside, and
gave his attention so exclusively to the
enjoyment of bis new-born dignity he
rendered himself unconscious of the hul
labaloo that was being raised out of doors
by his failure to observe the conditions
of the original contract by which he had
profited. Ordway bavins fallen a vie-"
tim to misplaced confidence, young Mr.
Johnson was about to walk off with the
contested prize when he suddenly found
himself victimized more outrageously
than Ordway had been. He was not
tbe victim of one man's treachery alone,
but was robbed of his victory by the
most perfidious job that was ever put up
in a party caucus. The man who was
on the shearing train with Uvdd
Reeve the other day told all about how
it was done, and the story was printed
in yesterday's Globe. But his narrative
did not stop there. Ho revealed an
other plot that was being hatched by
these conscienceless conspirators to steal
the school lands of North Dakota from
the poor children of the young state.
And it is to that more than to the other
part of his narrative that we wish to di
rect the attention of the people of North
Dakota, because it is a contemplated
outrage, that they can provide against
and defeat if they once realize the im
portance of determined action. It has
been the experience with all new states
that the school lands proved the most
tempting morsel for the sharks who are
always hanging around on the lookout
for "jobs." That the speculators have
considerable interest in the North Da
kota legislature is pretty well demon
strated by the result of the late sena
torial elections. Putting the two facts
together, that the land sharks are on the
ground in numbers, and that the school
lands are to be disposed of, we can
readily believe that there is a job in
contemplation; and the sooner the tax
payers of the new state awaken to the
danger which menaces them, the better
it will be for them. At all events, there
is enough in the situation to justify the
keeping of a close watch on the move
ments of these fellows, to see that there
is no underhand legislation adopted. It
doesn't hurt an honest man to watch
him, and a rogue needs it,
AFTER ALLISON'S SCALP.
The labor organizations in lowa have
taken the field against Senator Alli
son. Their grievances and grounds of
opposition are elaborated over an area
sufficient for the framework of a large
party. The gist of their indictment is
that in his public career of a quarter of
a century he has constantly been the
servitor of .corporations, combinations,
trusts, monopolies,and in the interest of
favored classes as against the many.
Aside from the length of his service it
is not seen that he stands apart from
his chief party associates in his activi
ties and operations in official life. The
Cedar Rapids Gazette, speaking in the
interest of the Republican party, re
joices in this movement of the labor ele
ments, and expresses confidence that the
new designation of the senator will be
Dennis. It asserts that a majority of
the candidates for the legislature in
structed for Allison were defeated, and
in many instances because they were so
instructed. In its view the fate of the
gentleman is sealed. The names
of various other gentlemen are can
vassed, and the prediction 'hazarded
that the successor to Allison will bo
Judge Rotiikock, who has been elected
chief justice. .He is vouched for as a
Republican who has always stood in the
party traces with absolute docility, and
whose election will cc iientaud harmo
nize all the discordant elements, while to
elect Allison will be the suicide of the
party in that state. It is beyond ques
tion that Allison will have the nomi
nation of his party in caucus; and if he
is defeated, it will be the result of a
combination of bolting Republicans with
the Democrats. Of course, it would bo
a shock to the Democrats to see the
o. p. commit suicide; but If another Ke
puolican who holds the same political
faith as Allison is to be chosen, it is
not seen why they should take any
hand in the matter. The present mem
ber is not personally odious to them.
He may be rather too fond of lingering
at the Shoreham, but the experience of
the Democrats in helping elect bolting
Republicans 'to the senate is not spe
cially encouraging.
THF CAI.-c/I.IC BANK.
The New York Herald has discovered
a veritable mare's nest, which is excit
ing the wonder, as well as arousing the
suspicions, of the gentlemen who manip
ulate Wall street. The new-born scheme
is no other than a plan to establish a
colossal bank ami trust company in New
York under the patronage of Rome.
which will be, when organized, the
most gigantic financial scheme of the
world. Having resurrected and secured
an old Tweed charter, under which all
sorts of business can be carried on, and
which is pronounced by the attorney
general of New York to be perfectly
sound and in force, the projectors of
the plan propose . to organize, with a
capital of 100,000.000. under the name
of the Universal Association Bank and
Trust company, and will not only
receive and care for the immense
revenu -s of the church, but the
private fortunes of its members.
The moneys of all other persons and
sa.ts are to be Invested as well. The
Herald has information that the pope
has already bestowed his benediction
upon the enterprise, and that it is pro
posed to « stablish branches of the New
York concern in each of the. European
capitals.
If the enterprise succeeds— antl there
seems to be but little doubt of its suc
cess—it will be the most powerful com
bination of capital that the world has
ever known, and will wield a vast sec
ular influence, as well as religious. It is
sure to meet with most positive opposi
tion, especially in this country, where
there is such a strong popular prejudice
against aggregated capital in any form,
and a serious apprehension that the Ro
man church has designs upon our polit
ical institutions. These fears and prej
udices, however, may be overcome by
the persons in charge of the enterprise,
and in the end it may be demonstrated
that the great religious trust will prove
a public benefit. In appearance, at
least, it is an approach toward the the
ory of nationalism, and may bo the first
step in the direction of reaching the
Bellamy period.
HERD'S COMMITTEES.
The laborer is worthy of his hire. So
there will be no disappointment in
Minnesota over the announcement that
Congressmen Lini> and Comstock were
comfortably provided for by Speaker
Reed in making up the committees of
tho house. These gentlemen are the
Butchers who saved the day for Reed
wheu defeat stared him in the face; and
although they betrayed the inteiests of
their section by deserting, a Western
man, they are fairly entitled to the re
ward of their flop-over. Speaker Reed
is a man who takes care of "his friends,
and usually punishes his enemies. It
must have been a bitter pill for him.
therefore, when the venerable Pit; Iron
Kelly declined to accept the chair
manship of the committee on ways
and means, and left Reed no
alternative but to appoint McKin
ley. This will give the latter gen
tleman an opportunity to lead his party
on the floor, and if he bandies himself
properly in that position, he can make
himself the presidential candidate of his
party at the next election. Mr. Can
non goes to the head of the appropria
tion committee in the line of promotion:
and yet, to assure himself of this post,
lie had to consent to a transfer of some
of his force in the speakership contest
to his successful competitor. It is evi
dent from the way his committees are
constituted that Mr. Reed intends to
keep his grip, on the house, and will
force the Pennsylvania idea into all
tariff legislation. He knows what he
was elected for, and is going to stick to
business. ' ''/•- '--'•■' --
It is estimated by the Paris police
that there were one-fourth as many
visitors to the exposition from South
America as from the United States.
They have less than half the population,
and are supposed to be a good ways be
hind this country in wealth and geo
graphical knowledge. They have a
much longer journey and fewer means
of communication. It is surprising that
there should be such a representation
of them over the Atlantic, and it is sug
gestive of more extensive business rela
tions with the European countries.
They are objects of curios'ty
in this country as yet. There
ought to be several, times as
many at the fair of 1892, and no doubt
will be, if the relations of .those coun
tries with this are generously and ju
diciously fostered. They should bo
among the largest participants from
abroad in the great exhibit.
A man who makes claim -to honest,
high-toned dealing, like the president,
should be above trying to hoodoo the
farmers with the notion that the protect
ive principle may be "fairly applied to
the products of our fields as well ■as of
our shops." How. would it belpthe pro
ducers if there were even a prohibitory
tariff on wheat, cotton, corn and the
other staples that a market abroad is
needed for? -

Ex-Go v. Gear, of lowa, admits that
he was stunned by the result of the
election in that state, and, after serving
on the inquest, has concluded that it is
a warning from the people to the Re
publican party "to cut loose from its
high protection theories and at once set
about a radical reform of the preseut
revenue system," or give up all hope of
getting out of the bone-yard in that
state. That is a rational diagnosis.
If a Minneapolis syndicate put up
$35,000 for the use of a Dakota seat in
the United States senate for a favorite
for two years, and it proves to bo a four
years' lease, is there any moral obliga
tion on them to add to the premium?
Possibly candidates who paid campaign
expenses and were sold out by supposed
friends can give the ethical view.

MOUUNEKS Al* DAVIS' BIER.
Nearly 100,000 Persons Have
Viewed the Body or the States
muu.
New Orleans, Dec. 9.— The number
of people pressing into the city hall to
view the body of Jefferson Davis to-day
was not diminished by the rainy
weather. Many strangers are
arriving in the city to join the
ranks of the mourners. The city
officials are of the opinion that under
the peculiar circumstances of the case,
Secretary of War Proctor's reply to
Way Shakespeare's announcement of
Mr. Davis" death was very graceful,
and gave evidence of a kindly spirit.
The Picayune says:
We are strongly led to tho conclusion that
the secretary of war so far from intending
wrong, has adopted what he believed, and
what we believe, was a wise and conserva
tive course in the premises.
All the confederate veterans are very
much pleased with the fraternal spirit
which characterized the rem rk of Capt.
Jacob Gray, of the Grand Army of the
Republic, made before .the executive
committee last Saturday night Captain
Gray stated that he would be proud as a
soldier of the United States- to honor
the memory of the illustrious patriot,
soldier and statesman of the South. He
could not forget that " Jefferson Davis
had been also a soldier of the United
States, who had rendered distinguished •
servi?e, or fail to recognize that Jie was
a great and pure man. Jefferson Davis
should, as a gallant soldier, be accorded
a soldier's burial -with every show of
the profoundest respect and love of the
people. ' - .-'--..v ""-."- .-:-.
"If it is agreed," continued Capt. Gray,
"that the body of the dead chieftain shall be
borne into the cemetery upon tbeshoullers
of the old veterans, I, as a representative of
the Grand Army of the Republic, shall cer
tainly demand to have the right to assist in
the performauce of that sad and honorable
duty." " ..-,--
It is learned that all the army officers,
while they cannot take any official
action in regard to the death of Mr.
Davis, have great respect for him as a
soldier and a statesman, and will attend
the tuneral. A meeting of Southern ed
itors has been called here for Wednes
day, In order to set upon plans
for furthering the movement for
a monument" to the aeceased.
In response to a telegram from Gen.
Gordon, at the head of the Confederate
veterans. Gov. Nichols has appointed a
committee, of which Associate .Justice
Feuner is chairman, to take charge of
the fund to be raised for Mrs. Davis and
her daughter. By midinght it is cal
culated 100,000 people will, have
passed the bier. Among those Who
came to-day were the foreign con
suls, the pupils of the high schools,
and many Catholic priests and other
clergymen. The floral offerings to-day
were many and beautiful. A handsome
floral anchor was sent anonymously by
a British sailor.

A COMEDY OF ERRORS. -
A Runaway Bovine Causes a
Queer Complication.
New York, Dec. 9.— -At about 4
o'clock this afternoon Frank Fah came
along down First avenue leading a cow
with a rope. At the corner of Eightieth
street the cow broke Fall's hold of the
rope and, rushing on the sidewalk, at
tacked Mrs. Mary Foster, severely in
juring her. An excited mob pursued
the cow and captured her at Seventy
eighth street and tied her to a telegraph
pole. Policeman Moore then came
along. Some one brought a truck on
which they tried ineffectually to get tne
animal, Undertaker Donnelly saw the
predicament Moore was in andasked his
workman Joseph Farrelly to get some
boards to slide the cow on the truck.
Before Farrelly had time to return. Of
ficer Sharkey relieved Policeman Moore
and the latter left the scene. Shortly
afterwards Moore's regular relief. Po
liceman. Baurmstroff, who had heard
nothing of the runaway cow, came
along and charged: into the
crowd and struck Farrolly, who had
returned with the board. Next he at
tacked Undertaker Connelly," and then
started for the station house with Far
relly. A large crowd followed and
pelted the officer with stones. On the
way Baurmstroff kicked Mrs. A.M.
Murphy, who . stood on the
sidewalk. , Ex-Sergeant Roberts re
monstrated with Baurmstroff and
he, too, was placed under arrest. " Be
fore they reached the station house
Baurmstroff got into a dispute with
George J. Maher, and having secured
the assistance of another officer, ar
rested him. All of the prisoners were
locked up, charged with assault. It is
not known what became ot the cow.

Washington, Dec. 9.—Representa

here. Besides preparing several bills,
be has found time to get around the de

eral Minnesotians. E. A. Townsend
and J. 11. Matilc, of Duluth, have been
given berths in the government print
ing office, and Mrs. Everett B. Morse, of
St. Cloud, has been found a place in the
census bureau. Mr. Townsend was
formerly a reporter on the Duluth Par
agrapher, and was also connected with
a labor paper in the same town. To
day Mr. Comstock : presented several
private pension bills. A bill for the re
lief of certain Sioux scouts, who re
mained loyal in 160., will also be pre
sented at an early date. It will be re
membered that under an order of the in
terior department, issued about two
years ago, settlers located on indemnity
lands of the Northern Pacific railroad.
Many of them proved up on their lands,
which were afterwards declaired the
propetty of the Northern Pacific, being
situated in its grant. For the relief of
these settlers air. Comstock has a bill in
preparation.
An attempt will be made to form a
new laud district in Minnesota, with
headquarters' at Fergus Falls. The ter
ritory covered by this office will be
taken from the Crookston and St. Cloud
districts. The necessity for this parti
tion has arisen through the opening of
so much Indian land to settlement, and'
the prospective opening of so much
more will make this new district an im

RIVERS AND HARBORS
are not being neglected. Appropria

of Duiuth harbor, for dams and dredg

sota are a unit on all questions affecting
the trade of the great lakes. They will

in asking for heavy appropriations for
the immediate completion of the Sault

ments, as they realize the absolute im

Senator Washburn has tired of living
at the Arlington. Ho had a handsome :
suite of rooms there, but never thought*
he would be really comfortable. After
some looking around he has found a

has a small lawn in front surrounded by

\ A YANKEE SCHEME.
Tfte" Board of Trade May Ad ver
»| -*.,.-■.- - , :*tiß'e^he : Town. rf -' u^'. ££p*j
! John Oilman!* a gentleman fiilling
every requisite hi the make-up of ; the
ideal Yankee, was yesterduy morning
given five minutes by the board of
trade to explain to that august body a
it-tie scheme of his own for a railroad
industrial exhibit.' Mr. John Oilman
is from Worcester, Mass., and
he grabbed, his five minutes
by the first second and filled
each individual minute of it so full of
talk that when he had closed the
"prominent citizens" of the board of
trade felt as though they had received'
the coiite"i:U> of an hour's address. This
.Yankee's scheme is for all the promi
nent cities of the United States to fit a
car with tneir peculiar products. The
train will start from some place in the
far West in a short time, will be added
to, a car at a time, on its journey east
ward, stopping at all available points
along the route until it reaches Minne
apolis next June. From here it will go
to Chicago, and on East through the
prominent Eastern cities, arriving com
plete at Washington.
j The scheme is to send agents ahead:
of the train to get. up cattle and horse
shows at the towns in which the train
exhibit is made.. Admission will be :
charged to these and premiums given.
The train will form the principal attrac
tion, however. The cities represented
in the train will in this way receive a
wide advertisement. Every place that
-Mr. Oilman has proposed the. scheme so
far, except at St. - Paul, the cars have
been provided, and Duluth. Marquette,
Sioux City. Omaha and . North Dakota
are on the list. The board ot trade ap
pointed a committee to investigate the
matter. ' .
IN THE MUNICIPAL COURT.
Large Chunks of Justice Dis
pensed by Judge Emery.
The bull-pen in the municipal court
was crowed yesterday when Judge Em
ery took his seat on the bench and Offi
cer John Byrnes rapped three times on
the table for order. There were fifteen
ordinary-looking men who had com
mitted the heinous offense of hiding too
much beer and whisky under their
waistcoats on Saturday evening. One
after another was called up until an
even dozen had been sentenced to pay a
fine of "510 each or fifteen days in the
ivdrkhouse. ■ The other three had been
before the court on the same charge be
fore, and they were given the choice of
paying a fine of $20 or finishing the year
of 1890 by working out their board on
the rock-pile controlled by Supt. West.
f "-'
I There was a cranning of necks and a
hum of expectancy as Judge Emery
called "'John L. Sullivan." Many of
the spectators expected to see the tall,
broad-shouldered, short-haired young
man, who is now said to be tho cham
pion of the world, stand- up before the
court and offer to give the judge $1,000
in cold, hard cash if his honor would put
on the gloves and stand in front of him
four • rounds. Marquis of Queensberrv,
or any other rules. But the spectators
were disappointed. It wasn't the
champion pugilist at all, aud his name
wasn't Sullivan either, but he assumed
that cognomen apparently for the pur
pose of paralyziug the court. He was
charged with disorderly conduct, but
the judge suspended sentence, and it's
dollars to doughnuts that he will never
be run in again on that charge.
''■'■ John Curran, William If - McFarlaud
Michael McGood," John Connelly, and-
Robert Reynolds wero a tough-looking
crowd. The police had locked them up
on the charge of vagrancy. They all
pleaded guilty, - but Judge Emery sus
pended a sentence of ninety days in the
workhouse to allow them to leave the
city." ';~ ' '-..":■
5 Dr.* Hugh Nelson, of • 224 Washington
avenue south, was before the court on a
warrant sworn out . by Thomas J. Left
wich, charging him with cruelty to -a
doe. The doctor was in a jocular mood
and took . his dog into the court room.
As he stood in front of the clerk's desk
he-patted the dog on the head and paid
no attention to the reading of the - com
plaint. i ■ ~ . •
.' "What Is your plea?" inquired . Col.
Smith.
." Tins doctor made no reply, and Judge
Emery exclaimed:
"Are you guilty or not guilty?"
"Sit up, sir, and speak to tho Judge.
Sit up, sir," ordered tho doctor, address
ing the dog. . The Intelligent brute
placed his fore feet on the rail surround
ho clerk's desk and looked inquiringly
at the court.-. ....
"■Officer." commanded Judge Emery,
"remove that dog and lock tho prisoner
up. The court finds you guilty of con
tempt, and sentences you to an impris
onment In the city prison for twelve
hours. After that you can give bail In
the sura of $50 for your appearance at 0
o'clock tomorrow morning." Dr. Nelson
was taken to tho lockup. '
' "Olive Machen" was the name given
by a coy young damsel who voluntarily
walked into the court room and pleaded
guilty to keeping a bouse of ill-fame at
Fourth street and Second avenue south.
The place was xi formerly run by
"Mother" Lloyd, but Olive said she was
now responsible. She paid the usual
illegal license fee of $100, and the police
will allow her to run the establishment
for another month. v- .- ■-.

Social Evening.
The Michigan association had its first
social gathering of the winter last night
at Curtis hall. The attendance was
made up of the most genial of people,
and though at tbe opening of the even
ing few of the 100. present were ac
quainted with many of the other mem
bers of the party, acquaintances were
rapidly made, and a most enjoyable
evening followed. A musical pro
gramme opened the evening, and this
was followed by cards and a social good
time. Later in the evening dancing
was enjoyed. The social occasions of
this association have always been the
most delightful affairs, and regular
meetings, with set programmes, will
soon be instituted for the winter.

In considering a war drama it is es
sential that the impulses of patriotism
and the inborn appreciation of military
pomp and circumstances should not be
confounded with the intrinsic merit of
the play. It must be regarded calmly
from the standpoint of abstract criti
cism, irrespective of the superficial
emotions likely to be stirred up.
"Marching Through Georgia" as a song
contains but very little artistic compo
sition from a musical standpoint, but
let it bo sung in the presence of a lot of
veterans, or where war incidents are
often related, and the associations
with the melody will cause every nerve
to vibrate with what might be called ex
a'lisitc painful recollections. A canvas
that pictures the story of Atlanta,' and
even the crippled veteran hobbling
through the streets, is likely to stir a
flood of tender memories in the • hearts
attuned-"' to 1' the music ;of the
Union. Perhaps for " these • reasons "
to some extent William Gillette's
"Held by the Enemy," which was pre
sented at the Grand last ' night,
owes some of its brilliant success.
But it is a great play aside
from • its patriotic sentiment. One
remarkable thing about the performance
is that it does not appeal to sectional
prejudice, but the nobility of nature in
the soldier in "gray" is as roundly ap
plauded as the "boy in blue," and there
is a sparkling vein of comedy running
through the play that is seldom equaled
in American dramas. The company
which presented "Held by the Enemy"
last night is a most evenly balanced and
excellent one. Especially is this true of
the gentlemen who played Maj. Gen.
Stain burg, Col. Prescott and Lieut.
Bayne. The ladies were excep
tionally clever, and the good-sized
audience highly appreciated the entire
company's efforts. The same bill will
continue to-night and to-morrow night,
and should be witnessed by all who
hold in their hearts memories of the
late conflict between the North and
South.
The sale of spats for Louis James' en
gagement at the Grand commences this

"A Soap Bubble" opened a week's
engagement last night at the Bijou with
Ed J. Connelly as Wiley Dodge and V.
Ray Silent, the leading parts. Much of
.the zest of this once popular comedy
has been lost owing to the lar
ceny of many of its best feat
ures by other comedy companies. -
And, like "Uncle Tom's Cabin," the
play does not improve with ago. Mr.
Connelly is an actor of some merit, and
Miss Lucy Dodge is a charming sou
brette, but exhibits no particular merit
until her specialty parts In the last act.
The whole company is composed of
specialty people, and the show fairly
enjoyable throughout. The audience
comfortably filled the house. :".y: "■''
