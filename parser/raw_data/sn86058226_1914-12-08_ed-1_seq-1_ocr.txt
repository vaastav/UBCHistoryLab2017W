gests Town Meetings.
A resolution ordering the board of
public works to install rest rooms for
men and women at or near the corner
of Eighth and Main streets was intro
duced In council last evening by Coun
cllinan Steinbrink, and It provoked
quite a discussion, although all the
eouncilmen agreed that such Institu
tions were needed in a city the size of
Richmond.
Mayor Robbins flashed the high-cost-of-running-a-city
warning and con
cluded by informing council that such
a resolution should not be adopted
without mature consideration. He said
It was one which required much
thought, and upon his advice it was
referred to the committee on public
y el fare.
Cite Dickinson Plan.
It was pointed out that the Dickin
son Trust company proposes to es
tablish public rest rooms for both men
and women in its new building at the
corner of Eighth and Main streets,

et'ter banking hours an arrangement

closed.
Councilman Burdsall touched upon a
topic which somewhat nettled the nia
or. street paving. He wanted to know
if the board intended to take no action
on the petition for paving North Ninth
street, because the city might have
to pay the cost of the improvement
In front of the federal building, nurd
pall said that North Ninth rtreet,
one of the city's principal thorough
fares, was in terrible condition and
nhould be paved its entfre length.
"Oh, that's newspaper talk." replied
Mayor Robbins, tartly. "The petition
has merely been under advisement.'
Playing politics or something, maybe.
They pat you on the back and say
you are all right, you know."
Other counciltnen then expressed
the opinion that North Ninth street
Ftood badly in need of permanent im
provement. Suggests Town Meeting.
Councilman Walterman apologeti
cally remarked that he understood the
mayor's advisory board had not been a
romplete success, and he offered the
suggestion that in t ho future a sort of
town meeting bo held, the first Monday
night each month, when the city of- I
ficcrs and representatives of the va
rious civic organisations should meet
with the councilinen.
This did not make a hit, principally
because it was thought such sessions
would he entirely too long, nor did the
suggestion of having councilmen at
tend the meeting of the mayor's cahi-,
the second Monday each month, make
an appeal. "We don't get no money
for attending such meetings," remark
ed one of the city dads.
A resolution was finally adopted re
quiring every head of a city depart
ment to attend each council meeting.

of a machine was passed. The chassis ;
of a small car will be purchased and !

was also passed authorizing the city
engineer to attend the good roads cori-
press at Chicago. December 14 and 15. '
Waltermann recommended an ordi-
nance requiring all horses standing on
the street in winter be kept blanketed,
but was informed that a state law gov
erned this mutter, so it was referred to
the police department.

sorrow over the death of the late Dor

More than one hundred thousand Rus

today.
Warsaw is now the goal of the Ger

fall of Lodz. This is made clear in an
official review of the military situa
tion issued here today. It says con
cerning the Warsaw goal:
"The investment of Warsaw should
result from the present operations it

The operations in Poland, which

"That news of decisive actions in

says the official review, "is shown by
the latest reports from headquarters

that the operations thus far have
been successful."
Reports sent from Russia that the
Czar's troops defeated the Germans in

Berlin Denies French Claims of Advance in Argonne Forest
No Attacks There for Long Time Past Kaiser's Army
Continuously Gains Ground.
BY FREDERICK WERNER,
Staff Correspondent The International
News Service.
BERLIN, Dec. 8. An official report
from the general staff issued here this
afternoon states that theGermans have
captured the French positions at Ma
lincourt in the western theatre of war,
and in the eastern arena are closely
pursuing the retreating Russians.
When the Germans took Maiincourt,
east of Varonnes, the greater part of
the garrison fled, it is stated. The re
mainder, two officers and 150 men,
were captured. The French attacked
the German position north of Nancy
on Monday, but were repulsed. The
report follows:
"In northern Poland the Germans
are closely pursing the retreating en
emy. East and southeast of Lodz the
I Russians lost fifteen hundred prison
ers, sixteen cannon and many ammuni
tion carts. In southern Poland nothing
of special importance has happened.
"The French statement claiming an
advance by them in the Argonne forest
Is not correct. There have been no
French attacks in that region for a
long time. We are continuously gain
ing ground. On Sunday we captured
the French position at Maiincourt.

the money he had on his person, and

After the robbery Carr went to bis

the case to the police. He did not
find his family physician, and when he
arrived at police headquarters blood
was gushing from an ugly wound in

on Europe before the war.
2. The merchant marine.
3. Conservation.
4. Self-government for the Phil

President Wilson declared that this

that the government had not been

to the Philippines, the president urged
the senate to sanction without delay
the bill giving the largest measure of

$10,000 Endowment of Mrs. W. D. Foulkc Refused by Reso

The Mary T. R. Foulke gift of
$10,000 to the Guest House associa

of the directors, it was learned today.
Members of the board of directors
refused to be quoted on the matter.
IThey said, however, that the financial
condition of the country Is such now
that it will be impossible to raise the
balance of $20,000 needed to meet the
requirements of the Foulke offer.
The association will continue as an
incorporated body, but will become in

Arrangements are being made to re

next week.
Mrs. Foulke allowed one year In
which to raise $20,000 and promised

and leaves no conjecture as to what is

Prepared for War.
That part of the president's message
dealing with the national defense
aroused the greatest interest as a re
sult of the recent controversy over the
country's preparedness for war at the
present time.
"We are the example and champions
of peace and concord," declared the
president. "We should be jealous of
this memorial which we have sought
to earn. We never have had, and
while we retain our present princi
ples and ideals, we never shall have
a lar&e standing army. If you ask:
1 Am wr rti'l f tn HnfiinH nnroalvael

Pend in every time of national peril, in
! tne future as in the past, not upon a
standing army, nor yet upon a re-
serve army, but upon citizens trained
and accustomed to arms."
National Guard.
President Wilson recommended that
the national guard of various states
w 1U1 ,ne esiamisnea policy or our
government.
"In conclusion of his views upon
this subject the President said:
"It is not new. there is no new need
to discuss it. We shall not alter out
attitude toward it because some among
us are nervous or excuea. we shall
for an occasion. It will be conceived
as a permanent and settled thing,
which we will pursue at all seasons,
without haste and after a fashion con
sistent with the peace of the world,
the abiding friendship of states and
the unhampered freedom of all with
whom we deal."
Merchant Marine.
The president said: "We have gross
ly erred in the way in which we have
stunted and hindered the development
of our merchant marine," but he makes
no recommendations in this direction.
The president urged a reorganization
and re-establishment of the govern
ment's various parts to secure greater
efficiency and to further the economy,
but in this connection he pointed out
that there is no waste of money at
present; that as the government and
country grew more and more, money
is needed to meet the national ex
penses. The president did not mention trusts
or recommend any legislation to
change the business slump.

but the change in financial conditions
caused a cessation of activity.
Board Members Silent.
None of the members of the board
of directors would reveal the contents
of the resolution which was the caiiso
of the bandonment of the guest house
project. It is said, however that tho
matter of postponing the guest house
campaign indefintely has been dis
cussed since August many of the mem
bers having been discouraged at the
failure of the first campaign to fill the
$20,000 fund which Mrs. Foulke men
tioned in her offer of $10,000.
The president of the board of direc
tors said that full inroruiatlou will b
