PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and House of llepresen
tatives. In coming before you for the first
time aa Chief Magistrate of this nation.
it is with gratitude to the Giver of all
good for the lenefits we enjoy. We
are blessed with peace at home, and
are without entangling alliance abroad,
or troubled to forebode. With a ter
ritory, unsurpasse in fertility, of an
area equal to the abundant support of
five hundred millions of people, and
abounding in every variety of useful
mineral, in quantities sufficient to sup
port the world for fenerations, with
A
exuberant crops ; with a variety of cli
mate adapted to the production of ev
ery species of the earth's produce, rich
and suited to the habits, tastes and re
quirements of every living thing : with
a population of forty millions of free
people, all speaking one language, with
acuities for every mortal to acquire an
education ; with institutions closing to
none tho avcuuo to fame or any bless
ing of fortune that may bo coveted ;
with freedom of the pulpit, press and
schools ; with a revenue flowing into
the national treasury beyond tho re
quirements of the Government de-
jmand. Harmony is being rapidly
restored within our borders; manu
factures hitherto unknown in our coun
try, are springing up in all directions,
producing a degree of national inde
pendence unequalled by that of any
other power. These blessings, and
countless others, are entrusted to your
care and mine, for safe keeping for the
brief period of our tenure of office. In
a short time we must each of us return
to the ranks of the people who have
conferred upon us our powers, and ac
count to them for the stewardship. I
earnestly desire that neither you or I
may be condemned by a free and en
livened constituency, nor by our own
consciousness.
Emerging from a rebellion of gigan
tic magnitude, aided as it was by the
sympathy and assistance of the nation
with which we are at peace, eleven
States of the Union were four years
ago left without .legal State Govern
ments. A debt has been contracted ;
American commerce was almost driven
from the seas : the industry of
one-
half the country had been taken from
the control of the capitalists and
placed where all labor rightfully be
longs, in the keeping of the laborers.
the cojrornox of the corxTitr.
The work of restoring State Govern
ments lo-al to the Union, of the pro
tection an-1 fostering of labor and pro
viding means for paying the interest
on the public debt has received ample
attention from Congress. Although
your efforts have not met with the suc
cess in all particulars that might have
been desired, yet on the whole they
have been "more successful than could
have been reasonably anticipated.!
Seven of the States which passed or- j
dinances of secession have been fully
restored to their places in the Union.
The eight (Georgia) has held an elec
tion at whicn she ratined a Constitu
tion, Republican in form, elected a
Governor, members of Congress and a
State Legislature, with all other offi
cers required. The Governor was duly
installed, and the Legislature met and
performed all the acts then required
of them by the reconstruction acts
of Confess. Subsequently, however,
in violation of the Constitution that
had just been ratified, as since decided
by the Supreme Court of the State,
they unseated the colored members of
the Legislature and .admitted to seats
members who are disqualified by the
third clause of the Fourteenth Amend
ment in the Constitution, an article
which they themselves had contribu
ted to ratifiy. Under these circum
stances I would submit to -ou whether
it would not be wise without delay, to
pass a law authorizing the uovernor of
Georria to convene the members orig
inally elected to the Legislature, and
requiring each member to take the
oath prescribed by the reconstruction
act. This done, those to be admitted
who are ineligible under the third
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The freedmen, under the protection
which they have received, are making
rapid progress in learning", and no
complaints are heard of a lack of in
dustry on their part when they receive
fair remuneration for their labor.
The means provided for paying the
interest on the public debt, with all
other expenses of government, are
more man ampie. xne loss or our
commerce is the only result of the re
bellion which has not received suffi
cient attention from you. To this sub
ject I call your earnest attention. I
will not now suggest the means by
which this object may be effected, but
will, if .necessary, make it the subject'
of a Bpecial message during the ses
sion of Congress. At the March term
Congress, by joint resolution, author
ized the Executive to order an election
in the States of Virginia, Mississippi
and Texas, at which was to be submit
ted the constitution which each had
previously in convention framed, and
these were to be submitted either en
tire or in separate parts to be voted on,
at the discretion of the Executive. Un
der this authority elections were call
ed in Virerinia. The election took
place on the 6th of July, 1809. The
Governor elected has been installed ;
the Legislature met ana aid all re
quired by this resolution and by the
reconstruction acts of Concrress, and
refrained from all doubtful authority.
I recommended to our Senators and
Representatives that the State be fully
restored to its place in the family of
States. Elections wexe called in Mis
sissippi and Texas, to commence on
the 30th of November, and to last two
davs in Mississippi and four days in
Texas. The elections have taken place,
but the result is not known. It is to
bo hoped that tho acts of the Legisla
ture of theso States, when thoy meet,
win do sucii as to receive yonr appro
bation, and then close tho work of re
construction.
Among tho evils growing out of tho
rebellion, and not yet referred to, is
that of oil irredeemable currency. It
is an evil which I hopo will receive
your moit earnest attention It is
duty oie of tho highest of the du
ties of the Government to secure to
the citizens a medium exchancro of un
varying talue. This implies a return
to a specie basis, and no substitute for
it can be devised. It should be com
menced now ami reached nt the earli
est practicable 'moment, consistent
with a fajr regard to the interest of tho
debtor class. Immediate rcbumption,
if practicable, would not bo desirable.
It would jcompel the debtor class to
pay beyond their contracts tho premi
um on gold at the date of their pur
chase, and would bring bankruptcy
and ruin! to thousands. Fluctuation.
however, in the paper valuo of the
measure Of all value (of gold) is detr
mental to trade. It makes the man of
business nn involuntary gambler, for
in all sales, when future payment is
to bo made, both parties speculate as
to what vjill be the value of tho curren
cy when paid and received. I earn
estly recommend to you scuh legisla
tion as will insuro' a gradual return to
specie payments, and put an immedi
ate stop to fluctuations in tho valuo of
the currency. . The methods to secure
these results aro as numerous as are
the specu lations on political economy.
To secure the latter I see but one way,
and that is to authorize the Treasury
to redeem its own paper at fixed prices
whenever presented ; to withold from
circulation all such currency redeemed
until sold again for gold. The vast
resources of tho nation, both develop
ed and undeveloped, ought to make
our credit the best on earth. With a
less burden of taxation than the citi
zens has endured for six years past,
tho entire public debt could bo paid in
ten years ; but it is desirable that tho
people should not be taxe'd to pay it in
that time. Year by year the ability to
pay increases in a rapid ratio, but tho
burden of interest ought to bo reduced
as rapidly as can be done without the
violation of the contracts. The pub
lic debt is represented in great part by
bonds, having from five to twenty and
from twenty to forty years to run,
bearing interest at the rate of six per
cent, and five per cent, respectively.
It is optional with the Government to
pay their londs at any period after the
last mentioned upon their face. The
time has already expired when a great
part of them may bo taken up,
and ihe time is rapidly approaching
when all may be. It is believed that
all which (aro now duo may be re
placed by bonds bearing a rate of in
terest not exceeding four and a half
per cent., and as rapidly as the re
mainder becomes due, that they may
be replacejd in the same way. To ac
complish this it may be necessary to
authorize interest to be paid at either
of tho three or four money centers of
Europe, 01 by any Assistant Treasurer,
at tho option of the holders of the
bonds. I 'reccommend this subject for
the consideration of Congress. Also
simultaneously with this, the proprie
ty of redeeming our currency as before
suggested, at its market valuo at tho
time tho law goes into effect ; increas
ing the rate at which currency will bo
bought or sold from day to day or
week to week, at the same rate of in
terest as the Government pays upon
its bonds.
The subject of tariff and
internal
taxation wdl necessarily receive
attention. Tho revenues of the
your
coun
try are greater than the requirements
and may with safety be reduced ; but as
the funding of the debt in four or four
and a half per cent, bonds would .re
duce the annual current expense large
ly, and then, after funding, justify a
greater reduction of taxation than
would be now expected. I suggest the
postponement of this question until
the next meeting of Congress, when it
may bo ad visable to modify taxation
and the tariff in instances where un
just or burdensome discriminations are
made by the present laws. But a gen
eral revision of tho laws regulating
this subject, I recommend the post
ponement for the present. I also sug
gest the renewal of tho tax on incomes,
but at a reduced rate, say three per
cent., this tax to expire in three years.
With the funding of the national debt,
I feel safe in saying that the taxes and
revenue from imports may bo reduced
safely from CO to 80 millions per an
num at once, and still further reduc
tion from year to year, as tho resorces
of the country are developed.
nxAyexs.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury i shows the receipts of the
Government for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1 3G0, to bo $370,943,747, and
the expenditures, including interest,
etc., to be $321,490,597. Tho esti
mates for tho ensuing year are more
favorable to the Government and will,
no doubt, show a large decrease of the
public debit. The receipts in the treas
ury beyond expenditures have exceed
ed the amount nesessary to place to
the credit of the sinking fund, as pro
vided by la w. To lock up the surplus
in the treaWy and withhold it irom
circulation would lead to such a con
traction of the currency as to cripple
trade and seriously affect the pros
pects of the country. Under these cir
cumstance!, the Secretary of the Treas
ury and myself heartily concurred in
properly using all this surplus curren
cy in the treasury for the purchase of
Government bonds, thus reducing the
iuterest bearing debt of the . country,
and of submitting to Congress the ques
tion of tho disposition to bo raado of
tho bonds. as purchased. Tho bonds
now held by the treasury amount to
about $75,000,000, including those be
longing to tho sinking fund. I re
commend that tho whole bo placed to
tho credit of tho smking fund.
Your attention is respectfully invi
ted to the recommendations of tho
Secretary of tho Treasury for tho cro
ating of tho office of Commissioner of
tho Custom Revenue, for the increase
of salary to a certain class of officials,
aJ mm m
ana uie substitution or increased na
tional funds in circulation to replace
tno outstandings per cent, certificates,
and most especially to his recommeii
dation for tho repeal of tho laws allow
ing shares of fines, penalties, forfet-
ures, etc., to tho officers of tho Gov
ernment or to informers. Tho office
of Commissioner of Internal Revenue
is one of tho most onerous and import
ant under tho Government. It falls
but littlo if any short of a Cabinet po
sition in its importance and rcponsi
bilities. It is thcreforo recommended
to such legislation aa in your judg
ment Vill place this office on a footing
of dignity commensurate with its im
portance and character, and ability
and qualifications with the class of men
rcduired to fill it properly.
as the United States i tho freest of
all nations, so its people sympathize
with all people struggling for liberty
and self-government. Rut while so
sympathizing, it is duo to our honor
that we should abstain from enforcing
our views upon unwilling nations, from
taking an inteiested part in initiatory
quarrels between different nations or
between Governments and their sub
jects. Our course should always ho in
conformity with strict justice and in
ternational law to all. Such has been
tho policy of the Administration deal
ing with these questions. For more
than a year & valuable province of
Spain, a near neighbor of ours, in
whom all our people cannot but feel a
deep interest, has been struggling for
its independence and freedom. The
peoplo and Government of tho United
States entertains the samo warm feel
ing and sympathies for the peoplo of
Cuba in their pending struggles be
tween Spain and her colonies in be
half of the latter. But the countries,
at no time, have assumed tho condi
tions which amount to war in the
sense of international law or. which
would show tho ixistenco of a poli ical
organiza'ion of insurgents sufficient to
justify a recognii ion of their belliger-J
ency. Tho frinciplo is maintained,
however, that this nation will be i's
own judge aa to tho rights of bcligcr
ency, either to a people struggling to
force themselves from a government
they believe to b oppressive, or to in
dependent nations at war with each
other. Tho United S'ates have no
disposition to interfere with existing
rela'ions of Spain to her colonial pos
sessions on this continent. They be
lieve in due time Sf ain and other Eu
ropean jowers will find their interest in
terminating these relations and estab
lishing their present dependencies as
independent powers, as members of
the family of nations. Theso depen
dencies are no longer regarded as sub
jects to transfer from ono European!
power to another. "When the present
relations of tho colonies ceoso they aro
to becomo independent powers ; exer
cising the right of choice and of f&elf- j
control in the determination of their
future condition and rehv ions with oth
er powers. Tho United States, in or
der to put a stop to bloodshed in Cuba,
and in tho interest of neighboring peo
ple, proffered their good offices to bring
the existing contest to a termination.
Tho offer not being accepted by Spain
on a basis which was believed could be
received by Cuba, it was withdrawn.
It is hoped that tho good officers of
the United S'ates may vet prove ad
vantageous for tho settlement of this
unhappy struggle. Meanwhile a num
ber of illegal expeditions against Cuba
have been broken up. It has been the
endeavor of the Administration to ex
ecute the neutrality laws in good faith,
no matter how unpleasant the task may
be, so they may avoid the sufferingwe
have endured from a lack of good faith
towards the United States by other na
tions in regard to us.
The schooner Lizzie Major was ar
rested on the high seas by a Spanish
frigate and two passengers taken from
it and carried as prisoners to Cuba.-
Representations of theso facts were
made to tho Spanish Government as
soon as official information of them
reached Washington. The two pas
sengers were set at liberty and the
Spanish Government assured the Uni
ted States that the captain of tho frig
ate, in making tho capture, had acted
without law, and that ho had been
reprimanded for tho irregularity of
his conduct, and that tho Spanish au
thorities in Cuba would not sanction
any act that could violate the rights or
treat with disrespect the sovereignty
of tho nation. The question of the
seizure of tho brig Mary Lowell at one
of the Bahama Islands by the Spanish
authorities is now tho subject of a cor
respondence between this Government
and that, of Spain and Great Britain.
The Captain General of Cuba, about
May last, ! issued a proclamation au
thorizing a search to be made of ves
sels on the high seas. Immediate re
monstrance against this was made,
whereupon tho Captain General is
sued a new proclamation, limiting tho
right of search of vessels of the Uni
ted States so far as authorized under
the treaty of 1795. : This1 proclama
tion, however, was immediately with
drawn. I have always felt that the
most intimate relations should be cul
tivated between the Republic of ; tho
United States and all independent na
tions on this continent. ' It may be well
worth considering whether treaties be
tween the United States and ' them
may not bo profitably entered into to
secure moro intimate relations, friend
ly and otherwise.
THE DA1UEN CASAL.
Tho subject of an inter-occanic ca
nal to connect tho Atlantic end Pacific
oceans, through tho Isthmus of Dari
en, is ono in which tho United States
is greatly interested. Instructions
have been given our minister at the
Republic of the United States of Col
umbia to endeavor to obtain authority
for a survey by this Government, in
order to detennino tho practicability
of such an undertaking, and a charter
for the right of way, to bo built by
a r a 1 .
pnvaie enterprise, u tno survey proves
it to be practicable.
In order to comply with tho agree
ment of the United States as to mixed
commissions at Lima for tho adjust
ment of claims, it becamo necessary to
send a Commissioner and Secretary to
Lima in August lost. No appropria
tions having been made for this pur
pose, it is now asked tl:t ono bo made,
covering tho past and future expenses
of tho commission.
FAOAOUAf
Has made tho intercourse with that
country so difficult that it has been
deemed advisable to withdraw our rep
resentative from there.
OTHER TOIXUOX AFFAIRS,
Tho good offices of tho United
States to bring about pcaco between
Spain and the South American Repub
lics with which sho is at war having
been accepted by Spain, Peru and
Chili, a congress has been invited to be
held in Washington during tho pres
ent winter.
A grant has been given to Europe
ans or an exclusive right ox transit
over the territory of Nicarp.crua. to
which Costa Rica has given its assent,
but which, it is alleged, conflict.'! with
vested rights of citizens of tho United
States. Tho Department of State
has now this subject under considera
tion. Xho Minister of Peru having made
representation that thero was a stato
(?J between Peru and Spain, and tliat
Spain was constructing in, and near
New York, Government gunboats
which might bo used by Spain in such
a way as to relievo the navaL force at
Cuba so as to operate against Peru,
orders were given to prevent their de
parture. Whether steps have bcon
taken by tho representatives of tho
Peruvian Government to prevent tho
departure of theso vessels, I do not
feel authorized to detain tho property
of tho nation with whom w arc at
peace, on a nicro executive order.
The matter has been referred to the
courts to decide.
Towards the close of tho last ad
ministration, a convention was signed
at Loudon for the settlement of all
outstanding claims between Great
Britain and tho United States, which
failed to receive tho ndvico and con
sent of tho Senators to its ratification.
Time and circumstances attending tho
negotiation of the treaty, were favora
ble to its acceptance by the peoplo of
tho United States. But its provisions
wero wholly inadequate for tho settle
ment of the inravo wrongs that had
been sustained by this Government as
well as its citizens. Tho injuries re
sulting to tho United States by reason
of the course adopted by Great Brit
ain during our late civil war in the in
creased rates of insurance, in tho di
minution of exports and imports, and
other respects to domestic industry
n a ? rf A ..'
ana proaucuon ; us encci upon tno
foreign commerce of tho country, in
the decrease and transfer to Great
Britain of our commercial marine ; in
prolongation of war and the increasod
cost, both in treasure and lives, of its
suppression, could not bo adjusted
and satisfied as ordinary commercial
claims, which continually arise between
commercial nations, and yet the con
vention treated them simply as such
ordinary claims, from which they dif
fer moro widely in the gravity cf their
character than in tho magnitude of
their amount, great even as that is.
There was found a wide difference of
opinion as to the reciprocity treaty be
tween tho United States and tho Brit
ith provinces on this continent, which
has not been favorably considered by
the Administration. Xho advantages
of such a treaty would bo totally in fa
vor of the British producer, except, pos
sibly, as to a few engaged in the trade
between the two sections, No citizen of
tbe United States would be benefitted by
such reciprocity. Oar internal taxatioa
would prove a protection to tho British
producer almost equal to the protection
which our manufacturers now receive
from that tax. Some arrangement, how
ever, for the regulation of commercial
intercourse between the United States
and the Dominion, for adjusting the
claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget
Sound Agricultural Companies, on the
part of the United States, has termina
ted its labor; the allowance of $050,000
has been made, and all the rights and ti
tles of the Company on tho territory of
tho United States have been made over,
and all rights and titles of that Company
on tho territory ot the United States
have been extinguished, and deeds for
the property of tbe Company havo been
received. An appropriation by Congress
to meet this sum is asked. TheCommis-
sion tor determining tne XNortnwestern
land boundary between the United States
and the British Possessions, under the
treaty of 1856, have completed their la
bors and the Commission has been dis
charged. . ";'
In conformity with the recommenda
tion of Congress, prpposition was early
made to the British Government, to abol
ish mixed courts, created under the trea
ty of April 18th, 1862, for the suppres
sion or the slave trade, ine ' subiect is
w
still under negotiation.
THE FBXNCII CABLE.
It having come to my knowledge that
a corporate company, organised under
British laws, proposed to land upon the
shores of the United States, and to oper
ate their sub-marine cable, under conces
sion from His iMajcety, the Emperor of
the French, with an exclusive right for
twenty years, of telegraphic communica
tion between the shores of France and
the United States, with the very objec
tionable feature of subjecting all messa
ges confided to tbetn to his Sovereignty,
and to the control of tho French Gov
ernment, I cauued tho Fronch and Brit
ish Legations at Washington to bo made
acquainted with the probable policy cf
Congress on the subject, as foreshadowed
by tho till which passed tho Senate in
March last. This drew from the repre
sentatives of the company an agreement
to accept as a basis of their operations
tho provisions of the bill, or of such oth
er enactments on the subject as might bo
passed during the approaching session of
Oongres; also, to uso their influence to
secure from tho French Govern meat a
modification of their concession, so as to
permit tho landing upon French soil of a
cable belonging to any company incorpo
rated by authority of the United States
or any State in tho United States, snd
on their part cot to oppose the cstabliab
ruent of any such caele. In considera
tion of this agreement, I directed the
withdrawal of all opposition by the Uni
ted States authorities to tho landing of
the cable and the working of it antil the
meeting of Congress. 1 regret to say
thero has been no modification , made ia
the Company' concession, npr, o far as
1 can learn, have they attempted to se
cure one. Their concession excludes the
capital ani tbe citizens of the United
States from competition upon the shores
of France. I recommend legislation to
protect the rights of citizens of tho Uni
ted States as well as the dignity and sov
ereignty of tbe nation agsinat such an
assumption. I shall aUo endeavor to se
cure by negotiations an abandonment of
principle of monopolies on ocean tele
graphing cables. Copies of this corres
pondence are herewith furnished.
FICTITIOUS CITIZENSHIP.
The unsettled political condition of these
countries less fortunate than our own
sometimes induces their citizens to come
t the United States for tbe o!e purpose
of becoming naturalized. Having se
cured this they returned to their native
country and reside there, and without
disclosins their chanse of allegiance
they accept oScial positions cf trut and
honor which can only be held by citizens
of their native land. They joarnev
under pagfport describing tbem as such
citizens, and it is only when civil discord,
after perhaps years or quiet, threatens
them or thrcatens their person or proper
ty, or when their native state draws them
into its military service, that fact of this
chango of allegianco is made known.
They reside permanently from the Uni
ted States, they contributo nothing to
their revenues; they avoid the claims of
its citizenship, and they oniy mako them
selves known by asking for our protection.
I have directed the dtplomatis and consu
lar officers of tho United States to scru
tinize carefully all such claims of protec
tion. The citizen of the United States,
whether native or adopted, who dischar
ges his duty to his country, is entitled to
complete protection and should have a
voice in tho direction of its affairs. But
I shall uot consent to impair a sacred
right by conferring it upon fictitious or
fraudulent claimants.
EMIGRANT PROTECTION.
On the accession of the present Ad
ministration, it was found that tho Min
ister for North Germany had made pro
position for negotiations of a convention
lor tho protection of emigrant passengers,
to which no response had been give. It
was concluded that to be effectual, all the
maritime powers engaged in trade, should
join in such a measure. Invitations have
been extended to the Cabinets of London,
Paris, Berlin, Brussels, the Hague, Co
penhagen, Florcnco and Stockholm, to
empower their representatives at Wash
ington to simultaneously enter into nego
tiations or conclude with the United
States, conventions identical in form, as to
tho construction of tho parts of vessels to
be devoted to tho use of emigrant paten
ters: as to the quality and quantity of
food ; as to medical treatment of the sick
during the voyage ; in order to secure
ventilation; to promote health; to prevent
interruptioa and to protect families and
providing for the establishment of tribu
nals in the several countries for enforcing
such regulations by summary, process.
MANUFACTURES.
Your attention is respectfully called to
the law regarding tariff on Prussian hemp,
and to the question whether to fix the
charges on Prussian hemp higher than
they are fixed updn Manilla, is not a vio
lation of our treaty with Prussia, placing
her products upon the same footing with
those of the most favored nations. Oor
manufactures are increasing with wonder
ful rapidity under the encouragement
which it now receives, and with improve
ments in machinery already effected, and
thoy are still increasing, thus causing
machinery to take tho place of skilled la
bor to a large extent. Our imports of
many articles must fall off largely within
a few years, Fortunately too many man
ufactures are not confided to a few local
ities, as formerly, and it is to be hoped
that they will become more and moro dif.
fused, making the interest in them equal
in all sections. They give employment
to hundreds and thousands of people at
home, and retain with us means which
otherwise would be shipped abroad. The
extensions of railroad in Europe and the
East is bringing into competition with
our agricultural produce those of other
countries. Self-interest, if not self-pres-ervationj
therefore, declares in favor of
caution against disturbing any industrial
interests of the country. It teaches us al-

ASIAN AUD SOUTH AMERICAN It EL A
; ' TIONS. ' ' '
Our neighbors south of the Unitecf
States and China acd Japan, should re
ceive special attention. It will be ther
endeavor of the Adminiatr'ation to culti
vate such relations with all the nations ts
to bo entitled to their confidence and
them iotorested; as will establish better
commercial relations through the agency
of a more enlightened policy than that
heretofore tursued.
Toward China it is due to the capacity
and efforts of one of our owa distinguish
id citizens that the world is about , to
commence largely increased , relations
with tho populous and bttheite exclusive
nation. Arthe United States have been
the initiators of the policy, they should
be the most earnest in showing their good
faith and making it a success. In this
connection, I advice such legislation as
will forever preclude the enslavement of
the Chinese upoa our soil under the name
of coolies, tod to pravent American ves
sels from engaging ia the transportation
of coolies to any country, or tolerating
the svetem. I also recommed that tho
Mission to China be raised to one of the
first class. '
THE OBJECTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION
Ou my assuming the rcsponsibilties of
Chief Magistrate of the United States, it
was with tho conviction tbat'three things
were essential to its peace and prosperity,
and to the fullest development. First
among these is strict integrity in fulfilling
our obligations; second,' to secure protec-'
tion to the person and property of tho
citizen of our common country, wherever
he may chance to move, without refercn.ee)
to original nationality, religion, color or
politics, demanding cf him obedience to
tho laws and5 proper respect far" the
rights of ethers; third, the union of all
the States, with rights indisputable by
any but Consituticnal means. To secure
the first of these, Cocgrcss has taken two
essentia! steps in declaring by joint iesc"
lation that the public debt should be paid,
Erincipal and interest, in coin. Second,
y providing the mana for paying tho
principal. However, we could notsecuro
the object desired without the proper ad-'
ministration of laws for collection of reve
nues, and tho economical disbursement of
them. To this subject the administration
has most earnest!? addressed itself, with
results. I believe, Eatufactory to the coun
try. Thero has been no hesitation in
changing official in order to secure tha
efficient execution of the laws ; sometimes,
too, where in a mere party view the polit
ical results that were,, to-day, follow from
any hesitation in sustaining efficient ofa
cers against remonstrances wholly politU
r.rtmrtirht mnchntlA i '
It may be well to mentionhere that"
embarrassment may possibly arise from
leaving on tbe statute book fo called Ten
ure of ofBce acts, and to earnestly recom
mend their total repeal. It could not
havo been the intention of the framers of
the Constitution, when providing that ap
pointments made by the President should
receive the consent of the Senate, that the
latter should have the power to retain ia
offices persons displaced by federal ap
pointment against the will of the Presi
dent The law is inconsistent with a
faithful and effective administration of the
Government What faith can the Exec
utive put in officials forced upon him;
those, too, whom he has suspended for
reason ? How wouM such officials bo
likely to serve the Administration which
they know docs not trust them. For tho
second requisite to our growth and pros
perity, time and a firm but humane ad
ministration of existing laws, amended"
from time to time as they may prove inef
fectual, harsh, unnecessary, are probably
all that is required. The third cannot bo
obtained by special legislation, but must
bo regarded as fixed by the Constitution)
itself and gradually acquiesced jn by tho
forc9 of public opinion.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
From the foundation of the Govern
ment to the present, the management of
the original inhabitants of this continent
(the Indians) has been attended with con
tinuous robberies, murders and wars.
From my own experience when on tho
frontiers and in Indian countries, I do
not hold cither the legislation or the con-
duct ot tne wnues wno come nearest con-,
tact with the Indians blameless. The
deeds of the past, however, cannot be un
done, and the question must be met as wo
now find it. 1 have adopted a new polU
pv toward these wards of the nation.
They cannot be regarded in any other
light than' as wards. It has been attend
ed with fair results to far as tried, and
which, I hope, will be attended ultimate
ly with great success. The Society of
Friends is well known as having succeed
ed in'peaco with the Indians in the early
settlement of Pennsylvania, when their
white neighbors of ether sections wero
constantly embroiled. They are also
known for their opposition to all strife,
violence and war, and are generally noted
for their strict integrity and fair dealing.
These considerations induced me to give
tho management of a few reservations of
Indians to them, aud to throw the burden
of the section of agents urton the Society
itself. The result has proved jacst satis
factory. It will bo found more fully set
forth in the report ot the Conamisooer3
of Indian Affairs and of the Superintend
dents. For Indian Aentsnot on reserva
tions, officers of the fcrmy wero selected.
The seasons for this aro numerous. Ihe
Indian Agents are sjot hero or there ;
