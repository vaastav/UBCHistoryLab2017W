THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The annual message of the
President to the Congress is a
most voluminous document,
touching upon and discussing as
it does, the many varied interests
Mr. Roosevelt
of the country,
stands pat on his former utter
ances on the leading questions
prominent before the people.
He stiU insists that the recent
panic was not due to his talks,
but due solely to the light thrown
upon the dishonest practices of
some of the multi millionaires in
giving the water cure to stocks
and other securities within their
now
control, and the consequent feel
ing of dread engendered among
investors aud prospective inves
tors. It would probably be too
much to ask for a careful reading
of the message, but a study of
the salient points will well repay
those interested in good govern -
ment.
There is one point in the mes
sage, however, that is of a vital
interest to this community.
That is the recommendation fora
Federal inspection of grain en
tering into inter-state commerce.
Every evening tries to make fun
of this proposition and says, that
under such a system, it would be
impossible for a Delaware farmer
to sell his wheat or corn to a
Pennsylvanian without the inter
vention of a United States officer.
This remark plainly shows the
ignorance of the writer as to
present conditions. As every
farmer in Delaware knows, it is
impossible now for him to sell a
Pennsylvanian or for that matter,
to a Delawarean, if the latter be
a dealer in grain (and these lat
ter buy practically all the grain
that is sold in Delaware) without
the intervention of an inspector,
and that inspector an employee
of the purchaser. It stands to
reason that a seller will come
nearer getting a square deal from
a disinterested Federal official
than from the present system,
when, undeT certain conditions
as to marketsupply and demand,
it may be for the interest of the
purchaser to have <\ lower grad
ing than would ordinarily be the
case. As a rule -the inspectors
of grain are honest men but even
honest men are swayed and must
be swayed by the tone and tem
per of their employers. No mat
ter what else the present Con
gress may do, and there is plenty
of work mapped out for the mem
bers, it should adopt this recom
mendation of the President and
quickly put grain and such
other products of the farmer un
der the same kiud of inspection
and grading as is done for the
manufacturers of beef and other
animal products. The seal of the
U. S. inspector fixes the quality
and cons^ue&iiily-' the price of
beef and pork. Let it also fix the
quality of wheat, corn, oats, &c.D
SHOPPING BY MAIL
Everybody knows about the
catalogue houses and other big
establishments which advertise
to do a mail order business. The
theory upon which they proceed
is to pick out a few articles ,of
common consumption and sell
them at wholesale prices per
haps, or even less. If a popular
copyrighted book is published
they will buy them in large quan
tities and put them on the
market at their cost price, and
this serves tyo purposes;- it
. aids them in billing off the local
dealers by showing a great con
trast between the mail order
house and the local' dealer. It
also operates as an excellent ad
^vertising scheme. Seeing these
~ low prices upon articles which
the people know about, they
, readily conclude that the com
pany advertising, these things so
wonderfully low are selling
everything on a correspoudingl-y
low basis. . The next deceit is the
quality of the goods. They ad
vertise apparently the same art
that your retailer does, at a lower
_pr ice and soon they make the
non-expert believe that ha bet
ter buy all his goods of them.
He proceeds to do so and actually
pays more iu the,-end than lie
would pay his local d ittfeFiu reg
ular prices.
These houses mate up much
more on the goods which you do
not understand than they lose
on the goods you do understand,
and by this process of bood-wink
_ ing, retain your trade, teaV down
the local.dealer in the small towns
a
decrease the value of town and
adjacent country property, and
you are doing it yourself. You
are saving a few cents on a bar
rel of salt and reducing the price
of your farm by the act.
Suppose you would only buy
die bargains—just the goods
that yot\ understand and know to
be bargains. How long do you
suppose the mail order house
would do business? Not very
!oug. Theyiey upon the bait
which they set and it works in a
-large number of cases to perfec
tion. Barnum said that the
American people delighted in be
iug humbugged, that his show
was i hegreatest humbug on earth
and that was the reason he got
such large crowds. We are
always
and
because some one advertises one
article for less than they are
worth, that is no inference that
he sells other articles for less than
they are worth. In fact, the op
posite inference is true, namely,
if he sells one thing for less than
it is worth, he must sell the next
for that much more than it
is worth to make up the loss on
the first article, otherwise he
would soon go bankrupt and out
of business. By dealing with
these great commercial centers
we are centralizing a vast
amuontof tradeat the expense of
other cities and towus through
out this beautiful country of ours.
How- would we like it if there
were no towns except the ones
where the mail order houses do
business? How would it effect
the value of our property? All
of us like to live near thriving
towns and yet in many cases the
people adjoining the towns whose
financial standing depends upon
the existence of the town, and
whose land values are nearly
twice as great because of its near
ness to town are sending to
Chicago for goods that are kept
right here, and what is worse,
they are getting beaten on every
article bought, let alone the dam
age done to the local dealer who
is usually onei of the principal
factors in keeping up the town.
There is no logic, in the situa
tion Your local dealers can
furnish you your articles for one
year as cheap or cheaper than
you can get them in Chicago, be
sides if you happen to get some
thing you can't use, you can eas
ily adjust it with your local deal
er. We insist that the quality of
the goods bought at home is in
variabl y better than those bought
in Chicago. You are all opposed
to trusts, why help in building
them up? That is just what you
are doing by sending to Chicago
for your goods. As we give the
trusts our financial or moral
support, we are creating masters
for ourselves. Are we so mer
ci nary that for the purpose of
saving a few cents, we are will
ing to hazard the future of our
children.
Let's have the patriotism and
I h.e stamina to say that the inter
est of our^liome town shall first
be protected, and when we have
done our whole duty by our lo
cal interests we will find that we
are worth more in dollars and
cents than we are sending to
Chicago for our supplies, and we
will have retarded the progress
of the trusts just that much.
a
looking for bargains
that is all right. But

To
"A PANIC — —
"We read in the newspapers
about a panic now grasping the
country, the "Roosevelt panic"
some Democratic papers call it,
and compare it with the Cleve
land panic from '93 to '96. Well,
we are not afraid to talk out about
two periods, politics or no poli
tics. They are always enough
fuir and square people in -the
land to pronounce honest judg
ment on every man.
"Wherq is this Roosevelt panic
raging that we read about? This
vyiter sold his wheat last Satur
day for 99 cents a bushel, which
however was a poor sale, the
panic talk having got in a whack
on our wheat pile, and the wheat
crop of 1907 was a good one here
in the east. Corn if in order will
sell for 60 cents at home, oats
have been as high as 50 cents.
White potatoes are quoted at 65
to 70 cents. This writer sold his
veal calves through the year
at average of $13 or a little
better and they were very
ordinary calves at that Turkeys
will briug 20 cents a pound, and
our dresséd du cks from the farm
sold in Philadelphia last week for
17 ceuts a, pound. How is that
for a pamc? And who wiil lift his
voice against us if we cry, give
us more panics just like it.
"Well, we were trying to do a
little business during that never 1
to be forgotten period from '93 to
'95. We rose early in the morn
ing and lay down late at night,
and about all we got out of it
was thewear and tear «of living.
We sold our tfheat as low as
of
of
at
-, '-V
57 cents ft bushel, and corn for
85 cents. We sold a ve**y good
crop of bright oats one year for
20 cents a bushel. A good calf
was worth $6, a nicely fatted
turkey 10 or 11 cents a pound, a
fat duck 8 cents. Oh, they were
delightful days for the salaried
man, and we shook him right and
shook him left about it, and still
he cried the louder, "Grover,
Grover, four years more of
Grover." Well we got the four
years, those of us who survived
them. In that day the song was
first sung in the land "down the
street to the soup house" and
"over the hills to the poor house"
and still the capitalist and sala
ried men picked the cheep turkey
out of their teeth and shouted
"no fifty cent dollars for us."
"Undoubtedly four or six
weeks ago in the present year,
this country looked in the wide
gaping mouth of as ugly looking
a panic as ever opened its jaws to
devour the business of a land.
Everything seemed to be ad
justed to it. The country banks
had their surplus money in the
city banks,and the city banks had
it out in every form of specula
tion. When like a clap of thun
der in a clear sky, the people sud
denly arose and rushed to the
banks for their deposits. No
hurrying and scurrying among
the banks could have withstood
this assault, and the country
seemed doomed to fall like a tree
broken down by its fruit. Then
it was that Roosevelt rushed to the
scene to put the fire out. No red
tape restrained him from bring
ing the great wealth and credit
of his government to stay the
conflagration, and it stopped.
The people saw and believed that
the man could and would protect
them, and confidence regained
its feet. Yes he offered to issue
bonds, but bonds to save the
people, and unlike the Cleveland"
bonds that were issued to save
the Government
"Bryan would doubtless have
done the same. The two men
are not wide apart, waiving party
lines. But narrow is the man
whatever his politics, who does
not thank Theodore Roosevelt to
day for the prospect of a winter
of ease and abundance, if our
Blessed Lord and Father so per
mits. And whenever the shadow
of a panic spreads otiits ghastly
form over this land, Roosevelt if
President may be depended on to
do to it what he did to the panic
of 1907 .''—Delaware State Netcs.

WILD GAME AT BEHOBOTH
Lkw es, Del.. December 5th.—Residents
of Reboboth report that there has not
been as much wild game in Reboboth
bay and its, tributaries for \ ears as is at
present there this season, and coin-e
quently the chance for sport is the best
for tome time. Frank L. Chase, freight
agent at Reboboth, and for years a regu
lar visitor to the bay for wild game, is
authority for the statement that it is
there in abundance this Beason.
Quite a number of visiting sportsmen
are there already, and doubtless the news
of so much chance for sport wiil soon
spread and Reboboth will be overrun
with the sportsmen who have enjoyed
shooting ducks aud geese from the blinds
at various places in the bay. The law
lies stepped the shooting of game from
steam launches, which was getting to he
such a fad that it was a menace to the
sport.
