NewTore, Dec. 9. It is not an ex
aggeration to say tlmt the entire civilized
world has been startled by the introduc
tion of Greater America into the arena of
European politics, as indicated by the
, l|lperlall8t ic policy of the United States
in the matter of colonial absorption and

British Secretary of State Chamberlain
in a speech yesterday discussed the

he said, depended entirely upon the poB
sibilitv of reaching an understanding
with France, "a tiling which is nnpos

policy of exasperation."
With regard to the relations between
Great Britain and Russia in connection
with the Far East, he said that, while
hitherto the endeavors to reach an agree -1

ment with Russia was certain, unless
serious complications were encountered,
, "lam more sanguine of arriving at a
settlement," said Mr. Chamberlain, "be

No more critical period in history
could have been selected for our advent
into the Old World as a factor among the
Great Powers than the present. All the
great nations are equipped for war; the
issues between some of them are grow ing
daily more acute and if the signs of the
times may be taken as foreshadowing
coming events, even the skilled chplo
macy of Lord Salisbury and other Euro
pean statesmen will not prevent the fir
mg of a spark that may set all hurope
ablaze. Such a result would prove an
international calamity, and frenzied
jingoes would be the only ones that
would not regard as the world s bene
factors the man or men who can prevent
tlie outbreak of hostilities, the outcome
of which no one can foretell.
I P
i There is intense irritation in England
over McKinley's plain announcement
that the United States must build and
control tlie Nicaraguan Canal across tlie
South American Continent, in the con
trol of which Britain wants to share.
All tlie honeyed phrases which can be
invented cannot Hide Jie fact that in
1882 both Blaine and Freliiigliuysen for
mally announced to tlie British that the
American Government regarded tlie
Clayton-Bulwer treaty as null and ex
tinct. Efforts are being made to repress
any expression of passion or temper lest
the Anglo-American movement may be
endangered and Britain may lose Amer
ica as an alley in fighting Russia in Asia,
but it is not altogether a success.
Tlie Dreyfus scandal continues to agi
tate Paris, and tlie Court of Cassation
lias ordered a stay in tlie trial of Colonel
Picquart, the friend of the exile. Til's
appears on its face to be a set back to
the enemies of Dreyfus, but, as tlie mys
terious methods of French courts are
past finding out, it may practically mean
nothing.
*
First of special importance, of course,
in connection with out future develop
ment as one of the great consulting na
tions of the earth, is the policy of our
probable ally—Great Britain whose
present and prospective complications
we may have to reckon with as our own.
So many episodes have occurred during
the week, in which England is vitally
concerned, ns to be almost bewildering.
Probably tlie most, momentous was tlie
incident at tlie Britisli Chamber of Com
merce dinner in Paris, during which the
English Ambassador to France, Lord
Frederick Monson, publicly insulted the
French Government and warned it not
to attempt to interfere witli England's
policy in Africa. The slap in tlie face
was all the more direct for its deliberate
ness, Lord Monson having read his
speech from manuscript which had evi
dently had the approval of the British
Cabinet. Already it lias roused intense
feeling in Franco and tlie cable tells us
that the French Ambassador at London
will ask Lord Salisbury for an explana
tion or an apology—which lie probably
won't get. Tlius the crisis advances!
*
* *
In making war on France, if such
should result from the present strained
relations, England may have to reckon
not only with Russia,but with tlie Triple
Alliance—Austria-Hungary, Italy and
Germany. Strange as it would be for
Germany, the hated enemy of France, to
be found on the tide of the French Re
E ublic yet even more remarkable tilings
ave occurred in European politics.
Now in the event of such a vast combi
nation of forces arrayed against her, and
with serious results disturbing her In
dian Empire, who has England to look
#
to for allies? Plainly her only
' the United States, and, remotely though
it may be, the Japanese Kingdom. In
a such of this magnitude, with modern
methods of fighting employed, the great
est conflict the world has ever seen
would be witnessed.

Here again we see that England saved
11 s from annihilation! How often must
we be told this in order to' make 11 s
realize its truth? And yet there are
some people who actually believe we
saved ourselves and can do it again if
necessary!
* *
As to tlie present attitude of Europe
towards us, as the result of our Colonial
expansion policy, Mr. Stead remarks
with truth and force:
"You may argue, protest and rage as
you please, the Old World has made up
its mind on the subject, and nothing
that can be said or done in the United
States will alter its judgment. Tho
American Government has come out of
its ring fence. It lias thrown its hat'into
the arena of the world. It is launched on
a career of conquest, which will be all
the more predatory because it is masked
by humanitarianism.
*
' The answer to the question what
does tlie Old World think of the New
World lias never been made with greater
emphasis than in tlie Eternal City. The
oldest old world regards the newest new
with feelings of atiger, disgust and alarm
almost too great for words. The senti
ment of indignation differs in intensity.
But it is universal.
"There is no sympathy for tlie United
States either among whites or blacks—in
fact, dislike of the American seizure of
the Philippines and a conviction that
tlie humane enthusiasm which made tlie
war possible was a mere mask of cant
assuag'd in order to facilitate conquest
are almost the only sentiments shared in
common by tlie rival camps of theQuiri
nal and of tlie Yaticau.
* * *
" 'It is all very well,' they say in
effect, 'to dissemble your love, but why
did you kick me downstairs. It was ail
very well to proclaim your disinterested
ness, but wliy should you seize tlie
Philippines.'"'
*
# *
Tlius it will be seen that Greater
America's entrance, or
trance into tlie arena o
already proven to be an agitator of no
small importance. Whether we shall
eventually get value received for our im
perialistic policy is a problem to be
solved in the future.

and the United States. The French Am
bassador recently applied to the Chinese
Foreign Office for a reversion of the deci

to grant an extension of the French
settlement at Shanghai by conceding Po
Tung, a suburb.
The Foreign Office, however, instead
of reversing the Viceroy's decision, con
firmed it.
Conger, the American Minister, co-op
erated with tho British and Japanese
Ambassadors in urging that the conces
sion be not granted, Po Tung being
chiefly occupied by American and Brit
ish wharves and warehouses.
The French are making this an oppor
tunity to seize the arsenal and pagoda,
which has a good anchorage near Foo
chow, wbich they have iong hankered
after.
The presence of French war ships at
Nankin is meant to coerce the Viceroy,
who remains firm in refusing the coveted
concessions. British and Japanese war
ships have also gone to Nankin to assist
in stiffening the Viceroy's resistance.

The last of this ilk arrested in this city e

And yet, after all, are we not reckon

fact that the Peace Treaty at Paris has
been practically adopted by the Ameri
can and Spanish Commissioners, but it
has yet to run the gauntlet of the United
States Senate.
There is already decided opposition
manifested to its ratification and some
talk of amending it (which may be legal
ly done) by striking out tho $ 20 , 000,000
appropriation. Again the House of Rep
resentatives may refuse to vote the nec
essary appropriation to make the finan

Some of the members claim that the
President lias exceeded his authority in
offering to pay $20,000,000 to Spain, and
some warm discussion is promised in
both Houses before the subject is finally

Georgetown, Del., Dec. 9.—The new
constitution makes and requires that ajl
county offices in the State shall be
salaried, and that the General Assembly
shall fix the annual pay cf such officer,
and the fees heretofore paid such officers
which constituted their salary shall be
paid over to the State or county.

While the amount of salary to be fixed
for each one of the county officers will
be an absorbing topic of conversation
among the people when the matter
comes up for consideration, and while
we are in favor of fairly liberal salaries
which will command the services of men
competent and qulified for the position,
we are in favor of and shall advocate,
that the duties of every one of the county
officers shall be clearly and distinctly de
fined-as far as the English language!

shall, and what shall'not be their duties,
For years past the people have been
hoodwinked, deceived, cheated and de

openly that the people were being de

purposes and party aggrandizement, the

The Republican party of Delaware
labors under very great disadvantage at
this time, in that all the political laws
are contained in and enveloped by the
laws pertaining to the assessment and
collection of taxes and the duties of the
Levy Court. As Republican lawyers
have not heretofore practiced this branch
itsfir iMjaas
For it must be remembered that the
constitution does not define this duty,
and, for more than a hundred years, the
custom has prevailed of doing things in
thoroughly conversant with Lew Court
methods, to know the exact operations
and workings of that bodv, and to clear
define ju^t what are the'duties of the I
V y Court, of the Clerk of the Peace
of every other county officer.
Allegations have been made of Itepub
lican h,competency in Levy Court ex
peuditures in Sussex county^ but it must
remembered that t/ie secretary of that
body is the Clerk of the Peace, and that
some of liis duties are defined bylaw;
that the indebtedness of Sussex is prob
ably about $75,000, and that the county
orders are hawked about at a heavy dis
count and that for the purpose of paying
taxes they are discounted by those that
hold them, at from ten to'twenty per
cent., that the people are suffering from
previous burden in the shape of taxes.
That it is the sworn duty of the Clerk
the Peace to guard jealously the inter
st of the taxpayers and to perform their
duty to the interest of the taxpayers.
Yet in spite of this, bills were brought
and allowed as follows:

The plan is simple.
Fill out tlie coupon at the head of this
column and send it to Tub Sun. We pub
lish the number of votes received by each

The Sun also makes this offer: The
winner in this contest has the privilege
of naming any charity in the State to be
the recipient of one hundred dollars,
which will be paid to the said charity by
The Sun.
The contest will continue until the
first ballot is taken in the Legislature.
There is no law or requirement which
makes it necessary for you to sign your
name to your ballot, though we would
rattier you would. They will be coiinted
just the same, however, if you do not
wish your opinions known.
Send in your ballot and help win that
$103 for some deserving charity.
