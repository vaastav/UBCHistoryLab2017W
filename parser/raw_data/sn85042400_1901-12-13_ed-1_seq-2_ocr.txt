Senator Mitchell haa among other
bill Introduced In congress one t ex
clude Ftllrlno frvvm the rntted State.
Just what haa prompted the senator
to father this measure Is not at pres
ent clear. There has been no demand
upon the part of the people of Ore-ron
for such a measure, and there certain
ly can b no apprehension of any geat
number of Filipln coming to this
country-
Aside from the fact that we are not
In any manner threatened hy an inva- j
slon of cheap labor from the Philip
pines there is another and higher rea
son hy such legislation is ill-advised j
We have by our own act auvd
proprietorship of the rhillpplne Isl
nnd. We have for th- rast three
years been endeavoring persuade
the Intelligent Fi ll In that our pres
ence In the islands were for the pur
pose of giving to them a measure ,.f
liberty of which they have long dream
ed, while our army has been endeav
oring to subjugate the half-civlliied
portion of the people of the Islands
and compel them to accept the sover
eignty of the I'niled States
It is repugnant to the American
spirit of justice and fairness to make
these peopl subjuct to our law and
at the aame time say to them they are
debarred from entering the confines
of the United States. It is a pr .posi
tion which we feel will not meet with
the approval of congress. It Is exclu
sion (tone to seed, and has none of the
elements behind It which have caused
the demand for restrictive laws against
the flood of Chinese which threatened
the welfare of thousands of our labor
ing people-

Citizens Union candidate for Mayor I
and the Republican candidate f-r
Treasurer were both men of integrity, j
business ability and associated wi.h j
the growth and ley. l -i ment of the j
city. Koth had b-eti honoied i.y the
citizens of Astoria and by no ;u t of j
their own had they forfeit-d the i",n
fidence bestoweJ in them. They lad
administered the affair of ih-lr re
pective office with atifaetion to
their constituents and to the best in
terest of :h? city. Rut they had each
served two consecutive terms Mid their
personal popularity could no iv-r-crme
the prejudice of the American
voter against third terms To this
fact may r? attributed In a gra. de
gree the defeat of those to o g-n' ! incn.

Since the agitation on the part of the
