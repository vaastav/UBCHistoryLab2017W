How Shall we Sleep!
[From Harper's Weekly.]

Bnpply of frsh air. From cur own o!cr
ation we bare no hesitation in wiying thar

Mn.t ofihera elfPD in rooms that re b"th 1
toe amall and nhut up too closely. A gallon
of frfh ir etery minute, lot it lie remni
berd, is the requisite for earn person. This
certainly cannot be furninheil to any one in
closed room ol ten fret cqnaro. end yet
this is very common limit of alacpinp; oc
commodatient, with no inlets for fresh air
except the crevices. The cae ix worro than
it is with epartmanta for the day, for in
tnem the doers are opened frequently, and
nd thus some considerable change is t fleet
ed in the air.
Very often tho slorping acfomtnodahons
re even mure limited than we have men
tioned, especially in the case of clii'drcn.
Several ol them put into ( veti a (toon sizcu
apartment do not have air enough if it be
closed, and surely not whon thoy are put
into a small one, as thoy ofinn are.
It is quite important that with ventilation
tWa should be a proper degree of warmth,
nd bone lit is much easisr to secure thorough
ventilation in sleeping apartmunts when the
whole house is warmed from a furnace than
when it is not. And here we would sny that
it U ft fle notion that no air is good except
that whioh is introduced directly from with
out. That which comes trom the open pna
faces ol the hou' is as good as that which
comes tbrouBU open wiuduws. The airthnt
tomes froui the pipes ol'a fiirnaoo is ns
fresh, that is at pure, ns fully charped with
oxygen, as cold air is. Ili'sting it does not
injure it. If tho attempt Li mode to secure
ventilation alone by letting down the top of
ft window, there is good d .n.-pr tl.itt cold
will be taken, especially if the room bo
small. This had bi Iter be only one of the
moans of ventilation, and then there n'"od
not be so wide an opening as to have this
liability.
Niput is tho timo for sleep, as day is the
time for woik. This is naturu'a indication.
nd harm always comes from not following
it. Sloan in the mornina is not an rclrnsh
ing as that whioh is had in tho night, when
wo have nature's favoring oircumHtnnccs,
the darkness and stillness. When wo turn
night into day, either with plcnsuro or la
bor, we do violence to nature, and, of course,
inflict more or lots injury on our physical
syntems. Many a clergyman is tempted to
sit up luto at night in preparing his sermons,
tiartlv fruit the quietness of tho hour, and
partly from tho necessity of securing the
preparation in timo. Hut cvory time that
lie does this there is an impairment of the
health, and particularly if it bo donn Satur
day niiiht, beeauMe tho injury Mr enhanced
bv tha labors of the following dav.
Sleep may he imperfect. It may be bro
ken by impression, made apon the Nensoe,
er bv menial operation. Ilia more ono
dreams the more impmfuot is the tlticp, for
mind and bruin are in action in dreaming,
nd they do not have entire rest. There la
ditlorencn in dreams as well ns in wide
awake thinking in tho amount of exrtion
Sometimes drcutijlng amounts to real men
tal labor, and so impairs greutly tho res
which siren is duicenod " -'ive.
i . Of courso the less perfect the sleep the
longer isthu time which it ought to' occupy.
It is mutter of economy, thon, to those
i with whom time is of valoo, to have tho
' alceo as norfect as possible.
,i Ilow, then, oan sleep life uiwlo perfect?
J bore are various eu'cuniHtanccs to be ro
carded in cfTcoliug this.
When we sleep wo shoulj Klcep. W
should make abusinn so' it. Then' should
be no mingling of the, wukeful and the
sleeping oondition. We should dismiss tho
thoughts and business of the day. We
should havn a habit of doing this. Thsre
is muuh in this point. Tho thing is quite
Within our control, and a liat'it ot passing
readily from the wakctal state into sound
eleen ran bo formed by a proper attention
to the circumstances that will favor it.
Regularity is important hero. There
should be a rerular lime for retiring, and
also for risiiif. If this bo not doiio, there
will not only bo much time often waMed
getine to hlep, but tho aleep will bo apt t
be imperfect. We do not moan that one
should retire preci.wly at tho satno ininiil
evurv nislit this would bo mukinir one
slave to time, and tho very exactness would
impair the s ceo.
Much nmy be done by shcor will. W
can will toouliudnwn inontnl action, an
dismiss trains of thought. If we enn not
do thia directly we can indirectly. W a ca
supplant thoughts which wuld burden th
mind, .and thus pass mind and bruin int
the sleeping state in a worried condition, I
indulging in thouuMs ot diverse an
lighter character, lotting usgcnlly slip int
our rest for the night. Ilow very common
ly the contrary courso is puruedl 1 It
business man goes to bed thinking of some
plan for making money, nr for solving some
perplexity ; the proiesbintmi man is tm
with some tram ot thought oonuected wit
his daily employment, and tho student
worrying bis mind up tu tho last of h
. wakeful moments with some portiou of to
morrow lessons.
Rut besides all this, and above all this,
the arrangements of the day have a decided
influence upon the charauter of our sleep.
That sloep maybe good the business of the
day should be done altogether in the day,
nd the evening should be tho lime for re
laxation and diversion. In this way there
will be proper preparation for undisturb
ed, psrfect sleep. All mental employment
in the evening should bo gentle and amus
ing. It is no time for real work. All the
study that Is donn in the evening, flspnaiitlly
by the young, does harm tn both body and
. -mind, and ono way in which it does this
by impairing the sleep.
The encroachments which fashion msles
tjpon nature'a time for sloep are large
source of disease in its votaries. Tho Ian-
mot of tbe nexf day tells what theuoisnpent
' hour have done, and thia often repeated,
.Ukiug something each liiiioftom theneided
repair and reatoration, lessens decidedly the
general vigor, and thus prepares for actual
- disease. In strong con rust with thh is
legitimate use in ibe evening of the pleas-
tire ot society which ma have indicated.,
r,Wben will the truly rational and conscivn
vtieus resist the dictatrl of fashion and
" their gnests of theouoessity of turning night
intdsyT
In conclusion, we say, sleep enough
sleep in tbe light place sleep at the right
" time sleep well. Some eeern to grudge
" the tin given to sleep if it were
J' time. J?ut the hour of deep should
h'.- welcomed as well as the hoar of waking,
the time fer the reat should bo arranged
- for u torapulously as the time for action.

[From the New York Tribune.]
city
The Report of the Secretary of -nry,
given elxcwhere i full, is eminently
judicotis, and enntarns suggestions wel cal
culated to reduce the national finances to or
der, and ploefthe busines of the communi
ty upon a solid bssis. He declares the na
tional debt too nnything but blessing,
but while sati-fird thst it should be paid by
the feneration which created it, does not
aeo the way ' to continue its liquidation by
aurplus income faster thno six or seven .mil
lion! per Hionth prior to June, 1 868. He
is of opinion that tho honor of the Govern
ment requires an early withdrawal of tho
lecal-tender notes, leaving the National
Hank toMiimlv the currency of tie coun
try, lie antes the system of redemption by
by the banks at the Atlantic cities or at ono
New York. He acknowledges tho ti-
nanciul wants of the South so far as curren
cy is concerned, but is of opinion that their
needs should be supplied by curtniling tho
issues of the Northern banks. lie advo
rates a reduction of tho currency, and such
a rcvicion of the tariff as will give new vigor
r nrodnctive industry throughout the
ITninn. - Hn urirps the issue of bonds at 4i
nr fl ner cent interest, navable principal in
Kurope, to be exchanged for United States
bonds now held in Kurnno, as well as to
supply tho future demand for Federal stocks
in Kurnpe. Upon the question of contrac
tion of tho currency his language is very
clear; indeed, without contraction he is con
fident that wide spread disaster mni ne ex
perienced. In regard to resumption ne is
I opinion that it can take place ry Jury,
80S, and may be brought about earlier.
Tho estimates oP the Treasury for the
ast throe quarters of the fiscal ycarto June
JO.
1S67, are as follows
Receipts
Expeuses
..$31 fi 500.000
... 237,109,143

nd for the year ending June 30, 18C3:
Receipts $435000.000
Kxponsof 350,247,041
Surplus $85,752,358
Tho docrcaso in the the publio debt from
tlvo highei-t point is stated by the Secretary
as follows:
Debt August, 18(5 $2.7.')7,RO3,0S6
Debt Oct. 31. ItJOG 2,551,424 121
Decrease $200,879,505
The Socrotary has small comfort for free
traders, and says:
'The long hoped-for period whon there
shall bo no local obstructions to a free ex-
hnngo of commodities between the United
States ami other countries is still fur in
future. Duties upon imports aro not only
ncocssarv for revenue, but also for the pro
lection of those home interests upon which
heavy internal taxes are to be assessed.
In presenting bis views, ho
."Does not mean (0 assert that the adop
tion of all these measures (although be
gards eaoh as important) is absolutely
oossarv to return to specie payments,
that other remedies may not bo adopted
Congress to rescue the country from
financial troubles. He presents,
he considers it to be his duty to do, his
views, and asks that they may receive rare
fill consideration, and bo adopted if they
commend themselves to tho wimlom ol Uon
grcss. and relucted if measures bettor
ciliated to secure the desired end can
devised. Tho most sanguine and hopeful
must perceive that tho business of tho coun
try cannot for a much longer time be
upon the present high level with safety..
J ho snecu stive interest, lurge and power
ful in itself, is receiving daily now accessions
of strength y the increase of individual
credits: and when speculators and debtors
control the financial pnlioy of the couutry,
a tinunciul collapso is inevitable.'
The Report should command eirelul
study from every tax-payer or business men
Its recommendations may not be enfoiced
bv legislation, but thev are none the
valuable as tho opinion of one who, from
position and experience, possesses lnlorma
lion not accessible to the publio at large.
Tho Secretary has placed himself Ftiuare'
ly on the record in favor of contraction
specie payments, and really oA- wo
powm-i to ennblf him to fund the liort
and reunite in Juhl. 18G8.
It remains to be seen whether Congress
differs with him to the extent of repealing
exmtiiiff luwt, under which the secretary
will proceed toward resumption. Unless

Ono of tho editors of tho New Orleans
Picayune, writing concerning meteors give
the following story ot bis personul expou
ones with one of no ordinary character :
It, was in Ilia mouth ol iNovemhor, il we
are not mistaken, in '511, that wu weto rid
ing on tho West side, of tho Notices, be
tween Casa Rlatiea mid San Pstrico, with
Cuptain Munn, of I'orpus Cbristi. We had
bceu looking over the country, hunting a
sheep ranelie, got belated in the valley, and
were wending our way buck toward Casa
ltbincii, near w hich we were enewnped,
when all of ft sudden the prairies were
brilliantly lit up, and a meteor.which seemed
to us large as hogshead, went hissing,
howling, and rooting over our heads close
over our heads loo close, entirely, to tiff nd
us any pleasure quite tha contrary. Our
hori-e did not start, did not shy they
simply sipnt tint, and we down with I hem.
bliudod and bewildered, lo our right was
ft hill nr bluff, and over this the huge me
teor, looking like a locomotive all abluie,
camu suddenly ; wo had 11 sign or token
of its advanoe until it was upon us. It
might bavo heon a hundred feet over our
heads might have been two humliid it
did not seem to be twenty. It wie flying
r.esrly horiiontally, in W esterly direction.
and with incredible velocity. It was throw
ing off hissing sparks, which we could hear
above tbe howling' of the motenr. ; Stag
gered and blinded at first, our horses snort
ing with fright as they struggled to their
feet, on oponing our eyes the meteor was
aeen lighting up the rolls of tho prairies
miles away from us, and in a few momenta
nil was darkness and quiet again. Suoh is
but ft feeble aooount of what we saw on the
Muooesin November. 'S3, and we shall
never forget that display. The effect of the
shower of falling stars of 'S3 was bewilder
ing ; that of the meteor in 53 was absolu
tely stunning. Had it been ft mile or two
up over head we could give tuuoh better
description of the fiery monster; it came
close enough to blind, atagger, oonftue, as
tound and affright both berse and man, tod
that is all we can say about it. - , ,
It is little that we know about meteor'
one way or the other, although, we believe
that we have had oloaer view of one than
ordinarily fall to the lot of aian. j We have
otten thougbt that the one we saw on the
inueoea, iram me direction it was taking,
must haye struck tbe earth somewhere thie
side ot me uio uiande, ir it did not burn
itself out during its fierce transit, Had it

pive, and undecn) int. Front does not cruck. nor
ditmolve it. The only roofing material ever discovered
that will retii the action of the elements as loiifr as

new metallic roofs of all kindu, .Mastic Slate has nevi
been equalled, while it has proved an invaluable acqui
sition to the mechanic art as a preserver of metal
wood when imbedded in water or eatth. or exposed

from exnofture. and perfectly fire-proof, it is unequalled
as a paint for railroad and farm buildings, feuces
bridges, jrou or wooden.
