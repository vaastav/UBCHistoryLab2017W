PRESIDENT GHEYY, llio honored presi­
dent of the French republic, resigned
yesterday, and another political, iE not
revolutionary period, can be expected in
Franco.
THE associated press this morning'
brings the burden of another upheaval at
Bismarck—the killing of a panther some
fifty miles north of that place. Great ex
citement exists.
BROTHER HILTZ, after an all night's
round of excitement and noisy emotion
at Wahpeton, warns the good people of
Jamestown not to give a charity ball
not to go the primrose way to the ever­
lasting bonfire.
THE Gray Bros, will figure on boring
an artesian well for a water supply for
Devils Lake if the proposition to bond
the town for $12,000 carries. Water
works and a city hall are proposed to be
added to the advantages of that bustling
northern town.
THE Manitoba railroad company does
not intend to waste its enterprise on the
desert air, and will advertise its country
in Dakota and Montana in 3900 eastern
newspapers, contracts for which work are
already let, it is said. Local traffic is not
to be ignored and the best country on
the line sacrificed to the theoretical long
haul.
A FOSTER county farmer reports that
his herd of forty-seven head of cattle are
doing well in winter quarters on half
staw and half hay. He thinks that sweet
fodder corn is the most promising feed
for those who are not so situated as to
have plenty of natural meadows. Corn
fodder is going to be a staple crop with
Dakota fanners hereafter.
THE supreme court has made its de­
cision in the Kansas liquor license cases
where the state was claimed to be liable
for property of brewers rendered useless
by prohibition laws. The decision will
bring great satisfaction to the prohibi­
tionists, and is one of far reaching
consequences to a large interest in this
country. What practical results will
follow cannot of course be seen now.
THE Scientific American sets the fol­
lowing going:
Mr. Max Nicolaus, editor of the Ava
lanch, Sauk Center, Minn., sends us pho­
tographs of his printing office,in which he
has two job presses run by a wind-mill—
a fact that is exciting considerable atten
tion in that section. Wind is an impor­
tant agent in the running of political
newspapers, especially about election
time, but its employment in such prosaic
service as doing useful commercial print­
ing is, we believe, quite exceptional.
A moNSTER delegation of Minneapolis
citizens will start tomorrow night for
Washington to secure the republican
national convention. The roar of the
falls and the roar of the convention would
make a soothing bass harmony to the
ambitious Flour City rustlers. Maybe
an aggressive convention under the stim­
ulating influences of northwestern ozone
would so electrify the progressive modern
republicans, that they can elect that kind
of a president next fall. Anything to
change the Chicago luck should go.
WHILE the Western Union does prac­
tically about all the telegraphing of the
country, by reasons of its own immense
facilities and the purchase of all opposing
lines, it is gratifying to note that instead
of raising the tolls, as one would natural­
ly expect, a redaction in rates has been
made instead. On the first of December
seventy-five cents was made the maxi­
mum rate between all points east of
the Bocky mountaina Besides this the
maximum rate has been dropped from 75
to 60 cents between all offices in North­
ern Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Iowa, Missouri, Dakota, Nebraska and

his business career. He had a small

Canadians and half breeds. Afterwards
he built the steamboat Selkirk in part­

CALLS for mass convention of citizens
without regard to party affiliation, for
the purpose of electing delegates to the
Aberdeen convention Dec. 15, aro appear­
ing in all the newspapers. Saturday the
10th, is generally aamed in the calls.
Stutsman county should have a set of
delegates at Aberdeen, for she voted that
way. The time for the convention is
near at hand—the preliminary move to
statehood. Let the rustlers note.
JUDGE PLUMMER of Aberdeen joined
the Minneapolis delegation that left last
night for Washington on a special train
to get the republican convention. He
was escorted to the depot by the citizens
with the band, who affectionatelyfwished
their distinguished representative god
speed. The colonel was attired in his
usual picturesque costume, white vest,
and two overcoats being conspicuous. One
of the coats is an antiquated fur garment,
and the colonel remarkedjbefore starting,
'I wonder if my dogskin will be in style in
Washington."
EVERY little while a new G. A. R. post
is formed Dakota. Gen. Allen yester­
day granted a charter to the new G. A.
post at Larimore its name is Appomat­
tox, and its number 133. Twenty-five
thousand old soldiers in the territory aro
watching the movements of a democratic
congress, refusing to admit into the
union they kept together the land where
they have made their homes. Congress
meets today, and tomorrow the president
will read them his message. Whether it
will recommend that justice be done Da­
kota or not, remains to be
THE St. Paul Globe of last Saturday,
contained an entirely speculative state­
ment to the effect that Ex-Gov. Pierce
was intending to buy up the North Da­
kota Farmer, a journal that has numer­
ous readers in Dakota, and which is print­
ed in St. Paul, but dated at Jamestown.
Governor Pierce has not entertained
thought on the subject—in fact has too
much other business on hand to reflect
on matters agricultural, even if the Globe
would like to see him go to green fields
and pastures new. Some time the Globe
will get the genial Dakotan thoroughly
aroused by its persistent misrepresenta­
tion, and when it does, it is thought the
credit of that ambitious journal for being
posted, will get sadly wrecked.
THE Dakota Agricultural college and
experiment station, has issued a bulletin
giving the results of a careful inspection
of the growth of trees in the college
grounds. The report shows the action of
different varieties of trees under similar
conditions. The trees were planted
year ago. Placed in irregular groups
with a view to ultimate landscape effect,
they were mulched liberally with manure
and left without other cultivation until
last September. The wind made holes
at the bases of the trees in many instan­
ces, as much as six inches deep and three
inches in diameter. In September the
mulch was removed from the trees and
the ground about them was firmly
tamped, after which the mulch was re­
placed and the trees left for the winter.
The soil is the usual black loam of the
prairies with compact subsoil of yellow
clay containing a little sand. The early
part of the season was dry, about the
only favorable condition for the trees
was the mulching. There are twenty
three kinds of trees reported upon, and
many have made good progress, some
very rapid growth. The white birch, box
elder, mountain ash, European larch,
white elm, white pine and spruce are re­
commended as the most hardy and thrif­
ty. President McLouth of the college,
will mail to any applicant, a copy of the
bulletin.
THE official call for the Aberdeen con­
vention Dec. 15th, has been published,
and contains the signatures of residents
of seventy-three counties from all parts
of the territory. Stutsman county is en­
titled to twelve delegates. J. W. Good­
rich, N. Mueller, R. Rose, J. A. Dole, B.
W. Tenbrock and Andrew Blewettare
the signers for this county, whose names
selected from the number, are attached
to the call. The call says:
rl"he
petition has been circulated and
numerously signed by the voters in all
parts of the territory, and a deep interest
in the question of admission exists among
all classes of citizens of the territory, a
convention of the people of Dakota, en­

day the 15th day of December, 1887, at
12 o'clock, noon, of that day, for the pur­
pose of preparing a memorial to
praying for the passage of an
act authorizing the holding of a
tutional convention, and the submission
of that constitution to a vote of the peo
of Dakota for its acceptance or re
preparatory to the admission of
into the federal union, and to

Dakota for the presentation of such
memorial to congress, and to transact
such other business as may properly come
before the convention. In counties where
conventions have not already been called
for the purpose of selecting delegates to
this convention, it is recommended that
the people assemble in mass convention
at the county seats of their respective
counties on Saturday, the 10th day of
December, 1887, for such purpose.
COL. PLUJIMER and the Minneapolis
delegation have created a sensation in
Chicago, and seared the hotel keepers
and politicians of that city into intonse
anxiety. The colonel is the center of an
admiring throng and the life of tho par­
ty. He has several new anecdotes. The
old philosopher has quit, and persists in
wearing a rubber coat all the time to
show, perhaps, that he if dry. Yesterday
he dragged a reportor into a corner and
said:
"We have a first rate chance, and if the
gods are kind we'll get there. And why
not? Haven't we got one of the finest
belts of land up there that is in the coun­
try? Aren't our hotel accommodations
excellent, and are not our railroad facili­
ties as good as here in Chicago? See
this badge! (holding up a little white
silk pennant bearing the cheering in­
scription 'Minneapolis, 1888.') Well,
that's what we are after, and it's what
we are going to get. Now you get."
BY THE authority of the president's
message to congress yesterday the peo­
ple of the country have their serious at­
tention called to the many and impor­
tant grievances which burden business
from the unjust tariff laws. This is the
single and prevailing subject which he
discusses and for the crying reforms he
urges, the strongest and plainest lan­
guage is used to congress. A'brief state­
ment of tho contents of the message
shows it to be one of the shortest in the
history of the United States and a docu­
ment full of free trade arguments and
statistics. The condition of affairs, he
thinks, presages financial convulsion and
disaster. The present tariff laws are de­
nounced as vicious, illegal and inequit­
able, while the belief is expressed that
there is an organized combination of
American manufacturers, whose object it
is to maintain the advantage they now
hold. There are given statistics showing
the number of people benefitted by the
high tariff and a strong plea is entered
that farmers are very unjustly treated by
the present law, while competition is
strangled by combinations quite preva­
lent at this time. The president boldly
charges the deliberate violation of re­
form pledges to both political parties,
and begs of congress a reduction of the
tariff as a necessity and a duty. All
other questions ef public interest are
suppressed under this ruling issue, and
the hope that Dakotans had of a cor­
dial recommendation to congress to ad­
mit the territory goes up with the thous­
ands of other lesser topics. Cleveland
stands before the country as a practical
business man managing the practical de­
tails of a tremendous business, and the
case is tersely stated in his opening sen­
tences to congress:
You are confronted at the threshold of
your legislative duties with a condition
of national finances which imperatively
demands immediate and careful consid­
eration. The amount of money annual
ly exacted, through the operation of the
present laws, from the industries of the
people, largely exceeds the sum
captain dramatica
illy adds,
like the
govern-
sary to meet the expenses of the
ment.
The realization and the urgency of the
needed reforms in the tariff laws sound
the key note of the neit national cam­
paign. The message in full is given else­
where.
Advertising the Charity Ball.
Capt. Hiltz, general rustler for the Sal­
vation army now in camp at Wahpeton»
writes The Alert a strong criticism—
strong in literary and other points—on
the coming ball to be given by the com­
mittee of ladies to raise funds for the
poor. The captain entirely disapproves
of any such iniquity, and clearly inti­
mates that when charitable people have
nothing better to present to poor fallen
humanity than such ungodliness under
the robe of righteousness they had bet­
ter look out—or words to that effect. The
captain says, "When balls, .theaters, fairs
and festivals take the place in christian
hearts that ought to be kept sacred for
Jesus, our souls cry out, ,God have
mercy on backsliden Israel! for they who
once loved Thee and were satisfied with
Thee, have forsaken the fountain of liv­
ing waters and hewed them out cisterns
—broken cisterns—that can hold no wa­
ter—in Stutsman or Richland counties, it
at least." What a spectacle, the
will it ben
when
"to give an account of their stewardship
—yes, to hear God's voice saying: I never
knew you, ye workers in iniquity, and
then to have their eyes opened and see
hell's mouth wide open to receive them
and all their glory, their multitude and
their pomp, descend into it"

the
city of Jamestown was called late yester­
day afternoon, jury empannelled and the
case opened. This is an action brought
against the city for damages alleged to
have been sustained by the plaintiff from
falling into the ditch leading from the

thresh flax every fine day until the job
is ended.
The Spiritwood farm recently shipped
their flock of sheep and about twenty
hogs to St. Paul, where Mr. Francis, who
accompanied them, found ready sale.
The sheep have had no feed except
prairie grass andwere very fat.
