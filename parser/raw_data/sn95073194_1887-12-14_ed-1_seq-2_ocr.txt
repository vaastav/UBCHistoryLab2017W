Leondat Hamltne, a member of the
firm of Freez & Hamline, Chicago, has
not been seen for a week, when he left
for down town on a street car with a

to pay off workmen at the factory; it is
feared he has met with foul play.
H. E. Williamson, the agent at Crow

Members of delegations from Cin
cinnati and Omaha, who were in Wash
ington last week for the purpose of pre
senting their respective claims for the
next national republican convention,
called at the White House one day last
week and paid their respects to the pres
ident. The latest news among the well in
formed persons of St Petersburg assert
that the Russian government's inten-
tions are entirely pacific, and that pub
lic opinion is in favor of peace. Busman
movements on the frontier consist mere
ly of the dispatching quicker of a divis
ion of cavalry, not with an aggressive
idea, but for the protection of certain
localities.
Chicago obtained the national repub
lican convention on the third ballot,
with one vote to spare. Omaha had the
highest number of votes of any city ex
cept Chicago. The first ballot stood as
follows:
Chicago ' 11
Omaha .............................. XU
Cincinnati. .......................... "
Philadelphia 7
Minneapolis 6
St Louis 2
On the second ballot Chicago received
22 votes and on the third ballot 25, ob
taining the convention. Omaha dele
gates worked faithfully and made a
favorable impression. It is believed she
would have secured the prize this time
had it not been for the want of sufficient
hotel facilities, which was used through
out the contest as an effective argument
against her. In the four years to come,
strike for your hotel accommodations
and you will readily secure the next
national convention. After fixing the
time for the meeting of the convention
for Tuesday, June 19, 1888, the commit
tee adjourned.

effect that Goblet has been foiled by the
refusal of Rebot to remain in the cabinet
in which portfolios are given to two
members on the extreme left Ricard

A recent report from Berlin states
that the bourse was weak on account of
the unfavorable view taken by the Pester
Lloyd on the relations between Austria
and Russia. The Post says: The re
ports of the assembling of Russians on
the Galician frontier evoke apprehen
sions of a blow against Austria. Whether
that blow will admit of Germany's re
maining at peace is a question which
doubtless Russia has long since an
swered. Trns chief of the secret service of the
treasury department in his annual re
port says the counterfeiting now being
done is principally the work of Italians
who work in bands in different sections
of the country. The counterfeiting done
during the past year was insignificant

At an early hour the other morning at
Erie, Pa., two factions of young men got
into an altercation, the result of a feud
of long standing. Ffteen were engaged
in the affair. Henry Weller, and Frank
Knapp were fatally stabbed. Half a
dozen others were more or less severely
cut Eight arrests have been made.
James Wilson, alias Hanlan, and Judd
Walcott, notorious counterfeiters, were
arrested by federal officials the other
day at Wilkesbarre, Pa. Their counter
feiting establishment, from which they
were turning out bogus silver dollars,
was located in the cabin of an old boat I
at Mill Creek. '
J. B. McDonald was arrested the oth
er day at San Francisco for having in
his possession plates for engraving fac
similes of 5 Bank of England notes.
McDonald is said to be a brother of
George McDonald, who, with Austin

England out of a million dollars in 1883
by means of forged bank checks and
notes.
Peter Bennel, a wealthy and miserly
fanner 80 years old, residing at Newport,
Me., was found lying on the floor of his
house in a pool of blood. When restored
to consciousness it was learned that
robbers had beaten him and escaped
with"$32,000 in gold and bills. He was
in the habit of keeping large sums of
money around the house.
It looks as though the President, by
speaking for a faction in his own party,
instead of for the whole country, is de
termined that the next presidential cam
paign shall be fought on the issue of free
trade, as against the protection of Amer
ican industries. The opponents of that
doctrine are glad that the issue promis
es to be squarely made, at least, what
ever the result may be.
Acting Secretary Muldrow has lately
rendered a decision on a petition to set
aside patents issued to the Union Pacific
railway for about 200,000 acres, the land
lying contiguous to Denver, Col., alleged
to be outside of the grant. The acting
secretary sustains the petition and di
rects the commissioner of the general
land office to make a formal demand on
the railroad company for reconveyance.
President Sadi-Carnot at his recep
tion given the other evening to the re
tiring Rouvier cabinet, thanked them
for the patriotic devotion they had
shown during the recent crisis. He said
he would not form a cabinet until after
he had consulted with the presidents of
tho senate and chamber of deputies and
the chiefs of republican groups.
TnE other day U. S. Marshal Dyer, at
Salt Lake City, as receiver, seized the
Mormon church president's office ledgers
books, etc., leaving some minor books
which he required James Jack, church
custodian, to receipt for as the receiver's
agent. The church organ makes a loud
protest against this "outrage."
The secretary of the treasury has
made out and delivered his annual re
port to the President He frankly gives
his views on the tariff, and expresses
himself opposed to either the abolition
or reduction of internal revenue. He
really talks more like a statesman than
a partisan.
The young man in the employ of the
United States sub -treasury at New

crossing tho border, he will not be pros
ecuted. Word comes from Oshkosh, Wis., that
Gen. Bragg will positively accopt the
Mexican mission, if it is tendered. It is
no longer a secret that Charley Felkner,
who has charge of the petitions, is acting

Washington Letter.
From our regular correspondent.!
As a general rule tho sessions of the
U. S. senate are exceedingly dull, oxcept
to a careful and intelligent observer.
Tho debates are usually conducted in a
conversational manner, and very rarely,
indeed, is an effort mado at oratorical
display. A stranger looking down from
the gallery upon tho senate, dignified
and orderly, would have a very meagre
idea of tho immense brain power,
logic, and eloquence that could leap
forth from a score of lips tho very mo
ment that occasion required it, that
would arouse the nation from centre to
circumference, and on tho wings of cable
lightning carry his words as fast as
uttered to the court of overy nation on
the face of tho earth. There are several
cases on record where a speech of some
one of our senatorial giants has been
read at the next morning's breakfast
table in London, Paris, Berlin, and other
centres of national power. It is not the
American eye alone that watches the
U. S. senate. Whilo all are not great
debaters, they are wise legislators, and
he who has the power to clothe his
thoughts in speech on great inter
national issues, attracts the attention
of the world. I doubt, if you can find a
like assembly on the face of the earth,
that has the real brain tiower of the
U. S. senate.
The house of representatives is quite a
different ImhIv, and is curiously made
up. Here is a great mixture or nation t
alities. Has the thought ever occurred
to you? Well, we have here for mem
bers, the native born American, with his
eastern, or western or southern ideas
generally all good, but sometimes bad;
then there is in this congress, by birth,
the Prussian, the Englishman, the
Frenchman, the German, the Irishman,
the Mexican, the Scotchman, the Swede,
and I don't know how many other na
tions, and although American citizens
and loyal to the government and de
serving of all they receive, yet there is a
difference of temperament, to say the
least, and possibly early ideas that are
often hard to harmonize. I do not
wonder that the sessions of the houso
are a regular pandemonium, and that it
requires five official reporters to give an
intelligent account of its proceedings.
Last winter there was a stranger here
from New Hampshire. He took his seat
in the gallery and tried hard to keep run
of the proceedings, but soon became lie
wildered. Turning to the gentleman on
his right, he inquired what bill was up.
"They are discussing, sir, the army ap
propriation." He watched and waited,
and not being fully satisfied, made the
same inquiry of a gentleman on his left.
"They are making a fight on the river
and harbor bill," was the laconic and
positive response. Our New Hampshire
friend waited another hour in wonder
land, and finally left, but in passing out
inquired of the messenger who attended
the door, what bill was up? "An appro
priation, sir, for new war vessels." I
don't wonder that strangers get con
fused; some do to that extent that they
can hardly find their way home at the
close of a day's session.
Of the new senators fifteen are repub
lican and twelve democrats. On full
vote the republicans will have a majori
ty of two a narrow margin, but enough
to prevent pernicious legislation. R.

Why?
What are we, as business men and
citizens of Columbus, doing to im
prove the business interests of our city?
Are we going to sit still and see Lost
Creek, Platte Center, Duncan, Benton
and other towns get the farmer trade
away from us? Is it not a. fact that
there is more grain marketed at most of
these small points than there is here?
What is the canse? The Columbus
grain markets are all pooled, and always
have been. .Every buyer has the same
price; there is no competition. Corn is
bringing a better price at all stations
around us than here. Now we as citizens
must do something to get the farmers
into Columbus. Let us let them know
we are their friends and not their ene
mies. Let us be generous and help them
to build an elevator of their own, so that
no ring-pool can drive to other markets,
but will establish a market such, that
ever' farmer will feel, if I go to Colum
bus with my grain, I shall get Chicago
prices, less the freight. We are voting
thousands of dollars for bridges so
farmers can come in, but neglecting at
the same time to make them induce
ments to come here. In my opinion,
with but little effort, we can make this
the best market in Platte county on ac
count of our superior railroad facilities,
giving easy access to all markets, and
if we can do this we accomplish all. But
if we allow things to continue as they
are what will be the result? We will
complain of business being dull, and
wondering why the farmers don't come
in. We would all donate liberally to
any manufacturing enterprise, but what
does any manufacturing enterprise
amount to as compared to our farming
vicinity? Give this matter a careful
thought and let us hear from you. I for
one would say let us be liberal with the
farmers for it is to them we look for our
support L. W. Weaver.

Wintering Bees. '
BT MBS. J. X. HEATER.
This wintering problem occupies much
space in our bee periodicals and con
sumes much time in discussion at our
convention; yet no branch of the indus
try is more easily accomplished with a
Spxttsponttentt.
certainty of success. One thing for
every bee keeper to learn - and the soon
er ho learns it the better-is this: that
the honey beo is wholly unteachable,
and in order to become their master you
must first be their pupil. After careful
ly studying their habits, you may act
upon tho general principle of their na
tural instincts and thereby greatly as
sist them in many ways; but never has
a single bee been taught that it is un
kind to sting his friend, nor that it
would pay better to unite all their en
ergies in the storing of honey than the
rearing of brood during a late honey
flow. As early as the first week in" No
vember each colony should be comfort
ably provided for their long repose, to
give them ample opportunity for two or"
three cleansing flights before cold weath
er actually sets in. This is imperative
to their health and removes much of tho
imaginary risk of wintering. Neglect in
this matter is absolute cruelty. Think
of the thousands of individual bees in a
hive and each one suffering the pangs of
cold or starvation. Does any one sup
poso they do not have the sense of feel
ing, just try squeezing one and you will
respond to a very slight pressure in
such a way as will mako you careful
when handling the next one. Who
would think for a moment of giving a
horso only half a feed once a day to see
if ho could winter all his stock that way
the next winter, or leave their cattle in
tho pasture till spring to save the trouble
and expense of stabling? And yet just
as foolish and barbarous methods are
employed in experimenting with the
wintering of lwes. Many using single
wall hives leave theiu without furtlier
protection on the summer Btands, and
invarably those parties report having
losses in tho spring. And can we think
it strange? Tho moisture thrown off
from their bodies rises in a vapor till it
strikes the flat cover only an inch or so
above the cluster and is quickly con
verted into frost. This a continued, the
frost accumulating thicker and thicker
until some day the sun comes out
bright enough to melt it, and it drips
down on the cluster below; and that
night all will bo frozen in a solid mass
of ice and bees. Then others wishing to
depart from the laws of nature and
make for themselves a name by improv
ing on old nature, will extract every
ounce of honey from the comb and give
each colony just enough sugar syrup to
winter on. This is fed to tho bees in
such a way that it will all lo stored in
the new comb given them and sealed
over before cold weather. The object of
this being to remove all pollen or beo
bread from the hive,as this is an escential
food for the young lwes and without it
or some substitute for it, brood rearing
will not be commenced, and the master
imagines he has everything under his
own control.
Well this plan will work sometimes,
for a noted Michigan beo keeper- the
father of this original idea succeeded
in wintering 20 of his 200 colonies pre
pared in that way last year. Yet very
many are trying the same plan this win
ter with some variations. It is in this
as in many other matters; people have
an impression that success is measured
by the .amount of muscle expended,
when a little well-directed common
sense would answer a much better pur
pose. All systems of wintering have
their advocates, some bury the hives in
trenches under ground; others place
them in a cellar where an even tempera
ture is kept by artificial means; while
others leave them on the summer stands
in double wall hives which are packed
with chaff. All things considered, we
must prefer the latter to any other meth
od, for many reasons, the following are
only two of them. It saves an endless
amount of labor, for any sane person
would naturally take a second thought
before deciding that he wanted to carry
a lot of hives weighing from 50 to 100
pounds each into a cellar, and then set
them out once or twice during tho win
ter on pleesant days for the bees to have
a flight, and in tho spring arrange them
on the summer stand again. Another
objection is the expense of heating, sub
earth pipe for ventilation etc. When
preparing our bees for tho winter in the
chaff hive we place three or four corn
cobs on the top of the frames cross wise
of the hive, then spread a clean cloth
over the whole top and fill it with chaff
from four to six inches deep. The ob
ject of the corn cobs is to allow passage
ways under the cloth between the cobs
for tho cluster to move from one frame
to another when the honey they are
clustered over is consumed. This they
will do going bodily from one frame to
another, while if they were obliged to
break their cluster or hunt individually
for food, they would in many instances
starve with honey on lioth sides of them
but out of reach. Our chaff hive has a
roof sloping from the center to each
side, and as the moisture from the clus
ter passes up through the chaff it accu
mulates as frost on the cover, but when
the sun shines warm enough to melt it,
it follows the sloping roof and is carried
outside. The heat of the bees below and
the warmth of the sun above keeps the
chaff warm and dry all the time. All
hives should lie tilted forward sufficient
ly to allow drifting rain or melted snow
to run out at the entrance, which should
always be left partly open. It is needed
for ventilation; and many times during
the winter there are days when the bees
can fly and they are very apt to improve
all such opportunities. If by any chance
the entrance becomes clogged with dead
bees and allowed to remain so, a loss of
the whole colony is a sure result. For
this reason it is well to visit each hive oc
casionally on pleasant days and with a
bent wire rake out all the dead bees on
the bottom of the hive, but great care
should be used to make as little noise
and jarring as possible. In short, give

The Province of Education.
The legitimate object of all true
training, either in school or family, is
manhood. In all correct judgments
the man is more than his accomplish
ments; more than what he can do.
Under the cry of "reform" tho atten
tion of the community is at times di
rected from the main question from
the purpose of education to some of its
more tangible, specific fruits. It has
not yet been permanently led astray.
Charlatans, themselves ignorant,
have often tried to cover up their ig
norance by a petty war on the practices
of their age. The very superficiality
of their mis-named attainments has led
them to attack the surface faults of
their time, and in so far as their assaults
have led more thoughtful men than
tfcMaselves to reform, they have been,
ins degree, useful. Their work has
been, and evermore must be, of a low
rder.
The demand has lour, and noiailj
Confronted ns that the education in our
achools shall be "practical." To this
aD agree. Bnt what are we to under
stand by "practical?" Here lies the
difficulty. Some say: "Teach a child
what he shall do in after life." On
the face of it, this seems a reasonable
proposition. Close examination proves
it to be nonsense not worthy of re
spectful consideration. Who has the
prescience to tell what a child is to do
in after life especially an American
child? To-day Illinois is represented
in the U. S. Senate by a dry-goods
merchant, and the Mayor of Chicago
was trained as a plumber and civil
engineer.
It will not be seriously questioned
that the man, launched on the world o!
affairs, should, so far as he can, devote
himself to that which he can do
the best and which he can do better
than the average of his fellow men. It
is undoubtedly tho duty of the farmer,
as it certainly is his aim. to bring to
market the largest amount of grain
and stock in the best condition his
farm can be made to produce. But he
will be more of a man, and hence a
better citizen, if while producing these
material products he knows something
of botany, chemistry, and geology.
Taking more interest in his work by
reason of his knowledge of helping
science, he will be just so much more
of a man-
The province of education is to make
the man. The exigencies of his lot will
determine what the man shall do. The
most impractical of all educations is to
so train the child as to make him de
pendent on some one avocation for his
support in life. Intelligence.
Let us give our teachers and educa
tors that cordial and generous recogni
tion that their faithfulness and work
deserves.
It is a fact that all people who 'are at
all worthy like to be recognized, like
to have their work appreciated. There
is more in this recognition than people
dream of.

"If I should tell thee o'ent his, thy days work,
Thou'Idbt not believe thy deeds."

The young manor woman who goes mumping
for want of some useful occupation in this day ol
enterprise has a sorry prospect. Hundreds oi
young persons have, after spending a few months
ata good institution for teaching the art, become
shorthand writers, ami are now acting as aman
uensis in all kinds of business offices, at good
salaries. It seems the easiest and quickest road
to something useful, remunerative, and perma
nent to do. Ponder on this and send to the
