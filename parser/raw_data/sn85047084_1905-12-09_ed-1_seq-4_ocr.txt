ARCHDEACON JEFFRIES
STEBE0PT1C0N LECTURE
Archdeacon Jeffries delivered a high
ly interesting stereoptkon lecture at
St. Clement's last evening to a very at
tentive audience. His views were
mostly taken by himself on his travels
around the world, or else they were
taken by other members of his party
and exchanged.
The Archdeacon has a valuable col-
kong, Canton, Korea (including Che
mulpo, Fusan and Seoul), Japan and
the Inland Sea, Port Arthur and Vladi
vostok. He also has some excellent
photographs of prominent Russian of
ficers both naval and military.
In connection with his Canton pic
tures, the Archdeacon spoke of the
fact that nearly every Chinese in Ha
waii or the United States is from Can
ton. He also remarked that two con
suls, the retiring and tne incoming
one (presumably American consuls),
told him that during the late war the
guage, familiarizing themselves with
u..,.i v. K.,inAl nr snnerseded. mere are ui-auj
ever w hie h point to success. Before President Roosevelt's annual message was

10 the importation of a thousand Portuguese families, probably numbering five
thousand persons, who will be eligible to citizenship. The practical importance
- of this movement can readily be appreciated. It will involve much expense,
but the immediate addition to our population of a thousand families, of JSuro-
- pean extraction and capable of rapid assimilation, will sensibly and materially
improve the business conditions of Hawaii.
But this is only one of the measures tending to arrest the departure of
American citizens and to promote the increase of that most desirable class.
The land policy of the territorial government has been liberalized, and there
is a prospect of large sections being opened to settlement. If a bargain is
struck -with the proposed Russian emigrants from southern California, who are
intelligent, moral and thrifty, and in no respect identified with the ignorant
and now turbulent masses of Muscovy, the, ranks of Hawaiian producers will

,i f-hniMllv mmlifip.l to deliver authoritative opinions on the sub- . the Cantonese and that they confident-
iuiui m s vJi uu j
jeet, asserts that there is ample room on the Hawaiian Islands for 100,000
American farmers. This declaration, sustained by facts and figures, should
have a wide influence and should be energetically and systematically backed up
by the territorial authorities, who can thus meet the prevalent arguments in
iavor of the relegation of the public lands to Fedeial control.
The policy of Asiatic exclusion is almost unanimously sustained upon the
mainland and in Congress and has received the direct sanction of the adminis
tration. It rests upon grounds that have been lately grouped together in the
columns of the Advertiser, over' the signatures of well-known citizens. It is
also vigorously supported by territorial, state and national organizations of
wage-earners. The prospect is that it will not be modified but extended, proba
bly with the sanction of the Japanese Empire, to Japanese and Koreans, in fact
to. all Asiatics. A determination is also evinced to stop the intrusion of
Asiatics, with their peculiar and un-American economics, into the mechanical
industries and even into trade and commerce, within the United States. It is
claimed that Americans and American firms and corporations that employ citi
zen labor are unable to reduce their expense accounts to a scale that will
enable them to compete with alien Asiatics, wherever the latter exist in suffi
cient numbers to organize raids upon business. American mechanics are at least
equal to any mechanics in the world. But they are accustomed to liberal wages
and to comfortable homes, and they can not and will not come down to Asiatic
standards. If they are erowded out of employment, in Hawaii for instance, on
an American basis, they will go, as they have gone, elsewhere. The same facts
and reasoning apply to small trading and even to commercial enterprises of ' came so accustomed to this sort of
utility, and importance. It is insisted that America is principally for the,
Americans, that they are not to be excluded from different occupations, to
which they have the first right, and that it is the plain duty of the Federal
government to sustain the American people against aliens who are incapable of
naturalization. '
: These propositions are being discussed by leading newspapers and by all
classes of citizens, but especially within the ranks of unionized labor, here and
on the mainland. They are pressed upon Congress, which is quickly responsive
to. public opinion, and have attracted the active interest of the heads of de
partments and of the Chief Executive of the Nation. It is highly probable that
drastic legislation will be enacted that will operate throughout the Union, and
that, in the territories and other possessions, where the national legislature ia
virtually supreme, Asiatic competition with citizens will be at least controlled
and, perhaps destroyed. Meanwhile it is an auspicious fact. that, in Hawaii, the
process of Americanization has been accelerated by the efforts of its own people.

JOHN H. MITCHELL.
The death of Senator Mitchell ends his career in the best way. Torn from
high plaee by legal process there was nothing' for him to live for. To such a
man a conviction of felony must necessarily be a death warrant, sooner or later.
In Mitchell's case it was sooner.
Remembering the kindly ways, the benevolent looks and the cheerful
philosophy of the Oregon Senator it is difficult to say of hira what justice de
iinands. Men worse than he have been able to take refuge behind the humane
admonition, De mortuis nil nisi bonum; and we may well' let him hide there in
- his unhappy fellowship. But as a warning his life may serve a useful purpose
as' showing where the national tendency towards what vre have come to know
as "graft" must lead.
What more fitting comment on the school of polities to which John II.
-jiitcbell belonged than these words of Nicholas Murray Butler:
Put bluntly, the situation which confronts Americans today
is due to lack of moral principle. New statutes may be needed,
but statutes will not put moral principle where it does not exist.
The greed for gain and the greed for power have blinded men to
t&e time-old distinction between right and wrong. Both among bus
iness men and at the bar are to be found advisers, counted shrewd
and successful, who have substituted the penal code for the moral
law as the standard of conduct. Eight and wrong have given way
te the subtler distinction between legal, not illegal, and illegal; or
fcetter, perhaps, between honest, law-honest, and dishonest. The
iew triumph of mind over morals is bad enough in itself ; but when
im addition, its exponents secure material gain and professional
prosperity it becomes a menace to our integrity as a people."

ly expected, had the war lasted long
enough, to have not only taken Ko
rea, but Canton and part of China as
well.
The harbor of Chemulpo is exceed
ingly shallow' and with a tide of thirty
five feet, it is dangerous, but the Rus
sian warships risked it when the Japa
nese would not. They staid outside
and demanded that the Russians come
out and fight on equal footing. In Ko
rea there are no temples, the Arch
deacon remarked, but there are plenty
of "devil-posts" intended to be so hide
ous that even the devils will be fright
ened away. That kingdom is called
"The Land of the Morning Calm" and
the name is well given, as the people
are almost too lazy to breathe.
The speaker related an amusing in
cident in connection -with the Korean
Emperor, who is so afraid of his life,
after the murder of the Empress, that
he spends haf the night leaning over
his garden wall adjoining the Amer
ican legation and imploring the Amer
icans to protect him. The American
soldiers on guard at the legation be-
thing that they finally got into the
habit of singing out familiarly to His
Imperial Majesty, "Oh, go to bed, dad,
we will keep our eyes open."
An interesting side light on the lib
erality of the Japanese was the pic
ture of Japanese converts to the Greek
Catholic faith made by the captured
Russian Bishop. Among them were of
ficers of the Japanese army in full uni
form, sitting alongside Russian soldiers
and priests. A group of the aborig
ines of Japan was unique. They are
dying out like the American Indians,
but they have the largest brains of any
people in the world. A case of big
head and little in it.

Mother Parker was born during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson and
at the zenith of Napoleon's fame. Washington had died six years before. In

the Pacific coast, the Indians the vast regions between there and the Mississippi
with numerous tribes still holding ground east of that great stream. When
Mother Parker was born there was not, it is believed, a four story house on the
continent. She antedated the locomotive, the telegraph, the sewing machine
the cotton gin, the steamship, the steel pen, the photograph, the fast printing
press, the horse car, illuminating gas, applied electricity, machine-made wares
of nearly every kind, most of the medicines now in use and a thousand and one
comforts and utilities as common now as soda water, ice cream and the lucifer
match. Before her has passed the most remarkable spectacle of growth and
progress in material things the world has ever looked upon.
