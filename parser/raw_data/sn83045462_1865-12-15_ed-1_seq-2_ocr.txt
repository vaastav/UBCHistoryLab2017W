The State Department has received a com
mnnication from our Consul at Havre France,
dated November 30. 1*?>5, containing the following
account of tbe rise, progress, and disappearance
of the cholera at that port: Cholera
flrsf appeared on the loth day of October, and
was doubtlee? introduced by an arrival from
Pane, where the disease was at its height, of
about nine hundred German emeigranta, on
their way to New York. There were about
fifty deaths from cholera at Havre, principally
among tbe poorer classes in tbe environs.
During the last ten days of November not a
siugle case had been reported, and tbe chief
health officer pronounced the city free from all
contagious disease, and had been instructed to
deliver clean bills of health to vessels leaving
thai port.

The Commissioner of Customs received information
yesterday that a cargo of whisky,

The goods were smuggled from Canada,

The Khmas Fund.?The balance sheet of
the books of the "Irish Republic," showing
the receipts of the Fenian Brotherhood from
all sources during the month ending October
2f<, jut.t published in the New York papers,
causes no little surprise, as indicating the enormous
strength of the organization in the United
States, and even in the British Provinces.
It fills about six newspaper columns, in
small type, and foots up by the hundreds of
thousands. Not one in a thousand of the best
informed among our citizens had any idea of
tbe extent of this Fenian movement, and it has
suddenly acquired, in the eyes of many, a dignity
which it never before possessed. The receipts
from some cities are very large.
For instance, among the credits to various
Circles in Chicago are the following, for the
month ending October 2*thDistrict, S1,000;
Twenty-first District, f3,000; Chicago District,
VP, uw; miuioy, ?iuv; uuicago l USl rut. *4,000;
and, altogether, the anna.il receipts from this
one city cannot be lees than one hundred and
ffly thousand doUart. But the feature of this
exhibit which creates so much talk is the re.
turn from the British Provinces. With a caution,
the necessity of which is evident, the
names of those through whom the money was

to tbe weekly dues, a call was made

Tm Wilkt-Buown Cask? The RuUlaidon
Mr. Bradley.?In yesterday's Star we stated
that in the course of the argument in the Wiley
Brown case before the Circuit Court, Judge
Olin presiding, i?n exciting scene occurred between
Mr. Bradley, who was arguing tbe case
011 tbe part of tbe defense, and the Uoart. The
result of this was tbe service of a rule on Mr.
Bradley to show cause why he should not be
punished for contempt, returnable at 10 o'clock
this morning.
At the opening of the court this morning there
was a large number of spectators present, in>
eluding nearly the entire bar, great interest
being felt as to the final disposition of the mat.
ter: and after the crowd had become seated, the
following took place:
Tbe Oourt.?I was about to observe, Mr
Bradley, that a rule was yesterday made by
me direction yon to sbow cause this morning
why yon should not be punished for cootempt
of coart, committed on yesu-rday, as alleged.
1 am unwilling. however, on further reflection
to do anything at this point of time to interfere
with the progress of the trial now on hand, or
to deprive the parties litigant of any right
which they have and certainly ought to enjoy
by reason of your employment as counsel, and
I would therefor* sucgest, Mr. Bradley, that
yon go on and complete yonr argument of the
cause and let this matter be postponed until
Saturday or Monday morning, as may best suit
your convenience.
Mr. Bradley.?If the Court please, before any
disposition is made of the case I desire to file
the answer to the rnle laid upon me. How far
under the circumstances it is fitting and proper
that 1 should further conduct the case before
the jury -will depend In a great measure upon
the course the Court may Me lit to pursne under
this rule. If, after reading the answer to
that rule, your Honor shall be dispoead to main
the eame disposition of it that you now hare.
I will consult with my colleague and be very
glad to ivnder any aervioe I can to my client.
I stand bare for them and them alone.
The Court.?I think it is not worth while to
do so, unless you insist upon baring this mat*
tor diepoeed of tfeto momlBf I desire that
your clients may bare the benefit of your ervices,
to which they are entitled, and consequently
ds aot wish to embarrass or prejudice
the case, if 1 can avoid it, by any disposition
which may be properly made of this controversy.
Mr. Bradley ?Thea yomr Honor will not be
Willinc to let it lie over as yoa suggest now,
after the return is read to the Court
The Court.?Yon miv file roar initrer. and
let it lay over. 1 repeat, 1 do not wish to hear
it bow BSlni 1 am to dispoM of the question
this morning
Mr. Bradley.?The answer has already been
filed, together with the copy of the rule which
has been served on me.
The Court?1 will again observe just here,
that I dislike exceedingly that the ordinary
course of iuat.c* should be interrupted in thia
way; and I think it ia due to the clients whom
you represent in the attitude in which they are
placed by a controversy of thia description,
that they should have the be?t exerctoeof your
ability in their defense. It wonld afford m*
muca gratification u you would go on and discharge
your duty to your client as you understand
it.
Mr. Bradley.?I did not anticipate, youi
Honor, any such course in the proceeding*,
and therefor# will not be preparal to proceed
for a few moments.
The court then took a recess for '.20 minute*.
On the reassembling of the court, Mr. Bradley
n'fumed bis argument in the ca*?.

and Alexandria railroad depot at Alexandria,
commenced on Tuesday under the personal
supervision of General H. L. llobinson. still
continues and is very well attended by railroad
men, manufacturers and capitalists from all
parts of the country.
The prices obtained by auctioneer Williams,
(Arm of Green k. Williams) of this city, who
is conducting the sale, are excellent, and thus
l&r the bale is regarded a# the mo6t successful
quartermaster's sale which has yet taken pi are,
not excepting the sale of railroad material at
Newbern a few weeks, and has averaged for
the past three days from two to three hundred
thousand dollars. Among the largest purchasers
are the ltaltimore and Ohio Railroad,
represented by Master of the Koad. Wilson, the
Loudon and Hampshire by Mr. Jos. I). Stewart,
Messrs. Kbert A IV>., ft. Y., and Mr. Foot.
The railroad iron sold at from #60 to XeS per

railroad, represented by Mr. Wilson, purchased
a large lot of the rails, as also the Loudon

Stewart, the latter also taking a large quantity
of lumber. Messrs. fcbert it. Co.,of New York,
bought the spikes, and the walnut was purchased
by a Baltimore Arm. There are two
large warehouses full of material, which remains
to be sold, and the sale will occupy some
days yet.

Poi.uk?Tbe fomtb annual report of the
Hoard of Metropolitan Police to the Secretary
of the Interior makes important representations
in regard to the necessity of adding to
the strengh of a police force organized for a
population ol half the present number, and especially
in view of the large number of desperate
characters attracted here since the close
of the rebellion.
The Board of Police urges upon Congress a
radical aud immediate reform in the system of
mngb-tracy in rogue in this District. There
are now a large number ol persons in the District
who bold commissions as justices of tbe
peace, many of whom are acting as magistrates.
These magistrates do not appear to be
accountable to any authority for their act*, and
they make no repert of their proceedings. It
is doubtful whether some of them even keep a
docket. hUkch of these magistrates usually has
al*>ut his office one or more men known as
county constables, self-styled "detective#."
w ho apparently hold some kind of connexion
witn the magistrate in the way of "working
up" case*, and bringing business to his (the
magistrate's) office.
The board again urges upon Congress that
some provision be made for the detention and
punishment of juvenile offenders within this
District. Frequently it becomes necessary for
magistrates to commit youths of tender years
to the common jail, there to associate with the
worst and most abandoned characters. But
more frequently tbe magistrates feel it to be
their duty to dismiss such offenders, simply because,
iti their opinion, the ends of justice

Compared with previousannual reports, this
report shows that the number of arrests during
the past year are nearly three thousand more
than during any former year: and that the fines
imposed are nearly double the amount of any
previous year; reaching the very extraordinary
sum of It may be' proper here
to t-tate that the actual expense to the corporations
of Washington ana (J-eorgetown and
the county of Washington, of the present police
force, is about *45,WJ0. This sum, deducted
from the amount of fines imposed and paid
over to these jurisdictions under the prevent
system, gives a difference of ?16,94-192. Hence
it will be observed that the Metropolitan Polirp

Rrmnan Cars THaorcu the Streets rt

morning: Justice Walter made bis decision In
the cases of John Shulze, Robert Kinzman,
James Doyle, L. J. Gilbert, H. R. Peytonton,
and R. 11. Smith, emploveeson the Orange and

A. O. Kiddle, Esq., and W. B. Webb, Esq.
These parties were arretted by tbe sanitary
officers of tbe Fourth Ward, charged with
"running cars through the street* and avenues
of the city by steam, endangering the lives and
health of the public," under the second section
of tbe act of July 16th. 1863, amending the
Metropolian Police act, and the decision has
be?t looked for with much interest.
Justice Walter gave his decision as follows
"After a careful examination in this case, I
have come to tbe conclusion that the running
of cars by steam tbroMgh the public street* and
avenues "of this city is dangerous to the life and
health of the public, and it is therefore a nuis ao

paruculnr case under the second section of the
act of July I6th, 1063, an order to prevent the
running of cars by steam, as no provision is
made aa to how'the order is to be enforced:
neither is there any fine prescribed for a violation
of tbt* law. The act uses the team *uch
tines as are imposed by law,' but I can find no
| law covering this case. Item* satisfied, however.
that the act complained of 'running cars
through the streets and avenues by steam contrary
to law,' is a misdemeanor, I will bold
the parties to bail to answer the charge at
court."

which was built at the Philadelphia yard and

was still lying yesterday afternoon. Her machinery
is in charge ol First Assistant Henry
Snyder, who, it will 1* recollected, had charge
of the machinery of the Eutaw, and there is
