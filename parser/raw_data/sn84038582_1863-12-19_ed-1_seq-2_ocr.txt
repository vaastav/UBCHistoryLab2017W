THE PRESIDENTS MESS A 01
As remarked in our last, there is nothing
worthy of com men t in the 1'iWmIU'
Message, except that portion which discus
ses the proclamation appended to it, and
that proclamation i self. Tb eubatance
of the whole is, that the President oifer
an amnesty and pardon to all rebt-U ex
cepting the following:
The civil and diplomatic officers Ki the
confederacy; Senators R-prc;-n la lives
and Judges, who have " secede."." ; officers
who have lesigned service .i the United
States army and navy' ar.d taken positions
with the enemy; present and pa-t officers
in the re-t.e-1 armv of and above the rank
oChieI, nu'l in the rebel navy of and
above th rank of Lieutenant, together
with all who have engaged in any way in
treating colored soldiers as otherwise tfc,au
p-'.joner o: war.
On the conditio that they take and
subscribe the following oath:
" I do solemnly swear, in the presence
of Almighty God, that 1 will henceforth
support, protect, and defend the cowststu
tien of the United States and theUnion of
the Suites thereunder; and that I will, in
like manner, abide oy and faithfully sup
port all acts of Congress passed during the
exiHting rebellion with refer nee to slaves,
so long and so far as not repealed, modi
fied or held void by congress or by decis
ion of the Supreme Court ; and that I will,
in like manner, abide bv and faithfully
support all proclamations of the President,
made during the existing rebellion, having
reference to slaves, so lonj: and so far s
not modified or declared void by decision
of the Supreme Court. So help me God."
Alter a number at the voters ot any se
ceded State equal to one-tenth of the votes
cast at the last Presidential election shall
have taken and swVscribed to this oath,
they (the one-tenth) may re-organize the
government of such State, and the govern
ment so re formed, will be recegnized and
protected by the United States.
This is all there is of the President's
plan of reconstruction. It is somewhat
slipshod and indefinite in these, among
other respects, that in enumeratieg the
"exceptions'" frem the benefit of the pro
posed amnesty, he intimates that the list
will probably be enlarged hereafter; and
that the plan of lec nsiruction he pro
poses is merely suggestive, the President
intimating while this will be accepted,
otheri may prove equally acceptable.
It is generally understood that this proc
lamation is issued as Mr. Lincoln's trump
card for the next Presidency, which is the
simplest explanation to be offered for these
indefinite ami noncommittal features
about it. The radicals are satisfied, be
cause they take it as a pledga from the
President that he will not withhold h s
assent from a plan of iec instruction they
hope to work through Coagress that shall
be much stronger and more severe in its
provisions and condit:ons; the moderate
republicans are satisfied, for it '.a as mild
as they had any reason to expect; while a
large sha eof conserw rve d mocrats are
j expected to be appeased by the. hone the
prd!i;dent holds out th the pi .n may be
,;ckeJ nto a sh lliat shau bd fr.e fr031
insuperable objections even to them.
As it stands, without if- or buts, lire ob
jections to it are apparent on i- statement.
The President, in plain English, tells the
people of -the seceded States, no uitter

conscience, deprives themoPiheh pro -
ty. and submits them to be ruled by a
fraction of their population, mad - up, very
likely, if the very rouii rcuff of the
Sta-e?
The plan is also wholly impracticable.
Though it b n the s;.vin c u e t.'iat in

"renegade southern" judges? To ask the
Beoole of t'le sout b-fore thev can be
purged of the crime of rebellion, to sup
port the Constitution aud all laws made in
pursuance thereof, is indisputably fair and
reasonable but to pre -ribe ci-r ain laws
and proclamations of, to say the least, very
doubtful constitutionality, as tests, is recon
c (able with no p- naiyle ,f law, ju t e,
or common sense. .wuch an oat i, asie

the :procl mi tti'-n deno ncin th rebel
privateer as pirates, Jfcc., t s invo'ves the
"support" of the coi.fi-cution act, the con
scription act, the negro ei.liafment act, &c.
1 be people of the south tv.ll never take
such an oath until they become so abject
and degraded that it would be anything
but desirable that th-y should tuke it.
We desire to treat the Pi esident's pro
posed amnesty and plan of reconstruction
with all candor and fairness It is a s ep
in the right direction, and so far let him
have credit for :t. But it is a very short,
halting and uncertain step. Without if
or but s without its qualifications and
non-committalisms, the plan wtuid differ
very little from the Sumner Whiting state
suicide plan. With these, it is really with
out point or practical meaning a mere
electioneering card a bait to catch gud
geons. The rebel Confess met at Rnchmoud
on the same day the federal Congress met
at Washington, and Jeff Davis sent in a
Message a good deal lon.er, and we" are
forced to admit, vastly more ably written"
than that sent to our Congress by Presi
dent Lincoln. The rebel President, how.
ever, gives a very Ingubriotis account of
the financial and military condition of the
"Confederacy," and scolds like a duke with
the gout through three or fuur colu-uns of
minion, at the ill treatment his govern
ment has received not only at the hands
of the U. S , but of England, France, and
all other foreign nations. It is said the
present seion of Congress promise to be
a very stormy one, as the question of re
construction will be fearlessly presented
to the Southern people by the members
from North Carolina.
Mr. Dt, newly elected School Com mis
sioner'of this county, requests us to state

CONGRESS
The standing cisnmilte s were announ
ced in both houses on Monday. There
was no change ni'.de in the chairmen in
the Senate. In the House Stevens, of Pa.
i- at the ht-ad of Ways and Means, Sehenk
n Mi'itary Affairs, Arnold on Koads and
Ctials, tc
Fernando Wood offered a resolution in
the House on Monday to send peace com
missioners to Richmond, which was voted
down, 98 to 59.
There is an evident determination to
amend the conscription law. A bill for
that purpose ha already been reported
from the Military Committee of the Senate
by Mr. Wilson, and will pass that . body at
an early day. It abolishes all money ex
emptions, and only permits substitutes.
There is but one class in the bill, thu
making all male persons from 20 to 45
subject to draft. The other causes for ex
emption are very much reduced. an only
son of a widow, and the father f mother
less children under a certain age, being the
principal ones.
Lovejoy in the House, and Hale in the
Senate have each introduced a bill for the
abolition of slavery throughout the United
States by net of Congress !
The wholo subject of reconstruction
presented by the President's Message an-?
Proclamation, is turned over to a specia'
couimitfe of thirteen, of which Stevens
is 'chairman.
Mr. Rollins, of Mo., offered the Critten
den resolution in the House for re adoption
A motion by Lovejoy to lay it on the table
was defeated by 114 to 50. It is still
pending.
Both Houses were expected to adjourn
from yesterday, (19th) over to January
5te.

backbone manifested by the President in
the nutter of the retention of Gen. Scho
fidd in command in Msssouri in spite of
the " pressure'' of the radicals of that
State, has been easily broken by a rein
forcement of t'n ' pressure" from another
quarter. The Union Leaguers had a grand
National conventicle at Washington about
t ie time of the meeting of Congress, and
this body appointed a committee to wait
on the President and instruct him in sun
dry Utile matt -rs of duty. They ordered
hi:n to reniave Schofield at once, and de
manded that his cabinet be cleared of
every vestige of conservative element.
Seward, Bates, Blair nd Ualleck must be
removed. and their places filled by Sumner,
Fremont. Bailer, Ac. The President suc
cumbed to this authority. Schofield's
h-ad dropped at once, and the rest doubt
less will follow in due time.

sr keii in praise of hirn since the battle
fie has the admiration of his whole regi
ment for the coolnes. courage and com
petency he diilayed in the charge of
Missionary Iiide. Col Hapman has
proved himself to be a good regimental
commander, both in camp and on the bat
tie-field. " Who is that little officer that
commanded the I04ih to-day ?" asked a
soldier, after the fight was over. "That
was Lieut Col. Hapeman," I answered
" Bully for him I wish he commanded
our regiment," was the soldier like rejoin

Coming in Oct of the Dbaft. The rush to
Joliet fro u all parts of this Congressional
district to u.el exemption pape is from the
draft commissioners amounts almost to a
stampede. We are told from six to seven
hundred prp!e have been present con
stantly awaiting their turn for the last
wek, and as the 20th draws near the rush
ncreases. It will be impossible to give
half the applicants a hearing within the
time limited.
By the way, what sense or reason is
there in compelling 1000 men from " La
Salle county, 'for instance, to travel to Jol
iet to apper before two or three dignita
ries, when the said dignitaries could at so
much less expense, spend a few days at
Ottawa? It looks to us like imposition.
Fugitives to Canada. It is estimvted
that there are over ten thousand deserters

of fifteen of twenty thousand more fugi
1 ives from the draft, it is said many ol
tbee are great destitution, and would
gladly return if they could do so witb

proclamation for their relief, offering a
Tree pardon to such as return te their reg

After various assertions and con t radio
tions of the fact, it ii settled, we believe,
that the rebel at Richmond refuse to re
ceive further ?uppliesfrom the north for the
Union prisionersthereconfined Therei son
given far this resolution is, the assertion
in Northern papers that these contribu
tions were not distributed in good faith to
the prisoners, and the villitication lavished
upon the confederation in consequence.
All supl'es already received will be dis
tributed: and the prisoners hereafter will
receive precisely the same rations as rebel
soldiers.
The President has pardoned the rebel
Genera! Gantt, of Arkansas, the penalties
of treason incurred by him, Gen G bav
ing renounced the Confederation and pro
claimed himself an abolitionist and Union
man. As the law holds a man to be inno
cent of crimes alleged against him until
he is couvicted by "due p recess, it is cer
tainly an anomalous procedure thus to
pardon a man for crimes of which he is
legally presumed to be guiltless.
The Supreme Court of this State has
made a decision in the celebrated Wabash

legality of the prorogation of the legisla

bis action on the part of the Senate aad
