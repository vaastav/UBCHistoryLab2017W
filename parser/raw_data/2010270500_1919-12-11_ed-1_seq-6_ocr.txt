SEES PEACE DELAY
AS UNREST CAUSE
President Wilson So Declares in
Message Read Before Both
Houses of Congress.
BUDGET SYSTEM IS URGED
Necessity of Increased Production to
Help Decrease Cost of Living
Imperative Need of Definite
Program Concerning La"bor.
Washington, Dec. 2. President Wll
son'H message, which was read to both
houses of congress today, only Inci
dentally mentioned tho pcaco treaty,
blaming tho delay In ratification as
one of the causes of nation-wide un
rest. Tho president said:
I hope that congress will bring to a
conclusion at this (tension leglilatlon look
ing to thu establishment of a. budget sys
tem. That thero should bo ono slnglo au
thority rcsponslblo for the making of all
nppropilatlons and that appropriations
should be made not Independently of each
other but with rofercnpo to ono slnglo
comprehensive plan of expenditure prop
erly related to the nation's Income thoro
can be no doubt. I belluvo tho burden of
preparing the budget must, In the natura
of the case, If tho work Is to bo properly
done and responsibility concentrated In
stead of divided, rest upon the executive
The budget so prepared should be sub
mitted to and approved or amended by n
single committee of each house of con
gress, and no single appropriation should
be made by the congress, except such as
may have been Included in tho budget
prepared by the executive or added by
th particular committee of congress
charged with tho budget legislation.
Another and not less Important aspect
of tho problem Is the ascertainment of
the economy and efficiency with which
the moneys appropriated are expended.
Under existing law the only audit Is for
the purpose of ascertaining whether ex
penditures have been lawfully mado with
in the appropriations. No one Is author
ized or equipped to ascertain whether
the monoy has been spent wisely, eco
nomically nnd effectively.
Taxation Question Taken Up.
I trust that the congress will give Its
Imtncdlato consideration to tho problem
of future taxation. Simplification of tho
incomo und profits taxes has bocomo an
lmmadiate necessity. Those taxes per
formed Indispensable service during tho
war. They must, however, be simplified,.
not oniy to save tne taxpayer inconven
ience and oxpenso, but In order that his
liability may be made certain and definite.
With reference to tho dotalls of the
revenue law, tho secretary of tho treas
ury and tho commissioner of internal rev
enue will lay before you for your consid
eration certain amendments nocessary or
desirable In connection with tho aumlnls
tratlon ot the law rocommondatlons
which have my UDDroval and sutmart
It Is of the utmost Importance that In
dealing with this matter the presont law
should not bo disturbed so far as regards
taxes for tho calendar year 1!0, payable
In tho calendar year 1921. Tho congress
might well consider whether the higher
rates of Income and profits taxes can In
peace times be effectively productive of
revenue and whother thoy may not, on
tho contrary, be destructive ot business
activity and productive ot waste and In
efficiency. There Is a point at which In peace times
high rates of Incomo and profits taxes
discourage energy, remove tho Incentive
to new enterprise encourage extravagant
expenditures und produce Industrial stug.
nation with consequent unemployment
am) other, attendant ovllii.
The messugo then discussed the fa
Torablo balauco of trade and tho need
of adjusting our economic life to tho
changed conditions and of abandon
ing the policy of Isolation. In tho
matter of recognition and relief for
returned soldiers tho president re
puted the recommendations In his
last message. Ho also urged tariff
revision to protect our chemical und
dyostuff Industries. He continued:
Farmers Are Praised.
During the war tho farmer per
formed a vital and willing service to
the nation. By materially Increasing
the production ot his land, he supplied
America and the allies with the In
creased amounts of food necessary to
keep their Immense armies In tho field.
11 indispensably helped to win tho
war. But there Is now scarcely leas
need of Increasing the production In
food and the necessaries ot Ufa. I ask
the congress to consider means of en
couraging effort along those linos.
The Importance of dolnr everything
possible to promote production along
economical llnosi to lmprovo marketing
and to make rural life moro attractive
and healthful, Is obvious. I would urge
approval of the plans already proposed
to the congrcus by the secretary of ag
rloulturo, to secure the essential facts
required for the proper study of this
qusstlon, through the proposed en
Urged programs for farm management
studies and crop ostlmates.
I would urge, also, the continuance
ot fedoral participation In the building
of good roads, under tho torros ot ex
isting law and under the direction of
present agencies; the need of further
action on the part ot the states and the
federal government to preserve and
develop our forest resources, especially
inrougn tne practice or better forestry
methods on private holdings and the
extension of the publicly owned for
ests: better support for country schools
and the more definite direction of their
courses ot atudy along lines relatod to
rural problems; and fuller provision for
sanitation In rural districts nnd the
building up ot needed hospital and
medical facilities
Blames Government for Unrest.
1 would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political rest
lessness In our body politic. The
causes of this unrest, while vorlous
and complicated, are superficial rather
than deep seated. Uroadly, they arise
HOME OF THE CIRCUS.
A school teacher was reading an ex
citing story to her group of young
sters about tho Jungle. In order that
each child might understand clearly
what tho story was about, she B?ld:
"Which ono of you can toll me what
the Junglo Is?" Ono bright Uttlo boy
waved his hand In tho air and tho
teacher told him to give his definition.
Lie stood up before tho class with a
great deal .of Importance and Bald:
"The Jungle l whero the circus lives."
from or are connected with the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a Just and permanent
peace permitting return to normal con
ditions, from the transfusion of radical
theories from seething European centers
pending such delay, from heartless
profiteering resulting In the Increase of
the cost of living, and, lastly, from the
machinations of passionate and malev
olent agitators.' With the return to
normal conditions, this unrest will rap
Idly disappear. In the meantlmo It
docs much evil.
It seems to mo that In dealing with
this situation congress should not h!
Impatient or drastic, but should seek,
rather, to remove the causes. It should
endeavor to bring our country back
speedily, to-a. peace basis, with ameli
orated living conditions under the min
imum of restrictions upon personal lib
erty that Is consistent with our recon
struction problems. And It should arm
the federal govornment with power to
deal In Its criminal courts with those
persons who by violent methods would
abrogate our time-tested Institutions.
With the free expression of opinion
and with tho advocacy of orderly polit
ical change, however fundamental,
thoro must bo no Interference, hut to
ward passion and malevolence tending
to Incite crime and Insurrection undor
guise of political evolution thero
should be no leniency.
Should Extend Food Control,
I renow and strongly urge tho neces
sity of tho extonston of tho present
food-control act as to tho period of
time In which It shall remain In opera
tion. Tho attorney general has sub
mitted a bill providing for an exten
sion of this net for a period of' six
moriths. As It now stands It Is limited
In operation to tho period of tho war
and becomes inoperative upon tho
formul proclamation of pence. It Is
Impor.-xtlve that It should be extended
nt once. Tho department of Justice has
built up extcnslvo machinery for the
purposo of enforcing Its provisions; all
of which must he abandoned upon the
conclusion of peace unless the provi
sions of this act are extended.
During this period tho congress will
havo an opportunity to mako similar,
permanent provisions and regulations
with regard to all goods destined for
Intorstato commerce and to exclude
them from Interstate shipment, If the
ronulrements of tho law aro not com
piled with. Somo such regulation Is
imperatively necessary. The abuses
that have grown up In tho manipula
tion of prices by the withholding of
foodstuffs and other necessaries of life
cannot otherwise be effectively pre
vented. There can bo no doubt of
either tho necessity or the legitimacy
of such measures.
The president renewed his recom
mendations that n law be passed reg
ulating cold storage and that nil
goods destined for Interstate com
merco should be marked with the
price nt which they left the hands of
the producer. Ho also urged the fed
eral licensing of corporations engag
ing In Interstate commerce. Coming
to tho question of labor, the message
said :
Labor and Capital Peace Renewed.
No ono who has observed the march
of events in the last year can fall to note
the absolute need ot definite program
to bring about an improvement In .the
condition of labor. Thero can be no set
tled conditions leading to Increased pro
duction and a reduction In the cost ot
living If labor and capital are to be an
tagonists Instead ot partners.
Sound thinking and an honest desire
to servo tho Interests of the whole na
tion, as distinguished from the Interests
of a class, must be applied to the solu
tion of this great and pressing problem.
The failure of other nations to consider
this matter In a vigorous way has pro
duced bitterness and Jealousies and an
tagonisms, the food of radicalism. Tho
only way to keep men from agitating
against grievances Is to remove the griev
ances. An unwillingness even to discuss
these matters produces only dissatisfac
tion and gives comfort to the extreme
elemonts In our country, which endeavor
to stir up disturbance In order to provoko
governments to embark upon a course of
retaliation and repression. The. seed ot
revolution Is repression.
The remedy for these things must not
bo negative In character. It must.be con
structive. It must comprehend the gen
eral Interest, Tho real antidote for the
unrest which manifests Itself Is not sup
pression but a deep consideration of the
wrongs that beset our national life and
the application of a remedy,
Eight-Hour Day la Big Step.
Congress has already shown Its will
ingness to deal with these industrial
wrongs by establishing the eight-hour
day as the standard In every field ot
labor. It has sought to find a way to
prevent child labor. It has served the
whole country by leading the way In de
veloping the means ot preserving and
safeguarding Uvea and health in danger
ous Industries. It must now help In the
difficult task of finding a method that will
bring about & genuine demonstration of
Industry, based upon tne full recognition
ot the right ot those who work, In what
ever rank, to participate In some organlo
way In every decision which directly af
fects their welfare.
It Is with this purpose In mind that I
called a conference to meet In Washing
ton on December 1 to consider these prob
lems In all their broad aspects, with the
Idea of bringing about a better under
standing betwoen these two Interests.
Rights of Labor Are Cited.
The great unrest throughout the world,
out of which has emerged a demand for
an Immediate consideration of the diffi
culties between capital and labor, bids us
put our own house In order. Frankly,
there can be no permanent and lasting
settlements between capital and labor
whloh do not recognize the fundamental
concepts for which labor has been strug
gling through the years. The whole
world gave Its recognition and Indorse
ment to these fundamental purposes In
the League of Nations.
To analyze the particulars In the de
mands ot labor Is to admit the Justice of
their complaint In many matters that lie
at their basis. The workman demands
an adequate wage, sufficient to permit
him to live In comfort, unhampered by
the fear of poverty and want In his old
ace. II demands the right to live and
the right to work amidst sanitary sur
roundings, both In homo and in workshop,
surroundings that develop and do not re
tard his own health and well-being; and
the right to provide for his children's
wants In the matter of health and educa.
tlon. In other words, It Is his desire to
make the conditions of his life and the

lives of those dear to him toivrable ana

Collective Bargaining Right.
Governments must recognlzo the
right of men collectively to bargain for
humane objects that have at their base
the mutual protection and welfare of
thoso engaged In all Industries. Labor
must not be longer vemted ns a com
modity. It must be regarded as the
activity of human beings, possessed of
deep yearnings and desires. The busi
ness man gives his best thought to the
repair and replenishment of his ma
chinery, so that Its usefulness will not
bo Impaired and Its power to produce
may always bo at Its height and kept
In full vigor and l lotion.
No less regard ought to be paid to
the human machine, which, after all,
propels the machlnory of the world
and Is tho great dynamic force that
lies back of all Industry and progress.
Return to the old standards of wage
and Industry In employment aro un
thinkable. The tcrrlblo trngedy of war
which has Just ended and which has
brought the world to tho vorge of
chaos and disaster would be In vain If
thero should ensue a return to the con
ditions of the past.
Labor not only Is entitled to an ade
quate wage, but capital should receive
a reasonablo return upon Its Invest
ment and Is entitled to protection at
tho hands of tho government In every
emergency. No govornment worthy of
tho namo can play theso elements
against each other, for there Is a mu
tuality of Interest between them which
the government must seek to express
and to safeguard nt all cost
The right of Individuals to strike Is
Invlolato and ought not to be Inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, but there Is n predominant right
and that Is tho right of the govern
ment to protect all of Its people and to
nssert Its power and majesty against
tho challengo of any class. The gov
ernment, when It asserts that right,
seeks not to antagonize a class but
simply to defend tho right of the
whole people as against the Irreparable
harm and Injury that might bo done by
the attempt by any class to usurp a
power that only government Itself has
a right to exorcise as a protection to
all.
Hour of Test and Trial.
This Is the hour of teBt and trial for
America. By her prowess and strength
and the Indomitable courage of her sol
diers, she demonstrated her power to
vindicate on foreign battlefields her
conception of liberty and Justice. Let
not her Influence as a mediator be
tween capital and labor be weakened
and her own falluro to settle matters
of purely domestic concert bo pro
claimed to the world.
There aro those In this country who
threaten cllroct action to force their will
upon a majority. Russia today, with Its
blood and terror, Is a painful object les
son of the power of minorities. It makes
little difference what minority It ls;
whether capital or labor, or any other
class; no sort of privilege will ever be
permitted to dominate this country. We
are a partnership or nothing that Is worth
While.
Wo aro a democracy where the ma
jority are the masters or all the hopes
and purposes of tho men who founded
this government have been defeated and
forgotten. In America there Is but one
way by which great reforms can be ac
complished and the relief sought by
classes obtained, and that Is through the
orderly processes ot representative gov
ornment. Those who would propose any
other method of reform are enemies of
this country.
America will not be daunted by threats
nor lose her composure or calmness in
these distressing tlmcB. We can afford,
In the midst ot this day of passion and
unrest, to bo self-contained and sure.
The Instrument of all reform In America
Is the straight road ot Justice to all
classes and conditions of men. Men have
but to follow this road to realize the full
fruition of their objects and purposes. Let
those beware who would take the shorter
road ot disorder and revolution. The
right road Is the road of Justice and or
derly process.
