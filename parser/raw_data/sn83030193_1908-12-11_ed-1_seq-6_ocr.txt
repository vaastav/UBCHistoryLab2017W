I
Appellate Division Urged to
I
Ignore Report of Referee
on Magistrate
I
I Counsel for the Bar Association np
peared before the Appellate Division of
the Supremo Court First Department
today and asked for the removal of
City Magistrate Otto 11 llroege not
withstanding the report of Referee Will
lam H Willis that Magistrate Proege J
had done only what other city masls I
I
ttates had done
I
Wallace Macfnrlane for the Hal As
pcclatlon did not approve of the report I
of the referee In summing up he 1
nskcd for the removal of Droege on j
these grounds
That Droege knew that some of his
I
discharges were Illegal
That he paid money to the reporters
I
to suppress their criticisms of these Illegal
j
legal acts I
i
That a Judge who offers money to
hush publicity of Illegal acts committed
by him as a Judge Is unworthy lore
jmaln on the bench I
Counsel for the Bar Association told
II of the charges co cernlng Magistrate
Droege explaining that the socalled sup
plementary charges were made to the
1 Bar Association by Mayor McClellan
after the first charges had ben sub
I mlttcd to the Appellate Court Hrlelly
j reviewing the case he said that accord
Ing to the first charges Magistrate
Droege had offered to pay reporters and
I did pay a reporter through Max Alter
I a lawyer 100 to Induce him to refrain
j from publishing criticisms of the Magis
itrat
I Now said the lawyer the refero
finds every charge Is true that the
I whole sixteen discharges were unlawful
and further finds that Magistrate Droege
i fell into the prevailing practice of the
other city Magistrates and thinks he
should not he removed The whole sys
tem of dealing with this class of of
fenders has been nullified by the Magis
trate appointed to carry It out
Howard Sans for the defense asked
i for a dismissal of the case
I The evidence lie said established
conclusively that the practice of dls
charging prisoners after commitment
to the workhouse was well established
I long betore Dmege took ofllce and
that It was adopted by him In entirely
I good faith
Do you mean to say Mr dam
asked Justice Ingraham that any in
telligent lawyer reading the charter
could get any other interpretation out
of It than that the magistrate had
only power to discharge after twenty I
dnyYour
Your Honor said Mr Guns I
dont know how intelligent 3 am but
that is the Interpietatlon I tool of It I
and I have u report of the Corporation
I Counsel who oas the provision In the
charter Is a doubtful one and should I
he passed on by a higher court And I
I always gave the Corporation Coun
sel credit for Intelligence I
Arguments were concluded today but I
the Cpurt reserved Its decision I
