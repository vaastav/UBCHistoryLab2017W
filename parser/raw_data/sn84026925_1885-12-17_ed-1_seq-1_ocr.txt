USE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE^
1 The first message of President Cleveland
, to Congress was read before that body on
the 8th instant. It is a very lengthy document,
and opens with a reference to the
death of Vice-President Hendricks, as fol'
lows:
Your assembling is clouded by a sense of
public bereavement, caused by the recent
and sudden death of Thomas A. Hendricks,
Vice-President of the United States. His
distinguished public services, his complete
integrity and devotion to every duty, and
his personal virtues will find honorable re
A m r-kl n onrl

repeated proofs of the esteem and confidence
in which he was held by his fellow-countrymen,
were manifested by his election to offices
of the most important trust and the
highest dignity, and at length, full of years
and honors, he has been laid at rest amid
universal sorrow and benediction.
The Constitution which requires those
chosen to legislate for the people to annually
meet in the discharge of their solemn
trust, also requires the President to give to
Congress information of the state of the
Union, and recommend to their consideration
such measures as he shall deem necessary
and expedient. At the threshold of a
compliance with these constitutional directions,
it is well for us to bear in mind that
our usefulness to the people's interests will
be promoted by a constant appreciation of
the scope and character of our respective
duties as they relate to Federal legislation.
While the Executive may recommend !
such measures as he shall deem expedient,
the responsibility for legislative jiction
must and should rest upon those selected
by the people to make their laws. Contemplation
of the grave and responsible
function assigned to the respective branches
of the government under the Constitution
will disclose the partition of power between
our respective departments and their necessary
independence, and also the need for the
exercise of all the power entrusted to eacn.
In that spirit of comity and co-operation
which is essential to the proper fulfillment
of the patriotic obligations which rest upon
us as the faithful servants of the people,
the jealous watchfulness of our constituencies,
great and small, supplements their
suffrages, and before the tribunal they establish
every public servant should be
judged.
The President next devotes considerable
space to the relations of the United States
with foreign powers. These relations continue
to be friendly, there being no questions
of difficulty pending with any foreign
government. The refusal of the government
of Austro-Hungary to receive Mr.
Keileyas the envoy of the United States is
referred to, and the President says that in
the reasons assigned by that government
for declining to receive Mr. Keiley he
could not acquiesce without violation of his
oath of office and the precepts of the Constitution.
Mr. Keiley, however, has resigned
his commission, though as yet no
new nomination has been made, and the
interests of this government at Vienna are
now in the care of the Secretary of the
Legation.
A consideration of the Nicaraguan treaty
leads the President to reiterate emphatically
the familiar American doctrine that
we should not favor the acquisition of new
and distant territory, or the identification
of remote interest with our own. The engagements
proposed in the treaty combine
tm cdtttruction and operation of a transinteroceanic
canal, with an offensive and
defensive alliance for its protection. The
engagements proposed in the treaty combine
the construction and operation of a transJntomfflunif
pnn?l with an offensive and
lUVWiUVVUiiiv "?."J ?
defensive alliance for its protection. The
President holds that whatever highway is
to be constructed across the isthmus must
be for the world's benefit, and removed from
the chance of domination by any single power.
The President, therefore, contends that
the inter-oceanic transit should be neutralized,
which can only he accomplished by
making its use open to all nations, and
subject to the ambitious and warlike necessities
of none.
On the Chinese question the President refers
deprecatingly to the recent outbreaks
in Wyoming and Washington Territories,
and while, in his view, the Asiatics are not
desirable-as citizens, yet all the power of
the Government should be exerted to maintain
the amplest good faith toward China
in the treatment of these men, and the
inflexible sternness of the law in bringing
the wrong-doer^* to justice should be insisted
upon.
Discussing the revenue, the President
says: In a summary of the Treasury exhibit
it is shown that the ordinary receipts
from all sources for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1885, were ?322,690,700.38. Of this
sum ?181,471,939.34 was received from customs
and $112,498,725.54 from internal revenue.
The total receipts, as given above,
were $24,829,163.54 less than those for the
year ended June 30,1884. This diminution i
embraces the falling off of ?13,595,550.42 in
receipts from customs and ?9,687,346.97 in
receipts from internal revenue. The total
ordinary expenditures of the government
for the fiscal year were ?260,226,935.50, leaving
a surplus in the Treasury at the close of
the year of ?63,463,771.27. This is ?40,929,854.32
less than the surplus reported at the
close of the previous year.
The fact that our resources are in excess of
the actual needs of an economical administration
of the government justifies a reduction
in the amount exacted from the people
for its support. Our government is but the
means established by the will of a free people,
by which certain principles are applied
which they have adopted for their benefit
and protection, and it is never better administered,
and its true spirit is never better
administered than when the people's taxation
for its support is scrupulously limited
to the actual necessity of expenditure, and
distributed according to a just and equitable
plan.
One proposition with which we have to
deal is a reduction of the revenue received
by the general government, and paid by the
people from customs duties. The question
of free trade is not involved, nor is there
any occasion for a general discussion of the
wisdom or expediency of a protective system.
Justice and fairness dictate that in
any modification of out present laws relating
to the revenue, the industries and interest
which have been encouraged by such
laws, and in which our citizens have large
investments, should not be ruthlessly injured
or destroyed. We should also deal
with the subject in such a manner as to
protect the interests of American labor,
which is the capital of our workingmen.
Its stability and proper remuneration furnish
the most justifiable pretext for a protective
policy.
Within these limitations a certain reduction
should be made in our customs revenue.
The amount of such reduction having
been determined, inquiry follows, where
can it best be remitted and what articles
can best be released from duty in the interest
of our citizens. The President thinks
the reduction should be made in the reve
nue derived from tax upon the imported
necessaries of life, which would thus directly
lessen the cost of living in every family
in the land, and release to the people in
every humble home a large measure of the
rewards of frugal industry.
During the year ending November 1,
1885, one hundred and forty-five national
banks were organized with an aggregate
capital of $1G,93S,000 and circulating notes
have been issued to them amounting to 84274,910.
The whole number of these banks
in existence on the day above mentioned,
was 2,727.
The very limited amount of circulating
notes issued by our National banks compared
with the amount the law permits
them to issue, upon deposit of bonds for
their redemption indicates that the volume
of our circulating medium may be largely n
iucreased through this instrumentality. o
Discussing at length the subject of silver
coinage, the President says: Since Febru- tl
ary, 1875, the Government has, under com- o
pulsory provisions of the law, purchased e
silver bullion and coined the same at the c
rate of more than two million dollars every c
month. By this process up to the present o
date ?215,759,431 of silver dollars have been v
coined. si
A reasonable appreciation of the ''elega- p
tion of power, to the general Gove lment p
would limit its exercise, without express I
restrictive words, to the people's needs and r<
the requirementsol the public welfare. Up- tl
on this theory the authority to "coin money" b
given to Congress by the Constitution, if it si
permits the purchase by the government of a
bullion for coinage in any event, does not p
justify such purchase and coinage to an ex- ti
tent beyond the amount needed for a suffi- u
cient circulating medium. The desire to g
i utilize the silver product of the country
should not lead to the misuse or the per- ti
version of this power. el
Necessity for such an addition to the sil- d
[ ver currency of the nation as it is com pell- a
ed by the silver coinage act, is negatived P
by the fact that up to the present time only b
.about fifty millions of silver dollars so coined
have actually found their way into cir- tl
culation, leaving more than one hundred tl
and sixty-five million in possession of the fc
government, the custody of which has en- tl
tailed considerable expense for the construe- tl
tion of vaults for its deposit. Against this o
latter amount there are outstanding silver C
certificates amounting to about ninety- ci
three millions of dollars. si
Every month two millions of gold in the C
public treasury are paid out fortwo millions ci
or more of silver dollars, to be added to the tl
idle mass already accumulated. tl
If continued long enough this operation e
will result in the substitution of silver for p
all the gold the government owns applica- o
ble to its general purposes. It will not do si
to rely upon the custom receipts of the Gov- S
ernment to make good this drain of gold, n
because of the silver thus coined having ci
been made a legal tender for all debts a
and dues, public and private. At times ri
during the last six months f>8 per cent, tl
of the receipts for duties have been in silver r<
or silver certificates, while the average
within that period has been 20 per cent, d
The proportion of silver and its certificates tl
received by the Government will probably si
increase as time goes on, for the reason that a
the nearer the period approaches when it rr
will be obliged to offer silver in payment of fi
its obligations the greater the inducement o
will be to hoard gold against the deprecia- a
tion in the value of silver or for the purpose t(
of speculating. This hoarding of gold has w
already begun. d
When the time comes that gold has been s<
withdrawn from circulation then will heapparent
the difference between the real value d
of the silver dollar and the dollar in gold, 91
and the two coins will part company. Gold, 11
the standard of value, and necessary in our n
! dealine-s with other countries, will be at a
I premium over silver. The banks which
have substituted gold for the deposits of
their customers, may pay them with silver *>'
bought with such gold, thus making hand- tj
some profits. Rich speculators will sell
their hoarded gold to their neighbors who a>
need it to liquidate their foreign debts, ajt a
ruinous premium over silver, and the labor- |r
ing men and women of the land, the most
defenceless of all, will find that the dollar d
received for the wage of their toil has sadly .u
shrunk in its purchasing power. It may be J
said that the latter result will be but tempo- I]
rary and ultimately the price of labor will ci
be adjusted to the change. But even if this P
takes place the wage worker cannot possi- je
bly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the si
price he is compelled to pay for his living
will not only be measured in coin heavily d*
depreciated and fluctuating and uncertain
in its value, but this uncertainty in the value
of the purchasing medium will be made 1?
the pretext for an advance in prices beyond c?
that justified by the actual depreciation. &
It will not be disputed that any attempt M
on the part of the Government to cause the tl
circulation of silver dollars worth eighty
cents, side by side with gold dollars worth t'
one hundred cents, even within the limit ,r
that legislation does not run counter to v
laws of trade, to be successful must be sec- .
oned by the confidence of the people, that tj
both coins will retain the same purchasing tl
power and be interchangeable at will. A Sl
special effort has been made by the Secre- Ci
tary of the Treasury to increase the amount y
of our silver coin in circulation, but the b
fact that a large share of the limited u
amount thus put out has soon returned to P
the public treasury in payment of duties, sl
leads to the belief that the peopiedo not now b
desire to keep it in hand. And this, with 0
the evident disposition to hoard gold, gives a
rise to the suspicion that there already ex- 0
ists a lack of confidence among the people, .
touching our financial processes. There is 1(
certainly not enough silver now in circula- a
tion to cause uneasiness, and the whole a
amount coined and now on hand might, ?
after a time, be absorbed by the people
without apprehension; but it is the cease- r<
less stream that threatens to overflow the 11
land which causes fear and uncertainty. n
What has thus far been submitted upon "
this subject relates almost entirely to con- c<
siderations of a home nature?uncom ected n
with the bearing which the policies of other y
nations have upon the question. But it is d
perfectly apparent that the line of action in v
regard to our currency cannot wisely be a

sidering the attitude on that .subject of
other countries with whom we maintain n
intercourse through commerce, trade and ei
travel. h
Referring to the failure of the Monetary
Conference, and the fact that since the ad- 0
journment of the last Congress he has made
careful and earnest endeavors to give full 11
effect to the desire of Congress on this sub- ..
ject, the President continues: We have
now on hand all the silverdollars necessary
to supply the present needs of the people J!
and to satisfy those who, from sentiment *.!
wish to see them in circulation, and if their rj
coinage is suspended they can readily be
obtained by all who desire them, and if need a
of more is at any time apparent their coin- ?
age may be renewed. "
That disaster has not already overtaken *?
us furnishes no proof that danger does not n
wait upon a continuation of the present silver
coinage. We have been saved by most ?
careful management and unusual expedi- ?
ents by a combination of fortunate condi- rr
tions and by the confident expectation z
that the course of the Government in re- a
gard to silver coinage would be speedily a
changed by the action of Congress. ^
Prosperity hesitates upon our theshold v
because of the dangers and uncertainties s
surrounding this question. Capitalists tim- a
idly shrink from trade and investors are v
unwilling to take the chance of the ques- (i
tionable shape in which their money will be a
returned to them, while enterprise halts at p
the risk against which care and sagacious v
management do not protect. p
As a necessary consequence labor lacks r,
employment and suffering and distress are p
visited upon a portion of our fellow citi- g
zens especially entitled to the careful con- j.
sideration of those charged with the duties u
of legislation. No interest appeals to us so p
strongly for safe and stable currency as the r,
vast army of the unemployed. In con- j
eluding this subject, lie recommends trie v
suspension of compulsory coinage of silver c,
dollars directed by the law passed in February,
187S. tl
lleferring to the report of the Secretary ti
of War, the President says: Some of the f<
proceedings of courts martial which I have d
had occasion to examine show the present ii
ideas of justice which generally prevail in tl
these tribunals. I am satisfied they should n
be much reformed, if the honor and hones- a
ty of the army and navy are by their in- C
strumentality to be vindicated and protect- r
ed. He recommends that the signal service c
should have a separate establishment out- e
side of the war department, and also recommends
a general law of Congress pro- h
hibiting the construction of bridges over e
I
avigable waters in such manner as to 1
bstruct navigation.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy, j
he President says, gives a history of the
perations of his department and the presnt
condition of the work committed to his
harge. The Secretary details in full the
ourse pursued by him to protect the rights
f the government in respect of certain
essels unfinished at the time of his accesion
to office and also concerning the disatch
boat, Dolphin, claimed to be comleted
and awaiting the acceptance of the
)epartment. No one can fail to see from :
ecitals contained in this report that only
he application of business principles has
een insited upon in the treatment of these
ubjects and that whatever controversy has <
risen was caused by the exaction on the i
art of the Department of contract obligaions.
as thev were legally construed. He
rgently recommends a thoroughly reoranized
navy department.
The President approves the recoinmendaion
of the Postmaster-General that the
harge on domestic money orders of five
ollars or less, be reduced to five cents. He
lso approves the recommendation of the
'ostmaster-General, that another assistant
e provided for his department.
To facilitate the dispatch of business in
.le United States Courts, the President says
here seems to be an imperative necessity
)r remedial legislation, and recommends
he plan suggested by the Attorney-General,
he main features of which are: A transfer <
f all original jurisdiction of .the Circuit j
ourts to the District Courts, and an inrease
of judges for the latter where neces- i
iry; an addition of judges to the Circuit j
ourts and constituting them exclusively i
:>urts of appeal, and reasonably limiting i
he appeals thereto; further restrictions of i
he right to remove cases from State to Fed- i
ral Courts, permitting appeals to the Su- i
reme Court from the Courts of the District i
f Columbia and the Territories, only in the ]
tme cases as they are allowed from the i
tate Courts and guarding against an un- i
ecessary number of appeals from the C'iruit
Courts. He also thinks the marshals ]
nd district attorneys should be paid sala- i
ies, adjusted by a rule which would make i
tern commensurate with the service fairly i
Bndered. <
After discussing at some length the In- <
ian question as presented in the report of 1
le Secretary of the Interior, the President <
lys: I recommend the passage of a law j
uthorizing the appointment of six com- i
lissioners, three of whom shall be detailed I
om the army, to be charged with the duty ]
f careful inspection, from time to time, of <
II Indians upon our reservations, or subject j
) the care or control of the Government, <
nth a view of discovering their exact con- i
ition and needs, and determining what 1
:eps shall be taken on behalf of the Gov- i
rnment to improve their situation in the
irection of their self-support and complete i
ivilization, that they ascertain from such <
ispection what, if any, of the reservations i
lay be reduced in area, and in such cases I
'hat part, not needed for Indian occupa- ]
on, may be purchased by the Government i
T 11 y v 9 . r / ? iL a!M
om tne inciians anu disposed 01 iur men i
enefit; what, if any, Indians may, with ]
leir consent, be removed to other reserva- ]
ons, with the view of their concentration j
nd sale on their behalf, of their abandoned i
?servations; what Indian lands now held i
1 common should be allotted in severalty;
1 what manner and to what extent the In- i
ians upon the reservations can be placed <
nder the protection of our laws and sub- <
icted to their penalties, and which, if any
adians should be invested with the right of <
tizenship. The powers and functions of <
le commissioners in regard to these sub- ]
:cts should be clearly defined, though they j
lould, in conjunction with the Secretary of
le Interior, be given all authority to deal i
efinitely with the questions presented, i
eemed safe and consistent. i
The complicated condition of the public j
md laws is set forth, and the President i <
ills attention to the recommendation of the I
ecretarv of the Interior with reference to 11
le repeal and modification of certain of J <
icse laws.
The cleansing of the pension rolls of names 1
nit have been placed thereon by fraudulent
jeans,and other reforms in the pension ser- ,
ice are recommended.
The President discusses the Mormon queson
as follows: In the Territory of Utah :
le law of the United States passed for the j
jppression of polygamy has been energeti- j
illy and faithfully executed during the past
ear with measurably good results. A num- ;
er of convictions have been secured for
nlawful cohabitation, and in some cases
leas of guilty have been entered and a
light punishment imposed upon a promise j
y the accused that they would not again ;
fiend against the law nor advise, counsel, ';
id or abet in any way its violation by ,
thers.
The Utah commissioners express the opinio,
based upon such information as they
re able to obtain, that but few polygamous
carriages have taken place in the Territory
uring the last year. They further report
lat, while there cannot be' found upon the
?gistration lists of voters the name of a h
lan actually guilty of polygamy, and while !
one of that class are holding ottice, yet at!
le last election in the Territory all the offi- (
?rs elected, except in one county, were
len, who, though not actually living in \
le practice of polygamy, subscribe to the '
octrineof polygamous marriages as a Pi-! i
ine revelation and a law all the higher j
nd more binding upon the conscience than i
ny human law, local or national. Thus is '
le strange specuicie presemeu 01 n ronimu- :
ity protected by a Republican form of Gov- <
rnment to which they owe allegiance sus-: ;
lining by their suffrages a principle and a j j
elief which sets at naught that obligation j <
f absolute obedience to the law of the land |
hich lies at the foundation of Republican ]
istitutions. I j
The strength, the perpetuity and the des-: ]
ny of the nation rest upon our homes, es-11
iblished by the law of God, guarded by j
arental care, regulated by parental'au- (
lority and sanctified by parental love. 11
'hese are not the homes of polygamy. .
'he mothersof our land who rule the nation, ?
s they mould the characters and guide the i
ctions of their sons, live according to God's
oly ordinances, and each, secure and hap- i
y in the exclusive love of the father of her i
hildren, sheds the warm light of true wolanhood
unperverted and uiipolluted upon (
11 within her pure and wholesome family
ircle. These are not the cheerless, crushed
nd unwomanly mothers of polygamy,
'he fathers of our families are the best citi- j!
ens of the Republic. Wife and children (
re the sources of patriotism and conjugal
nd parental affection beget devotion to ^
he country. The man who, undefiled !
;ith plural marriage, is surrounded in his
ingle home with his wife and children, has !
stake in the country which inspires him
?'ith respect for its laws and courage for its '
efence. These are not the fathers of polygmous
families. There is no feature of this
ractice, or the system which sanctions it, !
rhich is not opposed to all that is of value J
ri our institutions. There should be no ; i
elaxation in the firm but just execution of
he law now in operation, and I should be I
lad to approve such further discreet legisition
as will rid the country of this blot
pon its fair fame. Since the people up- !
olding polygamy in our Territories are 1
einforced by immigration from other lands, 1
recommend that a law be passed to pre- '
ent the importation of Mormons into the
ountry.
The agricultural interests of the country, I
he President says, demand just recogniion
an liberal encouragement. Legislation i
>rthe protection of our live stock against j I
isease is recommended. If the laws now I
ii operation are insufficient to accomplish
his protection he recommends their amend- s
nent to meet the necessities of the situation, j
nd commends to the consideration of ii
longress the suggestions contained in the
eport of the Commissioner of Agriculture j'
alculated to increase the value and effici- |
ncy of this department. !
The subject of civil service is treated at I
rngth, and the President says he is inclin- <
d to think there is no sentiment more gen- i
eral in the minds of the people of our countr;
than a conviction of the correctness of th
principle upon which the law enforcing civ
il service reform is based. He says the pec
pie may well trust the Civil Service Com
mission to execute the law with fairness
and he ventures to hope that we shall neve
again be remitted to a system which dis
tributes positions purely as a reward fo
partisan services. The allurements of ai
immense number of offices and placesexhibi
ted to the voters of the land, and the promis
of their bestowal in recognition of parti
san activity debauch suffrage and rob po
litical action of its thoughtful and delibera
tive character. The evil would increas
with the multiplication of offices const5
rjuent upon our extension and a mania fo
office holding growing from its indulgenc
would pervade our population so generall;
that patriotic purpose, the suppoit of priii
ciple, the desire for the public good and sc
licitude for the nation's welfare, would b
nearly uanisneu .arum me ui-nvit.v ui uu
party contests, and cause them to degener
ate into ignoble, selfish and disgracefu
struggles for positions of office and publi
place. Civil service reform enforced hi
law came none too soon to check the prog
ress of demoralisation. One of its effect
not enough regarded as the freedom i
brings to the political action of theseconser
vative and sober minded men who in the fea
of confusion and risk attending an arbitrary
and sudden change in all public offices witi
change of party rule, cast their ballot
against such change. Parties seem to bi
necessary and will long continue to exist
nor can it be now denied that there are le
estimate advantages not disconnected witl
office holding which follow party suprema
cy. While partisanship continues bitte
and pronounced, and supplies so much o
the motives of sentiment and action it i
not fair to hold public officials, in charge o
important trusts, responsible for the bes
results in the performance of their duties
and yet you insist that they shall rely ii
confidential and important places upon th<
work of those not only opposed to them ii
political affirmation, but so steeped in par
tisan prejudice and rancor that they havi
no loyalty to their chiefs and no desire fo
their success. Civil service reform does no
exact this, nor does it require that those ii
subordinate positions who fail in yieldinj
their best service, or who are incompeten
should be retained simply because they ar<
in place. The whining of a clerk discharg
ed for indolence or incompetency who
though he gained his place by the wors
possible operations of the spoils system
suddenly discovers that he is entitled t(
protection under the sanction of the civi
service reform, represents an idea no les
ibsurd than the clamor of the applican
who claimsa vacant position as hiscompen
nuncti/miihla norKr ivnrL'
StlllUlJ 1UI Ilia iiiu^i ^utonuiiin/iv |?u? ij ff ?
The civil service law does not preven
the discharge of an indolent or incoinpeteh
clerk, but it does prevent supplying hi
place with an unfit party worker. Thus ii
both these phases is seen the benefit of thi
public service, and the people who desir
jood government, having secured this stat
ute, will not relinquish its benefits withou
protest. Nor are they unmindful of tin
fact that its full advantages can only bi
gained through the complete good faith o
those having its execution -in charge, am
this they will insist upon.
The present condition of the law relating
to the succession of the Presidency in tin
event of the death, disability, or reinova
af both President and Vice-President, thi
President says is such as to require imme
liateamendment. This subject has repeat
cdly been considered by Congress, but n<
result has been reached. The recent lament
able death of the Vice-President, and tin
vacancies at the same time in all other of
fices, the incumbents of which might imme
diately exercise the functions of Presiden
tial office, has'caused public anxiety and i
just demand that the reoccurrence of such i
condition of affairs should not be permitted
In conclusion the President says: I com
mend to the care and thoughtful attentioi
of Congress, the needs, welfare and aspira
tionsof an intelligent and generous nation
To subordinate these to the narrow ad van
tagesof partisanship, or the accomplish men
of selfish aims, is to violate the people'
trust and betray the people's interests, bu
in an individual sense of responsibility oi
the part of each of us, and the stern de
termination to perform our duty well, mus
give us place among those who have addei
in their day and generation to the glor;
and prosperity of our beloved land.

Keep Out op Debt,?Debt and interes
are two things that keep many noses to th
grindstones. One of the principal causes c
debt is extravagance; the Americans as
people are noted for living beyond thei
means; pay day is assure to corneas th
tax collector, and when it comes the debto
is unprepared and a panic ensues. \V

how general the habit of extravagance i
till a crash like that of 1873 comes on th
country. These crashes are sharp peremp

complied with, and the bankruptcies ant
breakups in every community that follov

times it is easy to get credit and the resul
is many live beyond their means and sorm
make use of credit to secure a show o
wealth, mortgage property which they d<

swallow up a large portion of their income
Debts are inexorable and sooner or late
have to be paid, either during life, or b;
selling the unfortunate debtor's mortgage<
property, thus stripping him and his fami
iy of all their imagined wealth, and leav
ing them destitute. There is no class o
persons who can less afford to go into deb
than farmers?and this because, when one
in debt, they rarely get out. In man;
counties in Missouri, says the Republican
the American farmers are being gradual!;
superseded by Germans?and the process i
so complete as to have entirely transforme<
the community from what it was twent;
years ago. The explanation is simple
Germans do not go in debt or live beyoni
their means, but they buy the farms o
Americans who do. The moral Is, keep ou
[)f debt.
Editorship.?Some people estimate tlv
ability of a periodical and the talent of it
editor by the quantity of its original matter
It is comparatively an easy task for a froth;
writer to string out a column of words upoi
any and all subjects. His ideas may flov
in one weak, washy, everlasting flood, am
the command of his language may enabl
him to string them together like bunches c
onions, and yet his paper may be but :
meagre and poor concern. Indeed the mer
writing part of editing a paper is but a smal
portion of the work. The care, the tinn
employed in selecting, isfarmoreimportant
and the fact of a good editor is better showi
by his selections than anything else; am
that, we know, is half the battle. But as w<
have said, an editor ought to be estimated
his labor understood and appreciated, b;
the general conduct of his paper?its tone
its uniform, consistent course, aims, manli
ness, dignity, and its propriety.?Courier

WILLIAM II. VANDERBILT,
8
r t
y The Richest Man in The "World. 1
1 William H. Vanderbilt dropped dead at
s his home on Fifth avenue, New York, ai 3 v
B o'clock on the afternoon of the 8th instant, *j
' of paralysis of the brain. On the morning
" of that day, and up to 2 o'clock in the after1
noon, he was apparently in perfect health i.
" and spirits. Between 1 and 2 o'clock, Rob- ''
ert Garrett, President of the Baltimore and r
1 Ohio Railroad Company, called to confer ^
? with Mr. Vanderbilt, and remained a con- J]
' siderable time. While Mr. Vanderbilt was
' talking Garrett sat on a sofa and faced the !]
'? millionaire, who leaned forward in his arm 1
1 chair, as was his habit when thoroughly in- 11
e terested. The President of the Baltimore ?
1 and Ohio Railroad Company was suddenly 11
made aware of a slight indistinctness in j|
5 Vanderbilt's speech, that grew into an inar- '<
J ticulate sound. As Garrett leaned over to 3
1 catch his words, Vanderbilt pitched forward *
1 without word or warning, and fell heavily !*
=> to the floor on his face. Garrett sprang to 1
1 his feet with an exclamation of alarm, and 'J
2 seizing a pillow from the sofa, laid it under r
his friend's head, then summoned Mrs. 11
' Vanderbilt and George, the youngest son. $
1 Messengers were sent for physicians. One a
' from the neighborhood responded first, and 1
2 was followed almost immediately by the a
1 family doctor, James W. McLean. Such y
3 simplerestorativesaswereat hand had been j1
1 hurriedly applied, but human aid was use- j(
less. Vanderbilt never spoke or moved af- ;
ter he fell, and died in a few minutes, with- a
out a struggle. To all intents and purposes v
1 he was dead the instant he fell forward on s
3 the floor. Dr. McLean pronounced his ?
1 death the result of a sudden attack of paral- J.
5 ysis, due to the bursting of a large blood .J
e vessel at the base of the brain, and stated 11
7 that his death was as painless as it was sud1
den. The doctor knew his patient most in- 3
2 timately, and promptly certified to the cause 11
2 of his death to avoid the unnecessary form- ^
j ality of a coroner's inquest and an autopsy. s
' Mr. Vanderbilt was 07 years of age. v
The funeral took place on Friday last, at 2
? 10 o'clock from St. Bartholomew's church, ^
2 of which Itev. Dr. Cook is pastor. Vander- J
1 bilt was a vestryman in that church, to the L
2 construction of which he contributed large- \
ly. Thesexton of the church was charged e
" with the funeral arrangements. At Van- J1
0 derbilt'sown desire he was interred in the 1
family mausoleum in Moravian Cemetery a
? at Newdrop, Staten Island, which has just ^
been completed. It was one of the last acts {;
" of his life to turn over by deed for one dol- 1
" lar in hand, paid of good and lawful money, ^
a all the old farm property on Staten Island,
a to his youngest son, George, to do with as he ?
desired, and for this purpose the father and
son went over to the island together on Sat- '
1 urday preceding his death, incidentally in- 1
" speeding the also just completed mausoleum. c
His wealth is generally estimated at
7 $200,000,001), and his annual income at $10,
1 000,000. Of his wealth he inherited about
? $75,000,000 from his father, Commodore Cor1
nelius Vanderhilt, which he more than
n doubled in the course of his life, and his income
has been reckoned at $1'J.75 per miu;[
ute or over $28,000 a day.
1 Fifty of Mr. Vanderbilt's millions are said
y to he invested in United States four per
cents., and the checks which he received for
interest were larger than those paid to any
other of Uncle Sam's creditors. He recent,
ly gave $500,000 to the College of Physicians
and Surgeons at New York. In his splendid
brown stone house on Fifth avenue,
almost opposite to St. Patrick's Cathedal,
a are many pictures by the foremost of living
r artists. He had given over $100,000 to
e Vanderhilt University at Nashville, and
r had some time since resigned active control
e of his New York Central and Hudson River
f' and Lake Shore a.id Michigan Central rails
roads, which his father had operated before
e him.
At the time of his death Mr. Vanderhilt
y was engaged upon two missions which were
? dear to his heart. One was to keep shop.
keepers out of Fifth avenue, which he fear1
ed would destroy the beauty and disturb
? the quiet of that fashionable thoroughfare.
? The residents of Fifth avenue are fast scattert
ing into the side streets. Vanderbiltdid not V
p wish either to move or to be surrounded by
' traffic. He thought that the impending *
0 annoyance could be deferred, if not averted, ,
1 by defeating the scheme for a street rail- ?
' road. To that end he has devised a stage V
r line to supply residents with handy transit r!
y and make them content without rails. He
1 was giving his personal attention to this ^
" matter, and to all intents and purposes had ^
" become a champion ofstage-coachingagainst ,
; railroading.
' Curious to relate his other hobby was his a
^ tomb on Staten Island, above referred to, j
y which was being built and which he visited fl
' every day. The mortuary structure was

SITTING IT FOR HER ROY. |J
Here and there throughout the village a 1
^ few lights flicker like pale stars through the | <i
. darkness. One shines from.an attic win- a
* dow, where a youthful aspirant for literary t
' honors labors, wasting the midnight oil and t
jj elixer of his life in toil, useless it may be, [ c
I save as patience and industry are gained, tl
p and give him a hope 011 eternal happiness. J a

I* a chamber in which death is entering and j a
life departing. One light shines through j d
? a low cottage window, from which the cur- | <]
tains are pushed partially aside, show-j (
ing a mother's face, patient and sweet, \ j<
' but careworn and anxious. The eyes, gaz- j
] ing through the night, faded and sunken,
but lightened with such as steals only j i:
e into the eyes of true and saintly moth-j t
J ers, who watch over and pray for their j a
f children; who hedge them in from the s
' world's temptations, and make them noble n
tnoti ?.mri trim Inviny women. Jt is nearly 1 0
midnight, and the faded eyes are strained a
to the utmost to catch the far-off sight of e
some one coming down the street. The j
- mother's listening ear loses no sound, how- i:
y ever light, that breaks upon the stillness o
t that reigns around. t
J No form seen, no quick step heard, she d
? drops the curtain slowly, and goes back 1'
; to the table, where an open book is lying, n
- and a half-knit sock. The cat jumps up in t
i- her chair, and yawns and shakes herself, s
t and gradually sinks down again in repose, f
t No one disputes her possession of the easy- v
i. chair. Up and down the little room the e
- mother walks, trying to knit, but vainly; p
t she can only think, and wonder, and im- t
e agine what is keeping him. Her mind n
e pictures the worst, and the heart sinks low- c
/ er and lower. Could the thoughtless boy fi
hoy know hut one half the anguish he is c
ausing he would hasten at once to dispel it
vith her presence.
She trembles now as she listens, for an
incertain step is heard?a sound of coarse
aughter and drunken ribaldry; her heart
tands still and she grows cold with appreiension.
The sound passes. Thank heavn
it is not he, and a glow comes over
ler, and once more her heart beats quick.
Only a moment, for the clock on the
nantel shows on its palid face it is nearly
nidnight. Again the curtain is drawn
side, and again loving eyes peer into the
larkncss. Ilark ! a sound of footsteps comng
nearer; a shadowy form advancing

IANIEL WEBSTEIt'S KROTH ER-IN-LAW.
The terror of Daniel Webster's boyhood
yas his brother-in-law, John Colby. This
nan Colby was notoriously wicked. He
lid not learn to read until he was 80 years
Id. At the age of So he was converted.
U this time Webster had not seen him for
orty years, but when he heard the news he
ode over to talk with him. Old Colby was
;lad to see his visitor and congratulated
iim upon his success in life. Then he said :
lYou are a great man ; are you a Christian
nan ? That is the only question worth askngor
answering." To this the great statesnan
replied with all the earnestness he
iTas capable. He said: "John Colby, you
lave asked me a very important question,
nd one whicli should not be answered lighty.
I intend to give you a truthful anwer.
I hope I am a Christian; I profess
o be one, but I say it with shame, and I
m not such a C'hristion as I desire to be. I
lave lived in the world surrounded by its
mnnri nnrl it? tomntntinns. and I am afraid I
ohn Colby, that I am not so pood a Christan
as I ought to be. I am afraid I have not
our faith and your hopes, but still I hope
nd trust that I am a Christian, and that
he same grace which has converted you
nd made you an heir of salvation will
lo the same for me. I trust it; and I
lso trust, John Colby?and it won't be
ung before our summons will come?
hat we shall meet in a better world,
nd meet those who have gone before us,
k'hom we knew, and who trusted in the
ame divine grace. It won't be long. You
annot tell, John Colby, how much delight
t gave me to hear of your conversion,
'he hearing of that is what brought me
lere to-day. I came here to see with my
wneyes, and hear with my own ears the
tory from a man whom I know and reuember
so well. What a wicked man you
ised to be." When he left, Mr. Webster
aid to a friend who witnessed the interiew:
"I should like to know what the
nemies of religion would lay to John Col y's
conversion. There was a man as unikely,
humanely speaking, to become a
Christian as any man I ever saw. He was
eckless, heedless, impious; never experincing
the good influence of associating
nth religious people. Here he has been
iving in a reckless way till he has got to be
n old man ; until a period of life when you
laturally would not expect his habits to
hange; and yet he is brought into the conlition
in which we have seen him to-day?
, penitent, trusting, humble believer.
Whatever people may say, nothing," addd
Mr. Webster, "can convince me that
mything short of the grace of Almighty
lod could make such a change as I, with
ny own eyes, have witnessed in the life
>f John Colby."
CHRISTIANA,
Ex-Queen of Spain.
Christiana, the relict of Alfonso, King of
>pain was the second wife of that monarch,
lis first wife, Mercedes, died within a year
.fter their marriage and was much lamentd.
The second marriage which occurred on
November 29th, 1879, was a political union.
Christiana is the daughter of the late Archluke,
Charles Ferdinand, of Austria. She
vas born July 21st, 1858. During her short
narried life many stirring incidents have
ccurred. On December 20th, 1879, whilst
Iriving in an open carriage with the king,
, youth named Otero, fired two pistol shots
t the royal pair, one passing between them
nd the other through an attendant's hat,
>ut fortunately without doing further damge.
Otero was tried, sentenced to death
nd executed for the crime. Queen Chrisiana
gave birth to two daughters?Maria
le la Mercedes, Princess of the Asturias,
torn September 12th, 1880, and Infanta
Jaria Teresa Isabel, born November 12th,
882. The former of these, now but five
ears of age, becomes the Queen of Spain.
Christiana is to be made ltegent. The
narried life of the royal pair was not
lways the pleasantest, and Alfonso, folowing
the example of his mother and
frand-mother, was noted for his many love
iflairs. Matters grew so serious that at one
ime a rupture with his Queen seemed imninent
and was avoided only by the friends
if the couple, who saw in a separation the i
11 rest consequences. The Queen was given |

Woktii Knowing.?A writer in theLousville
Post says: Few people know how
o dress a fowl after killing it. Birds ducks,
nd turkeys are usually dipped in hot water,
o their feathers may be more easily renoved.
These feathers contain unsavory
il and they penetrate the skin. As soon
s the hot water acts upon the oil it is drivn
through the porous tip of the feather and j
nfused under the skin. For this reason it!
s very difficult to secure a dressed chicken
r other bird in the market that does not
aste feathery after cooking. They are
Iressed hastily and to save time and troubb
are soused in hot water. The bird is alnost
worthless to the delicate palate after
hat. Every member of the feathery tribe
hould be picked carefully while cold, care
lly cleaned and allowed to remain in salty
rater for twelve hours. The salt draws the
xcess of blood from the body. When
iroperly cooked after this process they have
he delicious taste which persons enjoy so
nuch at "country dinners" and which they
annot explain. It is simply due to the
ict that the country cook is usually more
onscienoiotis and better trained.
BILL NYE ON THE HERSCHELS.
Hudson, Wis., Xov. 18.?Probably no
two men have done more to promote knowledge
and advance the interests of astronomy
especially, than Sir John Frederick
William Herschel and Sir William Herschel
deceased.
Sir John was born at Slough, near Windsor,
in the state of England, March 7, 1792.
He breathed the very air of science at once
and yearned to acquire knowledge. Thus
he fitted himself for the fatiguing and exhausting
labors of scanning the sky and
tracing out the history, location and habits
of the stars.
In 1828 his attention was attracted toward
Margaret Brodie, the daughter of the Rev.
I)r. Alexander Stewart. It was about this
time that he began to sit up nights and
rummage the heavens. He never got
over it.
In 1829 he married Margaret, but he still
coutinued to sit up nights, and nothing
tickled him more than to ramble through
iL- A - i i. -i.L .i ? .:
int? iracKicss vuju iu wuicu mu an uua u; ma
nebuhe, or to follow a skittish comet
through space trying to put salt on its little
tail.
In 1834 he began the stupendous task of
getting out a catalogue and price list of all
the stars. No one who has never tried it
can possibly realize fully the extent of this
task. Not only that, but the most of it had
to be done at night. And yet he never
murmured.
Pie catalogued between three and four
thousand double stars, and also passed in
review the nebuhe discovered and catalogued
by his father. While others slept he
labored on. While the giddy throng poured
into the halls of pleasure, or sought out the
lawn sociable, Sir John, with his fortyfoot
telescope and a ten-foo.t pole over his
shoulder, would start out to investigate the
trackless void. Thus he became familiar
with the mannersand customs of the planets,
and felt perfectly at home in the sky. He
knew at a glance whether a planet was wobbly
or not. Pie could at once detect it if an
orb got sprung. He had it down fine. No
one dared adulterate the milky way while
Sir John had charge of the stars.
In 1847 he published the result of his observations
from the Cape of Good Hope,
covering the four years from 1834 to 1838.
These were: I. Nebula, and what to do
for them. II. Double stars and their habits.
III. Apparent size of stars, or how
they look to a man up a tree. IV. Distribution
of stars, or why early astronomers
soured on the milky way. V. Halley's celebrated
comet, with appendix treating of
bob-tail comets; also hints about shying
comets, and how to evade a new laid meteor.

and how to remove them without injury to
the sun.
There is one thing that the Herschels
neglected, and I would like to call the attention
of philanthropists and astronomers
to it. I am a philanthropist myself, but I
have not been successful in that line, owing
to a lack of means. So I wish that those
who want to do a kind act, and have the
ability as well as the desire, would investigate
the case of the gentleman who general
ly stands in the middle of the zodiac on the
first page of the almanac. We are likely to
have a long, cold winter very soon, and no
man ought to die from exposure in an enlightened
lahd where the rest of us have
all the clothes we need. Besides, this man
seems to be seriously injured, and, though
I am not at all familiar with surgery, it
seems to me that he ought to be sewed up ;
ought to wear a vest, anyway, if he wants
to preserve his health. Who will be the
first to send i n a vest ?? Chicago Daily News.
The Quarrel of Blaine and Conkling.?The
feud between Blaine and Conkling
originated when they were members
of the House, and it was first manifest in
May, 18GG, when the Representative from
Maine arraigned the Representative from
New York for having received money from
the War Department for legal services,
while he was drawing his salary as a member
of Congress.
Mr. Conkling said if the member from
Maine had the least idea how profoundly
indifferent to him his opinion was on the
subject he had been discussing, or on any
other subject, he thought he would hardly
take the trouble to express it. He apologised
to the House for the length of time he
had occupied, in consequence of being drawn
into the matter by an interruption which
he had before denounced to be ungentlemanly
and impertinent, and having nothing
whatever to do with the matter.
Mr. Blaine said that he knew that this
was what they called down East "running
emptyings." The gentleman from New
York could not get off on the technical pretense
that he did not hold an office as judge
advocate. Many an officer had led a brigade,
a division or a corps, with no more of
a commission than such a one as the gentleman
from New York held. "As to the
gentleman's cruel sarcasm (Mr. Blaine continued),
I hope he will let me escape his
disdain. His lordly pomposity, grandiloquent
swell, his majestic overtowering, his
turkey-gobblerstrutting, have beenso crushing
to myself and to all members of the
House, that I know it was an act of the
grossest temerity on my part to venture on
provoking them. But I knew who was responsible
for it all. I knew that for the
last five weeks an extra strut had seized the
gentleman. It is not his fault; it is the
fault of another; that gifted and satirical
man, Theodore Tilton, of the New York
Independent, who was here spending some
weeks, and writing home letters in which,
among some serious things, he had putsome
jocose things, among the cruelestof which
was that the mantle of the late Winter

New York. He (Conkling) took it as serious,
and has since strutted more than usual.
Well; the resemblance was great; as
striking as Hyperion to a satyr, Thersytes
to Hercules, mud to marble, a dunghill to a
diamond, a singed cat to a Bengal tiger, a
whining puppy to a roaring lion. Shade of
the mighty Davis, forgive the prolanation
of even that jocose satire."?Ben. Perley
Poore, in Boston Budget.
Apples.?Prof. D. C. Eaton, of Yale College,
in a paper on "Apples," read recently
before the Scientific Society of Bridgeport,
says: "The first positive scientific
demonstration of the existence of apple
trees was in the disclosure, made through
a condition of the water, that apple tree
trunks formed part of the foundations of
the habitations of the lake dwellers of
Switzerland. This period, as nearly as
could be judged, was from 1,200 to 2,000
years before Christ. That the apple with
which Eve was tempted in the Garden of
Eden, according to the Scripture, is the apple
of to-day is uncertain, inasmuch as the
word anciently applied to the apple included
the quince and pear. Consequently Eve
might have been tempted by eitner of these
latter fruits. The present apple was due to
the cultivation and development of the
crab-apple, and the peculiarity of the apple
in its evolution is that the part now valuable
was simply the calix, thickened and become
fleshy, which had formed around the
original fruit or seeds. There are now
about 900 varieties of apples, classified under
not less than 3,000 names."
Fast Eating.?By eating fast the stom- ach,likea
bottle being filled through a funnel,
is full and overflowing before we know
it. But the most important reason is the
food is swallowed before time has been allowed
to divide it in sufficiently small pieces
with the teeth; for, like ice'in a tumbler
of water, the smaller the bits are, the sooner
they are dissolved. It has been seen
with the naked eye, that if solid food is
cut in pieces small as a half pea it digests
almost as soon, without being chewed at all,
? n. Tha
ns 11 it Him ut:uu ?en niaouviiwvii AMV
best plan therefore, is for all persons to thus
comminute their food; for even if it is well
chewed the comminution is no injury, while
it is of very great importance in case of
hurry, forgetfulness or bad teeth. Cheerful
conversation prevents rapid eating.?Journal
