This Country Should Kemaln Xeatral,
To the Congress of thu United States:
The present a?sembla-?e of tho legislative
branch of our Government occurs nt a time
when the interests of our people and the
needs of the eonn'.ry give especial promi?
nence to the condition of our foreign relations
nnd Ihe exigencies of our National finance?.
The reports of tho heads of the several ad?
ministrative departments of the Government
fully and plainly exhibit what has been ac?
complished within the scope of their respec?
tive duties, and present such recommenda?
tions for tho betterment of our country's
condition as patriotic and intelligent labor
?nd observation suggest.
I therefore deem my executive duty ade?
quately performed at "this time by present?
ing to the Congress the important phases of
our-situa'ion ns related to our intercourse
with foreign Nation?, and a statement of the
financial problems which confront us, omit?
ting, except as they are related to these top?
ics, any preference to departmental opera?
tions.
By amen latory tari ff legislation in January
last, the Argentine Republic, recognizing tho
value of the large market oponed to tbo frea
importation of Ita wools under our hist tariff
act, has admitted certain products of the
United States-to entry at reduced duties. It
is pleasing to note that the efforts we have
made to enlarge the exchanges of trade ou u
Sound basis of mutual benefit are in this
instance appreciated by the country from
which our woolen factories draw their naed
ful supply of raw material.
The close ol the momentous struggle be?
tween China and Japan, while relieving the
diplomatic agents of ihis Government fron
tbe delicate duty they uudertook at the re?
quest of both couulries, of rendering such
servi-c'Bto the subjects of either'belligerent
within the territorial limits of the other as
our neutral position permitted, developed
a domestic condition in the Chinese
Empire which has cairs*! much anx?
iety and called for prompt ani careful
attention. Eitlier as :; result of a weak
control by the oantrjl Government
over the provincial a.lmiu!s:r.-itions, follow*
ing a diminution of traditional government?
al authority under tha stress of an over
?~"?**rhelmin? National disaster, or us a mani
legation upon good opportunity of thc
aversion of the Chinese population to all
fore'igu ways and uudertakiugs, there have
occurred in wi-IHy s"narated provinces ol
China serious outbreaks of the old fanatical
Spirit against fo'reitenors, which, uncheck*.* 1
by the local authorities, if not actually con?
nived at by them, have culminated in mot
attacks on foreign missionary stations, caus?
ing much destruction of property, and at
ended with personal injuries as well ,13 los;
flife.
THE CHIXESE MASSACRE.
Although but vone American citizen wa"
reported to have beeu actually wounded,
and although the de-truetioa of proper!)
may have fallen more heavily upon the mis?
sionaries ot other Nationalities than our own
it plainly behooved this Government to take
the'most prompt anddecided actiouo guard
against similar or perhaps ni >rj dreatfu
calamities befalling the hundreds of Ameri?
can mission stations which hav*
Srown up throughout the interioi
of China, under the temperate
rule of toleration, custom and imperia
edict. The demauds of the Unite 1 State:
?tai other Powers for thi da.*r 1 Litton and
punishment of the responsible ofdcials of tht
respective cities and provinces who, b;j
neglect or otherwise, hal permitted unris
Ings, and for the adoption of stern measure*
by the Emperor's Government for the pro?
tection of the life and property of forei^aers
were followed by the disgrace and dismissal
of certain provincial officials found derelict
in duty, and the punishment by tloath of f
number of those adjudge! guilty of a.-tua
participation in the outrages.
This Government also insisted that f
special American commission should visi
the province where the first disturbances oe
curred, for the purpose of investigation. Thi:
lalter CommissioD, formed after much op
position, has gone overland from Tientsin
accompanied by a suitable Chinese escort
and by its demonstration, of the rendines
?ind ability of our Government tc protect iti
dtizens will act, it is believed, as a most in
luential deterrent of any similar outbreaks
THE WsXMslsKn CASS.
The customary cordial relations betweei
this country and Fraase hive. bael undis?
turbed, with the ex;eptiou that a full ex
Elanatlon of ihe th 1 treatment ol! John
. Waller by the expeditionary mil
ltary authoiiti93 of formerly United
8tate3 Consul at Tamatave, Franc;
still ramalns to bc givjn. Mi-. Willer,
remained in Madagascar after his torn ol
office expired, and was apparently successful
In procuring business concessions from thu
Hovas of greater or less value. After the occu?
pation of Tamatava and the declaration oi
martial law by the French, he was arrested
upon various charges, among them that 0
communicating military information to th*
enemies of France, was tried and' convicted
by a military tribunal, ani sentenced tc
twenty years' imprisonment.
Following the course justified by nbuudam
precedents, this Government requested fron:
that of France the record of the proceeding
of the French tribunal which resulted in Mi,
Waller's condemnation. This request hal
been complied with to th3 extent of supply
? ing a copy of tho official record, from whicl
appear the constitution and organization o
the court, the charges as formulated, an.'
the general course an I result of the trial,
and by which it is shown that tho accuse*.
was tried in open court and was defends 1 bj
counsel. But the evidence adduced in sup
port of the charges?which, was not re?
ceived by the French Minister of For
eign Affairs till the first week in Ootober
ha3 thus far been withhel). the French Gov?
ernment taking the ground that its produc
tion in response to our demand would estab?
lish a bad precedent. The efforts of 0111
Ambassador to procure it, however, thougl
impeded by recent changes in the Frencrj
Ministrv, have not bean relaxed, and it i:
confidently expected that some satisfactory
solution of the matter will shortly be reached.
Meanwhile it appears that Mr. Waller's con?
finement has every alleviation which thi
state of his health nnd all the othor cireum
stances of the case demand or permit.
BLOWS AT OUR TRADE.
Our relation with the States of the Garmai
Empire are. in some aspects, typical of a
condition of thing3 elsewhere found in coun?
tries whose productions and trade are simi
lar to our own. The close rivalries cf com
peting industriep, the influence of the delu?
sive doctrine that the internal developmenl
of a Nation is promoted audits wea.th in?
creased by a policy which in undertaking tc
reserve its home markets for the exclusive
tse ol Its own producers necessarily ob
L K
L
structs their sales In foreign markets
and prevents ffee access to the
products Of the World, the desire
to retain trade in time-worn ruts, regard?
less of the inexorable laws of new needs and
changed conditions of demand and siipply,
and our own halting tftrdine3s in inviting a
freer exchange of ommodities, and by this
means imperilling our footing in the exter?
nal markets naturally open to us-, havo ere-*
ate! a situation somewhat injurious to
American export interests* hot only itt Ger-*
roany, where they are perhaps most hoticea*
ble, but in adjacent countries.
These considerations should not( however,
constrain Hs to submit to unfair discrimina?
tion nor to silently acquiesce in vexatious
hindrances to the enjoyment of our share of
the legitima'e advantages of proper
trade relations. If aa examination of
the situation surests rash measures
on our part as would involve restric?
tions similar to thoso from which wo suf?
fer, the way to such a course is easy,
lt should, however, by no means ba
lightly entered upon, since the necessity for
the inauguration of such a policy would be
regretted by tho best sentiment of our peo
p'.e, and because it naturally and logically
might lead to consequences of the gravest
character.
DS8TR0T1X0 THE SEALS.
Our relations with Great Britain, al ways
Intimate and important, ha Va demanded
during the past year even a greater share of
consideration thau is usual.
Several Vexatious question? Ware left un?
determined by the decision of the Bering
Sea Arbitration Tribitna'. '.Cai application
of tha principles laid clown by that august
body has not been followed by the
results thoy were intended to accom?
plish, either Mantua the principles
themselves lacked in breadth and de.lnite*
ness or because thoir execution has been
more or less imperfect* Much correspond?
ence ha3 been exchanged between the two
Governments on the subject of preventing
the exterminating slaughter of seals. Tho
insufficiency of the British patrol of Bering
Sea, under the regulations agreed on by the
two Governments, has been pointe I out, and
yet only two British ships hava been on
police "duty during this season in those
waters.
The need o' a more effective enforcement
of existing regulations, as well ns the adop?
tion of such additional regulations as ex
patience has shown to be absolutely neces?
sary to carry out the intent of the award,
have been earnestly ur^e! upon the British
Government, but thus far without effective
results. In tho mean time the depletion of
the seal herds by means of pelagic hunting
has so alarmingly progressed that unless
their slaughter is at onca effectively checked
their extinction within a few years seems to
bo a matter of absolute c ertainty.

As to the remaining seetion of the Alasia

northwardly from Mount St. Elias to the

volves tha physic il location of the mari liau

THE JIOXROE DOCTRINE.
It being apparent fiat the boundary dis?
pute between Great Britain and the ltipub
lie of Venezuela concerning the limits ol
I British Guiana was approaching an acute
| stage, a definite statement of the interest
aud policy of the United States as regard;
the controversy se ima! to b9 required both
on its own account and in view of it rela?
tions with the frien Hy Powers directly con
cerne.l. lu July last, therefore, a despatch
was a I dressed to our Ambassador at London
for communication to tai British Govern?
ment, in which tha attitude of the United
Slates was fully and distinctly set forth.
Th i general concludions therein reached
ail formulated are tn substance that the
traditloial and established policy o!thi
Government is firm'y opposed to a forcible
in-rea a by any European Power of its ter
[ ritorial posses.-! ons oa this Continent
that this policy is as Wfll founded in
' principle as it is f-trongly supportej
oy numerous precedents; fiat as a conse?
quence tha Unite! States is bound to protest
against tba enlargement ot the area o'
British Guiana in derogation of the right;
an! agaiu-t tha will of Venezuela; that, cod
sidering the disparity in strength of Greal
Britain and Venezuela, the territorial dis
puta between them eau ba reasonably set?
tled only by friendly and impartial rr'oitra
tion, and that the resort to such arbitrator
should include the-whole controversy, and
is not satisfied if ona of the Powers con?
cerned is permitted to draw an arbitrary linc
through tho territory in debate an I to
declare that it will submit to arbi?
tration only tha portion lying on one side ol
it. Ii view of these conclusions the de
spat eh in question calle! uoon the British
Government for a definite auswer to the
question whether it would or would no,: sub?
mit tho territorial' coutroversy between it?
self an! Venezuela in its entirety to impar
fal arbitration. The answer of tba British
Government has not bean raealvei. but i*
exoscte! shortly, when further communica?
tion on the subject will probably ba maie to
the Congress.
TROUBLES IN HAWAII.
Early in January last au uprising against
the Government of Hawaii was prompth
suppressed. Martial law was forthwith pro
claimed and numerous arrests wera mad
of persons suspected of being in sympathi
with the Royalist party. Among these wen
several citizens of .he United States, whe
were either convicted by a military court and
sentenced to death, imprisonment, oi
flue, or were deported without trial
The United States, while denying pro
tection to such a3 had taken the
Hawaiian oath of allegiance, insiste I
that martial law, tnough alter
int; the forms of justic \ coul I noi
supersede justice itself, and demanded staj
ol' execution until foo proceedings had bee*:
submitted to this Government and kuowlodgt
obtained therefrom that our citizens ha! re
-,- lived fair trial. The death sentences wert
subsequently commuted or were remitted ot
condition of learta jthe islands. Tne cases
of certain Americans arrested and expelled
by arbitrary order without formal charge or
trial have had attention, and in some in?
stances have been found to justify remon?
strance and a olaim for indemnity, which
Hawaii has not thus far conceded.
Mr. Thurston, the Hawaiian Minister, hav?
ing furnished this Government abundant
reason for asking that he ba recalled, that
course was pursued, and his successor has
lately been received.
LYNCHINGS OF FOREIGNERS.
The deplorable lynching of several Italiar
laborers in Colorado was naturally followed
by international representations, and I aa
happy to say that the best efforts of the State
in which the outrages occurred have teer
put forth to discover and puuish the author
of this atrocious crime. The dependen
families of some of the unfortunate victims
invite by their deplorable condition gracioui
provision for their needs.
These manifestations against helpless
allens may be tra-Jed through successive
stages to the vicious pddroni system; which*
unchecked by bur immigration and Contract
labor statutes; dontrols theso -workers from
the moment of landing on our shores; aud
farms them out in distant and often rude
regions; where their cheapenina: competi?
tion in the fields df bread Winning toil
brings them into collision with Other labor
interests; Whilo welcoming, as we should,
those who seek our shores to merge them?
selves in our body politic and win personal
competence by honest effort; we' Cannot
regard such assemblages of distinc?
tively allen laborers, hired out in the mis3
to the profit of alien speculators and
shipped hither and thither as the prospect of
gain may dictate, as otherwise than repug?
nant to the spirit of our civilization, deter?
rent to individual advancement, and hin?
drances to the building up of stable com?
munities resting upon the wholesome
ambitions of the citizen and constituting the
prime factor in the prosperity and progress
of our Nation. If legls'ation can reach this
growing evil, it cortninly should be at?
tempted.
GREAT BRITAIN AND NICARAGUA.
In last year's message I narrated at some
length the jurisdictional questions then
freshly arisen in the Mosquito Indian strip
of Nicaragua. Since tbat time, by the vol?
untary feet of theMo3qdito Nation, the terri?
tory reserved to them has been incorporated
With Nicaragua, the Indians formally sub?
jecting themselves to ba governed by the
general laws nud regulations of tha Repub?
lic instead of by their own customs and reg?
ulations, aud thus availing themselves of ft
privilege secured to them by the treaty be?
tween Nicaragua and Great Britain of Janu*
ary 28, i860.
After this extension of uniform Nicaraguan
administration to the Mosquito strip, the
case of the British Vice-Consul, Hatch, and
of several of his countrymen who had bean
summarily expelled from Nicaragua ftttd
treated with considerable indignity, pro?
voked a claim by Great Britain upon Nica?
ragua for pecuniary indemnity, whicd, upon
Nicaragua's refusal to admit liability, was
enforced by Groat Britain. While tho sov?
ereignly and jurisdiction of Nicaragua was
in no way questioned by Groa': Britain, the
former's arbitrary conduct In regard to
British subjects furnished the ground for
this proceeding.
A British naval force occupied without re?
sistance tbe Pacific seaport of Corinto, but
was soon after withdrawn upon the promiso
that the sum demanded would ba paid.
Throughout this incident the kindly offices
of tho United Stat-vs wer* invoked and were
employed in favor of as peaceful a settle?
ment and as much consideration and indul?
gence toward*! Nicaragua as ware cousistent
With the nature of the case. Our efforts
have since been made ihe subject of appre?
ciative and grateful recognition by Nica?
ragua.
A REM0XST3AXCE TO RCSSI.V.
Correspondence is on foot touching the
practice of lt i---ian Consuls within the juris?
diction of tha Uuited States to interrogate
citizens as to their race and religious faith,
and upon ascertainment thereof to deny
to Jews authentication of passports or legal
doeumcLts for use in Itussia. Inasmuch as
such a proceeding imposes a disability,
which, in the case of succession to property
in Itussia, may ba found to infringe tha
treaty rights of our citizens, and which is an
obnoxious invasion of our territorinl juris?
diction, it has elicited fitting remonstrance,
tba resvlt of which it is hoped will remove
tha causb of complaint.
The pending claims ot sealing vessels of
the United States seized in Russian waters
remain unadjusted. Our recent Convention
with Russia establishing a modus vivendi as
to Imperial jurisdiction in such eases hus
prevented further difficulty of thi.s nature.
SAMOA.
In my last two annual messases I Called
the attention of Congress to the position we
occupied as one of the parties to a lieaty 01
agreement by which we became jointly bound
with England aud Germany to SO interfere
with the Government nnd control of Samoa
aa in effect to assn me the management of its
affairs. On the Oth day of Slay, 1894, linns*
mitted to the Senate a special massage with
accompanying documents giving information
on the subject and emphasizing che opinion I
have at all times entertained, that our situ?
ation in this matter waa inconsistent with
tho mission and traditions of our Govern?
ment, in violation of the princip'es wo pro?
fess, and in all its pbs es mischievous and
vexatious.
I again press this subject upon the atten?
tion of the Congress and ask for such legis?
lative action or expression as will leal the
way to our relief ho *n obligations both irk?
some and unnatural.
NEUTRALITY AS TO CUBA.
Cuba is again gravely disturbed. An in?
surrection, in some respects more active
than the last ior -ceding revolt, which con?
tinued from 1853 to 1873, uow exists in a
large part of the eastern interior of the isl
aud, menacing even some populations on
the coa**t. Besides deraogiug "the commer?
cial exchanges of the island, of which oui
country takes the predominant share, this
flagrant condition of hostilities, by arousing
I sentimental sympathy and inciting adven?
turous support among our people, has en?
tailed earnest effort on the part of this Gov?
ernment to enforce obedience to our neu?
trality laws and to prevent the territory ol
the United Stales fro.n being abused a? a
vantage ground from which to aid those in
arms against Spanish sovereignty.
Whatever maybe tho traditional sympathy
of our countrymen as individuals with a peo?
ple who seem to te struggling for largei
autonomy and greater freedom, deepened aa
such sympathy naturally must be in behalt
of our neighbors, yet the plain duty ot
their Government is io observe in good
faith tha recognize! obligations of inter?
national relationship. Tha performance
of this duty should not ba made more
difficult by a disregard on the part oi
our citizens ot the obligations growing out
of their allegiance to their country, which
should restr.iin them from violating as indi?
viduals the neutrality which the Nation oi
which they are members is bound to observe
in its relations to friendly sovereign States.
Though neitner the warmth of our people's
sympathy with the Cuban insurgents, noi
our loss and material damage consequent
upon the futile endeavors thus far mane tc
restore peace and order, nor any shock
our humane sensibilities may have
received from the cruelties which
appear to especially characterize this san?
guinary and fiercely conducted war, have in
the least shaken the determination of the
Government to honestly fulfill every inter?
national obligation, yet it is to ba.earnestly
boped, on every ground, that the devasta?
tion of armed conflict may speedily be stayed
and order and quiet restored lo the dis?
tracted island, bringing in their train tht
activity and thrift of peaceful pursuits.
One "notable instance of interference bj
Spain with passim? American ships has oc?
curred. Oa March 8 last tee AUiauca, while
boun l from Colon to New York, and follow?
ing the customary track for vessels near the
Cuban shore, but outside tho three-milt
limit, wa** fired upon by a Spanish gunboat,
Protest was promptly ma le by the United
States against this act as not being juatiflei
by a state of war, nor permissible in respect
of vessels on the usual paths of commerce,
nor tolerable in view of the wanton peri
occasioned to inuocent life au! property,
The act was disavowed, with full expression:
of regret, and assurance of nourecurrenci
of such just cause of complaint, while th'
offending officer was relieved of his com?
mand.
Military arrests of citizens of the United
States in Cuba have occasioned frequent
reclamations. Where held on criminal
charges their delivery to the ordinary civi
jurisdiction for trial has boen demanded anc
obtained in conformity with treaty provis
ions, and where merely detained by way ol
military precaution under a proclaimer
state of siege, without formulated ac
cusation, their release or trial has beei
insisted upon. The right of American con?
sular officers in the island to prefer protest:
and demands in such cases having beei
questioned by the insular authority, vf pi*
enjoyment ot tha privilege stipulated by
treaty for the Consuls of Germany was
Claimed Under the mOst-favored-Nittion pro*.
vision df our own convention anl wfts
promptly recognized;
?MASSACRES IN ARMENIA.
Occurrences in Turkey hare CDntihdei to
excite concern; The reported mris3acr33 of
Cnristians in Armenid ftnd th1* devaldpriiettt
thore and in other districts di" a spirit of
fRne.tic hostility td Christian influences nat?
urally excited apprehension for the* safety df
tba devoted mdn arid women, who,; as depend?
ents of the foreign itti&lohdry Societies
in the United States* reside In Turkey dnier
the guarantea df law and ilsage and in tha
legitimate performande of thoir educational
and religion mission. No efforts have beon
spaied in their behalf, and their protection
in person and property hus bead earnes^'y
and vigorously enforced by every ma^us
within our power.
I regret, however, that an attempt on oii
part to obtain better information concerning
the true condition of affairs in the disturbed
quarter of the Ottoman Empire, by sanding
thither tho United States Coasul at Siva? to
make investigation and report, wa3 thwarted
by the objeotion3 of the Turkish Govern?
ment.
The presence of our naval vessels, which
aro now in the vicinity, of the distu*-'oel
localities, affords opportunities to acquire a
measure oi* familiarity with the condition of
affairs, and will enable us to take suitable
steps for tha protection of any interests of
our countrymen within reach of our ships
that inightba found Imperilled.
The Ottoman Government has lately is3Uel
nn Imperial irale exempting forever from
taxation an American college for girls at
Scutari. Repeated assurances have also
been obtained by our Euvoy nt Constant!*
nople that similar institutions maintained
and administered by our countrymen shall be
secured in Ihe enjoyment of all rights, and
that our citizens throughout tha Empire
shall ba protected.
The Government, however, in view of ex?
isting facts, is far from ralyiug upon such
assurances as the limit of its duty. Our
Minister has been vigilant au! a'ert in af?
fording all po33ib'e protection in individual
cases where dangar thre itenai or safety was
impsrillcl. We have sent ships as far towa'\ls
tho points of actual disturbance as it is pos?
sible for them to go, whore they offer re?ugi
to those obligal to flea, uni wa hava tho
promise of other Powers which have ship i
in the neighborhood that our citizen?, as
well 03 theirs, will be recoivod and pro?
tected on board thosa ships. On tha demand
of our Minister orders hava been issued by
tho Sultan that Turkish soldiers shall g -ard
and escort to thc coast American refugee**.
Those orders hava been carried out, and
our latest inteliigen ie Hires assurance of the
present personal safety of our citizens and
missionaries. Though thus far no lives of
American citizens have been sacrificed, thera
can ba no doubt that serious 103s and de?
struction of mission property have resulted
from riotous conflicts aul outrageous at?
tacks.
By treaty several of tha mo.st powerful
European Powers have secure a right and
have assumed a duty not only in behalf of
their own citizens and in furtherance of
their own interests, but as agents o" the
Christian world. Their right is to enforce
such Conduct of Turkish Government as will
restrain fnuatical brutality, au! if this fails
their duty is to so inter .'ere as to insure
agaiust such dreadful occurrences in Turkey
as have lately shocked civilization. The
: Powers declare this right an 1 this duty to
j be theirs alone, aud it is earnestly hoped
that prompt aud effective action on thoir
! part will not be de'.aye !,
MORE TAY FOR AMBASSADORS.
I am thoroughly convince 1 that in addi?
tion to their salaries our Ambassadors and
Ministers at foreign courts should be pro?
vided by the Government with official resi?
dences. The salaries of these officers are
' comparatively smal', and in most cases in?
sufficient to ptty, with other necessary ex?
penses, the cost of maintaining house?
hold establishments in keepiug with
their important and delicate func?
tions. The usefulness of a Na?
tion's diplomatic representative undeniably
depends much upon the appropriateness of
his surroundings, and a country like odrs.
whilo avoiding unnecessary glitter and
show, should be certain that it does not suf?
fer in its relations with foreign Nations
through parsimony and shabbiness in its
diplomatic outfit. These considerations and
the other advantages of having fixed and
! somewhat permanent locations for our em*
i bassies wou'd abundantly justify the moder
1 ate expenditure necessary to carry out this
' suggestion.
THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.
From the discussion of foreign affairs tha
j President turns to tha country's financial
condition. The message says:
"As we turn from a review of our foreigD
j relations to the contemplation of our Na?
tional financial situation we ara immediately
aware that we approach a subject ol domes?
tic concern mora important than any other
that can engage our attention, and ona at
present in such a perplexing and delicate
; predicament as to require prompt an I wisa
I treatment.
"By command of the people a customs rev?
enue system, designed for tha protection
J and benefit of favorted classe3 at tha ex
j pense of the great ma3s of our countrymen.
I and which, whilo inefficient for the purpose
of revenue, curtailed our trade relations and
impeded our entrance to the markets of the
world, ha3 been superseded by a tariff
policy which in principle is basad upon
a denial of tha right ot tha Government
to obstruct the avenues to our people's cheap
living or lessen their comfort and content?
ment, for the sake of according especial ad?
vantages to favorites, und which, while en?
couraging our intercourse and trade with
other Nations, recognizes the fact fiat
American self-reliance, thrift an! ingenuity
can build up our country's in lint rles and
develop its resources mora surely thai en?
ervating paternalism.
"Tbe compulsory purchase aa! coinage
of silver by the Government, unchecked and
unregulated by business conditions aud
heedless of our currency neils, which for
more than fifteen years Uiluted our circulat?
ing medium, undermine! confidence abroad
in our financial ability, aud at last cul?
minated in distress and panic at home, has
been recently stopped by the repeal of tha
laws which forced this reckless scheme upon
the country.
"The things thus accomplished, notwith?
standing their extrema importance and
beneficent effects, fall far short of curing th-:
monetary evils from which we suffer ns a re?
sult of long indulgence in ill-a Ivise I finan?
cial expedients."
The message then gives the history o
legislation concerning the issuance ot green?
backs, and follows with an account of tht
shrinkage of tho gold reserve fund. Cou
I tiuuiug, Mr. Cleveland details the effort? tc
! establish the gold reserve fund by issuing
bonds, and say;-.
RETIRE THE GREENBACKS.
"lam convinced the only thorough an

TflE FSEE BILVEB QCESTIOX,
??"While* I have endeavored to make a plain
statement of the dism-dered condition of our
currency and the present danger menacing
our prosperity, and to suggest a way which
leads to a safer financial syste.n, I have con?
stantly had in mind the fact that many of
my countrymen* whose sincerity I do not
doubt, insist that the cure for the ills now
threatening us may be found Jn the
single and simple remedy Of the
free coinage of silver. They contend
that our minta shall be at once thrown open
to the free; Unlimited and independent coin?
age of both gold and '?liver dollars of full,
legal-tender quality, regardless of the action
ot any other Government and in full view
of the fact that the ratio between tho metals
which they suggest calls for 100 cents' worth
of gold i? the gold dollar at the present
standard, aiid only fifty cents in intrinsic
worth of silver in the! silver dollar.
''NoGovernmrnt, no hitman contrivance or
act of legislation, has ever been able to hold
the two metals together in free co in. uga at a
ratto appreciably different from thnt which
is e.s'ablished in tha markets of the world.
'Twice in our earlier history our law?
makers in attempting to establish a bimetallic
currency undertook tree coinage upon a ratio
whioh accidentally varied from the actual
relative values of the two metals not more
than 3 per cent. In both cases, notwithstand?
ing greater difficulties and cost of trans?
portation than now exist, the coins
who3e intrinsic worth was undervalued in the
ratio, uradutilly and surely disappeared from
our circulation and went to other countries
where their refll value was better recognized.
"Acts of Congress were impotent to create
equality where natural causes decree'' even a
slight Inequality,
" r*;yice in oar recent history we have sig?
nal iv tailed tn raise by lejfislat'on tho value
j of Hirer. Under un act of Congress passed in
1373 the Government was required tor more
l than t Wei vu years to expend annually at least

i* > purchase and for *ed it to become
t tie buyer annually of 51,0*)),0)J ounces, or
! practic illy the ent.re product ot' our m neg.
I Under betti laws silver rapid y and steadily
I ti'jj'ined lr*, value. Tiie pr -pliecy and the ex
: pressed i ope and expectation ot those in the
: Cong ess who lcd in the passage of the last
j mentioned act, that lt would re establish and
maintain tho former parity between thc two
i metals, arc still fresh in our memory.
| "in the light of these experience4, which
ace nd with the experience] of other Nations,
, the e is certainly no secure ground for the
be tel that an act of Congress could now
bridgj an inequality ot' fifty per cent, between
go la mid sliver at our present ratio, nor.ls
i here the least possibility that our country.
! which has less than one-seventh of the silver
i money in tho world, could by its action alone
r.ii**e not only our own, but all silver to its
lost ratio witb gold. Oar attempt to accom?
plish this by the free coinage of sliver at a
ratio differing widely from actual relative
values would nc tha signal for tho complete
departure of gold from our circulation, the
immediate anti large contraction of our circu?
lating medium, aul a ibrlukaga In the real

by the world of business, is nuny times more

Striving to meet the stress of modern com
' j inerca and competition with a debased and
- unsuitable currency und in association with
tiie lew weak and laggard Nations which have

"AU history warns us against rash expert

* I monetary stan lard anl tin degradation of
- our currency. The past is full of lessons
- teaching not only tbs economic dangers, but

will yield to fae false allurements of cheap
t ! money, when they realize that it vaa*t result

and rectitude which thus far in our history
' li is been so devote Hy cherished as one of the
1 traits of true Americanism.

"Those who advocate a blind and headlong
' plunge ti free coinage in the nam; of bitnet
I a'ism and professing the belie*, contrary to
I all experience, that we could thus establish a
" ; double standard ana a concurrent circulation
f ! of both metals In our coinage, are certainly
reckoning from a cloudy standpoint. Our
present standard of value is the standard of
the civilised world and permit? the only bi?
ni :ta!ism now possible, or at. leist that is
?.vithln the independent reach of any single
Nation, however powerful tost Nat on may
be. While the value ot* goid as a standard is
steadied by almost universal com pani shment,
t j wherever this standard is maintained, there
is at its side in free and unquestioned circula?
tion a volume of silver currency sometimes
equaling and some ime< even exceeding it in
amount, both maintained at a parity notwith
Rtandinga depreciation or fluctuation in the
intrinsic value of silver.
"Tnereii a vast differ nee between a stand?
ard of value and a currency for monetary
use. Tho standard must necessarily be fixed

forms anl of various kind**. No silver-stand?
ard country has a gold currency in cireulaion;

ing the stendal tl stable and all other currency

' | standard also give free scope for tho use and

indispenslble to broad and growing commer?
cial transactions nnd eo well substituted
for the actual use of money. If n fixed and
