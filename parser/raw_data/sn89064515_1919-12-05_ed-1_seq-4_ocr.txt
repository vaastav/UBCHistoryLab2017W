The Pioneer Press thinks Larry Ho
not ft big enough man to bo mayor of
St. Paul, and is. endeavoring to have
someone nominated to displace him, or
is the idea an attempt to weaken him

who believe that Larry Ho will be con
sidered a big enough man to walk
away with the governorship.
The tendency to include among I. W.
W's. and bolshevists everybody who
-disagrees with one's ideas has gone on
unchecked, and it appears to us that
Former Justice Charles E. Hughes, who
was also the republican candidate for
president at the last general election,
remarked well, when recently in a Pitts
burg speech he said: "The remedy
for bolshevism is not bourbonism, and
the guilty escape if the charge is so
broad as to embrace the innocent."
The assertion that the productivity
of American agricultural is on the de
cline is shown to be a fallacy in an ad
dress given by Secretary of Agriculture
Houston before the National Associa
tion of Commissioners of Agriculture at
Chicago recently. He said in part:
"It is true that the production of
some of the staple commodities has not
kept pace with population, but this in
itself may be of little significance. The
advance in agriculture has revealed it
self not so much in the expansion of
the staple commodities as in a greater
diversity of products, in the appear
ance of new crops, in the rise o£ minor
crops to large proportions, and the
availability of supplies throughout the
year. But even in reference to the
staple products as measured by one im
portant test there has been a very
marked upward movement. The yield
per acre of crop production in the Unit
ed States has gradually increased. The
average rate of this increase for the
past 25 years has been small, it is true,
being only one-half of 1 per cent a year,
but the aggregate results have been
enormous. This upward trend is not
readily observed in yields from one year
to another, owing to the wide yearly
variations caused by the differences in
seasons. But when averages are ob
tained for a series of years it is readily
observed. During the seventies and
eighties, when there was a vast expan
sion in farm, area in the West, and
crops were grown on a more extensive
scale, the tendency of yields was down
ward. Since the early nineties, how
ever, it has been upward. For the 10
years ending with 1890 the average
yield per acre of wheat in the United
States was 11.8 bushels for the 10
years ending in 1918 the average yield
was 14.8 bushels, or an,increase of 25
per cent. In the first period the aver
age yield of corn was 23.4 bushels in
the second 25.8, or an increase of 10
per cent of oats, 25.9 in the first per
iod in the second, 32.2, an increase of
24 per cent of potatoes, 72.9 bushels
for the first period and 96.8 for the
second, an increase of nearly 33 1-3 per
cent. Cotton, notwithstanding the rav
ages of the boll weevil, increased from
an average of 169 pounds in the first
period to 175 pounds in the second, an
increase of 3% per cent. All other
field crops have likewise improved in
yield, the average for the 10 years end
ing in 1918 being 16 per cent greater
than that for the period ending in 1890.
This tendency is general throughout the
Union. It is not due to the shifting of
production. For example, in the older
State of New York, the iricreases for
the two periods were as follows: Corn,
24 per cent wheat, 44 per ccnt oats,
21 per cent barley, 24 per cent buck
wheat, 43 per cent potatoes, 30 per
eent hay, 10 per cent weighted aver
age of all, 18 per cent. The facts for
New England are even more striking
end' significant. For the six states the
[weighted average increase for all field
crops in 1909-1918 over 1881-1800 is 26
per cent, and over 1866-1875, 25 per
cent.
The same tendency holfls in most
civilized countries. If we compare the
average wheat yields per acre in the
10-year period 1891-1900 with those in
the 10 years 1901-1910, we find the fol
lowing increases: United Kingdom, 6
per cent, or from 30.1 bushels to 31.9
the Netherlands, 19 per cent, from 27.7
to 33 New Zealand, 28 per cent, from
24.6 to 31.5 Sweden, 14 per cent, from
24.2 to 27.6 Germany, 23 per cent, from
23.6 to 29.1 Ontario, 12 per cent, from
19.4 to 21.8 France, 8 per cent, from
18.1 to 19.5 Hungary, 3 per cent, from
17.3 to 17.8 Manitoba, 7 per cent, from
'17 to 18.2 Japan, over 2 per cent, front
17 to 17.4 Roumania, 21 per cent, from
14 to 16.9 the United States, 8 per
cent, from 12.9 to 13.9 India, -16 per
cent, from 9.7 to 11.3 the Caucasus, 18
per cent, from 9.5 to 11.2 and Russia,
14 per cent, from 8.3 to 9.5. The yield

State Capitol Notes
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 29.1919—Speak
ing at the Metropolitan Opera House in
New York City on the evening of March
4, 1919, ex-President Taft said. "If the
President persists, as I hope he will,
that the league be incorporated in the
peace treaty, and brings its back, then
the responsibility for .postponing peace
is with the body that- refuses to ratify
it." In the face of this unqualified
statement by one of the-leading repub
licans of the country, there is an evi
dent intention at this time on the part
of republican politicians and the re
publican press to place the responsibil
ity for the postponement of peace upon
President Wilson. The opposition is
anything but consistent.
When he returned from Washington
last week Senator F. B.' Kellogg said,
"I regret exceedingly that the treaty
was not ratified with reservations.
Many of the repupblicans worked earn
estly from the start to accomplish this
object. These reservations were fair
and reasonable, protected American
rights and American interests, and did
not destroy the treaty nor the league
of nations As a matter of
fact, the republicans Americanized the
treaty, the democrats killed it." It is
to be observed that Senator Kellogg
and ex-President Taft do not agree as
to who is responsible for the death of
the treaty.
As to Americanizing the league of na
tions pact and protecting American
rights and American interests, there are
various interpretations of those rights
and interests. Take, for instance,
Reservation No. 10, under which the
United States refuses to be bound un
der any limitations whatever by the
league upon the question of arma
ments. By this reservation the United
States and any other member of the
league will become the sole judge as to
the extent of its armaments. This in
cludes also the ways and means of
arming, as well as furnishing the muni
tions of war. Under Article 8 of the
peace pact "the high contracting par
ties agree that tlie manufacture by pri
vate enterprise of munitions and imple
ments of war lends itself to grave ob
jections." Reading between the lines,
it would appear that this reservation
was framed with the purpose in mind
of protecting the New England muni
tions manufacturer from interferenpe
by the Government in his business. I
suppose this is what Senator Kellogg
means by '.protecting American inter
ests, but does the country at large, now
that the war is over, desire to reverf
to the same old order which obtained
prior to the conflict?
Then there is Reservation No. 5, un
der which the United States reserves
to itself exclusively the right to decide
what Questions are within domestic
jurisdiction. The adoption of this res
ervation by the United States, will, of
course, permit all other nations to en
joy a similar privilege. Under it Eng
land can declare that Ireland is a do
mestic question, Japan can make a like
claim for Shantung, and in fact there
is no end to which any nation may go
in withdrawing- matters from the action
of the league upon this pretext. Here
is a case where the republicans, while
ostensibly catering to the Irish, the
Italians and the various other nation
alities, in reality have inserted a joker
which will operate exactly in the re
verse of what these various nationali
ties have been led to expect.
If this is Americanizing the treaty
and the league pact, God save us from
such Americanization!
Upon second thought, the republican
organization has decided that it does
not care to carry'the league of nations
as an issue in the next campaign. Im
mediately after the defeat of the trea
ty, Senator Lodge dramatically declar
ed, "The treaty is dead, as I told them
it would be," and a few days thereaf
ter he declared it the intention of the'
republican organization to make the
question a political issue in 1920. NoW
his friends are claiming that when he
said the matter was to be made a poli
tical Issue he did not mean it he meant
the exact reverse.' This, by the way,
is a great deal like the Americaniza
tion of the treaty by reservations: when
one thing is said, another is meant.
It is more and more evident that
some sort of a compromise will be
reached by the coming session of Con
gress. Republican leadership is a scan
dal to the nation. In discussing a pos
sible compromise Senator Kellogg, in
an interview on the 20th instant, said
that while he was in favor of a com
promise and enthusiastically in favor
of the treaty and the league of nations
pact, it was the intent of the republi
cans not to permit the democrats the
satisfaction of authorship in any of the
reservations. A statement of this kind
would do credit to a six-year old boy,
and that is about the size of the aver
age republican leadership.
When the regular session of Con
gress adjourned, on March 4th last, a
demand was made by republican lead
ers that an extra session be called im
mediately for the purpose of taking
care of pressing domestic questions.
President Wilson did not see fit to re
spond to this plea, and for over two
months the atmosphere was rent with
cries and denunciations in which the
deplorable condition of domestic affairs
was dally reviewed because Congress
was not on the job. On May 19 that
body was called together in extra ses
sion by the President and it remained
in continuous session tintil November
19. It is no exaggeration to state that
this has been the prize do-nothing
Congress in the history of the country.
The President desired to relieve the
people from the so-called "luxury" tax,
which is vexatious and which in fact
is not collected from the sources from
which it was intended, and he so stat
ed in his message at the .opening of the
extra session. Congress has not ac
complished even this much during the
extra session. You have all heard a
great deal in the past aoout the effici
ency and ability of republican legisla
tors. If the country is going to elect
the next Congress upon the record of
the extra session, it should not elect
another republican body within the
next 40 years.
A bunch of republican politicians
have been named to. consume the ap
propriation under the soldiers' bonus
act. On Friday the Board announced
the appointment of men who will go to
Washington to collect War Department
information necessary to enable the
Board to pass upon claims under the
bonus act. It will be remembered that
the bill in,question gives service men
the preference in all appointments nec
essary for its enforcement. but there
are so many republican politicians ab
solutely needing jobs and little vaca
tion trips that it has been found im
possible as yet to consider this provi
sion of the act. The men named are
Charles R. Parker, at present holding
down a job as deputy state oil inspec
tor in St. Paul Fred R. Hester. Minne
apolis Edward Hatch, Eveleih: Lewis
Kent, Alexandria Oliver Olson. Manka
to and R. M. Pope, Mora. Each and
every one of these men are republicans,
and not one of them saw service in the
late unpleasantness, except as a mem
ber of a draft board. There is no ques
tion that we republicans must and will
look after our own. DEMOS.

ously increased. In 1915 we paid $48

President ki Message Suggests

ASKS FOR NEW TARIFF
Recommends fngnm to Curb Unrest,
Reduce CMt of Living and Re
Rectify Labor and
Farming
Conditions.
Washington, Dec. 3.—A diversified
program to restore a peace-time busi
ness status, revise the ta:: u,
curb unrest, reduce the cost ui living,
and rectify labor and farming condi
tions, was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to the new ses
sion of Congress.
The President asked for new tariff
laws based on the nation's changed
relation to the rest of the world, sug
gested that® the income and excess
profits tax schedules be simplified, ad
vocated steps to improve rural condi
tions and promote production, and de
clared for a "genuine democratization
of industry" to protect both labor and
capital.
The railroad problem he reserved
for a future message and he made no
statement of his intentions regarding
the peace treaty or Mexico.
He declared the causes of unrest to
be superficial and temporary, and
made his only reference to the Sen
ate's failure to ratify the peace treaty
in saying that restlessness was due
largely to the nation's hestitation in
determining its peace policy.
In an extended discussion of labor
conditions, he declared the workers
had just cause for complaint in many
matters, and that there should be a
"full recognition of the right of those
who work, in whatever rank, to parti
cipate in some organic way in every
decision that directly affects their wel
fare."
He asserted that the right of indi
viduals to strike must be held invio
late, but added that there must be a
firm stand against "the attempt by
any class to usurp a power that only
government itself has a right to exer
cise as a protection to all.
Finally he suggested the establish
ment of a tribunal for peaceful deci
sion of industrial disputes.

WILL NOT FREE JENKINS
Mexico Refuses To Liberate
American Consular Agent.
Attitude of Carranza May Result In
Ultimatum Being 8ent and
Severance of Relations.
Washington, Nov. 28.—Mexico's
note refusing to comply with the state
department's recent demand for the
release of William O. Jenkins, the
American consular agent imprisoned
at Puebla on a charge that he con
nived with the bandits who kidnap3d
and held him for ransom, has been re
ceived in Washington.
America's next step in the ex
change of notes with Mexico probably
will bo a demand that the Carranza
government to supply more complete
details of thQ charges against Jenkins
and permit firsthand investigation by
an American representative, it was
learned at the state department.
May Be Sent Ultimatum.
The government, it is understood,
desires to have M. E. Hanna of the
American embassy in Mexico City go
to Puebla and personally review the
entire matter, making a secret report
to the state department, which would
be checked up with the detailed report
the Mexicans will be asked to furnish.
Meanwhile, it Was suggested this
government would advise Jenkins to
take advantage of the Mexican offer to
set him free on bail.
If the Mexican report does not agrev.
with Hanna's, or if the Mexicans re
fuse to supply more details, the United
States may send a flat ultimatum to
Carranza ordering Jenkins' release. In
the meantime, however, it was made
clear that no dangerous crisis exists
and that the' entire situation is ex
pected to be settled peacefully.
Declares Demand Unjust.
The Mexican note, which was in re
ply to a demand by the American
state department, declared the case
was in the hands of the local authori
ties and that the constitution forbids
the president to interfere in the affairs
of the various states.
