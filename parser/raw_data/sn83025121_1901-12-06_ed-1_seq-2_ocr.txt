charge them, and It was h'.s duty to his
principal to discharge them, and to make
a summary application to the Court for
redress.
He admits he was In Court during the
prcceedlngs In the Territorial Supreme
Court, nnd he testified in the hearing
herein, when exnmlned In relation to the
stipulation for submlss on of further
facts In the Supreme Court matter, that
"he knew some, question arose as to
whether they should do something and
they did," showing his entire familiarity
wiin the case and the action being taken
by tho attorneys therein.
"There Is no principle of practice better
settled In our American law than that
nn appearance In Court by an attorney
for a client carries with It the presumption
of Authority to appear." (Uonnlflcld
vs. Thorp, 71 Pcd , KM )
"It is always presumeel that an attorney
uppearlng and acting for a party to n
cause has authority to do so, and to do
all other nets necessary or Incidental to
tho proper conduct of the case, nnd the
burden of prcof rests on the party denying
such authority to sustain his dental
by a clear preponderance of the evidence."
(Hill vs. Mendenhnll, 21 Wall.,
IT. S, 433, Osborn vs. U. S. llanki 9
Whenton. U S . 73D )
And this Is especially so In relation to
rarelgn corporations, which can only op-war
by attorney.
"The- circumstance that the declaration
In a suit by n corporation wns signed
nnd tiled by nn attorney at law, ror the
plaintiff, Is sufficient evidence that the
plaintiff appeared as a must
attorney." (State Hank vs.
Dell, 5 lnd 127.)
It Is clear that manngmg officers of
corporations have potter to employ
and counsellors without delegations
of power or Tormal resolutions to
that elfect. And wh'le Mr Pain claims
that he did not utithorizo these attorneys,

FOOD NOT ALL
Food is not all the thin man
needs. . Maybe he's sick. You
can't make him cat by bringing
him food. but Scott's
Emulsion can make him cat.
That Emulsion gives a man
appetite and feeds him both.
It brings back lost flesh.
No trouble about digestion.
The weakest stomach can digest
Scott's Emulsion. It tastes
good, too. Scott's Emulsion
paves the way for other food.
When wasted and weakened
by long illness it gives strength
and appetite that ordinary food
cannot give. Not only food

What makes anything a fact? Isn't
It an oe'eurrence ol statement tnat can
bo proven truo and correct In every
particular? What constitutes conclusive
evidence to the mind of a Honolulu
citizen? Is It the statement o(
some one mado In Texas or California''
We think not, but when r.ome of our
own people make a statement and It Is
indorsed by many, there can be no
question about that. Under theso circumstances
wo call thorn facts, and
they are every-day facts, because they
are occurring every day. Don't tako
our word for what Is said. It you ara
not satisfied, ask them; people don't
make Bucb assertions without good
reasons.
Tho Rev. J. Nua of Kawalahao Informs
US;
"I suffered from kidney trouble,
which was, I believe, caused by my
lifting heavy weights whilst young.
Pains In the small of my back were
one of the symptoms ot my complaint.
My trouble extends back to the time
when I was 28 years ot ago, and as I
am now 49, that Is a considerable period.
During all this time I was subject
to pains in the back. They continued
despite the fact that I consulted
several physicians and took numer
ous remedies. No relief thus gained
can be compared to the benefit obtained
from using Doan's Backache
Kidney Fill. I have got on wonderfully
well since taking them. I am
quite Batlsfled with the result, and
shall always have eomo of the pills by
me, even when going from Honolulu
to other missionary fields In the South
Pacific. There is no other remedy like
Doan's Backache Kidney Pills for kidney
complaints, Including backache."
It is important to get the same pills
which helped Mr. Nua DOAN'S
BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS. Therefore,
ask for Dean's Backache Kidney
Pills.
Doan's Backache Kidney Pills are
sold by all druggists and storekeepers
at SO cents per box (six boxes for
12.50), or will be mailed on Tecelpt ot
price by the Hollister Drug Co., Honolulu,
wholesale agents tor the Hawaiian
Islands.
I Clifford Hhodcs has cone to Washington
to take a plncei In the government
printing otllce. He passed a 91
per cent examination here.
