i.to niKormr,
Cashier U E. Silcott, of Ohio, hai gone to
Canada with funds of the House amounting
to IT2,0trJ.
Hilcott bad been gone two days before
the facts were discovered. The Deraocratio
Sergennt-nt-Arnis, Leu loin, of Ohio, is re
sjKinsiblo for the money under bomls to ths
extent of t VJ, 0). His bondsmen include ex
Congressman Felton, of California, and Da
vid H. Pa ge, of Cleveland, Ohio.
Kilcott, the defaulting cashier, Is from
Georgetown, O., and was the personal ap
IKiintmcnt of Leedo it, w ho also lives at that
placo and represented that district In Con
gress for three terms before bis election as
Kcrgcant-at-Artus. Silcott Is about 60 years
of age, w 1th a bald bead and flowing beard. He
lias a family, but bud been leading a fast
life and indulging In the most extruvagant
bubits, giving big dinners at Worm ley's and
rrrx'ndiug money everywhere in tho most
lavish manner.
licsldea the 72.nOO embezzled front tbe
Government, Silcott obtained I.O.OoO from
Leeloin hid! amounts from other parties
that will probably swell tho aggregate t
tlOO.Ooo.
I.nst Saturday Silcott notified Mr. I.eedoni
that he was going to New York an 1 would
be buck Sunday night. A iness.igo was re
ceived from biiu, dated New York, Monday
morning, saying that he bad been do aincd,
but would return that night. A similar tues
wge rcai he 1 bis wife In this city. As be did
not appear Tuesday, Mr. I.eedoni was fearful
that ho had been overtaken by soma acci
dent, hut, to satisfy rising suspicions, began
nn investigation. The information thut Sil
cott bad drawn bis bank account decened
these siisii cions. ami tho inouirv was tmr-
' -
nil. The enormous olllce sule could not 1 6 1
opened at t tie moment, as Silcott ha 1 the '
combination, but when an entrance was
finally effected it was found that some $30,
000, set apart for the uso of the paying teller,
was intact.
The next inquiry was ma 1o at the Treas
ury Department, and Mr. I.eedoni was
tunned by tho result. Ho was informed
that Silcott bad called there Saturday and
bad drawn (.bout 72. 0. It was possible
for him to draw this large sum without any
exciting comment, as he had fur a long time
been charged with thcdtity of collecting the
money with which the salaries of the Pep
reseutatives are pai 1. Silcott is under buntls
in the sum of .'u,)K) , his sucuritie number'
Ing about 15 persons. This is, howi ver. an
Indemnity bond given to the Sergi nut-it-arms,
and Mr. Lcedom, who is himself

Dr. W. W. Kei-ii, professor of surgery al

performed nn luiortaiit on'ration upon a
ix-ye.ir-olt child, so-i of a prominent New
York clergyman. The child suiTureJ from
epilepsy, and to efTVct a cure A portion ol
the bruin was removed.
Tbe little follow when about two yean, rid
fuil and bumped his head. Arter a time tbe
boy became subject to epileptic convulsions,
and gradually loi-t tho p.iwer of speech ex
cept such words us Pa and Ma.
For thu week past thu child ha been in
Dr. Keen's car J. He carefully watched the
little patieii. anil studio 1 each symptjin of
epilejisy. Finally ho tliagiiiisiid the case,
maintaining thut the epilepsy was due to a
lesion of the brain, lie located this lesion
partly by the t .Dements of the parent in to
the fall an I partly by the parts of the body
ami organs allecteit by thu supposed dis
eased condition of tho brain suh-tanco.
Dr. Ketii divided upon tlio ojs'ration.
'iliu little pat'unt was .therized and laid
up in lliu operating tablu. Dr. Keen, as
sisted by Dr. William Forh 'ian l Dr. Addi
nell He'vsou, Jr., began tlu operation.
After taking the length of tho skull with uu
instrument devi-cd for tho p.irpoe und
marking u line upon the crown running ut
uu angle of about tilde 're -s forward und to
the left of thu median line, Dr. Keen cure
fully separated the .scalp and turned it back,
leaving tint skull bare.
Applying t Ii-j trepm at two points on the
line, lie removed thu circular pieces of bono
ami enlarged thu aparturcs thus made frith
bono forceps. All these piece.s of bone wero
carefully placed in sterilizil fluid ut tbe tern
peraturuof tho hiiiutti body, that Is. about
loo Fahrciifit. Now thu iuivurlng brain
covered by the dura mater was to beacon.
This being carefully divided, thu diagnosed
lesion was found right at the placd sup
posed. At this point an experiment was made. A
galvanic battery was brought out und on be
ing applies! to thu cicatrix of the brain nil
tbe phenomena of mi epileptic attack were
simulated, continuing the surgeon's opiuiou
that here was thu seat of tlu trouble.
A fuw skillful niovemeirs of the knife
followed, mid iu a few moments thu moss of
diseased brum substnnce wus successfully re
moved and the resulting cavity carefully
cleaned. On applying thu galvanic battery
again no epileptic convulsions followed
much to thu physicians' delight.
Tho work of closing tho bruin by replacing
the dura mater was begun, followed byre
placing thu bono and thou the scalp all ovur
this was soctirod in place by antiseptic dress

rcstorod to his cot.
The result of tbooeratioii will be watched
