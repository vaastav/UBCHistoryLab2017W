CITIZENSHIP FOR
PORTO RICANS
President's Special Message
Favors That Among
Other Boons
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.—The pres
ident's message to congress giving the
results of his recent observations in
Porto Rico and making recommenda
tions concerning that island was read
in the senate today.
The message in full follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
On November 21 I visited the island
of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, cross
ing by the old Spanish road by Cayey
to San Juan, and returning next morn
ing over the new American road from
Areclbo to Ponce; the scenery was
wonderfully beautiful, especially
among the mountains of the interior,
which constitute a veritable tropic
Switserland. I could not embark at
San Juan because the harbor has not
been dredged out and can not recJlvo
an American battle ship. I do not
think this fact creditable to us as >i
nation, and I earnestly hope that fm
mediate provision will be made for
dredging San Juan harbor.
I doubt whether our people as a
whole realise the beauty and fertility
of Porto Rico, and the progress that
has been made under Its admirable [
government We have Just cause for
pride In the character of our repre
sentattves which came under our flag
as a result of the war With Spain; and
of no one of them Is this more true
than of Porto Rico. It would be Im
possible to wish a more faithful, a
more efficient and a more disinterested
public servlfee than that now being
rendered In the Island of Porto Rico
•by those In control of the insular gov.
eminent. - .
I stopt at a dozen towns all told,
and one of the notable features In
every town was the gathering of thé
school children. The work that haa
been done in Porto-'RitRo for education
has been noteworthy. The mi in em
phasis, as is eminently wise and prop
er, haa been put upon primary educa
tion; but in addition to thisTthere ta à
normal school, an'^ agricultural school,
ttfree industrial and throe High schools.
®v«y «ffert -to being mode to secure
not only the benefits of elementary
education to all the ' Porto 1 RkMtns of
the next generation, but also as' far as
means will permit to train them so
that the Industrial, hgricultiifal and
commercial opportunities of the Island
can be ut lilted to "the best possible
advantage. It was evident at a glance
that the teachers, both Americans and
native Porto Ricans, were devoted to
their work, took the'greatest pride In
it, and were endeavoring to train their
pupils, not only in mind, but in what
oounts for far more than mind In
Citizenship, that Is, In character.
T was very much struck by the ex
cellent character both of the insular
police and of the Porto Rican regi
ment.
, , „ .
They are both of them bodtc':j
that reflect credit upon the American
administration of the island. The in-|
sular police are under the local Porto
Rican government. The Porto Rican
regiment of troops must be appro
pria ted for by the congress. I earn
estly hone that this bode will be kepM
pemianent. Ther-' should certainly be
troops in the Island, and It 1s wise that !
these troops should be themselves na
tive Porto Ricans. It would be from
every standpoint a mistake not to per
petuate this regiment.
In traversing the island even the i
most eursorv survev leaves the be
holder struck with the evident rapid
growth In the culture both of .the
sugar eatv 1 and tobacco. The fruit In
dustry is also growing. Last year
■»'as the most prosperous year that
the Island has ever known before or
since the American occupation. The
total of exports and Imnorts of the
island was forty-five million* of dol
lar« as against eighteen millions In
19h1. This is the largest tn the
Island's hlstorr. Prior to the Amerl
can ocrunstlon the greet. =* trade for ,
any one year was that of 1896, when It
reached nrsttr twenty-three millions
of dollars. Last veer, therefore, there

ship. '
Under the wise administration of
the present governor and council,
marked progress his been, made In the
difficult matter Of granUng to the
people of the island the largest meas
ure of self-government th Hi can with
safety be given at the present time,
ft- would have been a very Serious
mistake to have gone any faster than
we have already gone In this direc
tion. The Porto Ricans have com
plete and absolute autonomy in all
tbelr municipal governments, the only
power over them possessed' by the In
sular goVemment being that of re
moving corrupt or incompetent muni
cipal officials. This power has never
been exercised save on the clearest
proof of corruption or of Incompetence
—such as to jeopardize the Interests
of the people of the island; and under
such circumstances it has been fear?
lessly used to the immense benefit of
the people. It is not a power with
which It would be safe, for the sake
, of the Island Itself, to dispense at
present . The lower house is abso
i Iutely elective, while the upper house
ls ap p oin tive. This scheme is work
ing well; no injustice of any kind re
j sults from it> and great benefit to the
ls , land and it should certainlv not be
ehanged at this time. The machinery
of the elections is administered en
tlrely by the Porto Rican people thent
SG lves the governor and council keep
àg^în
ing only such supervision as is neces
sary In order to insure an orderly
election. Any protest as to electoral
frauds Is settled In the courts. Here
It would not be safe to make
any change In the present system.
The elections this year were abso
lutely orderly, unaccompanied by any
disturbance; and no protest has been
made against the management of the
elections, altho three contests are
threatened where the majorities were
very small and error was claimed; the
contests, of course, to be settled In the
courts, in short, the governor and
council are co-operating with all of
the most enlightened and most pa
triotic of the people of Porto Rico in
educating the citizens of the island In
the principles of orderlv llherty. They
pp* providing a government based
upon each citizen's self-respect, and
«toe mutual respect of all citizens;
ftàkt to, based upon a rigid observance
of the principles of justice and hones
ty. It has not been easy to Instil nto
the minds of people unaccustomed to
tjje exercise of freedom, the two basic
principles of our American system;
the principle that the majority must
rule, and the principle that the min
orlty has rights which must not be
disregarded or trampled upon. Yet
real progress hag been made in hav
lng these principles accepted as ele
mentary, as the foundations of suc
Itjcessful self-government,
I transmit herewith the report of
the governor of Porto Rico, sent to
the president thru the secretary of
state.
All the insular governments should
placed In one bureau, either In the
department of war or the department
of state. It Is a mistake not so to
arrange our handling of these islands
At Washington as to be able to take
advantage of the experience gained in
one, when dealing with the problems
that from time to time arise in an
other.
In conclusion let me express my ad
miration for the work done by the
congress when it enacted the law un
der which the island Is now being ad
ministered, After seeing the island
personally, and after five years' ex
perience In connection with its ad
ministration. It Is but fair to those
who devised this law to sav that it
would be well-nigh impossible to
have devised any other which In the
actual working would have accom
pUsh»d batter results.

France Severs Connection
That Has Lasted for
Thousand Years
PARIS, Dec. 11.—This Is an his
toric day tn France. The struggle
which began In 1880 with the ban
lshmen of the Jesuits ended today
with a legal rupture of the bond
which has been practically uninter
rupted for a thousand years between
the church and the state. By refus
ing to make the required declarations
under the public meeting law of 1881,
public Catholic worship except by
schismatic organizations tomorrow be
comes illegal.
There were no disturbances today,
blit the-«scenes in many of the cathe-
duals was vary afféiethig. Not In years
have there been such an attendance at
mass. The number of women was
especially large. No reference was
made In the services by officiating
clergy to their Illegal status tomor-
row, nevertheless a spirit of depres-
sion was manifest. After the services
many women emerged from the cathe-
drals, their eyes streaming with tears.

Mr. Libby Warns It Would
Be Profitable Not to
Tread on His Toes
V* tread on my
' You mustn't tread on my toes'* was
the warning given to the Evening
Teller last evening by E. H. Libby,
president of the Lewlston-Clarkston
Co. By this he meant that the Even
ing Teller must pot publish In Its
columns anything that would stand In
the Way of his pet scheme to raise a
fund for the advertisement of Lewis
ton-Clarkston, and incidentally to give
him the use of th? name of a publicity
committee in advertising his lands for

Promises of Business Favors.
Libby Informed the Evening
Teltef -Ahat he w-as in a position ta do

would not do anything If the Teller
should ''tread on his toes." He fur
ther threatened that the advertising
of other merchants in the city would
be withdrawn from the Teller if the
Teller did not "stand in" with the
plan of the irrigation companies.
The occason of the remarks was a
conversation held during the day be
tween a representative of the Evening
Teller and Mr. Libby.
"1 hope the Teller will support this
movement of publicity," said Mr. Llb
by.
Regarding Editorial Support;
"The Teller will support the move
ment" he wafe told, "but the Teller
will advocate that the fund raised aa
a citizens' fund and not an irrigation
company fund. The Teller believe«
that the idea advanced by Mr. Voll
mer, or a similar one, should prevail."
'Bfit It will not prevail," replied Mr.
Libby, "i started this movement and
I shill see that it to carried ont as »

. "But we certainly have a right to

right." replied the representative of
the Teller.
Makes Hint of Business Deal.
Some days ago Mr. Libby called
upon the Teller with the Information
that he had In mind a man who would
like to purchase such a plant as the
Evening Teller. He was told that the
property owned by the Teller manage
ment could be purchased were the
pricè offered satisfactory.
The matter dropped at that untH
yesterday afternoon, when Mr. Libby
had been told that an editoriafl would
be published opposed to the Irrigation
scheme of public advertising of their
lands. He then called up the office
of the Evening Tellar and said that
his man had sent word he was com

Mr. Libby was Informed that the

of the people. He was told that money

opinion of the movement he was try
ing to bring about. - **

"Well," said Mr. Libby, "Just such
an Article as you are going to publish
will take a lot of advertisers from your
paper."
"Tfhen they will have to go," Mr.
Llbt|y wae told. "We believe we are
right. We are heartily in favor of a
publicity movement, but It must be
sincere, and we do not believe you are
sincere In your movement, else why
oppose the plan which the people
think Is fairer."

you to say whether I help you or not/*
The editorial was published in last
night's Teller, expressing the view the
Teller holds, and If Mr. Libby a"d alt

patronage from the Teller they could
