Kansas and the I'cople of Kansas.
A new volume commcucca the ilret
of January, and that will be the time to
commence new subscriptions and renew
old one. Commence promptly with
the first number of the new year.
We now send-The News to over five

most) journal in excellence and influ
ence in all the western country. We
desire a large addition to our subscrip

MR. KELLOMS REPORT.
We owe an apology for not having,
drawn the attention of our readers to
this excellent paper in our editorial col
umns at the time it was published. But
a multitude of other duties intervened
to prevent us from giving it that atten
tion its importance demands. At this
late hour we shall attempt to give mere
lv an outline, or rather a summary, of
this well written report :
The present year's attendance, 213,
compared with that of previous years
makes a very flattering exhibit, being
nearly 23 per cent larger than in ISO'J,
and nearly AS per cent larger than in
18C3. Had there beeu moro room for
the accommodation of students, it would
have been still larger than it has been
And Mr. Kellogg well says that the
greatest need of tho school at present.
Is additional room. In fact it has siiujily
come to this: Thero must bo more
loom providud or the school must be
content with its present growth and use
fulness. In what manner this addition
al room can be best and most wisely
obtained the Principal very forcibly
and we think, rijrlitly, points out. He
recommends that a new building cost
ing from 00,000 to !? 100,000, be erected
and let this be for the Normul School
proper ; and then let the present build
ing be devoted entirely to the use of the
Model School department. This plan is
a better one than that of enlarging the
present building, for a variety of reas
ons: 1st. The present building is complete
in itself and not well adapted to receiv
ing additions.
2nd. Additions that would be large
enough to meet the needs of the school
for more than two or three years cannot
be erected without destroying the sym
metry of tho edifice.
3d. The increused educational benefits
that would accrue from the erection of
a large, commodious and permanent
Normal School building justify an ex
penditure of a largo sum for this pur
pose, rather than a smaller sum for the
purpose of enlarging the present build
ing. 4th. Tho Model School department
needs and should have this entire build
ing, and it is so constructed aud arrang
ed that it would admirably servo the
purposes of the Model School.
The Principal makes. another sugges
tion, the wisdom of which we can com
mend with equal ardor and pleasure,
vli: That the course of study bo so
modified, that on the one hand it shall
be extended to a four years' course, giv
ing to those students who desire to be
come thorough teachers, sufficient time
to thoroughly prepare themselves for
teaching iu tho higher departments of
our public schools, aud on tho other
hand be contracted to a two years'
course, for the benefit of those students
whose means are limited and whose de
sire it is to prepare themselves merely
for the work of the Common School.
Confessing to a lack of that intimate
acquaintance with the objects sought to
be attained by Normal Schools, which
would make our criticism of some ac
count, yet we hope we may be par
doned for sayiug, that in our humble
opinion, tho quantity of certain kinds
of the mental food with which this
course of study, admirable in most re
spects, proposes to feed the mind of the
student, might bo increased without di
minishing, in any mauner, the practical
benefits to public school teachers. For
example, we do not seo how the student
can in ouc short term acquire that thor
ough knowledge of Algebra which will
fit him to teach this branch successfully,
lie can surely hope iu this short time
to becomo familiar with no more than
the elements of Algebra, and while he
might be able, as a teacher, to solve for
Ms pupils any niplo problem of the
1st, 2nd or 3d degree, he is likely to have
at least one ambitious student, who hav
ing bad a taste of this delightful food,
might feel unsatisfied until ho had eaten
everything of the kind within his reach ;
and so coming with his teacher to the
Problem of Lights, tho Binomial
Theorem, Sturm s Ihcorcm, or some
such knotty problem as any one of
these, ho would be likely to find some
thing he could not digest, and which his
teacher would, just as likely, be utterly
unable to digest for him. The same
thing may be said of Geometry and of
the Languages. We are conscious,
however, that the "best and most satis
factory results cannot be reached in the
short time of three years, and so we hope
that the suggestion to leugtheu the cur
riculum may be speedily adopted.
THE PRESIDENT XSD THE CRITIC'S.
That the feeling among Republicans
towards the Administration is measur
ably better since the President's Mcs
aage has been before the people, than
prior to that time, is unquestionable,
The position which the President took
with reference to the Civil Service Re
form, has opened the eyes of even the
severest critics of the Administration
to the fact, that at heart the President is
in sympathy with that measure, and
.that this reform is more likely to be ob
tained in, than out of the Republican
party. In this direction there is but one
tep needed to secure almost entire har
mony in that great army that placed
General Grant at the head of affairs.
If Congress will only pass a law by the
unanimous vote of the Republican
Members, that shall eradicate the evils
which this reform is intended to de
stroy, the President will readily give it
his sanction, and the party will ratify it
by their unanimous verdict. What the
President says with regard to revenue
reform should alio satisfy extremists
whether their hobby be Free Trade, or
an Unrestricted Tariff. Whatever poli
cy iu our commercial intercourse with
other countries will tend iu the greatest
measure to make the country prosper
ous and secure the greatest good to the
greatest number, is the policy which the
Administration will most heartily en
dorse; bnt so many and divers ideas
are embraced in this thing that is de
nominated by all of its devotees "Rev
enue Reform" that it can neither he
supported uor rejected. And then, as
the President says, a trne revenue re
form cannot be effected instantaneously,
but must be the work of National legis
lation and of time. The President favors
the removal of the revenue from art!
cles of universal use just so soon as the
necessities of the Country will permit it.
But at present some protection to home
industry is necessary to the encourage
ment and growth of home manufac
tures. So on this queslson there is real
ly no good ground for dissenting from
the view of the President. The free
traders aud the protectionists, or the
revenne reformers should not expect
to have all -their views embodied in the
policy of the party. As to essentials
all these may, and nearly all will agree,
Since the President's Message has been
read by the people, thero has uot been
nearly as much fault-finding with the
course of the Administration. The
Country sees that the President is hon
estly and faithfully endeavoriug to dis
charge the functions of his high office,
aud despite the bitter enmity of roes in
and out' of the Republican party, the
ship of State has never been more skill'
fully or ably managed. What the Coun
try needs most, and wishes most, viz
Peace at home and abroad; such man
age me nt of the finances of the Country
as shall most rapidly reduce the Nation
al debt and at the same time make as
light as possible the burdens of taxa
tion : and, as a security of this and of
the general honesty and economy of the
Administration, a weakening of the sys
tem of the patronage which now holds
and abuses the civil service ; the Presi
dent has constantly had at heart. In
these respects no previous Administra
tion has done so well, and in our opin
ion the responsibility of preserving un
ity aud harmony in the Republican par
ty now rests chiefly with Congress and
not with the President.
THE POPE'S SEW fHAMPIOX.
Of the many wonderful phases spring
ing out of tho European imbroglio, the
most surprising is Premier Gladstone's
announcement that the English Govern
ment has 'resolved to insure the Pope
full protection in his person, and secu
lar and spiritual rights.' Or iu plainer
terms, England Is to succeed France as
tho especial champion and protector of
tho Popo and Papal power.
We venture to say that this astound
ing diplomacy was not looked for by
even the most careful observers of Eu
ropean affairs. Doubtless the English
Cabinet never entertained the idea until
very recently. Panic-stricken at the
prospect of war with Russia, it must
have felt that without some new and
potent ally Iiiglanu cannot success
fully cope with cither Russian diploma
cy or artillery. For England always
depends upon continental assistance
But now, 1 ranee is powerless to even
protect herself. Spain has just chosen
its King from the nation that has driven
the papal forces from Rome. Austria is
weak physically, and bankrupt financial
ly. Turkey is sick as ever. Prussia is
virtually allied with Russia, while none
of the minor powers could affect the re'
suit. So thrown upon its own resources,
the English Government turns with op
en arms to the traditional enemy of Eng
lish progress, and hopes by one des
perate stroke of cowardly policy to se
cure for England all the influence of the
Catholic Priesthood throughout the
world. What a prize to bid for! No
wonder the London press is said to
"howl" over this official announcement
of England's degradation. To trans
form the British Lion into a Papal
hound, is enough to make it howl for a
century. V hat a figure for England to
cut in history. What a task for a Prot
cstant people to assume. What an epi
taph on the departed greatness anfl
glory of the British nation.
The Pope is forlorn enough to gladly
accept any champion, even If it be
Protestant power ho and his servile big
ots detest. But what return can he
make ? What has he done for France
iu the present war? Defeat for France
meant the expulsion of the Pope from
Rome. The Napoleonic aud Papal dyn
asties were bound together. But what
has Papal authority and Catholic influ
ence availed to aid their chief protector ?
And what more can the Pope and his
Priesthood do for England than for
France ?
!ro having promised to bestow very
much upon a personage who can return
very little, it now remains for tho Eng
lish Government to carry out its Quix
otic enterprise, or else become disgraced
in Catholic, as it is in Protestant eyes.
How will it restore aud maintain the
Pope ? Will it send a fleet up the Tiber
to shell the Italians out of Rome, and
knock down St. Peter's church in try
ing to make Pius the IXth its sole pro
prietor? Or, finding how egregiously it
has over-estimated the value of its new
sought ally, will it tamely back down
from its incongruous position, and ac
knowledge that England can neither
maintain tho Pope iu Rome, or keep
Russia out of the Black Sea? It seems
to us that this will be the end of Glad
stone's surprising diplomacy, and be
side such a humiliating situation for
England, fallen France will appear hon
orablc and powerful indeed.
