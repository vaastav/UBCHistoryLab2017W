gress at Moscow, which was comprised
of representatives of a number of re
actionary organizations like the ban
ner bearers and holy alliance of Rus
sian patriots, seemed to have the cue
to attack Premier Wltte. Detailed mall
reports of the sessions show that the
congress bitterly assailed the premier,

the- antiquated zemsky sobor.
The telegraphers tried to meet this
afternoon at the hall of the Technical
society to discuss ways and means to
keep up the strike, but they were com
pelled to disperse by a police captain
backed up by a squndron of Cossacks,
on the ground that they were violating
the regulations.
The League of Leagues has called on
the workmen and on all friends of
freedom to donate a day's wages to the
cause of the telegraphers, and has
warned the railroad telegraph opera
tors that they must cease to transmit
any except service messages.
Father Capon is continuing to preach
to the workmen against a revolution,
saying that the strike tactics are sure
to eventuate Into reaction and Jeopar
dize the freedom purchased by blood.
He warns the revolutionists and Social
ists that they cannot arouse the peas
ants by their political demands, but are
more likely to raise up a counter revo
lution. He says:
"A hundred fanatical priests with
church banners and Ikons might easily

Wealthy Devotees Escape Rigors of
Eastern Winters
Special to The llorald,
CHICAGO. Dec. 6.— 'Bookings for
California limited trains continue to
give railroad men considerable to do.
Investigation today revealed that in
addition to prospects for the largest
California traffic ever known the west
ern roads will carry more automobiles
to the Pacific coast for the winter
tourists than ever before.
As express and freight rates across
the continent to the Pacific coast on
automobiles are high It is reasonable
to suppose that Chtcagoans will con
tribute enormously to the earnings of
the companies.
Percy F. Megargel, who is much In
the limelight of the auto world for his
interesting trip to the Pacific, sends
word that eastern devotees of automo
blllng had any idea of the glorious win
ter touring in California on the olied
highways they would never bother with
snow , flecked roads.
"Imagine broad, well oiled highways,"
writes Mr. Megargel, "wide enough for
vehicles to pass at full speed. In the
east I sometimes have a run for a half
a mile on roads like these lined with
fine trees,, but out here it Is the samo
beautiful vista mile after mile."

Lower House Spends Day In Discui.
slon of Proposed Appropriation
for Canal— Debate at Time
Waxes Warm
By .A.if oeln tr-d Pr«RS.
WASHINGTON, Deo. 6.— With an op.
portunlty for unlimited debate on the
subject of the Panama canal, the house
exhausted its oratory on that subject In
a session of four and three-quarters
hours today.
The bill appropriating $16,600,000 for
canal work, which was the subject of
discussion, will be read for amendment
and placed on its final passage to
morrow.
The feature of the debate was the
criticism Indulged in by both' Republ
icans and Democrats regarding the com
pleteness of the statement of expendi
tures and estimates furnished by the
canal commission. '• ' '
Mr, Hepburn, in charge -of the 15111.
made some effort. to show that while
detailed estimates might be made satis
factory, at the same time members of
the house were not In a position to pass
critical Judgment on estimates on such
work prepared by expert engineers who
held responsible positions and had been
selected entirely because of their fitness.
Inquire of Press Agent's Duties
Bourke Cockran of New York, took
decided exception to this attitude on the
part of Mr. Hepburn, applied it as
affecting all matters of ' appropriation,
and arraigned It as decidedly the wrong
attitude of legislators. During his
argument he read the sentiment of the
president in his message for economy,
and scrutiny of appropriations.
The so-called "press agent" of the
canal commission was criticised by sev
eral speakers, and lack of definite in
formation as to the status of such a
position was shown. The place was de
clared to carry a salary of $10,000 a'
year and some curiosity was manifested
to know what were its dutien.
Unanimous consent was asked by Mr!
Hepburn for immediate consideration of
the canal bill. Pending the request Mr.
Williams, the minority leader, took oc
casion to characterize the request as
unusual, but, he said, the necessity was
unusual. There was no disposition on_
the Democratic side to delay the "appro- "
prlatlon. ■ . ■ -
The bill was then considered by the
house as in committee of the whole,
with Mr. Vreeland of New York in the
chair.
Ten 'Million Already 'Spent
Mr. Hepburn began the discussion of
the measure. After a brief controversy
with Mr. Payne of New York, who as
serted that the bill should have been
referred to the ways and means com-
