how much would you lose?
You can, and probably do insure
the house and furniture. But how
about your money?
Do you try to keep it in the house?
That same money deposited in

Last week Jeseie Morris was shot
and killed by his brother Taylor Morn
ria on Point Claire Plantation. It
NT seems that Taylor Morris and another
Snegro whose name is not known were
engaged in a game of craps when the
difficulty arose and Taylor drew his
pistol to shoot the other negro and
killed his own brother in the scuflle.
The coroner made a charge against
Taylor Morris for murder, and an
additional charge of carrying con.
ceaded weapons.
This practice of carrying concealed
weapons should and must be broken.
Our district ,udges must be more
severe in dealing with these parties
who have a perfect disregard for law
and order. There should be also
harsher legislation upon this subject.
Our offiers of the law throughout the
entire state should wage a fiercer war
r.against these "miserable private bands
of crap-culprits." Nine tenths of the
crimes, which blackens, the good name
of our state, are due to an impropei
enforcement of the laws prohibiting
concealed weapons and the playing
~7of craps.
Congress and the Message.

Congress met in regular session much
last week. This session will be a lI wl
long one and the nation's law maker some
will have over six months to digest appe

the complicated questions submitted ing a
to them and to solve the great prob Sguai
lems confronting us. We hope it will
be an instance of the, "mills of the n
gods grinding slowly but surely." squai
Nothing has been done as yet. A with
resolution tending to bring before Th
congress the election Law of Louisiana bran
and the reduction of representation that I
in that body was introduced. But than
this was for political effect, and no Tb
shou
seriousness is attached to it. It stan(
comes in bad grace, however, at this bush
time when the North and South are into

The message of President Roose- estal
velt presents his views on all public TI
matters. It was received by congress sing
with senous attention as every one prair
was anxious to hear his position on any
I the great questions of the day. The bywn
message is a long document, well
written, deals with every subj ct of are
importance affecting the interest of so a
t our country, and has many good have
> tlingf in it. Washington, B rbi, gam'
London, Paris, etc. have discussed it cina
a torn
and pronounced it good. Some say t
it is "admirable" others "tolerable", b
while a few contend that it is the char
"best :hing ever written." Just like TI
the school boy's first oration every saril
body applauds at the close more for
Ti
the purpose of keeping company with he ii
e the majority than to really show ap sup:
j preciation of the effort. It is the tats
h same old story repeated over again T
a. after each regular assembling of fere
y Congress. The SENTINEL does not can
t- wish to detract one tota from the
merit of the State paper, but we must Tps
e say that it is no better than that of
K any other American, who has bten T
ý, elevated to the exalted position of
Chief Eteeutive of this great country, '
ae would have been. Many people were jest
le afraid of Mr. Roosevelt just like 7
y Europe was uneasy about the young the
is German Emperor when he took the P'
reins of government. Our nqw exe- the
cutive has agreeably surprised those
people and convinced all that conser
of vatism and statesmanship were con- thu
a- trolling factors of has administration' nin
While we cannot discuss the merit wit
n of the paper in detail, and follow the
ee many subjects with which it deals, be
;n we will say that on one question he wit
strikes a blow at sugar, which wi.l ,
)r. cause many of our readers anxiety pis
y, and trouble. In treating on Cuba hr or

iu atlirmed what we desired, that she wi

for and we are bound by every considera di
mad tien of honor and expediency to pass or

mud What will be done by congress on
:vr that, question is now perplexing the
minds. Our great domestic interests
htare not to be sacrificed under any
hot consideration.

Lher emphatic terms that he will enforce

inst Taken all in all we have cause to
Iio say that the message is a great deal
con- batter than was expected from Mr.
sled Roosevelt when he took the oath of
ken. office. The SENTINEL, having the
nore good of the people at heart, would
law like to see him administer our public1
also affairs in a manner to redound to the
ttehonor and glory of our entire people.,

than if kept on gram.
That the business men in this town
should prohibit their clerks from
standing in the front dovr of their
business houses yawning aed bhmMin
into space with a perplexing expres
sion upon their countersances, and
That it would be far better to have
the clerks in the back part of the
store whittling sticks, than to have
them hanging in the door as an ad.
vertasement to the public that no
business is being conducted an this
establishment.
That the game of marbles woul I be
alright if played in a barn or on the
prairies in the Attakapas country a
any far off corner of civilisation. but
by no means on the streets in the
town of Thibodaux, and
That actually some young men who
are an business in this town and have
an air of importance about themselves
I have been seen in the midst of this
game which is so enticing and has.
t cinating that their presence cannot be
c torn away from it.
That it a saloon man who sells to.
' bacco is a mer haul, what is a met
chant who sells bittejs?

sarily a good head for figures.
r
That when a n.an marries he thinks
he is getting a mate, but often the

:e That there are some parties within
4 the limits of the town who make a
1e practice of turning out their horses
and cattle late at night and taking
them up early in the morning, sad
se
r That these parties had better be
careful as there is an ordinance cm
n' this subject which prohibits the run
*n ning at large of horses and cattle
it within the corporation.
That if you want your chireea to

That a woman idea of heaven is a
