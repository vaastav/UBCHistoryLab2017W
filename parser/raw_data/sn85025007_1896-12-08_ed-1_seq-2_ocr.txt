words. Nearly fifteen coJnous of a
Washington newspaper were required
by hitfl yesterday congratulate his
friends upon the defeat of the
party tbat elected hita, and to
tell them that tbey should continue to
abide by toe verdict of the popular will;
that he doe.-; not beiieve Turkey will
ioug be permitted "to offend the sight
of Christendom," teat be hag advised

sleep foi tbe most disagreeable of all
thoughts .- that concerning what might
have been, and it barrows up their souls
to remember how close their cause was
to success ai tbe Bret battle of Manassas,
?\ Fredericksburg and at Gettysburg.
Tbe discussion of tbe reason of their de?
feat at tbe latter place has been re
opened. It is bootless, but is well
known. At tbe time of tbe battle it was
generally believed throughout the army
that, the reason was tbe delay of General
Longstreet in bringing his troops into
action. He was ordered to do ho early
be morning, but did so late in the
evening.
Though the President acknowledges
that tbe insurgent negroes and scala?
wags-in Cuba have none of the attri
butes ol government, be does not think
the bands of incendiary and murderous
looters of whom tbey are composed
should be compelled by Spain to sur?
render before she makes terms with
them. Hut the Jate President Lincoln,

per cent, leas than those of the men en?
gaged in Himilar work in the other
countries referred to. Instead of increas?
ing the tarill, the duty on all the nec?

FROM WASHINGTON.
'Corr?por?d*&ce of tbe Alexaniri* Gazer.*.,
Washington, Dec. 8.
A republican Senatorial caucus was:
held this morning. Messrs. Dubois,
Pettigrew, Mantle and Cannon, tne'
four of the five boiling republican r^L
i ators now in tbe city, did not attend, :
! but held a conference of their own in i
1 the committee room of Mr. Dubois. i
: Tbe onlv republican to whom a notice I
! was not"sent was Senator -Stewart, of j
'. Nevada, who all through tbe last ses- j
-ion was considered as an out-and-out j
populist. Senator Dubois this morning j
re-'igned the secretaryship of tbe cau |
cos and bis tn^mberchip on tbe steeriDg ;
i committee. This may be an indica j
1 tioo of tbe proposed policy of the i
; silver men to refrain from affiliat- j
j icg with tbeir o!d-time colleagues, j
Senator Wilson, of Washington, was j
elected s?-cretary in place of Mr. Du?
bois. There was a rivalry between
Senators Sboup, of Idano, and Hans- i
borough, of North Dakota, for tbe va- j
cancy on tbe steeriig ?-'?^rnittee caused
by the resignation o: M.. Dj ois. Tue
question was settled by pufitg '-?otb
! men on the committee. The chief
topic for discussion was the Dinnley
bill, with the result tbat the matter
was referred without action to the
steering committee, who will consider
tbe advisability of taking it up and the
po--:b.lliy of pa^.-iLg it. Senator Sher?
man refrained from discussing it. The
cotcensus of opinion gathered from
the snort speecne= made was, tbat it
would not be wise to take up the bill,
owing to the entanglements tbat were
sure to arise, and tbe more potent fac;t
tbat u would be impossible to get tbe
votes wherewith to pass it. Republi?
cans who attended tbe caucus say
they are firm in tbe conviction tbat
tbe" Dingley bill i= now with?
out tbe bope of passage. Senator
Wo'cott. of Colorado, introduced
a resolution, which was unanimously
adopted, authorizing tbe chairman of
the caucus to appoint a special commit?
tee of five Senators whose duty it shall
be to devise such legislation for action
by this session of Congress as will se?
cure an international monetary con?
ference with tbe leadiog commercial
nations of tbe world. Senator Wolcott
made a short speech favoring the
adoption of tbe resolution, arguing tbat
this session should enact tbe legislation
necessary to authorize the incoming
President to invite tbe other nations to
join in such conference and appoint tbe
American delegates thereto. There
was no opposition, and the resolution
was agreed to without a dissenting vote.
The debate on the Dingley bill was
participated in by upwards of a dozen
Senators. Messrs. Hale and Frye, of,
Maine, thought it expedient to take up
the measure and push it, while Messrs.
Aidricb. of Rhode Island, and Morrill,
of Vermont, were opposed. Mr. Gear,
of Iowa, called the attention of tbe
steering committee to tbe fact that the
Pacific railroads funding bill had been
referred to it at tbe last session, and
urged tbat committee to make a report
favoring action at this session. He
threw out tbe intimation that he in?
tended, if possible, to force the measure
to the front, should the committee's
report he unfavorable to prompt action.
Mrs. Caroline P. Winslow, who bad
a national reputation as a leader among
women, died at ber home in this city
last night, at tbe age of 74.
An eL'ort was made in tne Senate to?
day by Mr. Call to get in a resobution
on the subject of Cuba, but as that stage
of morning business had not been
reached, be was forced to wait for an?
other day. Notice was given by Mr.
(,'ulloin that be would next Thursday
submit some remarks on tbat subject.
Governor Gates, of Alabama, is here
to day. He says there is a proposition
now before the legislature of his Slate
to order a constitutional convention to
so change the election law as to exclude
from sulJrage the illiterate voters and
those who have no interest in the wel?
fare of his State, and tbat be hopes it
will pass, as tbe democratic parly is so
divided there now that at tbe next
election there may be two democratic
tickets, iu which case the republicans
will win.
Representative Sherman of New
York, who has the Memorial Rridge at
Arliugton in charge, told the GAZETTE'S
correspondent this morning tbat while
be would do all he could to have it
passed, he had no hopes of success, as
Mr. Fletcher of Minnesota, a member
of the committee tbat reported it, had
announced his intention of opposing it,
even if the Speaker shall allow it to be
called up. Subsequently Mr. Fletcher
told the correspondent thut he certain?
ly should oppose tbe passage of the
bill, not only because the favora?
ble report on it was obtained dur?
ing; his absence, but because ap?
propriations made two years ago
for more necessary purposes, some
iu his own diatrict, are still held up for
want of money, and that he will not
consent to any more improvements un?
til those already provided for shall be
at least under way. If the Virginians
in Congress, he said, would help to
increase the revenue by raising the
tariff, be would not object to the ex?
penditure of money, and so anxious
wus he to fill the coffers of the Treas?
ury tiiat be had even voted for the in?
come tax. When the bill was before
tbe committee, he said, be proposed that
Virginia and the District of Columbia
should pay one-half of the expense and
the government the other halt, but that
proposition was not adopted. The
b:ll, ho Haid, provided for only $b'00 -
000, but everybody knew that it
would cost at leaHt $2,000,000
While some of the democratic Sena?
tors have not greeted Senator Palmer
after their long separation, none of
them has refused to recognize him, and
Senator Daniel of Virginia made it his
business to greet him warmly. But tho
head of the late decoy ticket now find*
bis most congenial associates on the re?
publican side of tbe chamber.
It is needless to say that the Virginia
delegation iu Congress is not effusive
in its approval of tbe President's mes?
sage. Of two of the House part of the
delegation asked about the Cuban sec?
tion of it to-day, Messrs. Tyler and Mere?
dith, the former said it presented four
aspects for four diflereut sorts of ob?
servers, and the latter, that the Presi- '
dent should "put up or shut up."
There is no doubt of the fact that the
majority of the membert of both parties
in the House are against Spain. Tbe
J Pennsylvania members were inter?
viewed on the subject to-day and near
ly all of them expressed themselves as
in favor of interfering in behalf of the
insurrectionists.

few weeks, and President Cleveland re
| ferred to it in his annual message which
was laid before Congress yesterday.
Mr. Powers said to-day that be did not
doubt the committee on rules would
report an order Betting aside a few days
for a consideration of the measure. He
1= satisfied that the House will pass the
bill.
