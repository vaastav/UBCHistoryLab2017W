The Treasury Report.
Wa rcBrT any extended i; nopals' of ilia
TreAaarj report until ve haa the doou
ment in full, but the telegraph bring
eaough to show that the Report U able And
axhaustira. The vast interest of tha Uni
ted fctateg are in good hands. Secretary
Chase grasps the detail as Trail as the
generalities of his Department, and pre
sents a paper lruieb. ire guarantee has had
no superior for practical sens.. The figures
he gives are enormous, but ire have' an
enormous country to make the figures good.
The Report tells its own story in plain
language, and we refer to to it for ail par
ticular.
Another of Floyd's Tricksâ€”Seventy Thousand
Stand of Arms sent to California.
Some weeks since we published a dis
patch to the effeot that the UoTernment ex
pected to receive 35,000 stand of arms
from California, and were at a lrss to con
eeire how so many oould be spared from or
hare gone to the Faci&o coast. It seems
that the Californians were equally aston
ished on discovering how rich they were,
a will be seen by the following from the
Loa Angeloa Star:
Seventy thousand stand of arms were
ent here by Fiord, and so secretly convey
ed to tha Benicia arsenal, that no one not
specially entrusted with the information,
knew of their arrival, Even after the
arms had been stored in the arsenal for
months, tha Legislature made a requisition
upon the General Government for materials
of war, which requisition was actually ,
complied with, and the arms solicited were
promptly furnished. This shows that the
Ad ministration itself was not aware of the
bountiful manner in which Floyd had sup
plied the 8tate with muskets and rifle.
The arms were sent here, without a doubt,
in expectation of their being seized by se
cessionists. Had the plan sucoeeded Cali
fornia would have been in a state of revo
lution to-day. In the programme of the '
rebellion arranged at Richmond, the at-
tempt was to be made either to unite Cal
ifornia with the Sooth or form distinot
Confederacy of tha PaoiS States. A can
vass of the popular feeling demonstrated i
the impossibility of effecting either of these
ehemes of treason, or even seizing and
retaining the arms for the use of the Bouth.
Discovered by the Department, 85,000 of
them were returned to tha Atlantio Stales,
and the remainder conveyed to Aleatrax,
where loch of Uem as are not in use are j
safely stored, The question may well be
asked, "In a time.of profound peace, what
excuse was there for sending 70,000 extra
stands of arms to California?'' Floyd only
can answer; we can only conjecture.
The expedients of soldiers to obtain
liquor seem Inexhaustible. A Paducah
correspondent of the St. Loui Republican
ays the other day a man s'arted out with
his coffee-pot for milk ; on his return, an
officer suspecting him of having whisky
in his can, wished to examine it, and the
man satisfied him by pouring out milk.
'At night there was a general drunk in that
oldier'a quarters, ending in a fight. It
wa at last disoovered that the man had put
little milk into the spout of hi can, seal
ing the inside with bread, and filling the
can with whisky. That man is "cute"
enough to lead an expedition against Jeff.
Thompson.
It is said by a writer on board tha San
Jacinto, that Commander Wilkes ran near
enough to Charleston to afford his pilgrims
an opportunity of once more beholding the
tower high and battlement gray of that
acred city their starting place not fifteen
day before and also, that the San Jacin

[General Order No. 130.]
The sienal success which has crowned
or forty hours' conflict with the arrogant
and confident enemy whose uovernmeni,
it seems, is hourly looking for an announce

in a merciful Providence. The terrifio bom

Inaa of onlv seven lives, with eight wound

We have crippled their ships and driven
them off, and forced the garrison of
Pickens, in it impotent rage, to slake

burning the habitation of our innooent
women and children, who have been

For the coolness, devotion and conspion-
eus gallantry of the troops, the General

Martello Towers.
of
The Philadelphia Ledger, ot November
19th. in an article on "The Delaware
River," referring to the opinion of " a dis
tinguished military officer," said :
b He especially advocated the strength
ening of the fortification by the construc
tion of Alartello Towers. In reference to
this defense a word of explanation may
be necessary. At Mortella, in Corsica, a
strong tower made a most determined re
sistance to a superior force of English at
tacking it in 171)4. Struck with the em-
oacy of the conBtruotion, the British Gov
ernment ordered twenty-seven or tnese
towers to be built on the channel coast to
provide against a French descent. By
corruption from Mortella, these towers
were called Alartello, a name applied to a
strong but small tower, with walls of great
thickness, thoroughly cannon proof, hav
ing its door some distance from the ground,
and a ladder which oan be drawn in.
Eoh tower mounts one traversing gun, in
working which the men are defended by
lofty parapet The tower is manned by
from six to twelve men."

The Governments of Great Britain, France
and Spain having issued proclamations that
the Confederate States were viewed, con
sidered and treated as belligerents, I felt no
hesitation in boarding and searching all ves
sels ot whatever nation l.fell in with, and
have done so.
The Question arose in my mind whether
I had the right to capture the persons of
the Commissioners, and whether they were
amenable to capture. There was no doubt
that I had the right to capture vessels with
written dispatches. They are expressly
referred to in all authorities, subjecting
the vessel to seixure and condemnation
the captain of the vessel had the knowl
edee of their being on board. . i
But these gentlemen were not aispatcnes
in the literal sense, and no where could
find a case in point. They bad been present

embodiment of dispatches, and it therefore
became mv dutv to arrest their progress and
capture them if they had no passports from

agent of the vassal, the eon of tha British
Consul at Havana, was well aware of the
oharaoter of these persons. They went in
the steamer with the knowledge and con
sent of the Captain, who endeavored af
terwards to conceal them by refusing to
exhibit the passenger list and the paper
of the vessel. I -
There can be no doubt be knew they' were
Oftrryiug highly lmyortant dispatches, and
were endowed with instructions inimical to
the United States. This rendered his vessel,
though neutral, a good prize. I determined
to take possession of the vessel, and as I
mentioned in my report, send . her to Key
West for adjudication. '
I forbore to seize her, however, in oon
sequence of my being so reduoed in officers
and crew, and the derangement it would
cause innocent persons, there being large
number of passenger who would have
beon put to great loss and inconvenience,
as well as disappointment, from the inter
ruption it would have caused them in not
being able to join the steamer from St.
Thoma for Europe,
I therefore concluded to sacrifice the in
terests of my officers and crew in the prise
and suffer the steamer to proceed after the
necessary detention to effect tha transfer of
these commissioners, considering I had eb
tained the important end I had in view.
