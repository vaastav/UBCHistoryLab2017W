THE PRESIDENrS
ANNUAL MESSAGE
No Peace in Mexico Until Gen.
Huerta Lets 60.
WANTS MONEY BILL PASSED
Mr. Wil3on Also Urges the Enactment
of Legislation to Make Farming
a More Efficient Business
Other Important Points.
Washington, Dec. 2 The following
la a summary of President Wilson's
message, delivered to Congie.-:s
In pursuance of my constitutional
duty to "ftivo to the Congress in
formation of the stale of the I'nion,'
1 tane tne liberty ot addressing you
on several matters which ought, as it
seems to me, particularly to engage
the attention of your houorable bodies,
as of all who study the weliare of the
nation.
I shall ask your indulgence if 1
venture to depart in some degree
Irom the usual custom of gelling be
fore you in formal review the many
matters which have engaged the at
tention and called for the action of
tne several departments of the gov
ernment or which look to them lor
early treatment in the future, because
the list is long, very long, and would
suffer in the abbreviation to which 1
should have to subject it. 1 shall sub
mit to you the reports of the heads
of the several departments, in which
these subjects are set forth in careful
detail, and beg that they may receive
the thoughtful attention of your com
mittees and of all members of the
Congress who may have the leisure
to study them. Their obvious impor
tance, as constituting the very sub
stance of the business of the govern
ment, makes comment and emphasis
on my pan unnecessary.
The country, I urn thankful to say,
Is at. peace with all the .world, and
any happy manifestations multiply
obout us of a growing cordiality and
sense of community of interest among
the nations, foreshadowing an age of
of settled peace and good will.
Hue.-ta Must Let Co. .
There is but one cloud upon our
horfc-.n. That has shown itself to the
south of us, and hangs over Mexico.
Ther can be no certain prospect ol
peace in America until General
Huerta has surrendered his usurptf
authority in Mexico; until it is under
stood on all hands, indeed, that such
pretended governments will not be
countenanced or dealt with by the
government of the l'nited States. We
are the friends of constitutional gov
ernment in America; we are more
than its friends, we' are its cham
pions: because in no other way can
our neighbors, to whom we wouh'
wish in "every way to make prom ol
our friendship, work t.ut their own
development in peace and libeity.
Mexico has no government. The at
tempt to maintain one at the t'ity ol
Mexico has broken down, and a mere
military despotism lias been set up
which lias hardlv more than the
semblance of national authoi ity.
Currency Reform.
I turn to matters of domes! ic con
cern. You already have under con
sideration a bill for the reform of our
system of banking and currency, for
which the country waits with impati
ence, as Tor something fundamental
to its whole business life and neces
sary to set credit free from abntrary
and artificial restraints. I need not
say how earnestly I hope for its early
enactment into law. I take leave to
beg that the whole energy and atten
tion of the Senate be concentrated
upon it till the matter is successfully
disposed of. And yet I feel that the
request is not needed that the mem
bers of that great house need no urg
ing in this service to the country.
I present to you, in addition, the
argent necessity that special pro
vision be made also for facilitating
the credits needed by the farmers of
the country. The pending currency
bill does the farmers a great service.
It puts them upon an equal footing
with other business men and masters
of enterprise, as it should; and upon
Its passage they will find themselves
quit of many of the difficulties which
now hamper them in the field of
credit.
Let Sherman Law 8tand.
Turn from the farm to the world of
business which centers in the city and
in the factory, and I t&lnk that all
thoughtful observers will agree that
the immediate service we owe the
business communities of the country
la to prevent private monopoly more
effectually than it has been pre
vented. I think it will be easily agreed
that we should let the Sherman anti
trust law stand, unaltered, as it is,
with its debatable ground about it,
hut that we should aa much as posst
Me reduce the area of thai debatable
ground by further and more explicit
legislation; and should also supple
ment that great act by legislation
which would not only clarify it but
r aJee facilitate its administration and
I" auk It fairer to all coneeraed.
nees lor the presidency ol the United
States. 1 feel confident that I do
not misinterpret the wishes or the
expectations of the country when 1
urge the prompt enactment of legisla
tion which will provide for primary
elections throughout .e country at
which the voterstif the several parties
may choose their nominees for the
presidency without the Intervention
of nominating conventions. I venture
the suggestion that this legislation
should' provide for the retention of
party conventions, but only for" the
purpose of declaring and accepting
the verdict of the primaries and
formulating the platforms of the
parties.
Philippine Independence.
We can satisfy the obligations of
generous justice toward the people of
lJorto Rico by giving them the ample
and familiar rights and privileges ac
corded our own citizens in our own
territory and our obligations toward
the people of Hawaii by perfecting
the provisions of self-government al
ready granted them, but in the Philip-,
pines we must go further. We must
hold steadily in view their ultimate
independence, and we must move to
ward the time of that indeepndence as
steadily as the way can be cleared
and the foundations thoughtfully and
permanently laid.
Double Duty Toward Alaska.
A duty faces us with regard to
Alaska which seems to me very press
ing and very imperative; perhaps 1
should say a double duty, for it con
cerns both the political and the ma
terial development of the territory.
The people of Alaska should be given
the full territorial form of govern
ment, and Alaska, as a storehouse,
should be unlocked. One key to it is
a system of railways. These the gov
ernment should itself build and ad
minister, and the ports and terminals
it should itself control in the interest
of all who wish to use them for the
service and development of the coun
try and its people.
Specially Important.
Three or four matters of special im
portance and significance 1 bes that
you will permit me to mention in clos-
ng.
Our bureau of mines ought to be
equipped and empowered to render
even more effectual service than it
renders now in improving the condi
tions of mine labor and making the
mines more economically productive
as well as more safe.
We owe it, in mere justice to the
railway employes of the country, to
provide for them a fair and effective
employers' liability act; and a law
that we can stand by in this matter
will be no less to the advantage of
those who administer the rain-odds of
the country than to the advantage ot
those whom they employ.
An international congress ior the
discission of all questions that affect
safety at sea is now sitting in London
at the suggestion of our own govern
ment. So soon as the conclusions of
that congress can be learned and con
sidered we ought to address our
selves, among other things, to the
prompt alleviation of the very unsafe,
unjust and burdensome conditions
which now surround the employment
of sailors and render it extremely
difficult to obtain the services of
spirited and competent men such as
every ship needs if it is to be safely
handled and brought to port.
INDICT COLORADO STRIKERS
Federal Grand Jury at Pueblo, Which
Probed Mine troubles
Makes Its Report.
Pueblo, Colo., Dec. 2. Federal in
dictments against national officers
and organizers of the National .Mine
Workers ot America and members of
that organization have been returned
by the jury which investigated the
coal strike in this state. Ten indict
ments were made public and fifteen
more were held until arrests can be
made. -
Charged with maintaining amonop
oly of labor, these national officers
of the United Mine Workers were
indicted: John 1'. White, president;
Krauk J. 1 (aye's, vice-president; Wil
liam P. Green, treasurer.
Methods of the United Mine
Workers are severely condemned.
FARM FURROWS.
Farmer and Stockman.
Corn husking, even with the more
fortunate of us, is a shorter job than
usual this year. I wish there were
more husking to do than there is, for
this country is going to be closely
pinched for corn before another-crop
matures.
The city man who complains of no
appetite should come out in the coun
try these crisp, cool days and tackle
about ten hours of pitching manure
into a spreader. I '11 guarantee the ap
petite will be there all right, if the
energy is left to feed it.
Running -water any distance in a
ditch, alongside the grade is unsatis
factory business. More or less will
soak into the grade, making it soft,
and in time of high water it will try
hard to cut across the grade and fol
low a natural course. Making a dam
of a grade, in order to carry water a
certain way, is usually not as suc
cessful as it should be.
The timber lot comes in for its
share of the hard licks between now
and early spring. A sharp ax, a sharp
saw and a good engine and buzz saw
are the "equipment included," as the
auto salesmen say.
It is also nearing the season of
year when the freezing proposition
must be kept in memory. Is the wa
ter drained from the auto radiator,
from the gasoline engine water jacket
and emptied from the several and vari
ous other receptacles in which its
freezing would do damage? Thoughts
should run along these lines before
going to bed these cold nights.
Keeping ruts out of the grade is a
great aid to good road making. Even
if there should be a smooth track
for the travel, if there are ruts on
either side, the grade is muddier after
the next rain simply because those
ruts hold water on the grade. Keep
ing a grade a nice, smooth oval by use
of the drag is the cheapest system of
maintaining good dirt roads.
I cannot bring myself to believe
that there is a great deal of money
in hog fattening as matters now stand.
Where thereis corn enough so it may
be had for'around 60 cents, perhaps
there is some money made, but in
those sections of the country where
corn is worth 80 cents a man can
barely break even in feeding it to
hogs. This high price of corn is both
ering everyone, except the man who
has some of it for sale.
Bedding is a scarce article thisyear.
The dry summer was good for hay
making, and I did not get a forkful
spoiled by rain. The quality, too, is
good enough so the horses eat every
scrap of it. Where bedding is to
come from when a little straw is gone
is more than I know.

It takes but a short time to see that
all bright tools are well greased, but
it takes a long time to scour them in
the spring if they become rust dur
ing the winter. Even if the shares
moldboards and shovels were well
greased when put away, they may
need another greasing about now.
Of course it's the old, old story, but
more machinery rusts out and rots
out in the weather than is worn out.
It is too bad that a nation of farmers
as enlightened as we allow such a
waste to go on. I sometimes think
we are too prosperous to take care of
what we have. The hundreds of
thousands of machines housed in all
outdoors would make one think so.
We have had a fine fall for getting
the work done, but there are still
many fields to be husked and many
shocks of fodder to be hauled. This
will be the case, even if fine weather
lasts until Christmas.
.Hog cholera is carrying off a great
many hogs, but the scare is what will
create the real shortage. When hogs
begin dying in a neighborhood the
living hogs and pigs are rushed to
market regardless of weight With
both cholera and the scare working
overtime, as they have been this sum'
mer and fall, we will be pretty sure
to hear of the real thing in shortage
in hogs before another year rolls
around. . "
One of my neighbors, who is some
what of a rusher, has husked his corn
and is breaking sod for next season's
crop of flax. Another ueighbot has a
new automobile and is havingthetime
of -his life sailing over ,fhe best of
roads, but bis corn Is still in the field.

odors, or the cream will not be clean.
If there is no machine shed ou the
farm the machinery should at least
be taken out of the fields and the pol
ished surfaces painted or covered with
axle grease. Paint will prevent rust
and its use will add years of life to
almost any farm machine.
Wire corn cribs can be built in a
hurry and will do for holding the
'overflow, ' ' but unless they are roofed
they can scarcely be regarded as cribs.
It takes a little training to teach
the cows to take their places when
they are turned into the barn, but, if
the choreman knows his business,
they will soon learn. The choreman
who has to club his cows into their
places should try to get a job in a
blacksmith shop or a stone quarry.
Perhaps all the sweet things that
are said about the sweet plant we
must not say weed now are true, but
it is hard for some of us to believe
them. Anyway, it might be all right
to try at least a small patch in the
pasture as a starter.
This vicinity has very few straw
"piles" this fall, but there are many
well-built "stacks. " Burningstraw to
get it out of the way is a thing of the
past.
