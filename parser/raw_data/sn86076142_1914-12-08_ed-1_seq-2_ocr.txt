THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
THE message of President Wilson, delivered this morning to the Joint
housi-t of coon-ess. 1 noteworthy from the fact that it contains noth
ing of a startling nature and space in filled with the nnoloaophical platitudes
which hare become a feature of all communications from the White Hou-e.
It is commonplace to a degree, omitting many features which would interest
the people of this country and expatiating on a lot of theories that com
mand scarcely any attention from citizens at large Throughout the mes
sage there is not an inkling of the truth concerning Mexico. There is
neither apology nor explanation. No reason u assigned lor the occupation
of Vera Cruz and citizens are left to conjecture if the military measure was
not simply a demonstration of the efficiency of the American soldier as a
scavenger. When the heaps ol garbage thai polluted the air ol the south
ern gulf were removed and the town thoroughly disinfected, the troops
were called home and Vera Cruz turned back to a lot of irresponsible revo
lutionists whose chief occupation is the violation of defenceless women and
the ruthless assassination of foreigners. Incidentally it may be mentioned
that the American flag hax never been saluted, although 10,000 troops and
an armada of battleships were paraded with the ostensible object of whip
ping recalcitrant Mexico into subjection. Mexico remains obdurate Presi
dent Wilson's message is eloquently silent on these points.
On the matter of extending trade relations to the southern continent
the president indulges In the sophistry that Iat in America needs our manu
factures and cannot get along without them He takes the selfish view
that the Spanish speaking people of South America are chiefly interesting
to North Americans as consumers of commodiiies produced in this country.
It might have come with better fitness had (he president suggested the
cultivation of relations with South America by establishing a reciprocal
trade and building up mutual interests
The burden of the president's lamentation is directed at the decadence
of the merchant marine, which he mourns as one of the lost treasures ot
the nation. He frankly admits the fallacy of the several suggestions offered
for regenerating the merchant marine by saying congress has erred Again
he criticises others when the fault lies at the door of the present administra
tion, which has done more than all previous administrations to check invest
ment of capital in steamships flying the American flag. It was the Wilson
administration that raised the cry of "The Steamship Ixibby" when it was
proposed to admit foreign built vessels to American register with coasting
privileges It was also the Wilson administration which shifted responsi
bility to "The Steamship Trust" on the other side of the fence when con
gress was occupied with the question of free tolls for vessels Hying the
American flag. This preferential consideration was fought by the Uemo
crata and defeated at the behest of Great llritain, notwithstanding the fact
that Great Britain subsidizes British bottoms and therefore pays those
Teasels engaged In the interoceanic trade a greater bonus than the remission
of tolls to American vessels would amount to.
The war in Europe is treated from a psyc hological standpoint as affect
ing the American people and we are told not to grow hysterical over the
debility of the army and navy, which are said to be strong enough with the
aid of a rehabilitated national guard to meet all hostile demonstrations
from abroad. No matter in what way the message is regarded it is a
grave disappointment

TIME TO PAY TAXES.
COUNTY is not Involved in any dispute with the Nevada Tax Com
mission and therefore there is no excuse for delaying payment of th-
semiannual obligation which matures December l!lt. The tax levy has
been reduced materially and taxpayers should show their appreciation of
the economy urged by the state board by coming forward promptly with
their allotment of taxes. In former years it has been the practice of many
taxpayers to wait until the last day before coming forward and the result
has been that the treasurer's office has not been able to accommodate the
demands of citizens Nearly two weeks are open and those who intend
paying their taxes should call at the courthouse before the rusli begins
California has put up the bars against Nevada spuds for the reason
that state knows It cannot compete with the Sagebrush farmers in the
quality of their product The cry of eel worm has been raised again If
