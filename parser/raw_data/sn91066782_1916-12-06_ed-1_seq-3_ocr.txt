ORANGE COUNTY FARMERS'
ASSOCIATION NOTES.
Notes for week ending Dec. 2.
Three Farmers' dubs met this past
week, Monday Kvening Farmer' club,
IVtli; Chelsea West Hill; and Washing
tun. At Pet,h, the men discussed the
principles of eo-operutivo buying and
until i uliins for takinir un the co-opera
tive buying of chemical and seeds. The
ladies clii-uswi-i Christmas suggestions.
Alter these business discussions, a very
t-njovable hour was spent in entertain
ment. At the West Hill club, C. C.
Miinn iiiul riii-.t.rir ill airriciilture. Chelsea
hih school, brought out some valuable
points regarding feeding dairy cows, ins
tributing a sheet of feed values, which
could be used in making up a ration. He
emphasized particularly the high fertil
izing value of some of our high protein
feeds. The county agent led a discus
sion on the use of the valuable bulle
tins on feed, seed and commercial fertil
iser iimm.i.f .ion. which aro issued annual
ly by the state experiment station. The
ladies discussed Christmas suggestions
and lowering the cost of living. The
meeting in Washington was the lirst of
the newly organized club of that place.
'Jhe interest was much larger than at
nreliminarv meetinirs. After the
business meeting, the county agent dis
cussed the commercial fertilizer situa
tion and gave suggestions regarding their
fmrchasc either ns mixed goods or client
cals. A committee made up of Yorkus
Drdway, O. K. King and J. A. Partridge
was aiinointed to see what could be done
(bout making up a co-operative order
tor chemicals.
The Vermont experiment station is
sending to its extensive mailing list the
following three bulletins, which ought to
be in the hands of every thinking farm
er. A careful study of the information
there given may mean saving dollars
to you in the more economical purchase
of feeds, seeds and commercial fertilizers.
Bulletin 1117 gives the results of last sea
son's analyses for protein of the various
feeds sold in the state. As it was found
that one in six of the brands sold last
season failed to live up to its protein
guarantee, it is well worth our while to
know what feeds did so. Thia bulletin
also has a popular article on the oat
crop. Bulletin 198 takes up commercial
fertilizers in the same way giving their
analyses and guarantee side by side for
comparison. An article on tillage is val
uable, as by proper tillage the fertilizer
bill can be materially reduced. Bulletin
E(l() gives the result of analyses of seeds
oirered for sale last season These have
not come under state law until recently,
to we need to post ourselves on what
the law requires and how the firms live
up to these requirements. When the
state goes to the expense of finding out
these things for us, isn't i up to us to
make Use of the information so;gathered,
when the knowledge may mean the sav
ing of both time and money? Any who
tlo not receive these bulletins may do so
by sending their name to the Vermont
experiment station, Burlington, Vt., or

CHILD MORTALITY
Is Bound Up in Industrial Conditions,
Finds Investigator.
That children's welfare from babyhood
to adolescence is bound up with industrial
conditions is emphasized by the recent
work of the federal children's bureau of
which the chief, Miss Julia C. Lathrop,
tells in her fourth annual report made
public to-day.
A study of infant mortality in Man
chester, X. H., completed this year, adds
new evidence that when the fathers' earn
ings are low or the mothers work out of
the home the infant mortality rate is
exceptionally high. In Manchester it va
ries from one death among every four ba
bies where fathers earn less than $4.i0, to
one death among every 16 babies where
fathers earn $1,050 or more.
Miss Lathrop's report refers to the ef
fect of living conditions upon mothers
and points out that the sickness or death
of the mother lessens the baby's chances
for life and health. The bureau has
prepared a statistical study of maternal
mortality and finds that 15,000 mothers
die year by year in this country from
largely preventable causes Incident to
maternity and that the death rate from
maternal causes has not decreased since
1000. Miss Lathrop says in commenting
upon this fact: "The means of prevention
are the instruction of the mother, skilled
supervision before the birth of her child,
and suitable care during confinement.
But she must have also nourshing food
and sufficient rest ami freedom from
anxiety in other words, decent living
conditions."
Then the bureau has been concerned
with the protection of the child himself
from prematura employment. It has
published all the child labor laws in the
United States and has completed a re
port on the administration of the em
ployment certificate system in Xew York
state. In commenting upon the new fed
eral child labor law as marking a distinct
advance in the attitude of this nation
toward that one-third of its population
which is under 16 years of age, Miss
Lathrop says:
"Merely keeping the breath of life in
children is valueless to the nation unless
they are brought on to adult life trained
masters of their full powers of body and
mind. The law is a national measure and
all attainable information for a better
understanding of the ways in which the
children it sets free from labor may be
started in life should be furnished by a
national study."
"It is a matter of speculation as to
what proportion of children at work are
dependent upon their own earnings or
support families in whole or in part.
Also the number of dependent children
now supported by public and private funds
is unknown. In fact," Miss Lathrop says,
"our ignorance of the whole field of de
pendency is great." The report gives fig
ures about Philadelphia indicating that
the majority of dependent, children are
members of families anil the question of
protecting them is a question of family
structure and support. Preliminary work
toward a study of dependency has been
done by the bureau, and Miss Iathrop
expresses the hope that Congress may di
rect the children's bureau to make a spe
cial inquiry into the condition of the
children to be affected by the federal
law.

HECKLE THE
PRESIDENT
Suffragists Flaunted Yellow
Flag in the House -Yesterday
WHILE PRESIDENT WAS
READING MESSAGE
Shown as He Began Address
to Congress Was Quickly
Torn Down by a Page
Washington, Dec. 6. The first demon
stration by suffragist, such as "heckled''
the Hritish House of Commons in the
past, occurred in Congress here yester
day while President Wilson was read
ing his annual message to a joint ses
sion of the House and Senate.
Soon after the president had begun
speaking a big yellow silk banner was
unfurled from the House gallery by a
group of suffrage sympathizers. It bore
the inscription:
"Mr. President, what will you do for
woman suffrage?"
The banner was about four feet square,
tho lettering in black.
The appearance of the banner created
a decided stir among the Senators and
representatives on the lloor ami crowds
jamming the galleries gapped in amaze
ment. Foreign diplomats turned curious
eyes upon the fluttering piece of silk.
Then dames (irillin, a page, went down
in history as the youth to drag down the
first suffrage battle tlag unfurled in the
halls of Congress. He hurried down the
aisle amid senators and representatives
on the fioor, and, jumping in the air,
grasped the banner with one hand and
pulled it down.
Mrs. Wilson was sitting in the execu
tive box with other members of the fam
ily, and watching the president closely
when the suffrage Hag was unfurled.
There was just a trace of surprise on
the faces of the suffragists as their ban
ner went fluttering down. A slight mur
mur swept through the House, but quiet
was immediately restored and the pres
ident continued his speech without being
interrupted. He concluded his address at
1:18 o'clock, and went directly to the
office of Speaker ' Clark, where be met
the speaker and Senators Stbne and Reed
and Representative Igoe.
The unfurling of -the banner had been
carefully planned. Immediately after the
demonstration pamphlets were passed
out by women in the corridors giving
printed details of just what happened
in so far as J he women were concerned.
Thi printed information included the
names of the women who unfurled the
banner.
They were Mrs. John Rogers of Xew
York, "chairman of the National Advis
ory committee of the Congressional un
ion; Mrs. William Colt, New York, rep
resentative of the council; Mrs. Florence
Bayard Hilles of Wilmington, Del., chair
man of the Delaware branch, and Mrs.
Anna Lowenberg of Philadelphia, vice
chairman of the Pennsylvania branch
of the Congresional union; Dr. Caroline
K. Spencer of Colorado Springs, secretary
of the Colorado branch of the National
Woman's party; ami Miss Mary G. Ken
dall of Baltimore, who campaigned in
Oregon for the Woman's party.

REMEDY FOR NEURASTHENIA
Neurasthenia is a condition of exhaus
tion of the ncrrous system. The causes
are varied. Continuous work, mental
or physical, without proper vacation
periods, without projier attention to
diet and exercise, also worry over tho
struggle for success, are tho most .win
inon causes. Kxcesscs of almost any
kind may produce it. Some diseases,
like the grin, will cause neurasthenia.
So also will a severe shock, intense
anxiety or grief.
The symptoms are ovetsensitiveness,
irritability, a disposition to worry over
trifles, headache, possibly nausea
Tho treatmeiiiris one of nutrition of
the nerve cells, requiring a non-alcoholic
tonic. As tho nerves get their
nourishment from the blood the treat
jiient must he directed towards build
ing up tno blood. Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills act directly on the blood and have
proved of the greatest benefit in many
cases of neurasthenia. A tendency to
anemia, or bloodlessness, shown by
nost neurasthenic patients, is also cor
rected by these tonic pills.

SILT-LADEN STREAMS.
Method of Measurement of Interest to
Hydraulic Engineers.
Hydraulic engineers who may have to
measure streams carrying heavy loads of
silt will be interested in a report on the
results obtained by the I'nited States
geological survey, department of the in
terior, in measuring the tlow of San Juan
river, one of the tributaries of the Col
orado. The headwaters of the San Juan and
those of its principal northern tribut
taries lie in the high mountains of south
western Colorado and resemble those of
other mountain streams. Their heaviest
run-off conies late in the spring, when
tho snow is melting. These higher
streams carry little silt. The lower trib
utaries of the San Juan, including those
flowing from southern Utah and north
eastern Arizona, drain a rather barren
mesa that is being eroded raidly, and
at times of Hood they bring down great
quantities of silt and sand. ' On wide,
shallow sections of the San Juan the ef
fect of the heavy load of silt is at times
visible- in the movement commonly
known as the "sand wave." Mr. K. C.
Pierce, the author of the report men
tioned, discusses the dilliculties of meas
uring the streams containing heavy loads
of silt and describes the sand waves of
the San Juan as follows:
"The usual length of the sand wave,
crest to crest, on the deeper sections of
the river is 15 to 20 feet, and the height,
trough to crest, is about three feet. How
ever, waves of a height of at least six
feet were observed. The sand waves
are not continuous, but follow a rhyth
mic movement. Their appearance, as
seen on the lower San Juan, is as fid
lows; At one moment the stream is
running smoothly for a distance of per
haps several hundred yards. Then sud
denlv a number of waves, usually from
six to ten, appear. They reach their full
size lu a few seconds, now tor pernaps
two or three minutes, then suddenly
disappear. Often for perhaps half a
minute before disappearing the crests of
the waves go through a combined move
ment, accompanied bv a roarinn sound.
On first appearance it seems that the
waves occupy fixed positions, mil oy
watching them closely it is seen that
they move slowly upstream. In the nar
row parts of the stream the waves may
reach nearly the width of the river, but
in ihe wider narts thev occunv smaller
proportional widtk. I'sually they are
at right angles to tne axis oi me sueani,
but at some places, particularly in the
wider parts of the river, they sudden
ly assume a diagonal position moving
rather rapidly across the stream in the
direction toward which the upstream
side of the wave has turned."
FOOD INQUIRY BILL PASSES.
Committee Will Investigate Prices in
District of Columbia.
Washington, Dec. (5. First congres
jinnal action toward relief from the high
cost of living was taken yesterday when,
upon a motion by representative iveating
of Colorado, the House concurred in a
Spnate amendment to his Mil providing
for an investigation of the cost of living
among wage earners of the District of
Columbia.
The bill having leen passed by both
Houses, now govs to President Wilson
for his signature. Six thousand dollars
is appropriated for the investigation.
Bluejackets to Visit Panama CanaL
The bluejackets of the Atlantic, fleet
will have an opportunity next spring to
visit the Panama canal, and see the
wonderful engineering undertaking. Ac
cording to the sehi-dule of the Atlantic
fleet announced at the navy department,
the battleship force, the cruiser force, the
active destroyers and the mine and train
force are due to make a five-day visit
to the canal during the" period of licet
exercises between March . 17 and 26.
Thousands of young men making their
first cruise will therefore be afforded
the rare chance of viewing for them
selves the construction and operations of
the canal. While no formal arrangements
have vet been made it is expected that
a program will lie prepared by the canal
authorities working in conjunction with
Admiral Mayo of the Atlantic fleet,
whereby all the men will be given facil
ities for making a sightseeing trip across
the isthmus. This was done four years
ago when the big fleet made a sight
seeing trip to the isthmus.
The construction of the canal across
the Isthmus of Panama takes rank as
one of the greatest feats of human skill;
for over four hundred years it has been
the dream of adventurous people of Eu
rope and America. Indeed, since the day
of the first white explorers in the new
world this project has been considered an
ultimate necessity. The dilliculties in
the way, however, were found too great
until the project was taken hold of in
dead earnest by the American govern
ment in 1!M4, when the United .States
acquired possession of a lO-mile strip
running across the'isthmus known as the
canal zone. Thousands of lives and
millions of treasures were sacrificed in the
attempt to fori a passage through the
backbone of the American continent.
The cost to the I'nited States from
the. time it acquired possession to the
dar of completion, including $.Htjmo.rN0

and to the republic of Panama for prop
ertr and franchises, approximated i'SH,

dish, season with salt, pepper and plenty
of butter, then set in the oven for the
butter to -soak in. Heat in a small pan
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, with one

winter is novel, pretty and exceedingly
practical. It provides that a celluloid
bangle, set with" rhinestones, can bo used
as a muff-keeper. The bangle is attached
to the muir by means of a double satin
ribbon of narrow width which exactly
matches the mull; the celluloid of the
bangle can usually be had to match the
mutr also. This ribbon is about a quar
ter of a yard long and is sewed at one
end to the lining of the muff and at the
other end ia knotted over the bangle.
The bangle then is secure on the arm
and the muff can dangle merrily in this
way and the bands will be free when
one wishes.
Muffs this season will be carried in the
evening and should match the wrap or
its trimming. This is a sensible fashion,
for it is an innovation in comfort and
one that it is hoped will be maintained
for every winter season.
Preferred among new muff shapes is
the one perfectly round in form, called
the canteen muff. This is! mostly chosen
in medium size; but melon-shaped, half
round and fancy flat muffs will also be
seen. Many are likely to lc devised of
some fabric and merely a, band or so of
fur, or imitation fur, which is now so
well made that it answers nicely for
many occasions.
The Linen Closet.
Nothing is so satisfactory to the fem
inine heart as a well stocked linen closet.
Lucky is the woman who has a special
linen closet built into her home but if
the masculine builder of the house has
not provided for such an arrangement it
is quite possible to get along with a
trunk or even a well constructed box.
The next best tl nig to a linen closet is a
tall chest of drawers. This should be
placed in as light a place as possible and
should have the shelves painted white.
The linen closet should be carefully aired
and dusted and the linen kept in orderly
piles, carefully labeled. Clean linen fresh
from the laundry should be placed at the
bottom of the pile so that there may be
rotation in its use.
Now that the preserving season is over
and rush of the holidays is not quite
upon us it is a good plan to look over
the sto'k of linen and see what renova
tion is needed. Probably you will find
that some of your sheets are becoming
worn. Most economical housekeepers are
well versed in the art of giving a sheet a
new lease of life by turning the edges
inward, but not all of them know that if
a flat seam is made with two rows of
sticthinsr the sheet will be much more
comfortable to lie on. If the middle part
of the sheet is badly worn it. will prob
ably be best to cut it away before hem
ming the sides and make the sheet to fit
a smaller sized bed or to make the extra
slips which are such a help in keeping
the pillows clean. Sheets which are worn
thin hut are not torn should be kept for
use in case of illness.
Tablecloths require great skill in mend
ing. Weak places should be darned be
fore any hide appears and threads from
old linen should lie used for this purpose,
as the new will be too strong. Darns
are made from the wrong side and tiny
loops should he left at the end of each
tiTn to allow for shrinking. Tablecloths
which have gone too far for mending may
be cut up into carving cloths, plate and
glass doilies. If you crochet you can
make these madeover articles really love
ly by edging them all with a narrow
liep "worked directly into the cloth.
