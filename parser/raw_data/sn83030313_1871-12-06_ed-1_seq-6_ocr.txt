Wo called attention yesterday, in comment
ing on Mr. Boutwell's report, to the fact that
the financial policy of the Secretary Is just the
same as It has been all along, and that the
modifications be recommends really amount to
very little. This policy is to raise an enor
mous revenue and to bare in his hands all the
time a vast surplus for paying ofT the public
debt. It is his all-absorbing idea. He makes
everything bear upon and depend upon it.
Even the credit of the government, in bis
opinion, canuot be sustained without that. It
is the Alpha and Omega of all his financial
knowledge and policy. Truly, it may be
said, he is a man of one idea. No
miser ever clung to bis money-bags
more tenaciously than Mr. Boutwell
cliugs to the revenue system whioh keeps the
Treasury chest gorged and a hundred mil
lions or wore of dollars always unemployed
in his possession. The reduction of taxes he
reluctantly suggests hardly amounts to as
much as the prospective increase of income
from t'ae natural growth of the country. If
Congress should go no further in reducing
taxation than be recommends, there will be at
the end of the current fiscal year as large a
surplus as there was at the end of the last and
as there is at present. He is so wedded to
his notions that he lags far behind the Presi
dent on tho question of reducing taxation.
The language of the President's Message
evinces a desire for more sweeping measures
in relieving tho people of burdensome taxes
than Mr. Boutwell's report. The Secretary,
it is evident, Is not In accord with the Presi
dent on this question.
Taxes to the amount of a hundred millions
a yoar could be taken off, and thon there would
be left an ample revenue for ali the demands
upon the government as well as a suf
ficient sum for paying off as much of
the principal of the debt as is necessary.
Aocording to .Mr. Boutw,ell's own estimates
the revenue for the current fiscal yoar will
amount to over three hundred and sixty-five
millions. The Grst quarter has yielded more
than one hundred and seven millions. Every
one knows the Sjorotary always greatly under
estimates the income. Ho did so last year.
Does any one suppose the revenue will fall off
from a hundred and seven millions the first
quarter of the year to eighty-six millions for
each of the remaining three quarters? Yet
that is what the Secretary has estimated. Wo
have no doubt the revenue will be four hun
dred millions, or little short of that. Now,
udinitling that the expenditures will reach the
sum Mr. Boutwell has set down, two hundred
and ninety-three millions of dollars, a bun
died millions of (axes might be swept away
and still, as wo believe, there would be a sur -
plus to apply to the liquidation of the debt.
But there ought uot to be any such expendi
tures. The Interest on tho debt will be I
less than a hundred and twenty-four mil- I
lions. There would be left then about j
a hundred aud seventy millions for current !
expenses^g^jyfl of interest ^ th* debt. ]
The whole cost of the government twelve years I
ago was little more than a third of this umAnnt.
To spend a hundred and seventy millions a year
exclusive of the interest on the debt is gross ex
travagance and leads to corruption and demor
alization. Then the reduction of a hundred mil
lions or so of taxation would necessarily lessen
considerably the cost of government In col
lecting tho revjnue. In fact, the revenno
system might be so simplified as to save many
millions a year and send off a host or govern
ment employes to productive industry.
Mr. Boutwell is mistaken in the viows he
expresses about a large revenue and an enor
mous surplus to pay off the debt being neces
sary to sustain the credit of the government
and to facilitate funding the debt at lower in
I to rest. The consolidated and interminable
1 debt of Great Britain would not stand higher
if changed into time securities and put under
a process of rapid liquidation. The very
permanent character of it gives it addi
tional value for investment. If there
were any question of the ability of the
Uuited States to pay the iuterest on the debt
the credit of the government would suffer.
But no one can doubt that ability. Nobody
Imagines this great and rich country will not
pay promptly the interest or even the princi
pal in due time. The credit of the government
would be improved and our securities rise
higher, in fact, by a good and economical
revenue system and by a more gradual liqui
dation of the debt. The truth is, we fear,
that the Secretary is more Intent on keeping
up a large revenue for the purpose of afford
ing protection to the New England manufac
turers and of aiding a host of Treasury cor
morants than of promoting the interests of tbe
1 muss of the people.
In everything wc see the same principle of
protection and lavish spending of public
money. Tho Secretary's absurd recommenda
tion to give subsidies for shipbuilding accords
with his policy in other respects. We regret
to see that the President has fallen into this
dangerous protection trap. If one kind of
industry is to be subsidized wby not another ?
Why not all ? Apply the principle
generally, and no one will fail to
see the injustice aud absurdity. To grant
such a subsidy would be simply to rob the
mass of the people for the benefit of a few.
Let the government do what it can to promote
shipbuilding by takmg off duties on the ma
terials, by reducing taxes generally so as to
make living and the cost of labor lest, and by
any other reasonable means, but uot by taking
money directly out of the Treasury and pockets
of the people. T.ie proper way to Increase
our mercantile marine is to abolish or suspend
the registry law, and permit our merchants
and capitalists to buy ships, particularly iron
ocean steamers, in the best market. Then we
should soon have a splendid fleet of ocean
steamships, and the profits of freight and pas
sage to the amount of tens of millions a year
would come to this country instead of going
to for-igners.
Mr. Boutwell's syndicate business, in placing
a small portion ol the new loan, so-called, at
a great cost to the Treasury, and his proposi
tion to increase this cost, or the percentage
to favored bankers, for disposing of the rest,
are in keepine with the reckless extravaganc
which characterizes his management of the
national finances. Incapable as be is be ap
pears to be conscious of this extravagance,
tor a large portion of his report to Congress is
nothing but a labored deleuqy of big syodjgtto
plan of operation. The only really (food
feature in bis propositions for disposing of a
portion of the new reduced per cents of the
debt is that to foroe the national banks to
take these securities. That is just, for the
banks hare most valuable privileges and
make a vast sum annually out of the govern
ment and people. Another ridiculous idea ad
vanced by Mr. Boutwell is that of compelling
the people and banks of the Pacific coast to
make paper money their circulating medium.
While be pretends to be anxious to bring
about specie payments he actually contem
plates forcing the Californians, who have a
specie circulation, to abandon that and to take
a paper currency. How long are we to have
such an incapable and narrow-minded Secre
tary of the Treasury? With an able man, a
statesman, in that position, what great fi nan
cial measures and reforms might be carried
out! No country was ever in such a favorable
and prosperous condition for attaining great
results. Nothing but the right man is wanted.
There Is no trouble about the revenue, re
sources or credit of the country. It remains
only to know bow to use these and to tax the
industry of the people as little as possible.
President Thiers and the French Assembly.
Our cable despatches this morning regard
ing the state of affairs in France are more
than usually interesting. President Thiers, it
seems, has not yet handed in his message. It
is not denied that the outlines of the message
which came across the cable on Saturday last
are substantially correct. But for some cause
or other the handing in of the message is still
delayed. It would seem that the main cause
of the delay is the determination of the Princes
of the House of Orleans, particularly the Due
d'Aumale and the Prince de Joinville, to make
use of what they call their rights and take
their seats in the Assembly. The status of
the Orleans Princes is Baid to be the leading
question in the Assembly. The President,
who has been for some hours oloseted with the
Princes, is said to be opposed to their taking
their seats in present circumstances. Ac
cording to our latest aocounts they are deter
mined, in spite of M. Thiers, to make full use
of their lawful rights and take their seats.
The Left, it seems, is quite as determined as
the Princes of the House of Orleans. If the
Priuces are allowed to tjike their seats the
Left says there must first of all be a general
amnesty. The simple fact that the President
has not yet formally handed in bis message
justifies all that we have said regarding the
gravity of the situation in France. The situa
tion is really critical, but it is not yet time to
comment upon it at any length. As things
now are France promises to give us a fresh
sensation.
A U'pneral Amncny.
TIjc President, in bis Message, on the sub
ject of a general amnesty, Bays:?"More than
six years baviug elapsed since the last hostile
gun was fired between the armies then
arrayed aguinst each other?one for the per
petuation and the other for the destruction of
the Uniou?it may be well considered whether
it is not now time that the disabilities (against
certain classes of rebels holding office,
national or Slate), imposed by the fourteenth
amendment should be removed." Then he
says:?"I do not see the advantage or pro
priety of excluding men from office merely
because they were, before the rebellion, of
standing and character sufficient to be elected
to positions requiring them to take oaths to
support the constitution," Ac. But then,
aft r suggesting a general amnesty, says our
Chief Magistrate, "If there are any great
criminals, distinguished above all others for
the part they took in opposition to the govern
ment, they might, in the judgment of Con
gress, be excluded from such an amnesty."
No, Mr. President; let there be no exclu
sion. Let the amnesty be universal and con
clusive?let it embrace Jeff Davis, Breckin
ridge, Stephens, Toombs, and all tbs men of
that class, and the men of all the intermediate
grades down to the poorest Sandhillers pressed
into the rebel service?and let us have the
books closed on the rebellion. That is the
amnesty which now should be passed by Con
gress, and we hope I bat when the question is
tried the required two-thirds vote will be
secured in each House in favor of the bill.

Paris has been again visited by fire. An
extensive conflagration occurred yesterday in
the business arcades or (be Hotel du Louvre.
The storekeepers who trade in the place suf
fered immense losses, but the firemen obtained
control of the flames belore the Louvre
Palace sustained injury. The advent of fire
in a great city is an unfortunate event at any
time. It is particularly unfortunate in Paris
just now, and still more truly unfortu
nate that it should have visited the Louvre
arcades. It will alarm the people. Still worse,
it will bring them heavy pecuniary losses at a
time when they are very badly prepared to
sustain the burden. It will interrupt their
trade at the very moment when it had a chance
to recuperate?the season of Christmas and
that of the holiday trade to and after New Year.
All this is bad for Thiers. The unfortunate
tradesmen of the Louvre will growl against
their "ill luck." They will hug their sorrow
almost to superstition, and most likely exclaim,
"When the Emperor and young Prince came
to pnrchase of nn at their latest Christmas in
Paris we were happy in our families and fro*
from the fire fiend."

There was a lively skirmish in the House
yesterday, which resulted in a defeat of the
administration forces. It arose out of the re
commendation by the President, in his annual
Message, that the telegraph system should be
united with the postal service of the country,
after the plan that has been found to work so
successfully in Great Britain, Belgium and
other European nations. In the general dis
tribution of the Message the portion relating
to this subject was to be referred to a select
committee. At least such was the disposition
of it contemplated by Mr. Dawes, chairmau of
the Committee on Ways and Means, and
leader of the House; but the resolution of
refcrcnoe was attacked by Mr. Randall, of
Pennsylvania, one of the guerilla leaders
on the democratic side, wf?o was immediately
supported by Mr. Farnsworth, of Illinois, a
free lance in all party conflicts, but who is
generally to be found battling against his own
party majority. These skirmishers were re
inforcod by some of the big guns of the oppo
sition?Messrs. Niblack, Eldridge and Beck?
and even General Banks, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, turned his
artillery against his colleague and his party.
On the administration side the fight was con
ducted by Mr. Dawes single-handed, till at
the close and when the day was irrevocably
lost Mr. Garfield, chairman of the Committee
on Appropriations, came to the rescue, but
all to no purpose. The blows aimed at the
project were too powerful and well directed to
be either botne harmlessly or evaded, and
when the skirmish was ended and the result
reached it was found that the administration
party was defeated by a vote of one hundred
and five to ninety-eight. The proposition
for a select committee was rejected, and the
whole subject was referred (o the standing
Committee on Appropriations, which is re
garded as decidedly unfavorable to the pro
ject of letting the government take charge of
the telegraphic business of tho country. It
may well be imagined that the democracy,
which voted as a unit on the question, is
elated at its triumph.
In the other wing of the Capitol, however,
it had no such cause for jubilation; but, on
the contrary, it sustained a crushing, disheart
ening and merciless defeat. Senator Blair, of
Missouri?Frank Blair, as he is more
familiarly known?mado an effort to
get taken up for disoussion and action
the resolution which be bad introduced
on Monday reflecting on the President's action
in establishing martial law in some of the
Southern States, and in bringing the pious Ku
Klux to a realizing sense of the power of the
federal government. But Frank was stopped
in his wild career of arraigning the President,
the Senate refusing, by a vote of forty-five to
eleven, to take up or consider his resolution.
So that the repulse which the Presidential
policy sustained in the one House was more
than counterbalanced by the endorsement
which it received in the other. The Congres
sional campaign opens spiritedly and prom
ises to be full of stirring events.
The Insurrection in Cuba.
Tbe latest news from Cuba is of a more
peaceful character than could bare been ex
pected after the late scenes of blood and vio
lence. The bratal rage of the volunteers bos
apparently spent itself, and the oity of Havana
is resuming her former aspect. The report
from Madrid of the removal of Captain
General Valmaseda seems to be unfounded,
for, according to our Havana despatch,
he is to remain the ruler of Cuba,
Whatever charges of cruelty might
be brought against Count Valmaseda,
tbe responsibility for the late massacre of the
unfortunate students more properly belongs
to his deputy, General Crespo, who allowed
himself to be intimidated by tbe threats of
a ruffianly mob, wbioh might have been
resisted by a man of firmness and decision.
The advioes from the seat of the insurrec
tion are largely in favor of tbe Spanish
authorities. Some allowance being made for
Spanish exaggeration, It cannot be doubted
that, with the arrival of tbe large reinforce
ments sent from Spain, the chances of the
CubaD patriots are becoming very slim indeed.
Tbe telegraph lines are being and have already
in part been restored in the districts which
were but lately the principal seat of the strug
gle, and the fact that these telegraph lines re
main undisturbed is considered a proof of the
decline of the insurrection. The wholesale
surrender of prominent Cubans, whose names
are given in tbe despatch, adds confirmation
to this report. The news on tbe whole is of
a hopeful natnre, and, whether independent or
under Spanish rnle, there may yet be better
times in store for the unlortunate island.
The Bkitish Annexation of tor South
African Diamond Fields.?The South Afri
can diamond fields cover sn extensive and
beautiful country on the great Orange River
and its tributaries, hundreds of miles north of
the British colonial settlements of the Cape of
Good Hope. But those diamond diggings
have drawn to that region an immense emi
gration which will evidently crystallise into a
powerful civilised community?a la Cali
fornia?and so England, taking time by the
forelock, has annexed those diamond dig
gings to her South African colonies. Very
good. Those diamond regions, occupied by a
powerful Anglo-Saxon community, will con
tribute so much more to tbe general trade of
tbe civilized world, of which we shall have our
shars. Let England and Franc9 go ahead
with their African colonies. The field is
large, open and inviting on all sides, and in
tbe heart of Africa, and, in a thousand forms,
tbe profits of these enterprises of building up
its waste places are diffusad over the whole
face of th e globe.
The Ltnohburo Republican (democratic)

On Monday last the new Grand Jury, sum
moned to serve for the December term of the
Court of General Sessions, appeared in Court,
and were discharged by Judge Bedford until the
19th inst, the old jury having been held over
until the 18th Inst, by the extension of
the November term till that date. It will be
remembered that this course was decided upon
by Judge Bedford in order to give the Grand
Jurors who have been engaged in investigat
ing the city frauds an ample opportunity to
complete their work and bring the
offenders to justice. In order to prove
his earnest determination to accomplish
this desirable end, Judge Bedford yesterday
stated that, should longer time be needed by
the present jury, he should most assuredly
order a still longer extension of the November
term, "being fully convinced that now is
the time to probe all these matters to the
very core, irrespective of whomsoever the
blow may fall upon." From this it will be
seen that District Attorney Garvin and the
Grand Jury will have all the opportunity they
can wish or require to thoroughly complete
the important investigation to which they are
urged by the fearless and impartial
Judge, and it is for them to second
the efforts of Judge Bedford to
redeem the Bcandal that now rests upon the
city, and to bring to oriminal punishment the
men who have so shamefully plundered the
people. It has become quite evident that an
effort is to be made by the politicians to defeat
the ends of justice and to screen the
guilty parties from the consequences
of their crimes. Already hints begin
to be thrown out of the difficulty of bringing
such offences as breaches of trust criminally
home to those who have committed them^ but
if the men who, through fraud and forgery,
have stripped the City Treasury are to escape
unpunished, or to be subjected only to civil
suits for the recovery of a tithe of their
plunder, then law and justice are mere
mockeries. Judge Bedford's determined action
bids fair to upset the schemes of the politi
cians, and to give us at last what we have not
yet had?an earnest effort to prosecute an
investigation into the frauds in good faith,
without regard 10 political expediency, aud to
bring the guilty to the bar of justioe, irre
spective of persons or parties.
Yesterday the acting Grand Jury appeared
in Court and made a presentment in regard to
the Hall of Records in the City Park, where
arc deposited the title deeds to most of the
real cslate in the city, with the maps and
other evidences pertaining thereto. The
building is pronounced to be an unfit place for
the deposit of such important documents
dilapidated, not fireproof, and without any
sufficient security against robbery. The Jury
consider that a fireproof budding, properly
protected in every respeot, should be at onco
secured, and they call the attention of the
Judge to the facts in order that he may take
such action as may be proper to insure a
speedy remedy. In the course of their pre
sentment the Grand Jury state that the recent
repairs and additions to the building are
found to have cost one hundred and sixty
thousand dollars, while a liberal estimate
fixes the value or the work done
at twenty-five thousand dollars. This
is so petty a swindle, however, io comparison
with the grand frauds committed in other
directions, as to be scarcely worthy of notice.
The want of a perfectly secure depository for
all the records of the Ragister's office, and
for all the documentary evidence of the trans
actions of the important city departmentSj
i especially that of finance, is certaiuly a great
evil. If the vouchers and warrants in the
keeping of the Comptroller had been thus
deposited when the city frauds were first
developed the people would have known
more than they do know about these disgrace
ful transactions. All vouchers for claims
against the city government should be made
in duplicate, and one copy shonld be deposited
in sucb a building as tbe Grand Jury suggest.
This should be providod for in the new charter,
and the erection of a Hall of Records, fire
proof apd burglar-proof, should be authorized
at ouce by the authorities having power in the
matter.
A State fob Our Red Brethren.?The
Indian Territory?for many years occupied by
the Gherokees, Cboctaws, Chickasaws, Scmi
noles, Ac., in their several reservations?lies
west of Arkansas, and has Kansas on the
north and Texas on the south. It is a magnifi
cent, rich and beautifully watered country of
seventy-one thousand square miles in extent,
or over one-half larger than the State of New
York. The Indians occupying this delightful
and productive region have become completely
civilized. They cultivate the soil, they live in
comfortable houses, tbey dress like white men,
they have schools and churches and a federal
council, and they give less trouble to the
general government than any other Territory
of the United States. General Grant, in his
Message, suggests that these people might be
advantageously admitted to the dignities of a
State government. And why not? They have
room enough in their ample territory for all
the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains.
Bundle them all in and give them a lift, and
give them a chance as a State, and we dare
say that as Indians they will finally disappear
only in being whitened to the prevailing
American type.
PROGRI88 OF TUB PRESS.?The HERALD Was
yesterday a marvel of a newspaper. It con
tained, beside the full text of the President's
Message and the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury, ample and comprehensive
abstracts of the reports of ali the Cabinet
Ministers, as well as those of the subordinate
departments of the government. Matter
which in former years would occupy the col
umns of newspapers for days and weeks was
here cleared off in a single issue, and that,
too, without trespassing too greatly upon the
space usually allotted for general news. The
Herald of yesterday was a volume in itself?
a compendious history of the official doings
of the great republic for the past year. Verily,
this is the age of newspaper progress.

The Herald correspondent in Madrid far^
nishes a letter, which we print in another
page, descriptive of a scene which took plaoe
recently in the Spanish Cortes. The scene
was stormy in the extreme?a regular tempest,
in fact. The cause of all the confusion arose
from somebody saying that something was
said at some Cabinet meeting regarding the
sale of Cuba. This was deemed sufficient
ground for a grand display of oratorical turbu
lence, in which unionists, progressists, Car.
lists and republicans took a part. Personal!,
ties were indulged in to a disgraoeful extent.
Sefiors Navarro and Zorrilta were the first to
lead off in a duel of words; then old Admiral
Topete was drawn into the quarrel; Figueras
could not remain silent, but had to make
a speech, which did not serve to quiet
matters; then Topete again had to make
explanations, after which Canovas del Cas
tillo entered into the fray and reopened an old
sore by referring to the abandonment of St.
Domingo. On this the Cuban question was
dropped, and the members, now fired up to a
patriotic pitch of excitement, "demanded the
reading of the list of those who voted against
the abandonment of St. Domingo." The re
publican leader Figueras urged on this de
mand until finally the most uproarious scene
ensued, ending with the demand being com
plied with, and the list was read. The Cuban
question was again taken up. "Who offered
to sell the Ever Faithful Isle?" No one.
Zorrilla spurned such a thought. Topete
would even go ont to Cuba to hold it for
Spain; but he would not go under the orders
ofSefior Malcampo or Caballero de Rodas.
Other members spoke in equally patriotio
strains, and the unanimous opinion seemed to
be that the only price at which Cuba could be
bought was seas of Spanish blood. The whole
discussion was intended to draw from the
Ministers and ex-Ministers of present
and past Cabiuets what course, if any,
was pursued in regard to the sale of Cuba.
Topete said that propositions had been made
for the parcbase of the island, bnt by whom
he did not mention. The proposition, he said,
was never discussed in Cabinet council; but
even this explanation was not sufficient.
There appeared to be a degree of reticence on
the part of the friends of Zorrilla which helped
to irritate his opponents and render the dis
cussion bitter in the extreme. This was ob
servable throughout the whole session, and
the explanations, although full, did not tend
to allay the bitterness of the discussion.
There were many respectable persons, it was
stated, who had no faith in the salvation of
Cuba?an announcement not at all calculated to
please the Cortes. The scene which our cor
respondent describes is not by any means an
exceptional one in the Spanish Cortes. Wo
have on past occasions bad to chronicle like
displays, and we feel moreover that this will
not be tbo last. Cuba, if we are to judge from
this latest manifestation, is not foe sale, and
Spain will still continue to send troops to the
tropics to endeavor to bring the Cubans to
subjection.
The Inroma Tax?l<et the Prevent C'oo
(real Altolinb Ir.
Congress baa already tukeu the subject of
the Income tax in hand, and two or three bills
looking to its abolishment were introduced in
each House on Monday. A more important
movemont towards its abolishment, however,
is contained in the suggestion of tho President
in his Message, that all taxes from internal
SOiirces^je abolished, except ihose on spiritu-'
ous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco and
stamps, and in the conclusive statement of the
Secretary of the Treasury, that it is practica
ble to dispense with all internal taxes, except
those mentioned, and still secure a revenue of
a hundred and ten million dollars from inter
nal taxation alone. We have, therefore, not
only a cheerful sentiment in Congress in favor
of the abolition of the income tax, but also the
recommendation of the President, and what
may be remarked as a clear conversion from
direct opposition to it, the free acquiescence
of Secretary Boutwell.
The sentiment of the last Congress was
strongly in favor of its abolition, and such a
measure was only defeated by thecUUy dally
ing devices of the few in opposition. The ,
House, through the influence of one or two*
dissatisfied members, failed to pass a Senate
measure on the subject on the flimsy pretext
that ils constitutional privileges were imposed
upon by the action of the Senate in first pro
posing a measure which in the view of those
wiseacres should have first originated in the
House because it provided for the raising of
money. Similar filibustering movements suc
ceeded in delaying the passage of the measure
in the Senate, and, indeed, the bill, after being
kicked about like a football all through the
session, was finally prevented from passing
mainly by tho adroit finessing of a minority.
Now, however, something less like burlesque
legislation is demanded on this subject. The
people complain grievously of the burden of
the tax, as well as of its inquisitorial and.
odious character. They demand that straight
forward legislation shall be had upon the sub
ject by tho present Congress, and that the tax
shall be abolished.
A Prisoner at Jeffehson Market died
yesterday from the effects of a freesing which
be got in the prisoners' box in the court room.
There is no fire in tho room, the windows are
all broken in, and from a tank in one corner
of the room water is continually dropping and
forming ice on the floor. That a court room
in (his city should be in such an on rageous
condition as this is almost incredible; but the
blame is to be laid, doubtless, to that far
reaching and thorough-searching reform -
movement which not only stops the sale of
city bonds abroad and the completion of
necessary public works at home, but even
estops the pay of daily laborers on the streets
and refuses to furnish coal for the use of tho
police court rooms.

throws out some very curious hints on this
subject, and also on the general subject of
Spanish slavery in the islands of Cuba and

and human rights to our citizens as slave
holders in foreign ports, and we bopa tho
