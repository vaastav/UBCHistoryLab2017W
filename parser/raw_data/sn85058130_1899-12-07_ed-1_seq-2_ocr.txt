much satisfaction Ben he leader of
the extreme party admit this and the
announcement that there will be no
l government has cleared away the
i germent
cloud that have ben hanging over
the Cuban poltcal situation The
Lucha alone among the paper still
favors a civil governorship
General Colaso says The mege
vill pacify the country The presidents
dents statements are not very con
crete but if cpngress guarantees the
independence ot Cuba we need not ask
for any specification a to the time for
the removal of the American troops al
though everybody would be glad to seethe
the black troops go because of the ex
cess they commit
Cuba fear the administration but
they do not fear congress The admin
Istiation represents thc trusts Although
though Cubans are as good business
men as mericans they could not com
pete with Icms enorous power of the
trust which by creating monopole
would eventually enslave the wrklng
man We wIsh to see each man owning
some property at least enough to make
i worth his while to behave a a good
citizen Instead of going to the woods
Congress Will G urer
Gualberto Gomez sid I had ex

Count yon Buelow regards the message
sage as an enunciation memorable In
th development of GermanAmerican
friendship The warm tone in which
the president speaks of our mutual re

pression and one may be sure that the
sympathies exhibited by the presIdent

rocated Politically everything between
the two countrIes Is serene and there
Is nothing that disturbs the entente

IIiY FIEIIECME A CATHOlC

DR DE COSTAA RECENT CON
DE
VT MAKES EXPLANATION
Church of Rome Stands Before Peo
ple ns Solitary Defender of Bible
I Its Integrity and Entirety
Nw York DecfTheRev Benja
min F Dc Costa 1iose r eptOn Into
the Roman Catholc church took place
on Sunday last has written an article
which is to b published In Catholic
papers in which he explaIns his re
sons for the step he ha taken
In beginning Dr Costa thanks God
for giving hIm grace to overcome the
deep prejudice Implanted by false edu
cation and declares that his change
of belief Is not the work of a day or a
year but began very long ago I I
The sad fallen estate of post refor t
mation belief lie adds has forced
I Upon me a reconsideration of princ i j I
pie the result being the conviction
that the reformation was not based I
upon any true foundations I
Dr De Costa then alludes to the
passing of studious anglicans over to I I
the Catholic church
The current he says Is as steady 1 I
a the fpw of the gulf stream and
he refers to Cardinal Newman and others I I
ers who have forsook Protestants
for the church of Rome He declares I
however I the gifted author of Lead I I
Kindly Light had never spoken and I I
If Manning Faber and TUberforce had I I
never lived my mOde of thinking must
infallibly have led mc to accept the
faith
I do not however says Dr De
Costa propose to offer an apology for
entering the Catholic church Stand
ing in the midst of modern religious
s stems toppling to their fall like col
umns In the temple of Karnac no de
tense need be offered foracccpt a1 I
firm and unnaIen Cltnolc latin
Dr De Costa the goes on to speak
of the position of Scriptures In the
I teaching system of the Catholic church
He declares that the church of Rome
stands before Englshspeaking people
and Protestants anywhere as the
unique and solitary defender of the
Bible In its integrity and entirety
The church proceeds Dr De Costa
never change her method of dealing
I with scIence In this city a scholar
should not allow his mind to become
I befogged The issue Is not simply one
of science or simple interpretation
I Primarily It Is the mystery of the In
I carnation that criticism puts on trial
The case If dogmatic I means a re
viskn of the Bible This the holy
Catholc church wi never approve
Dr De Costa denies however that
the authorities the Catholic church
are unfavorable to the circulation and
use of the Bible saying that It Is the
duty and rhle e oC Catholic scholars
to study the Bible thoroughly In the
original tongues
ProccEtlng to speale of the question
of papal infallibility Dr De Costa
Sals It is time fqr candid nonCatho
lies to learn thn rt notion ih it
infallibility Interfered with IndIvidual
liberty Is as truens that a rnariners
compass renders the sailor an abject
slave
In conclusion Drj De Costa says
Oi the Protestant theory Is no visible
church the only body being a mys
tical body 1n thd air On this theory
Christaniy has failed th emplr that
triumphed over the Roman empire has
lelshed This JS slmpl pessimism
Reformation relgion ism therefore of
fers no moral or intellectual outlook
for coming generations oIerf nQ moral
or intellectual outlook for comIng gen
ratons and leaves the world forced
at last to choose between rationalism
and the Catholic church I believe In

Seeretdry oC the Treasury Lman J
Gage made iublic today is his refer
ence and rlcommendatons regarding
financial mater Mr Gage says
The stat of the treasury exhibits I
degree of financial strength never be
fore equaled It places the government
In a posItion more favorable than has
before existed to take airy steps con
gress may consider wise toward Inaug
uratng needful improvements in the
currency or judIcious modifications in
the banking laws
There are poInts to which public
attention hU long been directed and
upon which legislative acton has been
earnestly desired These are first the
money standard and second a better
adaptation of our currency system to
the requirements of expanding trade
and industry Both of these questions
are of prime importance to our welbe
Ing as a people and demand the con
sideration which theIr Importance jU
tlfes Upon these two questons I feel
it my duty to speak with earnestness
FIrst as to the money standard
G61d now constitutes that standard I
is now and for many ear has been
the standard by which the values of all
commodities whether foreign or dOmes
tic have been measured or declared I
Is the standard to which reference has
been had in all contracts Ot undertJc
logs involving the future payment of
money I is the standard which test
the quality of value of the Intermediate
currency with which wages are paid
and all or nearly all of the mInor bus
ines affair of the people are carded n
Merits of Gold and Sliver
The debate over the relative merit
of gold and silver as the true and
proper money standard has been long
and exhaustive but while the discus
aba has continued the advanced na
tions of the earth one after the other
with hardly an exceptIon have adopt
ed gold a the more suitable for com
mercial needs Indeed I Is vIgorous
ly asserted and with truth that the
United States is In thIs very category
that our mpney standard Is goldand
with some show of reason It Is argued
that nothIng is required other than to
let thing alone Such a conclusion
however doe not commend itself to
the judgment of those to whom stabi
it In the future is not less Important
than good conditions in the present
I has long been the desire and hope
of many intellIgent and patrIotic cit
zens to secure needful and enduring
stability In the money standard by an
international agreement In regard to
gold and silver which would be erCt
ve to that end The realization oT that i
desire and hope seems now too remote 1
to justify present consideration but I
those who still cherIsh I shall offer it I
In objection to the acton above pro
posed it Is a sufficient answer to say
that stability on the gold standard is
the only stability now possible to us
and If the time should CCme hen in
I
I ternatoa agreement offers I safe and
desirable substitutIon the freedom oi
our representative form of government
I choice will give to our eoplc the liberty of
Continue Gold Standard
I I It be true as true i undoubtedly
is that gold is now our standard of
money values the future needs onlY
I the assurance that i will so continue
I to be until at least the people shall be
so united in their desire for a change
therein as to be able to direct the voice I
of both houses of congress and secure
i the approving signature of the chIef e
ecuthe The confidence that congress
will furnish thIs kind of a guaranty has
Inspired enterprise called capital into
I use improved the condition of labor
and given new impetus to all our en

adeuateBanking and Currency
After an exhaustive revIew of the
history of banking and currency In
which national banks are defended and
their purposes explained Mc Gage
Gas
I beg now to point out some of the
general limitations and restrictIons
which congres has Imposed In this de
partment and to inquire as to their
justice wisdom and adequacy
I As to condItions of capitaliza
tion The lai iequlr a minimum cap
ital ot 50000 as a precedent to organi
nation under the national bank act
While this would seem to be a fair and
moderate limit I is undoubtedly too
large for the resources of sal com
munites where banking facilities are
much needed and I 13 suggested that
for places on population of 100 or less
the minimum be reduced to 20h0
2 The natiOnal bank act clearly
recognizes the noteIssuing futtcton as
a preFer one but It Is plain that the
origInal conditIons and limitations im
posed have under changing conditions
become substantially prohibitive In
their terms This ought to be re
studIed and as large a Ibertt given
as may be consistent with safety In
the exercise of that useful function
Cash Banks Shall Car

cash against their deposits and limits
the amount of rIsk which the bank
shall take In lon to any one IndIvId

justified in practice the provision of
the law but the limitations on loans

the comptroller of the currencypn this I
point to be found In his report to con
gress last yeni merIt careful consid

exist In several directions no limitation

liability a bank may car upon a
gIven amount of capital Upon this
point the bank With OOO capial
stands leally as free as does the bank
with 5C90000capital Cash rtserves
defensible subject o legislation
pre a subjet of leislaton
because they affect the Immediate sib
I veney of the bank The limitation of
liability compared with capital Is
equally so since the percentage of
capital and accumulated surplus af
fects the ability of the bank to bear
its own loses Capital loans and de
posits bar healthful and proper re
lations to each other EvetthIngelse
being equal the mesre of risk Is de
termined by the extent of the loans
and for the ultimate solvency of the
bank as to its deposits the capital of
the bank Is the proper guaranty The
capital should therefore b relate
and volved fairly adequate to the risk In
It Is mainly 4n the lack ot adequacy
quac to public nee that our na
tonal system Is at fault The repres
sive effect upon note issues destroys
or InjurIously limits one of Its very
important functions How In certain
particulars this Injury results I have
tried faithfully to show In view of the
weakness and limitations which time
and expedence have brought under no
tice efforts have ben made to modify
the national bankIng act
Reform Bills Needed
In the house of representatles of
the lat congress certain bills were
proposed embodYing measures whIch I
believe would be effective toward need
ed reform Thee mesres In their
generl principles arc approved by the
informed jUdgment or the most
thoughtful of our people It is to b
expected that the will be again of
fered for the consideratIon of the pres
ent congress Without Indulgng pe
clfc recommendations at thIs time
which If mode could be but repetitions
of prevIous recommendations I com
mend the subject to the thoughtfUl at

As to the revenues or the govern

ThIs leave a surplus of 100000 for

Reading the Central Pacific debt
Mr
Gage says
The agreement for the setteent in
full of the indebtedness of the Central
Pacific Railroad company to the United
State made under date of Feb 1 1899
between the United States acting by
the commission appointed under act
of congress approved Jut i 1598 the
Central Pacific Railroad company and
1essrs Spe Co bankers was
reported to congress at Its last sessIon
This provided for the execution by the
Central Pacific Railroad company of
its promissory notes for the aggregate
amount of the whole indebtednes
principal and interest to the United
States growing out of the issue of
bonds in aid of tho constructIon ot the
Central Pacific and Western Pacific
bondaided railroads Such note were
t le made payable rcecthely on or
I before the expiration of each sucs
slve six month for ten years counting
from the date of the agreement and
were to be secured by frst I refunding
mortgage 4 per cent gold bonds Issue
by the Central Pacific Railroad com
pany or its successor company having
title to the railroads of that company
Such bonds were to form part of an Is
sue which should not exceed 10000
000 in all
Within the period prescribed In said
agreement the Central Pacific Railroad
company delivered to the treasurer of
the United States its notes as provide
therein and before the expiration of
the time limited in saId agreement
therefor Mess Spyer Co pur

Refund Mortgage Bond
Since the adjournment of the last
congress the first refunding mortgage
4 per cent gold bonds which under
the settlement agreement were to be
delvere to the United States as r
curly for thee note have been exe
cuted by the Central Pacific Railway
company a corporation of the state oC
Utah to which all the properties of the
Central Pacific Railroad company have
been conveyed and have been delivered
I to the treasurer of the United State
to the amount prescribed In said settle
ment agreement I Is not doubted
that the promissory notes hereafter to
mature which are still held by the
United State and secure by the de
posit of such frt refunding bonds will
be duly paid at or before their ma
turity The United States through the
settlement agreement thus entered Into
will be reimbursed the full amount of
