Saaeay Morning. December 18.1870.

"Ke observant man can mistake the
Signa. ot 'fae gathering storm of the po?
litical skies. Tb* cicrds and the muf
. i&ofl tfhunder foretell the power and mag?
nitude of the tempest that is to wreck
many who have braved the winds of
popular opinion. There is no peace-no
rest-in the condition of pnblic affairs.
President Grant has madly, or stupidly,
4tjtrutf>od bin?lol f to tho gnidanoe of tho
moat "blind and ' malignant men-men
whose history shows that thoy have fat?
tened on the piejadices and rancors of
the times,; and whose only hope of being
?onttuued in offioo is in the promotion
.of the scotional passions,' fanning the
flames of fanaticism, aud keeping alive
the bitter pr?judices engendered by the
<irar. Even the President's message is
atado the instrument of this atrocious
parp?se. Almost its first paragraph es
?ays to dignify the slander of the South?
ern States put forth by the lowest and
most dishonest of the Radicals-that the
freedman is obstructed in tho exercise of
his right to vote. Tho President's at?
tempt, or the attempt of some one for
bim, to fire tho Northern public against
the South, must fail. A falsehood does
noot grow respectable by getting iuto a
high place, but, on the other hand, be
-somes all the moro monstrous when be?
held so impudently displayed. General
Butler, who is now, if "bottled up,"
-'bottled up" along with General Grunt,
?seconds tho President in bis effort to in?
flict injury and humiliation with bis am?
nesty bill, than which no moro insulting
proposition was ever made under the
disguise of ciernen oy to a people. Yes,
says the Richmond Dispatch, it is all the
time the same thing. To bumiliate.tbe
.South, and to make her people distrusted
?ia ?very way, is tho policy of the|ultra
fiadicals, who have gotten control ol
.General Grant. They have promised
from time to time to give up this policy
"au cooa as it could be done safely"-i, e.,
?s soon as it could be done with safety
io the Republican party. But every
year they fail to see that Republicanism
?M safe, and so they can't change theil
policy. The Southern people must be
?ever convicted of cruelty to negroes.
The negro is the petted ape carried about
?by the Government, and which will, a;
in the fable, be at last dropped fatally
apon the rocks and left to perish bj
those who have never used him out ol
any true feeling of sympathy for him,
but only for their own selfish and do
?estable partisan ends.'
In this policy Genoral Grant goee
hack npon himself-abandons his liberal
wiews and schemes developed in his pro?
tection of Leo and his followers from
that jackal Judge Underwood, and hit
plan of the restoration of Virginia. Ht
hod the people with him in these, foi
they were really in the line of peace an<j
restoration of tho country. But, os ht
goes back on hi3 own policy, tho people
will go against him. He instructed hi;
favorites in Missouri to stand up against
his Virginia policy; but the people
scouted his instructions, and maintained
that policy. And so is tho carly Grant
policy-developed under the wiso coun?
sels of Schofield and Rawlins, and en?
couraged by General Sherman-adherec?
to by tho best and most powerful com
munition in the Union. They think
that "let us havo peaco" is a mockery,
unless there is something done honestly
And sincorely designed to produce har?
mony, and banish sectional discord anc
-distrust from the public counsels anc
the nation. So we see how peoplo an
dropping off from tho war party anc
.expressing their hostility to further pe
?nullica and vindictive policies. Thi
"new movement" in Virginia, originally
favored by Grant, has swept over tin
country. It Was a movement in favor o
peaco, equality and justice, in all publii
administration, including taxation ane
.disbursement-equality in thc burthen
And tho benefits of thc Government
In every particular tho present admin is
?ration has discardod this liberal ant
just policy. Distrust tho South-hon]
up burthens upou tho weak-coutiuui
the exorbitant taxes-let the capitalist
.still suck the blood of tho nation-kee]
ont thc interest-bearing notes-non
interest-bearing notes would be bette
for the people, but not so good fo
capitalists-and we must take caro o
tho lutter! Now hero is a sum of op
.?resaion and wrong-of opposition t<
peaco and harmony-that may well en
rage the poople. They arc discontented
und growing daily more so. The storr
is rising and spreading, and will bure
-.?pon the incompetent and malignan
ollie inls and sweep thom away. Goui
men uro combining against tho abuse Ci
.power and thc war upon tho peace um
dignity of the nation. Whatever the,
?'hoosoIo call themselves, their cause i
gnat, and triam ph they mast "Let
as," indeed, "have peace." .
To (hi Edify of. ita Phosnif. BIB:
I havo introduced a bill into tho Legis?
latura, tho offcot ot which, if passed,
will bo to reviv? the law against usury.
Whother the law against usnry is
restored or not, does not concern my
individual interest; and I have, there?
fore, no individual interest to subserve.
I introduced the bill to repeal the Act
of 1866, upon strong representations
made to me, by leading men connected
with the manufacturing and agricultural
interests of the State.
Upon two Doints I desire to be satis?
fied: 1st. That the repeal of the laws
against usury has induced the flow of
one dollar more into the State than
would have come without their repeal.
2d. That the best interest of tho people
of the State will bo subsorvod by per?
mitting the law to stand as it is.
I invite from all classes the fullest
information upon these points.

COLUMMA, December 17, 1870.
Congressman Bowen publishes the fol?
lowing card, relative to tho charge of
bigamy:
To THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY CHRONI?
CLE: The Republican of to-day contained
an article, tho purport of which waa to
hold mo up beforo the public ns a biga?
mist. The charge has not the slightest
foundation in fact. Tho hostility und
malignity of my political ?enemies in
South Carolina, whose corrupt echemos
my success as a contestant for a seat in
the Forty-Second Congress would mar,
are the causes of this infamous oharge.
As they shrunk from no outrage, no vio?
lation of law, to prevent my being ,de
clared elected in the recent election, so
now they shrink from no sacrifico of
truth, justice or decency, in casting
odium upou the name and character of
one who may, they think, havo his causo
injured by their venomous attacks.
The Slur of this eveuiug informs tho
public that tho Grand Jury of the Dis?
trict have found an indictment against
me on this chnrgo. I am informed that
this was procured on tho evidenco of a
person who has, for a year or two past,
been one of a corrupt ring of politicians
in South Carolina, and whoso evidence in
that State would not weigh a feather in
any man's mind.
I stand ready to meet and answer this
infamous chargo in tho proper place. It
is unnecessary to say moro now and hore.
It remains to be seen whether this at?
tempt to prejudico my character as a
man will havo the effect intended upon
tho contest I am urging agaiust fraud,
perjury and ru align i tv. Respectfully,
yours, C. C. BOWEN.

The cactus fence is an institution pe?
culiar to Mexico. The variety of the
plant used for this purpose is called the
?rgano. It is eight-sided, and shoots up
straight as an arrow, from len to twenty
five feet in height, and rive to eight inches
in thickness. Tho fence-builders out tho
cactus into sections of the right length,
stick the cut end into a trench, covor the
dirt around it to the depth of a foot, and
the fence is made. The pieces aro set as
closely together as possible, and, as they
Uko root and grow for centuries, the
fence improves with age, instead of go?
ing to decay like other fences.
TEXAS.-Unless there is somo chango
made iii the law of Texas, there will be
no Congressional election held in the
State until November, 1872, when it will
ho timo tochoo80 members to the Forty

much easier to hold power in tho South
thau obtain it, and hence they abolish or
postpone elections whenever such a
courge ia practicable.
