COLLIN MAKES SENSATIONAL CHARGES AGAINST
NETHERCUTT BUT GETS HIS DATES BADLY MIXED
Commissioner in Today's Trial Says AU
torney Wanted "Hush" Money After
He Had Admitted He Lied to Grand
Jury Swore to an Af=

berta at the Time*"Public May Get
Wise if Fight Continues.
"I wish I had not brought that
suit. I'd rather have my right arm
cut off. But I want you to sign
this agreement. I'll show it to no
one and keep it in my safe and no
one will know of it until I order |
Its destruction with my last gasp
as I enter the jaws of hell."
The above remark is attributed
by Chairman George H. Collin dur
ing the course of his testimony
before Justice Stocker this morn
ing, to George M. Nethercutt in the j
Brook saloon In the presence of j
W. D. Knight during the different
changes in the litigation between
Nethercutt and Collin.
"If you were in Alberta on the '
19th of the month how could you
make oath in Spokane on that day
to this affidavit?"
That was one of the questions '
asked of the complaining witness
on his cross-examination by the de
fendant. this it is apparent .
that Nethercutt expects to impeach
Collin's veracity.
The trial of Nethercutt on the
eahrge of blackmail preferred by
Collin was commenced shortly be
fore 10 o'clock before an unusually
ponderous array of office holders.
All three of the county commission
ers were present, but Commissioner
Connolly was not. bothered to any
extent by attentions from the other
two. Connolly is suspected of not
having "pulled back" in the early
stages of the Nettiercutt-Collin im
broglio as hard as ho might havo
done. County Fumigator Morrison
graced the court room for a time,
but went away. Richard W. Nuz
um, the attorney for Collin in the
bribery acthm commenced by
Nethercutt in Justice Hinkle's
court, was another careful observer
of events. Judge A. E. Barnes, at
torney for Collin in the civil ac
tion, was also present. Constable
Grant beamed upon the commis
sioners In a quizzical way, wonder
ing whether there was any special
act he could perform for those who
gave him a Job and then tried to
hitch a string to It. County Aud
itor Zach Stewart looked in on the
ecene for a time. Political Expert
Sanders took a seat on one side of
the court room.
Upon the opening of formalities
Nethercutt slated that he was
ready to plead and said: "Em
phatically not guilty." He contln

all present, thus foreshadowing
that his defense was to be wrung
from them.
"I desire that the full facts be
brought out, and I want to make
exception to the indeflnteness and
uncertainty of tho charge."
Complaining Witness Collin to
the stand.
Oeneral questions were asked and
nnswered as to Collin's proper
place In the landscape of events In
the city and county. He was then
asked about the first intimation
concerning trouble In the bindery
business between "Mr. Knight and
this man Taylor," which the prose
cutor at once corrected by asking
the stenographer to make it "Mr."
Taylor.
COLLIN'S DIRECT TESTIMONY.
The gist of the direct testimony
of Collin is: That Knight met wit
ness on the courthouse steps and
told of trouble with Taylor arising
out of Knight's being delinquent in
payments on his share of the busi
ness. Collin agreed to let him have
$('.OO which Knight told him to hand
over to Nethercutt. Collin gave it
to Nethercutt on that day, but could
not remember the place. In fact
facility in remembering dates was
something which was lacking dur
ing all of Collin's testimony. Col
lin took no receipt for the money
because Knight said he was going
to incorporate and would put up 12
shares of stock as collateral. A
hitch occurred through Taylor's de
clining to take the $600 unless
Knight should also buy another in
terest in the concern. Collin left
for the good roads convention at
Portland and told Nethercutt that
he could get $200 from Commis
sioner Dean in order to see Knight
through. On the return from Port
land, Nethercutt called Collin to his
office and told him that Knight's
books made things look bad for Col
lin as they showec? that Collin had
been receiving commissions for
county work. Nethercutt exhibited
a memorandum. Collin observed
that anyone could make memoranda
and went to see Knight about it
nnd demanded to see what tho book
told. Matters waxed a little warm
and Collin reminded Knight that he
owed him $115 from tho previous
September, Knight and Collm went
to Spokane.
Mr. Donovan stopped In this city
today at the request of the chamber
of commerce and addressed the
committee of the chamber of com
merce apolnted to see If it is pos
sible to raise the $400,000 asked by
the citizens of Belllnghsm to se

$110 note <Irawn and there Knight
cut leaves from tho books contain
ing references to county business
with the Arm. Nethercutt showed
Knight's notes, but as they were
payable to Nethercutt instead of
Collin the latter declined. Nether
j cutt said that seeing It was county
matter he had drawn the notes to
j his own order and would endorse.
Collin wanted notes in his own
name. "Nethercutt thought it
would look better not to show the
public I was interested in the bind
ery." Collin later got duplicate
' notes from Knight, made to Col
; lin's order.
PRODUCES CUT OUT PAGES.
At this point the prosecutor went
■ over each of the 10 sheets of papef
| cut from the books, but as to the
items contained, Collin knew noth
ing.
| Then Nethercutt commenced to
talk of the grand jury to Collin.
Still later Nethercutt told Collin
that things were getting hot. "The
bars have been thrown down and
the gates opened and I have been
offered $5000 by reputable citizens
to tell the grand jury what I know
of you," said Nethercutt to Collin.
He said further: "I am told that
you and Dean have made $25,000
in the last two years, and $5000 is
my share." Later Nethercutt said
that, he'd take $3000, and still ater
$1000. "You're foolish," said Col
lin, "you ought to have $5000 sure."
Then Nethercutt asked Collin to
' sign a contract for a nominal sum
dating back before the grand jury,
'so as to be evidence to use if the
grand jury accused him of perjury
when ho told that body he was Col
lin's attorney. iNethercutt said he
would "bawl Collin out" in the pa
pers and "get him before the pub
j lie."
| The latter part of Collin's testi
mony referred to the meeting of
himself, Knight and Nethercutt at
the Brook in an effort to get the
matter settled, during which Neth
ercutt made his -tobe-famous "jaws
of hell" remark.
