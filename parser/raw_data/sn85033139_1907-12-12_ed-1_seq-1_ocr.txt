ENGINEERS FILE APPRAIS
AL OF WATER PLANT.
The completed figures of the apprais
al of the property of the Manitowoc
Water Works company were filed in the
office of the city clerk last Friday. The
report, which gives in detail the classi
fication and values of all of the com
pany’s property in this city, was com
pelled tinder the direction of the Rail
road Rate Commission in accordance
wilh the provisions of the public Utility
Law passed by the last legislature, and
is signed W. D. Pence, engineer for the
commission.
It is based upon the examination and
investigation of the property of the
Water company made a few weeks ago
by a corps of engineers under the direc
tion of Mr. Pence.
The following is a summary of the
report.

Stores, Supplies 3,133 3,133
234,010 208,008
Paving 708 708
234,785 208,437
As will he seen by examining the
above figures only the physical value of
the property of the Water company has
been considered in arriving at this valua
tion. Nothing has been allowed for the
value of the franchise for that portion
of its term yet unexpired and no allow
ance has been made for the fact that the
plant is a going concern. These are
matters that the Rate commission will
have to pass upon and they will be tak
en np in connection with the figures
given above as the value of the plant by
the commission at the January session.
It is safe to say that some value will
be added to the amounts above stated,
for g <mg value of the plant, and con
servative estimates of tiie final figures
of the commission on tlie property lix
the amount at not less than $325,000.
The figures filed by the engineers do
not differ very greatly from tiie value
placed on the physical property of the
plant by the board of appraisers who
valued it some time ago when the agi
tation for Municipal Ownership of tins
property assumed definite form in this
city. The total value at that time ac
cording to the figures filed was about
$230,000, and in this was included au
amount to represent going value, The
city, after the filing of these figures,
rejected them on the theory that they
were much too high.
Later the management of the com
pany offered the entire property of the
company to the city for $330,000, hut at
a special election held a few months ago
this offer also was rejected, and steps
were taken by the city council looking
to the securing of the plant by condem
nation proceedings. Ahont that time
the engineers of the commission appear
ed and began the work of valuing the
tiie property and proceedings on the part
of the council have been delayed from
time to time since then, in order that
the engineers’ figures might lie made
known before further steps were taken.
The figures filed with the commission
are subject to change by it after a full
hearing on the subject, but it is safe to
say that no very radical changes will lie
made m them, and that if the city still
desires to own the water plant It will
have to pay considerably inure than
S2OO, ODD to procure it.

WRIGHTJOUHD GUILTY,
C. M. Wright, Editor of the Daily
Tribune, a Socialist paper published in
this city, who was arrested on a charge
of criminal libel preferred by William
Rahr, Sr., some weeks ago, was found
guilty by a jury in Municipal court, last
Saturday evening. The complaint as
made by Rahr was based upon articles
published by Wright in the Daily Tri
bune about and during the time of the
holding of the county fair here last Sept
ember. On the trial it developed that
Wright had not gotten passes to the
Fair and that his paper was not given
any advertising by the Fair association.
This and tho general policy of the paper
seems from the testimony to la* the only
reasous for the attacks made by Wright
on the character of Mr. Rahr. The trial
of the action lasted three days.
After the return of the verdict judge
Schmidt imposed a fine of fifty dollars
and costs of the action upon Wright
with the alternative of sixty days in the
connty jail. A notice of apiteal was
immediately served by Wright’s attor
ney and tiie case will prohai iy lie tried
again at the coming term of the ciicuit
court.

SCHUETTE TALKS TO CREDIT MEN
Last Friday evening at a banquet of
the credit Men's association of Milwau
kee. John Schuette, president of the
Manitowoc savings hank of this city,
presented his plan for the insurance by
the government of bank deposits. Mr.
Schnetceisan earnest advocate of the
establishment by the goveremant of a
guarantee fund to protect dejsisitors in
banks, and lielieves that if a law auth
orizing the establishment of such a
fund were enacted, no more such con
ditions of financial stringency as the
one which we have just experienced
would arise. The plan as outlined by
him would insure to depositors in banks
the amounts of their deposits, and
would prevent the periodical runs on
banks that occur whenever there is the
slightest suspicion on the part of de
positors that the money market is going
to run short in its supply.
Mr, Schuette stated that this plan had
suggested itself to him in is'.R, during
the study of a report made for that
year by the comptroller of the currency
to congress. His plan is based on the
same general outlines as that suggested
by \V. J Bryan in the course of his
address some weeks ago.
