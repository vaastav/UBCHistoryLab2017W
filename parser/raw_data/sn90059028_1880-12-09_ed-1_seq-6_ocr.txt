ADVANTAGES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Following is the
president's message, delivered to congress to
day:
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Rep
resentatives: I congratulate yon on the continued
and increasing prosperity of our country. By the
favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed
during the past year with health and abundant har
vests, with profitable employment for all our
people, with contentment at home and with
friendship with other nations. The occurrence of
the twenty-fourth election of chief magistrate has
afforded another opportunity to the people
of the United States to exhibit to the
world a significant example of the transmis
sion of tlio power and authority of government
from public servants, whose terms of office are about
to expire, to their newly-cliosen successors. This
example cannot fail to impress thoughtful people
of other countries with the advantages which re
publican institutions afford. The immediate gen
eral and cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens in
the result of the election gives gratifying assnr
ance to our country, and its friends throughout the
world, that government based on the free consent
of intelligent and patriotic people possesses elements
of strength, stability and permanency not found in
any other form of government.
CON STITUTIONA AMENDMEX TS.
THEIR VIOLATION IN THE SOUTH.
Continued opposition to the full and free enjoy
joyment of the citizenship conferred upon colored
people by the recent amendments to the constitu
tion still prevails in several of the late slave-hold
ing States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in
in the recent election to any large extent in acts of
violence and intimidation. It has, however, by
fraudulent practices in connection with casting
fraudulent ballots with regular ones, as to
the places and manner of voting, and with
counting returns and canvassing the votes cast,
been successful in defeating the exercise of the
right preservative of all rights, the right of
suffrage, which the constitution expressly confers
upon our enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of
good people of the whole country that sectionalism
as a factor in politics should disappear. They prefer
that uo section of the country should be united in
solid opco3ition to any other section. The disposi
tion to refuse prompt and hearty obedience to the
equal rights amendments to the constitution is all
that now stands in the way of a complete oblitera
tion of sectional lines in our political oatests. As
long as either of these amendments is flagrantly
violated or disregarded, it is safe to as ume that the
people who placed them in the consti ution as em
bodying the legitimate results of the war for the
Union, or who believe them to be wise and neces
sary, will continue to act together and to insist that
they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still
is as to the enjoyment of the right, by every Ameri
can citizen who has the requisite qualifications, to
freely cast his vote and have it honestly counted.
With this question rightly settled the country will
be freed from
THE CONTENTIONS OF THE PAST.
Bygones will indeed be bygones, and political and
party issues with respect to the economy and effi
ciency of administration, internal improvements,
the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance and
other important subjects, will then receive their
full share of attention but resistance to and nulli
fication of the results of the war will unite to
gether in resolute purpose for their support all
who maintain the authority of the government and
the perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately
appreciate the value of the victory achieved.
This determination proceeds from no hostile
sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of
our country or to any of their interests,
but from a belief in the inviolability of
these amendments to the fundamental
principles of our government. They are the
solemn expressions of the will of the people of the
United States. The sentiment that the constitu
tional rights of all our citizens must be maintained,
does not grow weaker It will continue to control
the government of the country. Happily, the his
tory of the late election shows that in many parts of
the country where opposition to the fifteenth amend
ment has heretofore prevailed, it is diminishing
and is likely to cease altogether if firm and well
considered action is taken by congress. I trust the
house of representatives and senate, which have
the right to judge of the actions, returns and quali
fications of their own members, will see to it that
every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the
fifteenth amendment is thoroughly investigated,
and that no benefit from such violation Bhall accrue
to any person or party. It will be the duty of the
executive, with sufficient appropriations for the
purpose, to prosecute unsparingly all who have
been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights
guaranteed by the constitution.
POPULAR EDUCATION.
ITS NECESSITY TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF CON
STITUTIONAL BIGHTS.'
It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best
and surest guarantee of the primary rights of citi
zenship is to be found in that capacity for self-pro
tection which can belong only to a people whose
right to universal suffrage is supported by personal
education. The means at the command of local and
State auAorities are. in many cases wholly inade
quate to furnish free instruction to all who need it.
This is especially true where before emancipation
the education of the people was neglected or pre
vented in the interests of slavery. Firmly con
vinced that the subject of popular education
deserves the earnest attention of the people
of the country, with a view to wise
and comprehensive action by the government of
the United States, 1 respectfully recommend that
congress, by suitable legislation and with proper
regulations, supplement the local educational funds
in several States where duties and responsibilities
of citizenship have been devolved on uneducated
people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the
public lands, and if necessary by appropriations
from the treasury of the United States. What the
government can do to provide free popular educa
tion, oueht to be done. Wherever general educa
tion is found, peace, virtue and social order prevail,
and civil and religious liberty are secured.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
DANGEBS TO THE STABILITY OF THE GOVERN
MENT.
In my former annual messages I have asked the
attention of congress to the urgent necessity of a
reformation of the civil service system of the gov
ernment. My views concerning the dangers of pat
ronage, or appointments for personal or partisan
considerations have been strengthened by my ob
servation and experience In the executive office. I
believe these dangers threaten the stability of the
government. Abases so serious in their nature can
not be permanently tolerated. They tend to be
come more alarming with the enlargement of ad
ministrative service, as the growth of the cduntry
increases the number of officers and placemen em
ployed. The reasons are imperative for the adop
tion of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint
ments, promotions and removals, establishing
a uniform method, having exclusivelv in view in
every instance the attainment of the best quali
fications for the position in question. Such a
method
alone is consistent with the equal rights of
all citizens and the mo6t economical and efficient
administration of the public business. Competitive
examinations in aid of impartial appointments and
promotions have been conducted for some years
past in several of the executive departments, and by
my
direction, this system has been adopted in the
custom houses and postoffices of the larger cities
of the country. In New York city over 2,000 po
sitions in the civil service have been subject, iu
their appointments and tenure of place, to the ope
rations cf publishted rules for this* purpose,
during the past two years. The result of these
practical tests have been very satisfactory, and
have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system
of selection. All are subjected to the same tests,
and the result is free from prejudice by personal
favor, or partisan influence. It secures for the
position applied for
THE BEST QUALIFICATIONS ATTAINABLE
among the competing applicants. It is an effectual
protection from the pressure of importunity, which
under any other course pursued largely exacts the
time and attention of appointing officers, to their
great detriment in the discharge of other official
duties prevents the abase of the service for the
mere furtherance of private or party purposes, and
leaving the employes of the government, freed
from the obligations imposed by patronage, to
depend soiely on merit for retention and advance
ment, and with this constant incentive to advance
ment and improvement. These invaluable results
have been attained in a high degree in the offices
where the rules for appointment by competitive ex
amination have been applied, as shown by the exper
iments. This may be fairly considered conclusive,
and should be extenped to all subordinate positions
under the government. I believe that a strong and
growing public sentiment demands immediate meas
ures for securing and enforcing the highest possible
efficiency in the civil services, and its protection
from recognized abuse, and that the experience re
ferred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such
measures. The examinations in custom houses aud
postoffices have been held under many embarass
ments and without provision for compensation for
extra labor performed by the officers who
have conducted them, and whose commendable
interest in the improvement of the public service
has induced this devotion of time and labor without
pecuniary reward. A continuance of these labors
gratuitously ought not. to be expected,and without an
appropriation by congress for compensation, it. is
not practicable to extend the system of examination
throughout the civil service. It is highly important
that all such examinations should be conducted up
on a uniform system and under general supervision.
Section 1,753 of the revised statutes authorizes the
president to prescribe the regulations for admission
to the civil service of the United States, and for
this purpose to
EMPLOY SUITABLE PEBS0NS
to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to
the fitness of each candidate in respect to age,
health, character, knowledge and ability for the
branch of service into which he seeks to enter:
but the law is practically inoperative for the want
of requisite appropriations. I therefore recom
mend an appropriation of $25,000 per annum to
meet the expenses of a commission to be appointed
by the president, in accordance with the terms of
this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a djust,
uniform and efficient system of competitive exam
ination, or to supervise the application of the same
throughout the entire civil service of the govern
ment. I am persuaded that the facilities which
such a commission will afford for testing
the fitness of those who apnly for
^office will not only be as welcome
a relief to members of congress, as it will be to the
president and heads of the departments, but that
it will also tend to remove the causes of embarrass
ment which uow inevitably and constantly attend
the conflicting claims of patronage between the
legislative and executive departments. The most
effectual check upon this pernicious competition of
influence and official favoritism in the bestowal cf
office, will be the substitution of an open competi
tion of merit between the applicants, ia which
every one can make his record, with
the assurance that his success will
depend uoon this alone. I also recommend
such legislation as, while leaving every officer as
free as any other citizen to express his political
opinions and to use his means for their advancement
shall also enable him to feel as safe as any private
citizen in refusing all demands on his salary for
political purposes. A law which should thus
gurantee
TRUE LIBERTY AND JUSTICE TO ALL
who are engaged in the public service, and likewise
contain stringent provisions against the use of offi
cial authority to coerce the political action of pri
vate citizens or official subordinates, is greatly to
be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to
an improvement of. the civil service, and especially
to a reform in the method of appointment and re
moval, has been found to be the practice under
what is known as the spoils system, by which the
appointing power has been so largely encroached
on by members of congress. The first step in the
reform of the civil service must be a complete di
vorce between congress and the executive in the
matter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine
that "to the victor belongs the spoils" is insep
arable from congressional patronage, as
the established rule and practice of parties
in power. It comes to be understood by applicants
for office, and by the people generally, that repre
sentatives and senators are entitled to disburse the
patronage of their respective districts and
States. It is not necessary to recite, at length, the
evils resulting from this invasion of the executive
functions. The true principles of government, on
the subject of appointments to office, as stated in
the national conventions of the leading parties of
the country, have again and again been approved by
the American people, and have not been called in
question in any quarter. These authentic expres
sions of public opiniou upon this all-important sub
ject are
THE STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES
that belong to the constitutional structure of the
government. Under the constitution the president
and heads of departments. are to make nominations
for office, the senate is to confirm appointmc nts,
and the house of representatives is to accuse and
prosecute faithless officers. The best interest of
the public service demands that these distinctions
be respected that senators and representatives who
may be judges and accusers should not dictate ap
pointments to office. To this etd the co-operation
of the legislative department of the government is
required alike by the necessities of the case and by
public opinion. Members of congress will not be
relieved from the demands made upon them with
reference to appointments to office until by legisla
tive enactment the pernicious practice is condemned
and forbidden. It is therefore recommended that
an act le passed defining the relations of members
of congress with regard to appointment to office by
the president, and I also recommend that the pro
vision of section 1,767 and of the sections follow
ing of the revised statutes, comprising the tenure
of office act of March 2,1867. be repealed. Be
lieving that to reform the system and methods of
civil service in our country is one of tho highest
and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and
that it can be permanently done only by the co
operation of the legislative and executive depart
ments of the government, I again commend the
whole subject to your considerate attention.
POLYGAMY.
IMPORTANCE OF ITS SUPPRESSION.
It is the recognized duty and purpose of the peo
ple of the United States to suppress polygamy
where it now exists in our territory, and to prevent
its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been
made by the United States officers in Utah to en
force the laws against it Experience has shown
that legislation upon this subject, to be effective, re
quires extensive modification and amendment.
The longer action is delayed the more difficult it will
be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt aud de
cided measures are necessary. The Mormon sec
tarian organization which upholds polygamy
has the whole power of making and executing the
local legislation of the Territory. By its control of
the grand and petit juries it possesses large influ
ence over the administration of justice. Exercis
ing, as the heads of this sect do, the local political
nower of the Territory, they are able to make ef
fective their hostility to the law of congress on the
subject of polygamy, and in fact do prevent Its
enforcement. Polygamy will not be abol
ished by the enforcement of the law
on those who practice and uphold the
crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away
the political power of the sect which encourage and
sustain it. The power of congress to enact suitable
laws to protect the Territories is ample. It is not
a case for half-way measures. The politicalpower
of the Morman sect is increasing. It controls now
one of our wealthiest and most populous
Territory southwest of Ohio, by the ordinance of
1787. If, however, it is deemed-best to continue
the existing form of local government, I recommend
that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries
in the Territory of Utah be confined to those who
neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thor
ough measures are adopted, it is believed that
within a few years the evils which now afflict Utah
will be eradicated, aud this Territory will in good
time become one of the most prosperous and at
tractive of the new States of the Union.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
UNDISTURBED PEACE.
Our relations with all foreign countries have been
those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no
occasion for concern as to their continued mainte
nance. My anticipation of an early reply from the
British government to the demand of indemnity to
our fishermen for injuries suffered by that industy
at Fortune bay, in January,1878, which I expressed,
in my last'annual message, was disappointed. This
answer was received only in the latter part of April,
in the present year, and when received exhibited a
failure of accord between the two governments as
to the measure of the inshore fishing privileges
secured to our fishermen by the treaty of Washing
ton, of so serious a character that I made it the
subject of a communication to congress, in which I
recommended the adoption of measures which
seemed to me proper to be taken by this govern
ment for the maintenance of the rights accorded to
our fishermen under the treaty and towards secur
ing an indemnity for the injury these interests had
suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations
was under consideration by the house of represen
tatives at the time of the adjournment of congress
in June last. Within a few weeks I have received a
communication from her majesty's government, re
newing the consideration of the subject both of the
indemnity for injuries at Fortune bay and of inter
pretation of the treaty, in which the previous cor
respondence had shown tho two governments to be
at variance. Upon both these topics, the disposition
towards a friendly agreement is manifested by a
recognition of our right to an indemnity for the
transaction at Fortune bay, leaving the measure of
such indemnity to further conference, and by an as
sent to the views of this government, presented in
the previous correspondence, that the regulation of
conflicting interests of the inshore fishery of the
provincial sea coasts and the vessel fishery of our
fishermen should be made the subject of a confer
ence and concurrent arrangement between the two
governments. I sincerely hope that the basis may
be found for a speedy adjustment of the very seri
ous divergence of views in the interpretation of the
fishery clause of the treaty of Washington which,as
the correspondence between the two governments
stood at the close of the last session of congress,
seemed to be irreconcilable.
INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITIONS.
In the important exhibition of arts and industries
which was held at Sydney, New South Wales,
as well as in that now in progress iu Melbourne,
the United States have been efficiently and honora
bly represented. The exhibitors from this country
at the former place received a large number of
awards in some of the most cousiderable depart
ments, and the participation of the United States
was recognized by a special mark of distinction. In
the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by our
country is no less notable, and an equal degree of
success is confidently expected. The state of peace
and tranquility now enjoyed by all the nations of
the continent of Europe has its tavorable in
fluence upon our diplomatic and commercial
relations with them. We have concluded and rati
fied a convention with the French republic for the
settlement, ot claims of citizens of either country
against the other. Under this convention a
commission, presided over by a distinguished
publicist, appointed iu pursuance of the request of
both nations by his majesty the emperor of Brazil,
has been organized and has begun its sessions in this
city. A congress to consider means for the pro
tection of industrial property has recently been in
session in Paris, to which I have appointed
the ministers of the United States
to France aud Belgium as delegates.
The international commission upon weights and
measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite
your attention to the necessity of appropriations to
be made in time to enable this government to fulfill
its obligations under the metrical convention. Our
friendly
RELATIONS WITH THE GERMAN EMPIRE
continue without interruption. At the recent inter
national exhibition of fish and fisheries, at Berlin,
the participation of the United States, notwithstand
ing the short time in which the commission was
forced to make preparations, was extremely suc
cessful and meritorious, winning for private exhib
itors numerous awards of high class, and for the
country at large tho principal prize of honor
offered by his majesty the emperor. The results
of this great success cannot but be advan
tageous to this important and grow
ing industry. There have been some
questions raised between the two gov
ernments as to tho proper effect and interpretation
of our treaties of naturalization, but recent dis
patches from our minister at Berlin show favorable
progress is making toward an understanding in ac
cordance with the news of this goverement, which
makes and admits no distinction whatever between
the ritrhts of a native and a naturalized citizen of
the United States in practice. Complaints of. mo
lestations suffered by naturalized citizens abroad
have never been fewer. There is nothing of im
portance to note in our unbroken friendly relations
with the governments of Austro-Hungary, Russia,
Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey
and Greece.
SPANISH INSULTS.
During the last summer several vessels belonging
to the merchant marine of this country, sailing in
the neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at,
boarded and searched by armed cruisers of the
Spanish government The circumstances, as report
ported, involve not only private money to persons
concerned, but also seemed to be too little observ
ant of the friendly relations existing for a century
between this country and Spain. The wrong was
brought to the attention of the Spanish
government in a serious protest and re
monstrance, and the matter is undergoing investi
gation by the royal authorities with a view to such
explanation or reparation as may be called for by
the facts. The commission sitting in this city for
the adjudication for claims of our citizens against
the government of Spain is, I hope, approaching the
termination of its labors. The claims against the
United States under the Florida treaty with Spain,
were submitted to congress for its action, at
the late session, and I again invite your
attention to this long-standing question with a view
to a disposition of the matter. At the invitation of
the Spanish government, a conference has recently
been held, at the city of Madrid, to consider the
subject of protection by foreign powers of native
Moors in the empire of Morocco. The minister of
the United States in Spain was directed to take part
in the deliberations of this conference, the result of
which is a convention signed on behalf of the pow
ers represented. The instrument will be laid be
fore the senate for its consideration. Tho govern
ment of the United States has also lost no oppor
tunity to urge upon that of the emperor of Morocco
the necessity, in accordance with the humane and
established spirit of the age, of putting an end to
persecutions which have been so patent in that
country, of a faith ether than that of the Moslem,
and especially of Hebrew residents of Morocco.
TREATIES WITH BELGIUM, DENMARK AND CHINA!
The consular treaty concluded with Belgium has
not been yet officially promulgated, owing to the
alternation of a word in the text by the senate of
the United States, which occasioned a delay, during
which the time allowed for a ratification expired.
The seuate wil be asked to extend the period of
ratification. The attempt to negotiate a treaty of
extradition with Denmark failed on account of the
objection of
.the
Territories.
It is extending 6teadily into other Territories.
Wherever it goes it establishes
POLYGAMY AND SECTARIAN POLITICAL POWER.
The sanctity of marriage and family relation are
the corner-stones of American society and civiliza
tion. Religious liberty and the separation of church
and state are among the elementary ideas of flee
institutions. To re-establish the interests and
principles which polygamy and Mormonism have
imperiled, and to fully reopen the Territory to in
telligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds, to
general immigration now restricted by intolerant
and immoral institutions, it is recommended that
the government of the Territory of Utah should be
reorganized. I recommend that congress provide
for the government of Utah by a gov
ernor and judges, or commissioners ap
pointed by the president and con
firmed by the senate, a government analogous
to the provisional government established for the
Danish government to the clause
providing that each nation should pay the expense
of arrest of persons whose extradition it wishes.
The provision made by congress at its last session
for expense of commission, which had been ap
pointed to enter upon negotiations with the im
perial government of China, on a subject of great
interest to the relations to the two countries, en
abled the commissioners to proceed at once upon
their mission. The imperial govern
ment was prepared to give prompt and
respectable attention to the matters brought under
negotiation, and the conferences proceeded with
such rapidity and success that on the 17th of No
vember last two treaties were signed at Peklo, one
relating to the introduction of Chinese into this
country, and one relating to commerce. Mr. Tres
cott, one of the commissioners, is now on his way
bringing the treaties, and it is expected that they
will be received in time to be laid before the senate
early in January. Our minister in Japan has nego
tiated a convention for the reciprocal relief of the
shipwrecked. I take occasion to urgo
once more upon congress the propri
ety of m&king provision for the erection of
suitable fire-proof buildings at the Japanese capi
tal for the use of the American legation, and the
court house and jail connected with it The Japan
ese government, with great generosity and cour
tesy, has offered for this purpose an eligible piece
of land. In
my
nity funds eceived some years ago from China and
Japan. I renew the recommendation then made,
that whatever portions of these funds are due to
American citizens should be promptly paid and the
residue returned to the nations respectively to
which they justly and equitably belong.
THE NETHERLANDS AND ROUMANIA.
The extradition treaty with the kingdom of the
Netherlands, which has been for some time in
course of negotiation, has, during the past year,
been concluded and duly ratified. Relations of
•friendship and amity have been established between
the government of the United States and that of
Roumania. We have sent a diplomatic representa
tive to Bucharest and have received at this capital
the special envoy, who has been charged by his
royal highness, Prince Charles, to announce the in
dependent sovereignty of Roamania. We hope for
a speedy development of commercial relations be
tween the two count""*.
THE MEXICAN
BORDER.
In my last annual message I expressed the hope
that the prevailing |uiet on the border between
this country and Mexico would soon become so as
sured as to justify the modification of orders then in
force to our military commanders in regard to
cross
ing the frontier without encouraging such disturb
ances as would endanger the peace of the two
countries. Events moved in accordance with these
expectations, and the orders were accordingly with
drawn to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens
and the Mexican government. Subsequently the
peace of the border was again disturbed by a
savage foray under the command of the
Chief Victorio, but by the combined and
harmonious action of the military forces of both
countries, his band has been broken and substan
tially destroyed. There is reason to believe that the
obstacles which have so long prevented rapid and
convenient communication between the United
States and Mexco by railways are on a point of dis
appearing, and that several important enterprises
of this character will soon be set on foot, which
cannot fail to contribute largely to the prosperity
of both countries.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
New envoys from Guatamala, Co'ombia, Bolivia,
Venezuela and Nicaragua have recently arrived at
this capital, whose distinction and enlightment af
ford the best guarantee of the continuance of
friendly relations between ourselves and these sis
ter republics. The relations between this gov
ernment and that of the United States of Colom
bia have engaged public attention during
the past year mainly by reason of the projection of
an inter-oceanic canal across the isthmus of Pana
ma, to be built by private capital, under a conces
sion from the Colombian government for that pur
pose. The treaty obligations subsisting between the
United States of Colombia and the United States,
by which we guarantee the neutrality of the transit
and the sovereignty and property of Colombia in
the isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions
under which so stupendous a change in the region
embraced in this guarantee should be effected,
transforming as it would this isthmus from a bar
rier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
into a gateway and thoroughfare be
tween them for the navies and merchant
ships of the world should, receive the approval of
this government as being comparable with the dis
charge of these obligations on our part, and consist
ent with our interests as the principal commercial
power of the western hemisphere. The views which
I expressed in a special message to congress in
March last, in relation to this project, I deem it my
duty again to press on your attention. Subsequent
consideration has but confirmed the opinion that it
is the right and duty of the United States to assert
and maintain such supervision and authority over
any inter-oceanic canal across the isth
mus that connects North and South America as will
protect our national interests.
THE WAR
between the republic of Chili on the one hand and
the allied republics of Peru and Bolivia on the other
still continues. This government has not felt called
on to interfere in a contest that is within the bellig
erent rights of the parties as independent states.
We have, however, held ourselves in readiness to
aid in accommodating their difference, and have, at
different times, reminded both belligerents of our
willingness to render such services. Our good of
fices in this direction were recently occupied by all
the belligerents, and it was hoped that they would
prove efficacious but I regret to announce that the
measures which the ministers of the United States
at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take with
the view to bring about a peace were not success
ful. In the course of the war some questions
have arisen affecting neutral rights. In all of these
the ministers of the United States have under their
instructions acted with promptness and energy in
protection of American interests. The ralations
the United Sttaes with the empire of
BRAZIL
continue to be most cordial, and their commercial
intercourse steadily increases to their mutual ad
vantage. The internal disorders with which the
Argentine republic has for some time past been af
flicted, and which aave more or less influenced its
external trade, are understood to have been brought
to a close. This happy result may be expected to
redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of
that republic as well as to the development of its
vast interior resources. In
SAMOA.
The government of King Malietoa, under the
support and recognition of the consular represen
tatives of the United States, Great Britain and Ger
many seems to have given peace and tranquility to
the islands. While it does not appear desirable to
adopt as a whole the scheme of the Tripolite local
government, which has been proposed, the com
mon interests of the three great treaty powers re
quire harmony in their relations to the native form
of government, and this may be best secured by a
simple diplomatic agreement between them It
would be well if the consular jurisdictions of our
representative at Tapia were increased in extent
and importance, so as to guard American interests
in the surrounding and outlying islands of
Oceanica.
EGYPT.
The obelisk generously presented by the khedive
of Egypt to the city of New York has safely ar
rived in this country and will soon be erected in that
metropolis. A commission for the liquidation of
the Egyption debt has lately concluded its work,
and this government, at the earnest solicitation of
the khedive, has acceded to the provisions
adopted by it, which will be laid before congress for
its information. A commission for the revision of
the judicial code of the reform tribunals of Egypt
is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Forwan. consul gen
eral, and J.
M.
Batchelder have been appointed as
commissioners to participate in the work. The or
ganization of the reform tribunals will probably be
continued for another period of five years. In pur
suance of the act passed' at the last session of con
gress, invitations have been extended to foreign
maritime states to join in a-sanitary conference in
Washington, beginniug the 1st of January. The
acceptance of this invitation by mauy prominent
powers, gives promise of success in this important
measure, designed to establish a system of interna
tional notification by which the spread of
infectious or epidemic diseases may be more
effectively counteracted or prevented. The at
tention of congress is invited to the necessary ap
propriations for carrying into effect the provisions
of the act referred to. The efforts of the depart
ment of state to
ENLARGE THE TRADE AND COMMERCE
of the United States through the active
agency of consular officers, and through
the dissemination of information obtained
from them have been unrelaxed. The
interest in these efforts as developed in our com
mercial conventions, and the value of the informa
tion secured by this means to the trade and manu
factures of the country, was recognized by congress
at its last session, and provision was made for the
more frequent publication of consular and other re
ports by tho department of State. The first issue
ot this publication has now been prepared, and
subsequent issues may regularly be expected.
The importance and interest attached to reports ot
consular officersare witnessed by the general demand
for them by all classes of merchants Mia manufac
turers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed
that the system of such publication is deserving of
the approval of congress, and that the necessary
appropriation for its continuance and enlargement
will commend itself to your considerat'on. The
purposes of domestic industries and their immense
production of subjects of foreign commerce, in
vite, and even require, an active development of the
wishes and interests of our people in that direc
tion. Especially important is it that our commer
cial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
South America, with the West Indies and Gulf of
Mexico should be direct, and not through the cir
cuit of European systems, and should be carried on
in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the
opportunities which our front on the Pacific ocean
gives to commerce with Japan, China and the East
Indies, with
Australia
and the island groups which
belong to these routes
ot
navigation, should inspire
eanal efforts to appropriate to our own interest and
administer to our own capital a duo portion of this
trade. Whatever modification to our method of
TRADE AND NA^GATION

last annual message I invited the
attention of congress to the subject of the indem­
be necessary or useful to meet and direct the
enlargement of our exchange and our carrying in
terest, I am sure members of congress will be ready
to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to
me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture to
press it upon your earliest attention. It seems to
be very evident that the provision of regular steam
post
commerce alone, by aid of foreign govern
ments, has been the forerunner of the commercial
predominence of Great Britain in all the sea coasts,
and in these coasts and seas, a greater share, or
trade is now the desire and intent of OM
people. It is also manifest that the efforts
of other European nations to content*
with Great Britain for a share of this commerce
have been successful in proportion to their adoption
of regular steam postal communication with the
markets whose trade they sought. Mexico ana tne
States of South America are anxious to receive
such postal communications with this country ana
to aid In their development Similar co-operation
may be looked for in due time from the eastern na
tions and from Australia. It is difficult, to see how
the lead in the movement can be expected from
private interests. In respect of foreign
commerce quite as much as international
trade, postal .communication seems necessarily
a matter of common and
public
administration, and
thus pertaining to government. I respectfully rec
ommend to your prompt attention such jiist ana
efficient measures as may conduce to the develop
ment of our foreign commercial exchanges and the
BUILDING UP OF OUR CARRYING TRADE,
in this connection I desire also to suggest the very
great service which might be expected in en
larging and facilitating our commerce on
the Pacific Ocean were a transmarine cable
laid from San Francisco to the Sandwich Islands,
and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at
the south. Tho great influence of such means of
communication on these routes of navigation in de
veloping the due share of our Pacific coast in the
commerce of the world, needs no interpretation or
enforcements. It may be that such an enterprise,
useful and in the end profitable as it
would prove to private investment,
may need to be accelerated by prudent legislation
by congress in its aid, and I submit the matter to
your careful consideration. An additional and not
unimportant, although secondary reason for foster
ing and enlarging the navy may be found in the un
questionable service to the expansion of our com
merce which would be rendered by the frequent
circulation of naval ships in the seas and ports of
all quarters of tho globe. Ships of the proper con
struction and equipment to be of the
greatest efficiency in case of maritime war
might be made constant and active agents in time
of peace in the advancement and protection of our
foreign trade, and in the instruction and discipline
of young seamen, who would naturally, in some
numbers, mix with and improve the crews of our
merchant ships. Our mnrchants at home and
abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of
an active movement of our naval vessels, and the
intelligence and patriotic zeal of onr naval officers
in promoting every interest of their countrymen is
a just subject of naiontal pride
FINANCE.
A MOST CREDITABLE SHOWING.
The condition of the financial affairs of the gov
ernment, as shown by the secretary of the treas
ury, is very satisfactory. It is believed that the
present financial situation of the United States,
whether considered with respect to trade, cur
rency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and
variety of our resources, is more favorable than
that of any other country of our time,
and has never been surpassed by that
of any country at any period of its history. All
our industries are thriving, tho rate of interest is
low, new railroads are being constructed, a vast im
migration is increasing our population, capital and
labor, new enterprises in great number are in pro
gress, and our commercial relations with other
countries are improving. The ordinary revenues

THE AMOUNT DUE THE SINKING FUND
for. this year was $37,931,643.55. There was ap
plied then to this the sum of $73,904,617.61, be
ing $35,972,973.86 in exces of the actual require
ments for the year. The aggregate of revenues
from all sources during the fiscal year ended Jun$
30,1880, was $833,526,610.99, an increase over
the preceding year of $59,699,426.52. The re
ceipts thus far of the current year, together with
the estimated receipts for the remainder of the
year, amount to $330,000,000, which will
be sufficient to meet the estimated expenditures of
the year and leave a surplus of $40,000,000. I tis
fortunate that this large surplus revenue occurs at
a period when it may be applied to the payment of
the public debt, soon redeemable. No public duty
has been more constantly cherished in the United
States than the policy of paying the national debt
as rapidly as possible.
THE DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES,
less cash in the treasury and inclusive of accruing
iuterest, attained its maximum of $2,756,431,
571.43 in August, 1865, and has since been re
duced to $1,586,019,504.65. Of principal of the
debt $108, 58,100 has been paid since March 1,
1877, effecting an annual saving of $6,107,000.93.
The burden of interest has also been diminished by
the sals of bonds, bearing a low rate of interest, and
the application of the proceeds to the redemption
of bonds hearing a higher rate. The annual saving
thus secured since March 1,1877, is $14,290,
453.50. Within a short period over $600,000,000
of five and six per cent, bonds will become redeem
able. This presents a very favorable opportunity
not only, to reduce the principal of the
debt, but also to reduce the rate
of interest on that which will remain
unpaid. I call the attention of congress to the views
expressed on this subject by the secretary of the
treasury in his annual report, and recommend
prompt legislation to enable the treasury depart
ment to complete the refunding of the debt which
is about to mature. The continuance of specie pay
ment" has not been interrupted or endangered since
the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly
to the revival of business and to
our remarkable pros
perity. The fearathat preceded
and accompanied re
sumption have proved groundless. No considerable
amount of United States notes has been presented
for recemption while very large sums of gold bul
lion, bo^h domestic and imported are taken to the
mints and exchanged for coin and notes.
THE INCREASE OF COIN AND BULLION
in the United States since January 1,1879, is es
timated at $227,399,438. There are stil in ex
istence uncancelled $346,681,016 of United States
legal tender notes. These notes were authorized
as a war measure, made necessary 'by
the exigencies of the conflict in which the United
States was then engaged. The preservation of the
nation's existence required, in the judgment of con
gress, the issue of legal tender paper money. That
it served well tiie purpose for which it
was created is not questioned, but the
employment of the notes as paper money
