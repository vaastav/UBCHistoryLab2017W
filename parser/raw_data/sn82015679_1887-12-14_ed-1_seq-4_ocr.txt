Can it be that Siin Coy has been summoned
to "Washington to take Higgins's place? They
belong to the same school of politics.
Ir the Republican Senate can have its way
this country "will soon cease to be a dumping
ground for foreign paupers, idiots and crim
inals. AFTER a week or more spent in trying to
pet somebody to form a Cabinet, the French
President finally got Tirard. No wonder.
5 very body was getting so.
The Harper baby did what it could for its
pa, bat Cincinnati judges and juries are
jvidentiy of a hard-hearted sort, with no eye
for domestic scenes in court.
Acting Commissioner Stockslager
should have a care how he exasperates Mr.
Lamar. That gentleman is still Secretary,
and has power to "bounce" another subordi
nate as he did Sparks.
Mb. Higgins is going, but he wants it dis
tinctly understood that he goes of his own
eccord and isn't kicked out. The country
lill take his word for it, and will even go fur
ther and take it for granted that he is going
because the administration needs his peculiar
talent on the outside during the campaign
year.
The convention of Republican clubs to be
held in New York to-morrow promises to be
in interesting and important political event,
tt is now certain that the attendance will be
ery large, and the indications are that the
meeting will have considerable to do with
outlining and forecasting next year's cam
paign. '
Plymouth Church wanted an English
" pastor because the Congregational Church
over there is broader and more liberal in
doctrine than the denomination in this
country. Recent events in which Plymouth
took a discreditable part indicate that its
own breadth and loftiness of character is not
so great but that it might learn something of
very humble Christians in its own land.
The Comptroller of the Texa3 Treasury, who
delines to recognize the authority of the
United States Supreme Court over the laws
cf that commonwealth, has probably been led
by the recent appointment of Mr. Lamar to
the Bench to believe that the State sover
eignty doctrine has triumphed that the
Southerner in the saddle can override the Su
pre me Court, as well as some other depart
ments of the government.
The statement that the letter of introduc--jn
given by President Cleveland to Count
Mitkiewicz was written by him at the request
f a friend and that he himself was but
.lightly acquainted with the Count, can
hardly be regarded as satisfactory. The
publicity given to the affair should suggest to
the President the propriety of at least in
quiring into the character of his friends
before he recommends their friends.
A professional ballot-box stuffer and
"ward-worker really can't be of much service
to his party while he is cooped up in a gov
ernment office at Washington. Mr. Higgins
and his friends have been some time in find
ing this out, but now that the fact has
dawned upon them it has been decided that
the Baltimore heeler must be put where he
can do the greatest good to the Democracy.
t He will, therefore, retire to private life, fol
. lowed by the blessings of the administration.
The most cosmopolitan statesman in Con
cress is Senator Reagan, of Texas. He has
been in office nearly all of his adult life, and
has served under four different flags and five
different governments first, as a native of
Tennessee, in the United States government;
pert in the Republic of Texas, then in the
United States government again, then in the
provisional government of the Confederacy,
then in the permanent government of the
'Confederacy, and finally back again in the
United States government.
The Republicans of Cuyahoga county,
Ohio, in which Cleveland is situated, have
decided to do away with nominating conven
tions and make all nominations by primary
elections. The decision was reached after
full discussion and by popular ballot. Thirty
eight out of forty wards in Cleveland voted in
favor of the change, and the out townships
gave a majority of over 2,000 in favor of it.
Several plans of . making nominations were
discussed, all of them superseding the dele
gate convention, and the people finally adopt
ed the primary-election plan. It is claimed in
places where the plan has been tried that it
secures better candidates, a larger vote at
elections, more party harmony and better
feeling every way. Going still further in the
ame direction, the Republican county cen
tral committee have adopted a resolution to
the effect that "our Representatives are hereby
requested to cause a bill to be presented to
the coming General Assembly amending the
present election laws of Ohio in this particu
lar; to prohibit all ticket-peddling and solicit
ing of votes at or near any voting place in
Cuyahoga county; also, that no central
committee shall employ or cause to be
employed any person or persons for that
purpose, but that provisions shall be made at
each and every voting place in the county by
erection of booths or ticket . stands for each
political party, where tickets may be obtained.
each political party to have the authority to
erect such booths or stands and put a compe
tent man in charge of the same, thus doing
away with the system of hiring ticket-peddlers
and soliciting votes." This is a step in the
direction of electoral reform. Experience has
developed serious defects in our present
electoral system, especially as applied to
municipal government, and how to cure them
is one of the important questions of the times.
The movement in Cleveland indicates an
awakening of public sentiment which might
well be imitated elsewhere, whether the plan
is in full or not.
A U0JJ-'H0M0L0G0U8" ADMINISTRATION.
There is a great deal of individualism in
the present administration. Everybody has
noticed the difference between a well-organized,
well-trained company of theatrical per
formers and one composed of amateurs. The
former work to a common end, play into one
another's hands and pull together; the latter
do precisely the reverse, each one grinding
his own organ and playing his own tune.
The present administration is an amateur
one. Its members do not seem to have re
hearsed. They do not seem to know the
play nor even their own parts. They go
about it in shovel and tongs fashion, all pull
ing in different directions and every fellow
for himself. There ought to have been a full
dress rehearsal before the Presfdent's message
and the department reports were issued, to
have enabled them to come to an understand
ing, then perhaps we should not have had
the President and hi3 secretaries and sub
ordinates taking such opposite views of
things. Now we have the Secretary of the
Treasury advising that the surplus be placed
in the national banks where it would be
available for business, and he adds, "as this
is the best use to make of this money, I
advise it." The President 6ays in his mes
sage, "the proposition to deposit money held
by the government in banks throughout the
country, for use by the people, is, it seems to
me, exceedingly objectionable in principle."
Now if they had rehearsed the play before
giving a public performance this could not
have occurred. The absurdity of such op
posite sentiments would have been discovered,
and one or the other would have been stricken
out. Again, Postmaster-general Vilas recom
mends the erection of new postofnee buildings
in a very large number of towns, evidently
intending to utilize the surplus in this way;
the Secretary of the Navy urges the building
of a navy, and the Secretary of War recom
mends the construction of coast defenses,
each one implying that his is the proper way
to utilize the surplus. The President, who
really has the leading part, pays no attention
to the frivolous suggestions of his subs, but
recommends that the surplus be abolished,
root and branch, by reducing the revenue.
But the funniest break of all is that made by
Colonel Switzler, Chief of the Bureau of
Statistics. While the Cablet officers
were practicing their several parts
and formulating recommendations regard
less of the President's message, Colonel
Switzler was getting up a side-show
of his own on the wool question. He ought
to have known that the President was load
ing up on wool, but evidently he did not. It
is equally evident the President did not
know Colonel Switzler was loading up. They
each loaded and fired at will, and, sad to say,
they fired into one another. This never
could have happened if there had been a re
hearsal. The President presents an elabor
ate statement of the wool question in support
of his free-trade argument, and Colonel
Switzler deliberately knocks it to pieces.
Colonel Switzler, it should be remarked, . is a
good Democrat from Missouri. While the
President was evolving his message depreci
ating the importance of the wool industry.
Colonel Switzler was contemplating with
profound satisfaction his report on "Wool
and Manufactures of Wool," now completed
and ready for distribution. To show how
divergent are their views, we quote from the
President's message and his subordinate's
report. "When the number of farmers en
gaged in wool-raising," says the President,
"is compared with all the farmers in the
country, and the small proportion they bear
to our population is considered; when it is
made apparent that in the case of a large part
of those who own sheep, the benefit of the
present tariff on wool is illusory; and, above
all, when it must be conceded that the in
crease of the cost of living caused by such
tariff becomes a burden on those with moder
ate means, and the poor, the employed and
unemployed, the sick and well, and the
young and old, and that it constitutes a tax
which, with relentless grasp, is fastened
npon the clothing of every man, woman and
child in the land, reasons are suggested why
the removal or reduction of this duty should
be included in a levision of our tariff laws."
So much for the President. Now for the
other side. "The wool industry of the Uni
ted States, " says Col. Switzler, chief of
the bureau of statistics, "has assumed
such proportions and importance, and
the calls for information in respect
to it are so numerous, as to justify a special
report, more or less exhaustive, presenting
the history of its development and disclosing
its present condition and future possibilities."
The report embraces 400 pages bristling
with statistics of the wool industry. They
show, among other things, that the total num
ber of sheep in the United States increased
from 33,7S3,600in 1S75 to 44,759,314 in 18S7.
Col. Switzler gives the holdings by States and
adds:
"That the industry is of increasing interest
and value to the people of the United States
will be plainly seen by the statistical totals of
the progress of sheep-raising and of the manu
factures of wool."
If the administration had had a rehearsal
on the wool question the President and Col.
Switzler would never have locked horns like
this. The report gives pages and pages of
statistics to show how the wool industry and
woolen manufactures have developed under
the present tariff, how wages have increased
and how widely and generally the people have
benefited by the protection of this branch of
industry. The report furnishes a complete
answer to the Presidents misstatements of
the wool question and will be an admirable
campaign document for Republicans next
year. It is another evidence of the troubles
that beset an amateur administration.
IN the cemments made on the L&bkovitz
decision the Journal by no means intended
to convey the impression that the law had been
distorted for the first time in the interest of
the liquor law-breakers. On the contrary, quite
the reverse. The Journal is perfectly aware
that the distortion of law and the defeat
of substantial justice is the history of the
Supreme Court upon the question, and that
anything different is the exception. We do
not forget the remarkable decision that the
Supreme Court could not know that a gill was
a less quantity than a quart, and it is not a
su rprise to be told that the court in the Lab
kovitz case simply followed precedents as aged
as 1877, when it said:
"We understand the rule to be that when,
in a case like this, a single sale only is charged
in the indictment and the evidence shows
that there have been several sales of the same
kind made within the period of time covered
by the indiciment, the prosecuting attorney
should be requested so to do to elect which
sale the State will insist upon for a conviction
before the defendant is called upon for his de
fense." '
That the Court followed precedent only
makes the comments of the Journal more
pertinent and truthful. In 1877, as in 1887,
the decision of the Court is to make the con
viction of a law-breaker more difficult. If a
liquor-seller can sell one hundred times on a
Sunday, or any other illegal day, the sales
covering a period of ten hours, it would be
absolutely impossible to convict. The prose
cuting attorney would be compelled to elect
whether he would conclude himself to a sale
made at ten minutes past 9 o'clock, for in
stance, and if the law-breaker could prove an
"alleybi" of five or ten minutes, either before
or after that precise time, by showing that h e
sold at 9:05 and also at 9:15, the proof is confus
ing and the law-breaker goes acquit. The de
cision, the rule of evidence it makes, puts a
premium upon law breaking. It would never
have been thought of except as a defense to
liquor-law violators, who have so long Jjeeni
the pets of political parties and of courtsiihat
the rule is to distort the law in 'heir interest
-; i
and to shield them from righteo is penalties
for their crimes. As the Journal saicf the 1
time is coming, and is not far off, when the
people will see to it that this white-aproned
fraternity of law-breakers obey the Ijtw, and
pay the penalties of their crimes like
other criminals, and the courts that stand in
the way, or attempt to prevent that righteous
consummation, will be swept out of existence.
The people not infrequently reverse the de
cisions of Supreme Courts.
The Press, of New York, summing up the
reasons why Mr. Lamar will receive the uni ted
support of the Democracy in the Senate for
Supreme Judge, says:
"When Mr. Lamar and his Democratic
friends were about to place Jeff Davis's name
on the pension rolls there was an old-time JSe-t
publican, who always preached old-fashioned)
Republicanism, who arose in the Senate, and, S
with ringing words, he called the Republican!
Senators to duty. Such a speech as Zach,
Chandler made at that time would . bo as
effective in keeping Lamar off the Supreme
Bench as Chandler's speech was in keeping
Davis's name off the pension rolls.,
"How the people are longing for a little old
fashioned Republicanism."
The Press is quite right when it says the
people are longing for a little old-fashioned
Republicanism. If it can infuse a 'little of
that sort of tonic into the flabby and wishy-
washy New Yorkers, it will have given good
reason for its existence, and will be entitled
to the thanks of the party the country over.
New York Republicanism is weak and 'nerve-j
less. It has not deserved success, and has not
achieved it. In States where
Republic.
ans have not been afraid to say their
soul3 were . their own, and to call
a spade a spade, and to make a canvas
on something else than mere "business"
questions, they have won deserved and re
markable success. The Republicans will not
make the mistake next year of predicating the
whole campaign on New York and lowering
their canvass to the New York pitch. Let New
York come up into the good old Republican at
mosphere, where a man is a man, and the
rights of man count for as much in determin
ing the policy of a party as the "business"
question of how much per cent, the "busi
ness" men of New York can make.
INDIANA was carried by the Republicans
last year on the vote to send General Harri
son back to the Senate by a plurality of nearly
11,000, and -upon the popular vote for State
officers by nearly 4,000. New Jersey has
just been carried by the Republicans by a
plurality of 2,619. Virginia has just been
carried by a plurality of about 5,000," and in
one district in North Carolina there has been
change enough in the vote as cast two years
ago to give the State to the Re
publicans. Do these figures indicate that
the Republicans are compelled to
look
New
alone to New York to elect a President?
York, with its thirty-six votes, is a very nice
thing to have, but the Republicans must re
member they can elect without it, and shape
their canvass and campaign to that end. We
should like to see the national committee
"cut loose" in the South, as did General Sher
man in his march to the sea, flanking the De
mocracy and cutting the Confederacy in two,
taking in Indiana. Let the song of the next
campaign be, "Marching through Georgia. "
The argument which most pleases our es
teemed contemporary, the News, and which it
comp lacently imagines to be conclusive, is
that the Democrats are at least one-half of the
people of the United States and are as much
interested in the welfare of the country as the
Republicans, and, therefore, when it is
charged that they are favoring a policy that
will break down American manufactures and
destroy the prosperity of the country they are
charged with what is impossible and absurd
in the nature of the case, the charge only
bringing ridicule upon him who makes it. If
our friend were a little older this argument
w ould not appear so conclusive to it. Before
the advent of the News, and when the people
who are now so rash in the conduct of all sub
lunary things were very, very new,. the Dem
ocrats formed a much larger relative propor
tion of the people than now, and yet they
then urged a policy as utterly destructive of
the prosperity of the country as the one they
advocate now, and, beside, it was morally
monstrous and wrong. The Democracy were
as solidly in favor of slavery then as of free
trade now; indeed, the one is the "twin relic
of barbarism" that has survived the war. It
is not, therefore, entirely conclusive against
the force of a charge that a certain policy is
destructive of the best interests of the coun
try, to say that a party that comprises one
half of the people favor it. The Democracy,
doubtless, feel just as certain that free trade
is for the best as they did , that slavery was
for the best, but that fact does not do away
with the righteousness of a contrary belief or
the soundness of an argument against tree
trade any more than as to slavery. The
espousal of a cause or a dogma by even a ma
jority of the people does not make that cause
or dogma right and just. It may be as bad
and unjust with that degree of support as
without it. Numbers is not the only quality
in determining the value and propriety of a
thing. - -
The New York Sun gives the official figures
of the recent election in New Jersey, where
the principal issue was the election of a suc
cessor to Senator McPherson next year, the
State Senators now elected to take part in the
choice. Mr. William Walter Phelps was the
avowed Republican candidate for the succes
sion, and the canvass was made as much in
his interest as the late election in Indiana was
for the return of General Harrison to the Sen
ate. The Sun says the total vote comes with
in 29,000 of the total cast for President in
1884, and is 23,000 greater than the last with
which it can properly be compared, that of
1883, the year before a presidential election.
It says under the lead of a strong protection
ist, as Mr. Phelps is, the Republicans carried
the State by a plurality of 2,619 over the
Democratic candidates. The Sun adds that
these facts are known in New Jersey, and
that they should be known in Washington as

to its free-trade friend in the White House.
The supervising architect of the Treasury
plans and superintends the erection of all
p government buildings. The present incum
bent of the office is an architect of local reputa
tion and limited experience from New Orleans.
A Washington special says that "with the in
crease of prosperity in the Southern States,
and the gradual diversion of appropriations
for public buildings in that section, rather
than the West and North, it has become
necessary for the supervising architect to
make a special study of those forms and plans
of buildings that will be suited to the Southern
climate." Just so.' We have noticed a constantly-growing
tendency on the part of this
administration to 6tudy the forms and plans
of things suited to the Southern climate.

f The London correspondent of the New
,York Tribune says the President's message
i"w8 rflc.fiivfid in "Rncrland with an ArnroiuiiAn
of joy." After a residence of several
years in London, he says "I have never met
an Englishman who doubted that if the
United States would but adopt free trade,
British fabrics would speedily drive American
fabrics out of American markets." They
might not immediately, but they would as
fast as the process could go on of leveling
down wages in this country to the British
standard.
Its habit of blaming everything upon Mr.
Blaine leads the Boston Herald to say that
"The statement that the British press is
exultant over the Presid ent's message is one
of those reckless misstatements which, in the
mouth of Mr. Blaine, afford another and a
not unimportant proof of how unfit a man he
is for the presidency."
This charge would have more weight
were it not for the fact that the public has
gained its knowledge of the feeling of the
British press directly from the cabled editor
ial utterances of the leading newspapers.
The Herald will have to try again.

Some people may find it difficult to under
stand how civil-service reform is promoted by
Acting Commissioner Stockslager's removal
of one of Lamar's appointees in order that he
may give the place to an Indianian, but such
persons do not look at the matter in the right
light. The idea of the Indiana Democracy
s
is, that true civil-service reform consists of a
policy that will give the pick of the offices to
Hoosier Democrats, and it was npon this
principle, undoubtedly, that Mr. Stockslager
acted.
An inquisitive subscriber, who asks, in regard
to a suddenly deceased evening paper, what it

hereby informed that its noble intention was to
'revolutionize journalism." At least such is the
general impression gained from its own editorial
utterances and from collateral evidence. As a
revolutionizer it was not an entire success, but
probably it would have accomplished more had
it not been called hence. Its erstwhile editors
can take comfort from the reflection that the
good die young.

According to that well informed writer, M.
Colani, of La Republique Francaise, Prince Bis
marck would gain authority by the death of the
Crown Prince. "With William H on the throne,"
he says, "the Chancellor will continue to be all
powerful. His personal authority will grow
fctronger and stronger at home, whilst abroad
will be continued the policy of enslaving Europe
by alliances, and if necessary by war. Whether
the old n.mperor live a lew years longer or not.
Bismarck may hencef orth be considered the
Mayor of the Palace. The disappearance of the
Crown Prince from the political stage is, there
fore, a much graver event " than is imagined at
the imperial palace or in the Wilhelmstrasse."

Kalloeh, he s&id, was born in Maine, and occu
pied the pulpit or Iremont Temple, Boston. He
came to this city later. In 1870 he went to
Kansas City, where he was snperintendent of a
new railroad running into Kansas City, and
afterwards went into politics. "He went to
California about 1872." said Mr. Kearney, "and
was pastor of the Baptist Metropolitan Temple.
At that period times were exceedingly lively in
California; the anti-Chinese question was red-
hot, and the adoption of a new State Constitu
tion was being discnsBrd. Mr. Kalloeh espoused
both measures, and identified himself with our
party the Workingmen's party. Metropolitan
Temple held 10,000 people, and Kallocn threw
open the doors every night and addressed the
workingmen of the city. I was present at the
convention which nominated him for Mayor,
and, although I liked the man, I was opposed to
any minister dabbling in politics. For this rea
son I did not support him.
"Every newspaper in the State except the
Angeles Express and the Placer Herald op
posed a sew Constitution, but Kalloeh was an
able and magnetic speaker, and got into the
good graces of the people, and we carried the
new Constitution by 11,000 majority. The main
idea of the Constitution was to get the old-fogy
officff-helders and the" monopolists oat. and we
did it. Kalloeh made a good Mayor. Ik was
while he was running for Mayor that he was
shot by Charlie De Young. The San Francisco
Chronicle had attacked Dr. Kalloeh and his
father in a most scandalous manner, and Kal
loeh retaliated from the pulpit by attacking the
De Young boys, Charles and Michael, and re
flecting on their mother's virtue.
"The day after he did ao, Charlie De Yonng
went to Dr. Kalloch's boose, on Castro and Sev
enteenth streets, and sent a messenger boy in
to see if he was at home. He was not there.
De Yonng and bis two messengers were driven
to the Temple. De Yonng sont one into the
study to tell Kalloeh that a lady wished to
speak with him, and that she was in the coupe.
Kalloek fell into the trap. He hurried out, and
as be approached the carriage Charlie De
Yonng raised the blind and fired. The shot
took effect in Kalloch's left breast, r lanced off
the ribs, and located in his back. The second
shot was fired as Kalloeh ran towards his study,
and took effect in the middle of the body. Kal
loeh was carried into his study, and remained in
the Temple two weeks. The crowd overturned
Da Tonne's conns, and wonld have lviehed. him
bat for the detectives present. De "toung was
hustled into another coupe, and t&en to the
city prison for safe-keeping.
"Next day a mass-meeting was he! on the
and lots, opposite the City Hall, and It was re
solved to break into the jail and neh De
Youne. I was out of town, but teleeriphed the
leaders not to be rash, as I would be uth tbem
that night. Two weeks later the ballet was re
moved from Kalloch's thigh, and two months
afterwards the bullet was eat from his back.
Charles De Young was then released oi $20,00C
baiL Through bis influence the trial was put
off from time to time. Then, while sill crip
pled and ill, Kalloeh assumed his daties a
Mayor. He still retained the pastorat of Met
ropolitan Temple. During bis admirstration
as Mayor the Chronicle attacked Kalloeh, and
this so preyed npon the mind of Rev. . Isaac M.
Kalloeh, his son, that he determined to kill one
or both of the De Youngs. He saw. Charlie De
Youne enter the bnsiness office at the Cirooiele,
followed him and fired, the ballet going through
De Young's silk hat. De Young eronibed be
hind the counter, and Kalloeh sprung ipon it.
When De Youne looked up to see where his as
sailant was Kalloeh shot him in the moith. kill
ing him. Isaac was arrested, tried tad as
quitted, and it was thoroughly understood is
California that a man wiping out a Db Young
was doing a service to the people of the State.
. "Isaae is now practicing law at Sonota. Tuol

"The elder Kalloeh resigned his pastorate and
did not again ran for the mayoralty, bat was ad
mitted to the Supreme Court bar. although be

to Whatcom. W. T., and opened a law office.
Two years ago he sold his San Francisco resi
dence for $7,000 and became a citizen of the
Territory. He was a very tall and handsome,
man. and weighed at least 250 pounds. He wai

WESTERN WOOL.
A Texas Wool-Grower Who Saya Rula Will
Follow a Reduction of the Tariff.
St. Louis Post-Digpatch.
Ernst Knestner, a large wool-grower of New
Brannfels, Tex., who has been in the citv foi
several days, fell into conversation with a re
porter in the corridor of the Laclede Hotel con
cerning the present condition of the wool market
and the effect that a lowering of the tariff would
have upon the wool-growing interests of th
country. "The different wool-producing sec
tions would be affected in . very different de
grees by the removal of the tariff upon wool."
said Mr. Kuestner, "as the wool industry is not
simple, but very eomplex in its nature. Should
tb a gates be let down, and foreign wool be ad
mitted free, or the present tariff materially re
duced, the ruin of every sheep man west of the
Missouri would follow, and we of Texas would
be tbe greatest and most immediatf
sufferers. The farmers of Missouri, Ilii
bois, Indiana, Ohio and the Eastern States
eenerallv wonld infTer. hnt not nearlv ta th
same extent. Tbe reason of this is that in tbe
Eastern States none but fine breeds of sheen
are raised, the wool is washed, and is generally
far better than that from the sheep ranges of
the West. Tbe result of a reduction of the
tariff would be the flooding of the market witS
an immense quantity of South American wool.
the Argentine Republie being one of the great
est sheep countries in the world. These sheep.
like those of our Western ranches, range at
large, and are not carefully shedded every night.
neither is the wool washed on the animal's back
before shearing, as is the ease in our Eastern
States. It therefore would not enter into direct
competition with oar farm wool, bat would
drive from the market that produced by the
ranges, where wool is grown under similar con
ditions.' To understand the question it should '
be borne in mind that tbe Eastern breeds of
sheep belong to tbe English varieties, principally
merinoes, though there are some Cots wolds, the
latter, however, being principally valuable, for
their mutton. The basis of the Texas, New Mexico
and Colorado nocks, on the other hand, is the
Mexican sheep, which from its hardiness and
ability to resist the inclemencies of the weather,
will live where better breeds cannot exist The
difference in wool-producing capaeity, not to
speak of the quality, is great, a fine merino
shearing from twelve to fourteen pounds., while
two and a half is a large average for a Mexican
flock. Of coarse, the Mexican breed has been
repeatedly crossed to improve the wool-bearing
capacity, but this crossing cannot be carried
very far without rendering the sheep too delicate)
to stand any severities of climate. In Colorado
they have produced a cross that shears from six
to eight pounds, bat the terrible losses of the
last few years nave proved that tbU
sheep is not hardy enough. . In .rtew
Mexico a four-pound fleece is as bizu
as most flock 8 averaeo, and a eix-pound clip
is good for Texas. These weights are bat little
higher than those of the Argentine Republic,
and the wool is of about the same grade, and
would therefore directly compete with. us.
There is no question whatever that the South
American wool is far cheaper, and its admis
e ion free would render it utterly impossible
for a single sheep-raiser to continue in the
business. . '.
ROBERT T. LINCOLN. .
What Would Be the Effect of Patting th
President's Yiews Into Operation.
Chicago Journal.
"You will have to allow me to confess that I
have neither read the President's message nor
Mr. Blames letter, said Hon. Robert T. Liu-
coin to a reporter when asked for his views on
tbe political situation as affected by those arti
cles, "and. therefore, I am in no position to ex
press any opinion on them. The truth is I have
been spending my whole time, night and day al
most, in attending to my own private business,
which is of much more importance to me person
ally than the political situation, of which I ant
at present in total ignorance. I may say. how
ever, in a general way, that I think Judge Caton,
who is a good old Democrat, expressed tbe whole
gist of the matter in a nutshell in a little article
I saw published as coming from him, when he
said that he thought it would be a good thing to
have the President's views put into, effect, be
cause it would result in the closing up of every
manufacturing establishment in the country
within a year, and would thereby effectually set
tle the dispute between capital and labor. I
think that that, eommg from a trood old Demo
crat, is a very forcible description of the present
political situation. While 1 do not agree with
Judge Caton that that would be a good thing to
do, I am strongly inclined to believe that were
the President views to be given practical effect
it would have that unfortunate result."
Reasons for Lamar1! Confirmation.
New York Press.
These are the reasons why Mr. Lamar may
expect a united vote of Democratic Senator
for confirmation to a placa , on the Supreme
Bench.
First Before leaving the Senate he declared
that he would not sit quiet and hear Jefferson
Davis denounced as a traitor to his country.
Second As Secretary of the Interior almost
Mr. Lamar's first official aet was to order the:
American flag at half-mast over the Interior
Department on the announcement of the death
of "Jake" Thompson, wbo was at the head oi
a conspiracy to flood the Northern States daring
the war with elothing infected with yellow
fever and smallpox.
Third Within tbe past year Secretary Lamar
defended, with all the vigor of language ha
could command, Calhoun and Calhoumsm.
Fourth Mr. Lamar was debarred from prac
ticing before the federal court in bis own State
for assaulting a witness who was testifying ia
an election outrage case.
Fifth When Prect Matthews and other
native-born citizens residing in Copiah county.
Miseissippi were notified that if they attempted
to vote the Republican tieket they would oa
murdered, and the threat was carried oat,. Sena
tor Lamar never uttered a word in denunciation
of the brutal murder.
These are all good reasons for united Demo
cratic support, barely tbe itepuoncans wno
propose to vote for Lamar's confirmation wil
not do so for any of these reasons. : ...
