The financial stringency and Wall

appear to have plenty of it.

St. Louis Republic: The net result
of last week's work in Washington in

waterway improvement.

The strong recommendations of the

general admission that our inland

necessary to the country's commer

be conclusively persuasive with con

As I stood there a voice came sweet
ly to my ears, and a hand was laid
timidly on my arm. 1
"It seems such a pity, Jamie, such
a dreadful thing to have happened!,

My pulse leaped at the sound of her
voice. If I could have had her. what
would I have cared for any other loss
in the whole world? '
"There are many worse things In
life, girlie," I answered, smiling at
her. "I shall do the work again;
that's all. It wouldn't do to let my

It was such a baiting little voice
and such a delicious liirle pink face
raised to mine. I kissed the trembling
lips with one long, thankful touch.
and whe:i I let the little girl go from

"Would you rather have lost tbe

A Beautiful Shakespearean Calendar.
Among the many pleasing calendars

It consists of three beautiful heads by
C. Allen Gilbert portraying 'Rosalind.
Juliet and Portia. Shakespeare's three
leading heroines. Mr. Gilbert has ong
been conceded to be one of the great

heads, and his conception of these
