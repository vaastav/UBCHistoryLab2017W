PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Owing to the great length of this document and
the crowded state of our columns we are unable to
publish more than a short synopsis of it. After
eulogizing the vastness of our national domain and
the unlimited resources sufficiently abundant for the
support of 500,000,000 people, he returns thanks to
the Almighty for the prosperous condition of the
country and the countless blessings of which we are
the recipients, and then plunges in medeas res re
verting to the late war, asserting that eleven States
tt fter its close were left without any legal State Gov
ernment, kc.
He condemns the action of the Georgia Legislature
iu unseating the negro members of that body, and
recommends the passage of an Act authorizing the
Governor at an early day to convene the members
originally elected and to require them to take the
iron-clad oath.
He eulogizes the Southern negroes on their rapid
progress in learning, and for their industry; refers
to the Southern elections aud suggests that American
commerce requires the fostering care of Congress.
Upon the currency question aud the national debt
he recommends a gradual resumption of specie pay
ments by authorizing the Treasury to redeem its
paper at & fixed price when presented, ami to with
hold from circulation all such currency redeemed
until sold again for gold; recommends the funding
of the national debt at a rate of interest not exceed
ing 4' 4 per cent.
As to the question of Internal taxation, he suggests
the postponement of the subject until the next meet
ing of Congress, but advises a renewal of the tux on
incomes at a reduced rate of three per cent.
In regard to Cuban affairs he makes no suggestions
or recommendations whatever. He barely mentions
the Darien Ship Canal, except to say that efforts are
being made to have a survey completed to determine
its practicability. He states his action in seizing the
Spanish gun boats, but says that the whole matter
has Ut n turned over to the courts to decide.
In reference to the Alabama Claims he gives no
encouragement of their ever being settled, lie op
poses a reciprocity treaty with Canada, saying the
benefits accruing therefrom would be entirely on the
side of the Canadians. He opposes monopolies of
ocean telegraphic cables; complains of foreigners
who come to the United States for the sole purpose
of being naturalized and then return to their native
country and conceal the fact of their being natural
ized until they get into troubles and then claim pro
tection as American citizens-.
He seems anxious that more intimate relations
should exist between China and tin- United States,
aud for the benefit of Mr. F. F. 1 w recoruim mis
that the missiou to China he- ra:-- 1 to one of tin- first
e'lass.

that the Quaker p '■ y will prove succt ssful in
the end. He call-atti-iiri,.n to the reports <-f the va
rious Cabinet *. rtic«srs. an 1 concurs in their recom
mendation*;. After calling their attention particularly
to the r<. ointuendatious of the Postmaster General,
he advises a total abolition of the franking privilege.
vs* have enumerated only a few of las recommen
dations, but in the latter part of the message is what
we consider the best and most sensible suggestion
to be found in the whole document, and that is call
ing their attention to the inadequacy of the salaries
of the Judges of the Supreme Court. After r. ading
it carefully we cannot but * ntortain a higher opinion
of the ability (lib rary, at least) of Mr. Attorney Gen
eral H>sar, who undoubtedly wrote it. 'I he paper
| reads well, and as a literary production will compare
! favorably with the State papers of previous occu
pants of the White House.
LATEST FROi* LOON CREEK.
Judge Shepherd, of Shepherd** Loon Creek Ex
press has handed ns the following letter, from Ins
Agent at Oro Grande, with permission to publish it:
Oro Grande, Dec. 9, 1869.
There was quite an incitement lure last week
about a prospect having been found on the Middle
Fork of Loon creek, in Smith's District, about three
miles from Oro Gran
nts to the pan and only
two feet deep, with plenty of water. About seventy
five claims were recorded, and the prospects look
very favorable for good diggings in the upper district.
On the 2d inst. a party ot eight arrived from Mon-
tana, bringing animals all the way through, and re-
port about two feet of snow on th** divides and about
ten inches in Leesburg. "Ibey came well "heeled
and calculate to invest.
- The tunnels are still ir. active operati- n, but it will
take some time yet to test matters.
Mining iu the creek lias ceased for the winter —
Loon creek being frozen over in several places. A
prospect has also been found in the lower discoveries
and raanv are strolling down that way to "file. Our
camp promises better than ever for another season.
We have "stag" dances two and three times a we* k,
and a general "blow-out" on Friday evening next is
in anticipation. Yours, kc. J
We have been shown the prospect taken from the
Middle Fork of Loon creek, which weighs about 35
cents. It was brought in by Mr, Tassell, Shepherd's
Express messenger, who arrived on Tuesday evening
_four days from Or» Grand*. He was accompanied
by Mr. Jas. McDevitt and Mr. Houston of Centerville,
and Mr. Coaler of Montana, who is eu route to Boise
City but intends returning to Loon creek.
Mr. Tassell informs us that on liis road out to Oro
Grande be shot a mountain sheep with his revolver,
and he says that game appears to be abundant in
that section of the country.

ifornia effected an organization on the 7th of Decem

change is quite significant to say the least of it.
