FOB TWO STATES.
With the <»penin? of Congress thp question of
statehood for all of our contiguous territory
which is stil! unadmitted cornea again to the
front. The President in his message recom-
mends two states, one to be composed «>f
Oklahoma and Indian Territory and the other
of Arizona and New-Mexico. The Kevoridjre-
Hamilton »i"!l to carry out this project, which
went through the Iluim> of Representatives at
the la?t session, will be pushed again and will
probably pass. A.l least it is dear thai it' it
does not pass no new states will be admitted
for some time to come. The advocates of four
Btates mijjht just as we!! realize the iin[M>ssi
bility of accomplishing their purpose, and those
whose, real aim fes not obstruction, so as to per
petuate the territorial condition for their own
purposes, are l»?^iri!)'.n^ to take that view.
In Arizona and New-Mexico, where the p«*]>.i
rai* statehood J.-.i had most to comnM-nd it.
n!auy prominent citizens and newspapers have
»>:>. iii converted to joint statehood. These terri-
Tories have been organized lons enough to have
t. tain individuality and pride in remaining
t-epariite. S"evertheles«. they would soon coa*
;«*ce, and if they should enjoy a development
ralVu-ient to justify aduii«sion even as a single
state die remembrance of their boundary
wcKiid be swept away. Ihe two together nave
<!iversilied Industrie which give promise of a
stable eiate. Arizona alone, which is of the
two more anxioß* 'or separation, has no suffi
cient guarantee of a permanent population. The
mines may ptve out nnd leave it like .Nevada.
Irrigation may develop agriculture greatly, but
the area of mountain and irreclaimable desert
is tv> great for the population of the two terri
tories ever to exceed a convenient number for
a single state. Of course. Borne politicians
think two Governors and four Senators much,
better than half that number. The Pacific rail
road.-.- might be glad to strengthen their influ
ence in the United States Sen.;i!<- as much as
possible. The Arizona mining Interests would
rajoict: to bare a ginaU state of thair own, or a,
territory in which they would not have to pay
Just taxes. A large state which they did not
control might assess their property somewhere
near Us value. All these. together with some
I unselfish persons moved by sentimental reasons.
Hie against joint statehood. Other people In
.he two territories are increasingly for It. as the
only possible road to admission.
Separation of Oklahoma from Indian Terri
. Tory has even less to commend it. There is no
| historic demarcation. The line between the two
' has never been stable. Oklahoma was estnn
i Ushed In ISM without any idea of making a
separate territory, but only in order to form a
government for the people of that part of Indian
! Territory who were not subject to tribal rule.
It was in a sense the white government of
Indian Territory. Th« Jurisdiction extended
over a tract in the heart of the territory which
had been secured from the Indians and opened
to settlement. The act provided for the auto
matic addition to this province of other lands
which might be ceded by the Indians. So the
territory has grown, and the boundary between
it and Indian Territory is a wavy line without
geographical or political reason for permanency.
Aside from the politicians, who want as many
offices us possible, to distribute, the chief advo
cates of separate statehood for these two terri
tories are the adventurers, who are getting rich
in Indian Territory and want to remain undis
turbed. They doubtless understand that Con
gress would never think of making Indian Ter
ritory Into a state. Their agitation tends rather
to defeat any action and leave the people of
both Oklahoma and Indian Territory out in the
cold.
It is time for all who want to see these lands
enjoy the benefits of state government to get
together behind the only measure that can go
through, and thus free themselves from the
machinations of those whose appeal to local
pride is purely selfish. There is material there
for two good slates, and we should wel -ome
them. There is not material for four states,
and regard for the rights and power of the rest
of the country forbids giving any such unjust
weight in national affairs to thinly settled ter
ritoiy.
THE TREASI MY RE POUT.
In his annual report of the Treasury Depart
ment Secretary Shaw makes a number of recom
mendations which are pretty sure to receive the
cordial approval of the banking community and
of the business world in genera! For many
years there has been need in this country of a
more elastic currency. It is now suggested by
the Secretary that provision be made for an ad
ditional government guaranteed note circulation,
equal to 50 per <-pnt of a bank's bond secured
circulation, on new notes not to be secured by
bonds but to be subject to a tax of 5 or 6 per
c-ent. In the event of additional circulation of
this sort notes would not be issued untii interest
rates exceeded that percentage. In times of
monetary stringency call money under such a
provision would probably not advance to a pro
hibitive level, while the Treasury Department
would be relieved, as the Secretary says, of a
most embarrassing responsibility Secretary
Shaw further recommends that there should be
an act providing that the Panama bonds and all
future issues of government bonds shall be made
available as security for note circulation subject
To a tax of one-half of 1 per cent. Such an en
actment would naturally tend to relieve the
money market at times when there happened to
be a scarcity of approved government collateral
against new issues of national bunk notes, and
this feature of the Secretary's report will, we
Think, be generally commended by bankers and
men of affairs.
Secretary Shaw in his suggestions does not go
beyond the limit of conservative banking prin
ciples, while lie projwses many reforms which,
if cd*»pted. will serve to increr.se the efficiency
of the national Treasury Department in pro,not
ing healthy financial conditions in this country.
An act providing for the recoinage into subsid
iary money of abraded and uncurrent silver
dollars in amounts not exceeding $5,000,000; a
revision of the customs administrative act. in
cluding the licensing of customs brokers and at
torneys: a change In the law relative to draw
backs so as to permit properly safeguarded sub
stitution, similar to that thus allowed in France,
and the establishment of a savings bank for the
convenience of government officers in Washing
ton are among the interesting proposals which
the Secretary makes and which It is to be hoped
the present Congress will take into careful con
sideration, of greater importance, but more
likely to encounter strong opposition, is his rec
ommendation that a law be enacted giving trust
companies of large capitalization the privilege
of incorporating under federal law. with corre
sponding supervision, and that they should be re
quired to keep an ample reserve In proportion to
their deposits.
It will be noted with gratification that govern
ment receipts for the fiscal year ended June .'>o
show an increase as compared with the preced
inz twelve months, while in the same time expen
ditures were less by more than $15,000,000, leav
ing an excess of expenditures over revenues of
about 523.000,000. It should be borne in mind
that while in the last two years the outgo has
been largely In excess of the income, the greater
part of the excess payments has been on Pan
ama Canal account. The general condition of
the Treasury is such as to inspire confidence
that in the current fiscal year results will be
even more encouraging, especially as current re
ceipts rire now running in excess of expenditures
the surplus, as it may be called, so far in the
current month amounting to more than $2,000,
000. Ii is interesting to record the fact that the
interest bearing debt of The Tinted States is only
$895,158.^40, an amount extremely small ns comp
ared with the interest bearing debts of other
leading nations. The United States Treasury "is
strong. It is prepared to safeguard the interests
of the country, and all indications point toward
nn expansion in 11s resources which will directly
reflect the national growth and prosperity. There
is. moreover, nothing In the report to encourage
an idea among speculators that the Secretary of
the Treasury will b#lp them out of any holes
into which they may fall through their own fool
ish indiscretions.
BRITISH LIBERAL ACCESSION.
Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman has acted
with Judgment and patriotism in accepting the
King's commission to form a new government.
It bar-: been argued— perhaps. In America
than in Enghaid— that he should refuse to do so.
and should seek to compel the Balfouf Ministry
Itself to assume the responsibility of dissolving
Parliament. We have seen no convincing force
in that argument. It has been said Unit Mr.
Halfour has acted without precedent In 'resign
ing during a recess of Parliament, and that be
should have awaited the reassembling of the
House, and have let his Ministry be defeated on
an important division. With that view we can
not agree. Mr. Balfour has done what Ix>rd
Melbourne did In 1884. and what Sir Robert. Peel
did in 184f>, and those precedents are ample.
Neither is it a "trick." as some nave said, or
an unusual thins, for the Conservatives thus to
turn affairs over to the Liberal minority. The
same thing happened in June. 1895, when the
Liberal government under Lord Roseheiy re
signed, and Lord Salisbury, with only a mi
nority of the House of Commons to support him,
took office. Lord Salisbury did not. on that
occasion! shrink from the responsibility. He
took office, and as soon as possible dissolved
Parliament and appealed to the country— and.
by the way. won a Handsome majority at the
polls. There is no good reason why the Lib
erals should not similarly take office now, with
the same end in view.
In ISH-'i Lord Rosebery resigned on .Tone '22.
Lord Salisbury's government was announced on
June li.">. Parliament was dissolved on July H.
and a new Parliament was elected and sura
mooed to meet ou August 12. It may be that
NEW-YORK DAILY THIBi iNii, IHUKBDAV. DECEMBER 7, 1905.
Sir Henry C'ampbell-Banr.erman will act with
similar expedition, In which case the new Par
liament may i>e ready to meet in February
n*xf. In the mean time, the composition and
arrangement of the Liberal Cabinet will give
h distinct clew to the general policy to be
followed by that party in case it secures at
the polls a majority, or nt least a plurality,
of the House, .is it is widely expected txt
do. That composition and arrangement is not
yet disclosed, hut probably will be in a few
days. Thp chief curiosity of observers will be
to see whether or not Lord Bosebery is included.
For some days there have been confident pre
dictions that he will not be. Lord Rosebery is
a man of great ability, who should be a peculiar
ly valuable member Of a Cabinet. Moreover, he
has hitherto been Prime Minister, and thus is
entitled to ranch consideration. On the other
ha rul. there are many men of ability in the
party, enough to fill all offices acceptably with
out Lord Rosebery. The significance of his In
clusion or exclusion will not, therefore, relate to
governmental efficiency, hut rather to the atti
tude of the new Ministry toward the Ringle
question of Irish Home Rule. That is the one
question on which Lord Rosebery irreconcilably
differs from some other Liberal leaders. If he
is included in the new Ministry, we may as
sume that Home Rule bus been abandoned by
the Liberals, or at any rate has been placed In
abeyance. If lie is not included, it will be a
fair presumption that the Liberals will seek to
make and maintain an Irish alliance by means
of some measure of Home Rule acceptable to
the Nationalist leaders.
The now Prime Minister is reported to have
explained his attitude on Home Kule to his anti-
Home Rule colleagues, and to have devised a
policy that will satisfy the Nationalists with
out causing a new schism in his party. If so
be has don? an uncommonly shrewd thing, such
as none of his predecessors In the Liberal lead
ership were- ahie to do. It will be recalled that
in bis Stirling speech of November 2l\ he said
that in his opinion the only way of settling the
IrisL question was to let the Irish people man
ajro the!r own domestic affairs. That speech was
interpreted as committing him to the policy of
giving Ireland a Parliament of her own. It
created a decided sensation, and gave Lord
Bosebery, as he said the next night at Truro,
some misgivings as to the unity of the Liberal
party. On the other hand. Lord Rosebery, in
that Truro speech, positively declined to commit
himself upon a single item of policy, because, as
he explained, of the imminence of the general
election. It was, he said, desirable that no
voice shoald conflict with the united voice of
the Liberal party, and that whether by speech
or by abstinence from speech, they should do
all in their power to secure the largest Liberal
majority possible. That is to Bay, all contro
versial questions should be held in reserve until
after election. The country should be asked to
sijni a blank check, to be filled out by the Lib
erals after election. That, beyond doubt, would
be shrewd policy. But the exclusion of its pro
poser from the new Cabinet might be construed
as an Indication that it was not to be followed.
It will not escape notice that It may be pos
sible for the Conservative-Unionist party to put
all differences in abeyance and present a united
front at the pdils. just as Ix>rd Rosebery says
the Liberals and Radicals should do. The ques
tion of tariff reform might thus be dealt with as
readily as that of Home Rule— perhaps even
more easily. Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain
are supposed by some to be far apart on that
subject, yet Mr. Chamberlain hiinseV has not
more plainly than Mr. Balfour committed him
self against Cobdenlsm and laissez fairr, and in
favor of retaliatory tariffs against the hostile
tariffs of other lands. At the present time it
seems probable that the coming elections will be
vigorously contested, with no sure victory for
either side until the votes are counted. We must
remember that in I*;>l> the Liberals won only
270 seats. aj;:<i»st the L'tis of i\u> Conservatives
and 47 of the Liberal-Unionists, and so were
enabled to control the House only through alli
ance with the 81 Irish members. In 1895 the
Liberals got only 177. so that even with the 82
Irish votes they were unable to overcome the
."4it Conservatives and 71 Liberal-Unionists.
Finally, in 1900, the Liberals and Labor party
together got only I*<; seats, and with the 82
Irisii votes were in a hopeless minority before
the 334 Conservatives and 68 Liberal-Unionists.
These figures indicate how great a change must
be effected if even a Liberal-Irish coalition Is to
secure a majority, and how overwhelming must
be the revolution if the Liberals arc to win a
clear majority over ;>ll.
AGAINST TKKET SPECULATION.
The decision of the Court of Appeals in the
case of a theatre ticket speculator is a distinct
and important triumph for honesty and decency
and for the relief of the long suffering theatre
going public. !t is to the effect that a theatre
manager lihs. after giving due notice, a right to
refuse to honor tickets purchased from a side
walk speculator. In the case in question the
complaining speculator declared that such re
fusal on the part of the managers had destroyed
his business which had been paying him $4,000
a year. In that declaration there are two large
piei-es of food for thought.
One is the fact that this speculator had been
making $4.<HKi a year out of his trade. He had
been "cornering" the best seats in the house
and compelling people to pay exorbitant prices
for them. For the advance in price he gave no
compensation whatsoever. On the contrary, he
added ins-alt to injury by compelling people to
pay the extra price in an inconvenient, hole
and-corner fashion. In danger of pocket-picking
and "flim-flam" games, instead of paying the
smaller price in ;1 secure, comfortable and con
venient fashion. Multiplying the sum stated by
scores, we may get an approximate estimate of
the extent to which the thentregoing puhlie of
this city has been fleeced.
The other point is that the refusal o{ a
theatre to honor tickets which had passed
through the hands of the speculator broke up
the pernicious business. That is to say, the
taking of such simple and inexpensive action
by theatre managers would rid their patrons of
this abominable nuisance. All they have to do
is to make conspicuous announcement that
speculators' tickets will not be received, and
then actually rejeei a few such tickets. They
may be sure the public will do the rear. M Pn
will not buy tickets of speculators when they
know there is danger of their being rejected at
the door without relief to the holders. The
question, then, is whether the theatre managers
of this city care enough f<>\- the convenience
and welfare of their patrons to take that little
trouble (<>>■ their sake. If they do not do so.
they will run the risk of being suspected of in
difference to their patrons' welfare, or of beinp
"In cahoots*' wirh the speculator*.
THE BRIDGE JAM.
The Jam at the Brooklyn Bridge on Tuesday
evening has l»eon described as the worst ever
known. It vvns certainly bad en nigh to consti
tute a public scandal, but it was little worse
than similar jama which occur there practically
every evening and on th*» majority of morn
ings Several years ago there were great popa
lar agitations against what were then described
as intolerable conditions, and it was urged that
there must be Immediate relief or there would
be a local revolution. But no relief wan given,
and with the steady increase in travel the con
ditions which were described as "intolerable"
years ago hare been growing steadily worse.
There is little doubt that they are worse now
than ever before In the history of the bridge,
and It is not certain that any relief Is yet with
in sight, or within measurable distance. The
elaborate remodelling of the F'arl* Row terminal
may <!<> some good, and It may not.
Seeing that the heart, the centre, the vortex
of the jamming is at and la the cars. It seems
evident that the only real cure for it is In run
ning more cars. All the stairways and plat
forms in the world will not prevent congestion
if there are not cars enough to carry the people
away as fast as they arrive at the platforms.
Now. we have lx>en assured repeatedly that just
as many cars are being run on the bridge in
rush hours as it Is physically possible to run in
safety. That statement either is or is not true.
If it is true, then there can be no real relief in
the remodelling of the terminal. If it is not
true, then it is in the power of the operating
company to afford immediate relief by putting
on more cars.
Tli*»re are those who think more oars could
be put on. and that trains arp not now run as
frequently, even in rush hours, as they onro
W6re, when the city itself manajjpcl tho bridge
railroad. It is orrtuin that a sroat rioal of
abominable rrowdini? could be avoided by run
ning a few more trains at other thnn rusli
hours. In the morning, for an hour aftor rush
hours, when th*> double track service lias ceased
and trains are run on only one track, the crowd
in- at the Brooklyn end Is rften about jis bad
as It is at I'nrk How In the f-reninc; a state of
affairs that could be obviated simply by con
tinning the double track service an hour lanjrer.
At other times trains of only two cars are run,
and they are crowded in a most uncomfortable.
Indecent and dangerous mamrn*, when the ad
dition of one or two more cars to each train
would make travel comfortable and safe.
It may be doubted If fuil relief for the danger
ous and destructive jam at rush hours can ever
be secured until new avenues (if travel are
created across or under the East River. Rut
that is no reason why the jams at other hours
should not be remedied. It may be that the
operating company i.-, doing Its best for the rush
hour crowds, but the public would be more
surely convinced of the fact if there were evi
dence that the company was also doing its best
for the crowds in non-rush hours.

Recent events are rapidly confirming the truth
of "Big Tim" Sullivan's remark that "when a
"young feller takes a Job as election inspector
"nowadays he don't know whether he's to get
"$26 or three years in Sing Sing." though it may
be added that this uncertainty is now changing
to a certainty if the "young feller" commits or
connives at fraud.
Now is the time to remember that the early

A Norwegian writes that the genuine old form
of the name of the new King of his country is
Hakon. The name is made up of t-A-o roots, ha.
the root of liar, high, and kon or konr. of the kin.
family or race, ','hus Hakon means the "hi^h <>n<>
of the kin." The modern Norwegian spelling Is
Haakon. The "aa" sound like "aw" in hawk and
the "on" like the English word on. The accent is
on the first syllable.
Remembered the Text.— A little Topeka girl came
: home from church the other day and was asked
what the minister's text was. "I know it all
right " she asserted. "Well, repeat It." her ques
tioner demanded. "Don't be afraid and I will set
i you a bed quilt." was the astonishing answer. In
i vestiKation proved that the central thought of the
sermon had been "Fear not. and I will send you a

! The Rev. Edward Lloyd Jones, of Manchester.
England, is credited with having: originated the
phrase "the Grand Oid Man" as applied to Mr.
Gladstone. During the Irish Pgltation It became,
necessary that detective., should follow Mr. Glad
stone for the purpose of protection, and as the
Liberal leader lived at Hnwarden. in Flintshire,
that county then governed by Quarter Sessions,
was asked to pay the bill. The magistrates, nearly
all Tories in those days, objected. Whereupon Mr.
Lloyd Jones, who was then a minister at Rhyl,
promptly called an Indignation meeting. He asked
a lawyer who was present to s.tate whether, if the
life of a common tramp was In peri!, it was not
the duty of the county to protect him. The lawyer
■kid that undoubtedly It wm. "Then. 1 shouted Mr.
Jones, "if it is the duty of this county to protect
the beggar at our doors, are we going to allow the
precious life of that grand old man at Hawarden
to go unprotected?" That meeting settled the
Quarter Salons' objections, and the title stuck.
