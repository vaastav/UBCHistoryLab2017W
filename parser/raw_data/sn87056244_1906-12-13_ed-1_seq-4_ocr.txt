STATE STATISTICIAN DEAD.
Joseph H. Stubbs Dies at Indianapo
lis Thursday.
Joseph Stubbs, state statistician of
Indiana and who in the few years he
has been in office made as 'many
friends as any politician in Indiana,
died Thursday of Bright's disease.
He had been in ill health for ye,ars,
but kept going in spite of the pain
he suffered. During the. recent cam
paign it is thought he overworked
himself to a great extent.
Mr. Stubbs was a Quaker and one
of the best known members of that
church in Indiana. It was due to the
friendship of the Quakers that he was
first nominated to the office he held
at the time of his death. He created
many new statistical reports and is
credited with doing the best work of
any statistician in years. His figures
and facts were found to be of the
most interesting character, and all
were given publication.
Stubbs was for many years a trav
eling salesman and made political
friends for years before he asked for
the office. In the convention that
nominated him, somebody cast "So
many votes for bald-headed Joe
Stubbs. " This was taken good-natur
edly by everybody, and "Bald-headed
Joe Stubbs" was soon making his
speech of acceptance to the conven
tion.
Mr. Stubbs was re-elected in No
vember by the largest majority given
any man on the state ticket. His
new term would not have commenced
until January 1, and Governor Hanly
'have to appoint a man to fill the
vicancy for two years.
Tracewell Against Public Depositories
Robert J. Tracewell controller of
the United States treasury, is thor
oughly opposed to the plan of public
depositories which it is proposed to
inaugurate in Indiana. The control
ler also has given an expression of
his views to Governor Hanly. Tke
governor has no better friend than
he, their acquaintance dating back to
the time when they served together
as congressman from Indiana.
He Sard a few days ago to the
Washington correspondent of the In
dianapolis Star: "I hope that some
body who has influence and knowl
edge of the subject, will have the
nerve to stand up and protest against
the establishment of a system of pub
lie depositories in my state, so that
the legislators will not proceed blind
ly to enact such a law because it
seems to be in public favor. I believe
that if this contemplated reform were
fairly discussed in the. fight of impar
tial information the people would be
opposed to it. I do not hesitate to
say thtt I am earnestly antagonistic
to it, because I think that it is fun
damentally and unqualifiedly wrong
and that it will react in a way tLat
will be very disastrous to the inter
ests of the public. '
"If the Mate of Indiana "and the va
rious counties and municipalities con
stituting rt go into the money-lending
business there will be a continual in
centive to exact revenues from the
people by taxation simply for the
purpose of piling up large surpluses
to be loaned to the favorite banks.
A field will be opened or collusion
between the favored banks and the
taxing officers, and tax levies too
often will be fixed witlrout regard to
ihe needs of the public service simply
to accumulate funds for ihe banks to
traffic with under legal sanction.

One of the most efficient method

such adequate control and regulation
of the great interstate common car

which give rise to the agitation
against them. So the proper anödete

such is to secure by proper lcgisla

as if the exercise cf such govern

not a fact. It would be a veritable
