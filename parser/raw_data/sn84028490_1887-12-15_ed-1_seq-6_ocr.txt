IN HIGH DUDGEON. The Wool Growers Growling at the

of the frozen facts relative to the duties

The way in which wool tariff discus-

mark of Senator Coke, whose state of
Texas is greatest among sueep iuaiii
localities. He applauded the JL'resi
dent's message, eveu to the free wool,
but with the proviso that woolens
should also be free.
The Ohio wool men called on benator
Payne today, and afterwards upon Mr.
Foran. Mr. llarpster argued to the lat
ter that the whisky tax should be re
moved. Mr. Foran, while opposing
free wool, also refused to believe
that the country was prepared
for free whisky. This episode
hows that llarpster would advocate
anything that the tax on clothiug.blauk
ets, etc., could be made higher. These
are disconnected facts exhibiting the
status of the wool question. Another
valuable point is, that the bill that will
come from the ways and means com
mittee tvill not contain free wool, but
remove duty on the three coarsest
grades. It is thought that Ohio Dem
ocrats would vote for that generally.
The wool growers and dealers today
adopted a series of resolutions, declar
ing unjust the present classification of
wool bv the railroads of the country,
and directing that they be urgently re
quested to place wool in their new clas
sification on a basis that would at least
be equal to the present classifica
tions, as if classified as follows: Wool
in sacks, in quantities less than 10,000
pounds in car loads, second class; in
quantities greater than 10,000 pounds
in carloads, third class; wool compress
ed in bales, in quantities less than 20,
000 pounds, in carloads, third class; in
quantities greater than 20,000 pounds,
in carloads, fourth class. The confer
ence also passed a resolution declaring
that recent events have demonstrated
the necessity for a central organization
at Washington or elsewhere and with
that purpose in view request all wool
growing associations in the United
States to immediately send their ad
dresses to Albert Chapman at Middle
bury, Yt.
JUSTICE IS SLOW.
The Masons to be Tried for Murder at
Ashland.
Ashland, O., Dec. St. The leading
topic of conversation here this week has
been the probable action of the grand
jury in the case of the Mason brothers.
The jury lias been in session all week
and up to this morning had reported
no indictments. The jury is made up
of the wealthiest and best men in the
county. i. shanker, president of the
Loudonville bank, is foreman. Some
twenty witnesses were used by the jury
in the case, and their deliberations oc
cupied three davs. This morning they
returned an indictment charging C. D.
Mason and .lames K. Mason with
being the murderers of W. II.
Keynolds. The indictment averred
that the killinpf was of delib
erate and premeditated malice. Long
before the result of the deliberations of
the grand jury was known on the
streets a capias was issued and the
sheriff was looking for CD. Mason, and
shortly he was arrested and again plac
ed in jail in the cell which he occupied
before lie was released by the justice.
J. 11. Mason failed to furnish bail be
fore the justice issued the mittimus
and ifterward the judges refused to
allow him bail when the application
was made. The intimate friends and
companions of the Masons, Justice A.
ii. Beer, and especially the proprietors
of the liazette, are surprised and indig
nant at the action of the grand jury,
while on the other hand the grand
jury's action meets with almost general
approval by the the citizens of the city
and country.

A Dastardly Attempt to Assassinate M. Ferry---He is Seriously Wounded.
I'aiiis, Dec. 10, Special. -A das
tardly attempt has just been made upon
the life of M. Jules Ferry. While
walking in the lobby of the Chamber of
Deputies three shots from a revolver
were fired at him. M. Ferry fell griev

greatest excitement in and around
the Chamber. It is impossible
at this moment to get definite informa

SUDDEN DEATH.
Captain Blackford, a Stark County Man,
Departs this Life at Washington.
"Washington. Dec. U. Captain 8. S.
Blackford, who came to Washington
from Marlboro, Stark county, O.. some
year' ago to accept a position as a cap
tain of the Capitol ponce, died suddenly
today of heart disease. He had been
engaged for a number of days in fight
ing the efforts of a saloonkeeper named
John Urosnan to secure renewal of
his license for the coming year. There
is a recrulatiou of the District Commis
sioners that the applications for licenses
to sell liquor must be indorsed by at
least a majority ot the property owners
in the sanii square, uiacktora nau
been making a vigorous canvass, and
had succeeded in cettinir certain prop
erty owners to withdraw their indorse
ments irom rJrosmui s application.
Only one more man was needed by
Blackford, and that man had already
indorsed the application, but ulackrord
undertook to cet him to withdraw
his signature, and . at his request
the Commissioners gave him until ll
o'clock this morning to secure the with
drawal of the signature. Captain Black
ford hurried away from the Commis
sioners office and was just returning
after a successful mission when he
dropped dead near the district build
ings. At the hour determined, how
ever, the Commissioners ordered the
license to be issued, they not knowing,
as they claimed, that Blackford had the
desired affidavit in his pocket. Soon
after the Commissioners were informed
that the paper had been found in the
dead man's pocket, but the officials then
decided that it was too late, the license
having been issued. A few minutes
later tliree ladies who have interested
themselves in temperance work entered
the Commissioners .offices and tried to
have the license recalled, inasmuch as a
majority of the property owners in the
Square are known to be opposed to it, but
Commissioner Wheatly, the only one of
the trio on duty, determinedly said, .No.
The women burst into tears, and one of
them exclaimed, "The more I see of the
man, the more I like the dog." Captain
Blacktoru had taken an unusual inter
est in this particular case, and had re
marked that he would defeat Brosnan's
efforts to get a license if he had to die
for it, ana he aid uie in the cause, it
is said that another of the Commission
ers, who had heard of the facts, promis
ed tnat tne maiier snouia De reconsid
ered if the proper protests were riled
against the license. Captain Blackford
has alwavs been a temperance man, but
the fact that a son of his was killed in
a saloon row a year or two ago made
him particularly bitter upon the rum
sellers. Though he long lived in Wash
ington he still retained his legal resi
dence in Ohio. When the Democrats
obtained control of Congress ten years
ago Captain Blackford was turned out
of his place, after which he secured a
place in the Agricultural Department,
where he has been ever since. lie
served gallantly in the war and had his
left arm snot away in battle. He leaves
a widow and one daughter.
THE PRECARIOUS POTATO.
There seems to be no doubt that the
potato is precarious. The past few
years, it is claimed, the potato crop has
been steadily diminishing in 1S83 aver
aging ninety-one bushels to the acre;
in 1884 eighty-five bushels; in 18St
seventy-three and in 1887 flfty-tl ree
bushels.
J. It. Dodge, of the National Agricul
tural Bureau, having been called out
on the subject, wrote:
I do not say that "change in vanetv of
potatoes" will "prevent potatoes run
ning out." It is understood by cultiva
tors that any variety, productive and
popular, in course of time becomes
unproductive and" unpopular. Vide
the famous Neshamrock, Chenango,
and scores of later sorts. Even the
Early Rose is giving out, and at many
points being superseded. That is what
1 intended to be understood as saying.
The Maine Burbank, of great popular
ity, is succumbing to new varieties
deemed better.
As to fertilizers, good potatoes can
not be grown with a heavy application
of coarse fertilizers. The largest pro
ducts and the best quality are grown
upon oiu pastures or meaaows, arter
DreaKing ana rotting the soa.
Whatever tendencies may exist to
declining yield and quality is due to
their ground instead of new sod land.
As the country gets older this will
increase, unless care is taken to give
them sod land or new forest clearings,
which have abundance of potash.
Application of potash in suitable Quan
tities where needed will be profitable,
but general fertilizers indiscriminat
ingly, never.

says: "The best selling medicine I ever

COMMENTS OF THE PRESS.
What Some Papers of the Country
Say of the Message.
New York, Dec. 7. In commenting
on the President's message to Congress,
the Commercial Advertiser (Republi
can) says: "It is a plain, frank, definite
E reposition, and comes like a fresh
reeze in a Bultry day. It sweeps away
cant, lifts up a banner, and challenges
to combat. It will have a decisive
weight in the future of parties and of
legislation."
The Post (Independent) says: "The
message Is the most courageous docu
ment that has been sent from the exec
utive mansion since the close of the
war. It will compel public discussion
in Congress. It will supply parties
with an Issue that they have long need
ed. We have no doubt the President's
party will Bustain him.
The Evening Sun, Democrat, says:
"It does not often happen that a Pres
ident's message takes so little space to
say so much of consequence." The Sun,
however, does not commit itself to ap
proval or disapproval of the President's
recommendations, but simply states
what they are.
The Mall and Express, Republican,
says: "The President has framed the
issue for the next year's campaign. He
has taken a courageous stand, and we
sincerely trust his party will uphold
him. lie has put the Democrats fairly
on the free trade platform. The Re
publican party has nothing to complain
of. Neither workingmen no manufac
turers will be deceived bv glittering
generalities. The next campaign will
be a battle between protection and
free trade, with the chances largely in
favor of the Republicans."
The World. Democrat, says: "The
President has championed the cause of
the long overburdened taxpayers. And
he has supplied his party with what it
has long lacked an issue and a leader."
The Times, m its editorial on the
President's message, says: "Mr. Cleve
land has done an act of statesmanship
In the best sence. Recognizing a great
duty he has performed it with courage,
witn nrmness, ana at the right time.
And he has performed it so that every
honest man must see that it is an hon
est act."
The Herald says: "The messace is
an able, conservative, and statesman
like document, which, unlike many
other messages, will be read by the
people and discussed by them. We
are glad to see that he favors free wool,
which would give greatly increased ana
permanent prosperity to our great
wooien maustry and enable our manu
facturers in other branches at the same
time to dispose of large quantities of
their products in wool producing coun
tries to the immediate benefit of work
men in almost all branches of Ameri

will not Please extremists of either side.
free traders, or protectionists, but it
will, we believe, please and satisfy the
people at large, and it puts upon both
parties in Congress the solemn duty to
relieve the country from a most seri
ous danger."
