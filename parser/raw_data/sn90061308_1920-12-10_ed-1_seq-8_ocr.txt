PRESIDENT SENDS MESSAGE
TO CONGRESS
Urges Industrial Relief and Enact
ment of Workable Budget System.
Washington, Dec. 7.--Congre?.s was
in brief session today to hear Presi
dent Wilson's annual message. It was
read by the clerk, Mr. Wilson having
heeded' advice of his physician not to
appear in person. Galleries in both
houes were crowded, but those drawn
by the chance that the president might
appear in person or by the possibility
Jiis message might touch on the
league of nations question or his own
approaching retirement were disap
pointed. Mr. Wilson confined himself almost
whollv to domestic questions.
Aside from hearing the message
congress made definite progress
on at least one problem. The house
revived a rule under which an effort
will be made Thursday to take up the
immigration bill for prompt action.
It would limit general debate to four
hours. The two-day interval was al
lowed to permit Representative Sieged
of New York, member of the immi
gration committee, to frame a mi
nority report.
No other matter had passed to
day beyond the committee stage. At
both ends of the capitol, however,
members were deep in jdans to deal
with business depression, unemploy
ment and farmers' relief. Pircussion:'
in the senate of the plight of farmers
delayed reading of the president's
message.
The industrial situation also found
a place in the president's message.
Recovery from war effects ga-e
promise of early completion "only in
our own fortunate country," Mr. Wil
son said, and even here "halts and
is impeded at times." A program of
"immediately serviceable acts of legis
lation" to aid that recovery "and pro
vide the indestnictible recuperative
force of a great government of the
people," should 4e undertaken, Mr.
Wilson said.
First among rccommendecL steps
Mr. Wilson placed enactment of a
"workable budget system." He said
he had vetoed the budget bill passed
by the last session "reluctantly" and
because of, "a constitutional objec
tion." CONTEST CLOSED AT
METHODIST CHl KC r
The Ladies' T'.ible class of the
Methodist Episcopal Sunday school,
known as ihe "Home Builders" class,
have had a very enthusiastic contest
the past few weeks. It was a "rail
road race" between trains No. 1 ami
No. 2. Sunday morning train No. 2
reached the terminal just one point
ahead of train" No. 1, thus winning
the contest. The ladies on both trains
made schedule time nnti' engine No.
1 failed, for the lack of steam. There
were 150 women in the class Sunday
morning, 50 of them being new mem
bers. Both trains are to be commend
ed for their work and will "steam up."
The losing side will put on a play
"The Union Station" in the near
future, and every one is anxious to
see it.

LEAGUE DECIDES ON
SLOW POLICY
Withdrawal of Argentina is Received
With Apparent Indifference.
Geneva, Dec. 6. The league of
nations assembly today decided to
stick to a slow and sure policy in
amending the covenant and to ex-v
tend that policy to the interpretation
of the relations between the council
and the assembly with regard to their
respective duties and jurisdictions
under the covenant.
The Canadian amendment eliminat
ing article ten, and the Argentina a
mendment declaring that all sovereign
states shall be members of the league
that do not remain outside of their
own choice, were referred to a special
committee, which will study all the
proposed changes in the covenant and
report to the next assembly.
Relations Settled.
The question as to what are the
exact relations between the council
and the assembly was temporarily
and partially settled by the adoption
of a sort of working basis in the form
of the four general principles enunci
ated in the recent report of the co!t
mittpe presided over by Mr. Balfoar
with certain amendment'.
Tie first of these principles, which
set frth that the council and the as
sembly each should be invested with
particular powers and duties and that
neither should have jurisdiction to
render decision in any matter which
had been expressly committed to the
other, Lord Robert Cecil declared must
be amended so as to concede to the
assembly the right to examine any
question within the jurisdiction of the
league.
Amendment Accepted.
He contended that on the principle
as .:xpressed, the assembly would be
unable to treat with the important
questions, of disarmaments and man
dates, and added that his South Afri
can delegation would not accept the
report otherwise. His amendment
was accepted.
The committee also accepted the
proposition to eliminate the word
"exclusive" from the second prin
ciple, which declares that the' assem
bly has no power to reverse or modify
a decision which falls within the ex
clusive competence oil the council. On
the objection of the Canadians, how
ever, this principle was reserved.
The third and fourth principles,
setting forth the status of represen
atives sitting on the council and the
assembly, and making piovbuon for
a report from the council to the as
sembly, were adopted.
The Argentina incident, involving
the withdrawal of that delegation from i
the assembly, was disposed of quickly
the tiishenrbly showing indifference.
Instead of inviting the delegates back,
the assembly merely expressed regret
at their action through M. Hymans,
the chairman, and Lord Robert Cecil.
The only sign of feeling on the part
of members, 'Was that of approval
when Lord Robert said that no dele
gate 'body could get on with its busi
ness if the members were allowe to
leave whenever their particular propo
sitions were not accepted.

There was a dull constant ache
through my back and just over my
kidneys and "often sharp pains would
dart through my kidneys. I could
tell the trouble was caused from my
kidneys as they acted very irregularly.
I heard about Doan's Kidney Pills and
began to use them. They did me a
great deal of good, regulating my

PREVENTION OF DISEASE
A GOOD INVESTMENT
Columbia, Mo., Dec. 6. It is easy
to show that disease and death are
costly to the community, and that
all money spent in preventing sickness
is & good investment, says Dr. M. P.
Ravenel of the School of Medicine of
the University of Missouri, president
of the American Public Health Associ
ation. Let us take typhoid fever, for ex
ample. It attacks chiefly young ad
ults in the prime of life and useful
ness. Une case in every len resu'u
in death. Those who recover lose
from four to six weeks of time, and
often are not in fit condition for a
much longer period. The disease is
caused usually by water polluted with
human sewage, and is prevented by
proper disposal of sewage and the
use of good water.
In other words, typhoid fever is
always the result of violation of sim
ple and well-known precautions, for
which there is no good excuse at
present.
The individual who is stricken is
generally the innocent victim of offi
cial ignorance or carelessness, but it
is time for all citizens to know the
fundamental laws of sanitation and to
insist on official observation of them.
Pennsylvania has shown the worJd
what purification of water will do to
lessen typhoid fever. Severe epi
demics at Plymouth in 1885, Pitts
burgh and Alleghany in 1900, and
Butler in 1903 have taught the people
of Pennsylvania a hard lesson. About
100G the legislature passed a new
health law, and for the first time a
whole-time Commissioner of Health
was appointed ,with wide powers and
a liberal appropriation.
One of hi.s first acts was to im
prove the water supplies of the sta'-.o,
with the following results: 191fi,
number o" dor.tni from typhoid in the
state, 3,9 7, or 5!,.'': for each 100,000
of popula ion. 19M, number of deaths
1,075, or 13 for each 7 00,000. Number
of live; saved, 18jF(.'.". Number of
cases of tynhoid prevented,' 180,000.
Money saved t.t S50 pc case, $9,000,
000. '''! i : is on!? the money saved,
and docv. take into account the
happinc'ss added to hundreds of
homes. ' .
It has also been shown that wher
ever we avoided one case of tvphoid
by improvement of water, we also
avoided from two to three cases of
other diseases, so that the actual sav
ing is much greater than that shown
by th figures. However, these are
striking enough to prove that pure
water is a prime factor in producing
a healthy community and is worth
many tiijies the money cost. .
Many towns in Pennsylvania were
notorious for their high typhoid death
ate, and no real advance was made
until a State Health Commissioner
was appointed and a liberal amount of
money given to carry on his 'work. It
is useless to employ experts and then
sterilize their knowledge and efficiency
by lack of money.
Sewage disposal and purification
of water are ' largely engineering
problems. Our State Board of Health
will be handicapped until sufficient
money is given for the establishment
of a Division of Sanitary Engineering
and the employment of a high-class
engineer to conduct it. Money spent
in this way will be repaid many-fold,
not alone in saving of loss, but in
happiness and efficiency. The State
Board or Health should have liberal
appropriations for its work.
Mrs. Chas. Freer, of Sapulpa, Okla.,
who has been visiting her mother,
Mrs. Nelson, at Springfield, the past
several weeks, is visiting in Monett.

IN FILING RETURNS
Extensive plans for aiding .. tax
payers in filing their income tax re
turns for the year 1920 are being
made by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue. Revenue officers will visit
every county in the United States to
assist in making out the forms. The
date of their arrival and the location
of their offices will be announced
through the press, or may be obtained
on inquiry at offices of collectors of
internal revenue and brancft office?.
The services of government experts
heretofore offered to city residents
will be continued.
Forms for filing 1920 returns of in
come will be sent by collectors to per
sons who last year filed a return.
Failure to receive a form, however,
does not relieve a person from' his
obligation to file a return within the
time prescribed. Copies may be ob
tained from offices of collectors of
internal revenue, branch offices, post
offices and banks, and are expected
to be available on or before January
1st.
Revenue officers assigned to th.3
work of assisting taxpayer also wnl
be supplied with forms, concerning
which, and the various items of in-,
come to -be included, they will be pre
pared to answer any and all questions
It has been demonstrated, however,
that many questions may be eliminat
ed if the taxpayer, before seeking
the assistance of a revenue officer,
will carefully study the instructions
on the form.
The period for filing returns is from
January 1 to March 15, 1921. The
tax, tin's year as last, may be paid iti
full at the time of filing the retain cr
n four installments, the first of which
due on or before March 15, the
second on or before June 15, the third
on or before September 15 and tho
fourth on or before December 15. The
first installment must accompany the
filing of the return.
Persons whose individual net income
for 1920 was $5,000 and less should
ask for Form 1040A. Those whose
individual net income was in excess
of $5,000 should ask for Form 1040,
The Bureau of Internal Revenue is
urging taxpayers not to delay in the
filing of their returns. Merchants
and business men are casting up their
accounts for the calendar year 1920,
With. the facts and figures necessary
to make a correct return fresh in their
minds, the making out of a f orm soon
after January 1 will be an easier
task, the bureau points out, than if
delayed. -
The requirements of the revenue
act relating to returns for the year
1920 are the same as those for the
year 1919. Every single person whose
net income for 1920 was $1,000 or
more and every married person whose
net income was $2,000 or more must
file a return. The exemptions are
$1,000 for single persons and $2,000
for married persons and heads of
families, plus an additional exemption
of $200 for each person dependent
upon the taxpayer for chief support
if such person is under eighteen years
of age or incapable of self support,
A single person may claim an exemp
tion of $2,000 as the head of a family
if he is the sole support of one or
more relatives living in the same
house witji him, rr i ic exercises
control over hou.-?h-. i stViirs. .De
ductions from gross dncuuf! to which
the taxpayer is entitled in arriving at
net income are fully explained in the
instructions on the forms.
