Ship Subsidy. (
The wisdom of a direct ship subsidy j
as a means of building up our marl-i
time Interests has not sufficiently com
mended itself to all classes In this coun
try to warrant favorable action soon.
Apparent as seems the need for ships
to carry our own commerce, there Is
still a very deeply-Intrenched feeling
that ship subsidies are discriminatory
In character and not essential to a
merchant marine such as this govern
ment should possess. The New York
Journal of Commerce, itself, is not
only against ship subsidy, but takes
the radical position that the best Inter
ests of the United States do not even
demand a national merchant marine,
and, going further, it declares that it
is not essential that this country look
to the building up of foreign trade
with, for instance, South America, or
with any country, for that matter, half
as much as it should look to the de
velopment of interests at home.
Denying the assertion of our min
ister to Argentina tbat American
merchant marine and banks abroad
would promote American trade in for
eign lands, the Journal says:
We possess a broad section of the most
favored continent on earth, prolific of r?
aourcea and opportunities, only partly de
veloped. It las required and eilll requires
moat of our energy and capital to keep up
the process of development to meet the
wants of an Increasing population, and
even If the process must be slower the
gain from It, Is greater than can be had
from exploiting distant oountrlea or sup
plying the means ot exploiting them, and
that fact would keep the money and cap
ital working mostly at home.
We doubt if this sentiment Is quite
representative over the country and
yet it comes from a source that de
mands a serious hearing. It goes to
show how far from coherent is our
national mind on this important sub
ject. It does not seem to us that
either establishing banks or branches
abroad or building up a strong
merchant marine is necessarily ex
ploiting "a distant country or supply
ing the means of exploiting it." If an
Inferior nation can maintain a mer
chant marine that can carry our
freight at very low rates and make a
profit, why is it that this nation, with
its wonderful resources, cannot main
tain ships under the American flag ca
pable of carrying its own commerce
and of building up foreign trade,
which, of course, the foreign ship does
not do for us?
- President Taft In his message to con
gress directs attention to this need,
reminding congress that unless some
action is soon taken the completion of
the Panama canal will find this the
only great' nation without a commer
cial fleet of its own. Of course, one
objection persistently made to the di
rect subsidy is that it is no more fair
or necessary to this private Industry
than any other. Another objection is
that the subsidy would' very likely fall
into the bands of rich and powerful
ship owners, who ought, without any
such artificial stimulus, establish and
maintain this trade. We believe it is
possible to carry on a successful mari
time trade without large financial help
from the government.
Bath Tub Trust.
If one-half of what the government
charges agalns the so-called bath tub
trust is true, it is one of the most
merciless and far-reaching combines
yet discovered. The nature of such a
conspiracy Is both general and specific,
touching the people of every class. The
lamentable, fact Is that such somehow
seems to be the case with every trust.
It is apparently easier to form uii
blnatlona about articles of necessity
than any other kind. This is obvious,
of course, for if articles were not of
' ... . ...
scarcely be worth the while of the large
aggregations of wealth that grow pow
erful by cornering markets.
The government appears to have
constructed a firm basis for its case.
It presents evidence that Is national in
its scope and, if reliable, so pertinent
to the Issue that one looking on from
the outside would at once conclude
tnat a conviction were not by any
means impossible. The government
has in its principal witness one of the
Inside factors in this combine, whose
testimony will prove the more valu
able because he is a reluctant witness.
To hlra, it is understood, immunity
has been promised. If his testimony
is as strong as it looks to be, such a
promise may well be made. His con
viction, since he is not one of the re
sponsible heads of the trust, would
not satisfy the ends of Justice, any
way. It does seem that the govern-
mufit KhnitM ha aMa In thla naoa tn

montana uoin? to Extremes. i
Montana is one of the western
states that was caught up In the vor
tex of tha late political reform hya-
terla. Whereas, in former days things
were as free and easy in tbat state
as they had ever been anywhere in this
country, since this stotm broke they
have been about as tight as in any
other state. The auti-paas reform, one
of the best in itself that we have in
herited from this genual movement,
it so rigid in Montana that not even '
railroad nieu may rlJe without paying
cash fares on the lines that employ
them.
Uut now come the democrats of
Montana, who have captured the legls-
lature, with the proposal to elect
former Senator V. A. Clark to the
I ntiei aiates senate. it mey carry
out this plan one will hsve a right to
question that party's eiuterity la any
of the reforms, for Senator Clark la
one of the most conspicuous ultra-reactionaries
ever In political life. He
(was the direct descendant, the type
and the mould, all in one, of this
former era of the "open door" In poli
tics. And this period came to its cli
max in his state when he was elected
to the senate after that memorable
contest with his old-time rival, Mar
cua Daly. Everything calculated to
make the wheels of a political machine
run with faultless precision and alac-
! rlty was turned loose in Montana in
those days with prodigality unbounded.
In addition to the Clark school of
politic Is the fact that he became
noted as an absentee member of the
senate during his former term, Just
as he is now and for years has been
noted as an absentee citizen of Mon
tana. He really resides in New York
and it would be a travesty to send him
to the senate from Montana. It is
such as this that forces the conviction
that the recent democratic victory was
a powerful triumph of bourbon poli
ticians. George B. Tzschuck.
The passing away of a good man is
always a matter for regret.
specially is this true in the case
of George B. Tzschuck. Mr. Tzschuck
was long identified with the growing
interests of Omaha in an unobtrusive
but effective way. As treasurer of
The Bee Publishing company for more
than thirty years he rendered a service
to this paper, and through it to the
public, that is beyond computation.
He had many interests outside of the
publishing office In which he spent the
greater part of his life and his busi
ness and social relations were such as
testify eloquently to the high charac
ter of the man. Universally esteemed
and well beloved by his associates,
this quiet man will be missed far more
than one of greater show and less in
fluence. His life was a fine example
of effective industry and accomplish
ment and his death fs not only a cause
for sorrow to those who enjoyed his
friendship, but a loss to the comma
nlty, which Is always a loser when a
good man goes on ahead.
Effects of Insurgency.
"Judge Norrla again raises ti-e banner of
'insurgency' and propoaea to rip things up
as soon as congress convenes Such a pol
Icy ought to be of great help to the dem
ocrats. It will prevent the enactment of
any serious constructive legislation by the
republican party and leave all matters of
Importance, except the appropriation billa,
over to the body that will b directed by
Champ Clark and his cohorts. Such a com
mission is the logical end of Insurgency. -Omaha
Bee."
Has The Bee read the election returns to
so little effect? An election has Just been
held which the republican party lost in
standpat territory and won where Insur
gency had thrown off standpat chains. In
Nebraska a republican for the aenate and
at least one republican for the house were
defeated because; they were not Insurgent
enough to suit the people- Meanwhile Con
gressman Norrla was multiplying his old
majority NO times. The democratic gains
would obviously not have occurred had. In
suiKency been In complete control of the
republican party. How Insurgency Is i
"creat help to the democrats" Is not man
Ifest In the election returns. On what con
trary evidence The B oan make deino
era Ho succeca "the logical end of lnsur
gency" we cannot Imagine. Of one thing
we can be sure. The Bee can "be of great
help to tho democrats" In Nebraska by
continuing Its fling at progressiva repub
licans. Lincoln Journal.
Exactly so. Whenever a republican
candidate failed to "inaunge" with
sufficient vehemence to meet the ap
probation of the so-called Nebraska
' insurgents they voted for a democrat
It is unfortunate that these alleged
i republicans for a long time have pre
ferred an out-and-out democrat to an
out-and-out republican. If proof of
this were necessary it is only required
to turn to the official vote of Lancas
ter county, which gave an average
plurality of above 2.000 for repub
lican candidates on the state ticket,
and then turned around and gave a
majority of more than 600 for the
democratic candidate for congress, de
feating the republican candidate by
300. In other words, 2,600 Lancaster
county republicans voted for the dem
ocratic candidate for congress in the
First district because the republican
candidate was an openly avowed re
publican and not a so-called insurgent.
The Nebraska Postmasters' associa
tion seems to have become an organ
ization for the perpetuation of incum
bents In office. This takes the matter
entirely out of the hands of the presi
dent, the senators, the postmaster
general, the Civil Service commission
and all other agencies, but it remains
to be determined whether the organ-

justed before being admitted. The

That the revenue Of Nebraska rail-
roads has Increased almost four and

AREA Al rOPL'lLATIO!.
Plentr ol Room on Earth for Millions
Yet to rone.
Washington Poet.
The I'nlted States ha at the present time
some 64,000.000 InKBltnjits. In view of which
the recurring question of how they are an
to be fed and clothed, comes up for consid
eration. Are there enongh broad acres to
support them? And how long will It be
before the Increase each decade, which has
jumped from a relatively scant 3,0n0,000, be
tween 1M0 and 1830, to 11,000,000 between 1900
and 1910, will scarcely leave standing room?
There are serious questions, but, happily,
the etatlatldans fhrnlsh still larger figures
of land area, that are calculated to allay
alarm. While tha population has Increased
ninefold since 1820. the area of tha country
haa become four times greater since 1800;
and Ss all of the acquired territory was
practically a wilderness when obtained. It
afforded an open field for settlement.
Of the main habitable divisions of the
world, Africa Is the moat thinly settled,
with an average of eleven Inhabitants to
the square mile. Those who have read Da
Qulncey's opium ridden visions of the over-
populated ee.Pt have been oppressed with a
sense cut the teeming millions there. Yet
Asia, with her KAOOQ.000 souls, has land!
enough to give a square mile to every sixty
Inhabitants, while ICurope, with her present
population, must place 110 within the same
limit. This country can still distribute
thirty-one of Its cttlsens to each square
mile of territory, In order to provide for
all, which la just about half the proverbial
forty acres, without the mule. And as for
standing room, the human race could
gather together within an area far more re
atricted than might at first seem possible.
The entire population of this country could
be placed within the District of Columbia,
and then have more than elbow room; In
fact, each citlsen, large and small, would
occupy tha centor of a square five feet on
a ride.
It is probable, then, that the human race
will have plenty of good aoyd earth for a
long time to come, and that we need have
no fears for ourselves nor for the millions
yet unborn.

'Mark Twiiin lobbied In the halls of

thors as far back as ls." said Victor
Rnsewater. editor and publisher of the
Omaha Bee, quoted by the Washington
Tost.
"When I read the other day of the trib
utes paid the great wit by the wealth and
Intellect of the country In New York, It
recalled to my mind the time when, as a
page, at the card door of the t'nlted
States senute, I tarried messiiges to and
from senators for Mr. Clemens, who was
In Washington In the Interest of certain
copyright privileges. These pilvlleges he
asked, not through any selfish motive, hut
to rectify any unjuat attitude which (he
lawa at that time assumed toward au
thors and publishers In general.
"And as lie accomplished good In his last
lobbying expedition, for which he has been

Well do I remember Mm. seated In the

"Back into the senate chamber he would

another to come to the marble room and
see him. Not once do I remember bring

"I remember going to him with my book
while he was sitting t a table In the
marble room after a chat with a aenator
whom he had evidently swayed toward his
pet plan of copyright law. Genially char
acteristic of the man, he Inscribed his
name, 'Samuel 1.. Clemens,' diagonally
across the page and eyed me humorously,
lie must have noticed the disappointed ex

" 'What's the matter, son?' he remarked.
'I'd like you to sign the name by which
you are uauully tailed,' I replied. With that

scribed diagonally the other way, making
a cross of the two names, 'Mark Twain."
I treasure that autograph."
Very serious conequenses for Chairman
Knapp of the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion may follow his recent speech at the
banquet of the railroad supply men in
New York, In which he Indicated pretty
clearly his sympathy with the demand for
increased freight rates, and this at a time
when the question was under Investigation
by the body over which Mr. Knapp pre
sides. A Washington correspondent of the
Philadelphia Record states that "tha feel
ing Is so strong among other members of
the commission over the chairman's Indis
cretion that Commissioner Clements took
occasion a few days later to declare In
publlo speech that the utterances of Mr.
Knapp d'.d not repreaent the aentlments of
I Is colleagues.
"Still later, speaking from the bench ot
the commlslon, Commissioner Iane made
a similar statement. Attorneys for the as
socintlons of shippers who are fighting
the proposed increase In freight rates be
fore the commission, whose hearings on the
question ended yesterday, have also taken
the matter up and the belief la strong that
before the incident is closed it will be
made so embarrassing for Chairman
Knapp that he will be compelled to resign
hia position. There are rumors that Presi
dent Taft himself has been greatly an
noyed by the extraordinary Course of the
communion's chairman in publicly declar
Ing his bias In a case on trial before him.
The president regarda. the Interstate Com
irerce commission as at leaf t a quaal-Judl-clal
body and Is said to hold that the chair
man was guilty ot almost as great an
Impropriety as would be a Judge who
should announce his conclusions in a case
that was on trial before him.
"At leaat three of Chairman Knapp's col
leagues on the commission are reported to
hold tbat the chairman owes it to himself,
to tha commission and to the publlo to re
frain from taking part in the conferences
of the body and from voting when It pro
ceeds to make up its decision on the Jus
tice of the proposed Inoreaae In rates. This
feeling will be made known to the chair
man In due time, If It has not already been
done.
"The attorneys for the shippers, aided by
Mr. Brandeia, will ventilate the whole sub
ject In a way that will be decidedly em
barrassing to Chairman Knapp, when they
make their final arguments In the case
early in Januuary. They will Insist that
the speech of the chairman before the
railroad supply dealers' association be
spread on the records of the commission,
accompanied by evidence he admits he
had before him on the subject when he
made the speech. This evidence, the chair
man acknowledgea, was not laid before hia
colleagues."

later, Aaher Hinds, who was destined to
pilot the congressional ship for three skip
pers. Heed, Henderson and Cannon. And,
aa it by agreement, each of these appren
tices was to have a turn at wearing hia
master's shoes.
Allen became Heed a direct successor in
the only original Heed district, and now
he retires In favor of Hinds.
No one will dispute that Asher Hinds
la the greatest living authority on parlia
mentary procedure In congress, and thin
knowledge will enable him to become a
great power the moirarnt he takes his aeai
in tha house. In tha forthcoming bitter
debateM. during which the minority party,
under Cannon's leadership, will do Its ut

No Man is Stronger
Than His Stomach
A atrong nao is strong all over. No man oan be
strong who is suffering from weabTttooiaoh with its
consequent indigestion, or from some other disease
of the stomach and its associated organs, which im
pairs digestion and nutrition. Far when the stomach
is weak or diseased there is a loss of the nutrition
contained in food, whioh is the souree of all physical
Strength. When a nan " doesn't feel just right,"
when he doesn't sleep well, has an uncomfortable
feeling in the stomaoh after eating, is languid, nervous, irritable and despond
ent, he is losing the nutrition needed to make strength.

THE WINDOW WISHXRS.
Detroit Free PYr-w.
The little window withers, with their ten
der eyes of blue,
Standing there befoni the toy shops, don't
they touch the heatl of you?
Don't you almot t shiver with dlicm as their
tattered clothes you S"C.
The ragged little urchins, vyilh he Patches
on each knee?
Can you nee them longlns. yearning In
sweet childhood's wistful way
And forget them in your planning for a
merry Cohrlstmas Day?
Oh. the little window wishers, baby hearts
and baby eyes, .
With their trusting faith in Santa gazing
there In glad surprise.
At the dollies and the soldiers and the
Teddy Hears, believing
That they will not be foi gotten. Can you
t-ee them without grieving?
Can you thlna of them on Christmas when
the merry morning starts
Disillusioned, wnklng up to empty stock
ingsbroken hearts?
Oh, the little window wishers, looking
Innfrlnglv today
At the wonders In the toy shops In sweet
chlldhood'H wistful way,
Dreaming dreams of Christmas stockings
filled with candles and with toys;
Just as full of faith and fancy aa your own
girls and your boys.
When you see their blR eyes glisten as
these splendid thins thoy view.
Can you rush by and forget them, don't
they touch the heart ot you?
Louis
