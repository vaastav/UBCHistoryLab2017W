WASHINGTON, Pec. 6.?"World ;
hope is centered" on the Conference j
for the Limitation of Armament, |
President Harding' declared to-day \
in closing: his first address to a regu- !
lar session of Congress, delivered in ?
person in the House of Representa- i
rives Hail "A most gratifying!
world accomplishment is not im-:
probable,"' he said. "Our country ?
is not only free from every impend- ,
\r.g menace of war, but there are !
growing assurances of the pernia- ?
nsncy of peace.''
The President gave most of his
attention to domestic questions, go
i.g through a long series of sub?
jects which he wished to bring to
?ho attention of Congress. The ses?
i?n just ended was an extra session,
ailed for three distinct purposes,
re^bion of the taxes, revision of the |
tariff ar.d the passage of a resolution \
?ttlarjng peace with the Central |
Fewer.-. The message to-day, there
:\v\ ?a President Harding's first
".?'?! ??''tailed rnessSge.
Views oil Labor
TV.e big surprise in his message
was with regard to labor.* Without
going into details, he outlined a
plan for the regulation of labor
vhich he compared to that now ex- j
ercised by the government for the j
regulation of corporations, and for '
precisely the same purpose?the ?
protection of the general public. }'
"Just as it is not desirabie that a :
corporation shall be allowed to impose f
'?indue exactions upon the public," he j
declared, "so it is not desirable that (
a labor organisation shall be permitted j
to exact unfair terms of employment j
<>r subject the public to actual dis?
tresses in order to enforce its terms.'*
The President left no doubt in the ?
? undo of his audience that he was j
rttong for compulsory arbitration,
?long much tho same lines as the ?
Kansas Industrial Court made famous :
by Governor Henry J. Allen.
"Boycott Out of Place"
Certainly the labor leaders got this i
view, and Sarouel Gompers, president
of the American Federation of Labor,
?Bsued a vigorous statement to-night
riticizing *l>e President's ideas with ;
regard to labor regulation, and saying ,
'hat it carried the history of the labor ;
movement back 400 years.
"In an industrial society euch as
oars the strike, the lock-out and the j
?boycott arc as much out of place and
??a disastrous in their results as ir war
[or armed revolution in the domain of
'Politics," the President declared, urg- ;
mg the adoption of a "thoroughgoing
code of practice" and the setting up
*f "judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals
?or the consideration and determina
'ion of ail disputes which menace the
Public welfare."
Holding that necessity demanded the '
"?Verridirig of difficulties in tariff legis-1
?ation, the President suggested a scale j
wore flexible and elastic than ordinary
?> order that "rates may be adjusted to j
?cet the unusual and changing condi
BO&s which cannot be accurately antic- ;
ipated."
I In order to meet certain "problema ,
incident to unfair practices and to ex
Changes, which madness in money has
i,lftd? almost insolvable," the President
?commended the extension of the pow
?H? of the Tariff Commission "so that
?* can adapt itself to a scientific and
1 Ti?y Just administration of the law."
the President pressed strongly, also,
"t peedy action by Congress to per?
mit the refunding of foreign debts to
jw United States, pointing out that

Chief Recommendations in President
Harding9s Message to 67th Congress
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6".?Among the many striking utterances
?mads by President Harding in his message to Congress to-day, the fol?
lowing >nay be eited as of unusual interest and importance:
"It is not my purpose to bring to you a program of world res
tovation. In the main, such a program must be worked out by the
nations more directly concerned. They must themselves turn to
the heroic remedies l'or the menacing conditions under which they
are struggling, then we can help, and we mean to help."
"It will be helpful to ourselves and will improve conditions
among our debtors if funding and the settlement of defaulted in?
terest may he negotiated."
"There is before you the completion of the enactment of what
has been termed a 'permanent' tariff law, the word 'permanent'
being used to distinguish it from the emergency act which the
Congress expedited early in the extraordinary session and which
is the law to-day. I cannot too strongly urge an early completion of
this necessary legislation. ... I hope a way will be found to
make for flexibility and elasticity, so that rates may be adjusted
to meet unusual and changing conditions which cannot be accu?
rately anticipated."
"In the case of labor organizations we might well apply
. . . well defined principles of regulation and supervision in
order to conserve the public's interest as affected by their opera?
tions.
"As wc have great bodies of law carefully regulating the or?
ganization and operations of industrial and financial corporations,
as we have treaties and compacts among nations which look to the
settlement of differences without the necessity of conflict in arms,
so we might well have plans of conference of common counsel, of
mediation, arbitration and judicial determination in controversies
between labor and capital."
"I think our tax problems, the tendency of wealth to seek non
taxable investment, and the menacing increase of public debt,
Federal, state and municipal, all justify a proposal to change the
Constitution so as to end the issue of non-taxable bonds."

ment; King New Leader
Seven Lose Cabinet Seals
Conservatives Overwhelmed
by Advocates of Lower
Tariff for the Dominion
OTTAWA, Dec. 6.?Returns received
to-night from to-day's general election
indicated the defeat of the Meighen
government and a landslide for *.he
Liberals, led by W. L. Mackenzie King.
Seven members of the Cabinet were de?
feated.
Premier Meighen was beaten in his
homo constituency, Portage La Prairie,
Man. His opponent was Harry Leader,
Progressive.
The chief plank in the Liberal plat?
form is tariff reduction. The Meighen
government stood for high protection.
At 11 o'clock to-night Senator Rob?
ertson, Minister of Labor, conceded the
defeat of the government.
Mr. King, Liberal leader, was elected
in North York, Ont., a division nor?
mally Conservative, by 1,000 majority.
T. A. Crerar, leader of the Progressive
party, was elected in Marquette, Man.
In the eastern part of the dominion
the Liberals made a clean sweep,
Quebec, with sixty-five members in
Parliament, will be represented entirely
by Liberals. Five of the seven defeated
Cabinet members were candidates in
Quebec constituencies.
Nova Scotia, with sixteen seats, gave,
them all to Liberals, two members of
the government going down to defeat
in that province. Liberals were re?
ported elected in three out of four
Prince Edward Island divisions and in
six of the eleven constituencies in New
Brunswick.
In Ontario, the most populous of all
the provinces and long regarded as
safe for the government, the Meighen
party retained only thirty-eight of the
sixty-two seats it held there.
Sufficient information was at hand
to-night to show that Mr. King, Lib?
eral chieftain, would have the largest
group in the next Parliament, and prob?
ably a clear majority over all parties.
He will thus be called upon by the
Governor General to form a govern?
ment.
The only numbers of the Meighen
Cabinet who survive the light are B.
M. Baxter, Minister of Customs, elect?
ed in St, John, N, P.; Sir Henry Dray

It was revealed also that the B. R.

? Clarence J. Shenrn, special counsel of
the commission, the financial methods
of the B. R. T. wero not as much open

B. R. T. Operations Bared
The disclosures regarding the B. R. i

placed in evidence a report of tht B.

showing a surplus of $12,812,000. The
witness admitted that the amount of
the surplus would depend upon the |
validity and correctness of the entry in |
the asset side of the balance sheet of I
$138,GlU,68e, representing the cost of!
the properties owned by the B. R. T., ;

Mr. Abel defined the surplus as a I

-
What were termed the "arrogant and
| tyrannical methods" of certain labor
i unions in the building industry were
uncovered at yesterday's session of the
i Lockwood legislative committee on
housing in tho City Hall. The dis
; closures were brought about in the
i course of the efforts of Samuel Unter
| myer, chief counsel to the committee,
j to get at tho cause of the alleged iri
| efficiency of labor generally at the
? present time, said to bo one of the
basic reasons for the high cost of con?
struction.
It appeared from the testimony that
j certain unions, notably those of plas
! terers and others, reserved tho right to
?censor and criticize artistic cmbellish
| ments ordered in structures by archi
I tects, and even to demand their dc
i etruction if they did not meet tho ap?
proval of the workers.
Banned Imitation Marble
Instance after instance was cited to
the committee wherein elaborate mold?
ings and sculptural wonts executed by
outside artisans for the decoration of
interiors of hotels and private places
were ordered removed or destroyed by
plasterers, who, demanded the rigltfc to
execute and put up the work in their
own way on the job. In one instance
the plasterers refused to permit the
use of imitation marble in a foyer hall
of a residence along Park Avenue, al?
though the architect had specified it
and 60 per cent of the ejection had
been completed.
The union men asserted that "the
imitation marble didn't look good" and
ordered the material removed under
threat of a strike. The architect had
to bow before the "artistic tastes" of
the plasterers. It was developed that
the unionists took this stand to make
more work for their members.
Among other abu?es of the labor
unions recorded in yesterday's testi?
mony was the alleged general practice
of keeping down the membership in
labor organizations and so bringing
about a shortage of labor. This re?
sulted in a demand for workers, it was
said, and a consequent increase in
wages. Under these conditions an of?
ficer of the Building Trades Employers'
Association said that premiums were
being paid to various kinds of work?
ers, carpenters, whose wages were nor?
mally $9 a day, getting premiums up
to $12, while plasterers, whose wages
arc $10 a day, get as high as $16 in
premiums.
Union Stationary for Ten Years
The Hoisting Engineers' Association
was pointed to as one of the worst
offenders in. this direction, Joseph E.
Donohuc, business agent of the or?
ganization, admitting that its member?
ship had remained practically station?
ary at about 360 members for the last
ten years, and that "the idea" was to
keep the membership down as the
building requirements increased.
Mr. Untcrmyer delved deeper into the
finances of the International Brother?
hood of Electrical Workers' Local No.
3, of which William A. Hogan, the
financial secretary, is the guiding
spirit. It was shown that other unions
besides the electrical group, such as
the Tile Setters' Helpers organization,
also kept its membership down and re?
quired non-members to obtain permit
cards at $2 a week, granting them the
privilege of working in the city.
Four officials of the electrical work
era' brotherhood refused to sign
waivers of immunity ?-hen called to
the witness stand, and all but one of
them?Joseph Lawlcr, the treasurer ?
were excused. William J. Walsn, the

By Thomas Steep
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. ? Critical
! stages were reached to-day in China's
j demand on Japan for the unconditional
j surrender of Shantung. Three advisers
to the Chinese delegation cabled their
j resignations to Peking. They declared
their belief that China would "get
nothing" from tho conference. The
Chinese delegate;;, after consulting
with tho Peking government, decided i
to "stick to the ship," but indicated
they would end the Shantung negotia?
tions precipitately if Japan insisted on
retaining 50 per cent of control in thc
Shantung Railway. From the Ameri?
can delegation emanated a friendly
warning that China's chances would be
jeopardized if resignations become the
order of tho day. The American dele?
gation made it clear that China's in?
terests were- being properly safe
! guarded.
Neither Dr. Wellington Koo nor hia
colleagues would sanction the com?
plaints recorded by their aids who re?
signed. They attributed differences of
opinion to China's opening direct r.ego
tiatloncs with Japan on the Shantung
controversy, but explained that the
negotiations are being attended by
both British and American "observera,"
nnd therefore are in no way secret. So
far, it was pointed out, China in these
negotiations had gained every point
she had demanded,' although the ques?
tion of the control of the railway,
which, the Chinese say, carries with it
political control of the whole province,
is yet to be decided, !
Chinese Firm on Railway ;
When it comes to the railway tlic
Chinese delegation, it is learned, is j
prepared to disagree unless Japan back3
down entirely from nor stand for a
joint control. Mansanao Hanihara,
Japanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Af?
fairs, to-night reiterated Japan's posi?
tion that she wanted to control the
railroad to prevent it from "failing to
function." '
The Chinese advisers who resigned
were General Huang Fu, chief mili?
tary adviser; Chow Tsi-Chi, chief
financial adviser and former] ? Chinese
Minister of Finance, and Admiral Tsi
Ting-Kan, chief naval adviser and as?
sistant director of Chinese customs,
'incir resignations followed that of P. j
K. C. Tyau, the Chinese delegation's
general secretary, who quit yesterday
after voicing his opinion that China "is
getting nothing but empty promises."
Specific complaints tiled by those who
resigned to-day were:
That China had been checkmated in
pressing for each of her ten demands
for administrative autonomy and ter?
ritorial integrity.
That the removal of foreign post
office?, having been agreed upon "in
principle" by all the powers, was de?
ferred at the suggestion of Japan until
a definite date for the removal might
I be agreed upon.
Action Delayed a Year
That the abolition of the system of
extraterritorial privileges to foreign
powers had been referred to an inter?
national commission which has not yet
j been appointed, which will not have to
j report until a year after its appoint?
ment, and'whose final report may be
! accepted or rejected at the option of
) any or all the powers.

BriancTs General Policy Upheld
By Both Senate and Chamber
Special Cable to The Tribuno
Copyright, 1921, N?w York Tribuno Inc.
PARIS, Dec. 6.~-Both the Senate and
the Chamber of Deputies backed up
Premier Briand to-day, when, under
fire of a hundred interpellations re?
garding his trip to the Washington
arms conference, he demanded -hat
discussion of that subject be post?
poned until after the budget bill had
been passed. The Premier insisted that
it would be tactless to debate the arma?
ment limitation conference while it
was stiil in session, and this was con?
ceded. It will be debated later.
Both bodies also gave the Premier
a vote of confidence on his genera! pol
| icies, after he had promised an early
discussion of France's part in the
l Washington gathering. These votes,
i asfcuring Briand's retention of office
i at least until after the Christmas holi
j davs. did away with the reports cir?
culated in the Chamber that former
President Poincar? was being groomed
to succeed Briand as Premier, but
these were promptly revived when the
Premier and the Senator left the Sen?
ate arm in arm after the session there.
Briand replied briefly to one or two
questions. Answering Senator Bran- ;
gier's charge that the Premier was re- j
sponsiblo for letting Germany bide j
her capital in foreign countries, the |
Premier said:
"How can I oblige Stinnes when he |
makes a salo in Sweden or Norway to
bring the money back to Germany?
When I'm held for such affairs I turn
to the reparations commission. Cer?
tainly the German state is impov?
erished, but the country is not. If
Germany does not pay it will not be
failure, it will be fraudulent bank?
ruptcy."
The Senate's vote of confidence, 249
to 12, approved "the declaration of the
Premier and his actions in Washing?
ton" and expressed confidence that the
government would bring about full ac?
cord among the Allies and the collec?
tion of credits duo from Germany.
Senator de la Haye started a com?
motion when he charged that Briand
had humiliated the country by asking
permission of the powers assembled
in Washington to maintain an army.
This was France's sovereign right, the
Senator continued.
The vote of confidence ;,n the Cham?
ber stood, 400 to 100.

Lloyd George to Ask for
Ratification Dec. 14 ; Jo*!

LONDON, Dec. 6.~-The peace that
ends sb: centuries of war, drawn and
signed in a historic Whitehall room
this morning between Ireland and
Great Britain, gives to that island *>
new place in the British Empire, the
status of a dominion, but the tit!?
of "The Iri?h Free State."
On a par in every way with tb*
other self-governing commonwealths
?Canada, New Zealand, Australia,
South Africa?Ireland to-day is ft
new link in the imperial organiza?
tion, under the terms of a peace com?
promise that a little gray-haired
Welshman wrested from defeat and
that again wrote the name of David
Lloyd George into history as one of
the greatest of England's long lin?
of premiers.
Terms of Peace
Great Britain and Ireland have
i made peace on these terms:
The Irish Free State shall hav?
its own Parliament, a Prime Min?
ister responsible to that body and
a Governor General appointed by
the British crown. '
The members of that Parliament
shall take an oath of allegiance to
the constitution of the Irish F re?
State and swear to "bo faithful to
His Majesty King George V and
his heirs and successors by law."
The people of Ulster shall choos*
within one month whether to tak?
part in the Parliament of the Irish
Free State. If they elect not to
participate, the prerogatives and
powers now held by the Orang?
government and Parliament shall
be retained by them and protected
by the British crown. If Ulster
decides to join, a rectification of
frontiers is to be undertaken.
The Irish Free Stale assumes a
share of the Britisli national debt'
and war expenditure, the amount
to b? determined by negotiation
on the basis of relative popula?
tion.
The parliament of the Irish
Free State shall have complet?
control of Irish tariffs, f.nancial
affairs and ports.
British military forces shall be
withdrawn from Ireland.
Lloyd G?or?.c went to bed last nicht
the happiest man in England. The?
Wellington of politics had crowned his
career with a victory that has been the
despair of British statesmen through
? he ages, and it was noon to-day before
he appeared, wreathed in smiles, at his
office at 10 Downing Street. After
brief further discussion of details with
some of his advisers and two members
of the Sinn Fein delegation he an?
nounced to-rright that he would go into
Parliament 0:1 December 14, in special
session, to win tho nation's indorse?
ment of thc treaty of peace with Ire?
land.
Before Three Parliament?
The pact, containing eighteen arti?
cles, must be approved by three Par?
liaments?those sitting in London, Bel?
fast and Dublin. If the London body
rejects it, which is extremely improb?
able, Lloyd George will carry hie p'.ea
to the polls. The Dail Direann in Dub?
lin is expected to ratify, because the
chief Sinn Fein peints have been con
1 ceded. If the Belfast Pkt:'.amcrnt vote*
I to join the Irish Free State, adminis?
tration of the island will be simplified,
! but thc rejection of thc pact by the
j north will not prevent its coming into
I force for the rest of Ireland.
The Tribune's correspondent in Dub
? lin say? that sentiment among Sinn
Fe'.n lenders there makes it evident
I that the treaty will be ratified by thc
, Dail Eireann next week without delay.
I He [('da that ihf> terms are approved
j '??.? fn overwhelming majority in na?
tionalist Ireland, and have caused gen
eral rejo? em t, am un g un except the ex?
treme republican?.
King George, the center of the storm
j raised by the Sinn Fein opposition tc
j taking a direct oath of allegiance, whe
three times threw himself into the
peace negotiations, is jjiven th? most
credit, next to Lloyd George, for th<
conclusion of the negotiation?.
King Is Overjoyed
To-day he was first to congratul?t?
?he Premier. He wrote:
"I am overjoyed to hear the fplaa
did news you hav? just *ent me. I
congratulate you pith all my heart
