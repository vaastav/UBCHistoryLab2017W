ROOSEVELT, THE IMPETUOUS SIMPLIFIER
IT is difficult to take President Roosevelt seriously while we watch
his extravagant excursions in the way of autocracy, his impa
tience of constitutional restraints and his positive incapacity to
see more than one side of a case. We give him full credit for
the best intentions and high patriotic purpose, but the fact is that
he reasons with his emotions. The country, indeed, has held him
in affectionate regard as a favorite spoiled child.
But there are limits. When the President proposes to usurp
judicial functions and invade State rights he will quickly, discover
that he is butting his head against a stone wall. He has already
made that discovery in the fate of his ridiculous order that the spell
ing of the English language should be reformed on his ipse dixit. In
that matter he simply intruded himself with ill-considered impulse
on a domain when he had neither jurisdiction, power nor authority.
He meant well, but he did not understand. He has discovered one
thing that a President cannot do. Shortly he will find that there
are many other things in the same category. As Justice Brown of
Pennsylvania told Secretary Root, the judiciary stands in the way to
restrain the eccentric impulses of a hotspur executive.
The fact is that Mr. Roosevelt has not taken the slightest trouble
to think out the course that he recommends. His condition of men
tal confusion is exhibited in the astonishing recommendation of his
message concerning the Japanese in San Francisco, where he asks
Congress to amend the statutes "to enable the President * * *
to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties." In a word; he asks
that the powers of the courts shall be taken away and given to the
executive. The recommendation is so absurd that it makes a fit
climax to a message written in a fit of bad temper and without
thought of means or consequences..
It is for these reasons, among others, that we decline to take the
President's message seriously. Shortly he will recover his temper,
repair his neglect to inform himself as to the facts and quit playing
the spoiled child. He can simplify neither Government nor spelling.
THE PATRIOTIC PETTICOAT
MRS. STUYVESANT FISH, vvho is understood to be a can
didate for the position of autocrat of "the 400," vice Mrs.
Astor. announces that in future she will wear none but
American clothes. 'Tis very well. The American petti
coat is more than a merely blameless garment, more than a common
protection against the weather. .It is a psychological expression,
a tailor-made idea, something between a dry goods dream and a
poem in frills.
That is what Mrs. Fish says in words of like effect, and although
her husband recently lost his job as president of the Illinois Central
to satisfy Mr. Harriman's appetite for more railroads, we do not
hold that up against Mrs. Fish, who, indeed, as the supreme ruler of
society, fills a more exalted office than any common railroad presi
dent holding his place as food for Harriman.
We reject with scorn the unworthy suspicion that Mrs. Fish's
new-born attachment to the fallals and furbelows of her native
land is intended to promote any political aspiration of the lady's
husband* who is for the present left with a good deal of time on
his hands. We are sure that Mr. Fish would make a most valuable
public servant, but perhaps he would not care to make the run on
his wife's patriotic petticoats. We prefer to accept at its face
value Mrs. Fish's declaration against foreign-fangled tailoring- when
she says: "The American woman is the best dressed in the world
because she is not bound by style. Her individuality is expressed in
her garments."
Thus we see that the American petticoat is far more than clothes.
It is a language, and the Star Spangled Banner speaks in its tem
pestuous folds. Long may she wave.
A TALE OF TWO CITIES
SAN FRANCISCO may consider herself fortunate by comparison
with her sister city of Valparaiso, overwhelmed by a calamity
nearly identical with that which visited this city. The insur
ance companies have done nothing for the Valparaiso fire suf
ferers because the earthquake clauses in that city were of a far
more binding nature than any that obtained here.. George L.
'Duval, who went to Chile as the representative of the New York
Merchants' Association, writes:
The earthquake clauses in the insurance policies almost certainly
exempt the companies from claims for damages by fire which immediately
followed the earthquake. The companies, however, make the announcement
that they will not respond for any claims whatever, holding that all the
fires were caused by the. earthquake. It is expected that they will ; be
obliged, perhaps willingly, to differentiate and pay- at least a portion of
the loss by iire, which occurred several days after the earthquake and after
the original fires were under control. These later fires are variously ascribed
to short-circuiting on resuming electric service, smoldering cinder's and to
incendiaries. . It is not the poorer class who have sufTered / fnost from the
disaster. As they are being provided with shelter, food and clothing for the
time they are in a little worse condition than they were before. "They have,
besides, the certainty of work at good wages. The great burden- really falls
upon the middle class, a vast number of clerks and employes. whose savings,
invested in their homes, were lost, and the shop-keepers who lost, everj-thing.
In San Francisco it is clear that the laboring classes are on the
whole better off than they were before the fire, and this; applies 'to
all kincls of labor, whether clerical or mechanical. The storekeepers
were considerable losers, but they recouped the greater part of. their,
losses from the insurance companies. The professional . men suf
fered in the loss of libraries and the scattering of clients, but; the
lawyers are making more money than ever before because of the
multiplicity of litigation arising from conditions left by, the fire.
editorial page
The only particular in which San Francisco suffers by comparison
with Valparaiso is that they seem to \u25a0have a municipal government
there that is good for something. Our municipal administration is
nothing but a pest and an obstacle to progress.
IN modern finance the wages of sin are paid by the stockholders.
Lawbreakers do not go to jail, and when \- convicted their finest are
paid from corporation funds and charged tp^t'opera ting expenses/
These conditions of confused morality, finance and raiirbad
management are .brought to light by Interstate Cpmmerce Commis
sioner ' Franklin K. Lane in connection with : the N payment of fines
imposed on Darius Miller, Lvjce president; of^;;the^Chicag6;^Burlington
and Quiricy, ;:.arid-^Claude G; Burnham, v freight^traffic ageiit'of the same
road. These officials were nried $10,000 each for/ giving ' rebates". Hy
a Federal court' in Illinois, and the company was -at ..the. same- time
fined $40,000.-" % Thewhble $60,000 was paid in;bne;check by. the
railroad company and charged, to the account of "correction; of
freight earnings. '.;. ' ( . * . '; •
- Of course, this diversion of the corporation funds was a gross
breach of trust on the part of the president and board of directors.
The laws of many countries ' make ; such - misapplication* of corporate
funds a criminal offense, and such should /be the iawjn; this: country.
It is money taken out of. the pockets; of stockholders toshield law r
breaking officials who should be held responsible -for their own
crimes. If these conditions had been obtained under the rate law of
last session the guilty officials would be in prison now. The pay
ment of their fines by the company, is not only ;• a*-; robbery of the
stockholders, but it makes a mockery of the law which^says that to
grant rebates is a criminal offense. *
The only way to stop rebates is to send the .guilty officials to
prison. ! -
f-ry HE restraint- of the Colorado and its overflow into the Salton
I Sink is properly a matter for national, and perhaps international,
I help. The original break in the river bank occurred on Mexi
can territory, and the cut that proved so disastrous was- made
by permission of the Mexican Government. .Some/ difficult; inter
national questions arise as to the iadjustment of damages, but there
is no reason why the dispute should, become acute.
'Congress will be asked to assist in keeping the river within
bounds and in restoringUHe navigation of the Colorado, River,; as
to which we are bound by treaty. H the original cut; in the river
bank was made on Mexican ground, yet it was the .work of American
citizens, for whose acts this Government is in some degree re
sponsible.
The chief ground, perhaps, ori which such an appropriation will
be asked is theTpreservation of a rich and fertile agricultural and
horticultural region which must be destroyed andfobliterated from
the map if; the overflow is permitted to continue.- It is a work in
which the national Government may very properly and beneficially

Discipline in the Goal Mines
of Great Britain
MIXING as a British industry
dates back over two . thousand
years, but In spite of all'means
known to the highest . civiliza
tion In the way of legislation, inspec
tion, mine discipline and;- Invention,
death's dally toll of lives abates but
slowly, writes Consul D. W. Williams,
from Cardiff. "According to , the com
plete statistics, for 1905, just published,
the highest death rate prevails in the
Cardiff district, which produces the
! smokeless-coal. To mine the 22,315,107
tons of coal -86,881 miners were em
ployed, of whom 287 lost their lives, or.
an average of 3.3 out of each. looo em
ployed. The death rate for the entire
kingdomwas 1.358 per 1000 employes.
Owing to the watchfulness of both
masters and men the discipline in the
mines is perhaps as perfect as It is on
shipboard. The: miners are haled Into
court for any .infraction- of the rules,
such as having matches, pipes or liquor
in their possession.' smoking, drinking
or sleeping in ' the mines, carrying
powder or cartridges In pockets or open
hands, carrying unlocked lamp, enter
ing place marked dangerous, neglecting
to sprag heading, to report defect in
ventilating door, presence of gas, or anr
other neglect resulting In possible in
jury to miner or horse, or even for fall
ing to report for work when not ex
cused. - The fines for these offenses
range from $5 upward, according to the
Circumstances. On the other hand,
masters are presented for manslaughter
when their. neglect causes the death of
a miner.
The average British miner- is born.,
and' not made,' and when he takes up
his father's pick he expects to wield
it: until he surrenders It to his son.
This and his temperament and other
conditions make him careful arid delib
erate to -a degree unknown in America.
It would -appear that he is becoming
more deliberate? year by year, for the

State Press Discusses the
Japanese School Case
THE President indulges in a hys
terical waving .of the "big
stick" at San\ Franclaco and
California because Japanese adults
are refused permission to attend
public schools with white children.
The terms used by the chief ex
ecutive are in questionable taste, and
seem to indicate that "his recent visit
to Panama developed a severe bilious
attack. They resemble more a pander-
Ing to the Japanese and mawkish East
ern sympathy than a recognition of the
rights of the people of this State. Cali
fornia is abundantly able to take care
of her , school system.— Madera Tribune.
California would be well rid of the
Japanese. ;, President Roosevelt to the
contrary notwithstanding. ,We know
thenvbetter than* do the public men of
the Eastern, States, and knowing. them,
we shall even hazard a" falling out .with
the President ."before tolerating them,
much V less .yielding to his, plan of
naturalization.'— San;: Jose. Mercury. .-.,.
If Calif ornia',had not cried loud and
.lon's' for the'Cnlnese.' exclusion law- the"
Pacific ' Coast "J would . r have ' been sub
merged;by Mongols, by this time. . "Al
though'the Japanese may not seek -to
come in as large . number?, " their as
sertiveness: and ability make :them
thrice dangerous. . We want no Asiatic
."influence" . to " deal with on. this coast.
Firm action will be in the. interest of
peace. . California will not embrace" the
Japanese.; There .are some : things no
power |on earth . can force a people to
do.— Stockton Record. ,
.President Roosevelt should not be
surprised if he learns. very shortly and
very positively. that, the people of Cal
ifornia are not the obsequious sub
jects of his dictatorship which he imag
ines them to be. They believe him to
be a man of good intentions, with oc
casional flashes of greatness, and per
haps, a measure of wisdom at times
not expected in one as demonstra
tively impulsive as he 13: but when he
declares that the white school children
of this State must share the classroom
with the brown children of another and
different- race he is either mistaken in
his estimate or the self-respect of Cal
if ornians or utterly misinformed or
uninformed of the reasons why they
object to the conversion of the State
into a dumping ground for the yellow
hordes of the Orient.— San Jose Mer

son has fallen gradually from 314 tons
In 1899, to only 279 In 1904. "Whether
this slowing, down of 35 tons In five
years Is due .to the greater difficulties
of raining or to the attitude of the
miner Is an open question.
It Is the general impression that the
death rate is lower in the British than
In the American mines. This la true If
the Tate be based on the number em
ployed, but such a comparison Is not
quite fair, because it takes Into ac
count only' one of the three elements
In the problem.. The following com
parison, using the last complete sta
tistics, those of 1904, tends to show
that the British death rate is, in fact,
higher than the American:

' .If the comparison is stopped at this
point, one element remains unconsld
ered, for the American tonnage ex
ceeded the British by almost 100,000,000
tons. . To produce the American ton
nage would require 1,262,761 British
miners, while to produce it In 202 days
wotrid require 1.637.538 British miners.
The employment of that number of
British miners, estimating 1 at their own
death rate, would cost about 2035 lives,
or at the rate of about 5.77 lives per
1.000,000 tons mined, which Is higher
than the American death rate.
Putting the matter In another form,
the British death rate Is reduced 1.33
lives per 1,000.000 tons by producing
coal at a slower speed, and the Amer
ican death rate Is increased by 1.22
lives per 1,000.000 tons, by the hiarher
Intensity of production, but to balance
this loss in part the Americans have
the use of 1.042.070 * men for employ
ment in other Industries.

has evidently let his enthusiastic ad-,
miration and sympathy for. the Japan
ese get the better of his judgment and

Coast newspapers and agitators as
siimc too much when they declare there
is no danger in the present contro

accompanied by much that was wanton

toward America?— Palo Alto Times.
In the school question at San Fran
cisco the people have T a right to con
trol. The -effort to centralize i 3 get
ting'; too strong anyway. . Our only
safety^!? to preserve as nearly. as we
can the rights of the States.. The Japa
nese will soon see -that - over, such a
matter ;as. this .the National Govern
ment has no control and hence It" will
make.no such demands on" the National
Government. ' In the ."request that the
powers of the President be Increased'
Mr. Roosevelt is perhaps wijong. If
he is or if he is not. It .remains with
the majority of this nation to decide.
He will have to abide that decision, and
it will certainly be \u25a0 against . any cen
tralization in the power of one man. It
may be argued that he Is safe. But it
cannot be said that we will always
have him or his equal. — Colusa Sun.
President Roosevelt's threat to em
ploy all the military and civil forces
he may lawfully use In enforcing the
rights of the Japanese under existing
treaties would be interesting if it were
not so ludicrous. There Is no law that
authorizes him to dictate to California
how she shall conduct her public
schools and no interference upon his
part, will be permitted. We believe
that the President is honest and means
to do right. Some of these days he will
see the error of his ways and he will
have the courage to admit that he was
wrong. — Woodland Democrat.
President Rosevelfs message to Con
gress Is a very strong document and
he deals with the big issues of the day
in his usual "straight-from-the-shavl
der style." But that portion of his mes
sage dealing with the Japs and the
San Francisco school question will meet
with almost unanimous . rejectment In
this State, as It should do. Our honest
and popular President, to use a slang
expression, "has got off on the wrong
foot" in the Jap matter, and when he
sees the true situation of affairs as we
Californlans do he will be. the first to
acknowledge his error.— Watsonville
