WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.— The fifty
ninth cnngi-ass began Its last session
at noon today,
It took the senate fifteen minutes to
arrange its preliminaries, and the house
an hour. .
The senate received from President
Jloosevelt a long list of appointments
lor Its confirmation, and In an executive
nesslon of nineteen minutes decided, as
the iKiniimitions had been received be
fore the body had been organized for
mally, to make no confirmations until
the president's annual .message had
been received and the session fairly
started.
Senators Penroso of Pennsylvania
and Foraker of Ohio came forward with
resolution?? of Inquiry ' regarding the
discharge of the negro troops of the
Twenty-fifth Infantry. i One wan ad

Not in years has a larger number of
members-elect of the lower house of
congress presented themselves at the
speaker's desk to take the qath of
office. ;■■•>-,'•: ■■?
Death has been unusually active
among the membership during the clos

Smithsonian Institution, vioe Robert

The galleries of the house were
crowded at an early hour. The. absence
of -flowers from the desks of the mem
bers was much commented on, but the
order of the speaker prohibiting the
floral display was generally com
mended for its good sense. The similar
rule was made in the senate two years
ago. ■ i- , :' .

ESTABLISHES
BURGLARY DEGREE
I Press,
OAKLAND, Dec. 3.— The
time that the sun set on No
vember 16 played an important
part in Judge Harris' court to
day at the sentencing; of Hugh
Sullivan for stealin:; tools.
The evidence at the prelim
inary examination of Sullivan
showed that the crime was
committed after 5:10 p. m., on
November 16. If the sun set
before that time on that uay the
crime would be burglary in the
first degree, if after that time
burglary in the second degree,
as the law marks the change
from day to night by the set
ting of the sun.
Judge Harris ascertained
that on November 16 the sun
set at 4:50 p. m.
Sullivan, who had pleaded
guilty to burglary without
reference to the degree, was
therefore adjudged by the
court guilty of burglary in the
first degree and sentenced to
two and one-half years at
Folsom.
THINK CLERK
ROBBED
SAFE
William Martin, checker and shipping
clerk for the Barnes Baking company,
1 338 San Julian street, living near
■ Fourteenth and Griffith avenue, was ar
rested lnst night upon complaint made
to the. police by George H..r.Barnes;
president" of the company, directing
suspicion toward Martin for the em
beyzlemont... of $439.35 if the . firm's
funds. '■ • •*■ .••••." .'. . v- i
i The money was missed from the safe
Friday morning, and. as .Martin Is said
to have been' the only '.person, in j tiie
office of thu.u6mpaily*THVlrsaay litt'rTC*
cireunisiantinl > evidence t led", his em
ployers to \seeiire' ' hio | arrest on the
charge of embezzlement. ■. , r.
The safe containing , the company's
money had been closed Thursday, but
the combination - was accidentally left
unset. Martin is alleged to have been
the. only man cognizant of this fact. '
Martin was cross questioned by Cap
tain of Police Walter Auble and George
H. Barnes in the detective office last
night at the central police station, but
firmly held to his first contention that
he was innocent of the charge. He was
examined for hours In the effort to ob
tain 8 confession from him, but al
though he broke down and cried for
mercy, he would not admit that he had
stolen the money. He is said to have
admitted, however, that he knew the
safe^ was unlocked and that the money
was contained In it.
Mr. Barnes told Captain Auble thnt
Martin had been employed' by his com
pany for nearly two years, and that
during that time there had been lossos
of small amounts of money at frequent
Intervals, which could not be accounted
for. Never, though, had these thefts
amounted to more than a few dollars,
he said.
Endeavoring to arouse sympathy from
the detectives Martin was incautious
enough to intimate that he had become
deeply Involved in debt while in Los
Angeles. It Is Understood that he has
become financially embarrassed by ex
travagant living, and his employer
thinks he stole the money from the Safe
in an effort to clear up these obliga
tions
Both Mr. Barnes and Capt. Auble re
fused to discusß the case.

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 3.— Tsuneji
Aiba, Japanese vice consul at Port
land, who is the nearest Japanese of
li<-ial to San Francisco and who is -be
lieved to reflect the real sentiment of
the Japanese on this coat, said that he
is certain President Roosevelt will set
tle the difficulties of the United States
and Japan satisfactorily.
"I don't think the time will ever
come when my country and yours will
ever be dragged into a war," he said.
"I have not received a single-line of
advice or-suggestlon from the Japanese
government as to what attitude I
should take in spite of the fact that I
am near the seat of trouble.
"This talk of the Philippines ever
behig a bone of contention or a casus
belli between Japan and America is
utterly ridiculous. .
"The wars that Japan and America
may fight will never be settled on fields
of battle. They will be waged inter
minably, perhaps, in ,the sensational
press. Both countries and the proto
cols and treaties will all be signed,
executed and delivered to the, proper
authorities entirely within the sacred
precincts of the editorial sanctum."

to become a teacher in Uie schools in
which he had 'been taught^ at. 23 com
mencing, to read law while earning his
living as teacher, drid'tw'd' years later
admitted to , the bar— that is a hasty
summary' 6f the early lifevof the next
mayor of Los Angeles, Lee C. Gates. ••■•-
Judging by the national records of
the last half century, no other method
o ( training . tends more strongly than
this toward efficiency, since' the sen
tence above would describe with, rea
sonable correctness the ■ early . lives' 'of.
more men. who have within that time
earned distinction .;. in ' public service
than any other form . of words. ' .'.' , |
Then followed three years "of strenu
ous work to which he 'surrendered him
self so utterly that at the end of three
years- his health was broken, and he
abundoned the practice lof the law,
never expecting to return It. Up
to this time his life had been spent in
Ohio (Mother of Statesmen) and In
diana, but now he heard ''-\c call of the
west and obeyed.it. ' ■ •■,■.•'.••■•
In 1885 he removed. to Butler county,
Kas.. taking with him his young wife
and infant daughter; and there,- on the
unbroken sod .of the prairie, set him
self to 'the establishment .of a stock
ranch and farm. .: . ...... . ,\- ■
For four years he w.as rancher and
stock ■ breeder, doing most of the work
(including the building of "a house''and
barn) with his; own hands. "!'
; This period of .four, years. out of the
very prime of his young manhood
(from 29 to 33)— four years of. such long
houred and back-breaking labor as
many who call themselves "wo'rklng
men" never: knew— was one of t.hemost
potent influences In molding his qhar
acter and fitting him for the high! posi
tion to which the citizens of Los An
geles are about to call him. • ■ •■■
k No man in Los Angoi.s knows better
he4.\vhat it Is to win v bread, for
himself, and- family at the . cost of
dripping, brow ■ aching muscles , and
calloused hands. No man knows bet
ter ithajv he that loyalty and courage
and Integrity, and :ct vie pride tire at
l eaßt as common' among the men 'In
overalls as among those In evening
dress. No man is more jUßtly entitled
•to be called the worklngman's candi
date than Lee Gates. | • • ■ ■ .
. Ranch work did another great thing
for him.' It gave him back his health,
and In ISB9 he again entered the
practice of law in a Kunsas - town.
Three yeurs later he was summoned to
Los Angeles by the officers of the com
pany which has since become tho Title
Insurance, and . Trust . company, and
with that Institution lie has remained
ever since, having been its chief coun
sel since 1894. As the company has
grown with the city and the burden of
work and. responsibility upon Mr. Gates
has. become overweighted, his ■ salary
has also .-Increased until ; today he can
exchange it for the salary of the mayor
of l.oa Angeles only at a serious finan
cial sacrifice— a - sacrifice over which
most of us would hesitate long.
There has been much ' Donaens< writ
ten and spoken- during, the campaign
-Just drawing to ■ oloae about the need
of a "plain business man" for a I""
moter of manifold ; business enterprises
(more or leas successful) . at the head
oi the great corporation, which .we call
the city of Los A«K«les In preference to
LEE- C. ClATga V
a "mere lawyer." The people of this
nation do not appear to agree with tWe
doctrine th.at "mere, lawyers"" are unfit
to hold the reins of government. Con
sider, for example, that every president
of the United States since Grant has re
ceived a legal training; that state after
state has chosen lawyers to occupy the
governor's chair; witness California
.with- Olllett,-, New York with Hughes,
i Missouri Avith Folk and Wisconsin with
; La Foljette, to mention only a very few
Of the, names wjilch will come most
readily to every man's recollection; that
; Nety York city and-a majority of the
larger cities of the United States now
have lawyers at the head of their mu
1 i< • i i ■: ■ 1 administration, and that one at
least-'of tw,o- largest industrial corpora
tions In the world, the steel trust, after
experimenting with a "plain business
man," has finally placed a "mere law
yer", at Its head. Certainly If Los
Angeles Is mistaken in seleoting a
lawyer as its chief executive officer, it
Is mistaken in_ the best company in
the country.
■ Consider further that whenever the
"plain business man" — or any other citi
zen—must make a really critical de
cision in his own affairs he invariably
lays the whole matter before some
"mere lawyer," and if he be prudent
acts. In. accordance with the advice re
ceived.
In very truth, the position which Lee
•■ Gates lia.s occupied for fourteen years,
and which he has filled to the entire
i satisfaction of the officers and'stock
holders to whom he was, directly re
sponsible as well as to that of the im
mensely, larger circle," the safety of
whose investments has depended upon
the, breadth : of his knowledge, ■ the
keenness of his penetration and the cer
tainty -of his decision — this training, I
say, has ■ been one almost ideally cal
culated to (It him' for the- responsibili
ties of the mayor's chair. I Particularly
at this very moment, when the city
Is about to emburk on enterprises of
Immense Importance, involving' the
raising iiticl i expenditure of huge sums
of money, while at the same time it
must, remodel its whole form of gov
ernment to correspond with its evolu
tion' from an overgrown town to a
great' metropolis, does Los Angeles
need for mayor a man . with the sa
gacity,* the ■ legal knowledge and the
judicial^ temperament which could. have
been l»< ■ 1 . -i ■ developed, at no other work
than'at.that which Lee Gates has been
doing. i i -i- ■ . r -
 But there. is a olty attorney's office,
do you say?. Quite true — und ,we are
to have an able and competent city at
torney for the, next three years. It Is
also true that the infinitude of ijetalls
with which ..the , city-, attorney's office
must be occupied will tax its energies
to the utmost. No man more promptly
than Mr. Hewitt will recognigetond as
sert the^muwtage— ves. the paramount
necessityy — of a iniiul In the executive
department of the city trained In the
law and equipped for shaping general
policies and solving for itself the knotty
problems with which the mayor of L'oa
Angeles will have to deul. It Is no
derogation to h!s rivals for the mayor
alty to Bay that none of them can com
pare at all with Lee Gates In this re
spect. • : •
' Many other points of special fitness
might be dwelt upon did time and
space allow, but I must content ' my
self with but a few more words. Even
In the heat of this fiercely contested
campaigns no man has dared whisper a
