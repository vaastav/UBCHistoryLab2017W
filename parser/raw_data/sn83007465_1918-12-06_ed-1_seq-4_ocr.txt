K\TK.\l>rri\(> THE KX-KAISKK
The proposition to extradite Hit
ex-kaiser to England and try him tor
murder appeals to most people as
nothing more than right and fairness.
lie is guilty of many crimes.
which tried to drag the world dowr
to the lowest depths of inhumanity
and brutality should play no part.
He should he tried as anyone else
would be tried, and neither pity nor
favor should he granted him.
The usual understanding of the
death penalty is that it is the high
est punishment possible under the
law. hut it is not. Life imprison
mem, wuunui .?
commutation of sentence, is mort
severe. The ex-kaiser doubtless do
serves a pood deal more than he wil
ever pet, but execution by the mos
humane methods as practiced nowa
days would he a relief to him com
pared with ttic rock-pile for life
Perhaps if tried in England for mur
dor, England would not be very len
lent, and should not be, but only th<
question of right and justice shouli
enter into the extradition and tria
and the sentence.
Of I I OK EtKOPE.
The seat of the United States gov
, eminent today is somewhere on tli
Atlantic ocean, and, strange as I
may seem, though we do not kno\
where, the business of governmen
will be directed as usual and titer
will be no signs of the removal o

President Wilson sailed from Ne\
York Wednesday aboard the (Iootr
I
the actual commission of which was
delegated to his subordinates. Is
there then any good reason why lie
should not bo tried? To most people
it appears that no sentence could b*.
too severe for this murderer of innocent
women and children, though
the punishment meted in the courts
falls harder upon some by reason ol
circumstances than upon others surrounded
by other circumstauces.
"What The News would give the exwar
lord would not be what is generally
considered the "extreme" penalty,
but it would make a common
prisoner of him and put him to work
on the rock-pile, which, to him,
would be a thousand times worse
than death in the electric chair or
public hanging.
It now appears probable that William
will be extradited, if it can be
m^niiv fiiitu* Ct?rl:iinlv if it m.inot
be legally clone, it should not be
done, but his guilt is not questioned
and it would hardly become Holland
to resist the extradition. It may
perhaps entail a legal tangle but it
appears to us that there is no question
of the legality of such step on
the part of the Criilnli govei uiiieul.
A bloodthirsty desire for the ex-emperor's
life is not becoming to anyone.
but that right and justice may
be fully met. he should be tried for
the crimes committed through his
authority. Only right and justice
should be considered and the fa<t
v>4 William having ruled the country
The president will be abroad fori
six weeks; rather he will be awayl
front Washington for that length of!
!
time though he will be in Europe]
just four weeks, it requiring a week'
1 to make the journey eaeh way. Ac-.
companying him are 23 experts who]
] have studied .European cond.tionsj
' for the past year and who are s<>
equipped in economic matte, s as to
be able to give valuable advice t<>
the peace conference. Included in
the list are men who are experts in
I
international law. college professors,
rated as. specialists in the history
and politics of various nations, and
j ollicers of the military intelligence
I divisions of the army. With them]
go tons and tons of documents and
) maps, which, together w ith other
I records of their investig itions ali
readv in Paris or on the wav. com
'| prise a collection of international!
| (lata said to be without parallel inj
history.
Hut the whole of the peace con-i
ferenoe is without parallel; the at-!
, tendance upon it of the president is
i without parallel; the underlying
j cause is without parallel; an era un !
paralleled is upon the world and
new conditions with which we are
| entirely unfamiliar are arising as th? j
: days pass and we must accustom;
I ourselves to tnanv conditions not
thitherto experienced. We have
j done so since the I'nitod States en
t? red the war and have "stood the
shock well."
The News suspects that President
Wilson whiic away from Washingt(*i
where the wheels of the government
grind dav in and dav out will
keep in as close touch with the aifairs
of the United Stall's a? '?
would had ho staid in tho ofllep at
tlio Whito TTouso. Surely, riivch i
ment by Ions distance telephone or
by wireless is something new under]
the sun. but this is one of the new^
t conditions with which we are to fa-i
niiliarize ourselves. The truth iv
i
President Wilson's presence at thej
peace conference was felt in all
i
countries and the opposition to his
going was confined to partisan poli(
tics and was not in any wise directed
by common sense. The part thej
United States played in the war was!
I
, largely through President Wilson's
1 ' I
direction and we inav expect to see!
his hand here and there in the set I
' i
tlements made at the peace confer
, enee.
j The hope of the nation is that thoj
president may have a safe voyage
and may rot urn in Rood hoalth.

PRESIDENT GREETS
A COLD CONGRES

office and that Vice President Ma
shal shall be immediately designate
by congress as President.
Senator Cummings, of Iowa, R
publican, introduced a resolutlc
stipulating that senate shall uppoii
a senatorial comm'ttee of eight 1
represent this nation at the pea<
conference. He recited that tl
senate is a part of the treaty-makin
machinery and that "It is extreme!
important that the senate be promp
ly, fully and accurately informed i
all the facts which may bo pertinei
to the proposed readjustment of tt
affairs of the various powers." H
resolution directs that the commi
tee of four Democrats and four U
publicans proceed to Paris at tl
proper time "in order to be thei
present during said peace confe
ence."
The resentment revealed wh<
the President came before con ere
has as its foundation two thing:
first, the belief of a considerab
nuinner 01 legislators mat tne pre*
dent should not leave the I'nltc
States for six or eight weeks. Se
ond. the fart that he has failed i
consult members of congress r
garding his program nor to ask tl
advice of senate leaders recardir
the details of a peace treaty whlc
the senate must eventually ratify
it is to be binding.
No Attempt to llcckle President
There has been an undereurrei
of complaint all along that the Pre
ident has been more or less a reel tit
and has not conferred freely with tli
leaders of congress, even those <
his own party. Heretofore, howe*
er. these criticisms have general
related to domestic affairs and whe
war came the criticisms were so
tened by the thought that Mr. Wi
son as commander-in-chief had tl
responsibilities of war and coul
hear them in his own way. In tl
field of diplomacy, also, congress ai
predated that the President was si
preme and represented this nation i
all diplomatic intercourse.
However, when it comes to U
writing of a peace treaty which wi
hind this nation and all others ft
the future, the treaty-making hod
of eonirress is evincing jealousy (
its prerogatives. The jealousii
came into the open and were revea
cd not only by the glances hut by t!
half-defiant attitudes of members <
the senate of the 1'nited States an
by their spoken words.
No one attempted to heckle tl
President during his address. The
