WAsnxyaTON', Dec. 11. On motion of Mr.
.MePherson, tho Senate bill for ths relief cf the
Erie Railway Company referring to the Court
cf Gains its claim for carrying tbe tuail on
certain route, between 1ST and 1S37 was
taken rp and p&astd.
21r. Frye's resolution of yesterday, instruct
ing the committee on foreign relations to inquire
into tbe state of affairs at tbe Samoan islands,
was reported back from tbe committee on con
tingent expenses, and was agreed to.
Tbe Sea ate, at 12. CO, resumed consideration
ct tbo tariff bill, tho pending question being
II r. Harris's amendment to reduce tbo duty on
beams, girders, etc., from 1 l-10c per pound to
0-10 of a cent.
Mr. Vest, referring to Mr. Sherman's speech
ysitenlay, denied the assertion that the late
lection bad settled tbe question of tariff legis
lation. He Mr. Vest was not disheartened by
that result. If tbe Senator from Ohio and his
yartr thought that the election had settled the
tariff question, a greater mistake had never
been made by mortal man. Th question would
last as Ion? as the country endured, because it
involved a fundamental difference in the con
' atruction of tbe Constitution, aside from the
policies of the government. If the position of
tho Republican party to day was the correct
one tnat of unlimited taxation for the pcrpoae
of protection tbo war would never cea?e, be
cause it was, in his judgment, a subversion of
the principles of the government and of Its Au
tonomy. Unless he was very much mistaken in
the American pecplo and had studied hu
man nature in vain, the result was
Inst as sure. in tbe course of
time, as that he stood in the Senate chamber to
day. But what he bad particularly wished to
iy was that, although the Senator from Ohio
xntcht be rijrbt io stating that the election was a
triumph of th protective principle, he absolute
ly denied, in the most emphatia terms, tbat it
settled the question aa to the details of the tilL
substitute. The details were, as a matter of
coorse, left to be adjusted afterward. For him
self, he would exercise his right to critie.se
and to oppose every single provision cf the sub
stitute, although it should take up the balance
ot tne session, uecause, in nis judgment, tne
lushest duty of every Senator was to scrutinize
every paragraph closely nod to discuss and vote
upon it intelligently, rroceedini: to details,
Sir. Vest undertook to contravene the statement
made yesterday by 21 r. Sherman tbat on the
metal schedule there was a redaction
.of 10 per cent duty in the substitute.
21 r. Vest continued to discuss the metal ached
tile in detail, and referred to the Steel Trust,
characterizing it as "a gigantic devil fish of a
combination," whieh pat an immense amount of
Xnoney into the Dockets of its members, in the
name of American labor and of protectinginfant
industries. He quoted from a trade journal to
bow that .tasrlcan manufacturers sent their
products to Canada to the amount of $36,000,000
a, year and wero there able to compete with the
products of British manufacturers, paying the
suns rata of dnties, and he asked why. if they
could do that, they needed such enormous pro
tection at home. He would be obliged to any
Senator who woald answer that simple question.
Mr. Gorman laid that he had never taken an
extreme view, either as to the reduction or in
crease of duties. The country had expected,
however, that there would have been a moder
ate decrease of revenues, so as to remove the in
equalities in the present tariff without interfer
ing with the capital invested or with the labor
employed in manufactures. But in the midst of
a presidential campaign, and for political pur
pose, the Senate substitute had been framed,
its purpose being a reduction of the taxation on
two or three articles, principally sugar and to
bacco, and an increase of taxation on all other
products, for the purpose of increasing unduly
tbe profits of certain manufacturing interests in
the North. And the J: en ate, he said, was now
net with the statement that there could be no
modification or reduction of tbe rates proposed,
and that the Republican side of the chamber
would vote solidly to keep the
substitute as it is. As to the item under con
sideration, he had no question, from his knowl
edge of the iron and steel business, tbat 1 cent
per pound would to ample duty on steel beams.
Probably that rate would be more than was nec
essary to protect that industry and all the labor
employed in it. His impression was, however,
that the rate proposed in Mr. Harris's amend
ment, six-tenths of a cent per pound, would be
too great a redustion.
Mr. Aldrich As one member on this side of
the chamber, I disclaim, entirely, occupying any
euch position as the Senator from Maryland sug
gests. Mr. Gorman I accept the statement of the
distinguished Senator from Ohio Mr. Sherman
to the effect tbat the substitute must be ac
cepted in its details.
Mr. Allison I entirely agree with the Sen
ator from Maryland tbat this bill should be dia
eussed in detail on the merits of each item, and,
ao far as 1 am concerned, as a member of the
finance committee, I disclaim any idea that tbe
bill ia immaculate in its details. 1 expect that
tbe finance committee itself will oiler a good
many amendments to it. I think there are sev
eral defects in it. I think that these steel-beam
people can get along with a duty of 1 cent a
found on steel beams, and at some proper time
shall be glad to offer that amendment. For
myself, I disclaim presenting a bill that is to be
put through on party lines on fr partv pur
poses. I shall listen with pleasn. o any crit
icisms on the details of the bill Th bill, in its
general frame-work, is intended to protect
American industries and American labor, but as
to its details I stsnd ready to listen to amend
ments, and to vote for them if tbey convince
my judgment that tho rate is either too high or
too low. I think that some of the rates pro
posed are too low, and I have so doubt I shall
vote to raise them. I think that some others
ire too high, and I shall vote to reduce them.
Mr. Gorman I am very glad, even at this
day, to have tbat statement from the Senator
from Iowa. We all understand why this Senate
substitute was framed. We all understand that
it was framed for a political purpose, and I am
sot complaining of that Tou succeeded in the
election; you carried tbe country. It was well
and magnificently done, and I have no right to
complain of it. But, now that the election is
ever, now that your party has sueoeeded, and
s soon to come into possession of every branch
f the government, it is tbe height of unwisdom
ts insist on tbese unduly high rates. There is no
fxense for the Senator from Iowa voting with
hi3 party, as he has done for the last three
dsys, as a unit on every itsm. If the Senator
is convinced tbat this bill is imperfacs, if he be
lieves there are items in it which ought to be
amended, why not recommit the bill and bring
in a measure that is somewhat perfect? Why
does he vote down every amendment offered by
a Democrat, whether it be right or wrong, and
hold out to us only the hope that hereafter the
finance committee may offer amendments
covering these casesl I do not think
that any interest of the country demands that
this bill shall be pressed in mere partisan spirit.
I am rady to take up every item in the bill and
consider it and vote on it. I cannot vote for
the amendment offered by the Senator from
Tennessee, for I conceive that amendment is too
radical, but I do want a reduction of duty on
tbat particular article. We will go to the
country again on thts subject, and I hope that
oar side will be able to show tbat protection to
American industries, to tbe fall extent of pro
viding for the difference in cost of labor here
and elsewhere, will be made by this side, but
that the sharp distinctions advocated by the
Republicans, here and elsewhere, would buildup
monopolies way beyond anything that has ever
oeen arearrod or, even during war times.
The debate was continued at great length by
Senators Mcpherson, Allison. Vest, Aldrich
and Gorman. In the course of it, Mr. Allison
disclaimed the idea that the Senate substitute
had been prepared for any political purpose.
Thero never had been a time when the finance
committee did not know that a
revision of the tariff and a re
duction of the revenue was an absolute
necessity. The bill had been prepared by the
Republican members of the finance committee
on their responsibility as Senators, and not for
the b-e purposes of party capital.
Having ma le a reference to the rum shops of
New Jersey, Mr. Frye particularized them aa
those of Hudson county, and eaid that county
had given the Democratic party a majority of
over 8, CC0, while the Democratic majority in tbe
whole State was not much over 7,000.
In farther discussion Mr. Allison again re
pudiated the idea of the Senate substitute being
got up for political purposes, and threw back
the charge upon the Mills bill, whieh, he eaid,
bad had the Indorsement of the Democratic
national convention and had been framed on the
lines of the President's message. He said there
bad not been an amendment offered yesterday
tbat had not been taken "body and breeches'
from the Mills bill. If tbe object of the Demo
crats Senators was to prevent the
substitute being sent to tbe House
of Representatives, be gave tbem notice
that he could stand early adjournment as loog
as they could. If they wanted to argue tbe
items in the bill, ao be it; but if they wanted to
ra the dilate as ajparty machine ho rave then
notice that so far as he had authority with ref
erence to the measure be should astc for its con
sideration every day in the morning hour and at
2 o'clock until disposed of.
Mr. McPherson took up the allusions to the
run interest of Hudson county, New Jersey,
and gave it as his opinion that if the rum inter
est bad consulted its own advantages it would
nave been found voting with tbe Republican
party, which was ia favor of free rum rather
tban of a reduction of dnties on tbe net )ssaries
of life.
Mr. Vet, commnting on a remark by Mr.
Allison that tbe Democratic party was dying
bard, said that that might be true, but that he
took great eotourneement from tbe example set
by that distinguished Senator who had been
'kllled, twice in R-publican presidential con
ventions; but if tbere was ever any livelier
corpse tban tbe Senator to-day he Mr. V'estl
had never seen it. Laughter. He assured
bis friends that the old Democratic party,
though slightly disfigured, was still in the ring,
and that it would be ready to enter the lists in
tbe next presidential canvass and meet tbe Re
publican party on tbis question. He commented
upo n tbe recent dynamite explosion in a Chica
go distillery, which bad been charged upon
the Whisky Trust, and upon the clos
ing of the Montana copper mines by
order of the copper syndicate, throwing out of
employment, he said, 2.500 men in the middle of
winter; also, upon the Sugar Trust; and said
that the commercial devil fishes were crushing
tbe life out of all legitimate trade and commerce
in the United States.
Finally, the discussion closed and a vote was
taken on Mr. Harris's amendment to reduce the
duty on steel beams, etc. , from 1 l-10c a pound
to 6-10e per pound. The amendment was re
jected yess 120, nays 29. All the votes of Re
publican Senators were in tbe negative, and
with tbem voted Senators McPherson and
Payne.
Mr. Gorbam did not vote at all
Mr. Vest then moved to fix tbe rate on steel
beams, etc., at lc per pound.
Mr. Allison assented to that on the nart of
the finance committee, saying that be had been
instructed to offer tbe amendment, and would
have done so if he had been recognized by tbe
chairman. The amendment was agreed to with
out division, and the rate on steel beams, etc.,
stands at 1 cent per pound.
An amendmeut offered by Mr. Vance to re
duce tbe rate on trace-chains from 3 cents to
2 cents per pound was rejected, but on sugges
tion of Mr. Allison the item was passed over
without definite action.
An amendment offered by Mr. Jones, of Ar
kansas, to make cotton ties free of duty gave
rise to a long discussion, participated in by
Senators Jones, Berry, McPbrson and Vanco
on one side, and by Senators Dawe3. Aldrich
and Stewart on the other. It was not disposed
of, the Senate going into executive session and
soon adjourning.
Debatios the Direct-Tax Dill.
Washington', Dec. 11. After the miing of
the journal the House went into committee of
the whole Mr. McCroary, of Kentucky, in the
chair on the direct-tax bilL
Mr. Hopkins, of Illinois, spoke in support of
the measure and in opposition to the proposed
amendment refunding the cotton tax. If there
was merit in the latter proposition, that merit
should be discussed in a separate bill, and the
amendment should not now he brought forward
to embarrass consideration of the pending
measure. He controverted the position taken
by Mr. Barnes, of Georgia, that the cotton tax
was unconstitutional, and contended that the
tax was uniform, as contemplated by tbe Con
stitution, being levied the same in Illinois
as in Georgia, and having been collected
from twenty-six States and 'Territories. The
assumption that this tax had been paid by the
people of the Southern States was a mistaken
one. It had been paid by the consumers in the
Northern States. In answer to the declaration
made by certain members from the South that,
tbat section was borne do wq by internal-revenue
taxation he presented a comparative table to
show that that declaration was incorrect. If it
was true tbat the producer and not the con
sumer paid the tax, it would be seen that in the
decade ending 1SS0, Illinois had paid $1SS,212,
0C0, against $4,100,000 paid by Georgia.
Mr. Allen, of Mississippi, could find no war
rant in the Constitution for refunding the direct
tax. Tbe advocates of the bill believed in con
stitutional limitation, but thought the limita
tions should be on somebody else, and not on
themselves. The principle of the bill was bad
that tbe tax should be refunded because some
States bad not paid it. If the taxes were to be
refunded, the cotton tax was the first which
should be dealt with, and he gave notice of an
amendment which would constitute the cotton-
tax fond as en educational fond for the State
which had paid it.
Mr. Seney, of Ohio, supported the bill, whose
purpose, he said, had been grossly misrepre
sented. In the newspapers and political gather
ings it was stated tbat the Dill was a mere raid
by the loyal States upon the treasury. An ex
amination of the facts would show that the so
called disloyal States would receive their por
tion of the money. It was true that the bill
would take $17,000,000 out of the treasury, but
the money belonged to the people, and the
sooner it was legislated out of the treasury and
into the pockets of the people the better for the
people. The people needed it. and tbe govern
ment bad no use for it. If the bill passed it
would place each and every State where it stood
in 1861, when the tax was levied.
Mr. Buekalew, -of Pennsylvania, argued
agaiost tbe policy of taking money from tbe na
tional treasury for distribution among the
States, and in tbe name of Pennsylvania he pro
tested against throwing into her treasury the
sum of $2,000,000 to disarrange ber well-conceived
and well-understood financial system,
and to test the wisdom and Integrity of her Leg
islature. Pending fnrther debate the committee arose,
and the Speaker laid before tbe House a com
munication from tbe Secretary of State, inclos
ing a final ascertainment of the result of the
election for President and Vice-president in
New Jersey, Kansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mis
souri, Maryland, North Carolina and Georgia.
Laid on the table.
The committee then resumed its session.
Mr. Elliott, of South Carolina, generally fa
vored the bill, though he tiought it should bo
amended in some particular!;.
Mr. Herbert, of All opposed the bill on
constitutional grounds, and because it wouid
work injustice. Passing to a discussion of the
cotton tax, he argued that it was unconstitu
tional in that it was not uniform. A tax on
cotton was a tax on the only industry upon
which the people of the Sooth must live.
Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, said that validity and
binding force of the act imposing the direct tax
had nevor been questioned. That tax bad been
levied in the direction of "ultimate free trade."
He quoted those words because one wing of the
Democratic party would compel the government
to support Itself by direct taxation. If a 40-percent,
tariff was robbery, 5 per cent, was robbery
pro tanto. A direct tax seemed to be the ulti
mate goal of the statesman of America .who
were inveighing against the idea of taxation on
tho articles consumed by the American people.
A direct tax was an unpopular tax acd one
which should only be resorted to in an emer
gency. In 18G1 such an emergency existed, and
tbe people of tho loyal States had paid tbe tax
and raised the money to save the people of tbe
South from their folly he would not say crime,
because he did not wish to rake the smoldering
embers. Out of tbe common fund raised by the
tax it was proposed to witbdraw what tho loyal
States had put in an'i to leave the South with
out its record of defait ation. If the $17,000,000
raised by that tax had crushed the rebellion, de
stroyed slavery and restored the Constitution,
who were most benefited by it tbe men who
paid the money or the men who were to-day
honorable members of the great family of
Statesl Why should the men of tbe South com
plain that tho smsll principal should be re
turned to the States that paid it without
interest and tho charge of defalcation be re
moved from the States that had not paid the
taxi Underlying this proposition was the great
fact that the passage of the bill would put the
people of the country where equity says they
ought to stand. It was a step toward the com
plete reunion of the hearts of the people of the
country, a reunion not enforced by law, but
controlled and promoted by the wish and pur
pose of both sections of the country to do actual
justice toward eaeh other.
Mr. Whiting, of Michigan, opposed the bill as
being unconstitutional and unjust It would
take the money from the national treasury and
place it in the treasuries of the several States.
The only object in this was a reduction
of State taxes, and the money would
therefore practically go into the pock
ets of those who owned property.
Tin was glad that the country had a President
rl.o would not sanction sneh legislation.
Mr. Knloe, of Tennessee, declared tbat the
bill was sustained neither by law nor by prece
dent; he denounced it as a subterfuge and a
fraud, and charged that its aim was to perpetu
ate the power of the trusts to exact tribute from
tho people by means of a high tariff. Referring
to the cotton tax, he attacked it on constitution
al grounds, and spoke in favor of a proposed
amendment refunding the tax as far as possible
to the persons who paid it, and reserving the re
mainder as a common school fund.
Mr. Dibble, of South Carolina, stated that it
was a mistake to suppose tbat the State of
Sooth Carolina was in default in regard to the
direct tax. Asa matter of fact, more than its
quota had been paid io. He thought that the
refunding of tbe tax was a thoroughly constitu
tional and equitable proposition.
Pending further debate, the committee rose
and tho House adjourned.
BEAUTIES OF CERAMIC AM
A Rich and Varied Collection of Pottery
Most Attractively Exhibited.
Some Rare Specimens to B Seen Along with
tho Artistic Work of Totters of To
Day Address of Mrs. Hussey.
The first exhibit of the Art Association for
this season, began yesterday, and will continue
throughout to-day and to-morrow, at the resi
dence of Mrs. Myla Ritzioger, No. . 250 North
Tennessee street, who has thrown open ber large
par'ors for the display. Through the center of
the two rooms is a long table on which is placed
the Rookwood and Beleek ware, the chief feat
ure? af the exhibit. The Rookwood pottery is
manufactured at Cincinnati, and is in the full
glazed and dull finish. It is all distinguished by
the same delicate gradations of the ground color
and ranges through overy tint, from the darkest
to the lightest tone. Tho colors are mostly olive
and brown; for the decorations, flowers in natu
ral and conventionalized forms are used, and
as all is free hand, no two pieces are exactly
alike. Another ware made at the same factory
is the "cameo. m It comes shaded in the most
delicate tints of pink, blae, buff and
terra cotta, r.nd is daintily embellished. The
articles are nseful and ornamental, and com
prise vases, baskets, rose jars, cups and saucers,
bonbonniers, cream-jugs, sugar-bowls, teapots,
ehocolate potr, salad bowls, olive and bon-bon
servers and jardinieres. One large jardiniere is
tinted in blue and terra-cotta, beautifally
shaded, and has a decoration of daisies. Tbe
articles are in the quaintest and oddest of
shapes.
The Beleek china is thin and delicate, and
comes in exquisite designs, simply indescriba
ble. The vase sent to Mrs. Harrison is of
this ware, and is very beautiful. A dupli
cate is in the exhibit, and is for sale.
There are four decorated pieces of the Beleek,
two in gold, one in blue and the fourth in col
ors. The designs are all simple, as tbe china is
so beautiful it needs but very little, if any, dec
oration. A lovely dish for flowers is oblong and
has a lace-work insertion, handles and edge, sim
ilar to Mrs. Harrison's vase. There are also
cups and saucers, odd vases and flower-holders,
pitchers, cracker jars and other articles. One
form of the Beleek is the bamboo, the design
being ribbed, as if made of small bamboo sticks.
The ware can be decorated, and the queer shapes
are very desirable. There is also some Amer
ican Royal Worcester, which is much admired.
Aside from the Rookwood and Beleek. a num
ber of artists here and elsewhere have loaned
their work to add to tho beauty of the exhibit.
Mr. Paul Putzki has a salad set,
of thirteen pioces, each having a
design of some ingredient of a salad. He also
shows several plaques and plates, all done with
the same beauty of design and finish that char
acterizes all of his work. Among Mr. Putzki'a
pupils, who have some pieces In the exhibit, are
Mrs. Benjamin Harrison, who is represented by
a square plaque, with a design in yellow and
white chrysanthemums.
Mrs. David Coffin has a half dozen cups and
saucers, arranged in a blue plush case. In tho
top of the case, artistically arranged, is a bunch
of peacock feathers. A handsome vase is in
imitation of Royal Worcester, and it would puz
zle a connoisseur to tell the difference between it
and the real. Mrs. E. L. lUcKee has a dozen
fruit plates, each having a different fruit design.
She also has two slender-neck vases, one with
a rose and the other a pansy design, and three
other vases.
Mrs. J. C Walker has several handsome
plaques, excellent in design and work.
Miss Daisy Roberts has half a dozen fruit
plates, Aliss Roberts a vary pretty chocolate
pot, nnd Miss Jessie Fisher also has some cups
and saucf rs that are very pretty.
Mr. J. P. Gookins shows an exquisite plaque,
called Tho Spirit of the Poppies Summer in
Sleep."
Some of the hadsomest carved wood ever seen
in tbe city is the work of Miss Jeanette Love, of
Muncie, who has loaned it to the exhibit. There
are two tables one in oak. with a design in
holly leaves and berries, with a conventional
border, and tbe other was In cherry wood, with
ivy-leaf design. A ball cbair and organ-bench
in oak, are unique in both form and carving.
A fifth piece is an easel. It is elaborate, and a
fine specimen of the work of this sifted wood
carver. Mrs. T. O. N. Morris bss five pieces of
wood-work that are excellent. Mrs. Morris is a
pnpll of Miss Sara Levy, whose wood-carving is
much admired in Cincinnati slid Oxford, and
Mrs. Morris has taken . instructions from her
here, but a few weeks. Some of tLe daintiest
work Imaginable is the painting done on bolting
cloth by Miss Mattie Tuttle; one piece, which is
framed in gilt and white, is equal to a very fine
water color. Miss Tattle's painting is aa ex
quisite as the material upon which it is done.
Mrs. A. E. Ferry, whose china painting
ia so much admired, has a number
of articles, cups, saucers, plates, oyster sets,
and bread and milk sets, all tastefully decorated
by ber brush. Mrs. A. J. Thomas has several
pictures, and there are some very fine portraits
painted on ivory by Miss Heuermann, of Chi
cago. The Rookwood Pottery sent some
souvenir jurs of their ware. The feature yes
terday was an excellent paper read by Mrs. J.
R. Hussey, as follows:
"Among all the discoveries of man, the mak
ing of pottery is the oldest and most widely dif
fused art, and has been used by every tribe on
earth, savage and civilized. It mar bo that
Adam touehed the spring which has fed all the
streams flowing on in ever-increasing volume
through all the ages. We are told
that its known history began with
the Tower of Babel, but the oldest
known pottery is from Egypt, where the art of
enameling and painting with colors, was dis
covered. From thence it was transmitted to the
Greeks, who, not seeming to have liked it, prac
ticed it but seldom; confining their efforts to
un glazed ware, or painted and covered with a
thin lustrous varnish. This art, handed down
to the Romans, was lost in Europe, until in a
modern ago the Saracens, by their brilliant
productions, aroused the Christians to imitate
their example. It is believed that the art of
making porcelain was discovered about two
thousand years ago, in China. From thence it is
traced to Japan and to Italy in the fifteenth
century. From Italy to France and Germany,
and through Holland to England and America.
The productions of each country are character
istic, but American pottery, like its paintings,
having been borrowed, has, as et, but
few distinctive peculiarities. However, there
may be a grain of satisfaction in
feeling tbat the cups on our tables are liueal
descendants of those of pyramidal times. Tbe
lover of pottery and porcelain is certainly justi
fiable in his hobby. The highest result of civili
zation is said to appear in the bent union of
beauty and utility. Almost all other beauty
fades or decays. Flowers are short lived, paint
ings on paper or canvas fade or change, but the
flowers on our cups, unless broken, will be as
bright a century hence as on tbe day they
were copied from their perisbing model.
"To form some idea cf the civilizing and
elevating influences effected by the introduction
of porcelain, we must reflect on tbe loss that
would be felt among the poor as well as the rich
if it were abolished. The poor might return to
earthenware and the rich to gold and silver, but
it is a change we do not like to coasider. We
enjoy our tables furnished with bright and
tasteful ware, and cling most affectionately
to the associations clustering around tbe rare
old China and white and blue stoneware of our
youth; which are like unto 'The touch of a
vanished hand, and the sound of a voice that is
atilL'
"Pottery, in the broadest meaning, includes
everything, made by baking in nre or furnace,
into the composition of which clay outers, and
here we find a similitude to man, who, being
made of the dust of the earth and launched
in the furnace of life, stands an
example of the different degrees of
heat and polish the all-wise Potter has seen fit
to apply. We all know tbe opaque and unglazed
kind, very slightly baked, which represents tbe
Vessel in the rough, red, yellow or black, ac
cording to the color of the clay. The savage, in
all bis native unadorned condition, has
had none of the decoration of the civ
ilized races. These are the porcelain or
translucent pottery. Here we find two
classes. Soft or artificial, and hard paste,
and we are all familiar with plen
ty of illustrations of each. The difference
between tbe two is not always easily perceived,
as we too well know.
"Soft paste porcelain is in general soapy or
oily to the touch, and can be scratched with a
fine iron point Tbe glaze covers the whole ob
ject, while in hard porcelain we often find un
glazed points on the under side or rims. The
latter will resist the file, and will in all re
spects offer a firm foundation for our faith.
Tbe true porcelain is made by the union of an
infusible clay, known by its Chinese name
kaolin and a stone, feldspar. Kaolin is an es
sential ingredient, and it cannot be made with
out it It does not effervesce with acids and re
sists the highest temperature of the furnace.
More than one firing is required to turn out the
most perfect pieces. Each coat of glaze, en
am el or paint must bo ubjeeted to fire and (ew
good specimens are executed without
two bakings and often four or five. It is impos
sible in such a hs.sty sketch to give a clear idea
of the vast field of work suggested under the
head of Pottery. Tbe subject is so endless that
one scarcely dares touch upon it. not knowing
where the labryrinth will lead. Tbe Egyptian,
Greek and Roman, as well as the ancient Ameri
can fields, are too rich and rare to be lightly
touched by an apprentice hand. A study not to be
exhausted in years of research must be passed
reverently by. Even so, the early efforts of
France, Germany and England, China and Ja
pan also, tempt the lover of the beautiful to
become a victim of the Dog Fo or the Forty
Thieves. A mere mention of tbe styles most
familiar to us is all tbat we can venture upon
to-day. I sometimes long to be admitted to the
famous collections preserved in the different
parts cf . the world, but if my Increase
of knowledge were to detract from my pleasure
in my own little cups of Dresden or Limoees. I
wouid 4o better to drink mv tea in silence, and
lose my more ambitious flights in contempla
tion of these translucent fields of humble and
familiar flowers. Mygropings have resulted in
some surprises as well as disappointments. The
creamy old "Satsuma'' found everywhere in
Japanese ahops does cot figure among native
collections of value their Satsuma being
different in color and workmanship. The old
original Chineso decorations were in blue and
white. This bine was imported to Holland,
from whence we get our bine delft, so common
in Ameriea in early days. The Chinese deco
ration is often symbolical and represents the be
liefs and habits of the people ranging from
pictures of Confucius to the bat. The latter is
rather remarkable. Its Chinese name is the
same as the word that stands! or happiness, and is
employed as a symbol for tbe latter. It is some
times met with on pieces repeated five times,
and stands for longevity, riches, tranquillity,
love of virtue and a happy death. Chinese gen
tlemen are lovera of old porcelain, and pay even
higher prices than the most extravagant of
Western collectors. The cracxle-ware, with
which we are .11 familiar, is a favorite with
them and has been admired for 1,000 years. One
process of making this is by covering the
surface with a certain paste, which will at once
crack upon being plunged while hot, into cold
water.
JapLnese porcelain is derived from the Chi
nese, of which it frequently bears the marks,
and with which it is often confounded, bur,
though the process of manufacture is the same,
the ornamentation is often very unlike. The
colors are more pure and brilliant, the figures
more refined, correct and elegant, and
the plants, animals, and especially the
birds and fishes are more exact and original. A
great difficulty in the way of our understanding
these wares results from a practice, which is
common throughout the country, of bequeath
ing to a son or favorite apprentice the trade
mark of a celebrated potter. Different work
men will often inscribe their names, or the
piece will be dedicated to some one. A difference
in handwriting will also make confusion. Tho
Japanese, like the Chinese, are good collectors.
They do not have many specimens, but those
tbey have are well preserved in velvet or silk
bags and are handled with care.
"The Italian field offers a tempting and
abundant yield of rich and artistic material, but
a passing reference to tbe Capo di Monte factory
at Naples must suffice. This factory for porce
lain was founded by Charles 111 in 1730. Its
triumphs were in 6oft paste porcelain.
Tbe King took great pride in it, workiog
with his own hands and encouraging the pro
ductions of good wares for the use of his sub
jects. On tbe accession of Ferdinand IV, in
1759, the second period of the works com
menced. In the annual fairs, held in the palace
square, a booth was devoted to the porcelain,
and the King showed groat interest in the daily
reports or sales, which were brought to him,
with tho names of the purchasers.
Fair specimens are to be found in Naples and its
neighborhood. Those made in the second
period, decorated with colored reliefs, are less
common than the plain white, having been pro
duced for tbe wealtby class. They include ex
quisite shell and flower work, as well as groups
of figures, which are delicately painted and
gilded. Many equal or surpass in delicacy and
perfection the finest productions of Sevres
or Dresden. The stippled character
of flesh painting was the means of identification
although not reliable, as many fine pieces were
not stippled. The early pieces in white were
somewhat yellowish in glaze and principally
valuable as being of greater age. Considered as
a whole, the Copo di Monte wares, both cheap
and expensive, rank in taste and beauty, as well
as artistic finish, above those of many European
factories. The crowned N mark was sometimes
written backwards. The factory closed in 1821.
"Upon entering the French domain we must
pass Palissy and his struggling followers, to
take up tbe names most familiar to us. In
1756 Louis XV established the manufacture of
the famous ware called Sevre, in which Madame
De Pompadour ii said to have been interested.
Soft paste was used until in 1769. when a lady
nea.. Limoges found some white clay whieh
she ' believed might be used in wash
ing as a substitute for soap. A chemist
recognized it as the desired kaolin and front
this the history of Sevres is a brilliant one. En
tire articles of furniture, clocks, mirror and
other frames, besides all articles of table ware,
were made in the most elaborate styles. We
who have such a rarity of beautiful things on
which to spend our surplus can scarcely under
stand the craze which induced men to give 900
for a single vaie. Tbe letter L is the present
mark.
"Another favorite French porcelain is Limo
ges, with which we are all familiar. It did not
become Important until in 1820, when the
Messrs. Haviland, of New York, seeing some of
tho work, entertained tbe idea of introducing it
into the Xmerican market. They went to
France, and eventually established a factory of
their own, where they employ daily 1,200 men,
and manufacture six thonsand plates a
day, to say nothing of other arti
cles. They have introduced machinery run
by steam to supplant the potters wheeL
In 18S6 there were in the town and district of
Limoges thirty-five porcelain factories, pos
sessing eighty-six kilns, and giving employment
to five thousands persons; sixty-two decorating
establishments, employing two thousand hands,
and thirty mills for grinding and preparing the
clay. The Havilands produce about 10 per cent,
of the whole now made in Limoges.
"The French apply the word faience to all
pottery anoTporcelain, while the word as adopted
in England excludes porcelain and is confined
to pottery decorated with colors.
"To Augustas II, King of Poland, wo are in
debted for the famous Dresden china. The an
cient marks are in use to-day tbe monogram
'A. R. Augustus, Rex.' The crossed swords
taken from the arms of the Elector of Saxony
sometimes haven dot or star between the han
dles; also, the single letter R,'or the word
'Dresden' are used. From here, as in.all fac
tories, plain .pieces are often taken
and decorated elsewhere. In this case
we find a cut across tbe mark.
Several cuts denote a defect In England Staf
fordshire, the clay eountry, has been the seat of
English pottery from the earliest times. Tbe
size of butter pots, of earthenware, was regu
lated by Parliament to hold fourteen pounds.
Their quality was also ordered to be so firm as
not to take in moisture and increase their weight
They also made tablets for graves and bouse
decoration. Tho blue delft was introduced
from Holland in the seventeeth century and is
now found in old families both in old and New
England. To Josiah Wedgewood this art, in
xaodern times, owes more than any ether per
son. Among the greatest of bis improvements
was the invention of the paste called jasper,
for cameos, portraits and bas-relief. Here we
find copies of tbo finest sculpture and painting.
Tbe mark is the simple name, 'Wedgewood.'
"For the Royal Worcester, Crown, Derby and
Minton of the present day their perfect speci
mens must speak for themselves. They are fair
rivals to the Limoges, although the latter has
been conceded the greatest degree of perfection.
All employ the best artists of tbe day as
decorators, but until the artist is allowed to use
his signature, as is done in a few cases, wo can
not hepo for uniform excellence.
"American pottsry is slowiy coming to the
front. Tbe Beleek, of Trenton, N. J., and our
favorite Rookwood are much admired. It is
only a few years since the famous Pottery CluD
of Cincinnati, was founded, and it has already
a more than local reputation. To Miss Louise
McLaughlin, a member of tbe club, is as
signed the credit of rediscovering the Havi
land process of decoration under
tbe glaze. Another member is 31 rs.
Maria Longworth Nichols. who for
some time supported a school, and founded the
Rookwood Pottery, an example of the influence
of International expositions. Tbe Japanese col
lections at our centennial exposition suggested
to Mrs. Nichols the idea of developing latent
poesibilities in the clays of Ohio. At present
one of the characteristics is the unusual variety
of clay bodies and glazes. Another is
the absence of restrictions on the artists.
They are not bound, as ia purely
commercial enterprises, to the production
of a giTen amount of work, but are left free to
produce individeal work. The perfection and
strengthening of the ground and simplicity of
decoration are the expressed aim. They keep
before their pupils specimens of the standards
set by the leading ceramists of the world, as in
centives to achievements not yet attained.
Tbo Beleek, of New Jersey, has been borrowed
from Ireland the ware taking its name from
the town of Beleek, where a very superior clay
is found. Owing to the characteristic lack of en
terprise, the original manufacturers failed, but
the factory wai re-established in 1581, and is

doioe fairly well There are two firms ia New
Jersey turning out very beautiful ware
Messrs. Ott & Brewer and Willets. Each
claim imported Irish laborers from Beleec.
We have in our collection some exquisite pieces
of borne talent which speak for themselves and
in which we take a just pride. VTe can safely
say there are plenty of painters of pictures who
are doing far less to spread the love of art"
Mrs. Hussey had pieces of china representing
the several makes mentioned in the paper.
Among them was a tea set and tray in pure
white with figures from celebrated pictures in
relief. Tbere was also a Capo de Monte from
Italy, made in 1736, and loaned by Mrs. Ritz
ioger, and the same ware, made later, with tbe
fresh colors, loaned by Rev. N. A. Hyde, was
also exhibited. A real Dresden piece,
made for Napoleon and bearing the
royal crest, an N surmounted by a crown, which
was used on Napoleon's table and brought to
this country by A. T. Stewart, was loaned by
Mrs. Fahnley. There were pieees of Japanese,
Chinese, Limoge, Haviland, Satsuma and Thun,
all fine specimens of the wares. This is regarded
as the most snccessfnl exhibition ever held.
Superiority of American Workmen.
Pittsburg, Dec 11. A couple of Pittsburg
tube-workers have just been engaged to go to
England to teach the employes in theLonemore's
tube-works some new points in the manufacture
of tubing. They hare a contract at $5 per day.
Thomas Longmore. one of the proprietors cf tbe
great English plant, waa in the city and left for
New York: this afternoon, en route for home.
He has been making a tour of tbe steel-mills of
this country, and said be was greatly impressed
with what he had seen, and pleased with the re
ception which bad been tendered him by the
manufacturers of Pittsburg and Ohio. "I am
taking a couple of workmen back with me,"
said he, "but I do not care to discuss this mat
ter to any extent. I am afraid your manufact
urers might think I was trying to secure some
of their best men." Mr. Longmore observed,
while visiting the mills here, that the American
workmen were more rapid and had a better
system of doing their work tban the iron-workers
of tbe old country. The two men he took
back with him are some of the most skillful in
their craft. Mr. Longmore' principal object is
to gradually inaugurate a new system in his
worts, to run it on the American plan. Mr.
Longmore says business is exceedingly good
with the iron men of England. "We have,"
said he, "a very good trade in America, and it
is increasing."
Foreign Flags Not Wanted.
Cleveland, O., Dee. 11. The new central
viaduct, an immense iron structure, connecting
the South-side, a suburb, with the business por
tion of the city, was formally dedicated to-day.
The viaduct is 101 feet in height and about
three-quarters of a mile in length. The struct
ure bad been decorated in honor of tbe event.
The decorations consisted of flags and festoons
of evergreens. The flags of foreign nations pre
dominated, there being 66 of them, and 20
American flags. This caused the utmost excite
ment and greatly enraged many citizens. Mem
bers of the Grand Army of the Bepublic re
fused to march until some change was made.
As soon as the city ofScials heard of the matter
the foreign flags were removed at onee.

yesterday afternoon, Mrs. Samuel Cook left her
two children, aged tbree and four years, in the
house while she went to tbe grocery. On her

door found the four-year-old-boy, i Robert,
who was saying: "Don't cry, Charlie,
and I'll get ma." Entering the room she found
Charlie on the floor with a bullet wound in his
forehead. A Flobert rifle, belonging to an older
son. was in tbe room, but supposed to be out of

When Baby was sick, we gave her Castorla.
When aha was a Child, she cried for Castoria,
When she became Hiss, she clung to Castoria,
