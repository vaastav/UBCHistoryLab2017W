of $3,000. The di fciiM: wai (hat I lie ac

of the plaintiir or of a fellow wotkmnn,
and thai Mr. Ilowen was ii(t rotspouslblu
for it. In' charging the jury Judge
tipier raid if the plainliflT or a skilled
fellow workman were negligent, the
plaintiff could not recover duinages, but
if the agent of the defendant employed
persons not skilled lu their work, and
the accident occurred through the neg
lect of one of such persons, the defend
ant was responsible. An appeal was
taken from the Judgment but it was
affirmed.
MORE SXAP JUDGMENT.
By retcrence to the city council pro
ceedings it will be seen that an ordi
nance has been passed to provide for
gas in Emporia. We understand the ex
clusive privilege of furnishing gas was
granted for thirty years, at a price not
exceeding $3 50 per 1,000 teet. That we
must have gas soon is an admitted fact.
That there is any particular hurry about
It we do not see. Why the ordinance
was put through under a suspension
of the rules is a query. There has
been a little too much of that sort or
thing by the Emporia city council in
the past two years. When the water
works contract was let the same sort of
"snap judgment" was taken. A gentle
man was then present who asked a few
day's delay in order that n responsible
firm in Iowa might put In a bid on the
works. It was refused, and the contract
closed immediately on the single bid
that was offered. This may have been
best, but we make the assertion freely
that not a single member of the city
council would have done the business
that way if he bad been letting a con
tract for $30,000 or even 1,000 worth
of work for himself.
In' the case of this It as ordi
nance Mf'Vraton, it will be s-en,
wanted until next Thursday to investi
gate, and to gel information on the sub
ject from other cities. The courtesy and
right which ought never to be refused a
fellow member of such a body, espec
ially under such circumstances, wus de
nied him, and the ordinauce was passed
under a suspension of the rules. Sueh
hurried action on the part of a delibera
tive body, un'ess in case of public emer
gency, is not only as a rule Injurious lo
the public interests, but is always opeu
to suspicion. We understand that
the gentlemen composing the com.
puny live lure. This is of course pref
erable to putting the interests of the
'' inhabitants of the city for thirty years
into the hands of non-residents. - Hut we
do not sec the necessity of the baste
manifested by the council. No chance
was given to anybody else to say what
thev would d about furnishing gas. It
seems to us, too, that thirty years is an
unnecessarily long lease to give gas
company on the people of Emporia, no
difference who they are or where they
come from. No attempt was made to see
if the price could uot be fixed at a lower
limit than $3.50. If some process is dis
covered, lu this day of Invention in' tins
matter of light, by which we might get
gas at 2.00 per 1,000 feet, we will
have to keep ou paying the :l.S0 till the
end of thirty years, because nobody ever
heard of a gas company charging lei
than they were allowed to charge. Tho
ordinance la undoubtedly a good thing
for the gas company as gotal as they
asked fo.r but whether it is the best that
could be done for the people of the city
whose interests it It soiuet tines believed
council men are elected to protect and
look after, is another question. Perhaps,
as an Emporia councilman ouce said
when being remonstrated with by one of
the people on a question that ellectcd
the people, It is none of your d d bus
iness." All the people have to do is
to quietly submit. Their hands are tied
in the important matter of gas for thirty
years, and they have the consolation of
knowing that many of them will be dead
before the expirallou of that time, and
won't need gas.
We must simply -go it blind," as the
councllmen evidently did, and believe it
is all right and for the best. After fifty
years of experience with gas compaies,
and the difficulties almost every city in the
land have had with them, and with their
grasping, monopolizing ways, tho people
must co through the same mill and suf
fer the same toil, and all that without
anv seductive ovster supper in theirs.
Such are the wavs of a city council in
the tar west.

MORGAN S BILL.
The fact thut the Democrats in con
gress have let the time go by since the
trouble four years ago over the matter of
counting the electoral vote w ithout any
attempt to amend tin- manner of count
ing, so that such trouble should not
occur again, lias been the cause of much
surprise throughout the country. The
other fact that an attempt should just
now be made to push through a measure
known aa the "Morgan bill" arouses sus
picion. The announcement Friday in
our special telegrams that the Republi
cans had decided to light the measure
to the bitter end, but coniirms the belief
that there is mischief iu the Democratic
camp. An article in the Commonwealth
of December II, tells what the lorgan
measure is in the following statement:
It nrovides an entirely new method ol
counting and declaring the electoral
vote. Lnder the 2Zd joint rule, which
governed the proceedings of the joint
convention of the two houses for a num
ber of years prior to 1S70, the vote of the
two houses was necessary to reject the
electoral vote of a mate which wus dis
puted. The Morgan rule, which the
Demociats are attempting to pass.
places it within the power of either
house to reject the electoral vote of
a slate. . For instance, if one of the
members of the Kansas board of can
vassers had raised a technical objection
to the formality of the electoral vote of
this mute, and sent to the vice president
a paper ullcgiiig that Hancock wus en
titled to the vote of Kansas, it would be
competent for the house independent of
the senate to throw out the electoral vote
ot the stale. Whereat, under the
twenty-second Joint rule, the vote would
be counted as certified lo by the statu
iotHeers, tin lees the objnetion should lie
sustained by' the two houses acting
separately. The .Morgan rule uot only
proposes lo place it within the powerof a
partisan majority of ei'her house to de
feat Ihe popular will, bat to do it by a
resolution which doc not require the
approval of the president. Thus it is
proposed to enact a rule which would be
in Ine nature and have the effect of an act
of congress, w ithout submitting it for
executive approval, and yet section 7 of
article 1, of the constitution provides
that "every order, resolution or vote to
which the concurrence of the senate and
house of representatives may be neces
sary, except on a question of adjourn
ment, shall be presented to the president
of the United States aud before the same
shall tako effect shall lie approved by
him, or being disapproved by him, khail
be re-passed by two-thirds of the house
of representatives and senate, according
to the rules and limitations prescribed
iu the case of a bill."

RELATION OF PRAYER TO NATURAL
LAW.
A Ictnro Given at Sornul School, Sun
cluy. December C, I88O,
BT REV. RICHARD COBDLKT
The object of these lectures, as I under
stand it, is to bring before your
minds some ; of the general
truths of religion, not in any
sectarian aspect, or with any sec
tarian intent, but in such a way that
your education may include religious
truth, among the great departments of
thought to which you give attention.
You study the science of government
without any reference to partizan poli
tics, and with no thought or disturbing
your political affiliations.' It seems to
me eminently proper that you should
study religious truth in the same way,
without any thought of disturbing your
denominational affiliations.
The theme to which 1 would direct
your thought, is the relation of prayer
to nature. In this I make no attack on
sc ience. The pulpit, of all institutions,
should welcome light from every source.
Asa rule it docs, and wherever it does not,
it is false to its own idea; for truth k HI
stand and light will shine whencesoen r
they come. So we hold ourselves ready
to accept all established facts, in
whatever direction found. More than
tha:, we stand ready to modify auy of our
own theories, whenever they are found
to coifllict with uewly discovered facts
which have really beeu established.
But the theories aud opinions of scientific
men, are entitled to exactly the same con
sideralion which is due to the theories
and opinions of religious teachers and
no more. We study them with interest,
but ihey must wait till they are estab
lished by facts before any one can be
required to step out of their way.
We claim, however, that we have facts
ns well as they. There 'are facts in re
ligion as well ss in science; facta in
spirit as well as in matter; in the world
above us as well as that beneath us. And
wc claim further that a fact in the spirit
ual relation is as worthy of considcraf
tiou as a fact in material relation. It
matters not where a fact is found or how,
it deserves a place in every man's sys
tem of thought. An invisible fact is
just as solid as if it were of rock, and a
fact really found by your consciousness
isjustaswell established as -though it
were found by the blow pipe or solar
spectrum.
Prayer is one of the facts of the rt-
legious world, revealed in the conscious
yearning of the human soul, and in the
testimony of God through His word.
I present to you to-day the relation of
prayer to matter, not for its own sake
alone. It involves the principle of all
supernaturalism. The logic which
would rule out prayer from life, would
rule out the soul from man, and God
from the universe. The theory that
would shut God out ol his works so
that he cannot help his people, would
shut htm out from all the direct interest
in the world, or in its history, and would
be but one step from the entire blotting
out of his name and presence. When
you have blotted out prayer and God,
you have blotted out nil the grandest
hopes of mankind that hare sustained
them in hours of darkness and agony,
and have been the inspiration of all the
best things men have thought and done.
This then is the battle ground of
faith. It is well to know the scope of
the contest, and where we and our op
ponents part. Prayer, miracles and in
spiration are involved in this Uisscus
sion and depend on the same principles.
In discussing the relation ot prayer to
natural law, wc need, first of all, to liiake
a preliminary distinction. We need to
distinctly place before our minds and
keep it there, . that God is
separate from his works. We -do
not propose to prove christian
doctrine on skeptical grounds. If a man

further back. We part with such a man,
logically, loug- before we come to the
question of prayer. Our God is an in
dependent, separate being, entirely dis
tinct fom his works, tie existed De
fore creation. He exists now above it,
and would exist if it should perish. He
has not exhausted himself in what he
has done. He could duplicate creation
if it were wise. He can add to it. modi
fy it, or destroy it. He can add a world
or remove one. put in a new lorce, or
take out one now operating. There is
to bun an infinite reserve of povcr after
all his work is done. This is the Chris
tian conception of God, and wc must
keep it distinctly in mind in considering
the christian doctrine ot prayer, xou
will be surprised lo find how it clarifies
the whole subject, and what a flood of
light it throws upon it.
lhere is then no question of power.

they have a dilterent conception ol Uod
from this. I hey conceive or Uod as
identical wilh nature, and the power of
God as identical with the power of na
ture. They conceive of God as embod
ied in his works. Of course there can
be nothing supernatural under this
conception. There can be nothing above
nature it uod be nature ana nature be
God.
With all such ideas we take issue at
the outscL Our God is not to be con
founded with his works. He stands
above them all, controlling them all,
but not involved in them. Beyond all
he has made and done, be has infinite
power in reserve to add to to modify
to re-create or destroy, bo tne qucs-
tiou of prayer is a mere question of fact-
Concede to natural law all that is asked
for it, and there is still the infinite pow

through all his works, and penetrating
them through and through, lie can an

course his infinite intelligence hears all
prayer; his infinite heart sympathizes
with all prayer; and bis infinite power

question is "Does he ever do ttt" and
that is a matter of evidence and tepti-
mony. -
Cut the objector sun presses the
point in another line, and says:
'Uranlicg that uod has power, and
prayer can be answered, is not the evi
dence accumulating against the fact that
God ever does deviate from fixed law ?
Are we no, finding more and more, that
he accomplishes everything by establish
ed forces? Is not science continually
narrowing the circle of possible varia
tion, so that if it keeps on there will soon
be no room lett for prayer? One thing
after another is being remanded to the
realm of fixed law. Savages dread the
eclipse, and pray to be delivered from it;
but the time of its coming was known a
thousand years ago, and might

just as fined, only we cannot calculate
them so well. 1 ne shower is just as de

only these antecedents are more delicate
and various, and more dimcult to appro

I we could predict the storm just as well as

praying to have the eclipse delaved.
The same thing applies to the lightning.

It Is supposed by many that the star

On this theory, which many hold, the

suppose God planned the world to meet

needs of his people. A man wandered

but when he laid his ear upon the
ground he could distinctly hear the
trickling ol distant waters, the very
sound refreshed him, and hu ran toward
it and found a beautiful spring, and
drank, revived and lived. You could
never make that grateful man believe
that God did not answer his prayer, and
I believe his faith was nearer right than
the doubt of those who would rob him
of its comfort: But how could this be,
says one. That spring wa9 there a
thousand years before this man ever saw
it, and hundreds of thirsty travelers had
quenched their thirst with its living
waters. Yes, but God put it there, aud
he put it there on purpose to refresh the
thirsty souls who might come that way
and he had in mind this poor dying
man, and his eager prayer and its cool
ing waters expressed his sympathy and
love. When the time came and the
man lay there, parched and perishing
on the desert sand, God quickened his
ear to eatch the distant music of the
waters, and led him to the fountain that
lie might drink and live. You remem
ber when Hagar fainted in the desert,
that God opened her eyes and she taw a

so exclusively dependent o.i physical an
tecedents as is sometimes churned.
There is a very large margin of possible
variation. It is claimed, and claimed
with truth, that the researches ol" scieuce
put the domain of nature more and
more under the control of exact law. So
it is also truj that these same research
es widen more and more this margin of
possible variation. These two state
ments may seem contradictory, but
they are not, and I think I can show
you beyond a question they are both
true. Climate, for example, is found
more and more to be under fixed laws.
Its variations are uot freaks of nature,
but the result of definite causes. lis
chauges are being more and more ac
counted for, and can more and more
be predicted from observed antecedents.
But as we are learning the laws, we are
also learning how climate may lie iu
llucnccd. The planting of trees is in
creasing ihe rainfall of the prairies.
Ihey told me, in New Hampshire that
the streams aud springs were becoming
smaller, and some ol them drying up.
on account of the decreasing rain since
the trees had been cut from the moun
tains. It is suggested in France to reg-
l.ite climate at will by artificial appli
ances; for they say great fires bring
wind; firing guns brings rain; a great
battle is almost always followed by wind
and rain. It is also said that climate is
affected by the erection of buildings, cul
ti vat ing fields, the changing of water
courses. I hey told me tne other day at
Springfield, Mo., that the climate had
very perceptibly changed in that region
in the last twenty years. iney said it
was colder and stormier and more vari
able. They attribute it to the building
of railroads and telegraphs. You know
it is claimed with great confidence, that
the building ot the facific railway
has materially affected the climate of the
plains. It seems at first incredible that
two bands ot iron rouia anect the cli
mate of a nation. But we know a little
rod of iron will turn aside a thunder
bolt, and a number of them will some-
tim.es dissipate a thunder storm, and let it
pass harmlessly over us almost in silence
Storms, winds and rains are dependent
largely on delicate electric currents
which are easily disturbed. Now bands
of steel across the continent, or even a
telegraphic wire, might easily effect
these currents and turn the storm or
mold the season.
As we are learning. the laws ot nature
we are learning- to use them and turn
them. We are finding points where we
can touch their seciet springs. We
clean our streets and turn "away the pes
tilence; we drain our land and banish
the malaria; we put up a rod and divert
the lightning; we make the lightning
carry our messages, light our gas, ring
our bens, give all manner or alarms and
signals and do ail kinds or work.
1 bus tr can modify climate ; we can
attract or divert the storm ; we can
guide the thunder and use the lightning
we can ward on or invite the pestilence.

gitimate to ask : lithe tree acts ot men
can thus influence nature and produce
no shock in ber orderly movements, and
violate no law ot her operations, may
not the free acts of God do at least as
much ? Why may not he, at least a
well as we, touch tho springs of things
and modify results, without disturbing
tne puiars ot the woria, or breaking in
upon that order of nature which is the
stability of the universe.
There is no measuring the possibilities
in tils direction. Nature is full of the
most delicate agencies -which can be
swayed by a touch or stirred bv a breath.
There need be no violation of establish
ed law, no disturbance cf existing order.
uou neea uui toucu, as we do, Uicse del
icate agencies .which tnterweaved them
selves with the whole fabric of nature,
and there is no measuring Uie possibil
ities involved. We -are learning that
the most subtle tircea are mightiest.
The impenatrable, invisible forces of na
ture will at any time Tend and lilt her
solid substance as a giant might scat

the bones the strength of the body ; but
the hone are moved by the nerves a net
work in the system finer tbsn gossamer.
It used to be n. cumbrous thing to light
the lamps of a grit city. But now, a
little child may touch the electric keys,
and a thousand burners flush at once tor
mi les around. Air and earth and seas are
full of the most subtle forces which re-
spond to the genth st touch, and which
control me universe to wuicti they fitr-
nish the energy and the impulse.
These are all the servants of God
and
he dwells among them as a living pres
ence. He dwells among them, pene
trating all nature through and through.
With what infinite ease, he can touch
these springs of living force, aud ac
complish his will, and there be no sus
pension of law, no breaking of system,
no shock to order. Among all these
mighty forces, on whose border wc
dwell and whose faint impulse we feel,
God reigc-s a sovereign und a king.
We touch them here aud there, end at
tain our ends with ease ; he holds them
iu hand in complete supremacy. As in

so he stands among the forces he has
mr.de.. Here as in-Leaven, "His state

Q"t rest."
" 1 not misunderstand the aim 1 have
iu view. 1 nm not trying to show you
how God answers p'rayer, but rather
that the infinite God is uot straitened for
means to do his own will. I have dim
ply pointed out one. or two ways in
which it may be done without disturb
ing the order of nature. He who made
all things and fillet li ail things can cer
tainly fiud ways lo help his people. He
is not a prisoner in h:s own creation.
He is cot barred out from the work of
his own hands. He moves a kiug among
them nil. He says he hears the" cry of
the needy, and there is nothing science
has discovered which forbids Him to
help. He says he will not despise the
prayer of the deslute, and the exactness
of natural law wiii never say Him nay.
All that science makes tchown, leaves
room for the divine sympathy; all the
fixed order of nature" leaves space for
divine help.
Men have always prayed. Some oufe
has said: "There are moments of sad
ness and sorrow, of doubt and mystery ;
when a man feels his only refuge is
prayer, and science or no science, he
must pray." Shakespeare says: "At
their wits' end all men pray." It is a
universal iustiuct, a universal faith. It
is evident man was made to pray. If
there be no place for prayer, then his
structure is a cheat aud bis instincts
are a lie. As he thirsts foi water, his
soul thirsts for God. Was the instinct
planted Jn him to be mocked ? Did God
ever mock his creatures? Did he ever
send the lice out iulo fields where
no flowers bloom? Did he ever plant
cravings for which no supply was pro
vided? Has he taught men to come to
him iu trouble, only to cast them down
in despair? Has he taught them to cry
unto him iu prayer, and then mocked
them with a brazen sky? Are they to
yearn for God as lost children yearn" for
their mother, only that they may know
the agony of eternal orphanage? Are
they to cry out for a father when no
father hears them? It would be ihe
planting of a thirst with no water to
quench it; the creating of a hunger with
no food to satisfy" it. It would be the
darkest day the world had ever seen if
the proclamation should go forth that
men could pray no more.
Every one must concede that God hears
our prayers; for nil things arc naked aud
open to the eyes of him with whom we
have to do; all must concede that he
sympathizes with the distress and need
which wring our prayers from us; for,
like as a father piticth his children so
the Lord pilicth them that fear him; wc
all must concede that he holds the deli
cate but mighty forces of nature in hand
in absolute mastery and control, and so
is able to succor those who are tempted,
or those who are iu any way distressed.
Thus far iill agree who believe in God at
all. The only doubt is when we come
to the question, does he ever answer Ihe
prayer he hears? does he ever relieve
the distress he so tenderly feels for?
docs he ever use for men's help the
boundless power in his hand? Shall
we allow a doubtful logic to rob us of
the comfort of believing that he not only
is, but is a rewarder of them that dili
gently seek him? Shall we not rather
join "that vast multitude who have
obeyed their simpler aud better instincts
and" cry, "O, Thou that bearest prayer,
to Thee shall all tiesh come."
CHASED BY INDIANS.
During tire spring and summer of
1805 Co. E, lllh Kansas cavalry, was
stationed at Fort Lamed, Kansas. Theu
there were no towns or even settlements
west of Salina, and even it was ouly a
very small "infant." Company C of the
saine regiment was stationed at Fort
Dodge, some thirty miles farther west.
The supposed duty of these troops' was
to keep the Indians quiet and escort the
stage coach carrying the U. S. mail to
nd from stations cast and west of these
military posts. As the stage only paid
us a visit semi-oecasinnally there was a
good deal of time which would have
hung heavily on our hands but for the
fact that there were thousands' of buffalo,
which it was fine sport lo kill, espe-
ially as Uncle Samuel furnished good
horsts, good rccolvers and plenty of am
munition. And besides this, did not ev
ery buttalo we killed gain ior us an
agreeable respite from the usual rations
of "bacon and beans ?"
One fine ,Vring morning about thirty
of us. mounted and equipped, with a
following of two six-mule teams to haul
our camp hxtures and the meat we
might secure, started out on a grand
hunt. The majority of the company
were uew hands at the business, and the
first herd of buffalo wc sighted took the
alarm and started to run when we. were
more than a mile away. Wc didn't
know any belter thau to charge in a
liody and hoot and yell like a troop of
school boys the moment we caught sight
ot them.
It took a long run to get within reach
of them but the feat was performed at
last and every mother's son of us began
firing. Buffalo have stout ribs, and be
fore shedding their winter coats, very
woolly hides. We didn't know but that
a shot anywhere from the end of his nose
to the tip of his tail would bring a buff
alo to the ground in the shortest kind of
metre. And so we raced and yelled and
poured in volley after volley of random
shots and plowed great furrows along
the woolly side of the flying buffalo
until they began to scatter and each one
sought to secure his own safety by choos.
lug a route of his own. There fell to
my lot a huge shaggy fellow whose well
worn horns and slower pace denoted his
seniority. He didn't seem to care for
the company of his kind nor anything
else in fact but to run toward the wind
and fill my eyes and mouth and nostrils
with dust and gravel which his clatter
ing hoofs threw u:. I was too much ex.
cited to notice which way the others
weregoing or that they were not all fol
lowing the same course. I didnt get
that buffalo! If he lost a drop cf blood
I was none the wiser. He didn't seem
to run very fast, but be kept at it. He
tumbled head-long into ravines and
scrambled up steep placts and ran off
and left me! Then I sat still and watch
ed him. The great, ugly creature seem-
ed, in the distance, to be tumbling end
over eud until, a mile and a half away.
he slackened bis. pace, halted, faced
about and took a farewell look at his
late pursuer, and then leisurely trotted
off.
Then I began to look around for the
other hunters. 'Not a man in
sight." As far as the eye ' could
reach nothing but the appir.
ently level plain could be seen. It seem
ed almost impossible that man or beast
could be found within a hundred mile.
The sun seemed to bare lost his way and
persisted in sending his rays from the
far northwest. I was lost. If mj horse
had had no belter sense than myself
should certainly have gone in an oppo
site direction to that taken by the other
hunters. . I was so bewildered that I al
lowed my horse to have his will in
1 everything. He stood quietly for a few

moments then turned to the right and
seemed to be looking and listening.
When he had satisfied himself he started
at a brisk walk in the direction of the high
est point ot land to be seen anywhere. I
had ridden iu this way, perhaps, three or
four miles, nud the point, or elevation,
h.id taken a more definite shape, prov
ing to be, for that country, quite a hill,
running nearly parallel with my course.
As I rode on I could see, to the right,
another elevation, not so high.' Sudden
ly my horse threw up his head w ith
snort that frightened me by its sudden
ness, and nt the same instant I caught
sight of what I supposed was seven of
my fellow hunters. As they seemed to
be heading forthe same point as myself
I did not change my course or make any
signal to them. But what ailed my
horse? He sceniod to be getting
excited. He kept snuffing the nrr and
looking suspiciously in the direction of
the seven horsemen. My curiosity wis ,
aroused nud I looked sharply in the same
direction. Indians! I could see their
uaked bodies glistening in the sunlight.
They were nearer the point to which I
had been aiming thau I was. and, sup
posing that my company were beyond
that point somen here, were between me
and my reinforcements. As they neared
the elevation I saw that they were going
to pass on the side farthest from me,
while my own course would strike the 1
hill at its extreme northern point, I
was traveliug northeast, the hill stretch
ed away lo the north-northeast, and the
Indians were traveling north. I kept
steadily on my course, undecided what
to do, but having sen enougli to know
that my surest plan would be to begin
the race for life only when it was ihe
only chance.
I suppose that iheredskius were so
certain that I had not discovered who
they were and would ride right up lo
them befoie I made the discovery, that
they were well content to ride quietly
along to the northern limit of the hill,
aud, "cencealing themselves, await my
coming. Between the point where I
had first seen the Indians and that to
which I had been steering, I was glad
to fiud a laviue of sufficient depth to
conceal a horse, though his rider might
be seen. Down this ravine I turned my
horse's head, and the faithful beast, as if
aware of the part he was to act, went
down it like the wind, while I threw
myself forward and clasping my arms
around his neck, aa.d hooking my spur
under the saddle girth, let my body hang
on the side farthest from the Indians.
I had riddeu ia this way perhaps a
mile, and the vnvine began to zigzag
and threaten to lie an unsafe route over
which to ride at this headlong pace,
when a yell that made my blood chill in
my veins assured me that my attempt to
escape was discovered and my enemies
were in hot pursuit. Quick as a flash
ray horse sprang up tha bunk, and with
dilated nostrils and ears laid back, and
nose stretched forward, as if to present
the least possible front to the air, flew
like au arrow across the plains. I re
sumed my seat in the saddle, and began
to examine my revolvers. They were
all right twelve balls, calibre 41, and
three bunches more in my cartridge-box,
would be as many as I would be likely
to use. By the time they were gone my
seven pursuers would either get hurt or
be in a condition to hurt me.
Fast as my own horse was flying
along, there was one horse in the yelling
crew behind me that was gaining on me.
But as the only gun in the hands of my
pursuers was with the rear guard, I did
uot feel very much uneasiness about the
one swift horse, as I indulged the hope
of being able to cripple him iu two or
three shots, if he came close enough to
lie dangerous. I did not pound the
breath out of my horse with my heels
no need of that; he was doing his best.
A short neigh now and then told how
much he was interested in Ihe race.
But he was beginning lo fail. I could
tell by the labored breathing und the oc
casional snort, that the race must soon
terminate I began seriously to count the
cost of a sudden hall and making a
breastwork of the body of my faithful
horse, fight for my life. On came the
clling savages and the clatter of their
horses feet became more distinct every
movement.
Suddenly my cars caught the sound
of answering yells, aud I looked ahead
to sec what new danger I might be run
ning into. The next instant I turned in
my saddle and sent back a yell of defi
ance to my putsuers. I had seen my
friends some fifteen or twenty stroug fly
ing to my rescue. As they came nearer
I halted and leaping from the saddle fir
ed upon the savage nearest me. Quick
as a flash he disappeared on the oppo
site side of his horse which had sudden
ly turned to one side and then the whole
pack went scouring away followed by
the "boys in blue," who had so oppor
tunely come to my assistance. Three
out of the seven made their escape. Tb
others were shot down and their bodies
left where they had fallen, to be devoured
by wolves or recovered by their friends.
We rode into camp where I found my
self a hero of the orthodox order. But
1 never got lost from my comrades again
and never allowed myself to run into
any more such dangers. Private.-
THE TROUBLE THAT FOLLOWS
SPECULATING IN STOCKS.
' The Sew York correspondent of the
Boston Herald, writing of recent man
ipulations in the stock market, narrates
the following to show the ups and
downs in this case a terrible precidita
tion of Wall street:
Leaning against a counter of a Broad
street saloon, and nibbling the cracker
and cheese on the free lunch platter,
yesterday afternoon, stood a sad faced
man or oo or 70 years- lie wore a queer
kind of a fur trimmed cap, ill suited to

He used to be the president of the New

worth $9,000,000.
I refused to believe this and said so.
My friend dragged me over to the old
man and said :
"Uuncle John, here's a gentleman who
refuses to believe yoa were worth $9,000,-

"But I was, and possibly more than
that." answered the old gentleman;
"and here I am getting a free lunch with

"Why didnt you take half of It and
put it away?"
"Because," was my friend's response,
"I thought I could use it to a better ad

"That's the reason I didn't save any

Three Prisoners Ivill.-il by an Insane Devil.
tvr. Louis, Dec. 7. Information of a
most horrible tripplu murder, commit
ted by an insane man this morning near
Chester, Illinois, was received here to
night. It appears that a young man
twenty six years of age, named Louis
locksty, living a short distance from
Chester, became insane a few days ago,
from religious excitement. Yesterday
he was taken before the court by a dep-
I T . .1 : i , J . ,

in charge f two guards to lie taken to
the asylum ut Jacksonville. The guards
took the man to a hotel in town, und re
mained with him all night. About six
o'clock this morning he called for water
to wash himself. One of the guards
brought him some in a basin which he
took aud immediately flung it into the
guard's face. He theu dashed through
the window of the room and ran down
a road leading out into the country,
blood streaming lrom his face and hands
from cuts made by the broken glass.
About a quarter-mile from town is the
house of Thomas Ryan, an old
man of sixty-eight years, with whom
lived his widowed daughter, Mrs.
Smith, and her little girl of
twelve and a boy still younger.
Arriving at this house, Tocksty, who had
stripped himself naked on the road.
preached wildly and ordered the inmates
to kneel down and pray, baying they had
but fifteen minutes more to live. Tbey
all obeyed but the little boy, who es
caped from tlin house and rai to the
neighbors and gave the alarm. When
friends arrived on the scene they found
Ryan and Mrs. Smith dead, with their
skulls mashed in with an axe, and the
little girl lying headless on the floor.
The maniac having chopped thechild's
head completely oil, ond having finished
his bloody work at this placp, he seized
the bleeding head of the innocent child
by its long hair, and swinging it over
nis own bead, be dashed down the road.
He stopped at the house of Dr. Gordon
and entering he found only the servant
girl. He ordered her, as he bad the Ry
an family, to kneel and pray. The girl
screamed, which brought a hired man
from the stable, and Dr. Gordon ap
peared at the same time. After a fierce
and desperate struggle, they overpower-
ed and bound him with a rope. He was
then taken .to Chester, ' his wounds
dressed, and placed in charge of persons
who brought him to East St. Louis to
night, aud took him thence to Jackson-
ville asylum.
A Bad Day for Tammany Kelly Steps Down.
Jhew lORK, Dec. 10. it was given
o it, and generally believed, that the
anti-Tammany members of the board
had formed an alliance with the Repub
licans, whereby a sufficient number of
votes would be secured to confirm the
action of Mayor Cooper. A large
force of police was needed to keep the
crowd la order, and keep tree the ap
proaches to the chamber or the board,
which was crowded with interested people
from an early hour. Promptly nt noon
the meeting was called to order, and
soon thereafter a communication from
the mayor was read, nominating Allen
Campbell for comptroller in place of
John Kelly, whose term of office expired
1 uesday last. A republican at
derman moved to confirm, and
Tammany alderman, offered an amend
ment to refer the nomination to a com
mittee. A long debate followed, and the
amendment was lost by nine affirmative
to twelve negative- votes. The motion to
confirm was then taken up, and an ex
citing discussion took place. When the
vote was taken it resulted for confirma
tion by thirteen against eight, and Allen
Campbell succeeds John Kelly as comp
troller. Every one now felt that the en
tire ticket would be approved. The
confirmation rapidly followed of Wm. C.

per cen?. lias given rise to all sorts ol
rumors in Wall street as to a chance of
control at the annual election in March.
There is a strong impression .that the

and perhaps Mr. Vanderbilt have some
thing to Io with it. We have heard
that Mr. Gould and his New England
colleagues in the Union Pacific manage
ment arc not altogether in accord as to
the policy of increasing the connections
anu responsibilities ot tbc company
with the southwest and Texas, and it is
possible Uoulu has concluded to sell out.
Another reason for a chance is that the
