PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.)
Time Not Ripe for Intervention
in Cuban Affairs.
Work of the Various Departments Re
views—Tariff and Revenue.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 7.—The fob
lowing is the message submitted by Presi
dent Cleveland at the opening of Con
gress:
"To the ('.ingress of the United States:
As representatives of iho people iu the !
legislative branch of their government, you |
have assembled at a time witen the strength
ana exee.lenee of our fret* Institutions and
Uu* illness of .mr citizens to enjoy popular
rate have been again made manifest. A
political contest, involving momentous con
sequences, fraught with feverish apprehen
sion, and creating aggressiveness so intense
as to approach bitterness and passion, lias
been waged through our land, and deter
mined by the decree of free and indepen
dent suffrage, without disturbance of our
tranquillity or the least sign of weakness
in our national structure.
"When we consider iliese Incidents and
contemplate tin* peaceful obedience and
manly submission which have succeeded a
heated clash of political opinions, we dis
cover abundant evidem o of a determination
on tlie pan of onr countrymen to abide by
every verdict of the popular will, and to
be control.ed tit a.I times l.v an abiding
fnith in the agencies estab.ished for tin*
direction of the affairs of their government. :
“Tims onr prop e exhibit a patriotic dis
position which entities them to demand of
those who undertake to make aid execute
their laws sn.-h faithful and unselfish sen- j
be in their behalf as can only be prompted
by a serious appreciation of'the trust and j
confidence which the acceptance of public
duty invites.”
The Turkish Troubles.
The President then expresses his regret
at the unimproved condition of affairs in
Turkey. While he says no citizens of the
Untied Slates in Turkey have tints far
been killed or wounded, their safety in
future is by no means assured. Kfforts
have not been spared am! will not be. by
the government or the i uited States min
ister at Constantinople, to protect onr mis
sionaries on Ottoman territory. "But.” .
says the President "the deep feeling and
sympathy that havi* been aroused among l
our people ought not to so far blind their
reason and judgment as to lead them to
demand impossible tilings.” An adequate ;
force for protect ion w ould, lie adds, be re- '•
Rented by both Turkey and the powers.
Nothing will he omitted to bring about the 1
prompt settlement of the e aims for de
struction of missionary properly at liar- i
poot and Maras:., Hope is expressed that
no obstacle will in future in* interposed to
prevent the escape from Turkey of all
those who seek b> avoid the perils which j
threaten there and that the present som- |
her prospect In Turkey will not long be ;
permitted to offend the sight of Christen
dom.
The Cuban Situation.
Considerable space is given to Cuba. The
President litiils : and Ilietilt to
any progress lias thus far been made to
■ : Not
withstanding Spain’s strengthened deter
mination tu put down tlu* insurrection,
“there is tiiu. ii reason to believe that the
Insurgents have gained in point of numbers
and character and resources and are none
the less inflexible in their resolve not to
succumb without praeti.-aily securing the!
great objects for which they look up arms, i
tf Spain ha. not yet re -estab.ished her au
thority. neither have the insurgents yet
made their title to tu* regarded as an inde
pendent state. The on ■ civil government
maintained is that by Spain more or less
imperfect y. in the large towns and their
immediate suburbs.
"It is report.*.!, indeed." the President
proceed >. "on reliable authority, that at the
demand from the . oinmander-iti-eliief of
the Insnrg.'ii! army the putative Cuban gov
ernment lias now given up ail attempt to
exereis. Its fnmtions leawi.g that govern
ment i infessediv (what there is the best
reason f.r s tpposlng it always to have 1

At • of the Span- i

tin- President points ..nt Mat then* is
hardly a limit (*> the time hostilities may
lie i>ro onged, and ihe Spanish authorities
seem to li ,\ e imitated the insurgents in
policy of uli a . aiintitii.it ten of property.
that it may not i.e used by tbeir oppoaiqus.

Besides Cuban residents in tins country,
many of timm n.il ira ;;:ed. promote insnr
reeiion l.v means \\ lijeli tile laws and the
spirit of ..nr Instii nt ions cannot reach and
American citizens expre-s iindr sympathy in
many snlistantiai ways, thus necessitating
constant claims by tins miry fur protec
tion of its citizens and f>f damages now

insurgents, the recognition of their inde
pendence. tin* purchase by the United
States of tin* is and or tin* intervention
of the initial Slates to end Ihe strife, even
at tl.e cost of war with Spain, tire all ii:s
<atssi'd l.y the ITesident The restraint and
patient endurance of tin* United States un
der the conditions in Cuba an pointed onr.
as wed as the respect and regard for Spain
thus manifested by tin* American people.
Finally, the Pie- .lent suggests *Tt would
seem that if Spain should oflVr to Cuba
genuine autonomy a i . ..sure of homo rule,
which, while preserving the sovereignly of
Spain, would satisfy ail rational require
ments of her Spanish subject- there slum and
le no just reason why the i.aeilieation of
rite island might not In* effected on that
basts. Such a resolution would appear to
bo In the true interest of a t cmmemi'.!.
ll would at once stop the effect which is
now consuming the r. sources of the island
and making it worthless for whichever
party may ultimately prevail. It woubl
keep Intact the possessions of Spain with
out touching her honor, w lib h will lie eon
suited rattier than Impugned by the ade
quate redress of admitted grievances. It
won and put the prosperity of the island and
the fortunes of its inhabitants within their
own control without -cv.-rrng the natural
and ancient ties which bind timm to the
mother country and would jet enab’e them
to test their capacity for self government
under tin* most favorabb* conditions. It
has been objected on tin; one side that
Spain should not prom’se autonomy until
her insurgent snbj. . :> ’ay down arms; on
the other side ti.at promise.! autonomy,
however liberal, ks iiisutticieut. because
without assurance of the promise I.ring fib

"But the reasonableness of a n'qniremenf
by Spain of an unconditional surrender .>n

has degenerated into a strife which means
nothing more useless sacrifice of hu-

' eiieznela and tl.e Seal Ouestion.
Tin- closing of Ihe Venezuelan question
and the far advance with the promise of an
early successful consummation of negotia
tions for a general arbitration treaty with
Breat Britain for the better preservation of
seal life iu Behring sea Is expressed.
Treasury ami Other Departments.
The statistics from the treasury depart
ment including tln.-e of the revenues are
submitted without comeut or recommenda
tion. The same is true of The statistics of
immigration. The progress iu coast de
fense is alluded to as the one form of mili
tary preparation essentially pacific in its
nature. Summaries of the reports of the
attorney-general and Ihe postmaster-general
are included. The postonicc deficit due to
"carrying at the nominal rate of 1 cent a
•seri raries, sometlutes Includ
ing trashy and even harmful literature and
other matter which under the loose inter
pretation of a loose statute has been grad
ually given second-class rates” is pointed
out as an abuse that should be corrected. 1
An adequate appropriation for the enter
tainment of the international postal union
congress in Washington is recommended.
In affairs of llm navy and interior depart
ments, there is nothing in the message not
contained in the reports of the sechetarics.
'f the pension commissioner’s report, the
President says; "In my opinion, based
upon such statements as these and much
other information and observation, the
abuses which hate been allowed to creep
into onr pension system have done incalcula
ble harm in demoralizing our people and .
undermining good citizenship.”
The President urges the importance of
an adjustment r.f pacific railroad obliga
tions. of the case of the Union Pacific he
points out that proceedings to foreclose a
first mortgage upon added pa ns of the main )
line to which the government lieu is subor
dinate and Ibe default occurring on January
1, IS'.'T. must emphasize the mandate of the j
act of Isst to foreclose. “Therefore, un
less Congress shall otherwise direct or shall J
have previously determined upon a differ
ent solution of the problem, there will
hardly appear to exist any reason for de
laying beyond the date of the default above
mentioned such executive action as will
promise to subserve the public Interests and
save the government from the loss threat
ened by further inaction.”
The work done by the agricultural depart
ment is especially commended, but the
discontinuanee of the gratuitous distribu- 1
ti.>n of seeds is urged.
The progress of civil service reform for
the year Is reviewed as a cause for the ut
most congi itula 1 in. The amendment of
the interstate commerce act is recommend
ed.
Tl.e Tail(T.
Recurring again to the statistics of the
treasury department the President offers
soin'.' suggestions regarding the present
He says
“Whatever may bi' its shortcoming as a
short measure of tariff reform, it must be
...needed that ll lias opened a way to a
freer and greater exchange of commodities
between us and other c.iintries and thus
furnisl.eil a wilier market for ..nr products j
and mark.J- Pont inning, the President
s.ivs. *1 believe our present tariff law, if
allowed a fair opportunity, will in the ni'nr ,
future include a revenim which with reason- !
aide ee.momie expenditures will overcome |
all deficiencies. In the meantime, no deficit |
that has occurred or may oia ur. need e,\eite ,
or disturb us To meet any su.-h deficit, j
we have in the treasury in addition to a ;
g.a.l reserve of one hundred millions, a sur
plus of more than one hundred and twenty- ]
eight millions of dollars, applicable to the
pavment of the expenses of the government
anil which must, unless expended for that
purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if not ,
exn ■ ntly wasted, must in any event lie
pervi'rle I from Tin nnvposes of its exaction .
from tli ■ pi ople. Ihe payment, therefore,
of a.iv deficiency in till' revenue from lids
fund 'is nothing' nmre Mian i's proper and 1
li-gitimate use. The goveriiini'iit lima ap
piving a surplus fortunately in its treasury
to' .hi* payment of expenses not met by its
current revenues, is not at all to lie llkmied
to a man living b.-yond his income and thus
incurring debt or encroaching upon his
principal.”
l avors Retirement of Creeiibai ks.
The President renews his former recom
mendation for tin' retirement of the green
backs. "I am tu..re I'onviiued than pvt
that we can have no assuri*d financial pi*aee
an 1 safety until the government obligations,
which gold may be demandi'd from the treas
ury', are withdrawn from circulation anil
eaiii'i'led This might be done, as lias been
heretofori' i eeoinnii'lided. by their exchange
f,,r long li'nn bonds hearing a low rate of
interest or by their redemption with the
proceeds of sneii bonds.
■ liven if the United States notes known
as greenbacks were tints retired, it is prob
able that the treasury notes issued in pay
ment "f silviT pur. liases under the act of
Jniv 1 I. IS<in now paid on the gold when
demandi'd. would not create much disturb
ance as Mey might from time to time
when received iu the treasury department
l.v Mn* redemption In gold or otherwise, be
gradually and prudently replaced by silver
roin.
■■ this p’ in of issuing bonds for the pur
lin-..* of redemption certainly appears t*> bo
Mn* iiM.-i effective and direct path to the
needed reform In defau't of this, how
ever it would be a step in Ihe right di
rection if e.trrei.ev obligations redeemable
in gold w henever so redeemed, shoe and be
canceled instead of being reissued. This
operation would be a slow remedy, but it
would improve present conditions.
••National banks should redeem their own
notes. Thev should be allowed to issue etr
• illation to'the par value of bonds depos
ited as security for its redemption and the
t ix on their circulation should he reduced
to’one-for.rth of 1 per cent.”
The livil of Trusts and Monopolies.
'l iie message concludes as f■. lows:

st ‘
redtn'iion of prices to the people is not

‘•ln concluding this communication. Its last
words shall be an appeal to the Congress .
for the most rigid economy in the expend!- j
tore of the money It holds in trust for |
the people. Tlie way to perplexing extrava
gance is easy, but a return to fruga ity is
difficult. 'When, however, it is considered
that those who bear the burdens of taxa
tion have no guaranty of honest care save i
in the fidelity of their public servants, the i
duty of all possible retrenchment is plainly !
manifest.
“When onr differences are forgotten and
our contests of political opinion are no long
er remembered, nothing in the retrospect of
our public service will be as fortunate, as
comforting ns the recollection of official
duty well performed and the memory of a
constant devotion to tho Interests of our
confiding fellow countrymen.

Washington. D. C.. Dec. 7.—Tin* Sen
ate chamber was a center of interest
long before the hour for assembling had
arrived and by 11 o'clock the public gal
leries were filled and crowds wen* tit the

Iniian Pamieefote, accompanied by mem
bers of his staff, a ltd several members of
the diplomatic corps were in the gallery
reserved for foreign representatives and
with them were several ladies bearing
cards from Secretary Olney.
Exactly at 1J o’clock the vice-president
entered the chamber, ami going to the
desk of the presiding officer, gave a tap
which brought the Senate to order while
the blind chaplain. Hev. Dr. Milbnrn,
delivered an impressive invocation.
The chaplain relerred feelingly to th\
illness of Mr. Allis.m and besought hi
speedy restoration to health. He spokp
of the recent exciting political contest
through which the country had passed;
marked, lie said, hy a freedom from
much of the rancor and scandal of for
mer years and by a quick and calm ac
ceptance of the results by the whole na
tion. Bene.- with all nat ns, pi
to onr industries and the upbuilding of
all onr people in the grand brotherhood
of American citizenship were eloquently
invoked.
The call showed seventy senators pres
ent.

ognition. and his resolution that the
Hons.* of Representatives lie notified that

Mr. Sherman made the customary mo
tion for a committee of senators and
members to wait upon the President,
and upon its adoption the presiding officer

suggest anything in the nature of legisla
tive business hy presenting several pi -

Mr. Hoar's suggestion that till business
be deferred, as a matter of courtesy,
until the President and House of Rep
resentatives , had been communicated
with, and thereupon at PJ lb the Senate
took a recess until 1 o'clock.
Secretary !' tin* white house
staff immediately supped forward, mes
sage in hand, and made tin* forma, an
nouncement of a communication from
the President. It was taken to the pre
siding ollieer’s desk, where the seal was
broken and therenion Hen. Pox. scen

Welcome to Speaker Reed floral Trib
utes to Ex-Speaker Crisp.
Washington. D. P.. Dee. 7. The
House presented a very animated scene
for an hour before Speaker It* **d ap
peared. The galleries to w hich the pub
lic were admitted without cards were
crowded to tin* doors before 11 o'clock,
while the hails were jammed with those
unable to gain entrance. The rescued
galleries filled more si >wly. hut before
U o'clock were brightened with lb*
handsome gowns of fair women.
But in the midst of this general re
joicing there was an air of sadness as
members glanced at the black pall of the
late ex Speaker Prisp. <Mi it were some
cut flowers, his portrait in flu* rear of
the House a Iso being w real bed with .alia
lilies. The ex Speaker's death >ast a
shadow over the whole Hons,* and was
especially apparent on the Democratic
side, w here his loss w ill bo so keenly
fell.

Looks Like an Ordinary t ricycle, ,
but a Small Gas Motor
Does the Work.
An ingenious automobile chair ha> I•• *t.*n
invented which is designed t** take tin
place of the hansom <*ab. It vviil reduce \
rates ami bring the luxury of a private j
conveyance within reach of any family. !
i: iii
venter of the new chair, an I be leels i
confident that his graceful vehicle will j
work a revolution in the matter of trans j
portatkm about the city.
The principle of this latest convey atm- I
is a trieyeh inn by a gasundor concealed |
beneath the passenger’s seat. It can be i
propelled, guided, speeded, and revi rsed j
at will by its penitmx who is s.ale.l di 1
reetly over the single, nar ehahtless j
driving wheel supported * u an ur.iinary j
cycle diamond frame v.tiieb is eapaMe ot j
being converted into a lady’s and; *p frame j
at a moment’s notice.
The and. signer at Hi st intended bis chair j
carriage for wedded couples who enjoy
the delights of bicycle riding, but find
many disadvantages and inconveniences
connected with the silent steed. The
passenger's si at is directly in front, but
somewhat lower than the seat occupied
by the operator. It is supplied with a
shifting top. like that "I an ordinary bug
gy. which may be raised to protect the
occupant from sun or rain.
Beneath the passenger's seat i< a <oti
tinously running motor, which having
once been stal led for the day, n* ed not
be stopped or reversed unless desired.
Tbe lever by means of which the ve
hide is controlled, is located ui">t con
veniently in front of tin* seat and over
the rear driving wheel. By moving tbi
lever from its vertical position t*> the
right or left across the surface ef a
speed indicator, the vehicle is run for
ward or backward at any speed, from
one to fifteen miles aii hour. The tricy
cle automobib is t<> be manufactured in
various sizes, the smaller ones being de
signed especially for use as an outdoor
motor chair for invalids, children, phy
sicians. and for home us.* generally.
The larger ones are to be constructed
with low seats, and these are intended
to entirely dispbu e tbe ordinary Iv.
vvhei I bans mi. These large antomobiles
vvill have either a permanent **r a shift
ing top. with the customary folding front.
They will also Ie fitted up with a cy
clometer clock, placed in front of the
operator, which vviil indicate the inil* ■
and tenth of miles covered, and keep the
cyclometer traveling while the cabbie i
awailing the return ut bis “fare" dining j
a call. These hansom motor e.-i!*-. '
equipped with the cyclometer eloel-.s. will !
(litis indicate the actual distance traveled |
and will solve the question of cheap and
honest cab service.
Tin* pleasure chair is preferable to tin*
hansom not only on account of its cheap
ness. but also because of its greater safe
ty. Before many weeks, tbe invent.*:
says, it will be in use on the streets of
New York. In appearance it will re
seiilble the phaeton, the greatest differ
ence of course, being in the running gear.
