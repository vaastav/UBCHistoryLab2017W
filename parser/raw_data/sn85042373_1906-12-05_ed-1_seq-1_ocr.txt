Accused Wept and Sobbed Convul
sively ffkei Prosecuting Attorney
Delivered His Charge to the Jury—
Gillette Stated He Did Not Expect
the Verdict Rendered.
Preaa to The ETealas Ttaea.
Herkimer, N. T., Dec. 5.—The jury
in Che trial of Cheater Gillette for the
murder of MB sweetheart, Grace
Brown, at Big Moose lake on July last,
hust night returned a verdict of guilty
in the first degree.
Sentence will be pronounced on
Thursday morning to which time the
court adjourned after the jury had re
ported. Former Senator Mills, Gil
lette's counsel, before adjournment,
stated that when court reconvened at
10 o'click Thursday morning, he
would move to have the verdict set
aside.
DCIIICMM
Five Hows.
The Jury, which had deliberated for
five hours, sent word at 11 o'clock
that a verdict had been Teached. A
moment later they filed into the court
room and at 11:45 o'clock an officer
whb had been'sent for GHlette, re
turned with the prisoner.
OUlette Vnwni.
Pale and a trifle nervous, apparent
ly, Gillette faced the' jury and when
Marshal! Hatch, the foreman, declar
ed that a verdict o{ guilty la the first
degree had been round, the prisoner
gave no sign of emotion. A few sec
onds later when Jiis counsel had an
nounced his purpose of making for
mal motion that the verdict hie set
•side and (be judge was dismissing
the jurors, Gillette bent over a nearby
table and, (ricking up a pencil, wrote
something upon a sheet of paper. He
then folded the paper carefully and
placed it in his pocket Immediately
afterward he was taken from the
court room back to his cell in the Jail.
It was learned that the jury had
some difficulty in reaching an agree
ment and that six ballots were taken
before the twelve men agreed. Up to
that time the jury stood, eleven for
conviction and one for acquittal.
The under-sheriff took Gillette back
to the Jail and as soon as he entered
his cell he prepared hurriedly tor bed.
"When the reporters want to see
me," he said to Sheriff Richards, "tell
them I havenothing to say only I did
not expect that verdict."
The jury, it was stated, would have
reached ltd verdict quickly had It not
been for one juror who thought Grace
Brown was a suicide. The other
eleven argued against the theory he
had termed and ballot after ballot was
taken until finally,' on the sixth ballot
the Jury agreed.
The case of the state against Ches
ter GHlette, charged with the murder
of Grace Brown, was given to the jury
at 5:50 o'clock, after Judge Deven
dorf had occupied an hour and fifteen
minutes in his charge.
Gillette CiM
Hie day's session, until the judge
charged the jury, was taken up by
District Attorney Ward, who describ
ed the friendship of Gillette and Grace
Brown and their companionship up to
the time of the girl's death. For the
first time during the trial the prison
er brbke down as he was mercilessly
scored by the prosecutor. When the
latter read abstracts from letters sent
Gillette by his sweetheart, Gillattq
cried and at times throughout the re
mainder of the session' sobbed con
vulsively. When the jury went to Its
room and Gillette was led back to his
cell he asked a deputy: "Are doors
all locked, Sheriff?"
JaSse'a Charge.
In his charge Judge Devendorf said.
"To all concerned this case is of
great importance. You have no right
to be Influenced or controlled by any
thing but evidence as it has been pre
sented to you and the law governing
it as given to you by the court. You
have no right to permit either sym
pathy or favor with one or the other
party to sway your judgment. None
of us was present on the 11th of July
when it Is said this crime occurred.
The evidence that Grace Brown lost
her life at Big Moose lake admits of
no doubt. But there Is no testimony
on the part of people as to eye wit
ness as to what occurred at the fatal
moment, other than the defendant, to
detail the last scene in the alleged
tragedy. But all evidence is mere or
less circumstantial whether consisting
of facts which permit inference of
guilt or whether given by an eye wit
ness."
"Gentlemen, the evidence is not to
be discredited or decricd because it is
circumstantial, it may be more reli
able evidence than direct evidence.
"Something has been said with ref
erence to the motive. Proof of motive
of a crime Is not Indispensable or es
sential" to conviction. While a mo­
tive may be shown as a circumstance
to aid in fixing a crime, yet the peo
ple are not required to prove a mo
tive. The motive In this case is said
by the people to be because of the
relations that existed between this
man and the girl. Now whether the
situation in which he was placed fur
nished a motive sufficient for him to
commit the crime rests with the jury
to say.
"I say to you, gentlemen, that J,
know of no law, In fact, there is no
law, that requires that a defendant
should be present at the autopsy or
that he should be represented. He
has no particular right to be present
In fact, be cannot be expected to be
a witness. This is not an issue In the
case and is not to be considered.
"It was further said by one of the
counsel that if the evidence of graft
in.Herkimer county could be investi
gated the first thing he would Investi
gate in that regard would be that of
the physicians. If there is any graft
going on in Herkimer county that
should be presented to the court in
the proper time and in the proper
place. Undoubtedly, the physicians
called would be paid by the county
for their services, the same as pll the
other officials the same as the de
fendant's counsel."
The judge then touched 09 the
question of the crime and later said:
"If the jury finds that Grace Brown
jumped overboard voluntarily and the
defendant made no attempt to rescue
her, that does not made him guilty."
The jury retired immediately after
the charge was concluded.
Berlin Surgeon Grafts Toe to
Replace Thumb Accident
ally Ont Off.
AagMtated
Preaa (iUe to The Enilii
Berlin, Dec. 6.—One of the most
remarkable operations in the annals
of modern surgery haB been success
fully performed in Berlin. The person
upon whom the operation was perform
ed was a youth who had suffered the
loss of his right thumb through an
accident with a chan cutting machine.
To replace the missing member it
was decided to amputate the big toe
and graft it on the stump. For seven
teen days the patient was made to lie
in a bent position, with the thumb
joined to the partly removed toe In
plaster spllns, an ordeal which the suf
ferer heroically supported. The flesh
having in that period grown together,
it was then possible to sever the toe
fiom the toe entirely. After four
months' time the healing process was
complete, and now the patient posses
ses a new thumb that can be barely
distinguished in appearance from the
real member and is almot as useful.

Washington, Dec. 5.—While the gov
ernment has been zealous in fighting
rebates and freight discriminations on
land, It has not touched the case of
such rebates and discriminations In the
over sea trade, except as applied to
through freight from the interior
points. If the owners of a foreign
vessel wish to grant a rebate to a
shipper, or to charge one shipper a
higher rate than another, what Is to
prevent them? Incidentally, as the
majority of the vessels now carrying
cur commerce now fly the British,
French or German flag, It Is reason
able to suppose that rebates or dis
criminations would be in favor of the
English, German or French shipper
rather than the American. But if we
had a merchant marine of our own,
built up under the fostering care of
the government, It could be regulated
as easily as the railroads, or more so.
As It Is the American shippers are
absolutely at the mercy of foreign
owners.

ELECTION OF
Several Hundred Delegates
Gathered Today at Des
Moines, Iowa.
TO DISGIIIS REIMS OF
BMII6III6 MOOT CHOICE
Of Senators by a Direct Tote of the
People—Sentiment in Favor* More
Deeply Grounded In South Than in
North—Reform Will Take Ten
Years to Accomplish.
Aaaoelated Preaa to The Breilac Ttaea.
Des Moines, Iowa, Dec. 6.—Several
hundred delegates, appointed by the
governors of a majority of the states
of the union, all men of earnest
thought, devoted to the best interests
of the country, have gathered In this
city to discuss means of bringing about
the election of United States senators
by direct vote.
Governor Cummins, acting in pur
suance of a resolution adopted by the
last Beslson of the Iowa general as
sembly issued the call for the confer
ence, the stated purpose being to ex
change ideas and to recommend in
formally some solution of the problem.
The conference has attracted much
attention as it Is the first effort to
organize the sentiment already exist
ing in favor of the popular election of
senators. That this sentiment Is stead
ily growing to evidenced by the action
of a large number of states during the
past year in selecting their candidates
for the United 8tates senate by popu
ular vote of the members of the party,
expressed to them In primary elections.
Eleven southsni states followed this
'fggrndnringthe past summer. These
states were: Arkansas, Alabama, Flor
ida, Kentucky, Georgia, Louisiana,
South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Texas and Virginia.
Although the sentiment for popular
election of senators appears to be
more deeply grounded in the southern
states than in other parts of the coun
try the Idea has gathered weight In the
north and west In states that have been
generally considered fighting territory
for both parties. Illinois recently held
a primary for the election of a senator,
and the party conventions of Iowa and
Wisconsin have declared in favor of the
method. In Vermont and New Hamp
shire the agitation for the proposed
reform has gained considerable head
way.
About the only thing the present con
ference can achieve is to affect an
organization which may crystallze the
sentiment and give the movement such
an impetus that the desired-amendment
may be obtained by one or the other
methods fixed by the constitution.
It is the general opinion among
those present that ten years at least
will be necessary to accomplish the
proposed reform. There are two ways
of getting an amendment .before the
people for vote. Congress can act on
its own Initiative in submitting an
amendment to popular vote or it may
be compelled to do so upon the demand
of two thirds of the state legislatures.
The question must then be voted upon
at a general election.
On several occasions the lower hqnse
of congress has passed the desired
resolution, but the senate has Invar
iably killed it Many of the foremost
opponents of the measure are no long-

may be divided into three nearly equal
parts. The first is the International
Mercantile Marine company, which
some insist will hog most of the ben
fit of the ship subsidy bill, and which
Is popularly believed to be an Amer
ican concern because It was organized
by J. Plerpont Morgan. It Is American
in the sense that about half Its stocks
and boitds are held In this country.
Otherwise it is foreign, for of its 130
vessels 120 fly the flag of Great Britain
or Belgium. Its president, who UveB

may be a combination, but It Is in no
sense a "trust," nor has it anything
like a monopoly, in view of the fact
that it Includes only one-third of the
trans-atlantlc shipping. So far as pro
fiting by the shipping bill is concerned,
Mr. Morgan's combination would have
a. hard time getting its feet in the
trough, for the reason that it has bound
Itself by a formal contract with the
British admiralty to keep its vessels
beneath the British flag, and to officer
and man them with British subjects.

Another third of the shipping is con

the North German Lloyd and the Ham
burg-American. These lines have a
working agreement. The remainder Is
made up of the Gunard, French and
other lines. If these ships were to be
transferred to American registry they
would have to abandon the subsidies
they now receive and give up many
advantages they now enjoy, Including
cheap labor. Moreover the American
subsidies proposed are not for lines
to Europe, but to South America, South
Africa, Asia, etc., and they would have
to leave a profitable trade to establish
new lines. But supposing these foreign
ships would forego all their present
advantages to take out American reg
ister, what chance would they have?

The case attracted considerable at
