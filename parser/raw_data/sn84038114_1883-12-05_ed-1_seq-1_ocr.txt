Hit they did claim that the jiersoual
jroperty belonged to him, aud be
luuight they baa clearly proved It by
be evidence. He did not thick the

jail wanted to show ownership of the
iroperty, they should have done so at

Judge Houston said "they did
ske the offer ami you objected, aud I
id it could be offered later In the
i»«," and decidud that the papers could
offered uow.*
M r. Bates sala after snob an emphatic
induration by the Court, he did not
mow that it waa necessary for him to
mv a word, but he deemed It due to
iitusdf to say that If the counsel on the
ither side had offered to prove thnee
acts, the conneel for the defense never
mew of It. He did not think any one
who knew him would suppose for one
commit that be would stand before the

ilo a thing like (bat he wonld with
Iraw trorn practice, and never api>ear
ii another case before this or any other

Two ears of corn, each measuring
IS)* Inches, have been left at the office
of tbe Village Record, West Chester,
Pa. These eqnal In length any that
we have received from the farmers of
New Caatle County, and It la not often
that this length la exoeeded. Among
the contrlbutiona at the Record office
are two ears bv Atwood Wllaon, of
Christiana Hundred, one of which Is 15
lnohes long and the other It. A sample
of Mr. Wilson's corn can be seen at
this office, and a notice of tbe same was
made sometime ago. In connection
with tbe above we may remark a
man who resides in IUluols
the Republican office on
and on looking at our specimens, re
marked that they did not raise such
corn as that iu Illinois, the ears being
large that the cattle could not eat
them, and yet he said some farmers had
raised one hundred bushels to the acre.
In that State it was the habit to turn
the cattle into the corn field and let
them gather the crop. Hence it is
necessary to grow corn producing small
ears, that cau be masticated without
danger of choking. The practice is a
wasteful one, and will doubtless be
abandoned In a few years. The farmer
who would turn his cattle Into a field
of corn in this section of the country
would bo looked upon as extremely
foolish.

London, Dec.4,1883,—General Pryor
to-day requested Mr. Lowell,tbe United

Home Office for a respite for O'Donnell
with the view of obtaining time to set
on foot a proceeding for a commutation
of the death sentence. Mr. Lowell en
tertained the request and will apply
the American authorities at Washl

Rusaell, of O'DonneU's counsel, will
wait upon Mr. Lowell to-morrow to sub
mit to him the legal grounds upon which
will be based the application for the
commutation of O'Donnell's sentence.
The Loudon correspondent of the Dub
lin Freeman's Journal says O'Donnell's
frenzy at the conclusion of his trial on
Saturday evening last, was due to the
fact that he was not allowed to speak,as
he was promised. He failed to bear the
Court Registrar, who asked him, before
sentence of death was passed, whether
he had auythlug to say, and made no
answer. When .fudge Denham, later
on, forbade his speaking, O'Douuell
thought he was wronged.

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
THE THIEB AlIVtL JIMItM
Or PRESIDENT ARTHUR
TO COM GBEES.
The topic) discussed and presented in
President Arthur's annual message are
as typical of the serene condition of the
country as was the absence of any gen
eral apprehension attending themeeting
of Congress—except the Speakership.
Whatever is treated by the President
d of In hie usual clear, bust
style, ae befits such a docu
ment. Beginning with our foreign af
fairs, they are all on a friendly footing,
and what is brought forward as to for
eign countries fully sustains this
material facte are already known.
It may be well, however, to mention
that the President recommends a Com
m issioner to look into and take care of
the interests of our fishermen on the
northern coasts of the A' lantic and Pa
rifle, an early revision of our laws on
pauper (assisted) emigration, and au
thority to compensate the Commission
apjminted by the President to inquire
egatious made against Ameii
can pork in foreign countries. Mea
sures tor the removal of restrictions on
our trade with Cuba and Porto Rico are
under consideration by the Spanish
Government Switzerland has taken
an initiative In projicsiug treaties
for International arbitration on
grave questions between nations,
and our Governm nt has giveu its
assent to such a treaty with Switzer
land
Steps have been taken for a new
treaty of commerce with Mexico. Peru
is getting into shape for a restoration of
regular government, and to that
Iglesias, the Provisional President, has
called an election for a ltepr sentative
Assembly to he held on the 13th of
January, to meet iu Lima on the 1st of
March. A revision of the reciprocity
treaty with the Sandwich Islands is
recommended ; and we may add that it
is much needed.
To offset, and possibly to prevent
certain hindrances to our commerce
with the Spanish West Indies, Brazil
and Turkey, the President suggests that
the Executive might be authorized to
retaliate by similar measures on Govern
ments that misbehave in that way.
Another suggestion is repeated to the
effect that the President might be em
powered to send delegatee to the social
and scientific congresses frequently
on foot by other Governments. T1
notes, we think, cover about all that
needs special mention in our foreign
relations.
The message then proceeds to the tt
nances. The gross revenue from all
sources for the year ending June 30th,
1883, was 1398,287,881.95, and the total
of ordinary ex, enditures was $265,408,
137.54, leaving a surplus applicable to
the extinguishment of the publio debt
of $132,879,444.41. As a consequence of
the rapid payment of the debt the only
bonds now within early reach of the
Government for that purjiose are $305,
000,000 of three per cents, which, If the
surplus revenue uontiuues to be so great
as it Is now, may all he called in four
years at least before any of the four and
a half per cents are within call cf the,
Government. Of the three per cents
nearly $200,000,000 are now held by the
Treasury as part basis for national hank
note circulation ; and as these may pos
sibly he called in in the next four years,
and so produce a contraction of the cur
rency, some plan should be adopted by
which the circulation can be provided

In relation to the surplus the 1'resi
dent said :
Hitherto the surplus, as rapidly as it
has accumulated, has been devoted to
the reductiou of the National debt.
As a result the only bonds now out
standing, which are redeemable at tbe
pleasure of tbe Government, are the
three per cents, amounting to about
$305,000,000.
The four end one-half per cent*'
amounting to $250,000,000, and the
$737,000,000 four per ceuts are not
payable until 1891 and 1907, respec
tively.
If the surplni shall hereafter be as
large as the Treasury estimates now
indicate, the three per cent bonds may
all be redeemed at least four years be
fore any of the four-and-one-half per
cents can be called In. The latter, at
tbe same rate of accumulation of surplus
can be paid at maturity, and the mo
neys requisite for the redemption of the
four per ceuts will be lu the Treasury
many years before those obligations be
come payable. There are cogent reasons,
however, why the National Indebtedness
should not be thus rapidly extinguished
Chief among them is the fact that only
by excessive taxation is such rapidity
attainable.
Id a communication to Congreas at
ita last aesaion I recommended that all
excise taxed be abolUhed except thone
relating to distilled spirits, and that
substantial reductions be also made in
the revenues from customs. A statute
has since been enacted by which the
annual tax and tariff receipts of the
Government have been cut down to the
extent at least, of fifty or sixty millions
of dollars. While I have no doubt that
still further reductions may be wisely
made, I do uot advise the adoption at
this session of any measures for large
diminution of the national revenue.
The results of the legislation of the last
session of the Congress have not, as yet,
become sufficiently apparent to justify
any radical revision or sweeping modi
fications of exiding law. In tho inter
val which must elapso before the effects
of the acts of March 3, 1883, can be
definitely ascertained, a portion at least
of the surplus revenues may be wisely
applied to the long-neglected duty of
rehabilitating our navy and providing
coast defences for the protection of our
harbors. This is a matter to which I
shall again advert.
ft
Better law than that now in oxiatcnce
toprovide for the eucceeniou to the Preai
dency in case of the death or disability
of both President and Vice President, is
the subject of a renewed suggestion in
the message. This subject was referred
to in our columns a few days ago as one
ot tbe pressing duties of Congress. The
law as it now stands is extremely fnulty
And dangerous The President also re
peats a recommendation for a constitu
tional amendment that will enable the
Executive to veto objectiouable items
in appropriation bills without defeating
the entire bills.
He then refers to the Fourteenth amend
inent ol the Constitution as having been in
tended to secure the colored race iu the
United States the full enjoy
political rights, and the declared
tut tonality of certain statutes under that
amendment; and then sajs that any supple
mentary legist tton that will afford the equal
enjoyment by all citizens of the United
States of every right, privilege and Iminu
nity or oitizenshlp auaranteed by tho
amendment will receive his unhesitating
approval.
The President does not advise any furthor
reduction of either the tariff duties or the
internal taxes at this session, as ti ls better,
ho thinks, to wait for a fuller development of
the effects ol the tariff and tax act passed
at the late session. If there shall be a sur
plus, a portion of It at least might be de
voted to rehabilitating the navy and provid
ing for the ooast and harbor defence, too

▲a by a tort of common consent the Trade
Dollar has passed out of domestic trade, the
President recommends that it be reoeived at
the Treasury and Mints as bullion, at some
small per oent. above the ourrent market
price or sliver of the same fineuess. The
foregoing summation coven the finance por
tion of the message as well as those connec
ted with the Navy and War Departments,
exoepta suggestion to Congress that the
Militia of the States should be encouraged at
an auxiliary to the military arm of the Gene
ral Government.

is in the message was fairly covered

by a
publication In this paper yesterday, except
that the President favors the restoration of
the one-cent postage for local or city letters,
a point on whies he differs from his Postmas
ter General. He does not tavor projects to
take the Government into the telegraph
business, and In this he is In accord with
General Gresham, though the President
thinks there should be law for some sort of
supervision ever inter-state telegraphic
communication. He ooincldes with the At
torney-General as to a revision of tho laws
relating to the fees of witnesses In United

the Interior suggests on the Indian question,

laws, and aid by the Federal Government

slave) portions of the oountry. With regard
to polygamy In Utah, the President thinks

beneficial. St far as the President Is aware
