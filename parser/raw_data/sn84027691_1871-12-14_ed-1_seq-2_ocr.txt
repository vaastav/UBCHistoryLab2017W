TIB. The strong point of President Grant' Ad
ministration is the fense of perfect security it
giro the whole country- This is the eu
preme excellence the torn of all merits. It
is capacity, fidelity, honesty, fctatesmanship.
It is oundnen of principle and prudence of
direction. The Administration calmly and
steadily pursues its great work, and the
country goes forward with a feeling of un
doubting trust and an assurance of entire
safety. Republicanism dreads no perfidy.
Trade and industry stand in no apprehension
of disturbing agitation on the public credit
or chimerical experiments in finance. Com--merce
fears no rash and inconsiderate policy
of war. The rights of all are maintained
and the great business intercuts of the country
prosecute their labor with the full confidence
of free play, tranquil security and watchful
protection.

We make no war on capital, says Ver.delI
Phillips to Kev. Samuel Johnson. Wc
prach no materialism. Oar communism is
only that co-operation which, bo:n of Chris
tianity, kills the angry system of competition
aad wages, and brings injirotherhood. The
first thing that struck me with wonder when
I began to confer with these labor reformers,
tea years ago, was the firm conviction I
found in them that Labor and Capital were
friends, not foes; partners, not antagonists;
and that the laborer was more interested, if
possible, tlian the capitalist, in maintaining
the aacredness of capital. Let you, my
friend, mingle with with the men who lead
in this movement, instead of criticising it
from a distance. Then I feel furc your in
stincts, which were never false to humanity,
will bring us into accord.
TBE ESGLIftH BEBT IMBROGLIO.
It has been discovered that a recent For
Miamrntary return issued by the British Gov
ernment contains a trifling misstatement of
more than $250,000,000 in the circulation
and sum total of the national debt. The ac
counts of the Treasury somehow forgot to
include in their totals of public liabilities the
capitalised value of the terminable annuities,
which in the spring of .1870 were officially
computed at 53,130,380, and which, after
making allowance for the past year, swell
the public debt to nearly 800,000,000, in
stead of 737,400,237 given as the whole
indebtedness on the 31st of last month. Asa
large reduction of the public debt had been
claimed by the Government, this disclosure
k likely to have a damaging effect upon the
Gladstone administration. It has also trans
pired that an attempt has been made to de
ceive the British public by netting forth the
cancellation of liabilities by the creation of
annuities as an extinguishment of dt-lt,
whereas it was only a transference of indebt
edness from one Fet of creditors to another.
THE LAST PBIZE FIGHT.
The .latest prize fight was disappointing.
The only solace that a human being ever had
in prize fights was that they always bruised
and Rometimeslcilledjthe participants in them,
and that occasionally a kind Providence per
mitted a general affray, in which numbeis of
spectators were killed or disabled. 'Also
one combatant and his friends were sure to
lose their money. But here everything was
disgustingly peaceable. Nobody was killed.
nobody was seriously hurt, and nobody lost
any money save such as thieves got in the
practice of their vocation. There is a slight
satisfaction in reading that Mr. Mace broke
his hand, but it is dampened by the it flec
tion that the statement is probably untrue.
In any event, the perssn of Mr. Cuburn is
uninjured, and that is a sorrow which out
weighs any joy that can lie derived from the
injuries to the person of Mr. Mace. By all
means if we are to have prize fights let them
be fatal to Fomebody, and not like this one,
which decided nothing and killed nobody.
BPECIAI, ELECTION IN GEORGIA.
'.The passage by the Georgia Legislature.over
the acting Governor's veto, of a bill to pro
vide for a special election for Governor, on
the third Tuesday in December, to fill the
vacancy caused by the resignation of Gov.
Bullock, is likely to lead to a revival of the
wont partisan passions among the people of
that State, and will probably end in the In
terposition of the authority of the General
Government. Indeed one of the ablest
Democrats in the Legislature, Mr. Jackson,
stated in his speech opposing the measure,
that the Legislature, by passing the bill,
"would put the people on a platform where the
Federal Government would have a right to
interfere." "Talking and excitable men,"
he said, "wanted the election, but the people
did not. It would result in a military cov-
ernment over Georgia." The message of the
acting Governor Benjamin Conley, vetoing
the bill, is a well written, clear, and as
appears to us, conclusive argument against
its constitutionality. It is also claimed by
the Republican papers of Geoigia, that the
hill was not legally passed, as it was only
carried in the Senate by the casting vote of
the President.
WOBBEBS SF THE TELLOWHIOXE.
The geological surrey of the western terri
tory of the United States for the present sea
aea has been concluded, and Prof. Hayden,
chief of the expedition, has returned to
Washington. His party numbered thirty
five, and seven weeks were spent in explor
ing ike wonderful region of the upper Yel
lowScnieriveFajH lakeland the source of
the Snake and Missouri' rivers, in Southern
Montana. The Yellowstone lake, eight
thonsaiid feet above the sea level the highest
lake in the world except Titicaca, in Peru
was thoroughly sounded and explored, and
the districts in which are the remarkable
hot springs carefully surveyed and the tem
perature of the waters recorded. In the Fire
Hole basin, in the valley of the Fire-Hole
river, are between one thousand and fifteen
handled of these hot springs, the tempera
4c of which ranges from 180 to 193 deg.,
the hailing point of water at that elevation
being only 192. The "Grant" geyser throws
a column of hot water eight feet in diameter
to a height of over two hundred feet at regular
intervals of thirty-two hours, while others
are in almost continuous operation. The
geological formation of the valley is wholly
Yolcanic The soil k fertile, but unproduc
tive, owing to iu great elevation and low
amneratare. Professor Hayden brought
hack several tons of geological specimens
i him, which are now at the Smithsonian

Mr. P.Q. Bond, of- Montgomery County,
is a candidate for Clerk of the House of Rep
resentatives. Mr. Bond is a competent man,
and will make as good a Clerk as the State
ever had. A true Republican, a genial com
panion and popular, he will command the
friendsibp of the members. The fact that be
is a brother of our W. n. Bond, and that he
was formerly a citizen of our town, accounts
his having so many friends in Leavenworth.
THE TttPEKA KUHKB.
The Record has ceased to live, and we
publish to-day the card of F. P. Baker, Fxi ,
explaining the causes of its demise.
The Uumntoaatahk has purchased the
Record. The work of consolidation thus
begun in this city, is extending. We regret
the loss of the Record, but we congratulate
the Commontnalth tor many good reasons for
its new acoes-ion, pecuniarily, professionally
and politically. No doubt that it will con
tinuc to prosper, and we wish it nil the good
imaginable.
AX IIoafOKlBLE KXCEPHOa.
There is one navy officer who does not
drink and his name it is Smith. Admiral
Smith gave an entertainment upon ship board
to the Duke Alexis, and not a drop of any
thing tliat could intoxicate was served,
though the re'reshments were very elaborate
and expensive. That was true moral cour
age. It requires, sometimes, more courage
to meet and combat fashion, than to meet a
cast-iron foe. Something to drink is so
much a matter of course in fashionable cir
cles, and emphatically so in military and na
val circles, that the officer who has the stam
ina to fly in the face of the drinking custom,
is entitled to as much credit as one who meets
and defies an armed foe, and he should be
ranked among the tried heroes.
AS.1IYINH.
no halfway work
There is no halfway work abojt the
"passivism" of the St. Louis Jicjmhlican.
Its Democracy would declare, in full National
Convention, that the parly will withdraw
from the Presidential contest with no "basis
for reorganization," no "announcement of
principles," nothing but a "simple platform
of opposition to Grant," It must be, on
the whole, rather flattering to the President
that a great party such as the Democracy un
questionably showed itself when he last
triumphed over 3", now exhibits figns of
abandoning all its principles to contend un
der borrowed leaders against his re-election.
I To be sure, the compliment would be greater
if the party had more valuable principles to
surrender.
A BIS CAST CALAMITY.
The Chicago fire is not the mo fearful
disaster of the present year. The Chinese
floods, of which wc have had brief accounts,
submerged 20,000 square miles of territory,
an area exceeding that of one-third of Eng
land and Wale". When the fact of theex
trcmcly dense imputation of China is taken
into consideration, the apalling nature of
the catastrophe will better Le appreciated.
The flood occurred in the northern psit of
the empire, and was occasioned by thcbieak
ing of the banks of the river. When the
first break occurred, the ople might r-
haps have stopped it, hot instead of setting
the people at work, the officials went to sac
rifice to Yuen Sheu, a fabulous tortoise or
fish, who is hUpposcd to control the waters.
When their devotions were through, the
damage was iat remedy.
THEEXGLIKIICATIiaLlfNASBTME
SOUTHER COLORE! MEN.
Dr. Manning, the Catholic Primate of
Westminster, says the New York Herald,
has sent out a band of missionaries to deal
with and convert our Southern blacks. There
are those who think this officious and med
dling. We are not so minded. Our South
ern blacks and whites of the lower classes are
deplorably ignorant. The former, made
citizens of the United Stales by the act of
emancipation, are fully entitled to make use
of their privilege. Butto be useful citizens
they need education: and wc are glad to wel
come all educational help, whether it comes
from Archbishop Manning, or Dr. Tait, or
Prince Bismarck, or Pius the Ninth, or
Henry Ward Beecher. What we want in the
Sjuth is an intelligent vote, both while and
black, ami whatever contributes to that must
be regarded as a blessing.
ALEXIS ITEMS.
The Grand Duke Alexis and t-uite, says
the New York Herald of the 3rd, accompa
nied by a distinguished party of ladies and
gentlemen, representing the elite of New
York society, visited the United States Mili
tary Academy at West Point, yesterday,
where he reviewed the cadets and inspected
the buildings connected with the Academy.
Page's picture of Fsrragut in Mobile Bay
will be presented to the Prince this morning,
and the New York Yacht Club entertain
him at dinner at Delmonico's this evening.
He will leave for Philadelphia to-morrow.
The New York Commercial Advertiser
contains the following: "The Duke Alexis
is six feet two inches high. He told ex-
Senator Morgan, on the Mary Powell, that
he was one inch taller than his father, Alex
ander II. His hair is combed straight up
and back, and is in color a light auburn.
His forehead is high, gently sloping back
like Mr. Brecher's. His nose is regular,
eyes large and mellow, and lips soft and
velvety. His mustache is short, and like
his side whiskers, is of a golden hue. He is
a handsome man. Stand him in a crowd of
one hundred handsome men, and he would
be picked out as the handsomest. He is
handsomer than any member of the Execu
tive Committee, which is composed of the
best blood in the metropolis."

Our Leavenworth cotemjioraricisliave been
the warm advocates of this Kansas Central
proposition; hence we go to them for infor
mation. We do not expect them, however,
to tell the people who the directors of the
road are, how much of their own money the
projectors put in it, who will handle the
bonds voted by the people, and how much of
the road, in short, will be built. Silence
with reference to these matters suits them
better. We don't believe that Tom. Scott
owns a dollar of stock in the road, nor that
anybody else has paid a cent into the treas
ury of the concern; nor that Tom. Scott will
rik much iron, even though secured by
mortgage. Oar Leavenworth cotemporaries
stind in the relation of chief advocates of the
concern, and ought to be able to set us right
if we are wrong, and give the public all the
information desired concerning the project
They have thus far been so kind in favoring
with information that we are led to hope
that tbev will continue to do so. If they
only will, we will pardon them bad manners
and ill temper in the manner of giving it.
Lamenee Standard.
The Directors are Messrs. Smith, Stone,
Lucien Scott, Newman, Havens, Stetlauer,
Gillett, Wilson, Tom. A. Scott, McManus,
and Baird. They have paid in 000,000
cash. The Leavenworth Directors arc worth
$2,000,000. The Eastern Directors are
known to be the largest railroad, engine and
car builders, and iron manufacturers in the
East, and arc worth manymillionsof dollars.
The Directors will 'handle the bonds them
selves just so soon as the road is completed,
and not before. Nearly twenty-five miles of
the road is now graded, and will be ironed
and operated by February next. Tom Scott
and his friends do own one-third of the road.
The Company is paying out ils tens of thou
sands of dollars every week. Two engines
and construction cars, with two passenger
cars ate completed and on the way here. No
road ever progressed more rapidly and satis
factorily thin the Kansas Central. If we
have been guilty of "had manners" or "ill
temper" toward you or any other man, we
beg your pardon. Wc never felt letter in
our life, and really hope you will improve
the temper, tone and truthfulness of your
editorials, for they are sadly out of joint.
If you desire to tell the truth fairly about
this road, yoii can read the Leaienworttb
tapers, for all these facts hare been published
in them, or you can call on the officers of the
Company, who will give you all the desired
information. Are you satisfied ?
THE REFORM COMMITTEES.
Elsewhere we publish the committees ap
pointed by Dr. C. A. Logan, for the purpose
of investigating and devl-ing measures of mu
nicipal and county reform. This is a matter
in which every tax payer is interested, and
one on which the public press should sound
no uncertain note. We take exceptions to
two members of the Committee on City Af
fairs, viz: D. R. Anthony and Geo. H. Eng
lish, and one on County Affairs, Hon. D. J.
Brewer. Our dissatisfaction with these aj
pointmeuts proceeds from no ticrsonal feel
ing or motives, but is liased simply on the
fact of their manifest unfitness, and a cer
tainty that they will lie equally wisati"fap.
tory to the people. We want no one who is
either an office holder, an office seeker, or
who is affiliated with office holders or office
seekers. It is a matter for business men and
property holders alone, who will have no in
terest in lieing anything but rad
ical, impartial and thorough in the
work of retrenchment. Reform is
not to be played at as a iiarlor game, but
should be entered into in downright earnest
ness fur the common relief. It Is our belief
tliat a committee of five i intdequate for the
purpose of satisfacforilly performing the
work in hand. It should he increased to
twenty-five, and include a majority of busi
ness men, who have too much at stake to be
anything but earnest, thorough and unre
lenting in lopping off our useless ami ex
travagant expenditures. Commercial.
We read the above with surprise and as
tonishment. We learn from the proprietor
that the article was written by the editor of
the Commercial. He is a loy, jut graduated
from school, whose knowledge of public af
fairs and the finances of the city and county
of Leavenworth is as limited as his goo,!
sense.
There are ten on the committee, Lone, D.
R. Anthony, Spry, English, Taylor, J. W.
Morris, Brewer, John Wilson, Pierce and
Foote. Every one of lhec men have either
held office, been candidates foroffice, or have
been conpicuous before the people as )oliti-
cians.
Therefore when the Commercial takes ex
ceptions to the three named, it only exhibits
its maliciousness, for all of the ten commit
txmen are "office holders, office seekers or
affiliated with office holders or office reek
ers." Indeed we would like to have the
man named in Leavenworth who, having
a fair amount of brains and
good sense ha, not cither held
an office, been a candidate or been affiliated
with them. If you can find a man alio has
not, you will find a man so extremely sclfih
and sordid that he dors not take interest
enough in public affair to see tliat good
men are elected and that the laws are
honestly administered.
As for D. R. Anthony, for many years he
has persistently advocated city retrenchment
and reform with all the earnestness of his
nature. At last the repeated robberies, the
fraudulent operations by which the City an J
County of Leavenworth lus been swindled
and the numerous leaks whereby the public
funds have escaped, have attracted public
attention.
The parties in power in Iwth city and
county for the just six years, were placed
there with the support of the Cummacial.
That paper not only advocated the election of
these officials but has for six years supported
and defended these administrations.
D. R. Anthony has been for six years op
posed to the policy pursued by these official.
He has eo stated time and time again ; he has
pointed out these wrongs; he has shown the
people where, when and how they have been
robbed.
It looks very much, therefore, as though
the Commercial was alraid that its connection
with the frauds of the past would be exposed,
or else that they do not desire a reform. We
do not know, but we have a suspicion that
the men who furnished the proprietors with
the means to purchase the Commercial, and
some of them are men who to-day are rob
bing the city and county, are the rcalpnriies
who dictate what shall be faid in the
CbuBierciaf. We do know that the editor is
a mere tool, who writes what he is told to
write for the sum of fifteen dollars per week.
The Commercial stands in the same petition
toward the frauds at horns that the Ne
York World stands with the Tammtny Ring.
It did all in its power to prevent an investi
gation, to conceal and to protect the swin
dlers, until the thieves and robbers were
unmasked, and then it "whopped" over and
was the loudest mouthed in denunciation of
the robbers' ring.
Thank God, the people are aroused, and
they are no longer terrified at the cry
of D. R. Anthony. The people know that
D. R. Anthony k thoroughly posted upon
the question of the finance of the city and
county. They know that he is honest, and
they know he vill do his duly fearlessly and
welL They know that his all is invested
here, and that he will unmask the thieves;
and the people will aid and sustain him in his
efforts, until the Leavenworth ring will be
cursed as heartily as the New York ring of
thieves and plunderers.
The end ot the robber' ring drawetli nigh

all along the lin?. Auiplc time was allowed
all parties to do justice to the excellent re-
tst provided for them, and we were off
again. From Leavenworth, Lawrence and
Kansas City, we had come by regular trains,
but from this point we were taken by an ex
tra train of tialace cars, run for the especial
accommodation ol the party, Flopping and
starling at pleasure. The ride from
OTTAWA TO TIIF. STATE LINE
was everything that a railroad ride could be.
Wc can't imagine anything that was want
ing to add to the pleasure of the occasion.
Rich and elegant cars, upon
one of the smoothest roads in the Wot,
through the finest country in the world and
during wenther that Adam in Paradise might
have envied; every want of the gtibts was
anticipated by our whole-souled host', and
every "crcatute comfort" provided. While
the eye was feasting upon views of the most
lovely country that the sun in his rounds
looks down upon, the ear was regaled with
melody by the Kansas City brass band and
the not less musical merry voices of the happy
company, and, at the same time, like Hans
Brictman, alien he came to Kansas, we had
"Kvcrrdings on eait floral,
Uu.l "swlce u mooch to drink. '
Wc would like to notice in detail all the
flourishing towns through which wc passed
on the line of the road, but time and space
will not permit, but suffix it to say that
every town, village and hamlet in Southern
Kansas, on the line of the L., L. & G.,
wears the unmlstakeable air of progress and
prosperity; the country Is filling up with
unexampled prxvqicrity, and being developed
as if by magic. Such a ride as our party
had, through such a country, is a pleasure
long to be remembered, and will not soon he
forgotten by any of the party. Having tar
ried too long at Ottawa ire had to make up
"ia-t time," and the company had a good
opportunity to judge of the substantial char
acter of the road bed by being carried over
it, for a short time, at the rate of about fifty
miles an hour. Very few western roads will
admit of such running as that, but our cars
moved just xs steadily as though the speed
hid bocn five in-tead of fifty miles, and
nobody 'felt the slightest apprehension of
danger, because CapL Ransom was the con
ductor in charge, and he always knows what
he is doing; there is not a more competent
or careful conductor "on the rail," in this
Slate or elsewhere, and when he "lets her
out," tlioc-e rho know him know it is all
right.
About six o clock in the evening we
reached our destination, and stepped out of
the cars at .

This a town of a few months growth, con
tains a ponlation of rhaps fifteen hundred,
and like all other towns through which we
passed, seems to be in a highly prosperous
condition, and going ahead at railroad speed.
As our "transportation" hadn't come up, we
"marched" from the depot to
THE ELDHIDOE HOUSE.
With as little delay as KWsih'e,
the ladjes of the party were
all provided with comfortable rooms,
and as soon as they got their chignons, etc,
attended to, supper was announced, and the
whole party sat down together in the spa
cious dining hall, to a meal that would hare
done credit to any Eastern hotel. Nothing
afforded the party a greater surprise than the .
character of the meal to which we were in
vited at the E'.dridge; being away out on the
frontier, on the "borders of civilization," we
expected to be regaled with "hog and hom
iny," but when we sat down we discovered
that everything to be found in a metropolitan
hill of fare wis set before us, and an appetite
sharpened by a half day's ride in the pure
air of be prairies enabled us to enjoy it.
After snpper the tables were removed, and
he next feature in order was
TOE BALL.
The brass bead famished most
delightful music for the occasion, and the
dance, like every other feature of the pro
gramme, waa a complete imnss Many a
set of staid aad steady tecs that had sot
fork, these many Tears, were sedaced from
their propriety, and tripped gaily sot for a
moment, but for all night Some of the
deacons who were with the party two in
particular seemed to dance as though they
hadn't had a chance before in half a life
time, and when the musicians announced
themselves exhausted, at 4 o'clock in the
morning plead for just one more waltz.
After the ball, the ladies of the party retired
to comfortable beds and the gentlemen
WEST TO BOOST.
The hotel is large and capacious much
larger than any one would expect to Gnd on
the frontier but our company, including
the original parties and the recruits picked
up on the way, numbered over two hundred
a larger crowd than any ordinary hotel
might be expected to provide for; but all the
gentlemen soon made themselves more or
less comfortable, at the hotel and in the cars,
and when breakfast was announce I at seven
in the morning, the whole phalanx was in
line, and ready for duly. At 9 o'clock we re
enlnrked for
"the return.
Ran down to the end of the track five
miles from CofTeyvill went across the line
into the Indian Territory, "interviewed" the
town of Parker, and were soon ofl again for
the north and for home. The coming was
but a repetition of the going, except a little
more merry, as the party had become'better
acquainted, and there was less reserve. The
feature of the return trip was the
DISSEJl AT HUMBOLDT.
The Landreth House, justly noted for its
good table, surpassed itself on thk occasion,
and the party unanimously voted the dinner
faultless, and not to be excelled. The long
tables fairly groaned beneath the weight of
good things, and the cooking was such as
the daintiest epicure could not find fault
with.
Alter an liour ami a liall at JIumboKIt we
were again on the wing, and a few hows
brought us to Otawa, where our train was
divided, Leavenworth this time switching off
with our Missouri neighbors, and coming
home by way of Kansas Cily. Before sera
rating, the following resolutions were passed
unanimously:
Be it resolved by thk excursion party from
Kansas City. Leavenworth and Lawrence:
1st That our thanks are due and are here
by tendered C. B. Peck, general freight and
iiasseneer agent, and other officers of the L..
L. & G. R. R., for their generosity in hav
ing provided for ut so pleasant a journey to
the southern frontier of Kansas and the
northern bordtr of the Indian Territory,
and for the magnificent entertainment given
us at the flourishing young city of Coffey-
vine.
2d. Tliat we also tender our thanks to H.
W. Diggins, train master of the road; J. 8.
Ranson, conductor of the excursion train;
R. E. Higgs, agent, and to the engineer, W.
II. Lowe, and others for their indefatieable
efforts in making our excursion, as we have
good reason to believe, the most delightful
and satisfactory ever given in the West
3d, That we recognize in the L., L. & G.
R. R. one of the most important links in the
prcxiicrity of our great 'West; a thoroughfare
through a region of country insnrpassable in
richness and fertility of soil, and abounding
in those resources which bring prosperity to
its proprietors, and add wealth to the nation.
Arriving at Kansas City at a little past C
'click in the evening, the Leavenworth folks
f und a 'buss provided by the L.-L. & G.. in
waiting for them, and were conveyed to the
Lindell Hotel, where (upper for tho paity
hid been ordered by the railroad company,
by telegraph. At train time on the Missouri
Pacific, cur sccial omnibus was again on
html to convey no to the del, where, after
lest than five minutes wailing we took the
train for Leavenworth, and were landed at
home st 12 o'clock on Thursday nighi.
We conid not say too much in praise of the
gentlemanly officers of the L., L. & G. es
pecially Messrs. Peck, Ransom and Higgs;
the-e gentlemen made it their special business
to sec that their guests were agreeably enter
tained, and their every want promptly pro
vided for. One or another ol these gentle
men was always with us, and nothing that
uIJ add to the enjoyment of the company
was left undone. They understand how to do
"the handsome," and, speaking for the
Leavenworth ar!y, we beg to assure them
that their kind attentions will long be remem
bered, and "Charley Peck's treat" will be
cherished by us as one of the pleasantest
episodes in a lifetime.

With this issue of the Kansas Stale Record
that paper ends ils existence as a "daily,"
and the undersigned severs his connection
with the press of Kansas.
It Is customary when an editor leaves the
profession, particularly ailera term of years,
that in making his farewell bow, lie also in

are usually complimentary to his natrons
and hts successor, and are very frequently in-

torial career, I do not propose to add to my
sins of omission or commission by uttering,
as I go off the stage, anything that I do not
mean.
I commenced the publication of the Kan
sas State Record in February 1SG3, now
nearly nine years ago. Topeka was then
little more than a hamlet, containing per
haps 1,000 inhabitants. A town of great
hop. 8 but with little prospect of realization.
From, the day I took hold ot the Jlecord I
commenced to work like a slave, and I be
lieve the numerous gentlemen who at differ
ent limes have called me "pet names," have
never called me a looter or an idler.
It is unnecessary for me to review the po
litical conflicts which have raged from the
year 18C3 onward for years. It is enough
for me to say that in all those fights, bitter
and merciless as they were, the Record always
"iook a nana." itigni or wrong, it was at'
ways sometvSerc, and did not parley, or dilly
dally, or skulk, or whine, or sneak, or sit
shivering on the top rail of the fence waiting
till the last moment to decide on which side
to fall off. The magnitude of the fight made
no difference. Whether it was a contest for
United States Senator, or town constable, the
Jtecord had its preference and expressed it.
We, or perhaps it is more proper to say,
I, think that this work was not all expended
in vain, as far as the promotion of the in
terests of certain politicians was concerned.
I can count over a number of men now high
in political station, or making a very com
fortable showing on the assessor's roll, who
were aided in their'hours of struggling ob
scurity by the State Record. Some of these
men at different times have had in their
hands the disposal of immense patronage.
Men were virtually appointed to Federal of
fices by them. These offices were disposed
of without reference to the claims of the
State Record. I was Assistant Assessor of
Internal Revenue before I purchased the
Record, and held the office for perhaps a
year alter that event, l was appointed on
the Board of Enrollment for some time, and
that Is the extent of my services as "a bloated
office holder" since my connection with the
press. It is evident that if I worked for of
fice I was poorly paid. How I got my pay
in other ways I will show further on.
In June, 1SCS, J was induced to start a
daily paper here. -The citizens of Topeka
were unanimous in the desire lor the estab
lishment of such a paper. I will do the
people of Topeka the justice to say that they
have very generally given the Record a fair
support. At any rate I do not feel like find
ing fault with them now. A vast amount of
Federal patronage was promised to encour
age the new enterprise. It is harldly nec
essary to say that the promises were not ful-
In April 18C9, less than a year after the
establishment of the daily, the office was
burned to ashes. Amid the ashes came the
same promises from high official sources,
and the daily was revived. larger and hand
somer than ever, double more worthy of
patronage than ever; certainly more expen
sive than ever, but paying no belter than be
fore. Hardly, however, had the Record got up
out of the ashes before a new rival appeared,
being nothing less than the State of Kansas.
Under the construction of the 8tate Printer
act. it was deemed proper the Sate should
start a paper to compete with individual en
terprise; to seadc hundred aad thoesands
ot copies iree, taas nader-uddag any news
paper conducted try aay individaal. The
new "official paper" was started with the
avowed purpose of breaking the Record
down. Predictions were made that the lat

In tns tulle sketch I have not, so far,
alluded to personal grievances. I do so
with reluctance sow. I will only aay that
during my editorial experience, I have not
only been assailed by the usual term of
villification employed in fosl controver
sies, but have in addition been
accused of every crime known
to the calendar, the blackest of
which humanity ia capable. These charges
have been brought not only by drunken and
irresponsible'scoundrelt, known aad recog
nized as such, but have been repeated by
men professing the religion of Jesus Christ:
men who were husbands aad fathers, aad
who must have known the suffering their
hideous scandal was carrying to the bosom
of an innocent family.
The conclusions I draw from my editorial
experienceis, that -independent journalism
in Kansas is not a brilliant success, especially
at the Capital I would advise no young
man to enter the editorial profession. If he
does so, and expects to make a living ly it.
if he has no higher motive, I would advise
him to avoid the luxury of independence; to
cringe at the feet of power; to 'always help
uic strong ana suck w wcbk; vo wvoiu in
dulging any opinion where results are doubt'
ful ; and thus avoid the misfortunes of

IS HEHSsMAH.
At a regular communication of Calvary
Lodge No. 50, A. F. A A. M, held Wed
nesday evening, December Cth, 1871, the
following proceedings were read:
Whereas, We have been called, since our
last regular communication, to mourn the
loss of one of our members, who, having
completed his labors here on earth, has gone
to another and belter world to join that
higher lodge where the Supreme Architect
presides, and under whose scrutinizing eye
all our works must be proved; while we
recognize that no formal eulogy upon the
virtue of the deceased will leave our sorrow,
yet it seems proper and befitting that we
should express our appreciatiooor the char
acter of our departed brother, iaa manner
that it may be recorded in the proceedings
ofthis lodge as a perpetual remembrance of
of a true and upright man. Therefore,
Resolved, That we deplore the loss, by
death, of our dear brother, JohnF. Kelly;
that we mourn his loss with a sorrow that
can only be aleviated by remembering that
to die is the common lot of all aad
that the arm of friendship cannot
oppose the King of Terrors, nor the charms
of innocence elude his grasp; but thus all,
all must die.
Raolted, That in the character of our de
parted brother we recognize the noblest work
of God "an honest man," a man whose
heart was right; a man whose ear was ready
to listen with sympathy to the story of lite
afflicted, and whose hand was ever ready to
relieve the wants of the needy.
Itaoltcd, That we remember with pleas
ure that his honor was proverbial; that his
Eromisc once given, was ever held sacred by
im, and taken with implicit faith by all who
received it. And while it is but human to
err, we believe if our brother did err, it was
the error of judgment, and not of the heart.
We remember our departed brother aa one
whose heart we believe was without guile,
who mingled with us as a true and upright
Mason.
Resohcd, That to the bereaved and
mourning friends and relatives of our deceas
ed brother, we tender our heartlelt siny pathy
in their hour of affliction.
Resohed, That the Secretary of this
Ixdge furnloh to the press of this city copies
of these resolutions tor indication.
Byron Sherry,
John H. Brown, CummUtee.
Henry F. Miller, J
Pending the adoption of the above resolu
tions, Brohter Byron Sherry addressed the
Lodge upon the life and character of the
deceased, and on motion, was requested to
furnish the substance of his remarks for pub
lication. W'arthipml Matter:
A seat in this Lodge has been made vacant.
Since our last regular communication, one of
our members has been called to his long
home. Another link has been taken from
the golden chain of fraternal affection.
Bi other John T. Kelly is no more.
While I can not hope to present a wreath
composed of the fairest, choicest, sweetest
flowers of thought, I can not let the present
occasion isms without laying upon the grave
of our Ileinrted Brother, a little broken
spray, as a token of my regard.
Death is a solemn tiling, and the grave i
the common home of all. The prince and
peascnt inuntJUe down side by side, for death
makes no distinction between the high and
low, the rich and poor, but all must die. It
has been said, "that the last offices paid to
the dead are uselul only as lectures to tiie
living; from them we are to derive instruc
tion, and to consider every solemnity of this
kind as a summons to prepare for our ap
proaching dissolution."
Notwstnstandimg the various mementoes
of mortality, whieh we duly meet: notwith
standing death has established his empire
over all the works ol nature; yrt through
some unaccountable infatuation we forget
thatwe are born to die; we go on from one
design to another, add hope to hope, and lay
out our plans for the many years, till we are
suddenly alarmed by the approach of Death
when we least expect him, and at an hour
which we probably conclude to be the merid
ian of our existence. It is then, that mem
ory in a moment traverses the whole course
of life, and scenes which were
long sgo forgotten pass before
the mirror of the mind in quick and rapid
succession. How important it is then that
we should walk uprightly in our KCVeral
stations before God and man, so tliat when
the pleasures ol this world shall cvase to de
light, we may be enabled to prosecute our
journey without dread or apprehension to
that ur distant country, wltence no traveller
returns, or, as beautifully expressed by the
poet:
To Utj. tbat when lav
ics to Join
The loouHMrable caravau lust moves
To that mrdeiloiu rrmln, whers each shall lake
lib chamber in the tilent aatle of death,

I have never attended a Masonic funeral
in my life without being more deeply than
ever impressed with the beauties of our in-
siuuuon. io relieve the distressed, m a
duty incumbent on all men, but more partic
ularly on Masous-who. are linked together
hy a chain of sincere affection. While the
world at Urge knows r.othin; of onr mys
teries, the good effects resulting from the
teachings of our order are visible on every
hand. When a brother is in need, Masonry
stretches forth ils hand to relieve his wants.
When prostrated by disease Masonry sends
a brother to the bed tide to soothe during the
hours of a miction, and when the hour of
death arrives Masons stand like niinistrrimr
angels of mercy to bathe the fevered brow, to
moisten the parched lips, and to catch the
last faint whisper as the spirit lakes its leave
of the cliy tenement and wings its flight to
that brighter and better world. It
then follows the lifeless body to
the grave. where with beautiful
and. appropriate ceremony it is deposited in
the silent tomb. Nor does it stop there. It
extends beyond the grave, and in the name
of that heaven-bora virtue charity, gives
relief and consolation to the distressed widow
aad orphans. Thus deaMuatratiag to the
world that Masonry was instituted among
men for a wise and noble purpoae.

Catacazy gave promise of being a useful and
very acceptable Minister, and nude an
agreeable impression. Soon, however", he
began to make biuiaeit very olliciou, inter

proached, and tending to emtnrrass the liee
course of legislation on subjects with respect
to which his interference was obtruded. He
did not hesitate to use the news
papers of the country to influence
public opinion ujon questions pending be
fore the. Government, and indulged in inuch
license in his denunciation measures and in

propriety of a foreign Minister thus attempt
