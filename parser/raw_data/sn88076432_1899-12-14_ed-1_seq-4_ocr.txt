McKINLEY'S MESSAGE.
In his messsage to congrees
President McKinley to a certain
extei.it defers making an author
itative announcement of his im
perialist policy as applied to the
definite and permanent soluuon of
the Philippine problem.
"It does not seem desirable that
I should recommend at this time
a specific and final form of govern
ment for these islands," he says.
To congress is rightfully left the
duty of constructing "a plan of
government which shall establish
aud maintain freedom and order
and peace in the Philippines."
The promise is made of a special
message to b® transmitted to
congress when the president shall
have received the full report of
the Philippine commission, now
in preparation.
The president's recommenda
tions with regard to Cuba are
equally evasive and unsatisfying.
His message speaks of a new
Cuba yet to raise from the ashes
of the past"—which might be
taken as meaning a free Cuba in
accord with the pledge under
which we went to war with Spain.
But in another breath he expresses
a doubt as to whether the ties
that are to bind this government
to Oubjt in the future "shall be
organic or conventional," and de
clares ominously that "our mis
sion, to accomplish which we took
up the gage of battle, is not to be
fulfilled by turning adrift a loosely
framed commonwealth to face the
vicissitudes which too often atteud
weaker states whose natural wealth
and abundant resources .ire offset
by the incongruities of their
political organization and the ro
carring occasion for internal rival
ries to sap their strength and
dissipate 'their energies." In
other words, now that we have
possession of Cub^, it is for us to
decide whether we shall relinquish
so valuable a possession, paying
nn'y a conditional attention to our
original pledge for Cuban in
dependence.
President McKinley's imperial
ism is not improved by a mingling
of typical Pharisaism. If we pro
pose to deny liberty to the Filipi
nos and to break our sacred
promise to the Cubans, let's at
least do it manfully, without any
Pecksniffian make-believe. If we
hold these islands as Americau
colonies, we'll do so simply for
thb reason that McKinley's repub
lican friends aud backers want to
work these islands for profit at
the expense of taxpayers in the
United States.
MARK HANNA'S STYLE.
Whoever writes the interviews
which are credited to United
States Senator Marcus A. Hanha
should take some pains to make
them fit the man. A stout, pep
ery, brusque man, who has not
enjoyed the blessing of a strictly
classical education, such as Mr.
Hanna, for instance, would never
think of saying to a reporter:
"It would be an ungrateful thing for
me tn discuss whether or not I will 'in
cept another term as chairman of the
republican national committee. It would
be audicious to discuss an offer that has
not been riinde."
He would state it in this way:
"What, me resign the chairman
ship? Don't you believe it, young
niau. Homebody has been stuffing
you. I'll quit when my time is
up and not before, and you can
say that for me in your paper, if
you like. And you can say, too,
that I don't believe Henry C.
Payne or any one eise ever said
I was too sick to hold the job.
Henry nor anybody else would
talk of me like that, unless I told
them to. No, sir! I have got into
this thing and I'm going to see it
through."
Now that would sound more
like Mr. Hanna's style. It would
fit his physique and newspaper
readers would feel more satisfied
that it came directly from the
distinguished senator.
It takes bat a minute to overcome
tickling in the throat and to stop* a

THE Census Bureau is to be the
same old political machine the re
publicans have invariably made it,
and those who control the appoint
ments don't care liow much it will
cost the people. An indication of
this has just been given by the
choice of a tabulating machine to
be used. The committee decided
to use the same machines that
were used ten years ago, although
a new machine was offered which
would do the work much faster.
The decision is said to have been
made because the new machines,
if adopted, would have largely re
duced the number of clerks re
quired, which republican congress
men protested against.
DEATH OF MRS. CRAWFORD.
An Early Resident Has Passed Through
the Beautiful Golden Gates.
Mrs. Joseph Crawford, one of the best
kn»wn and oldaat residents of Langdon,
having come here with her husband and
family, in November 1887, died at the
family home about 11 o'clock last Satur
day night. Death, came rather unex
pectedly, although the deceased had
for some time past been ill with in
flammatory rheumatism. The family
consisting of tin aged father, her
husbund and eight children, three girls
and five boys, were all present at the
time of her death and everything that
human hand and skill could do, was
done but without avail.
Mrs. Crawford
WHS
Her whole life had beeu devoted to
her home and family, and outside a
small circle of friends she had but few
acquaintances. To the family left to
mourn the sympathy of the entire
neighborhood goes out,and many a silent
tear will be dropped ou tlie grave of one
whose life has left behind her the fruits
of a good work well done.
The funeral held yesterday Hfternoon
was of a private character, beiujr held at
the family residence by Kev. Doujjan,
assisted by R«vs. Beer aud Robertson
The house as tilled with friends, while
the long line of carriages that followed
the remains to the cemetery showed the
respect iu which the deceased was held
by the community at large.
