The Southern Power company will
erect a 4,000 horsepower plant at Great
Falls, S. C., to furnish power for the
Manufacture of fertilizer from the air.
Two Similar plants are now in success
ful operation In European countries,
one In Norway and the second In Aus
trla, and producing fertilizers and ni
trogen compounds. The process Is an
•lectro-chemlc&l one, and centers about
the forcing of atmosphere through
iBame at high pressure, thereby produo
Ing gas, which, with the addition of
Water In certain proportions, produces
bitrlo acid. By subjecting these gases
to limestone a valuable compound used
In commercial fertilizers Is obtained.
The possible saving that may be real
ized through the establishment of such
proccss can be estimated when It is
Stated North Carolina uses 540,000 tons
lof fertilizer last year and South Caro-
lna 700,000 tons, or about 1,240,000 tons
the Carollnaa.
When he Is working In water In
fested by sharks and other sea mon
•ters likely to do him harm, the diver
|has at present to rely for his Bafety on
jthe use of the knife, or falling that, on
quick return to the Burface. Now
fcomea the Invention of Captain Grobl,
W German diving instructor, who has
iconstructed a rifle which can be flred
under water, and Is designed for the
bettfer arming of the diver. The most
remarkable thing about this Is that
It fires, not bullets, but water, which
is propelled with such force that it
has an extraordinary power of pene
tration. Indeed, the inventor himself
(has pierced armor plate of medium
ithlckness with the water jet from his
jweapon. The rifle has a stout barrel

(India rubber.
I When Miss Jennie Lee was on tour
Jwlth the dramatized version of "Bleak
[House," she met with an amusing ex
perience. One night she was in the
tmldst of the long and harrowing death
scene of poor Jo. The stage was dark
ened and the limelight Illuminated the
pale features of the death stricken boy.
People were sobbing all over the house.
Suddenly, to her consternation, Miss
Lee heard the limelight man address
ing her in a brawny Scotch whisper,
budible to half the house. "Dee quick,
Miss Lee—dee quick!" he roared softly.
"The limelight's gaen oot!" She did die
'"quick" but It was for the purpose
of making a speech to that limelight
man which he said he would never
forget.
Apparently every new Invention
brings with It some evil. The British
Medical Journal points out..that among
distinctively modern diseases are the
,poisoning produced by the fumes of
calcium carbide of acetylene the head
fache, dyspepsia, cardiac failure and
sensory disturbances traceable to the
manufacture and use of aniline dyes

MANY LARGE TOPICS
SHIP SUBSIDY IS URGED
Executive Advises That Tariff Board
Be Made Permanent, but Opposes
Another General
Revision.
Washington, Dec. C.—President Taft's
annual message to congress, which was
delivered today, opens with a discus
sion of the settlement before the Hague
tribunal this year. It takes up the rela
th"
the republic of Portugal is touched dp
on, together with its tentative recog
nition by the United States.
Relations with the far east, the Chin
ese railroad loan and kindred matters
are then discussed. The frienaiy visits
of oriental potentates to this muiitry
are touched upon, as are relations with
Latin America, particularly the Nica
raguan revolution. Former President
Zelaya Is severely condemned for his
alleged acts of maladministration.
Tariff Negotiations.
The first domestic topic discussed in
the message is tnat of tariff negotia
tions, and on this point the president
suys:
The new tariff law, In section 2 re-
visions came into effect on April 1, 1910,
imposed upon the president the respon
sibility of determining prior to that date
whether or not any undue discrimina
tion existed against the United States
and Its products in any country of the
world with which we sustained com
mercial relations.
In the case of several countries in
stances of apparent undue discrimina
tion against American commerce were
found to exist. These discriminations
were removed by negotiation. Prior to
April 1, 1310, when the maximum tariff
was to come into operation with respect
to importations from all those countries
In whose favor no proclamation applying
the minimum tariff should be Issued by
the president, 334 such proclamations
were issued. This series of proclamations
embraced the entire commercial world,
and hence the minimum tariff of the
United States has been given universal
application, thus testifying to the sat
isfactory character of our tr-.de rela
tions with foreign countries.
Marked advantages to.the commerce of
the United States were obtained through
these tariff settlements. Foreign nations
are fully cognizant of the fact that under
section 2 of the tariff act the president
is required, whenever he is satisfied that
the treatment accorded by them to the
products of the United States is not such
as to entitle them to the benefits of the
minimum tariff of the United States, to
withdraw those benefits by proclama
tion, giving 90 days' notice, after which
the maximum tariff will apply to their
dut.able products entering the United
States. In its general operation, this
section of the tariff law has thus far
proved a guaranty of continued com
mercial peace, although there are, how
ever. unfortunately instances where
foreign governments deal arbitrarily
with American interests within their
jurisdiction In a manner Injurious and
inequi table.
The policy of broader and closer trade
relations with the Dominion of Canada,
which was initiated in the adjustment
of the maximum and minimum pro
visions of the tariff act of August. 1909,
has proved mutually beneficial. It jus
tifies further efforts for the readjustment
of the commercial relations of the two
countries so that their commerce may
follow the channels natural to contigu
ous countries and be commensurate with
the steady expansion of trade and in
dustry on both sides of the boundary
i'ne. The reciprocation on the part of
the Dominion government of the senti
ment which was expressed bv this gov
ernment was followed in October by the
suggestion that it would be glad to have
the negotiations, which had been tem
porarily suspended during the summer,
resumed. In accordance with this sug
gestion the secretary of state, by my
direction, dispatched two representatives
of the department of state as special
commissioners to Ottawa to confer with
representatives of the Dominion govern
ment. They were authorized to take
such steps for formulating a reciprocal
trade agreement as might be necessary
and to receive and consider any prop-
S*P which the Dominion government
cht care to submit.
Pursuant to the instructions issued con
ferences were held by these commis
sioners with officials of the Dominion
government at Ottawa in the early part
of November.
Tjje negotiations were conducted on

The time in which the tariff was pre
pared undoubtedly was so short as to
sary strictly
elared measure. In order to avoid crit
icism oi ihls kind in the future and for
the purpose of more nearly conforming
to the party promise, congress at its last
session made provision at my request
for the continuance of a board created
under the authority of tho maximum and
minimum clause of the tariff bill, and
authorized this board to expend tho
aoney appropriated under my direction
for the ascertainment the cost of produc
tion at home and abroad of the various
articles included in the schedules of the
tariff. The tariff board thus appointed
and authorized lias been diligent In pre
paring itself for the necessary investi
gations. The hope of those who have
advocated the use of this board for tariff
purposes is that the question of the rate
of a duty Imposed shall becomo more of
a business question and less of a polit
ical question, to be ascertained by ex
perts of long training and accurate
knowledge. The halt in business and
tne snook to business, due to the an
nouncement that a new tariff bill is to
be prepared and put in operation, will
oe avoided by treating the schedules one
by one as occasion shall arise for a
change in the rates of each, and only

ent solution is the decision whether the

stated to the congress that I strongly
favor fortification and I now reiterate this

fli/i Vi rm a
duty to construct them. We
have built tho canal. It is our property.
By convention we have Indicated our de
sire for, and indeed undertaken, its uni
versal and equal use. It is also well
known that one of the chief objects in the
construction of the canal has been to in
crease tho military effectiveness of our
navy.
Failure to fortify the canal would leave
the attainment of both these aims in the
position of rights and obligations which
we should bo powerless to enforce and
which could never in any other way be
absolutely safeguarded against a desper
ate and irresponsible enemy.
National'Incorporation.
In a special message last year I brought
to the attention of congress the propriety
and wisdom of enacting a general law pro-
mendr.tion ln that behalf.
Judiciary Procedure.
One great crying need in the United
States is cheapening the cost of litigation
by simplifying Judicial procedure and ex
pediting final judgment. Under present
conditions the poor man is at a woeful
disadvantage in a legal contest with a
corporation or a rich opponent. The nec
essity for tho reform exists both in United
States courts and in all state courts. In
order to bring it about, however", it natur
ally falls to the general government by
Its example to furnish a model to ail
states. A legislative commission appoint
ed by joint resolution of congress to re
vise the procedure in the United States
courts has as yet made no report.
Undi:r the law the supreme court of
the United States has the power and is
given the duty to frame the equity rules
of procedure which are to obtain ln the
federal courts of first Instance. In view
of the heavy burden of pressing litigation
which that court lias had to carry, with
one or two of Its members incapacitated
through ill health, it has not been able
to take up problems of improving the
equity procedure, which has practically
remained the same since the organization
c£ the court in 1789. It is reasonable to
expect that with all the vacancies upon
the court filled, it will take up the ques
tion of cheapening and simplifying the
procedure in equity in the courts of the
United States. The equity business is
much the more important in the federal
courts, andl I may add much the more ex
pensive. I am strongly convinced that the
best method of improving judicial pro
cedure at law ls to empower the supreme
court to do it through the medium of the
rules of the court, as ln equity. This "is
the way in which it has been done in
England, and thoroughly done. The sim
plicity and expedition of procedure in the
English courts today make a model for
the reform of other systems.
Several of the lord chancellors of Eng
'and and of the chief justices have left
their lasting impress upon the history of
their country by their constructive abil
ity in proposing and securing the passage
of remedial legislation effecting law re
rorms. I can not conceive any higher duty
that the supreme court could perform than
in leading the way to a simplification of
procedure in the United States courts.
Relief of Supreme Court.
No man ought to have, as a matter of
right, a review of his case by the supreme
court. He should be satisfied by one hear
ing before a court of first instance and
one review by a court of appeals. The
proper and chief usefulness of the supreme
c2u:,'t.

°?st ,of articles import-

uw that whenever a chance is
th?s offlce0 £6tS!CeSSary
and especially of the supreme court
of the United States, is, in the cases which
come before it, so to expound the law, and
especially the fundamental law—the con
stitution—as to furnish precedents for the
inferior courts in future litigation and for
the executive officers in the construction
of statutes and the performance of their
legal duties. Therefore, any provisions
for review of cases by the supreme court
that cast upon that court the duty of
passing on questions of evidence and the
construction of particular forms of instru
ments, like indictments, or wills, or con
tracts, decisions not of general applica
tion or importance, merely clog and bur
den the court and render more difficult Its
higher function, which makes It so import
ant a part of the framework of our gov
ernment. The supreme court ls now car
rying an unnecessary burden of appeals
of this kind, and I earnestly urge that It
be removed.
The statutes respecting the review by
the supreme court of the United States
of decisions of the court of appeals of the
District of Columbia ought to be so amend
ed as to place that court in the same
position with respect to the review of its
decisions as that of the various United
States circuit courts of appeals. The act
of March 2. 1907, authorizing appeals by
the government for certain judgments in
criminal cases where the defendant has
not been put in Jeopardy, within the mean
ing of the constitution, should be amend
ed so that such appeals should be taken
to the circuit courts of appeaJs Instead of
to the supreme court In all cases except
those Involving the construction of the
constitution or the constitutionality of a
statute, with the same power in the su
pieiiro GOui to uu certiorari as Is
now exercised by that court over deter
minations *f the several circuit courts of
appeals. Appeals from the United States
court in Porto EJco should also run to
the circuit courts of appeals of the third
circuit Instead of to the supreme court.
These suggested changes would, I am ad
vised, relieve the supreme court of the
consideration of about 80 cases annually,
and would be ln harmony with the theory
of review which led to the establishment
of tho circuit courts of appeals and which
I have state above.
Injunction Bill.
I wish to renew my urgent recommjenda
ilUU ilirtClTJ in IHJ rant uujlliui
favor of the passage of a law which shall
regulate the Issuing of Injunctions ln
equity without notice In accordance with
the best practice now In vogue In the
courts of the United States. I regard this
of especial importance, first because it
has been promised, and second because it
will deprive those who now complain of
certain alleged abuses in the improper
Issuing of injunctions without notice of
anv real ground for further amendment
and will take away all semblance of sup
port for- the extremely radical legislation
they propose, which will be most perni
cious if adopted, will sap the foundations
of Judicial power, and legalize that cruel
social Instrument, the secondary boycott.
I further recommend to congress the
passage of tho bill now pending for the
increase in the salaries of tho federal
judges, by which the chief Justice of the
supreme court shall receive $17,500 and the
associate judges $17,000 the circuit judges
constituting the circuit court of appeals
shall receive $10,000, and the district judges
$9,000.
Postofflce Department.
At its last session congress made pro
vision for the establishment of savings
banks by the postofflce department of this
government, by which, under the general
control of trustees, consisting of the post
master general, the secretary of the treas
uary and the attorney general, the sys
tem could be begun in a few cities and
towns, and enlarged to cover within its
operations as many cities and towns and
as large a part of the country as seemed
wise. The initiation and establishment of
such a system has required a great deal

Extension of the Classified Service
Upon the recommendation of the post
master general, I have included In
s'
's
°f f'ce government mail
As tho first step in i.^c. direction of this
reform, special stamps and stamped en
velope.s have been provided for use m-
in the free transmission..
of the official mail resulting from the
bus.ness of the new postal savings system
By proper recording the Issuance of sucit
stamps and envelopes accurate records
can be kept of the Cost to the govern-
of handling the postal savings mail,
which is certain to become an important
item of expense and one that should be
separately determined. In keeping with
this plan it is hoped that congress will
authorize the substitution of special of
ficial stamps and stamped envelopes for'
the various forms of franks now used to
carry free of postage the vast volume »r'
departmental and congressional mail mat
ter. During the past year methods of ac
counting similar to those employed in the
most progressive of our business establish
ments have been Introduced in the postal
service and nothing has so impeded the
department's plans in this regard as the''
Impossibility of determining with any ex
actness how far the various expenses of
the postal service are increased by the
present unrestricted use of the franking
privilege. It is believed that the adoption
of a more exact method of dealing with
this problem as proposed will prove to be
of tremendous advantage in the work of
placing the postal service on a strictly
businesslike basis.
Second-Class Mail Matter.
In my last annual message I invited the
attention of congress to the inadequacy
of the postal rate imposed upon second
class mall matter In so far as that in
cludes magazines, and showed by figures
prepared by experts of the postofflce de
partment that the government was ren
dering a service to the magazines, cost
ing many millions in excess of the com
pensation paid. An answer was attempt
ed to this by the representatives of the
magazines, and a reply was filed to thi3
answer by the postofflce department. The
utter lnadequaoy of the answer, consid
ered ln the light of the reply of the post
office department, I think must appeal to
any fair-minded person. Whether the an
swer was all that could be said In behalf
of the magazines 1b another question. I
acrree that the question ls one of fact but
I Insist that if the fact Is as the experts
of the postofflce department show that
we are furnishing to the owners of maga
zines a service worth millions more than
they pay for It, then Justice requires that
the rate should be increased. The In
crease in the receipts of the department
resulting from this change may be de
voted to Increasing the usefulness of the
department in establishing a parcels post
and in reducing the cost of first class post
age to one cent. It has been said by the
postmaster general that a fair adjustment
might be made under which the advertis
ing part of the magazine should be
charged for at a_
different and higher rate
iruill Lllttt ui leading liittttci1, Tills
would relieve many useful magazines that
are not circulated at a profit, and would
not shut them out from the use of the*
malls by a prohibitory rate.
Parcels Post.
With respect to the parcelu poiit, I re
spectfully recommend its adoption on all
rural delivery routes, and that 11 pounds— Sh-".1
the international limit—be made the 11m- rk
It of carriage in such post, and this with
a view to its general extension when the
Income of the postofflce will permit and
the postal savings banks have been fully
established. The same argument is made
against the parcels post that was made
against the postal savings bank—that it is
introducing the government Into a busi
ness which ought to be conducted by pri
vate persons, and ls paternalism. The
postofflce department has a great plant
and great organization, reaching into
the most remote hamlet of the United
States, and with this machinery it ls able
-a many things economically
that If a new organization were neces
sary it would be impossible to do without
extravagant expenditure. That is the
reason why the postal savings bank can
be carried on at a small additional cost
and why it ls possible to Incorporate at
a very inconsiderable expense a parcels
post ln the rural delivery system. A gen
eral parcels post will Involve a mudh
greater outlay.
Abolition of Navy Yards.
The secretary of the navy has given per
sonal examination to every navy yard and
has studl{d the uses of the navy yards
with reference to the necessities of our
fleet. With a fleet considerably less than
half the, size of that of the British navv,
we have shipyards more than double the
nmnber and there ate several of these
shipyards, expensively equipped with
modern machinery, which after investiga
tion the secretary of the ns.vy believes to
be entirely useless for nlival purposes.
Jie asks authority to abandon certain of
them and to move their machinery to
other places where it can be made of u*e.
In making these recommendations the
following directly along pro- £.
tfressive Lnes which nave been adopted In
L..
-If
iH
thr
classified service all assistant postmaster
and I believe that this giving a secure
tenure to those who are the most im*
subordinates of postmasters wilt
add much to the efficiency of their offices
and an economical administration. A lailo
number of the fourth class postmaster
are now In the classified service. I think
it would bo wise to put in the classified
service the first, second, P.nd third class
m0I'e
a sufficient amount to Justify the require
ment that they shall have no other busl
"e'sf,
and
s-
logical to do this-
than to classify the fourth class post
masters, for the reason that the fourth
class postotflces are Invariably small, and""
the postmasters are necessarily men who
must combine some other business with
the postmastershlp, whereas the first, sec-
'«ni
third class postmasters are paid
that they shall devote their at-
tention to their postofflce duties. To clas
sify first, second, and third class post
masters would require the passage of an
act changing the method of their aD
pointment so as to take away the neces
sity for the advice and consent of the Sen
ate.
The Franking Privilege.
The unrestricted manner in which the
franking privilege is now being used by it
the several federal services and by con-
gress has laid it open to serious abuses,
a fact clearly established through ln-*
vestigations recently instituted bv the de
Partment. While it has been impossible
without a better control of franking to
determine the exact expense to the gov
ernment of this practice, there can be no-,
doubt that it annually reaches into the^
millions. It Is bel:eved that many abuses
of the franking system could be prevent
ed and consequently a marked economy Tr
effected, by supplying through the agen-'\
cies of the postal grvvico special official
envelopes and stamps for the free"mall,
of the government, all such envelopes and
stamps to be issued, on requisition to the
various branches of the federal service
requiring them, and such records to be
kept of all official stamp supplies as will'.'
