all tho members of the Senate aa well as
of the Hou-e bein?? present, and Ibe
?desks of many of them being adorned
With flowers. There were so many of
euch decorations that tbe two
floors looked like Sower gardens
and the obsence of them from
others vies noticeable. Amon.
those undecorated was tbat of Mr.
Rixey, the Representativo of the Alex?
andria district, though he haa favored
as many people here as any other Con?
gressman. The flowers, of course,
were rent by those wbo had receiv?
ed congressional favors. All the Vir?
ginia Representatives and both tbe

Tbe first bills introduced in the

Texa?, objected to the admission of
Mr. Connor, ol Iowa, to succeed Mr.
Dolliver, tbe new Senator, on the
ground that Mr. Dolliver'j resignation

takes etlect today, thon the election of
Mr. Connor was illegal, because Mr.
Dolliver was still the representative ol

PRESIDENT'S ME-SAGE.
Tbe messige of tho President was
lead in Congress today.
Tbe President begins bis message by
commenting briefly upon tbe strength,
prosperity and integrity of tbe country,
calling attention to tbe incre.se in
population since tbe beginning of tbe
century. When the sixth Congress as?
semble! in November, 1800 tbe POP*?
talion was 5 308,483. Il U now 7(5.304,?

upon the persons and properly of un
offending eojourners which from time
to time occurred at widely separated
points in the north? rn provinces, as in
the case of the outbreaks in Szjchuen
and Shan-lung." Tbe President then
outlines the d.v -lopment of tho Boxer
movement and tbe efiorts of the repre?
sentatives ot the powers in Pekin to
check it, their protesto and demands
upon the Chinese government however
ooly being met with perfuuctory edicts
from the palace and evasive and futile
assurances from the Tsung li Vamen.
The United fi?tes from tbe earliest
days of foreign intercomr.-e with China
had followed a policy of peace, omitting
no occasion to testify good v?ill to fur?
ther tba extension of lawful trade and
to insure by all l?gitimit? end kindly
but earnest means tbe fullest measure
of protection for the lives and property
ot our law abiding citizens among the
Chinese people. "To these ends I
caused," says tbe President, "to be ad?
dressed to tbe eeveral powers o copy?
ing territory and maintaining spheres
ofirflueoce in China tbe circular pro?
posals of 1899, inviting from them dec?
larations of their intentions and views
as to the desirability of the adoption of
measi_iv3 insuring the benefits of
equality of treatment of all foreign
trade throughout Cnina. Witb grati.
ing unanimity tbe responses coincided
in this common policy. Seeking to
testify confidence in tbe willingness and
ability of tbe imp-rial administration to
redrees tbe wrongs and prevent tbe
evils we su*jt?>d and feared, the Marine
Quard, which had been sent, to Pek:n
in the autumn of ISEO, was withdrawn
at tbe Ot-liMt practicable moment, and
all pending qu.??ti_Q3 were remitted, a
far as we were concern?d, to tbe ordi?
nary reports of diplomatic intercourse."
Tnen, recounting bow the Chinese gov?
ernment had proved unable to check
the Borers 2nd appeared to be a prey
to internal dissentioa, the President
leads up to tbe combined naval demon?
stration in Cainese waters by the other
powers, stating tbat while the United
States did not participate in tbe com?
bined demonstration, wo promptly sent
from the Philippine; all ships tbat
could be spared for servies ou Ibe
Chinese c.asf. Marines weie landed
at Taku snd sent to Pekin f.r tbe pre?
lection ot tb?i American Lojation, tbe
other powers taking maila? action, but
still toe peril increased. 1 ? referrine
to the attack ?poo the Taku forts by
the powers tua President make:'
qui'.e prominent the f_0t tbat
tbe Americau Admiral took no pin
in the afluir on the ground lhat we
were not at war with China and
that a hostile demonstration m'gbt
consolidate anti-foreign elements and
thus strengthen thy ? ixers to oppose
tbe relievinii column. l'ho message
continues: "The siege aud tbe relief
of tho legations has pa .-.?ed into un?
dying history. In all thestirriug chap?
ter wbich records the heroism of tne
devoted band, clinging to hope in tbe
faoa of (bo^oir, and tho undaunted
spirit that led their relievers through
b.ttle andsuflerlog to th? goal, it is a
memory of which my countrymen m-iy
be justly proud that the honor (four
flig was maintained alike in the siege
and tbo re-cue, and that stout Ameri?
can hearts havo a^_ln ept high, in fer?
vent emulation witb true meo ci otnor
race and language, the indomitable
courage that ever strives for tbe cause
of right and justice." After a brief
resume of tue attacks upon the lega?
tions, tbe killing of the German minis?
ter, liaron y.n Kefteler, arid the means
of defence adopted by tbe besieged, in
the course of wbich be refer, to tbe gal?
lent sortie led by C?pt. Myers of tbe U.
S. Matine Corp-, ihe President relates
tbe history of the joint relief expedi?
tion. In this connection he My?)
"The United r?t*tes toldiers, Snil
or_ and marines, officers and meo
alike, in those distant climes
and unu-ual eurrouudin.p. show?
ed the samo valor, di-cipline and good
conduct and gave proof of the same
high degree of intelligence and ef?
ficiency whici have distinguished them
in every eiueigoncy" In regard to tbe
settlement of the Chine. _ .?ue-;tion by
the powers the President favors tbe
Russian proposition looking to tbo rei?
teration of the imperial power in
Pekin. He say., however, tbat for
real culprits, those wbo have mUled
tbe imperial judgment and diverted
the eovereigo authority to their own
guilty ends, full expiation becomes im?
perative within tue rational limits of
retributive justice. He looks upoi. the
matter of indemnity for our wron.ed
citizens as p question of grave concern.
He is disposed to thlik tbat compensa?
tion may be made in part by the open?
ing of ?-ina to the equal commerce of
all the world.
The President then devotee several
pages to our ?estions with other
powers, touching upon tue ar.ecto* our
naturalized citizens by the Austrc Hun?
garian government for alleged evasion
o? military service, the expansion of
trade between this country and South
America, the disturbances in Colombia
and the recognition of tbe new govern
ment by tbe United Sfa'es; also similar
recognition of tbe new Dominican gov?
ernment. The success of our participa,
tio? in the Paris Exposition was reveal?
ed by the number of awards granted to
American exhibitors by the internation?
al jury, namely, grand prizes, 240; gold
medals, 597; silver ni.dal.?, Tffk bronze
medals, 541, and honorable mentions,
322?2,476 io all, b.iog the greatest to-:
vai number given to any exhibiting
nation.
The President expresses his satisfac
tion over our pleasant reUions with I
tbe German Empire, and fell? itntes tbe I
country upon the good retail ? iccruing |
from the settlement of ll*e Samoan
problem. Heconfidenlly e? prestes the
hope tbat tbe infoic-mtnt of the im?
perial meat inspection law will be free
from the discriminations prevailing
under tbe old statutes. ''Much will de?
pend," be says, "upon regulations not
jet promulgated." His parnrraph ou
the war in --Outh Aiiicaia confined lo
a legal discussion of (ho matter ol al
leg'-il contraband cargoes.

or eix thousand troop? ia Cuba cannot
be withdrawn or materially diminished
and certainly not until the conclusion
of tbe labors of tbe Cocstiluiionol Con?
vention and a government provided by
tbe new constitution eball bave been
established ar.d its stability assured.
Nor is tbere room for further reduction
in Porto R'.co where tbe garrisons now
number 1,035 men, wbich includes
879 native troops. "We will be re?
quired." he says, "to keep a consider?
able force in tbe Philippinu Islands for
some time to come. From tbe best in?
formation obtainable we will need
tbere for tbe immediate future from
45,000 to 00,000 men. I am 6Uro the

be _iven to raise native troop?: in tbe

highly commended luv its faithful and

Operatioi e in the field end the iilicult

Tho navy is similarly complimented
upon ils services in connection with ihe
insurrection in the Philippines and

The President expreeses bis gratifica
tion upon the setti ment of the long
pending ?.?"lestion of armor plate m-iuu
