While tho occurrences in which u comparatively
auj.il! uumbcr of Indians w ere engaged are most
deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian popula
tion have fully justified the expectations of those
who believe that hy humane and peaceful iullu
eners tin- Indians cau be led to abandon the habit*
of savayc life ami to develop a eapacity for civil
ised occupation*. What they have already ac
complished in the pursuit of agricultural and
mechanical work, the remarkable success which
has attended the experiment of employing us
freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted
among the wildest and most intractable, aud the
general and urgent desire expressed by tlu ui for
the education of their children, may be taken a*
sufficient proof that tin y will be found capable
of accomplishing much more if they coipiuue to
IK- wisely and lnirly guided by the Indian policy
sketched in the report of tin- secretary of the in
terior, the object of which is to make liberal
provision for th» education of Indian vouth ; I
to settle the Indians upon farm lot* in"sever
altv ; to give them title in fee to their farm*
inalienable for a certain number of vears; sud j
when their wants are provided for to dis
posed by sale of tin- lands on their reservations '
not occupied aud UM-iI bv them ; a fund to be !
.formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the
Indians which will gradually relieve the govern
ment of the expenses now provided for by an
sua! appropriation, must commend itself as just
and beneficial to the Indians aud as also calcu
lated to remove those obstructions which fne ex '
istciicc of large reservations prevents, to the set- :
tkinent ami development of the country. I I
therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of i
a law enabling tin- government to give Indians a
title in fee inalienable for twenty live years to i
the farmlands assigned to tluni by allotment, I
and a.'so repeat the recommendation made in my
rfirst annual message, that a law be passed ad
milting ludians, who can give satisfactory proof
->t having, by their own tabor, supported their
families lor a number of years, and who are will

lions, to the beiiclit of the lioiucrdcud act, aud to I
grant them patents containing the same provi- I
anon of inalienability for a certain period. Tho 1

AOBICI • LrfISAL INTEREST a.
-M.v recommendations in former ines
s are renewed in favor of enlarging
the facilities of the department of agnet 1-
tiir". Agriculture is tho lead ins- interest
and the pornianent industrv of our peo
ple. it is to the ahimdanc of agricultural
prodnetioii as compared with out home
consumption and the largely increased
and highly profitable maiket abroad
w'liieii we have enjoved in recent vears
thutwearo mainly i'-dolited for our pre
sent prosperity us a people. We must
look i ir us continued m lintuinan :e to the
same substantial resources. There is no
hruneli of industrv in which labor direct
ed hy s.-i ai'ilir knowledge yields siie.i
in.-leased p odu- tion with unskilled labor,
mid no brunch at' thy public service to
which the en.uuragenient of liberal ap
propriations em lie more appropriately
e\t- mled. The omission to render such
ni l is n ,t a wise economy, but, on the
contrary, lindouhtedlv results in losses
ol iiiim. use sums annii illv that might lie
saved through well directed dibits by the
government to promote this vital interest.
I In-results already accomplished with
t he limited means heretofore placed at the
command of the department of agricul
ture is an earnest of what may lie expected
w jih increased appropriations for the sev
eral purposes indicated in the report of
the commissioner with a view to placing
the department upon a footing which w ill
enable it to prosecute more ell'cctivelv the
objects for which it is established.' Ap
propriations are needed for a inoic com
plete laboratory, for the establishment ol
a veterinary division and a division of for
estry. and for an increase of force. The
reinforcements for these and other pur
poses indicated in the report herewith
.submitted, of the immediate necessities of
the department, will not involve any ex
penditure ot money that tlio country can
not with propriety now undertake in the
interest ot agriculture.
Eprc.vno.v.u, MATTEBS.
It is ffratifyimt to learn from tho -.urean
| of edueation the extent to which educa
tional privileges throuirhout the United
States have been advaneeddnrimr the year.
No more fundamental responsibility- rests
upon ennj-rc: s than that of devising ap
i propriate measures of financial aid to ed
ueation, supplemental to local action in
the states and territories and the District
i of ('olunibiii.
i The wise forethought of the founders of
| our government has not only furnished
j the basis lor the support of the comnion
sehool systems of the newer states, l ot
laid foundations for the foundations for
the maintenance of their universities and
colleges of agriculture and tlie mechanical
I nrts—pleasures in aeeordaneo with tliis
1 traditional policy. The further benefit
| of all these interests and the extension of
the same advantages to every portion of
I the country, it is hoped will receive vour
favorable consideration
HIE NATIONAL LIBRARY.
To preserve and perpetuate tlie national
literature should be among the foremost
cares of the national legisluture. The li
. brary gathered at tho capital still remains
, unprovided with nnv suitable aceonimo-
I dations for its rapidly increasing stores.
Tlie niagnitude and importance of the col
lection increased as it is by the deposits
made under the law of copyright bv do
; most ie and foreign exelmnges, and hy the
1 seientitie library of th 3 Smithsonian insti
tution, call for building aeeommodalions
which shall be at once equal and lirc
, proof. The location of such a public build
l mg which should provide for the pressing
necessities df the present and for tlie vast
; increase of tho nation's books in the fu
ture, is a matter which addresses itself to j
the discretion of congress. It is earnestly !
1 recommended as a measure which should
i unite all sull'iages and which sliou'd 110 '•
longer be delayed. 1
Till: WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
The joint commission created bv tlie act
of congress of August 12. 187(1. for the pur
pose ot supervising and directing tho com
pletion of the Washington national 11101111-
nieut. ot which eommission tho president
is a nioinbor. lias given careful attention
to .Ins Mibjeet and already the strengthen
ing ot the ioiindatioii has so far progressed
as 10 insure the entire success of tiiis part
ol the work. A massive lavi rof mason
ry has been introduced below tlie original
inundation, widening the base, increasing
the stability of the structure and render
ing it possible t» carry tlie shaft to eoin
pbtion. It is earnestly recommended
l.iat such further appropriations he made
lor the continued proseeution of the work
as may be neeessarv for tlie eomidetion
of this national monument at an early
day.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
In a former message, impressed with
the importance of tho subject, I have taken
oe-easion to recommend to eoicios tlie
adoption of a generous poliev t<rwai d tlie
.listnet ot Columbia. The report cl itic
e itninissioners ol tlie district herewith
transmitted, contains sugg stions and re
eoinmen lations, to all ol whieli 1 earnest
ly invite your careful attention. I ask
>■'"{■ ,u !'y and lavorable consideration
ol tlie ;ii ws \vliieli they express: to the
uiaent iii-ed ol legislation for tiie reclama
tion ol the marshes of the l'otomae and
its eastern branch, within tiie limits of the
ei.y. and tor tlie repair of tlie streets of
1 1 ' ■'•'l'dol. licit tolore laid with wooden
mocks and , 10 w by decay rendered almost
iiupassiole and a source of imminent
iiaii«4t*r tu the he .ltli Dl* its citizens. The
means at tlio disposal of the coininissiou
er, are wholly inadequate for the aeeoni
pilsliuient ot those important works aud
s.ioul,, , suppi.-n: ailed 1} limelv appro
pnations from the federal treasury. The
U 'yis tue 'lilts at the 11 ont 111 ihe eit V
v. .11 add lo toe Villi.' of adjaeeut iaiu/s
and parks now owned by'the United
States, a la rye ami valuable domain so Hi
eient, it is thought. to rciinbitrso its entiri
cost, ami will also as an incidental rcsnli
meurethe (STinaiient improvement of tin
li\ or for the purpose of na\ i.ation.
Having iu\ ested rongi-css with supreme
ami exclusive jurisdiction over the district
of Columbia, its ••iti/.eiis must of liceessitv
look to congress abai ■ for all needful leg
islatioli all'ecting tlieir interests, and all
the territoiv of t nis district is tin? common
property ol the people of the United
St: tes. who, cipiullr with its resident citi
zens, are interested in the prosperity ol
tlieir capital. I cannot doubt that you will
be amply sustained by the general voice
of the country in any measure you mav
adopt for this purpose. I also Invite the
favorable consideration ot countess to the
wants ot the puluie schools of this district
as exhibited in the report of the commis
sioners. While the number of pupils is
rapidly increasing. no adeipiate provision
exists' for a correspniidinir increase ot
school accommodation, and the commis
sioners are u itliout the means to meet this
urgent need. A number of the buildings
now used for school purposes are rented
and are in inijMutant particulars tinsuited
for tie- purpose. Tile cause of popular
education in the district of Columbia is
surely entitled to tlics tine consideration
at the hands of tic national government
as in the several states and territories, to
which magnificent grants of the public
lands have been made tor He endowment
of schools and universities.
