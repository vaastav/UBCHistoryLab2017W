FIRS
HE IS EXPECTED TO REPLY
Resolution of the "Spanking
Committee" Unanimously
Adopted.
Ilj United rrr.
WASIIIXHTOX, I)W. lS.-The report
m tla- President's annual message
agreed upon by tlie "Spanking" Com
mittee of the House yesterday, ealls
upon the President to submit to the
Hoiim- the information upon uhieh he
based the insinuation that the incmlx-rs
of the lloue were afraid of being in-
estimated by the secret .service.
-Mr. ltennet of New Wk moved to
strike out a paragraph of the resolu
tion to the effect that the President's
language was a plain intimation that
Congressmen were afraid of an investi
gation by the secret service. The par
agraph, however, when put to a vote,
was carried. 270 to 14. and the resolu
tion was then accepted unanimously.
Tin- Senate resolutions were in line
with those of the House. Xo actual re
buke icsolution is possible of adoption
until after the holidays. The Iielicf is
strong among the friends of the Presi
lent that he will not plead that the
iiiiiiiissiuu ui lMe records would lie in
compatible with the public good, and
that he will send over what he has in
hand. It is rumored he has plenty of
ammunition.
Senate Dislikes Espionage.
The leal purpose of the Senate in-
est ig-.it ion in the secret service is to
stop the system of espionage over pub
lic persons, it is said. Many of the
"ongr men resent this spring and say
the present administration keeps watch
oer them surpassing that of the Czar '
over suspected subjects.
President Roosevelt is preparing to
answer the llou-c's request for infor
mation leg.irding the secret service work
after the holidays. A corps of clerks
is collecting data and it is understood
that a detailed report will Ik- given of
every ae where secret service has Wen
used. I lie Pifsidciit says lie does not
regaid the request as a rebuke, but on
the other hand, thinks Congress needs
enlightenment on the work of the e-
r. t -ervice.
Text of Resolution.
The resolution reads as follows:
"Whereas. There was contained in
the sundry civil appropriation bill
whiih passed Congress at its hist ss--ion.
and became a law. a refeience
to employment of the secret service in
the Treasury Department, and.
"Whereas. In the last annual mes
sage ol the I'ri'sident ol the Lulled
States to the llou-e of Congress, it
was stated in rcfcicm-e to the pro-i-ioii:
""The amendment (to the -eeret
-nice lawl in question was of benefit
to no one excepting to those crimin
als ami it seriously hampers the Gov
ernment in the detection of crime and
the seeming of ju-tice. In the pre-ent
form the restriction oK-rates only to
the advantage of the criminal or the
wrongdoer. The thief argument in
favor of the provision was that the
congressmen did not themselves
wi-h to 1- investigated by secret ser
vice men"; and.
"Whereas. The plain meaning of the
nlioie words is that the majority of
Congressmen were in fear of being in
vestigated by secret service men. and
that Congre . as a whole, was actuated
by that motive in enacting the pro
visioti in question; and.
No Justification of Charge.
"Whereas, Your committee appoint
ed to consider these statements of the
President and to report to the House
cannot find in the hearings before the
committee nor in the record- of the
llou-e or Senate any justification of
the impeachment of the honor and in
tegrity of Congrcs-: and.
"Whereas. Your committee would
prefer, in order to make an intelligent
and eomprehi-n-ive report, jii-t to the
President a- well a- to Congress, to
have all the information wlncli un'
President may have to communicate:
now. therefore. lie it
"Kc-olved. That the President W re
quested to transmit to the House any
evidence Uon which lie ba-ed his state
ment that the chief argument in favor
of the provision was that the Congress
men did not thcm-elves wish to W in
