Nine Persons
Seriously III
Augusta, Ga., Dec. 4.?A sequel
?to the Beldoc mystery in which the
wife and three children of J. W.
Lee, a prominent planter, died
suddenly a few weeks ago of a
strange malady believed at the time
to have been caused by poison, has
taken place at Martin, S. C., about
fifteen miles from Allendale, ac
cording to information received in
Augusta today, stating that nine
persons are desperately ; ill at a
boarding house there after eating
biscuits made from flour taken from
the Lee home at Beldoc.
The peculiarity of the situation
is the affairs occurred at the
boarding house of Mrs. R. F.
Creech, who is a sister-in-law of J.
W. Lee, who now lies ill at. the Uni
versity Hospital here. J
. Officials state that following the
death of Mrs. Lee and the removal
of Mr. Lee to a hospital, Mrs.
Creech went to the Lee home and
removed a sack of flour and other
groceries which she took to her
home in Martin. Biscuits made
from the flour were served to her
boarders and it is said that all who
ate of the biscuits were taken ill,
the symptoms being similar to those
in the Lee case.
Doctors called to administer to
the sick worked on the theory that
their illness was caused by
ptomaine poisoning from canned
goods, although some of those af
fected claim that they did not par
take of the tinned salmon.
Sheriff Bennett tonight, however,
declared that he favored the the
ory of the doctors but to be pu the
safe side would have samples of the
flour analyzed.

District Attorney Will
Present to . Grand
Jury Charge That
Attempt Was Made
j To Intimidate Juror
_
San Francisco, Dec. 5.?Milton
TJren, assistant district attorney,
announced today that he would lay
before the grand jury tonight the
charges by Mrs. Helen M. Hubbard,
one of the two jurors who voted for
the conviction of Roscoe Arbuckle,
that efforts were made to Intimi
date her into changing her vote.
The federal charge against Ar
buckle, based on the alleged ille
gal transportation of liquor and
charges of pejury against Mrs.
Minnie Xeigrhbors, of Los Angeles,
defense witness, in Arbuckle's man
slaughter trial, are still to be heard
Mistrial in
Arbuckle Case
San Francisco, Dec. 4.?After 41
hours of deliberation the jury, com
posed of seven men and fire wo
men, which tried Roscoe C. Ar
buckle on a charge of manslaughter
in connection with the d^ath of
Virginia Rapp'e, was discharged to
day when it was unable to agree
upon a verdict.
The jury was brought into court
at its own request at noon, reported
a disagreement and asked that it
be dismissed.
August Fritze, foreman of the
Arbuckle jury, issued a signed
statement tonight saying that one
of the women jurors, who was in
the minority, refused to consider
the evidence from the beginning
and declared that "she would cast
her ballot and would not change it
until hell froze over."
There were two jurors who voted
for conviction according to Fritze.
Prison Breakers
Captured
Columbia, Dec. 5.?A prison de
livery was nipped in} the bud at the
state penitentiary today when two
bad prisoners, C. D. Cooper, a mur
derer from Marlboro county and
Harry Gates, a man- sent from
Spartanburg for five years on a
charge . of safe cracking, were
found hiding between the ceiling
and the first roof of one of the
prison buildings. They disappeared
Sunday and were found this. morn
ing. They had cut their way
through the second roof of .the
building and were hiding over the
ceiling, where they had a store of
canned goods sufficient for a week's
sustenance.
.While searching for these men
the prison authorities discovered
how Jack Fields, a Spartanburg
prisoner who got away last week,
made his getaway. They found an
old abandoned sewer under the
shop where Field's worked' into
which he had dug an entrance,
I storing canned(goods, and here he
j lived until the extra guard on the
j walls, placed when he disappeared,
j was relieved, when he climbed the
j walls of the prison and escaped.
! The cleverness with which the en
; trance to the sewer had been cov
j ered up made it almost beyond
! detection.
The Older Boys' Conference.
Columbia, Dec. 5.?The great
success,of the state 'Older Boys*
j Conference held in Columbia last
week, which had an attendance
of over 3u0 from outside Colum
bia, leads to the decision to have
two conferences next year, one in
Greenville and one in Charleston.

i _ I
The meeting to formulate plans!
looking to the organization of the
Woman's Auxiliary to the American
Legion was held yesterday at the i
! auditorium of the Girls' High |
I school building with only a small
'attendance. It was decided to make
immediate application for a char
ter but to postpone final organiza
tion until Wednesday, January 4th, j
'1922, at which time itis hoped to
! have a larger representation pres
I ent. While the petition for charter i
I only requires ten names. ;t was the j
! opinion of those present that gold j
I star mothers and wives be given an >
j opportunity to become charter j
members of the Sumter Auxiliary. :
All mothers whose sons made the i
supreme sacrifice in the world j
war and wives whose husbands
gave their lives to the cause of
' freedom, are urged to get in touch
j with either Joe S. Chandler, com- j
mander of the Sumter Post, or John i
B. D?the, chairman of the Auxil- j
iary committee at once if they de
sire to become charter members of j
the Sumter Auxiliary. Those in
charge of final organisation believe
that the proposed auxiliary should i
be able to start off with one of the !
largest memberships in the State, j
With this end in view each person
present at yesterday's meeting was ;
appointed a committee of one to j
secure the names of all mothers,!
wives and sisters of ex-service men ?
residing in Sumter county and they;
will be notified of the time and!

Resolutions Passed by the Sumter i
Bar Association on the Death of ?
John II. Clifton. *
"Whereas, John H. Clifton, long a '
leader at the Bar of this county, ;
and for many years its senatorial
representative in the general as
sembly of the state, was claimed
suddenly by death on the Cth day
of November, 1921, while at the
very zenith of his intellectual pow
ers, and in the full current of suc
cess in the practice of his profes
sion, and
Whereas, information thereof has
been formally communicated to the
members of the Sumter Bar Asso
ciation, assembled in special meet
ing on the 7th day of November,
1921, now therefore be it
Resolved, That the Sumter Bar
Association learns with the deepest j
grief and regret of the untimely
termination of this brilliant and
noteworthy career;
That in the death of John H.
Clifton his state has lost a public
servant whose able mind and con- i
scientidus regard for its interests j
were of inestimable value to it in j
the performance of the legislative
functions of government;
That the Bar of his county and of \
his state have lost from their ranks I
a lawyer whose understanding of j
the law was broad, enlightened and ;
profound, and whose genius as a!
practitioner was such that he would
have been marked a figure of dis- j
tionction at the Bar of any state,!
and in any time;
That the community in which he
made his home has lost a citizen j
acutely conscious of his civic duty, !
whose energies and whose funds j
were ever at the disposal of any!
cause which had for its object the
public good;
That his friends have lost a bril
liant and lovable associate and
companion,? whose abundant sym
pathies'and whose constant flow of:
clear thought and keen and origin- {
al humor did 'much to brighten the ;
rough and darkened pathway of'
life for all around him, one who !
possessed as an attribute of his re- J
markable personality the ability to ,
create in the hearts of all who I
knew him the desire to win and
retain his approbation;
That the poor and oppressed
have lost a friend and protector, I
whose substance and whose able
services were theirs for-the asking:
?if their destitution was actual
and their needs great?one whose j
heart was powerless to resist the '
appeal of helplessness and distress,!
one who can contemplate without |
fear the admonition, "In as much
as ye have done it unto the least j
of these ye have done it even unto j
Me."
Be it Further
Resolved: That the warmest
sympathy of this Ear, in the great '
sorrow which they are called upon I
to boar, be communicated forth
with to the widow and children of
the late Senator John H. Clifton, I
and that they be assured that their!
grief and sense of irreparable loss '
arc widely and deeply shared:
And be it Further
Resolved: That ? copy of these
resolutions be spread upon the
records of the court, and that aj
copy thereof be delivered to the
family of the deceased.
Respectfully submitted,

fn Momorian Lucian Winter Mc-.
Lemore.
Lucian Winter McLernore, Esq., j
passed away in the city of Sum
ter on the night of December 6th,,
1920. His death was attended with
unusual sadness as it came to him
suddenly, away from his family
and friends, and while he was in
the prime of physical life and in
tellectual vigor. He was born in
Augusta, Ca.. about 18S6 and his
parents dying when he was at an
early age, he was deprived of that |
tender love, consideration, and care j
at-that formative period, which :
should always leave its impress
upon li."-- and character. Under
hard circumstances young McLe
more had to obtain what education '
and training v/as available in the j
city schools of that time, and sub- j
seouently without any other means!
ro make his way in life. He had j
the determination to succeed, and'
in leisure moments read and.
studied much. He was filled with |
the ambition to be a lawyer. Ho
studied law in the offices of Messrs.
Willcox and Willcox of Florence.
S. C., and his success especially in!
corporation law was phenomenal, j
He reached the rank of Division j
Counsel of the Atlantic Coast Line!
Railroad within two or three years j
of his admission to th<- bar:
Whereas, his untimely death
came as :i shock and a painful epi- i
socle t<> tin- Ear and the commun
i i y:
it Therefore Resolved that!
in the death <d' Lucian Winter Mc
Lernore. Es-*., the Bar of Sumter!
deplores the loss of an advocate of1
unusual ability: a thorough law-,
yer hi his work, of keen pcrcep-;
lions, who had the most desirable':
gift of the clearest and most logi
cal and lucid language: who had
a high ideal of the ethics of th<
profession: one who was always fair
in his practice and thoughtful and j
considerate of his fellow prac
titioners; who hail the faculty of
making and retaining many friends,
who were brightened and entertain
ed by the brilliance of his intel
lect and the cheerfulness of his
spirit.
Resolved that for the purpose of
placing upon record the apprecia
tion and sentiments of the Kar of ;
Sumter, these resolutions be in
scribed upon the minutes of the j
court.
Resolved That a copy of the!
same be transmitted to the family |
of the deceased, and published in
the daily paper.

The third and greatest cf the
three annual meetings of the Old
er Boys' conferences which was j
held in Columbia this year, came to j
a close last night with the evening
session at the First Presbyterian !
church. The feature of this last j
session was the address by j

lumbia began and the 359 boys,
representing 61 different communi- j
ties throughout the state, that were
present at the conference, returned
to their homes, taking with them
the inspiration to better lives and ;
more Christian work. There were |
twenty-six boys representing Sum- j
ter and these splendidly chosen !
young men brought credit to them- j
selves and to their town by their j
exemplary conduct while in Colum
hia and by the most creditable
showing which they made at the j
various meetings.
This conference was declared a
most] splendid and successful one j
and. was indeed crowned with ;
what, is bound- to be a great and
lasting good among our future citi- j
zens, ;, our bovs.

Bequest For
Christmas Fund
Will of George W. Reardon
Provides Bequest of $500
Jn the will of the late George W.
Reardon, of Sumter. who died last
Saturday, provision is made for
turning over to the City Council of
Sumter the sum of five hundred
dollars to be invested and the in
terest ther- from applied ro th<* an
nual Chrisimas collection for the
poor of Sumter. or to be used at
any other rime of the year for the
poor in the discretion of City
Council.
In this bequest, small though it
be in comparison, to other and larg
er contributions, running as high as
five thousand dollars for The an
nual Christmas found for the poor,
it might not be amis; to call at
tention to the fact that Mr. Rear
don has established a precedent
that if adopted by other charitably
inclined citizens, be the contribu
tions large or small, might even
tually' lead to th-> founding of a
large sum of money for the chari
table work among the poor, the
public appreciating small bequests
as much as the Iargrer contribu
tions, a
Not being', or not feeling able,
perhaps, to contribute five thou
sand dollars. Mr. Reardon did not
stand on the looks of the les
ser amount, bat did the best that he
could, no doubt feeling that every
five hundred dollars left for the
benefit of the poor means just thai
much more in the aggregate an
nual interest to be distributed
among the needy and the afflicted.
Burn or Plow Under Cotton Plants
To Control Boll Weevil
The great destruction wrought
by the cotton boll weevil this year
has made the problem of its con
trol a vital one to practically ali
cotton planters. Everywhere th*
question is heard, "What can he
done to avoid this Jess next year?''
For many years prior to the de
velopment of poison-control meas
ures the United States Department
of. Agriculture advocated fall de
struction of cotton plants by burn
ing or plowing under, as* the most
important step in controlling the
boll weevil. It is still good practice
as an auxiliary to control by poison.
The proper time for the destruc
tion of the plants in the fall is
whenever the weevils have become
so numerous that there is no pros
pect that any more cotton will i?e
made. It is an easy matter for ary
planter to determine this point by
an examination of a few plants in
his field. Whene\er it is found that
all. or nearly all. o-" the squares ana
some of the bolls are being punc
tured, there is no hope for produc
ing any mor? coiton. The farmer
should then wait until tiie bolls al
ready set on the plants have*opened,
and destruction should then :.ak\,
place immedialoH.
By all means, if possible, de
struction of plants should tak-2
place before fro&t, but destruction
after frost, th'-ugh not nearly as
efficacious as early destruction,
should always ho practiced; when :t
it has n.>t been possible to remove
the plants j reviotisly. The plants
should be phev.-d under deeply, or
completely destroyed by fire. No
sprout cotton should be left to fur
nish breeding p'aces for the weevils.
There are four principal reason5
why the process of fall destruction
should be practiced universally by
planters in infested regions:
First. Fall destruction prevents
absolutely the development of a
multitude of weevils which would
otherwise become adult within a
few weeks of the time of hiberna
tion. The destruction of the imma
ture stages of weevils in infested
squares and bolls is accomplished,
while the further growth of squares
which may become infested later is
prevented. This stops materially
the development of weevils which
would normally hibernate success
fully, and by decreasing the nun:
ber of weevils which will emerge in
the spring the chances for a suc
cessful crop the following season
are very greatly increased.
Second. A proper manipulation
of the stalks will bring about the
destruction of a great majority of
the weevils which are already aduiv.
Third. It has been shown con
clusively that the bulk of the wee
vils which suriviye the winter are
those which reach maturity late in
the season. It is evident that the
weevils that pass the winter and
attack the crop of the following
season are among those developed
latest in the fall and which, in con
sequence of that fact, have not ex
hausted their vitality by depositing
eggs for any considerable length
of time. Fall destruction of the
plants, increasing the length of the
hibernating period, reduces many
fold the number of weevils in the
field that would otherwise emerge
in spring to damage the cotton.
Fourth, ("learing of the field in
the fall makes it possible to prac
tice fall plowing, which is not only
the proper procedure in any systen.
of cotton raising, but also greatly
facilitates the early planting of the
crop the following spring. The
ground becomes clean by this prac
tice, so that but few places for
shelter are left for the weevils,
and various climatic conditions
still further reduce the number of
the survivors.
The early planting of the crop
next spring and the use of an ear
ly maturing variety are also strong
ly urged. The fall destruction of
plants will reduce the number of
we. vils which will survive the win
ter. By getting the cotton crop
started early it is often possible to
get it wei' on the way to matur
ity before the few weevils surviv
ing the winter have time to propa
gate to the point where they be
come destruct Lve.
Destroy the cotton plants in the
fall and plant early the following
spring.

Washington, Dec. 5.?Congress
convened at noon teday for the

pressed for action by their spon

President Harding plans to give
his message to the new session
Tuesday. Xew and added promi
nence is attached to the event from
the fact that, probably for the first
time in American history, the mes

the presence of'members of an in-,
ternatlonal conference. Many cf
the delegates to the conference on
armaments ire expected to attend.
Any action by the conference on
naval or army reduction is regarded
as certain to be reflected in appro
priation bills for these services
and leaders say there probably
will be frequent outbreaks of dis
cussion on the floor concerning the
arms conference and its doings.
