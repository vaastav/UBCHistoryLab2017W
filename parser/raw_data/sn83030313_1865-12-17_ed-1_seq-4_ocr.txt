the government and people of the province of New
Brunswick tiave been seriously agitated recently by ap
prehensions of a Fenian raid from the t'nited states. It
ta said that the first intimation was given in a despatch
pt the tth in*t. from the British Minister In Washington
jfo the Lieutenant Governor of the colony. The latter
functionary immediately set in motion defensive opera
tions and started in person for the frontier. Organiza
i of the volunteers was commenced, a war steamer
i despatched from Halifax to St. John, fresh dlsposi
is were made of troops, the Iocs' authorities and bank
En of tbs thr-at-ened towns btld excited consults
and for the time the anti-F?nian war fever was
erred from Canada to the New Brunswick border;
^ut there has not yst, so far as we are Informed, been
tny demonstration of the Brotherhood on that line.
t The Canadians, It appears, are not yet rendered hops
?ess by the III success which has rr> far attended their
pfforts to indues our government to renew the Reciproci
ty treaty, our Ottawa advices announcing that another
EtfegaUnn to urge its renewal will shortly leave that city
for Washington. A commissioner ha* been appointed on

SI lbs date of the last advices there were still s"me sixty

Bad flva rebels being hanged In one evening. Tbe pro

day. A resolution was adopted recognising Mr John

tested by Mr. O'Brien. The report of the Committee on
Finance of the Board or Aldermen in reference to cre
ating a market stock for the purpose or erecting a market
in the Eighteenth ward, was called up and occasioned a
lively debate. The mandamus issued by the Stiprome
Court compelling the Common Council to take action
upon the matter was presented. Farther proceedings on
the subject were postponed till Monday.

President Juhnwa't Mknftgrmrnt of HI*
Restoration Polley and the Radicals.
The coolness, adroitness and skill exhibited
by President Johnson in managing his policy
constitute one of the muit striking features of the
times. He has not only reserved all the wea
pons necessary to fortify his position, but has
made himself so completely master of the situ
ation that he is able to shape events in spite of
the opposition of the revolutionary radicals in
Congress. The latter, under the lead of Mr.
Stevens, marked out their plans In caucus,
marshalled their forces and deliberately as
sailed the President's policy; yet he oontinues
his efforts at restoration perfectly regardless
of their action, and pays no more attention to
their antics than General Grant to an army
firing popguns at his eolumns. Thus far the
fanatics in Congress have not in the least dis
turbed his equanimity, nor caused him to
abate a particle in his policy to restore the
South to its full relations in the Union. Mr.
Stevens presented his resolution in the repub
lican caucus on Saturday night, and
Hien succeeded in making it the party
shibboleth. It was endorsed and passed by
the House of Representatives on Monday,
and that, too, in the faee of the fact that Ste
vens openly asserted that fae intended to de
feat tbo policy of the President in the treat
ment of the Southern States. Ibis was accom
plished before Mr. Johnson h>d sent iu his
Mcssago. That document was sent to Congress
on tho following day, without the least modifi
cation or allusion to tho opposition presented,
just as though nothing had happened. The
Message, bucked by public opinion, has already
had its effect in both houses, as seen by tho
action of the Senate iu modifying Stevens'
resolution, and in the change in front of nine
teen republican me"mbor? oi tho lower House.
WbiW we see in all this tho reaotion in favor
of Androw Johnson's policy, wo also have
another evidence of his coolness and deter
mination to stand by his policy, as announced
in his communication, which wo published tho
other day, to the Provisional Governor of Geor
gia. Congross commenced its sssaion on the 4th
iust. On that day tho republioans in tho House
voted in a body for a resolution directly attack
ing the President's plan of reconstruction. Such
at least was tho interpretation which tho public
placed upon that resolution and the avowed
objoct of the radicals in passing it. Yet, in tho
face of this, and while its adoption was ponding
in the Senate, the President, on the 11th Inst.,
or just one week after the action of tho Houso
referred to, sent a despatch to (Jovernor John
son, of Georgia, stating, "Wo arc undor obli
gations to you for the noble, efficient and patri
otic manner in which you have discharged
your duties of Provisional Governor, and you
will be sustained by the government." There
is no mistaking the meaning of that despatoh.
Its langnag-e is too plain to admit of bnt one
interpretation. It is conclusive that the Presi
dent intends to push on his work of reorganiza
tion as heretofore marked out regardless of
what the radloals may do In Congress or what
obstacles they may try to throw in his way.
It proves that ho is not In the least alarmed at
the array of tho revolutionary taction in Con
gross, but sees his way clear and defies their
fury. Conscious of the strength ot his position,
ho stands firm and immovable. Not only does
this communication reveal his determination to
place the machinery of the looal and civil gov
ernments in a position that wiH give them tho
same control of their local affairs that Is
enjoyed by other States, but other portions
of the despatch givo some idea of his
position in regard to the question of
admitting Southern representative* in Can- 1
(tress. He requests that tbo Governor elect of
Georgia shall be inaugurated, and then asks
"Why ean't you elect a Senator?" He certainly
would not ask the election of a Senator unless
he desired his admission In the United States
Sen&te; nor would he be anxious about tho in
auguration of the Governor or election of
Senator if he contemplated yielding to the
radicals and adopting tbelr plans of treating
the Southern States as so many conquered Ter
ritories. The fow words In that despatch are
fall of moaning, significant and important. We
advise ull such theorists as Stevens, Kelley,
Sumner, FU"on and Chandler to put It In their
pipe and smoke it, and se* the defeat that
awaita thom if they continue to press their ro
voluUouary acnemes.
It is in this quiet but effect ire way that
Andrew Johnson will press on the work or res
toration. There can be no doubt of the final
result. Already wo pee its effect npon Con
gress. The Senate has rejected the most ob
jectionable portion of Stevens' resolution, nud
three republican Senator# came ont in direct
opposition to the whole. The effort to revive
tlie rejected portion In the House and make it
applicable to that body found ninetoen repub
licans who voted for the original resolution
arrayed against it. Thus the oharm is broken,
and an opening made which cannot tail to pro
duce other changes at no distant day. The re
passage by the Ilouse of the portion of the origi
nal resolution rejected in the Senate, together
with the complexion of the Howe portion of
the joint committee, reveals the fact that lift
radicals intend to pres| t^eir schemes to the
H|post extent. Out ftTnin* m*mt>erS on that
committee six are known to be extreme men,
and only three who voted against reviving that
portion of Stevens' resolution slrickon out In
the Senate. The composition of this committee
is important, as it will, in a measure, give the
oountry as well as the President some idea, not
only ol' the delay, but the obstacles which will
be thrown In the way of reconstruction. It the
Senate portion should have an eq"a) prepon
derance of the radical element, tbtn we any
look for a postponement of the question of ad
mitting Southern representatives for a long
period, or until one house or the other has be
come disgusted with its operations. But if,
as we trust will be the case, the Senate portion
presents sufficient conservative element to
overbalance the radicals on the House commit
tee, then we may look for an early solution of
the question. The Senato caucus which ia to
select the members of this committee has, there
fore, au Important task to perform, and the
people await their action with some anxiety.
After all, the public oan afford to allow the
radioals all the comfort and consolation which
they can derive in having so large a represen
tation on the joint committee. They can prob
ably delay restoration ; but we imagine that
they will And it impossible to either move the
President, swerve him one iota from his fixed
policy, or affect the flnul result. If they adopt ??
policy treating the Southern States as conquered
Territories, it will have to bo done by the pas
sage of a bill bv both house*. It will then go
to the president, and will undoubtedly receive
hia veto. Tbo ohauge which has taken plaoe in
both houses airing the first ten days of the
action indicates very cldhrly that by the
lime a bill is matdfcpd by the committee and
passed in both house* A sufficient number of
the republicans will be found voting with the
democrats to sustain the President to prevent
its passage over the President's veto in oithei
body. By that time Andrew Johnson's skilful
management, backed as ho is by the people,
will work such n revolution that the radicals
will be unable to override his veto or prevent
the admission of all Soutborn representatives
who have not mtde too objeotionable records
during the rebellion. They can postpone the
admission of the representatives; but the Presi
dent is so completely the master of the situ
ation that be will ultimately succeed. Such at
least are the indications from the ohange in
tone already taken plaoe In Congress.
A Bfow York Conservatoire of Hail*.
The time, has oome whoa this great metro
politan olty should hare a grand musical In
stitute similar to the Conservatoire of Paris.
New York is the centre of oommeroe, oi wealth,
of ideas and of art in general, and it ought. to
be of musioal education and excellence in par
ticular. It should give the laws of taste and
method to the whole oountry, as Paris does to
the European world. At prosent we hare no
standard, no great school devoted to music,
no diplomas entitling toaohors to call them
selves professors, or porformere and singers to
assume the profession as such. The academies
of music are Improperly so-called; they are
merely theatres, or at best opera houses,
where any one can perform or sing who knows
the rudiments of the art and has the presump
tion to fippear befon the public. So far from
being schools, as the name implies, they do not
even cultivate a correct fciUito, because in too
many caaoa thoy are managed by unscrupu
lous foreign adventurers and speculators, who
look only to making money by employ
ing cheap and imporfect artists. The
same may be said of tho teachers
of singing and music. Tho hundreds of this
clnss, with a few oxoeptions, who presume to
teach our children aro mere adventurers- -
mere tyros ? who are almost as much in need
of a master aB their pupils, Tho tasto for
music is universal in thia country, but it needa
propor cultivation. Thero is soaroely a house
that baa not a piano in it; and even tho ohil
dron of our mechanics take lessons in music.
Fabulous sums of money are spent annually
for the poorest kind of instruction. Yet there
is no country in the world where the desire for
a good musioal education is so general, where
the capacity for acquiring it is greater, or
where the means of paying for it is so abund
ant or would be so freely spent. We want a
higher standard of art and bettor instructors;
and the way to obtain those is by having a
musical institute of tho highest order, from
whieb all professors^ public singers and per
formers should take their diplomas.
The conservatoires of Europe? of which that
of Paris stands first? are established to preserve
the principles of musioal art in their^ purity
and to impart the highest education.
Nearly all the great singers, instrumental
performers and composers have boon
pupils of one or other of these
establishments. Moat of the great cities have
ono, though the one at Paris is oonsidered pro
em nent. The most famous artists regard it an
honor to have been pupils of this. The first .
institution of this kind was established at Na
ples as far baok as tho yoar 1350, and with a
view of giving to the ohu robes and convents
the muaioiana they wantod. Others followed
after a considerable lapse of time. The first
one* were badly organized, and needod both
professors and pupils. In 1576 aaother con
servatoire was founded in Naples, and the most
renowned masters of Italy were taught there.
The most celebrated composers of the age
came from the sohools of Naples. Afterwards
Venice created like institutions, and in 1771
there were four in that city. The Conservatoire
of Paris was established in 1793, under the
republic, and, strange to say, in the midst of
the discordant horrors of that revolutionary
period. In that year the Convention created
the National Institute of Music. But in 1795 the
title of Conservatoire was given to & A law
of the Sixteenth Thermidor, year three, fixed
the number o! professors at ono hundred and '
fifteen and the pupils at six hundred. The ex- 1
pense of the establishment was two hundred
and forty thousand francs a year. In 1802
tho number of professor*' and the annual
amount to support the institution were
| reduced. Goasee, M6hul and Chsrubinl wore
Inspectors of the Conservatoire about that time.
All the pupils lived outside the institution ex
cept twelve girls and the same number of boys,
who received a support as ptnaionn/tir**. It is
on a grand scale. There is a hall where they
give concert^ and play opera, a smaller hall
which is used ibr school exercises, and a
library which is open not only for the pupils,
but to the public. Jbe Paris Conservatoire is u
B?UWBeo? the musical giory of France. Its
method is adopted in all countries. In this
musical sanctuary they hear what can be heard
nowhere else so well ? the master pieces of
Mow^rt. of Bsethaven, of Haydn and of other
great Theff are fcixh Qugiga)
schools In other cities of France, and there are
conservatoires In Milan, Vienna, Prague, War
saw, Madrid, Munich, Berlin, Cologne and Leip
sic. Shall ws not have one in this great city
the metropolis of a mighty republican empire
and of the American continent ? Shall not the
third largest city in the civilized world have
one?
In Europe they establish and maintain such
public Institutions through government snb
ventions; we, for the most part, by Individual
means and subscriptions. Witness the numer
ous churches, hospitals, charitable institu
tions, oolleges, schools and other institutions
which are spread over the whole country.
There Is nothing in this way that cannot be
accomplished through the liberality, public
spirit and wealth of our citizens. We have
?em what an Educational Institution of a
high order has done in the late war. Every
on* appreciates now the Military Academy of
West Poiut. We see what a proud position
Paris occuptss through her Conservatoire,
Acad l' mi e des Sciences, and other institutions
of the highest order. But nothing small will
do. Ws must have a conservatoire of the most
thorough and elevated character. The pro
fessors, teachers, singers and Instrumental per
formers?even the performers in the orchestras
of our opera houses ? should be required to
have diplomas from this institute, and all others
should be r^arded a* quaclw, the -tamo as
uneducated doctors are. We btart the idi-a,
and hope our wealthy and publio-spirtted
citizens will carry it out. We might even ap
peal to the selfish motived of our people; for,
besides' the gratification and advantage this
would be to their families, it would increase
the prestige, power and wealth of New York.
Suoh institutions have done very much in
making Paris the attractive city H is? in tnak
ing it, in fact, the centre of all that is refined
and enjoyable in Europe. We lay down no
plan at present, but oall upon our citizens
to take the matter up, discuss It thoroughly
with all the light that can be obtained from
Europe, raise the money, get a proper charter
from the Legislature and establish a National
Conservatoire In the city of New York.
Oar Foreign OonrMpm<l*nt?? Coltoa and
Labor In tk? East.
By the very interesting letters from Egypt
and India given in our issue a few days ago,
our readers may traoe the effects of our war
in that remote quarter of the globe, and see
another of the ways in which the dismember
ment and ruin of the United States was ex
pected to build op the British empire.
Upon the first cotton embarrassment*, when
the war and the blockade stopped the supply
of the great staple, and it was feared that the
English mills would stand still, and the distress
of the laboring olasses would require severely
repressive measures, the importance of getting
oo t ion elsewhere became apparent. It will be
remembered that In-lia and Egypt were the
places especially named then as lands that
might eventually rival us in the cultivation of
this product The topic made it# noise in tho
British papers, and went out of sight in due
time. And now our correspondent In the East
shows us the operations of those schemes in
the places at which the experiment was made.
At Bombay U seems to have given riso to an
epidemic of speculation, and to have turned
the heads of business men as effectually as the
heads of every olaas in France were once
turned by the grand Mississippi scheme of the
financier I/aw. While the growth of cotton
wont on in the Interior every one a* Bombay
w^nt crazy with the notion that there would
not be room at that city for its shipment, und
companies were organized to r?c!atm marsh
Innds in it < precincts. The shares of these com
panies were sought with such avidity that they
rau to the greatest hoight, and mon who held
them became millionaires as tho "reclamation"
went on and the cotton business grew; but sud
denly tho war In the United States came to an
end, the prico of cotton came down, the re
claimed lands were not needed, the million
aires became beggar* in a day, and that par
ticular part of British India awoke from its
dream of aggrandizement and commercial glory
founded on rivalry with the United States.
The cotton produced in India was at best iar
inferior to the staple produced here, and that
grown in Egypt was poorer still ? so poor in
foot us to be worthless for any but the coarser
qualities of goods. The oulture in Egypt has
been abandoned since the conclusion of our
war; and It was never carrlod on with any
spooial vigor or promise in consequence of the
unfavorable oondition that labor is ^pder in
that oountry. Labor, as our correspondent
shows, is now in the Bast as it has been for
hundreds of years ? in the lowest state, and not
in its least miserable condition in the British
dominions. At Bombay it in shown that the
- laboring olasses are in a worst* state than we
in this country oan conoeivo possible even with
all the experience of the disorganizing influ
ences of emancipation. Will not the London
Times give to this subject some of those homi
lies that it loves to give to us on the various
terrible results of our wart
Th? Conditio* of Ireland? A. Penloa mil
of IpdlclmtBt Afftlmt EnglUh Hal*.
We present to-day a picture of the Irish peo
ple at home, the fidelity of which wc cannot
doubt, and which even the moat sanguine must
regard an gloomy. Oar correspondent, writing
on the spot, depicts the condition to which
centuries of misrule hare reduced a people
whose genius has brightened tho annals of the
human race, whose noblo qualities are recog
nized in every land under the sun, and who
can be crushed only in that iaiand which they
desire to call their own.
The facts that we give make a species of
Feaiaa bHl of iadfotment against English rule
over the Irish people. They show that for
nearly seven hundred years the experiment of
English rule in the Green Isle has been tried,
and that to-day the Irish refer to their oppres
sors only as the u English enemy." In all that
time the nationality of the peoplo has not given
way? It is vital still; they are not absorbed,
and do not meet the other race even in amity.
Their reftisal to be reconciled with their condi
tion? tHeir restlessness under it ? ^
vantageous legislation of ^ahd-the elfish,
arrogant, not to say unwise policy of that na
tion, so ?P??rf#hl wherever its policy is felt ?
ftU '-iiia is feat making a waste of the country;
so that it is* scarcely so mnch the question
whether the English or Irish shall govern the
country, as whether the Irish shall ?xlst in It
at all, or be driven out to make room for the
fet cattle of English landowners. Fnglspd has
hit upon the practical means to extirpate that
'?bold peasantry" that was once regarded as "a
nation's pride." Her means in Ireiand have
been simple, and she even hopes apparently to
extend them to England a%d drive the peopl#
out from that country too. She starts with the
assumption, as argued the other day in the
London Time*, that bread is better than a
national spirit, bacon better than freedom, and
beer better than the elective frnnchise. On
this platform she deprives the people of politi
cal existence, and ihen she deprives thrm of
the bread, bacon and beer for which they gave
up all else.
In view of what is shown to be the condi
tion of the Irish people at home, it cannot be
wondered at that peasantry, tradesmen and
mechanics have been fairly stampeded to this
country; nor oan it be wondered at that there
should be Fenian societies, or any other socie
ties whose object is to secure the freedom of
Ireland. Hcftrever ridiculous the antics of cer
tain foolish men in onr midst may have made
this mum appear, the great foot remains that
there are all the reasons in the world why every
Irishman should hate and with all his might
strive against England as the oppressor of his
country. But Ireland is not to be libented
in Union square. "Ii\ native swords and na
tive ranks the only hope of freedom dwells,"
and the ranks must be formed on the spot wher<?
the tvrannv has been exerciiedL

fl>rc?m?nti to MtifmllUn,
yThe re?(?nt arrival at Vec? Crua of over two '
ihott**nd French troops for the reinforcement
of J&csrimilian's constantly diminishing armies
naturally suggests the Inquiry, what does all
this mea n t The landing day after day on the
Mexican y oast of French soldiers? Algeria***,
Arabs, Taroos, Nubians, Auutriuus, Belgians
and what \ *ot ? together with mortars, slega
guns, fixed at nmunition, wagons and supplies,
surely looks IV ke anything but a contemplated
evacuation on the part of Louis Napoleon.
And then from t ur Vera Cruz correspondent It ?
appears that tbe * French officers talk as though
sent there, not to fight the Mexicans, bnt the
United States ; (ha >t they are " down on the
Yankoes that ftoe J boast " they can whip the
United States all to , P^ces that " the South
ern people will rise , again when they get the
chance," and that chance the Frenoh pro
pose to give them b j ?li 'daring war against the
United States," and' aeao
Now, how did these Fn 'och officers get these
silfy notions Into their sill) r heads ? They must
know that suoh observation ?? may be made with
out the fear of Incurring, Uspleasuro of Maxi
milian or bis master, or ttVe| ' would not be ut
tered. Are we, then, to infer ^ ?t Louis Napoleon
Is preparing for an " irrepreMl conflict" with
?he United States, while soothi^ g our Secretary ,
of Slate with his fine prompt *? of an early
evacuation ? Looking at tbe *, simple fact of
these French reinforcements- and . French boast
ings, together with Maximilian's \ var of exter
mination against the liberals, it \ 'a difficult to
avoid the conclusion that nothing ba t the diplo
macy of General Grant will re-osfc iblLsb the
Mexican ropublic in the Mexican cap ital.
We find, however, from his iate M wage to
Congress, that President Johnson remv 'ins un
shaken in his faith in the Monroe doctrine, and
from the reeent proceedings in both ho uses it
Is apparent that Congress is aot in the mood
for granting an indefinite term of grace to
Maximilian. It is as certain ns the rising of to
morrow's sun that he must mr.ke up his mind
for a voluntary retirement or a forcible expul
sion from Mexico. He cannot stay there. His im
perial usurpation, as aptly described by Gen.
Logan, is an offchoot of the late rebellion, and
intended for the same purpose ? the overthrow
of the political, military and commercial power
of the United States ? and his empire will not
much longer be tolerated. That it cannot be
recognised by our present administration Louis
Napoleon has been officially informed; that
the republic still is recognized at Washington
is patent to all the world. Why, then, do
French troops continue to go into Mexico, in
stead of going out, if Louis Napoleon has no4
resolved to hold the country, peace or wart
This id a delicate question and difficult to
answer. We, however, are not prepared to
relinquish the idea that Louis Napoleon will
in good time quietly withdraw his man Maxi
milian and all his imperial household and trap
pingb and gewgaws from Mexico. The Presl.
dent says that the correspondence with the
French government on the subject will, at the
propoiytime, be laid before Congress, meaning
that the proper time has not yet come. Why
not f Because, perhaps, the high contracting
parties may be engaged in negotiating e peace
able settlement, the exact terms and details of
which have not yet been agreed upon. Na
poleon, in consideration of his withdrawal of ,
Maximilian, may have asked some commercial
concessions* and some equivalents for his con
tingent expenses, and these matters may be
under debate. At all events, in the very sig
nificant remark of the President that at the
proper time the correspondence with Franco
on this Mexioan question will be laid before
the two houses, we are satisfied that something
is going on through tho Department of State
which promises a satisfactory settlement with
out an appeal to the Department of War. We
look for the confirmation of this opinion in tbe
President's answer to the late Senate resolution
asking for the correspondence in question. We
attach the highest importance to the hint ooifc
veyed in his Message that the information de
sired will be forthcoming at the proper time.
