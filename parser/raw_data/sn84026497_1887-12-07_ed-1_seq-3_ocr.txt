THE FOREST REPUBLICAN.
J. C. WINK,
CCITO 4 SoeSltTOS.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER?, 1887.
M. Saw Carnot is the new Presi
dent of the French Republic. Ho is
looked upoo as ft man of much ability,
but has little record as a statesman.
Ax least ono Deniocralio paper op
prcciates its cold-water allies. In an
exuberant burst of enthusiasm the
Kansas City Time ejaculates: "G d
bless the noble Prohibitionists of New
York. We need 'em in our business."
The Postmaster Oenoral'i report
shows that one cent letter postage is
about three years off". The revenues
of the department are moro nearly
ready for the change tban they were
three years before two-cent postage
was adopted.
A late dispatch from Minneapolis
says: "Nearly complete returns of the
Q. A. R, vote on the proposed depend
ent pension bill have been received at
the national (J. A. R. headquarters iu
this city, and it is practically unani
mous in favor of the hill. The gen
eral pension .commission Geueral
Murrell, of Lawrence, Mass , chair
man will complete the returns and
present them to congress."
Thk fiftieth Congress met and open
ed its session Monday. Speaker
Carlisle, the free trader, was re elected
by the Democrats, the Republicans
voting for Mr. Reed of Maine. The
President's Message was not presented
until yesterday, and as it covers much
more space than his last year's volum
inous effort, it is not likely that more
than one out of a hundred will ever
have the courage to wade through it.
The British holders of Confederate
bonds will have a strong lobby at
Washington this Winter to boom
scheme to make the Government re
deem those securities. The confidence
of these misguided investors is pathet
ic, and yet not surprising. A man
who was fool enough to buy those
bonds in the first place may easily be
excused for the milder folly of expect
ing thia Government to redeem them.

Qld Ilinglatid is well pleased with
President Cleveland's message. Two
of the principal papers of London
comment as follows: The Morning
Post says: "The messsge will pro
duce a profound sensation in Europe
as well ss in America, and will
strengthen the free traders' cause
throughout tbe world.
The Daily Jveww says: "Seldom has
an American President had a more
important lesson to teach. The fact
is that although President Cleveland
-Ves a pretense of shutting hisgjeg'
,. .m policy oi pT'iioIiTias beeu
reduced to a practical and theoretical
absurdity. Tbe stone now rolling will
not stop until the idol of protection is
broken in pieces."
What tbe people of this country
want is a message that will please
Americans more aud Eugland less.
Industrial Education.
The late legislature of this State
passed the following resolution:
That the Governor ia hereby au
thorized and requested to appoint a
commission consisting of not more
than five persons, citizeDS of this Com
monwealth, to make inquiry and report
to tbe Legislature at its next session,
by bill or otherwise, respecting the
subject of industrial education includ
ing an examination of the extent to
which it is already carried on in Penn
sylvania, and elsewhere, the best
means of promoting aod maintaining
it in its several grades, whether by
State or local action alone, or by both
combined, how far it is possible or de
sirable to incorporate it into tbe ex
isting system of publio instruction, the
best method of training teachers for
such schools or departments, and what
changes, if any, are required in the
existing system of normal schools to
St. a a at.
e.nauie mem to provide sucb training
or to meet more fully tbe needs of tbe
system of publio instruction as now
oigsnited in this State, with such other
inquiries as the commission may itself
institute or be requested by the Gov
eruor to undertake. Tbe members of
the commission shall serve tviibi.ul
compensation, except tor necessary
expeuses and rlerk hire aciually iu
curred,and approved by the Governor.
In pursuance of the foregoing reso
lulion the following geuileuun have
been appointed by the govt-ruor to
serve upon tho said coniinianiou :

STRONG DRINK THK CHAMPION FIEND.
An arch fiend arrived in our world,
and he built an invisible caldron of
temptation, lie built that caldron
strong and stout for all ages aud all
nations. First he squeezed into the
caldron tbe juice of the forbidden fruit
of Paradise. Then he gathered for it
a distillation from tbe harvest-fields
and the orchards of the heinisperes.
Then he poured into this caldron cap
sicutu, and copperas, and logwood,
aod deadly nightshade, and assault
and battery, and vitriol, and opium,
and ruin, and murder, and sulphuric
acid, and theft, and potash, and cochi
neal, aud red carrots, and poverty, and
death, aud hops. But it was a dry
compound, and it must be moistened
and it must be liquified, and so the
arch-fiend poured into that caldron
the tears of ceulories of orphanage
and widowhood, aod he poured iu the
blond of twenty thousand assassina
tions. And then the arch fiend took
a shovel that he had brought up from
the furnaces beneath, and be put that
shovel into the great caldron aod be
gan to stir, and the caldron began to
heave, and rock, and boil, and sputter,
and biss, and smoke, and tbe nation
gathered around it with cups, and
tankards, and demijohns, and kegs,
and there was enough for all, and the
archfiend cried: "Aha! cbampiuu
fiend am I. Who has done more than
I have for coffins, and grave-yards,
and prisons, and insane asylums, and
tbe populating of the lost world? And
wbeu this caldron is emptied I'll fill it
again, and I'll stir it again, aud it will
smoke agaiu, and that smoke will join
another tbe smoke of torment that
asceudelb forever and ever.
"I drove fifty ships on the rocks of
Newfoundland and the Skerries and
the Goodwins. I defeated the North
ern army at Fredericksburg. I have
ruined more senators than will gather
next winter in the national councils.
I have ruined mole lords than will
be gathered in the House of Peers.
Tbe cup out of which I ordinarily
driuk is a bleached human skull, and
the upholstery of my palace is so rich
a crimsou because it is steeped in bu
mau gore, and tbe mosaic of my floors
is made up of the boues of children
dashed to death by drunkest parents,
ajjd my ttTOrtle music sweeter than
Te Deurn or triumphal march my fa
vorite music is the cry of daughters
turned out at midnight nn tbe street
because father has come home from
tbe carousal, aod the seven-buudied-
voiced shriek of the sinking steamer
because the captaiu was nut himself
when be put the ship on the wrong
course. Champion neud am II 1 nave
kindled more ftr-e, I have wrung out
more agonies, I bave stretched nut
more midnight shadows, I bave open
ed more Golgotbas, I have roiled more
Juggernauts, I have damued more
souls than other emissary of diabolism.
Champion fiend am 1 1"

ICxcltrmrnt In Texas.
flreat excitement has been caused in the
vicinity of Paris, Tex., by tho remarkable
recovery of Mr. J. K. Corby, who was so
helpless ho could not turn in" bed, or raise
his head : everybody said he was dyinjr of
Consumption. A trial hottlo of lr. King's
New hiwoverv was sent him. Finding
relief, he bought a lariro bottle and a box
of Ir. Kind's New Life Pills; by tho time
he had taken two boxes of Pills aud two
bottles of the Discovery, he was well and
had gained in flesh thirty-six pounds.
Trial bottles of this Oreat 'Discovery for
Consumption free at (J, W. Hovard's.

REAL GRIT.
A son of tbe Emerald Isle, on Lis
arrival ia New York, met with aa old
acquaintance who invited biro to take
glass of grog. Fat declined, aod
gave aa a reason ot ins refusal that be
had joined lha temperance society in
Cork before leaving Ireland. Ilia
friend said "that was of no cooeeqoeDce
aa a pledge Riven iu Ireland was not
binding here." To this piece of left
banded morality Patrick indignantly
retorted: ''Do ye suppose whin I
brought me body to America I'd be
afther laving me fowl in Ireland ?"
Rev. C. C. Rurobrrger delivered an
able and convincing sermon on the
evils of interaperauee to a deeply in
tercsted congregation at the M. E
Church a wetk ago )atl Sunday eve
uing.
Young men do not realize as they
should the importance of early form
iig habits of self coiitrol aud st-lf de
nial. Not a few men of genius bave
been wrecked because they did bol
learu to leuy themselves a temporary
pleusure for the sake of a permanent
LiUDtCt.
The great need of to day is to ap
preciate hoar little we kuow, bow much
there is to be learned aud the selection
