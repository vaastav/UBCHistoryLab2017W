THE NEW MONROE DOCTRINE.
In his annual message to congress
President Wilson gave a new interpre
tation of the Monroe doctrine. The
view which lie is expressed is notable
not so much because it is in reality
new but because it was for the first
time officially voiced by the head of
'.lie nation.
Within recent years there has been
a trowing recognition or me cuuiikcu
relation which the Vnited States hae
come to occupy witn reference to ntr
iieiEhbors on this hemisphere. As
Ionic as the republics of South Amer
ica were in their swaddling clothe.
a condition that existed when Presi
dent, .Monroe enunciated his famous
doctrine and for many years "there
after, it was'neccssary for Uncle Sain
lo assume a kind of paternal attitude
toward them, serving notice on Euro

SCHOOL BOND ELECTION.
The board of education has told the
people quite plainly what they pro
pose to do with the money derived
from the sale 'of T0,00t worth of
bonds, provided the issue is approved
by the voters at the special election
which will be held next Tuesday.
That the junior high school plan
offers the best solution of the prob
lem confronting the district hardly
seems to be open to question. If it is
Hdomd it will put Chickasha in line
with progressive ideas of school or
ganization that are now being adopted
in many cities and make more secure
the position of this community as an
educational center. From the prac
tical viewpoint, It will afford relief in
tho way of additional rooms which the
school, must have if the community
is to perform its duty to the children.
In (omparison with (he junior high
fichool arrangement, with the special
advantases which it offers to children
:'n the upper grades, the suggestion of
another ward school, containing al!
grades, has little to recommend it. If
the ward buildings were already ade
quate, it would be a serious question
whether we could afford to launch the
junior high school syiiem at this time,
but since we are compelled to. erect
an additional building, there is every
nation why we should avail ourselves
of the opportunity to take up this im
proved method even though the cost
will be somewhat larger than imme
diate necessities would call for. The
extra cost is so small in comparison
with, tho benefits to be derived from
taking this orward step that nobody
can afford to hesitate in giving ap
proval to it. jontial South American papers indi-
It has been figured that the cost to cate a1ready that the president's mes

the bonds are issued, will be less than
ten cents on the. $1,000 of assessed
valuation per year, ir you pay taxes
on 1 10,1100 worth of property, you will
Ve called upon to contribute the enor
mous sum of one dollar per year for
carrying out this great enterprise. If
you are assessed for more or less than
that amount, you can easily figure out
what it will cost you.
In view of the situation with which
we are confronted and the welfare of
the children of the community, con
sidered in connection with the oppor
tunity to put the Chickasha district in
Hie forefront of education, why should
we quibble over the addition of a few
cents or a dollar or two to our annual
tax bill?
