NO THANKS FOR THEM.
While President Wilson’s message
to Congress was brief and anything
but comprehensive, it was not limited
to a single subject and it dwelt in
passing on a variety of topics other
than the industrial disputes question—
on foreign selling agencies and cor
rupt practices and Porto Rico, for in
stance.
In view of this fact, it seems less of
an oversight than a piece of repre
hensible neglect that the President
failed to say one word of commenda
tion or sympathy for the militiamen
on the Mexican border.
A large proportion of these men
have made great and definite sacri
fices in order to serve their country.
Many of them are men with import
ant business connections and their
business interests have suffered ma
terially through their absence from
home. Their competitors have reaped
golden rewards as a result of the
present prosperous business condi
tions and they have been deprived of
their share of that porsperity. The
families of some of them have suffer
ed more or less privation because of
their patriotic response to their coun
try’s call. Yet these men have en
dured these things and the discorr.
forts and hardships of life on the bor
der without whimpering.
And the President of the United
States apparently does not regard
their services as of sufficient value to
deserve even the slightest word of
thanks.—Baltimore Sun.
C. & D. Canal
The fight for an appropriation for
the purchase of the Chesapeake ana
Delaware Canal will be waged in this
session of Congress more vigorously
than in the session of last yaer. Those
advocating making the canal a part of
the inland waterway system and,
therefore, a source of military use,
propose to demand of Congress an ap
prop.iation on that ground that the
enlargement of this canal as a federal
ship waterway is imperatively neces
sary on grounds of national prepared
ness.
In this fight they expect to have the
support of the Engineer Corps of the
Army, which has reported in favor of
the purchase of the canal by the Unit
ed States government and also the
support of Navy experts, who were
directed by Congress to investigate
the project from the point of mili
tary necessity in case of war. Under
a resolution passed at the last session
of Congress the Secretaries of the
War and Navy Departments were
authorized to appoint a committee of
Army and Navy experts to make such
an investigation and report to this
session,
A delegation of leaders in the inland
waterway movement, headed by Rep
resentatives Moore, of Pennsylvania;
Small. nf New Hamscliirp and Ben
nett, called on Secretary Daniels to
inquire what had been done under the
terms of this resolution. Secretary
Daniels said that his experts were not
yet ready to report, but will do so
shortly. He said that he personally is
in sympathy with the project.

Kid Gloves
The giving of Kid Gloves has the value of the gift increased
by choosing gloves of dependable quality. No better care can be
exercised in choosing all that is best in kid gloves than here. Our
holiday line cannot be excelled for quality, variety and style.
Many styles and kinds at $1.25, $1.50, $1.65, $1.75 and $2.00 a pair
in lengths for street in Kid, Cape, Mocha and Suede. Evening
lengths in white and black glace Kid. Selections can be made
where size and color is uncertain with the assurance of exchange
for e’e or both of these reasons any time after Christmas,
Leather Goods
The extent to which leather is being used for articles for
Christmas giving can scarcely be realized unless you see for
yourself the great variety of articles we are showing. In addi
tion to the accustomed lines of Auto Bags, Hand Bags, Vanity
Bags, Combination Books, Purses, Wallets and Note Rolls we
show Traveling Sets. Manicure Sets, Jewel Cases. Jewel Bags
and Sewing Boxes, all of which merit the attention of everyone
liW st of useful gifts.
V
Pyralin Ivory
When we placed our holiday orders last March for Parisian
Ivory it was the largest order that we had ever placed on this line
of goods; luckily our judgment was correct, as no class of mer
chandise has been so extensively chosen for gifts. Great as has
been the demand on our stock we are still able to show complete
assortments in white, pink, blue and shell.
Combs, Brushes and Mirrors are reported as very scarce. We
show a full line. Let us furnish you with a set of any number of
pieces that you consider as suitable for a gift.
Umbrellas
We have been told over and over again by our customers of
the excellence of our line of Holiday Umbrellas. Great care has
been taken in the choosing of both the handles and coverings; the
first for beauty, the latter for wearing qualities. Sizes for men,
women and children at every price. We put your name and ad
dress Free of Charge on all holiday umbrellas at $2.00 each and
upwards.
Household Linens
Where to begin in the telling of the excellence of our line of
Household Linens is a difficult matter. Whether it be a rich dam
ask by the yard or in pattern cloths with napkins to match, a
choice of hundreds of styles of small linens, a Cluny, hemstitched
or Madeira embroidered Cover or Scarf or a Towel of any sort
come here to make your choice where we assure you of the larg
est assortments and the best of values of anything that you may
select in linens for gifts.
Dress Goods and Silks
Both of these yardage departments offer you the newest and
best to be had for dresses. A pattern of Silk and Wool Poplin in
black and colors at $1.25 a yard would be an ideal gift. Quite as
much value in desirability are Broadcloths, Henriettas, Serges,
Surah Cloths and Batistes.
One of the most desirable fabrics is our 40-inch Silk Char
meuse in black, ivory and a couple of dozen street and evening
shades, $2.25 and $2.50.
