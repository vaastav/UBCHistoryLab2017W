Railroad Gives Away Elevator.
Mr. Vincent, who represents the
Fanners' Grain company on the
Omaha Grain exchange, relates the
following incident that fell under his
observation recently. He was invited
to assist in a farmers' jubilee in an
Icwa village on the anniversary of the
opening of their elevator. Parties
were present from Lohrville, la.,
where there is also a railroad junc
tion or crossing of two lines. On the
first line of road was located an ele
vator worth probably $2,500, and it
was the property of the railroad com
pany. The farmers organized a grain
company and began looking for a site.
Of course the new line wanted the
company to build on its property. The
old line, realizing that the bulk of the
ehipments would go over the line pat
ronized by the farmer's company, of
fered the farmers tht above mentioned
elevator on its switch. The offer was
accepted and the deed made out for
a nominal sum. The move was a sa
gacious one. There will probably be
no less than 100 cars of grain shipped
each year and the freight will be about
$75 a car, or $7,500 annually, that the
road would have lrt if it had permit
ted the farmers to build on the rival
road. That railroad may be said to
'have "invested" $2,500 in "farmers."
The income from hauling two cars
will pay interest at C per cent on the
"Investment" and the rest of the $7,
S00 will contain a large element of
"profit."
Mr. Vincent, in speaking of the in
cident, stated that he desired to call
attention to the fact that an elevator
Is only a storage place for grain till
cars can be obtained to ship in, and
since1 the railroads are required to
house al lother freight offered, it was
his opinion that they should be re
quired to furnish the elevator to as
sist in handling and loading the grain.
He remarked that the proposition ap
peared reasonable and the only argu
ment against it would seem to be that
the other system has been used so
long That it has grown familiar.

THREE BANKS CLOSE UP
INSTITUTIONS IN M'DONOUGH
COUNTY, ILL, SUSPEND.
All Conducted by C V. Chandltr
Notices Posted Say They Are
Short of Ready Cash.
Peoria, 111. Three banking institu
tions in McDonough county, conducted
ty C. V. Chandler, of Macomb, closed
their doors Friday. Notices to the
effect that the. banks were short of
ready cash were posted on the doors
9f all the banks Friday morning. The
decision to close was reached Thurs
day upon an examination of the books
by Mr. Chandler himself.
The banks are: The bank of Ma
comb, conducted by C. V. Chandler
ft Co., having a deposit of $450,000,
and capitalized at $50,000; the Chan-
Her & Imes bank at Colchester, capi
talized at $25,000, having a deposit of
$200,000. and the Chandler ft Smith
bank at Bardolph, capitalized at
$25,000 with $50,000 in deposits.
The money of the depositors In all
three banks has been invested through
Mr. Chandler, the senior member of
the private banking firm in McDon
augh county real estate, and the im
mediate cause of suspension of the
Ihree institutions is given as a lack of
ready cash. The Macomb bank stood
good for the payment of the bonds
of the Macomb and Western Illinois
Electric railway, and when the bond
holders made a demand for their
money they absorbed all the ready
cash of the three institutions.
C. V. Chandler has been in the
banking business In Macomb for a
quarter of a century, and in addition
to his private holdings is treasurer of
the Western Illinois State Normal
School of Macomb and treasurer of
the city of Macomb. It is not thought
sither the school or the city will lose
by the failure of the banks. The
state is protected by a trust company
bond and the city's deposits In the
bank are small at this time of the
year.
Mr. Chandler made a statement Fri
day, setting .forth la effect what was
stated in the notices posted on the
doors of the banks. The liabilities are
upwards of $700,000, with unincum
bered real estate worth over $400,000.
The mortgages are mostly on central
Illinois farms and are considered gilt
edge.
There was little show of excitement
over the closing of the banks. The
depositors have faith in the word of
Mr. Chandler and expect the fulfill
ment of his promise. In Colchester
the major part of the depositors are
miners who made no demonstration
when they read the notice on the
doors of the bank.

OTTO YOUNG IS DEAD.
One of Chicago's Leading Capitalists
'Passes Away.
Chicago.' Otto Young, 62 years
old, one of Chicago's leading capital
ists, and Jandowaers, died -at 1:39
o'clock Friday afternoon at his coun
try home at Lake Geneva.
Not since the death of . Marshall
Field almost a year ago has there
come such a shock to the Chicago
business and financial world as this
unexpected news caused. It now de
velops, however, that Mr. Young had
suffered with tuberculosis of the lungs
for five years. He was obliged to re
lease his active hold on affairs five
weeks ago, but it was not thought
the attack would prove fatal. He was
afflicted with diabetes also.
Mr. Young's fortune is estimated at
$17,000,000. His holdings of central
business property in Chicago were ex
ceeded only by those of Marshall Field
and the Levi Z. Letter estates. Up to
the time of his death he had been
planning the erection of a $10,000,900
hotel In Michigan avenue. The' idea
had become his hobby and he intend
ed it to be the finest hotel la the

provision in his will for the carrying

PRIVATE CAR SMASHED
Samuel Spencer and Six Others Meet
Death in Aceident Near Lynch-
Va, Tw Being Prom-
lUGflX awOnuHIOfV Hsvlae
Lynchburg. Va. Samuel Spencer,
president of tthe Southern Railway
company, and . recognised as one of
the foremost mea in the development
of the southern, states, and six other
persons were killed Thursday morn
ing at 9:19 o'clock ia a rear, end eel
listoa between two fast passenger
trains ten miles south of Lynchburg
and a mile north of Lawyer's depot.
Philip Schuyler, a retired capitalist,
of New York, was among the killed,
together with other guests of Mr.
Spencer. Oaly Mr. Spencer's private
secretary, E. A. Merrill, of New York
city, and one of three porters sur
vived the accident.
Following Is a list of those killed:
Samuel Spencer, New York, president
of the Southern Railway company; D.
W. Davis, Alexandria, Va.' private dis
patcher to President Spencer; Charles'
D. Fisher, Baltimore, Md., member of
the grain exporting firm of Gill ft
Fisher, a guest of President Spencer;
Samuel Spencer.
Francis T. Redwood. Baltimore, Md.,
member of the brokerage firm of
Lownes ft Redwood, a guest of Presi
dent Spencer; Gen. Philip Schuyler,
New York, director of the Southern
railway and trustee of New York Life
Insurance company, a guest of Presi
dent Spencer; Willllam Pollard, negro
porter in President Spencer's car; J.
W. Shaw,- negro fireman.
Mr. Merrill's head and arms were
badly injured, but he will recover. A
number of others were injured.
Blame for the wreck in which Mr.
Spencer and his party were killed is
placed wholly on C. D. Mattoax, the
operator at Rangoon, who has dis
appeared. The collision was between the Jack
sonville express and the Washington
ft Southwestern vestibule limited,
both south-bound.. President Spencer
and his entire party, so far as is
known, were sleeping when the col
lision occurred, and the' probabilities
are that all of them, exceping Dis
patcher Davis were killed instantly.
It is certain that life was extinct be
fore the flames touched them. Presi
dent Spencer's body was burned al
most beyond recognition, as was that
of Mr. Fisher. The body of Mr.
Schuyler was taken from under the
train before it was burned very much.
Mr. Spencer's car was attached to
the rear of the Jacksonville train,
which was standing still when struck.
Mr. Spencer was lying directly under
the big locomotive of the rear train.
So great was the force of the Impact
that the forward train was sent at
least 150 feet ahead, the locomotive
going over and upon the body of Mr.
Spencer. Until after the debris burned
itself out and the engine cooled off
the bodies could not be removed.
President Spencer earned his first
laurels in railroading on the section
of road on which he lost his life
Thursday. That portion of the South
ern system was formerly known as
the Virginia Midland, of which Mr.
Spencer was superintendent in 1877.
This was the highest position he had
held up to that time, and he left it
within a year for a promotion.
