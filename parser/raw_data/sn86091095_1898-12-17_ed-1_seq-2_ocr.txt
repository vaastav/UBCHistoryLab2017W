President McKinley intends to
visit Cuba and Porto Rico. The
plan according to present informa
tion, is for the president and party,
probably consisting of several cabi
net officers and ladies, to start on
the trip after the close of the pres
ent session of congress.
The ashes of Columbus were
transferred with military and sacer
dotal ceremonies Sunday from the
Cathedral at Havana to the Spanish
cruiser Conde de Venadito which
immediately set sail for Cadiz with
the sacred dust of the great discov
erer to be interred in Spanish soil.
The cruiser was convoyed by two
gunboats._
The people of Washington are
subscribing to a $10,000 fund for the
purchase of a solid silver service for
the flag-ship Olympia as a tribute
of appreciation for the heroic con
duct of Commodore Dewey, his
officers and crew during the memo
rable engagement in Manila Bay.
The service will be tendered as a
Christmas present.
Governor of Cuba.
President McKinley has desig
nated Major-General Brooke to be
military governor of Cuba. Each
of the six provinces will have its
own military governor, and will re
ceive instructions directly from
Brooke.
Cleveland on Annexation.
Ex-President Cleveland was in
terviewed recently on the new policy
of the United States and dictated
the following for the Associated
Press :
"Without going at all into details,
I wish to say that I am ardently
opposed to every feature of this
annexation and expansion policy.
The public ought to know pretty
well what my convictions are, from
the Hawaiian question during my ;
administration. I have not changed
my mind and remain opposed to
all of this annexation from Hawaii
to the Philippines."
Senator Cockrell's Views.
Senator Frank Cockrell, of Mis
souri, who has as level a head as
any man in America, thinks there
will be very little new legislation at
this session; that the important
business accomplished is likely to
be confined to the regular appropri
ation bills, a river and harbor bill,
enough army legislation to meet
emergencies, and a bill providing a
government for Hawaii. Senator
Cockrell is opposed to our taking
permanent possession of the Phil
ippines, although he fully approves
of their being taken away from
Spain. He says we should aid the
natives to establish an independent
government, to be under our pro
tection until able to stand alone.
Speaking of the political outlook,
the Senator said : "The Democrats
are not downcast at the result of
the election. The heavy Republi
can losses show the strength of the
Democracy and indicate that the
next general election will return
the party to power."
A school of housekeeping has
been established in Boston, and its
aim is to provide a school where
employers and employes may to
gether learn the business of house
keeping. Lectures will be given on
"How to Build a House," by a san
itary engineer and a noted architect.
The "Equipment of a House" is
described by a practical housekeeper
Maria Parloa. Among other lec
tures will be "Food in the Relation
of True Economics," "Economic
Buying," and "Domestic House
keeping;" "The House as a Unit
of Health;" "Division of Income
in Household Expenditure," "Do
mestic Service : Its Past, Present,
and Future," and "Domestic Service
as a Trade."
In addition to this there will be
demonstrations on "Dust and its
Dangers, "Practical Study of the
Cellar and Yard," "Heating and
Lighting," Ventilation, Drainage,
and Plumbing," "The Laundry,"
'"The Kitchen," "The Storeroom,"
"Interior Woodwork: Its Prepara
tion and Preservation," "The Hy
giene of the Bedroom," etc. From
what bas already been said it will
be seen that the school is a radical
departure from the ordinary meth
ods in vogue. It is an acknowledg
ment that housekeeping is a science
and housework a trade—an import
ant distinction.
The plan proposed for the devel
opment of this idea comprises u
home, a family, and classes in the
ory and practice for housekeeping,
for employers, and a course of prac
tical training in housework for em
ployes. The school is carried on
in two connecting houses, well ar
ranged for this experiment. One
house is occupied by boarders con
stituting the "family." The other
is used for classes and demonstra
tion work for employers and em
ployes. These employes receive the
training; they carry on the work
of the house under the direction of
a skilled housekeeper and a cooking
teacher. A special course of train
ing and housekeeping has been ar
ranged so that a limited number of
employers may, during a six weeks'
residence in the school, learn "to
keep house" by practice and obser
vation.
BRYAH CAH TALK FREELY HOW.
The Distinguished Democratic Leader
Declares Against Expansion.
HK SAYS COLONIZATION MEANS DEATH
TO THE REPUBLIC.
Colonel William J. Bryan upon
leaving his command at Öavaunab,
Ga., Tuesday, gave out the follow
ing statement for the press :
"My reason for leaving the army
was set forth in my letter to the ad
jutant general tendering my resigna
tion. Now that the treaty of peace
has been concluded, I believe I can
be more useful to my country as a
civilian than as a soldier."
Colonel Bryan then proceeded to
the discussion of public questions,
saying :
"The people of the United States,
having rescued Cuba from foreign
control, may now resume the dis
cussion of the domestic problems
which confront this nation and to
the consideration of the new ques
tions arising out of the war.
A NEW DANGER.
"I may be in error, but in my
judgment, our nation *is in greater
danger now than Cuba. Our people
defendedCuba against foreign arms,
now they must defend themselves
and their country against a foreign
idea—-the colonial idea of European
nations. Heretofore greed has per
verted the government and used its
instrumental interference for pri
vate gain ; but now the very founda
. .
principles of our government
are assaulted.
"The imperialistic idea is directly
antagonistic to the idea and ideals
which have been cherished by the
American people ever since the
signing of the Declaration of Inde
pendence. Oiir nation must give
up any intention of entering upon
a colonial policy—such as is now
pursued by European countries—
or it must abandon the principle
that governments come up from the
people; or we may believe that gov
ernments come down to the people,
from those who possess the heaviest
cannons and the longest ships, but
we cannot advocate both doctrines
"To borrow a Bible quotation,
'a house divided against itself can
not stand,' paraphrasing Lincoln's
declaration, I may add that this
nation cannot endure half republic
and half colony—half free and half
vassals. Our form of government,
even traditions, our present inter
ests and our future welfare, all for
bid our entering upon a career of
conquest.
conquest.
"Jefferson has been quoted in sup
port of imperialism, but our oppo
nents must distinguish between ex
pansion in the western hemisphere
and expansion that involves us in
the quarrel of Europe and the Ori
ent. They must still further dis
tinguish between expansion which
secures contiguous territory for fu
ture settlement and expansion, and
that which secures us alien races
for future subjugation.
"Jefferson favored the annexation
of necessary contiguous territory
on the North American continent,
but he was opposed to wars of con
quest, and expressly condemned
the acquiring of remote territory."
PROPOSES A CURE.
When asked how the colonial
policy could be prevented. Colonel
Bryan said:
"Some think that the fight should
be made against ratification of the
treaty, but I would prefer another
plan. If the treaty is rejected, ne
gotiations must be renewed aud
instead of settling the question ac
cording to our ideas, we must settle
it by diplomacy with the possibility
of international complications. It
will be easier, I think, to end the
war at once by ratifying the treaty
and then deal with the subject in
our own way. The issue can be
presented directly by a resolution
of congress, declaring the policy of
the nation upon this subject. The
president in his message says that
our only purpose in taking posses
siun of Cuba is to establish a stable
government and then turn that gov
ernment over to the peoyle of Cuba.
Congress could reaffirm this pur
pose in regard to Cuba and assert
the same policy in regard to the
Philippines and Porto Rico. Such
a resolution would make a clear
cut issue between the doctrine of
self-government and the doctrine ot
imperialism. We should reserve a
harbor and coaling station in Porto
Rico and the Philippines in return
for services rendered, and I think
we would be justified in asking the
same concession from Cuba.
In the case of Porto Rico, where
the people have as yet expressed
no desire foran independent govern
ment, we might with propriety de
clare our willingness to annex the
island if the citizens desire annexa
tion, but the Philippine islands are
too far away and their people too
different from ours to be annexed
to the United States, even if they
desired it."
u
Friars Brutally Treated.
The Manila correspondent of the
Hongkong Press gives details of
the shocking treatment of friars
and other prisoners captured by
insurgents in the northern part of
the island of Luzon. The war de
partment has started to work on
the release of tue friars in Aguinal
do's possession. Tbe stale depart
ment refuses to treat with him.
Aguinaldo wants $80,(XX) for each
friar. They will be tuken by force
of arms to make good tbe condi
tions of tbe peace treaty.

Counterfeit Dollars.
A recent dispa4«h from Memphis,
Tenn., says : A smooth gang of
counterfeiters are at work in the
Mississippi valley. The counterfeit
is of the standard silver dollar and
all which have»so far been discov
ered bear the date of 1890. It is
believed something like 200,000 of
them have gained circulation.
Xmas Gifts for Volunteers.
Last Saturday the Omaha World
Herald sent hv telegraph $1,000 to
the First Nebraska regiment, lo
cated at Manila, and $1,000 to the
Third Nebraska regiment com
manded by Colonel William J.
Bryan, now at Savannah, Ga., pre
paring to start for Cuba. This
money is contributed at the solicit
ation of the World-Herald by over
3,000 contributors, and is sent to
the two regiments to provide for a

Volunteers to be Relieved.
The news comes from Washing
ton that the war department has
begun in earnest the relief of the
volunteer troops now stationed at
Manila by regulars. Monday after
noon Secretary Alger signed an
order designating for this purpose
six regiments of United States
infantry out of the eight held in
reserve for service in tropical coun
tries. The regiments are the Twen
tieth, at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.;
the Third, at Fort Snelling, Minn.,
the Twelfth, at Jefferson Barracks,
Mo., and Fort Riley, Kan.; the
Seventeenth, at Columbus, O.; the
Fourth, at Fort Sheridan, and the
Twenty-second at Fort Crook, Neb.
They .will go forward to Manila as
soon as fhe transport can be pro
vided. The volunteers in Manila
will be retired in the order in which
they reached that city.
Bryan Has Resigned.
A Washington dispatch of Dec.
12th says : All doubt respecting the
intentions of Col. William J. Bryan
have been removed by the receipt
by the war department of a telegram
from him stating that he has mailed
the resignation of his commission
as colonel of volunteers and that it
was approved by the division and
corps commanders.
The written resignation came to
hand at the war department this
afternoon by mail and was imme
diately accepted, notice of the fact
being telegraphed to Colonel Bryan.
Colonel Bryan will be given an
opportunity to tell of his military
experience on his return to Lincoln,
Neb. On the 20th of this month
the Bryan Traveling Men's club
will tender a complimentary ban
quet to Bryan and Congressman
Bailey of Texas, the latter having
accepted an invitation to-be present
and speak. If Colonel Bryan finds
it impossible to be present at that
time a date will be arranged to suit.
Death at Manila.
A correspondent of the San Fran
cisco Call under a recent date
furnishes a gloomy account of the
mortality of our soldiers and the
sanitary conditions at Manila. He
said: "There is sickness in the
heat of the noonday 6un, there is
death in the miasma's of the night.
Fever comes with dryness;
fever is all that is brought with the
rains. One sleeps, eats, walks,
drills and passes his whole existence
down in this beautiful accursed land,
in a continual atmosphere of fever,
small-pox and dysentery. The
consequence is that every hospital
—and there are many—is tilled to
overflowing, and the dead march is
heard almost as often as the bugle
cull. The men are dying at the
rate of three a day, and those thaï
escape are in danger of being inva
lided for life. Death goes merrily
on reaping his harvest, and when
the olfidtal report of the fatalities
is received at home the paeans of
.victory, which are now resounding
throughout the land, will bechanged
to dirges, and the voice of Columbia
will be heard mourning for her
children and refusing to be
forted because they are not."
U. S. volunteer soldiers in the late
war are by law exempt from their
share of required annual assessment
work on unpatented mining claims.
An affidavit setting forth the facts
essential thereto must be filed with
the recorder of the county in which
the claim is situated before Jan
1, 1399.

TREATY OF PEACE SIGHED.
Spaniards Grief Stricken at the Hu
miliation They Had to Soffer.
The treaty of peace between Spain
and the United States was signed
last Saturday night by both parties.
The United States gets the Philip
pines for $20,000,000. Porto Rico
also becomes the property of Unde
Sam, and the annexation of Cuba
will eventually follow. The Span
iards are grief stricken and humil
iated at being forced to sign the
terms proposed by the United States.
Spanish PeaceCommissioner Abar
zuza, discussing the peace negotia
tions, said :
"We have fulfilled our mission here
aud have agreed to make a treaty of
peace, but we do so under protest that
our sovereign rights over the Philippines
are still iotact.
Senor Ojeda, the principal Span
ish secretary, said :
"Peace is assured. We bave agreed to
sign a treaty in accordance with the pro
tocol of Washington, but at the same
time protesting our sovereign rights over
the Philippines and stating that we only
yield to the hard American terms owing
to our inabiltv to renew the war and in
the presence of superior force."
The London Times comments as
follows on Spain's wail of protest at
the harsh treatment of the United
States :
"Spain has lost her colonies because
her colonial system was founded upon
spoliation and tyranny. The United
States has not treated her any more
harshl y than Germany treated France in
1871, or Russia treated Turkey in 1878.
Therefore, the Spanisli .memorandum of
protest is unreasonable and unjustified."'

GEHEHAL GARCIA DEAD.
Passing of a Distinguished Cuban
Warrior.
General Calixto Garcia, the dis
guiehed Cuban warrior and leader,
and the head of the commission
elected by the Cuban assembly to
visit this country, died in New
York city Sunday at the Hotel Ra
leigh, where the commission has its
headquarters. The sudden change
from the warm climate of Cuba,
with the hardships he had there
endured, to the wintry weather of
New York, was responsible for the
pneumonia which resulted in his
demise. He contracted a slight
cold in New York which did riQt
assume an alarming stage until the
early part of last week. On Tues
day night General Garcia, in com
pany with the other members of
the commission, attended a dinner
given in bis honor by General Miles,
and it was exposure there that
caused the disease which culminated
in his death.
In his dying moments, as all
through his busy and active life,
his thoughts were for his beloved
country and its people, and among
his last words were irritiunal mui
terings in which he gave orders to
his son, who is on his staff, for the
battle which he supposed was to
occur to-morrow and in which he
understood there was
Spaniards to combat. Just betöre
he died he embraced his son.

A LawyerSCaught Out.
Last fall Mr. John Sparks slaugh
tered one of his tame elks, a small
herd of which he has at his ranch
up the valley. He shipped the car
cass as a present to J. VV. Dorsey, a
former Elko attorney but now prac
ticing his profession in San Fran
cisco. The toothsome meat was
received all right by Mr. Dorsey,
who toak it to the butcher s shop
to have the animal dressed and cut
up to distribute among his friends.
It happened to be the close season
for that species of game in Calior
fornia, and any person found in
possession of it is amenable to fine
and imprisonment, whether it was
killed in that state or elsewhere. At
all events Mr. Dorsey was arrested,
pleaded guilty and paid the usual
fine. But that was not the worst of
it. The officers of the law refused
to deliver the meat to Mr. Dorsey
and the entire carcass was sent out
to the Alms House, where, it is to
be hoped, the unfortunate inmates
enjoyed a treat even though it was
at the expense of Mr. Sparks and
Mr. Dorsey.—Nevada State Journal.
