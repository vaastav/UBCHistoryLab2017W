A COMPLETE REPORT.
Senator Borrows Introduces Bill
for Suppression of Anarchy
in United States.
It Prohibits Landing of Anarch
ists in Any Port .of This
Country.
Provision Also Made for Taking
Care of Those Already
in America.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The senate was
the only congressional branch in session
today. The early business Included a
flood of executive communications,
mainly formal. The president transmit
ted to the senate the new Hay-Paunce
fote treaty for the isthmian canal. Bur
rows Introduced a bill "To provide for
•the exclusion and deportation, of alien
anarchists."
The first section of the bill is as fol
lows: "Ttoat no alien anarchists shall
hereafter be permitted to land at any
port in the United States or be admitted
into the United States, but this prohibi
tion shall no be so construed as to apply
to political refugees or political offend
ers other than such anarchists."
The second section directs a special
board of Inquiry, authorized by the Im
migration laws, to make diligent inves
tigation concerning the antecedents of
any alien seeking admission into the
United StateB, who is suspected of being
an anarchiBt. and authorizing the board
to even go to the extent of examining
the person of suspected aliens for marks
indicative of membership of anarchistic
societies.
Section three provides for the return
of persons to their native countries who
have secured admission to the United
States contrary to law and who have af
terward been found to be anarchists.
The fourth section provides that when
any alien is convicted of crime in any
TJnlttd States court and it shall appear
frodm the evidence that he is an anar
chist the presiding Judge shall direct a
further hearing, and If the judge 1b sat
isfied the convicted alien is an anarchist
or that bis remaining in this country
will be a menace to the government or
society in general, he may direct that,
lii addition to other punishments ad
judged, the convicted alien, after under
going such punishments, shall be de
ported at the ^"nse of the United
States to the couwn-y from which he
came, and if he returns to the United
,States shall be punished by Imprison
ment at hard labor for a period of not to
exceed five years and afterward deport
ed.
Provision Is made for the appointment
of twelve immigration agents to make
Investigation in foreign countries con
cerning intended immigrants. The last
,1 section of the bill provides that '''the
fact that the alien has declared his in
tention tobecomq a citizen of the Unlt
ed States shall constitute no bar to the
proceedings against him under this
act"
When Hoar sought to advance the
consideration of certain pension bills
Morgan, of Alabama, objected, remark
ing: "There is too much slack on pen
•lonss I would like to tighten it up a
little."
I/odge introduced a bill providing that
the tariff' passed by the Philippine com
mission on Sept 17, 1901, and approved
by the secretary of war, shall remain in
foil force and effect. This covers goods
going into 4-he islands. Lodge also in
troduced a bill providing for the remov
al of the Wn years' limitation in the Chi
nese exclusion act, thus leaving the pro
visions 6t the Geary act in force.
Senator Hansbrough today reintro
duced his irrigation bill of the last ses
sion with various amendments. It pro
vides for the setting aside of monies "de
rived from the sale of public lands in
arid and semi-arid regions of the United
States and the collection of these
monies In a fund to be used for the re
clamation of arid lands. The secretary
of the interior is given charge of this
fund and of all the details of its collec
tion and expenditure.
.gat 2:10 p. m. the senate went into ex
"eWnve session and soon afterwards ad
journed.
The president today sent a number of
recess appointments to the senate and
the .new appointment of George W.
Liefcerth, Kentucky, to be collector of
Internal revenue for the sixth district of
Kentucy. Among the recess appoint
ments sent in was that of Attorney Gen
eral Knox.
The navy department today received
the following from Capt. Perry, com
manding the Iowa, dated Panama: "1
have re-embarked all our force from the
Isthmus, perfect security of transit be
ting effectually restored.'1
THE BEST MESSAGE YET.
Congrats Greatly Impressed With
Roosevelt's First Message.
Washington, Dec. 4.—It is no dispar
agement to previous presidents to say
that the message sent in to congress
yesterday impressed that body more
than any paper submitted to it for a
generation. Both republicans and dem
ocrats are full of admiration for the
technique of the message. Many .who
dlfter with the president were the first
to call attention to the extraordinary
beauty and vigor of his language. Aside
from the literary excellence of the doc
ument the leaders of the republican con
tingent were delighted vith the mes
sage because, as they said, it developed
a grasp to the situation and a breadth
of view which they feared President
Roosevelt did not possess.
The older heads of the party, who
have been somewhat alarmed because
a man under fifty years of age had been
suddenly called upon to guide the des-
1
linies of a great n&tion, were agreea
bly disappointed at the first state paper
of the youngest president of the United
States. They, were delighed to find that
'While the message possessed literary ex«
cellence, which they had a right to ex
pect, It was extremely forceful, but at
the same time as conservative as poeei-
bly could have been desired. In the sen
ate particularly, where there are many
rich men, fear had been expressed that
President Roosevelt would be led away
by the enthusiasm of young men, and
that in a desire to turn a pretty para
graph and to earn the applause of the
people he would attack the trusts In so
vigorous a fashion as to do great harm
to corporate interests.
On the contrary, these grave and rev
erend and somewhat plutocratic sena
tors immediately admitted in the most
delighted fashion that the young and
supposedly impetuous president had dis
cussed the trust question with rare dis
crimination. The effect was so good on
both sideB of the capitol^ the opinion was
expressed that the president's plan of
regulating the trusts by national super
vision and constant publicity would al
most certainly be adopted by congress.
COLOMBIA IS WJIET.
Peace Commission Starts for the In
terior to See Diaz and Lugo.
Colon, Colombia, Dec. 4.—According to
news just received here to interior of
the country is almost entirely quiet. On
ly a few scattered and Insignificant in
surgent bands are here and they are
waging guerilla warfare. This causes
the government no anxiety.
A peace commission has started for
the interior to obtain an interview with
Generals Diaz and Lugo and to Induce
them to give up tbfc struggle and return
to Panama.
The guard of American marines,
which up today has been stationed in
front of the offices of the railroad com
pany here, has been withdrawn. A
small detail of marines still accompa
nied the train passesnger across the
isthmus. Both ends of the isthmus are
quiet and orderly.
Among the prominent persons killed
on the government side during the re
cent engagements on the isthmus were
Col. Manual Pachon, Opt Danian Es
pinosa, Maj. Mollnares and Evardo Par
edes.
Just prior to the capture of Colon the
liberal Gens. Cortlza and Catriani were
drowned in an imprudent attempt in a
small boat and thru a rough and high
sea to reach, surprise and seize the Co
lombian gunboat Gen. Plnzon. On the
side of the literals Gen. San Zuniga was
killed in the Culebra engagement.
Among the non-combatants and gov
ernment officials killed in Colon were
Senor Muskus. chief of the department
of hacienda (finance), and Senor Jaon,
judge of the criminal court.
The total number of killed and wc.und
ed on both sides Is estimated at about
400.
Colon, Dec. 4.—The city of Panama
continues quiet Following Gen. Al
ban's orders, the Colombian gunboat
Boyaca, towing a launch for the use
of soldiers, left Panama. The destin
ation of this expedition is reported to
be Agua Dulce. Prom this point the
government soldiers will attempt to
clear the remaining bands of liberals
from the department of Panama. Gen.
Bellsarlo Porras, the liberal leader, Is
supposed to be In the vicinity of Agua
Dulce.
American marines are still ashore at
Panama.
Juna Antonio Jiminez, formerly a
member of the staff of the insurgent
general, Domingo Diaz, has come vol
untarily to Panama, where he delivered
himself to Gen. Alban. Gen. Diaz did
not Instruct Jiminez to come in and
surender. The former Insurgent says
he/is sick and disgusted with the .cam
paign.
PRINCE HENRY'S QUARRELS.
His Offensive Remarks to the Queen
Results in Two Duels.
Amsterdam, Dec. 4.—In spite ot offi
cial denials investigations show there Is
substantial foundation for the story of
a duel having been fought between
Prince Henry, husband of Queen Wil
helmlna, and Major Van Tets, the
queen's aide de camp. It appears at a
dinner at Hetloo, her majesty was hurt
by some Inattention on the part of the
prince and spoke to him sharply. The
rince retorted offensively, whereupon
Van Tetes made a remark regarding' the
impropriety of the prince consort's con
duct. A quarrel followed between- the
aide de camp and Prince Henry, who
had been drinking freely and a duel
with swords was fought after dinner.
Van TeteB, was wounded-. He has since
been removed to Utrecht to be operated
upon. The same incident gave rise to
another duel between Prince Henry and
a gentleman of the court. The latter
was slightly wounded.
Story of Quarrel Denied.
The Hague, Dec. 4.—One of the high
est officials of the queen's private house
hold, whose name is withheld owjng to
the requirements of court etiquette, au
thorizes the correspondent to state in
the strongest terms that there
Ib
no
shadow of truth in the scandalous re
ports of quarrels between Queen Wllhel
mina and Prince Henry. An official de
rial would have been Issued earlier, but
the reputation of the only Dutch papers
publishing the report:s 1b too contempti
ble for dignified or serious notice. The
s'anders. have caused the greatest pain
in court circles, whore the affectionate
relations of the royal couple are well
known.
It is hinted In certain quarters that
the rumors were started for political
reasons. The Dutch lower classes op
posed the marriage, dreading German
influence.
Henry's Anger Cooling,
Amsterdam, Dec. 4.—Prince Henry,
Queen Wilhelmina's consort, returned to
the palace from Germany on Sunday.
In the presence of the queen mother
yepterday^a reconciliation was effected
between tt^e royal couple for the time
at least.
The prince consort was absent from
home 'during the whole time of the
queen's illness, including the most criti
cal period.
It is learned that Queen Emma per
suaded Queen Wlihelmina to forgive
Prince Henry, while the kaiser brought
pressure to bear upon the prince to the
came end. Arrangements have been
mfcde to pay Prince Henry's debt!' and
this removes the original cause of the
quarrel. ..
Duke of Hamilton Married.
London, Dec. 4.—The duke of Hamil
ton was quietly married at Salisbury to
day to Miss Nina Foore. Only half a
dozen near relatives were present.

Relative to a reduction of the reve
nue the secretary says:
"The estimates for the fiscal year
ending ^Tune 30, 1902, indicate a surplus
of $100,000,000. For the next fiscal year,
1902-1903, there is to be an estimated
surplus of a little more thnn $23,000,000.
It will be noticed that the estimates of
expenditures for such year, 1902-1903, are
more than $83,000,000 In excess of the
probable expenditures for the current
fiscal year, 1901-1902. It Is further to be
observed that estimates coming in from
the several departments for a year not
yet entered upon are not conclusive that
the sums so estimated will be appro
priated by congress, or, if appropriated,
actually disbursed from the treasury.
The secretary presents a table show
ing that witlv one exception in eleven
years the expenditures have been below
both the estimates of the departments
below the sums appropriated and says:
"Therefore, it may reasonably be as
sumed that in the next fiscal year a
similar result will ensi)e, which will
operate to increase the now estimated
surplus of $23,000,000. There are, how
ever, perceptible incidents which may
partially or wholly nullify such sug
gested increase: There are certain re
funds on account of internal-revenue
taxes to which, under the law, the con
tributors are entitled. The sum re
quired will approximate $5,000,000. Tha
state of Pennsylvania has recefitly es
tablished in the court of claims a claim
for over $700,000 for interest, paid on
account of moneys borrowed by it for
the equipment and support of its Fed
eral volunteers during the civil war.
With this claim thus adjudicated, other
states In a similar position will no

doubt follow, and from data at hand
probably $5,000,000 or $6,000,000 will be
required to satisfy nil. To what ex
tent the Spanish War Claims Com
mission will give findings against this
government is at present unknown.
There are also possible large refunds
before us in connection with duties
and taxes collected on the commerce
between the United States and its in
sular possessions.
"These are some of the factors in the
calculation, and they can not at present
be determined, but they suggest caution
against too radical reduction in reven
ues now established.
"Nor in this presentation has ac
count been taken of the requirement of
the sinking fund established by the act
of February 25, 1862. To satisfy its re
quirements, the use of over $50,000,000
annually in the purchase and cancella
tion of outstanding bonds will be neces
sary. The present year's surplus will
be about $100,000,000, half of which has
been, or will be, applied to the use of
the sinking fund. It is apparent that
absolute accuracy in future estimated
concerning receipts and. disbursements
can not be reached. Enough appears,
however, to justify a conservative re
duction in taxes."

STUDY THE MESSAGE.
Europe Muoh Interested in the Mes
sage of Roosevelt to the Congress—
His Utterance on the Monroe Doo
trine Gives Rise to Some Notes of
Apprehension..'
London, Dec. 4.—Roosevelt's inessage
holds first place in the afternoon news
papers here today. Comment on It
however, differs little from, that cf thi
morning papers. Strong general im«
proval of the pronouncement which as,
the St. James .Gazette says "Strikes
notes of conscious strength and assured
success," is the pervading tone of the
editorials. The "spirited declaration for
Monroeism will cause a flutter in life
rope," says the Westminster Gazette,
which continues: "If the Kaiser is real
ly of the opinion, as alleged, that the
American peril is the question of the fu
ture for Europe, he will find confirma
tion In the massage. He will.envy Secre
tary Gage's surplus of £15,000,000 avail
able for building Iron clads or other pur
poses, for the American doctrine, back
ed by the American surplus means that
many European ambitions in South
America are foredoomed to failure. We
do not dobut that it is the policy of this
country, if called upon to make a choice,
to stand by the United States in, de
fense of the doctrine. They are also an
American power and it was they who
first suggested1 the idea."
After noting that South America, the
only outlet for the surplus population of
Europe, is largely in possession of the
corrupt Spanish, over whom the United
States throws Its Aegis without guaran
teeing good government, the Westmin
ster Gazette concludes: "It Is not easy
to affirm that in the interests of man
kind and when the United States, after
warning Europe not to enter America,
proceeds itself to step out from Ameri
can continent, that even a theoretical
defense is difficult. The situation has
the germs of an immense controversy in
the future."
Vienna, Dec. 4.—In discussing Roose
velt's message the Austrian papers are
unanimous in praising th.e reference to
anarchists, but on the other points they
are not quite so laudatory. Fremden
blatt comments on the peaceful tone of
the message, remarking that Roosevelt
evidently will not allow himself to be
carlred away by senseless Chauvinists.
Neuswiener tageblat dwells on its "im
perialistic character," adding: "There
lives in America a spirit as 'appendant'
to the Monroe doctrine formula of Eu
rope for the Americans, and this formu
la, altho clad in most peaceful phrases,
pervades the message."
Deuschevolkerblatt declares the poli
cy enunciated must expand American
production, and therefore "measures
for the protection of Austrian produc
tion are required by the dictates of self
preservation." The Austrian Volks Zel
tung believes the strength of the mes
sage lies in the moderation of its tone,
adding: "It speaks in the language of a
strong man who knows he requires no
sonorous words to be heard." Neuweiner
Journal, also dealing with the power of
the message, recommends its close study
so as to "find the means, at the proper
time, of spoiling his game."

A Des Moines Restaurant Being
Fought by the Unions
Women Interested.
Low Wages to Girls Forces Them
Into Vice and Degra«
dation.
Money Will Be Spent to Improve
the State Capitol
Building.
Special to'Tlmes-Republlcan.
Des Moines, Dec. 4.—A remarkable
illustration of the moral purpose under
lying the trades union movement is be
ing given In Des Moines at the present
time and it is just beginning to attract
attention. On Seventh street is a
small restaurant, quite popular with a
good custom, and any evening at sup
per time one may may meet on the
sidewalk a short distance either way
from the restaurant one, two or three
young men engaged In handing out
boycott cards. Nine men out of ten
throw them down In disgust and re
mark on another of those disagreeable
quarrels about "recognizing the union"
or "paying the scale." The restaurant
keeper has appealed to business men
to show him their symapathy and
as an offset a committee from the Des
Moines trades and labor assembly made
the rounds of business houses and
talked it over. Then the women be
came lntWested and at a meeting of
the professional women's league the
committee of unionists was invited to
be present and explain the situation.
This was done. Then the women, made
the discovery that there was some
thing beneath this little boycott on a
restaurant which meant more than a
question of unioinlsm.
"The fight we are making," said the
spokesman for the party, "is for recog
nition of the union and paying the
wages demanded. At the bottom of
this is a moral question. We stand for
living wages for a half dozen poor girls
unable to help themselves. They are
paid some $3 or $4 a week, and they
are required to pay their own laundry
bills. A clean apron every day cuts
a hole in their wages. It reduces them
lo that point where something else
must be done to earn a living. In
short,, to be plain about It, starvation
wpges for girls in such places drives
tftein to the Street and recruits the
army of young women forced to,'vice
and degradation."
When the matter was presented in
this light the professional women's
league resolved upon taking up the
fight, and from this.time on it is ex
pected that the restaurant war will
take on a more lively aspect.
Incidentally and in this connection
one who has interested himself a great
deal in social-questions, Mr. Weeks of
thfc Settlement house, has resolved up
on an Innovation which will lead to
broader knowledge and understand
ing on social questions. He is leader
of a Sunday school class at the Ply
mouth church. The class Is composed
of men of active minds and courageous,
and they have been straying, away
from the text and taking up all sorts
of subects more or less suggested by
study of the gospels. Now the class Is
to go a step further and will listen to
short talks from men who are thinkers
and workers in all lines. It is to be
come an open forum. There are some
ottfer churches in Des Moines in which
this thing is being encouraged to a
great extent and a number of the lead
ing ministers of the gospel are known
to be quite radical in their views and
expressions on all social questions.
But out of this Plymouth Sunday
school it is expected there will grow a
healthful desire to consider fairly all
present day problems.
The unwillingness of the Des Moines
city council to grant a franchise to the
promoters of the electric line to Colfax
unless the promoters will accept a con
tract which binds them to pay 2 per
cent of the gross earnings into the city
treasury is looked upon by thoughtful
ones as an indication that public senti
ment in favor of holding corporations
to a strict accountability is having
Bome effect. The seekers after the
franchise—the Cleveland syndicate of
which Mrs. Butler is the promoter—de
sire the right to run electric cars into
Des Moines, but to pay nothing for. the
right. The company has secured fran
chise rights in Altoona, Mitchellivile
and Colfax and tax aid in all three
places, but has no way of getting into
Des Moines now. But the aldermen
of" Des Moines, doubtless recalling that
a spring election is only a short dis
tance off, have refused to grant any
free franchise to anybody. Unless the
company agrees to pay something it
will not get into the city and there will
be no interurban line by that company.
"Did you ever think," said Secretary
Wesley Greene of the Iowa Horticul
tural society, "that practically half of
the United States is a treeless region
and forestry is not only impracticable
but impossible in all that region?"
Mr. Greene has just finished coloring
a railway map of the United States to
show at a glance the distribution of the
forests of the United States. By a
glance at the map, which Is prepared
for the use of the new Park and For
estry association promoted by Profes
sors Macbride and Pammel, one may see
that practically all of the timber land of
the United States for commercial use
lies in a great belt extending thru Ar
kansas, Louisiana, Tennessee and the
Allegheny mountains, with a patch up
in Michigan and1 Wisconsin and some
down In Florida.
"All this talk about turning to the
forests of the Pacific states when the
forests of the east are exhausted Is non
sence," continued Mr. Greene. "The fot»
ests of the far west are comparatively
small. They skirt the mountains and are
in the valleys, but their cannot take the
Hqntblicmt
placc of the forests now being denuded.
I think the government ought t« take
some action to prevent wanton destruc
tion of timber. When I was in Florida
during the summer I saw timber being
burned off to have the land for pastures.
This is all wrong and should be pro
hibited. But the most we can do in
Iowa is to encourage an interest in
park's and groves and to see to it that
timber is left at the headquarters of the
leading streams. Forestry for commer
cial purposes is not practical in Iowa
or west to the mountains. However,
there is a great work to be done in en
listing interest in tree planting.",
There is not a particle of doubt that
Governor Shaw will make recommenda
tions in regard to the completion of the
state capital in line with the excellent
report of the capltol commission headed
by Peter A. Dey, of Iowa City. The
estimate of $232,950 for completion of
the capitol and complete repair of every
part of it, is not regarded as extrava
gant. Everyone knows tnat the capitol
was far from being finshed when the
commission was summarily dismissed
without thanks. The money need Mt be
all expended in one year or in two years.
For instance the new elevators need not
be built at once, the electric wiring need
not be done or at least the power plant
need not be installed, and many cf the
the things can wait, but from what
Governor Shaw has said many times It
is believed that he will favor the next
legislature planning to finish "the build
ing substantially as recommended by
the commission.
Judge Fee, of the district court In
southern Iowa, has made an interest
ing ruling In an exemption case. He has
held that the fact of the title to prop
erty belng^i* the name oi a wife of a
soldier does not defeat the exemption to
a soldier on his homested. The question
arqse in several exemption claims in
Centerville, and the court has held that
the fact that the title is in the wife's
name is not conclusive that he property
does not belong to the soldier. He can
claim exemption just the same.

8MALLPOX AT DES MOINES.
Over One Hundred Cases of the Dis
ease at the Capital.
Des Moines, Dec. 4.—Dr. N. C. ShHtz,
advisory physician of the board of
health, has advised vaccli&tion of all
qchool children and all employes of
houses who employ large forces of men.
He advised that after Jan. 1 no pupil be
admitted to school who could not show
a certificate of vaccination.
So serious have conditions become
that general vaccination is not improba
ble. There are about 100 cases of small
pox in Des Moines, and quarantine and
vaccination have thus far failed to
check the disease. The board of health
will take action upon the recommenda
tion in a few days.
Considerable alarm was caused at the
state house yesterday when It was dis
covered that one of the stenographers
employed at the board of control offices
was coming down with the disease. She
was quarantined. Dr. Kennedy agreed
with Judge Robinson mere was no cause
for serious alarm. Vaccination and
fumigation of the rooms of* the board
were agreed on as the proper precau
tions. Accordingly, there "was a general
vaccination of the board* of control em
ploye* at once. Last evening the offices
•were "fumigated under the direction of
officers of the oity health department

POISON IN STOMACH.
Condition of Mrs. Gibb's Body Aids
Case Against Miss Toppan.
Barnstable, Mass., Dec. 4.—Enough
tatar emetic to kill twenty persons was
found in the stomach of Mrs. Mary D.
Glbbs, according to the report made by
Prof. Wood, of Harvard, and District
Attorney Holmes had decided to bring
the case of Miss Jane Toppan, the nurse
charged with murder, before a special
grand jury, which will meet Friday.
Prof. A. J. Wood, who has just con
cluded hiB investigation of the viscera
taken from the body of Mrs. Davis two
weeks ago, has Xa,,'v, to find
(that
THE PRESENT SESSION OF
CONGRE8S
Will be unusually interesting on
account of the
she.
died from poisoning. The condition of
the organs of her body indicates death
from diabetes.
Upon Prof. Wood the prosecution de
uends entirely for evidence to substan
tiate its assertion that Mrs. Gibbs and
Mrs. Gordon were poisoned with tar
tar emetic. Tartar emetic is the most
common medicinal form of antimony, a
mineral poison. When admanistered in
small doses continuously, as in case of
slow poison, it stimulates a course of
chronic intestinal infiamation: given in
large doses lOproduces frequently pain,
purging and a final collapse, acting
much as does a heavy dose of arsenic.
Prof. Wdod has given the opinion that
In the case if Mrs. Gordon and Mrs.
Gibbs^ there wefe apparently no con
tinuous jmall'dOBes, but that poison in
sufficient quantities to cause death was
administered at once.
Detectives Letteny and Whitney found
a druggist in Cambridge who knew Miss
Toppan, and who had sold her poison
similar to that which Prof. Wood says
killed Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Gibbs. This
man remembered the transaction and
said he gave it to the nurse only be
cause of her position, and the fact that
tartar emetic is frequently used to ex
cite perspiration. Dr. Wood is now en
gaged upon the organs taken from the
body of A. P. Davis. He probably will
finish the tests in time to make a re
port to the grand jury on this with
other, cases.
JPISTOL
IN EVIDENCE.
Case of Mrs. Bonine Will Go to the
Jury This Week.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The case of Mrs.
Lola Ida Bonine. on trial for the mur
der of James Seymour Ayres, Jr., is ex
pected to go to the jury the latter part
of this week. Three witnesses, inti
mate friends of Ayres, testified yester
day they had seen a revolver in Ayres'
room. Two of them, Duncan B. Hub
bard and Thomas Ford, came from
Michigan to testify. They said the re
volver greatly resembledi tne one in ev
idence. The wrapper worn by Mrs.
Bonine on the night of the tragedy was
again the subject of discusssion, the
defense putting on the stand witnesses
whose evidence was intended to dis
credit that given by Dr. Shaeffer, the
government expert, who had testified
that a careful examination of the wrap
per had failed to disclose the presence
of any blood spots thereon.

Title of Church Property.
Seward, Neb., Dec. 4.—In the district
court yesterday afternoon Judge Stern
berger passeyl on the litigation between
Bishop Bonscum, of the Catholic see of
Lincoln, and Priest William Murphy.
The decision favors Murphy in so far
as it relates to the parish property in
Seward and Ulysses. The Judge sus
tained the contention of counsel for
Murphy by enjoining the bishop from
bringing any action involving church
property and instructing him to await
action by the authorities at Rome in ac
cordance with the canonical law of the
church. The court also quieted the ti
tle to the church property in the two
loans in favor of the parishioner*.

Canal Commission Favors Nicar*
agua Route-Estimated Cost,
$189,864,062.
Comparison of the Panama and
Nicaraguan Routes-Ad*
vantages o! Each.
Estimated Cost of the Panama
Route Something Over.
$200,000,000.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The report of thd
Isthmian Canal Comission was sent tof-4^
•.
•.
congress today. The commission, as an-«'
ticipated several weeks ago, favors tha„
Nicaragua route and makes an estimator
of $189,864,062 as the total cost of con-«
truction of the canal thru Nicaragua.
The estimated cost of the Panama rout*
is $144,233,350, but the report says
would cost $109,141,000 to obtain the
Panama concession. The commission
values the work done at $40,000,000. The
report says the Panama rotfte is feasible
as a sea level canal,while the Nicaragua!
route must be by locks, but Lake Nlcar*
agua will furnish an inexhaustible sup"
ply of water for the canal. The Nlcar-«.,
ague route has no natural harbors at
either end, but satisfactory harbors may*
be constructed. Harbors already exlstA*-':
at each end of the Panama route, tout*^
considerable work must be done at the'
entrance of the harbor on the Atlantic
side. With an adequate force and plant.,.
the commission estimated that the Nic-r^
arague canal can be completed in sixj"
years, exclusive of two years for prepare
ation. Ten years is estimated to com*'-'.
plete the Panama. The total of th«iK%
Nlcarague route is 183.66 miles and the^l?
Panama route 49.09 miles. The estimated ..
cost of operating and maintaining the^ev
Nicaragua canal annually is $135,000fe
greater than that of the Panama canal.?
The estimated time for a deep draught!
vesel to pass thru the Panama canal'la
12 hours and thru the Nicaragua canat^-^,
33 hours. The Nicaragua route, the re-ofey
port says, is more advantageous forV-:.
commerce, save that originating on tho^i.1
west coast of South America. For the^?
gulf ports the advantage is two days,V'rf.
and for most of the ports on the At-^«I?i
lantic and Pacific one day. The Nicar-V
ague route is said to be better for sail
ing vessels on account of favoring^
winds. Hygenic conditions also favor,
the Nicaragua. The commission says
the United States should acquire con-^f
trol of a strip of territory ten mile*
wide from sea to sea thru which to^nild
the canal. The consent of Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica must be obtained to. .,
construct the canal, but the report saytt^ .*-•
this can easily be secured. The conces
sions granted by the Colombian govern
ment to the Panama Canal Company:
have many years to run and new con
cessions cannot be granted the United
States. The report concludes as fol
lows: "After considering all the facts^l,
developed by the investigations madevjKy
by the commission, the actual nltuation^-y
as it now stands, and having in view the^o"",
terms offered by the new Panama Canal^
Company this commission is of the opin-*'
ion that the most practicable and feasi
ble route for an Isthmian canal, to be
under the control, management and
ownership of the United States, Is that
known as the Nicaraguan route." •.
