Thursday, December 15, 1887,
HENEY LITTS, Editor.
It is quite amusing to compare the
statements which some of the Republi
can papers are making, regarding the
country's prosperity during the past
year, with the predictions of disaster
and ruin with which those same papers
surfeited their readers during the last
Presidential campaign. Grover Cleve
land was elected president, but disas
ter and ruin to the country have not
followed, by any means and nobody
believed they would.
The war-tariff-forever Republican
organs at the East do not find their
blind antagonism to tax reduction sus
tained by their party brethern at the
West. The Chicago Tribune, an able
Republican journal, approves and
praises the President's Message. It
declares that it -'rises above party lines
and points a common basis of patriotic
statesmanship on which Republicans
and Democrats are bound by every con
sideration of public welfare and of
political expediency to stand together,"
If the Republican party resists tariff
reduction, says the Tribune, it is liable
to be "overwhelmed." The President's
Message bids fair to divide the Repub
lican party and to unite his own. 2J.

It must be admitted that President
Cleveland has shown himself capable
in dealing with the great questions,
and on the tariff his instincts are thor
oughly sound and Democratic. It is
. . safer to trust his sense and courage
than trust some men who rattle round
as professional reformers, and who
knew all about it and are going to do
wonderful things until the time for
fighting comes. Alway3 right at heart,
Mr. Cleveland has been a hard student
of the tariff question the last two years
and understands it. He sees, as truly
as Frank Hurd himself, the iniquities
bound up in it. He knows, as well as
t Carlisle and Mills, that it must be dis
posed of immediately. And he is no
. mor afraid of it than he was of the
five-cent eWatof bill or the dependent
pension bill.
The main issue in 1888 between the
two great parties will be the tariff or
unjust taxation. The conventions held
this year show conclusively what we
may expect next. In every instance,
the Republicans are- in favor pf the
v present high ta.iff; while, on the other
hand, the Democrats are calling upon
congress for the immediate levision of
the tariff laws to a revenue basis; they
favor the retention of the internal tax
on whiskey and tobacco, and they pro
test against any proposition for its re-
- duction, made with the design of con
tinuing the existing high tariff on the
necessaries of life. The Iowa Demo
crats were the last to speak on this
question. Their unqualified declaration
for revenue reduction in the right direc
tion indicates their faith in the bound-
: ness of .a position which, with marked
effect at the polls, they have defended
through many political campaigns.
They may not achieve but they deserve
success. Possessing convictions upon
questiops of moment, they have the
manliness, fb announce and to stand
by them.
