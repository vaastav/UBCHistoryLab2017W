Completion of Borings Under Hudson
River One of Greatest of Engineer
ins Feats
After half a century of speculation
on the practicability of tunneling the
Hudson river from New Jersey to the
island of Manhattan, it is now possi
ble to walk dry-shod from Jersey to'
New York; The twin bores have been
completed; that is, they have been cut
through and cased in, though of course
some finishing touches are yet to be
put upon them. It was a few days
ago that In the presence of the engi
neers, the directors and a dozen re
porters, V. G. Oakman, president of
the Hudson Companies, split an old
brick bulkhead with a hydraulic jack
and completed the first Manhattan
Jersey tunnel system. There was a
six-inch gap in the wall. A gang of
"ground bogs" rammed the breach a
little wider, and the party crawled
through Into New York city.
The old wall that was cut through
was seven feet thick. It is the relic
of a former failure to tunnel the
Hudson. Twenty-three years ago the
engineers of the old Hudson Company,
after cutting a considerable distance
under the river, abandoned the enter
prise, and walled in the unfinished
work with this brick bulkhead.
Two tube-tunnels run parallel be
neath the Hudson river, the work of
boring them being done under direc
tion of the New York and New Jer-.
sey Railroad Company, but this com
pany entrusted the actual performance
of the work to the- Hudson Companies.
The present tube has been two
years in the course of construction.
Tho tubes will cost when completed
about 113,000,000, and the entire '"ork
will cost about $30,000,000.
collisions due to operating blunders
the risk of travel ought to be nil.
Many Tunnels to be Due.
It having been proved practicable
to tunnel beneath the Hudson river,
the Pennsylvania Railroad undertak
ing will be pushed rapidly, and it may
be expected that in course of time ev
ery trunk line coming into Jersey City
will have its own tunnel. The East
river piercings do' not present much
of a problem. In less than five years
trains ought to be running from Phil
adelphia, to Boston with no water to
be crossed
It Is believed that within ten years
electric trains will make the trip from
Philadelphia to New York In one hour.

The tubes are 5,700 feet lone. 15
feet In diameter and are intended for
one track each, with a sidewalk for
workmen. Two tubes have been start
ed on the New Jersey shore, to run
under the river to Cortlandt -and
Church streets. These tubes will be
16 V- feet in diameter. The tubes Just
completed will connect on the New
Jersey shore with the Pennsylvania
and the Lackawanna terminals. In
Manhattan one branch will connect
with the subway under Fourth ave
nue at Astor Place. Another branch
will run to Sixth avenue and Thirty

length of the tunnel from, the subway
to Hoboken will cost only five cents.
About six hundred men have been em

The latest and most obnoxious
crank In th gastronomic line Is that
deluded epicure who assorts that
Christmas turkey must be served
without "stuffing." He says it is an
anomaly, a thing without reason, an
insult to the completeness of the
bird. lie even declares that it de
tracts from the sweet flavor and dell
cate aroma of the king of fowls.
Thus he thrusts himself into the pub
liv arena, a most unwelcome "butter-
In," striving to accomplish the down
fall of an historic institution. He is
not a true American. He has never
tasted "stuffing as mother made it"
the real Simon-pure article, spooned
out of the deep recesses of the royal
bird In great crumbly masses that fill
the room with ricu aroma and tne

It is the soul of the turkey, Is stuff
ing. With the bird itself one is al
ways bothered alnut what part he
will have whether white meat or
dark; whether a wing, a thigh, or a
drumstick; whether the wish-bone,
the liver, or "the part that went over
the fence last;" but for the stuffing,
American sentiment is universal.
The only question Is: How much does
one dare to eat? And then that en

Turkey straight, without stuffing?
Not while there is breath to sound a

toothsome miscellany of tradition; to

that none of the beauty of its coloring

THE UNCONVENTIONAL SARAH.
It was Thomas Carjyle who said
that nil genius was akin to savagery.
Barah Bernhardt exemplifies this in
the buodolr of her chateau in Paris.
Mme. Bernhardt is a perfect barbarian
In her defiance of all the convention
alities regarding color schemes. Her
sleeping room Is hung In royal purple,
decorated with peacock plumes. Over
her Louts XVI. bed Is a canopy made
of nnspun silk taken directly from the
silkworm cocoon. A great splash of
crimson satin, in the form of a shield,
adorns the confer. The walls are hung
in old tapestries, and in tho interstices
of the hangings are row after row of
tiny monkey skulls, the eye sockets of
which are illumined with electric
lights.
" The "divine Sarah" has parted with
her pet tiger, and now has for a com
panion a large and Ogly baboon, whose
ears have been pierced so that they
may carry huge rings' of solid gold.

Crown at Gardiner Hubbard Mansion
It was originated by Peter Bissett,
and will be put on the market by
1'iorist n. Kramer, of Washington.
Bissett is the head cardener of Mrs.
Gardiner Hubbard, the widow of the
late Gardiner Hubbard, at one time
president or the ?ational Geographic
Society. She is the mother-in-la"w of
Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor
of the telephone. The new rose was
produced at her beautiful suburban
residence, Twin Oaks, Just outside of
the national capital.
The leading florists of the- country
have known of the existence of this
rose for a year and have made various
tempting offers for it, but it remained
for Florist Kramer to offer $30,000

fMica a ranuious sum ror a rose
seems insignificant, however, when it
is remembered that but a few years
ago Thomas Lawson of "Frenzied Fi
nance" fame paid $30,000 for a mere
carnation, while the greater amount
of $125,000 was expended for the "Fi
ancee'' carnation. It Is hinted that
Mr. Lawson cleaned up over $100,000
out of the i-awson pink and the buy
ers of the "Fiancee" carnation easily

Origin of the American Beauty.
And vet the "American Beanty" of
whom every flower lover is fond has
a very, very sad history. A number
of years ago a Washington gardener
who made only a specialty or garden
roses, received from abroad a snip-
ment of plants, among which was a
"mongrel." This, with out-of-door cul
ture produced very large and fragrant
hiooms. It attracted tne attention or

Nothing was known by him of the
forcing qualities of this rose In the
greenhouse, but as he rather liked lt
color and general appearance, one af
ternoon while her hnsband was ab

from Mrs. Ready for five dollars.
Ready, when he retnred and was told
of the sale, believed that -his wife had
asked too much for the flower. Fields
experimented with the plant and fonnd
that it exceeded even his fondest
hopes. He named It the "American
Beauty" and probably cleared $25,000
on this one deal. To-dny Ready is

Attempted Graftings.
Various artifices have been tried by
clever but unscrupulous people to ob
tain specimens of the "Queen Beat
rice" rose, many coming Into the
Kramer establishment where a huge
bouquet of the blooms was on exhibi
tion, offering to purchase at large
prices a single flower for a boutoii
nlere. Others have gone so far as to
order elaborate funeral designs with
the proviso that nothing but this par
ticular kind of rose be used. These
were only dodges to obtain the healthy
wood for slipping and growing, for
the best time to make rose cuttings is
