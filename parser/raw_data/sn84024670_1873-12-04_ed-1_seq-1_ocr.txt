Tho Upper Potomac steamboat Line.
Collingwood, December 3,1873.
To the Editor of The State Journal :
The traveling community in and around
the city of Washington .will no doubt hail
with pleasure and satisfaction the prospec
tive establishment of a new steamboat
line on the waters of the upper Potomac,
as has already been publicly announced.
The promised enterprise will supply at
least two long-existing wants. (Besides
furnishing a cheap and expeditious means
of transportation to market for all kinds
of farm produce for the numerous northern
settlers wbo since the close of the war
have been earnestly engaged in reclaim
ing the impoverished and almost deserted
estates along the Virginia and Maryland
shores, it will afford facilities for travel to
Msunt Vernon, which we wonder enterpris
ing capitalists had not long since supplied.
The number of pilgrims to this attractive
resort for all who hold in veneration the
memory of the "Father of his Country,"
is yearly increasing, and will increase com
mensurate with adequate means of trans
portation. The present is a fast age, and
many visitors to our city now, whose so
journ is limited by press of business, can
not spare a whole day to make a short
excursion which ought not to require
I more than a few hours, and so do not
visit the shrine at all. A new company
has, we understand, been permanently
organized by the election of a corps
officers whose financial and executive
ability, deep interest in their project and
earnest determination are a sure and suf
ficient guarantee of their success. They
design building during the present winter,
and placing on the river early in the ensu
ing spring, a fast boat, of light draught,
under the management of competent,
obliging and courteous employees,
and as an inducement to all trav
elers who regard order aud safety, they
intend to prohibit under all circumstances
the sale of intoxicating drinks on board,
and their use among all who will be en
trusted with the running of their boat.
Success to their efforts to earn the appro
bation and encouragement of the com
munity by opening new sources of busi
ness, stimulating trade and advancing the
general prosperity of this portion of our
state. X.

More Oranges or Patrons.
Keysvillb, December 3, 1873.
To the. Editor of The State Journal:
Yesterday was a day of considerable
interest and curiosity in our little village.
Colonel Curtiss, the deputy, was here, and
organized a Grange of about thirty, men
and women—the most prominent of the
farmers of Charlotte county—and all
Seemed much pleased after the ceremony
was through with.
J. W. Moreton was elected master, and
J. R. Bailey chosen secretary. From
here the deputy goes to Meherrin;
then to News Ferry, in Halifax county;
then to Haleysburg, in Lunenburg county,
to organize Granges this week; then to
other counties next week.
So the work goes bravely on, and before
this year closes Virginia will have a State
Grange of Patrons of Husbandry.

A cadaverous old fellow, dressed in a

sat down in a restaurant yesterday, and
told the waiter that he guessed he'd
take some "briled fox." The astonished

was just out of that kind of meat, "Gimme
a piece of fried wolf, then," said old
Nevada. The waiter replied that the
wolf meat was also gone. "Oh, wal, sling
along a hunk of mule if ye ar' a little
pinched for grub," continued the stranger.
The waiter replied that they were also out
of mule. "Then what in thunder is a man
gwine to eat?" shouted the stranger as he
moved back. "If I can't git a squar'
lunch in the state I'll leave for Laramie
afore snow flies!" He was afterwards
seeen devouring a hunk of Washington

: was allowed iv those times to be found
without it. As a relict of those times wo
append tho last entry of the sort made in
Henrico county court, as follows:
"March 23,1865,N0. 3347—Isaiah Patter

Interest on Money.—The Richmond
correspondent of the Petersburg Appeal
and Index, noticing the fact that the
new members of the house of delegates
propose, at the ensuing session, to make
G per cent, the legal rate of interest in
Virginia, sarcastically observes: "That
will be very nice indeed. The price of
money here now ranges from 24 to 30 per
cent, per annum. Notes of the city of
Richmond can occasionally be discounted
at 20 per cent., but private paper is relia
ble only at about 25 per cent, discount.
The banks don't discount at all—if they
do it is through middlemen."

A New Fish Trap.—lt is said that a .
splendid eel trap can be made by disem
boweling a dead horse and anchoring the j
same by the neck in the river. The idea j
is derived from the finding of a man's i

customers. His wife, with an eye to busi

set the old mm as an eel trap, whereby
he was of more account dead than alive.

He was greeted with an immense audience, )

Everything of Use.—Some people

claimed a kind-hearted passenger; "if she ;
gets killed it will bo a warning to some

The James River and Kanawha

scheme for a year or two, unless they can
show some pressing necessity for this pub

The Cuban Patriot not Heard
From. —During the height of the excite
ment over the Cuban massacres, the New
York Herald published a letter dated at
Yonkers, New York, and signed "Walter
Stuart,'' in which the writer stated that a
brother of his had fallen a victim to Spanish
cruelty, and that such was his indignation
and grief at the manner of his taking off
that ho would raise a regiment of men
to avenge the deed, and also for
every $150,000 raised to aid the cause
of Cuba ho would plank down
9100,000. The letter also stated that
after a certain time, sometime since
elapsed, his postofflce address would
be Richmond, Virginia. Enquiry at the
Kstoffice here developes the fact that there
3 thirty-six letters lying at tho office
addressed to "Colonel Walter Stuart"
uncalled for. One w from this city;
wore forwarded from Yonkers,
New York, and the remainder came
directed to tno Richmond office from vari
ous parts of the country. It is now
surmised that the ''Walter Stuart" letter
published in The Herald was one of the
sensational dodges for which that paper is
so famous, and that "Walter Stuart"*to»

Tho I.ouilun Press on Grant's Messnae.
London, December 4—5 A. M.~The
Times, in a leader on President Grant's
message, says: "The excessive privileges
in regard to freedom from search claimed
for vessels bearing the American flag would
confer immunity on an open pirate. Such
pretensions are indeed short-sighted for a
mercantile nation.
"We cannot for a moment believe Con
gress will adopt the suggestion to prohibit
national banks from payiDg interest on de
posits. We do not agree with tho Presi
dent's financial remarks generally, and
think he is wrong in attributing the recent
troubles to the peculiar character oi the
currency. The advice to resume specie
payments would be more satisfactory if
the President told the country how to do
it."
Tho article praises the message for its
moderation of tone in general, and on the
Cuban question particularly. England
will unreservedly support the policy which
requires that Spain must really as well as
nominally control Cuba.
The Daily News says the President's
messago concerning the Virginius affair is
moderate and dignified.
The Daily Telegraph sees iv the de
mand for the abolition of slavery in Cuba
a menace which will greatly increase the
difficulties of Castelar's situation.
The Standard thinks the only result that
threats against Spain will have, will be to
hinder an adjustment.
CUBA.
Reported Avenging of »»««■' Murdered
Patriots—2oo Prisoners Shot In Front
of Santiago—Etc.
New York, December 4.—The Sun
says a private letter has been received in
this city, showing that the Cubans have
partly avenged the murder of the patriots
taken on the Virginius. On learning of
their execution, Maximo Gamez attacked
and captured a number of Spanish forti
fied camps in the vicinity of Santiago.
He made over two hundred prisoners, and
marching them close up to Santiago, shot
them in full view of the Spanish fortifica
tions, and then sent in word to Burriel
to come out and bury them. Burriel
left immediately for Havana.
A Key West dispatch says a draft of
sixty-two men has been ordered on the
Pawnee from New Orleans.
Admiral Scott is informed from Santiago
that the commandant of volunteers has
promised to use no further violence towards
the Cuban prisoners without informing
t'ommander Brains ofthe Juniata.
