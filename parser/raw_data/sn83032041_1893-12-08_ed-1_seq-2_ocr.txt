says the Wilson tariff Till is in accord

will support it with the greatest cordial

Friday last General William Lilly,

death created great isurprise to all his

Jons 1'ai.mkk, the inventor of the rail
way check system, died recently in a
little town in Michigan. Many years
ago he was a tiddler, and took charge of
the hats and wraps of those who came to
dancing parties. He gave numbered
checks for them; and some railroad men
who attended one of his dances appro
priated the idea, and in a little while
the system was adopted all over the
country.

The great strike on the Lehigh Valley
road was declared off at : o'clock on
Wednesday morning, both sides making
concessions. This action was the re
sult of a conference between a joint com
mittee, composed of members of the
board of arbitration of New York and
Mew Jersey, on one side, and I 'resident
Wilbur, of the I high Valley road, on
the other. The conference lasted three
days, which was participated in by the i
chiefs of the local and national labor :
organizations who took purt in the i
strike.

Tiik Democrats of the ways and
means committee have acted wisely in
deciding to take up the tariff bill on
Monday next. It should have the first
place on the calender and be pressed to
a passage w ith no unnecessary delay.
There is no occasion for a long debate.
The whole subject has been discussed,
in general and in detail, for the past six
years. Talk in congress will change no
member's vote. The country has had
talk enough. There is no sense in ar
guing after the verdict has been ren
dered, iepeated and sustained by the
tribunal of last resort. The reople have
demanded a reform of the tariff. Their
mandate should be obeyed.
Business has a right to know as soon
as Kissible what the changes are to be,
says the Xew York V.'urLl.
The Senate Finance committee has rec
ognized the imjiortauce of despatch and
will proceed with the consideration of
the bill without waiting for its passing
by the House.
The time gained by the Organization
of congress in August, which resulted in
a carefully prepared bill
before the !
meeting in regular session, ought to be j
utilized now by a vigorous ouhinn- of i
iLe measure to a final vote. J
The message of the President to con
gress, says the rhiludclphin i:rnl, is
disappointing. It is a budget of inter
esting recapitulations of mailers mainly
within the public kaowlede; but it is
extremely barren of original recommen
dations. The 1'rcsidei.t ati.-t. s hiinsilf
with statements of fad, leaving the in
itiative of lcgi.-lutiou to cong:ss. For
the reasons in support uf sti'h recom
mendations as he d.KS make the reader
of the me.-age will have to co isult the
department reports.
Full faith is given to the Il.'ount re
port as otalilishing the forcible inter
vention of the United States in ov r
throwing the Hawaiian monarchy. The
obligation of the 1'nited States to undo
the wrong and restore as far as practica
ble the status before existing is distinct
ly asserted. The instructions given to
Minister Willis are undisclosed. It is
reassuring to he informed, however, that
they do not go beyond the constitutional
limits of executive power. This will re
lieve apprehension lest the provisional
government at Honolulu may have lccn
toppled over by the direct pu.-h of Uni
ted States marines. It is altogether pro-,
liable that congress will lift the blanket
covering the administration's Hawaiian
policy, which the I'resident at present
leaves undisturlied, awaiting additional
advices for data for a special message on
the subject. .
On the financial tjuestion no positive
recommendation is made, except that
the President le empowered to iuvite
other nations to a conference ou the
subject of coinage when he shall deem
the time rie for it; and that tiie author
ity of the secretary of the treasury to
issue bonds shall be made clear, un
hampered by present disadvantageous
regulations as to the rate of interest ami
time of maturity.
As to tariff reform, the President con
tents himself with strong generalizations,
descending no further to particulars than
the indorsement of the bill prepared by
the committee of ways and means. He
gives the hint that in recasting internal
revenue taxes a tax may be laid upon
incomes derived from certain certiorate
investments.
In the House of Representatives on
Monday the Hon. William II. Hines, a
Democrat who represents the Twelfth
Pennsylvania district, says the New
York Sun, asked unanimous consent for
the consideration of a resolution for the
appointment of a committee of live
members to investigate the strike on
the Ix'high Valley Railroad. One of
the duties of the proposed investigating
commitee is to recommend legislation
for the prevention of strikes, a com
mission about as practical as an inquiry
into the feasibility of perpetual motion.
The Hon. Cutis tan tine Ruckloy Kilgore
of Texas put his firm objecting foot
upon Mr. Hines's resolution, and it was
referred under the rules. Its projter
destination would be the Committee on
Ventilation and Acoustics.

It is always the wage earner that is to
suffer by tariff reduction; when the tar
iff is put up, it is still the wage-earner
that must pay. The monotony of this
thing has grown tedious. The nation
has repudiated it already, and members
of congress must have even less than the
average share of sense if they can be
Stampeded by any such nonsense.
This is a favorable opportunity to re
duce wages, no doubt. There are a
great many unemployed men and labor
generally rates low in the market. As
business revives it will be harder to get
the right kind of help and employers
may have to pay more. Put they will
pay just as little as they can, whether
the tariff I high or low, and' they
might as well acknowledge the truth.
Where the new taiiff is going to help
labor is by allowing more constant em
ployment and an enlarged demand.
That will send wages up. Put the pre
tense that wages are ever directly regu
lated by the rate of duties is a trans
parent mockery.

really where the great strength ol the j

not for the few. The . I leinocrals who j
framed it are true U-lievcis in the d.e- ,
trine ol the greatest gootl to tlie great-
est number. The R
pub. leans w ho in !
disparagement of the bill saul it was j
built upon the lines of the Walker tariff j
of lS4i, could liardiy have given the
bill greater praise, as the Waiker tariff
was one of the IksI the country ever had,
and the people of all classes were never
more prosperous than while it was in
existence-.
President Cleveland has congratulated
the I'enitM rals of the
'nu iti.m;; .
conuiKltee upon the statesmanlike man-
ner in w hich they prepared the tariff
bill, in several instance nii iiiUis voting
to put articles on the free list, such as
iron ore, coal and silver lead or-, that
their constituents would have preferred i
having kept on the dutiable list and in
his message to congress he will officially
commend their work and urge that the
bill le speedily passed.
The Democrats of the committee 011
ways and means are now at work upon
the internal revenue bill which is to fur
nish the revenue that will be lost by re
forming the tariff. It is estimated that
this loss will le somewhere letwccn S.'JU,
000, OOO ami .."O.OiM 1,000 a year. The
Democrats of the committee have but
one thought in preparing, this bill, uid
that is, to impose tin-taxes in such a
manner that they will U ar the lightest
upon those who have to work for their
living, and as they are all men of w ide
experience ami great ability they will 1
doubtless rejiort a satisfactorv bill.

Postmaster (ieneral Jlissel has not an
nounced whether he considers it projier
ami advisable to accept the bid submit
ted by the Rureau of engraving ami
printing for printing the postage stamps
that will l; required next year, but the
other fellows are getting frightened ami
are tilling such of the local papers as
are open to such subsidized matter with
so-called arguments against the the gov
ernment printing its own postage
stamps. These arguments, which are
but a repetition of those brought forward
(when the people begun to discuss the
question of the government printing its
own money) by the agents of the various
bank note companies which had grown
rich by printing government currency.
They ate siminy absurd, and if there are
no legal obstacle.-it is probable that Jen. j
Ri-sell will accept the hid of the Ruivail ,
of printing aud engraving, which is !
Slt.'.l.OliO t.eioW that of the lowest pii- '

not be done any chtaperit is more tit- j
