London, Dec. 6.— Kngland and
-Ireland awoke today from a troubl
ed. sleep of despondency over the
Irish situation to learn the joyous
news of a sensational and wholly im
expected agreement reached between
the English and Irish conferees in
today's small hours.
The nogotiations for a settlement
were considered yesterday to have'
definitely collapsed and ths compro
mise achieved in Premier Lloyd
George's somber little official home
in Downing street after a njght long
struggle seems likely to be chroni
cled as the most momeptuous event
in the history of Anglo-Irish rela
tions.
Peace In Staht
Belfast, Dec. 7.:—In a message
from Sir James Craig received by
Lady Craig at Ratheiland, county
Down, today, the Ulster premier said
"It now appears to me that peacfe
may possibly, be within sight if 11
work together to that end with pat
ience and good will."
ItcleasA Political Pri&loncrs
London, Dec 7.—King George to
day issued a proclamation releasing
all political prisioners interned in
Ireland.
wha have been tried and convicted,
it was stated by the Irish office.
London, Dec. 7.—Ulster's attitude
toward the establishment of the Irish
free state was expected to be defined
today at a meeting of Sir James
Craig's cabinet. A copy of the trea
ty, signed by the British and Sinn
Fein peace delegates reached Bel
fast yesterday while parliament was

presentation until he had time to

Here and there amid the general
chorus of praise for the agreement
are sounded notes of warning that
trouble may yet break out. before a
final settlement is effected, and this
warning does not come from quar
ters opposing the agreement.
It is pointed out that nobody, has
yet drawn from Eamonn de Valera,
Irish republican leader, a statement
as to }iis attitude toward the plan.
No Statement By Craig
Belfast, Dec. 7.—Sir James Craig,
Ulster premier, told the Ulster par
liament today that he did not think
it expedient to make any statement
with regard to the details of the
new Irish proposals, as there were
ambiguities here and there in tlie
document.
The Tnaaty.
London, Dec. 6.— Tlie centuries
old quarrel between England and
Ireland was ended, has been fervent
ly hoped .in the small hours of Tues
day morning by the signature in the
premier's cabinet room of. "a treaty
between Great Britain and Ireland,"
consisting of eighteen articles, giv
ing Ireland the title of Irish Free
State and the same constitutional
statuB as Canada, Australia and oth
er overseas dominions.
The question of alleglagce, which
up to the last moment tttr«ia,jtened to
wreck the negotiations, was sur
mounted by permitting the members
of the Irish parliament to swear al
legiance to the constitution o'f the
Irish Free State and "be faithful to
HIb Majesty the King."

co-operation of the two parliaments
in providing certain safeguards in
the event of Ulster remaining out of
the new free state. Neither parlia
ment, however, will be permited un
der the treaty to make laws endow
ing any particular religion, or to im
pose any religious disability.
The treaty looks to Ireland's un
dertaking in the future its own coast

SUPPORTERS OF
HIGH TARIFF LOSE
CANADA ELECTION
First Time in Ten Years New
Parliament W31 Favor Rec
iprocity With U. S.—W. L.
McKenzie King Will Be
New Prime Minister,
Ottawa, Dec. 7 Altho returns
from yesterday's general election
were still incomplete this, morning
it was apparent that for the first
time in 10 years Canada had elected
a parliament with a majority favor
ing reciprocity with tlje United Stat
es.
In the new house of commons W.
L. MacKenzie King, liberal leader,
will have a clear majority over all
parties. He will thus become primo
minister of the dominion. The pro
gressives also favoring reciprocity
and a low tariff will rank second,
and the high tariff party headed by
Premier Meighen, third. Mr. Mei
ghen himself was defeated in Port
age Prairie, Manitoba, his hom6 dis
trict.
The .fall of the Meighen govern
ment with its high tariff platform
was as spectacular as the defeat of
Sir Wilfred Laurier's liberal ad
ministration in 1911 on its policy
o freciprocity with the United States.
The new progressive party led by
T. A. Crerar, of Manitoba swept the
western \provinces, but captured
comparatively few divisions in the
past. This group originally made up
of farmers, stands for tariff revision
dpwnward even more drastic than
the liberals proposed. Its members
are in sympathy with the recipro
city movement
At yesterday's election for the
first time in the political history of
Canada women voted on terms of
equality with men. Miss MacPhail,
progressive, was elected to parlia
ment in the southeast Grey district
of Ontario. She will be the first
woman member of the house of com
mons.

ARBUCKLE JURY
DISAGREED AND
WAS DISCHARGED
Jury That Heard Trial in
Salacious Movie Actor
Actress Case Unable to
Reach Verdict
San Franciso, Dec 5.—Collateral
issues were to the fore in the affairs
of Roscoe Arbuckle the jury, which
tried him on a manslaughter charge
having disagreed and been discharg
ed yesterday.
Foremost among circumstances at
tracting public interest to the motion
picture comedian wa s the charge
made last night by Mrs. Helen M.
Hubbard, one of the jurors, who tried
him, on charges of arising from the
death of Virginia Rappe, that at
tempts had been made at her intim
idation.
Mrs. Hubbard told Milton U'Ren,
as assistant district attorney antl
several other persons that a man re
presenting himself as Gus Oliva, a
commission, man with whom her
husband had business dealings, had
telephoned the husband Saturday
night with the intent of having her
charige her vote as a juror. She let
it be known that she stood consis
tently for Arbuckle's conviction.
URen announced the whole matter
would be laid before the grand jury
tonight.
San Franci-cso, Dec 4.—The jury
in the manslaughter case of Roscoe
C. (Fatty) Arbuckle, was taken to
its hotel at 10:37 o'clock Sunday.
Miss 'Louise E. Winterburn, one
of the jurors, was reported to have
become ill during the jury delib
eration the nature of Winterburn's
illness was not revealed but it was
reported that it was slight.
Judge Harold Louderback, said he
would consider this morning whether
he would hold the jury longer. A
request for its discharge was made
on the ground that the jurors were
"tired out and that it would be coer
cion to keep them balloting further."
CONSOLIDATION OF
(i
BANKSPROPOSED
Guaranty Fund Commission
Believe, Move WiU Make
For Economy and Effici-
ency-—Some Receivers
Would Have as Many as
Five Closed Banks.
Bismarck, i\T. D., Dec. 8—(Spec
^a')— Consolidation of receiverships
of many closed banks in the state
for the purpose of gaining economy
and greater efficiency in handling
their affairs is under consideration
by the Guaranty Fund Commission
and the State Banking Board it was
stated officially today.
Under the proposed plan about 25
receivers would eliminated and
approximately 20 retained. In some
cases, under the proposed plan, one
receiver would have as many as five
banks under his Jcontrol, but in
some isolated' cases a receiver would
have but one bank under his iuris
diction.
Legal phases of the matter now
are being investigated and when a
report is completed the Guaranty
Fund Commission again will be sum
moned in meeting to take up details
of putting the proposed plan in op
eration. The decision follows con
ference of the boards extending ov
er several days.
Under the proposed plan five
closed banks in Renville county
would be placed under one receiver,
who would employ collectors to aid
in his work. All closed banks tri
butary to New England would be
placed under one receiver. The con
solidation would be carried as far
as deemed practicable.
A number of the closed banks, it
is expected, will re-open in the near
future and .in these cases the re
ceiverships would not be embraced
in the consolidated plan.
Another feature of the proposed
plan is that salaries of the receivers
would be fixed by the banking
board. The statutory salary of a re
ceiver is $10 a day. In most cases
at present, it is stated, receivers are
getting this salary, but not in all
cases. The expense ot receivership
would be reduced considerably in
saving upon salaries, it is stated.
Protest A against Oberman
Complaint was made to the state
banking board late yesterday of the
service of H. J. Oberman, receiver
for the Citizens State Bank of Ed
geley. A. G. Porter, Edgeley attorney
W. H. Murfin, Fargo attorney, and

STATEJEMPLOYEES

and New Administration
Expects to Make Big Saving
Through This Agency.
Bismarck, N. D., Nov. 30.— (Spec
ial)—Equalization of salaries paid
to employes of the same class in var
ious state offices is to be undertak
en by the state administration, thru
the state auditing board, it is indi
cated, altho no official statement is
forthcoming.
Salaries in .ao'nie departments,
Notably the board of administration
and state hail department, are fix
ed by the department heads while
salaries of employes in most state
offices are fixed by the legislature.
It has been found, it is said, that
there is considerable difference in
salaries of employes of the same
class, the salaries fixed in the de
partments usually being higher than
those fixed by the legislature.
The state auditing board—com
posed of the Governor, Attorneyl

RESULTS OF WORK OF
NEW ADMINISTRATION
BEGINNING TO SHOW
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 6.—If the
new administration can hold the
pace set during the past ten days it
is going to take a comparatively
short time to get order out of the
chaos left by officials recalled in the
C(ctober election. Governor Nes

Commissioner Kitchen start the
day's work at eight o'clock in the
morning ,an hour earlier than usual
custom, and the industrial commis
sion is usually found in session up
till midnight.
The result of this hard work is
already beginning to show. The
mudilled-up sale situation has been

PRESIDENT HARDING IN
FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE
12 PAGES
SECTION ONE
Pages 1 to 6
Informs Congress That 'a Mos Gratifying World Accom
plishment' by the Armament Conference 'Is Not Im
probable'—Message Delivered in Person and in Pres
ence of Conference Delegat es—Urges Permanent Tariff
and Foreign Debt Refunding Bill—Other Legislation Is
Washington, Dee. 6.— President
Harding informed congress today in
his first annual message that "a
most gratifying world accomplish
ment" by the armament conference
"is not improbable:" The message
was delivered by tlie president In
person in rbe chamber of the house,
and in the presence of the delegates
to the conference and most of tho
diplomats regularly stationed in
Washington.
Ai (he outset, tbe president dis
cussed world conditions, saying "a
world restoration program" would
have to be worked out" by the na
tions more directly concerned." Tho
United States will help, he added,
unselfishly, because there is compen
sation in the consciousness of assist
ing selfishly, because the commerce
and international exchange in trade,
which marked our hrgli tide of for
tunate advancement, are possible on
ly when the nations of all contin
ents are restored to stable order and
normal relationship.
Returning to domestic problems
the president urgently recommend
ed early enactment o ftlie perman
ent. tariff and foreign debt refunding
bills. He also announced that later
on he would make some recommen
dations about renewed consideration
of the tax program involving furth
er reductions and the abolition ot
"hindering burdens." He also sug
gested consideration by congress ot
on amendment to the constitution to
end the issue of non-taxable bonds.
With regard to tlig merchant mar
ine, Mr. Harding said it was the pur
pose to present a plan, which "con
templates no greater draft on the
public treasury, and which, tho yet
too crude to offer it to-day, gives
much promise of expanding our
merchant marine that it will atrgue
its own approval."
Would Encourage Co-operation
"Proper encouragement," for the
co-operative marketing programs as
a means of assisting in the relief of
present conditions in agriculture was
suggested by the executive. He al
so told the congress that it should
give its "earnest attention" to a gen
eral policy of transportation, of dis
tributed industry and highway con
struction, to encourage the 8prnad
of the population and restore the
balance between city and country.
Other recommendations included:
Plans of a conference of a com
mon council of mediation and arbit
ration, and judicial determination in
controversies between capital and'
labor.
Federal aid by way of advances
for reclamation of lands where state
and private participation is assured.
An appropriation necessary to
supply the American relief admin
istration in Russia with 10,000,000
bushels of corn and 1,000,000 bu
shels of seed grain.
