Terrible Tragedy at Jackaoa, Ohio.
The most tragic event in the history
of Jackson, Ohio, occurred Sunday
when Elmer McNeal. a demented coal
miner, armed with two big pistols be
gan shooting In a crowded trolley car
leaving that city for Wellston, Ohio,
Instantly killing Harry White, a young
man employed at the D., T. & I. car
shops; mortally wounding J. D. Van
atta, piano agent, of Newark, Ohio, and
severely wounding J. E. Kinison, su
perintendent of the public schools of
Jackson, Ohio. After some half a
dozen shots had been fired by the
frenzied man he was thrown through
the car window. Reloading his pistols
he made his way up town, pursued by
officers and citizens, who shot him
through the head, fatally wounding
him, after a running fight McNeal
was twice a patient at the Athens in
sane asylum, but was not considered
dangerous. All of his victims were to
tal strangers to him.

1 N
preside!? t'$ JVtes3age
To tl ) Senate and House of Represent'
lives:
As a nation we still continue to enjoy
a literally unprecedented prosperity ; and
ir is probable that only reckless specula
tion and disregard of legitimate business
methods on the part of the business world
can materially mar this prosperity.
No Congress in our time 1ms lonc more
pood work of importance than the present
Congress. There were several matters
left unfinished at your last session, how
eer, which I most earnestly hope you
will complete before your adjournment.
Campaign Contribution.
I again recommend a law prohibiting
all corporations from contributing to the
campaign expenses of any party. Iet
individuals contribute as they desire; but
let us prohibit in effective fashion al?
corporations from making contributions
for any political purpose, directly or indi
rectly. The Government's Itlffht to Appeal.
A bill which has passed one House of
the Congress and which it is urgently
necessary should be enacted into law is
that conferring upon the government the
right of appeal in criminal cases on ques
tions jof law. This right exists in many
of the States; it exists in the District of
Columbia by act of the Congress. I can
not too strongly urge the passage of the
bill in question. A failure to pass it will
result in seriously haompering the govern
ment in its effort to obtain justice, es
pecially against wealthy individuals or
corporations who do wrong; and may also
prevent the government from obtaining
justice for wage workers who are not
themselves able effectively to contest a
case where the judgemnt of an inferior
court has been against them. The impor
tance of enacting into law the particular
bil; in question is further increased by
the. fact that the government has now
definitely begun a policy of resorting to
the criminal law in those trust and in
terstate commerce cases where such a
ccurse offers a reasonable chance of suc
cess. At first, as was proper, every effort
was made to enforce tthese laws by civil
proceedings; but it has become increas
ingly evident that the action of the gov
ernment in finally deciding, in certain
cases, to undertake criminal proceedings
was justifiable; and tnough there have
been some conspicuous failures in these
cases, we have had many successes, which
have undoubtedly had a deterrent effect
upon evil-doers, whether the penalty in
flicted was in the shape of fine or impris
onment and penalties of both kinds have
already been inflicted by the courts. Of
course, where the judge can pee his way
to inflict the penalty of imprisonment the
deterrent effect of the punishment on oth
er offenders is incre sed ; but sufficiently
heavy fines accomplish much.
Issuance of lajunctlons.
In my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to the matter by
the demand that the right of applying in
junctions in labor cases should be wholly
abolished. It is at least doubtful wheth
er a law abolishing altogether the use of
injunctions in such cases would stand the
test of the "ouTts; in which case of
course the legislation would be ineffective.
Moreover, I believe it would be wrong al
together to prohibit the use of injunctions.
It is criminal to permit sympathy for
criminals to weaken our hands in uphold
in? the law ; and if men seek to destroy
life or property by mob violence there
siiould be no impairment of the power of
Iho courts to deal with them in the most
summary and effective way possible. But
so far as possible the abuse of the power
should be provided against by some such
law as I advocated last year.
In this matter of injunctions there is
lodged in the hands of the judiciary a nec
essary power which is nevertheless sub
ject to the possibility of grave abuse. It
is a power that should be exercised with
extreme care and should be subject to the
jealous scrutiny of all men, and condem
nation should be meted out as much to
the judge who fails to use it boldly when
necessary as to the judge who uses it
wantonly or oppressively. , There must be
no hesitation in dealing with disorder.
But there must likewise be no such atue
of the injunctive power as is implied in
forbidding laboring men to strive for their
own betterment in peaceful and lawful
ways T nor must the injunction be used
merely to aid some big corporation in car
rying out schemes for its own aggrandize
ment. It must be remembered that a pre
liminary injunction in a labor case, if
granted without adequate proof (even
when authority can "be found to support
the conclusions of law on which it is
founded), may often settle the dispute
between the parties ; and therefore if im
properly granted may do irreparable
wrong. Yet there are many judges who
assume 'a matter-of-course granting of
a preliminary injunction to be the ordi
nary and proper . judicial disposition of
such cases; and there have undoubtedly
been flagrant wrongs committed by judges
in connection with labor disputes even
within the last few years, although I
think mach less often than in former
years. Such judges-by their unwise ac
tion immensely strengthen the hands of
those who are striving entirely to do
away with the power of injunction; and
therefore such careless use of the injunc-
nvvoM tnd. to threaten its very
existence, for if the American people ever
become convinced toot tnis process is
habitually abused, whether in matters af
fecting labor or in matters affecting cor
porations, it will be well-nigh impossible
to prevent its abolition.
The Crime of Lynching.
In connection with the delays of the
law, I call your attention and the atten
tion of the nation to the prevalence of
crime among ns, and above all to the epi
demic of lynching and mob violence that
springs up, now in one part of our coun
try, now in another. Each section, north,
south, east'or west, has its own faults;
no section can with wisdom spend its
time jeering at the faults of another sec
tion; it should be busy trying to amend
its own shortcomings. To deal with the
crime' of corruption it is necessary to
have an awakened public conscience, snd
to supplement this by whatever legisla
tion will add speed and certainty in the
execution of the law. When we deal with
lynching even more is necessary. A great
many white men are lynched, but the
crime is peculiarly frequent in respect to
black men. The greatest exciting cause
of lynching is the perpetration, especially
by. black men, of the hideous crime of
rape the most abominable in all. the
category of crimes, even worse than mur
der. Mobs frequently avenge the com
mission of this crime by themselves tor
taring to death the man committing it;
thus avenging in bestial fashion a bestial
deed, and reducing themselves to a level
with the criminal.
.Lawlessness grow by what it feeds
upon ; and whm mobs begin to lynch for
Mi fhpv needilv extend the snhere of
their operations and lynch for many other
kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the
lynchings are not for rape at au, wnue
a considerable proportion oi me inaiviu
uals lynched are innocent of all crime,
whom a nv crime committed by a mem
ber of one race against a member of an
ther race is avenged in sucn iasnion
haf if tMm ft a it not tne maiviauai
criminal, but the whole race, is attached,
the result is to exasperate to- the highest
degree race feeling. There is but one safe
rule in dealing with black men t with
white men ; it is the same rule that must
be applied in dealing with rich men and
poor men; that is. to treat each man.

with intent to commit rape snouia De
mila innial rrimp. At ast in the dla-
creticn of the court ; and provision should
made by which tne pumsoment may
follow immediately upon the heels of the
ouense. t
There is another matter which has a
direct bearing upon this matter cf lynch
ing and of the brutal crime which aoms-
times call it forth and at other times
nuTrly f'irnihcs the excuse for its ex
isttnci'. No more short-sighted policy
can be imagined than, in the fancied in
terest of one class, to prevent the edu
cation cf ano.'iier class. The free public
school, the cliince for each boy or grrl
to get a good elementary education, lies
ar the found it ion of our whole political
situation. In every community the poorest
citizens, those who need the schools most,
would be deprived of them if they only
received school facilities proportioned to
the taxes they paid. This is as true of
vre K.rtion of .ur country ns of another.
Ir is as true for the negro ns for the
white man. The white man, if he is wise,
will decline to allow the negroes in a
mass to grow to manhood and womanhood
without educa'ion. ITnquesntionably edu
cation such as is obtained in our public
schools does aot do everything towards
making a man a good citizen; but it does
much. The man who acquires educa
tion is usually lifted above mere brutal
criminally, tireat though the benefit of
these schools has been to their colored
pupils and to the colored people, it may
well be questioned whether the benefit
has not been at least as great to the
white people among whom these colored
pupils live after they graduate.
Labor aad Capital..
In dealing with both labor and capital,
with the questions affecting both corpora
tions and trades unions, there is one mat
ter more important lo remember than
might else, and that is the infinite harm
done by preachers of mere discontent.
These arc the men who seek to excite a
violent class , hatred against all men of
wealth. They seek to turn wise and
proper movements for the better control
of corporations and for doing away with
the abuses connected with wealth, into
a campaign of hysterical excitem?r.t and
falsehood in which the aim is to inflame
to madness the brutal passions of man
k'nd. The sinister demagogues and fool
ish visionaries who are always eager to
undertake Mich a campaign of destruc
tion sometimes seek to associate them
selves with those working for a genuine
reform in governmental and social mcth
od and sometimes masquerade as such
reformers. In reality they are the worst
enemies of the cause they profess to ad
vocate, just as the purveyors of sensa
ticnal slander in newspaper or magazine
are the worst enemies of all men who are
engaged in an honest effort to better
what is had in our social and govern
mental conditions. To preach hatred of
th. rich man as such, to carry on a cam
paign of slaj-lcr and invective against
him. to wek .o mislead and inflame to
medness honest men whose lives are hard
and who have not the kind of mental
twining which will permit them to appre
ciate the danger in the doctrines preach
ed all this is to commit a crime against
the body politic and to be. false to every
worthy principle and tradition of Ameri
can national life. Corruption is never
so rife as in communities where the dem
agogue and the agitator bear full sway,
bee.inse in such communities all moral
bards become loosened, and hysteria and
sensationalism replace the spirit of so md
judgment and fair dealing as between
man and man. In sheer revolt against
the squalid anarchy thus produced men
are sure in the end to turn toward nny
lender who can restore order, and then
their relief at tein? free from the intol
erable burdens of' class hatred, violence,
and demagogy is such that they cannot
for some time be aroused to indignation
against misdeeds by men of wealth; so
that they permit a -new growth of the
very abuses which were in part respon
sible for the original outbreak. The one
hope for success for our people lies In
n resolute and fearless, but sane and cool
headed, advance along the path marked
out last year by thi.4 very Congress. There
rurst be a sfern nfusal to be misled into
ft .lowing either that base creature who
oipeals and panders to the lowest in
stincts and passions in order to arouse
one set of Americans against their fel-
lews. or thatother creature, equally base
but no baser, who in a spirit of greed, or
to accumulate or add to an already huge
fortune, seeks to exploit his fellow-American
with callous disregard to their wel
fare of soul and body.
The plain people who think the me
chanics, farmers, merchants, workers
with head or hand, tne men to whom
American traditions are dear, who e
their country end try to act c'
their neighbors, owe it to thei ..es to
remember that iha most damaging blov
tLat can be gl pea popular government is
to elect an nnworthy and sinister agita
tor on a platform of violence and hypoc
risy. .Whenever such an issue is raised
in this country nothing can be gained
by flinching from it, for in such case
democracy is Itself on. trial, popular self
government under republican forms Is it
self on trial. The triumph of the mob is
just as evil a thing as the triumph of
the plutocracy, and to have e..ped one
dr.nger avails nothing t hatetrr if we
succumb to the other. ' ,
Tbe Kltf ht-IIoar Low. .
So far as it is in our power, it sLuld
b our ahn steadily to reduce the num
ber of hours of labor, with as a goal the
general introduction of an eight-hour
day. There are industries in which it is
not possible that the hours of labor
should be reduced ; just as there are com
munities not far enough advanced for
such a movem?nt to be for their good, or,
if in the tropics, so srtuated that there
is no analogy between their needs, and
ours in this .natter. On the isthmus of
Panama, for instance, the conditions arc
in every way o different from what they
are here that an eight-hour day would
be absurd; just as if. is absurd, so far
as the isthmus is concerned, where white
labor cannot be employed, to bother as to
whether the necessary work is done by
alien black men or by alien yellow men.
Hut the wage workers of the United
States are of eo high a grade that alike
from the merely industrial standpoint and
from the civic standpoint it Wild be
our object to do what we can in the di
rection of securing the general observ
ance of an eight-hour d;iy. Until re
cently the eight-hour law on our federal
Statute books has been very scantily ob
served. Now. however, largely through
the instrumentality of the bureau of la
bor, it is being rigidly enforced..
Labor of Women and Children.
Let me again urge that the Congress
provide for a thorough investigation of
the conditions of child labor and of the
labor of women in the United States.
More and more our people are growing to
recognize the fact that the questions
which are not merely of Industrial but of
social importance outweigh all others;
and these . two questions most emphat
ically come in the. category of those which
affect in the most far-reaching way the
home life of the nation. The horrors
incident to the employment of young
children in factories or at work anywhere
are a blot on our civilization.
Employers' Liability.
In spite of all precautions exercised
by employers there are unavoidable acci
dents and even deaths involved in nearly
every line of business connected with the
mechanic arts. 'Compensation for acci
dents or deaths due in any line of indus
try to the actual conditions under which
that industry is carried on, should be paid
bv that portion of the community for the
benefit of which the industry is carried
on that. is. by those who profit by the
industry.' If the entire trade risk Is
placed upon the employer he will prompt
ly and properly add it to the legitimate
cost of production and assess it propor
tionately upon the consumers of his com
modity. It is therefore clear in my mind
that the law should place this entire "risk
of a trade" upon the employer.
Disputes Between Capital and Labor.
The commission appointed by the Presi
dent Oct. 19, 1902, at the request of both
the anthracite coal operators and miners, to
Inquire into, consider and pass upon the
questions in controversy in connection with
the strike in the anthracite regions of
Pennsylvania and tbe causes out of which
the controversy arose, in their report, find
ings and award expressed the belief "that
tbe Btate and Federal governments should
provide the machinery for what way be
called the compulsory Investigation of con
troversies between employers and employes
when they arise." This expression of be
lief Is deserving of the favorable consider
ation of the Congress and the enactment
of Its provisions Into law. A b'.ll has al
ready been Introduced to this ead.
Many strikes and lockouts would not
have occurred had the parties to the dis
pute been required to appear before an an
prejudiced kodj representing the astloa
and. face to face, state the reasons for their
contention. In most instance the dispute
would doubtless be found to be due to a
misunderstanding by each of the other's
rights, aggravated by an unwillingness of
elthrr party to accept as true the state
ments of the other as to the Justice or In
justice of the matters In dispute. The ex
ercise of a Judicial spirit by a disinter
ested body representing the X-'ederal gov
ernment, such as would be provided by a
commission on conciliation and arbitration,
would tend to creato an atmosphere of
friendliness and conciliation between con
tending parties; and the glvg each side
an eual opportunity to present fully its
case in the presence of the other would
prevent manv disputes from developing into
serious strikes or lockouts, and, in other
cases, would enable the commission to per
suade the opposing parties to come to
term.
Withdrawal of Coal Lands.
It Is not wise that the nation should
alienate Its remaining coal lands. I have
temporarily withdrawn fron settlement all
the land which the ceoloslcal survey has
Indicated as containing, or in all probabil
ity containing, coal. The question, now-
ever, can i properly settled only ty legis
la t Ion, which In my judgment should pro
vide for the withdrawal of these lands from
sale or from ontrv, save in certain especial
circumstances. The ownership world then
remain In the United States, which should
not. however, attempt to work them, but
permit them to be worked by private indi
viduals under a royalty system, I
Control tit Corporations.
The present Congress has taken long
strides In the direction of securing proper
surHU vision and control bv tbe national
government over corporations engaged la
Intei-state business and the enormous ma
jority of corporations of any size are en
crazed in Interstate business. The passage
of the railway rate bill, and only to a less
degree the passage of the pure food bill.
and the provision for Increasing and ren
dering more effective national control over
tbe btef-packing Industry, mark an import
ant advance In the proper direction. All
these laws have alreadv justified their en
actment. It mut not be supposed, how
ever, that with the passage of these laws
It will be possible to stop progress along
the line of Increasing the power of the
national government over the use of capital
In interstate commerce. For example, there
will ultimately be need of enlarging the pow
ers of the interstate commerce commission
along several different lines, so as to give
it a larger and more efficient control over
the railroads.
It cannot often' be repeated that ex
perience has conclusively shown the impos
sibility of securing by the actions of nearly
half a hundred different Stat Legislatures
anything but Ineffective chaos In the way
of dealing with the great corporations
which do not operate exclusively within
the limit of any. one State. In some
methods, whether by a national license law
or in other fashion, we must exercise, and
that at an early date, a far more complete
control tnan at present over these great
corporations a control that will among
other things prevent the evils of excessive
over-capitalization, and that will compel
the disclosure by each big corporation of
its stockholders and of Its properties and
baslneRK, whether owned directly or through
subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This
will tend to put 4 stop to the securing of
Inordinate profits by favored Individuals at
the expense whether of the general public.
the stockholders, or the wageworkert . . Our
effort should be not so muc l to prev'tt con
solidatlon as such, but so to supervise and
control it as to 'see that it results In no
harm to the people.
So the proper antidote to the danierous
and wicked agitation against tbe n en of
wealth as such Is to secure by proper legis
lation and executive action the abolition
of the grave abuses which actually do obtain
in connection with tbe buslnent use of
wealth under our present system or rath
er no system of failure to exercise any ad
equate control at all. Some persoi. speak
as if the exercise of such governmental
control would do away with the freedom
of individual initiative and dwarf individ
ual effort. This is not a fact. It would
be a veritable calamity to fall to put a
premium upon individual initiative, indlvld
ula capacty and effort; upon the energy,
character and foresight which it Is, so Im
portant to encourare in the Individual. Uut
as a matter of fact the deadening and de
grading effect of pure socialism, and the de
struction of Individual character wbich they
would bring about, are in part achieved by
the wholly nnreRUlated competition which
results in a single Individual or corporation
rising at the expense of all others until
his or Its rise effectually checks all com
petition and reduce former competitors to
a position of utter inferiority and subor
dination. ...
In enacting and enforcing such legisla
tion as this Congress already has to ita
credit, we are working, on a coherent plan,
with the steady endeavor to secure the
needed reform by the Joint action cf lb
moderate men, the plain men who do not
wlh anything hysterical or dangerous, but
who do 'intend to deal in resolute common-,
sense fashion with the real and great evils
of the present system. The reactionaries
and the violent' extremists show symptoms
of Joln'ng hands against us. Both assert,
for Instance, that if logical, we fhould go
to. government ownership of railroads and
the like; the reactionaries, because on tuch
an issue they think tbe people would stand
with them, while the extremists care rather
to preach discontent and agitation than to
achieve solid results. As a matter of fact,
our position Is as remote from that of the
Uouibon reactionary as from that of the
Impracticable or sinister visionary. We h-'ld
that the government should not conduct
the business of the nation, but that It
should exercise such supervision as will In
sure its being conducted In the Interest of
the nation. Our aim Is, so far as may le,
to secure, for all decent, hard working men,
equality of opportunity and equality of burden-
. ,
The actual working of our laws has
showu that the effort to prohibit all com
bination, good or bad. Is obnoxious where.lt
Is not effective. Combination of capital,
like combination of labor. Is a necessary
lement of onr present industrial system,
it Is not possible completely to prevent It ;
ind If It were possible, such complete pre
vention would do damage to the "body poli
tic. What we need is not vainly to try t
prevent all combination, but to secure su h
ritrorous and adequate control and superv.s
lon of the combinations as to prevent their
Injuring the pul 'le, or existing in such form
is inevltablv to threaten Injury for the
mere fact that a combination bs secured
practically complete control of a necessary
of life would under any circumstances show
thr.t such combination was to be nresu.ned
to be adverse to the public Interest. It Is un
fortunate that our present laws should for
bid all combinations. Instead of sharply dis
criminating between those combinations
which do good and those corablntt'.ons which
do evil. Rebates, for Instance, nre as often
due to the pressure of bic shlpp-srs (as was
shows In the investication of the Standard
Oil Company and as has been shown since
bv the Investigation of the tobacco and
stVar trusts) as to tbe initiative of Mx
railroads. Often railroads would like to
corabtno for the purpose of preventing a big
shipper from maintaining improper advant
SKes at the expense of small shippers and
of the general public. Such a combina
tion. Instead of being forbidden by law,
should be favored. In other words. It should
be permitted to railroads to make agree
ments, provided these agreements were sanc
tioned by the Interstate commerce commis
sion snd wre published. With these two
conditions compiled with Jt Is Impossible to
see what harm such a combination could
do to the public at large.
Inheritance anil Income Tarn.
The national government has long derived
!ts chief revenue from a tariff on Imports
nnd from an Internal r excise tax. In ad
jltlon to these there 1 every reason why,
when next our system of taxation la revised,
the national government should Impose a
graduated Inheritance tax, and. If possi
ble, a graduated Income tax. The nan of
great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to
the State, because he derives special advan
tages from the mere existence of govern
ment. Not only should he recognize this
obligation In the way be leads bis daily
life and In the way he esrns and spends
his money, but It should also be recognized
by the way in which he pays for the protec
tion the State gives him.' On the one hand.
It is desirable that he should assume his
full and proper share of tbe burden of tax
ation; on the other hand. It Is qnlte as
necessary that in this ktnd of taxation,
where the men who vote the tax pay but
little of It, there should be clear recogni
tion of the danger of Inaugurating any
euch system save In a spirit of entire jus
tice and moderation. Whenever we, as a
people, undertake to remodel our taxation
system along the lines suguvsted, we must
make It clear beyond peradventure that our
aim Is to distribute the burden of support
ing tbe government more equitably than
at present ; that we Intend to treat rich man
and poor man on a basis of absolute equal
ity, and that we regard It as equally fatal
to true democracy to do or permit Injustice
to the one as to do or permit Injustice to
the other.
I am well aware that such a subject as
this needs long and careful study in order
that the people may become familiar with
what Is proposed to le done, may clearly
see the necessity of proceeding with wisdom
and self-restraint, and may make up their
minds just how far they are willing to go
In the matter; while only trained legisla
tors can work out the project In necessary
detail. Rut I feel that In the near future
our national legislators should enact a law
providing for a graduated Inheritance tax
by which a steadily increasing rate of duty
bhould be put upon all moneys or other
valuables coming by gift, bequest, or delse
to any individual or corporation It may
be well to make the tax heavy In propor
tion as the Individual benefited Is remote
of kin. In any event, In my Judgment, the
pro rata of the tax should increase very
heavily with the increase of the amount
left to any one Individual after a certain
point has been reached. It Is most desir
able to encourage thrift and ambition and
a potent source of thrift nnd ambition is
the detdre on the part of the breadwlnrer
to leave his children well off. This oDtect
can be attained by making the tax very
small on moderate amounts of property
left; because the prime object should be to
put a constantly Increasing burden on tha
inheritance of those swollen fortunes which
It Is certainly of no benefit to thlf country
to perpetuate. There can be no question of
the ethical propriety of the government
thus determining tbe conditions upon which
any gift or Inheritance should be received.
In Its incidents, and apart from the main
purpose of raising revenue, an Income tax
stands on an entirely different footing from
an Inheritance tax; because It Involves no
question of the perpetuation of fortunes
swollen to an unhealthy size. Tbe ques
tion is In its essence a question of the
proper adjustment of burdens to benefits.
Education of the Farmer.
The only other persons whose welfare is
as vital to the welfare of the whole coun
try as is the welf:ire of thr w.irewor'.-.rs
arc the tillers of the soil, the farmers. It
is a mere truism to say that no growth

part of the views, expressed ih the report
Mbjcct laid before the Hons? a
its last session, will be passed. it will
of course benetH primarily our seaboard
S'.'KUf as Maine, Louisiana and Wash
Ington; but what benefits part of our peo
ple in the end benefits all: Just as eovern
ment aid to irrigation and forestry In the
ttest is rea ly of beneOt. not only to the
Rocky Mountain States, but to all our coun
ry. cd of Currency Reform.
I especially call your attention to the
condition of our currency laws. The na
tional bank act has ably served a great pur
pose In aiding the enormous business devel
opment of the country; and within ten
years there has been an Increase in circu
lation per capita from 21.41 to $33.03.
For seevral years evidence has been accumu
lating that additional legislation Is need
ed. The recurrence of each crop season
emphasizes the defects of the rresent laws.
There must soon be a revision of them, be
cause to leave them as they are means to
Incur liability of business disaster. Since
your body adjourned there has been a fluc
tuation in the interest on .call money from
- Per cent to SO per cent r and the fluctu
ation was even greater during the preceding
six months. The Secretary of tbe Treasury
had to step in and by wise action put a
top to the most violent period of oscilla
tion. Even worse than such fluctuation is
the advance in commercial rates and the
uncertainty felt In the sufficiency of credit
even at high rates. All commercial inter
ests suffer durina each crop period. Ex
cessive rates for call money In New York
attract money from the Interior banks into
the speculative field; this depletes the fund
that would otherwise be available for com
mercial uses, and commercial borrowers are
forced to pay abnormal rates ; so that each
fall a tax, in the shape of Increased Inter
est charges, is placed on the whole com
merce of the country.
The mere statement ef these farts shows
that onr present system Is seriously defec
tive. There Is need of a change. I do not
pres any especial plan.
Tne Philippine Tariff.
I most earnestly hope that the bill to
provide a lower tariff for or else absolute
free trade in Philippine products will be
come a law. No harm will come to any
American Industry: and while there will le
some small but real material , benefit to the
KUipluos, tbe main benefit will come by the
show.lng made as to our purpose to do all
In our power for their welfare. So far onr
action in . the Philippines has been abund
antly Justified, not mainly and Indeed not
primarily because of the added dlgtnity it
has given us as a nation by proving that
we are capable honorably and efficiently to
btar the International burdens which a
mighty ierple should bear, but even more
because of the Immense benefit that has
come to the people of the Philippine Islands.
In thee Islands we are steadily Introducing
both liberty and order, to a greater degree
than their people have ever before known,
and next spring. If conditions warrant, we
shall take a great stride forward In test
ing their capacity for self-government by
summoning the first Filipino legislative as
sembly : and the way in which they stand
this test will largely determine whether the
self-government thus granted will be In
creased or decreased : for If we have erred
at all la the Philippines It haa been In pro
ceeding too rapidly In the direction of
granting a large measure of self government.
We are building roads. We have for the
Immeasurable ood cf the people, arranged
for the building of railroads. Let ns also
see to it that they are given free access to
our markets. This nation owes no more
Imperative duty to Itself and mankind than
the duty of managing the affairs of all the
islands under the American flag the Phil
ippines, l'orto Klco, and Ilawail so as to
make It evident that It Is in every way to
their advantage that the flag should fly
over them.
Porto Rleo.
American cltlrenship should be conferred
on the citizens of Torto Kico. The harbor
of San Juan in Porto Rico should be
dredged and Improved. The expenses of the
Federal court of Porto Rico should be
met from the Federal treasury. Tbe admin
istration of the affairs of l'orto IUco, to
gether with those of the Philippines. Ha
waii and our other Insular possessions,
should all be directed under one executive
department; by preference thc department
of state or the department of war.
Hawaii.
The needs of Hawaii are peculiar; every
aid should be j;lven the Islands; nnd cir
efforts should be unceasing to develop thorn
along the lines of a community of small
freeholders, not of great planters with
coolie-tilled estates. Situated ns this ter
ritory is, in the middle of the Pacific, there
are duties Imposed upon this small com
munity which do not fail in like degree or
manner rpon any other American commu
nity. This warrants our treating it diffor
ently from the way in which we treat terri
tories contiguous to or surrounded by sis
ter territories or other States, and justifies
tbe setting aside of a portion of our rev
enues to be expended for educational and
internal Improvements therein.

Alaska's needs have been partially met,

Pacific alop, but to the people cf the Uni

Internatloaal Morality.
Not only must we treat all nations fairly,
but we must treat with justice and good
will all immigrants who come here under
the law. Whether they are Catholic or
Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether they
come from England or Germany, Iiustia,
Japan, or Italy, matters nothing. All we
have a right to question Is the man's con
duct. If he Is honest and upright in his
dealtngs with his neighbor and with the
state, then he is entitled to respect and
good treatment. Especially do we need to
remember our duty to the stranger within
our gates. It Is the sure mark of a low
civilization, a low morality, to abuse r
discriminate against or In any way humili
ate such stranger who has come here law
fully and who Is conducting himself prop
erly. To remember this is incumbent on
every American cftlzcn, and it is of course
peculiarly incumbent on every government
official, whether of the nation or of the sev
eral states.
I am prompted to say this by the attitude
of hostility here and there assumed toward
the Japanese in this countrv. This hostili
ty is sporadic and !s limited to a very few
places. Nevertheless, it Is most discredit
able to us as a people, and It may be fraught
'vih the gravest consequences to the nation.
The Japanese people have won In a sln
Sle generation the right to stand abreast
of the foremost and most enlightened peo
ples of Europe and America ; thev have won
on their own merits and by their own exer
tions the right to treatment on a basis of
full and frank equality. The overwhelming
mass of our people cherish a lively regard
and respect for tbe people of Japan, and in
almost every quarter of the union th
stranger from Japan Is treated as he de
serves ; that is, he is treated as the strÃ¤ngt r
from any part of civilized Europe Is and
deserves to be treated. But here and there
a most unworthy feeling has manifested It
self toward the Japanese the feeling that
has been shown In shutting them out from
the common schools in San Francisco, and
in mutterings against them in one or two
other places, because of their efficiency as
workers. To shut them out from the pub
lic schools is a wicJted absurdity, when
Ji'if re D? nm class W"W in the land.
Including the universities and colleges of
t allfornla, which do not gladly welcome
Japanese students and on 'which-Japanese
students do not reflect credit We have as
much to learn from Japan as Japan has to
fr?m as : and no nation is fit to teach
unless It is also willing to learn. Through
Vli ?,an Ame',ns are well treated, and

The Insurrection In Cnba.
nJst f."8.1 a 'n!arrectIon broke out in
Rub Trb.,cn 11 PHly Srew evident that
Jutla Coban government was power
less to quell. This government was re
peatedly asked by the then Cuban govern
men.lu t0 Jntf rne, and finally was notified
by the President of Cuba that he Intended
to resign; that his decision was Irrevocable;
that none of the other constitutional officers
would consent to carry on the government,
nd that he was powerless to maintain or
der. It was evident that chaos was im
pending, and there was every probability
that if steps were not immediately taken by
this government to try to restore order, the
representatives of various European nations
In the Island would apply to their respective
governments for armed intervention In or
der to protect the lives and property of
their citizens. Thanks to the preparedness
of our navy, I was able Immediately to
aend enough ships to Cuba to prevent the
situation from becoming hopeless; and 1
furthermore dispatched to Cuba the Secre
tary of War and the Assistant Secretary of
State, In order that they might grapple with
the situation on the ground. J
When the election has been held and the
new government Inaugurated, in peaceful
and orderly fashion the provisional govern
ment trill come to an end. I take this op
portunity of expressing upon behalf of tbe
American people, with all possible solem
nity, our most earnest hope that the people
of Cuba will realize the Imperative need of
preserving Justice and keeping- order in tbe
island. The United States wishes nothing
of Cuba except that it shall prosper morally
and materially, and wishes nothing of tbe
Cubans save that they shall be able to pre
serve order among themselves and therefore
to preserve their Independence. '
The Conference mt Illo.
la many parts of South America there
has been much misunderstanding of the at
titude and purposes of the United States
toward tbe otter American republics. An
idea bad become prevalent that our asser
tion of the Monroe doctrine Implied, or car
ried with It, an assumption of superiority,
and of a right to exercise some kind of
protectorate over the countries to whose
territory that doctrine applies. Nothing
could be farther from tbe truth. Yet that
Impression continued to be a serious bar
rier to good understanding, to friendly In
tercourse, to the introduction- of American
capital and the extension of American trade,
The Impression was so widespread that ap
parently It could not be reached by any
ordinary means. i
It was part of Secretary Root's mission
to dispel this unfounded impression, and
there Is just cause to believe that he has
succeeded.
Affairs In Central America-
Last June trouble which had existed for
some time between the republics of Salva
dor, Guatemala, and Horduras culminated
tn war a war which threatened to be ruin
ous to the countries Involved and very de
structive to tbe commercial Interests of
Americans, Mexicans, and other foreigners
who are taking an important part in tbe
development of these countries. The thor
oughly good understanding which exists be
tween tbe United States and Mexico enabled
this government and that of Mexico to unite
in effective mediation tietween the warring
republics; which mediation resulted, not
without long continued and patient effort,
In bringing about a meeting of the repre
sentatives of the hostile powers on board a
United States warship as neutral territory,
and peace was there concluded; a peace
which resulted In tbe saving of thousands
of lives and in the prevention of an incal
culable amount of misery and the destruc
tion of property and of the means of live
lihood. 7
Trip to Panama.
I hare Just returned from a trip to Pan
ama and shall report to you at length later
on the whole subject of the Panama canal.
The Algeciraa Convention.
The. Ahreciras conrentlon. which was
signed by the United States as well as by
most of the powers of Europe, supersedes
the previous convention of 1880, which was
also signed both by tbe United States nnd
a majority of the European powers. This
treaty confers upon us equal commercial
rights with all European countries, and does
not entail a single obligation of any kind
upon us, and I earnestly hope It may be
speedily ratified. To refuse to ratify it
would merely mean that we forfeited our
commercial rights in Morocco and would not
achieve another object of any kind. la the
evcut of such refusal we would be left for
the first time in a hundred and twenty
years without any commercial treaty with
Morecco; and this at a time when we ar
everywhere seeking new markets and out
lets for trade.
Protection of I'ur Seals.
Tbe laws for the protection of the seals
within the Jurisdiction of the United States
need revision and amendment. In case we
are compelled to abandon the hope of mak
In? arrangements with othvr government
to put an end to the hideous cruelty now
incident to pelajtlc sealing, it will be a
question for your serious consideration ik
far we should continue to protect and mal 1
taln the seal herd on land with the resu t
of continuing such a practice, and whethir
It Is not better to end the practice by ex
terminating the herd ourselves la tbe most
humane way possible. '
We should as a nation do everything In
our power for the cause of honorable peace.
Nothing would more promote Iniquity, noth
ing would further defer the relgn upon
earth of peace and righteousness, than for
the free and enlightened peoples which,
though with much stumbling and many
shortcomings, nevertheless strive toward
justice, deliberately to render themselves
powerless while leaving every despetisru nnd
barbarism armed and able to work thc'.r
wicked will. The chance for the settlement
of disputes peacefully, by arbitration, ro'.v
depends mainly upon the possession by the
nations that mean to do right of sufficient
armed strength to make their purpose ef
fective. The Army nnd Nary.
I do not ask that we continue to increase
our navy. I ak merely that It be main
tained at Its present strength; nnd this can
be done only If we re; lure the obsolete nnd
outworn ships by rev. and good ones, the
equals of any atloat In any navy. To stop
building ships for one year means th.it for
that vear the navy goes batk Instead of
forward. In loth the army and the navy
there Is urgent need that everything !--siMe'
should lo done to maintain the high
est standard for the personnel, aUle as re

years prior to the Spanish war the secre

CHICAGO.
Business generally exhibits no losscf
strength, although the period has ar
rived when h falling If in new dr
njands Is natural. That the volume vf
production nnd distribution sustain
an unprecedented aggregate is affirmed
by continued gains in freight eirnings
and by a total of bank exchanges this
week establishing a higher record tbsn
any heretofore. Eastern demand for
fcxtmmodation is rrpsonsible fÃ¶r Ã
prevailing firm disco nut mte. hut tbe
return or currency from the Interior
soon may make easier conditions in
money. ! It Is noted that local offering
commercial p.iicr have moderated,
indicating that financial requirements
are mainly provided for until the tern
of the year.
Some heavy consumers find it more.
difficult to obtain necessary supplies
and dlHiculties in transportation have
extended, making deliveries within
reasonable time almost Impossible.
Railroad efforts to relieve the conges
tion are handicapped by the severe
weather In some sections, yet it Is seen
that new equipment Is coming forrrzrl
more extensively and tends to make
the outlook less discouraging fr sifn-
perg.
Retail activity is much stimulated
by the presence of many visitors tstf
the demand for seasonable and Christ
mas goods s'eadily expands. YTLIc
sale orders for spring linos compare fa
vorably , with those of this time last
year, and country advices testify to tn
enhanced buying jwwer nnd gratifying
headway in sales of winter merclB
dise. Manufacturing operations oeet
with no Impediments, except such as
arise from scarcity of lalor and ma
terials, t

ago. Dun's Review of Trade.
Colder weather, combined -with Ih
approach of tbe holidays, has greatly
stimulated retail trade at roost polst
and tbe outlook favors a record -breaking
Christmas trade. The car phortasr;
continues, though grain deliveries In
the Northwest are freer, but oa thfc
whole tbe paucity of railway facilities
is seriously affecting many Kecticss
and In' consequence pome foundries In
the St. Louis and Cleveland districts
have been compelled to close. Manu
facturer are busy the country over,
the pressure beinz, so Treat as to cicns
a considerable nunj!er of plants to
work night ami day. Labor still ccn-
wtinues scarce, and wage advances ar
recorded generally, but the tendenry
to aroid higher wages seems to tc ca-
dergolng continuous expansion. Money
is high In thi cities where the dsrri
is extensive, but most Interior towns
appear to lie plentifully supplied, bence
country bankers are seeking cocscr
cial paper.' Ilradstreet's Mercantile
