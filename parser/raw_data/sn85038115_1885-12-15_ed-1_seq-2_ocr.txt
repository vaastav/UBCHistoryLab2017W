The President's message Is a volu
minous and comprehensive document.

presenting, in -a straight forward, earnest
roanncr the views of tl e rew Eleca'ive
on the various questions now demanding
j rnlJic atien'lon. It is a ptper fdll ol
information and interest to every ci t n
and -will give c r fllence to those who
were disposed to doubt the capacity of a
Demrcratic Peeidcnt to administer the
affaire of the Government Ihelmport
ant questions rela'ing to fliaice, to cur
rency, to comnercH, and to j idaitrv ar
all ahlv and fearles-dp dUcussed, and al
though his views on certain of these
qnentinns mav not be in harm my with a
portion of disown -party, yet all will ad.
roit the lionety' and good faith of the
Preside til in the advocacy of his opin
ions. It is J I9t such a piper as might
be expected frota'oae who, like Presi
dent CLtVLLiKD. has opinions of bis
own. with the willingness an 1 ability to
exprest them. .
The silver q iestion and the civil aer
vice ere the two subjects which ocoupy
most space in the argumentative part of
the message, and upon bth of thif the
President adheres to the position be bad
already taken. That Is, he recommends
the suspension of eilver coinage, and re
news his declaration in lavor of civil
servics reform. v i. ' !;

' Opinion on the Message. .
, A reporter for a Washing'on paper
has been atheilng the opinions , of
Senators and Representatlvrs on tie
President's Message from which wt ex
tract the f-illowing: . .. ; ;
Senator Voorhees, of Indhna,-con'
slderffd it a very able paper, although he
did not aree whh pie Frsfd-nt in sev
eral of the reconjeffendations, partio.nlarlv
that tn regard tO Firver cinsge. O i the
whole, however, there was nctKinz in
the document to preciui'ate a cot Act
among the Democrats in' oppoti ion to
the Execu'ive. The message was well
received on all ides, however, and ev
ery one concurred in pronouncing it a
carefully prepared and txhaus'.ive 'docu
ment.
Senator Iforaan, of Alabama, thought
the message too long and did not think
it would be ea'efor the President of the
United SrtVe to take a t ip across the
Istl mas of Panama via the EvJs Ship
Railway. .
Representative Springer .na'd: -It is'

Hie Frio Traders aud t ho Tariff.
r - .
The Free Trade Conven b-n rcently
held at Ctdcagn sta ed their cae jathtr
strongly . when they dtfl .ed a protec'ive;
tariff aa a omtrivsnce tnr taking by
force the earnings of one class and giv
ing them to another c'as." Still, their
definition has a 'basis of fart. -
True, the r Vrnne officer d es mt pur
sue the -J-eseE Jahks method of making
the victim hold op his hand -while his
pockets are being r fled ; hut the force
applied by the tariff laws, though lea
violent, isnot Irss i flectiv, . Fr extm
ple, man tnnt piy twenty-five dollars
for a sat of clothes whic'i with no tariff
he would "get for t wenty." Twenty dot
lars is the nvoral price; tlat is. the cot
of production with a fair proflt a i led.
Now the ran does not ptv that ecira
live dollars voluntarily ; he does it be
cause the tarid mikes bins pty it; and
V the only alternative is to l i without
clothes it is hardly an ecgzeratiin to
say that the sum of five dollars is taken
from his earning by fore. . '
If the goods of whic'i te suit be mide
are-of dotueMo mtnnfacture, then the ex
ra five dollars goes into the pocket f the
manufacturer, and in that case the prop
option of the Free Trader' Conven
tion is es'ab'ihe l; the "earnings of one
man have been tkei by force and given
to another;" bi If the go ds be Impor
ted the excessive five dollars goes info
tbe Treasury to sup? rt tbe 6 tvernment.
In th:a latter caie it woul I b t ins-e inte
to siy that the money was taken from
one msn and given le nnotber.'
. If the F.ee Tralers.bad appMed the
definition to a prohibitory instead of a
protective tariff it would have rtcren proof
against criticism ; but as the number who
lavor prohibitory tariff is scarcely great
er than the number who favor absolute
free trade they would have been assail
ing the alnvlow and not the -substance.
Yet while the terms "taking hy force
the earnings of one class and giving
them to another" are too broad to be ac
curate aa descriptive of a protective isrifl,
it is not coloring verv big'ily to say that
much the larger portion of tbe excessive
prices paid because of Import du tes is
thus taken from ona and tven to anoih
e'r. - ; , - ;
It is eattlv within the trryh'to siy that
less than one-third of the sum aided by
tbe tarttf to the cast of cwnuodities
goes to sopport the Governmen', and
that -more 1hao two-thirds is merely
transferred from tbe 'consumer to th
manufacture1-. , It must be borne in mind
that everything that man can eat, drink,
wear, or otherwise use, whether in -the
list of dutiable articles or not, costs more
on account of the tariff. Many of the
nfCei-earieB of lie are protee'ed, which
makea the cost of living high; this in
turn 'makes wages higher without mak
ing them more productive to the e-n
ployer or more profitable to tbe laborer.
.'Every implement or instrument wi h
which a tDtn eawr woTk biff more or less .
adder) to the price by ("be tariff, and this
makes ob!!jstory -a large amount of cap
ital '6 produce the' same Amount of com
modilifs. ; Therefore, everything with
which either labor or capi'al enter is en
hanced in CJat by tbe system of custom
dutks. ' , :
. A farmer can't raise a bill of beans
without something being aJ ted o the
cost of production by the tariff. T.ie
labor be pu's on it is higher prioed, and
he 'hoe vbich he puts on it represents a
larger capital.
. But precisely the stme can be id o'
sny. tariff: whether protective or strictly
revenue, and of all tsts, whether dlrec
or indirect. All tariff are evils just as
all taxes are evils;, both beini, within
certain limit, t.cesary an I not unmix
ed evils, tolers'ed in order to prevent
much greater evils Taj.du'y "of the
ststesmsn to each will he done when be
shall have reduced the evils to a tniui
mum; in other words, when -he ehal'
have made their burdens bear eq tall v
upoir ail classes and as lghty -as the
wel'are of the country wit permit.
But the remedy pvopsed bythe Free
Traders' Convention is a rash one. In
their platform they say, "Every protect
ive feature rtfhst at the earliest possi
ble date be eradicated froB our revenue
svstem." .''.,..
By tbe word's "at the earliest possible
dste "" the Free Tradera want precisely
what they sil l, for In or ler to insert
these tney -struck out the word "ulti
mately," and refused to inerl "practica-l
hie" instead of "possible:"
To out off a roan's entire leg in order
to remove a com from hi toe would be
bad surgery, but it hear a striking re
semblance, to this proposition. These
txponente of free trade dtrines seem
to give little or no -weight tothe'fsct that
no -less than fourteen hundred comrno-
'li ties are oirec'iy necen ny -proieoi-
ive features;" that four million laborers
are employed In producing thete'Coro-
moditks; that thoosaorfs of mHiione o
capital are employed inlbeir prodoction ;
that to eradicate evi-ry protective feature
from our revenue system "at the ealiest
possible date" say sows r)y in the new
month would deprive millions of men
of their -present empl ivment -wbi are
skilled In -rrr other; wool! throw mil
lion .o men, women snd children out to
tarve; and would otterfr destroy thoo
ssnds of -millions of capital employed -in
productive enterptisea which onld drag
down with them other thousands of rail
ions intimately interwoven with these la
business relatioaa.
Tb' scheme would " ralicve" m-)r
cspitnl and Inflict more misery. In one
dayi than -would tbe 'protective feature
of the tarrfl in -an retire generation.
If this were a tew country abont to
be established a new government, with a
clean sjate on which to write its eonsti
tntion and laws, the policy of free trade
would be well worth considering ; but.
with all the capital end all the Fabor of
the eoantry adjusted to aome-meatMire of
protection, absolu'e frre trade is vis
ionary scheme, and. i's real tation so far

for its advbcaev Is'ahonl as timely as
would be a meeting to make a pr t-

The cj ration I one of little Interest
except to a very lirai'e I number o peo
ple . Ia ihe nature of things, it is not
likely that the country will ever be bur

of these wrthv citizms at any one
time, and tha kind or q nlity of tbe sup
ply now on hand is not calculated to in
spire mtich enthudaim generally. Tbe
oropoiition, therefore, to make the x
President a Senator for M?e with a large
salary is receive 1 with languid interest
Bit the dis-rmioa discloses a peculiar
drift of public opinion that is of later

bring with it tbe desire to follow the
customs aid practices of aristocratic
governments. A civif pension list is one

as old fingland can boast of.
A i civil pentim list is contrary to the
spirit of onr government, but scarcely a
session of Congress goes over without
some oropoaition being presented look
ing to tbe adoption of a precedent for
measurr of "this character, and a prece
dent' once established is sufficient excuse
for the perpetration of many wrongs.
If a precedent were wanted , fo the
disposition of our ex-Prcsidents a most
admirable one may be found ia the lives
of Washington wnd Jefferson. At tbe
expiration of their respective -terms of
offjje, they each retired to private life,
satisfied with the honors bestowed upon
them by tbeir countrymen Why not
let our ex-Presidents retire to private
life, and enjiy with peace and dignity
the disiingidished honor of being "the
first citizjn of the republic"? '
The-presence of Et-Preeident Hates
at the funeral of Vice President Hew
diicks has revived . 'discussion of the
Great Fraud of 1870, and several news
papers have taken the occ.eton not only
to remind their readers of the enormity
of lhst outrage, hnt aUo to indulge in
some rather violent personal abnse of
Mr. Havss , : j
As a matter of gool taste,' the mere
personal abuse might well have been
omitted on an oocasior, I ke the present :
but it is a dutv of citizenship to keep in
remembrance the monstrooa ou'rage oni
oopn'ar libertv, and all who -aided in tbe
crime and all who knowingly partook of
he intqiitv Tjy receiving its wages, ronst
expect, ss they certainly deserve, to be
constantly exposed to the indignation
and contempt of honest men.
A book recently published, entitled
'The Great Fraud," will serve a good
pnrpode in keeping the . names of all
those who participated in the ereat crime
betore the poMie. It will aid tbe Demo
cratic heads of Bureaus to ferret ont
those scoundrel who were given posi
tions in the departments at Washington
in payment for the servicea they render

be a matter of surprise It is well known
that one pf. the chief conspirators was
Secretary ' that Department d iring the
Hates administration, and it was openly
charged at 'the time and generally be
liever? that appointments . were belna
tmade there, not on the grown I of fi nes
but in payment of soma very disreputa
ble work.
It is a'ated that the attention of Dam

class of appointments, and the antece
