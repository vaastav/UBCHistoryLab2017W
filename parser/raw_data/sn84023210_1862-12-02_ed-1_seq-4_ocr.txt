TUESDAY, DECEliBEli 2. 1862.
Dram or. MtMDift. We regret to ann ounce
thai Nathaniel Weed, the member from Hart
land, died last (Monday) evening, at Mr. fi.
Tspho's. wbre be wae boarding, ilia health
baa been feeble for eoiae months, but he had
been able to attend at hie place in the State
ilouee every day, and was in hie seat yesterday
as usual. He did not, however, go to the State
House to tho evening cession, but was sitting
ia his room talking, and appearing as well as
ueual, when heuddanly fell buck and died in
stantly. It is thought that h:s death was caused
by a disease of the heart.
Thb Pbesimmt's wKiaies We give ur
readers thin morning a brief synopsis of President
Lincoln's Message, sent into Congress yesterday,
together with a few of the first paragraphs of
the Message itselL We had hoped ta puilish
the document eutire in this edition, but the
storm yesterday retarded the working of the
telegraph wires so mnoh that the Message was
net received in rSkston in time for the ereaing
papers cumin, .NuctHh.
The synopsis and thesetfew par ag raphe are all
too briet aud incomplete to justify a word of
comment 4i pon the Message this morning. We
believe, hewever,, that Mr. Lincoln has taken the
right ground, and will steadily abide thereby.
Not a single Termter is report J the list
ol officers dismissed taom serviea for ineffieiesscy,
.abeence, drunkenness, Jbi.
Synopsis of the Pxesidont'i Houagr
The President's Message favors African -eelo-nfcation
and says the opiuion among the blacks
in this respect is improving.
Our foreign relations rsmuin undisturbed
The President knows.ef no mode which prom
ises so certain results as the organisation of
banking associations, unler a general act f
Congree., well guarded in its provisions.
lies endorse the E u tncipslion Act of Sep
tember, lie says there is ne hue, straight w
crooked, suitable loi a national boundary upon
which to divida.
Congress may appropriate money for colonis
ing free colored p-irsMua wiih their own con
sent at any place or places without the United
Staes.
lid recommends the adoption of an amend
ment to the Constitution imposing that every
State ia which larery exist fllull abolish the
game therein betore toe lt ei' January, 187,
the owner to bo -eonipen-atet by the United
States.
Al! slaves who haw enjoyed actual freedom
by the chances of the war. at any time before
tlio end of tho rel eUion shall fce lorever free,
but ull owners ot such who Bhatil not have been
disloyal shall be cimpensitted lor them.
lie urges these proposed artiiclas at some
length, maintaining that wiihont slavery the
rebellion never could liav. existed, and without
slavery it could not coatinue.

Senate bill authorizing bai ks to iue bills of a

the bill in conflict with the law of the list sss.ion

Mr. S tough ton aaid the law of .Congress re
ferred to by Mr. Cree had been declared uncon
slitstional by Judge kelson of the United State
Supreme Court, in hi charge t Grand Juries, nd
be thought the Legislature might therefore safely
treat the law as null.
Mr. Cree aaid that a there bad been no dteU
ioa of the Supreme Court, that the United Slates
law i unconstitutional, it would be wiser and
safer to treat the law a valid, fie had no objec
tion to funks issuing small bill, if hey could
legally.
Mr. Richardson aaid as he biieved Con

S.ESOLVTIOX.
By Mr. Miller of Pomfret, a joint resolution
providing that the joist rule requiring final ad
journment at 3 o' clock 1'. M. et soms Oay, (hall
be rescinded.
There was some diseusaion in refersnee ta this
rtsolutien. Mr. Iloyce favored the resolution,
t a the ground that it waa uawiae to fix se defin
itely the hour of adjournment.
Mr. Denison wa oppod to rscinding the
rule. The forsser practiss had been to hold mock
sessions. It waa different, however, last year, aud
in hia opinion much belter. If the final ad
journment was to be later than luesuayalJ
o clock let it be at Wednesday at 4 o clock.
Mr. Fletcher regarded the rescinding of the
rule ss a necessity only. Ile was as much op
posed to the folly of a mock seasiea as any one
could be, and it was not for the purpose of hold
ing ouch a session, but for the purpose of trana-
acting important buiaess that nefarorea lus
resolution.
The resolution wss adopted on ths part of
the Houe.
Mr. Miller of Pomfret called up the resolution
relating to final adjournment, and moved to amend
by changing Tuesday to Wednesday at 6 A. M. ;
agreed to and the resolution so amsndsd was
adopted.
By Mr. lltrrick, that Mr. .Newton, the member
from Marlboro, shall be entitled to receive pay as

Mr. Cushmaa of Rochester believed trst the

at some length the argument against departing
from a lDg established and safe principle, ssd
believed the tv.ls fesred from abiding by ths ex

It wss urged by Meisrs. Ilubbell snd Chandler
tbat the banks should be allowed this privilege.
It was placing thesa vary properly upon the isms
