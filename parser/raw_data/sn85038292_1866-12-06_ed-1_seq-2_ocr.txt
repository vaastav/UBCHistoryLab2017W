INDICTMENT OF REGIS
TRARS.
The Grand Jury, at its late session,
presented two of the Registrars of this
county for alleged improper discharge
of their duties under the Registry Law.
They are Capt. George W. Shriver, of
Westminster, and Richard Harris, Esq v
ofllatnpstcud. It could not have been on
account of any moral delinquency, for
the characters of both these gentlemen
arc as unimpeachable as that of any of
the Grand Jurors; nor ou accouut of
any disloyalty on their part, for Mr.
Harris has been a consistent Uniou
man, and Capt. Shriver served his coun
try faithfully in the Federal army du
ring the war. Their chief offence has
been that they understood and applied
the Registry Law differently from what
the Grand Jurors and the Radical par
ty would have done. In short, it is our
solemn belief that the guilt of these
Registrars consists in their misfortune
to have come to the honest conviction
itbat the view which Governor Swann,
Ex-Governor Bradford, all the best law
yers of the State, and the Conservative
party generally entertained, was right;
and that the Radical views were wrong.
Now we are not going to reflect on
the moral honesty of the Grand Jurors
who, we have no doubt, acted to the
best of their knowledge, judgment and
advice—filled as they are with the be
lief that the views of their party arc ac
tually infallible, and that all that comes
from their opponents is to be regarded
with the utmost suspicion. In no other
way can wc accouut, with credit to the
Grand Jury, for their having presented
two such estimable gentlemen on a
charge which should be founded on of
ficial corruption. It shows the desper
ate lengths to which party prejudice has
gone, and the great necessity to have
the system of summoning Juries so re
formed as to secure men of both parties
on them, to act as a check on party feel
ings, and purge the sources of public
Justice from all taint of political preju
dice.
If these cases ever come to be tried,
we arc satisfied that the views we have
taken will be fully sustained, and that
many who may now think that this pro
. ceeding is right, will be sorry and
ashamed that it was ever commenced.
They will yet * live to sec that the hard
and illiberal construction put upon the
law by their press and party with such
presumptuous confidence cannot bear
the test of a strict legal inquiry. Wc
are confident that a close investigation
will show that these Registrars were
compelled in the strict discharge of
their duties, if they wished to do jus
tice to their fellow citizens and escape
the penalties of the law, to understand
it very differently from those whose du
ties did not require them to study it so
closely, and whose party feelings would
scarcely allow them to construe it gen
erously. The law gave every claimant
of the right to vote the opportunity to
purge himself on oath of all suspicion of
disloyal intention, and the Registrar
was bound at his peril not to disfran
chise him unless strong proof was ad
duced sufficient to clear away all doubt
i of his guilt, and of his having taken a
false oath. It was astonishing what
slight circumstances were sufficient, in
the mind of a Radical, to convict any
constant political opponent of both trea
son and perjury; and when faithful
Registrars refused to adopt their policy
the threat of indictment before a Grand
Jury was freely tendered.
Neither the constitution nor the law
intended that a man’s secret feelings
should be drawn out to criminate him
self and to disqualify him, and yet the
Radicals always insisted on so construing
them. The Constitution and the law
only disfranchised such as by open word
or deed aided the Rebels, with criminal
intent ; and yet we have seen their Reg
istrars, and Judges of election, disfran
chise men on the silliest pretences—
such as a thoughtless hurrah for Jeff
Davis, only intended to gall a political
opponent, or some such trivial matter.
It was really astonishing to see the ex
tent they would go to exclude a man
who had been a constant Democrat and
liable to suspicion on that account.—
This was witnessed on the part of their
election Judges everywhere. In three
of the districts of Carroll county, Taney
town, Myers, and Manchester, it was
carried this year to a painful extent, par
ticularly in Manchester District, where
. 'hundred* wore turned off by the Regis
trar, and a district which can give three
hundred and fifty Conservative majority,
on a fair and free vote, was made to
giro a Radical majority of seventy-five.
Never was there a greater political out
rage, nor a law more glaringly violated,
yet where is the indictment against
: these unfaithful Registrars! Echo an
"• swers “where?'’ So far from their be*
ing indicted we doubt not the Grand
Jurors are under the impression still*
that they have only done their duty—
aud hence by contrast, we can see why
the ‘chursc of Capt. Geo. W. Shriver
and Richard Harris should seem so odi*
ous in their sight.
To those faithful officers we say—Do
not fear ths Your cause
, is the cause of the People. The beat
legal counsel of the State will feel it an
| honor to defend you; and a sympathi
sing public will cheerfully foot all the
expense.
> IMPARTIAL SUFFRAGE.
5 The advccatcs of impartial suffrage
J mean by it the extension of the right to
• colored men of the legal age ; whilst
1 they hesitate about extending it to wo
) men, some of whom arc now seriously
1 demanding it. Many of them are dis
r posed to qualify the right to such col*
1 ored persons read, possess some
f property qualication, or have served in
f the army. To make it impartial they
• propose to restrict also the whites to the
1 same qualifications. We arc opposed to
- all qualifications of the right of suffrage
- to parties entitled, except the necessary
3 restrictions usually required. If negroes
1 arc to be allowed to vote here, we should
t give it to them to the full extent, same
- as to the whites, and make them eligi
r ble to office. Those who have the right
j to participate in the government should
; by all means be equal ; and with that
i view it will be found necessary to break
, down all social distinctions and to mon
- grelise our people, as well as our gov
; ernment, as soon as possible, so as to get
; rid of those inconvenient ideas which
. difference of race and color seems to pi t
i in some people’s heads.
i Wc arc, however, totally’ opposed fo
i such unnatural We would
1 uot agree to extend the sacred right of
■ suffrage to the smartest, most intelli
■ gent, aud richest negro in the land, for
i the simple reason that, if we conceded
to him the right, we give up the whole
question, and should yield it to- every
negro in the land on the score of im
partiality. We do uot believe the Al
mighty designed that all races and col
ors should mix in the same nation, or
He would not have made them of such
different colors, aud would not have
implanted in tho human breast feelings
and prejudices which prompt each su
perior race to be so jealous of its purity.
We believe that the highest instincts
of the human race are the voice of God;
and if they have prompted men to over
throw slavery by all means, right or
wrong, they will also do as much to
prevent that which is still more repug
nant; the amalgamation of extremely
different races.
When wc survey the world, wc find
its several nations diversified by various
races and colors, but each by an iuilcx
iblc law of nature generally composed
of a homogeneous people. All history
proves the constant war of races, even
of those not very dissimilar. The ruin
of Mexico, in modern days, has been
caused by attempted equalization of all (
races there, where the result has been |
that reins of government have passed I
from the hands of the pure Castilian ;
blood into those of inferior races—five
sixths of the population being the des
cendants of the original inhabitants,
mixed up with other races white & black.
■ We arc not opposed to the Negroes j
enjoying the highest rights of citizen-1
ship ; but we say it cannot be enjoyed !
here, because it would bring ruin both j
to (hem and us. By rigid cnforccmenTl
of the instincts of nature, and common
sense, wc may save our country and
race from debasement; and niay do the
same for the Negro, lie may think it
hard at first; but, as soon as his mind
opens to the conviction of the truth, he
will sec a glorious field opened to him in
Africa, whcnccylie came; and he will
eagerly rush there to fulfil his destiny.
There he can rise to all the rights and
privileges of equal citizenship. This
we acknowledge to be his due—not
here, for we hold it as the highest in
sult to ask our people to destroy their
natural dignity to put him on an equali
ty here. There he may hold himself as
1 superior to the whites if he pleases ; but
here he must concede to us the same
right. For these reasons, imperfectly
expressed, wo give our voice against any
admixture of races, or colors, in admin
istering our government. Wc go for
suffrage as little restricted as possible;
but we believe that to sustain our Rc
• publican theory we need to be as a pco
• pie the highest and purest on earth.—
■ Others countries may be governed by
1 Black \ cllow or Red people; but ours
must be “the White Man’s Govern*
• meat.”

CONGRESS.
This body re assembled on Mond y
3d iost. A new feature was introduced
on this occasion. The Radical Clubs,
Leagues. Colored Zouaves, all sorts and
colors, paraded the streets, under a call
to Washington to greet Congress, which
‘ is swelling in importance as the coun
try’s dignity decreases. Justice Carter
delivered the address of welcome, and
was responded to by Speaker Colfax,
Senator I ates and Judge Kelly. The
speeches were inflammatory. At night
there was a great banquet, at which Mr.
Walbridge presided, and Thaddeus Ste
vens responded in an abusive and trea
sonable harangue. This is a great
. country, particularly the North.
B&.The Baltimore Gazette has come
out in a new dress, its advertising pa
tronage having required an enlargement
of its ample pages, or the reduction of
the size of its type—the latter being the
plan adopted. Its appearance is im
proved. We are glad to see this-evi
dcnce of success.
Improvement in County Jails
and Alms Houses.
There has been a State Missionary
appointed to visit the Jails, Alms Hous
es and Public. Institutions throughout
the State to co.operate with the Com
missioners, Keepers and Physicians of
these establishments in ameliorating the
condition of the inmates, ’ibis they
propose to do by establishing* Commit
tee of ladies and gentlemen in each
county town who will furnish them pure
reading, endeavor to have regular reli- ■
gious services conducted for them, and
visit them occasionally to speak a kind
word and direct them to a higher aim
in life. Also to furnish them with Bi
bles, Testaments &c.
Rev. J. 11. Beckwith, the State Mis
sionary, waited our town last week and
succeeded in getting some of our wor
thy citizens to co-operate in this good
work. The following will kindly assist
those who have, the oversight of these
establishments —Rev. J. T. Ward, Rev.
John A. Munroc, Dr. Warfield, Dr,
Charles Billingslea, Messrs. Norris,
Grammer, Baughman, Sheriff Hoppe,
Mr. Jacob Myers, Mrs. Dr. Warfield
and others.
The State Missionary expressed his
hearty approval of our Jail, which is
quite an improvement to the old one.
There being separate apartments for
male and female, and cells for each
prisoner, so the young offender who has
just begun crime shall not be contam
inated by associating with the hardened
criminal, but may receive such instruc
tion and counsel that his first shall also
be his last offence. This arrangement
is a credit to our Commissioners and
County Officers, and will tend to make
our county respected for the humanity
and consideration shown to the unfor
tunate. We trust others will aid in
this good work by joining this Commit
tee, and Westminster may stand first in
ameliorating the sufferings of the poor
and the erria^.

BSP* "The Camp, the Battle-field and
the Hasp,taC or Lights and Shadows
of the Great Rebellion , is the title of a
handsome volume, just issued by the
National Publishing Company, 507 Mi
nor btreet, i hiUdelphia, Pa. The Au
thor, Dr. L. P. Brockctt, has delved
most industriously amongst the masses
of curious incidents which have mar-,
ked the late war, and has grouped amj|
classified them under appropriate heads
aud in a very attractive’form.
There is a certain portion of the war I
that will never go into the regular his
tories, nor be embodied in romance or ;
poetry, which is a very real part of it,
and will, if preserved, convey to suc
ceeding generations a better idea of the
| spirit of the conflict than many dry re
| ports or careful narratives of events*
i a°d this part may be called the gossip,
the fun, the pathos of the war. This
illustrates the character of the leaders,
the humor of the soldiers, the devotion
ot women, the bravery of men,
pluck of our heroes, the romance ami
i hardships of the service. From the
| beginning of the war the author has
j been engaged in collecting all the aucc
j dotes connected with or illustrative of
it.
The volume is profusely illustrated
with over 100 engravings by the first
artists, which are really beautiful; wor
thy of examination as specimens of the
art. The book’s contents include re
miniscences of camp, picket, spy, scout,
bivouac, siege and battle-field adven
tures ; thrilling feats of bravery, wit,
drollery, comical and ludicrous adven
tures, etc., etc.
Amusement as well as instruction
may be found in every page, as graphic
detail, brilliant wit, aud authentic his
tory, arc skillfully interwoven in this
work of literary art.
It is just such a volume as will find
numerous purchasers, and just such a
one as persons seeking to act as book
agents should add to their list.
The President’!* Message.
The Message of President Johnson
uas delivered at the opeuiugof Congress
on Monday lust, aud was received by us
too late for publication this week. It
is not of great length, but able aud
poi fectly consistent with his past course.
He repeats with great force his views
i i favor of re construction, aud says that
time and reflection have only strength
ened his convictions ou the subject. He
hopes that each department of the Gov
ernment may cooperate in maintaining
harmony between them, and in support
of the Constitution, the Union and the
perpetuity of free institutions. The
finances are considered so favorable
that ho thinks the taxes may be rcduc
ed, and the debt paid in the next
twenty-five years. Our relations with
France he thinks will be favorably
maintained. Also with England, al
though the Irish question looks trouble
some lie makes no allusion to col
ored suffrage.
Another Astronomical Event.
An interesting astronomical event
will occur on the 6th instant. The Sun,
Mercury, Venus and Earth will bein’
conjunction, a’fact that will not occur
again in several centuries. People who
want to see it will please sit up—as
some did for the meteors.— Pittsburg

his age.
The sudden death of this estimable young
man is but another illustration of this sol
* emn truth—“ Man that is born of a woman,
is of a few days and full of trouble. He
cometh forth as a flower and is cut down ;
he fleeth also as a shadow and continued!
not. ’ Young, active, and vigorous, pos
sessed of robust health, and manly beauty,
his untimely decease has startled the whole
community, and shocked his relatives and
friends almost beyond parallel. He took to
his bed on Friday and died the following
Wednesday morning. Truly, in the midst
of life we are in death. Married bat one
short year ago, he had settled down to the
enjoyment of domestic life with fairer pros
pects than fall to the lot of many, and the
steady improvement of his farm bears wit
ness to his untiring industry. But his work
.on earth is done now forever; he has gone
to his rest, leaving a beloved widow, a dis
consolate mother, aud weeping brothers and
sisters to mourn nis loss. let we sorrow
not as those who have no hope ; but endea
vour to look forward with the eye of faith to
a blissful reunion in that better land where
“Sickness and sorrow, pain and Death, are
felt and feared no more:

Schenck’s Seaweed Tonic.
This medicine, invented by Dr. J. H. Schsnce,
of Philadelphia, is intended to dissolve the food
and make it into chyme, the first process of
digestion. By clemsing the stomach with
Schenck’s Mandrake Pills, the Tonic soon res
tores the appetite, and food that could not be
eaten before using it will be easily digested.
Consumption cannot be cared by Schenck’s
Pulmonic Syrnp unless the stomach and liver
is made healthy and the appetite restored,
hence the Tonic and Pills are required in near
ly every case of consumption. A half dozen
bottles of the SEAWEED TONIC and three or
four boxes of the MANDRAKE PILLS will cure
any ordinary case of dyspepsia.
Dr. Schenck makes professional visits in New
York, Boston, and at his principal Ofllce in
Philadelphia every Week. See daily papers of
each place, or his pamphlet em nmaamptien ft*
hi# days for visitation.
Please observe, when purchasing, that the
two likenesses of the Doctor, one when in the
last stage of Consumption, and the other as he
now is, in perfect health, are on the Govern
ment stamp.
Sold by all Druggists and Dealers, price $1,50
per bottle, or $7.50 the half dozen. All letters
for advice should be addressed to Dr. Schkxck’s
