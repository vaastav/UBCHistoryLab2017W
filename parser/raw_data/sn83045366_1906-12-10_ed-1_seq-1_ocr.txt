ONE CORTELYOUISM
Nearly two years of adminis
tration confirms me in the opin
ion that the postmasters of the
country should be appointed by no
party primarily as rewards for po
litical activity, but primarily on
the basis of fitness for the work
and regard for the wishes of the
communities they serve. I know
of no one thing that will do more
for the postal servico than con
tinued insistence upon the policy
of substituting business for poli
tics in the administration of its af
fairs. George B. Cortelyou,
Postmaster General.
In his annual report.
Bpeoial to The Journal.
Washington, Dec. 10.Against a
deficit of $14,572,584.13 in 1905, the
annual report of Postmaster General
George B. Cortelyou, given out last
night, shows a decrease to $10,516,-
995 94 in the fiscal year -|ust closed. Re
ceipts of $152,826,585.10 for 1905 are
eclipsed by Mr. Cortelyou's figures of
$167,932,782.95.
With the proiect of a Chicago man
to give the postal business of the
United States into the hands of a pri
vate corporation, and thus escape the
annual deficit, before him, Mr. Cortel
you says:
I repeat what I said a ea ago that
while it would be a gratifying circum
stance if the postoffice department were
belf-sustaining, I am less concerned
about the deficit than the efficiency of
administration. By a proper system of
accounting, the department can be placed
upon a better business footing and Inci
dentally credited with work for which it
now receives no credit. And as a result
of these and other needed changes the
deficit, which is, in fact, only a paper defi
cit, can be altogether eliminated. Prog
ress towaid these improvements will
open the way for investigations to de
termine the feasibility of the adoption
of many important policies of administra
tionreduction of postage, both domwic
and international, postal savings banks,
parcel post, postal telegraph and tele
phone, and othersthe merits and de
fects of all of which should have in
the not distant future the fullest consid
eration.
Urges Salary Increases.
Of chief interest among the recom
mendations of Mr. Cortelyou is his plea*
for increased salaries in the postal
service.
Good men are leaving the service,
he says, because the rate of pay is
far below that given employees of the
same relative worth in private service.
Then, he adds, the salaries paid are
too small to induce an influx of compe
tent men sufficient to meet the de
mand. Postoffice clerks, railway-mail
clerks, city and rural carriers and
fourth-class postmasters are included
in the plea for increased salaries, with
the increase in the cost of living, the
good of the service and the increases
granted employees of railroads and
other large corporations as arguments.
In behalf of the railway mail clerks,

Cincinnati, Dec. 10.Bellamy Storer,
former ambassador to Austria-Hunga
ry, today replied briefly to the state
ments contained in President Roose
velt's letter to Secretary Boot, which
was given to the press last night. Mr.
Storer insists on the position he has
heretofore taken and reiterates the as
sertions made by him in the statement
to the members of the foreign relations
committee of congress made public last
week. Mr. Storer says:
I seem to have been elected a mem
ber of the 'Ananias club' like all
others who have come into dispute
with President Eoosevelt. I am now
to be classed with Senators Chandler,
Tillman, Bailey and with others who
have questioned some act or word of
the president. Like every other Ameri
can gentleman, who has a wife to pro
tect, I undertook to defend her name
from insinuations and charges of
falsehood.
Mr. Storer says he has four let
ters bearing on the controversy
as to the promotion of Arch
bishop Ireland, all of which tend
to bear out his contention that he
obeyed the explicit instructions of Mr.
Roosevelt, Continuing, Mr. Storer saysi
Archbishop Ireland tola me also
that the president on several occasions
in conversation with him took the cred

Mr. Storer continued in part as fol

Topeka, Kan., Dec. 10.With the

selves from freezing if the cold wave
continues, the residents are making ar
rangements to meet the emergency by
congregating churches and public

The situation has become so desper

Governor Hoch to exert his official
power to procure a supply of fuel for
the sufferers. Petitions already have
come to the governor from Meade, Lib

Are Burning Corn.
It is authentically reported that
twenty towns in that region are vir
tually without coal for heating or cook
ing purposes. Necessity has driven the
people several places to burn corn
to ward off actual suffering. In these
places they have adopted the plan of
gathering in the churches and public
buildings, that there may be a maxi
mum of comfort with a minimum ex
penditure of fuel. Appeals have been
made in vain to the railroads, bu,t the
officials insist that they cannot procure
the cars in which to haul coal. Indig
nation against the railroads is at high
tension. Threats of forcible seizure
are frequent unless relief is soon af
forded.

Poisoning of Girl He Deceived
H- latest Development in Ohi
eago Jllystery.
Journal Special Service.
Chicago, Dec. 10.An unknown girl
has entered into, the Vrsal poisoning
case, opening up a line of inquiry into
Herman Billek's career that-led the
police back five years, and may unveil
a series of deaths similar to that which
followed in the train of the arch wife
murderer, Jokann Hoch. Billek is held
charged with complicity in poisoning
the Vrzal family.
Lieutenant O'Brien has received in
formation that five years ago Billek
was present^ at the death of a young
Bohemian girl whom he had induced
to believe that he would marry, despite
tm? fact that he had a wife and chil
dren.
This girl, according to the police in
formant, had money, and the relations
between her and Billek had progressed
to such a stage that they went to a
South Halsted street to pick
furniture, for the home they
establish. Fell Dead in Store.
While looking, over furniture, the
girl dropped dead. Her death was laid
to heart trouble and stomach disorders,
but the symptoms, as tar as the police
have learned, were identical with those
displayed by the six members of the
Vrzal familv, who have died since Bil
lek became the "family friend."
These further facts in connection
with the Vrzal family have been pried
out of the various witnesses:
Billek at one time worked in a
chemical shop in Cleveland, and was
acquainted with the uses and natures of
poisons.
Gave Pills to Vzrals.
He gave pills to other members of
the family who died, besides the father,
Martin Vzral, and the girl Mary.
He was alone with Mrs. Vzral for
twenty minutes, the day she drank the
potion that ended her life, and when
he came to the* house the second day
he immediately asked for th bottle.''

that he had concluded to use the prize
to establish at Washington a perma

the view of maintaining righteous peace
in the industrial world, which was as
important as the maintenance of peace
in the world of nations.
The president said of the proposed
committee:
The object will be to strive for bet

SEEKS A REMEDY
FOB CROP TIE-UP
Congressman Marshall of North
Dakota on Mission for
theI.CC.
Will Study Conditions and Report
to the Commission at Min
neapolis Hearing.
Bepresentative Thomas F. Marshall
of North Dakota was in Minneapolis
today, en route to investigate the crop
tieup conditions in his state at the re
quest of the interstate commerce com
mission. He has already hundreds of
letters in his possession from grain
growers and shippers in the congested
territory and will devote this week
practically to seeing what his constitu
uents have to offer in the way of sug
gested remedies. He expects to be
Minneapolis next week, when the com
missioners are here from Washington
to conduct their first -hearing on the
car shortage.
"The commission regards the fact of
the blockade as already well estab
lished," said Mr. Marshall to The
Journal today." And while its
hearings will necessarily bring out that
fact, the idea is to get down to the
basic facts and develop the reasons for
the conditions in the congested area.
One most interesting line of evidence
will be that bearing on discrimination
between competitive and non-competi
tive points. I have in hand many re
ports which show that competitive
points have this year received as many
cars as usual, while from non-competi
tive stations come reports of wholly in
adequate shipping facilities. If dis
crimination be absolutely proved at the
hearings, the shippers will be in a fair
way to secure speedier relief than oth
erwise, for the situtaion is a new one
and the powers of the commission are
not well defined when it comes to han
dling the general condition of question
of car service. The handling of dis
crimination, however, is already pro
vided for in present laws.
Service in Canada.
"Another line of information which
the commission wishes to develop is the
service granted to Canadian grain
growers in contrast with that accorded
to producers in the states iust this side
of the boundary. Some of the reports
that have come to me state that the
Canadian shippers are supplied with all
the cars they need by the same rail
roads which on this side of the line
have permitted grain to pile up in use
less heaps. It is no doubt true that
Canadian gram shipped thru the United
States in bond has been moved prompt
ly, but that does not necessarily signi
fy, inasmuch as bonded grain has to be
moved out forthwith under the regula
tions of the customs department. If
there has been discrimination on other
than bonded grain, however, the com
mission wants to know it."
Mr. Marshall will leave this evening
1u& home at Oakes, N. D., and will
make th at town his headquarters for
trros of investigatfrm to cover the week.
In the otheshrppin lines of infor
are being developed by other

SOME "EMPTIES" RECEIVED
Buchanan, N. D., Gets a Little Relief
from Grain_ Congestion.
Special to The Journal.
Jamestown, N. D., Dec. 10.Eleven
empty cars for grain loading were set
in yesterday and the dav previous at
Buchanan, the first station north of
here on thp Northern Pacific. There is
a bad congestion of gram at Buchanan
and previous to this but one empty car
had been received in six weeks. These
empties, tho entirely insufficient, will
help the situation a little and will at
least prevent it from getting ant
worse. For the country immediately
north of Jamestown it may be said
that there is improvement noted, for
while but few empty cars are being re
ceived, there were none at all available
at many points previous to the publi
cation of particular cashes of conges
tion in The Minneapolis Journal.

roads controlled and operated by James

these two systems is merely a starter

Tho members of the commission are
not inclined to discuss their work, it is

Cold Blooded, Unprovoked
Murder Was Done, De
clares State's Attorney.
Promises Evidence to SHow
Premeditated Crime, Not
Sudden Passion. *'3*
1
Murdermurder of his wife, cold
blooded and unprovoked, premeditated
and carefully planned, will be proven
against Henry Sussman if the evidence
the trial sustains the presentation
of the state's case to the jury. In
opening the trial today, John F. Dahl,
assistant county attorney, did not mince
words. The crime at the Glenwood ho
tel the early morning of Sept. 26,
was stamped as a murder. Any chance
of an accidental death, or a suicide, or
even a crime committed on the spur
of the moment in a burst of passion,
was scouted.
Fannie Sussman was deliberately
murdered, he declaredshot thru the
head while she slept calmly and at
peace with the world. The murderer
was the one who, above all others,
should have been the first to shield her
from all harm, the one who had solemn
ly sworn to love and cherish her in
adversity as well as good fortuneher
husband, Henry.
The motive, said the prosecutor, was
revenge and anger caused by the wom
an's inability or unwillingness to help
Sussman out of the entanglement with
the police authorities of La Crosse,
where he had been arrested for for
gery.
Point to Murder.
While many circumstances pointed to
the guilt of the defendant, the prin
cipal ones,# said the prosecutor, were
the following:
The prisoner's threat to take Fannie
Sussman's life, made at the Messenger
home on Dupont avenue N in the pres
ence of the members of the family.
This threat was made in such a cruel
and vindictive manner as to frighten,
all those who heard it and convince
them that he contemplated murder.
The purchase of a revolver and am
munition on the day preceding the
commission of the crime.
The failure to go to La Crosse ont
Tuesday evening, as agreed, and the
registration of himself and his wife at
the Glenwood hotel as "Joseph Tyler
and wife."
The attempted suicide late Thursday
night after his arrival from La Crossa
and learning that he was suspected.
The confession, to the police after
his arrest.
Scouts Insanity Ple&^
According to the state, these circum
stances^ with others, form absolutely
convincing proof that the prisoner com-"
mitted the crime. Any theory of a
quarrel or that the bloody deed was
the act of an insane man is positively
rejected by the state.
The court was packed as Mr. Dahl
began, and from now until the trial
ends, the customary scenes attending
a murder trial will be enacted twice
a day in Judge Simpson's courtroom:
The rush of the morbid-minded to effect
an entrance the fight of the deputy
sheriffs to hold back the throng^ the
crowding of every nook in the rdom
the craning of necks and straining or
ears to see and hear everything that
passes.
Mr. Dahl began with the early mar
riage of the Sussmans. Even at the
time of her untimely death Mrs. Suss
man was hardly more than a child.
Her marriage projred to be a loveless
one, her husband, in whom she trusted,
neglected'his duty, and she was com
pelled to work for hej living. Then
Mr. Dahl went on:
IU Will Toward Wife. $
Sussman's efforts to obtain posses
sion of the marriage certificate and the
destruction by him of a copy of the
certificate were mentioned as evidences
of ill will toward his wife. His con
duct was anything but commendable,
and he neglected to provide for her.
MJrs. Sussman continued to work, al
ways at respectable employment. Suss
man led a worthless life, but often*
promised to reform.
"Finally he abandoned her: With
a view of bringing matters to a head,
Mrs. Sussman swore out a warrant for
his arrest on the change of non-sup
port. For this he received a sentence
to the workhouse. Later he was ar
rested at La Crosse, Wis., charged with
forgery, but was released from impris
onment on bail. t_
Sought Wife's Aid.
"Two weeks before the murder ha
returned to Fannie, not for reconcilia
tion, but to secure her help in securing!
his release from arrest for forgery.
What plan he proposed we know not
but Fannie could do nothing for him.
and it angered him.
