IN SPOKANE
Interstate Commerce Commission
Gives Notice
Spokane, Wash., Deo. 7.—The
hearing by the Interstate Commerce
commission of Spokane's claim that
the Inland Empire is being discrim
inated against by railroads in favor
of Portland, Seattle and other Puget
sound points will be Laid in this city
some time between the middle and
the latter part of January. Members
of the commission will hold a session
in Spokane and receive testimony as
to the validity of the olaim, and
plans are already under way for the
meeting.
H. M. Stephens, the attorney rep
resenting the chamber of commerce
in its battle to have the Inland Em
pire's rights reoognized by the rail
road companies and secure for this
section of the state terminal rates in
equality with coast cities, has receiv
ed a letter from Chairman Knapp of
the Interstate Commerce commission
which indicates in a general way that
members of the commission will make
a western trip in January and will
be in Spokane that month. The en
tire membership of the commission
will not undertake the trip and but
two or three members will be here.
Sessions are to be held in Spokane,
Portland and Seattle, and a meeting
will be held in Denver, the Colorado
metropolis having a claim up for in
vestigation.
It will be shown by the Chamber of
Commerce, which is battli' g for the
Inland as a whole, that the railroads
have been taxing Inland Empire
points with the same rate from east
ern points as is charged to the coast
cities, plus the return rate from the
coast. They will not ask a lower
rate than that given the coast cities,
but will insist on receiving the same
rate.

HE SEES GOOD POINTS
Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 7.—Comment
ing on the president's message Wil
liam J. Bryan says there is much that
is good and much that is bad in it,
but it may be regarded as the presi
dent's most important state paper.
Mr. Bryan says:
"The message contains much that
is democratic ani for which the gen
eral public may well thauk him. It
contaiDs some things that ought to
arouse severe criticism. The presi
dent boldly appropriates some doc
trines which the democrats have been
advoctaing, but on the other hand, he
announces doctrines which are so ab
surd as to excite amusement if the
suggestions came from a less promi
nent source. In some cases he takes
advanced grounds; in some cases, he
retreats from ground already taken."
Mr. Bryan complains that what the
president says on the subject of gov
ernment by injv notions will not be
satisfactory to the laboring man or to
those who respect the right of trial
by jury. The president's stand on
child labor is commended, as is also
the position he takes on the eight
hour law and the right of the people
to criticise a judge.
Referring to Mr. Roosevelt's refer
ence to the Japanese question, Mr.
Bryan says:
"He pays a deserved tribute to the
{''ogress of the Japanese nation and
asks foi legislation which will enable
oongress to preserve treaty rights of
foreigters. That there should be
such legislation can not be generally
disputed, but a great deal depends
upon the character of the legislation.
If any bills are presented in regard
to this suggestion they most be care
fully scurtinized to be sure that they
do not deny to the various spates the
right to protect themselves and their
People in matters purely local."
Finally, Mr. Bryan deplores what
he calls tbe presidents' warlike 'atti
tude. Ha says in conclusion:
ed States. Not that the past grad
uates of this department have failed
in securing positions which will fit
them for their future life work, this
has been proven by the uniform sue
cess, but that the results will be even
greater than before.
At present there are 42 students
who have entered upon the four-year
course. Among this number who
will finish this year are former stud
ents of several eastern and western
schools. This fact alone speaks high
praise for the schools.
The lecture combined with the
practical experiments, including sam
pling, orushing ore, assaying gold,
silver and lead, chemical tests of im
portant metals, wet assaying, etc ,
thoroughly equip a mining student
taking a four-year's oourse. This
course is constantly adjusted to meet
the ohanging conditions in the min
ing industry.
The new equipment which will be
installed in these two new buildings
will give the mining students a prac
tical knowledge of the work he is ex
pected to do upon leaving school and
entering the mines. In the past the
student completed this course under
adverse conditions, now when he
steps forth to seek his livelihood in
the great mining fields, he will know
the "whys" and "wherefores"—he
has had practical experience.—Mos

Government to Buy Silver.
Washington, Dec. 7.—The govern
ment today resumed the purchase of
silver, accepting bids for 2000 ounces
at 68.669 cents per fine ounce. This
is more than 3 1-3 cents an ounce
lower than the offerings which were
made at the time purchases were sus
pended nearly four weeks ago. The
large and increasing public demand
for subsidiary coins which could not
^ met withont add itionai purchases,
are the controlling reasons given by
j tho trea mrv officials for the resump
1 tion. It is said by the treasury offl
oials that p-rchasea will continue for
an indefinite time, the amount to
! depend largely upon the prices asked.
"There will be general disappoint
ment at the warlike tone of his mes
sages when he discusses the army and
the navy as the surest guarantor of
peace which this country possesses.
Shame upon the chief executive that
he should place an instrument of
brute force above the nation's sense
of justice as a guarantor of peace.
The best guarantor of peace is our na
tion's purpose to deal justly with
other nations. War ought to be a
last resort, Dot a first consideration.
It is bad enough to have a few profes
sional soldiers. It is not necessary
that the whole nation shall be keyed
up all the time to the fighting point,."

Tacoma, Wash., Dec. 7.—Captain
George W. Williams of Tacoma and
associates, have acquired title to 100
acres of land in Esquimault harbor,
Vancouver island, and will there
plant one of the largest oyster beds

A company with 1100,000 capital
has been incorporated of which Cap
tain Williams is the managing direc
tor and Colonel J. A. Markham, of
St. John, N. B., president.
Captain Williams says: "The
duty on oysters on the British side
amounts to about $1.25 a hundred
weight except on the spat, whioh is
admitted free. In addition to saving
the duty we will also save freight
charges whioh amount to $1 a hun
dred weight on the Olympia, Grays
Harbor and Willapa oysters from
thia aide. The oyster men here have
no protection, aa oysters are admit
ted to this country free, ao we find
business here as well as giving us
practically two markets.
"We propose to bring the spat
from New Haven, Conn., to stock our
beds."

Improvements
Waldo G. Plain, traffic manager of
the Coeur d'Alene A Spokane Elec
tric Railway, was a visitor in the
city this morning, and while here
stated that the improvement com
pany recently formed, and whioh pur
chased a large tract of land at Hay
den lake with the idea of building a
summer resort of a first class nature,
would probably commence work near
the first of the year and expend about
$100,000 In Improvements.

landscape gardner and architect, of
the firm of Olmstead A Olmetead, of
Boaton, Muse., would arrive from the
east during the month aud after'a vis
it to the proposed site would plan
out the grounds. Following this an

approved by the directors, and the
work will be forwarded with all pus
sible rapidity, with the expectation
of having this model resort ready for
the arrival of the summer visitors in
June.
The plans of the eompauy fur this
miniature city, whioh will be christen
ed, "The Green City In the Pines,"
are not modest and border on lavish
extravagence, for It Is the intent ion
of the company to make this place

give some rare exhibitions of speed

pointed for there will be an excellent
diamond and a good team to meet
SPECIAL TERM OF COURT
Lewiston, Idaho, Dec. 7.—It Is
understood here that tbe possibility
of a special term of the federal court
at Boise to try the remaining north
Idaho land fraud oases Is due to the
deai'.e of the secretary of the inter
lor, E. A. Hitchcock, to liave the
cases all disposed of before he goes
out of office on March 4, 1907.
The matter of holding a special
term of court is now under serious
consideration in Waahingluu, D. C.,j
the matter being largely In the hand*
of United Htates attorney general.
It it is finally decided to call a spe
cial term a federal judge, probably
from the east, will be asked to try
tbe oases.
The statement is made that if a
special term of tbe federal court is
beld, that it will convene at about
the aame time tbe legislature meets
at Boise. The duration of tbe trisls
is ludefinlt*. When Judge Beatty
st Moscow adjourned court so sod
denly s< <1 weeks ago, he said that
if be tr:f'i 'he remainder of the land
frtnd caaru 'hr* it would likely keep
him in t! n.'ve: itv town about six
mouths It :•• tl.uogbt here that tin
remaining (Vises can be disposed of
i in leas than throe mouths.
