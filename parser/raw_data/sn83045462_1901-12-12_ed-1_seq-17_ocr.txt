TRUSTEES IN SESSION
Meeting of Board in Charge of Ameri
can University.
PLANNING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
Fund of Five Million Proposed,
Half of Which is in Hand.
ELEC HION TO FILL VACANCIES
The semi-annual meeting of the board of
trustees of the American University was held
at the offices of the university in this city
yesterday. An unusually large number were
present, including Bishops Chas. H. Fowler,
C. C. McCabe and John F. Hurst; Mr.
John Farson, Chicago: J. F. Robinson,
Rock Island, Ill.; Dr. D. H. Carroll, Balti
more; Charles Scott, Philadelphia; Dr. J.
W. Hill. Harrisburg, Pa.; Dr. C. W. Bald
win, Baltimore; A. B. Browne, B. F. Leigh
ton. A. B. Duvall, Judge W. M. Springer.
Chas. C. GI&W, John E. Herrell and Thos.
W. Smith OW ashington. Others present
,%ere Dft W % Davidson, secretary; Dr.
John A. Ou'term1e, financial secretary;
Rev. Albert Osborn. registrr, and Dr.
Royal Copeland of the medical department
of the university at Ann Arbor, Mich.
In the absence of President John E. An
drus of New York. who was prevented by
important business from attending, Mr.
John Farson of Chicago, of the well-known
stock firm of Leech. Farson & Co., New
York and Chicago. was elected president of
the meeting.
it was announced that the corner stone of
the foundation of the McKinley Memorial
Ohio College of Governinent will be laid
with impressive services during the days of
early spring, at which time, it is expected,
the foundation now under construction will
be completed. as will be, also, much of
the grading which is contemplated on the.
university site. Subscriptions are being re
ceived for the McKinley Memorial Ohio
College of Government. It was stated. In
the lifetime of the martyred-President this
memorial was contemplated, and his tragic
death has given new interest to the per
petuation of his name and fame at the
nation's capital.
The financial side of the year's work was
most gratifying, showing a decided gain
over any recent year. The large holdinigs
which the university has in stocks and
bonds, which have been given for buildings
and endowments. are yielding fine returas.
Fund of Five Millions.
It is the determination of the trustees to
accumulate as soon as possible $5,000,000,
more than half of which is already in
hand, so that the doors of the university
may be opened for post-graduate work and
original investigation, utilizing, as has been
contemplated, the rare and unparalleled
scientiric collections provided by the gov
ernment in the city of Washington, which,
at the instance of the trustees of the Amer
ican University. were thrown open by Con
gress to students. More than 1,500 stu
dents from all parts of the world have
made application. it is stated, for entrance
to some special line of study in the Ameri
can University. and the plans proposed look
to the speedy opening of the doors for
work. The massing of great educational
opportunities in Washington. it Is con
cluded. is destined to attract students from
all quarters. and especially earnest stu
dents from the other side of the sea, who
will come to study at the fountain-head
the successful experiments in government
which have here been made. Instead of
4.000 Americans seeking higher education
across the sea every year they will be en
abled to find what they want in their own
country, and an equal number may be at
tracted from the other side of the water
to avail themselves of the superior advan
tages in educational lines which the mil
lions of money invested will make possible
at the nation's capital.
Many kindly references were made by the
trustees to the princely gift which Mr. Car
negie has just proposed for educational
work in Washington. As the exact condi
tions surrounding the gift have not yet
been made public no definite action could
be taken in the matter, but it was fully
believed that the work contemplated by
Mr. Carnegie would make more certain the
necessity and usefulness of the American
University, and would contribute largely
toward making of Washington the greatest
educational center in the world.
A committee of the trustees called on
President Roosevelt at the White House,
conveying the greetings of the assembled
body. President Roosevelt is himself one
of the trustees of the university.
Memorial to Mr. Emery.
Some important matters were discussed
at the conference. During the past six
months the American University has lost by
death six of its trustees, among the number
President William McKinley and Mr. Mat
thew 0. Emery. who for ten years had
been tr'asurer of the university. Resolu
tions. with reference to the death of Mr.
Emery. were adopt.ed, in which the board
expresses its r. gret at the loss of o'ne who
for nearly eleven years. or during the en
tire hist. ry of the~ unive rsity, served as
treaisurer. it was declared that he was
painstaking and caeref l to the smallest de
tail. lie gladlyv did all his work Without
compensation, and~ was tprompte-d to under
take it because of the lo've he bore the en
terprise. As years grew upon him and
strength failed a little, he sometimes spoke
of resigning, but the expressed conlidence
and. love of his asswiat.es in the wotrk
turned him from his purpose and h~e aci It
to the end.
"As a member of the building committee
he gave much time ar:dl patient thought to
the construcetiotn of thie Hall of History.
His interest could not h.ave been greater
had the buiiding been his own. His fur
ther lnterest ini the university was evi
denced by the donation of a block of val
uable property."~
College of Comparative Religion.
Mrs. M. E. Hlartsock, president, and Mrs.
J. Ellen Foster, vice president-at-large, of
the Woman's Guild of the American Uni
versity, interested in the erection of the
College of Comparative Religion, were in
troduced and addressed the meeting briefly.
This movement, it was reported, is gaining
headway throughout the country among
prominent and benevolent women, and
many annual and life memberships are
being received.
The personnel of the offlee and field forces
remains unchanged for another year. The
trustees elected as president, John E. An
drus of New York; treastirer, Charles C.
Baldwin. Baltimore; treasurer, Charies C.
Glover, Waishington. The executive com
mittee, which will very largely control the
affairs of the university for the coming
year, includes the following: Bishop John
F. Hurst. Judge Thomas H. Anderson,
Thomas W. Smith, Judge W. M. Springer.
B. H. Warner. A. B. Duvall, John E. Her
rel., A. B. Browne, B. F. Leighton, Dr. D).
H. CarrolU and Dr. C. W. Baldwin.
Net a Methodist University.
Dr. W. L. Davidson, secretary of the uni
vemsity, in conversation with a Star repor
ter, strongly deprecated the use of the
term. "Methodist University," so frequently
applied to this enterprise, Insisting that it
was grossly misleamaint The largest single
gift ever made to the universIty came
from a PresbyterIan, he saM,. and in the
board of trustees are repre=mtattles of six
of the lange religios damantpa.. The
and rveretly heistmi, nd, s rtano
its largest success, must of necessity be
under the wing of some religious denomi
nation. The Methodists have simply been
given leadership, but the work is broad
and unsectarian, belonging to American
Protestantism.
The following trustees were elected to fil1
vacancies: Senator J. 'P. Dolliver, Iowa;
Judge Thomas H. Anderson, Washington;
Mr. C. Pice Speer, Chambersburg, Pa.. and
Rev. Thomas N. Boyle, D.D., LL.D., Pitts

CRUELTIES OF FILIPINOS.
Records of Recent Court-Martial Cases
in the Islands.
The War Department has received the
records of several interesting court-martial
cases In the Philippines.
Florentino Oreta, a native, was found
guilty by military commission of the mur
der of his brother, Francisco Oreta, and was
sentenced to confinement at hard labor for
life. It appeared from the evidence that
FlorentAno stabbed Francisco to death be
cause the latter attempted to induce him to
join the insurgent ranks, under threat of
death if he refused. General Chaffee, how
ever, in passing upon the sentence, said:
Although the actual killing is presumptively
proven by a complete chain of circumstan
tial evidence and admitoted by accused, no
eye witness saw the scene, and the record
Is silent as to whether the deed was done In
the heat of struggle." He mitigated the
sentence to twenty years' imprisonment at
hard labor.
A particularly revolting case was that of
Juan Biron, an alleged lieutenant of the In
surgent army. Biron captured at Bas
car-am, In Albay provinge, a native scout
named Felix Losedo, who was in the employ
of the United States, bound him to a tree
and then with a razor cut off one of his
prisoner's ears and slashed the blade Into
his eyes, with the intent to blind the help
less man. He was very nearly successful,
for the sight of one of the scout's eyes was
totally destroyed and that of the other per
manently impaired. Biron was sentenced to
be confined at hard labor for fifteen years.

The statement of gross postal receipts at
the fifty largest post offices in the United

DEMOCRATIC SENATORS
FIRST CAUCUS SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE SESSION.
Republican Propositions Regarding
Changes on Committees Opposed
Mr. Tillman Speaks for Harmony.
The first caucus of democratic senators
during the present session of Congress was
held yesterday afternoon. Its purpose was
to consider committee assignmeits, The
occasion was more than ordinarily signiil
.cant because of the general attendance
upon the caucus. All the senators elected
as democrats, with the exception of Sena
tor McLaurin of South Carolina, were pres
ent, as were all the senators who were
elected as silver republicans or populists.
All the independents except Senator Teller
of Colorado. had entered the democratic
caucus held just before adjournment last
March, but Senator Teller then remained
away. He was present, however, at yes
terday's conference and participated in the
proceedings.
The caucus was called at the instance of
Senator Jones of Arkansas, who stated that
he had thought it possible that
the new senators might want to make some
changes in the officers of the caucus. There
was, however, a general expression of satis
faction with the present officials, and Sena
tor Jones was re-elected unanimously chair
man of the caucus. The old committee on
order of .business, also, was reappointed,
and the one vacancy on that committee
was filled by the selection of Senater Du
bois of Idaho, who was the choice of all
the western members of the caucus.
Urges Effort to Agree.
During the proceedings Senator Tillman
suggested that there should be frequent
conferences and a continued effort to agree
upon the main features of all political con
troversies. There was a quite general re
sponse to this suggestion, and the opinion
was fairly unanimous that the party should
present a united front, permitting no more
straggling than was absolutely necessary.
Senator Jones presented a statement from
the republican committee on committees,
outlining its wishes as to the committee
assignments, frora which it appeared that
the republicans' were anxious to increase
the republican membership of several com
mittees, and to decrease the democratic
membership of a few of the committees.
The most important change suggested by
them was that the republicans should be
allowed to add one member to their side
of the committee on commerce, while the
democrats should agree to surrender one
of the places on that committee held by
them. The committee, as now constituted,
includes ten republican members and seven
democratic members.
Republican Suggestions Opposed.
It was decided vigorously to resist this
innovation. The republicans also ex
pressed a desire to increase the member
ship of the committees on agriculture and
census from nine to eleven each, the two
new members to be republicans; to in
crease the committee on claims from thir
teen to fourteen, the republicans to have
eight members and the democrats six, as
against seven and six, respectively, as the
committee is now constituted. An increase
is also proposed in the committee on for
eign relations. As it at present stands the
committee numbers eleven members, four
of whom are democrats. The proposal is
to make it consist of thirteen members,
eight of whom shall be republicans and five
democrats. A change was alsd suggested
in the committee on irrigation, which is at
present composed of six republicans and
five democrats. The change, if adopted,
would give a membership of eleven, only
four of whom would be democrats.
The democrats decided to oppose the pro
posed changes in the committees on claims
and irrigation.
The republican committee suggested no
changes in the committees on appropria
tiops, finance and judiciary, but indicated
that they will continue Senator Jones of
Nevada on the finance committee, thus
practically adding one to the republican
representation and taking one from the op
position representation. The republicans
did not indicate any intention -to take care
of Senator Wellington in the matter of
committees, nor was any suggestion made
in the caucus that the democrats should
find places for him.
CANNIBALISM NOW CHARGED.
Addition to Crimes pf Which Filipinos
Are Guilty.
Cannibalism has appeared in the varied
list of crimes charged against Filipino na
tives. According to the record of a court
martial convened in the department of the
Viscayas, P. I., which has been received
at the War Department, Ramundo Fonte,
a native, found his working companion,
Liberato Benllro, sleeping in his (Fonte')
boat. Fonte became enraged and killed
the slumbering man with a blow of an oar,
cut off his nose and ears, took out his liver
and intestines and then, according to his
own confession, cooked and ate the same.
He was sentenced to be hanged at Capiz,
Panay, on the 13th instant.
General Chaffee found much fault with
the proceedings of a military commission
headed by Major Henry S. Turrill, surgeon,
U. S. A., which tried Juan Olivar, a Fili
pino. Olivar was the leader of a band of
ladrones who made *an attack upon the
house of Teodoro Iabrador, presidente of
Mina, Panay, captured him, his brother,
wife, grandmother, godmother, small
daughter and a policeman. The grand
wnother, godmother and daughter were shot
to death in the vicinity of the capture; La
brador, his wife and the policemain were
taken to an isolated spot and killed with
bolos, while the brother effected his escape.
Incidentally Olivar and his band robbed
Labrador of 78 carts, 800 pesos and other
articles.
"On the above state of facts," said Gen
eral Chaffee, "accused is charged solely
with the murder of Labrador, assault upon
him with intent to kill and robbery. Of these
charges he is found guluy. Why the bru
tal murder of three women, one smalil girl,
and the polceman was not includeft in the
charges is not understood, and the finding
of the commission that accused ia guilty of
the murder of Labrador, and also guilty
of assault upon him with intent to kill is
legally illogical, as the latter offense is a
minor one included in the former, the
greater comprehending the lesser." Olivar
was sentenced to be hanged.
A band of Tulisanes, armed with bolos,
rifes and daggers, killed eleven members of
the Echavarria family at Naro, Na*bate,
on August 14, 1900. for the sole reason that
the victims were Spaniards. Two members
of the band were just recently brought to
trial, and were sentenced to be hanged.
But in view of the fact that the. more re
sponsible participators in this crime had al
ready pail tag death penalty, the sentences
were commuted by General Chaffee to life
imprisonment. an retldr

CATASTROPHE AT BALANGIGA
SURVIVORS' ACCOUNT OF THE SAMAR
SURPRISE.
Company C, oth ,nfantry, Nearly Ex

Streets-Maj. -(embe's Report.
A thrilling reminc r of thi terrible catas
troph'e at-Balang Samar, in which Com
pany C of the 9th fantry Was nearly ex
terminated4 by sa ~osedlyi friendly Fil
Ipinos, while at. beakfast without arms,
is contained in a zeport just received
by Surgeon General Stertiberg from Maj.
Frederick J. Cdmbe, chief surgeon first dis
trict, department of the Visayas. Maj.
Combe says that about 4 o'clock on the
morning of September 29 he was ordered
to send a surgeon t0 Bassey to assist Capt.
Williams, assistant surgeon U. S. V., in at
tending the wound.ed of Company C, 9th
Infantry, who had come from Balangiga.
Finding that he could not spare the sur
geon, he went to Bassey himself and gave
the surgeon at that station such assistance
as he could. Capt. Bookmiller, command
ing officer at Bassey, organized a relief ex
pedition to go to Balangiga, and Maj.
Combe accompanied it as a volunteer.
Captain Bookmiller's party started on the
steamship Pittsburg on the morning of Sep
tember 29. The party consisted of about
sixty men.
Story of Survivors.
"About ten miles. from Balangiga," says
Major Combe in his narrative, "we over
took a canoe in which were two soldiers
who had managed to escape from the bolo
men who had attacked Balangiga the pre
vious morning. They told a most harrow
ing tale of having been surprised by several
hundred bolomen, which was found upon
our arrival at Balangiga not to have been
exaggerated. Everywhere were signs of
the awful butchery. Our men lay stark in
the streets and public square far advanced
In mortification and fearfully mutilated.
The officers must evidently have been
asleep when attacked. They were found in
their pajamas and without any weapons in
their hands. Maj. Griswold and Lieut.
Bumpus were boloed to death In their
rooms, but Capt. Connell, on hearing the
advancing rush, is said to have jumped
or dropped from the second-story window
of his quarters and started to run across
the parade ground to the barracks. He
was surrounded just In front of his quar
ters and there stabbed to death. Of all the
men who were at mess probably thirty-five
succeeded in fighting their way to their
arms. Then, according to the description
of the survivors, succeeded a hand-to-hand
fight which has certainly not been equaled
in the last three years' experience of our
-army. Of the men who got to their arms
only twenty-six reached Bassey. Two es
caped to Tanauan, Leyte, and two were
picked up by our expedition.
Insurgents Driven From Town.
"Our men succeeded in temporarily driv
ing the insurgents from the town, and in
this interim made such hurried preparations
as they could for departure in canoes,
bringing the wotnded. which numbered
twenty-two, along 'witl them. Two og
these died en route 'to' asaey and.. one
after arrival there. Upon our arrival at
Balangiga we fouand that the natives had
buried their dead. Judging from the length
of the trench, as well as from the state
ments of the men who escaped, the loss of
the natives must have been double our
own. Our dead remained unburied until
our arriyal.
The American Losses.
"The following estimates of our losses .I
believed to be correct': The strength of the
command at Balangiga, September 28, was
'three officers, seventy enlisted men of Com
pany C, 9th Infantry, and one private of
the hospital corps, a tutal of seventy-four.
They are accounted fdr as follows: Killed
and buried at Balangiga, three officers and
twenty-nine enlisted i'nen; killed on beach,
bodies not recovered, three; escaped to
Bassey, twenty-six; escaped to Tanauan,
two; found by second relief expedition, one
hcspital corps private and two charred bod
les unrecognizable; picked up by relief ex
pedition, two; total accounted for, sixty
eight; missing, six. The missing were un
questionably killed in the barracks and the
building subsequently burned. Of the
twenty-six men that reached Bassey four
have died, making our total loss through
death and missing forty-eight. There are
only twenty-six survivors of the original
command. Several of these are wounded,
some very severely."
Buried All the Bodies.
Major Combe says that he personally saw
to the. Identification, and burial of all the
bodies found at Balangiga and took the
precaution of burying a bottle with each
man containing his dame for future Iden
tification. The condition of the bodies after
eighteen hours of exposure, most of the
time to the tropical sun, made the work
of identification and burial difficult and re
volting. The men were buried in the pub
lie square just opposite the church.
In concluding his report Major Combe
says that he has just learned~ from Cob. De
Russy that the bodies of Wright of the
hospital corps and two other men, unrecog
nizable on account of having been 'ourned
and charred In the lbarracks, which were
razed to the ground, have been found and
given proper burial. This made a total of
thirty-three identified bodies and two un
identified bodies. Three bodies were found
in a well near the barracks, where they
had been thrown by the Filipinos. Five
charred and burnt remains were taken out
of the barracks, three while the building
was still on fire.

Mr. Baeon's Objeetiem.
Mr. Bacon. replying to the speech of
Senator Lodge on the previous day, sum
med up his objections in the statement
that he could not freely accept any treaty
which does not place the isthmian canal
entirely under American auspices and
American control. This, he said, the pend
ing treaty does not do, nor does it do any
thing like It. It did not by long odds ac
complish what had been accomplished by
the Seiate -amendment.s to the Hay
Pauncefote treaty that had been under
consideration at the last session of Con
gress. That amendment had, he said,
abrogated*all the objectionable provisions
of that treaty as negotiated, and it did not
matter what prov!sions there were in the
agreement so long as the United States
were authorized, as they were, by the prin
cipal Davis amendment, to secure the
safety and maintenance of the canal by
their own force. That amendment had
given this country a free hand to do what
was necessary for the protection and de
fens@ of the canal, whereas the present
treaty carries all the restrictions which
were originally contained In the old treaty,
leaving out the modifications of the Davis
amendment.
Control in Time of War.
- Referring to the treaty, he pointed out
that it reproduces the restrictions of the
old Suez canal treaty, which had been in
corporated In the original convention. He
charged that these restrictions had been
copied almost verbatim from the old treaty,
the only material change being in the omis
sion of the words ."in time of war as in
time of peace" from rule one of the Suez
canal .agreement. This omission did not,
however, in his opinion, change the char
acter of the agreement, as there was no
limitation as to time or country, prevent
ing the United States from controlling the
canal in case of hostility with any other
power.
"The only reply," he said. "which the ad
vocates of the treaty make to criticisms is
that the canal would be under the full con
trol of the United States in time of war.
but this is no more true now than under the
old treaty, and it Is a strange thing that
all the provisions refer to the control of
the canal in war, notwithstanding it is
contended here that in that contingency the
removal of this phase places the canal un
der our absolute control."
The Only Exelusive Power.
He said the war restrictions of the treaty
were entirely inconsistent with the claims
of Senator Lodge that this country should
say who should use the canal and who
should not in case of hostilities. He con
tended that the only power given to the
United States which was not given to
Great Britain was found In the last sen
tence of regulation two, providing that "the
United States shall be at liberty to main
tain such military police along the canal as
nay be necessary to protect it against law
lessness and disorder," but this, he said,
was not sufficient to make the canal an
American institution, and if the Davis
amendment had been necessary to render
the original treaty acceptable it was equally
necessary in this instance. He considered
the pending treaty every whit as objection
able as the treaty of last session. He
quoted the fourth article of the pending
treaty, as follows:
"It is agreed that no change of territorial
sovereignty or-of International relations of
the country or countries traversed by the
before mentioned canal shall affect the gen
eral principle or neutralization or the obli
gation of the high contracting parties under
the present treaty." The effect of this pro
vision, he said, was inevitably to surrender
control of the canal belt in case the own
ership of the soil embraced in it should pass
to the United States. He pointed out that
this restriction had not been incorporated
in the first treaty, and said it was entirely
out of place in the revised agreement. In
deed, he thought there would be almost as
much objection to guaranteeing neutrality
on land owned by the United States on the
Isthmus of Panama as on land held by a
canal crossing the peninsula of Florida.
In conclusion Mr. Bacon announced that
while he had no intention of voting for the
treaty, he would do nothing to obstruct Its
ratification.
Treaty Suspended in Time of War.
Senator Cullom, following Senator Bacon,
congratulated the Senate and the country
upon the fact that there are two things in
connection with the new treaty updn
which, he said, practically all are agreed.
One of these was the desirability of the
supercession of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
and the other that of the necessity for the
construction of an isthmlan canaL.
He contended that the new treaty rad
ically changes the conditions presented by
the first Hay-Pauncefote treaty, clearly
reie~ving it of the necessity of such an
amendment as that made to the old treaty
upon the suggestion of Senator Dlavis, be
cause the treaty Itself would permit the
United States under international law to
own, manage and defend the canal in any
way that It may choose. In other words,
he added, in a war with Great Britain or
with any other power the treaty would be
suspended, under the law which governs
nations, until the war should be concluded,
when it would be revived and again en
forced. He dwelt upon the fact, which, he
said, was the most important circumstance
to be considered, that the new treaty su
percedes and abrogates the Clayton-Bulwer
convention, of 1850. and for this reason
would be of untold value to the country.
Primeiple of Neutralisatfon.
He admitted that the new treaty retains
the general principle of neutralization, as
did the original Hay-Pauncefote treaty,. but
hd urged that it does not re-enact or keep
alive .any of the provisions of the treaty of
1850. While it retains the doctrine of neu
tralization, the provision mnaking that re
tention applies, the senator contended, to
all nations alike, but to none of them for
any longer time than they observe the reg
ulations prescribed by the United States.
When they should fail in this observance
we could close the annal under the terms of
the treaty. All nations, would be treated
on terms of fairness and equality by allow
ing all to use the canal in time of peace
and shutting out all intlimo of war, in case
it should be found desirable to do so, In
short, Senlator Culloma urged that there is
no provision in the pending eenvention
which wouiji interfere with our right as a
nation to close up the waterway toay
belligerent power.
He contended that the provision in regard
to the policing of the canal applies only to
its control in tiniss of peace ad not in time
of war. !ae, the Utae States Iate
owuer' of the praiserty, gaaer tha e~.
should remain where It now Is. *A the sen
ator predicted it would remain. In this
connection he quoted from President Roose
velt's message. saying that the United
States Is not seeking to extend Its borders,
and adding that the chances were ten to
one that this country would not seek to
secure new territory in that direction. As
a matter of fact, he said, the people do
not want more territory than we now have,
but are content to leave the boundaries as
they at present exist.

MEANS OF AVOIDING PRICTION.
Joint Conference of Baptist Soeieties
Diseussing Diferemees.
A joint conference of the national Baptist
educational board and offticials of the Home
Mission Society of New York was held yes
terday at the Second Baptist Church, colored,
on 3d street between Hand I streets, for
the purpose of adjusting differences that
have existed for some time between the
national Baptist convention and the admin
istration of the Home Mission Society. It is
claimed by. the colored Baptists that the
merit of a large majority of their people is
not recognized by the former society, and
on account of this, it is alleged, a great deal
of friction has arisen in the missionary
work among the colored people of the coun
try. The meeting held today was called for
the special purpose of providing means
whereby this friction can be averted. It
was said by one of the colored members of
the conference that last year over $300,000
had been contributed by the colored people
of the United States for the good of the race
in this country. One-half of this sum was
made use of by the national convention
(colored) and the other half by the Baptist
Home Mission Society.
The national convention now has seventy
two universities, colleges and schools dis
tributed throughout the country and sup
ported entirely by the colored people. The
Home Mission Society, it Is said, is anxious
to have the national convention co-operate
with it in the uplifting of the colored people,
but the members of the national Baptist
educational board are desirous that merit
shall be recognized and that all the colored
people are not to be classed as being on the
same plane.
Members of the educational board are
present from all parts of the country. Dr.
Meorehouse, Dr. Chivers and Dr. Butterick
represent the educational board of the Home
Mission Society. The result of the meeting
will be awaited with great interest through
out the country.
In addition to the educational work the
officials of the Home Mission Society desire
to regulate the differences in the home mis
sion work carried on by the home mission
board of the national convention, of which
Rev. Dr. R. H. Boyd, who is present at this'
meeting, is secretary, and the B. Y. P. U,
work, of which Dr. Isaac, also present, is
the secretary.
The home mission board of the national
convention handled nearly $75,000 last year,
It is said, for its work and the B. Y. P. U.
between $7,000 and $8,000. Thus it is de
sirable, stated one of the member,, that
these large finances be passed through one
channel under the supervision of the white
and colored alike.
The meeting closed last night with a mass
meeting, at which time addresses were
made by many prominent educators.

TO RECLAIM DESERT
Plans for Irrigation of Western
Main Features of the Hansbrough
Bl Favored.
PROPOSITIONS ADVANCED
Thirteen of the seventeen senators. rep
resentatives and delegates appointed by
the conveition of western congressmen in
Cheyenne last summer to draft a bill for
the reclamation of the arid domain by the
national government have been struggling
with the problem for several days.
All the pending bills having been gone
over carefully. it has been unanimously de
cided to take the Hanabrough bill as a basis
for discussion. This means, it is said.
that bill will be the one on which all in
terests will unite. There will be some minor
changes in phraseology to facilitate admin
istration, but the main features will be pre
served. The bill may be ready to be re
ported by the reassembling after the holi
days. It will go to the irrigation commit
tees in both houses and take the place of all
pending measures of sigillar character.
Where There is Genesal Aecerd.
General support is given to the proposi
tion to set aside the proceeds of sales of
public lands in the arid states for the pur
pose of irrigation, such proceeds to be
used to create an arid land reclamation
fund, which shall be made more or less
perpetual by returning to it the money re
ceived from the sale of irrigated lands
after the irrigation works shall have been
constructed.
The committee is also practically unani
mously in favor of authorizing the Secre
tary of the Interior to immediately begin
the construction of certain specified irriga
tion enterprises, especially those recom
mended by the Secretary of the Interior
in his annual report. If only one enter
prise is to be carried out great difference
of opinion will result as to which one k
shall be. owing to the conflict between lo
cal interests.
State vs. Fedesal Centree
There are two factions in the committee
one favoring state control of these national
expenditures and the other in favor of as
tIonal control of the same. The state con
trol people have contcnded that none
of the works provided for shall be under
taken unless the state or states in which
they are to be carried out shall have
adopted an approved system of water laws
and created a state board of engineers and
control, which shall have the direction of
the work.
Representative Newlands of Nevada leads
the fight for purely nationalised enter
pris s. He is opposed by Representative
Mondill of Wyoming. Senators Dubais and
Warren support Mondell in his contention.
Representative Reader of Kansas Is an ear
nest supporter of national enterprises.
Senator Kearns of Utah is Indifferent to
the method pursued, but hopes for the suc
cess of any enterprise which may be under
taken above any other consideration.
Representative Jones of Washington is in
favor of asking Congress to build a single
reservoir whercver It may be deemed best
and trusting to the educational power of
the work to secure further appropriations.
Senator Bard of California is in favor of
leaving the matter entirely in the hands of
the executive department of the govern
ment.
Senator Gibson of Montana is an earnest
opponent of state control, as is Representa
tive Shafroth of Colorado. Senator Diet
rich of Nebraska is in favor of a compro
mise of any kind which will result in some
action by Congress.
& in Paver of State Centrol.
Senator Warren, who is chairman of this
irrigation committee, is known to be in
favor of state control, but seems inclined to
accept any proposition which will result In
c national irrigation enterprise. He sug
gests that in all states having a state
organization or board of water control
the - national work should be done
under the direction of such state officials.
and where a state has no such state or
ganization, the work should be done by
the national government.
Delegate Rodey of New Mexico is an
xious to commit the irrigation forces to
oppose the proposed international dam in
the Rio Grande at El Paso. Delegate Mark
Smith of Arizona is an earnest advocate of
the proposed San Carlos dam and believes
that no general irrigation bills will be
passed by Congress. He is in favor of
asking for direct appropriations for specific
works, leaving to the future the passage
of a general irrigation bill by Congress.
Iertaattom BIlls Eatroduced.
A large number of Irrigation bills have
already been introduced by senators and
representatives. They were taken up by
the committee, and discussed at length
in hopes of evolving a measure which can
be presented to Congress by western mem
bers, as the unanimous choice of the entire
representation.
The doubt expressed as to the probable
enactment of any general Irrigation bill
arie4 from the opposition to extravagant
appropriations or the enactment of any
laws which promnise .to lead in the future
to heavy additions to the national expense
bill
Members of Congress from east of the
Missouri river are taking no part in the
Irrigation controversy. S-,me of them will
oppose any appropriation In this direction.
Many of them are quite willing to vote for
it. however, as soon as it Is preshnted to
them in tangible frrm.
With the PresIdent'. approval and the
strong indorsemnent of the Secretaries ofi
the Interior and Agdiculture. it would new
appear as though a majority could be se
cured in both House and Senate for the
principle, involved in natIonal aid to tirga
tion. providing the initial appropriattan is
not too large.
