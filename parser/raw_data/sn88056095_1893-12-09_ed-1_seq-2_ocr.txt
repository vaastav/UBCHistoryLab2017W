BATFRDAY,

TO EEDDCE EX?ENSES.
We consider the action of the I'oanl of
trustees in reducing city expen.es a move
in the right direction. Hacked by a
targe majority of ttie tax-payers, the
trustees must feel that they are at least
conforming with the wishea of the peo
ple. While there is no doubt that the
shutting off of electric lights and re
trenchment in other directions will
cause some inconvenience, and we all
know they are very nice things to have,
a reduction of taxes and the future pros
perity of the town demanded that some
thing be done, and the sooner the rem
edy was applied, the letter it would be
for all. It became evident that the town
could not go indefinitely, issuing war
rants and piling up an interest-bearing
debt without final ruin. With a tax
rate of 4k. per cent., the resident prop
erty owners could not long bear
fiie burden, while no eastern man
with capital to invest, could be induced
to put it inte a place where the S3xes
were e»juai to the amount of interest he
would receive if loaned out in his eastern
home. Coder such conditions peop'e
would not locate in the place, conse
quently if we are to prosper, the time
has arrived when we must curtail ex
penses and reduce taxes to a reasonable
amount. This will apply to the county
as well as the town, and the board of
county commissioners should make a
study of the ijuestion with a view of se
curing a lower rate of taxation next
year. The members of the board of trus
tees are to be commended for their action
and if the policy inaugurated at Wednes
day evening's session is continued, we
still see a ray of light for the future.
AVith natural advantages and undevel
oped resources, almost equal to any sec
tion oi the country, and a reasonable
rate of taxation, there is no reason why
CYeur d'Alene should not become one of
{he leading towns of the state.
The populists in congress will support
the Wilson free trade bill. The demo
grata have sbajrbed the pops, and the
latter will now do the bid ling of the
former.
CoiOKESenax Blaxd, on Tuesday, in
troduced a new free coinage bill. It re
peals that portion of the bill of 1873,
preventing the coinage of silver dollars,
and reenacts the coinage act of 1537.
The masses would be pleased with the
passage of such a bill, but it is doubtful
if a majority can be secured in the
present congress.
The governor of Colorado has his mind
made up to call an extra session of the
legislature for the purpose of enacting a
silver coinage law. The constitution of
the United stated vests the sole power
to make coins in the government, and
while the state might i.sue blocks of sil
ver that would pa-s for the market price
< f the metal and constitute it a circulat
ing medium, it would have no right to
coin silver and stamp it as so much
money.
The president's message is a very
lengthy document. It deals in gener
alities without defining his policy, with
one exception, that oi the tariff. II -
urges congress to pass the Wilson bill
and redeem the party pledges for ''tariff
reform," and is anxious to have free
trade inaugurated without delay. He
expresses doubts as to the effect the re
peal of the silver purchase law is going
to have on the country, and advises con
gress to go slow in the matter of finan
rial legislation, yet it has been but a few
weeks since he was urging congress to
repeal the law as the only means of re
new ing prosperity and relieving the
financial depression. The ghost has dis
appeared, hut bU skeleton still remains.
The Hawaiian question is passed over
without a statement of the policy to
be pursued toward the islands.
The Beige Statesman, in commenting ;
on matters political, says that "when it!
cornea to fixing the measure of men's
deserts by hypercritical standard-, the
populist* of the state make a v ry j*x>r
chewing. !. »«t v* ar, when it w as a i >rt -

whs to nssii-t Mr. Cleveland. It was
known tHat. * f t!ie two, Cleveland was
far more unfriendly to silver than Har
ris-on, the f'-rmer being an aggrt*«sive l
inonoinetallist, the latter a hesitating hi i
metallist. Moreover, Cleveland was 1
k own to lie directly antagonistic to the
interest! i,f this state on every oilier sib- 1
ject alfeeted by legislation, while H arri
k-mi was known tu 1* as distinctly friend
ly to every other such interest. Yet, in '
the face of this knowledge, the [>"puli«ts
went against Harrison, and assisted in
electing a | resident win, ha« forced re

tion, wln>has set aside the Chinese law,

country in Hawaii. The faets are. it w as :

Tnr. total floating debt of the town is
$10,500. The interest on this amount is
fl,C50. If beuds are issued to ruu for a
tern of years at a rate of interest not ex
ceeding 7 per cent., there is a saving of
$315 in interest atone, and the town will
be placed on a cash besis which will re
sult in u great saviug in running ex
penses, for there is no doubt that ex*
penses could he materially reduced if all
who did work or furnished the town with
supplies knew that when their bills w ere
ordered paid they would receice the cash. |
We venture to say that a total saving of -
at least one-half'can be effected by the 1
issuance of l»onds. Once uj*on a cash |
basis, the state law does not permit a
towa to go in debt beyond the amount of ]
revenue it can rais; for the year, based j
upon the receipts and expenditures of \
the year previous. Any person can fig
are the benefits to be derived from such j
a system, and when a stranger, looking
for a location, learns that the town has i
but a small bonded debt, is doing busi
on a cash basis, with warrants at par,
and has a low rate of taxation, it will be
a great inducement for him to locate.
The erder issued by the district court,
restrai ing the assessor irom the collec
tion of city taxes, a copy oi which is
printed in another column, while it will!
undoubtedly prove a temporary benefit
in reducing the amount of taxes to be
paid this year nearly one-fourth, must
result tu keeping up the levy next year.
Looked at irom one point, it is an ad
vantage; but coming as it did, at a time
w hen eff-.-rts were being made to curtail
expenses and get towu affairs in such a
shape that trie indebtedness would not
be increased, and that funding binds
could be issued to take up the floating
debt, it was unfortunate. There are cer
tain expanses that cannot be avoided,
and the cutting off of the revenue at
this time will not prove advantageous in
the end, therefore it is a mistake; but
should not discourage the board of trus
tees from proceeding with the bond is
The United Stated senate adopted a
resolution calling upon President Cleve
land for all papers ami correspondence
in the Hawaiian affair. Several leading
democrats made speeches denouncing
Cleveland's actions as unconstitutional,
unprecedented, and beyond his jurisdic
tion. He was given to understand plain
ly that the people's representatives in
congress would not permit him to accom
plish the restoration of a queen to her
throne by force and violence. Cleveland
is not so big as lie lo- ks.
w ill place the circulating medium under
the control of ,N ational banks. They can
expand or contract the volume of money
at will, and thereby hold the prosperity
of the whole country in their grasp. A
money issued by the government is w hat
we want, and it should be based on sil
ver and gold.

Gresham Squirming Oat.
The Daily News Washington:
Gresham has attempted to absolve liim
self from all res[s,nsibility for the ad
ministration's Hawaiian policy. In con
versation with a personal friend, he
stated that he had nothing to do with
framing the policy which was inaugu
rat'd by "I'aramont" Illount, and which
is sought to be enforced by Minister
Willis. The secretary stated that before
he was invited to his seat in the cabinet
Cleveland had formulated his Hawaiian
policy; that he had declared the de
tlironement of the queen was unjust,
and liis determination to rethrone her;
that the president, without consulting
tin* secretary of state, determined upon
the appointment of a special conuiiis
■sioner, and selected Blount, without the
, ... ,
knowledge of the secretary of state, and,
in fact, the latter officer scarcely knew
Blount nt Bight at tin* time. The hu
. , m , , » • .
retary of state sain further, that tr« t» oc
T i
tious to Blount, and also those to Willis,
were prepared at the White House. An
intimation is made by him that he
scarcely knew at the tiiuo of Blount's
departure for Honolulu w hat his instruc
tions were, for they were not only pre
pared, but delivered, by the band of
President Cleveland.
