ROOSEVELT A
DEMAGOGUE
SUCH IS CHARACTERIZATION OF
NEW YORK WORLD IN REPLY
TO MESSAGE.
LAMENTABLE HABIT OF INACCU
RACY MAKES PRESIDENT'S
JUDGMENT UNWORTHY
ACCEPTS STATEMENT OF TAFT
THAT HE MADE NO PROFITS
OUT OF PANAMA.
New Vojk, Dec. 16. — The World in
the course of its answer to the pres
ident s reference to that paper in a
.-p<cial message to congress yester
day says:
“Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken. He
cannot muzzle the World.
“While no amount of billingsgate
on his part can alter our determina
tion to treat him with judicial impar
tial. ty and scrupulous fairness, we
repeat what we have already said,
that the congrt ss of the United States
should make a thorough investigation
of the whole Panama transaction,
that the full truth may be known to
th“ American people.
“The World appreciates the im
portance and significance of Mr.
Roosevelt’s statomint when he de
clared to congress that the proprietor
ot tin- World ‘should be prosecuted
for libel by the governmental author
ities,’ and that ‘the attorney general
tins und< r consideration the form
under which proceedings against Mr.
Pulitzer shall h<- brought.’
“This is tin- first time the presi
dent ever asserted the doctrine of
lese majesty, or proposed, in the ab
• nee of specific legislation, a crimi
nal prosecution by the government of
citizens who criticised the conduct of
government or the conduct of individ
uals who may have had business
dealings with the government.
Neither the king of Great Britain nor
the German emperor would venture
to arrogate such power to himself.
John Adams' attempt to enforce the
sedition law destroyed the federalist
party in Ain erica. Yet Mr. Roose
velt. in the absence of law, officially
propost s to use all the power of the
greatest government on earth to cxiir
pie the freedom of the press on the
pretext that the government itself
has been lib* lied—and he is the gov
ernment.
‘lt is true the World printed pub
lic reports concerning the Panama
canal affair which resulted from Wil
liam Nlesoji Cromwell's appeal to the
district attorney’s office during the
rect nt campaign to prevent the pub
lication of the story which was said
to be in tin* hands of the democratic
national committee. It was Crom
well’s own action which raised the
issue in the campaign.
"It is true also that when Mr Roose
velt made his attack upon Dtlavan
Smith the World called attention to
‘certain statements which Mr. Roose
velt must have known to be false or
misleading, and appealed to congress
to end all scandal by a full and im
partial investigation. If this be ma
son, let Mr. Roosevelt make the most
of it.
' Roosevelt's lamentable habit of
inaccurate statement makes it impos
sible to accept his judgments or his
conclusions. In his message he does
not state correctly., even so simple a
unit ter as the pretended causes of his
grievance.
"The World lias never said Charlt s
P. Taft or Douglas Robinson made
any profits whatever. Mr. Taft de
nied (hat he was concerned in the
transaction in any way, which denial
the World published and accepted. It
Mould have bct\u tqually glad to print
Mr. Robinson's denial could it have
succeeded in obtaining one from him.
as it frequently attempted. The
World has no evidence that he was
associated with Cromwell, and would
accept his word to that effect; for Mr.
Robinson is an estimable gentleman
of high character, whose reputation
for veracity is infinitely better than
That of his distinguished brother-in
law.
■ If the World has libelled anybody
we hope it will he punished, hut we
do not intend to be intimidated by
Mr. Roosevelt s threats or by his de
nunciation. or by his power.
' No other living man ever so gross
ly libelled the United States as dots
this president, who besmirches con-j
gress. bulldozes judges, assails the in-j
tegrity of courts, slanders private
citizens, and who has shown himself
the most reckless, unscrupulous dem
agogue whom the American people
ever trusted with great power and|
authority.
••We say this not in anger but in 1
sincere, sorrow. The World has im
measurably more respect for the of-!
fice of president of the United States
than Theodore Roosevelt has ever!
shown during the years in which hej
has maintained a reign of terror and!
vilified the honor and honesty of;
both public officials and private citi
zens who opposed his policies or
thwarted him in his purpose.
"As far as the World is concerned
its proprietor may go to jail, if Roose
velt succeeds, as he threatens; but
even in jail the World will not cease
'o be a fearless champion of free,
speech, a free press and a free peo
ple.”

CITIES HELD FOR
RIOT DAMAGES
ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT IN IM
PORTANT DECISION —SPRING-
FIELD INTERESTED.
Springfield, 1111., Dec. 16. —That cit
ies are liable for damages in case ot
destruction of property by mobs, was
the vital point involved in the decision
by the Illinois supreme court yester
day. affirming the judgment of SI,OOO
in favor of Frank Sturges against the
city of Chicago.
Sturges’ plate glass window was
broken by a mob July 15, 1903. in
the case, which was appealed from the
criminal court of Cook county, the
constitutionality of the legislative act,
which “indemnifies owners of property
for damages occasioned by mobs and
riots,” was attacked.
As damage suits against the city o'
Springfield for approximately SIOO,OOO
for destruction of property have
grown out of the recent riots in this
city, yesterday’s decision will be cited
as proving the city’s liability.

$154,550 for School Districts
The amount reserved from the
school fund income to reimburse those
district schools which have complied
with the requirements of the law,
making them districts of the first
class is $1 "*4.550, or SSO for each of
the :3.09l districts that have fully met
the demands of the law.
ft has been the policy of the state
!£>r more than 30 years to encourage
better educational conditions by grant
ing aid to certain classes of schools.
Th’* policy has been extended from
time to time until every class or
school in the state was getting special
state aid in a greater or less amount
except the district schools. The*last
legislature, therefore, provided that
those districts' schools, such of them
as conformed to certain prescribed
conditions, such as improved ventila
tion. better equipment in the school
room and general cleanliness, both in
the school room and outbuildings,
should receive SSO per \ear from a
term of three years. It is under the
operation of this law that the $154,550
is reserved for these districts. It is
necessary for these schools to have a
good teacher, as well as the necessary
equipment. There are in the state at
this time 3,0$ 3 such schools out of a
total of some 6 500 districts. Tiie SSO
special state aid law has produced a
pronounced effect in the country dis
tricts tor the betterment of school
conditions.
The special state aid to schools,
however, is but a small proportion ot
the moneys reserved for school pur
poses. For instance, in 1907 the
amount raised by tax in towns, cities
and villages for ordinary local school
purposes by the regular district tax
was $4,276,281.70.
All Township high schools receive
from the state as special aid an
amount equal to half the cost of in
struction. There were twenty-eight
township high schools and the amounts
to which they were entitled varied
from $630 ’o $2,032.50. All d : sfric
high schools whose cost of instruction
equaled one thousand dollars or
more, received $371.39. Schools in
which the cost of instruction was less
than $1 000 received a. proportionately
smaller amount. Nineteen schools re
ceived state aid for manual training.
In schools having banual training in
the high school only the aid is $250.
In schools having manual training in
both grades and high schools the aid
is £350.
State graded schools of two depart
ments (two teachers) receive special
state aid to the amount of S2OO a year;
schools of three or more departments
receive S3OO special state aid.

STATE RAILWAY
ISSUE IN ENGLAND
BRITISH UNIONISTS URGED TO
MAKE IT FIGURE IN FU
TURE FIGHTS
LORD BRASSY IN CONFERENCE
WITH MAYOR PRAISES
SCHEME.
London, Dec. 1G. —State ownership
of English railways is urged on the
unionist parly as one of the most
plausible planks in the platform with
which it is thought it may soon be
called to go before the country.
Those persons of powerful influence
who promote this theory, so strange
at pre-sent in this country, do not ex
pect that it will take the public fancy
at once or be realized for some time
if ever. But, as Lord Brassey said at
a conference of the south coast may
ors at Dover, the scheme is at least
possible and has many obvious ad
vantages to all the commercial in
terests of the kingdom.
Lord Brassey Sounds Warning.
The spirit of combination has been
growing fast among the railway com
panies, which have had a taste of it
lately. In running their northward
lines, as well as those connecting
with the continental boat service,
they found they could economize on
money, men and time. Thus from
their position the project looked rosy.
But was this, asked Lord Brassey.
good for the general public? The lat
ter might find itself in the position of
the American farmer and merchant,
practically forced to pay what the
railroads asked, because no success
ful competition had any chance
against the all-powerful transporta
tion system. Thus from the action
of these combined companies must
inevitably come public control.
Issue Would Not Be Dodged.
The issue, continued Lord Brassey,
would not be dodged in England, as
it had been in the United States. For
whatever reasons, if state control
should be substituted for private con
trol the railways would be managed
