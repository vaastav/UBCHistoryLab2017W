|RY FORCES WIN f
FIGHT IN HOUSE
Washington, Dec. 8.?Friends of
ohibition, in complete control in
e house, made a clean sweep today
knocking out amendments to the
ohibition section of the treasury
pplly bill which, they claimed, were
signed to weaken enforcement of
e Volstead law.
Standing alone at times, Reprentative
Hill (Republican) of Maryad
sought to limit the money spendj
activities of the prohibition unit,
t his proposals were thrown out
dily after 30 minutes of bitter dete
in which the manner of the law's
forcement was commended and conmned.
Numerous references' were
side to the annual address to coness
delivered earlier in the day by
esdient Harding, and there was
jjorous applause when members relied
that the president had said the
th amendment was here to stay.
The bill stood like a stone wall
;ainst attacks by Mr. Hill's group,
bich often included only himself,
had not reached the point of pass;e
tonight because of an agreement
defer until tomorrow action on a
ovision for substituting fast power
esses for hand* presses on which
e government's money long has
en printed at the bureau of engrar?
The biggest vote against the probation
group was seven, that numr
of members supporting an amendent
by Representative Tinkham
tepublican) of Massachusetts, proding
that men employed in enrcement
work should be appointed
om the civil service, against 66 in
position.
Representative Tincher (Republin)
of Kansas declared the Hill
nendments were in keeping with
e attitude of those who lpad atmpted
to defeat prohibition enrcement.
He said "he did not know
by Mr. Hill should object if the
a Klux Klan tried to suppress mooniining.
Characterizing Mr. Hill as tba minrcement
unit. Mr. Crampton- -# rted
that the fight had been brought
the house on jthe heels of "the
ilendid appeal or the president, and
r. Hill interjected that while in the
nate Mr. Harding had stated the
merican people had the right to rejal
any law. "Any association has
te right to attempt to repeal a law,"
[r. Crampton shot back, "but so long
s that law remains in effect it is
le duty of every American to strive
_ JLl ft I
3 make it enecuve.
The only purpose sought by the
ssocaition, Mr. Crampton went on,
ras not to repeal tljp Volstead law,
iut to destroy it by indirection. Takng
issue with statements that the
irohibition forces had suffered house
osses in the November election, Mr.
2rampton said thot out of the 80 Republican
seats lost, the net dry lose
was only nine.
Representative Thorpe (Republican)
of Nebraska, elected for the
short term ending in March, said h<
was proud to vote with the friends 01
prohibition.
Representative Knutson of Minne
sota, Republican whip, told the hous
he voted for the 18th amendment an1
the Volstead law, but founl now tha
"as the appropriations for enforce
ment go up whiskey prices com
down." He asserted that thousand
| of illicit stills flourished in the cour
I try and "that boys and girls in thei
teens are coming home drunk."
On the other hand, Representatn
Raker (Democrat) of California d
nied that liquor waB easily obtainab
and asserted that nothing in 25 yea
had done as much for the manho<
and womanhood of the country
prohibition.
