President Taft's message con
tained 35,000 words, but no one
hat yet been found who has ree4
the document from beginning to
end. As Champ Clark stated
when the message was read in
the national house of represent
ties, perhaps some day the peo
pie of this country will be able to
select a man for the presidency
who will hive gumption enough
to write a message of such brev
Uy and terseness that the busy
American cititen can read it.
The census bureau estimates,
basing the estimate on the show

the reports on the oensus returns,
that the United Slates has a pop

this estimate is made on all the
states, territories, colonial pos
9ssinns, excepting the Phillipin
es. Only four states , remain to
be computed and announced. We
have become quite a healthful
family and our Uncle Sam has
his hands full to provide for all.

IT MADE A
DIFFERENCE
The young woman la the pretty
gown and displaying the becoming
style of coiffure surveyed with some
perplexity the young man who sup
posedly called on her because he
wanted to gas into her eyes and lis
ten to her well-modulated voles. He
waa doing neither, however.
Ever tlnee his arrival he had beca
burrowing in a heap of hack cumbers
of a maiatine popularly deemed at
tractive only to feminine Intellects.
"For goodness' sake. Albert," tbe
broke forth at last, "what on earth
eauaea you to be so fascinated by
those magasinesT What's the trou

explained the young man, earnestly.
"They print such splendid views of
houses sometimes. I waa hunting
them up." .
' "Houses!" cried the young woman.
"I didn't know yoa ware Interested la
architecture!"
"Oh," said the young man, Tm not
Just as architecture. But I waa try
lag to see tt any one had any really
clever ideas, you know, aa to plant,
lometlmes another fellow will come
eut with exactly the thing you have
la mind and aaa't Just figure out your-
"But why are you to interested fa
houses" demanded the young wom
an, a little bored. -
"Well, you tee," tald the young man,
"I've had a tot for a good long time
out In a suburb and I rather thought
maybe rd put op a house oa It. Tou
can always er rent a house, you
know. It seems to "me like a good
way to Invest money. ' Doeant It to

"Why, I suppose- so," said the young
woman, disinterestedly. "I dont know
much about those things wfaea yoa
eeme right dowa to it Investments, I
mean."
"Well, you'd Jmow about a bouse,
wouldn't your asked the young man,
auxlonaly. ''Whether at waa rlght

never think about Ton aee. If I put
one up I dont want It to be a failure.

The young- woman wrinkled her
brow delicately and strove to sppear
polite. It waa difficult because she
was a little resentful that he had sot
noticed the gown tha had put ea es
pecially for bit beneOt. ..

"Now tell me all about him," laid
the young married womaa to the en

"Ob, he's perfectly lovely'' began
the engaged gtrl. .
"Of course," interrupted the young
married woman. "He la to much like

, "Oh, he Isn't a bit like Jack-'.
"Indeed!" The married womaa
etlffened peroeptlbly.
"I didn't mean it that way," pro
tested the engaged girl. . "They are.
both the very nicest men In the world
only different - We are to be mar
