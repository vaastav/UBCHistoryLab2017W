U. S. ARMY'S NEEDS
STRIKING REPORT IS ISSUED BY
SECRETARY GARRISON
MUST BE PREPARED.
AN ANSWER TO OPPONENTS
Unsparing In Its Criticism of Ultra
Pacifists Arfluments of Those Who
Would Have No Military Increase

Washington, D. C Secretary Gar
rison declaroB In his annual report
to the president that It tho adminis
tration plan for a continental army
falls, tho United States will face some
form of compulsory military service.
In what many men In official lifo
characterize as tho most remarkable
report over made by a secretary of
war, Mr. Garrison passes quickly over
the wide-spread routine activities of
tho war department and devotes prac
tically all his words to tho subject of
military preparedness, the need for
which ho sums up by saying:
"So long as right and wrong exist
In tho world there will bo an inevita
ble conflict botween them. Tho right
doers must bo prepared to protect and
defend tho right as against tho wrong."
Unsparing in his arguments in an
swer to thoso who would havo no In
croaso in tho country's military pre
paredness, Secretary Garrison declares
that tho American people must vlow
their responsibilities nnd measure up
to them and then goes on to tako up
tho various arguments of the opposi
tion Boparatoly.
Many Ignore the Facts.
"There nro some who do not feel
free to base thoir conduct upon a con
sideration of facts or conclusions of
reason because of their interpretation
of dlvino Injunction," ho says. "They
do not bcllovo in resistance to physical
force; and thoso whoso consciences
aro so convinced surrender llfo and
nil that they chorlsh and love at tho
behest of tho nggressor. Tills attitudo
concerns tho individual, and him alone.
It cannot bo mado tho general rule
of conduct under our form of govern
ment without departing from tho basis
upon which our government Is found
ed. One Is Impelled to query upon
what propor consideration thcro Is
based any distinction between tho
right or necessity or desirability of
using mental forco to ropol error,
moral forco to ropol ovil, and physical
lorco to ropol wrong. It would seem,
if reason wore applied, that in each
instance tho situation is identical; and
that If wo should properly prepare our
minds to bo strong so that wo can
reject error nnd our moral characters
to bo Btrong so that wo can reject
evil, wo should likewise make our
iphyslcal forco strong in order that wo
may maintain tho right as against
thoso who would physically Impose tho
wrong upon us.
Wars Are Bound 'to 'Come.
'Thoro aro others concerning whoso
clarity of vision wo nro not advised,
and concerning whoso soundness of
reason wo aro not Informed, becauso
tho attitudo which thoy take is ad
mittedly not based upon cither vision
or reason. Thoy aro thoso who pro
diet 'that war will novor come to this
country, and assort that thcroforo pre

como upon nations from tho earliest
date of recorded history to this mo
ment, thoro is no basis of fact for
Buch .a 'position, but an actual demon
stration of tho non-ezistanco ut -such
basis. Wo were early warned that
there would bo wars nnd rumors of
wars, and that nation would rise
ngalnst nation nnd kingdom against
kingdom and tho end was not yet; and
that prediction has been fully vorlllod
There is mo basis and no foundation
to conclude that thin great ovil 1ms

bo treated at) aro nil other exlatlng
evils and must bo prepared against

diction or upon preparation, wisdom

"Thoro will bo thoso who assert that
tho proposed policy opposes tho tradi
tions of tho people nnd runs counter
theroto. This is more assertion; It is
not the fact, and in truth the fact 1b
to tho contrary. Tho proposed policy
is exactly In keeping with our tradi
tions. "Thcro also will bo thoso who will
oxpross regret that tho policy hero-
toforo pursued, of lack ot proper mill
tary precautions, is to bo departed
from becauso It has been invaluable
as an example to tho rest ot tho world
and wo should not remedy tho lack
becauso wo would then cease to be
such an example. It should be ob
served first, in considering this point
of view, that it entirely overlooks tho
vital and imperative duty to ourselves
which requires that wo should pro
tect and defend that which wo cherish
and hold dear. Furthermore, it over
looks the fact that although we havo
been Just tho example that they desire
throughout tho more than a century
and a quarter of our existence, the re
sults existing In tho world today do
not warrant tho belief that our ex
amplo has had any beneficial effect.
U. S. Should Be Prepared.
"Thoro aro some who decry taking
any precautions or making any prepa
rations of tho military power of tho
nation becauso they say it will not
prevent war, but will provoke It. Men
and nations must prepnre to meet
their responsibilities; If It 1b inudvL
Bublo to develop strength sufficient to

strength may bo misused, human na
ture has Indeed reached an Impasse.
Why should it bo presumed that n Just
man or a Just nation will cease to bo

unjust? Wo must cithor truBt others

"Another stumbling block to somo is
tho suggestion that no preparation
should bo made and no precaution
should ho tuken becauso no ono can
fortoll how much wo may havo to meet
nnd what wo will requiro to meet it
Hero again tho Idea embodied In this
suggestion would stay all human prog
ress. There will bo somo who assert
that tho devastating offects and the
horror produced by tho war now be
ing waged mako it certain that war
will bo avoided for a long period of
tlmo aftor the closo of tho present
war. Thoy will argue that tho exhaus
tion of resources anditho recollection
ot tho awful suffering will havo tho
effect of deterring nations from en
torlng upon war. What basis is there
for such beliot? Certainly such basis
cannot bo found In history our own
or that of othor nations.

"(Thoro will bo thoso who believe
and assert that the tlmo when wur can

a ipropor military policy, but will be
set back if wo do so. It Is difficult to
comprehend on what basis such a bo
liefcan reasonably roat, and thcroforo
It 1b difficult to reason about It. It
seems to rest upon tho idea that if

last summer with tho great new ex

"I want you to meet Oeorgo Lewis,"
said my friend. "Ho Is one of thoso

right, can't bo turned or Influenced."
"I should bo delighted to meet him,"
I replied, "because 1 know him by
reputation nnd ho stands high in hl3
community as a man of tho strictest
integrity; bus John, I don't think you
havo given him a very good character."
"What do you mean?"
"You Bald that when he knows ho
Is right nothing can change him or
influenco him."
"I meant what I said." retorted my
friend.
"No, you didn't," I replied, "for, if
you did, you could not havo any re
spect for George Lewis."
"Explain yourself."
"Tho best of us, John, never claim
to know by ourselves, nnd of our
selves, what Is absolutely right or
wrong. Tho noblest man is weak and
realizes it His ability to differenti
ate between the good and tho bad Is
not vested wholly In himself. He ob
tains this proficiency It I may call
it such because of his contact with
men of honor and with thoso of tho
opposlto type. He absorbs public
opinion and becomes composite."
"You don't mean to say," interrupt
ed John, "that public opinion is al
ways right?"
"No," I replied. "The majority Is
frequently wrong, and tho minority is
often right, and vice versa."
"Then, how are wo to decide upon
what is right and what is wrong?"
"If our intention Is to do right, and
we aro constantly fighting temptation,
our actions will u ually be what they
should be: but when wo allow our own
Individual judgment to prevail exclu
sively, we may bo wrong, even though
we intend to bo right. Alone wo are
not able to take care of ourselves; far
less able than is the animal, who is
guided by Instinct, not by conscience.
If a man reasons by himself alone, ho
is as likely to be wrong as right. It
ho combines what he knows with what
others know, and allows composite
opinion to assist in guiding him, ho is
not likely to make serious mistakes."
"Tho opinion of others may bo
wrong." interrupted John.
"Granted," I replied, "but tho man
with a sensitive conscience and a no
ble character can differentiate with
a largo degree of accuracy. Ho will
not depend upon the opinion of tho
mob, even though it may be in tho
majority. Ho will consult with Intel
ligent and honest men, and he and
they together, not separately, will de-
; cldo any question which may como up.
I If his experience is greater than that
of those with whom ho consults, ho
will allow his own Judgment larger
play. If, on the other hand, ho Is con
vinced that others know better than
he does, he will set aside his own
opinion, to a certain extent, at least,
l or example, a professional man is at
varianco with the policy of an admin
istration, a matter which concerns busi
ness. Probably his opinion is worth
practically nothing, and if tho policy
of tho administration is accepted by
business men of character and in
tegrity, tho man Is a fool If he allows
himself to question it.

llshmcnts. Ho read dry goods trade
papers and every book uuoa tho sub
ject which ho could obtain. Ho
grounded himself In dry goods, know
tho history ot tho business, and, to a
largo extent, the action and policy
of It, not only In regard to his own
house, but with raferenco to dry goods
houses In general. Ho becamo famil
iar with credits; ho followed tho mar
ket. In flvo years ho was tho head
of a largo department, and In ten
years a member of the firm, although,
ot course, his interest was small.
I am awaro that this rapid promo
tion Is not usual, for many n good
man, ambitious and taking tho initia
tive, does nc. becomo a partnor In ten
years, or twenty years, or thirty years;
but it may bo stated as a fact that no
one who doos not do as John did over
gets beyond a subordinate position or
Is allowed to assume moro than or
dinary -esponsibllty.
Tom was as faithful, as honest, as
hard a worker as John. Tom worked,
nnd was satisfied with doing his duty.
John worked, and did moro than his
duty. Tom attended to thoso things
which lie wat told to do. John did
all that Tom did, and moro. Tom
loved to work, and worked. John
loved to work, and worked, but ho
also threw his mind into his work.
He mado It . part of himself, and,
therefore, it was not drudgery.
Tho foregoing is but another illus
tration of the contention which I
havo always held, namely, that doing
one's duty Is not sufficient, that faith
fulness is not enough. To succeed,
and to occupy a position abovo a sub
ordinate one, requires not only work
and hnrd wort, but an lntenso lovo for
the work, and, abovo all, tho taking of
the initiative, doing what you do not
have to do, assuming responsibility
which Is not placed upon you, feeling
that you aro a part of the business
and not a more employee.
Tho load that you voluntarily shoul
der Is not half as hard to carry as
is the burden which is thrust upon
you.

Georgian advertised a lino truck farm
near Augusta for sale. A retired real
estate man of Newark, N J., without
answering the advertisement, decided
ho would go down and look tho place
over. Ho did so without tho owner be

returned to Augusta, hunted up the
o'wner, and said:
"I thought about buying tho farm
you advertised for sale, but I don't be
lieve I want tho plage."
"What is the matter? Any misrepre
sentation?" "No. But, you see, I planned to do
n littlo planting. I find I can't ralso
crops there?"
"Why not?"
"Why, ducks cat the crops."
"Ducks! What do you mean, man?"
"Why, tho negro tenant you havo
thero tipped me off."
"Wonder what is all this? Jump
into the car hero with mo and let mo
seo what it is all about."
"John," said tho owner. "What do
you mean by saying to this gentleman
that ducks destroy all your crop3?"
"Dey do. boss," tho negro mumbled.
"You knows dey do. Ain't no uso try
