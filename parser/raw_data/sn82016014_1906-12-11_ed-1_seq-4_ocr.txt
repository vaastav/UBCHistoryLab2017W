The State Journal Is a nember of the
Xvoolated Press and receives the full day
te-rraph report ot that ryeat mm or

publication In lurfltn.
The news Is received In The State Jour
nal build!rs ovor "fires for this sole pur
pose. Cm thing that makes Washington
sore la that Oyster Bay should rival it
in fame. .
The Houston Post rise3 to observe
that Mr. Roosevelt "would rather write
than be president.
It hag been officially decided that
there Is no ice trust in Kansas City.
Quite likely there is not ice in Toledo
either not now.
There seems to be almost as much
Soubt about whether Castro and the
Bhah of Persia are dead as there is
about Mrs. Eddy.
Will Governor Hoch say anything
about prohibition and resubmission in
Jils message, or not? It doesn't cost
anything to gcew.
The express companies don't do all
the robbing. One of them was the rob
bed down in Texas the othet day. to
the tune of $110,000.
There is c ; good thing about not
having a big income. Tou don't have
to worry about President Roosevelt's
Income tax proposition.
A baby monkey in the Peoria. 111.,
loo has been named Caruso. That
monkey will certainly have grounds
for anger when it grows up.
It i3 stated that Ruef also held up
the theaters in San Francisco. In most
places it works the other way the
theaters hold up the people.
We always had a pretty fair opinion
of Nebraska, but the news that it pays
its supreme court justices less than
Kansas does doesn't help it any.
They still have Senator Bailey doing
some explaining stunts down in Texas.
When a man has to do that much ex
plaining things look rather serious.
George W. Hanna has given his for
mal consent to mergi'ng the Populist
party with the Republican. but
George W. Wiley is still hanging back.
It may be necessary for Taft to go
out and sit on the lid in San Francisco
yet. If so, he should make sure there
are r.o earthquakes lying around loose.
Now '"iat President Roosevelt has
given the Japs a fine send-off, let us
ee if they live up to it bv overlook
ing thi3 little affair out at San Fran
cisco. For some reason the president failed
!n his message to recommend that all
Christmas presents be bought early.
Otherwise the good recommendations
were pretty well covered.
The president has given congress a
lot of things to think about during its
next vacation, for it probably won't
get through with more than a third of
the work the president has outlined.
Speaking of fame, an exchange re
fers to the iate Marcus Tullius Cicero
As the Albert J. Beveridge of Rome, al
though so far as is known Mr. Cicero
wrote nothing whatever about "The
Russian Advance."
After reading his income tax recom
mendation Mr. Bryan very naturally
Charges the president with stealing
come more of his clothes. And this is
the time of year when Mr. Bryan needs
oil his clothes, too.
Those California congressmen who
have been violent In their opposition to
the Japanese will naturally oppose the
proposition to allow the Japs to be
come citizen. The Japanese vote
wouldn't do a thing to them.
The governor of Arkansaw an
nounces that when he gets to the
United States senate he will start
something. The governor of Wiscon
etn did not advertise beforehand that
he would start something when he got
there, but he really did start a whole
avalanche.
If It is right for a railroad to con
fiscate coal that does not belong to it
in case of emergency, why is it not
also rip-ht for a community that is suf
fering for want of fuel to do the same
thing? A number of Kansas towns
have been unable to see '.he difference.
A London scientist thinks that the
Korth Pole will be located '-- 'he vi
cinity of Indianapolis In a couple of
thousand years. Hasn't the London
telentist got the time rather long? It
won't take Fairbanks that long to re
duce the temperature of Indianapolis.
It is proposed that a big crowd of
Kar.sans shall go to Galveston to in
stall tha silver service which the Btate
is to give to the battleship Kansas, but
unless it can be brought abou before
this year's passes expire, it Is feared
that the "crowd" will consist largely of
railroad employes whose passes are
not affected by mere laws.
THE TJtEASOlY SHORTAGE.
The manly action of F. E. Grimes, ex
state treasurer, in paying to the state
$3,281.25 in settlement of the shortages
in the state school fund charged against
his administration, probably closes the
incident from a legal standpoint. The
amount paid by Mr. Grimes is the sum
which he has agreed with the attorney
general can be enforced against him,
and his refunding It ends the necessity
for a civil action, while the statute of
limitations has precluded any criminal
action in the matter.
The sum .paid over by Mr. Grimes,
together with that advanced to C. R.
Richey, $783.00, to make good another
Item of the same kind several months
ago, amounts to more than Mr. Grimes'
salary as state treasurer during the en
tire time he held the office. Naturally
this is a big sum for a man in Mr.
Grimes' circumstances to pay, but he
does it. he says, simply because he feels
that the state has this claim against
him and he desires more than anything
etee to protect his name.
Few people will believe that Frank
Grimes took any of the money that is
missing from the state treasury, but
he makes no allegations in his state
ment as to who did take it. Yet there
Is no doubt that a large sum was taken
that belonged to the state. It is un
fortunate that this matter was not
cleared up, not only In order that the
guilty might be punished, but that the
innocent might be entirely cleared
from blame.
An opportunity to do this was af
forded in the case of the Garden City
shortage, but when the statute of limi
tations was allowed to run on that also
without action, the opportunity passed
by.
Mr. Grimes says he is the victim of
the carelessness, mistakes and unfaith
fulness of others. It is extremely un
fortunate for him that he is not in a
position to prove who these "others"
are. The refunding of practically his
entire salary for the .four years he was
In office is an extremely serious mat
er for Mr. Grimes financially, to say
nothing of the moral aspect of the case.
Could Mr. Grimes show who was guilty
of the theft he might recover this large
sum. More than that, he would render
an Important service to public morals,
which is the thing in which the peo
ple are deeply interested.
DEADLY HOT WATER.
The fatal scalding of a little child in
Parkdale Saturday recalls once more
that the deadly tub of hot water is one
of the greatest enemies of childhood
except in this particular Instance it
was a dishpan.
Almost every week some of the
country papers of Kansas contain an
account cf a dreadful accident of this
nature. Sometimes the child falls into
(he scalding flood, but not infrequently
It happens that the washing machine
Is the fatal agent. The machine is
filled with hot water and the little
child, unobserved by the mother,
creeps up and pulls out the plug, and
the scalding liquid pours out on it.
The exchange editor on every news
paper sees accounts of dozens of acci
dents of this nature, and always some
Innocent little one, the pride and joy of
its parents, is the vicitm. It is one of
the most terrible of deaths, entailing
suffering indescribable.
Where there are small children too
great care can not be taken in handling
scalding water. Pound the plug in the
washer so tightly that it can not pos
sibly be pulled out by little hands, and
do not under any circumstances leave
a tub of the scalding fluid where a
baby may plunge into it. Hot water is
a splendid thing in its place, and its
places are legion, but it takes a very
little of it sometimes to bring terrible
suffering and anguish.
SHALL IT RE CHANGED?
Up at Des Moines a convention has
been in session to consider the idea of
electing Ignited States senators by di
rect vote of the people and the out
come of that convention was expressed
in this resolution:
"That while this convention would
much prefer that congress should sub
mit to the several states a proposed
amendment to the constitution for the
election of senators b;- direct vote of
the people, so that the states might
pass upon it as a single question, yet
inasmuch as the senate persistently re
fuses to submit such amendment. It
therefore earnestly recommends that
the legislatures of the several states
do. in pursuance of Article IV of the
constitution of the United States, make
application to the congress to call a
convention for the purpose of propos
ing amendments to the constitution of
the United States."
Naturally most of the present mem
bers of the United States senate do not
desire the proposed amendment, for It
would retire many of them to private
life. There are other matters in the
constitution which some able men
think need fixing, and so the conven
tion is proposed to discuss all of them
and to recommend such amendments
as seem best.
Now the United States constitution
is a wonderful document. That such
a code of rules should have been
framed when this nation was only an
infant rind that It should have done
duty through all these years is little
short of marvellous.
The constitution ought pot to be
greatly changed unless there are
weighty reasons for suc-h change, but
the nation has now grown to such an
extent that a number cf changes may
be advisable. The problems of gov
ernment today were undreamed of
when our constitution was written.
It Is a difficult matter to amend the
constitution, and it Is right that it
should be. Therefore, a convention to
discuss the proposed amendments and
to formulate in proper form such as
seem desirable might be a pood thing.
The Washington Star takes this view
of it. It says:
"Well, why not a constitutional con
vention? What but good could come
of it? The debates In themselves
would be of the greatest value. To
such a body none but men of recog
nized learning in the law and govern
ment would be sent, and from their
conferences and discussions everybody
would be able to extract something of
value. The constitution as it stands
has occasioned no end of disputes.
Great lawyers and great publicists
have all along been found on either
side of the line. We have had from
the beginning, and have now. a strict
construction school and a liberal con
struction school, and all sorts of mean
ings have been read into, and then
read out of, the more Important provi
sions of the instrument.
"But more vital than this is the fact
that things have changed so much with
us in the past fifty years. In many
particulars we have a new country.
In that time we have fought two wars.
one of them for the preservation of
the government Itself, and from both
inherited new problems of the highest
Importance. The states were welded
together by the Civil war, and since
then we have been operating largely
on centralized principles, while as a
result of the war with Spain we have
acquired territory far from our base,
and calling for new wrinkles in the
exercise of both executive and legis
lative functions.
"We are not going backward in our
national life, and we cannot stand still.
Forward is the law of a vigorous bodv
politic, and if the national chart needs
substantial revision always preserv
ing of course the principles of liberty
and equality before the law revision
should be made. At any rate, why not
formally and officially discuss the
whole subject?"
JOURNAL ENTRIES
This department ; has ' considerable
doubt about these alleged San Fran
cisco grafters after all. There Is four
million dollars still unspent in the re

Now that the legislature is about to

meat awhile. This department has no
ambition to accuire a taste for rabbit.

So far as we are ci tlcerned the

JAYHAWKER JOTS
The Logan Republican remarks that
it has to be an ornery-looking plug that
won't bring $100 these days.
The little town of RobinFon has
moved up to the head of the procession.
It has passed an ordinance prohibiting
charivaris.
Some people pay a good deal for ex
perience. A Brown county farmer sold
his farm for $100 an acre and then
gave the purchaser $1,000 to trade back.
Editor Palmer, of Jewell, remarked
that "the old song about December be
ing as pleasant as May must have or
iginated In Kansas." And the next day
the cold wave came.
A Seneca man who once claimed he
could drink it or let It alone, commit
ted suicide last veek. He proved he
could let it alone, but it required ex
treme measures to do it.
Jewell Republican: If you want to
put in a bid on the Panama canal job.
kindly send along your certified check
for $200, COO to assure Uncle Sam that
you are not monkeying with him. You
must also assure him that you have an
avauaDie working capital of $5,000,000,
and provide a bond of $3,000,000. If
the contractor falls to complete the
woik within the time specified he will
forfeit $100,000 per month for each
month's delay. If the work is cnmnlp-
ted in less than the specified time he
will be paid a premium of $100,000 per
month. We would like to see some of
our Jewell City contractors working
under some such regulations. They
w ould have to change their gait or come
out a million dollars behind.
Confession by A. Croaker in the Hol
ton Recorder: I am the fortunate, or
unfoitunate as the case may be, father
of some children who have taken a col
lege course, and imbibed a predilection
for college athletics and sports. They
think they have a powerful good Joke
on me when they catch me reading or
quoting the Eporting news in the daily
paper. It does not seem to satisfy them
or do any good to argue that to com
bat evil of any kind successfully one
has to get and keep posted as to the
prevalence and effect of the evil. 1
some times think they are exceedingly
obtuse on matters where their preju
dices are involved. The sober logical
fact is, however, that most people, pos
sibly myself Included, have a strain of
the wild in them inherited, no doubt,
from our savage ancestors who used to
dress in skins of animals and live ir;
caves and dugouts and carry war
clubs and were ready, willing and anxi
ous at all times to fight their enemies
to the death. Evidently nearly 2 000
years of Christian civilization has not
entirely eradicated the wild and brutal
in us. This no doubt is why I hardly
ever miss reading the sporting pages of
the papers and enjoy it too. The respon
sibility rests with my savage ancestry
away back in the dim savage past and
with the well established law of
heredity which seems to defy civiliza
tion and Christianity. I am half in
clined sometimes to throw up my
hands, give up the contest and ac
knowledge myself bested, and yet this
same strain of belligerent blood pro
tests against acknowledging defeat

KANSAS COMMENT
LOOKING BACKWARD.
In taIlng an Inventory for the year
1906, one Is too apt to view all things
from the standpoint of his own per
sonal accomplishments that Is, what
it has meant to him. That is entirely
too narrow a view. During- the year
what have you dene to contribute to
the happiness and lighten the burdens
me companion of your joys and
sorrows? Have you brightened the
pathway o? the children of the house
hold? Have you helped In the allevia
tion of suffering in your community?
Have you assisted the poor and needy?
H-ive you extended svmpathy to the
bereavea? Have you done those little
things from day to dav that mean so
much to those about vou? If not,
though you have made your thousands
and have it in bank, though vou have
entertained lavishly, though you have
availed yourself of everv possible per
sonal comfort, the vear will show a
balance on the wrons side of the
ledger and in your reflective moments
you will realize that vou have not even
iXv V em?a livinS up to life's truest
ideals. Kingman Leader.
SOME PLANS.
A story comes out or Topeka to the
effect that the friends of Charles Curtis
are discussing a plan by which it is
expected that Curtis will be elected
senator. The Idea is not new, but it
has been successfully worked in other
similar contests. The plan is to organ
ize a "stampede" at the right moment
in the balloting. On the theory that
"the best laid plans of mice and men
aft gang aglee." it is not altogether im
probable that the plans to "scare" the
legislature into electing Curtis as Unit
ed States senator may also fail. We do
not beiieve that the people of Kansas
are for Curtis for senator and his elec
tion by trickery or otherwise will be a
public disaster. Concordia Blade.
HIGHER UP.
Governor Hoch and his cabinet pro
pose to give the people of Kansas a
practical exemplification of the real
thing in law enforcement, if all the of
fending mayors lose their jobs. The
only reason it hasn't been done before
was that nobody thought there was
any other way than to go after the
Jointist. The new plan is to go higher
up and make the man behind sweat.
Stockton Record.
GOT THEM SCARED.
One thing 13 certain, no governor of
Kansas has scared the jolntists so fre
quently or so effectively as Governor
Hoch has done. That isn't oil, either
he has scared a lot of county and city
officials as well. The prohibitionists
have a great argument in favor of their
position just now. If the mere threat
of law enforcement shuts up the Jointu,
they wonder what the real action would
do. Concordia Kansan.
UP ORDOWN?
The Kansas City papers note that
whisky Is going up. Possibly, in Mis

it is still going down and in the same
old way. Osborne Farmer.
SCHMIT2! AND REUF.
It i.i said that Mayor Schmitz and
Boss Reuf, under indictment in San
Francisco, have parted company. This
will not change the universal opinion,
however, that they should hang to

FROM OTHER PENS
HYSTERIA IN CONGRESSMEN.
California's delegation in congress Is
in danger of discrediting Itself at home,
by its extravagant criticism of that part
of the president's message relating to
the Japanese school question. San
Francisco is not the state of California.
And the "wild frenzy of indignation"
patriotically displayed by our congress
men, three thousand miles away, finds
few echoes among their constituents at
home, unless it be in Mr. Kahn's and
Mr. Knowland's districts.
These gentlemen, whose daily walks
are in the shadow of our nation's capi
tol. should, of all men, remember that
thev are citizens of the United States,
as well as of California, and that they
are not plenipotentiaries to a foreign
government, but servants of a whole
people, owing loyalty to a nation, as
well as to a state. Mr. Roosevelt, In
addressing congress, speaks as the
president of our country, not as an
individual, and as one charged with
the highest and gravest responsibili
ties. Among these Is the maintenance of
our treaty obligations, and the avoid
ance of complications which might re
sult in war. None knows better than
he what dangers may threaten our
peace. His utterances are clothed with
authority, and in matters of such im
port, beyond all others, he should
have the loyal support of congress
and the people. What are San Fran
cisco's local squabbles, as compared
with the most vital interests of the
nation ? ...
Behind the president, in his attitude,
is the highest law in the land, the con
stitution of the United States. In the
most emphatic language, it makes our
foreign treaties the supreme law,
above anything that congress could do,
superior to anything that states or
cities have the right to do. This au
thority was expressly delegated to the
treatv making power of the govern
ment the president and the senate.
Japan knows this. We can not say to
Japan that the federal government has
not power to interfere In a state or
municipality, to obtain her treaty
rights. She can point to the article
and section of our constitution which
expressly makes it the duty of the fed
eral government to do so.
We have hoped San Francisco would
find a way to settle the question, with
out embroiling the whole country. She
has an undoubted right to provide sep
arate school for the Japanese, provided
this is done, not by way of discrimina
tion, but to give greater efficiency to
the educational system. And she has
a right to bar grown men from her
primary and grammar schools. We
must approve and sympathize with the
objections to admitting adult Japanese,
or any other Japanese, to the classes
and school rooms intended for children
of tender and impressionable age. A
regulation limiting the age of pupils
in attendance would be bot hlegal and
justifiable. But it must not be dis
criminative. We believe San Francisco will find
a way out of the difficulty, and Ivope
she will do so without federal inter
vention. That the latter will be forth
coming, however, unlegs the proper
steps are taken to make such a de
plorable course unnecessary, is certain.
Meantime, stop this silly hullabaloo
about insults to the state of California.

American Magazine.
Making Money Out of a Waste-Pile.
The people of Chicago are lucky,
says Wm. Hard In the Technical
vv orid Magazine for December. Wit
ness the rock heap which was
oequeathed to them by the con
tractors who dug the Chicago
drainage canal. But what could
be a harder stroke of bad luck
than to be encumbered with a
heterogeneous scrap pile of some fifty
million cubic yards of dirt and stone?
How to rid themselves of this monster
incubus without depleting the city
treasury, would be a question for the
citizens to decide at any other time.
But this is just the point where luck
came to the rescue.
The people of Chicago are lucky be
cause they dug their big ditch at the
psychological moment. Just as the
concrete age is being ushered in. and
building contractors have visions of
mountains of crushed stone and rivers
or cement, the people of Chicago drop
onto the market with twenty-three
minion cubic vards of available rock
But even millions of cubic yards of
rocK couia not break the Chicago
raitn in concrete, and the big con
tractor, John M. Ewen. jumped under
the market with the highest bid for
onicago s backyard scrap pile. At the
present price of crushed stone in Chi
cago, the waste heap will sell for as
much as it cost to dig the whole
drainage canal.
In addition to selling the crushed
stone, concrete blocks are to be made
right alons the banks of the canal
and shipped to market, Just as bricks
are at present. Mr. Ewen will install
half a million dollars' worth of ma
chinery, which will crush the stone
and make it into concrete blocks. The
actual cost of the drainage canal did
not exceed 36 million dollars, and Mr.
Ewen believes that the crushed stone
and cement blocks will sell for at least
that amount. Thus will a new Indus
try be established, and the people of
Chicago reimbursed for their trouble
in digging their big canal.
Where Some Writers Fall.
In the Editor's Study in Harper's for
December, Mr. Alden gives his opinion
that the chief fault to be guarded
against in writing is the lack of spon
taneity. "The most frequent flefect in fiction
submitted for magazine use, and, we
might add, in most of the fiction that
somehow gets published in book form,
is its lack of spontaneity in construction
and expression. The writer of this man
ufactured fiction has a certain precalcu-
lated effect in view, with reference to
which he ambitiously contrives every
incident and situation of his story. The
harder he tries the more surely he fails
of any genuine appeal to his readers. If
he disguises his labor by a facile mas
tery of dramatic material and expres
sion, he may succeed in reaching crude
sensibilities and, because of his lower
aim, may outsell his betters. The mul
titude is easily ca ivated by splendid
artifice, which, in exceptional instances,
has compelled the admiration of even
the judicious. We shall find, however,
upon close examination, thaL in such in
stances the writer has not by his stren
uous effort wholly closed the door
against all spontaneity. Pee came very
near to the exclusion in his short stor
ies of such genius as was in him; but
because he was by temperament a poet,
a lover therefore of haunting melody
and easily the creator of pregnant at
mospheres, he could not completely shut
himself out of his fiction. In our day
polite literature must appeal to human
sympathies, and the writer's fertility of
Invention is of little service."
An Infernal Drink.
A diverting Joke was played on For
mer Prime Minister Balfour on the
first St. Patrick's day of his tenure of
the Irish chief secretaryship. A cigar
box, delivered to him at the house of
commons, contained a bunch of sham
rocks, "From a sincere Irish admirer."
But, to the terror of his secretaries, the
box was also fund to contain a wicked
looking steel spring, covered with a
queer white compound. A chemical
expert was called for. and he examined
the "infernal machine" everybody
momentarily expecting an explosion.
The puzzled chemist, venturing to put
a narticle of the compound on his
tongue, found that it was simply su
gar, impregnated with lemon. He then
turned the box upside down, and out
rolled a rusty corkscrew, a spiral
spring, and an old nutmeg-grater.
There was also a scrap of paper in
scribed: "Buy the whiskey yourself;
you can then concoct the famous lem
onade of Ballyhooley, and drink to
Ouid Ireland." The Bohemian.

THE E VENING STOR Y
Emmy's Redemption.
(By Martha McCulloch-WiUiams.)
"You wish! 'If wishes were horses
beggars might ride.' " Aunt Mag
quoted spitefully to her partial name
sake, Margaret Emmeline.
The Emmeline had been a standing
grievance ever since the girl was chris
tened. Aunt Mag, otherwise Miss
Bronson, had an instinct of Jealous
supremacy toward whatever was her
own. Being a just person she called
her only niece by the awkward full
name, notwithstanding in all other
mouths she was simply Emmy. That
was the worst of it. Miss Bronson in
her own mind, accused Emmy's meek
mother of having plotted it from the
first. Naturally she had not shed many
tears when the offender slipped apolo
getically out of life, leaving Emmy to
the untender mercies of her masterful
sister-in-law. Handsome, luckless.
Jack Bronson, the father, had died
soon after Emmy was born died on
the ocean, and been buried at sea. At
least that was what his sister had
given out. The widow had said: noth
ing. Neither had she worn black to
the anger of Miss Bronson and the
great scandal of the village. For once
the slim-faced woman, who was com
monly as wax In stronger hands, had
withstood her world, saying only with
a dreamy, wistful look: "Jack under
stands."
Emmy was her father over again
dark-eyed, olive skinned, with red lips
delicately curved, and cheeks like
damask roses. She had his gay tem
per also, his hlgn neaa, nis imuu
getting her own way, in spite of every
thing. The village unanimously yiv
nounced her a handful even for Miss
Bronson, whose hand was not light.
Emmy was fourteen when her mother
died. It was a standing marvel to
evervhnrlv that she had gone quietly
away to boarding school at Miss Bron
son's orders, albeit heretofore she had
hated and flouted schools of every srt.
It was even a greater surprise to have
her come back four years later just
the same Emmy for all her wonderful
accomplishments.
It was plain sne aia ni V.
Mag, but the two kept truce with each
other. Those who wonaerea m "
mie-ht have understood had tney uediu
poor Lena Bronson's dying admoni
tion: "Obey your Aunt Margaret. Re
member what we owe her. Until un-
io the deht is naid it rests wnn you
to make her the only possible return.
There had been no need to be more
explicit Emmy understoi;. TJrouSn
a passion of tears she had sobbed in ,
answer: "I will." !
Obedience had been hard ana e.i6
often, but she had nlncnea ui.u. u;
came to the question of marriage. Miss
Bronson's precepts were all against ner
example. "I want you to marry young
and marry well;" she naa sam i
Emmy as soon as the girl came numc.
t- .. ev, Viort said nothing more,
save in a general way. but Emmy had
come to understand what her elder
meant by marrying well. Cliffe Gor
ton was the only one among her hair
dozen beaux Miss Bronson ap'ooved.
She had to approve him, indeed, s.-eing
that she had at least half raised him.
Judge Go.ton, his father, had been her
man of business ever since her own
father died. His wife, flabby and an
invalid, had been pretty well under
iftcn p,nnenn'c thumh so had her son,
who was, after a sort, her image made
vigorous and vital. From his cradle
Cliffe had Leen a prize pretty boy as
fair and blue-eyed as Emmy was
peach-tinted. Although he was three
vears older, she had thrashed him
in the pra of Short fLOCkS. PoS-
sibly it was some reflex memory of the,
thrashing which made, him as a lover,"
appear to her ridiculously impossible.
"If my wishes were horses I'd surely
nu-av from Granby and every
thing," she said, sighing faintly as she
glanced at Miss Bronson.
Miss Bronson frowned heavily. 1
dare say you'd take the road to Owen
ton," she said pointedly. "Let's have
this thing out, Margaret Emmeline. 1
see no use in beating about the bush.
You were well enough content here un
til Cliffe Gorton proposed to you, and
that scatteredbralned young Hyland
came to town. Even you must admit
that there Is no comparison possible
between the two men. Cliffe has every
twniF In his favor. Hvland nothing. In
spite of that, since you seem to fancy
him
nvii Rut T don't. You are wrong all
wrong." Emmy interrupted with, how
ever, a furious blush.
Miss Bronson went on as tnougn sne
had not spoken: I should let you
have your way but ror one thing.
Whoever marries you must be told
the truth. Cliffs knows it already
bpsides he understands. I have done
and borne much out of love for my
father's name, lour lather disgraced
It "
"You must not say so. .otoay was
ever quite sure, tmmy pameu, ner
cheeks very white. Miss Bronson
glanced at her dry-eyed, then looked
away. Her own lips were ashen, but
they laughed bitterly as she said:
You mean everyDony was sure ex
cept your poor, foolish mother. She
believed her husband against right
and reason against the whole world.
Do vou know exactly what happened?
thought not," as Emmy shook her
nead.
"It was this: My brother, in desper
ate straits for money, went into Judge
Cliffe's office to beg mm for a loan,
it was late afternoon he knew the
judge had just been paid several thou
sand dollars, which he could not bank.
The money. Indeed, was in a letter tray
or hin desk, readv to rro into the safe.
There was a great hurly burly in the
office people coming ana going,
clerks getting ready to shut up every
thing. The Judcre was in an-d out or
the main office a dozen times while
your father sat beside the desk and
tray of money. Two men, clerks there,
saw him pick it up and finger the bills
n It. Two others heard nim entreat-
intr the ludsre a little later to lend him
even one thousand dollars. The Judge
refused "
"Of course. He would reruse money
to the flying," Emmy broke in, her
eves flashing.
Miss Bronson frowned. He is a Just
nln and Kind, eise wnere wouiu we
be?" she said. "But to go on. My
brother kept the Judge so late every
body else had gone, and the safe was
still to be shut. The money tray and
several other trays were upon the
dsk. Your father helped the Judge
hustle them Inside it. then rushed
away from him and took a train for

been there with Just the two of them.

I would not; l cnouid nave roujrnt. it
because of him I hate the race of
Gorton. I will never marry Cliffe not
though you turn me in the street."
"You know I shall not do- that," Miss
'Bronson said, heavily. "Understand
though you shall marry nobody else, i
gave up my comfort to save my pride.
You shall let no stranger know our se
cretperhaps to spurn you when he am

"My father was innocent. But untj;
it is proven I shall abide by your will,
Emmy said, her color coming hack.
"Because it is his wish and my mo b
er's," she added, as she walked to the
window. Almost Instantly she turned
from It, saying huskily: "Judge Gorton
is coming running, almost and wltn
out his hat. What can it mean?"
"More trouble," Miss Bronson said,
her mouth setting hard. Next minute
the Judge burst into the room with a
face of ashes. He had something In his
hand something flat and square and
"Look, Margaret," he cried, holding it
out to Miss Bronson. "Here is the
money, every dollar. We found It un
der the safe when it was moved to
day. There is just a little space, hard
lv an inch; I must have crowded the
tray into it in my fidgeting with the
other things. God forgive me that I
did not think of the possibility then.
But remember, I never accused that
poor boy "
"But you let him suffer Judgment and
punishment," Emmy cried, springing
forward. "Now will you atone by help
ing me find him?"
"Gladly!" said the Judge. "It was
the first thing I thought of. We will
find him, if he is living."
"You will not need to search far,'
Miss Bronson said, with quivering lips.
"I have never lost track of him, nor
let him suffer for anything at least not
since poor Lena died."
Next fall there was a wedding at the
Bronson place very quiet, but very
happy. The groom's name was Hyland,
and the bride was given away by her
father, who had very white hair and
perpetually brooding eyes. Miss Bron
son cried a little to see Emmy go away,
but after all was over she laid her hand
softly upon her brother's shoulder, say

left." (Copyright, 1906, by Homer '
