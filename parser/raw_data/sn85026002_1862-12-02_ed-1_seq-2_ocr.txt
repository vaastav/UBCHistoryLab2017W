oompiianr with the request to that effect. If
tb conditio ol oar reiaUens la Iss g rati ty
ing tbaa formsrly, it iscertaiuly more salis-
laetory thai a nation so anbappilf distracted
might have reasonably apprsbeaded. A
blockade of 3,0UO mil of lea coast could not
be ettablisked aad vigorously enforced ia a
season of great eennercial activity like tb
present without committing occasional mis
takes, and inflicting unintentional injuries
upon foreign nations aid subjects. In clear
eases, of ikes kinds, I have, so fa as possi
ble beard and redressed the complaints by
friendly pewera There is, howevar, a lsrss
aad segmenting anas bar ofdoubUuluasesu pan
upos which tke Qovsromsotis enable to agree
witk the ' Oarvarnnent who protection i
demanded by the i claimant . There . are
more eases in which tke Coiled Stales ot tkeir
aitiseas sifter wrongs fross the naval or mili
tary aatborities of foreign nations, wbion the
Government of ibee Slate are not at one
prepared to radresa . I have proposed to son
of aba soreigS Stale interested mutual con
vent! oaa to examine aad adiuit such com
plaints. This has bee neti especially to
Qreat Britain, Fraaee. Spain aadi Prassia.
In each ease it baa been favorably received,
hot aot yet formally adopted. ..... !
. Applicatioaa bare bees made to me by
many free Americans of African , desoant to
favor tkeir emigration with a view to sash
ootouiestion as wa contemplated ia the re
cent acta of Congress. . Other parties at home
and abroad, torn from interested and other
motive have suggested similar measures,
while en tb otbar band aaveral of lb Span
ish Americas republics have protested against
ths sending of inch colonies, to their respec
tive urritoriaa Under these circemstances
I have declined to move any aueh colony to
any Slat witbont first obtaining the consent
of its Government, witk an agreement on it
part to receive and proteot suck emigrants in
all tbeir rights a freemen, aad I have at tbe
sain tim offered to the several States situat
ed in tb tropic, or having colonies there, to
negotiate with them, subject to the advice aad
oonssnl Of tk Senate, to favor th voluntary
migration Of portion of that Class to their
resjieclive territories, upon conditions which
shall be equal, just and humane. " '"'' ' ; .
' Liberia and Ilayti are yst the only coun
tries te which colonists of African 'descent
from here could go with certainty of being re
ceived and adopted as citisens; and I regret
to say that such person oonUmplating colon
ization d aot teem so willing to emigrate to
these countries as to some others, nor willing
as I think their interest demand. I believe,
however, that the opinion is improving, and
that ere long there will b an augmented Snd
considerable emigration ' to both - these coun
tries. Our relation with European States remain
undisturbed, and with States of our continent
hav improved, especially Mexico, Costa Rica,
Ao.
Th President speaks of a favored protect.
th Atlanlio telegraph, and extending th Pa
cific line to conneot with that being extended
across tk Russian Empire, thinks tbe mineral
resources af jthe Territories ought to be de
veloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in
that direction would hav a tendency to im
prove, th revenue. It is worthy of serious
consideration - whether some extraordinary
measures to promot that end cannot be adop
ted. Tbe means which suggest itself as
most likely to be effective, is a ecientiflo ex
ploration. Tk vast expenditures incident to
the military and aaval operation reqairsd for
the suppression of tke rebellion, bare hitherto
been met with a promptitude and certainly
unasual In similar circumstances, and ths
public credit ha been fully maintained.
The ooalinuenee ef the war, however, aad
tbe increased disbursements made necessary,
demands your best reflections as to the best
modes or proytdlog the necessary revenue.

The Pressident then suggested amendments
to ihe Constitution, Congress concurring, to k
proposed to th Legislatures ot C6nventlons
of the several - States, which,' if ratified by
three-rborth of said Legislators to be valid
ae parts of said Constitution. , .i., . ,
Th first srticle proposes that all Steles
abolishing Slavtry before January 1st, 1900,
shall "receiv compensation from tbe United
States;' '1 . i wwn n.ii ,
2d All slaves freed by chances of war any
time before the end of the rebellion shall be
forever free, but all owners who had not been
disloyal, shall be compensated. " """" ;
' M.' Congress may appropriate money and
otherwise provide, for oolonining free colored
persons, with tbeir consent at any place with
out the United States. . ,
The President discusses these Articles at
some length, snd asks if, then, for n eoranoa
object, slave property is to be saori&oed, is it
not just that it be done at common charge I
and if with leas money, or money more easily
paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union
by this means than we can by tbe war aione,
is it aot economical to do it? .-!, .
Tb proposed emancipation would shorten
ibis war, perpetuate peace, insure an increase
in pbpulatioa and proportionately, ths wealth
of th country.-- H"l"t
Th President thes says the pie consisting
of these articles, is recommended; not but that
a restoration of the national authority would
oe accepted wunout its adoption, nor win the
war or proceedings under the proclamation of
September 22d be stayed because of the. re
commendation of, this plan. . lis timely adop
tion, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and
thereby stay both; and notwithstanding' this
plan, the recommendation that Congress pro
vide by law for compensating aey States
which may adopt the emancipation before the
plan shall have - been acted upon, ie . hereby
earnestly renewed, i This plan is recommend
ed as a means not in conclusion of, but addi
tional to all others, for restoring arid preserv
ing the national- authority ' throughout the
Union, i t .iii.c..;ii.i.i i n jii'jiiu iiv.i. i ,,;(
The subject is presented exclusively in its
economical aspect , The plan is proposed, a

In conclusion, the President say the dog

stormy present. - Tbe occasion, it piled high
with difficulty nd we mutt rise with lbs Occa
