Worthy Brother?" ?nd Sisters of the
State Grange of Sooth Carolina: It
becomes my" do ty again to address yoa
oo the condition of the Orier io oar
State and So reason with yoa a poo the
seeds aod, requirements * of the
Grange. For twenty-five years the
Orange baa been en agricultural Organ
watson tn oar State, which bas been
etroestly laboring for the material,
social and intellectual advancement of
the farmer, ?o^d I wish to cor g rat ai a te
yan apon the saecess we have attained
No uifloence has done more to advance
tlteBOcial culture and enjoyment of the
former than the Grange Ou? coope?
rative efforts have done mach towards
rtdooiog the pt ices of fertilizers, farm
supplies and implements and loo se o old
anppfies, and cor yoa og sons and
daughters have enjoyed rare opportuni?
ties for iotelleetoal improvement, which
bave been fraught with wonderful
bringing forth of Trait. Th? Grange
bas been a grand organization for the
farmer, and it bas always been a matter
of great wonder te me that every farm
er in the land is not a zealous Granger.
We believe an organisation of tbe farm
era an absolote necessity in. this coun?
try Also, we believe ib selecting such
lenders as are thoroughly identified and
in sympathy with agriculture interests.
Wo believe ia organisation, not to
against any other or
^rofessioti, bot for our
it is with great pleas
upon the awakening
which indicates
lis n eoe ss i y, and
With the great army
seeking to secure for
leir families a fair
of their own labor,
as I said two years i
bow progressive we, aa
may become, if we cannot
tbe benefit of what is properly oar
owe, oar best efforts* are lost i we be
^eo?ae the dope pf somebody else.
f>"A? to the condition of the Order in
^ tbi? State : While the Grange is not a*
^'fenrishiag as it osoe waa, still we are
jrrowiog, and o om ber more to day than
, we did a year ago Two new Granges
bare been organized, and I am con
> . lVTO0ed that if the proper effort was pat
forth ?we could organize many new
Granges and reorganize many of those
. that once were strung, aod thu? ir -
crease our number and influence
throughout oor entire State, and it
gives me pleasure to State that ocr Na?
tional Grange stands ready to give ns
ewe?ry aid we can .reasonably expect.
Bat. brothers and sisters, we need ex
.pees no belp if we do not help ourselves.
vVe can build ap the Order if we ase
.earnest, presistent work. Now. shall
we make tbe effort ? Will this State
Grange, now m session, devise and pot
toto operation such pisos as will build
op the Order ? Th?s subject will and
oogntt to engage oor serions considera?
tion, and I traat you will not adjourn
tili yon. take some decided step in this
matter.
ip I regret that I cannot report a pros
perons condition among our farmers.
Oar food crops have been fairly good,
bot oar cotton crop, (the principal
mooey crop,)' while o ot a fol! yield, is
; being marketed at a price that does cot
pay for producing, and, in my judg?
ment, leaves the farmer in a worse
rcondition than a year ago. A remedy
for this is bei og sough: Ao au rest
exists among all the producing classes,
: ' aod to-day farmers are being urged to
assemble, to agitate and discuss this
great question. A foll discussion of.
these matters should be encouraged, for
oat of disoassioo light aod help may
nome. Upoo this question of obtaioiog
better prices for oor farm products
there is, I know, a radical differeoo? of
opinion, aod to expressing my views I
do not mean to bind this body or aoy
member of oar Order, and I do not
koow that I can say more than I said
to yon io my address- two years ago,
viz : "That tbe farmers bold the key to
tbe situation. Plant less cotton and re?
does the cost of makiog it by prodooiog
everything necessary on the farm, and
tbos become, io deed aod io troth, pro?
ducers and not altogether consumers
Let every member of oar Order through
. oot tbe load ase bis iofloenoe to prevent
the increase io the acreage of oottoo for
tbe fotare. 1 woald farther arge oar
members everywhere to ate every effort
to induce oar national legislative body
to pats soeh laws that will forever pre?
vent future specolation io farm prod oats
aod let tbe ioexorable !aw of sopply
aod demand fix the price of oar pro?
duce " Until we cao become independ?
ent of tbe factor and merchant, by
diversifying oor crops and selling more
tbao we boy. we cannot expect to be io
a poeitioo to better our condition or lift
ourselves from the position of "bewers
of wood aod drawers of water."
Another burning question should
bare your consideration, viz, tbe unjust
tare demaoded of oottoo producers
We to-day pay 6 per cent tare, whe^ in
reality the weight of cotton covering
amounts to only 3 J to 4 per cent. The
farmers eh on ld not rest till some meas
ure is taken by our National Congress
to rid us of this unjust borden I
brought this matter before the National
Grange at its last meeting and urged
some action by that body.
It was my pleasure to attend the
meeting of the National Grange, which
convened in the city of Harrisburg, Pa,
on the 19th nf November, aod it is ex
tremely gratifying to say tb*at the Or?
der throughout the United States was
never tn a more flourishing condition,
both aa to members and fioances.
And now, sisters and brothers, I
wish io conclusion' to express my
thanks to the officers and members of
tffis State Convention for the earnest
support which you have given to my
administration. Without such help it
must have failed Any progress we
have made as ap Order is due to the
earnest, zealous patrons you represent,
a?d I h?p? that every effort will be
made to add to our membership from
?ie solid, conservative, thinking men
and women of the farm Ic re?
tiring from the responsible posi?
tion to which you selected me I
can only ask for my successor the same
support whioh you have given me
And now to the work of the session and
may God direct and bless our labors
This being the time for-the election
of officers the following were eleoted to
serve for thc next two years, namely :

Washington, Deo. 5.-The regular,
or loog session of congress, ss it is
called because there DO constitutional
limits upon the per iod of its du ration.
opeos at noon to-morrow.
The leaders aod a large majority of
the members of both houses are here
to participate io tbe openiog cere?
monies, and President Mc Kio loy has
made tbe journey to Washington from
the bedside of bis dying mother that
his absence might not delay the Di?
tton al legislature at its assembling.
Tba extra session robs the opeoing of
the regular session of excitement and
interest which usually attaches to it
On the eve of a regular session ordina?
rily Washington thrills with excite?
ment. The hotel lobbies sargo with
place huorers io the wake of the vari?
?os candidates, for speaker, clerk, door?
keeper, etc The members are strug?
gling for oommittee assignments and
the air is full of rumors aod plots and
I counterplots But as the house was
completely organized at the extra ses?
sion and all toe committee assignments
were made then, beyond the natural
stimulus produced by the returning
statesmeo, the regular hangers on of
legislation and the outlining of schemes
by members of "the third house." or
lobby, Washington to-nigbt is tranquil
The programme of the house to-morrow
is very simple, and beyond the spec?
tacular show which it offers there ie
little attraction
The boase will be called to order by
the speaker, who, after the chaplain's
iovooatioo, will direst the clerk to call
the roll This having been accom?
plished aod the presence of a quorum
demonstrated, the clerk will be directed
to notify the senate that the bouse is
ready for business and a committee will
be appointed to wait upoo the Presi?
dent. After that there will be a recess'
to await the arrival of the President's
annual message, which will be read
upon its reception and be followed by
ao adjournment ur.til Taesday. This
is the rag ol ar routine, and OD less some
I thiog ooforseeo occurs, will not be de
parted from.
It is the intention of the house lead
era to proceed with the business of the
session as rapidly as possible. The
committees will all begio their labors
this week, and as all of them have
more or less bills on haod which were
introduced at the extra session there
will be oo lack of material for the boase
to work oo after the committees have
begun work. The appropriations com
minee have been at work for ten days,
and Chairman Cannon expects to pass
at least two of the regular budgets be?
fore the holidays-che legislative, exe?
cutive aod judicial aod tbe pension ap?
propriation bills One or the other of
these fills, it is expected, will be re?
ported by Wednesday, and the end of
the week promises to see the bouse
dowe to business Among the early
general measures to receive considera?
tion will be the bankruptcy bill
Whether it will be tho Nelson bill,
which passed the senate at tbe last ses?
sion, or a modification of the Torrey
bill, depends upon tbe temper of the
judiciary oommittee, wbieb will submit
tbe measure to the house. Beyond
doubt there will be several resolutions
of inquiry during the first week, wbich
may be more or less sensational and
some of tho radical pro Coba members
will attempt to get consideration for a
Cobao resolution before the foreign af?
fairs oommittee cao aot. Congressman
Livingston of Georgia is one of these
Bot o wi og to tbe nature of the boose
rules, all these hasty efforts will take
their regular course
There will be nothing except indispo?
sition apon tbe part of members to pre?
vent the senate's entering promptly
upon its work upon convening tomor?
row, as there is a calendar ready made
for it containing about 500 bills reported
from committees duricg the special ses?
sion. If aoy ci rsum s ti a ces should
prevent the receipt of the Preeideot's
message oo Mond?y the probabilities
are that the senate will adjoorn over
without taking up any other business
until the message oould be received
With the message read, it will remain
for the senate to decide whether it shall
enter seriously upoo the work of
the session after Monday or
begio a system of delay intended to
throw all important questions over be?
yond the Christmas holidays. The
iodioatioos are now for a little more
activity tban usual during the pro
holiday session This is largely due io
the fact that the supporters of tbe ad?
ministration and the advocates of
annexation are very anxious to s; cure
the earliest possible consideration of (be
treaty with Hawaii. Senator Davis,
chairman of the committee on foreign
relations, announces his purpose nfl
pressing annexation at th3 earliest pos?
sible moment, but it is probable tbe j
matter will not be taken up seriously J
until tbe committee can bave a meeting
and deoide upon detail? of procedure.
The committee will be called together j
on Wednesday for this purpose 0>-e
point which the committee will be call
ed upoo to decide in whether to proce d
to ratify the treaty annexation or to an
oex the islands by resolution. Annex
atiooistH have lost some votes during
the vacation, and there is now appre
bennion that the two thirds v >te neces?
sary i o assure the rati6cau<n cannot be
secured No sati?ifiOtory o-inv.^s if
possible until all the t^nators arriv-'.
and if it is then made manifeste that
tbe necessary two-thirds vote oanoot b3
secured it ts likely the proceeding, by
means of resolution, which would re?
quire only a majority vote, will be
ioaogorated Some members of the
foreigo relations committee who favor
annexation advocate this course, because
they say they see no reason for travers?
ing the ?ame ground twioe, as they
woold be compelled, todo incase the
mattet shoold be first considered in
executive session, fail there and then
be takeo up in the form of a resoldtiou
io open seoate and house.
The immigration bill, for which
Senator Lodge stands sponsor, is
practically at the head of the senate
legislative calendar and will be con?
sidered early in the session. Senator
Lodge to-dsy repeated bis iotention of
pressing the bili, but be will not anta*
gooize the Hawaiian treaty with it.
Tbe first bill on the calendar is Sena?
tor Gear's measure providiog for the
adjustment of the Pacific railroad debt,
but thaeale of the Union Pacifio doubt?
less will have the effect of causing the
temporary withdrawal of this bill and
the substitution of others. Of tbe 300
bills on the calendar, about 200 are
private pension bills and all of these
probably will be disposed of at one sit?
ting when taken up There are also
several hundreds recess appointments
to be considered in executive session.
It is not probable that much will be
done in tbe way of legislation during
the present week. There will be an
adjournment for the day after receiving
the message on Monday and as there is
no .disposition to press the Hawaiian
matter until the foreign relations com?
mittee agrees upon a line of action, the
indications now are that it will not be
takeo up in the seoate before next
week.
Tbe Regular Session Begins
Witbont Notable Incidents.
Washington. Dec 6.-The open
?ng day of the regular session I'D tbe
house passed without an unusual incl
dent of any kind. The formalities
attending the inauguration of the
session were dry, and except as a
spectacle hardly repaid the crowds
which thronged the public and private
gallaries. Mr. Dingley, the floor
leader of tbe majority ; Mr Bailey,
the recognized leader of the minor?
ity, and Mr Grosvenor, of Ohio, en?
joyed the distinguished honor of be?
ing appointed to wait upon the Presi?
dent, whose message was, of course,
the event of the day Its reading
was long and tedious, bat it was fol
lowed by close attention by the mern
ber? and the SDectators.
a
There was no demonstration until
the reading was concluded, when the
Republicans joined in a hearty expr?s
sion of approval. Immediately after
the reading of the message the house
adjourned out of respect to the mern
or?es of Senator George of Missis?
sippi, and Representative Wright, of
Massachusetts, who had died during
the session.
IQ tbe Senate.
Washington, Deo. 6 -Tbe attend?
ance upon the session of the senate *o
dav, both upoo the floor and in tbe gal?
leries, was notably large, despite the
well understood fact that little business
beyond the presentation of the Presi
deht'a message and t*r>e proceedings in?
cident thereto would he transacted.
Prior to th? convening, the members
passed no . hour in exchanging greet?
ings Mr Hanna of Ohio, who bas
been ill for a week, was given a cordial
reception by bis Republican colleagues.
Mr. Wolcott of Colorado was also given
a warm greeting. Charles Page
Bryao, the new United States minister
to China, was a notable figure io the
reserved gallery, and in the diplomatic
gallery were several members of the
Chinese legation and other members of
the diplomatic corps When the s-nate
convened after the reoess. Hon H D
S Money, the new senator from Mis?
sissippi, entered the chamber, but the
oath of office was not administered to
bim during the session. The recep?
tion and reading of ?be President's
message was the important and only
feature of the day
New York, December 5.-The
Prince Line steamer Trojan Prince,
which arrived from Leghorn, Genoa
and Naples, brought from the latter
port 1,008 streerage passengers, the
I greater portion of them being women
and children This is the largest
?umber of Itfc?ian immigrante brought
by any one steamer to this port in
many years. The State of health
on board was excellent
Canton, Ohio, December 5.-At
9 45 P M Dr Phillips left Mr? Mc?
Kinley. He said she was growing
weaker rapidly now and he scarcely
thought she could survive the night.
She is in no pain or distress, simply
quietly passing away
A special from Raleigh says :
Albert Johhson, the oldest locomotive
engineer in the United States, died
to day, aged 88. He was a native of
Petersbnig, Va . and began running
an engine in 1836.
Detriot, Mich. Dec 4-Two eu
burban cats carrying some 20 pan
sengers, and both running at a ?peed
of 1?5 miles an boor, collided on the

killed and a score of persons injured, j
10 of them serious.

Already the possibilities are beiog
