OFFERING VAPOR MACHINES HERE
Doctors of Local Sanatoria Declare Treatment
Has no Curative Agent and One Considers
it a Fake; Claimed Rents Are Charged Ac
cording to Patient's Ability to Pay.
Many persons who have come to
Albuquerque seeking to arrest or
cure tuberculosis, and who have
put their faith and hope in vapors
arising from a simple stovelike ma
chine in which medicated chips
are burned, are doomed to disap
pointment, according to statements
by physicians and health organiza
tion officials obtained through the
co-operation of the New Mexico
Public Health aaociation by the
Morning Journal and published for
the information of its readers.
Efficacy of the "cure" is grossly
exaggerated, if not actually mis
represented, according to those
who have investigated it, not
only here tint In other Cities, in
cluding one in which officers of
the company producing the "cure"
ore under federal indictments.
Believes It Fake.
"The Thompson Treatment com
pany rents for various sums a zinc
or tin machine in which medicated
chips are burned," said Dr. A. G.
Shortle of the Albuquerque sanato
rium last night. "Its representative
here asks, I have been informed,
from J60 to $100, per month rent
for the use of the ''cure.' I can de
scribe it in no other words than to
say simply that I consider it a
fake."
"I consider that the Thompson
Treatment company claims alto
gether too much, in the cure of tu
berculosis. There is no . curative
agent in the treatment they offer
for sale here and so far as science
knows there is no specific cure for
tuberculosis," was the statement of
lr. I.. S. l'eters of St. Joseph's
sanatorium and president or the
Chamber of Commerce here.
Officers Indicted.
Upon a query from the Morning
Journal, I'nited States District At

Tex., wired as follows:

FEAR OF
S
Germany Has Surrendered
or Destroyed Thousands
. . of Guns; France's Position
Is Secure, Claims.
(By The Aseoflated Press)
Paris, Dec. 17. The chamber of
deputies oted confidence in the
government today 493 to 65, after
discussing the resignation vester-
day of Andre Liefevre, the war min
ister. I General Castelnau, president of
the army commission, interpellat
ing Premier Ieygues on the resig
nation of M. Lefevre, said:
"The fears of former Minister
Lefevre would be Justified if Ger
many were not disarmed. We ask
the premier 'is Germany disarmed
or in, a fair way of disarmament?'
If not why are you waiting to per
form the operation, which this
chamber has been requesting un
ceasingly the past year.
Chamber Applauds.
"We must end, at least tempo
rarily, the military power of Ger
many and end it for as long a
period as possible. If Germany
has not been disarmed she must
be disarmed immediately. Ger
many Is a troublesome power and
is opposing resistance to execution
of the treaty. The reparations
question Is unsettled although the
fact remains that Germany was de
feated. France cannot reduce her
military expenses without sacrific
ing the highest national interests,
until Germany is disarmed."
The whole chamber applauded
General Castleman, including Hhe
socialists.
Premier Leygues, replying, said
the military bill, which caused the
resignation of M. Lefevre as in
sufficient to protect Franco, had
been indorsed by Marshals Foch,
.Toffre and Petaln and Generals
Mangin, Buat, Debney, Weygand
and others.
Cillers See No Ttnnfter.
"These eminent chiefs, to whom
we owe victory, see no danger for
the national defense In the govern
ment bill," Premier Leygues said.
"Is Germany totally disarmed?
No. Is she In a fair way to disarm
ing? Yes."
The premier added that Ger
many has surrendered 30.000 guns
an,i destroyed 28,000; surrendered
65,000 machine guns and destroyed
50,000; surrendered 97,000 ma-
chine gun tubes and destroyed 52,
000; surrendered 2.500,000 rifles
and destroyed 2,500,000.
"France's position is secure
against German aggression," M.
'Leygues declared, "and France al
so is capable of enforcing execu
tion of the treaty." -

I OLD RECIPE
JO
Common Garden Sage and
Sulphur Makes Streaked,
Faded or Gray Hair, Dark
and Youthful at Once,
Almost everyone knows that Sage
Tea -and Sulphur, properly com
pounded, brings back the natural
colot and lustre to the hair when
fa doll, Btreaked or gray. Years ago
the Tinly way to get this mixture
was to make It at home, which is
musSy and troublesome.
Nowadays we simply ask at any
drug store for "Wyeth's Sage and
Sulphur Compound." You will get
a large bottle of this old-time
tecipe improved by the addition of
other Ingredients, at very little
cost.' Everybody uses this prepa
ration now, because no one can
possibly tell that you darkened
yourthalr, as it does it so naturally
an.f venly. You dampen a sponge
or soft brush with it and draw this
throiigh your hair, taking one small
slrartd at a time; by morning the
grayfhair disappears, and after an
other application or two, your hair
becomes beautifully dark, thick
pnd glossv nnd you looV vesrs
younger. Wyeth s Sage and Sulphur
Compound is a delightful toilet
requisite. It Is not intended for the
cure, mitigation or prevention of
disease.
How To He Healthy.

stomach and liver In good working
order. This is easily done by tak

tablets strengthen the stomach and
