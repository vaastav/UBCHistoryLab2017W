with snow' made it the severest day

INJURIES FATAL TO
RAILROAD BRIDGE MAN
ifHUBERT STONE IS STRUCK
Hubert Stone, a member of the
bridge building crew "of the Illinois
Central Railroad, sustained fatal
injuries while at work on a bridge
near Winthrop Monday afternoon
The injured man "w®s hurried to Park
View hospital, where he passed away
at midnight.
It appears that the bridge crew
was doing some repair work on a
bridge near Winthrop, and were
about to drive th& last post when
the deplorable accident happened.
While the massive post was being
raised in position tlie chains slipped
and the heavy .post fell and struck
Mr. Stone a glanclig blow on the
head, rendering lira unconscious.
Besides being atritck this terrific
blow he was thrown from the tressle
to the frozen ground, a distance of
possible twelve feet.
Mr. Stone and l)is wife came to
Manchester about a year ago.. Soon
after coming to tlms city, Mr. Stone
secured employment on the C. A. &
N. Railway at Coggon. About five
months ago he secured work with
the Illinois Central bridge crew.
Since that time he has been one of
Richard Condon's most "faithful and
efficient men.
Mr. Stone was a man about thir
ty-five years of age and 'is survived
by his wife and a-number of close
relatives, many of whom reside In
and near Manchester.
Although a resident of Manchester
but a few months Air.- Stone had
formed a wide circle of friends
among the railroad men of the Du
buque division the Illinois Cen
tral, as well as among the residents
of this city. Manchester friends ex
tend profound sympathy to
the-bereaved widow- in this time of
sorrow.

by boys ot tender years, has undoubt

A DANGEROUS PRACTICE
Attempting to board a mowing
freight train is a dangerous practice,
and has been the cause of mahy a
young boy: becoming crippled ilor
life. The other day while a number
of traveling men were waiting for,
the afternoon passenger train they
noticed a lad of possibly nine or ten
yeargt of age attempting .to catch on
to a. moving freight tratn.'v The l«y
was hardly tall enough to reach^oHf
first step. Had It not been forythe'
timely warning of one of the travel

and the railroad company blamed for

PERFORMANCE A SUCCESS.
The minstrel performance which
the baseball fans ot Strawberry Point
gavo lust week, was a decided suc
cess, adding over $225 to the fund for
the maintenance of semi-profes
sional ball team in/ the hustling city
of Strawberry Point. Mr. Alton
Dunham, formerly of this city, had
charge of the music and stage set
tings. Some time ago Mr. Dunham
acquired an interest in the clothing
store of Gildner Bros., and 'has been
placed in charge of the firm's busi
ness at that place. The city to the
north has gained two estimable young
people in Mr. and Mrs. Dunham.
The Mail-Press has the following
to say regarding the minstrel per
formance:
"The home talent minstrel show
which was given in the Kingsley op
era house Tuesday night, under the
auspices of the base ball club was a
decided success in every way.
Financially it was a much bigger
success than any one anticipated
considering the deplorabale weather
and road conditions. There were
about 460 tickets sold and the dance
which immediately followed the show
netted something over $25.
an entertainment it far exceed­
ed anything in the way of a home
talent entertainment that has been
here in years. The general effect of
the stage settings^ were pleasing and
the home boys made-up in comical
minstrel costumes furnished much
amusement for everyone.
''We have neither time nor space
to go into detail and take up each
number of the program separately.
Suffice to say that every number was
greeted -with much applause and
most every one had to giye an en
core.
"The committee J. J. O'Brien, Carl
Deyo and Alton F. Dunham who had
the show in charge are deserving of
much credit and especially Mr. Dun
ham who was musical director and
had charge of the staging of the first
part. Mrs. O'Brien is also deserv
ing of' much praise for the interest
she took in the show as pianist. It
took considerable of her time and
probably lots of patience during re
hearsals."
—Fred H. Munson was a visitor
in Dubuque Tuesda.
—Mrs. C. W. Keagy, Mrs. H. F.
Arnold and Mrs. O. A. Dunham were
visitors in Dubuque on Tuesday.
—Hon. R. W. Tirrlll went to Ce
dar Rapids Tuesday Inorning on busi
ness. While there he also attended
a number of the sessions of the state
grange ineeting.
—At the regular of P. meeting
on Monday night, December 15, there
will be conferred upon three candi
dates the third "degree. Following
the conferring of the degrees an elab
orate supper wljl be served.
