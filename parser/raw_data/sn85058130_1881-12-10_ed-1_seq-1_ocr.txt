silver today for the Philadelphia San
Francisco New Orleans and Carson
mints
Speaker Keifer has appointed Ben
jamin P Jaynes of Ohio his clerk He
is a nephew of the Speaker and for some
time correspondent of the Chicago Times
Doorkeeper Burlow has appointed
Robert Hancock superintendent of the
document ootn
Total amount of 3K continued bonds
received for redemption under the 105th i
call to date 13734200
A Washington special says It is noted
here that several newspapers in com
menting on Secretary JPolgers recom
mendations to withdraw from circulation
outstanding silver certificates deprecate
such policy supposing that it would re
sult in stringency in the money market
Secretary Folgar has no intention of
effecting such a sudden withdrawal but
he does earnestly recommend a change
in the present law because it is operate
to the disadvantage of government in
many ways
Washington 9It is reported that the
Presidents message with reference to
the South American question does not
read at all like the manuscript furnished
by Blaine as tbe views of the state de
partment on the subject It is the habit
of the bend of departments to furnish the
executive facts bearing upon their
brunch of the so vice for the Presidents
resume of the stale of the Union bud
tho const quent recommendations Is ID
understood that Blaine in transmitting
the state department recommendations
bad incorporated language altogether toi
vigorous tor discretion in regard to Chili
and Peru The President quietly took
his own views of tho proprieties of t fi
situation and modified the ia jie u
the more calm expressi obaervt in
the message
It is rumored in army circloj that Ad
vocate General Swaim has unarmed the
finding of the court in the VN Kitt deer
case tie has spent months gJing eve >
the 2000 pages of testimony and hn
given the matter a most thorough ilt ng
It is said he finds tot the courtmart m
convicts Whittaker of mutilating hi w
ears and he sustains the verdict IH hayed
upon the evidence bearing upon the cyst
It is believed therefore that the nod of
the whole matter will be tht Whittak
will be dismissed from the rolls of tn
drum and his case will di = appear at last
from public view
Mouse Committees
Washington 9 Speaker Keifer
said today that nothing had yet
been done in regard to the commit
tee chairmanships of the House
which might not be undone tomor
row As to the composition of the
committees he maintains great reti
cence The impression prevails that
he will announce them nextweekbut
there is no authority from him for
the statement It is thought very
probable however that in view of
the acknowledged complications
surrounding the Utah case the
speaker will announce the commit
tee On elections on Tuesday so that
the contest may be taken in hand by
that committee without delay

THE ASSASSIN ltI > AD
His Old Life Exposed in All
UN HideonsuchS
Nearing the End ol tbe Trial
Washington gThe criminal
court opened promptly at 10 and
Dr McArthur again took the stand
Guitteau shouted out r Your
honor
Scoville Keep still please
Guitteau Well then you state it
at once if you dont I will
Scoville then addressed the court
and objected to the character of the
evidence which was given by wit
ness on the ground that evidence
as to any other crimes could not be
introduced when the prisoner is on
trial for this particular offense He
desired all such evidence stricken
outGuitteau
Guitteau here broke in excitedly
and shouted out It is purely in the
nature of a confessional MR Arthur
is not an expert or lawyer and I
object to him telling the jury and
the American people facts which I
told him years ago in regard to my
history
The court ruled thatthe evidence
could be admitted as tending to
show the general character of the
prisoner
Ccrknill Did you ever see any
thing in the prisoner to indicate in
sanity
Answer No sir I never did
Guitteau here broke in with one
of his noisy harangues and despite
the caution of the court and
the expostulations of counsel pro
ceeded to express his opinion of Dr
McArthur in terms not delicate
Turning to the reporters table he
disclaimed for some minutes against
the scandalous reports of his charac
ter and singling out the reporter of
the Republican shook his fist at
him threateningly
Colonel Corkhill desired the court
to restrain the prisoner when Guit
I teau turned to him and said You
go slow Corkhill you are spotted
and as soon as this business is over
the President will remove you
Witness allowed the prisoner to
occupy a desk in his law office at
Chicago for some months He
seemed to have a deal of collection
business and went in and out like
any business man Guitteau con
tinually interrupted and finally
witness said to bimh It seems your
close relations with the Deity of
late have corrupted your morals
The prisoner laughed heartily at
this sally and said Well that aint
so bad for a western man
Did you aver see anything in his
conduct that indicated unsoundness
of mind was the next question
To sir replied witness nothing
whatever He seemed to be a man
of ability vain and conceited but
then he had late from New York
on his card and we expected the
est This convulsed the court
Stephen English editor and pro
n letor ot the Insurance Times New
fork Look the stand I
Gu tit iu called out This man
wa in Ludlow Street Jail and I got
aim out for 8300
Witness give the circumstances
under which he became acquainted
with the prisoner Witness was in
jail I under 640000 bonds charged
tth libel The prisoner acted as
his attorney Guitteau frequently
and noisily interrupted witness
tiling him a liar and perjurer At
one time he shouted There isnt
an insurance man in New York that
does not know what a fraud you
are Witness continued The
prisoner swindled me out of SrjOO
and l also swindled many poor crea
tures in the jail by promising to help
them and getting their money and
then never raising a finger in their
behalf
Guitteau shouted at witness
Why I wouldnt spit on you on the
street you old scoundrel Ill get
some insurance men to show you up
you old fraud
Witness was then asked if he ever
detected any signs in the prisoner i
of insanity and replied On the
the contrary he was a remarkably
clear headed shrewd lawyer He
completely outwitted me
Warren G Brown attorney at
law New York was counsel for
Mrs Guitteau in obtaining a
divorce from the prisoner believed
the latter to be perfectly sane
Guitteau excitedly I want to
know Corkhill what all this kind
of evidence has got to do with the
real issue who fired the shot that
killed Garfield the Deity or I2 li
think it is devilish mean to rake up i
my character in all its details The
only issue here is who fired that
shot the ueitv or I justtake that
home CorkLill and think it over
till tomorrow morning I want to
know what all this has got to do
with the question of my sanity or
insanity on the 2d of July As I
have told you before I had time
enough to go crazy a hundred times
daring the interval
W S Caldwell physician treated
L W Guitteau during his last ill
ness never detected any evidence
of mental uusoundneab
George W Plummer was called
Guitteau immediately shouted I
owe that man 20 but it baS cost
government S 200 to get him here I
think the Presidents attention bet
ter be called to the way you are
squandering governments money i
To CorkhillHe might bounce you
atonce You will cost government
6200000 or 300000 at this rate
D McLean Shaw testified that
1 f
r
1 t
Guitteau told him he was bound to
have notoriety somehow or other
He might kill some big man and
imitate Wilkes Booth At this the 1
prisoner became very violent and
abusive
Washington 9 Guitteau was I
worse today in interruptions and
violence than at any time since his
trial commenced One of the wit
nesses who seems to have beena
lawyer testified that some eight
years ago Guitteau had told I
him he G intended to emulate
Wilkes Booth and repeated some
of an alleged conversation to that
effect Guitteau interrupted him
all through his testimony and called I
him a low dirty lying Jew and 1
denied ever having done anything
wrong except to leave unpaid board i i
bills borrowing money and com
mitting adultery when he wanted
to get a divorce He was passion I
atly violent and called the witness l I
a vile pettifogger and like names lI l I
