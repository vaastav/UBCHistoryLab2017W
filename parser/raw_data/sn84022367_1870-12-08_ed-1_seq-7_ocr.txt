"-Tlio Bureau I Statlatlca.
The chief of tha Bateau of Statistics in
his annual report takes occasion to mska
some sensible remarks relatiTe to the
great importance of immigration to the
prosperitj of the country. He suggests
that since the termination of ine war the
fertile lands of the South, heretofore, un
der a system of servile labor but partially
cultivated, present extraordinary induce
ments for immigration at the present time
in the North Western, Southern and Pa
ciflc States there exists a demand for com'
mon, and to a more limited extent, for
skilled labor, never before equalled.
With a view of affording to the immi
grant such reliable information in regard
to the several states aa would enable him
to make an intelligent choice of a home, a
list of questions was forwarded to the as
sessors of Internal Revenue in all the
States West and South of Pennsylvania
calculated to show the opportunities and
advantages offerred to settlers in each
section. Replies to these questions have
been received and the data classified and
compiled, embodying an amount of infor
mation, which in fnllness and, accuracy
hai not before been attained. These com
pilations are now undergoing revision
and will in connection with tables show
ing the oost of labor in the several States
corrected to October 1870, be submit
ted to the public in a special report here
after. The Bureau of Statistics promises to
become one of tho most useful subordinate
departments at Washington. The head
of the office in required to collect, digest
and arrange for the use of Congress -statistics
of tho manufactures of the United
States, their localities, sources of faw ma
terials, markets, exchanges with the pro
ducing regions of the country, transpor
tation of product!, wages, and suoh other
conditions as are found to affect their
paosperity. The prevent year this Bu
reau will not be us valuable for the statis
tics ami Information furnished aa hereof ter
In those years of the decade in which the
census is not tken. The publication of
the census returns of the products of in
dustry, given in detail and with approxi
juate accuracy, rtipersedea much of the
iuf0mition which hereafter it will be the
Jiitv oi the department to collect. The
subject po.',st'H,e', Kret and increasing im
portance, h.,t should noA, be lost sijfht
of ; t ut in the succeeding years of this
decado the earnest rersistent efforts
of tho Bureau should be directed to ob
taining and publishingr trustworthy in
formation in reimrd to the extent and
Condit:ou of our lunnufaoturing industry
This depHrtment will grow mire valuable
each year, until each State will have or
ganized a similar department for its own
purposes. Vermont has already com
menced in this direction by connect
ing the collection of statistics with
the Board of Agriculture created by
the last Legislature, and its fir.-t rejort,
two years hence, if wisely directed, will
show statistics of our farms, quarries,
mines, water power, railways and their
products and transportation, that will sur
prise the people and erhance the material
prosperity of the State.
The Fiiesi dent's Message. From
the little that can be learned regarding
the tone and matter of the President's
Message, tha public may expect a docu
ment full of bold aud positive expressions.
It will be somewhat longer thxn that of
lrtt jenr, and will discuss all the nutters
that, have engaged the attention of the
Administration for the past year. There
M be a recommendation cf notion on the
wl1 , question, and a review of what

The Pre-ident will adhere, oQ
teristio firmness, to his position "we. jn,
quisitiou of a foothold in the . ftor
dies ; and on the question of reviving
commerce he will reassert the views ex
preised lust summer. The Fresideut has
piven considerable thought lately to the
great evils arising from the growing
power of great corporations, and the con
centration of vast material interests in the
hands ci the few. He may, however,
prefer to present this matter to Congress
at a later period, wheja his views as to the
remedy are more thoroughly defined. Al
together, the Meesugo is said to be decid
edly affirmative in tone, and it Is con
fidently expected that it will stike the
publio mind even more favorably than
did that jof last year.
The Eastern Question. The reply
of Prince Gortschakoff to Earl Granville
was published on Thursday in St. Peters-
burs. The Russian Minister declines to
discuss the question of propriety involved
involved in his first note. He regrets
that Earl Granville takes exception to his
form of communication, and says the ab
rogation of the entire trea.y was not con
templated. The peace of the world re
quired that treaty. Russia, however, is
willinir to enter into a conference of the
Powers. A St. Petersburg dispatch says
a paoifio solution is assured. The Vienna
heveFreie Preiae says France will partici
pate in a conference to be held at London.
A dispatoh from Tours, however, says
that that branoh of the Government has
referred the matter to their collogues in
Faris. According to the "Vienna journal
above named, the preliminary discussions
will iuvolve other questions than those
t-otinected with the Treaty of 1S5G. A
Berlin telegram says a new treaty will be
"oposed, omitting the question of the
l' -k Sea neutrality,

the system will be rapidly extended until
all principal points in the country are
accommodated with money order offices.
It is now also in contemplation to make
an international arrangament whereby
money may be remitted between Eng
land and the United States with the
same guarantees as those afforded by our
domestio money order ' ofaces. This
would be of immeBse advantage to the
thousands of people who have remittances
to make to their friends in Europe, in
Ireland especially, and we hope that the

that it will accommodate the great nun
ber of our foreign born citizens who wish
to send moneys "home." '
Mormon Church Property Tax
able. The acting commissioner of In
ternal Revenue has decided that the in
come from the Mormon Church property,
held by Brigham Young aa trustee is tax
able; the points raised by Mr. Young,
that it consisted of voluntary contribu
tions, ana that it was held as common
property by more than five persons, and
therefore exempt, being overruled. The
penalties of excommunication and other
punishments for non-payment of tithes
werwheld to destroy their character as
voluntary contributions. The Collector
of Internal Revenue in Utah has been di
rected to collect the tax at once, without
the penalty which was added for non
payment. .

Chas. Page, Secretary
Mossip with the Editor.
Summer, once ao voluptuous and beau
tiful, has lost her roses and dimples, and
now rests faint and languid upon the lap
of Autumn ; and the "sear and yellow leaf
reminds us of the glories departed, far
away iu .the golden past, and, as we ling
ering gaze, pale Autumn turns her
mournful ryes upon us, in a sad farewell,
Li!e bhe silently points to the white
girmeuts of her cold-hearted lover, who
stands upon the mountain-top, impatient
ly wmting for his bride.
As nature ields her beauties, one by
one, to the Frost King, and we have little
left cutatJc, with wtiivti to uliaiui the ejr
we turn within to the light and love of
our hearths and homes, aad seek protec
tion and comfort from those we love.
" And if the day we gave to labor,
The eve ing'a due to friend and neighbor.'
Thus Mr. Editor, our evening enter
tainments have commenced, though some
what earlier this season than formerly,
yet we bil thetu with a hearty welcome.
The reunion of old friends and friend
ship, the pleasant interchange of
thoughts, spiced with music and mirth,
around the firesidp, all tend to elevate the
soul, and make us wiser and happier..
Our first entertainment came off in the
shape of a "surprise party" at the house
of Mr. Harrison White, on Monday even
ing, Oct. 31st, and although the evening
was rather inclement, the good people of
our town there assembled to the number
of about fifty, the object being to present
Miss Julie White with a purse of money
for her very acceptable services to us,
upon the Sabbath, as organist. This was
also her fifteenth anniversary, and we
doubt not, that thii unexpected celebrat
ing of it will cause her ever to remember
it with pleasure.
A purse of over twenty dollars was
made up for her, Mr. A. E. Stanley very
neatly and appropriately making the pre
sentation, to whioh she earnestly and
feelingly replied in tho following words :
" I thank you all, and hope I may prove
myself worthy of your t?ift." Tears of
gratitude speaking more eloquently than
further language could have done, and
we felt amply repaid for thus demoustrat
ing our appreciation for her labors. -
Refreshments were served immediately
after, and, judging from the bountiful
supply of candies, popped-corn, lucious
ice-cream, and fragrant tea, we came to
the very unavoidable conclusion that Mr.
White and.lady had stolen a march on us,
and that we were the surprised ones, after
all.
Music, both vocal and instrumental,
lent its charms throughout the evening,
and general good feeling prevailed ; and
when we bade good-jnight to our friends
we felt happier and better for this, our
first entertainment of the season.

Obituary. A clergyman writes us
that Deacon James Muzzey of Jamaica
died November 18th, at tho advanced age
of 81 years 7 months and IS days. He
had been a resident of the town since he
was two years old, a devoted christian
forty-five years, and a faithful Deacon of
the Baptist Church for more than thirty
years. "JU.e came aown to nis grave ue
shock of corn cometh in its season ; bis

East Potjltnet. We learn that we
were mistaken in several of the particu
lars relative to the accident at East
oultney. The wagon ' shop is being
erected near the covered bridge by
Messrs. Dewey and Morse, and it was a
young man and' not a boy who fell there
from. He fell 40 feet striking three times
before he finally landed on the stone in
the wheel pit. Dr. A. E. Horton and not
Dr. Ross was in attendandance within 10
minutes. Mr. E. 8. Dewey, the first to
reach him, thought him dead. The young
man is now out and is gaining. It was a
narrow escape from death. . r " .'- ' c
The . Herald. A h gentleman ' is
Windsor County in renewing his . sub
scription for the Weekly Herald says :
"I cannot give Up the HERALD, as I was
born within three miles of Rutland, it
seems like an old friend anxiously looked
for once a week, to tell me the news from
all the surrounding towns."
A LARGE Owl. Samuel Parker of
this town, exhibited in town on Saturday
last, a large brown Cat OwL shot by him
on the 26th of November, from the top of
his barn. It was a ferocious looking bird
and measured four feet and nine inches
from tip to tip of its wings and weighed
about five pounds.
Novel Inscription. A few dayB
since a letter with the following novel in
scription passed through the post-office at
Brandon :
Uncle Bam, you are my Debtor,
I gave you three cents to carry this letter,
' If you carry it safe to your destination
It will be a big thing for the Administration.
If you dont be sure you'll get swore at,
And in future I will be a Democrat. '
Chester. In . giving the account of
the new Episcopal Church, in Chester a
few days since, the name of the Architect,
Pitt W. Wentwortb, was omitted through
inadvertence, as you might as well start
a ship across the ocean without a pilot, as
describe a publio building without men
tioning the architect, besides Mr. Went-
worth was a Bellows Falls boy, and well
known in the vicinity, and ranks high in
his profession. " .

Is a point I can recommend. A good hotells sent
there by Peterman. Last winter I saweraler
sorts there whose lungs had been badly diseased, but
who, under the healinc Influence of the climate and
my medicines, were getting well.
One hundred miles farther down the river Is a
point which I would prefer to I'alatka, as the tem-
eratur Is mose even, and the air dry and bracing,
ellonville aad Enterprise are located there. I
should givs a decided preference to Helloavlue: It
is two miles from river or lake. mnA it

might be better, and patients complain at times
but that is a good sign, as it indicates a return of

Increase in flesh, and then the lunn most heal.
jackrnnrUle, nibemia. Green Cove, and many
other places In various parts of Florida, can be saie
ly recommended to consumptives in winter. Jay
f.or, ay ing so are, that patients are less lia
ble to take cold there than where there is a leas
even temperature; and it Is not necessary to say,
that, where a consumptive tH-nxm exposes hinWlf
to frequent colds, he Is eertaln to aie shortly:
therefore my advice is, go well down into the State
out of the reach of prevailing east winds and fogs!
Jacksonville, or almost any other of ths localities
I have named, will benefit those who are troubled
with a torpid liver, a disordered stomach, deranged
bowels, sore throat, or cough ; but, for those whosa
lungs are diseased, a more southern point is ear
nestly mcommended.
For nftcenyeara prior to 1869, 1 was profession
ally in New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadel
phia every week, where I saw and examined on an
average five hundred patients a week. A practice
soext.-nolve, embracing every possible phase of lung
diwa-e, lias enabled me to understand the disease
fully; and hence my caution in regard to baking ,
eold. A person may take vast quantities i
" Sthfnck's Pulmonic Syrup, Seaweed Tonic, and
Mandrake I'Uls," and yet die if he does not avoid
taking cold.
In Florida, nearly everybody is using Schenck's
Mandrake Pills; for the climate is more likely
to produce bilious habits, than more northern latl-
tudes. It is a well-established fact, that natives
of Florida rarely die of consumption, especially
those of the southern part. On the other hand, in
New England, one-third at least of the population
!ie of this terrible disease. In the Middle States,
it d.s not prevail so largely: still there are many
1 !Kuiands of esses there. What a vast percentage
t,f lite would be saved if consumptives were as
msily alarmed In regard totaklng fresh colds as they
arc about scarlet fever, smaU-pox.Ae. I but they are
n. rt : they taka w hat they tans a little eold. which
they are credulous enough to believe will wear off
in a few days. They pay no attention to it, and
hence it lavs the foundation for another sad an
other still, until the lungs are diseased beyond all
hope of cure.
My advice to persons whose lungs are affected,
even slightly, ia to lay in a stock of Hchenck's Pul
monic Hyrrip, Schenck's Seaweed Tonic, and
ftchenck's Mandrake rills, and go to Florida.' I re
commend these particular medicines, because I am
thoroughly acquainted with their action. I know,
that, where they are used In strict accordance with
i.iv directions, they will do the work that is re
quired. This accomplished, nature will do the rest,
ilie physician who prescribes for cold, cough, or
night sweats, and then advises the patient to walk
or ride out every day, will be sure to have a corpse
on liis bands before long.
My plants, to give my three medicines in accord
ance with the printed directions, except in some
coxes where a freer nse of the Mandrake Pills i
necessary. My object Is, to give tone to the stom
ach, to get up a good appetite. It is always a
good sign when a patient begins to grow hungry:
1 have hopes of such. With a relish for food, and
the gratification of that relish, comes food blood,
nnd with it more flesh, which is closely followed
by a healing of the lungs, then the cough loosens
and abates, tho creeping chills and clammy night
sw-eau no longer prostrate and annoy, and the
pal it ut gets well, provided he avoids taking cold.
ow, there are Thany consumptives who have
not tho muau lo go to Florida. The quest km may
he a Wed, I s there no hope for such? Certainly
there is. My advice to such Is, audeverhas been,
lo htav in a warm room during the winter, with a
temperature ef about seventy degrees, which
should be kept regularly at that point by means of
a thermometer. Let such a patient take his exer.
rise within the limits of the room by walking up
and down as much as his strength will permit, lit
order to keep up a healthy circulation of the blood.
I have cured thousands by this system, and can do
M s".nn. Consumption is as easily cured as any
other disease. If it Is taken in time, and the proper
kind of treatment is pursued. The tact stands un-0.-tuUMl
on record, that Schenck's 1'iumonic
Rt'riio, Mandrake I'tlls, and Seaweed Tonic have
cured very many of what seemed to be hopeless
rtvi of consumption. Co where you will, you will
he utmost certain to find some poor consumptive
who h;u been rescued from the very jaws of dfcaih
ly their use..
Ho far as the Mandrake Tills are concerned,
everybody should keep a supply of them on hand.
They act ou the liver better than calomel, and
leave none of its hurtful eflects behind. In fact,
tbev are excellent in all cases where a Durcative
medicine is required. If you have partaken too
freely of fruit, and diarrhoea t-nucs, a dose of the
Mandrake will cure you. If you are subject to
sick headache, take a dose of the Mandrakes, and
tliev will relieve vou in two hours. If you would
obviate the effect of a change of water, or the too
free indulgence in fruit, take one of the Mandrakes
every ni ght, aad you may then drink water, and
eat water-melons, pears, apples, plums, peaches, or
corn, without the rink of being made sick by them.
'1 hey will protect those who live in damp aituatiuus
against chills and levers. Try them. They am
perfectly harmless. They can do you good only.

Uu.t ti.e value of my uiedieines depends entirely
upon their being taken strictly aocoiiiing to direc
tions. In conclusion. I will gay, that when person-,
take my medicines, and their systems are brought
into a healthy condition thereby, they are not ao
liable to take cold ; yet no one with diseased lungs
can bear a sudden change of atmosphere without
the liability of greater or less irritation of the bron
