Tho President's Message elicits the
usual variety of comments from the
.N'cw York city press. The Tribune is
not satisfied with it. Tho Herald re
gards it as a " conclusive vindication of
his course." The New A* welcomes it as
placing the President "in direct opposi
tion to the foolish and vindictive policy
of the Republicans, as developed by the
representatives of that party in Con
gress." The H'oWf-luis not-made up its
mind. The Times regards its views us
"full of wisdom uud conveyed with
great force und dignity ;" but 1 hen the
Timts would have said the same thing
If Hie Message had been delivered in
Clioclusv. The Journal of Commerce
pronounces it "able und vigorous/ and
dcslinedto "lake rank among the noble
documents of our history." The Even
ing Post finds it "frank, dignified,
direct and manly." We believe there
are one or two other duilies, but we for
get their names just nosy.
THE MESSAGE AND THK .KITICS
According to the correspondent of the
President, lolihson excites v grout degree
of surprise, in Washington, both for
whal it contains and what it omits, ami
"the southern members of Congress are
disappointed, because their claims to
their sealsare not plainly and nii.iiuivo
cally staled." Tho correspondent
thinks it a hardship that "the ni'ssue
leaves the whole matter to Congress,
and iLis regarded, therefore, as a virtual
ac*|iiiesoence in tlie Stunner and Ste
vens programme for the permanent ex
clusion of the southern members."
Such is tho slatomentof the corespond
ent of a journal, the highest aspiration
of Avhieli it seems to be, to misrepresent
llio intentions of the government and
the purposes of the northern people to
the South, ft is an unfair deduction of
the message and a false interpretation of
Mr. Johnson's future motives. In our
judgment, tlie President is explicit upon
every subject in the message, anil can be
easily understood by all fair-miude.l
critics. He recounts tlie advances that
have been nmde to induce tho south
ern people to return to their allegiance,
and then says—"it is not too much to
ask, in the name of the wholo people,
that, -A the one side, the plan of restor
ation shall proceed in conformity with
a willingness to cast the disorder of the
past in tIP oblivion; und that, on the
other, the evidence of sincerity in the
fiitiirn maintenance of the Union shall
lie put beyond any doubt by tho ratifi
cation of the proposed amendment to
the Constitution, which provides for the
abolition of slavery forever within the
limits of our country. So long as the,
tidoj.tion of this amendment is delayed,
along will doubt ami jealousy, and
'c.rtaintyprevail. This Is Ihe measure
icli will cflu-e Hie sad memory of the
past: this is the measure which will
most certainly call population, and cap
ital, and security lo those parts of
the Cnion -«_hiit need them most."
This, of itself, should be sufficient ex-
planation to those " soutliern niembers
of Congress " alluded to. But the Pres
ident goes oii.usif anticipating just such
crilicisni, and after observing that it in
not too much to ask of tho States which
are now resuming their places in the
family of the Union to give their pledge
of perpetual loyalty and peace, asserts
in a sentence full of moaning, that "un
til it i.s done, the past, however much
Wo may desire it, will not be forgotten."
No BUM could have addressed the sonth
«*rn feeling, the southern pride, or paid
inoro deference to the natural sen-
,le sihililies of a liefcated parly, with
er inure consideration than th*. Presi
li- dent has done, and it is unjust to deny
hi this merit in his message. Wo have no
*_. doubt, that "the southern members of
er Congress are disappointed;" hut we are
tv not induced to this belief because the
11, AY...,; says so; for it is the habit of that
>n journal to droit, southern grievances
•y when none exist, and inugnify common
political hardships of the South into
:icts of wilful and studied tyranny. The
'I admission of gentlemen from the South
>' into Congress is not the thing she needs
' H niosl. She needs capilal and labor just.
1, nosy, to develop.* her resources, much
'• Inure than she does the elevation or bro
il ferment of a parcel of bankrupt politi
n ciaiiH. It would have beta more iligni
" lied in the South to have been patient,
1 and mil to have struggled for the seats

copy of a coiiiiniinication, dated yester
day, sent to me hy D. de la Be.lolliero, v
Liftitenaiit in tin. French Marines, and .V
acting commander of the armed gnu- *

liiiinii'iition, officially take cognizance
ofthe following occurrences, which in- v
elude so many tlagranl violations in? the *
neutrality tvliieh (he Unite.l States have ti
oblij-aled themselves to keep in Mcxi- H
run allitirs. M
Uii si. That the Mexican steamboat B
Antonio, coming up the river with t*
Freiiel. troops on board, wus attacked en
from th,. Texas sliore without any pro- en
vocation whatever. Nor was this insult nt
to tl.e French and Mexican flags, which so
wen* both floating on the boat, in any
way punished. n „
Second. That the in-siegcrs of Mala- pa
morns, detached from their lines to at- Fr
t:ick, front Mexico, the said steaiiiboat, ju.
oraaaod Urn Rk* Grande under arms, rei
without any opposition being made by be.
the Americas authorities, officers, or
soldiers, from whom, on tlie contrary,
they received n hearty welcome.
Third. That, the samo bundits were
in tlirect communication with the
American steamboat Tampion during
the action. The relation of M. de la Be
dolliero is confirmed by the unequivocal
marks left on Iho Antonio by tlie pro
jectiles sent from tlie Texas shore.
Besides this, occurrances of tlie same
character have taken place iv the neigh
borhood of Matamoros during the stay
pf Ibe enemy. According to the daily
reports of the steamers Paisano and Ku
genia, n great number of persons, anion
whom could be distinguished the uni
focal of the United States and that pe
culiar to Corliiuls' robbers, occupy them
selves in insulting, and even throwing
stones from the city of Brownsville a!
Ihe troops which man said boats, and
thus in the presence of the American
officers and guards stationed on tlie bank
ol the river.
Such outrages, which cannot natural
ly ho explained, have been noted, and
relation of them will he transmitted to
tl.e Mexican Government and his Xx
cellency Marshal lla/.ttine, ill order that
they may decide upon the real character
of such actions. Accept, General, the
assurance of my consideration,

Ueneral: I have the honor to ac
kiuiwledge the receipt, of your commu
nication of the tith instant, and to say
in reply that you, as a soldier, must cer
tainly be aware that il, would require
all Hie cavalry of Europe and America
combined so to picket thin river as to
prevent single individuals from com
milting such outrages as Lieutenant de
la Bedolliero complains of, and that it
would not be just in you to hold me or
R_y Government responsible for acts of
such individuals. All that I can do is
tatty my tttmaat lo arrest the guilty
parlies; and dispose of them according
to instructions; and this I commenced
to do before 1 received your letter, and
as soon as I heard of the occurrence.
Tho soldiersoii theTampico were siak
and disabled men who were mustered
out, and were on tlieir way to their
homes. What crime there could have
been in comniuniculiiig with the Lib
eral. 1 cannot possibly understand.
1 hese sick and disabled soldiers had no
ammunition, and they certainly could
Mthem very little information,
c fact that tliero were bullet marks
on the starboard side of the Antonio does
not prove at ull that the shots were tired
from the American side, because, as you
must know,the Rio Grande is bo crook..!
anil has so many sharp turns that a boat
could be riddled on her starboard side
un.l still every shot he tired from the
Mexican shore. You crnnplnin that my
officers nnd men afllliate with the Libe
rals and welcome them. This is not
strange. The Libernls claim that they
light for their freedom. Tlieir cause,
then, is one that has awakened tlie
-asi-mcst sympathies in every American
breast. It wuul.l be as imi-nssible for
nic to prevent this, even if I felt so dis
posed, m it would bo to stop the motiou
ofthe earth. But T do not feel so dis
posed. Jiuriug our late war, tin* officers
and men of French and English men-of
war lying iv ports in our military pos
session alliliated continually and exclu
sively with our enemies at New Orleans
and Norfolk, and yet it was not thought
necessary to conimiinicnte with thorn on
the subject. They were permitted to
choose their.>wn associates.
1 base only heard of a single instance
when a mob of Mexicans threw stones
at your gunboats, and this mob was
promptly dispel,se.l by my guards.
I have never heard of ;isingle soldier
making insulting remarks, hut have
heard that Mexicans frequently make
them. 11 would be impossible for me to
stop this, because I have not the force to
spare for pickets, though 1 felt disposed
to do it; but I do not feel so disposed,
because ever since my arrival here you
have allowed a sheet,,pul.lished in Mata
nioros and printed in the English and
Spanish languages, daily to vilify and
insult the Government, the people, and
Ihe army ofthe United States; and this,
too, ufler your attention uud that of
Senor lioblos hud been called to it.
You, General, have no right to com
plain of my conduct during the recent
siege. 1 permitted the women and chil
dren to come over here from Matamoros,
meat to go over to your citizens who re
mained, grass for the cows of the same,
and wood to enable them to cook their
meals. Humanity required this. In
return I gave tho wounded Liherals
svho were helpless and destitute shelter,
medicines and food. I invariably did
this for my enemies. For whom have
I done the most? Is it not about an
Again yon promised to release Ameri
can citizens, after my demand was made,
Irom being pressed into military service
under you. Contrary to the treaty be
tween Mexico and the United States,
ami yet yesterday I heard of three that
were still held. I believe this to be en
tirely the fault of your subordinate offi
cers, and do not blame you for it.
Again, you have converted au Ameri
can steamer into a gun-boat aud hoisted
Hie Mexican (big on her, without first
buying her an.l changing her national
ity, according to law ; and against this

could undertake unything if they did
not have these continually renewed re
sources from Texas to sustain them.
1 will take the liberty to recall to your
memory how very different to what is
Passing here bus been the conduct of
France during Ihe recent war which has
just torn the American Union. France
remained loyally neutral, if it had
beeu otherwise, il we bad done the one
hundredth part- of what is being ilone
in BS-r-sißsvilleor on the banks of tin*
Rio Oraml., and the American people
woulS huvo'lbutlly protested And they
would have been right.
The international laws adopted by all
ci vilise.l .rations are obligatory upon all.
An they bound us in honor'to remain
neutral, bo do they bind you also; you
cannot nr. tend tfi be exempt from rubs
upon which yon have leaned under pre
text that they aro now useless.
After having presented to you, Gen
eral, the preceding o.sqivatio'ns, I close
my letter hy protesting in the most
formal manner aguiust tlie llagrent vio
lations of neutrality on this frontier
and particularly iv Brownsville,
Accept, General, the assurance of my

their welcome. General (Irani then
proceeded to the heudipiurlersof General
Sickles. Tlie evening was tho occasion
ot b demonstration by the colored cili

eight, hundred, gathered in procession,
with n Hug and a triangular Iruiisparcn '
cy bearing the words 'Union League
Number Oue,' and marched to tlie rekl
tlenee of General Sickles, iv Charlotte I
street.
General Grant came forward to the
railing of the portico of the -mansion,
and simply bowed his thanks.
At this momenta white man, Mr. Cof

I am requested by General Grunt b.
ret ii in his most heart fell thanks for this
spontaneous tribute of respect from llu*
loyal people of Charleston. He appre
ciate*) at ils just value tills compliment,,
this spontaneous ciuuiialion from (ho
loyal heart of South Carolina. | ( beers. J
I need not assure you that it is from no
lack of appreciation of your sentiments
the General does not appear in person In
make his acknowledgment.; but you all
know Unit he is a man nl deeds und not
of words. He has proved by his services
to bis couutry aud by his siicrill.es, that
he deserves this mark of your regard.
And i :im authorized by him to say (hat
