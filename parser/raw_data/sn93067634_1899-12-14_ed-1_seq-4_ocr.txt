followed by the respective appoint,

I t is deisir-able that Lico government

per-c-ddc by an administr-ation entirly

po(ses i recommiend that Congress pase
a law for then organizotion (of a tempor
ary government which shall provide
for Lice applointtiment by the President,
e.ubcject to confirmnation by the Senat,,
of a governuor and such other olli curs as
the general administration of the is
land may riequire and for legislative
piurposeis, on bubjects of a local nature
not plartaking of a Fe'deral character,
a legislative couincil, composed partly
of Porte lRicans and partly of cit'zons

miated and~ appointed by the President,
bscbject to confirmation by the Senate,
t heir acts to be subject to the approval
of the Congress or the President, prior
to going into effect.
in the municIpalities and other local
subdivisions, 1. recommend that the
plan oIf local self-government be applied
at once, so as to enable the intelligent
citizens of the island to participate In
their own government and to learn by
practical experience the duties and
rcquirements of a self-contained and
sell-governing people. I leave not
thought It wise to commit the entire
government of the islanid to olilcers
selected by the people, because I doubt
whether in habits, training and expe
rience they are such as to fit them to
exercise at once .so large a deore of
salf.-govunment,, but it, is my judg
ment and expectation that tiey will
soon 'attain an experience and wisdlomr
and self-control that will justify con
ferrincg upon themr a m'fdh larger'patr

LYNUCIING MUST UEAS.
What I said in 111Y inaugural address
of IVI arch 4, 1897, I now repeat.
' The cons.titutional authorities
should be cheerfully uphold. Lynch
Ings must not be tolerated in a great
and civilized country like the Un.ited
S3tates. Courts, not mjobs, must exe
cute the penalties of tile laws. Tuo
prov1ervation of public Ordelr, the right
of d:scusslon, the integrity of courts,
and the orderly administration of jus
tico must continue forever the rock of
safoty upon which our government so
Curely rests."

Lhe city of Washington oi the 21st of
Dhciibar, 1899, wnich, with tha con
nittee of the Congress and the District,
if Columbia, are charged with the
)roper conduct of the celebration.
C Ingress, at its last session, appro.
)riated $5,000 "to enable the chief on
,ineer of the army to continue the ex
imination of the subject and to make
>r securo designs, calculations and es
ilmates for' a nemoirial bridge from the
nost convenient point of ta. naval ob
ervatory ground or adjacent thereto,
6cross8 the I'Otoiac river to the most
onvenient point of the Arlington es
ato property.
in accordance with the provisions of
his act the chief of engineers has
elected four eminent bridge enginears
o sublit comupetitive designs for a
ridge combining the elements of
trcngtlh ahd Curability and such ar
hitecturai embellishments and orna
aentation as will fitly apply to the
edication, "A. memorial of American
oatriotism." Trhe designs are now ba
ng irepared and as soon as completed
eill be submitted to the Congress by
ecretary of war. The proposed bridge
iould be a convenience to all the peo
Ie fron every part of the country who
'isit the nationai cemetery, an orna

urever' stand as a monument to Amer

The 14th of December will be the one
undredith anniversary of the death of
Vashington. [For a hundred years the
epuilie has had the priceless advant
go of the lofty standard of character
,nd conduct, which he bequeathed to
ho American people. It is an inheri
ance which time, instead of wasting,
ontinuaily increases an enriches. We
nay justly hope that in the years to
omno the benignant influence of the

nore potent for good than in the cen

ave been glad to learn that in many
asrts of t'e country the people will
ttingly observe this historic annl

Poresented to this Congress are great

o us increases the weight of our obli

irofoundly sensitive to them as we

A GEORGIA TEMPERANCE~ STORY.
The Augusta Cnronicie says that
Judge E. M. Brinson tells a good story
>n himself, which illustrates how the
Willingham bill has been absorbing
atention in Atlanta. " I strolled into
the Senate chamber," said Judge Brin
Ron, " while in the capitol, thinking I
ould speak with some personal
friends there, and with no thought of
iscussing the pending bill. Recog
izing a former acquaintance I ac
osted him and shook hands, but soon
iscovered that he did not recall me,
Isaid, 'You don't remember who I am.~
This i. Brinson, of the Augusta cr
uit.' He had been in the Lcgislature
hen I was elected circuit judge and
ad voted for me, and I thought giv
lg him my name and circuit would
ecall to him my identity ; but he was
reoccupied with the Wiliingham bill,
and had evidently been beset by the
reachers, for just this moment anoth
r gentlemai came up and pointing
o my legislative friend, said to
the newcomer : ' This is Parson Birin
on : he rides the Augusta eircu it.' He
ad taken me for a Methodist preach
r on the Augusta circuit, and thought
Iwas there to argue with him in be
alf of prohibition." Nobody enjoys
he joke more than Judge Birinson
imself, and the story was so good
hat he promptly told it to the mom
ers of the bar on his return fromi
Alanta.
IBROUGHIT HIM TO TIM.-" Well,'
emarked the fond, but bashful young
an, rising at a late flour to go, " it
eems hardly worth while for me tc
stay any longer. We are not going to
ee any meteors tonight. It is a great
isappointment, but I have enjoyedI
the evening exceedingly in spit) of
hat. And there won't be another
treat shower like the one we have
is'ed seeing," he added, fingering
his tao " for 33 years I"
" Well," responded the maiden, look
ng dreamily out at the darkened
,kies, " if you'll come we'll sit up and
watch for that one, too."
Tben he put down his hat.
" Katie," he gasped, " do you think
['11 still be coming here us Ia am now
33 years from this time ?"
" It looks like it," she replied do
murely.
On which hint ho spake-and it was
still later when ho finally did go.
--A curious accident took place at
Brookfield, Ind. A local freight train
was bacoking into a siding to allow a
fast frieght to pass. The switch was
eft open, however, and the fast
freight, traveling at the rate of thirty
miles an hour, dashed into it. The
rews of both trains jumped. The im
act of the collision was so severe as
~o drive the tender of the stationary
rain off Its trucks, and telesco ping a
attle car which was loaded with coal,
t rested half on the top of the third
ar. On the fast froight a car loaded
ith hogs was telescoped by one
oaded with shelled corn and the anI
nals not killed in th< collision werec
mothered by the corn. It is said that
he locomotives are so interlocked
hat dynamite will be retquired to
apa rate them.
