WEEK
VOL. XI.
FN LA KG KM EXT.
About the first of January, or
sooner, shoultl material for the pur
pose be received before that time,
the Statesman will be greatly en
larged and many new features
added (o it. It is proposed to make
the Daily an eight-page, forty-two
column paper, quite as large as
many of the great metropolitan
dailies. This style of publication
will be adopted in preference,
lo the great uuwieldly page
so unsatisfactory to readers and ad
vertisers, and the paper will be pre
seuted in that convenient lorm,
which is now adoptctl by all the
great dalics of the country, because
it is universally approved. The ne
cessity for this change and improve
ment in the Statksman arises, first
in the fact that a paper, at the
capital of Texas, is required
to keep up with the de
mands of tho times; second, be
cause Austin progresses, and there
is every reason to believe that more
money and energy, thrown into the
publication of a paper here, will
meet with a hearty public response;
third, because there is a growing
demand for tho Statksman in all
portions of tho state, as well as be
yond tho limits of Texas, and to pub
Hsh what is demanded of a paper at
the capital requires more work upon
and more space within its columns ;
fourth, because railway facilities
are constantly increasing and thus
giving wider field to the circulation
of tho paper. These aro reasons,
justifying the enlargement of the
Statesman, and in finding oc
casion to tako this course,
tho proprietorship extends thanks,
especially to the good people
of Austin, whoso kindness to
the Statesman has ever been ap
preciated, and to whom wo look,
mere than to any others, for tliat
encouragement, w.hich leads to the
hope, that even this approach
ing enlargement is but a step in
an ascent that must coutiuuc to
mark the course of all that pertains
to Austin. Within the last eleven
years Austin has struggled up from
a little town to a magnificent city.
In that time tho Statesman has
progressed from a tri-wcekly to
a daily, the latter already twice
increased in size, and by the good
will of a generous people, it is
hoped to continue improvement
in future years. Again thaukiug
tho public for its support, wo prom
ise to show duo appreciation of the
fact that Austsn lias shaken oil its
lethargy and enters upon a new life.
Several strong lobbies arc or

A few Ohio mcu aro still left out

There is an original Filler He

And now it has been discovered
that the greatest living financier,

The government receipts during
November fell a liltlo 6hort of $30,-

duction of between $7,000,000 and
,000,000.
After nominating Freliughuysen
for secretary of state and Chauncy
1. Filley for postmaster general, it

A convention ot members ofboth
political parties, from various parts

The brewers of Cinciuati have
cfTectcd a secret organization. Prob
ably the high price of corn makes
glucose too expensive, and hence
they may prepare a cheaper com
pound. Doorkeeper Ckownlow, of the
House, has popped J. G. Popham,
a lleadjuster of Virginia, into a
place as assistant doorkeeper, in
charge of the document room. So
the articles of agreement arc being
carried out.
Jt is said Charles llccd, of Chi

The verdict of that jury, yester
day, caused a stir in certain quar
ters. More than one man, enjoying
tho condition ot double blessedness,
was iicant to pronounce it too
severe. Will any or the preachers
dare publicly endorse that verdict?
The New York Herald insists
that Mr. MacVcagh is still the attor
ney general of the United States,
despite the tact that ho placed his
resignation of the office in (he hands
of the president some weeks ago,
and cites an opinion of the supreme
court in a similar case to sustain its
views.
Nearly a million dollars saving
in the star route service is reported
for the month of November, but not
a dollar of restitution is reported or
contemplated to balance the awful
score which stands against the re
cord of the past twenty years, dur
ing which these Republican thieves
have been stealing millions through
the star route riug.
Congress bciug in session, aud
an appropriation for tho improve
ment of the Mississippi being talked
about, the railroads arc carrying
grain for Liverpool via New York
at the same rate as charged by the
river route. The west and the
southwest arc to be ho6dwiukcd,
probably, before a congress, ready
to be blindfolded at the iustigation
of the monopolists.
Ik Gniteau is found guilty of mur
der, Judge Cox will have tho author
ity, under the revised statutes of
the District of Columbia, to direct
that his body, after hanging until
he is dead, shall be delivered to a
surgeon for dissection. That is
nothing more than was assumed by
the doctors in the case of the dead
president. They haye portions of
his body pickled, in different
places, and some of his bones are
polished and mounted.
The report from the Indian na
tion is ili.it John Ross has been
elected by Hie Cherokee council at
Tah!eii:th as editor of I he Adrocate,
the official organ of the Cherokee
Indian-', vice E. C. Boudinot, jr.
Tho paper is sustained by appro
priations made by the council, the
editor receiving a salary of some
thing like $20,000 per year. The
change of editors causes some com
ment, as there arc two distinct fac
tions in the territ6ry struggling for
the supremacy, and distribution of
offices is a matter of much impor
tance there as in the states.
The Waco Examiner docs not
want to credit Mr. Mills with, oppo-
sion to improving tho mouth of the
Brazos river, because of Galveston's
opposition to any coast improve
ment, excepting ever as to its own
bar. Tho Statesman hopes,
though Mr. Mills has been op
posed to this measure, lhat he
will cease his opposition, since
all are agreed that an entry for large
sea going vessels may bo secured at
less expenso . at the mouth of the
Brazos river than anywhere else on
the Texas coast. When inside this
bar, loo, they may ride at anchor in
ono'of tho safest land locked har
bors of the world.
Judge JoiSn I). Townsend of
New Y'ork, whom Mr. Scovilic has
attempted to secure in tho defense
of Gniteau, has, it is said, declared
that all the existing proceed
ings should be set aside, on the
ground that a man claiming to be
insane should not have his life put
In jeopardy uutil a properly select

DEMOCRATIC STATESMAN
AUSTIN, TEXAS, THURSDAY, DECEMEMBEK 15, 1881.
"The Newspaper Man," better
known in Austin as Col. L. J. DuPre,
is before the public with a book
entitled "Fagots from the Camp
Fire." It is, as the author says in
his preface, a simple record of the
'woes, triumphs, modes of think
ing, living, fighting and dying of
scouts and common soldiers" in the
late wtr. It is therefore not
record of the achievements of gen
orals or presidents. The author re
cites "wild adventures, hideous
deaths and marvelous escapes," ter
rible aud ludicrous incidents, and
many things that, are as pitiful as
war may make. The author thinks
the record might be more tasteful
but therefore less truthful, and
hence, as he mav think, the
oue feature is not kept in view
to the exclusion of the other.
Uut the readcra ot this book will
not agree with the author that it
lacks taste, tor tastefulucss in
writing is possessed by few men to
a greater degree than by the gifted
writer. The book is on sale in this
city, or it may be ordered from the
publishers. Einilv Thornton Charles

copies 75 cents ; six compies $3.
To-day is Thursday. Are the peo
pic of Austin going to let the week
pass without providing for a confer
ence to be held with Col.Graut on the
subject of securing hi3 railway for
the capital city, thus making it the
center of a narrow gauge system of
railways ? The Austin aud North'
western, the Austin aud Southeast
ern, and tho Texas Western,
centering here, would lead the
Texas and St. Louis, and
other narrow gauge railways
to seek connection likewise at the
central point for these railroads.
The Cremond road, which, it is un
derstood, is to hold intimate rcla-
tions with the Texas Western, taps
oue of the richest lumber regions of
the world, and, should Grant's road
come to Austin, on its way to Fred
ericksburg, it would become the
greatest carrier of lumber of all the
Texas lines, for here it would be
called upon to supply the country
along the line ot the Austin and
Northwestern, as well as that about
the other roads named. -Are our

The Mormon question m con
gress promises to be a- lively one
Canton was elected by a large ma
jority, receiving 18,000 votes while
his opponent, Campbell, received
1300 votes. Campbell, backed by tho
governor of Utah aud the United
States district court, claims that
Cannon is not a citizen, and there
fore is ineligible. Having a majori
tv of the votes cast, whether
lawful or not, the clerk has placed
Cannon's name on the roll, and it
remains for congress to decide the
question of ineligibility. It will
certainly be decided in strict accor
dance with what the Republicans
think they can make out of an alli
ance with Mormonisin. Whether
Campbell be a good Republican
or not will avail him nothing,
effect him nothing, unless he
have some new element of
strength to lav at the fect of
the accrctiouary party. As Cannon
can command the Mormon strength
he will bo well considered, at least,
aud his acceptance or rejection will
depcud more directly upon tho ex
pediency or inexpediency of an alli
ance, than upou principle. Right or
law will be tho last consideration
claiming attention from this con
gress. Tho la iv appears to be in
favor of the anti-Mormon, but law,
and personal and society rights are
rejected when Republicans may se
cure a point in the advancement of
of their party principles and prac
tices.
The death of the late amiable and
accomplished Nicholas J. Moore
was not only a sad bereavement to
his itmncdiato family and friends,
but also a public calamity. His far-
seeing vision anticipated In the not
far distant future large and flour
ishing cities at the termini of all our
railroads on the gulf, ami he was
devoted to Texas in all her great
undertakings. Whiie, as a south
erner, he was proud of New Or
leans, the Queen City of the south
ho yet believed that Texas would
soon have ports of entry on her ex
tensive coast, open to the commerce
of the world, which would draw di
rectly to them all the productions of
our great state. He was particnlarly
devotcd to the development of Sa
bine Pass ns a great port of entry,
and was a warm advocate of the
Sabine and AVestcrn railroad, know
ing that It would be the shortest
and cheapest route from Sabine
City to the flourishing city of
Houston, and that it would connect
cast Texas directly with the richest
and most productive parts of the
state. He was thoroughly identified
with this road before his death, and,
it is said, was soon to become one
of its directors. All who live must
die; but, while mourning for one so
gentle, so mild and kiud,so noble and
magnanimous, cut off in the vigor
of manhood by an untimely death,
we do sincerely trust that this, his
favorite scheme, the railway from
Sabino to Houston, thence into
western Texas, will be speedily
built. The development of Texas
is the leading thought of these old
Texans ; and, when we reflect that
they are rapidly passing from these
active scenes, so pleasing to them as
patriots, it makes us sad. Texas is
to become the greatest of states, aud
those who devote their time and
money and life to her best interests,
as did this lamented gentleman,
will have everlasting monuments
erected to their memory in the
hearts of the people of Texas.

What a magnificent navy this
great nation has quite as magnifi
cent as the Sir Joseph who was
placed in charge of it by the "mar
tyred" presideut. The distinguished
" commander of tho Queen's Navic
has just made his annual report, such
as it is, in which he says that the con
dition of the navy really demands
the prompt and earnest attention of
congress. Calls, Sir Joseph say
are made upon the department to
send vessels into diti'ereul parts of
the world in order to prevent threat
ened aggression upou the rights of
American citizens, and to shield
them in time of civic commotion in
forcigu lands from iusult or per
sonal indignity, but that it proved
impossible to respond to these calls
from the want of vessels. He thinks
it wise to present to congress a
scheme entitled lo the approbation
of congress, calling for appropriate
means to carry out systematic sur
veys of parts of the West Indies,
the Spanish Main and the coasts of
Mexico aud Central America, as well
as the examination of reported
shoals and rocks in the Atlantic
and -acific oceans. Here the
"commander" rests, to await
the plaudits of his admiring
countrymen. He wants the broad
oceans and gulfs cleared for the
free exercise of his war vessels
without females, ot course.
Last Sunday Rev. T. B. Lee
preached a most remarkable sermon
from the text: "That our sons may
grow up as the young plants: and
that our daughters may be as the
polished corners of the temple,"
therein making a direct attack upou
the present practices of young peo
pie, and showing how morality
among them may be destroyed and
society degraded. Several voung
men who listened to the sermon
highly approve of tho worthy minis
ter's utterances, aud having made
the request that it be printed in the
columns of the Statesman a copy
of the sermon has been obtained,
and upon examination, we must be
allowed to express the greatest
pleasure in complying with the
request. The Statesman will pub
lish the sermon, because it is direct
ed at an evel that; saps, no matter
how near home it may go to the
hearts of even some of our
readers, the happiness of many
home circles. That Mr. Lee makes
a departure, for a time, from paint
ing the glory and goodness ot the
Maker, to show how people can be
made purer aud nobler, is a
matter of public congratulation ;
aud, if the ministry generally would
do likewise, there would be more
people drawn within the church
doors. But we say this much in ap
proval of the sermon, and reserve it
for publication next Sunday. Its
perusal must do a vast deal of good,
aud this, above all things, is one of
the chief aims of the Statesman's
existence.
It is Ex-Spcakcr Randall's opin
iou that a three per cent, fund ing
bill will be strouglv urged mi the
house, and there is no reason why
such a bill should not be made a
law. The proposed bill will be based
on the refunding measure that was
vetoed during the last session. The
fourth scctiou of-thc vetoed bill au
thorized the secretary of the troas
ury to use $50,000,000 of tho gold
and silver coin in the treasury for the
redemption of the 5 and G pec tent
bonds, which hare since been con
verted into bonds bcariug 8J per
cent., and also to apply so much of
the surplus money in tho treasury
as he might deem necessary, to the
purchase aud redemption of interest-
bearing bouds and certificates. Mr.
Randall proposed to substitute for
this, a section declaring that an
amount not exceeding 25 per cent.
of the outstanding United States
notes, shall be retained in the treas
ury as a reserve, ami thatlhc money
in the treasury in excess of that
amount, shall be applied to the
purchase of interest-bearing bonds.
The effect of such a provision,
Mr. Randall claims, would be to re
lease $100,000,000 now held for the
purpose of maintaining United
States notes at par. The fifth see
lion ol the vetoed bill, which provid
ed that three per cent. bonds should
bo the only bonds receivable as se
curity for biuk circulation, and that
national banks surrendering circu
lalion, or going into liquidation,
should surrender their own notes as
a condition precedent, to the return
of their bonds held to secure circu
lation, is to be included in the pro
posed bill. -
The New York tariff convention
did not agree to the resolutions re
lating to the taxes on whisky and
tobacco. The resolutions ns adopt

siicn revision ot the tariff laws as
will give full and harmonious effect
to the protection policy by a civilian

upon congress the importance of

The Art Amateur. Subscri
bers to art periodicals are naturally
desirous of selecting the best. Each
has its merits, but "The Art Ama
teur" is of the highest practical value
to students and amateurs. Its large
size enables the publisher to give
not only pictures, but an abundance
of working drawings, which, with
the simple directions which accom
pany them, arc easily applied. In
the current (December) number, for
instance, there arc no less than four
teen pages of practical designs for
cuina painting, wood carving, art
needlework, painting ou silk, "etch
ing" on linen, etc., etc. The much
esteemed designs of Camillc Pilon
are contributed exclusively to "The
Art Amateur." These have included
sets of large and small plates : hisrh
ly decorative plaques of heads, birds
and flowcrspancls for screens and
furniture ; aud even a complete fac
ing tor a mantel, consisting of
eighteen full size tiles. George R.
Halm and others will continue to
furnish designs for menus, ball pro
grammes, fans, kettle-drum cards
etc., etc., aud leading artists will
contribute original designs tor la
dies' dress. The suggestion for
home decoration will be especially
valuable. The price of "The Art
Amateur" is 35 cents monthly, or $4
a year. Club rates: Two subscrip
tions, $7: three subscriptions, $10
four subscriptions, $12. Each addi
tional subscription, $3. Montague

A wide-awake citizen of Austin
writes a note to the Statesman, ap
proving its suggestions about con
fcrriug at once with Colonel Grant
in regard to tho building of his road
to Austin. Ho thinks action should
be taken at once, and, to this end
we again urge a citizens' meeting,
to be held not later than the end of
this week, to consider propositions
to be made to the managers of the
Texas Western. Colonel Grant is
now in Houston, preparing for ac
tive work along the proposed line
of the road. It is intended that the
road shall strike the Colorado river
at LaG range, whence it is now
intended it shall proceed towards
Fredericksburg, up the west side of
the Colorado river. Whv this road
should not bo secured to Austin we
can not see, and if the proper steps
arc taken in this connection, it is
confidently believed it will be. A
citizens' meeting is the lirst step in
this direction, aud there must be no
delay about it.
Hon. Randolph C. Doom died at
his residence in Jasper county on
the 5th instant. Colonel Doom was
one of the earliest settlers of Texas
aud engaged in its struggle for in
dependence, and has several times
held important public position. He
was a member of the congress of
Texas, aud was afterwards, more
than once, sent to the state legislature
to represent a constituency, conlid
ing implicitly in his ability and in
tegrity as a lawgiver. One by one
these old patriots have dropped from
the roll until their ranks have been
thinned to a bare haudful of men
One by one they have passed away,
while Texas, growing great upou
the basis of their achievements, rears
a generation, blessing them in mem
ory for so long ago giving to civili
zation ouo of the brightest and
fairest of lauds. They made for
Texas its heroic period, aud would
it not be well to rear a monument
in the new capitol to their memory,
giving the roll as it appeared when
yonng aud brave hearts battled,
long ago, for a couutry's freedom?
The .Vera ami 1'ost are quarrel
ing over the point as to how much
of the president's message each pa
per prjnted on the morning follow
ing iu delivery. The fact is, the
yew ought to have contained the
entire message on the morning of
the 7ih, for the telegraph office iu
Galveston received a great portion
of it in the afternoon, on Tuesday.
Had tho wires been opened for such
early delivery at Austin as at Gal
veston and Houston, the States
man of Wednesday would have con
taincd the entire message. As it
was, the transmission of the mes
sage was not begun at Austin until
night, and, though the Statesman
was held open until six and a half
o'clock a. m., the entire text had not
then been sent over the wires,
Had the Statesman been permitted
to have a portion of the message
as early as it was received in Gal
veston, there would have been no
trouble about the entire copy being
delivered in time to have been set
in type for the Wednesday's pa
per. It was not the fault of the
Austin office of the Western Union
company, but a result of this out
rageous discrimination, perpetually
practiced against the interior pa
pers. Owing, however, to the ex
cellent service of the Austin office,
on Tuesday night, the Statesman
was enabled to print more of the
message on Wednesday morning
than any other paper in Texas ex
cepting the Post.
A. B. Norton, of unshorn locks
fame, does not want ex-Governor
Davis in the cabinet. The States

the promotion of Mr. Davis, but,
when this man Norton, who was em

is thus heard from, it will raise the
ex-Governor in the estimation of
many people.

The president would have the
tribal relations of the Indians
broken up, since they are the great
est barrier to the inroads of civiliza
tion. He would have them settled
iu several ty, and would subject the
inhabitants of territories to the laws
of adjacent states, thus giving the
Red Man the right of citizen
ship. He wauts Indian schools
established, and a systematic
elevation of these aboriginal tribes
resorted to. These things appear
good enough, and the way to con
vince the country of the wisdom of
these suggestions is to put them iu
force. It has been proven that the
Indian can be civilized, but the way
to do this is to place him directly
under the supervision of the white
man and of law, aud not temporize
with him as to the modes or means
of putting him there.

German Social Democracy fell
off in its voting strength very con
siderably at the. recent elections in
Saxony, where its stronghold used
to be. Ten years ago there were in
Saxony 37,124 Social Democrats en
titled to vote. Three years later
there were 92,180, aud in three more
years they had risen in number to
123.978. The maximum point was
reached in 1878, when they polled
128,039 votes. At the recent elec
tions they numbered only 87,700
fewer than at any time since before
1874.

Fkom the report of Postmaster
General James, it appears that there
was a deficiency in the revenue of
his department, for the last fiscal
year, of $2,600,000. . By the closo of
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1883,
it is estimated that the annual defi
ciency can be reduced to $920,000 in
round numbers, and that should the
increase in revenue be 10.4 per cent.,
as was the case last year, instead of
8 per cent., as calculated in the esti
mate, then the postal service would
become self-supporting.

The president finds his way into
that very pretty trap, set by the pro
tectionists to maintain high import
duties. He is strongly iu favor of
abolishing internal taxes. The con
cession appears good to the casual
observer, but what is the use of re
ducing so much in one quarter when
by doing so a favored class will find
therein necessity for a little greater
import duty to force consumers to
buy their products af higher prices.
The St. Louis Republican says :
"The Republicans of Texas are

state. As it is, the Texas Republi
cans arc only heard of when there
is a change in some of the offices,
present or prospective, to bring
them to the surface."
Congress has the opportunity,
now, to meet the question of polyg
amy with that opposition demanded
for it. It is a disgrace to the gov

be refused the scat in congress on
the same ground upon which the
governor of Utah refused him the
certificate.
It begins to appear as though

Tns Mormons claim that they
will control congress, if not other
wise; through the agency of ample
funds at their command, and now
we will see how the Mormon dele
gate question will bo decided. Can
non, the Mormon apostle aud po
lygamist, has been a delegate from
Utah eight years. In the forty-third
congress Republicans and Demo
crats insisted that as Cannou held
the governor's certificate it was
sufficiently demonstrated that he
was the legally elected delegate.
Campbell holds Gov. Murray's cer
tificate, and, according to the prece
dent established when Cannou first
applied for a seat, Campbell thould
be admitted. Gov. Murray gave
Campbell tho certificate, although
he did not receive the highest num
ber of votes, because Cannou was
discovered to be an alieu, and was
consequently ineligible. The Mor
mons claim that they can control
congress, and intimate that they
have a corruption fund sufficiently
large to do it. Certainly no mem
ber of congress can afford, under
the circumstances and the law bcar
iug on the case, to become the sup
porter of Cannou and thus the de
fender of Mormonism.
The drain of emigration from
Germany to the United States is so
heavy that the imperial government
proposes shortly to introduce into
tho reichstag stringeut measures to
prevent the capital and men of the
country from leaving it. During
the present year over 200,000 Ger
mans left the fatherland for the
United States. How a government
may exercise power to prevent its
people from emigrating to other
countries is to be seen. It is a pro
posed assumption ' of monarchy
more dangerous than Bismarck may
presume it to be.

THE HUNTINQTON-GOULD AGREE
MENT. .
Chicago. Regarding the recent
agreement between the southern
Pacific and tho Texas and Pacific,
the last issue of the Chicago Hail-
way Gazette says: "The agreement,
lo which reference nas heretofore
been made, has been signed by C
P. Huntington and Jay Gould, rep
resenting the two companies. Une
contract, which is simply a traffic
agreement, provides that the tracks
of both the Gould and Huntington
systems shall be joined about eighty
miles east of El Paso, that branch,
as well as others, to be jointly
operated, the Texas and Pacific
paying one-half the cost of con
struction and maintenance, and re
ceiving one-half the receipts.
Through business is to be done on a
pro rata basis to San Diego, Los
Angeles and San Francisco. On the
completion of the Huntington road
through Texas, the seaboard or gulf
business is to be equally divided be
tween the two systems. In consid
eration of the privileges mentioned,
as well as others of less .import, the
Texas and Pacific road relinquishes
to the Southern Pacific Us claims to
land grants, right-of-way and fran
chises west ot El Paso. The first
named road agrees not to extend its
track weBt of El Paso, and the
Southern Pacific agrees not to par
allel it east of that ;point. Any dis
putes are to be settled by arbitration."

bable death with trcmnlous voice,
are not heard in the hotels, In Hie
streets or in the departments. His
sun has set, and the fitful worship

for every ruler of the present and
contempt for every ruler of the past,
now speak of Arthur as the saviour

Kirkwood will be unknown in and
about the administration twenty
days hence, and it is now probable
that even Lincoln will not survive
the general wreck of the policy
upon which Garfield laid the foun
dations of his administration. In
the selection of the successors or .
the Garfield cabinet, no Garfield
man will apply. Democrats will be
generously considered by the new
administration when necessary, but
the Garfield Republican will be a
stranger to the faver of tho Arthur
reign."
