clwcfl io-,la\ aomewhat unexpectedly, making
ele?! the ?;-?? : that the smsann'a cam he?completely
brolo u down.
Toabou tl troth of this it will only bo necessary
to recapitulate the fart-* conoerning the ex
porli simuliteli.I in tli?' wee, end the timid nae
which the d< fence b te dare 1 to maki of them. The
experts summoned for the defence were Dr. Pllnj
Berle, of Northampton. Mae?.; Dr. I>. D. Richard
Km, of th? City Aeylum of Philadelphia! Dr. Beiden
H. Teleott, of the New Te
Aaylam, al sfiddlotownj Dr. Theo?] ire Dimon, late
of the Criminal Aeylnm, al Auburn, N. V.. und Dr.
?. G. fjtoarna, of Hartford. ? he defence did not pal
; ny one of thoM gentlemen OB I be -tami, the reason
hetng well understood to be that they bad, after
hearing Guiteeu's own testimony,
reyed a plain Intimation to the defence
that their evidence would not be advantageous it>
theaeseesin, Dr. Earlo,who i* advanced in
has .'one home rick, bot moot, ?1 not II, of ti se ex?
pert* wh<> ?ven- converted, ehieflr by G dtean liim
s??!'. int.? a beliof in bis responsibility, wen? .it once
cited to appear m witnesses for the Government.
The defence ????1 pieos upon the stead eight ? xperte.
The only one of them who seemed reedy to give
tbem any real hi 1 f? was yoang Dr. Kiern in, of Chi?
cago, lad little whs I? ft of his testimony for Jury
jiurp.ises when he sseerged from the box. TheotiM ?
experts beard oa Monday, Die. Niehol?, Folaom,
Woreeeter, Godding IfcBride, Channing and
Fisher, simply teetined in response t<> the
hypothetieal case put bj lir. Beoville,
Botoaeof them was asked whether be eoi
the prisoner r. sponalbla f.ir bis .??; i. and not one of
these was asked whet conclusions he srriTed at m
Lis tTamJnettffftf Of th? prisoner.
The defence has, therefore, closed without the ex
?reeseon ed an opinion by any alienist thai G
is beeaaable <>f distingnishiag between right and
wrong and of controlling bis actions; or, in othei
words, practically without expert sopper? foi the
theory of insanity. <>:, the other hand the Govern
?seat retain? not only all ite own experts, bui will
have the added beaeflt of the teetimony of the ex
Bert?, who have boon driven l>y the ? \ ni em
to the side of the prosecution. Four o? the experts
esJk^ for the Government have bees m sttendance
?mee the trial. These are Dr. John P. Gre;
l'tiea Insane Asylum ; Dr. A. K. Meodoaald, of the
New-York City Asvluiii, Ward's Island; I>r. Waiter
Kempoter, of the Wiocpaaia state Asyl
Q. H, Calender, ci thn XeB-aeesM fftate Aty'nuj at
Nashville. Other experte present fur the Govern
ment are Dr. Bsnaotph Berkedalo. of the Virginia
Asylum, al Blebmond ; Dr. Allan M Lane Hamilton,
ot New-York, one of the Consulting Board of the
Itate Asylum at Ponghkeepsie, and al o of the I >i\
Asylum: Dr. ?. (>. Kellogg, of the Pouah
Asylum, and Dr. A. M. Shew, of the liiddli
Aeylnm, Conn. All these expert? are expected to lake
strong ground fox the theory thai tbeprisoner i*
leeponeible, and the tostimoB] of some of the most
distinguimeli of them ?el, it i- said by their
fjIrada, be <>i the most positive eharacb r.
One ?if the Government exporte to-day, in speak
hg of Gutteaa, would net even admil that be had
any mental <lis oder. This gentleman would only
say that the sasaesifl had not " one of the beet kind
of ?nimis." He also expressed the belie! that muol
of the boieteroue behavior of the prieoner in Court
wat far the penfaose of rlmelettng insanity, and
?ani that u bad been a marked character?
istic of his demeanor that he was quiet
whenever the testimony was given in his
favor, hut beeeaae noisy whenever ii tended
to injure him. TheGovernment expert? are look?
m? forward to a very thorough examination of the
Whole question of re';?>oiis?hi?ty lor erin.e. They
feel the neeeosity for obtaining all the Ughi which
one he shed upon the subject of reeponsibility. It
will ?eobablydo torn* time, however, before thej
gee beard.

Rend the case to the jury Butler what is
oxpeeted to be an overwhelming weight of expert
testimoni? One of the experte said to-day thai he
thought they wonld not be called for a wick, and
that their testimony would occupy a week. At this
ra'e. With the possibility tif eolisiil^!;ili!e lestiimmy

An appalling calamity has befallen tbe American
inopie since their ehoaeu Represent itives last met
m the halls when.' you are now assembled. We
might else recall with unalloyed coni? nt the raro
proeperity with which throughout the year the
Naiion has been bleoeei. It? Battereste have Leen
plenteous. Its varied IndnstriM baye tin Irt a?? the
health of it- peonie has been preserved, >t b*? natte*

nlationa of amity and peace. For theee manifesta?
tions of His favor weowe to Him who beide our
deatiny in Hi? banda tbe tribnteof our graMfal sie*
votions. Io that mysterious exercise ol His will
which his taken from us the loved and illustrious
citizen who wm bet lately the beadol the Nation
we bow m Borrow and mbtaiasion. The ntemoi r of
hi-, exalted character, of his noble aebievemente
ami ol his patriotic life will be treasured fore ver M
asocted possession of tbe whole people. The an*
nonncemenl of hi? deatti drew from ?foreign Cov
ernmente and peoples tributes of aymi it by anal
sorrow which history will record as signal tokens of
tne kinship of nations ami the federation of man?

FOHKKiN RELATIONS.
The feeling of good Will betnei ? oar on a Govern?

marked than at present. In rnoagaition af this
pleasing tact 1 directed on the oeoneiea of the late
Centenaial wlebratioa at fot klon d that a aalatsghai

tbe proposed canal acroM the Isthmus ot PaeaaM?
little has occurred worthy of uie.it ton in the iiiplo
matic relations of tbe two eountrii -, Early in the
year the Fortune bay dann wen Mti-iactonly
settled, by tbe British Government paying la full
the su in of ?15,000, most of which has beeu already
distributed. As the terms of the aettlement In*
eluded louipcii-ation tor injuries suttereil by our

from the press award a stun which is deemed ade?
quate for those claim?. The particip itimi of Arnesi?

two exhibit ions, soon to be presented to ('"iitrress.

to make Mn ets-fiil competition in MUtant tidilsof

has always existed between the two nations.
Von will be furnished with the proceedings of the
bimetallic C inference hold during the summer at
th.? City ofi'ans. No accord wan re;u:he?l. but a
yaluable it tenhange of views was hail, and the
Conference will next year he renewed. At the
Electrical Exhibition and Congress, aI?o held at
l'arie, this country was creditably represented by
?minent specialists, who. in the absence of an ap?
propriation, Mnsrensly lent their efncienl aid at
the instance of the State Uepattuieiit. While our
exhibitors tu tin, almost distinctively American
lieh! of achievement have won several valuable
awards, I reoonuaend that Congress provili?? lor the
repayment of the personal expense- incurred, in
the public ?nl. rest, by the Hotioiary Commissioner*
and Deli itates.
No new qaesthina ?espseting the stains of our
natoralised citizens in Gscanaay bare arisen 'luring
the year, and causes of complaint, cspeciajly in
Alases ami Lorraine, have practically tvased
?h tin? liberal action of the Imperial (?overn
itient in accepting oar often exnraoMd views on the
Kiibjeet. The application ol thu l'teaty of l*tps tO
the lately aequirad Kheuish Provinces has received
very earnest attention, and a defluite and la-ting
agreement on this point is confidently expected.
Tne participation, af the descendants of Baron van
Btoaben in the Vorktown festivi tics ami their aub
sequent reosptioa by their American kinsmen
strikingly evinced the ties of goodwill which unite
the Gemon people and our own.
Our intercourse With Spain has been friendly.
An agreement concluded m February last fixes?
term for the labor? of the Spanish and American
Claims Coininisbion. Tho Spanish (internment ha*
been requested to pay the lat?? awards of that Com
mission, and will.it is believed, accede to the n
quest as prom p: I y and courteously us on former oc?
casions. Hv recent legislation, onerous lines have
been Imposed ou American shipping m .Spanish and
Colonial ports for .?light irregularities in manifesta.
One case ol hardship is worthy of attention. The
bark Masonic, bound tor .Japan, entered Manilla in

that the whole matter will bo adjust?^ in a friendly

The Senile ?es.dutions of condolence on the

propriately communicated to tbe Russian Gaietm

our lati National bercavomeut. It Is deaerarne that
our cortlial ielatious with Kuseia should Isa
strengtheiie.l by proper engagements, assuring to
peaceable Americane who vieit the Empire the
consideration winch is due to them a-c ii/.en . of a
friendly State. This is especially needful with
