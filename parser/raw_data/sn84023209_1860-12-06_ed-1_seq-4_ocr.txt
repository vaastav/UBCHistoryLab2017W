steadily increasing.
No Time to Take the Back Track.
The flurry cf the fire eaters, and general rage
of defeated politicians, is making quite a lively
time among sensation newspapers and political
demagogues, to allay which the people of tho
North are heseeched to repeal their Personal
Liberty Bills, and tho President to announco
his policy and Cabinet ; all of which will, in
due time, be found to be of no avail, and a
mere piece of nonsense. Abraham Lincoln is
not going to assume any of tho functions of
President until the fourth of next March, and
those whosupposo that the yeopleof the North
are going to bo frightened by a few Southern
demagogues, are entirely mistaken.
Tho Republicans mean just what they say,
that there shall be no farther extension of Slave
ry on this Continent, and that nil constitutional,
means shall be used to get rid of it where it
now exists. And this is the true policy. For
any Republican to arguo in favor of repealing
our stringent laws for the protection of tho lib
erties ot the people, or for a better disposition
on our part to give up fugitives, or to pay for
such as escape, is the biggest piece of folly ira-
The Republican party has no fear of disunion
threats. Southern revolvers and bowie-knives
have no terror lor their hearts. Slavery is fast
disappearing from tho more Northern of the
slave States, and the preponderance of free
States, and the power of the free over the slave
States, will forever prevent any material
enlargement of slave territory. And this is
as it should be. It is the natural effect of
prosperity, and the progress of our Republican
Government.
We do not propose any raid upon the South,
nor its peculiar institution, but we propose to
eut them off from the continual fostering care
of the Federal Treasury, and its influence in
their behalf. We mean to make them take caro
of their own institution, and if by our letting
it alone it cannot live, but will inevitably sting
itself to death, why, God be praised.
At present the object of the Republican par
ty is to restore the Government to the policy of
its founders, trusting that, under heaven, a
way may be oponed lor a gradual emancipation
of human bondage. In Slavery is not the nat
ural condition oi tho African, nor is it a mark
f Christianity for the white people to hold
thorn there.
There re those who aro more or less frigh
tened at the attempt at a panic, and a dissolu
tion of the Union, and who are deeming it best
to fall back a stop or two, and givo up our
Anti-Slavery notions, renouncing all opposition
to Slavery, and thus quiet tho bragadocio tf a
few hundred unprincipled slave-holders. Rut
we aro not of that number. If thera are any
who went into the fight without counting the
cost, or wanting in courage, we are sorry ; but
rally, when the battle is fought, and wo have
the enemy in our hand, it is no time to retreat.
Disunion cannot be of serious disadvantage to
the North, as is proposed by the South to bring
it a'uit, nir in!i);-j any feu that an attemp
at disunion would last over the length of time
that poor, misguided John Brown held Har
pers' Ferry. Let no Republican utter a word
of despondenuy, throw no wet blanket upon
tho praiseworthy enterprise, but encourage our
Senators and Members of Congress with a lirm
maintenance of the ,rinciples which have led
m to victory, and a God speed to their duty.
Amkn, Hit o:t Miss. This remark said to
havo loeu made by an over ardent hearer, who
didn't exactly understand the pith of what was
going on, is well illustrated in the closing of
the S-ntind's remarks upjn the Legislature :
Thank God ! people of Vermont. They
havn't done much honor and no good '! Would
that this body might not meet again in live
years. '
If the junior will read this, he will see that
he must have been uleetle in the " f," to be
akinr the people of Vermont to thank God
that the Legislature has not " done much hon
nr and no good.'
Jjoith Haudwick Acadusiv. A correspond
ent sends us a sketch of the proceedings at the
Inhibition at Soath Ilarkwick Academy, on
the 20th ult,, which shows the teliool in a very
ll turishing e rudition, but fio crowded statu if
our columns prevents i's publication.
The effort which was made in the Vermont
legislature to repeal the Personal Liberty Law
failed. Therj won fifty-eight votes in favor of
repal to one hundred and twenty-five opposed,
in the Ilouso. As tho Democrat strength is
but twenty-five, it follows that at least thirty
threc Republicans voted for repeal.
Growing Interest in Agriculture.
We are glad to notice the good effect which
the efficient discussion upon Agricultural mat
ters by tho Legislature is having upon the pea
pie ot the State. Before we saw scarcely an
item of Agriculturaljintelligenco in our State
papern, where now tho correspondents are de
manding an ample space. Noarly every cor
respondent gives us his approval of the interest
the Fkkehan has taken in tho matter, and as
sures us of the appreciation of the farmers.
When their attention is callod to the matter,
our farmors readily admit the want of system
and general intelligence in relation to modern
improvements and exparimouU, and see the
growing demand for a Intter dissemination and
understanding of the proper application of la
bor and manures. The Fiiekhax was the pio
neer in this discussion, and well is it being ro
paid for its labor. The addition of tho number
of names of substantial farmers to its lift of
subscribers, is ulroady surprising; to us. There
is, however, one thing lacking. E ich farmer
has soma peculiar theory ,vnmo plan which he
has proved most bonclieiul, which he should
take pleasure during the quiet of the coming
winter to furnish for publication. This is ab
solutely necessary for the success of the under
taking now begun, and for tin successful in
augoration of a system ol operations for the
improvement of Agriculture.
One other object is the formation of Clubs,
Farmers' Clubs with stated meetings and dis"
cussions, and the appointment of committees to
prepare essays and reports upon the condition
and cultivation of the different crops, reclaim
ing of swamps and worn out lands, composting
of-manures, the gathering of statistics, and a
general inquiring into the cost and product of
certain operations that may havo boen going on
in any particular section during the past sea
son. There may bo thought to bo a difficulty
in forming these Clubs, but let one neighbor
suggost it to another, and ho to a third, that
they havo a meeting at the center school house,
town house, gr otherwhere, and give out word
that such andsuoh mon are to be called on, and
expected to give thoir experience in certain
measures in whioh they havo been successful
In a very short time the place of meeting will
bo filled. Don't exclude the ladies, nor pass
thcin in silence. Household duties have a very
proper place in the Club, aud if household
economy eould have its share of attontion, it
would be worth a mint of money to tho State.
As the snow disappears in spring and the busy
season approaches, let it bo arranged that a
system of experiments touching different sub
jects upon which there is a diversity of opinion,
should be had by eeveral persons, and that their
report shall be made at the coming meetings of
the Club. Farmers of Vermont, what say yon,
shall the editor bo aided in making an Agricul
tural paper, or not T
From Italy.
European advices inform us that Garibaldi
has achieved the victories of his ambition and
retired to private life, an act which cannot be
undervalued. In a career so short and brilliant
ho has won a name which will never die. A
f?A ti.nes in ancient history, and but once or
twico in modern ages, have we beheld such inng
niinity. It was thought to be wclldoncby Lou
is Napoleon when, having jointly with Visitor
Emmanuel won Lombard)' from Austrian power,
he released his interest in thj province to li s
royal partner ia the enterprise. 15 it tho king
dom of Naples is m ire truly Garibaldi's than
L'.imburdy was Louis Napok'on's. lie has con
quered it alijno, almost lit 'rally, and the hour Im
of the pjopl.i are niven to him in return. Had
he puss-! sod the ordinary ambition of the world,
with perfect ease he could havo so turned affairs
that tho people of Naples would have suffered
no other ruler than Garibaldi to lake the place
of tho tyrant whom he had so miraculously driv
en out. Hot from the beginning to the end of
his great emancipation, he steadily kept be fore
iho ryes uf all his followers the declaration I hat
what hu was sowing in toil and bloodshed, Vic
tor Emmanuel was to reap in peace and author
ity iho good uf tho Italian people being the
solo object of his inis-don.
lie has, therefore, embraced the firat oppor
tunity to redeem his promise. Though the
King of Naples still holds G iota, his retirement
or his capture ia certain, and the people have
formally decreed annexation to Sardinia. All
tho work of deliverance is done that ct bo done
now, and so Garibaldi retires to his little island
homo off the coast of Sardinia. But ho imi
mates that his withdrawal is but for a time.
By next ppring, lie tells his companions in arms,
that an army of a million of men will be want.
ed to follow him again to fresh conflict. Wheth
er Venetia, in spite of i's fatuous quadrang'c,
is thou to undergo what Naples lias experienced
d irin.5 tu's season, or whether Hungary is tu
ri', and Austria is to h assailed and Italy en
larged by a base of operations in that quarter,
it were useless now to pp. ealatc. We can only
say ihat the noble man who has achieved so
much by his daring and also by his disinterest
edness, has given a sufficient guaranty tliat he
will bo equal to any task which fate may havo
in reserve for liiin. In the meantime tr.nv peacs
and happiness be his.
Mr. Lincoln, President elect, has been on a

carefully avoiding political topics, however.
The Grand Besnlt.
Our dispatches from California at length
enable us to present tho grand result of the
Presidential election of I860. With respect to
two or three States thire is not yet complete
certainty, and pjrhaps will not bo until the
official returns are puhlished. Virginia un
doubtedly has a small plurality lor Bell. Mis
souri is n.it yet all in, but there appears to us
to ba no doubt that she goes for Douglas by a
plurality of two or thrjo hundred. Tho re
turns from California and Oregon render it rea
sonably evident that bjtli thosj Pacilio States
have gone fjr Lincoln, though tho plurality in
both cases will bj small. Tin 303 votes, there
fore, of the oloctoral college will be cast as fol
lows, 152 being necessary to a choice :

It has been reported that, of the three
successful electors on the straight Douglas
tickot in New Jersey, only one is sure ot vo
ting for Mr. Douglas, the rest being fo Mr.
Breckinridge. But as we do not know on
whut authority this statement rests, wo assign
all three to Douglas, in accordance with tho
ticket on whioh they were nominally run. Thus
it will bo soen that tho several Presidential can
didates for 1800 will, in all probability, receive

County and State Agricultural Societies.
The Legislature has, very wisely, takon away
the appropriation of some two thousand dollars
annually given to tho County Fairs. Those
Fairs have answered tho purpose of their crea
tion, and have, to a grwt extent, been super
seded by Town Fairs, which have, very appro
priately, taken their place, aud dispensed with
the expense heretof-re attendant upon the
County Fairs. Tuerelflrere several reasons why
it was thought best t discontinue this small
item of expense. Ufkpi alive organizations.
which were of no practical utility except to a
few managers, and was found to be in the way
of a healthy interchange of sentiments among
the people. It also, in a ineasuro, interfered
with the inauguration of other and more ad
vanced systems of improvement for the farmer.
Not that thes) societies have dono no good, for,
on tho contrary, they have awakened a good in
tercut in agricultural products, an interest
which cunnoi be in the least injured by now dis
continuing these appropriations. Farmers do
not need to be paid for producing superior uni
mals, but they do need to bo informed how to
produce better crops with tho same labor. Not
that there is to be somo fancy farmer imported
to give us this information, but there must iipc
ctsarily bo a email expense attending the collec
tion of iriformaiioii, and arranging a system of
experiments, for the farmers themselves to carry
oat. The fanners aro to furnish this informa
tion themselves, and to conduct tho operations,
Ihesamo as in their Town Fairs. But to make
it general and successful, it must havo the whole
.State for its field of labor, and tho sanction of
the Legislature.
We havo been making ariangemonts for a se
ries of articles from a correspondent who knows
whereof ho writes, a.id shall publish them at
no lale day. Meanwhile, wo want the sugges
tions aud inquiries of our agricultural friends
to aid us.

The Legislature its Character and Ad
journment. The combined wisdom and intelligence of the
State embodied in tho Legislature of the State
of Vermont, has been in seision for tho past
Kovcn weeks, and adjourned without day, on
the 27th instant.
This has been a Legislature long to be remem
bered, for tho length of the session, tho ability.
especially of tho House., and the important
measures that have been considered and dis
cussed in both its branches.
Among tho measures which have received the
attention of the Legislature of the present ses
sion, are the Appropriation Bill, to refund to
the cittizons of Montpolier, tho money they
baveexpended in rebuilding the State House; an
net to guard and protect the treasuiy of this
State ; an act to abolish the County Grand Ju
ry ; an act to fix tho salary of County Clerks ;
and an act to repeal tho statute prohibiting tho
Exhibition of Circuses, in this Stato.
Tho appropriation act to refund to the citi
zens of Montpelier, was referred to the commit
tee of " ways and means,'' who reported unan
imously in favor ot its passage, but, on account
of tho recent defalcation in tho treasury, tho
bill failed to pass the Ilouso ; but it was quite
apparent, that a largo majority of tho members
were convinced of the justice and equity of tho
measure, and had it not been for the defalcation
and depleted state of the treasury, the bill
would havo passed both houses, and this vexed
question would have boen settled forever. The
present session have discovered that, although
their predecessors had provided for tho prosecu
tion and punishment of cashiers and clerks for
embezzling money, that they had entirely omit
ted to furnish auy such protection in tho case
of the Stato Treasurer, and havo, at this ses
ion, provided the necessary remedy, with addi
tinal guards and checks.
The act to abolish tho County Grand Jury
was agitated and disousaed with great ability
in the House, but failed to pass by a vory close
vote. This discussion of the measure, will, I
think, prove of great benefit to tho Stato, inas
much as there has boen a growing prejudice
against the institution for several years past,
among the people of the State. The time, as
we think, is not far distant when this secret in
quisitien will ne longer disgrace and oppress
the people of this State.
The act to fix the salary of the several Coun
ty Clorks of this State, failed for want of time.
It is also undei stood tnat the several County
Clerks in this State, were much opposed to the
passeec, and exerted no little influence with

or an agent for the circus company which ex
hibited in Burlington last summer, was before
the committeo and Houso, urging the passage
of tho bill. And if all the persons connected
with circuses, areas gentlemanly smd energetic,
sjber and affable as that gentleman appeared to
be during the existing discussions which were
had upon the bill, then we think there would
be nothing immoral in the exhibition of a cir
cu i ; and as an economical question, it set ius to
us tho bill should havo passed, for our pjopli
are so constituted that they will have amuse
ments, and will witness circus exhibitions, and
will expand mure money to go abroad out of
the State, for that purpose, than would ba ex
panded if theso exhibitions were allowed iu this
Stato.
Among the most able and active members of
t'aa House, wo may mention linn. John (J.
Smith of St. Albans, (ilood of Morristown,
Field of Nowf'anr, Stoddard of TownshenJ,
Noyes of Burlington, Denison of Koyalton,
Allen of Rutland, Ilickerman of Charleston,
and Thomas of West Fairlej.. all of whom ex
hibited talents and ability of the first order ;
and when this phalanx ol men had fairly dis
cussed a question, it was evident that tho sub
ject was quite thoroughly exhausted of all ar
guments in favor or against it. There were
other members of the Houso who wore quite
active, and who participated largely in tho de
bates iu tho House, aud who possessed good
legislative talents. Among this number we
mention Pingry of WeathorsfielJ, Myers of
Jamaica, AVright ol Castleton, Child cf Hyde
park, Gardner of Bennington, Hale of Guild
hall, and llanncy of Brattleboro'. Theso men
exhibited legislative talents of a superior char
acter, and, on the whole, we doubt if the
Ilouso of Kepreocntatives ha combined o large
an aggregate of ability for many veius past.

dignified body. Among tho old Senators who
retro this year from that body, and who have
shown tho fir.:t order of ability, may be men
tioned Aldrich, Needhain, Wilkins and Arm
strong. And among the new members of that
body may be mentioned Peck of Chittenden,
Wheeler of (irand Isle, Hubbard of Windsor,
and Willard of Washington, who havo exhibit-
itcd rare legislative talents. On tho whole,
we think tho session just closed has been one of
more than oidinary interest, and one which wo
think will not to impair the confidence which
the people of this State have hitherto reposed
in their public servants.
Speeches by Mr. Lincoln.
Mr. Lincoln, accompanied by Mrs. Lincoln,
Senator Trumbull.fand others, journeyed from
Springfield to Chicago, a short time Binco
Although his journey was not generally known
beforehand, yot crowds of poopla assembled at
every depot. Quite enthusiastic demonstra
tions were made at several places, and Mr.
Lincoln was prevailed upon twice to acknowl
edge these testimonials of respect and estooiu.
At the town of Lincoln he came upon the plat
form or the car, and spoke as follows :
Fellow-Citizens : I thank yon Tor this mark
of your kindness toward mo. I have been shut
up in Springfield for the last few months, and
thereloro havo boon unable to greet you, as 1
was formerly in tho habit of doing. I am
passing on my way to Chicago, and am happy
in doing so to bo able to meet so many of my
friends in Logan County, and if to do no more,
to exchange with you tho compliments of tho
season, and to thank you for the many kind-
moou! juu nave iiiaiuitsieii lowatu me. 1 am
not in the habit of making speeches now, and I
would therefore ask to be excused from enter
ing upon any discussion of tho political topics
of tho day. j am glad to eee bo many happy
faces, and to listen to s many pleasant ex
pressions. Again thanking you for this honor,
I will pass en my journey.
Bowing to the enthusiastic cVowd, Mr. Lin
coln entered the car, which was already ia mo
tion. At Bloomington a very large crowd assem
bled, and after many calls, Mr. Lincoln appear
ed and spoke again, as follows :
Fellow-Citizens of Bloomington and McLtan
County : I am glad to meet you after a longer
separation than has been common botweon you
and me. I thank you for the good report you
made of the election in old McLean. The peo
plo of the Country have again fixed up their
affairs for a constitutional period of time. By
the way, I think rery muchjof the people as an
old friend said he thought of woman. Hu said
when he lost his first wife, who had been a
great help to him in business, he thought he
was ruined that be could never find another to
fill her place. At length, however, he married
mother, who he found did quite as well as the
first, and that his opinion now was that any
woman woulj do well who was well done by.
We will try to do well by thera in all parts of
tho Country, North and South, with entire con
fidence that all will be well with all ot us.
A federal saluti was fired while the train
stopped at Bloomington.

The St. Louis Democrat remarks :
The universality of the vote for Lincoln and
' Hamlin in this State is the most auspicious and
gruinying ens.imsianco which tne returns dis
close. There arc but very few connits in which

Would it not appear fr.m this that freedom ot'
suffrage is a practical light in Missouri? Ic
must bo remembered that iu the country they

by secret ballot is confined to St. Louis county.
What wo have to congratulate ourselves chiefly
upon, is not for having giving Lincoln seventeen
thousand votes, but having asserted and conquer

Pi.TKiJ'ACTiuNS. Some remarkable petrifac

tree. Whin loui.d it was still standing, but in
