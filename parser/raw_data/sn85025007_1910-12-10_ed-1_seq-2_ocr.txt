pPlaiOQ .1 BeprtHBtttive Jfann, at
tbe White House today. Mann declared
that the question was a delicate one
and ita injection into the proceedings
of thn short session wou!d probably
tie up nceded legislation. Mann ealled
at the White House to make appoint?
ment later to discuss with the president
the question of tolls to bo charged
vesaels using the Panama canal. As
chairman of the House committee ou
Interstate and Foreign Commerce,
Mann will undoubtedly have charge
of sueh legislation. "As I undcrstand
it," he aaid, \the maintenance of the
canal will cost $3,000,000 a year.
President Taft auggests in his message
that tbe toll be made about 81. per
gross ton for the vessel using tbe canal.
It baa been figured that tbis would
bring us in a return of only $7,000,000
a year, which of course, does not
corer tbe interest on our investment
of $375,000,000."
Sentiment in the House regarding
the Arirona state constitution isthat
tbe provi8ion for the recall of judges is
a fatal defect in thatdocument and, un?
less romoved. will eause the rejection
of the constitution by Congrcsa and
more delay in the acquirement of state

thrown, severely injuring an orange

trial for the murder of his wile, Mary
Castle Charlton, in their villa on tbe

"Tho secretary of state bad no right
to order the extradition of Charlton,"
said Clark. "ltaly having refused t?
return criminals to tbis country for
trial when asked under tlie terma of tbe
trcaty, she broke the trcaty, and it is
now as though it never existed. The
extradition must bc according to law,
and neitber the presideut or secretary
of state can mako that law. Congress
has the power and the secretary's state?
ment that despite Italy's action in

Wc also plan to prove to the Federal

appeal to the Supreme Court. We in
