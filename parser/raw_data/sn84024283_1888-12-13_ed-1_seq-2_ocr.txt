. I , DEPARTMENT, OF JUSTICE. I THE SQUATTERS
vn opsin of the Annual Report of Secre
V tary of tha Treasury Jalr child. -
Washington, Dec.- 4. Secretary Fair
child's annual report, submitted to Con
gress to-dny,presents
concisely the condi
tion of National
finances at the close
of the lust fiscal year,
together with hia es
timates of receipts
and expenditures for
the current and nex
. fiscal year. : The
.revenues for the
-present fiscal year,
actual and estimated,
are
placed at $377,
Secretary FairchM. 000,000; : expendi
tures, $273,000,000. For the next fiscal
year he estimates revenues amounting to
$377,000,000, and expenditures about .$276,
000,000. After presenting this financial
exhibit the secretary, bi-iefly, and in a gen
eral way, gives his attention to the ques
tions of surplus revenue, bond purchases
and reduction of taxation. He calculates
that unless the laws are changed, the
present surplus, together with what will
accumulate up to the close of the fiscal
year ending June 30, 190, will aggregate
fully $228,000,000, or sufficient to redeem
ail tne outstanding rour-and-a-half per
cents., now amounting to $188,000,000,
which mature in 1891. The principal of
the four per cents, outstanding is now
$080,000,000, and the interest which would
accrue upon them until maturity in 190
is about $500,000,000, and so, present sur
plus revenu , it continued, would pay
before VijO, all of these four per cents
Nothing more,the secretary says,is need
ed than this statement to show the abso
lute necessity of a readjustment of the
public revenues at the earliest possible
uate. mat it win De necessary to pay
nearly the whole of the interest which will
accrue upon the public debt if an attempt
is maae to invest tne present surplus rev
enues in it before its maturity, is evident
from the fact that even now the Govern
ment is paying for the four-and-a-half s at
a price which realizes only about one and
a half per cent, annually, and re
ceives only meager offerings at that
price. To continue taxation with
no other use for its proceeds
that such an investment is a cruel waste
of the people's money, and if this over
taxation is not stopped, and if the Govern
ment is ' forced to continue to be a pur
chaser of its own bonds at the holder's
price, the loss to the people must be hun
dreds of millions.
"I can not," the secretary adds, "too
strongly repeat my recommendation of
last year to reduce taxation, and as far as
possible, without too sudden disturbance
of existing interests, to make this reduc
tion in customs taxation, to the end that
the people may get the greatest
possible benefit from the reduction,
Beside the vexed economic ques
tion as to whether a country can
make itself prosperous by & tariff
whether it can increase the relative aver
age comfort of its whole people by divert
ing a portion of its labor and capital from
the employments which could be most
profitably followed under natural condi
tions, thereby making certain of the nec
essaries of life more costly than they would
be otherwise there is a higher moral
question which may well be asked, and
that is, Can a government be kept pure
and free which through the agency of its
laws, offers vast pecuniary temptations to
some kinds of business?
"There are many indications that this
question must be answered in the nega
tive. There are many proofs that large
classes of our business men have come to
depend for success on their skill in manip
ulating governmental agencies rather
than upon industry, intelligence and hon
orable competition. Is it not possible
that eagerness for the money which men
assume comes to them only through the
Government, may lead them to use an
ever-growing proportion of their gains to
possess and. influence the supposed
source of their wealth? and will
not the endeavor to make men
rich soon become the chief function of our
Government? Is not this already the case?
If these dangers exist, if they are not
overestimated and they do exist and are
not overestimated then can it be doubted
that the true welfare of our people calls
for the rescue of the Government from
them as speedily as may be? This can
only be done by severing government
from private business. Steps should at
once be taken in that direction, always,
however, let me repeat, bearing in mind
the interests which have beome establish
ed under present laws, to the end that they
may not suffer unduly while beneficent
reforms are made."
On the subject of silver coinage, the
secretary renews his recommendation of
last year: That of fixing the maximum of
silver which shall belong to the Govern
ment, and by providing that when it was
exceeded by $5,000,000, the purchase of sil
ver bullion should cease until the amount
owned by the Government should be again
reduced to such maximum,or by canceling
United States notes to the amount of the
excess over the maximum, provided the
Government held the notes; if not, then by
ceasing the purchase of bullion. Such
plan, if adopted, would provide a
safety valve which would be self
operative, and would assure the coun
try against any possible danger from
silver; for as soon as it exceeded the
amount which could be absorbed in the
business of the country, it would begin to
flow into the treasury in payment of
taxes, and would be there held until busi
ness called for it, and when the Govern
ment's ownership fell below the maxi
mum, the purchase of the bullion would
again begin. Thus the country's business
demand would regulate the country's
silver circulation, and there would be lit
tle danger of depreciation in the value of
the silver dollar as compared with the
gold dollar. Coin certificates the secre
tary considers a costly form of money;
but whatever may be thought about
the wisdom of the certificate
system, there can be no doubt that with it.
the further coinage of gold and silver, ex
cept subsidiary coin, is not necessary or
wise.

Attorney-General Garland, la His Annual
: Report, Make Mil Urgent Appeal for th
JvbliAhineat of NatlotiMl Fenlten
Marie and Reforms orlea for United
St ten Convicts.
Washington, Dec. 6. Attorney-General
Garland, in his annual report, makes an
earnest appeal to Congress to provide for
tne construction of Government peniten
tiaries and reformatories. Recent laws
that have been enacted by States with re
. spect to the labor of prisoners prove mora
conclusively than ever, he says, the abso
lute need of such institutions. Provisions
should at once be made looking to the
erection of at least one United States
penitentiary, and, if possible, a reform
atory. The objection in the minds
of many that the cost of conducting
such an institution would be so much
greater than the existinT arraneement is
being almost overcome by the fact that
tne favorable contracts which the depart
ment nas neretof ore been able to enter in
to can no longer be made. This arises
from the fact that laws passed recently by
several of the States and by Congress
prevent the employment of prisoners on
contract labor. This necessitates a resort
to experiments in other systems, as pro-
vison must necessarily be made for the
working of convicts, if discipline is to be
maintained and the prisoner's health and
comfort considered. A large number of
prisoners convicted in United States
courts are those who have committed but
a smgle offense, and who have but com
mence! a career of crime. If they could
do prevented from associating with hard
ened criminals and not confined in an in-
sutuuon wmcn m every way suggests a
sriminal life, many, perhaps, could be re
formed. Besides, many are young men
who have had positions of trust and re
sponsibility, and who, through tempta
tion, have committed some crime against
the laws of the country. These, and the
class referred to above, should not
be confined in a prison, but
the Government should provide a
suitable reformatory where proper
influences could be thrown around
them and their reformation effected, as is
done now in several States. In addition
to all this, he says, it would seem that the
United States should have model prisons
and reformatories of its own in which to
confine its criminals, and provisions
could be made for the employment of the
inmates at some suitable industries on a
system of labor which would not violate
the recent act of Congress, nor be incon
sistent with the laws passedby the sever
al States and the prevailing opinions rela
tive to the subject of contract labor.
The Attorney-General recommends a spe
cial appropriation of $375,000 for fees and
expenses of United States deputy mar
shals, and a readjustment of the marshals'
fee bill, which has not been revised for
thirty years. He also suggests the reor
ganization of the official force of the de
partment and an increase of the force to
correspond with the increased amount of
work done during the last four years. On
this subject the Attorney-General says:
"The work of the department during the
past year was a continuation of what has
been its policy during the whole of
the present Administration: a strict and
vigorous enforcement of the laws.
For nearly four years the department has
kept this object in view, and the results of
its action are very apparent. Because of
the diligent prosecution of suits for the
cancelation of fraudulent patents and
against timber trespassers and plunder
ers of the public domain, it has come to
be understood that the laws enacted for -
the regulation of the public lands, both as
to their general disposition and manage
ment, and as granted to railroads and
other corporations, are of binding force,
and are to be rigidly and impartially exe
cuted."
AN IMPORTANT MEASURE.
A Bill Designed to Kestrloft Immigration
and to Hxlfte the Standard of tlii Alleu
Increan of Our Population.
Washington, Dec. 6. Mr. Oates, of
Alabama, yesterday introduced in the
House a bill providing that no alien shall
be admitted into the United States who is
an idiot, insane, a pauper or liable to be
come a public charge, or who has been
legally convicted of a felony or other in
famous crime or misdemeanor involving
moral turpitude, or who is a polygamist,
Anarchist or Socialist, or who is afflicted
with any loathsome or contagious disease,
or who has entered into contract to per
form labor or service for any person, firm
or corporation.
A penalty by fine not to exceed $1,000 oi
imprisonment not to exceed thres years,
is imposed.
Section 3 provides that no vessel shall
bring more than five immigrants for each
one hundred tons of the capacity of the
vessel. A fine of $500 for each passenger
in excess of the limit is provided. A tax
of twenty-five dollars per head w levied
upon every alien who comes into the
United States, the tax to be collected by
the collector of customs at the port of
entry from the owner or master
of . the vessel upon which the
alien Is brought. Exemptions are
made of diplomatic representatives,
consuls or agents accredited to foreign
governments; of persons who come for
travel, instruction or temporary resi
dence. Upon the latter class making af
fidavit to that effect, they are gwen an
acknowledgment of the colled ion of
twenty-five dollars, which is good for
three yearsi payable at any port upon re-
embarkation. It further provides that
United States consuls abroad shall, after
inquiry, issue certificates of emigration
to persons desiring to emigrate to the
United States. Without a certificate from
a United States Consul no person Khali be

is directed to see that the provisions of
the bill are carried into effect.

A Ca-iatlian Oii'l:iw.
Montreal, Can., Dec. 5. The Provincial
Government has placarded throughout the
entire Lake Mogantic region a proclama
tion ordering tho arrest of any one pro
tecting, harboring or conniving at the es
cape of Donald Morrison, the penalty
being two years' imprisonment as an ac

all the inhabitants of the region, who aro
sworn friends of the murderer.

&t. Paul, Hum., . Dec 6. Twenty-one
executions were issued in the District
Court yesterday for the eviction of the
Polish squatters living on the npper levee
is the vicinity of the new high bridge.-.
The land on which these squatters hava
built their humble hom?3 is owned by a
sjuuiuaiu oiace me Duiiamg of the high
bridge has begun the property ha$ greatly
increased in value, and the svndicae have
had it platted into lots, which are offered
lor sale. ,
Four months ago Meritz Helm, as attor
ney for the syndicate, served notice on .
tne squatters that they must evacuate.
The squatters are poor and ignorant, and
nave come to Deneve tnat they are right
ful owners. Some of them have lived
there on the flats as long as twentv vears.
They have seen their children grow up and
wed together. They have made their
little shanties, built with their own hands, !
snug ana warm to witnstand tne fierce
winters and water-tight, to keep out the
water wnen tne spring floods come. They
nave meir own cows and chickens an
flower-beds and minature gardens.
Naturally enough, they have paid no at
tention to the lawyer's notice. There i
probably a population of at least 2,000 of
these squatters on the npper flats. This is
the first attempt that has ever been made j
to put them off. It is no longer a good-
lur-nuuung waste, it nas an Deen re
claimed from the ravages of the rive
by the building of a levee, which the
city has now nearly completed. The
whole settlement will be wiped out, and
wnere now there are small shanties sub
stantial business blocks and residences'
will be built.
It is feared that the constables will meet
with armed resistance from the squatters
when they go down there to enforce the
writs. The squatters are in an ugly
frame of mind. They see winter staring
them m their faces and will not be driven
from their homes without making trouble

Cincinnati, Dec. 6. The Price Current
of this morning says:
Fifteen of the largest "packing points

. London, Dec 7. The rauwr that the
old project for the purchase of Cuba ii to
be revived ha-s awakened- soma Interest
among the American resident here and
in Paris, but hardly any ona else in the
two capitals knows or cares any thing
auuufc Lire mtfcor. luuac; : uuruaub9 ouu
politicians in the French capital who have
been approached upon the matter,
either skillfully conceal or - frankly
acknowledge their ignorance, or indiffer
ence, to the subject, and it is difficult to
refrain from the conviction that many of
them never heard of such an island, or
are dubions about its exact locality. The
same classes in England are much better
informed, of course, and should the .ru
mor assume more definite proportions,
the journals will doubtless refer to tha
question, giving their readers data care
fully crammed for the occasion. Ia Mad
rid, the bare possibility that such an of
fer will be entertained, has been scouted
with so much indignation as to leave no
doubt of Spanish opinion on the matter.
cenor Armrjo, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, professed to be anable to believe in
the existence of such a design on the part '
of the United States, and said that the
position of Spain on the subject was so
well known that any, offer to purchase
Cuba, no matter what amount was des
ignated, could only be construed as an
insult to a friendly power. A subordi
nate Spanish official who has returned
from the faitjiful isle with the usual rec
ompense for his years of exile, was de
cidedly outspoken as to the lot of any
clique or persons even suspected of en
tertaining such a proposition. He said ho.
had lived near enough the United States
and had visited that country enough to be
familiar with the character of the people,
and he considered the project of buying
Cubaas simply Yankee bluster. ."Spain
would no more sell Cuba," said he, "than
a mother would sell her child. Americans
can imagine our feelings upon the matter
by reflecting what theirs would be if we
were to request the United States to name
the price at which she would transfer ,
Florida to Spain." .
A PERILOUS TIME.
Story of Cap'alu Furey of thn Hropelnr
Starucca, Lot on Graud Maral, Lakv
Superior.
Buffalo, N. Y., Dec. 7. -Captain C. S.
Furey of the propeler Starucca, , which
was wrecked off Grand Marais, on Lake
Superior, on November 15, has returned
to the city, and tells the story of the wreck.
He says the crew had a terrible experience,
and gives much credit to Captain Cleary
and the life-saving crew at Deer Park
station for assistance rendered. The
storm of wind and snow raged
fearfully, and when it was seen, on
the night of the 15th, that nothing could
save the boat, the captain and his twenty-
three men took refuge in the cabin. The
waves beat with terrible violence against
the vessel, and it seemed every moment
as if she would go to pieces. Some of the
crew who feared staying on board, made
an attempt to get ashore in a small
boat and finally succeeded. They walked
twelve miles to the life-saving station
and the life crew at once set out to rescue
the remainder of the propeler's crew. .
The storm still raged furiously, and.lt was
with difficulty that the surf -boat reached
the vessel and took off the shipwrecked
men. The crew camped on the beach for
thirteen days watching the cargo and try
ing to get the boat off, but the storm con
tinued and she was abandoned. Nothing
will be done with her until spring. A
small part of the cargo was saved. '

Washington, Dec. 7. "You can look
out now for the money to fly," said Sena
tor vest yesterday.
"The Republicans
have got every thing
and they will make
appropriations right

pass the Service Pen-
sion bill, which will
use up at least $250,-

many other bills in the same line.'
Thay will probably run the expenses o '
the Government np to over $000,000,00
within two years. They will soon
get rid of the surplus. That will not long
be a standing menace to General Harri
son's administration, as it has been to Mr.
Cleveland's. The Republicans will, no
doubt, call in the $60,000,000 now out
in the National banks, and that, with all
the extravgance of appropriations, will
