Further Evidence in Shea Trial
Indicates Desperate Meas
ures Were Committed:
. CHICAGO, Dec. 11. Evidence was
brought in the Shea trial today that
President Shea during the strike of the
teamsters last .year seriously considered
the use of dynamite as a means of win
ning the strike.
Michael Kclh', who was in charge of
one of the squads of pickets, testified
on tho stand toduy that Shea asked him
if he knew of anybody who could han
dle dynamite. lie also said that knives
were given out. to the pickets with in
structions that they were to be used
on colored men who had taken the
places of the strikers, and also for the
purpose of cutting harness. The attor
neys for the defense made a strong
light against the admission of this tes
timony of Kelly, but Judge Ball decid
ed that it was' adinissable.
BISHOP M'CABE STRICKEN
Noted Methodist Divine, and Veteran
of War, Victim of Apoplexy.
NEW FORK. Dec. 11. Bishop
Charles Caldwell McCabe, who before
his election to the bishopric of tho
Methodist Episcopal church was popu
larly known as ''Chaplain McCabe,"
was stricken with apoplexy just after
he arrived in this city today. He was
at once removed to the New York hos
pital, where tonight it was said that
though the outcome of tho bishop's at
tack could not be positively predicted,
his present condition was decidedly fa
vorable to a speedy recovery.
Bishop McCabe' makes his homo in
Philadelphia, from which city he came
today on business connected with
church matters. He had stepped briskly
from a Pennsylvania railroad ferryboat
at the West Twenty-third street ter
minal, when ho suddenly staggered and
fell. He was carried into the fcryy
house and an ambulance summoned. Tho
bishop was unconscious for a few mo
ments, but had recovered consciousness
before ho reached the hospital. Mrs.
McCabe was notified at Philadelphia,
and was expected here tonight.
The bishop became known formerly
as "Chaplain" McCabe because of Ins
service during the Civil war in the Ono
Hundred and Twenty-second regiment
of Ohio volunteers. After the war ho
acquired n national reputation by his
lecture on "Army Life' and his book,
"The Sunny Side of Libby Prison," in
which institution tho churchman spent
four months. lie was born at Athens,

FOR ELASTIC CURRENCY
Bankers Present Their Arguments to
the House Committee.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Tho cur
rency commission of tho Bankers' asso
ciation appeared before the Banking
and Currency committee of the Houso
today in support of the elastic currency
bill supported bv tho association. James
B. Forgan of the First National bank
of Chicago endeavored to refute tho
charge that it is a Wall street measure.
He said that the issuance of additional
bank notes would not result in extend
ing additional credit tb Wall street
interests.
As an illustration of the great drain
on banks at crop-moving time, Mr. For
gan said that the bank with which ho
is connected was called upon to ship
$3,500,000 to Western banks during tho
first seven days of last September. Ho
ureod tho uecessit3" for a more elastic
currency to meet such emergencies, and
explained that under the proposed bill
a national bank with a capital of $100,
000 will be permitted to issue .$25,000
worth mora of bank notes upon which
it shall pay 2Vi per cent', and .$12,500
worth more of bank notes upon which
the rate ofintorcst shall be 5 per cent.

Riders Have Settled Down to a
Steady Grind Waiting
for Sprint.
WALTHOUR AND BEDELL
ONE LAP BEHIND
Salt, Lake Boys Riding Strong
and Right Up With the
Leaders.
NEW YORK, Dec. 11. There was
no change during the night in the
number of teams contesting or, in their
positions in the bic3'cle race in progress
at Madison Square Garden. Now and
again tho thousand or so spectators who
remained in the place all night were
enlivened by an occasional spurt on the
part of the riders, but on the whole the
night was uneventful. A few spills
occurred, but none of the riders was
seriously hurt or sufficiently to put him
out of the contest.
Walthour caused most of the excite
ment in the early hours, especially when
he made one desncrate attempt to re
trieve the Ian which he lost when he
was compelled to change partners after
tlm accident to Hugh McLean, his
original team mate. Try as he would,
however, the other riders clung to him,
and ho was compelled for the time to
desist. He is confident, nowever, that
he will eventuallv accomplish this pur
pose. Walthour is cheered and en
couraged by his 3ouug wife, who is
frequently at tho track side. John
Bedell, Walthour's partner. isa strong
rider, and this combination is feared
by the other contestants.
"Every rider remaining in the race ap
peared in good condition today. Thev
are a fast lot, and could, if they would
let themselves out, endanger the
record. Thev are, however, reserving
their strength for tho trying days at
the end of the week.
The score at 7 a. m. of all the teams
excopt Walthour and Bedell was G16
miles and 5 laps; the score of tho pair
was G16 miles and 4 laps.
The record for this hour is 640 miles
and 4 laps, made by Elkos and Mac
Farland in 1900.
At 30 a. m. the twelve leading
teams had covcrfed 670 miles, 6
laps, aud Walthour and Bedell were
1 Ifip behind the leaders, with 670
miles- five laps. At that hour th.e
leaders were 27 miles, 6 laps behind tho
record.
At 1 o'clock the twelve leading
teams had covered 724 miles. Walthour
and Bedell were still 1 lap behind. The
leaders were 30 miles behind the record.
At 2 p, m. the standing of the riders
was unchanged. The twelve leading
teams had covered 741 miles, 1 lap,
and Walthour and Bedell 741. miles.
Tho leaders were 32 miles 7 laps be

RENO, Nov., Dec. 11. What:' -promises
to bo a solution to the' theft of a
-quarter 'of "a milll"oiitoIRn!5;,wbrth of
high-grade gold ore this season from
the Mohawk mine of Goldfield is devel
oping in Reno tonight.
Judge Wangfield Monday morning at
0 o'clock was stepping on the train
for the coast, when he noticed that the
express company was putting- abroad
fully two tons of sacked ore. Knowing
that no mine in the camp was sending
ore by express ho became convinced
that this two tous belonged to him,
and that it was a part of that stolen
from the mine. He a once wired his
law3rer and at 7 o'clock Monday even
ing ho waHmet at Sparks by his lawj-er
in an automobile and there was a raco
between the train and the machine be
gun to Reno.
Mr. Wingfield stated, as ho jumped
into the automobile, that ho would file
an attachment either at Reno or Oak
land, and that he would find out whoro
the Mohawk high-grade ore has gone.
An effort will be mado to locate tho
shipper at Goldfield. Tho bags wero
not. marked, and this, coupled with tho
fact that the ore waa put aboard dur
ing the darkness' of the morning, would
apparently put. it up to tho express
company to explain.
A groat sensation is expected to fol
low this running down of ore valued
at anywhere from 5 to $10 a pound.
Mr. Wingfield is certain that he will
run the guilty parties down within tho
week.

President Transmits to Con
gress Results of His Visit
to the Island.
RECOMMENDS CONFERRING
OF FULL CITIZENSHIP
Speaks Highly of the Schools
and the Possibilities in
Agricultural Line.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 11. The
President's message to Congress, giv
ing the result of his recent observation
in Porto Rico, and making recommen
dations concerning the government of
that island, was read to the Senate to
day. Tho message was as follows:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: On November 21 I visited the island
of Porto Rico, landlnp.at Ponce, cross
ing by the old Spanish road by Cayey
to San Juan, and relurnlnj? next morn
lns over the new American road from
Areclho to Ponce: the scetery was won
derfully beautiful, especially among the
mountains of the Interior, which consti
tutes a veritable tropic Switzerland. I
could not embark at San Juan because
the harbor has not been dredged out and
cannot receive an American battleship. 1
do not think this fact creditable to us as
a nation, and I earnestly hope that Im
mediate provision will be made for dredg
ing San Juan harbor.
I doubt whether our people as a whole
rcallzo tho beauty and fertility of Porto
Rico, and the progress that has been
made under Its admirable government.
We have just cause for pride in the
character of our represetnatlvcs who
have administered the tropic islands
which came under our flag as a result
of tho war with Spain: and of no one
of them Is this more true than of Porto
Rico. It would be Impossible to wish a
more faithful, a more efficient and a
more dlstlntcrested public service than
that now being rendered in the island
of Porto Rico by those In control of the.
Insular government
Praises Educational Work.
I stopped at a dozen towns all told,
and one of the, notable features In every
town was the gathering of the school
children. Tho work that lias been done
in Porto ".Ico for education has been
noteworthy. The main cmplKisls, as is
eminently wise and proper, has been put
upon primary education; but in addition
to this there is a normal school, an agri
cultural school, three Industrial and three
high schools. Every effort is being made
to secure not only the benefits of ele
mentary education to all the Porto Rl
cans of the next generation, but also as
far as means will permit, to train them
so that the Iriclustrlal. 'asrlcultural and
commercial opportunities of the island
can be utilized to the best possible ad
vantage. It wa3 evident at a glance that
the teachers, both Americans arid native
Porto Rlcans, were devoted to their work,
and took tho greatest pride In it, and
wore endeavoring to train their pupils,
not only In mind, but In what counts for
far more than mind in citizenship, that
is, In character.
I was very much struck by the excel
lent character both of the Insular police
and of the Porto Rlcnn regiment. They
are both of them lodloa that reflect credit
upon the American administration of the
Island. The insular police are under tho
local Porto Rican government. The Por
to Rlcan regiment of troops must be ap
propriated for by the Congress. I ear
nestly hope that this body will be kept
permanent. There should certainly be
troops In the Island, and it Is wise that
these troops should be themaelves native
Porto Rlcans. It would be from every
standpoint a mistake not to perpetuate
this regiment.
Most Prosperous Year.
In traversing tho Island even the most
cursory survey leaves the beholder struck
with the evident rapid growth In the cul
ture both of tho sugar cane and tobac
co. Tho fruit Industry is also growing.
Last year was tho most prosperous year
that the Island has ever known before
or since tho American occupation. The
total of exports and Imporls of tho island
was forty-live millions of dollars us
against eighteen millions In 1001. This
Is tho largest In the Island's history.
Prior to the American occupation, the
greatest trade for any one year was that
of 18D6, when It roached nearly twenty
three millions of dollars. Last year, there
fore, there was double the trade that
there was in the moBt prosperous year
under the Spanish regime. There were
210,273 tons of sugar exported last year,
of the value of 5M. 180,319: 53.555.1U3 of
tobacco, and 2S.2D0.322 pounds of coffee
of the value of $3,481,102. Unfortunately,
what used to be Porto Rico's prime crop
coffee has not shared this prosperity.
It has never recovered from the disaster
of the hurricane, and, moreover, the bene
fit of throwing open our market to It has
not compensated for tho loss Inflicted by
the closing of the markets to it abroad.
1 call your attention to tho accompany
ing memorial on this subject, of tho
Board of Trade of San Juan, and I ear
nestly hope that some measuro will be
takon for the benefit of tho excellent and
hlgh-grado Porto Rlcnn coffee.
In addition to delegations from tho
Board of Trade- and Chamber of Com
merce of San Juan, I also received dele
gations from tho Porto Rlcnn Federation
of Labor, and from the Coffee-growers'
association.
Should Confer Citizeuship.
There Is a matter lo which I "wish to
call your special attention, and that la
tho desirability of conferring full Ameri
can citizenship upon tho people of Porto
HIco. I most earnestly hope that this
will be done. I can not sec how harm
can possibly result from It, and it seems
to me a matter- of right and Justice to
tho people of Porto Rico. They are loyal,
thov arc glad to bo under our flag, they
arc" making rapid progress along tho
path of orderly liberty. Surely we should
show our appreciation of them, our prldo
in what they have done, aud our pleasure
In extending recognition for what baa
Ihus been done, by grunting them full
American citizenship.
Under tho wise administration of tho
present Governor aud Council, marked
progress has been made In tho difficult
matter of granting lo the people of the
island the largest measure of self-government
that can with safety bo given
nt tho prosenL llmo. It would have been
a very serious mistake to have gone any
faster than we have already gone In this
direction Tho Porto Rlcans have com
plete and absolute autonomy In all their
municipal governmcntK. tho only power
over them possessed by tho Insular Gov
ernment being that of removing corrupt
or Incompetent municipal officials. This
power has never been exorcised save on
tho clearest proof or corruption or of in
competence Eiicb as to Jcopurdlzo tho
interests of the people of the Island; and
under such circumstances it lias been
fearlessly used lo the Immense benefit of
the people. It Is not n power with which
It would bo safe, for the sake of the ls-

NEW YORK, Dec. 11. Fines aggre
gating $150,000 were imposed today by
Judge Holt in the United States Cir

fining company and the Brooklyn
Cooperage company after the defend
ants, through counsel, had pleaded

After the fines were imposed United
States District Attorney Stimson, who

act as a deterrent to rebaters in tho
future, and that the Government would
consent to the remainder of the indict

Judge Holt granted a motion dismiss

Question One of Business, Not Politics,
Says EopreEentative Campbell.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. Represen
tative Campbell of Kansas today in
troduced a resolution providing for the
appointment of a joint Congressional
committee to inquire into the relations
of tariff to trusts and monopolies, and
the industrial and labor interests of rhd

reasons, if any, for changing our tariff
schedules. The time for revision ought
to be a business question, and not a
political question."

not be changed at this time. The ma

Elections Wore Orderly.
The elections this year were absolutely
orderly, unaccompanied by any disturb
ance; and do protest has been made
against tho management of the elections;
although three contests are threatened
where the majorities were very small
and error was claimed; the contests, of
course, to be settled In the courts. In
short, the Governor and Council are co
operating with all of the most enlight
ened and most pntrlotlc of the people of
Porto Rico in educating tho citizens of
tho Island In the principles of orderly
llborty. They are providing a govern
ment based upon each citizen's self
respect, and the mutual respect of all
citizens: that is, based upon a rigid ob
servance of tho principles of Justice and
honestv. It has not been easy to Instill
Into the minds of people unaccustomed to
the exercise of freedom, the two ba6lo
principles of our American system; the
principle that tho majority must rule,
and the principle that the minority lias
rights which must not be disregarded or
tramolod upon. Yet real progress has
been made in having these principles ac
cepted as elementary, as the foundations
of succosslul self-government.
All tho insular governments should bo

State. It l a mistake not bo to arrange
our handling of these islands at Wash

of the experience gained In one, when

In conclusion let mo express my ad

gress when it enacted the law under
which the Island is now being adminis

ally, and after five years' experience In
connection with its administration. It is
but fair to those who devlsod this law to
say that It would bo well-nigh impossible-
to have devised any other which in

STORM IN SIERRAS S
Her.vy Snow and Fierce Wind Has De-
layed All Trains. H
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. IK A
fierce snowstorm is raging in the Sierra
Nevada and Siskiyou mountains and
as a result trains on all lines of tho
Southern Pacific are a little late. All H
the snow shovels of the company wero !H
pressed into service to clear the tracks vl
of tho snowdrifts. -VH
The storm played havoc with tclo- jll
graph wires. Tho Southern Pacific VH
company had no communication tod.Ty H
further' than Blue Cnnon in the Sierra Jf
Nevada mountains aud Dunsmuir on
the north. Tho poor telegraph service H
made the handling of trains extremely - jH
difficult.
Up to a late hour no serious damage H
along cither line was reported at tho H
local office, although in several places H
trees had blown across tho track and iH
delayed trains. H
