iho sentiment that the constitutional rights
nf all our citizens must be maintained, does not
grow weaker. It will cuntinue to control the
Uovcrnmcntof the country. Happily, the his
tory of the lato election shows that in many
Earts of the country where opposition to the
if teenth Amendment bus heretofore prevailoi,
it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogeth
er, if firm and well considered action is taken
by Concrcsn. T trust the House of Representa

judec of the elections, returns and qualifications

shall accrue to am person or party. It will bo
the duty of the Hxccutive, with Buflhient ap
propriations, for the purpose, to prosecute un
sparingly all who havo been encased in depriv
ing citizens of the rijihts guaranteed to them by
thfintifnlion.
It is not, however, to be forgotten that thebest
and surest imarantce of tho primary rights nf
citizenship is to be found in that capacity for

promotions and removals, establishing a uni

every instance, the attainment of the beat qual
ificatlona for the position in qaeation. Stiob a
method alone is consistent with the equal rights
of all citizens, and tho most economical and ef
ficient administration of the puhho busincas.
Competitive examinations, in aid of impartial
appointments and promoUons, have been con
ducted for sumo years past in several of the Kx
eeutivo Departments, and by my direction this
system has been adopted in the custom houses
and post-ofiices of tho larger cities of the coun
try. In the city of Now York over two thousand
positions in the olv il Bcrvlco havo been subject
in their appointments and tenure of
place, to tho operation of published
rules for thia purpose during the
past two years. Tho rcsnlta of these practical
trials liavo been very satisfactory , and have eon-
iirmed my opinion in favor of this ay stem of bo
cotlon. All are subjected to the same tests, and
the result is fice from prejudice by pcrconat fa
vor or partisan Inllucnoe. It Ecourea for the po
sition applied for, the best qualifications attain

It is the recognized duly and purpose of. the
peoplo of the United States to nnpprcss polygamy
where it now exists in our Territories, and to
Prevent its extension, V-dthfiil and zealous of
nrts have been mado by Uio .United States au
thorities In ntah to enforce tho laws against it.
Kxperlenco has shuwn that the legislation upon
this subject, to becffcotlvo, requires cxtcusivo
modification and amendment. Thelongcr action
is delayed the moro dlfhcult it will bo to accom
plish what is desired. Prompt and deoided
measures aro necessary. '1 ho Mormon sectarian
organization which upholds polygamy has tho
whole power of making and executing tho looat
legislation of tho Terntury. By its control of
the grand and petit Juries it possesses largo In
fluence over the ejlmlnistratlon of Jiisttco. lx
creislng, as tho heads nf tills sect do, tho local
political power of ths Territory, they aro able to
make effective their hostility to the law of Con
gress on the subject of polygamy, and
in fact, do prevent itn enforcement. Polygamy
will not bo abolished if tho enforcement of tho
law depends nn thoso who praotlco and uphold
the crime. It can only bo suppressed by taking
away tho political power ot tho Bcot which en
courages and sustains it. The power of Con
gress to enact suitiblo laws to protect the Ter
ritories is ample. It is not a case for half-way
measures. Tno political power of the Mormon
sect is Increasing! it controls now ono of our
wealthiest and mnst populous Territories. It Is
extending stcai'iiy into other Territories.
Wherever it iocs it establishes polygamy and

full appreciation ot tbo opportunities which our
