To tl'e Congress of tUe United States:
The assemblage Within the nation's legis
lative halls Of those charged with the duty
of naklng laws for the beuollt of a generous
aul free prepte, Impressively suggests the
exacting obligation and inexorable responsl

In the discharge of an executive duty enjoin
ed by the constitution I aubuiit this
communication, containing a brief state
ment of the condition ot our national af
fairs and recommending such legislation as
gitms to be necessary and expedient:
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations and our peaceful relations
with them at this time additionally demon
strate the advantage of consistently ad
hering to a firm but just foreign policy,
free from envious or ambitious national
schemed and characterized by entire hon
est and sincerity.
During the past year, pursuant to a law
»f congress, commissioners were appoint
ed to the Antwerp Industrial exposition.
Though the participation of American ex
hibitors fell far short of completely Illus
trating our national Ingenuity and Indus
trial achievements, yet it was quite cred
itable in ylew of the brief time allowed for
preparation.
I have endeavored to impress upon the
Belgian government the needlessnees and
positive harmfulness of its restrictions
upon the Importation of certain of our food
products ana have strongly urged that the
rigid supervision and inspection under our
laws are amply sufficient to prevent tlie
exportation from this country of diseased
cattle and unwholesome meat.
Pence In Brasll.' JiM
The termination of the civil war in Bra
zil has been followed by the general preva
lance of peace and order. It appearing at
an early stage of the insurrection that its
course would call for uuusual watchfulness
on the part of this government onr naval
force in the harbor of Kio de Janeiro was
strengthened. This precaution I am satis
fled tended to restrict the issue to a simple
trial of strongthj between the Brazilian gov
ernment and the insurgents and to avert
complications which at times seemed Immi
nent. Our firm attitude of neutrality was
maintained to the end. The insurgents re
ceived no encouragement of eventual asy
lum from our commanders and such oppo
sition as they encountered was for the pro
tection of our commerce and was fuily jus
tified by public law.
The commission organized under the con
vention which we had entereed into with
Chile for the settlement of the outstanding
claims of each government against the oth
er, adjudged at the end of the period stipu
lated for its continuance, leaving undeter
mined a number of American cases which
had been duly presented. These claims are
not barred aud negotiations are in progress
for their submission to a tribunal.
The Eastern War.
The 17th of March last the new treaty
with China in further regulation was signed
at "Washington and on Aug. 13 it received
the sanction of the senate. Ratification on
the part of China and formal exchange
are awaited to give effect to this beneficial
convention.
A gratifying recognition of the uniform
Impartiality of tills country towards all
foreign states was manifested by the com
pany Incident to requests of the Chinese and
Japanese governments that the agents of
the United States should within proper
limits afford protection to the subjects of
each during the suspension of dlplomatlo
relations due to a state of war. This del
icate office was accepted, and a misappre
hension which gave rise to the belief that
in affording this kindly unofficial protection
our agents would exercise the same au
thority which the withdrawn agents of the
belligerents had exercised, was promptly
corrected. Although the war between China
and Japan endangers no policy of the
United States, It deserves our gravest con
sideration by reason of Its disturbance of
our growing commercial interests in the
two countries and the increased dangers
which may result In our citizens domiciled or
sojourning in the interior of China.
Offer to Mediate.
Acting under a stipulation in our treaty
with Corea (the first concluded with a "West
ern power), I felt constrained at the begin
ning of the controversy to tender our good
offices to Induce an amicable arrangement
of the Initial difficulty growing out of the
Japanese demands for administrative re
forms In Corea but the unhappy precipita
tion of actual hostilities defeated this
kindly purpose. Deploring the destructive
war between the two most powerful of the
Easlera nations, and anxious that our com
nverclal interests in those countries may be
preserved, and that the safety of our citi
zens there shall not be Jeopardized, I wotila
not hesitate to heed any intimation that our
friendly aid for the honorable termination
of hostilities would be acceptable to both
belligerents.
A convention has been finally concluded
for the settlement by arbitration of the pro
longed dispute with Ecuador, .growing out
of the proceedings against Emllle Santos, a
naturalized citizen of the United States.
Needless Prohibition of Cattle."
Acting on the reported discovery of Texas
fever in cargoes of American cattle, the
German prohibition against importations
of live stock and fresh meats from this
C"tntry hits been revived. It is hoped that
Germany will soon become convinced tnat
the prohibition le as needless as it Is
harmful to mutual interests. The German
go1* ernuient has protested against that pro
vision of the customs tariff act which im
poses a discriminating duty of one-tenth or
1 cent a pound on sugars coming from
conn tries paying an export bounty thereon,
claiming that the exaction of such duty
Is in cct ti aventlon of articles five and nine
of the treatv of 1828 with Prussia. In
the interests of the commerce of both coun

of treaty violation, I recommend the repeal

The Berlne Sea. Agreement.
Early In the present year an agreement
was reached with Great Britain concerning
Instructions to be given to the naval com
manders of the two governments In Ber
ing sea and the contiguous ?orth Puclflc
ocean for their guidance in the execution
of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbi
tration and the enforcement of the regula
tions therein prescribed, for the protection
of seal life in the waters mentioned. An
nnderstandlng has also been reached for
the pavment by the United States of $425.
000 in full satisfaction of all claims which
may be made by Great Britain for damages
growing out of the controversy as to fur
seals in Bering or the seizure of British
vessels engaged in taking seals in these
waters. The awards and findings of the
Paris tribunal to a great extent deter
mined the facts and principles upon which
ttese claims should be adjusted and they
have been submitted by both governments
to thorough examination upon the princi
ples, as well as the facts which they in
volved. 'I am convinced that a settlement
•upon tho terms mentioned would be an
equitable and advantageous one, and I
lecom'mend thnt provision be made for the
•prompt payment of the stated sum. Thus
far only France and Portugal have signified
their willingness to adhere to the regula
tions established under the award of the
Paris tribunal of arbitration. Preliminary
surveys of the Alaskan boundary and a pre
paratory examination of the question of
protection of food fish in the contiguous
waters of the United States and the Domin
ion of Canada are in progress.
The boundary of British Guinea still re
mains in dispute between Great Britain and
"Venezuela. Believing that Its early settle
ment on some jnst basis alike honorable to
both parties Is in the line of our established
policy to remove from this hemisphere all
causcs of difference with powers beyond the
sea, I shall renew the efforts heretofore
made to bring about a restoration of dip
lomatic relations between the disputants,
and to Induce a reference to arbitration, a
resort whleh Great Britain so conspicuously
favors in principle and respects in practice,
and which Is earnestly sought by her weaker
adversary.
Regarding: Hawaii.
Since communicating the voluminous cor
respondence In regard to Hawaii and the
action taken by the senate and house of rep
resentatives on certain questions submitted
to the judgment and wider discretion of
congress, the organization of a governmeat
in place of the provisional arrangement
which followed the deposition of the queen
has been announced with evidence of Its
effective operation. The recognition usual
In such cases has been accorded the new
government.
The BlneBelda' Incident.
Prominent among the questions of the
year was the Blueflelds' incident in what Is
known as the Mosquito Indian strip, bor
dering on the Atlantic ocean and within the
jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of
18G0 between Great Britain and Nicaragua
the former government expressly recognized
the sovereignty of the latter over the strip
and a limited form of self-government was
guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be
exercised according to their customs, for
themselves and other dwellers within Its
limits. The so called native government
which grew to be largely made up of aliens,
for many years disputed the sovereignty of
Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the
right to maintain a practically independent
government. Early in the past year efforts
of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over
the Mosquito tcrrltlry led to serious dis
turbances culminating in the suppression
of the native government anu the attempted
substitution of an Impracticable composite
administration in Nicaragut and alien resi
dents were to participate. Failure was fol
lowed by an insurrection which for a time
subverted Nlcaraguan rule, expelling her of
ficers and restoring the old organization.
This In turn gave place to the existing! local
government established and upheld by Nlc
wpgua- ,,l%
ss
5^^lV«ffl gsSKi
largely
inerce oi that
been and 6tlU eoiitrolled by. onr citizens, we
canttot ftt that reason challenge the rlght
nll Sovereignty of Nicaragua over ihls Im
portant part of her domain.
For some months on and during part ox
the time two of our naval ^llps have, beeq
Btatloned at Blueflelds, fof the protection
of all legitimate ifitfefesls of our cltlzcns.
In September mat the government at Man
tiaga expelled from Its territory twelve or
ftbr'e foreigners. Including two Americans,
for alleged participation In the sedition or
revolutionary movements against the repub
lic at Blueflelds already mentioned but
through the earnest remonstrance of this
eovernment the two, Americans^ have been
permitted to "return to the peaceful manage
ment of their business. Our naval com
manders'at the scene of these disturbances,
by their constant exhibition of firmness and
good judgment contributed largely to the
prevention of more serious consequences and
to the restoration of peace and order. I e
tret that in the midst of these occurrences
there happened a most grave and ifT't'it'iig
failure of Nicaragua justice. An American
citizen named Wilson residing at Kaamk
Mosquito territory, was murdered .by one
Argueleo, the acting governor of the town.
After some delay the murderer
ested, but so Insecurely confined or guarded
that he escaped and notwithstanding ou
repeated demands It Is claimed that his re
capture has been Impossible by reason of
bis fight beyond Nlcaraguan jurisdiction.
The Nlcaraguan authorities having Riven
notice of forfeiture of their concesslon to
the canal company on grounds Purely tech
nical and not embraced in the contract have
receded from thnt position.
The Row With Salvador.
The government of Salvador having been
ovt-rthrewn by an abrupt popular QUtbreftk,
certain of its military and civil officers,
while hotly pursued by infuriated i"surgj
ents, sought refuge on boaril the Uulted
States warship BVunl?R\?^ ?he nra?tlce
a Salvadorean port. Although .the practice
of asylum Is not favored by this govern
ment, yet, in view of the imminent peril
which threatened the fugitives andsolely
from consideration of humanity, theywere
afforded shelter by our
nnv£.^™?"n
and when afterwards demanded under our
treaty of extradition with Salvador for trial
on charges of murder, arson, and robbery,
I directed that such of them as had not
voluntarily left the ship be conveyed^ to
one of our nearest ports, where a hearing
could be had before a judicial offlcw in
compliance with the terms of the treaty.
On their arrival. at Snn Francisco such a
proceeding was promptly instltuted before
the United States district judge, whoheld
that the acts constituting the alleged of
fenses were political, and discharged all
the accused except one. Clenfuegos, who
was held for an attempt to murder. There
upon I was constrained to direct his release,
for the reason that an attempt to murder
was not one of the crimes charged against
him and upon which his surrender to the
Salvadorean authorities had been demand
ed.
Differences "With Spain.
Unreasonable and unjust fines imposed by
Spain on the vessels and commerce of the
United States have demanded from time
to time during the last twenty years earn
est remonstrance on the part of our- gov
ernment. In the immediate past exorbitant
penalties have been Imposed upon our ves
sels and goods by customs authorities ot
Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical errors of
the most trivial character in the manifests
or bills of lading. In some cases nnea
amounting to thousands of dollars have
•been levied upon cargoes of the carrying
vessels when the goods In question were
entitled to free entry. Fines have been ex
acted even when the error had been de
tected and the Spanish authorities notified
before the arrival of the goods in port.
This conduct Is In strange contrast with the
considerate and liberal treatment extended
the Spanish vessels and cargoes In our
ports In like cases. No satisfactory set
tlement of these vexatious questions has
vet been reached.
The Mora case, referred to in my last
annual message, remains unsettled. From
the diplomatic correspondence on this sub
ject which has been laid before the senate,
It will be seen that this government has
offered to conclude a convention with Spain,
for disposal by arbitration of outstanding
claims between the two conntrles, except
the Mora claim, which, having been long
ago adjusted, nor only awaits payment as
stipulated, and of course it could not be In
cluded In the proposed convention. It was
hoped that this offer would remove parlia
mentary obstacles encounter"-! by the Rnan
lph government In providing payment of
the Mora indemnity. I retrret to snv that
no definite reply to this offer has yet been
made, and all efforts to secure "payment of
this settled claim have been unavailing.
Americans in Armenia.
In mv last annual message I adverted to
the claim on the part of Turkey of the
right to expel, as persons undeslrnble and
dangerous. Armenians naturalized In the
United States and returning to Turkish
jurisdiction. Numerons questions In this re
lation have arisen. "While this government
ncqulcsces In the asserted right of expul
sion, It will not consent that Armenians
may be i'mnrlsoned or otherwise punished
for no other reason than having acquired,
without Imnerlal consent. American citizen
ship. Three of the assailants of Miss "Mel
ton, an American teacher in Mosul, have
been convicted by the Ottoman courts, and
I am advised that an appeal against the
acquittal of the remaining five has been
taken by the Turkish prosecuting officer.
A convention hns been concluded with
Venezuela for the arbitration of long-dls
puterf claim growing out of the seizure of
certain vessels, the property of citizens of
the United States. Althonih slened. the
treaty of. extradition with Venezuela is not
yet In force, owing to the insistence of that
government that, when surrendered, its cit
izens shall In no case be liable to capital
punishment.
The rules for the prevention of collisions
at sea. which were framed by the mari
time conference held In this city In 1880.
having l"en concurrently Incorporated In
the statutes of the United States and Great
Britain, have been announced to take effect
March 1. 1S0.". and Invitations have been
extended to nil maritime nations to adhere
to them. Favorable responses have thus far
been received from Austria, France, Portu
gal, Spain and Sweden.
Ah to Snmon.
In my last annual message I referred
briefly to the unsatisfactory state of affairs
In Samoa under the operation of the Berlin
treaty as sljfnnlly Illustrating the policy of
entangling nl'lances with foreign powers,
and on Mav Otli. 1894. In response to a reso
lution of tiie sennte. sent a special message
nnd documents to thnt body on the same
subject, which emphasized my previously
expressed opinions. Tater occurrences, the
correspondence In r^rrnrd to which will
be laid before congress, further demonstrate
that the government which was devised by
nrttrofo nn* forced T1DOT1 Stt*
moans against their Inveterate hostility can
be maintained only by the continued pres
ence of foreign military force at no small
sacrifice of life and treasure.

TKE ARMY.
Some Changes Are Considered Very
Desirable.
From the report of the secretary of war
it appears that the strength of the army
on Sept. 30, 1804, was 2,135. officers and
25,765 enlisted men. Although this is ap
parently a very slight decrease compared
with the previous yenr, the actual effectiye
force has been increased to the equivalent
of nearly two regiments through the re
organization of the system of recruiting
and the consequent release to regimental
duty of the large force of men hitherto
serving at the recruiting depots. The nbol
ltlon of these depots, it is predicted, will
furthermore effect an annual reduction an
proxlmatlne $250,000 In the direct expendi
tures. besides promoting generally the
health, morals nnd discipline of the troops.
Increase Its Strength.
"While the maximum legal strength of the
army Is 25,000 men. the effective stength,
for various causes, is but little over 20,000
men. Thy purpose of congress does not
therefore seem to be fully attained by the
existing condition. While no considerable
increase In the army is in my judgment
demanded by recent events, the policy of
sea coast fortification, in the prosecution of
which we have been steadily engaged for
some years, has so far developed as to sug
gest that the effective strength of the army
be now made at least equal to the legal
strength. Measures taken by the depart
ment during the year as indicated have al
ready considerably augmented the effective
force, nnd the secretary of war presents a
plan which I recommend to the consideration
of congress to attain the desired end. Econ
omies effected in the department in other
lines of its work will offset to a great extent
the expenditure involved in the proposition
submitted. Among other things this con
templates the adoption of the three bat
talllon formation of regiments which for
several years has been indorsed by the see
retnrles of war and the generals commanding
the nrmy. Compact in itself, it provides a
skeleton organization ready to be filled out
In the event of war which is peculiarly
adapted to our strength and requirements:
and the fact that every nation, with a^lugle
exception, hns adopted this formation to
meet the condition of modern warfare should
alone secure for the recommendation an
early conspiration.
The Recent Strike.
It is hardly neccessary to recall the fact
that In obedience to the commands of the
constitution nnd the laws and for the pur
pose of protecting the property of the
United States, aiding the process of federal
courts and removing lawless obstructions to
the performance by the government of its
legitimate functions it. became necessary in
various localities during the year to em
ploy a considerable portion of the regular
troops. The duty was discharged promptly,
courageously and with marked discretion by
the officers and men and the most gratify
ing proof was thus afforded that the army
deserves that complete confidence in Its
efficiency nnd discipline which the couutry
has at all times manifested.
TEe year has been free from disturbances
by Indians, and the chances of further dep
redations on their part are constantly be
coming more remote and improbable.
The total expenditures for the war de
partment for the year ended Juue 30, 1894,
amounted to $06,039,009.34. Of this sum
$2,000,664.99 was for salaries and contin
gent expenses $23,665,lw6.16 for the sup
port of the military establishment $5,001,
6S2.23 for miscellaneous objects and $23,
371,555.96 for public works. This latter
sum Includes $19,494,037.49 for river nnd
harbor Improvements and $3,947,863.56 for
fortifications and other works of defense.
The appropriations for the current year ag
gregate $52,429,112.78 aud the estimates
submitted by the secretary of war for the
next fiscal year call for appropriations
amountln.tr to $52.318,629.50.
The Citizen Soldiers.
The total enrollment of the militia of the
several states is 117,533 officers and enlist
ed men, an increase of 5,340 over the num
ber reported at the close of the previous
year.
The report of elections by regular army
officers show a marked increase In interest
and efficiency among the state organizations
nnd I strongly recommend continuance of
the policy of affording very practical en
couragemeut possible to this Important aux
iliary of our military establishment.
The condition of the Apache Indians, held
as prisoners by tho government for eight
years at a cost of half a million. dollars,
lias been changed during the year from cap
tivity to one which gives thciu an opportu
nity to demonstrate their capacity for self
support and "at least partial civilization,
legislation enacted at tho late session of
congress gave the war department authority
to transfer the survivors, numbering 346,.
from Mount Vernon barracks, in AlntiaJ^a,
to any sultnble reservation. The depart
ment selected as their future home the
military lands near Fort Sill, Indian Terri
tory, where, under military surveillance, the
former prisoners have been established In
agricultural pursuits under conditions fa
vorable 'to their advancement.
In recognition of the long and distinguish
ed military services aud faithful discharge
of delicate and responsible civil duties by
Maj. Gen. John M. Schofleld, now the gen
eral commanding the army. It is suggested
to congress that the temporary revival of
the grade of lieutenant general in his behalf
would be a just and generous act, and
would permit his retirement, now neur at
hand, with rank befitting his merits.
OLXEY'S DEPARTMENT.
The Circuit Court of Appeals Proves
a Succcsm.
The report of the attorney general notes
the gratifying progress made by the su-
fireme
court in overcoming the arrears of
ts business and in reaching a condition in
which It will be able to dispose of cases
as they arise without any unreasonable
delay. This result is, of course, very largely
due to the successful working of the plan
Inaugurating circuit courts of appeals. In
respect to these tribunals the suggestion
is made, In quarters entitled to the highest
consideration, that an additional circuit
judge for each circuit would greatly
strengthen these courts and the confidence
reposed in their adjudications, nnd that such
an nddition would not create a greater
force of judges than the increasing business
of such courts requires. I commend the
suggestion to the careful consideration of
congress. Other important topics are ad
verted to in the report accompanied by
recommendations, many of which have been
trerited at large in previous messages nnd
at this time therefore need only be named.
I refer to the abolition of the fee sys
tem as a measure of compensation to federal
officers the enlargement of the powers of
United States commissioners at least In
the territories, the allowance of writs of
error In criminal cases on behalf of the
United States and the establishing of de
grees In the crime of murder. A topic dealt
with by the attorney general of ranch Im
portance is the condition of the administra
tion of justice In the Indian territory. The
permanent solution of what Is called the
Indian problem is probably not to be ex
pected at once, bnt meanwhile such amelior
ations of present conditions as the system
will admit of. ought not to be neglected.
I am satisfied there should be a federal
court established for the territory, with suf
flelent judges, and that this court should
sit within the territory nnd should have
jurisdiction as to territorial affairs as now
vested in the federal courts sitting In Ar
kansas and Texaq.
Debtn of Pacific Roads.
Another subject of pressing moment ro
fered to by the attorney general Is the re
organization of the Union Pacific Railway
company on a basis equitable as regards all
private Interests and "as favorable to the
government as existing condltons will per
mit. The operation of a railroad by court
through a receiver Is an anomalous state of
things which should be terminated, on all
grounds public and private, at the earliest
possible moment. Besides, not to enact the
needed ennbling legislation at the present
session postpone tho whole matter until the
assembling of new congress and inevitably
Increases ail the complications of the situa
tion. and conid not but be regarded as a
signal failure to solve a problem which hns
practically been before the present con
gress ever since its organization.
Eight years ago In my annual message I
urged upon the congress as strongly as I
could the location nnd construction of two
prisons for the confinement of United States
prisoners. .A similar recommendation has
been mnde from time to time since, and a
lew years ago a law was nnssed nrovtriin*
for the selection of sites for ttiree saeh in
stitutions No appropriation hns, however,
been made to carry this act tnto effect, and

.\ POSTOFFICE AFFAIRS
A Change in Second-Clans Rates Is
Recommended.
The report of the postmaster general pre
sents a comprehensive statement of the
operations of the" postofflce department for
the last fiscal year. The receipts of the
department during the year amounted to
$75,0S0,479.04 and the expenditures $84,324,
414.15.
The transactions of the. postal service In
dicate with barometric certainty the fluctua
tions In .the business of the country. Inas
much, therefore, as business complications
continue to exist throughout the last year
to the unforseen extent, it is not surprising
that the deficiency of revenue to meet the
expenditures of the postoffice department,
which was estimated In advance at about
eight million dollars, should be exceeded by
nearly one and one quarter million dolinrs.
The ascertained revenues of the last year,
which were the basis of calculation for tho
current year, being less than estimated, the
deficiency for the current year will be cor
respondingly greater, though the postmaster
general states that the latest Indications
are so favorable that he confidently pre
dicts an increase of at least 8 per cent in
the revenues of the current year over those
of the last year. The expenditures increase
steadily and necessarily with the growth nnd
needs of the country, so that the deficiency
Is greater or less In any year depending upon
the volume of receipts.
Unnecessary Deficiency, its!
The postmaster general states that this
deficiency Is unnecessary and might be ob
viated at once if the lnw regulating rates
npon mall matter of the second class was
modified. The rate received for the trans
mission of this second-class matter is 1 per
cent per pound, while the cost of such
transmission to the government is eight
times that amount. In the general terms of
the law this rate covers newspapers and
periodicals. The extensions of the meaning
of these terms from time to time have ad
mitted to the privileges intended for legiti
mate newspapers and periodicals a surpris
ing range of publications and created abuses
the cost of which in the aggregate to the
total deficiency of the postoffice department.
Pretended newspapers are started by busi
ness houses for the mere purpose of adver
tising goods, complying with the law In
formality and discontinuing the publications
as soon as the period of advertising Is over.
"Sample copies" of pretended newspapers
are Issued In great numbers for like pur
pose only. The result Is a great loss to the
government, besides its humiliating use as
an agency to aid In carrying out the scheme
of a business house to advertise its goods
by means of a trick upon both its rival
houses and the regular and legitimate news
papers. Paper covered literature, consist
ing mainly of trashy novels, to the ex
tent of many thousands of tons. Is sent
through the mails at one cent per pound,
while the publishers of standard works are
required to pay eight times that amount
In Bendlnsr their nnti'Ications. Another
abuse consists In the free carriage through
the mailp of hundreds of tons of seed and
grain uselessly distributed through the de
partment of agricnltflre. The postmaster
general predicts that if the law be so amend
ed as to eradicate these abuses not only will
the postoffice department
Show no Deficiency,
but he believes that in the near future ail
legitimate newspapers and periodical-mag
azines might be properly transmitted
through the mails to their destination free
of cost. I Invite your prompt consideration
of this subject and ful!y indorse the views
of the postmaster general.
The total number of postoffices in the
United States on June 30. 1894, was 69,800.
an increase of 1.403 over the preceding year.
Of these 3,426 were presidential, an Increase
in that class of 58 over the preceding year.
Tho postmaster general renews the sug
gestion made in a previous report that the
department organization be increased to tlie
extent of creating a direct district super
vision of all postal affairs, and In this
suggestion I fully concur.
'xhere are now connected with the post
office establishment 32,661 employes who
ire in the ciassifled service. This includes
many who have been classified upon the
suggestion of the postmaster^jeneral. He
states that another year's experience at the
head of the department .serves only to
strengthen the conviction as to the excellent
working of the civil service law in th.s
branch of the public service.
THE NEW NAVY.
A Gratlfyingr Free: ess in the Con
struction of Shiiis.
Attention is called to the report of the
secretary of the navy, which shows very
gratifying progress in the construction of
ships for our new navy. All the vessels now
building, Including the three torpedo boats
authorized at the last session of congress
Hied excepting the lirst-class battle-ship
Iowa, will probably be completed during
the coming fiscal year.
The estimates tor the Increase of the nnvy
for the year ending June 30, 1896, are large,
but they include practically the entire sum
necessary to complete and equip all new
ships not now in commission, so that un
less new 6hips are authorized the appro
priations for the navy service for the
fiscal year ending Jnue 30, 1897, should
fall below the estimates for the coming
year Dy at least $12,000,000,
More Ships Needed.
The secretary presents with much earnest
ness a plea for the authorization of three
additional buttle-shlps and ten or twelve
topedo boats. While the unarmed vessels
heretofore authorized, including those now
nearing completion, will constitute a fleet
which it is believed Is sufficient for ordinary
cruising purposes in time of peace, we have
now completed and In process of construc
tion but four first-class battle-ships and but
few torpedo boats. If we are to have a
navy for warlike operations, offensive nnd
defensive, we certainly ought to increase
both the number of battle-ships and tor
pedo boats.
The manufacture of armor requires ex
pensive plant and the aggregation of many
skilled workmen. All the armor necessary
to complete the vessels now building will
be delivered before the first of June next.
If no new contracts are given out, contract
ors must disband their workmen aud their
plants must lie idle. Battie-shlps. author
ized at this time would not be well under
way until lnte in the coming fiscal year,
and at least three years and a half from
tlie date of tlie contract would be required
for their completion. The secretary states
that not more than 15 per cent of the cost
of such shipments need be luc'.uded in the
appropriations for the coming year.
I recommend that provision be made for
the construction of additional battleships
and torpedo boats. The secretary recom
mends the manufacture not only of reserve
supply of ordnance and ordnance material
for ships of the navy, but also a supply for
the auxiliary fleet. Guns nnd their appur
tenances should be provided nnd kept on
hand for both these purposes. We have not
to-day a single guu that could bo put 011 the
ships Paris or New York, of the Interna
tional Navigation company, or any other
ship of our reserve navy. The manufacture
of guns at the Washington nnvy yard is
proceeding satisfactorily, and none of our
new ships will be required to wait for their
guns or ordnance equipment.
IIOKE SMITH'S WORK.
Recommendations RegnrdlnK Public
Lands, Pensions and Patents.
Tho report of tho secretary of the in
terior exhibits the situation of the numer
ous and interesting branches of the public
service connected with his department. I
commend this report nnd the valuable rec
ommendations »f the secretary to the care
ful attention of the congress.
The public land disposed of during the
year amounts to 10.406.100.77 acres, Includ
ing 28,876,05 of Indian linds. It Is estimat
ed that the public domain still remaining
amounts to a little more than 6OO.OC1O.OOO
acres excluding, however, about 360,000.000
acres In Alaska as well as military reserva
tions and railroad and other selections of
lands yet unadjudicated.
The total cash receipts from the sale of
lands amounted to $2,674,285.79, including
$91,981.03 received from the sale of Indian
lands.
Thirty-five thousand patents were Issued
for agricultural lands and one hundred pa
tents were Issued to Indians on allotments
of their holdings in severalty, the laud so al
loted being in a liennble by the Indian nl
lottees for a period of twenay-five years af

There were certified and patented on ac
count of railroad nnd wagon grants, during
the year S65.506.40 acres of land and at the
close of the year 29,0000,OCtJ were embraced

Public Lands
The selections of swamp lands and that
taken as indemnity therefor, since the pas
sage of the net providing for the same in
1849 amount to nearly or quite 80,500,000
acres, of which 59,000,000 have been patent
ed to states. About 138,000 acres were pa
tented during the last year. Nearly 820,000
acres of school and education grants were
approved during the year, and at Its close
1,250,363.81 acres remained unadjusted.
It appears that the appropriation for the
current year on account of special service
for the protection of the public lands iind
the timber thereon is much less than thoso
for previous years aud Inadequate for an ef
ficient performance of the work. A larger
sum of money than has been appropriated
during a number of years past on this ac
count has been returned to ihe government
as a result of the labors of those employ
ed in the particular servlcc mentioned and
I hope It will not be crippled by insufficient
appronriatlon.
I fully endorse the recommendation of the
secretary that adequate rotectlon be pro
vided for our forest reserves and that a com
prehensive forestry system be Inaugurated.
Such keepers and superintendents as are
necessary to protect the forest already re
served should be provided. I am of the
opinion that there should be an abandon

laws under which the government for a
very small consideration Is rapidly losing

timber which should be properly reserved

The Indian Problem.
Though the condition of the Indians shows
a steady and healthy progress, their situa
tion Is not satisfactory at all points. Some
of them to whom allotments of land have

inclined to follow agricultural pursuits or
otherwise beneficially manage their land.

CIVIL
SERVICE.
The Presldent Pleased With tho Re
form—Public Health and Labor.
The advantages of the public service of
an adherence to the principles of civil serv
ice reform are constantly more apparent
and nothing Is so encouraging to those in
official life who honestly desire good gov
ernment as the increasing appreciation by
our people of thetse advantages. A vast
majority of the voters of the land are ready
t« Insist that the time and attention of
those they select to perform for them the
more important public duties should not
be distracted by dealing out minor offices
and they are growing to be unanimous
in regarding party organization as something
that sh'ould be used in establishing' party
principles instead of dictating the distribu
tion of public places as rewards of parti
san activity.
Numerous additional offices and places
have lately been brought within civil service
rules and regulations, and some others will
probably soon be included. The report of
the commissioners will be submitted to
the congress and I Invite careful attention
to the recommendations it contains.
The Labor Commission.
By virtue of a statute of the United States
passed in 1888, I appointed in July last
Hon. John I). Kernan, of the State of New
York, and Hon. Nicholas E. Worthlngton,
of the State of Illinois, to form with Hon.
Carroll D. Wright, commissioner of labor,
who was designated by said statute a com
mission for the purpose of making careful
inquiry Into the causes of the controversies
between certain railroads and their employes
which has resulted In an extensive and
destructive strike, accompanied by much
violence and dangerous disturbance with
considerable loss of life and great destruc
tion of property.
The report of the commissioners has been
submitted to me and will be transmitted tn
the congress with the evidence taken upon
their investigation. Their work has been
well done and their standing and intelligence
give assurance that the report aud sugges
tions they make are worthy of careful con
sideration.
thkTtahiff.
The President Considers tire Mutter
Not Yet Settled.
The tariff act passed at the last session of
the congress needs important amendments
If It Is to be executed effectively and with
certainty. In addition to such necessary
amendments as will change rates of duty,
I am still very decidedly in favor of put
ting coal and iron upon the free list.
So far as the sugar schedule Is concerned,
I would be glad under existing aggravations
to see every particle of differential duty in
favor of refined sugar stricken out of our
tariff lnw. If with all the favor now ac
corded the sugar refining interest in our
tariff laws it still languishes to the ex
tent of closing refineries and discharging
thousands of workmen it would seem to
present a hopeless case for reasonable leg
islative aid.
Whatever else Is done or omitted I earnest
ly repeat the recommendation made in an
other portion of this communication that
the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent
per pound laid upon sugar imported from
countries paying a bounty on its export be
abrogated. It seems to me that exceedingly
Important considerations point to the pro
prletl of this amendment.
With the advent of a new tariff policy not
only calculated to relieve the consumers of
our land In the cost of their daily life, but
invite a betetr development oi American
thrift and create for us closer nnd more
profitable commercial relations with the rest
of the world, it follows as a logical and im
perative necessity that we should at once
remove the chief if not the only obstacle
which has so long prevented our participa
tion in the foreign carrying trade of the sea.
A tariff built upon the theory that It is well
to check imports aud that a home market
6hould bound the industry and efforts 6t
American producers was fitly supplemented
by a refusal to allow American registry- to
vessels built abroad though owned and
navigated by our people thus exhibiting a
willingness to abandon all contests for the

MORK BONDS.
The President Says They Will Be
Issncd an Often as Necessary.
During the last month the gold reserved
in the treasury for the purpose of redeem
ing the notes of the government circulating
now in the hands of the people became so
reduced, and Its further depletion in the
near fn-'ire seemed so certain that In the
exoi.iM.' of proper care for the public wel
fare It became necessary to replenish the
reserve «nd thus maintain popular faith in
the ability anu determination of the gov
ernment to meet, as agreed. Its pecuniary
obligations.
It would have been well if In this emer
gency authority had existed to issue the
bonds of the government bearing a low rate
of interest and maturing within a short
period, but the congress having failed to
confer such authority resort was necessarily
had to the resumption act ot 1875, and pur
suant to Its provisions bonds were Issued
drawing interest at the rate of 5 per cent
per annum and maturing ten years after
their Issue, that being the shortest time au
thorized by the net. I am glad to t-ay. how
ever, tli4\t on the sale of these bonds the
premium received operated to reduce the
rate of interest to be paid by the govern
ment to less than 3 per cent.
Nothing could be worse or further re
moved from sensible finance than the rela
tionss existing between the currency, the
govrnment has Issued, tlie gold held for its
redemption and the menn.s which must be
resorted to for the purpose of replenishing
such redemption fund when impaired. Even
if the claims upon this fund were confined
to the obligations originally intended nnd
if the redemption of these obligations menu
their cancelation, the fund would be very
small. But Jhese obligations when received
and redeemed in gold are not canceled, but
nre reissued nnd may do duty many times
bv way of drawing gold from the .y.-isnry.
A Plan Suggested by Secrc' ary Car
lisle Is Endorsed.
&uestlcns relating to our banns and cur
rencv are closely connected with the sub
ject'just. referred to and they ilso present
some unsatisfactory .features Prominent
among them are the lack of ela tielty In our
currency circulation aud its frequent con
centration in financial centerr when it Is
most needed in our pnrte of ne country.
The absolute divorcement the govern
ment from the business of b-tnblng is the
ideal relationship of the government to the
circulation of the currency the country.
This condition cannot me Immediately reach
ed, but as a step In that direction and as a
means of securing a more ciastic currency
and obviating other objections to the pres
ent arrangement of bank circulation, the
secretary of the treasury presents in his re
port a scheme modifying present bank laws
and providing for the Issue of circulating
notes by state banks free from taxxtlon un

The secretary explains his plan so plain

In Its support would be superclllious. I

unqualified indorsement of the secretary's
proposed changes '.n the law and a brief
and imperfect statement of their prominent

I conclude this communication fully appre
