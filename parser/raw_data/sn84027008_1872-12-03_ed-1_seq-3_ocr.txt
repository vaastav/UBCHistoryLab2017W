Paris, November 3Q.~Iu the National
Assembly, this afternoon, before the
miaotes of the previous sitting were rati?
fied, M; Baragho, a Conservative deputy,
protested against the vote of yesterday
oh the'resolution of MiniBtor Dnfaurs
being recorded, because several of the
deputies were absent, and he did not be?
lieve the result was a fair expression of
the will of the Assembly. M. Batbil
said ho considered that the vote elo?
quently demonstrated on which side
Conservative policy could bo found.
This remark gave riso to groat excite?
ment in the chamber. Many deputies
protested againBt the language of M.
Batbil, aud recriminations passod back?
ward and forward between the opposing
- parties. A deputy from PariB ques?
tioned the Government iu relation to
encouragiug addresses which had boon
sent to Thiers by muuicipal councils
during the present controversy. He
accused the Government of conniving at
and inciting them. M. Lefrano, Minis?
ter of the Interior, warmly defended the
notion of the Government in receiving
the addresses, and announced that, he
accepted for himself the prinoiplo of
ministerial responsibility. [The agita
? tion in the chamber here bsoame very
great.] SI. Suva! made a violent attack
upon the Government; henceforth, ho
said, neither the OrleahiBts, Bonapartists
i or Legitimists will exist, but all. parties
. will unite to arrest the fatal descent of
the country. . He continued at length in
.? a violent strain, and concluded by mov?
ing a resolution declaring that the muni?
cipal council had violated the laws of the ,
country, und that Lefranb, iu receiving
- the-addresses for the President, had also
failed to observe them. Amid much ex?
citement, the Assembly, .proceeded to
vote'on the matter, and it was approved,
by a Vote of . 35 yeas againBt 299 nays.
The result caused a great sensation in
the chamber, aud the sitting wa3 imme?
diately brought to a close. Throughout
the entire debate, party feeling was in
flamed to the highest pitchy Tho gloom?
iest impressions prevail this evening in
A Paris. ? It .ia believed i that it will be im?
possible for President' Thiers to govern
: the country under present oirou instances.
The monarchists declare that they will
oppose Thiers to the bitter, end, unless
I he disavows- all responsibility for the
: course of Gambetta.
I P. SI.? It is ?nno?naad this evening
! that Lefrano has 'tendered his resigna?
tion to the- President. The Ministers
ore now closeted with Thiers.

tempted to call np oivil rights, but was
stopped by tbo rules. Tho choplnius
mentioned Greoley in- their prayers.
Tho House refused to accept Banks'
resignation from the Chairmanship of
tho Foroign Committee. Pending a
resolution regarding the Credit Mobilier,
Blaino called S. S. Cox to tho chair, and
the resolution as now before tho House
is, that tho temporary chairman, S. S.
Cox, Democrat, announce tho commit
too. Both Houses recessed to half-past
1, when the messago will bo road.
After a short recess, the President's
message was, at 1.'10, received and road.
It oommenoes with a recognition of the
blessings whioh tho Amoricnn peoplo
have enjoyod within the past year, tho
only exception being tho great fire in
Boston. It rofers to tho Geneva arbitra?
tion and its satiafaotory results, whioh
loft tho two Govornmonts of America
aud England without a shadow on their
friendly relations, which it ia sincerely
hoped .may lor aver. joewain ..eo^ajiy nn^
oloaded. it roooramonds the immediate
creation of a board of commissioners to
decide on the amounts to be paid to
claimants. K .compliments Mr. Adams
ancTMr. Banoroft for their eminent aer
rices in the matter of the Geneva and
the San Juan arbitrations; the decision
in the latter case leaving the United
States, for the first time, without any
question as to disputed boundaries.
In regard to the fisheries and to our
i relations with the British North Ameri
! aan provinces, the President says that
he has received notice that the Imperial
Parliament and the Dominion Govern
ment had passed laws to carry the pro?
visions of the treaty of Washington into
operation, and he therefore recommends
legislation by Congress in tho same
direction. Bfe speaks of the friendly re?
lations of tho United States with all the
governments of Europe. He refers to
?the Vienna . international exposition,
recommends . the fitting up of two na
tional vessels to convey the goods of ex?
hibitors to Trieste, and suggests that a
proposition be made to have the next
great exposition in this country, in 1876,
at the time of tho centennial celebration
in Philadelphia. He refers to the dis?
turbed condition of Cuba, and Buys that
no advance towards pacification iu that
islaud has been made, while the insur?
rection.! bed gained a no -. advantages and
exhibited no more of tho elements of
power, or prospective success than a year
ago, neither had Spain suoceeded in re?
pressing the insurrection. The parties
to the*strife were standing in the same
atiitudo as for a long time past. -The
continuation of: slavery in that island he
regards as among the strongest oatises of
the continuance of the strife;'and he
thinks that the aboltlon of slavery and
the institution .of other 'reforms there,
could not fail to advance the restoration i
of peaoe and order. It was greatly to he
hoped that tbe present liberal Goverrr?
ment of Spain will voluntarily adopt that
view.
Referring to our relations with China
and Japan, the .f resideut rccommeuds
provisions for maiutaining four Ameri?
can youths in each of those countries, as
part of the diplomatic- family of minis?
ters! He gives details of the revenue
received iu the past year, and of the re?
duction to the amount of over $100,
000,000 of the. public debt. He ex?
presses a doubt whether any further
redaction in taxation is practicable for
the present, nud ho reoommeuds that no
more legislation bo had on that subject,
except to oorreot errors of omission or
commission iu tho present laws, until
sufficient time shall have elapsed to
prove that it can be done, and still leave
sufficient revenne to meet current ex?
penses, pay interest on the public debt,
und provide for the sinking fund. He
suggests, ulso, that the ourrency shall be,
as soon as possible, brought to a par
with gold.
He says that various enterprises will
be brought to the attention of Congress
for the cheapening of transportation of
produce from the West to the Atlantic
Beacoaat, and suggests that steps should
be taken to gain all available informa?
tion to insure equitable and judicious
legislation. In this conneotiou, he re?
fers favorably to tbo proposed route to
connect tbe Mississippi Valley with the
Atlantio at Charleston and Savaunah,
by way of the Ohio and Tennessee
Bivers; also, to the proposed extension
of the Kanuwha and James Biver Canal
and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and
to the proposed canal around Niagara
Falls. He says that there should be an
almost continuous system of land-locked
navigation from Maine to tho Gulf of
Mexico.?nature having provided greater
part of - the- route, and tho obstacles to
be overcome being within tho skill tof
engineers..- Me oalis uttention to the
weakness of the American navy, and en?
dorses the recommendation of tho Secre?
tary of tbe Navy iu that respect. He re?
commends subsidies for steamship lines
to Brazil and between San Francisco,
New Zealand and Australia. Also, in?
crease of tho salaries of heads of bu?
reaus.
He favor's the abolition of the franking
privilege, and recommends a modifica?
tion of its existing evils. He also recom?
mends the adoption by Congress of the
best method of acquiring title to all tele?
graphic lines now in operation, and oon
uocting that service with the postal ser?
vice. It is not probable that the subject
can receive proper consideration at this
session, but he thinks tho movement
might be iuitiated, so that fnturo action
may be had, fair to the Government and
tbo private parties nonoerned. Ho calls
attention to tho ularming falling off in
the American carrying trade, nod says
that a yearly expenditure of $5,000,000
for tho next five years to restore that
trade, would bo a profitable investment.
Referring to the Ku Klux outrages, the
President expresses his conviction that
tho time is not far distant when tho ob-,
vious advantages of good order and
peaco will induce an abandonment of all
such combinations, and when it will bo
unnecessary to carry on prosecutions or
to inflict punishment in ordor to protect
oitizous from tho lawless doings of such
combinations. He makes suggestions in
regard to the Indians, that they shall nil
bo confined to the territory South of
Kansas, and that farms be secured to
them in fee aud in severalty.
Ho recommends that a farthor census
bo taken in 1875, but that no ro appor
tionmont of members of Congress bo
mado under it. In only one of the Ter?
ritories (Utah) is tho oondition of affairs
regarded by the President as unsatisfac?
tory. It had scorned to bo tho polioy of
tho Utah Legislature to evade all respon?
sibility to tho Government of tho United
States, and even to hold a position hos?
tile to it. He recommends a careful re?
vision of tho present laws, aud tho ou
aotmont of laws that will secure pence,
the equality of all citizens beforo tho
law, and tho ultimato extinguishment of
polygamy. He recommends an appro?
priation to reimburse the city of Wash
iogton for work done in front of the
public reservations, and for the embel?
lishment or the'' publ!? buildings and
grouoda. Ho favora :aqtiqn Jip ...^ivo
greater eclat and aucoeSs to tbo otTRerv
anoe of the ' centennial- anniversary of
Amorican indepondonee, In regard to
oivil service, he says ho will carry oqt
the r dl es daring hie t er or of office, bat
suggests that there shoald be direct ac?
tion of Congress to make the, system
binding on his successors, so 'as to so
ouro to the publio service a practical
method of obtaining faithful and effi
oieu' officers and employees. The read?
ing if the message was completed at
2.5( having occupied one hour and ten
.minutes.
The Treasury report says that neces?
sity exists for a new issue of national
bank notes. Tho Secretary exonerates
Assistant Treasurer Hilhouse from ne
gleot of duty in tho stamp division of
the Assistant Treasurer of New York.
The Secretary again recommends the
passage of a bill to amend aud consoli?
date the navigation and customs collect?
ing laws of the United States. As the
leading pursuits of the country aro now
stronger than ever before, in the posses
(ion of adequate capital and a supply of
intelligent laborers, there may be a mo?
derate reduction, from time to time, in
the rnto of duties, as the diminishing
expensed of Qovernment shall permit,
without either alarming capital or in?
juring labor. -He says tho oirculatiou of
the banks should be fixed and limited,
and that the power tochango the volume
of papor in circulation within the limit*
established by law should remain iu the
Treasury Department. A degree of flexi?
bility in the volume of currency is'essen?
tial for two reasons?first, the business
of the department cannot be transacted
properly if o limit is fixed, and the
power to raise the circulation above or
reduce it below that, limit ia denied; se?
condly, there is a necessity, every au?
tumn, for moving the crops without de
la}' from the South and West to tho sea
board, that they may bo on hand for
export and consumption ns wanted.
The problem is to find a way of in?
creasing tho currency for moving the
crops, nod diminishing it at onco when
that work is done. This ic a accessary
work, and inasmuch as it cannot be con?
fided to the banks, the power should bo
reposed in the Treasury Department.
Believing that the couutry is not pro
pared to sustain the policy of contrac?
tion, the Secretary considers tha means
by wbioh tho valuo of onr curreucy may
bo improved. The basis of a policy of
improvement must bo found in a sturdy
refusal to add to the paper circulation,
until it is of tho same valuo essentially
as coin. This being accepted as the set?
tled purpose of tho country, there can
be no permanent increase of the differ?
ence between paper and com; and an op?
portunity will be given for the influence
of nat ral ouuses, tending, upon tho
whole, to a better financial condition.
All legislation limited iu its operation to
the paper issues of the Government,
whether bearing- interest or not, and
which iu its effects shall tend to diminish
the market value of ooin, will -be fouud,
upon analysis, to contain a plan tor con?
tracting the volume of paper currency;
and all legislation so limited, .which does
not contain such a plan, will prove in?
effectual. Tho Secretary, without pro?
ceeding to the discussion of the generul
subject of resuming specie payments^
thinks all will have been gained that is
of valuo when tho Treasury shall be pre?
pared to pay the demand notes of the
Government iu com, und tho banks
shall be prepared to pay their notes
either in coin or legal tender notes; and
then our good fortune will clearly ap?
pear in this, that our paper currency is
not exclusively of natioual bank notes,
nor exolosively of United States notes.

tion of the Oonvention; The succeed?
ing Oonvention will, Without doubt,
make provision for a similar contingen?
