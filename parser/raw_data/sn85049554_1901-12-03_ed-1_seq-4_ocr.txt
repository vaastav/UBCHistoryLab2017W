THE MESSAGE.
The first public message of President
Roosevelt transmitted to congress to
day contained nothing of a surprise
since the new president's views upon
national problems were very well known
before he became chief executive of the
land and the policies of the McKlnloy
administration, which he had sworn to
continue, had become well established.
The message, however, was evidently
written by Mr. Roosevelt himself and
contains many suggestions that are all
his own. It is a breezy document com
pared with many state papers in that
the literary style is easy and entertain
ing and there is a positiveness about
each paragraph that Is characteristic of
the man who penned it.
The president's tribute to his prede
cessor bespeaks deep feeling on his part.
He handles the anarchist without gloves
and recommends that the crime of Czol
gosz be made treason punishable by the
severest penalty of a federal court.
Trusts are treated at length, but the
president sees In them no bug-bear. He
says that the time has come when these
institutions have outgrown our present
laws and that as many a. corporation
has become national lit its scope the
statutes regulating it should be made
national. Reciprocity and trade treaties,
the president says, are urgent in that
the continued prosperity of thte country
demands an enlargement of foreign
markets. He says that we owe a moral
obligation to Cuba to reduce our tariffs
on Cuban sugar and thinks that it
would also be a commercial gain to us
to do so.
The interoceanic caniil, the president
says, must be built and he- congratu
lates the country on the extremely fa
vorable treaty arrangement with Great
Rritain. The navy is highly commended
and congress is urged to be liberal In
building It up. The itrmy, which the
president has had reason to know to be
badly in need of reform, comes In for
discussion in detail. President Roose
velt wants the promotions from the line
tc be more frequent a:nd upon meiit
alone, so that in time of war a corps of
commanders will be In readiness to take
charge of an enlarged army. He says
olstinctly that the army 1s large enough
as it is for times of p* ace, but should
be made more efficient. Regular drills
by large bodies of troops are recom
mended.
The message contain nothing of a
Btartling nature. Everybody in tne
United States is happy and the goose
hangs high. The president does not ex
pect a general revision of the tariff nor
does he suggest it. Certain reciprocity
treaties have been negotiated with a
view to enlarging American trade and
these he thinks ought to be ratified. He
is particularly expresirtve about tne
merit system and assures the country
that all appointments In the army, navy,
foreign service and wherever possible
will be made without political favor and
advises congress to place all of the Dis
trict of Columbia under the civil service
regulations. It is a fine message In that
it is careful yet positive, clear and fear
less on all important problems, yet not
dangerous in any form of expression. It
comes from the heart of a man with a
clear head, good digestion and .a strong
arm it is a manly sort. oLa message.
CONDITIONS IN PORTO RICO.
When Porto Rico wan acquired by our
nation there were the usual misgivings
about taking foreign- and hostile terr.
tory but there is. much reason to be
lieve that the relationships will be mu
tually beneficial. Dr. N.' M. Brum
baugh, commissioner for education in
the Island, is now in this country for a
well-earned vacation and speaks in flat
tering terms of the progress made.
"With a population of 3,000,000," says he,
"the valuation at a low figure Is $100,
000,000. It might justly lie $135,000,000. Ci
gars made from Porto Rican tobacco
equal the best Cuban cigars. The to
bacco crop this year Is valued at $10,
000,000. The memorable cyclone has in
jured the usual $30,000,000 coffee crop.
The sugar crop runs into millions. Add
to this the tropical and semi-tropical
fruits and Porto Rico cannot be beaten
by and area in the world of equal size
and population.
"Free trade between Porto Rica and
ths United States gives it an immense
advantage over the neighboring islands.
Educationally we have had a good year.
The military government ended with 612
schools intermittently open we now
have 982 schools regularly open, with
50,000 pupils. One year ago there was
not one owned school building in Porto
Rico we now have thirty-six buildings
completed and In use, and twelve more
In course of erection. Including the $35,
000 Normal school. At present gover
nor Hunt loane us his summer resi
dence for this purpose.
"Fourth of July was celebrated In
American style by 20,500 children and
as many citizens. We now have 120
teaohers from the United States, but we
observe local control as far as possible.
In every school English is taught and
the people clamor for more schools and
more teachers. Our high school will
prepare for colleges in. the United

States. Mr. Carnegie has given us IJOO,
000 for a public library. We have placed
12,000 desks in the schools and furnish
all books and supplies free. We need
more money to provide for a total of
200,000 children in school. In ten years
the schools will utterly transform and
thoroughly Americanize Porto Rico."
SUPREME COURT DECISIONS.
The United Slates supreme court has
rendered a decision in the case know
us the "fourteen diamond ring case," in
volving the question of the right of the
government to put a turifC duty on
goods coming into this country from
the Philippines. The decision in this
case follows closely that of the first
Porto Rican case decided last May. The
gist of the opinion in the first case, and
which controls the Philippine contest, is,
that territory acquired In war remains
loreign during military occupation, and
up to the date of the exchange of ratifi
cations of the treaty of peace. During
that time tariffs may be levied upon Im
portations from such territory Into the
United States. After the exchange of
ratifications of the treaty of peace, how
ever, it becomes domestic territory, and
its products must have free entrance
irtn the United States until such time
as congress may determine its status
by legislation. It is thus held that con
gress has the power to legislate for such
domestic territory on this subject.
In the second Dooley case, decided at
the same time, involving the question of
duty on goods shipped from the United
States Into Porto Rico, it Is held that
such duty is permlssable, but that it is
really a tax for the benefit of Porto Ri
ans themselves rather than an export
duty, as was claimed by the merchants
who antagonized the government in the
case. To be more specific, this opinion
holds that as Forto Rico is not foreign
territory the goods shipped to Porto
Klco were not exports, but whether ex
ports or imports, the wide range of con
gressional action In the matter of taxa
tion Is sufficient for a contingency of
this character.
In these various decisions of the for
mer and present term the supreme court
judges are not agreed upon the subject,
and it is difficult for a layman to follow
nil the points and deductions made by
(hem. In fact the ablest lawyers find
it as dlflk'ult to solve as a Chinese puz
zle.
One point for which the T.-R. has con
tended appears to be confirmed, and
that is the constitution does not follow
the flag by its own force, but that con
gress must act in order to make its pro
v.'sions effective.
AN OBSTACLE IN THE PHILIPPINES.
The Now York Sun recently pointed
out two serious obstacles to the develop
ment of the Philippines. One of these
was a lack of a judicially established
status as regards the tariff. This, how
ever, has Just been removed by the de
cision of the supreme court printed in
the Times-Republican yesterday. The
Sun states, however, that—
The second and the greater obstacle
is found in the Spooner amendment, so
called. It may be remembered that in
Its original form the Spooner resolution
gave a free hand to the executive until
such time as congress should legislate
concerning the Philippines. At the In
stance of Senator Hoar, a statesman
conscientiously and consistently opposed
tc the retention of the Islands by the
United States, a precision was added
which prohibited the granting of any
franchise in the Philippines for a term
longer than one year after the estab
lishment of a permanent civil govern
ment there.
In his admirably clear report on the
present conditions in the Philippines
Secretary Root points out the extent to
which this unfortunate provision oper
ates as a limitation of enterprise in the
islands. He shows that the law as it
stands practically gives a monopoly of
business In many directions to foreign
ers as against Americans.
Congress should promptly remove this
paralyzing restriction. With proper
safeguards, the way should be opened
at- once to American enterprise and
capital. That much Is due to the Filipi
nos themselves, for they are held back
in the road of progress toward prosper
lty by the Hoar amendment to the
Spooner amendment.
Altho that amendment was accepted
last February by the committee on the
Philippines, probably In order to secure
the passage of the Indispensable main
provision, it was not conceived in a
spirit of friendship to continued Ameri
can sovereignty over the Islands. It
was part of the so-called antl-imperlal
ifrtic campaign. Congress can now af
ford to eliminate it, listening meanwhile
respectfully to Senator Hoar's protest,
If protest he does.
It is probable that congress will now
lay aside the Hoar amendment, if it is
rot already negatived by the court de
cision referred to in the opening para
graph.
IOWA OPINIONS AND NOTES.
A few days ago an editorial Item
appeared in the Ottumwa Courier re
lating to the adulteration of honey In
which it was suggested that an arti
ficial comb made of paraffine was used
to deoeive the public. A representa
tive of the honey trade or a bee cul
turist called on the Courier to refute
this statement which was made in good
faith and on apparently good author
ity, and later the Courier published a
statement from the agricultural de
partment Bhowing that those in highest
authority have no knowledge that ar
tificial comb is being used.
In noticing that by a decisive vote
the Iowa mutual insurance men in an
nual convention at Des Moines turned
down the idea of a valued policy law,
the Muscatine Journal declares, "but
this does not prove that the effort to
secure such a law will be abandoned
or that its enactment would not be
wise and just."
In stating that the board of control
has concluded to correct Its report and
strike out some of the charges against
gmrtng Tttrixs-liepMinm, TOaraltantflttm „taxra, Titesiiag, tyzamXtzt iaui
the educational institutions which have
caused such a storm to be raised, the
Council Bluffs Nonpareil urges that
"the board ought to have known that
the charges were right before making
them and thus saved themselves much
criticism and humiliation and at the
same time prevented an inustice which
correction can never fully atone for."
The Boone News Is of the opinion
that centralized township schools "is
the best thing ever proposed for the
education of farmers' children."
The Davenport Republican believes
"the day is not far distant when Cuba
will ask to be annexed to the United
States." and that "it would be fool
ish not to do so."
As to Chinese immigration the Du
buque Times expresses this opinion:
"The question the Geary law presents
is whether the interests of American
civilization lie in lowering or raising
the standard of wages In this country.
The European immigrant does not
lower It permanently. His descend
ants insist on a standard of living
that could not be maintained on the
wages out of which the Chinaman
saves a competence with which to re
turn to his native land. Ten years of
unrestricted Chinese emigration Into
this country would Intensify the labor
question immensely."
Keokuk Gate City: Michigan de
feated Iowa on Thursday by a score of
50 to 0. Iowa can not to win at foot
ball as long as it neglects to avail it
self of the best material. There is
ex-Candidate Phillips, of Ottumwa, for
instance. As a kicker he would put
the state team far and away ahead of
all competitors.
Montezuma Republican: It costs
like the mischief to live these times
Everything in the line of vegetables is
selling at outlandish prices and meats
and fruits are not far behind. Turnips,
cabbage, squashes, potatoes and the
like are all shipped in here and this
makes prices even higher than they
would have been for home grown ar
ticles. The fellow who "makes both
ends meet" this winter will be decidedly
fortunate.
TOPICS or the TIMES
A few timid flakes of snow were
seeking a good place to fall this morn
ing.
The state board of control has the
courage to acknowledge when It
wrong, which appears to be more than
some of its bitter enemies have thus far
manifested.
•..
It looks probable that, whatever may
be the opposition to the reduction of
tariff on sugar, a reciprocity arrange
ment for a lowering of the tax on the
Cuban product may be made In the in
terest of the development of trade with
the island.
You have a serious duty to perform
—that of reading the president's mes
sage.
A story that amuses the friends of
Secretary Long and Captain Lemly,
Judge Advocate General of the Navy,
concerns little Miss Lemly, who re
gards her father as about the biggest
man in the country. Her teacher, in a
talk to the scholars on current events,
asked If any one could tell who was
secretary of the navy. Little Miss
Lemly's hand was raised at once. "The
secretary of the navy," she said, "1b a
man who works in my father's office."
The state board of railroad commis
sioners in the biennial report advocate
the state supervision of trolley llnea
That would be an appropriate field for

One of the highest salaried men of

bert C. Hoover, who at the age of 29 is
in receipt of $33,000 annually for his
services as a mining expert. He was
graduated from Stanford University in
1895, after having worked his way thru
college, and has spent much of the last
five or six years in the antipodes. He
is said to have sold his shares In the
Chinese Engineering and Mining Com
pany, of which he was for a time gen
eral manager, for nearly $500,000. He
says that the stories of rich gold mines
in North China are apocryphal, but
that China is the greatest coal pro
ducing country in the world.
Some heavily insured men in Kansas
are C. J. Devlin, of Topeka, who carries

James Derrig, of Akron, O., who pre
viously possessed a strong voice, is
said to have been completely bereft of
speech thru fright. He was visited
by burglars a week ago, and, at last re

then.
J. M. Longyear, of Marquette, Mich.,
who built himself a palatial home, at a
cost of $500,000 in that city, has be
come so embittered againBt the city for
allowing a railroad to run so near his
property that he will remove the house,
stone by stone, to Boston, which project
will cost almost as much as the house
itself cost originally.
According to the Canadian Gazette,
a woman in England said not long ago
to one who came from the city of Que
bec, "I suppose you frequently see the
Falls of Niagara." "Oh, yes," was the
reply, "I often take a morning walk
there before breakfast," adding, "It Is
only about five hundred miles." Ac
cording to another story, at the time of
the Queen's jubilee in London a lady
of rank sent an invitation for a garden
party to some Canadians. It was a
very pleasant letter and very kindly ex
pressed, and she ended by saying,
"Please come in your native dress."

this is the first time that a book has
ever been dedicated !n such way.

MR. ANDREW CARNEGIE AT PLAY.
In Harmsworth's Magazine for Oc
tober Mr. W. T. Stead contributes a
character sketch of Mr. Andrew Car
negie. The modern millionaire, as Mr.
Stead remarks, is not a typically
happy man. But, he says, "With Mr.
Carnegie it is altogether different. I
do not remember any man, either rich
or poor, whose face is so contsantly ir
radiated with a happy, complacent
smile. After all, whether we build In
marble on a great estate, or make mud
pies in the street, the material does not
make much difference to the enjoyment
you get out of the occupation, and
probably we could hardly give Mr. Car
negie's temperament higher praise than
to say that he enjoys the building of
shooting lodges and the making of
roads with as keen a zest as the street
urchins feel in damming a gutter or
turning cartwheels in the roadway."
Mr. Carnegie seems never to do any
thing except he does it well. 'He writes
seldom, but he has never published an
article which was not a model of lu
cidity, free from all affectation or any
attempt at fine writing." Mr. Morley
Is his favorite modern man of letters
but his philosopher is Herbert Spencer.
Speaking of Mr. Carnegie's mountain
ous correspondence Mr. Stead says:
"Mr. Carnegie is almost as sparing
in his letters as Mr. Rhodes. There
descends upon Skibo Castle from all
parts of the world a daily deluge of
hundreds of epistles, from all sorts and
conditions of men and women, pro
pounding all manner of methods by
millions might be utilized for the bene
fit of the world in general, and us
ually for the benefit of the let
ter-writer in particular. Of these
hundreds of letters Mr. Carnegie does
not see tens."
Of Mr. Carnegie's relations to his
tenantry Mr. Stead gives a pleasant
picture:
"He is among his retainers a man
among men. To all the rest of the
world he is the owner of the modern
Fortunatus' purse, but them he is
simply Andrew Carnegie, who is al
ways in and out among them, pottering
on about this thing and that thing,
keenly interested in all that is going
on around him, and always ready to
second any of the many benevolent
wishes of 'Madam,' his wife."
"Madam," as Mr. Carnegie calls his
wife and the mother of "Little Missy,"
his only child, is about as little known
as la possible in the case of the wife of
so well known a man. Mr. Stead says:
'Nothing,' Mrs. Carnegie told me,
'has ever been written about me, even
In the American press,' and she sincere
ly hoped that nothing ever would be,
either in America or here. 'All that you
can say of me, if you want to say any
thing,' she said, laughing, 'is that I am
the unknown wife of a very well-known
man.' 'But you must add,' said Mr. Car
negie, as he overheard her remark, 'that
she is, nevertheless, the power behind
the throne.'
LOOKER-ON IN IOWA.
For theTlmes-Renubllcan.
Danbury, Dec. 2.—Residents of Sioux
City admit that "there is from seventy
five to 100 cases of smallpox In town."
And It must be admitted they take lt aa
a dispensation of Providence, therefore
it's useless to repine. The system of
quarantine at home is in vogue, and the
yellow placard on the front door does
not create any panicky feeling on the
passers-by. One doctor tells this story
as illustrating how little the afflicted
really realize what quarantine means:
A young lady "all broken out" was at
work on a bit of fancy crocheting, and
when asked by the doctor "what she
was going to do with it" innocently re
plied, "She was going to send it to her
sister in for a Christmas pres
ent." And if she chooses to wrap lt up,
put on the necessary postage stamps
and dV-op lt into the corner letter box,
who will be the wiser? Coming down
Jacksoli street the other day the writer
passed smallpox sign. "No one al
lowed td. enter," etc., it read. But how
about th{it dog calmly asleep on the
porch opposite the side door? Does he
read and •observe the board of health
regulation^? The writer has an Idea
that he sletpa In the house every night
and associates with dogs of high and
low degree every day. He also thinks it
is possible that some of this dog's com
panions go home and play with the
children living in much more preten
tious houses than the one with the pla
card on. Great is quarantine in Sioux
City!
There is another little matter that
needs attending to in Sioux City, and
that is putting up street signs for ten
derfoot visitors. The citizens are very
polite to strangers, answering questions
and telling you where to go, etc., but
after climbing hills 10,000 or more feet
high one would like to know "where he
In at." Of course one can ask whether
he has passed steenth street, and
nearly all of the houses are numbered,
a
grea^ convenience would be street and in this position directs
Mgns on the corners. This Implies that
one walks. Only strangers do that.
Citizens ride in electric cars, and to her
credit It must be said that Sioux City
has a fine system. One can go anywhere
every fifteen minutes and get there In
five minutes afterward, for when one Is
riding every car goes down hill at the
rate of 100 miles an hour. When you're
walking everything Is up hill. There is
just a little bit of Improvement needed
In their electric car system. Sometimes
they have conductors, and then they do
not. To avoid any unpleasantness, If the
conductor is absent, you can put a nick
el In the slot at either end of the car
then if a conductor gets on and asks for
your money point firmly but distinctly
at the slot machine, and that settles It.
The motorman, the writer believes, is
better pleased if patrons don't pay than
if they do. for there is not the best of
feeling between the dear people and the
car company. The people want con
ductors on the car how unreasonable
when so many can ride so cheaply with
tut being asked to pay! The motorman
wants conductors on his cars, probably
lor the company's sake, when he gets
'way out on Four Hundredth street
where lots sold for $1,000 during the
boom period and are worth some less
than that today.. But just the same
Sioux City Is doing business at the old
stand. There's a healthy growth today
that Is, worth more to the future of the
city than any boom ever was. Some im
mensely big buildings are being flntshed
In the business portion of town and resi
dent property has had a material ad
vance during the past two years. Al
most any kind of a desirable house now
tents from $25 to $40 a month, a few
bloated bondholders paying as high as
$75 to $100 a month. In addition to her
electric car system, Sioux City has a
splendid quality of water for household
purposes, and her system of sewerage is
almost perfect. Why shouldn't It be,
when every house is on a hlil, every hill
being a small mountain? Self-admiring
Sioux Cltyans have, however, a remark
able system for getting home different
from any other city on earth. John
Jcnes lives at 1546 Roosevelt street. The
residence of Jones by the government
survey Is 15,000 feet above the sea level!
Jones asks a friend home to dinner.
"Suppose we walk to get up an appe
tite." "What about the hills?" "Oh,
we'll go up McKInley street and avoid
the climb." And In some mysterious
way they walk and arrive at Jones'
house located where the snow does not
tliaw out at this level even in July, al
most three miles in the air, without
climbing a hill. This explains why the
electric car company declares such big
dividends. They save the wages of say
100 conductors at $2 a day and the cars
tun down hill all of the time, so there is
little expense for motive power.
Newspaper-wise the same curious sit
uation exists here as in Des Moines.
Here, since the oldest inhabitant can re
member, the Journal has attended to all
republican matters, Including the post
office, the government building and the
big bridge. In Des Moines we" all know yrQ wtn

to the republican nominee, a thing you
can always count on in the Journal. But
In the meantime the Tribune, like the
Leader of Des Moines, dared to support
Cummins. The idea of these papers in
terfering with the prerogatives of the
Journal and Register! Why, republicans
to this day actually "take" these demo
cratic sheets. This was bad enough, but
now up here the democratic Tribune
presumes to advise, suggest, remon

in fact, doeB everything about Sioux

Some citizens here claim that the text
and sermon now so prominent a feature
in the Sunday Journal are frequently
aimed at the Tribune. And another
thing that strikes the Looker-on is that
where one gets on a high hill and looks
down the city, and sees what "a picnic"
these two papers have in having but
little competition from the Chicago dal

to admit that both of these papers fur
nish such good daily publications that
outsiders hesitate to enter a field where
they would have' such strong competi
tion.
