COUNTY HOSPITAL.
WARDEN'S ANNUAL REPORT.
Warden McLaughlin, of tbo County Hospital,
baa rendered a verj comploto report for tbo ba
sal year to thd County Board of Commissioners,
Jn which tbo following facts are brought out:
Tbo expenses lor needed repairs to tbo building,
p&cbiuory, etc., during the year 1373, amounted
to $352.22, wbilo for 1871 tbo account was
fTollod to tbo amount of $1,005.81, which in
crease Is satisfactorily accounted for by Sir. Mc-
Laughlin. A stairway, or firo-cscapo, for in
tntes, in case of a conflagration, has been built
from tbo third story of tbo south building
to tbo sidewalk, which added a now
item to tbo miscellaneous oxpenso account. A
tupply of Ualr-mattreoaca ami comfortable bed
ding baa boon laid in; surgical instruments,
boxes for fractured limbs, and other parapher
nalia of tbo dispensary department, have been
lidded to tbo general outlay, with tbo intention
of making Cook County Hospital a first-class
Institution of tbo kind.
. Tbo Warden thinks that tbo future can bo
looked to with confidence, ami that it will not
bo necessary to incur liko expenses for some
time. A bond bos been Hied with tbo County
Board bv tbo contractors, for improving tbo
roof of tbo building, that it shall remain entire
ly water-proof during five years.
Tbo Warden, recognizing the old adage that
"a stitch in time saves nine," bus boon at pains
to have
TIIC ENTIRE INSTITUTION OVERHAULED,
bo that the increased items of expenditure may
lo regarded as a gain rather than as a loss. In
fact, ho considers tho best kind of economy is
lo prevent decay by timely improvements. In
Ibo disbursements made ho has had in view only
Uio best interests of thb county.

tves of deceased persons, inquiring into their

biding their names upon the hospitaf register.
Ho thinks that some rule should bo laid down
Cor tbo future Warden iu reference to tho collco
lon of board-money from rich and poor pa
tents who may have small sums in their posses
ion. Hitherto the (Imposition of such funds
Jaa boon discretionary with tho Warden, which
Sir. McLaughlin considers a bad stuto of things.
Mr. McLaughlin thinks that by leaving tho
power dlpcrotionary with the Warden poor peo
ple might often have to suffer, through mis
taken zoul, or for tho purpose of making up a
good balance shoot for tho inupectiou of the
aeunly, all of which would bo, in many cases,
limplo rubbery.
The Warden bus been instructed by Commie
ilonor Jones, Chairman of tho Hospital Coimnit
,ee, to forward bills for board to all tbo railroad
jompanies whoso employes may ho treated at the
aospital, except tho Chicago A Alton Company,
A’hich has a special contract with tho county in
inference to such of their men as may he in
lured. In some instances, tho companies were
rot satisllod, but Mr. McLaughlin thinks that
irrangcmonla might ho made whereby they
alight bo mado to agree to pay all reasonable
expenses.

THE SAURY QUESTION.
MEETINO OF THE JOINT COMMITTEES.
The Joint committees from the Hoard of Coun
ty Commissioners resumed their labors yester
day afternoon in the Finance Committee room,
at tbo County Buildings, in regard to tbo reduc
tion of salaries of tbo various oniclals. There
vroro present Commissioners Holden, Clough,
Jones, McCaffrey,Guenther, Bcbmidt, Bubho, ami
Crawford, Tbo former occupied the Obalr.
Tbo Committees took up tbo question of sal
aries paid to tbo
employes or the county cleric.
Gen, Liob was present. In reply to Mr. Holden,
bo said ho bad exerted bimuolf to hoop down tbo
expenses of bis department; tbo salaries woro
only fair. Mr. Drury, tbo Obiof Clerk, fully
earned bis, and tlio remuneration of tlio other
clerks was from SI,OOO to SI,OOO a year, and they
could not bo cut down. Ho bad tried, as far aa
possible, to introduce piece work
Commissioner Holden desired to know if tbo
General could run bis office, and do tbo work
well, for less money than bo now received.
Oon. Liob thought bo could not, ns the work
was constantly increasing, and tbo expenses
would now compare favorably with tbo adminis
tration of Mr. Poliak.
Commissioner Guoulhor naked if (boro bad not
been a considerable amount of extra work this
year,
Gon. Liob answered that bo bad done a good
deal of work in reforming tbo business of tbo
office, which would not bavo to bo done again.
Tbo rallrond-gcab law coat not loss than $2,000.
Tbo marriago-licouflo register bo bad arranged
alphabetically, and Uo did not think tho ex
penses hereafter would bo so largo. Ho did
not think tbo office could bo run much
cheaper. ,Tho office coal Inst year $53,000, but
Poliak’s expenses were $33,000. Poliak, bo
said, mado $-12,000 out of tlio office, and it cost
tbo county $70,000. Tbo subdivision of worth
loss lands, which bad to bo fflcd in books pre
pared for that purpose, cost tbo county a largo
sum.
Commissioner Clough wished to know if they
did not have to get those subdivisions approved.
Gon. Liob answered that they did in tbo incor
porated towns, but iu tbo Town of Worth it was
different.
Commissioner Schmidt asked tbo General If
bo would bo willing to contract for tbo duties of
tbo office and discharge them for a lump sum.
Tbo General said ho would consider the propo
sition, but thought bo could nob do It for $5,000
less (ban tbo expenses of lout year.
Mr..Holden —Not more?
Gun. Liob said ho would not do It for $5,000.
If he took tho same fees ns they did in other
counties ho could do all tbo work and. give tbo
county $35,000 bonus; but, ns tbo law would not
allow it, ho would not tako tho work on a con
tract and make 52.000 out of it. “I should bo
Industrious Inch then instead of Lazy Lieb, as I
am now tormod by tho papers."
COLLECIOU MILLER
said there wero over 50,000 mure lots on tbo
booksuovv than two yours ago.
Qon. Lieb said there wero over 800,000 lots in
tho county, and many of thorn wlld-cat. Thoy
cost money to transfer the taxes, which wero
never paid. Tho cost of running his office might
bo reduced by ft la\v providing whero tho tuxes
wero only 25 cents thoy should not bo carried on.
Commissioner Guenther said that lots of tho
land was worthless.

Collector Miller then produced eomo of the

lots wero not over 2or 3 cents. It costs 10 cents
to advertise thorn, and considerable expense was
involved in copying these books over ami over
again.
Commissioner Clough thought tho only way lo
moot this expense was to provide that all sub
divisions should bo approved before they wanton
tho records.

Qon. Liob said if this wero douo ho might run
tho office for £40,000 per annum.
Tho salaries in tho County Clerk's office and in
tho County Court wore then taken up, but no
changes made.
Commissioner Holden desired to know of Gen.
Lieb if ho would not tako a contract to run his
office for £46.000 a year, without Ills own salary
of $3,000. Thid would bo u saving of £B,OOO a

Gen. .Liob was willing, and tho Committee
took tho matter under advisement.
Austin Doylo, Clerk of
THE CRIMINAL COURT,
was then Interviewed as to tbo expenses of his
office.
Commissioner Holden asked him if bo could
run bis office for Ichb than SB,OOO per annum,
tbo amount it cost last year.
Air. Hoyle thought not. Tbo salaries in his
ollieo were only tbo same ns paid in tbo Circuit
Court. Thoro were no extra charges connected
with tbo ollieo. Sinco tbo salary system was
adopted there bad been a saving to tbo county
of from $3,000 to SI,OOO a year.
Commissioner Holden—Would you take tbo
office, and run it on contract ?
Mr. Dovlo—No sir, I would not; I run it as
cheap as 1 could for myself.
Commissioner Clough desired to know of Air.
Doylo what be received when bo was Chief
Hoputy.
Air. Hoylo—s2,COO a year, but my successor
only receives $2,100, n Having of a SIOO per year.
No changes wore made in tbo Clerk’s office of
Uio Criminal Court.
A discussion boro came up as to tbo legality of
tbo proposition made to Gen. Llcb, and it was
decided to obtain tbo written opinion of County-
Attorney Itounireo on that point.
Commissioner Clough remarked that tbo
clerks in tbo County Clerk’s office did not work
later than 5 o’clock in tho evening, whilo other
office clerks worked tilt 8 or 0 o’clock, and bo
thought the salurioapf tho clerks who did tbo
lessor amount of work should bo reduced.

Tbo Committee then adjourned to meet to

AN EXPERIMENT IN CHEAPENING MONET.
To the Editor of Tho Chicago Tribune.
Shi : An extract or two from tbo history of the
currency of England during tbo reign of Edward
VI. might Just now bo very instructive and
prolltobio reading, If our very progressive and
enlightened statesmen, of Senator Morion’s
sort, bad not destroyed tbo application of his
tory altogether. Wo are beginning to learn from
those gentlemen that tlio experience of tlio
u worn-out and effete monarchies of Europe " is
of no sort of use to the “ Bird of Freedom,” es
pecially when bo wants to soar.
Perhaps, if you have Ibis letter sot up some
where among tbo sermons in your paper, it muy
not come to bo read by any of those persons to
whom historical experience and old truths muy
bring offense.
I shall only ask you to print two or three very
brief extracts ; but, if you will refer to Volume
V., Fronde’s History of England, you will And a
good many sinking facts, showing bow apt cheap
money is to
GET OUT OF JOINT
and fail to work when it is most needed.
From 1541 to 1561, the Inflationists nraclfccd
up to tbo beet light they hud upon the silver
currency, by tbo occasional addition of a littlo
more brass, a pennyworth or so at a time, to tbo
coined shilling. This appeared to bo necessary
to eaablo them to keep up with prices, and, as
prices always outrun the debasement of tbo coin,
a clamorous crew was always insisting upon fur
ther issues of tho currency for the relief of the
industrial interests,— facilities for moving tho
crops.
After corn and cattle had risen from six to ton
times the former prices, many pcoplo still said
there must ho moro currency to induce a move
ment of tho crops. “Tho baseness of tho coin
was no objection; if it wero all brass, or of
leather Unload, and had tho gomtluo stamp and
guaranty of tho Crown upon it, and men bo
. compelled by law to take it [logal-tcndor], thoro
could ho no fault in it." Besides, it was a very
safo currency, Inasmuch as it could not bo car
ried away and spent hi Flanders, whore tho gold
bad already gone.
In 1550, tbo English Mint, to relieve tho sorely
increasing want, “was sot to
MAKING TWO SHILLINGS OUT OF ONE;
and orders were sent out for all tho plate remain
ing in tho churches to bo brought to tho Treas
ury, and all tho clnirch-nlate in tho Tower was
brought to tho groat cess-pool.
“ To conccaljthis fraud, or to prevent tho nat
ural consequences of it upon prices, tho magis
trates wero ordered everywhere to publish a
ccalo of prices at which fanners wero to dispose
of their produco. If thoy would not sell, the
constables wero to entor into possession, to sur
vey their yards, their cattlo*sheda, and their
dairies, and to sell for them at ofllcial prices.
“Tho Council quailed before the howl of in
dignation which rose over tho country when
force wan threatened ; ami, in a few weeks, they
wero compelled to confess their error mid to
permit articles of food to bo sold as buyer and
ecller could agree, 1 ’
Sir John Mason, writing to Cecil, said : “ Na
ture will havo her course, and never shall you
dnvo her to consent time
A PENNYWORTH RE HOLD FOR A FARTHING.”
—AVoMffc’a £nglanih Vol. 5, p. 2(30.
Tbo increased amount of currency not only
bad now less purchasing power, but it obviously
fostered and ripened “corruption and extrava
gance among tbo bangors-ou of the Council,”
indolence ami vice among tbo middle classes,
and “ misery and want to artisans and laborers.”
In a sermon which Bishop Latimer preached
in 1500, before tbo Ring and Council, lie sketched
tbo condition of England,—“where proiligac.v
was no.longer held a crime, but something to bo
laughed at; whore the law was no weak that
neither could gentlemen be compelled to do their
duty ns land-owners, nor the people bo kept from
rebellion; whore avarice seemed to bo tuo only
spirit to which men any longer acknowledged
onedlouco, and the officers of tho Government
act the worst and most glaring examples. . . .
They augment their fortunes and grow rich
while tho King’s workmen moan that they get
uo money.”
Tho miserable fruits of this policy ripoued
more fully in Ireland; and tbo reports of Crown
officers from that part of tbo realm are very full
and convincing evidence of ibo value of In
flation when permitted to run its full course.
Sir James Crofts, Lord Hoputy, to appease a
general clamor, and by consent of tbo king, is
uod a call In 1552, “ for a mooting of people of
Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Drog
heda, to know the causes of tbo dearth in corn
and cattle, and bow tbo same mav bo remedied.”
It seems this meeting was well attended, and
much temperate and intelligent discussion was
bud, pointing, in tbo language of tho reports, to
this conclusion: “Therefore, that prices had
risen with bad money. Whether it were bettor
that money should bo scarce or plenty, they
would not venture to say; only,
IT MUST BE VUIIE.
“ They must trade in fauohmonoyas bad gotten
tbo estimation of tbo world; and that estimation
could not be changed by ono little comer of it.
That, if the currency could not honestly bo re
stored, they preferred the least of two evils, and
desired that it should bo immediately called
down to its market-value.”
“At Ibis time," says Sir James Crofts, “tbo
measure earn that was wont to bo ut 2s to 3s,
and in March, 1551, at (is Bd, was sold in Hutch,
1552, for 80s. A cow that bad boon worth (3s 8d
sold for 40s. Every lord caused bis pooplo to
retain their victuals within tbo country. In
many cities, schools were shut up; servants
wore turned away, from tho cost of maintaining
them; artisans and tradesmen would take uo
more apprentices ; and, at last, tbo markets wore
closed. Those who before bud bought little at
high prices could now buy nothing at any price.
The countrymen so. suspected , tho money that
they would not take It on any terms.
“And now they do collect all the enormities that
have grown In so many years, so that thoro is
among them such hatred, such wretchedness
upon tho poor men and artificers, that all (ho
crafts must decay ami tho towns turn to ruin,
and all things be, in common , or each live by oth
er’s spoil."—AVoude’a lingland, Vol. 5, p. 400.
Northumberland, chief advisor of tbo King,
replied to these reports in a manner mixed witli
a devotion which tho llov. Hr. Kittredgo could
not fail to approve. Ho said: “Tho beginnings
of all tilings in which wo aro to prosper must
have their foundation upon God; and, tboro
foro, tho Christian religion must bo planted and
restored. The favorers and promoters thereof
must bo esteemed and cherished, and tbo hhi
derors dismayed. Next, tho laws of tho realm
should be bolter obeyed, and tbo King’s revenues
bo more diligently looked after. Tbo money was
a secondary question; tuo reformation of the
coin was impossible, and the calling down objec
tionable.”—AVoru/c, Vol, 5, p, 803.
Whoever chooses to follow the history of this
experiment in watering a currency will find that
tho struggle with its Unaiiciiil confusion and
chaos continued until 15(32, when the Crown,
under Elizabeth, called in ttio several breeds of
Rtumptuil, and reissued a standard currency, ut
the cost of tho Government. ■No one needs to bo
informed that
a.v aoj: or usexamm.ed rnoarmuTV
to Kuglaml speedily followed,
Thu conclusion is as sound to-day as it was 825
years ago; “Wo must tradu iu such money as
Ims gotum tho estimation of tho world." Our
currency is not world's money. It is a com
modity, as much liable to lluctuatinn in price as
I'Aciflo Moll. Tho greenbacks two by law con-
vcrllbio Into interest-bearing bonds; ami a fool
ing of danger crept into tbo public mind when
Congress, without nay apparent call or pressure
whatever, roponlod Hint clause, and abolished the
security to tho blllboldor.
Lot Congress restore tbo clause for conversion
into bonds bearing a low ruto of Interest, if it
cannot give us a specie-redemption. If half a
loaf is boiler limn no bread, surely some security
for a future payment of tbo greenbacks hi money
is a ntop In tho right direction; and this brings
mo to ask wlmt is tho fault in Mr. Kelley’s bill
offering tbo 3.05 bonds ? Huroly the bonds must
contain a condition for ultimato payment in
money. As it is, trade is constantly menaced
by (bo threat of repudiation, mid stealthily grasps
larger profits from instinctive apprehension. Is
it any wonder that tbo world's capital grows shy
of a people whoso currency
MAY SHRINK ONE OR TEN I'Ell GENT
in a day or a month?
There is always something tempting in Hie
scramble among tbo wrecks which result from
tho uso of a credit currency; but tbo prises in
this lottery never fall among tbo producing
classes,—not that I over hoard of,
1 think a recent correspondent of yonrs ex
pressed some pleasure at tbo prospect of a re
peal of tbo “ legal-tender ootp 1 bo said it would
have a cheerful effect ou business; holders of
greenbacks would show more readiness to lend
thorn, or to buy something with them, or givo
employment to labor. At any rate, tbo repeal
would favor a lively circulation. Boos this gen
tleman remember tho Illinois and Wisconsin
slumptall? That currency came to ho endowed
with the liveliest qualities, and gentlemen would
travel lato and early, looking for chances to
upend it. Us ultimato value, however, was only
equal to that synonym of zero,—a continental

To the Editor of The Chicago Tribune:
Sin: Thoßopublican sentiment of Southern Illi
nois is not thoroughly united upon any particular
theory of a eolation of tho currency problem ;
but all Republicans aro united in tho wish that
tho Republican Members of Congress may settle
upon some rational method of adjusting tho
finance problem. This question has come to bo
of overshadowing Importance; and our people
fool that, unless groat caution and conciliatory
counsels prevail in Congress, tho party may bo
wrecked upon thle rock. In fact, this question
has forced its way into a position where tho peo
ple feel that their pockets aro involved; and tho
pockets aud hearts of ordinary maukiud, as is
well known, ace nearly allied.
Last winter, after tho panic, it is not saying
too much to assort that
NINE-TENTHS
of tho people in Southern Illinois wero in favor
of increasing tho volume of our paper-money. In
deed, the remark will apply to the whole coun
try ; for, shortly after tho panto, ovary interest
in the Fast was demanding moro money of tho
Government, and tho President's message in
clined to inflation. But, when Congress had
completed a bill to increase our money, a reac
tion had sot in,—so much so that tho President
doomed it host to veto tho measure. Had our
volume of currency been increased $100,000,000
early last winter, it is yet believed by many that
business would now bo active, people would uot
be leaving our shores by shiploads, and our
parly would have been victorious. It was be
lieved that, by expansion, iho popular demand
would bo gratified, aud tho Union party would,
as a consequence, have remained iu power for
some years, or at least until tho Southern prob
lem had adjusted itself ou a basis to immro
tranquillity., Tho writer also viewed tho subject
in this light. But this action would uot have
prevented the evil day j it would only havo de
layed it. Wo would havo ballooned it a few years
longer; but would, as inevitably as fato, havo
fallen sooner or lalor. I was what is generally
Known us a “ mild inflationist,” and at that time
1 was uot without company. Wo desired to de
lay tho evil day. but had no hopes of escaping it.
But now the evil is upon ns. Wo havo, in fact,
settled upon tho rock-hod of security and gold.
Wo have mndo tho leap ; the people havi mado
it; tho whole business of tho country has mado
it. Wo aro
ON A OOLO-HABIS rnACTICALLT J .
and the real troublo is passed, Now, all Con
gress has to do is to pass a simple measure which
will bring our paper-monoy ou to tho basis on
which all business bos now settled. If this
woro dono to-morrow, it would not hurt tho
farmer ono cent a bushel on bis wheat or corn,
aud it would benefit every laborer iu tho coun
try.
The legislation which would have delayed our
fall one vear ago would now ho folly. The evil
which (ho wiscHt of statesmanship ono year
ago could only at best huvo delayed a little while
is now upon us, or it has, in fact, passed. The
fearful problem of appalling import, therefore,
which hung over Congress last winter, is now
removed, do, while tho paper-money legislation
of last winter was demanded by a majority of
tho people, wo are certain that such schemes as
Mr. Kelley’s 8.05 bonds will not now bo sup
ported by the popular voice. As to tho people
of Southern Illinois, I am confident that any
scheme by Congress which docs not ut least
point to specie-payment
WILL NOT HEF.T THEIR APPROBATION,
in tho ratio of one to four. Our journals gen
erally will not this winter indorse purely paper
legislation. And such great dallies m this part
of tho country as tho St. Louis Dmovvat mid
St. Louis Globe, and others, are uniformly for
tho attainment or n specie-basis without un
reasonable delay. Tho trouble with some of
our Republican Congressmen is. they appear to
lose eight of tho fact Unit tho business of tho
country has now settled on a Unid-pau basis;
and 1 doubt very much if it would bring down
prices generally ono cent if Congress would
order tho Secretary of tho Treasury to make a
loan of $332,000,000, and to redeem all our
legal-tenders in gold Immediately. Tho only
point our people hero will insist on—and tho
same Is true of tho wholo West, the South, and
part of tho East—is this: that our volumo of
money shall not bo contracted. It certainly
seems there are none of tho difficulties now
hanging over tho finance question before Con
gress that there woro last winter.
It gladdened tho heart of every true Republic
an iu those parts when they learned
THE TUtUUNR
was fighting again for tho old party. The only
censure wo have for this journal in, that it not
only often convinces, but sometimes it wounds
iu its strictures upon pnper-mouoy men of last
winter. Upon tho whole, wo do not tako them
to bo such a diMpcralo set of follows. Indeed,
we had tho majority of tho nation last winter;
but measures wldch then would havo boon wise
by Congress, would now, under tho changed con
ditions, bo folly. And, the sooner our “rag "friend
Kolloy discovers this, tho bolter. The Tiiiiiune iu
doing gallant service for truth and good govern
ment. Tlio splendid manner in which its timely
loaders of somo days einco raised a universal
dust in tho ranks 01 Democratic journalism, on
their dangerous and iudofuusihlo dogma of
“ Btalo Huvoroignty,” was admirable. Tho trutli
is, that parly must ho drlvuu to tho wall on this
idea, if wo are ludoed a congrcgatiou of
“ Sovereign States,” then our natioualitv is a
humbug, and secession is right. It is wonderful
to coutmuplulo what an immeasurable inlluonco
jonnmhsm uuw possesses. Take Thk Tuicune,
for iustanco: No Senator, and it may bo doubt
ed whether the President of tho Ilopuulic, wields
snob a potent forco. Taking all tho Isuuoh of
such journal within a week, and counting their
actual readers, together with tho readers of
other publications intiuonood by such loading
journal, and it Is perhaps within truth to say
that they Inlluonco in a groat decree tho opinions
of live millions of persons. This vast inlluonco,
multiplied hr the weeks in a year, given sumo ap
proximate idea of the intluouco of u grout nows
pnpo; and it should
WKIOII WITH UEI’OMISa RESPONSIBILITY
upon tho editors of such journals, iint how
often is this high trust abused I A single cano
iu hand will illustrate it: Tako somo of tho great
papers of the Democracy, in their abuse of the
President and his family. Just contemplate that,
with theso almost infinite powers and fuicos at
their hand, and for no other reason than that
ho is a political opponent, they havo turned loose
this raging sea of calumny, unmindful of wound
od hearts and of the touro of his nobio wife ; and
all this in tho faoo of tho fact that, as a man. his
Ufa ami character are unsullied by a single alain,
and, as a President, his Administration is char
acterized hy as much wisdom and goodness ns
any tho country has over experienced. Those
editors scorn to havo forgottou their mission,
ami, In tbolr wild turbulence of abuse, reduced
ttiolr digutty nbout to tho lovol of a gaug of wild
Texan HloorH In a slamnndn.
In conclusion, Sir. Editor, would ic not bo wise
for our Congressman to try to save our pnrly by
harmonizing upon somo rational moans of soln-
Uon of ibo ilnnnuo problem? It in potisibto for
our friends to inaugurate measures, between now
and (bo Adjournment of Oongrors, which will
givo our party ovary Northern atato, and some

THE OURUENOV AS A STANDARD MEASURE OP
VAI.UE.
To the Editor of The Chicago Tribune.
8m: In nearly nil tbo articles or speeches, in
Congress or out of it, that wo have seen, on tho
flounces of tho nation, there seems a lack of ap
preciation as to tho immense importance of tho
currency, or “Instrument of exchange,” as tho
MEASURE-VALUE OV ALU MERCIIANT.UJLE COMMODI-
Tho cry from tho inflationists of tho Wont is.
“ Tho sentiment of tho people is unmistakably
for more money,”—more money to facilitate ex
changes ; but forgetting, or not understanding,
tho more important function of money,—tho
measure of values.
Tho BUporllclftl student of public economy can
easily comprehend one of the functions of
money, as tbo instrument to facilitate exchanges;
but tbo other and vitally-importanfc use or func
tion, without which tho instrument of exchange
cannot bo fully and truthfully money at all, this
(unction, ns a standard or measure of value, is
not *o readily understood and recognized by our
modern politicians. “The sentiment of
tbo pooplo is unmistakably for moro money,”
bays Senator Morton. Then why not en
courage tho mining of tho precious metale,
out of which alone money is made and coined ?
Why pursue such a Governmental policy as to
discourage tho mining interest, from which
source wo derive “ more money,” by substitut
ing greenbacks or tho National Bank currency—
moro duo-bills and promises to pay money—for
the real article that costs much labor,—the ele
ment that must
NECESSARILY ESTER INTO ALL VALUES,—
money as well as other merchantable commodi
ties ?
Tho lack of a littlo discriminating know!-
edge of the laws of values is tho
sourco of Hindi confusion and fog on
tho subject of our pnblio finances.
If, at tho commoncomcnt of our groat Civil War,
wo had boon more anxious to have kept tho our
roncy at par vnluo, as tho first issue of $50,000,-
000 of “demand notes” was* wo should have
saved $1,000,000,000 in our national indebted
ness, which, through n greatly-depreciated cur
rency, was saddled upon us. This enormous tax
of at least $1,000,000,000 is but au illustration of
tho immense amount of wealth that has been
sunk and wasted by tho mass of tho peo
ple iu their current expenses, by tho substitution
of our fluctuating system of legal-tender cur
rency. For, at ono time in our history, thoso
notes, although legal-tenders, depreciated to 04
cents on the dollar.
Aud still tho cry is “for more money.” It
docs appear, iu view of tho past history of our
finances, that
THE MOST URGENT CRY
from our languishing industries, aud from all
tho legitimate channels of trade and commerce,
—the ono great aud oil-important demand,—!?,
not move of this fluctuating and depreciated
stuff superficial economists call money, but tho
introduction of n now and prosperous era by the
appreciation of our currency to tha ronl money
standard tho world over. J. 11. A.
RESUMPTIONOOpI p SPKOIR-PAYMENTS.
To tho JSditor of The Chicago Tribune.
Sin: lam a poor walking man, traveling
from Chicago, aud como in contact with all kinds
of persons with various ideas os to the present
dull times ; and meal- of them, from Illinois to
Kansas,
rEarrcTLY aokee with vou
in your views as to a speedy resumption of
specie-payments.
Some time since, I borrowed SI,OOO. By
economy, etc., 1 got together S6BO. 1 received
notice the amount was duo and to call
around and settle. I called at ono of our Chi
cago banks, and told them I wanted to barrow
12 per coat on SI,OOO, or $l2O, having somo
property. They very readily loaned it to mo. I
then went on to tho holders of my note, aud told
them I wished to pay tho SI,OOO duo. They very
kindly received mo,, and told mo, if 1 wished to
use tho money, to do so for another term; they
only notified mo tho amount was due.
Now, sir. that la, in my humble opinion, the
exact ponUiou of the United States Government
to-day. They owo the public 100 cents on the
dollar. They havo got 86 cents. Tho banks or
the people are perfectly willing to loan them tho
12 per cent; and then, like any hank, when they
offer it, tho pnblio will uot want it. As tho
Frenchman said, “If you havo got, it, 1 don’t
want it; but, if yon haven’t got it, X want it aw
ful bad.” it is entirely
A HATTER OF CONFIDENCE,
and It is most extraordinary that no Member of
Congress has yet found out that a loan of 12 or
15 percent would immodiatolycuablo ns to pay 101)
cents in gold to every one who wanted tt. 1 ven
ture to Hay there is not one person in ton who
would not prefer to have a $5 hill to $5 in gold,
if ho were only satisfied that the gold was there,
and ho could got It when ho wanted it..

A PLAN FOR RESUMPTION AGREED UPON.
N/irciid DtojwtcA to the .Yew York Jhtilii Graphic.
Washington, D. 0., Doc. 1-I.—At last there is
a prospect for some action being taken by Con
gress looking towards indorsement of tho Presi
dent’s views, and a settlement of financial ques
tions generally.
Tho programme, as now sketched, is substan
tially na follows:
1. Repeal of tho Legal-Tender act, to take ef
fect throe years from now.
2. A gold loan to bo authorized to redeem tho
greenbacks, tho latter to ho canceled.
3. A charter to bo granted to a central bank
agency, which will be to tho United Btntos what
the Rank of Franco and tho Dank of England are
to their respective countries,—the controller of
'financial inlluoncos in our dealings with other
nations.
4. Free banking,—all bank issues to bo redeem
able iu coin.
5. The whole debt of the United States to bo
consolidated, without any time fixed for its pay
ment; in other words, tho relative normaneauy
of tho debt recognized. As it is funded, it is be
lieved that the Government will bo enabled to
unite nil its outstanding indebtedness in a 4 per
cent bond. It is anticipated that such a bond or
consul would sell above par.
Upon looking over tho field, oven the infla
tionists in Congress aro satisfied that adding to
tho currency would not revive business. There
is plenty of paper money now, and tho only hope
of its entering tho channels of business lies in
an assurance being given that at some time in
the future it will bo discredited as a legal ten
der, and quoted at a discount with reference to
gold. Once insure the demonetization of this
paper, aud at once it will bo used in productive
enterprises. Tho only way iu which paper money
can stimulate business is in tho certainty of Us
depreciation; this makes every ono who has it
anxious to part with it for stable property.
Ilcnco a rise in prices; hence tho rapid passage
of notes from hand to baud.
imiQHTKNINO ASPECT OF TUB QUESTION.

Wasiiinuton, Deo. 11.— A hopo is heginuiug
to prevail hero that some legislation may bo car
ried through at tho present session which will
tend in the right direction on the currency ques
tion. Loading members of both parties aro im
pressed with the necessity of Using a national
policy on tho subject, Democrats on tho ouo
hand and Republicans on tho other hand each
feeling that delay may injure them with the pco
plo. In the Senate, this feeling is so prevalent
that private consultations havo already boon hold
between prominent “hard-money” Senators of
both parties with a view to agree upon somo
practicable measure iu accordance with tho
President's message and tho Secretary of the
Treasury’s report.
THK DUTY ON TEA AND OOFFKK.
It is probable that tho question of the restora
tion of the duties cu tea and coltco will tako
legislative form iu connection with tho efforts
which will doubtless ho made, oven during this
short session, for modilicutions of the larilt;
and a communication which appeared in tho

position of duties upon tea and coffoo, payable
In greenbacks, and tho canceling of (ho green

tracted earnest attonion hero,

Indianapolis, Ind., Deo. IG.—Tho eighth an
nual report of tho Homo for Juvenile Offenders
was filed to*dav with tho Governor. Tho Trus
tees report tbo institution in splendid condi
tion, out of debt, and with accommodations
for 050 boys. Tbo suggestion is raado
that tbo younger children bo placed in
nn Orphans’ or Children's Homo, or
in private families, and it is hoped tlmt tbo State
will provide an intermediate prison for young
men too old for commitment to tbo House of
Kofugo, and yet young enough to bo lullucucod
by wholesome reformatory influence and dis
cipline. Tbo report of Superintendent Ains
worth shows tho number admitted to be HR •, re
leased on tickot-of-loavo, 55; discharged, 105
escaped, 7; doolhs, 2; remaining Doc. 1.1874,205.
Tho improvements made during 1870 amounted to
$10,497.01, and those in 1874bavocost $15.582.’{J5.
Tho health of tho institution has been uniformly
good, but two deaths having occurred. Tho Su
perintendent urges oornostlv tho purchase of ad
ditional land, tho present farm being too small to
profitably employ tho lobor of tho constanttv
incrcasing number of boys. Tho financial ex
hibit shows an expense of $570,025.81, tho ap
propriation from tho Legislature being for last
year $37,500, tho hulanco of tho receipts being
umdo up out of sums paid by counties and from
private sources.
