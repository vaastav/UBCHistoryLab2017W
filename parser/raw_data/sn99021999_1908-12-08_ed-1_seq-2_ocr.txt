RATES EAST BUT NOT WEST
Cora Exposition Falls to Secure Ratea
West of Missouri River.
In spite of strong pressure by the direc
tors of the National Com exposition and
by a committee of the most prominent
business men of Omaha, the railroads still
refuse to grant any requests for rates west
of the Missouri river to the corn show.
Over a month ao the directors secured
a promise of 1H cents a mile east of the
Missouri river from all the roads, but for
some reason or another the railroads re
fuse to give to the corn exposition the
same rates which were granted to the
state fair and the fall festivities and all
the state fairs of the west The Burlington
and the Union Pacific seem to be ths
roads which are holding out In this matter,
as the others say there cmfwyp bm bm m
as the others say they are willing; to come
across If these two roads will get Into line
Local representatives of these two roads
lave done what they could for these rates,
but the officials at Chicago are the final
ruthorlty in such matters, and they say
nay.
Railroads centering in Omaha are pre
pared for whatever rush comes along for
the Natioral Corn exposition. Large num
bers of extra cars have been sent out
along the llres and will be used as the
occasion demands. The Union Pacific has
arranged for no special trains, because of
the large number of regulur trains which
that road has In and out of Omaha every
day, but extra coaches will be added to the
trains as needed. Present Indications are
that more peoplj will come from the east
of Omaha than from the west. The east
ern farmers realise more the value of In
tensive farming and of a better grade of
seed corn. They have been forced to study
these conditions by the higher price which
they pay for their lands and Indications
are that, thousands will come from Iowa
and Illinois and Indiana and nth.
west states. The Burlington has arranged
uor iour special trains to the corn exposl
tion.

mr, Bwe.Ut-h. vice-cons..! In fct. Louis, com
mitted suicide bv drinking prusslo add at
his home, 1244 Goodfellow avenue, today.
Mr. Ekstromcr came into public notice
some time ago through controversy with
federal officials whl.h resulted In the re
vocation of his exequatur by President
Roosevelt. Later he was re.nstaWd In the
good graces of the administration and re
sumed his cffhlal duties he.e. Apparen ly
B.kstrotner re per, te J of his act when too
late, as a card was found on which he hud
bcawled:
"I have taken prusstd acid for the pur
pose of suicide. Call Dr. L ingran."
The physician, a neighbor, could not aid
him. Kkctrotner Is auivlved by a widow.
Mrs. Eksiromer can ass gn no reason for
the sjlciuo. The other mem ers of tils
family, two -step-daughters, are al-o at a
loss to account for his action. M . Ek
stromer was 51 years o.d and seemingly In
perfect health. As Stved sh vl e-consui snd
as manager of the Wed Dlslnf.ct nt com
pany, i577 Olive street, his social a net busi
ness connections were of the best. So far
as can be learned he had no financial
troubles.
It was his championing of the cause of
E. O. LewU, publisher and organ ser of ihe
People's United Mates bank, that brouaut
down the wrath of the president on Ek-
strome .
In A. arch, 1907, Ekstroircr went to Wash-!
ington ut the head of a commit ee of Lewis'
acihe.ents and asked for an audi ncj with
the pres.ciont. They wished to tel. Roite
velt that In their opinion the second class
mall privileges were be.r.g wrongfully with- ,
held from Lvwls publications. The presl- i
dent refused to see them. I
On his return to St. Louis Ekstromcr '
wrote a letter .o the president In w. ich he
denounced Postmaster Ge.ieral Cortel. ou,
accus.ng h.m of unfairness, lie also called
the president's refusal to tee the St. Luuls
iommt.ee "un-American and unjust." i
This trought forth a stitement from the
White House that Ekstiomer's lets.' was
"impertli.ent, uncalled for and ('.Is ourtejus"
and that the statements contulned In it
were untrue ",
P es dent Rootevelt notified the minister
from Swoden that Ekstromnr was "persona
non grata" and forthwith Ekstromcr's exe
quatur as vice-consul Was rev ked.
At the earnest solicitation of the SweUsh
mlnis er Ekstromer later wro;e n ; pology

was reinstated as vice-consul. He has held

Itoase and Senate Adjonrn Oat of
Respect to Deceased Members.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.-Both houses of
congress held brief sessions today, ad
journments being taken out of respect to
the memory of those members who had
died during the recess. The only business
transacted by the senate was the swearing
In of Senator Page of Vermont. The first
half hour that the house was In session
was devoted to a roll call to ascertain the
presence of a quorum. The-formal opening;
of the body witnessed a remarkable demon
stration for Speaker Cannon, the republi
cans and many democrats loudly clapped
their hands and cheered for several min
utes. Soon after Mr. Sherman of New
Tork, vice president-elect, came Into the
chamber and he was accorded an ovation
from his republican colleagues. In like
manner the democrats roundly applauded
the new loader, Champ Clark, when he
arose In his place and forced an explana
tion regarding the absence of credentials
of a nw member from the third New Tork
district.
Great Demand for Seats.
For many days past the demand for
cards which entitled the bearers to seats
in the respective galleries has been so
great that when the doors of the mas
sive structure were thrown open at $
n' clock a crowd of more than sufficient size
to take up the entire seating capacity of
the two chambers had assembled. From
that time on they came in droves, the cor
ridors on both floors being filled with
crowds surging back and forth, while long
lines of people stood outside each gallery
door relying for an opportunity to get even
a peep Into the senate or house, on some
of the more fortunate ones vacating their
seats.
The unfavorable weather conditions did
not seem to have the effect of reducing the
size of the crowds as gauged by those
which had gathered on slmlllar occasions.
. In both bodies among the most Interested
spectators were the members of the diplo
matic corps who were present In goodly
numbers. Numerous high officials of the
government likewise occupied seats and
they, too, displayed the keenest interest
In the proceedings.
The rule of the senate and house pro
hibiting the placing- of floral pieces on the
desks was rigidly enforced. The contribu
tions in this regard were many and hand
some, but their donors were obliged to
content themselves with having them
placed In the private lobbiea
Sessions Called to Order.
Immediately after the senate had been
called to order at 12 o'clock today by Vice
President Fairbanks and Rev. Edward
Everett Hale, the chaplain, had opened tne
session with prayer, Benator Dillingham of
Vermont presented the credentials of his
colleague, Senator-Elect Carroll 8. Page,
who was at once sworn In.
After the usual committees had been ap
pointed by the senate to inform the presi
dent and the house of representatives of
the meeting of that body, and a resolution
of regret upon the death of Senator Allison
had been adopted, the senate at 13:25 o'clock
adjourned to meet at 12 o'clock tomorrow.
The house was called to order at noon.
When Vice President-Elect Sherman en
tered the chamber he was accorded an
ovation by his republican colleagues.
When Speaker Cannon mounted the plat
form and called the houss of representa
tives to order, he also received an ovation
at the hands of his republican colleagues.
Nt a few democrats Joined In the demon
stration which continued for several min
utes. The two floor leaders, Sereno E. Payne
of New Tork, republican, and Champ
cianc or Missouri, democrat, were early In
their seats and each was accorded a hearty
greeting by the members Irrespective of
party affiliation.
The roll call disclosed the presence of
331 members. Seven new members then
were sworn In- to fill vacancies that oc
curred by death or resignation since the
last session. Among them was Eben M.
Masters, republican, successor to Mr.
Parker, republican, from South Dakota at
large.

TOWNSKAD IS FOIl CANNON
Michigan Congressman Maya II la
Not After Speakership.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.-The speakership
fight was somewhat cleared today by Rep
resentative Townsend of Michigan declaring
to the members who approached him on the
subject that he was not a candidate for
speaker.
"Who is your candidate," he was asked.
"I am for Cannon," he replied. "That Is
provided he will give due deferenoe to the
desire to amend the rules and I believe he
will do so."
Notwithstanding this action on th part
of Mr. Townsend, Representative Murdock
of Kansas was confearlng with members
With a 'view of organizing opposition to the
speaker.
"At the pfoper time, we will hold a con
ference,' said Mr. Murdock. "The senti

Solution of Raee Question.
In lcoklne toward a.chanae of party af

Uu the whole the btst public opinion of
the north and the best public opin on of
the south seems to be coming together In
respect to all the economic and pli lc U
ue Ions growing out of in-sent race con-
unions.
The recent election has made It probable
that I shall become more or less responsl
bio for the policy of the next presidential
administration, and. I Improve this op
portunity to say that nothing would give
me greater pride, because nothing would
give me more claim to the gratltuiht of my
fellow citizens, than If 1 could so direct
that policy In respect to the southern states
as to convince Its Intelligent citizens of the
desire of the administration to aid them in
working out satisfactorily, the serious
problems before them and of bringing them
and their northern fellow citizens closer In
sympathy and point of view. I pray that
It may be given to me to strengthen tho
movement to obliterate all sectional lines
and leave nothing of differences between
the north and the south, save a friendly
emulation for the benefit of oui?ommon
country.

. preme Court.
WASHINGTON, Dec 7 -The supreme,
court of the United States todiy de Ided In
favor of Mrs. Ingersoll the oase of Mrs.

ers, Involving a els. m cf $10000 Ly M s.
Ingersoll on account o' services rendereJ
by her husband In the breaking of the will
Of tho -late Andrew JT. Davis, a Montana
mill onalre.
Davis left property both in Montana and
Massachusetts. Ingersoll was employed by
some of the disinherited relatives of Davie
cn a written contract to pay him a fee of
$100,000 on the condition that the will should
be defeated. . A case Involving the validity
of the will was snnounced In Montana and
the Jury disagreed. . A compromise then
was arranged whereby the relatives who
brought the suit were given a portion of
the estate. They paid Ingersoll $5,000. but
after his death the widow Instituted pro
ceedings to recover the entire fee, claiming
that the compromise was tho result of her
1 usband's efforts.
The case has been much In the courts. It
was first decided by the district court for
the Seccnd Judicial , district In Montana
against Mrs. Ingersoll on the grounds that
she had no cause of action and the Mon
tana supreme court affirmed that verdict
On the other hand, the United States cir
cuit court for Massachusetts held for Mrs
Ingersoll, but the finding of that tribunal
was reversed by the circuit court of ap
peals for the first circuit on the grounds
that the Montana adjudication was final
and the decision rendered today was on a
review of (he decision of the court of ap
peals. '
The decision was reversed, but the de
cree of the circuit court was modified so
as to reduce somewhat the amount allowed.
