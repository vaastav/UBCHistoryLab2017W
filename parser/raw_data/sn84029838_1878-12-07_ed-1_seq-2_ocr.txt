THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
STOI1MS AND SUN SPOTS.
The, edilor of tbe Limed CnroBOMVye con
tinues his raeteorulrgical re eaicle. Irom
wh ch we condense e follow: Poring tbe
i-t two years, the United State ard other
poitionsof thecivilired worll have been
Yisiud with severe and remarkable dorms
Tltir rapid succession an 1 dctructive re
tulta have provoked popular comnien', acd
cieated wrious alarm. Thin siries of terrible
atmcwnberic dicdnrbanco invites tbe eugges
tion that Iters must be some special local,
cr cosmical ii iluence to account for tbe ex
ceptional meteorological phenomena The
recent earthquake, whose Bbock felt tbe
whole leugth cf the continint, au 1 as far
towards the centre as the extern border cf
Kansas, undoubtedly is the effect of the
6ame force that promts itself now as a cy
clone now as an earthquake.
Unquestionably the disturbing caue for
tbe laat two jean, is the same as that in the
yeirs of the greatest frequency of remarka
ble storms in tbe past. The causa of these
periodical years cf violent storms, it is con
cedeJ, U due to the uousual magnetic neur
it of the earth at that time, and the depen
dence cf this upon tbe sun' condition as to
tbe areas and number of "ots. Tbe pbe
DOmena of their increase and gradual de
crease through constant period, has baen
established by the daily observations of tbe
celebrated German Astronomer S-hwabe,
and tbe confirmation of his discoveries by
other eminent observer?. Scbwale found
that the eolir spots increase in magnitude
and frequency fjr about fire yeirn and a
half, and decrease through an equal period,
completing the cjcle in about eleven years.
Prof. Lxiiaie, in his "Aealyeis cf the
observations cf many year," shows conclu
sively an existent" between me sun spots
period and the intensity of tcrrcatisLmsg-
nelism. It is subject to proof then, that tbe
meteorological disturbances under consider
ation are puiely magnetic These rasgnttic

etorms en the earth's surface were once
rensidered fitful their cause having been
miptcted, but not believed periodical are
equally with other distinct natural foreee,
cosmical in their nature.
We were struck with eitonishmeut, when
list winter constructing diagrams to aeconv
pany an article "Oa C.imatic Changes in
he Prairie Region of tbe United States,"
at tbe remarkable comncidccce of tbe yeais
of maximum rain-fall with tie years of
greatest frequency of euu-epol6 -so much so
that ve feel almcat warranted to predict for
an indefinite period, jests of the maximum
rainfall for Kacti-.
W't are now approaching the eleven year
elating the sun's rotation on itself. These
spot vary, the maximum and minimum be-
ins 10 a tf-oie, jeriodical. Oidmarily, the
magnetic needle varies more or less towards
tbe east cr wes'. Thee sudden vaiiatious
have been remarked tj be greatest when the
spot on the sun ara ment numerous.
It has bsen obiervtd that the cyclones in
tbe Indisn ocein were greater in proportion
as the Sjpot on tLe sun reichtd tbr maxi

nrction b twe-n tbe sjlar spot) and the de
gree of temperature, and the humidity oi
tbe at i o'jiherr.
We have this 63n directed our inquirii t
to the variations of the needle anong cur
Hirveyora in this section of Kansas, and
learn as we Mwi-ecttd, that it o-ciIIat:cn
and erratic action is more intensified than
ever before known, ia some inetarces during
field labor, of over thirty years. That the
barometer lias assingalarlf fluctuated, we
have only to refer to the record of the Sig
nal Service fir extended areas."
It is remarkably confirmatory of the the
ory now generally acccptee': That tbe vari
ations in the solar heat produce a similar
variation in tie terristial evaporation, erd
an increased tendency to violent storms.

THE PHESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Ths President's annual message was read
before Congress on Monday last, Tbe gen
eral topics of the country are presented in
a suggestive way the yellow lever, the pa

consideration. Indian affairs are comment
ed on. The President earnestly concurs in
the recommendation for a corps of mounted
Indian auxiliaries to be used in keeping the
Indians oa their lestrvatiens and prevent
ing disturbances on their part. He expres
ses a hope that Cjrgrm will act consider
ately in this important matttr.
Wc are unable to fire an extended report
of this important doiunient.
