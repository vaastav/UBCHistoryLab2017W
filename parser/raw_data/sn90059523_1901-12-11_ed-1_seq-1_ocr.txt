IS IT ANOTHER MERGEA?
Combination of Southern Transportation Lines
Believed to Be Under Way by New
York Capitalists.
Charter Is Filed Under Laws of New Jersey
But No Intimation Given as to Its
Special to The Globe.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.— A charter was
filed under the laws of New Jersey at
Trenton and New York this afternoon
which, apparently, is intended for a com
bination like that embraced in the char
ier of the Northern Securities company,
which is absorbing the securities of the
Northern Pacific, Great Northern and
other Western railroads.
The title of this new corporation is the
Southern Securities company, and, ex
cept as it differs in certain provisions,
which have been the subject of adverse
criticism, it is substantially the same as
to object, power and privileges as the
Northern Securities company. It has a
nominal capital of $100,000, but it can in
crease the amount at its pleasure. Who
and what are behind this \ew charter
are not "disclesed on its face, and the
names of the corporators, presumably
dummies, do not convey any information.
They are: C. Frederick Smith, John R.
Turner, Edwara B. Hawkins, Edward T.
McGoffin and Walter H. Bond.
The charter states that the objects for
which the corporation is established are
to construct, operate and control trans
portation undertakings, terminals and fa
cilities, to develop properties undertak
ings, industries, enterprises or companies
for transportation by land or water; pro
vided, however, that this company shall
not engage in any business which shall
require the exercise by it of the right of
eminent domain within the state of New
Jersey, or, except as permitted by local
laws, without the said state construct,
lease, own, operate or sell transporta
tion line or lines by land or water in any
estate or country, • either directly or
through the ownership of stock of any
corporation, but always subject to the
local laws of such state or country; and
to act as the fiscal agent for any of the
above or like purposes or any other cor
poration, to issue bonds, debentures and
other negotiable or transferable instru
ments or otherwise, and., to the extent
permitted by the local laws of each state
and foreign country, in which the prop
erty may be situated, manage the affairs
or lake over and carry on the business
of any company or companies so formed
or to be formed, either by acquiring the

Ticket Scalping Is Favored by a
Large Majority—Agitation
for Trade Label
Defeated.
SCR ANTON. Pa., Dec. 10.—The exclu
sion of Chinamen, Japanese and other
Asiatics from American territory, ticket
scalping legislation and advisability of
adopting a universal label for union
made goods, were the principal questions
that claimed the attention of the dele
gates at today's two sessions of the
American Federation of Labor. The res
olution advocating the exclusion of the
Chinese was adopted by the convention
with considerable hurrah, but in the mat
ter of excluding natives of Japan and
other Asiatic lands a snag was struck,
and this part of the anti-Mongolian agi
tation was killed so far as the present
convention is concerned.
The ticket scalping debate was quite a
lively affair. The delegates representing
the railway telegraphers opened the fight
against the resolution, making the point
that such action was beyond the jurisdic
tion of the federation. The "typos" were
hfclped along in their arguments for the
adoption of the resolution by several so
cialistic members of the convention.
When the viva voce vote was taken those
in favor of permitting ticket scalping
won by an overwhelming majority. The
agitation for a universal label, which has
been carried on for a long time, was
again defeated.
The convention disposed of much rou
tine business during the course of the
day. The important question of trade au
tonomy will be sent to a special commit
tee, which will be announced tomorrow.
ROCK ISLAND BREAKS IN
PROBLEM OF REDUCING TIME GET

Special to The Globe.
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.— The fast-time prob
lem between Chicago and the Western
and Northwestern gateways Is becoming
more complex. Additional difficulty was
added today when General Passenger
Agent John Sabastian, of the Rock Is

solution that covered the other gate

herein contained shall be construed to
authorize the corporation to transact any
business in any other state, territory, or
foreign country, contrary to the provis
ions of the laws of such state, territory
or foreign country.
Meaning of Last Clause.
The last clause is apparently quite a
new provision and is no doubt designed
to avoid the difficulties raised by the
charter of the Northern Securities com
pany. The company is author
ized to bold its meetings and to have
one or more offices and to keep the books
of the company within or without the
state of New Jersey at such place or places
as may from time to time be designated
by it, provided, however, that any stock
holder of record who shall have owned
stock In his own name to the amount oi
or exceeding 10 shares for at least three
months previous to such application,
shall have the right upon application in
writing to such board to personally (not
otherise) inspect at a time and place to
be fixed by the board any book or ac
count, record, document or paper of the
aforesaid corporation; provided, how
ever that the board of directo::-"
shall have the right to decline
to permit any such inspection to be
made, in case it shall be satisfied and by
resolution shall declare as the grounds
of such refusal that such application is
not made in good faith.
This last provision for the inspection
of the company's books and accounts
avoids the violation of any federal law
which may be passed pursuant to Presi
dent Roosevelt's recommendation that
certain publicity be required of all cor
porations and so-called trusts. The char
ter further expressly provides that the
power to declare, fix the time of payment
and pay dividends shall rest wholly In
the discretion of the directors ot the
company, that the directors shall have
the power to reserve as working capital
or as surplus for the said company or for
any other purpose which they shall deem
conducive to the business of the company
such sum or sums as from time to lime
shall to them in their absolute discretion
seem fit and proper. In some quarters
it is believed that the new charter is for
the purpose of carrying into effect the
many railroad combinations which have
been recently talked of, more particu
larly the Southwestern system of rail
roads which would include the Missouri
and Southern Pacific railroads.

BOSTON, Dec. 10.—Tbe Democrats com
pletely overwhelmed the Republicans in
the city election today, Gen. Patrick A.
Collins being elected over Mayor Thomas
N. Hart by the largest plurality in a
quarter of a century. The Democrats
likewise obtained control of both branch
es of the city government, elected their
street commissioner, Salem D. Charles,
and practically all their candidates for
the school commission. As usual the city
voted strongly in favor of license.
The result of the canvass was fully as
much a surprise to tJie Democrats as tr,
their opponents. The most sanguine
Democratic prophet last night claimed
only 7,000, yet this plurality was nearly
tripled. Two years ago Mayor Hart de
feated Gen. Collins by 2,281 votes and
pollod something over 40,000. This year
the total Republican vote for mayor was
a trifle over 33,000, the smallest given a
party candidate for mayor since 1893,
despite a registration almost 50 per cent
larger than then. Gen. Collins received
over 57,000 votes, the largest in the history
of the city, and he carried eighteen of
the twenty-five wards.
The Republican leaders were inclined
to blame the weather tonight, but this
does not account for the tremendous
gains made by the Democrats in Repub
lican wards. There was great excitement
in the close wards and in South Boston
two prominent Republican politicians
were arrested on suspicion of having
worked repeaters. This, however, was
the only unfortunate feature of the day.

CHICAGO, Dec. 10.—The quick wit of
Ethel Barker, the thirteen-year-old
daughter of Aid. Barker, of Evanston,
and the coolness of Miss Nellie Sickel, one
of the teachers in the Lincoln school,
averted a fire panic today and probably
saved the lives of many little ones, who,
without the splendid discipline shown,
might have rushed pell mell for tiie
stairs, trampling less fortunate ones under
their feet.
Just before noon the building took fire,
Miss Barker walked quietly to the piano
and commenced playing a stirring march.
The children were ordered up for fire drill
and marched out in order. MiS3 Barker
did not cease playing until the last child
had left the building, and when she tried
to escape she was twice driven back by
clouds of dense smoke, which by that
time rolled through the corridors. She
finally reached a door and went to the
first floor by groping along the walls
and along the stair banisters.
When the girl volunteered to play the
march she was the only pupil who knew
the building was on fire, for she had
heard the whispered announcement that
preceded the ringing of the fire drill gong.
When the gong sounded she ran from the
eighth grade room and began to play.
As a result of her coolness all the chil
dren were taken out safely, although a
panic was narrowly averted when they
reached the lower floor and found that
the building was on fire.

WHERE DID MONEY GO?
Public Examiner's Final Report on Street
Force Pay Roll Investigation Eloquent
With Question Marks.
Two Thousand Dollars Paid to Men of Whose
Existence There Is Strong Doubt—
Pope's Final Recommendations.
Public Examiner Pope yesterday submitted to Mayor Smith the final Install
ment of his report of the investigation of the city street force pay rolls of the
city engineer's department. In it the examiner submits a statement containing
a list of warrants paid to men who cannot be located by the department, the
amounts aggregating $2,000. He submits al:--o "nis recommendations in the mat.
ter, and, as stated in The Globe th is morning, he makes no charges or in
sinuations against any of the officials of th> department, even going so far as
to state his belief that neither Claussen, Gehan nor Steeg have profited by the loss
to the city.
From the first the public examiner has held that the frauds perpetrated could
have been detected, and largely prevented by a proper supervision and scanning
of the pay rolls by the officials of the department. He urges an immediate
change in the "atrocious system of ace ounting for the labor of the street force,"
and suggests that the council arrange a plan which will allow weekly payments,
and insure the receipt of the payment by tr.e person performing the work paid
fcr.
Gen. Pope makes no recommendation. even in the case of Swanson. The ex
aminer desired only to put before the council the exact acts ascertained, with
all the proof at hand, and leave the responsibility for future action with that
body. "It is now up to the council," was the examiner's comment, as he filed
the last installment of the report, which so thoroughly opens up and exposes the
peculiar practices which have been md ulged in by Swanson, Carlson and others
at the expense of the city.
ir. regard to the men on Swanson's rolls wi>o cannot be located, the ex
aminer states that the presumption is strong that none of them had an exist
ence, or did any work for the city. But he is willing to give fhe benefit of the
meager doubt in this case, and says that he will be glad to receive any informa
tion concerning any of these men.
The complete report filed by Gen. Pop c yesterday follows:
THE REPORT IX DETAIL.
In a communication of date Dec. 6, covering a statement of discrepancies be-i
tween time rolls of commissioners and pay rolls as compiled in the office of the
city engineer, I said on Page 3: Had the superintendent and clerk whose duty it
was to compare, verify and certify the daily and weekly reports, been capable
and faithful in discharging their duties, and had the city engineer fairly ap
prehended the consequences of loose and irregular methods, and practices in
financial administration, this theoretical system could not have been used as a.
device to plunder the city treasury. After careful consideration I have deemed
that that statement must stand. It would bo a work of supererogation for me
to state that there hasbeen, and is not the slightest cause for questioning the in
tegrity and honor of the city engineer in his connection with any of the mutters
referred to in the preceding sections of this report upon the administration of
his office. I
The city engineer, the superintendent of streets and the chief, clerk havo
eac)i been ready and willing to respond to every call, and have, so far as was
in their power, aided and furthered the labors of the investigation.
In this connection, in consideration of the fact that early in its progress, an,
unsigned communication received by this office, which charged in effect that Mr.
Steeg had endeavored to suppress testimony bearing upon the falsification of
time rolls, was through an accident, which I regret, give a degree of pub
licity. I wish to state that the developments of this investigation have proven
to my satisfaction that such charge was false.
Further, I might state that there is no evidence nor suspicion that the super
intendent of streets, of the chief clerk In the engineer's office, have received any,
part of the moneys which have been taken improperly from the city treasury.
I venture to suggest to you that lull justice would be done to every public
and private interest inyolved in my first preliminary report, if Mr. Andrew
Swanson will pay into the city treasury the proceeds of the sales of sand mado
by him, amounting, so far as is known, to $8.25, and if John F. Gehan will
pay into the city treasury the sum of $2CJ.33, as per statement attached, which,
amount was tost to the city by reason of his) errors) in consolidating of timel
rolls upon the pay rolls and consequent overpayments.
Since commencing this examination much has been done by the city engineer
toward correcting the atrocious system of accounting for the labor of the street
force, which was in effect. It is hoped that your honorable body will arrange a
plan w.hich will allow weekly payments, and insure the receipt of the pay
ment by\the person who performs the work Such a plan could be arranged
without additional expense other than that involved in drawing warrants weekly
instead of semi-monthly.
Complaints, apparently well founded, have reached this office that certain of
ficials in the engineer's department have at times made surveys for private
parties and collected ryiy for such work to the detriment of the interests of
unofficial, but fully qualified engineers and surveyors. This statement is mado
for your consideration. 4
In view of the iesults of this limite:l examination of the time rolls for the
street force employed during the past year, it would anpear that public interest,
as well as justice to the other commissioners reporting during this period, re
quires that your honorable body should give to these commissioners the priv
ilege of verifying their time rolls, by producing the men named therein. You
cannot otherwise know that this partial examination has uncovered all the
fraudulent practices and financial losses in which the public is, alike with
yourselves, interested. •
I further recommend that such examination shall cover the expenditures made
for cycle paths and the improvements made thereon during the year.
I further recommend an investigation as to the records and conduct of the
several city storekeepers, and the installation of a system of record, which will
be an effective check upon the improper use of material and supplies belong
ing to the city. >
This department will be pleased to place at the disposal of any committee or
person whom you may appoint for such purposes, some reasons which give
emphasis to the foregoing recommendations.
Concerning the forgeries and frauds evidenced in Swanson's rolls I offer no
suggestion.
This report and those previously placed before you conclude my report upon
the subjects considered, but are preliminary to the complete report, covering
the records of all the city's financial officers, which final report will be placed
before your honorable body at the earliest possible date.
STRAW JMEX O.\ TIME ROLLS.
Following I append extracts from time Tolls of Mr. Andrew Swanson, and
list of warrants issued in payment to the men and for the time as carried upon,
said time rolls.
It was deemed essential to procure the attendance and evidence of the men
whose names were carried upon the time rolls, and the Engineer's Department
and Mr. Swanson were called upon, but were unable to produce any of the men.
The officials of the Public Examiner's Department made personal investiga
tion in an effort to serve subpoenas, andascertained that none of these men lived
or had lived during the past year at the places where their address was given.
The Police Department was asked to co-operate in an effort to find these men
through their patrolmen, and have been unable to find any evidence of the ex
istence of those men.
The presumption is very strong that none of these men had an existence
ot did the work for the city for the periods for which they were carried on the
time rolls.
I shall be glad if any of these men can be found, and evidence be pro
duced to show that they did work for the payment for which warrants have
been issued.
As will be noted, a large proportion of these warrants passed through and re
ceived the indorsement of Olaf Carlson before presentation at the bank.
