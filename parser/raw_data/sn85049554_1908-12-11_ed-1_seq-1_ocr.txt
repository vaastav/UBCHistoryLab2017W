Washington, Dec. 11.—Attention was
called today to the fact that the ut
terances' of the president In regard to
the action of congress in limiting the
Use of the secret service force is not
the only action of the executive that
is considered by members as objection
able.
It became known that the sub-com
mittee having in charge 'the prepara
tion of the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill has ibeen
investigating the razing of the old
Pennsylvania depot, that was located
on the mall, until the president had
it torn down last summer. That com
mittee failed to expunge its inquiries
about this action from the printed
hearings is taken to indicate the tem
per
.of that committee toward the
executive. The committee also went
into examination of government offi
cials to ascertain what right the com
mission on country life, appointed by
the president, had to use the franking
privilege, as it was claimed was being
done. Members of the committee re
ferred to the commission as "one cre
ated without authority of law."
House Takes Action.
Immediately after convening today
the house adopted a resolution intro
duced by Perkins of New' York, pro
viding for the appointment of a special
committee of five members to consider
the proper means of dealing with that'
portion of the president's message
which criticises the course of congress
in' prohibiting details of secret service
men to duty outsidfe of their own bu
reau. The resolution is preceded by a
preamble reciting some of the expres
sions of the message. No effort is
made to give voice to the feeling of
the house. Perkins, with Denby, of
Michigan Weeks, of Massachusetts
Williams, of Mississippi, and Lloyd, of
Missouri, were appointed on the com
mittee.
Senate Will Also Act.
III submitting the resolution Peritins
saicO the statements by the president
could not be lightly disregarded as
they might impair the usefulness of
congress that undue obtuseness might
argue for lack of proper self respect.
A resolution similar to that ipassed by
the house probably will be adopted by
the senate early next week. It will pro
vide for the appointment of a commit

growers were the only witnesses heard
by the bouse ways and means commit

of New Mexico, asked the committee
to retain the present tariff on wool,
saying he would like to have the duty
Increased if he thought there was any
possibility of^lraving it done. H. W.
Kelley, representing the New Mexico
Wool Growers' association, claimed the
cost of raising sheep has Increased and
he asked to have the tariff on wool re

amendment has been of benefit only,
and could be of benefit only, to the
criminal classes. If deliberately intro

the effectiveness of war against crime
it could not have been 'better devised to
this end. It forbade the practices that

extent by the executive heads of var

these practices we owe the securing of
the evidence which enabled us to drive
great lotteries out of business and se

some of the most outrageous frauds in

ment in the detection of crime and the
securing of justice. Moreover, it not
only affects departments outside of the
treasury, but it tends to hamper the
secretary of the treasury himself in the
effort to utilize the employes^ of his
department so as to best meet the
requirements of the public service. It
forbids him from preventing frauds
upon the customs service, from investi
gating irregularities in branch mints
and assay offices, and has seriously
crippled him. It prevents the promotion
of employes in the secret service, and
this further discourages good effort.
In its present form the restriction op
erates only to the advantage of the
criminal, of the wrongdoer. The chief
argument in favor of the provision was
that the congressmen did not them
selves wish to be investigated by the
secret service men. Very little of such
investigation has been done In the
past but it is true that the work of
the secret service agents was partly
responsible for the indictment and con
viction of a senator and a congressman
for land frauds in Oregon. I do not
•believe that it is in the public interest
to protect criminals in any branch of
the pulbic service, and exactly as we
have again and again during the past
seven years prosecuted and convicted
such criminals, who were in the execu
tive branch of the government, so in
my belief we would be given ample
means to prosecute them if found in
the legislative branch. But if this is
not considered desirable a special ex

this than to do what actually was done,
