PRESIDENT'S
LAST MESSAGE
ANNUAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO
CONGRESS ARE MADE BY
s»*~hSA4j i.nriAi ran
Sherman Law Should Be Amended,
flavors Postal Savings Banks
and Parcel Post.
Washington, Dec. 8. —The follow
ing is a brief synopsis of the Presi
dent's message, read to the two
Houses today:
The financial standing of the na
tion at the present time Is excellent,
and the financial management of the
nation's interests by tbe government
during tbe last seven years has
shown the most satisfactory results.
But our currency system Is Imperfect
and it is earnestly to be hoped that
the currency commission will b* able
to propose a thoroughly good system
which will do away with the exist
ing defects.
During the period from July 1,
1901, to Sept. 30, 1908, there has
been a net surplus of nearly one
hundred millions of receipts over ex
penditures, a reduction of the inter
est bearing debt by ninety millions,
In spite of the extraordinary expense
of the Panama canal and a saving of
nearly nine millions on the annual
interest charge.
Corporations —I believe that un
der the interstate clause of the con
stitution the United States has com
plete and paramount right to control
all agencies of Interstate commerce,
and 1 believe that the national gov
ernment alone can exercise this
right with wisdom and effectiveness
so as both to secure justice from and
to do justice to the great corpora
tors which are the most important
factors in modern business. I be
lieve that It is worse than folly to
attempt to prohibit all combinations'
as is done by the Sherman anti-trust
law, because such a law can be en
forced only Imperfectly and unequal
ly, and its enforcement works almost
aa much hardship as good.
The railways of the country ahould
be put completely under the inter
state commerce commission and re
moved from the domain of the anti
trust law.
Telegraph and telephone com
panies engaged in interstate business
should be put under the Jurisdiction
of the interstate commerce commis
sion.
Labor—As far as possible I hope
to see a frank recognition of the
advantages conferred by machinery,
organization and division of labor,
accompanied by an effort to bring
about a larger share In the owner
ship by wageworker of railway, alii
and factory.
There should no longer be any
paltering with the question of tak
ing care of the wageworkera who,
under our present Industrial system,
become killed, crippled or worn out
aa part of the regular Incidents of
a given business. The object sought
could be achieved by proper employ
ers' liability laws.
I also renew my recommendation
that the principle of the eight-hour
day should be as rapidly and as far
as practicable be extended to the en
tire work being carried on by the
government.
The Courts—l most earnestly urge
upon congress the duty of increasing
the totally Inadequate salaries now
given to our judges. Beginning with
the supreme court, tbe judges should
have their salaries doubled.
~~It"Is discreditable to us as a peo
ple that there should be difficulty in
convicting murderers or in bringing
to justice men who as public ser
vants have been guilty of corruption
or who have profited by the corrup
tion of public servants.
Forests—lf there is any one duty
which more than another we owe it
to our children and our children's
children to perform at once it is to
save the forests of this country, for
they constitute the first and most Im
portant element of the natural re
sources of the country.
Pure Food —The pure food legis
lation has already worked a benefit
difficult of estimation. -
Postal Savings Banks—l again re
new my recomemndation for postal
savings banks, for depositing sav
ings with the security of the govern
ment behind them.
Parcel Post—The establishment of
a local parcel post on rural routes
would be to the mutual benefit of
the farmer and country storekeeper.
Public Health —The dangers to
public health from food adulteration
and from many other sources, such
aa the menace to the physical, men
tal and moral development of chil
dren from child labor, ahould hi met
and overcome.
Statehood—l advocate the Imme
diate admission of New Mexico and
Arizona as states. This ahould be
done at the present aession of con
gress.
Porto Rico—l again recommend
that American cltlaenahlp be con
ferred upon the people of Porto Rico.
The Navy—l approve the recom
mendations of the general board for
the Increase of the navy, calling es
pecial attention to the need of addi
tional destroyers and colliers and,
above all, of the four battleships. It
Is desirable to complete as soon as
possible a squadron of eight battle
ships of the best existing type.
CONGRESS CONVENES
HOUSE AND SENATE MEET MON
DAY FOR SIXTIETH
SESSION.
Legislators Separate-After Short Ses
sion In Order to Pay Respect to
Memory of Senator Allison.
Washington, Dec. 7.—-As the
hands of the clock in the hall ot
representatives in the national capl
tol converged at noon today Repre
sentative Joseph G. Cannon of Illi
nois let fall the gavel that is the
outward symbol of his authority as
speaker of the house of representa
tives and announced iv his usual
short, sharp tones that the mem bars
of the house would come to order.
While this scene was being acted
in one end of the capitol another
very much similar, but on a much
smaller scale, took place at the other
end at the same minute as the sen
ate was summoned from its private
conversation to public business by
the voice of Vice-President Fair
banks.
As the present session is the sec
ond session of the Sixtieth congress,
no organization was necessary,
Speaker Cannon retaining his au
thority by virtue of his former elec
tion and Mr. Fairbanks us ex-offloio
presiding officer of the senate.
Today's session was very short.
.After the absolutely necessary busi
ness was transacted the two houses
adjourned for the day in order to
pay proper tribute to the memory of
the late Senator Allison of lowa His
successor, Albert B. Cummins, was
sworn In today.
The programme of the leaders Is
to pass the appropriation bills, hold
ing them down as much as possible,
and sidetrack all legislation that is
not absolutely essential. New legis
lation, entailing heavy appropria
tions, will be put over, because the
condition of the Treasury will not
Justify any great increase in the ex
penditure of public funds.
There will be a river and harbor
bill, in addition to the appropriation
bill which are enacted at every ses
sion, and this one measure will prob
ably carry 175,000,000 or more.
The very fact that there Is not a
superabundance of money in the
treasury will be given as a reason
for cutting down appropriations for
river and harbor work below the
amounts asked for by the army en
gineers. This means that the dele
gations from the Pacific Coast states
will have their hands full getting
adequate recognition for the water
ways of the Coast.
Fortunately, Representative Jones
of Washington is on the house rivers
and harbors committee, where he
will be in a position to do much for
the Columbia river and other rivers
and harbors of his state and Oregon.
Oregon is deeply interested in a
bill Introduced and passad through
the Senate last session—the bill di
viding Oregon into two judicial dis
tricts; one on either side of the
Cascade mountains.
Oregon representatives have bills
pending providing for the establish
ment of an assay office at Portland.
But the economical streak that will
be manifest throughout the session
will probably kill off this bill and all
like it.
In connection with the river and
harbor bill, the Oregon representa
tives will endeavor to secure an ap
propriation for the purchase of the
canal and locks at Oregon City. Bills
introduced for this purpose last ses
sion were told to wait until a river
and harbor bill was framed.
Buy* Canal Transports.
Seattle, Wash., Dec. B.—The
•teaniers Shawmut and Tremont,
now at Seattle, have been purchased
by tbe Isthmian Canal Commission
from the Boston Navigation Com
pany, to be used In transporting sup
plies for the Panama canal.
For this purpose last year Con
gress appropriated $1,500,000. The
price paid for the steamers is $1,-
--157,301, which the owners say Is 33
per cent less than the vessels cost
five and six years ago. The vessels
are to be delivered at New York
without cost to the government. (
These vessels will be used for car
rying supplies to the canal and later
will be turned over to the navy for
service as colliers. The government
now has a contract for 4.5000,000
barrels of cement, which will be tak
en from New York to Colon.
Indian Potlatch at Rrlliu K haiii.
Bellingham —An Indian potlatch,
or gift feast, given by Jim Vellow
kanlm, the old chief of the Nooksack
tribe and the wealthiest Indian in
the northwestern part of the state,
has just closed at his ranch at Lyn
den. It was attended by 400 Si
washes of every tribe in the section
from Skagit county to the Fraser
river la British Columbia, and was
marked by the wild, peculiar cere
monies of the aborigines.
The Indians disinterred and re
buried all the dead of the Nooksack
tribe, the weird rite being performed
in the cemetery owned by the chief.
Yellowkanim distributed gilts to
the value of hundreds of dollars, and
his lavish entertainment of the tribe
cost him thousands.

practical method is possible for the
extraction from the fumes of the
smelters of the poisonous substances
