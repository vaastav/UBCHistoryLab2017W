? The President's Message.
The full text of the fourth annual messago
of President Grjlvt to the Senate and House
of Representatives is laid before our readers
this morning. It opens with a graleful ac-.
knowtedgmcnt of the blessings vouchsafed
to us by Divine Providence aud an appropri
ate reference to the recent deviation by fire
as the only overshadowing calamity occurring
during the year. Neither war, pwtilme,
nor famine has visited the United State*,
and no cause seems to exist to threaten our
peace in the future. ;
A great deal of space is properly devoted
to a recital of the circumstanccs attending
the peaceful settlement of the questions at
issue between this Government and that of
her Majesty of Great Britain. When Con
gress adjourned the question of consequential
damages appeared to jeopardize the Treaty ot
Washington in so far us it related to the Ala
bama claims, but the arbitrators appointed
under that treaty deposed of this matter,
with others, without difficulty, according to
the law and equity of the case, and-to the
entire satisfaction of this Government. The
Geneva tribunal, at the conclusion 01 its
labors, availed itself of the discretionary
pDwer given it by the treaty, and awarded
to the United States indemnity to the amount
of 513,500,000. The distribution of the
money recovered from Great Britain is com
mcuded to the attention of Congress, and it
is recommended that a Board of Commis
sioner* be created for the purpose.
The settlement of the Northwest boup-,
dary, or San Juan question, by the decision
oi the Kmperor William, in which it l- de
creed that the line between her Britannic Ma
jesty and the United States should be drawn
through the Haro channel, as claimed by
the American Government, is noticed, and
the services of the arbitratoraniitbcprompt
uessof her Majesty in acccptiug the arbi
tration and withdrawing her troops from
our territory arc acknowledged. The Presi
dent recommends the appointment of a joint
commission to complete the survey and de
termination of that portion of the line upon
which the commission which determined the
remainder was unable to agree? that is, upon
the line between our territory of Alaska and
the coterminous possessions ot Great Britain.
Legislation to carry into effect the provisions
oi the Treaty of Washington which relate to
fisheries is "urged, and the increase of the
surveying party now fixing the line between
the United States and the British possessions
between the Lake of the Woods and the
llockv Mouutaius is advised.
The President refers briefly to our peace
ful relations with France, Russia, and Ger
many; to the ratitication by both parties of
a naturalization treaty with the Austro-Hun
garian empire, and also to a treaty 011 the
tame subject with Norway and Sweden.
The importance of the International Sta
tistical Congress at St. Petersburg and ol
th'j International Industrial Exposition at
Vienna is alluded to in terms of high nppre
ciition, aud Congress is asked to appropriate
money to delrav the expenses of commis
sioners to the latter, and to authorize the
Secretary ot the Navy to tit up two naval ves
sels for transporting between our Atlantic
cities aud Trieste articles to be exhibited
by Americans. The President suggests that
t.ie next International Exposition should Le
lield in this country in 187G, on the occasion
oi the celebration of the centennial of Ameri
ca:! independence.
A speedy settlement of the boundary ques
1ihi now at issue between the United States
:md Mexico and a eessatiou of the outrages
committed upon American citizens on our
Tlx: 111 frontier are anticipated, and the Pre
Miknt compliments the present and late Pre
sidents of the Mexican republic.
The continuation of the war in Cuba is
noticed with 1 egret,and the President thinks
that .Spain ami the insurgents occupy the
ttune relative attitude that tl.ey did a year
airo. He regards slavery in Cuba as " the
nutunU cause of u terrible evil." It Is hoped
that .Spaiu will l* voluntarily adopt this
vio\\\" aud execute the emancipation laws
rnucted two years ago. The holding of
slaves by American citizens in Cuba is ad
verted to, and Congress is asked to legislate
*o as to discourage if not prevent this.
In glauelng at the situation iu the allied
Republics of the Pacific coast, Brazil, the
Argentine Republic, aud the Central A men
cm States, the President incidentally raps
Venezuela over the knuckles, aud intimates
tint she is too slow about paying her debts
to the United .States. He did the same thing
las', year. Our treaty relations with Japan
and Chiua are reported uuchauged.
The remarks relative to the finances of the
Government are interesting. It is claimed
that the principal of the public debt has been
reduced one hundred millious, and the means
of this reduction are given. The President
thinks it doubtful whether a further reduc
tion of taxation is practicable for the present,
aud recommends that there be no further
legislation on the subject except to correct
errors in the present laws, until it can be
proved that it can be done and leave suffix
eiont revenue to meet current expenses, pay
interest, and provide for the siukiug fund.
Next to tho preservation of the national
credit the. President esteems it important to
provide a uational currency of fixed aud un
varying value as compared with gold, and a$
fcoou as practicable convertible into gold at
par.
One of the most interesting parts of the
xue&sage is that in which reference is made
to the various enterprises for the cheapcr
and more certain transportation of the sin
plus of western aud southern products to
the Atlantic seaboard. But we confess to a
sniaU measure of disappointment that, after
las imported assurances to Senator Lewis
and lU'presentatives-elect Smith and Sexer,
the President has not made a more particu
lar allusion to that great national work of
internal improvement iu which Virginia is
(.-specially interested?the James "River and
Iviuawha canal. Several water-line projects
are grouped together, and the President
simply recommends that this whole subject
be referred to a committee or a commission,
who shall consider it and report at some fu
ture day with a view to legislation. The
design evidently has been to make a
complimentary nientiou of all such en
terprises as can properly be brought to
the attention of Congress without indorsing
any in particular. Still it is a point gaiued
if a committee is appointed; and with a fair
hearing the James Kivcr aud Kanawha canal
will stand a good chance for an appropria
tion.
Various appropriations recommended by
the Secretary of War are favorably noticed;
attention is called to the weakness of our
navy and the necessity for strengthening it;
and the President approvingly notices the
condition of the Post-Office Department of
the Government. The President evidently
fat ON the postal telegraph iecommends- j

when we recollect who have been lib inform
ants and advisers in tbe past; but
it pleases us to see that he
disposed to acccpt the view that the
pardon of some if not all of the un
tuuate victims of the cruel laws rrf?rcd <?
may result In good. His warning U> klAlux
organizations to disband Is well m^nt. but
seems unnecessary in view of tbe fact hat
thc*c indiscreet associations ba\e cert }
disappeared, if they ever existe .
A satistactory exhibit of the affairs of the
Interior Department is made, and the^Presi
dent points with satisfaction and pride to
what "he esteems tbe entire success or jns
Indian policy. This l>olicy will be main
tained, and as a part of it the Prcsidcn
warmly urges upon Confess,bU, schemefor
converting the so-called Indian T?" J
south of Kausas into a home for the Indiana,
erecting therein a territorial form of govern
mfADt,liew and enlarged organization of the
Patent Office is reported as nece?sary, an
favorable mention is made of tbe proposition
to separate that office from tbe Intend De
partment. The Information given m regard
to lands, agriculture, and pensions * inter
esting and statistical. The President ap
proves of tbe proposition embodied iu a bill
now before Congress providing for tbe ap
propriation of tbe net proceeds of tbe sales
of the public lands for educational purposes
An important recommendation is made in
regard to tbe census. It is proposed that a
uew enumeration be made in 1875, but that
no apportionment of representatives in Con
gress shall be made thereon. Such a census,
being divested of all political character, un
doubtedly has much to commcnd it to the
favorable consideration of Congress.
Affairs in tbe Territories are spoken of a*
satisfactory except iu Utah. Tbe policy ot
the legislation of that Territory is severely
commented on by tbe President, and be re
commends a earcful revision of its laws so as
to secure peace to its citizeus and tbe ulti
mate extinguishment of polygamy.
Tbe Philadelphia centennial job comes iu
for a tirst-rate notice, and, indeed, tbe Presi
dent could c]o little less for a .State which
gave liim a majority of ucarly 140,000 at the
late election.
Of civil-service reform the. President says
little, but probably enough to convince tbe
country that he has not changed the views
on this subject expressed in his last message.
He a-ain declares his determination to carry
out the rules laid down by the commission,
but reminds Congress that upon them de
volves the task of making his successors
walk in the same path. With these remarks
the message concludes.
A hasty examination of this long docu
ment has given us a favorable impression of
iU contents. We see in it many things
worthy of commendation and some to
which we nnv hereafter take, exception.
We publish it in full for the benefit of tbe
half-dozen iu every five hundred of our
readers who read the messages of Presidents.
The great majority will perhaps find this
running sketch of its contents iuterestiu0
and useful. ?
The Virginia General Assembly?
?For this is the aucienfcand dignified title
of ttye body?meets in the Capitol on to-mor
row. As the members have had a year's ex
perience in legislation it is to be hoped the}
will profit by their experience and avoid
some discreditable things which blotted the
journal of the last session.
The same questions in a great part which
occupied the attention of the last session will
be presented to this. AN e have not heard so
much of "Relief" this year as we heard
during the year in which the delegates were
elected?wv infer because the game of
demagoguism was ended when the election
took place. Aspirants whose merits were
rather short spliced them out with promises
of " Relief," which they ought to have known
they could uot render, as tho last session j
plainly proved. Those who electioneered in
that way supposed they redeemed their
promissory notes by offering resolutions and
making a spurt or two; but we conjecture
that if they ever come before the people
ngain they will discover tliat they have made
an error. The man that acquires a seat in
the General Assembly .in that manner will
not be let otfu ithout some better proof of his
good faith. Hardly any earthly wrath is more
terrible than the aversion of the deceived to
wards the deceiver. He who excites popu
lar expectations and hopes which he after
wards disappoints is one who has little
ground to expect forgiveness.
The financial question will again occupy
the legislative mind. It will find the diffi
culties heaped up by another year in its way.
Tbe Supreme Court has the question ot the
obligation of the State to take the eoupons
of the fuuded bonds in payment of taxes
under consideration. We will not presume
anything iu regard to its decision, but we
suppose that tribunal commands its wonted
respect at the bauds of the Legislature, and
that its judgment will be looked to with the
interest to which it is entitled.
There is a considerable fund in the trca
surv, that awaits the order ot the Legislature,
upon which tho bauks are paying four per
cent. Of course the banks can't pay four
per cent, aud le content with six per cent.
? trorn their debtors. And yet the last Legi?
? laturc, which approved the amendment of
the Constitution with the view of limiting
tlie late of interest to six per ccnt., required
the banks to pay this four cent, which inevi
tably forced the borrower from the banks to
pay ten.
The Legislature will probably carry out
the otject of the amendment to the Constitu
tion and declare six per cent, tbe legal inter
est for the use of money, aud make all iuter
e.*t exceeding that usurious.
Without going into the abstract argument
we will merely say that other States fix the
legal rate at a higher figure, aud that in all
the great commercial communities much
higher rates are paid. Therefore we cannot
expect that capitalists will bring money to
Virginia to invest They can do better else
where. Indeed, the State has authorized
various corporations to pay eight per cent.,
and in almost every instance the value of the
corporate bond?or the value of money?has
been determined either by the payment of
interest higher thau six per cent, or the sale
of the bond at much under par.
Now, these are facts not to be gainsaid.
They will not "down." Aud it is Justus
well for the Legislature to look at them.
Some of the States make ten per cent, legal,
some eight, somo seven,and so on. Virginia
need not suppose that the lowest bidder takes
the money. She offers the capitalist no spe
cial Inducements She taaefi him ?? sharply

it drives much capital from Virginia* and
will a^ur*<fly retard her improvement. We
are not la the interest of <^<mey-changers,?'!
Weftitfri the interest of the peopreofYJr
i ginia. Therefore we do"8^rwfih"Tb see cap
ital driven from the State, and deplore the
possibility that Virginia shall enter the mar-1
ket in the?i!ty, and certainly unsuccessful,
character of being the lowest bidder for
money. ...
If there is any one thing that especially
demands the interference of the Federal
Government in the aflairs of the nation it is
in this matter of the interest paid for the
use of money. It is of all things that in which
there should be uniformity over the entire
Union. The differing rates in different J
States are constantly producing trouble and
disturbance of the circulating medium. If j
the exercise of any power by the Federal
Government can be justified by the general
benefits it would impart and the manner in j
which it would promote the " general wel
fare " it would be the exercise of the power ]
to say what should be the rate of interest for
money over the whole Union.
Let us hope that the Legislature will be!
practical enough not to take any step which
will drive away capital, and that the body
will in some way leave the citizen the liberty
of making his own terms for the use of
money, at least within limits that may en- j
able him to compete with the outsider.
Save the question of State debt and finance
generally, we cannot see that there is much
to detain the Legislature for a long time.
We do trust, however, that if there is the |
necessity of again extending the session be
yond tbc limit placed upon it by law there
will be frankness and manliness enough in the
body to do so without a retreat behind
the Govornor's proclamation convening it
ill extra session to accomplish that object.
That was a fault of the last session which
for the sake ot Virginia we hope never to
see repeated.
France?
?is still in the throes of convulsion?this
time, for the sake of humanity, bloodless.
Nothing, however, has yet occurred to in
spire despair that Thiers will not steer her
through the storm. She has been between
Scylla and Charybdis?monarchy and an
archy?for some $me. Thikks deemed that
be had enough recruits from the better part
of both extremes, when combined with the
conservatives, to establish a conservative
government. The vote on Dufaure's reso
lution seemed to sustain his view. The mi
nority was very large, however, arid had it
been united it would have been fearful; but
it was composed of two deadly hostile bodies,
and was, therefore, not so much to be feared.
Yet things seem not to have gone exactly
smooth, for yesterday's telegram announces
first the resignation of the ministers, and j
next their resumption of their portfolios
lios upon the threat of Thiers that he, too;
would resign unless they did so. As all of j
them thus went back and Theiks remained
President, we have still faith that he will put
all things in order for a quiet, conservative ]
government, which is what the people want.
The quiet and gentle rural population of |
France pray for it.
Thiers knows the terrible enemy of |
France?the irreligious lied Republican
party. This ied him to declare a few days
since that he believed in God and in the
Christian religion?an extraordinary declara
tion for the chief ruler of a Christian nation,
but none knew the propriety and force of
the act better than lie did. He saw tbe in
stallation of a prostitute as the goddess of
reason by that mad mob in Paris which for
the time ruled France and shed rivers of
blood to gratify their insane passions. We
trust he will triumph. lie is devoted heart
and soul to his country, has the confidence
of her people, and if he cannot save her from
the anarchists then her chance is almost
desperate.
The Alabama Case.
The case of the two legislative assemblies
in Alabama is another added to the numerous
outrages which have occurred since the war,
and which illustrate the evil of introducing
into the constituent a barbarous element.
"When a body of men composed of those who
are ignorant of law, of those who have no re
spect for it, and of those who arc wholly dis
! honest and corrupt, are elevated to the estate
of legislators we cannot expect from them
auytbing else than lawlessness and corrup
tion. So, here in Alabama, we have a body
of legislators, plainly in open contempt of
law, forcing a quorum by fraud, meeting
daily, claiming to be the legal Legislature,
and the Governor just elected has recognized
them as the real Legislature of the State.
We cannot believe that this .outrage will
be sanctioned by the Government, or any
respectable number of the dominant parly
in this country. Of what advantage can it
be to tbem to inaugurate anareby in the
land? "What can they gain by the disregard
of law and the establishment of the supre
macy of the mob? Parties are being re
formed, and the outrage which affects one
party to-day may be perpetrated upon an
other to-morrow. For the safety of all
parties, for the security of social order, for
the dignity and justice of public administra
tion, we trust this "Alabama case" may be
made the ht occasion for a decision at Wash
ington tbat may increase confidence in the
maintenance of law and order in the land.
The Tribune advises the Greeley electors
to vote for G bant. As they are elected to
vote against Grant we do not sec that it
would gratify anybody or fulfil a duty by
voting for him. It would be as well to give
a blauk vote, as tbe World suggests.
The refusal, yesterday, of the House of
Representatives to allow 3Ir. Banks to re
sign his post as the chairman of the Com
mittee of Foreign Relations is a very good
sign of the gradual extension and increase of
good i'eeliug, and the subordination of party
bitterness. . ?;

^ ^ THE NORTHWEST BOUKPAR^ ?
By the thirty-fourth article of the Treity
of Washington tbe respective claims of the
United States and of Great Britain in their
construction of the treaty of the 15th of
June, 1810, defining the boundary line be
tween their respective territories, were sub
mitted to tbe arbitration and award of his
Majesty the Emperor ot Germany to decide
which of these claims is most in accordance
with the true interpretation of the treaty of
1S4G. llis Majesty the Emperor of Germany,
having been pleased to undertake the arbi
tration, has the earnest thanks of this Gov
ernment and ot the people of the United
States' for the labor, pains, and care which
he baa devoted to the consideration of this
long-pending difference. I have causcd
un expression of my thanks to be
coruniuuicated to his .Majesty. Mr. Ban
croft, the representative of this Government
at Berlin, conducted the ease and prepared
tiie statement on the part of the United
SUites with the ability that his jrast services
justified. the public in expecting at bis hands.
Asa member of the Cabinet at tbe date of the
treaty which has given rise to the discussion
between the two Governments, as tbe 31inis
tcr to Great Britain when tbe construction
now pronounced unfounded was first ad
vanced, and as tlie agent and representative
of the Government to present the case and
to receive the award, be has been associated
with the questioujn all of iis phases, and in
every,stage has manifested u patriotic zeal
and earnestness in maintenance ot the claim
of the United States. He is entitled to much
credit for the access which ha* attended
the submission.
After a paticut investigation of the case and
of the statements of each party his Mnjesty
tbe Emperor, on the 21st day of October last,
signed bis award in writing, decreeing that
the claim of the Government of the United
States that the boundary line between the
territories ot her Britannic Majesty and the
United States shouid be drawn through the
Haro channel is most in accordance with the
true interpretation of the treaty concluded on
the loth of June, 181f?, between the Govern
ments of her Britannic Majesty and of the
Uuited States. Copies of tbe "case" pre
sented on behalf of each Government, and of
the "statement in reply" of each, and a
translation of the award, are transmitted here
with. This award conlirms the United
States in their claim to the important archi
jH'Iago of islands lying between the continent
and Vancouver's island, which for more
th;?.n twenty-six years (ever since the ratitica
tion of the treaty) Great Britain has eon
tested, and leaves us for the first time in the
history of the United States as a nation with
out a question of disputed boundary be
tween our territory and the possessions of
Great Britain on the continent.
PROMPTNESS OK HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT IN
GIVING KFFECT Tu TUE AWARD.
It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the
prompt, s?pontaneoLa> action of her Majesty's
government in giving eli'cct to the award.
In anticipation ol' auy request from this Go
vernment, aud before the reception in tbe
United Stales of the award signed by the
Emperor, her Majesty had given instructions
for the removal of "her troops which had
been stationed there, and for .the cessation of
all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to
leave the Uuited States in the exclusive pos
session of the lately-disputed territory. I
am gratified to be able t6 announce that the
orders for the removal of the troops have
l>cen executed, and that the military joint
occupation. of San Juan has ceased. The
islands are now in the exclusive possession
of tiie Uuited States.
ANOTHER norxjur.v COMMISSION RECOMMENDED.

survey and determination of that portion of

sessions of her The region
is now so .sparsely- occupied that no conflic
li?c interests of individuafsor of jurisdiction,,
are likely to fnterfere fb the delay or em-j
barassment of the actual location of the,
line. If deferred until population shall enter
and occupy the territory, some trivial con
test of neighbors mar again array the two
Governments in antagonism. I therefore
recommend the appointraentof a commission
to act Jointly with one that may be appointed
on the part of Great Britain to determine the
line between our territory of Alaska and the
coterminus possessions of Great Britain^
In my last umraal message I recommended
the legislation necessary on the part of the
United Stateo to bring iuto operation the ar
ticles of the Treaty of Washington of May S,
1871, relating to the fisheries and to other
matters touching the relations of the United
States toward the British North American
possessions, to become operative so sodii as
the proper legislation should be had oft the
part of Great Britain and its possessions.
That legislation oti the part of Great Britain
and its possessions had not then been had^
and during the session of Congress a question
was raised which for the time raised a dOubt I
whether any action by Corigress in the direc
tion indicated would become important.
This question has since bbeti disposed of,
and I have received notice that the Imperial
Parliament and the Legislatures of the pro
vincial governments have passed laws to
carry the provisions of the treaty on the '
matters referred to into operation. I there-'
fore recommend your early adoption of the
legislation in the same direction necessary
on the part of this Government.
The joiut commission for determining the
boundary line between the United States and
the British possessions between the Lake of
tho Woods and the Rocky Moutftains has
organized and entered upon its work. It is
desirable that the force be increased, in order
that the completion of the survey and deter
mination of the line may be the sooner at
tained. To this end I recommend that a
sufficient appropriation be made.
OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER TOWERS.
With France, our earliest ally ; Russia, the I
constant and steady friend of the United
States; Germany, with whose government I
and people we have so many causes of friend-'
ship and so many common sympathies ; and |
the other Powers of Europe, our relations
are maintained on the most friendly terms.
Since my last annual message the exchange
has been made of the ratifications of a treaty |
with the Austro-Hungarian Empire relating
to naturalization ; also of a treaty with the
German Empire respecting consuls and
trade-marks ; also of a treaty with Sweden
and Norway relating to naturalization; all of
which treaties have been duly proclaimed.
INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGRESS AND
EXPOSITION.
Congress at its last session having made
an appropriation to defray the expense of
commissioners on the part of the United
Suites to the International Statistical Con
gress at St. Petcrsburgb, the persons ap
pointed in that character proceeded to their
destination and attended the sessions of the
Congress. Their report shall in due season
be laid before you. This Congress meets at
intervals of about three years, and has held
its sessions in several of the countries of
Europe. 1 submit to your consideration the
propriety of extending an invitation to the
Congress to hold its next meeting in the
United States. The centennial celebration to
be held in 1876 would afford an appropriate
occasion for such meeting.

iiitude. The tendency of these expositions
is in the direction of advanced civilization,
and of the elevation of industry and of labor,
and of the increase of human happiness, as
well as of greater intercourse and good-will
between nations. As the exposition is to be
the first which will have been held in eastern
Europe, it is believed that American inven
tors and manufacturers will be ready to avail
themselves of the opportunity for the pre
sentation of their productions if encouraged
by proper aid and protection.
| At the last session of Congress authority
was given for the appointment of one or
more agents to represent this Government at
t he exposition. The authority thus given has
been exercised, but in the absence of nnv
j appropriation there is danger that the impor
tant bent tits which the occasion oilers will,
in a large degree, be lost to citizens of the
j United States. 1 commend the subject strong
ly to your consideration, and recommend
| that an adequate appropriation be made for
' the purpose. To further aid American ex
hibitors at the Vienna exposition, I would
recommend, in addition to an appropriation
of money, tbat the Secretary of the Navy be
authorized to lit up too naval vessels to trans
port between our Atlantic cities and Trieste,
or the most convenient port to Vienna and
] back, their articles for exhibition.
THE MEXICAN REPUBLIC.
Since your last session the President of
the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his
high character uud by hi.s services to his
country, has died. His temporary successor
! has now been elccted with great unanimity
! bv the people?a proof of confidence on their,
part in his patriotism and wisdom which it
is believed will be confirmed by the results
ol his administration.
It is particularly desirable that nothing
should be left undone by the Government of
either Republic to strengthen their relations
as neighbors and friends. It is much to be
regretted that many lawless acts continue to
disturb the quiet of the settlements on the
border between our territory and that of
Mexico, anil that complaints of wrongs
to American citizeus in various parts of the
couutry are made. The revolutionary con
dition in which the neighboring Republic
has so long been involved has in some de
gree contributed to this disturbance. It is
to be hoped that with a more settled rule of
order through the Republic, which may be
expected from the present Government, the
acts of which just complaints are made will
cease.
The proceedings of the commission under
the convention with 31exico of the 4th of
July, 18G8, on the subject of claims, have,
unfortunately, been checked by an obstacle
for the removal of which measures have been
taken by the two Governments which, it is
believed, will prove successful.
The commissioners appointed pursuant to
the joint resolution of Congress of the 7th |
of May last to inquire into depredations on
the Texan frontier have diligently made in
vestigations iu that quarter, and their re
searches were necessarily incomplete, partly
on account of the limited appropriation made
by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that
Government, has appointed a similar com
mission to investigate these outrages. It is
notannounced officially, but the press of that
-country state that the fullest investigation
is desired, and that the cooperation of all
parties concerned is invited to secure that
end. I therefore recommend that a special
appropriation be made at the earliest day
practicable to enable the commissioners on
the part of the United States to return to
their labors without delay.
THE WAR IN CUBA.
It is with regret that I have again to an
nounce a continuance of the disturbed con
dition of the island of Cuba. No advance
toward the pacification of the discontented
part of the population has been made.
While the insurrection has gained no advan
tages, and exhibits no more of the element*
of power or of the prospects of ultimate
success than were exhibited u year ago, Spain,
on the other hand, has not succeeded iu its
repression, and the parties stand apparently
in the same relative attitude which they have
occupied for a long time past.
This contest bus lasted now for more than
lour years. Were it seen at a distance from
our neighborhood we might be indiilercntto
ils result, although humanity could not be
unmoved by many of its Incidents wherever
they might occur. It Is, however, at our
door.
I cannot doubt that the continued main
tenance of elftTvry in Cuba is Among the

of humanity and of justice, and fn sym
pathy With the other Powers of the Christian
and civilized world. Within the past few
weeks the regulations for carrying out the
law of emancipation have- Been'tuinounded,
giving evidence of the sincerity of inten
tion of the present Government to carry into
effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to
drge the consideration Of the wisdom, the
policy, and the Justice of a more effective
system for the abolition of the great evil
which oppresses a race and continues a
bloody and destructive contest close to otf?
border, as well as the expediency and the
justice of conceding reforms of which the
propriety is not.questioned.
Deepiy impressed .with the conviction that
the continuance of slavery is one of tliem^st
active causes of the continuance of the un
happy condition in Cuba; I regret to beiieve
that citizens of the United States, or those
claiming to be such, are large holders in
Cuba of what ft there claiihecT as property,
but which is forbiddeii. and denounced by
the laws or the United Stated They are
thus, in defiance of the spirit -of our own
laWs, contributing to the continuance of this
distressing and sickening contest. In my.
last annual message I referred to this sub-!
ject, and I again recommend such legislation
as may be proper to denounce and, if not
prevent, at least to discourage American
citizens from holding or dealing in slaves,
sorrn and centhal amekican governments.
It is gratifying to announce that the ratifi
cations of the convention-concluded under
the auspices ol this .(Government between
fjpaiu on the oue part, and tbe allied repub
lics of the Pacific on the other, providing
for an armistice, have been exchanged. A
copy of the. instrument is herewith sub
mitted. It is hoped tjbat this may be followed
by a permanent peace between tbe same par
ties. The differences which at one time
threatened the maintenance of peace between
Brazil and the Argentine republic, it is
hoped, are in the way of satisfactory adjust
ment. . .. . ,-7 ?/ t j
With the states as with the republics of
Central and South America we continue to
maintain the most frieudly relations. It is
with regret, however, I annouuee that the
Government of Venezuela has made no fur
ther payment oh account of the award under
tbe convention of the 20th of April, 1S66.
The latter republic is understood to be now
almost il not quite tranquillized. It is hoped,
therefore, that it will lose no time iu provid
ing for tbe unpaid balance of its debt to the
United States,.. which, having originated id
injuries to our citizens by Venezuelan au
thorities, and having been acknowledged
pursuant to a treaty in tbo most solemn form
known among nations, would seem to de
serve a preference over debts of a different
origin and contracted iu a different manner.
This subject is again recommended to the
attention of Congress for such action as may
be deemed proper.
J AT AX AND CHINA. .
Our treaty relations with Japan remain
unchanged. An imposing embassy from
that interesting and progressive nation
visited tiiis country (luring the year that is
passing, but being unprovided with powers
tor the signing of a convention in tins coun
try, no conclusion iu that direction was
reached. It is hoped, however, that the
interchange of opinions which took place
during their stay in this country has led to a
mutual appreciation ol the interests which
may be promoted when the revision of the
existing treaty shall be undertaken. In tins
connection I renew my,recommendation of
one vear ago, that to give importance and to
add to the efficiency of our diplomatic rela
tions with Japan and China, and to turther
aid in retaining the good opinion ot those
peoples, and to secure to the United states a
share of the commerce dc-tined to flow be
tween those nations and the balance ot the
commercial world, an appropriation be made
to support at least four American youths in
each of those countries to serve as a part ot
the official family of our ministers there.
Our representatives would not even then be
placed upon an equality with the representa
tives of Great Britain and of some other
Powers. As now situated, our represents
tives in Japan and China have to depend for
interpreters and translators upon natives ot
those countries who know our language lin
nerfectlv, or procure for the occasion the ser
vices of employin foreign business bouses
or the interpreters to other toreign minis
ters.
TEKR1T0K1KS. , f ,
I renew the recommendation made on a
previous occasiou of the transfer to the De
partment of the Interior, to which they seem
more appropriately to belong, ot nil thepow
ers and duties in relation to the territories
with which the Department ot btate is now
charged by law or by custom.
bklief.of citizens abroad in* distkess.
Congress, from the beginning of the Gov
ernment, has wisely made provision for the
relief of distressed seamen iu foreign coun
tries. No similar provision, however, has
hitherto been made for the relief of citizen,
in distresH abroad other than seamen. It is
understood to be customary with otbei gov
ernments to authorize consuls to extend such
relief to their citizens or subjects in ceitaiu
cases.
A similar authority and an appropria
tion lo carry it into effect are recom
mended in the case of citizens of the United
States destitute or sick under such circum
stances. it is well known that such citizeus
resort to foreign countries in great numbers.
Though most of theui are able to bear the
expenses incident to locomotion, there are
some who, through accident or otherwise,
become penniless, and have no friends at
home able to succor them. Persons in this
situation must either.perlsh, cast themselves
upon the charity of foreigners, or be re
lieved at the private charge of our own offi
cers, who usually, even with the most bene
voleut dispositions, have nothing to spare for
such purposes. Should tho- authority and
appropriation asked for be granted, care will
.be taken lo carry thebenetkonce^of Congress
i into sdeh effect that it'shall not be unnecessa
rily and uuworthily bestowed.

sufficient revenue to meet current expenses
of Government, pay interest on the pubjic

national credit is of the highest importance,

duty to provide a national currency of fixed,
unvarying value as compared with gold, aud
as soon as practicable, having due regard for

WAR DEPABTMEjrr.
The report of the Secretary of War shows
the expenditures of the War Department for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 187 J, to be
$35,799,991. 82, and I or the ffac.il vear ending
June 3U, 1872, to be ?35,372,159.20, showiug
a reduction in favor of the last fisvstti year ot
?427,S34.G2. The estimates for military
appropriations for the next fiscal year ending
June 30, 1874, aro ?33,8U1,378.78. The csu
unites of the Chief of Engineers are sub
mitted separately for fortifications, river and
harbor improvements, and for public build
ings andgioufids,and the Washington aqua
duct. The affairs of tne Freedman's Bureau
have all been transferred to the War Depart
ment, and regulations have been put into
execution for / the speedy payment of
bounty, pay, &c.t due colored soldiers,
properly coining under that Bureau. All
war accounts for mouey and property prior
to 1871 have been examined aud transmitted
to the Treasury for final settlement. During
the tiscal year there has been paid for trans
portation on railroads ?1,300,000, of which
8800,857 was over the Pucitic railroad; for
transportation by water $620,873.52, and by
stage ?48,975.80; and for the purchase of
transportation animals, wagons, hire of
teamstei s, &c., $924,650.04. About ?370,000
have been collected from southern railroads
during the year, leaving about $40,000 still
due. The Quartermaster has examined and
transmitted to the accounting ollicers for son
tlement 7,172.72 of tla.ms by loyal citi
zens lor quartermaster's stores taken durint:
t le war. Subsistence supplies to the amount
of ?89,048.12 have been issued to Indian*.
The annual average mean strength of the
army was 24,101 white and 2,494 colored >ob
diers. The total deaths for the year report* d
were 165 white and 54 colored. The distri
bution of the Medical and Surgical History
of the War is yet to be ordered ty Cougre.-s.
There exists an absolute necessity for a medi
cal corps of the full number established bv
act of Congress of July 28, I860, there being
now fifty-nine vacancies, and the number of
successful applicants rarely exceeds eight or
ten m anyone year.
j The river and harbor improvements have
been carried ou with energy and economy.
Though many are only partially completed,
the results have secured to commons
greater depth of channel, greater security in
Navigation, and the saving of tfmo adds
millions to the wealth of the country and In
creases the resources of the Government.
The bridge across tbo Mississippi river at
liock Island has been completed, and tbo
proper site has been determined upon tor
the bridge at La Crosse.
The able and exhaustive report made by
tho commissioner appointed to investigate
the Sutro tunnel has been trausmittea to
Congress.
[ The observations and reports of the Signal
Office have b6en continued, stations have
been maintained at eneh of the principal hke,
seaport, and river cities. Ten additional
stations have been established in the United
States, and arrangements have been made
for an exchange of reports with Canada;
and a similar exchauge of observations is
contemplated with the West India islands.
The favorable attention of Congress is in
vited to tho following recommendation of
the Secretary of War: A discontinu ancc of
the api>ointment of extra lieutenants to serve
as adjutants and quartermasters; the adop
tion of a code providing special penalties for
well-defined offences, so that the inequality
ot sentences by courts-martial may be ad
justed; the consolidation of accounts under
which expenditures are made as a measure
of economy; an appropriation of the money
for the coubtructlon ot a dep6fc at San
Antonio, the title to the site being now per
fected ; a special act placing the cemetery at
the City of 3Ioxtco ou the same basis as
otiier national cemeteries; authority to pur
chase sites for military posts in Texas; the
appointment of commissary-sergeants from
non-commissioned officers us a measure for
securing the better car? and protedion
of supplies; an appropriation for the
publication of the catalogue and tables
of the anatomical section of the army
medical mu>euin j, uu appropriation of
the amount for the manufacture of breech
loading arms, should the selection be so de
layed by the board of officers as to leave the
former appropriations unexpended at the
close of the fiscal year; the sale of such arse
nals east of the Mississippi as can be spared,
aud the proceeds applied to the establish
ment, of out large arstmal of construction aud
repair upon the Atlantic coast, and the pur
chase of a suitable site for a proving and ex
perimental grouud for heavy ordnance; tho
abrogation of laws which deprive inventors
hi the United States service from deriving
any benefit from their inventions; the re
peal of thy law prohibiting promotions In
the staff corps; a continuance of the work
upon cOaH defences;-the repeal of the 70th
section of the act of July 13th, 1866, taking
from engineer soldiers tue^r Uitm granted
to other troop*; limitation of time for prc
sentuion of old war-claims for subsistence
supplies^ under art of July 4, 186-J, and a
modification in the mode of the selection of
?'adets for the military academy, 4c order fo
enhance the usefulness of the academy, which"
is, impaired by reason of the large amount
of tune necessarily exj>eiidcd in giving new
cadets a thorough kuowiedge of the .mere
elementary branches of learning, which they
should acquire before entering the academy;
also, an appropriation for philosophical ap
paratus, and an increase in the numbers aud
pay of the military academy band.
Otftt WATKR LiKKS.
The attention of.Congress will be callcd,
during its preseut s^won, to various enter
prises for the more certain and cheaper trans
portation of the constantly increasing sur
plus of western aud southern products to
the Atlantic seaboard. The subject is one
tiira will force itselt upon the legislative

be taken to gam all available information to
insure equable and just legkbuiou. One
