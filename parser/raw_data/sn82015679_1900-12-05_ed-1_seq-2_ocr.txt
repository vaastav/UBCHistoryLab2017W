Thlj estimate Is for a canal suitable for
navigation ty the largest ships now In
existence, and thus in accordance with thi
term of the bill pending In Congress. It
provides for a double system oL locks, so
that navigation can be maintained If one
nystem be closed for repairs or renewals.
If a dng:Ie lockage system Is provided th
cost will be reduced ?i:.bT'.ynO. Narrowing
the bottom one-third will permit u fur
ther reduction of $16.943.000. This would
bring Uie estimated cost down to S1G3,-
Concerning the Panama route, the com
mission nays Its natural attraction lies in
the combination of a very narrow isthmus
with a low summit. The width of the isth
mus is less than thirty-five miles, while
the summit Is barely 30) feet above mean
tide. After a detailed description of the
entire route, the commission gives the fol
lowing estimated cosb of completing the
Panama canal route:
Colon entrance and harbor 57,33 1,673

Aggregate $142,312.373
This estimate Is capable of reduction to
$113,011.213, If single locks and a narrow
bottom are adopted. An alternative esti
mate is submitted, based on having the AI
hajuela dam built to Impound the waters
of the upper Charges. This estimate Is
5136.37S.23.S. The commission reports that
the value of the French work already done
is estimated at $33.931.4!.
It is estimated that the tonnage that
would Uie the canal would amount to 7,030,
027 tons in 1U09.
COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES.
Referring to the commercial advantages
of an Isthmian waterway, the report says:
"As compared with Europe, the United
States will derive trom the canal far great
er benefits, both commercially and indus
trially. The commerce of Europe with the
Pacific coast of North. Central and South
America, under existing conditions, is
somewhat larger than the total volume of
the present traffic of the United States that
may b-2 considered tributary to the canal,
but this fact does not Indicate the relative
advantages which the canal will possess
for the trade of Europe and that of the
United States. As soon as It has been
opened our trade with the west coast of
South America will rapidly Increase, as
will also the volume of our trade with the
Orient. The amount of the American
commerce through the canal will quickly
turpass the total amount of European
traffic.
"An isthmian canal will strengthen the
unity of the national and political Interests
of the United States, develop its Pacific
territory and promote the commerce and in
dustries of the entire country. The beneiiu
which Europe will derive from th c.tnai
will be commercial. In addition to this,
ours will be political and industrial. By
bringing the Eastern and Western sections
of our country into closer relations, by re
ducing the time and cost of transporting
our Western products to Europe, and by
enabling the Eastern, Southern and Central

(lueer Antic of the Wind.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4. What seemed to be
the end of a big rainstorm was accom
panied this evening by strange antics on
the part of the wind. At 8:50 o'clock the
wind was light, but at 9:23 it was blowing
atventy-two miles an hour from the north
west, having changed its direction from
the east. Up to 9:20 o'cUck 1.36 inches of
rain had fallen In this city. At 3:13 o'clock
this afternoon the wind was blowing seventy-two
miles an hour from the east,
but It gradually subsided, to come again
at an equally great velocity from the
northwest. At H o'clock this evening the
türm was centra.! over the city. Th
weather experts said New York city would
continue' to have hlRh winds and that
cooler weather Is coining, although the
temperature may not fall to freezing.
Though no ferious damage was done to
hipping in New York harbor by the gaio
Tihich upent its greatest wrath on the Jer
sey coast to-day, the evening tide reached
record height on the Manhattan arid
Brooklyn shores. About 4:30 tho jjalo blew
ixty miles an hour along the Jert-ey shore.
At 10 o"clock. when the rain stopped, the
wind approached gale-like dimension
a'ong Park row. and one gust stronger
than the rest struck the plate glass win
dow In a Nassau-street store, shivering
the thick window into fragments.
States to reach the raw materials and mar
kets of Pacific countries cheaply and ex jk- -ditiously,
the canal will more fully Jdeniliv
political and social Interests and quicken
the industrial activity of every section ol
the United States. The Iron and steel, the
textiles and the other manufactures of the
Eastern and Southern States, the coal from
the mining regions. - the cotton from the
South and the grain and forest products
from many sections will flow out to foreign
countries in an Increasing volume, and IhU
larger trade will be shared generally by
the ports of all our seaboards the Atlantic,
the gulf and the Pacific. The canal will
cause the competition of the United States
with Europe In the countries of Western
South America and the Orient to be much
keener, with the result that the trade of
our country will Increase more rapidly than
will that of our rivals. The canal will aid
the United States In securing and main
taining a position of primacy in the Inter
national trade of the world."
The commission concludes with a careful
comparison of the Nicaragua and Panama
routes. It shows that distances between
Atlantic and Pacific ports are shorter by
the Nicaragua than the Panama route. This
Is, In part, offset by the Increased time in
getting through the Nicaragua canal. The
latter route is reported to be more favorable
for sailing vessels. The Nicaragua route is
also regarded as advantageous through Its
development of the country through which
it passes.
It is pointed out that the Panama con
cession, now held by the French Company,
prohibits a cession of rights to any nation
or foreign government. The concession Is
limited, so that If the United States ac
quired it there would not be an absolute
ownership In perpetuity, as the concession
provides that the canal shall pass to Co
lombia after ninety-nine years. The com
mission has asked President Hutln, of the
French Company, to name terms on which
the company will dispose of its property
and interests to the United States. No for
mal reply was received until the commit
sion's report was being closed. The report
says the conferences have resulted in no
offer to dispose of the property to the
United States upon any terms, nor had the
company expressed any desire to negotiate
with the United States with reference to
such a disposition. It was proposed by
President Hutln that the United States
might obtain control of the canal scheme
as a majority stockholder of a new or
ganization. The company prefers, howevei,
to reincorporate in the United States and
accord to this government such represen
tation on its board of directors and such
purchase of interest as Its concessions per
mitted. FINAL CONCLUSIONS.
The final conclusions of the commission
are stated as follows:
"First The estimated cost of building the
Nicaragua canal is about $3S.C00,000 more
than that of completing the Panama canal,
leaving out the cost of acquiring the latter
property. This measures the difference in
the magnitude of the obstacles to be over
come in the actual construction of the two
canals and covers all physical considera
tions, such as the greater or less height of
dams, the greater or less depth of cuts, the
presence or absence of natural harbors, the
presence or absence of a railroad, the ex
emption from or liability to disease, and
the amount of work remaining to be done.
The new Panama Canal Company has
shown no disposition to sell its property to
the United States. Should that company
be able and willing to sell, there is reason
to believe the price would not be such as
would make the total cost to the United
States less than that of the Nicaragua
canal.
"Second The Panama canal, after com
pletion, would be shdrter. have fewer locks
and less curvature than the Nicaragua
canal. The measure of these advantages is
.the time required for a vessel to pass
through, which is estimated for an average
ship at twelve hours for Panama and
thirty-three hours for Nicaragua. On the
other hand the distance from San Francis
co to New York Is 377 miles, to New Or
leans t73 miles and to Liverpool 3S6 mlle3
greater via Panama than via Nicaragua.
The time requited to pass over these dis
tances being greater than the difference in
the time in transit through the canals, the
Nicaragua line, after completion would bo
somewhat the more advantageous of the
two to the United States, notwithstand
ing the greater cost of maintaining the
longer canal.
"Third The government of Colombia, in
which lies the Panama canal, has granted
an exclusive concession, which still has
many years to run. It is not free to grant
the necessary rights to the United States,
except on condition that an agreement be
reached with the new Panama Canal' Com
pany. The commission believes that such
agreement is Impracticable. So far as can
be ascertained the company is not will
ing to sell its franchise, but it will allow
the United States to become the owner of
part of Its 'stock. The commission considers
such an arrangement inadmlssable. The
governments of Nicaragua and Costa. Rica,
on the other hand, are untrammeled by con
Cessions, and are free to grant to the
United States such privileges as may be
mutually agreed upon.
"In view of all the facts, and particular
ly in view of all the difficulties of obtaining
the necessary rights, privileges and fran
chises on the Panama route, and assuming
that Nicaragua and Costa Rica recognize
the value of the canal to themselves and
are prepared to grant concessions on terms
which are reasonable and acceptable to th-
l.'nited States, the commission is of opinion
that the most practicable and feasible route
for an isthmian canal to be under the con
trol, management and ownership of the
United States, Is that known as the Nica
ragua, route."
The message of the President, transmit
ting the report. Is as follows:
"To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: I transmit herewith, for the Infor
mation of the Congress, a preliminary re
port of the isthmian canal commission,
dated Nov. 30. 19v.
"WILLIAM M KINLEY,
"Executive Mansion, Dec. 4, 1900."
Attempt to Scare American
LONDON. Dec. 4. The Times, referring
to President McKinley's allusions to the
Nicaragua canal, says: "It is a fascinating
scheme, but we have some doubt as to
whether the canal would be commercially
worth cutting. The analogy with the Suez
canal Is very imperfect. The Isthmus of
Suez lies along one of the greatest trade
routes and Joins great trading communi
ties. It has no railway rivals. Nicaragua
lacks all of these advantages. It is rather
sad to think that such a striking correc
tion of nature may fail to pay its way;
but the objections are serious and they
have not yet received all the attention
they merit."
"Great Britain cannot but view with
satisfaction the cutting of the Nicaragua
canal," says the Morning Post, "provided
It is free to all nations at equal rates in
time of peace and Is treated as part of the
open sea during war. This is the mini
mum of the British demand. We trust
that our neighbors will see that it is just."
