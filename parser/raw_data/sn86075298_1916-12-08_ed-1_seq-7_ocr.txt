CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE BEGINS
RAILWAY INQUIRY
Proposed by President to Bet
ter Condition of Ca riors,
MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM
Officials of Roads Prepared to Advocate
Federal Incorporation, Supervision of
Securities and Extension of Authority
of Interstate Commerce Commirsion.
Washington. Nov. 20.-Ten members
of Congress, five Senators and five
members of the [louse of llepresenta
lives, hegan here today an inquiry into
the subject of public control and su
pervislon of railroads that may lead to
the revolutionizing of the whole scheme
of governmental regulilt ol) of I1h c('wnt
try's transportation lines. I:iidcnta'll
the committco is to lePok into the ques
tion of government ownersllii) of 1all
ways. telephone and tc:ograph lines
and express, companies.
The members of the commit ter
which will conduct this imnportantt in
restigation are Semitor Nyvviands of
Nevada. chairman: Sciuntors Itobin-or
of Arkansas. inderwolUo of Alabama
Cummins of lowa and 13randegee of
Connecticut. and Representatives Ad
anison of Georgia. Sims of Tennessee.
Cullop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin
and Hamilton of Michigan. The In
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to Congress in
December of last year. He described
as its purpose to determine what could
be done "for bettering the conditions
under which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of all
interests affected by the operations of
the transportation lines the committee
has invited prominent shippers, hank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations. railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them.
The first to be heard are railroad
commissioners of various states who
began their evidence today. Their
testimony is directed chiefly to oppos
ing any enlargement of the federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will be followed
shortly by officials of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to the increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
Chief interest in the hearings cen
ters in the proposals that will be put,
forward by representatives of the rail
roads, for it is reported that they wi!l
advocate an extension of federal au
thority over rates and securities to the
practical exclusion of state control of
these matters. It is understood also that
they will go on record in favor of fed
eral incorporation of all railroad lines.
Legislative Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative source is, ob
tained the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider in
its investigation: They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects in the pres
ent system of railroad regulation is
the lack of coordination resulting from
the simultaneous and conflicting regu
lation by the federal government and
by the 48 states. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed in the hands of a federal
body so that interstate traffic may be
regulated without reference to state
lines, leaving to the state commissions
jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
plan, a compulsory system of federal
incorporation is to be recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond issues.
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will be asked.
in order to enable the commission prop
erly to exercise its increased powers.
It is also proposed that the preparation
and prosecution of cases against the
railroads shall be delegated to some
other agency of the government, possi
bly the Department of Justice, so that
the commission may devote its ener
ries to its administrative functions.
With the commission thus relieved
of some of its present duties and equip
ped to handle its business more prompt
ly, the railroads will urge that the pe
riod during which the commission may
now suspend proposed increases in
rates be reduced from ten months to
60 days. with provision for reparation
to be paid to the shippers if the ad.
vance shall be declared unreasonable.
They will also ask that the commis
sion be given the power to prescribe
minimum as well as maximum rates
so that in meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the advance of a rate which it consid
ers too low.
One of the most important recom
mendations for which the railroads
will ask favorable consideration is
that the commission he specifically
authorized to take into account in
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total earnings in the light of ex
penses.
While the Newlands Committee is
required, under the resolution creat
ing it, to submit a report by January
2 next, it is not anticipated that the
Committee will have come anywhere
near completing its labors then.
NEW POLICY NEEDED
IN GOVERNMENT
RAILWAY CONTROL
Helpfulness and Encouragement
Urged by Alfred P. Thom.
CREDIT MUST BE IMPROVED
Increase of Transportation Facilities
Necessary to Secure Relief From
High Cost of Living May Thus Do
Provided For by the Railroads.
Washington, Nov. 28.-A new policy
of government railroad regulation,
based on constructive principles of
helpfulness and encouragement instead
of upon principles of repression and
punishment, was urged by Alfred P.
Thom, counsel for the Hallway Execu
tives' Advisory Committee, the first
witness on behalf of the railro.,ls be
fore the Newlands Joint Committee on
Interstate Commerce, which has insti
tuted a general inquiry into the prob
lems of railroad regulation.
"It is proposed by the joint resolu
tion of Congress," said Mr. Thom, "to
go into a comprehensive study of the
whole subject of transportation, to
make a new assessment. after 29 years
of experiment, of its history, its pres
ent conditions and its future needs.
The railroads accept the view that reg
ulation is a permanent and enduring
part of government in America and
that the first duty of the carriers is to
the public. That duty Is to afford
reasonable facilities on reasonable
terms and at reasonable rates, and this
must be done before any private inter
ests can be considered."
Certainty, Safety and Sufficiency.
AMr. Thom contended that the real in
terest of the public is in being assured
of certainty, safety and sufficiency of
transportation facilities, rather than in
rates. The first consideration of the
public is to obtain transportation facili.
ties. What the cost is. is in reality a
second consideration, he said.
Mr. Thom proposed an increase of
transportation facilities as a metuod
of securing relief from the high cost
of living. '"There have been less than
1,000 miles of new railroad construct
ed in the United States during the past
year," le said, "less than In any year
since 1848, except the period of the
Civil War, and yet the cost of living is
daily advancing owing to a shortage of
supplies which might be remedied by
securing access to new areas of pro
duction.
Credit Must Be Improved.
"This leads to the consideration as to
whether railroad credit is as good as
the public interest requires. It is im
possible for railroads to earn enough
to supply the necessary new facilities
from current revenue. They must he
provided from credit. Investors can
not be coerced, but must he attracted."
Among the conditions affecting rail
road credit which deter investors he
mentioned the following:
"First, Railroad revenues are not
controlled by investors, but are fixed
and limited by governmental authority
and not by one but by several govern
mental authorities, which do not recog
nize responsibility for assured results
to investors and are uncoordinated.
"Second, Railroads cannot control
and the government cannot and does
not limit the expense account.
"Third, The present system of regu.
lation is based on a policy of regulation
and correction and not on a policy of
helpfulness and encouragement.
"Fourth, The outstanding obligations
of the railroads have already exceeded
the financial rule of safety and involve
a disproportionate amount of obliga
tions hearing fixed charges.
"Fifth, The investor must accept a
subordinate obligation or security wit Ii
nolassurance of a surplus of earning,
to support It.
"Sixth, Other competitive lines of in
vestment present superior attractions.
"Seventh, The railroad business is
largely controlled by political instead
of business considerations.
Look Forward, Not Back.
"We may debate about what tias
caused the present conditions," said
Mr. Thom, "but we cannot debate about
what the people need. The President
has taken the view that we must look
forward in this matter and 'make a
fresh assessment of circumstances' in
order to deal helpfully and intelligent
ly with the problem. Abuses are
no more prevalent in the railroad bugi
ness today than in any other business
humanely conducted. The great ques
tion now is whether the existing sys
tem of regulation gives the public re
liable assurance of sufficient present
and future railroad facilities. -
'Those who oppose any change must
make their appeal on the ground that
the present systems assure the public
of the continued adequacy of trans
portation facilities. If they do not, no
argument based on the desirability of
the present dual system of regulation
will be accepted by public judgment.
The question of 'states' rights' is not
involved. If the regulation of transpor
tation facilities privately owned should
fail government ownership must fol
low, and then all power of the states
over the railroads would disappear.
*'Let us debate this question, then,
not upon any mere theory or jealousy
to to the distribution of governmental
power, but upon the large issue of
what the public interest requires In
respect of the assurance of adequate
transportathe ter ie.'"
GREEKS PROTEST
TO UNITED STATES
Washington, Dec. 4.-A note de
pouncing as "a serious infringement
of sovereign rights" the allied demand
for surrender of Greek arms and am
munition to the Anglo-French expedi.
tion at Saloniki, and pleading for the
sympathetic understanding of the
United States in the "painful circum
stances" surrounding the Greek gov
ernment and people, was delivered to
the state department 1y A. Vouros,
charge of the Greek legation.
The communication sets forth at
length the efforts of Greece to main
tain neutrality and gives notice that
the Greek government "has rejected
and will continue to reject this last
demand."
