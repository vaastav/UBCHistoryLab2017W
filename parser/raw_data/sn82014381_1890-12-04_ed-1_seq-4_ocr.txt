INDIAN TROUBLE..
TUe Rapid Concentration of Troops Pre
v-ul_ un 0.t1i,-«ak,
Cni< __o, December 3d.—General Miles
arrived from Washington this morning,
and it is understood that be wili at once
proceed to Ihe scene of disturbance among
the Indians in the Northwest. He has de
cided to mount the two infantry regiments
which have been ordered to Omaha—the
First from Califarnia and the Seventh from
Denver. Horses are being hastily got to
gether for the purpose.
Orders have been received from Wash
ington for the enlistment of 1,200 Indians
for attachment to the various regiments in
the neighborhood of the Indian troubles,
two troops to each cavalry regiment and
two companies to each infantry.
COLONEL HETTL'. REPORT.
Inspectc r General Heyl, of the Division
of the Missouri, returned to headquarters
this morning after an absence of nearly
two weeks in the Northwest. "From
Chicago I went to Pine Ridge,'' said
Colonel Heyl. "When I reached there on
the _<>.h I found the Indians quiet and evi
dently inclined to be peaceful. There is
no doubt that the rapid concentration of
troops at Pine Ridge prevented an out
break. Many reports sent by correspond
ents are sensational, and are working great
injury to the settlements. Many settlers
have sold their stock at a sacrifice and are
leaving the country. I left Pine Ridge the
night before last. It was snowing hard
and a blizzard was blowing which will no
doubt cool the ardor of the young bucks,
while the older ones are pacific in disposi
tion."
FEASTIS _ THE WOULD BE M_RDE»EBS.
thr..n... December 3d.—A special to the
Omaha Bee from Pine Ridge says it is z;ro
weather there, and a driving storm of cut
ting sleet prevails. The troops are hug
ging the campfires and the Indians are
freezing in their tepees. To-day Agent
Royer will call in all the Indians at the
agency and give them a big feed at the
storehouse. Should the present storm con
tinue, and particularly should there be a
heavy fall of snow, the ponies of the In
dians now here and those that have been
stolen by the hostiles would die of starva
tion. At best, this winter will inevitably
be very tough on the copper faces who
have bowed their heads to the Government
rule in the present instance, while their
rebellious and thriving brothers are living
on the fat ofthe land.
TROOPS ORDERED FORWARD.
Washington, December 3d.—General
Schofield received a telegram this morning
saying affairs are quiet and unchanged at
Rosebud Agency. Orders were issued to
day for the First, Fifth and Seventh Reg
iments of infantry to proceed at once to the
scene of threatened outbreak.
NEW ENLISTMENTS.
Chicago, December 3d.—An order was
received from the War Department this
afternoon authorizing the enlistment in the
Division of the Missouri of not to exceed
two troops of Indians for each of the cav
alry regiments serving therein, and two
companies for each infantry regiment serv
ing in the vicinity of the Sionx and Chey
enne reservation, the whole not to exceed
two troops and companies of sixty men
each.; in all, 1,200 men.
GENERAL MILEB TO GO NORTH.
Chicago, December 3d.—General Miles
this evening said it was his intention to
start for the Northwest in a few days. His
visit will be for the purpose of thoroughly
organizing and locating the troops at avail
able and useful points.
STRENGTHENING THEIE POSITIONS.
Chicago, December 3d.—The Omaha
Bee's Pine Ridge correspondent telegraphs
to-night that the hostiles are still making
every effort to strengthen their position in
the Bad Lande. They have squaws at
work digging rifle-pits along all points
where the soldiers are likely to come.
They have all the cattle they have stolen
well into the interior of the region for pro
tection. The military is still quiet.

Resolution Introduced Opposing the
Lodge Election Bill.
Ocola (Fla.), December ;;d.—The sensa
tion of the morning session ol the Far
mers' Alliance was when President Living
ston of the Georgia Alliance, to a question
of privilege, denounced as infamously false
an insinuation in certain newspapers aimed
at Dr. MoKiine and himself, and even at
President Polk, in connection with the re
cent sensational contest in Georgia. He
demanded the appointment of a fair and
impartial committee to thoroughly investi
gate the charges.
President Polk and Dr. McKune also
spoke, and it was decided that a committee
of investigation be appointed, to consist of
one member from each State delegation, to
make a thorough and searching investiga
tion, in accordance with the demand of the
gentleman concerned.
At the afternoon session W. S. McAllis
ter, of Mississippi, introduced a preamble
and resolution setting forth that the Presi
dent of the United States recommends and
urges the immediate passage ol the Lodge
bill; that said bill involves a radical revo
lution in the election machinery of the
Union, and its passage wiil be fatal to the
autonomy of State and cherished liberties
of citizens ; that said bill is partisan in
speech and will be partisan in application :
tbat we do most solemnly protest against
the passage oi said bill, and most earnestly
petition our Senators to employ all final
and legal means to defeat this unpatriotic
measure, which can result in nothing but
evil to oar common and beloved country.
McAllister made a strong speech in favor
of the resolution.
Delegate Deming of Pennsylvania said he
regarded the introduction of the resolution
as untimely; that there was largely pre
valent at the North a feeling that the
Farmers' Alliance was a Southern organi
zation, and that the passage of these reso
lutions would strengthen their opinion and
check tbe growth of the Alliance in the
North and East.
A delegate from Illinois expressed the
sentiment that he feared the adoption of
the resolution would conhrm the charge
that the Farmers Alliance is a partisan
body. The Alliance is getting a grip in the
West and in localities where the Republi
can sentiment is strong. Thi9 action of
the National Order would tend to throw it
into political di.repute, and stop its expan
sion over the West and Northwest.
After several other speeches, however,
McAllister's motion to adopt the resolu
tion was pat and carried _nani__o_sly.
amid wild enthusiasm.
A resolution was also adopted denounc
ing the Louisiana lottery as a blow at
American civilization an_ morals, and
asking for the submission to the people of
America of an amendment to the Ameri
can constitution prohibiting the operation
of lotteries in any State.
A resolution will be offered to-morrow
indorsing Senator Stanford's bill for loan
ing money at two per cent, interest on
mortgages to rnn thirty years.

ing to the heavy storm, were unable to
render assistance. The identity of the
schooner is unknown.
Startling Experiment.
That is rather a startling experiment
which is being carried on by Miss Alii
Trvgg, a young Finnish woman, who, ac
cording to a London weekly, is devoting
her life to improving the condition of the
working class in Finland. She began with
a workman's kitchen, where he can get his
daily meals, wholesome and appetizing, at
a nominal expense. Attached to this is a
reading-room. Both schemes have been
successful, and Miss Trygg's next move,
and this is the startling one, was to start a
brewery. The ale brewed, it is stated, is
of a "light, non-intoxicating character.''
The popularity of this scheme is also at
tested, for already the young brewer em
ploys 900 men in her malt works and beer
cellars. This is literally taking the bull
by the horns, but it must be admitted the
place has its advantages. If the working
man must have his beer it certainly seems
better that he should have the presumably
pure, cheap and harmless beverage which
these friends will serve him than the ex
pensive, adulterated intoxicant he usually
gets elsewhere.

SKIN CANCER.
Several year- ago I was called to see a colored
woman wno had a malignant form of canctr on
;:• r: ... The cancer grew worse under tbe pre
scribed treatment, and the toes and one side at
tlie foot were at Ic-r.gth eaten entirely away.
The patient couid not heve survived much lon
ger, but I commenced the use of Swift's Spe
cific, and it cured her sound well. That was
three years ago, and there ha« been no re
tnra of the disease. I regarl Swift's Specific a
most excellent medicine to Mood diseases, as
its tendency- is to '.rhe 1 in the poison,

CANCER OF THE TONGUE.
Par three or four yetirs I had an eating sore
on my tongue that made a considerable hole in
it. I became alarmed at its progress, and went
to Atlanta for treatment. The r_sr.lt was that
I commenced the nse O. Swift's Specific, and
the sore was soon gone, without a trace of it left.
