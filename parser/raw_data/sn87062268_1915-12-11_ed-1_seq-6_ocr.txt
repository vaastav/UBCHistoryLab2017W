KNOWN YOUNG .MAN, AC
CUSED OF HELPING HIMSELF
TO HOLIDAY STOCK.
Deputy Sheriff Marble yesterday
placed under arrest a young man
named Urlich ' Andrews, who resides

pecans which had been' gathered at
the Goldbach place, for the holiday
frade.
Several days ago Mrs. Goldbach
reported to the police station that
someone had about cleaned up her
stock of pecans which were being of
fered the holiday trade. Of the 200
pounds or more of nuts which she
had gathered from her place, and
which were to have been sold to a
local buyer, some unknown person, a
few days since, had helped himself to
more than half.
About the same time some unknown
person was stated to have offered a
local dealer pecans at a very low
price, saying , he could furnish as
much as 300 pounds or more. This
unknown party ' never showed up a
second time, and his identity was not
disclosed, v ' '

AMUSEMENTS
1 "A Woman's Past."
In this marvelous William Fox pho
toplay, Nance CNeil is cast as Jane
Hawley, a struggling authoress. In
the course of her efforts to dispose of
her manuscripts, she encounters the
editor of a famous magazine, Sterling
by name, who gives her employment.
Jane falls in love with Sterling, a
thorough-paced rascal, and the inevi
table happens Despite Jane's plead
ings, her scoundrelly employer re
fuses to marry her. She leaves him
and soon afterward Wilson Stanley,
a former friend of Sterling's, falls in
love with and marries her. Three years
later, Stanley is called to the Philip
pines on Government service. Jane
and her little son live with her father-in-law,
waiting for the return of Stan
ley. One day she meets her betrayer
on the street. He follows her home.
See what follows this occuranee, in
the feature appearing at the Isis to
day. "A Girl of Yesterday."
Appearing at the Isis tomorrow is
one of the most novel features that
America's Sweetheart has ever ap
peared in. Mary Pickf ord is seen in
this particular picture making a true
to life aeroplane flight accompanied
by the famous aviator, Glen Martin.
She is featured in this picture with
her brother. Jack, and they make a
very clever pair. It is said by those
who have seen it that there is more
legitimate laughs contained in "A Girl
of Yesterday" than in a barrel of
monkeys. That is not all. You will
have the ever refreshing pleasure of
viewing the "little one" in one of her
cleverest dramatic comedies. Appear
ing on the same bill, will be Earl
Williams, Anita Stewart and Hughie
Mack, in a very funny bathing suit
comedy, entitled, "Count 'Em." Now,
for the love "of Mike, can you imagine
this, the classiest of comedy, with
this trio appearing in bathing suits,
and a comedy. x
