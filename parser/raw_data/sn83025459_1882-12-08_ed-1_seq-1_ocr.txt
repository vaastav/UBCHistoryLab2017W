Mcca is being said ia our Terri
torial cotemporarles refrdinj the
question of railroad rate) and fares
likely to come 'up in our next
legislature, and when we sum
it all up they seem to be agreed
that th ma'ter should he regu
lated, but they differ, perhaps, as to
the extent to which the regulating
process should be carried. The Ter
ritory needs more railroads, espec
ially the ceatral portion ; and when
wo have then the benefit they will
be to us in the reduction of our
present costly rates of transportation
admonishes us that we should deal
leniently with them on this occasion
that they nay be encouraged to go
on with the work of salvation. Sup
pose tatt laws were enacted whereby
sweeping reductions might be made;
it is apparent that enterprise of that
sort would be very slow to take hoid
of a matter that paid a very poor
profit compared with other branches
of business. Our legislature should
take into consideration the expenses
of maintaining such a business in
the Territory, and also the profits- de
rived from business in general and
allow to railroads a chance for a like
margia. If in the future it is found
that the profits of railroading in the
Territory aro disproportionate to
those of other branches of business
there will be ample opportunity to re
adjuat the matter in future legisla
tures. In the present state of a Hairs
tba Territory can better afford to pay
good fair rate than to be without
railroads. The railrotds we must
have, and the rates of fare and
freights, if not absolutely extortion
ate, caa well be bora by the people
when th increase of business and
value of property that will resuL are
taken into consideration. We do not
imagine tliat any of the raihoad reo
ple will demand anything more than
a fair business opportunity and that,
they, in common with all other busi
ness enterprises of the Territory,
should have. We are not amon.'

ritories and states, and this fact
seems to be ovei looked as well as
the fact that the demands for sur
vey are rapidly increasing. The es
imate on whieh the apportionment
smade of three dollars pjr mile is
too low to begin with, and the num-
er of miles of line required to be
surveyed ia the Territory the prcs-
nt year will no ioubl be largely iu
excess of what could be surveyed, -
oven at that low rate. It is impor-
tant to settlers that these surveys be
made, and they therefore are obliged
to furnish a portion of the fund to
ave the required work done at all.
It is to be hoped that our Delegate to
Congress, the Hon. G. H. Oury, will
turn his attention to this matter at
once, and at the earliest moment
practicable endeavor to obtain relief
for our settlers from this extra ex
pense into which they are forced
probably through ignorance of the
requirements of the Territory ia the
matter. Settlers, as a rule, are illy
b'e to meet this exra and unjust
demand upon their means, and they
should be relieved from it by more 1
liberal appropriations ia the future.
It is simply a demand of justice, and,
matter of necessity to the more
rapid settlement of the public land3
of the Territory.

We allude to the establishment of an
initial point of survey for town prop
erty. As the matter now stands,
here is no certainty in the matter of
town surveys; they can only be ap-
roximates, a id that kind of busi
ness means immense expense and
itigation in the future, should town
property become valuable, as It is
sure to do in quite a portion of the
town. The great advance in town
property within the last four years
admonishes us of what is to come as
the country opens up. In view of
this piospeet, and while it can yet
be done without much trouble, our
own surveys should be corrected
and kept correct by establishing a
point upon which all future surveys
may be based. Twenty-Bvo, dollars
judiciously expended now would

Communicated.
Considerable has been said and
written about this road within the
last few months, but no definite ac
tion, has been taken toward building
it. The route has been loca'ed, and
it is now settled just where it must
go, and if the citizens and property
owners of Phoenix want the full ben-1
efit of the trade that road will open
up, iney must nniia tne road ano not
wait too long about it.
There have
been sufficient developments in the
copper mines of Castle Creek to war- n the subject of political assess

will soon present a lively front. A
very large share of this prospective
trade is within the grasp of Phcenix,
and its influence on the price of
property in the town mav be secui
ed. But if the citizens and property
ho'ders of Phoenix think they can
secure this trade without an effort,
they are mistaken, and if they follow
in the line of their proclivities, they
will get left, and left in the cold too.
It is within the power of Prescott to
verv successfully contest the right of
Phoenix to the trade of this country,
and, although it will take about
40,000 to do it, when they come to
see the point, the got up and enter
prise of her citizens will soon de
vise a way to see the $40,000 and go
it better
A w.igon road over what I
is known as the Coulumbo trail to
the Falls of Castlo Creek ria Walnut
Grove, will bring Prescott within
fifty miles of any of the mines on
Castle Creek, while they are sitty
miles from riioeuix. A branch road
from this one to Bradshaw Basin
will brinjr them within about the
same distance to that region, and be
a good road all year. A road over

companies at work on Castle Creek
and the Humbug before the first of
next March, there is not much doubt,
and that these companies must have
an outlet to Maricopa there ia no
doubt, and that they will have it.
there is no doubt either; but if they
build it themselves they will build
it tor their own benefit and not fcr
the benefit of Phoenix; that point
needs no proof. There is nothing re
lating to the physical locatiou of
Phoenix that makes it a natural com
mercial center; but it has been es.
tablished by the people of the valley
j and business and capital have con-
ccntrated here, and by proper man
agement, with sufficient energy and
enterprise, Phoenix can be mnin-t-ained
as the commercial center of
Salt River Valley. But the princi
pal traveled road leading from north
to south over which will pass all the
treight tc the Ca3tle Creek and
northern country from Maricopa may
be a road that will be 15 miles near
er than through Phoenix, with a rival
town to intercept the ta ie of the
lower Gila; this is not a very flatter,
ing outlook for the property holders
of Fhoenix. if r.ny one will take
the trouble to examine a map ihat
will show the position of Fro
Tank on the Agua Fria. Phrenix and
Maricopa, it will be understood wnat
is alluded to above. A good, iu fact
a No. 1 road can be built from Phoe
nix past the Desert- Well to Frog
Tank on the Agua Fria, up the Agua
Fria to the mouth of Castle Creek,
up Castle Creek to the cemmence
ment of the grade at the head of the
Creek, about three miles above the
Falls, for about $3,500. This road
once built, it is safe to say no other
road to Maricopa will be thought of
by companies at the head of Castle
Creek or Humbug. I heard a prom
inent citizen of Prescott say once,
when speaking of another citizen
then a merchant of Pre-cott, In con-
tradistinction to Ihe Judge o? the
Third Judical District, that when
traveling to California on a buck-
board, he would have enough to eat
if he had to buy it. Now, we are in
about the same fix; we want a road
up Ca-tle Creek and will have it, if
we have to build it; but it will not
be profitable for the property holders
of Phoenix to trust the engineering
of that job to us.

pool Landing on the Colorado and
be carried due east to the New Mex

Territory into two equal sections
geographically, and give all that vast
northern region of Arizona a chance
to bo and do something for itself.
and then Prescott would be favorably
sit'ia'ed to double up on the capital
bnsine.-s, for no doubt each Territory
would (hoose her as a favorable
point for the propagation of their
laws. If we can do anything in this
part of the country to assist the
scheme the latch stri.ig of Phoenician
generosity is out.
A set of national leeches exist at
Washington which must be sloughed
off before ihe Republican party can
return to a condition of good health.
Hubbel and Riddleberger are types
of the element alluded to, They are
not Republicans, but the Republican
party is made responsible tor their
misbehavior by the people at large.
They are not Democrats and the
Democracy will gather the glory of
choking them off. They are the
dirty work department of Stalwart
ism, of which Conkling is king and
Arthur has been high priest. We
are of the opinion, however, that
President Arthur will redeem him
self from the political sins into whi';h
he has allowed himself to be lead.
He has dropped Conkling, apparent
ly, and well he might when the re
mains of that brilliant party an
archist aud tyrant lies buried be
neath 190,000 majority in his own
state. The will of the people is the
will of God, to which even Conkling
must succumb.
A synopsis of the Pre-ident's mes
sage comes to-day in our telegraphic
dispatches. The message is full o
good recommendations, and alto
gether is a very able and exhaustive
account of the standing and needs of
the nation. The rapid accumulation
of money in the treasury is pointed
out as rather detrimental than other
wise to the national financial health.
.More money is on nand than is
needed to pay off the national bonds
as they become due, and if the gov
ernment attempts to buy them in tht,
market an enormous premium must
be paid, which will increase as the
bonds grow scarce. This fact will,
no doubt, have a great influence in
Congress on the Internal Revenue
reduc'ion bill and the country can
look for a greaf decrease of Internal
tax and also on tariff, though on this
latter proposition there will be no
doubt a stubborn fight between pro
tectionists and anti-protectionists
wilhout regard to party at all.
The President advises an over
hauling of our navy and the con
structlou of first-rate armored ves
sels as cruisers. He also directs at
tention to a more import nt subject
in our merchant marine, which,
though talked about in Congress for
years, still struggles and decays for
want of legislative assistance. There
is no reason why the United States
should not have a merchant marine
second to none on the-high seas and
do her own carrying as well as that
of other nations, whereas she now
annually is put to great expenditure
more than sufficient to counteract the
balance of trade irj our favor, to
transport her goods to and from the
country.

The "Mormon settlement on the

of the most prosperous and enterpris
ing in the Territory. The people,
like all Mormons, are industrius,
frugal and adventurous, and they are
not afraid of the means by which the
wilderness is to be ma le to blossom
as tha rose. Such aecessions to
the wealth and development of the
Territory are sura of a hearty appre

Silver Belt: 'orne large sales of
copper property in this county ari
now pending, and from what wo
learn of Ihem, they are possessed of
unquestioned merit. The new an
various use3 to which copper is ap
piied, notwithstanding the product
of Arizona, Michigan and Chili, will
not cause a superabundance of th
article. The demand for coaling
telegraph wire, both in the United
States and Europe, will alone more
than consume any increase that may
be expected from the opening of new
mines. Copper is only indigenous
to certain localities and formations,
and, therefore, we base our opinion
that the supply will not be more
than commensurate with the demand,
