THE MUSAOE.
It Is clear to our mind that the country will
accept adherence to, or rejection of the views
of the President's Message, as the test of loy
alty. The war was made for the benefit of
slavery. The conspirators who forced It upon
the country based and continue to "base all
their pleas for the justification of their rebel
lion, on what they allege to be the necessities
for its protection (ere it was assailed) and the
advancement of its strength as a power in the
State. In its behalf they have brought about
The utter ruin of those confiding in them, and
.?ill the calamities growing out of the war ex
perienced by the loyal. It (slavery) ha? fur
nished them ui evrrv conceit able way with
nearly all their sinew? of war. The labor of
the slaves has not only supplied their armies
for the most part, with food, clothing, mu
nitions and men, (in their quartermaster's,
commissaries and engineering departments,)
but has enabled thein to ns? as conscripts
every able-bodied white man within the grasp
of their power.
So lorg as ine: 3 conspirators arid their chief
aiders nufl abettors cau con inue the contest in
any tranner whatever, they will do so. No
intelligent observer cont i ties to believe that
they will consent to any p *ace and settlement
-hcrt i (' absolute success cu their own term.-, of
thtir efforts todi-member he ouutry, fraught
as that would be, with horrors and di-asters to
all the people of the lo\ al S ites, quite eqnal to
these they have already brought ou the people
of the States in rebellion.
Now, it it be conceded that the rebellion
n.vit be put down-and what man making the
slightest pretence to loyalty holds any other
ground ??is it not plain that the speediest and
surest mode of so doine, ia t j deprive the rebel
lenders of th? assistance oi this mainstay of
their work !
The emancipation policy has already trans
foimed fifty thousand former colored workers
:n aid ot the rebellion, into loyal soldiers in the
field, and as many more into Union quarter
masters', commissaries' and engineers' men;
and it is as plain as can be. that in another
twelve mouths or so it will transfer nearly all
the able-bodied male negroes from the side if
the rebelliou to that of the Union; and thus
will make the la-k of finishing up the work of
t'ie rebellion's suppression a comparatively
easy one for the balance ot the war. To aban
don the emancipation policy now, would there
fore be to i brow away a ureal lever of power tj
compel the rebellious State* to reacknowledge
the snpr? ma- y of th-Government. Besides, it
has not been attended with a single one of th:
social and domestic horrors and incendiary
tragedies whi h hundreds of thousands of true
and loyal men feared from it. ere the expert
ment was fairly tried. There'.ore, while as a
measure of n ilitary policy i', ha* been em.
neatly successful, as a me uure of political
and social policy or economy it has, per *r,
inflicted no injury whatever upon the Stat"; no
personal outrages having been perpetrated
under its auspice?, and ro loyal man having
lost a dollar by the loss of slaves which h?
would not surely nave lost by the natural con
tingencies of thi- war made in behalf of the
slave power, if it (the w;ir) is to be prosecuted
nutil the rebellion thai! be subdued, the war
having reduced iti<- market value of slave prop
erty iu the 1-order States absolutely to nothing,
before the emancipat or policy was necessarily
n si rted to.
The only pos.-iole hope lor a restoration of
that value rested on the success of the rebel
lion: whicb, in tnrn, involved the utter destruc
tion of the fortunes and liberties of all m the
border States who have ?nt d with the causa
of the Union.
Entertaining th> 6e view-, as w* sincerely do,
we cannot hestate ;o test every man's loyalty
by his adhercuce to or rejection of the common
sense, practical and patriotic position- upou
this question taken in President Lincoln's mes
sage and the accompanying proclamation,
which latter accords to all in the South who
would reposs.es the privileges and blessing- of
United StAtes citizen-hip, and who may by any
possible chance deserve thetn,au extent ofgrac?
and mercy befitting the character of our Gov
ernment and the identity mt its interest with the
peace, prosperity and happiness ol our whole
people.
Nor should we omit to call attention to th*
emphasis with which, in the Message, Presi
dent Lincoln gives to those who have doublet
m acy degree the strength of his devotion to
the original principles of our Government, a
marantic of the adherence of his administra
tion to the right of the States yet held in sub
jection by tlir rebel at.thornier, to resume their
places in the Union at. will, with all their
S'ates rights unimpaired, which the exigencies
of this war for the advancement of the slave
power tarty not have destroyed.
KEPURT UK THE SECRETARY OF i
THE NAVY.
The report of the Hon. Gideou Welles, Secre- j
tary of the Navy, accompanying the President's !
message, affords an interesting exhibit of tha ,
important part taken by the Navy l>epartiuent 4
during the year in the successful pros>vntiou j
ot the war.
It commences with a general aad careful j
review of the naval operation- of the year, 1
whl h vary iu uo single important particular
t;om th? reet rd already made by official reports,
more or less presented iu detail heretofore by 1
co r res pot den !s oi tU?* press.
In regard to th> blockade, the report state * j
that it cov?rs an extent of coa*t of 3^519 inil<?s, ,
*n<l is becoming moreeilective and complete.
Allusion is ik.ade to the coutest between the
Weehawken and Atlanta, m illustrating ttte -
power and efficiency <A the fifteen-inch or'l- (
nance, by which tU>- Atlauta was captured in '?
ft 1 teen minute*. with only live shots.
Tin* improvement.-, iu ves-els of naval war
f re are referred almost entirely to the monitor
c ass of armored ship-, but a superior style of
vessel for offensive operations is demanded by
the exigencit* of the occasion, und a commea
surate public < -fciblishment lor construction
and pr- para'ion of such vessels Is spoken of a*
ii'd #p< n-ab!e lit commendation* to that effect
are urged in the report.
The necessity for the education of engineers
ui.dfritovemiQentsupervisioi' is contended for,
and the subject examined at some length, wich i
sufgesttons pertaining thereto.
The career of the Alabama, Florida and
Georgia, wi h their origiii, and their character
a* "piratical rovers," are reviewed, with stric
ture* upon the ctur. e a lopb'd by the principal t
government of Europe, by which iliey are |
tel. r. ted as the ships of war of a belligerent.
With regard to the operations of the draft, j
the report urges that where it shall be enforced
on sry community which has furnished a large
numler of sailors, proper deductions ought
doubtless be made from the quota required for
the army. legislation is asked with respect to
the present and prospective difficulty of pro
curing seamen, and liberal bounties art ?or

Virginia Legislature.
The Old Virginia legislature completed its
organization jwterdat at Alexandria. Gov
ernor Pterpoint's Homage was delivered to
both UooHs,
It contains an arganmt against secession,
nnd another in favor of the emancipation of all
the alares in the State, with a recommendation
that the Legislature shall call a convention of
the people to secure the alteration of the Con
stitution to that end. In answer to the asser*
lion that a majority of the people of th? State
were rebels, he urges?"Felons and paupers
have no right to vote, nor have Rebels. They
cannot deprive the loyal of their rights, if the
loyal can assert their rights!" And he con
tends that no counties of the State should h*re
after be allowed a representation in the State
Government until they are organized by the
electian of officers, by whom taxes can be col
lected. r.
In his argument upon the slavery question,
he fays:
"The President's proclamation frees all in
the State except in a few counties. Without
this amendment to the Constitution I foresee
endless strife and turmoil. All the State offi
cers are sworn to support the Constituti jn ot
the United States and the laws of Virginia.
The laws of the State, as they now stand, rec
ognize slavery. The officers will be called
upon for warrants to apprehend slaves and
commit them to jail. The army of the United
States will interpose, and thus a conflict will
ensne, and Rebels glory in the strife. We must
either decide to come into antagoolsm with the
Unitpd States, or alter our organic law on the
subject." ,
The Governor also says:
'?1 have reliable information from a large
portion of the State that as soon as the domes
tic violence is suppressed there will be more
than enough ot capable men, who havp never
bowed to Secession, to welcome and carry on
the Government of the State, and that of eyery
county.

we are informed, inaccurate. Wef?"
on good, if not exactly official authority, that
General Thomas did make suchan ac^?^1
edgement, and stated that he did.it witu a
great deal of pleasure.? C'rwcinwaf* C ommrrciai.
We regret to find a journal so generally cor
rect and so entirely conscientious ia Its state
ments as the Commercial, repeating the tRisera
ble invention of its neighbor, the Cincinnati
Gazette. The story that General Thomas tele
graphed to the President that the recent
splendid success at Chattanooga, or any part
of it, bad resulted from following Gen. Rose
crans' plan, is the other half of the scheme
which we exposed a short time since, which
consisted in getting a bogus Washington let
ter into the New York Tribune, purporting to
have been inspired by the War Department,
but really concocted at Cincinnati, and In
spired by Gen. Rosecrans. The paper selected
to be victimized on thi% occasion was the New
York Times. It was deemed best to vary the
channel of communication, the more effectual
ly to mislead the public.
i In denying again, as we do most emphati
cally, the statement that Gen. Thomas has sent
to the President any euch dispatch as that
mentiorad above, we call attention for a mo- j
mf nt to the childishness of the frand sought to
be perpetrated.
If Gen. Thomas has seni any such dispatch
the fact will, of coarse, be elaborately set torth
in his official report of the battle. If it shall
be discovered that he makes no mention of any
such fftct, directly or Indirectly, the inference
will be irresistible that he never tent any such
dispatch to the President, and when his report
coiues to be published the authors of the false
hood will, if they have any sense of shame,
be covered with mortification. But they hope
that before the official documents are published
the public will have forgotten their petty mis
demeanor, and that mean^ bile Gen. Rosecrans
may profit ooniewhat by stealing the measure
of credit belonging to Gen. Graut and the offi
cers and soldiers under his command. We
assure the culprits that 1 hey shall not eet off
in 'his way. We shall remind.them and the
public of it in due time.
SUPPOSED R?BKI, 8PIK3.
111 lor mat ion having reached Cupt. Dulin.
t.f the Detective Corps, last evening, that three
mi prosed rebel spies were on the road to Bal
timore, he immediately dispatched a couple of
detectives in company with Policemau Cline,
who succeeded in arresting two of the parties,
named Robt. and David Boyle, at a hotel at
Bladens^urg. They weie brought to the city,
reaching here about 2 o'clock this morning,and,
by order of Capt. Todd, were committed to the
Old Capitol.
Robert Boyle represents himself as a British
subject, and that he arrived in this country
from England in June of this year. Ou his
person wa.- found a pocket-book containing
a foOO Confederate bond and 8190 in Confeder
ate currency?also gold and U. S. Treasury
notes. He had also a certificate from the Bri
tish Consul at Baltimore.
David Boyle gave no account of himself fur
ther than the statement that he was no relation

OUR PRISONERS AT RICHMOND.
The following haa been received by Gen?ral
Hitchcock:
FORTRUes Monro*, Dec. 'J.? Major General
j;, a. Hitchcock: My belief Is that our prisoners
ou Belle Isle are in tents. I have requested Mr.
Ould to share the clothing and subsistence
sent by the Government with our citizen pris
oners. I have no doubt it haa been done.
S. A. Mkrkpith, Brig. Gen.
AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
Th>* question has already arisen whether
the rebel prisoners in our hands under the
rank of Colonel, may not avail themselves of
the amnesty ottered by President Lincoln in
his preclamation. It is believed that three
fourths of the rebel prisoners now held by us
will ?ladly accept the terms of the amnesty ir
it Includes them, and thequestlon thusbo?omos
one of much Importance.

LOCAL NEWS.
Melanchoml Suiciue.?Night before last a
dittreei-liig occurrence took place at tbe resi
dence of Mr. Thomas Scrivener, sr., corner of
Itelaware avenue and B street north, Capitol
Hill. It appears that Mr. Thus. Scrivener, jr.,
leli the house that evening in company with
Rev. Mr. McCauley and his two youngest sis
ters, and attended the Wesley Chapel fat?,
?w here he appeared in more than bis usual i
spirits; and oil returning homo kissed his sis
^rs and retired to his room. In a few mo
ments a discharge of n gun was heard, and on
rushing to his room hi3 sister found him lying
upon the trout of his bed, holding the muzzle
ot his double-bnrreled fowling piece to his J
breast, where the entire charge, composed of 1
seventeen buckshot, encased in a copper wire
covering, had entered, passing through the left
lung, and making a large opening, from which
the blood gushed in torrents.
I?rs. Snow, ot the 153d N. Y , and May and
McCoy were summoned, but be was beyond
the power of human aid, and after lingering
nineteen hours he died. He was sensible to the
last, and stated that the act was inteutioual
and deliberate, and his regret was that it had
not been more decisive, and thai he was ready
and willing to die.
The cause of this sad event waa doubtless, aa
statt d by himself. a sealed desire to leave thte
world ot trouble and disappointment. He was
a young man of unusual talent and ability,
had a thoroughly cultivated intellect, was a
graduate of Harvard Law School, (which in
stitution bad conlerred upon him the decrreeof
Bachelor of Arts,) and a member ot the Wash
ington bar. In his lite and habits he was
exemplary, and in all his dealings upright
and conscientious. Although rem irkably in
dependent in his opinions and judgment, bo
?was nevertheless peculiarly sensitive, and it
was the undue excitement of this quality of
mind, producing a mental aberration, that
led to th<? fatal act. Altogether, it is a most
melancholy affair, and hru? left his aged
parents crusbea to the earth in sorrow.
AfPAt'LT and Resisting Officers?On
Saturday last, officers Benson and Turner
we.it to the residence of Mrs. Mary Marshall,
at tbe corner of Maryland avenue and 6th
striet, to serve a warrant on her for selling
liquor by the small, when she refused to ac
knowledge tbe service and resisted the arrest,
seizing her vtelgbts and throwing them at the
officers, (Oflioer Benson being struck over the
eye.) and fought them desperately for a tim*,
getting hold of her pistol, with which she at
tempted to scare them off; but they managed
to set their nippers npon her, when she agreed
to nign her appearance. The officers subse
quently procured a warrant for assault against
b, r, and she was arrested by Officer Sheltou,
and tiie case was beard last evening by Justice
Cull, who held her to security for appearance
at court.
Interest in Patents Condemned.?Judge
Wylie has issued a decree ot condemnation
under the provisions of the confiscation law,
against th?> interest of J. N. Gramewell and
James Dunlop, of South Carolina, in a num
ber of patents, embracing the patents granted

graps; to Mqses G. Farmer, for electro mag

graph-*: to M. G. Farmer, for electro magnetic
Ore alarm apparatus, and other patents ot
similar character. Messrs. Game well and
Dnnlop are understood to be rebels.
Sale op Confiscated Property.?Yester
day, Messrs. Wall A Co., sold the personal ef
tects of J- A. Campbell, of Alabama, late Judge
of the I'. S. Supreme Court, which had been
seized and condemned under the provisions of
tbe Confiscation act, at his late residence on I
street, near Fourteenth. There waa a large
number of persons present, and everything
sold well, the sales amounting to over ?3,300.
The Strike or tbe Female Employee? at
the Government Pkiutino Opkice.?The

Government Office, have renewed work on the
old tcaie of prices they struck against, viz: 87

That is to say that those of them have been
taken back by Superintendent Deirees whose
places had not been, supplied in the meantime.
