At the lire bird shoot will be .used
the live bird traps invented by the
cl:ib's secretary and treasurer, J. A.
Williams. They are a superior to any
trap ever put on the market, since
they have open or glass tops watch
keeps the Inclosed bird from becom
ing dazed, as often is the case with
dark traps. With the Williams trap,
the bird is fresh and keen and will
fly as soon as the top is sprung. An
other point in the Williams trap Is
that It Is floored with a false canvas
bottom which can be jerked up,
throwing the bird two feet into the
air and making It fly. The delay
caused by birds failing to rise from
the trap has always been the worst
feature of live bird shoots, but the
Williams trap eliminates all this dif
ficulty. o

THE VALUE OF SMUDGE
POTS TO THE FRUIT GROWER
' The following Is the address made
at the farmers' meeting at the Com
mercial Club by H. J. iHagerman. It
is well worthy of though from eTery
farmer and fruit grower:
Last season we used 2.600 T rou tni an
1 gallon pots, with which we smudged
:10 acres of orchard, an average of 86
pots to tae acre. In some parts of
the orchard smudged more pots were
used than in others the number var
ied from 60 to 85 per acre. The va
rieties smudged were Ben Davis, Bell-flower.
York Imperial, Jonathan,
Shackelford and a few Black "Twig.
The equipment for the use of these
I)t3 was one 10,000 gallon galvaniz
ed iron tank, mounted 8 feet above
'he ground, and two 3K) gallon tanks,
mounted on wagon trucks. The pots
were burned t'.irt-e times consuming
in the three burnings about S.OuO gal
lons of oil. We purchased the oil ia
Kansas at a cost laid down here of
uboitt 4 cents per gallon.
The cost of ins allaiion was:
For the pots 4416.00
For the storage tank $275.00
For two wagon tanks $300.00
$'J86.00
This installation, is of course per
manent and will last for many years.
Tae cost of opera' ion was, say;
For S.ooo gals, oil fij 4c . . . . $320.00
2 operations 10 men for 6 days
Jt $1.5o per day, plus trans
portation of oil say. about, .. 150.00
$470.00
Some of the pots were In orchard
tracts subsequently sold by us, but
from the best information we can
get I thiok it safe to say that this
investment of $1,456 ($:S6 of which
was for permanent equipment) saved
fruit which was solj for $23,000.
The question of labor Is, of course,
a most serious one. The first labor
comes in distributing the pots; then
t;e labor of filling tae pots with oil;
then the labor of lighting them. In
passing I will s:ty that we have our
selves up to date had experience only
with the small pots, of about one gal
lon capacity, which will burn from
four to six hours with one filling.
Wi h pots of from four to six gallons
capacity the cost of labor for the sea
son, (presuming that ihe pots are
burned three or four times) would be
considerably deminished. though the
cost of installa; Ion would be increas
ed. To fill 2.fion 1 gallon pots took all
day lining two 3(o gallon wagons
with three men. It took the time of
two more men for a day to put in the
wicks, and of two more to put the
tops on the pots and cover them with
earth to keep the tops from blowing
or falling o".
As for lighting It. took ten men
about 1 hour to light the 2.600 pots.
From 260 to 3o pots per hour per
man Is a fair rate for lighting.
In order to show you graphically
what smudging may mean to the Val
ley I will give you figures on a piece
r.f orchard on which we used Trout
man poU. This was 8 acres of a 10
aore tract sold some months previous
ly to New York parties. The 8 acres
which were smudged. 'contained 58
trees to ihe acre or 464 trees. The
varieties were Babbitt. Jonathan,
-hakolford and dome Black Twig. In
all !73 boxes of No 1 and No. 2 apples
were shipped, bringing delivered from
$1.60 to $2.00 per box In Texas points,
and in addition 318 bushels of culls
wee sold In bulk at 50c per bushel.
After deducting all expenses of the
freight. Icing, picking, packing, haul
ing and handling and commission, the
owner was paid $86S.05 or $108.50 per
cre, being 19 per cent on ttw cost of
her whole 10 acres. -
On the basis of these previous ob-
servations I will attempt to show you
what speakhiK conirvariveIy
smudging might mean to this district
at the present time. I take as a ba
sis of estimate that there are 1,500
acres of bearing appe orchard In the
Hoswell-Hagerman district at the
present time. "

As to the danger period of frosts
I would say In a general way that
there Is not any great danger of the
destruction of the fruit until after the
buds begin to open up. The lime of
the opening of the buds varies with
he varieties of the apples and also
varies in different years. According
o our observations the buds here or
dinarily begin to open about the 1st
of April and are In full bloom by the
iota or April, but for the past two
ear (that is, in the seasons of 1908
and 1909) the buds began opening on
about March 20th and were in full
bloom by the 1st of April. Nothing
but a severe freeze will hurt tae fruit
before the opening of the buds, but
any degree of cold below 32 degrees
Fahrenheit Is dangerous after the op
ening of the buds and until the ap
ples are from one-third to one-half
iich in diameter.
Our low record here of about 24
degrees below zero was at 6.30 a. xn.
February 13th, 1905. . This was, of
ourse, long before the buds had swol
len but the frost undoubtedly injured
he crop, although the crop that year
was a fairly good one.
Practically, tnerefore, we should
be prepared to sirudge between, say-
he loth of March and the 1st of May.
From 1903 to 1909 inclusive we
have had only one total failure and
hat was in 1907 and was due to a
cold spell commencing at 5 a. en. on
April 21st. From about 5 a. en. to
noon Thursday and from midnight to
6 a. xn. on April 22nd, the thermome
ter ranged from 30 to 32 degrees, and
on April 29th for a short time at mid
night it went down to 23 degrees. Ac-
lve use of smudge pots on these days
especially If large pots had been us
ed could have saved the crop..
The other yaar of a poor crop was
1903, and I have no temperature rec
ords for that year.
Tain year the conditions as to tem
perature were such as to render
smudging necessary to save the crop,
but the conditions were very much
less severe than In Colorado, where
much of the crop was paved by smudg
ing, and In other apple growing dis-
rlcts, .where smudging was not re
sorted to and where the crops were a
failure.
On March 17th, the thermometer
registered 31 degrees at 6 a. m.:' on
March 21st, 32 degrees between 5:30
and 6:30 a. m.; on the 22nd, 31 de
grees at 6 a. m.; on 31st 30 minimum
at 7 a. m. On April 1st, the mercury
went dnwn to 29 degrees at alout 3
a. tni. and to 28 degrees at about 6 a.
and on April 8th, 9th. ami 10th.
fell a t"K degrees below freezing be-
wen tne hours of 3 and 6 a, m., the
minimum being about 26 degrees at
about 6 a. m. on April 9th.
You will see that with such con
ditions there was considerable diffi
culty in knowing when to light the
pots, especially when the whole pro
cess was new and much of an experi
ment with us. but In spite of the in
experience Mr. t'reen succeeded in
getting the results I mentioned al6ve.
There was shipped from our orchard
23 carloads of rpples and sold local-
y enough to make about 10 cars
more. Probably four-fifths of this
crop was due entirely to smudging.
rhere were very few other apples
grown in the Valley this year. With
full equipment of pots in the Valley
he crop secured would have brought
gross fromi $250,000 to $300,000, as the
market was wry good.

at 1 gal per night,
540.000 gals. & 4 c Sl.600.00

Let us say that the cost of
Installation ($44,500.) to
good for 10 years, the In
stallation charge per year
would be, 4,450.00
or $2.95 per acre.
The cost of operation with

Or with oil at 2 c it would

GOOD WILL OF THE U. S.
Managua, Nlc, Dec. 17. President
Zelaya last night sent a messaga of
bis resignation to congress.
President Zelaya last night cabled
a conciliatory message to President
Tftft saying he had shown his good
faith by resigning so 'Nicaragua

proposed to leave the country, but
stood ready to account for his acts
as president.
Zelaya'a message to President Taft
was as follows:
"On December fourteenth I cabled
to Washington this message to Sec
retary Knox:. 'I believe the sources
of your information are prejudiced and
request the I nited States to send a
commission to investigate. If its find-
ng. show my administration to be
detrin-ental to Central America I will
resign.' I have received no reply. To
avoid harm to my country and desir
ing that it shall renew friendly rela-
tons with the United States I have
oday sent my resignation to congress
and as my opponents consider env
presence a disturbing factor, I propos6
o snow my good faith by leaving Nic
