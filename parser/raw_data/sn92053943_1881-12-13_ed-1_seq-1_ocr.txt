Proceedings of Congress This
Afternoon? J '
Accidents, "Crimes and Other
Interesting Items.
' ""THE TRIAL. "
Washington, Dec. 13. Dr. Shilzka re
sumed his testimony in the Guiteau "case
to-day. Corkhill handed to witness a slip
of paper, on "Whieh was drawn a ' diagram
of the human head, and said: '.'Now, doc
tor, supposing this jto be" the ; prisoner's
head, will you please point out the inequal
ities to which .you referred . yesterday?"
Before any Teply could be made Guiteau
raised a laugh by saying: "That, accounts
for it, a hatter came to see mel this morn
ing and offered me half if I would let : him
take my head. I got that, but you can't
pay for it."
Scoville -"Oh. no, the government will
have to do so." "
Witness went On giving bis reasons for
thinking prisoner insane, TTpon the ques
tion being asked Corkhill, Guiteu broke in
with "I have been looking up your rcord
CorkhiQ, and I will show you upX
Subsequently Guiteau again interrupted
the examination and shouted, "I see that
crank Takoage has been, doing some sensa
tionalism business in this case. - - He had
better go slow. He has been before his
synod several times . for lying."
lie has a reputation In New York for
running for a house ..of prostitution. I
have got my eye on several of these cranks
and if they don't go slw " 151 ; give - some
more of them some free advertising. The
high toned portion of the American people
are beginning to take the right view of
this case." . '
Scoville endeavored to introduce as evi
dence what he (Scoville) had said in rela
tion to Shaw, witness for the prosecution,
by asking the witness to state to the jury
what he (Scoville) had told him, what he
had learned in relation to Shaw.
Objection was made and sustained when
Guiteau shouted out "We have found put
that Shaw was guilty of perjury in New
Jersey and was told by a Judge f rom, the
bench that he ought to be convicted and
sent to prison. We also know that En
glish was convicted of a low crime in Ire
land," The jury ought to know what kind
of witnesses you are bringing here to ruin
my reputation. - -
D. Fordyaebacker of N. Y.. . a distin
guished Phyeician testified definiag insani
ty in several phases." Ilis comprehensive,
positive conclusions all accorded with the
theory of the prosecution, ' Judge Cox asked
what witness meant by irritable impulse,
and the answer was ' Perversions of, emo
tions which produce conduct entirely at
variance with the individuals former, life,
and to such a degree as to completely con
trol the will power would constitue 'is
resisitblc impulses."
Guiteau asked, "Where a man is im
peHed to commit crime by an impulse he
cannot resist, i3 he sane or insane T
Answer. "When that fact can be proved
sir, it is insanity." ' - '
Guiteau. "That's just my case, sir."
(With an air of perfect satisfaction). (To
Scoville) "Come, that is the whole case.
Let's have recess. I'm getting hungry.
Mrs. Scoville asked. "Can a man be
born insane?"
Guiteau. "Oh you keep "still. It's all
they can do to put up with me."
The"answer was, "No Madam, he could
not."

YESTERDAY. "
Washington, Dec . 12,- As soon as the
court was called to " order, Guiteau, with
flashing eyes and nervous utterance shout
ed, "There are a good many poodle dogs
ia the Press and I want to express my con
tempt for them. ,The high toned Press of
tne country are beginning to express their
opinion It would be a crime to hang a
man who was in my -condition on the 2d
of July, when I was impelled upon the
President."'-' yrt r r
Some one in the room cried "Shoot him
now.!" Cries of "order" from ' the baliffs
quieted the disturbance, and Dr. Spitzka
again took the stand. Witness con
cluded from the shape of the face
and head ' and ; the defective innovation
of the facial muscles and from the pro
nounccd deviation f the tongne to the
left that the prisoner was born with an un
equal development of brains; that his in
sanity was congenital.- Witness described
with great particularity the peculiarities of
the head formation which he had detected
in the prisoner's case; thought there was
inequality in two sides of the head. This
case was three times greater lhan in a nor
mal head. The inequality could be taken
as an indication of moral imbecility, only
i proportion to its degree. Witness con
tinued: "If I had only that man's (point
ing to Guiteau) mean face to judge by, I
would call hjm a depraved man-or an in
sane man, but introducing other factors
the unequal formation of the head, the ine
quality of the facial expression, and the devi
ation of the tongue, I am of the opinion that
the trouble is of congenial origin. The
closest attention was paid by Guiteau to
the evidence of this witness, and his coun
tenance plainly indicated his satisfaction.
Witness, becoming weary, was allowed to
sit down, but Corkhill insisted upon his
standing, as he could not see or hear him.
Witness stood up, saying it was a trivial
matter whether Corkhill could see " him.
Guiteau was immediately aroused by this
retort, and with a chuckle said, "He's a
bad man for you, Corkhill, We've got
some more of them." -
Witness, upon talking about the pris
oner, found that he had based his conclu
sions upon insane and improbable assump
tions, but granting his assumptions to be
true his conclusions were logical.
The cross examination - was conducted
with the evident purpose of discrediting
the direct testimony, but Spitzga was more
than a match for the questioners.
Corkhill sharply questioned -witness re
garding the article he contributed to the
Medical Journal. A spicy colloquy fol
lowed, -which Guiteau interrupted by
shouting, "It seems to cause you consider
able trouble. You had better cool off
Corkhill. I haven't seen you heated so
before. It is 3 o'clock. You had better
go home."
Witness was asked if he had not ap
peared as an expert in a certain case, and
after taking a fee on one side returned it
and taken a larger one from the other
side. Witness warmly replied; '"You
have no basis for such a question, and no
man dares make the assertion upon which
he could found it."
Guiteau, again interrupting yelled
'That's a very dirty question for you to:
ask, CorWull- It just suits your brain,
I'm'foing to ask Arthur to kick you out
of this case. - -This man is one of the first
scientists of the country. : Why, he would
not condescend to spit on you CorkhilL
You are in bad re.'Uite with every member
of this bar, You ar,? an unmitigated nui
sance in this case." ' '
Witness, finally making " himself heard,
answered: 'Most decidedly, no."
Adjourned without concluding the ex
amination. . FORTY-SEVEXTH COXUEESS. "

BURIAL OF THE VICT1SS.
Vienna, Dec. 12. After the requiem the
funeral services commenced-at the ceme
tery. The infantry, cavalry and police
maintained order. On either side of the j
imposing catafalque, upon which several :
hundred lighted eandlea stood, were seventy
metal coffins. Those containing unidenti
fied remains were numbered- The others
bearing the names of persons whose bodies
were enclosed. All around were abund-!
ant plants and wreathes. Many mourners
were present , The procession included
the entire Common Council, many members
of the Reichsrath, representatives of the
various theatres and numbers of the aris
tocracy. After the services the Burgo
master made an address, speaking of the
grief in Vienna, Austria, and of the wprld.
The entire number of coffins were then
lowered into one common grave. Prob
ably the real number of victims will never
bo lchown. Names have been falsely
entered in tLe list by persons wishing to
obtain cards of admission to view the bod
ies at the hospitals and in some instances a
positive trade has been done in such cards.
The work of lowering the coffins into the
grave lasted from noon until night fall.
The number of persons missing is reported
to be 805. " -
An immense concourse this "morning
were present at St. Stephen's cathedral,
where a solemn requiem mass was celebrat
ed for the repose of the .souls f the- vic
tims pf the &se. The cathedral "was entirely
draped in black and a catafalque erected,
which, was surrounded with exotic "plants
and candles. - The clergy -came first in the
procession, followed by the Crown Prince,
Archdukes, members of the Imperial house
hold, Court dignitajjjJS, ministers, members
of the Reichstag, representatives pf the
army and civil service, municipalities,- .
Bishop Augerer officiated.. The court
opera choir assisted and their voices were
occasionally almost drowned by the ag
onized sobs of the mourners.. The large
scuare before the cathedral and the ad-
Joining atreets were filled by many, thous
ands or people.
