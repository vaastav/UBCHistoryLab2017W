is the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
joint session of the senate and
house at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress—Since 1
last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
which had then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
until it has swept within its flame
some portion of every quarter of the
globe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
international affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
The president tells how this country
practiced neutrality and declares that
he hopes that when the time comes
for readjustment and recuperation this
country will be of infinite service. Re
ferring to Central and South American
problems, the president declares that
we should retain unabated the spirit
which has Inspired us throughout the
whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe.
We have been put to the test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test. Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
iter own hands. But we have at least
proved that we will _not take_ advan-

LITTLE PALLS HERALD, DECEMBER 10, 1915-
Declares That if Full Navy Pro
gram Is Carried. Out We Will
Have a Fleet For Defense That
Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs
and Worthy of Our Traditions."
Greatest Danger to Country
Comes From Within Our Bor
ders.
trine is, "That government is or ought
to be instituted for the common bene
fit, protection and security of the peo
ple, nation or community that "of
all the various modes and forms of
government, that is the best which is
capable of producing the greatest de
gree of happiness and safety and is
most effectually secured against the
danger of maladministration. ui~d that
when any government shall be found
inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community
hath an indubitable, inalienable and
indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish it in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unhesitatingly ap
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
itself and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter in the radical but nec
essary process. We will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her. and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Eeonomie Adjustments Inevitable With*
in the Next Generation.
The moral is that the states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-op
erating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of interest,
alike in matters political and in mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in interna
tional affairs and in the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
in a very deep and true sense a unit
in world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
and common ideals. Separated, they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries united in spirit and pur
pose, they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire in it It is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and independence
and liberty and mutual service.
The president calls attention to the
meeting in Washington recently of
representatives of the pan-American
republics and says that economic ad
justment is, inevitable in the ne^t gen
eration.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fail to per
ceive that their passion is for peace,
their genius best displayed ih the prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent They do not
'ppk or desire war. Their thonght's
of individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
censored thought that quickens it.
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or agreeable to pur princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
tnrbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter tt may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We Insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development
We do more than that We demand it
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to the Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there Is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of independence
and right From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed It as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be have set America aside as a whole
for the new of Independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of assertlng the rlghts of a peo
ple against aggression* And we are
as fiercely Jealous of .coercive or dicta
torial power within oar own nation
as of aggression from without We
will not maintain a. standing army ex
