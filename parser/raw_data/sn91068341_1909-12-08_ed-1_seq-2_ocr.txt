MCARAGUAN AFFAIR.
The Nicaraguan Congress 1s to me
at Managua, the capital of the repub

er Zelaya is to continue to rle the
country, or whether General Irias ia
the coming man. Reports are coaV
ilicting and are really worthless. Es
trada's efforts are directed against Ze
laya, but whom the revolutionary
leader favors for president I not
known. He may favor himself.
From all the- evidence that has
come to hand it appears that Leonard
Grace was a colonel of engineers and
I.tsroy -Cannon a lieutenant-colonel ift
that branch of the revolutionary er
vice, and that they were captured I
outposts after a battle and held a
prisoners of war. It is claimed that
under the laws of Nicaragua Presi
dent Zelaya had no right to execute
these two Americans,
The questions
raised by Secretary of State Knox in-
volve difficult constructions of Inter
national law,and Mr. Knox very prop,
erly desires to keep within that law
and to be consistent himself through
out. -' " '' -
Possibly Zelaya will be driven out
of Nicaragua In the near future, and
then all the problems that have arisen,
the "execution" of Grace and Cannon
will speedily be adjusted. The Presi
dent and Secretary of State are acting
firmly but cautiously, and they do not
propose to make a record In Nicara-
gua that would be discreditable to this
country in any respect.
Any day's news may change the sit
uation, and the reader who has be
come interested in the subject ehouXd
study the news eelWEsea. .
CA1TN0 JT JLJTD THE WOKK OF
CONGRESS.
On Monday next Congress will meet
and the wise ones are striving to as
certain what Mr. Cannon's program is,
what the insurgents will strive to do
to the rules of the House, and what
role of President Taft will be in
message and throughout the eom-
session.
Disguise the battle as we may, it Is
the old one between the many and the
few between the consumers and the
monoplies and trusts. "Wall street is
apprehensive. It seems to think that!
a radical message is to be piled on top
of the decision in the Standard Oil
case, and the prices of securities are
not as firm as they were before the
President started on his long tour to
the Pacific coast.
The general belief now is that the
President will await the decision of
the Supreme Court in the Standard Oil
case before making any material sug
gestions of changes in the "Sherman
anti-trust act. It is believed that the
decision of the Circuit Court has tied
up such suggestions.
The question of party unity Is no
doubt duiv considered at the White
House. The insurgents have declared I
war against Cannon and the Houss
rules, and at Kansas City the Speaker
accepted the challenge in these words-
"Ever since history began the man
in the minority has been seeking some
device by which he could overcome
the will of the majority, and we. have
a popular, if not absolutely reliable
record of one celebrated character, an-
tedating history whose fiat was, "Bet
ter to reign in hell than to serve ii
heaven." There was our first greai
Insurgent, and he was pitched ovei
the battlements of heaven. Since the
creation of man there have been those
at work on earth to encourage insur
rection against order, which is- hea
ven's law."
This brings up an interesting ques
tion as to Mr. Taft. The Speaker pro
poses to tame the lions in his charge.
He is ready for the contest. So are
the insurgents. Some think the Presi
dent will endeavor to utilize the strife
by asking both the reactionaries and
the insurgents in the party to support
his administration measures. Neither
side may care to oppose the adminis
tration under ,he circumstances, and
Air. Taft may prove a winner from the
strife that has sprung up in the party.

The North Carolina library Asso
ciation convened in this city yesterday
afternoon, under the auspices of the
Goldsboro Public Library, and in the
Woman's Club rooms, by courtesy of
tnat public-spirited organization that
has done so much for Goldsboro's up
lift, and wearies not in well-doing.
The afternooji session was devoted
to formal routine business, such as
reading of minutes of last annual
meeting, reports of officers and com
mittees, and the appointment j com
mittees. -
At 8:30 o'clock last night a most
interesting, entertaining and instruc
tive program was inaugurated, and
every moment of the entire evening
was one of unalloyed enjoyment alike
for the delegates and the large and
elite audience.
The evening's program opened with
a delightful solo by Mrs. Wms. Spicer.
Then Col. Jos. E. Robinson, for the
local Library Association, welcomed
the delegates of the State Association,
and the response on the part o? the
State Association was made in well
chosen words and cordial manner" by
Mr. J. P. Breedlove, librarian of Trin

close held his audience spell-bouna,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

therefore, is not due to my knowlecio
of any of the technicalities of youi

fact that 1 am an appreciative ou.

yet, I believe, rather too high. Y
would not underestimate its signiL

have added strength unto strength am

meek and unaffected grace of the ru
ral pastor, but the loaded shelves, the
catalog and reference lists, the chairs
and tables, and the zeal unaffected,
though not always meek, of the mod
ern librarian.
The modern library and the modern
librarian are new things under the
san. . Our old library was a ware
house wherein were entombed many
and mighty volumes of books. This
storehouse was for the benefit of th-
ie'sr. These few were supposed to be
only the intellectual people of the
community. It was a secluded place,
It was incidental. It was a luxury.
The modern library is a laboratory
a workshop. It is for the multitude,
It affects the social side of our life as
well as the intellectual. It is set on a
hill. It is a necessity. It is an or
ganic institution.
And what a change in the character
of the librarian! From a mere keeper
cf books a sort of intellectual jailer
he has become an administrative of
ficer of no mean ability. The modern
librarian must be a scholar, a diplo
mat, a business man, a teacher, a dis
ciplinarian, an executive above all
tilings an organizer and director. And
permit me to say just here that we
iyhen have not yet come to under
it and and appreciate fully the value
ot the service rendered to us by you
librarians. All of us do not realize
vhat a tower of strength you are in
ihe social, civic, moral and intellec
tual life of the community. All of us
Jo not realize and appreciate your
iisj.ixy difficulties your sacrifices, your
iten unappreciated toil, your strug-
f!es with hard-headed trustees anil
.noughtless patrons, your sickenin
dvk of funds. But we are discovering
ciiese things. And I wish to assure
ou librarians as a layman and for the
aymen that we are not unmindful of
,our great service, and we render to
,, ou cheerful and grateful honor for
our unselfish and distinguished ser
.ices, and pledge you our earnest and
ctive co-operation for the future.
Permit me, incidentally, to call at
ention to some of the characteristics
I the modern library. They are its
ntholicity, Democracy and Utility.
l. catholicity. All knowledge is
e province of the library. Science,
.it, religion, law, literature, military
4'airs, manners and customs these
nstitute its life. Moslem and Jew,
.ndoo and Hottentot, Christian anu
aitar, here speak without let or hin
.. ance and without fear or " favor,
ere science "unfolds her ample
age," here justice speaks without
eicy, and here walk again in plain
ud undisguised attire all the poor and
lineely peoples of the past. Here is
o inquisition. Here is no bloody as
ze. Here is no fatal hemlock. Yon
ay range all the boundless seas of
mitless thought and action.
i. Democracy. The modern library
as been aptly described as the peo--ie's
university. "Ho, every one that
airsteth, come ye to the waters; and
e that hath no money come." Rich
nd poor, old and young, the lame, the
alt, yea, even the blind, may come.
I had some time ago a personal ex
erience ilustrative of this democrat
o side of the library. While a teach
r of a Sunday School class, I was
utterly routed and put to flight in a
lassroom discussion one Sunday by
i poorly-dressed, ignorant-lookini
arpenter who was a member of the
iass. The next day, while trying U
. ain new light on the disputed qties-
lon, I found the carpenter in the 11
rary. On the next Sunday I was
gain put to flight by a traveling
alesman, a ' manwho sells axle-
rease. Going to the library again
for aid, I found both the carpenrer
nd the axle-grease man. On the next
Sunday I resigned.'
3 Utility. ' It Is the workshop of the
cholar. the teacher, the student. It
3 the schoolmaster of the public. It
s a social and civic, center. It is a
ome for clubs, societies, guilds. It
s a sort of hub for the community's
ducatlonal activities. It is the chll-
ten's playground, the working-man's
1 hool, the scholar's laboratory, and
i.e gentle reader's paradise.
.But, ladies and gentlemen, I shall
ass by these characteristics and also
.'he ordinary, though by no means un
important routine", that the library
.daily performs in the distribution of
books, and as a home for civic and so
cial meetings, and call especial atten
