CONSTRUCTIVE JIDICIAL REFORM
Mr. Taft continues to give illumlnat
lng suggestions for the reform of the
Judicial administration of the law. It is
not too much to say that he has al
ready pointed out specific remedies
that would wipe out the evils which
1 practically all feel and which every
body admits.
Mr. Taft's latest constructive remedy
is the enactment of a proposed Em
ployers' Liability law, one effect of
•which would be to reduce the number
of damage cases that now take up the
time of the courts. Among his former
recommendationss has been the re
striction of reversals of lower court
Judgments to causes of error that have
really affected the rights of parties
and have not been merely technical.
Mr. Taft also favors the elimination
altogether of many classes of appeals.
It is noticeable that these enumer
ated suggestions of Judge Taft—and
his others are of the same quality—
•would expedite litigation by cutting
out the purely contentions proceed
lngs that are designed to wear out the
resources of -weak litigants. They
also link themselves up—as, notably,
In the advocacy of the Employers'
Liability act—with far-reaching eco
nomic reforms. They show in marked
contrast with weak, palliative meas
ures—like those to increase the num
ber of Judges without remedying the
fundamental evils that pile up cases
on the docket.
TAFT'S BIG VOTE
A few days before the election Pres
ident Roosevelt gave out an opinion
that Mr. Taft's vote would exceed the
unprecedented Republican vote of 1904
1
when Mr. Roosevelt led his opponent
by two and a half millions. This
statement was treated with derision
on the Democratic side, and even
among Republicans there were few
who did not regard it as the exagger
ation of an enthusiast. But the total
vote, as now officially complied, shows
that the president was right again, as
he had been in every important po
litical prediction he had ever made.
The Taft vote is larger by 14,190 than
the Roosevelt vote.
Of course, the extraordinary Roose
velt plurality was due to the unusually
small vote of Judge Parker rather
than to the increase on the Republican
side. It vas to be expected, that Mr.
Bryan would make a large gain over
Parker. But while Bryan's vote was
1,315,211 more than that of Parker, it
fell more than 100,000 short of his
vote twelve years ago, and was only
35,000 more than his vote of eight
years ago. Considering the increase
In the total vote, Mr. Bryan's strength
has steadily declined. Mr. Taft's plu
rality was 1,244,494, as against Mc
Kinley's larger majority of 849,790,
which he received in 1900. The gain
in the total vote this year over the
previous record—-which was made in
1900—was nearly one million vote.
The large vote brought out in the
recent campaign was as compliment
ary to the electorate as it was unex
pected by the politicians. It was
feared through most of the campaign
that the vote would be relatively
small. The country seemed apathet
ic. The campaign was devoid of sen
sational features and what would be
called "burning Issues." It was a cam
paign of reason in the main, and the
lively response of the people was a
tribute to popular interest in elections
and the result was a still higher trib
ute to popular intelligence and inde
pendence. In no other presidential
election in many years have the peo
ple demonstrated more soundly their
capacity to rule. For, aside from the
results, they have shown an indiffer
ence to the old-fashioned campaign
methodB and that they are superior to
the arts of political deception.
WHO'S LAST
In the cachinnation with which the
president's message on the Panama
canal charges
was
It Is said that John Jacob Astor ones
sold a lot near Wall street (or $8,000.
After the papers were signed the pur
chaser seemed disposed to congratu
late himself upon his bargain and In
formed Mr. Astor that In a few years
that lot would be worth $12^000—an
advance of 60 per cent, "That may be
true," replied Astor, "but let me tell
you something: With this $8,000 I
shall buy 40 lots at $300, each out be*
yond Canal street, and by the time
your lots are worth $12,000, my 40 lota
will be worth $80,000, an advance of
900 per cent." Mr. Astor's prophesy
proved true.

greeted in the sen­
ate, Senator Joseph Weldon Bailey Is
said to have taken the lead. The Tex
as statesman was seized with an irre
pressible
spaBm
of mirth, and, in viola­
tion of all the senatorial traditions of
decorum and gravity, laughed outright.
Now, this Ill-timed outburst of levity
from Senator Bailey, as he is certain
to discover, struck a note that will
not fall with harmony on the popular
ear. It was not a time for Senator
Bailey to laugh. Never could he have
hit upon an occasion more unbecoming
for indulgence In mirth. The public
has become too familiar with the rec
ord of the Texas senator to regard
him as amusing, or to see anything
jocular In bis flippant treatment of the
president and his message.
Theodore Roosevelt is neither to be
laughed at or brow-beaten by con
gress out of his purpose to persist to
the end in making his policies ser
viceable to the people, and to curtail
the power of the interests, that regard
that purpose with ridicule. In the op
position of congress and in the disre
spect of politicians of the Bailey stamp
the president will greet with keen sat
isfaction a final opportunity to appeal
to the patriotism of the people who
are with him, heart and soul, and who
fully understand the programme of the
reactionaries in congress to rally for
a last onslaught on the president in
the vain hope of intimidating his suc
cessor.
"Look what we did to Roosevelt," is
what the Bailey stripe of statesman
are planning to say to the people—a
transparent trick that will turn out in
such a way as to shift the laugh quite
to the other side o£ their races.
UNIVERSITY
COLLEGE DEBATERS
CHOSEN HIE
Teams That Will Go Against
South Dakota, Manitoba
and Hamline Named
Friday evening following the free
for-all debate the committee of the
faculty announced its choice of de
baters for the Interstate teams. The
teams chosen will debate with the
teams of South Dakota, Hamline and
Manitoba, the first two to be held at
the homes of the other teams while the
Hamline debate will be held in Grand
Forks.
The team selected to debate against
Manitoba will be composed of O. B.
Herigstad, R. H. Montgomery and A.
K. Reading the team against South
Dakota, of Geo. Shafer, W. J. Tighe
and Geo. Warmer and the one
against Hamline of Wm. Greenleaf,
C. O. Stee and Richard Wenzel. The
alternates, to be drawn upon in the
order given are J. C. Thorpse, Grover
Schmidt and Thomas Burden. These
men are all trained, experienced de
baters. and will unquestionably bring
to the university nothing but victories.
Work on Dacotah
Work on the Dacotah is progressing
very nicely. The department editors
are getting together the most of their
material, and it is expected that by
January 15 the larger part of the lit
erary matter will be in the hands of
the editor-in-chief.
The Dacotah will be a good deal
larger this year than previous, Da
cotahs. This is another Indication of
the wonderful growths of the institu
tion.
Take Negative
Some two weeks ago the debating
board of control submitted the follow
ing question: Resolved 'That the
Lemieux Act (Canadian Act of 1907)
Is Not the Proper Solution of Present
Day Labor Problems in the United
States and Canada," to South Dakota,
Manitoba and Hamline. South Dako
ta and Hamline have chosen the nega
tive and Manitoba the affirmative of
this question.
Public Entertainment
The athletic board of control met
Wednesday and decided to give a pub
lic program sometime during the.
winter term. A permanent committee
was appointed with full power to go
ahead and prepare the program. All
the best talent at the university will
be used on this occasion and It Is ex
pected that this will prove one of the
elation.

"The Greek Play"
The third of the series of public
lectures given under the auspices of
the history department waa delivered
by Prof. Hult Friday afternoon. The
subject of this lecture was "A Greek

the best authorities In the country on
Greek literature and his talk yester
day afternoon was indeed a master
piece,.
Clock or Dam
The general senior class of the uni
versity met Thursday afternoon and
listened to reports by the different
committees. The class play committee
has already written for several plays
and expects to put on some modern
play this year. The pin committee
suggested that the class this year get
fobs instead of pins. The class me
morial committee has under consider
ation the building of a dam on the
coulle and also the erection of a
bronze statute. No definite action was
taken on any of these reports.
N. L. Finley, the editor of the "Con

Mr. Finley Is on an extended tour

dealing with the perservation of

These egrits grow over the eyes of the
herons and reach their best condition
during the breeding season. Since
this is the case, the slaughter of the
adult herons meanB the death of their

Historical Seminary
The work done in the historical
seminary of the state university Is
excellently represented in the second
volume of the collections of the state
historical society which is just aDout
to be published. No less than four
students contributing important and
valuable articles. Miss Berals, of Fin
ley, has an article on "The History
of Riverside Township In Steele Coun

brarian of the State Historical society,
writes on "The Icelandic Lutheran
Synod of America." O. B. Herigstad,
Of Cooperstown, contributes a careful
study of the Norwegian immigration
into the United States, and Le Roy
Jackson, of Grand Forks, tells the
story of Enmegahbour, a converted
Chippewa Indian.' The hfotorlca! sem
inary, under the direction of Dr. Libby
Is doing an immensely valuable work
in thus gathering up the scattered
materials for the history of our Btate
and its people.
The students of the teachers college
met and organized a teacher's club
last Saturday. Their officers arc as
follows: President, Miss Mabel Hen

Secretary—Miss Dora Herman.
The purpose of this organization is
to bring Its members into closer touch
with the school conditions throughout
this state. Leading educators of the
state will be invited to address the

be discussed by different members
from time to time.

Lounger Talks
Dear Mr. Editor: I told you last
week I was going to try to get an in
troduction to Mr. Jefferson and I suc
ceeded In getting a few minutes chat
with after the matinee. I found him
to be of the most sociable turn and
after a very pleasant half hour, dis
covered that instead of my getting
anything worth calling an interview,
he had been making me talk about
myself, the northwest and Grand
Forks in particular. But I had a
pleasant visit, so what's the odds?
The Christmas attractions for
Christmas are on Christmas day, "On
the Frontier," for two performances
and Henry Arthur Jones' play, "The
Hypocrites," with our old friends,
James Nelll and Edith Chapman. From
time to time I have been telling you
of the success Mr. and Mrs. Nelll were
making and it Is surely welcome news
to know that they will be with us so
soon In a splendid play.
I have been thinking of the variety
of ways one can express dissatisfac
tion at the run of events, Shakespeare
says "Tis a cold world, my masters,"
and George Broadhurst "My address
was 23 Lemon street," and if there
is no local news by next week I'll say
"Oh! Fudge."
The Advance Agent
The Hypocrites
'One of the most noteworthy inci
dents of the present dramatic season
will be the presentation at the Metro
politan theater on next Saturday, De
cember 26, of Henry Arthur Jones'
celebrated play "The Hypocrites."
"The Hypocrites" is considered by
many to be Henry Arthur Jones' mas
terpiece the biggest play he has ever
written, excelling even such other
great successes as "The Silver King,"
"Saint and Sinners," 'The Dancing
Girl" or "Mrs. Dane's Defense."
"The Hypocrites" brings into Juxta
position the conditions incident upon
a moral slip into two social strata.
The wrong in both instances is the
same. In one case, however, the un
fortunates are poor people without
position and friends in the other the
youth has wealth and influence In his
favor with a possible seat In parlia
ment as an added Incentive to the best
worldly arrangement
According to the reviewers In New
York, where the play has had an un
precedented run, and in the larger
cities of the east, where it has been
played to enthusiastic audiences, "The
Hypocrites" Is almost a classic, so
forceful are its lines and so tremen
dous the dramatic worth of its sit
uations, which coming In perfect se
