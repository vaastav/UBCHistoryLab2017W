MESSAGE;
CONGRESS
PRESIDENT AGAIN AD
DRESSES PEOPLE.
URGES FINANCIAL RELIEF AND
A SQUARE DEAL FOR
Washington, D. C.—Both houses of
congress devoted the most Important
part of Tuesday's session to hearing
President Roosevelt's message.
The president plunges directly into
the financial and corporation regula
tion questions. He has nothing to
quality nor apologise for. In tact, to
support and emphasize his present
position, he quotes extensively from
previous messages in which he an
nounced his policy of compelling hon
esty in corporation as well as Individ
ual dealing.
There is no hint of abating the en
forcement of this policy. There is no
indication anywhere in the message
of thought of retreat from the square
deal stand originally taken by the
president, nor the slightest admission
that this policy has been in any de
gree responsible for the present flnan
cial trouble.
The statement formerly made by the
president in regard to exposed corpor
ation crookedness: "The administra
tion is responsible for turning on the
light, but is not responsible for what
the light showed," is repeated.'
The president preaches more fed
eral activity in regulating interstate
commerce as much as a matter of
justice to the honest corporation as
to the individual shipper. Along this
line he continues to vigorously urge
congressional action to prohibit mon
opolies formed to control the sale of
necessities of life or articles of gen
eral use.
In regard to the financial situation
the president declares:
"In no nation are the fundamental
business conditions sounder than in
ours at this very moment; and it is
foolish, when such is the case, for
people to hoard money instead of keep
ing it in sound banks; for it is such
hoarding that is the immediate occa
sion of money stringency. Moreover,
as a rule, the business of our people
is conducted with honesty and probity,
and this applies alike to farms and
factories, to railroads and banks, to
all our legitimate commercial enter
prises.
"In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and if the conditions are
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with impunity,
their example is a very evil thing for
the community. When the misdeeds
of these successfully dishonest men
are discovered, suffering comes not
only upon them, but upon the inno
cent men whom they have misled. It
is a painful awakening, whenever it
occurs; and, naturally, when it does
occur those who suffer are apt to for
get that the longer it was deferred
the more painful it would be. In the
effort to punish the guilty it is both
wise and proper to endeavor so far
as possible to minimize the distress
of those who have been misled by the
guilty. Yet it is not possible to re
frain because of such distres from
striving to put an end to the misdeeds
that are the ultimate causes of the
suffering, and, as a means to this end,
where possible to punish those respon
sible for them. There may be honest
differences of opinion as to many gov
ernmental policies; but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
need of unflinching perseverance in the
war against successful dishonesty."
The president here inserts a quo
tation from his 1905 message, making
plain his freedom from hostility to law
abiding corporations and reiterating
his policy of seeking to check either
organized capital or organized labor
only where either acts against law
and justice.
Immediate attention to the currency
problem is urged on congress. The
president advocates the adoption of a
plan of elastic currency which shall
be automatic and open to sound banks
and which would prevent the spasms
of high money and speculation which
obtain in the New York market.
"We need a greater elasticity in
our currency; provided, of course,
that we recognize the even greater
need of a safe and secure currency.
There must always be the most rigid
examination by the national authori
ties. Provision should be made for
an emergency currency. The emer
gency issue should, of course, be made
with an effective guaranty, and upon
conditions carefully prescribed by the
government. Such emergency issue
must be based on adequate securities
approved by the government, and
must be issued under a heavy tax.
This would permit currency being is
sued when the demand for it was
urgent, while securing its retirement
as the demand fell off. It is worth in
vestigating to determine whether offi
cers and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to
themselves. Trust companies should
be subject to the same supervision as
banks."
Favorable consideration of a postal
savings bank is urged as an encour
agement to economy and thrift and to
prevent hoarding of money. The pres
ent time is cited as an Instance in
which the postal savings bank would
be a -mighty factor in keeping funds
in active circulation.
The president also recommends the
extension of a parcels post, especially
on rural routes, as a means of protec
tion for the fanner and the country
storekeeper.
In the matter of extending federal
supervision over Interstate commerce
the president advises either a na
tional Incorporation act or a law
licensing railway companies to en
gage in interstate commerce upon cer
tain conditions. The law should be so
framed as to give to the interstate
oommeroe commission power to pass
upon the future issue of securities,
while ample means should be provided
to enable the commission, whenever in
its judgment it is necessary, to make
a physical valuation of any railroad.
Railroads should be given power to
enter into agreements, subject to
these agreements being made public in
minute detail and to the consent of
the Interstate commerce commission
being first obtained. The railroads
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognize that this control
must come; the only question is as to
what governmental body can most
wisely exercise it. The courts will
determine the limits within which the
federal authority can exercise it, and
there will still remain ample work
within each state for the railway com
mission of that state; and the national
Interstate commerce commission will
work in harmony wltn the several
state commissions, each within its
own province, to achieve the desired
end.
"The congress has the power to
charter corporations to engage in in
terstate and foreign commerce, and
a general law can be enacted under
the provisions of which existing cor
porations could take out federal char
ters and new federal corporations
could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should bq a
method of predetermining by some
federal board or commission whether
the applicant for a federal charter was
an association of combination withiri
the restrictions of the federal law
Provision should also be made for
complete publicity in all matters af
fecting the public and complete pro
tection to the investing public and
the shareholders in the matter of issu
ing corporate securities. The super
vision established might be analogous
to that now exercised over national
banks. At least, the anti-trust act
should be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has shown have been of most
service in enabling monopolistic com
binations to crush out competition
The real owners of a corporation
should be compelled to do business in
their own name. The right to hold
stock in other corporations Bhould
hereafter be denied to interstate cor
porations, unless on approval by the
proper government officials, and a pre
equisite to such approval should be
the listing with the.government of all
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning such stock and
by the corporation in which such stock
is owned.
"To confer upon the national gov
ernment, in connection with the
amendment I advocate in the anti
trust law, power of supervision over
big business concerns engaged in in
terstate commerce would benefit them
as it has benefited the national banks.
In the recent business crisis it is note
worthy that the institutions which
failed were institutions which were
not under the supervision and control
of the national government. Those
which were under national control
stood the test.
The anti-trust law should not be
repealed, but it should be made more
efficient and more in harmony with
actual conditions. It should not pro
hibit combinations that do no injus
tice to the public, still less those the
existence of which is on the whole a
benefit to the public."
The income account of the nation
is pronounced in a most satisfactory
condition. Exclusive of postal busi
ness the government collected $3,465,
000,000 in the past six fiscal years and
spent $3,275,000,000, showing a net
excess of $190,000,000 for the period
The present tariff is given credit for
this showing, and the president de
clares that the principle of this law
could not with wisdom be changed.
Need of occasional revision of the
tariff is advocated, but the president
believes that the subject cannot wise
ly be dealt with in the year preced
ing a presidential election. This is an
assurance that no attempt will be
made to revise the tariff this year.
On the subject of presidential cam
paign expenses the president urges
the corporations shall be prevented
from contributing to the election ot
any candidate. He advocates the rad
ical method of providing a national ap
propriation for each of the great par
ties, sufficient to meet legitimate cam
paigu expenses incurred in the elec
tion of a president. No party receiv
ing such appropriation should receive
more than a fixed amount from private
contributors, these amounts and their
expenditures to be made public.
In reference to law enforcement
the president points out that whereas
a few years ago loud complaint was
made that the law could not be in
voked against wealthy offenders there
is no such complaint now. He com
mends the department of justice for
its prompt procedure against wealthy
malefactors as well as criminals of
other classes. But stronger and more
definite laws are urged, especially f
the line of securing the imprisonment
of lawbreakers, notably of monopoly
offenders, instead of fining them.
Briefly summarized, the president
recommends other legislation as fol
lows:
Income and inheritance tax laws
that the supreme court will declare
constitutional.
Law to limit the abuse of injunc
tions and to protect those rights which
a
from time to time It unwarrantably
invades.
Federal inspection of interstate
lines to investigate and report acci
dents.
Employers' liability act, far reach
ing and thorough-going, which would
apply to all positions, public and pri
vate, over which the national govern
ment has jurisdiction, the law to work
automatically without necessity of
lawsuit, and the employer to assume
all the ordinary and extraordinary
risks involved.
Extension of the eight hour law to
all work carried on by the govern
ment, the government to set the ex
ample in a steady movement for the
general adoption of an eight hour
day.
Compulsory investigation of strikes.
Telegraphers' strike cited as one in
which the president's utmost efforts
within bounds of propriety were un
availing to prevent great loss and in
convenience.
National aid to the states in pass
ing and enforcing laws to check the
child labor evil, overworking of wom
en and protection of employes from
loss of life and limb.
Regulation of the employment of
women and children in territory di
rectly under control of congress, and
renewal of the appropriation to inves
tigate conditions of women and chli
dreu wage earners.
If necessary, ultimate resort to the
federal statute preventing the product
of child labor from entering into in
terstate commerce. •
Co-operation of the national with
state government and associations of
farmers in encouraging institution and
social movements that will meet the
demands of the best type of farmers.
Development of inland waterways,
the Mississippi to be considered first
and, the Columbia river second.
Encouragement to irrigation and re
clamation work wherever needed.
Prompt consideration of the report
of the public lands commission rec
ommending laws that will prevent
vast areas from passing into the hands
of a few men instead of to home mak
ers.
A law placing fourth class postmas
ters under the civil service rules and
included in the classified service.

RECOMMENDATIONS IN MESSAGE
In the president's message to con
gress the following recommendations
are made by Theodore Roosevelt:
The war against successful dishon
esty should continue.
The present panic, brought on by
the speculative folly of a part of the
business community, should be re
lieved for the benefit of the innocent.
Big corporations should be placed
under the control of the government
and the sovereignty of the national
government established.
Laws concerning corporations
should not be negative, but affirma
tive.
The interstate commerce commis
sion should have its power extended
to pass upon future issue of railroad
securities.
Combinations of labor and of capi
tal are necessary. Seek to control
these combinations, not to prevent
them.
The anti trust law should be made
more effective and in accord with
present conditions.
The banking laws must be changed
If the banks are allowed to issue
notes at a certain season so high a
rate of interest should be charged the
banks that the notes will be driven
out of circulation when not absolutely
needed.
The present tariff laws should be
retained, and an effort to change
them would unsettle business condi
tions
An inheritance and income tax
should be part of the system, of gov
ernment taxation.
The criminal laws must be changed,
eliminating technicalities and senti
mentality.
The law by injunction should be
changed so as not to invade rights
The national government should be
a model employer and. provide for
those injured in its service.
The eight-hour law should be put
in force on all government work. „
Compulsory investigation of strikes
and lockouts should be made, and the
disputes settled without loss of time
and energy.
The farms and their products must
be protected. What is wanted is small
farms and many farmers.
Irrigation should be developed and
changes should be made in the land
jaws. Mineral lands should not be al
[owed to fall into the hands of private
wners, and the timber must be pre
lerved.
Postal savings banks should be es
blished.
The government should
rnpaign expenses.
The fleet should be strengthened,
is not for coast defense, but for of
nsive fighting.

Mystery Shrouded tbe Trsanulloae
of a Country Pate Faltlr.
At the old settlers' reunion at Elms,
Mo., recently there was an operator
along the avenue of booths they called
the "duck man," says the Kansas City
Star. The "duck man" manipulated a
wheel with numbers running from one
to eight Then there were nice, smooth
little paddles numbered similarity. It
cost 10 cents to hold a paddle while
tbe wheel spun round; and when It
stopped, if your paddle had the num
ber at which tbe Indicator pointed, you
got the duck. That Is what the sign
In front said. And a live duck was
there In a small cage, where everybody
could see it.
The law of tbe land Is not Intoler
ant when It comes to giving souvenirs
as prizes for skill and especially when
a meek, domesticated bird Is the offer
ing. Prosecuting Attorney Dunham
came up from Macon to make a speech
and to shake hands with his constitu
ents. While here, of course, he viewed
the elephant. They told him every
thing was nice and orderly and that
it would be a waste of good time for
any one to try to sell gold bricks to
that crowd.
The prosecutor casually promenaded
by the spangled man who swallowed
swords, glanced at tbe beautiful snake
sharmer, the Albino queen from St
Louis and the wild man from Kansas
City. But he hesitated before the
"duck man," who appeared to be pros
pering. He saw eight hungry men put
up 10 cents apiece for the chance at a
duck dinner. But tbe winner, after a
few whispered words with the "duck
man," went away without his duck.
Still be didn't appear mad about 1L
Another whlfl of the wheel, and an
other lucky man left, but without the
feathered prize. Mr. Dunham was puz
zled. Maybe the duck was glued to Its
cage. The third winner he accosted.
"Wouldn't be let you have your
duck?" he asked.
The man grinned.
"What the blue blazes d'ye s'pose i
want wld a bloomin' dook fer to bo
luggln' 'round wherever I goes for?"
"Well, what's it to you If you don't
get your duck?"
"Aw, nawthln' ; Jist a chanst ter blow
meself ; it wearies me ter carry so
much coin In me pockets."
Tbe prosecutor bought a paddle and
adversity came. He tried It again
with a ditto result. Next time he hit
the bull's-eye.
"If you'd rather have the money
here's a half-dollar," said the dealer.
"Why, that's gambling!" gasped the
attorney.
"Well, then, take your duck."
The prosecutor sent an officer to ar
rest the "duck man," who made this
explanation to the Justice:
"We wasn't playing for anything but
ducks. Early this morning I sent
around to every farmhouse in these
parts and 1 »ought up all the ducks they
had, but even then we run short, and
so I had to tell the boys thnt won that
I'd give 'em half a dollar apiece as se
curity till we got another supply of
ducks. We'll have some more in the
morning and then they'll come and get
the ducks and baud the money back."
A policeman deposed that ducks were
worth 13^4 cents apiece hereabouts and
that the "duck man's" solitdty bird had
been on duty the whole week. Tbe de
fendant paid a fine of $25 and quite a
bit in costs, but the court told him be
would remit the fine if the winners
came back after their ducks.
