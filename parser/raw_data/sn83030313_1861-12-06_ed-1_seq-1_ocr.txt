To Major Gbhkrai. Giorgb B. McUlxllam, Wjmuncion: ?
CtaaauL ? I am directed by tlio I'rca.dunt to call your
?attention to the following subject: ?
Persons claimed to be held to service or tabor under

In hostile service against the government < f the United
States, frequently escape from tbe lines of the enemy's
?fcroes,an,! are received within the Jlnos of the Army o.
the Potomac. This Department undent! autfs that su.h
persons afterwards coming into tbu city of Washington
? are liable to be arrested by the city police, upon the
presumption. arUing from color, that they are fugitive*
from service or labor. By tbe fourth section of the
act of Congress approved Augrst 6, J 86 1 , entitled "an act
to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes.'
soch hostile employment is mado a full and sudJi ient
answer to any furth r claim to service or labor. Tortious
thus employed mid escaping are received into the mili
tary protection of the United States, and their arre* : as
fugitives from labor or service should be immediately
followed by the military arrest of the parties malting the
seizure.
Copies of this rommtlulcation will be sent to ihe Mayor
of tbe city ol' Washington and to the Marshal of the Dis
trict of Columbia, that any collision betweeu the mili
tary and civil authorities may be avoided.
I am, General, your very obedient servant,
