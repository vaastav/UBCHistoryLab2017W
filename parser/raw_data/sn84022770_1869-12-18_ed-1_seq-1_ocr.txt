PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and Home of Hrpresentaticct :
In coming before you for the first time as
Chief Magistrate of "this nation, it is with
gratitude to the Uiverof all (loodforthe many
benefits wo enjoy. We are blessed with peuce
nt home, ami uro without entangling alliances
abroad or trouhlo to forebode. With a terri
tory unsurpassed in fertility, of au area equal
to the abundant support of five hundred mil
lions of people, and abounding In every variety
of useful mineral, in quantity sullieient to sup
port the world for Reiterations ; with exuberant
crops, with a variety of climate adapted to the
production ol' every species of the earth's pro
ducts, ami suited to the habits, tastes and re
quirements of every living thing ; with u i«>p
illation of forty millions of free people, all
Braking one language, with facilities for every
mortal to acquire an education; with institu
tions closing t ) nine the avenno to lame, or
any blessing of fortune that may lie coveted ;
with freedom of the pulpit, press and schools ;
with a revenue Uowing into the national trea
sury biyoud the requirements of the govern
ment or government demand : harmony is IJU
ing rapidly rest'irei? within our lnirdeis, manu
factures hitherto unknown in our country are
springing up in all directions, producing a de
gree of national independence unequaled by
that of any other power. These blessings, and
e ninth's* others, are entrusted to yourenreand
juiue, for safe keeping for the brief period ol
our tenure of office. In a short time we must
oa--'t of us return to the ranks of the people
who have i on''erred upon us our lowers, and
account toti.cni lor the stewardship. I earn
ed}* dcs'.re that neither you nor 1 n ay be con
demned by a free an.l enlightened constituency,
nor by our own consciences.
Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic
magnitude, uided in it was by the sympathy
ami assistance of a union with which we
were at. peace, eleven States of the Union were
four years ago left without legal State Govern
ments. A debt lias been contracted; American
commerce was almost driven from the seas ;
the industry of one-half the country had been
taken from tho control of the capitalists and
placed where ail labor rightfully belongs, in
the keeping of the laborers.
THE CONDITION OF THE COCNTRY.
The work of restoring State governments
loyal to the Union, of the protecting and fos
tering of labor, and providing means for (lay
ing interest on the public debt, lias received
ample attention from Congress ; and although
your efforts have not met with the success in
nil particulars that might have been desired,
vet on the whole they have been more success
ful than could have been reasonably antici
pated. Seven of the States which passed
ordinances of secession have been fully re
store Jto their places in tho Union. The eighth
(Georgia) lias held an election at which she
ratifie I a Constitution, Hepublican in form,
elected a Governor, members of Congress and
n Statu Legislature, with all other officer's re
quired. The Governor was duly installed,and
the Legislature met and performed till the acts
then required of them by tho reconstruction
nets of Congress. Subsequently, however, in
violation of tho constitution that had just been
ratified, as since decided by the Supreme Court
of the State, they unseated tho colored moni-
.burs of the liCgislatnre anil admitted to units
member* who are »Jit«jut\litio<l by the tliiril
clause of tlic Fourteenth Amendment in the
Constitution, nil article which they themselves
had contributed to ratify. Undertheaecircum-
Ktances I would submit to you whether it would
not be wine without delay to pass a law au
thorizing the Governor of Ge rgia to convene
the members originally elected to the Legis
lature, and requiring each member to take the
oath prescribed by the reconstruction act. This
done, those to be admitted who are ineligible
under the third clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
Tho freednien, under the protection which
they have received, are making rapid progress
in learning, ami 110 complaints are heard of a
lack of industry on their part when they re
ceive fair remuneration for their labor.
The 411 canß provided for paying the interest
oa the public debt, with all other expenses of
government, are more than ample. The loss
of our commerce is the only result of the re
bellion which has not received sufficient atten
tion from you. To this subject I call yonr
earnest attention. I will not now suggest the
ineaus by which this object may be effected,
bat will, if necessary, make it the subject of a
special message during the set siou of Congress.
At tho March term. Congress, by joint reso
lution, authorized the Executive to order an
election in the States of Virginia, Mississippi
and Texas, at which was to bo submitted the
questions *vhi'-h each had previously in con
vention formed. I'nder this authority an elec
tion was culled in Virginia. The election took
place on the Oth of July, 18i0. The Governor
elected has been installed; the legislature
met and did all required by this rewl.ition and
by the reconstruction ac!» of Congress, aiivl
refraiued fr.cn all doubtful authority. I indian affairs
mend to our Senators and Representative* that
the State be. fully restored to its- plaw in th«
family of sta!.-s. Xi?-ti'.'us wvrc called in
gtested to 2Jc®s, JJolilics, the |lisscmiiiatii)u of UTscful Jnfarutnliijn, and the promotion of the, Best Jntcijtsts of 'SSlashißjton s><jrritotj.
Mississippi and Texas, to commence on tin;
}}«tli of November, and to h-st two days in
Mississippi and four days In Texas The elec
tions have tuken place, but the result i« not
known. It is to In; hoped thut the sets of the
Legislature of tl&ne States, when they meet,
will be such a.-s to receive your approbation,
an 1 then close tin- work of reconstruction.
Anion*; the evilsgrowing nut of the reltellion
is that of nil irredeemable eiirreiicy. It in mi
evil which I liopo iviil receive your most care
fill attontiin. It if a duty—one of the highest
of the duties of the (iovoriimcnt —to h tun
to the citizens a tnedinni of exchange of un
varying value. This implies a return to a
siiecie basis, and no substitute for it can be
devised. It should Ik? commenced now, and
reached at the earliest practicable moment
consistent with a fair regard to the interest of
tiio debtor class. Immediate resumption, if
practicable, would not be desirable. It would
compel the debtor claus to pnv Itevond their
contracts the premium on gold at the date of
their purchase, ,und would bring bankruptcy
and ruin to thousands. Fluctuation. however,
in the paper value of tin* nieasiiro of all value
(of gold) is detrimental to trade. It makes the
man of business an involuntary gambler, for
iu all sales, when future payment is to be made,
both parties speculate as to what will be the
value of the currency when paid and received.
I earnestly recommend to you. then, such legis
lation as will insure a gradual return to specie
payments, and put un immediate stop to fluctu
ations in the value of the currency. The
methods to secure these results are as numer
ous as are the speculations on political econ
omy. To secure the latter. 1 see but one way,
ami that is to authorize the treasury to redeem
its own paper at fixed prices whenever pre
ser.' "l, and to withhold from circulation all
such currency redeemed until sold again for
gold. The vast resources of the nation, both
developed and undeveloped, ought to make
our credit the best on the earth. With a less
burden of taxation than the peoplo have
endured.for six years past, the entire public
debt could be paid in ten years; but it is do
siraMo that the people should not be taxed to
pay it in that time. Year by year the ability
to "pay increases in a rapid ratio, but the burden
of interest ought to bo reduced as rapidly as
can lie done without thu violation of the con
tracts. The public debt is represented in
great part by bonds, having from five to
twenty and tn.ni ten to forty years to run,
bearing interest at the rate of six per cent,
and five per cent., reflectively. It is op.
tional with the government to pay these b. n Is
at any ]>eriod after the expiration ot the last
term mentioned upon their line. The term
has already expired when a great part of them
may Is- taken up, and the time is rapidly
approaching when all may be. It is believed
that all which are now due may be replaced
by bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceed
ing four and one-half per cent., and as rapidly
as the remainder become fine they may be re
placed in the smne way. To accomplish this,
it may Is- necessary to authorize interest to be
paid at cither of* the three or four money
centers of ICurope, or liv any assistant trea
surer, at the option of the holders of tie- bonds.
I recommend this subject for the consideration
of Congress. Also, simultaneously with this,
the propriety of redeeming our currency as
before suggested, at its market value, at tin
time the law goes into effect increasing the
rate at which currency will be bought or sold
from day to day or week to week, at the same
rate of interest us the government pays upon
its bonds.
Tlio subject cf tnriff nn 1 internal taxation
will n'ressarily receive your attention. The
revenues of the country are greater than tho
requirements, nnil may with »afety he reduced;
hut us the fun.linn the debt in four or four
and one-half pt r cent, bonds would reduce the
animal current expense largely, and then after
funding, justify a greater reduction of taxation
than would be now expedient, I suggest the
postjiouoniont of this until the next meeting
of Congress, when it may lie advisable to
modify taxation and tho tariff in instances
where unjust or burdensome discriminations
are made by the present laws. Hut a general |
revision of the laws regulating this subject, I
recommend this postponement for the present.
1 ulsS suggest tho renewal of tho tax on
incomes, but i\t reduced rates —say of three
per cent. —this tax to expire in throe years.
With tho funding of tho national debt,
1 feel safe ill saying that the taxes and revenue
from imports may be reduced safely from sixty,
to eighty millions |kt annum at once, and still
further reduced from year to year as the re
sources of the country are developed.
Tlie Treasury Rejiort shows tho receipts of
the g werninent for Hie fiscal vearending June
30, ld'J'J, to be $370.1)43,747, and the expendi
tures, including interest, etc., to be $321,490,-
597. The estimates for the ensuing year are
more favorable to tho Government and will,
no doubt, show a large decrease of the public
debt. The receipts in tho treasury bevon.l
expenditures have exceeded the amount ne
cessary to place to the credit of the sinking
fund, as provided To lock up the
surplus in the treasury and withhold it frcm
circulation would lead to such a contraction
of the currency as to cripple trade and seri
ously affect tho prospects of the country.
Under these circumstances, the Secretary of
the Treasury and myself heartily concurred in
properly using all this surplus currency in tho
treasury for tho purchase of Government
bonds, thus reducing the interest bearing debt
of the country, and of submitting to Congress
the question of tho disposition to be made of
the bonds us purchased. The l>onds now held
by the treasury amount to about $75,000,000,
including those belonging to the sinking fund.
1 recommend that the whole be placed to the
credit of the sinking fund.
Your attention is resi»ectfully invited to the
recomniendations of the Secretary of the Trea
sury for the creating of the office of Commis
sioner of the Custom Revenue, for the increase
of salary to a certain class of officials, and the
substitution of increased national funds in
circulation to replace the outstanding 3 per
cent, certificates, and more especially to his
recommendation for the repeal of tin? laws al
lowing shares of lines, penalties, forfeitures,
etc., to tho officers of tho Government or to
informers. The office of Commissioner of
Internal Revenue is one of tho most onerous
and important under the Government. It falls
but little if any short of a Cabinot position in
its importance and responsibilities. It is there
fore recomineuded to adopt such legislation • as
in your judgment will place this office on a foot
iug of dignity commeusunite with its im(iort
ance and character, and ability and qualifica
tion with the class of men required to fill it
projierly.

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON TERRITORY, .SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 18, 1869.
HN'AXI ES.
' our views upon unwilling nations, from taking
ail interested part in initiatory quarrel* be
tween different nations or between govern
ments nnd their subjects. Our course should
always be in conformity with strict justice and
international law to all. Such lias been the
jxdiev of the Administrationdcaliug with these
questions. For more than a year a valuable
province of Spain, a near neighbor of ours,
in whom all our people cannot but feel a deep
interest, has been struggling for its inde|x?nd
ence and freedom. The people and (fovern
luent of the United States entertains tlie same
warm feeling and sympathies for tlio people
of Cuba in their pending struggle tlmt tliey
manifested throughout tlie previous struggles
between Spain and her colonies in behalf of
the latter. Hut the countries, at no time, have
assumed the co'iditions wlii *h rjuount to wiir
in tho sense of international law, or wlii--U
would show tlie existence of a ]« -litical organ
ization of insurgents sulflcient to justify a
recognition of their bellie-ereney. The prin
ciple is maintained, however, that this le.ti n
will be its own judge ns to the rights of be!-
ligorency, eitherto a |ieople struggling to force
themselves from a government they believe f>
be o|iprotit ive, or to independent nations at
v.*ar with each other. '1 in- I'nited Stntet- have
no ilis)K-.sitioii to interfere with the exeting
'relations* of S; nin to her colonial possessions
on this continent. They believe in due time
Spain an I other European powers will find
their interest terminating these relations and
establishing their present dejiendencies as in
dependent [towers, as members of the family
of nations. These dependencies arc no longer
regarded as subject to transfer from one Eu
ropean power to another. When tho present
relations of the colonies cease, they in-* to be
come independ* nt powers; exercising the right
of choice and of selfcontrol in the determina
lion of their future condition and relations
with other powers. The I'nited Stat in
order to put a stop lo bloodshed in Cuba, and
in the interest of a neighboring people,
pr"ffercd lier good offices to bring tie- existing
contest to a termination. The offer not being
accepted by Spain on a beds which it was
believed could be received by Cuba, it was
withdrawn.- It is hoped that tlie good olllees
of the I'nited States may yet prove ndvan
tageous for tlie settlement of this unhappy
bt niggle. Meanwhile a number el illegal ex
1-edit io: s against Cuba have been broken up.
It litis been the endeavor ot the Administra
tion to execute lite neutrality laws iu {food
faith, no mutter how unpleasant the te.sk imiv
be, so tiiat they may avert the sutl'eiing wo
li.ivo endured from a lack of good taith toward
the I'nited States by other outioa's in regard
to us.

the irregularity of bis .conduct, and that the
Spanish authorities in Cuba would not sanc

treat with disrespect the sovereignty of tjie

Tirijr Alary Lowell at one of the Bahama In
lands by the Spanish authorities is now the
subject of n corres|Hmd'iice between this
Government and that of S]>ain and Great

May last, issued a proclamation authorizing a

Immcdin' remonstrance agninst this was
made, u.ivreupon the Captuin General issued
a new proclamation. limiting the right of
search of vessels of the Cnited States so far
us authorized under tlio treaty of 1705. This
proclamation, however, was immediately with
drawn. 1 have always felt that the most
intimate relations should be cultivated between
the IJepublic of the Cnited States and all in
dependent nations on this continent. It may
be well worth considering whether treaties
between the United States and them may not
be profitably entered into to secure more in
tituaie relations, friendly and otherwise.

The subject of an interoceanlc canal to con

practicability of such an undertaking, and a
charter for the right of way, to lie built, by

to operate ngainsi Peru, orders were grvMi <o
prevent their departure. Whether steps have
been taken by the representatives of. the Peru

these vessels, 1 du not feel authorized to detain
the property of the nation with whom we are

RELATIONB WITH OHKAT 11 RITA IS.
Towards the close of the last administration
a convention was signed at Ldtkdoa for the aet
tlcment of all outstanding claims between
threat Britain and the United States, which
failed to receive the advice and consent of the
Senate to its ratification. The timo aud dr
cumstancss attending the negotiation of tbe
treaty were favorable to its acceptance by tlio '
people of the United States, but its provisions
were wholly inadequate for tho settlement of
the grave wrongs that have been sustained by
this government, ns well as the citizens. The
injuries resulting to the I'nited States by rea
son of tho coarse adopted by -Great Britain 1
during our late civil war, in the increased rates !
of insurance, in the diminution of exports and |
imports, ami In other respects ; on domestic i*
industry and production ; in Its effect upon tho !
foreign commerce of flic countrv ; itt tlie <K>- !
crease and transfer to tlreat, Itritain of our j
conunercial murine; iu tlie prolongation of j
our war, and the increased cost both in treasure |
and dves of Its suppression, could ndt be ad- j
justed and satisfied as ordinnry commercial <
claims, from which they differ more widely in i
the gravity of their character than in the mag- |
nitudeof their amount, great even ns that is. ■
There was found a wide difference of opinion
as to the reciprocity treaty between the United
States and the Hritish provinces on this conti
nent which has not been favorably considered
by the Administration. The advantages of
such a treaty would be wholly in favor of the
Hritish producer, except, possibly, as to n few
engaged in the trade between the two sections.
No citizen of the United States would be ben
efited by sueh reciprocity. Our internal taxa
tion would prove n protection to tlie Hritish
producer almost equal to tho protection which
our manufacturers now receive from
Some arrangement, however,for the regulation

It having come lo my knowledge tlmt acor
p. rate company, organized under British laws,
proposed to land u|>on the shores of the United
States, and to operate their submarine cable
under coiih ss' t . from His Majesty, the Km
jH'rorof the French, with an exclusive rijrlit
for twenty years of telegraphic communication
between the shores of France and the United
States, with the very objectionable feature of
subjecting all nvssagescoiifid'Ml tothem totho
su veillance and control of the French <lovern
inent, I caused the French and British Lega
tions at Washington to be made acquainted
with the probable jtolicv ef Congr -ss on the
subject, as foreshadowed bv tlio bill which
passed the Senate in March last. This drew
from the representatives of the company an
agreement to accept as a basis of their opera
tions the provisions of the bill, or of srtch
other enactments on the subject ns might be
passed during the appro|U'hing session of Con
gress : also, to use their influence to secure
fn mi the French Government a modification of
their concession so as to permit tlio landing
upon French soil of a cable belonging to any
coin pan v incorporated by authority of the
I 'nited States, or any State in the United States,
and on their part not to oppose the establish
ment of any such cable. In consideration of
this agreement. 1 directed the withdrawal of
all opposition by the United States authorities
to the landing of the cable and the working of
it until the meeting of Congi-ess. I regret to
sav there has been no modification made in the
Company's concession, nor so far ns I can learn
have they attempted to secure one. Thctrenn
cession excludes the capital and the citizens of
the United States from competition upon the
shores of France. I recommend legislation to
protect tlio rights of citizens of the United
States, as well ns the dignity anil sovereignty
of the nation against such an assumption. I
shall also endeavor to secure by negotiation*
an abandonment of the principle of monopo
lies on ocean telegraphic cables. Copies of
this correspondence are herewith furnished.
Thn unsettled political condition of those
countries le.-y fortunate than our own some
times induce their citizens to come to the

naturalized. Having Mctrroi) this they return
to their native country and reside there, iiud
\\ilhout disclosing their change of allegiance
they accept official positious ol trust and honor
which can only be held by citizens of their na
thelaud. They journey under pnsfporis de
scribing them as such citizens,-and it is only
when civil discord, after perhaps years of quiet,
threatens tbern or threatens their persons or
property, or when their native state draws them
into its military service, that fact of this change
of allegiance is made known. They reside
permanently from the United States, they con
tribute uotliing to the'r revenues; they avoid
the claims of its citizenship, ami they only
make themselves known by asking for ourpro
tection, I have directed the diplomatic and
consular officer.-: of the United States to scruti
nize carefully all such clains of protection.
The citizeu or the United States, whether na
tive or adopted, who discharges his duty to his
country, is entitled to complete protection and
should have a voice in the direction of its af
fairs. But I shall not consent to impair a
sncted right by conferring it upon fictitious or
fraudulent claimants.

Your attention is respectfully called to tho
law regarding tariff ou Prussian hemp, and to
tlie question whether to fix tho charges on
Prussian hemp higher than they arc fixed upon
Manilla, is not a vialation of onr treaty with
.Prussia, placing her products upon tlie same
footing with those of the most fevered nations).
Our manufactures are increasing with wonder
ful rapidity under the encouragement which
they now receive,and with improvements in ma
chinery already effected, and they are still in
creasing, thus causing machinery to take the
place of skilled labor to a large extent. Otir
imports of many articles must fall offlargely
within a few years. Fortunately too ninny
manufactures are not confided to a few locali
ties, ns formerly, and it is to bn hoped that
they will become more and more diffused, mak
ing the interest in them eifaal in all sections.
They give employment to hundreds and thous
ands of people at heme, and retain with us
mcane which otherwise would be shipped
abroad. The extension of railroads in Kuropc
and the East is bringing into competition with
our agricultural produce those of other coun
tries. Self-interest, if not. self-preservation,
therefore, declares in f.ivor of caution against
disturbing any industrial interests of tlie coun
try. It tenches us also the necessity of look
ing to her markets for the sale of oursufplus.

the effoits of one of our distinguished citzeus
that the world is about to commence largely
increased relations with the populous and
hitherto exclusive nation. As tho United

they should lie the most earnest in showing
their good faith and making it a success. In

TMI! OBJECT OF illE ADMINISTRATION.
On tnv assumin.Tthe responsibilities of Chief
Magistrate of the I'nited States, it was with
the conviction that three things were isscntial
to its peace and prosperity, and to the fullest
development. First among these is strict in
tegrity in fulfilling our obligations; second, to
secure protection to the person ar.d property
of the citizen of ou:' common country, where
ever lie may chance to move, without reference
to original nationality, religion, color or poli
tics, demanding of liim obedience to the laws
and a proper respect for the right cf others ;
third, the union of all the States,with rights in
disputable by any but Constitutional mentis.
To secure the first of these, Congress has tak
en two essential steps ill declaring hv joint res
olution that the public debt should bo paid,
principal and interests, in coin. Stcoud, by
providing this means for paying tlia principal-
However, we would not secure the object de
sired without the ffc'uper administration of lr. <rs
for collection of revenues, ntfd the economical
disbursement of them. To this subject the
Administration has most earnestly addressed
itself, with results, I believe, satisfactory to
tlie country. There has been no hesitation in
changing officials in order to secure the effi
cient execution of the laws; sometimes, too,
where in a mere party view, the political re
sults that were following from any hesita
tion in sustaining efficient officers against
remonstrances wholly political. [Somewhat
indefinite.]
It may be well to mention here that embar
rassment may possibly arise from leaving on
the statute book the so-cnlled Tenure of offive
acts, and to earnestly recommend their total
repeal. It could not have been the intention
of the framers of the Constitution, wlien pro
viding that appointments made by the Presi
dent should receive the consent of tlio Senato,
that the latter should have the power to retain
in offices persons displaced by federal appoint
ments against tUe will of the President. The
law Is inconsistent with a faithful and effective
administration of tlio Government. What
faith can the Executive put in officials forced
upon him ; those, too, whom ho has suspend
ed for reason? How would such officials be
likely to serve the Administration which they
know does not trust them. For the second
requisite to our growth and properity, time
a fir:n but humane administration of existing
laws, amended from time to time as they may
prove ineffectual or harsh or nnntcessary, are
probably all that is icquired. The third can
not be obtained by special legislation, hot nutst
bo rigarded ns fixed by the Constitution itself
and gradually scijuircsced in by the force of
public ojiiniorf.
AFFAIIIS.
From the foundation of the Government to
the present, the management of the original
inhabitants of this continent (the Indians) has
been attended with continuous robberies,
murders and wars. From my own experience
when on the frontiers and in Indian countries,
1 do not IroM either tfie legislation or the con
duct of the whites who come nearest in contact
with the Indians blameless. The deeds of the
past, however, cannot be undone, and the
question must be inet as we n6w find it. I
have adopted a new poliuy towards these
wards of the nation. They cannot bo regard
ed in nuy other light than as wards. It has
been attended with fair results so far as tried,
and will, I hope, be attended ultimately- with
great success. The Society of Friends is well
known as having succeeded in pence with the
Indians in the early settlement of Pennsylva
nia, when their white neighbors of other sec
tions were constantly embroiled. They arc
also known for their opposition to all strife,
violence and war, nro generally noted for their
strict integrity and fair den.ing. These con
siderations induced me to give the manage
ment of a few t-eservations of Indians to them,
and to throw the burden of the selectiou of
agents upon the society itself. The result has
proved most satisfactory. It will be fonnd
wore ftilly set forth in the report of the Com
missioner of Indian Affairs and of the Super
intendent*. For Indian Agents not on reser
vations, officer* of the army were selected.
The reasons for this are numerous. Tbe Indi
an Agents are sent here or there. The troops
must be sent also. Tbe agent nod the com

partments of tbc Government. The arrby offi
cer holds a position for life—the agent one at
the will of the President. The former is peN

the Indians and the establishment of pcrma*

life may lie sp«nt within Use limits of the civ

which looks to the extermination of a race U

such a system, except in placing all the Indi
ans on largo reservations lis rapidly as it can
beulo'ne, nui giving them absolute protection

to set up territorial government for their own

WAll DEPARTMENT.
The report uf rlic Secretary of War show!
the expenditures oi'tlie War Department for ihu
year ending BCth of June, 1809, to be SSO,-
04").042, of which 5i28,K82..110,,WH8 disbursed
in the payment of debts contracted, daring the
war, and is not chr.rgaMc to the current arirj'
expenses. The estimate of the nriny for the
next liscal year is as low as it is believed itcoft
I.e. Tlio estiinntca of the bureau of officers
lmve been carefully scrutinized, and reduced
wherever it lias been deemed practicable. If,
however, the condition of the country should
be such by the beginning of the next fiscat
year as to admit of a greater contraction of
troop?, the appropriation asked (or will not bo
expended. The appropriation estimates for
river improvements, and fortifications are sub
mitted separately. Whatever amount Con
gress mnv deem proper to appropriate for these
purposes will be expended.
The recommendation of the General of the
army that appropriations bo made for the forta
at ISoston, Portland, Nek- York, Philadelphia,
New Orleans and San Francisco, if for no Oth
ers, is concurred in. 1 also ask your special
attention to the recommendation of the general
commanding the Military Division of the.l'aci
fic for the sale of seal islands of St. l'uul and
St. George, Alaska Territory, and suggest that
either it be complied with ur
be had for thp protection of tlie seal fisheries,
from which a revenue should'he derived.
The report of the Secretary of War contain*
a synopsis of the heads of bureaus of tfce com
manders o( the military divisions of the Dis
tricts of Virginia, Mississippi and Texr.g, and
the report of the General of the army in full.-
The recommendations, therein contained have
been considered, and are submitted for your
action. 1, however, call your special attention
to the recommendation of the Chief of Ord- '
nance for the s;ilc of arsenals and lands no
longer of use 'o the Government, t also
recommend lh<S suggestion of the Secre
tary of War that the act of the 3d of March,
prohibiting promotions and appoint
ments in the staff corps of the army be re
pealed. The extent of the country to bo garri
soned, and the number of military posts to bo
occupied, as th 6 rule, is the same with a re
duced as with a large one. The number of
staff officers required is more dependent upon
the latter than the former condition.
THE SAW.
The report of the Secretary of the N'nvy, ac
companying this, shows the condition ol the
navy when this Administration cniue into office,
and the changes that hnvc been made fincc.
Strenuous efforts have bten maje'to place air
many vessels in commission, or render them fit
for service if required, as soon as possible, and
substitute" the s ail for steam while cruising;
thus materially reducing the expense gof thai
navy and nddinp materially to its efficiency.
Looking to our future, a liberal though not ev
travagant policy towards this bruuch of the
public service is recommended.
THE POSTAL SERVICE 1
Tlic report of the Postmaster Greheraf
furnishes a clear an J comprehensive exhib
it of the operations of tho Postal eeavice
and of tho financial condition. Of this
part of the Postoffice Department the ordi
nary postal revenues for the year ending
Juno 30th, 1809, a:nount to 81 8,344 ,001,-
and theexpcnditurcs to 828,689,13'1. show
ing an excess of expenditures orer tho re
ceipts of Thcoxcessofej;pon-,
ditures over receipts for the previous year
amounted to 50,437,992, the increase of'
this department's revenues for 1860 orer
those of 1808, was 82,051.909, and the in
crease of expenditures was 89,<175,938/
The increased revenue of 180'J exceeded
the increased reveuueof 18(J8 by ?99<J,33C.'
The increased expenditures in 1809 were
$2,527,570 less than the increased expendi
tures in 18(17, showing by comparison this '
gratifying feature of improvement, that
while the increase of expenditures over the
increase of receipts in 1808 Wis 82,449,-
