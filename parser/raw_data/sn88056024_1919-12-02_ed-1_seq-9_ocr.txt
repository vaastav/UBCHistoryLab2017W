FINANCIAL REVIEW
New York, Dec. 2.—The New York
Evening Sun's financial Review today
says.
Although the president's message to
congress touched on most of the topics
which now are agitating the mind
the financial world and the country at
large, It did not refer, except to post
pone, two subjects which mote than
most others concern Wall street
railroad and treaty legislation. The
omission was a distinct disappoint
ment. Throughout the forenoon trad
ing marked time as prices advanced
slowly, but steadily, some ono to
three points or more on a general
level, and much more than that among
Issues which arc Catalogued as high
ly spéculative In character. At noon,
as the message began coining over
the wires, business was largely sus
pended while the process of digesting
its contents wax going on. After that
prices displayed a tendency to ease,
hut throughout the session it was no
ticeable tiiat offerings of long stock
Were light.
Price movements were mixed and
unsettled through the middle of the
afternoon, but in the last hour the list
steadied and showed a barely con
sistent trend forward. Business
bonds was active, particularly in t
issues which with the exception
second fours, was soft, declining
of a point.
Sterling rates were quoted at
of $3.94Vi, a decline , of more
5 cents with partial recovery in the |
afternoon.

Use Grandma's Sage Tea and!
WOV O
Sulphur Recipe and Nobody
Will Know.
The use of sage and sulphur for re
storing faded, gray hair to its natural
color dates back to grandmother's
time. She used It to keep her hair
beautifully dark, glossy and attractive.
Whenever her hair took on that dull,
faded or streaked r^openlrance, this
simple mixture was applied with won
derful effect.
But brewing at home is mussy and
out-of-date. Nowadays, by asking at
any drug store for a bottle ol "Wyeth's
Sage and Hulphmur Compound,'' you
will get this famous old preparation,
improved by the addition of other in
gredients, which can be depended up
on to restore natural color and beauty
to the hair.
A well known dowlown druggist sayH
it darkens the hair so naturally and
evenly that nobody can tell it lias been
applied. You simply dampen a sponge
or soft brush with it and draw this
through your hair, taking one strand
at a time. By morning the gray hair
disappears, and after another applica
tion or two, it becames beautifully dark
and glossy.—Adv.

FOOLING WITH
HEALTH SERIOUS
I have frequently asked druggists
"What do you push in a blood medi
cine?" The answer usually came, "The
kind I can muke the most money on."
My answer has always been, "Not me."
I have succeeded pretty well and I
have always recommended the one that
I had found by experience to be the
best and the one I w r ould be willing to
take myself or give to members of my
own family. I have never offered the
public a medicine that we do not use
at home. That is why I can offer
"Number 40 For The Blood," with a
clear conscience; we have not only
tried it. on thousands of others, but on
ourselves. We take it in all cases
where a blood medicine is needed, no
matter In what form it shows itself
and we get splendid results in consti
pation, kidngy, stomach and - liver
Doubles. I firmly believe that if evry
one would begin in the spring and take
"Number 40" they would escape ma
laria and fevers in all forms. J. C.
