DEFRAUD THE GERMANS
(Continued from Pag? One.)
t ered by the department's agents in the
last two years. Mr. Bieluski has taken
care to confine himself to propaganda, it
was pointed out. and this virtually was
n separate branch of German work in
this country, both before and after the
United States entered the war. Ordi
narily propaganda was carried on by a
distinctly different group of German
agents or pro-German Americans, and
the Herman agents took great pains to
keep knowledge of sabotage plans from
these propagandists.
The riles of the bureau of Investiga
tion are said to contain hundreds of
names of Herman agents, and Americans
with whom they had dealings in garner
ing information about the nation's war
preparations and concerning Germany's
enemio?.'befrire this country entered the
war. These niunes have not been dis
closed.
When Mr. Rielaski appears before the
senate committer again to-morrow for
examination it is possible that some
senators may Question him about phases
of the bureau's work other than the
fight against enemy propaganda.
Throughout the war. it has been the
policy of the department of justicif to
maintain strict secrecy regarding most
matters relating to investing agents, in
cluding internments of enemy aliens.
Attorney General Gregory said many of
these war secrets would be made known
at the proper time after the war.
CONTROL OF RAILROADS
(Continued Prom Page One)
ment iri which ! h^y declared thai Di
rector Genera! McAdoo's suggestion that
the government retain control of the,
railroad until January. tO-4 "would Pim
ply lead to delay and confusion, demor
alization of the ortramzation of the,
roads, both on their corporate and oper
ating side, and defer indefinitely a sat
isfactory settlement" of the ? railroad
problem.
The executives, the statement said.!
have reached the conclusion that "there!
is sufficient time under the terms- of
the present aet to fullv consider the
railroad situation in all its aspects and
arrive at a plan that would be just to!
the country.**
The statement was given out. by
Thomas Dew.it Cuyler. Philadelphia, i
chairman of the railway executives' ad
visory committee, now known as the as-,
social ion of railway executives. Thej
association is considering problems that
will arise in connection with the return ;
of the railroad properties to their pri- j
va'e owners.

l:.\!.TtM<>ni:. Md.. Dec. 1 ?g. pa.
? . i V> -arf ield. president of the National
Association of Owners of "Railroad Se
etiriiies. was asked what would he the
position of the association in view of
Director General .McAdoi.'s letter to Con
gress. asking that tie- time for the re
turn of the railroads be extended to five
years. Before leaving for Charleston
tonight. Mr. "Warfield said:
"The position taken in respect to fh?
return of the railroads has been recently
antiounced in two statements in the
press. Nothing in the present situation
alters th<? course then determined upon
s- far as I can see. These statements
xvem made after President Wilson's
message to Congress, leaving it to that
body to work out the methods under
v liich the railroads are to be returned
and enact such 'legislation as may he
necessary as early as practicable.
"It was at that time we announced
the names of the recently appointed ad
visory council to the association. Th"
executive committee in consultation
with advisory counsel and also general
counsel is now engaged in considering
nlans for the return of the railroads.
As already stated..a letter was sent to
the chai Ui* inters fate corn me rev

I committees of the senate and of the

jthe return of the railroads as soon as

! formulated. This association does not

| r- .-ilizos the importance of this subject.
| a:o.| it is the purpose of the association
| pri"r to presenting any suggestions it
| may formulate to the congress to con
,s.tit with gomniitrees, organizations and
others concerned, including shippers. I
' th.-i1 unit v of thought ran b?- .secured if'
| possible. "
"The federal control act provides
jtwaty-one months from the formal an-!
1 nounceinent of peace for the return'of j
i these properites. therefore congress,.
I which after all 'he body that will!
j sett!.* this question. provided itself with)
I abundant time to make plans for their!
