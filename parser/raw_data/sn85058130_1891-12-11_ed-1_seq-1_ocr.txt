TIE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT
Difficulty of EnforcementCase of the Itata

WASHINGTON Dee 10Tha annual ro
port of Attorney General Miller was sub
mitted to Congress today I reviews
the business of the United States supremo
court and devotes a chapter to the circuit
court of appeals which ho says has been
organized in each circuit and is ready for
business although an additional circuit
judge in each circuit has not been appointed
Mention is made of the heavy increase in
the
BUSINESS OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS
and a recommendation is made that the
orking force of the court bo largely in
creased Ho says it is also necessary that
some provision be made for the representa
tion of the Interests of the government be
fore the board of appraisers in customs
cases appealed from tho collector to the
oard of appraisers
He invites attention to the special report
on the subject of Indian depredation claims
and showed the importance of a change in

On the suject of
UNITED STATES PRISONS
he attorne general says In pursuance
of the recommendations in the annual re
port of this department a bill was passed
b iy the last Congress authorizing the con
s tructicn of three United States prisons
t o be located ono north and another south i
o f the 89th degree of north latitude and j
cast of the Rockies and a third west of
t ho Rockies but by evident inadvertence
f ailed to make any appropriation for the
purchase of sites and the erection of such
b mildings I recommend that the appro
priations evidently contemplated by that
act be made so this work may go forward
After speaking of the wellknown difficulties
culties in the enforcement of the Chinese
e exclusion act he says If it i desired that
THESE LAWS SHALL BE MADE EFFECTIVE
they should be so changed that they can
not be misunderstood To arrest and try
uch persons and as a result simply send
hem back across the British line is shown
to be an idle expenditure to me of labor
md money by the fact that as might well
je expected the same persons have to be
arrested and tried over and over again
Moreover it is quite uncertain whether the
rder requiring Chinese prisoners sent
ack into the British dominions could be
made effective This subject demands I
prompt consideration
From information official and unofficial
in regard to the administration of the laws
of Alaska the attorneygeneral is im
pressed that such administration is not
satisfactory and that it can only be made
satisfactory by new legislation The
attorne general called attention to tho
evils of the fee system and advises
cases the substitution of stipulated salaries in all
Ho reviews the legal proceeding in the
CASE OF THE CHILIAN STEAMER ITATA
and sums up as follows Upon the trial
of this indictment it was held by the dis
trict court these proceedings were not in
violation of the neutrality laws of tho
United States First because the enter
prise was a legitimate commercial trans
action and second because the Congres
sional party of Chili not having at the time
received recognition from the government
of the United States either as a government
de jure or as a beligerent the acts done
by the representatives of and In the In
terest of that party in the way of hostilities 1
ties against the Chilian government were
not in violation of the statute of the United
Unied
States In short that it is only in the in
terest of a government recognized as such
de jure or as a beliperent that the neut
rality statute of the United States can be
violated Without discussing the proposi
tion that such a transaction is legitimate
commerce I venture the suggestion that in
case of serious injury to the commercial or
other interests of a nation with which
we are at peace by snips fitted out in our
harbors tne plea of such nonrecognition
nonrecogniton
would be a very insufficient answer If
the construction given to these statutes I I
the trial court shall be sustained appeal
the statute should I think be amended

general by proper proceedings to orovent
any unlawful interference with the rights

the attorney eneral says In tho suits

not inhabitants of any district in the state
by which they were created
TOUCHING THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION
raised by thoso corporations that they are
not residents of California the result of
such contention is that a corporation like
corporaton lke
the Western Union Telegraph company a
New York corporation which Is doing
business in every state and district In the
union which has the right to sue in tho
federal courts of the various districts and
i sued in a state court they may movo
such nuits for litigation into tho federal
courts cannot be sued in federal courts in
any state outside of Now York it is not
believed such is the law at least where
the government is plaintiff Certainly
it was not the intention of Congress in
the enacting judiciary law of 1888 to
thus make corporations a privileged
class I recommend that section 1
of the act of August 18 1888 2 stat p
43 be amended by inserting a proviso
after the word inhabitant in the follow
folow
ing sentence namely And no civil suit
shall be brought before either of said
courts against any person Dy any original
process or proceeding in any other dis
trict than that wherein he is an inhabit
ant provided any foreign corporation
corporaton
may be sued in any district whore it may
be found process to be served as in like
lte
cases in the state where said suit or action
is brought acton
Such amendment would restore the law
to what it was for a century prior to the
act of March 3 1887 and would impose on
these corporations a liability to bo sued
corresponding to the right they enjoy to
sue as plaintiffs and to remove suits In
which they are defendants

Springer Outlines His Tariff Policy
WASHINGTON Dec 10Springer who
will likely be chairman of the ways and
means committee if Mills is offered and
declines tho honor said today his policy
with reference the tariff was to provide
for free wool free ss t olumber free
cotton ties free coal and free binding
twine He said 1 do not think we I
should attempt a general revision of tariff
at this time We should offer the country
releif by passing bills for putting the
articles named on the free list and sending
them to tho Senate A general tariff bill
cannot be enacted into a law and would I
keep Congresshero until October I think
there should be appointed a strong com
mittee on manufacture with able invisti I
gators on it I should consist of fifteen I
members ten Democrats and five Republicans
cans This would make a subcommittee
of three each They should divide the
work one investigating textile industries
another nn production another glassware
and pottery and so on Tnis committee
would be a sort of adjunct to the ways od
means committee which could go on with
its work and then subsequently get nil the
testimony without a long list of hearings
These subcommittees could go on
during the session and also during the re
cess Their inquiries should not bo
con
ducted with a spirit of Hostility toward
manufacturers but with a view to ascer
tain in each case what if any degree of
protection is needed as I have a suspicion
that frequently it is represented that they
need a great deal more protection than is
really the case It should be ascertained
what the labor costs on things produced
wages paid whether work will be steady
or not profits on actual capital and not on
watered stock relative stock of product
Ions here and abroad whether there are tacit
or direct agreements to limit production
proluction
and much more information of 1 practical
character This information is not now to
bo had The party could thon fight the
McKinley bU and i we win in the elec
tions this information would enable us to
form a tariff bill adapted to the country
that will become law and wo will pass it

PARIS Dec 10 Senator Saint Hilgalre
exminister of foreign affairs said to an
Associated Press correspondent today he
is distinctly opposed to the attempt to
draw France and Russia into an alliance
He can discover no common bonds of union
between tbe most enlightened people of
Europe and a country almost eastern in its
barbarity The prevalent idea in France
is this alliance will enable her to regain her
lost provinces while she will help Russia
to lay hands on Constantinople But
while Russia will not fail to seize every
opportunity for increasing her empire she
would not embroil herself with Europe in
order to please Franco and when satisfied
would repudiate any claims the latter
power might have on her In his opinion
the most natural and profitable alliance for
France would be one with England
Caprlvl Opens the Debate on the Commercial
Treaties
BERLIN Dec 10In the reichstag today
Chancellor von Caprivi opened the debate
on the new commercial treaties making a
strong appeal in favor of their adoption
He dwelt upon tho faot that the present
import nnd export relations would ruin
both employers and employees The meas
ures under discussion were necessary to
preserve Germanys husbandry and com
merce
Continuinl the chancellor said the im
mediate effect of tho treaties upon the
finances of the empire would be a diminu
tion of the revenue of nearly 18000000
marks This was a matter that required
budget consideration Speaking on ino
question of differential treatment of coun
tries not included in the treaties be said
it was needless to speak of Russia The
lamentable l distress in that country would
not be removed for some time and It was
useless to discuss what would be done
afterwards As regards the United States
tho two governments had decided to con
tinue on the basis of the arrangement of
1SS5 whereby the United States received
the most favored nation treatment In
tc naton
connection with the alleged distress in
Germany he said the agriculture of the
country could very well bear without risk
a reduction in the tariff rate
of one and a half marks In
the matter of wine it had been the aim to
compel charp competition against artificial
wines schnapps and socalled French
clarets so as to provide on German soil a
bettor field for Italian wines against those
of France A reduction in the duties on
the necessaries of life was of advantage to
the working people Adverting to the
McKinley law the chancellor said We
wish the countries of Europe to preserve
their independence against America For
this purpose they must unite together
The treaties just concluded will give a sure
guarantee for the future
Herr von Kanitz Conservative opposed
the chancellors policy He regretted the
gegotiatons showed they had only free
trade councillors He looked forward to
the ruin of German agriculturists The I
chancellor responded he had been aided by
some advisers that assisted Prince Bis

bers of the reichstag i voted in favor
and 254 against the treaties

COEBETTS SCALP
Billy Madden is After It with
Peter Maher
He Says tho Californian la a Pantomlma
Boxer He Will Hatch the Irishman
Against any Mania the World
Special to THEHEBALD Examiner Dispatch
NEW YORK Dec 10BIlly Madden who
Is manager of Peter Maher the Irish
heavyweight pugilistic champion ia after
the scalp of Jim
Corbett Ccrbett is a
clever follow said Madden tonight
but
HE 18 A PANTOMIME BOXSR
Ho made a fine newspaper talk this morn
ing and I havo sent my reply Now let ua
hear from him
In Maddens letter he mentions the fact
hat Corbett has said he is anxious to make
a match with Maher that each man has
51000 forfeit on deposit and that Corbott
has said that if the balance of the stake of
55000 is not put down at once ho will claim
the forfeit Then Madden continues Let
us see what are facts of the case Mr Cor
butt has for months been shouting that ha
wanted to fight Charley Mitchell Ho
posted money to make such a match and ho
boldly proclaimed that it was Mitchell or
nobody At that time tbero WBS little Ilk
ihood of Mitchell coming here and ao I
OFFERED TO PUT MAHER AGAINST COBBETT
The latter decided that ho would make such
a match after December 15 if Mitchell
either did not como here or re
fused to fight Now however
that Mitchell is on the ocean
he shows great haste to get Maher to fight
For a man who wanted Mitchells scalp
before taking any other this action of Cor
bott is strange indeed But I will let that
pass 1 am really anxious to have Peter
Maher meet Mitchell and Corbett also but
I deferred to Corbett and agreed to the
date he named so as to give him a chance
at Mitchell As however
HE HAS APPARENTLY CHANGED HIS MIND
I will agree to go on with our match at the
proper timo Now I do not want to have
matters so arranged that when Mitchell
arrives he can rub his bands with glee and
say Oh ah I will fight the winner I
dont want a match made that will prevent
a match with Mitchell for either Corbett
Maher
The main object of both Corbett and
myself in posting the money was
TO GET MITCHELL IK THE KING
If Corbett and Maher are matched Mitchell
will escape If even after such a match
was made Mitchell agreed to meet Corbett
or Mailer no club would give a purse for
Corbett and Maher and the latter would bo
abut out So far as Corbetta claiming the
forfeit I will say that I never paid a for
feit and never failed to go through with a
match and I am not going to begin now I
will make the match with Mr Coy
bett and make tao second and final
deposits on the dates named in
the articles of agreement inclosed I
am sure ho will agree that they are per
fectly fair Moreover I will make this
proposition to Corbott I will give him 50
per cent of the nat proceeds of my enter
tainment at Madison Square gardens De
cember 17 if he will box Maher and prove
he outclasses the Irish champion He has
nothing to do next Thursday night and he
can easily got there If ho does not
PETER MAHER WILL MEET ART MAS IN TH3
WORLD
I have signed the articles of agreement and
all that Corbett needs to do is to affix hia
signature
