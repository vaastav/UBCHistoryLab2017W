Pity tiie President had not said more or
written less in his message to Congress!
True to iris habit of throwing down the
reins, the President in this inspiring mo
ment of our history has nothing to sug
gest. takes no Initiative, strikes the key

a dreary report presenting numerous facts,
and leaves the rest to Congress and to (Jod.

does not give.

The won) imperialism does not occur in
ibis ni'.tb-tiy phiasetl record of an illus
trious year in an administration that will

imperialism in the new American sense is
there, in every line of th' document.
' r-'tii ihe N. w York World rtil-ri] t.
As ;h?* pioclaim<-d object of th' war was
tii secure ihi freedom and independence of
I'uba. the first inquiry will naturally be as
the I'resider s attitude toward th.it
Island, the sovereignty of which has been
surrendered by Spain. Rven the moat eap
t;...is foreign critic must admit that the
I'ri snli-nt stands sqiarely by the resolu
tions -if t'ongress. There is no suggestion '
.if annexation- and yet th re are probably
few intelligent Americans or well-informed
for igners who doubt that Cuba will, by
the desire and free consent of her pie
?nd In foi many years, become a part of
the Tinted States.
I'mm t be f il.'nlelj'liia Titan (imt.).
The nai rative part of the message is
thus its most conspicuous part, and while
it tells nothing that Is unfamiliar and
omits much significant detail, it has never
theless an historic value a.s the official
rec.'-nl of the attitude of this government
t ward Spain before and during and at
the close of the war of 1H!?8. It is not
mure th.iti a bare outline, but it is for the
most part fairly drawn, with simplicity
and dignit}. and it represents the purposes
of tin I'nlted States as we would hav;
them represented to the world.
I'r.'iu tiie I'lilladi lphu North Anierli-nu (rep.V
So far as It relates to the war, the mes
sage is a succinct and Impartial history of
th I'-ise It Is also good history, aiming it
nothing beyond the facts of record and giv
in;,- those facts a force they could not have
merely as facts of record, segregated, ofter
obscured by details, and not conseeutivi ly
presented. The President, with a painstak
ing seldom noted In state pupers, has strip
ped off the husks and given the public the
kernels, and he has done this nlthout any
attempt at tine writing.
From the I'Mlmii-lj'ltia Itei-onl idi-iu.).
A longer or .1 duller message has not been
sent by the President to the Congress ainco
we first had 1'residents and Congresses.
Th. dullness is not in the topics discussed;
it is in the discussion. At no time since the
ending of the civil war has there berti more
stirring event or more commonplace com
ment.
From th*.* Philadelphia Public Ledger liud.).
The President's clear and logical array of
war time incidents that gloriously illusttate
American prowess. American patriotism
and American sacrifice exerted in a conflict
waged for the Independence of another
country with be read with universal inter
est. Without triumphing over the fallen
foe. with appreciative recognition of Ad
miral Cervera's compliment to llobson an 1
his men for their bravery In the sinking of
tlv Merrimac and with restrained patriot
ism in passages where a more exultant note
would not l>e nut of place, the message sets
fei'th, with dignity, one of the brightest
pages of our militant history, and accords
to all our later day military and naval
hi roes, from the highest to the humblest, to
th-- named and to the unnamed, to the Hy
ing and to the dead, their meed of pralso.
Frea? the Philadelphia Inquirer (rep.).
The message as a whole Is wis* acd con
servative, although we cannot agree with
it so far as the Cuban question Is con
cerned. The Spanish islands will be oc
cupied by our troops and will have a mili
tary form of government until a stable
form shall be given them by Congress.
What the President's policies are regarding
them is not yet made public, but that they
will be progressive policies can admit of
no doubt, because he takes the progressive
view of the necessities of the country.
From the Philadelphia Press (rep.).
At the end of a year of momentous
change nnd expansion the President's mes
sage. for the first time in many years, looks
out and not in, and turns the attention
of the nation to the world problems of a
land which has now assumed its place and
share in the conduct of the world's inter
national affairs.
From the Baltimore News (dem.).
The message is in the main historical, but
there are two passages in it that bear upon
questions on which public oirinion is in a
state of special sensitiveness. One is that
relating to the future of Cuba. The Presi
dent's statement on this subject deserves
and will doubtless command universal ap
pioval. The other subject is the currency.
Upon this question, we regret to say, the
President's tone is by no means such as to
satisfy those who appreciate its importance.
From the Baltimore American (rep.).
The President's message is unusually
long, but it contains few direct suggestions,
stating merely fpcts or hypotheses, and
leaving Congress to draw its own infer
ences.
From the Baltimore Sun (dem.).
It will prove a distinct disappointment to
those who expected that it would fully
outline the policy of the administration in
regard to territorial acquisition and other
important issues connected with the war
with Spain.
From ihe Wilmington (Del.) News (rep.)
The message, in its entirety, is a business
like document prepared by a man of busi
n? ss. * * * That the President has a well
con? eivcd policy in mind we fully believe.
Fr? m the New Haven Leader (rep.)
As a whole the message contains much
more of history than of advice, and that
history is of much greater importance than
any of us at present fully realize.
From the. Brooklyn Times (rep.) I
In regard to the relations between the
I'nited States and Cuba the language of
the President is clear and emphatic, and
should reassure those suspicious Cuban
patriots who think they can detect a pur
pose of annexation in the position of the j
American government. * * * These are
strong and manly words, worthy of the |
great republic and consistent with the pur
pose for which, and for which alone, the
war was undertaken. j
1 ihe Brooklyn Eagle find, deiu.)
The mess: go is to be commended precisely I
because of reasons on account of which |
.ithers may withhold commendation from it.
It is moderate, but we think it ought to be. |
It is general, but we are convinced that
that should be its character in eircum- |
stances as they are. It is suggestive rather j
Than prescriptive or mandatory, but pre- |
eisely that tone seems to be required in the
transitional stage <?? unsettled questions,
when light should be waited for. when
dogmatism should be wanting, and when
the best aids <>f reflection, <?f comparison,
of study and of time should be placed at the
servie.- of patriotic purpose and of national
duty.
From the Hartford Times idem.)
\\V ran only < haraeterize as most feebl
and impotent the President's treatment of
the currency question. He does not. even
--%p<-ak a word of commendation of the vig
orous arguments addressed t'? Congress in
the report of his Secretary of the Treasury,
which will be made public tomorrow. The
document as a whole sheds comparatively
little light on public questions and in the
main cannot be of much help in intelligently
guiding public opinion on the momentous
issues now awaiting a decision.
From the Lcwiston (Me.' Journal (rep.)
It is one of the ablest state documents in
the past thirty years and renews the ad
miration in which ? very loyal American
holds the present occupant of the seat of
Washington and Lincoln.
From the Philadelphia Evening Star (rep.)
The President's message is a character
istic document. Mr. McKinley is a man o 1
strong views, but of careful expression.
From the Boston Post (dem.)
Outside the war. the message has not
many salient points. The recommendation
of immediate attention to the matter of
currency reform is somewhat surprising,
when we consider the demoralized condition
of the majority party in Congress on this
question. So, too. is the announcement that
we must establish closely reciprocal trade
with Cuba, followed as it is by recommenda
tions looking to free trade with other coun
tries. The incompatibility of Dinglcyism
with imperialism is beginning to appear.
From the New York Journal of Commerce (Ind.)
The message is a calm and careful re?l< w
of an eventful and indeed a critical year in
our history. During this year the President
has borne himself with great dignity and
firmness. and has commanded the respect
of Europe so far as this could be while th?
I'nited States was pursuing a course which,
on the continent, was generally very un
popular. has resisted tremendous clamor
from political factions, has selected his own
time for action, and the steps he has taken
have added to the power and the prestige
of his country. In the administration of the
war he was to some extent handicapped by
subordinates, but it is not certain that he
could have changed them to advantage at
the moment when their deficiencies were de
veloped. On the whole he has so carried
himself as to enlarge the estimate enter
tained of him by his countrymen, and to
insure him a prominent place among t In
most eminent American statesmen.
From the Boston Advertiser (rep.)
The sect nd annual message of President
McKinley is characterized, like all his state
papers, and indeed all his elaborately pre
I a red utterances on public topics of serious
concern, by marked clearness, precision
and force of language. We will not dwell
upon those features now. It has long been
known far and wide that William McKin
ley is no ordinary master of the art of
verbal expression. The substance of the
message is not in any respect remarkable,
except, perhaps, for what it does not con
tain. This statement is not meant at all
for depreciation. It is by no means always
the most remarkable messages in point of
contents that are the most useful.
From the Boston Globe (ind dem.)
Yes. the message is amiable, is devoid of
malignancy, is a fair piece of reportorial
work and avoids entangling expressions of
opinion. But it will hardly till the bill of
publi" expectation in these anxious, uncer
tain times.
From the Chicago Evening Post (rep.)
The message, long as it is, will repay
careful perusal. It is high-minded and dig
nified.
From the Albany Argus (dem.)
The most careful scrutiny will scarcely
detect in this elaborate document one origi
nal thought or suggestion, or any new in
formation. It is a singularly colorless and
c? mmonplnce document, and may be best
characterized in the one word "hash."
From the New York Mull and Express (rep.)
President McKinley has not only written
the luminous history of a momentous year,
but he has indicated in his message por
tentous events yet to occur in the national
growth.
From the Worcester Spy (rep.)
Caution and reserve are among the most
prominent characteristics of the message.
The President is waiting, and there is
nothing for the people to do but wait, like
wise. The things which they most wanted
to know have been for the most ^)art
omitted, and there was no help for the
omission. Such recommendations as are
made may be heartily approved.
From the Chicago Journal (ind.)
Inaction may be just as wise as action.
It would be impossible for any one not
gifted with omniscience to predict what
form the government of the new posses
sions will take. It is impossible, in the
darkness of present knowledge of them and
of their requirements, even to say in spe
cific terms what form it ought to take. The
President does well to postpone the matter.
From the Providence Journal (Ind.)
The President wastes no words in his
message to the second session of the Fifty
rtftli Congress. * ? ? A little more in the
line of recommendation about the future
government of our island possessions was
generally expected in the message, but
otherwise the document is what was an
tieipatecl, and likQ the war with which it

To a great majority of people the Presi
dent's message will probably he a disap
pointing document, though on further re
flection conservative men will wonder if
tliey had a right to expect anything more
perspicuous.
From the Rochester Iwmiocrat and Chronicle (rep.)
It is cheerful and courageous in tone.
There is not a wail or a groan in it. It
breathes the spirit of encouragement and
leadership, but is not dictatorial. It is
the production of a sound-hearted and
healtliy-minded American, whom the peo
ple of the T'nited States are exceedingly
fortunate to iiuvu as the executive head of
the nation.

From the Ftl-a Fretis lind.)
Because of the course adopted the mes
sage is more than usually devoid of origi
nal suggestion and hence cannot become

morable state document.

The man who reads it can but wonder
and lie thankful that the presidency is
sought after. The burden of care and re
sponsibility that <s suggested by this mes
sage is enough to break a strong man.
From the Buffalo Commercial (rep.)
The President's account of his steward
ship during such a. year is necessarily ex
tended, but its great length is justified by
its surpassing interest as an historical nar
rative.
From the Richmond Times (dem.)
The President wisely refrains from mak
ing reference to the recent race troubles in
the south.
From tiie Richmond l'isputch idem.)
The Dispatch is not in sympathy with the
policy which this message outlines, but we
have no fault to find with the leisurely
method the President has adopted of bring
ing that policy before the country. He
gi\es himself plenty of time to feel the
pulse of Congress and to gauge public
opinion before committing himself as to
important details. But all the same, he
is the chief of the expansionists, notwith
standing the fact that it was only a few
months ago when he declared that "forcible
acquisition Is criminal aggression."
From the Cincinnati Tlmest-Star pop.)
The message will lire among the impor
tant historical documents ,of this govern
ment as a succinct history of the war with
Spain and the new duties imposed upon the
nation by that war. rather than as a guide
for future legislations It/ is, moreover, a
sturdy vindication of the high motives that
forced this nation to its recent unpleasant
surgical operations upon Spain.
From the Cincinnati Commercial-Tribune (rep.)
Comprehensive in scope, able in composi
tion and direct in detail, the message Is at
once a state paper of exceeding Interest
and a historical resume of Incalculable val
ue. As tho chief executive's recital of a
memorable year's momentous happenings,
it possesses for the (Mibllo an importance
singular to itself. It tells nothing that is
news to the people, but the story told by
no other could carry the weight and impor
tance of highest official utterancs.
Slake Appropriate Present*.
There is no more appropriate present for
a man or woman than a nice pair of kid
gloves. They always come In, and women
declare they can never have too many
pairs. There are gloves for morning, after
noon and evening wear, driving gloves and
warm winter gloves. As in every other
business a firm that makes a specialty of
any one thing is certain to lead the trade.
The Louvre Glove Company of 919 F street
northwest deals In gloves exclusively, and
everything In that line may be found* with
in its spacious stores. All of the latest
colors and lengths, for both men and wo
men, are on hand, and the assortment Is
greater, It Is said, than in any other store
