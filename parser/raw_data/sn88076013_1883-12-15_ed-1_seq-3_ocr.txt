A Scientific Victory. 3
From Longman's Magazine.
It is interesting to note the wondrous
cban that has taken place, in the pop
ular estimate of the Darwinian theory.
It has been well said that a new theory
has often to run through three different
phases. In the first place, every one
exclaims that the theory is not tiue
then it is urged that the theory is con
trary to religion and, lastly, that every
body knew it long ago. The great doc
trine of datu al selection promulgated
by Darwin has run through these
courses. At its publication it vas re
ceived with an outburst of incredulity
among the unthinking part of the com
munity. Every one recollects the de
nunciations it received and the ridicule
which ttie new doctrine to encoun
ter. But the theory of Da win has sur
vived that stage. It has also survived
the attacks of those who denouncoUtie
theory as contrary to religion. The
truth inherent in the principles of Dar
win has quietly brushed aside sucti op
position, and now we hear but little of
it. The funeral of Darwin at Westmin
ster Abbey must be regarded as mark
ing a momentous epoch in the history
of thought. That, the great doctrine
would one dav be accepted was a nec
essary truth, but I do not think that
any one who recollects the publication
of the "Origin of Species" could then
have anticipated the enormous change
in educated opinion which the next
quarter of a cenlurv was to disclose.
JStill.less likely would it have seemed
that the whole nation would have so
far acknonieeged Darwin that with one
accord they demanded that his remains
should be interred in the national mau
soleum.
The Princess Beatrice is the favorite
child of Queen Victoria, and many say
that she is, in fact, the real Queen of
England, as lier mother delegatesa great
deal of authority to her.
ABOUT THE STOMACH.
We dare say three-fourths ot the diseases
that prevail in the human family are directly
or indirectly induced by some derangement
of the stomach. The most serious ailments
have their urigin there. With dyspepsia the
food passes indigested through the lacteal
vessels and many particles of deleterous mat
ter are carried into the blood and gain lodg
ment often in the lungs and oi.her^great cec
ters of vitality. Hence dyspepsia favors the
occurrence of consumption in persons at all
predisposed to it. I* is also the primary
source of scroiula and other diseases of the
blood and skin.
The person who lias a pig-pen appetite one
day and can eat little or nothing ne next has
dyspepsia. The person who feels a heaviness
at the stomach after eating, accompanied
with a gulpmg-up of wind and sour particles
of food, bas dyspepsia. Besides these symp
toms are bad taste in tbe mouth, pain in the
chest, shortness ol breath, palpitation, head
ache, fiddiness, coldness of extremities, Ian.
gaor, sleeplessness and despondency.
fn prescribing Burdock Blood Bitters as a
cure lar dyspepaia we desire the patient to eat
regularly a reasonable quantity of goad,plain
food (not too hot or too cold) and to use very
sparingly of tobacco (if addicte 1 to that hab
it,) which is apt to exhaust the organs of sal
ivutton. Dyspepsia is a disease of tbe mucous
membrane lining the stomach. If the patient
will trent this mucous membrane of the stom
ach with any sort of decency, ceasing to ag
gravate its sensitive surface witb indigestible
matter, we guarantee the use of Burdock
Blood Bitters will cure him. That's all we
•tsk. Give the stomach a fair chance, Bur
dock Blood Bitters will do the rest. Thous.
