THE DEMOCRAT.

GKOUOK CHAW FORD, EDITOR.
THURSDAY. DECEMBER , 1807.
The following in from the Waukesha
Dispatch, whose editor, Mr. A. F.
Warden, up to the time of the Chica
go convention was an ardent support
er of the gold standard. Coming, aa
it does, from a recent convert to the
silver cause, Its tone Is, to say the
least, not over modest:
"The Mineral Point Democrat is
far too sanguine in imagining that
the democracy will humiliate itself for
the sake of securing the return of the
apostates who so shamelessly deserted
the party a year ago. Nothing of the
kind will ever happen. The game is
not worth the powder, and The Dcrn
crat is merely making a sorry spec
tacle of itself, by cuddling the de
lusion. When the apostates have had
enough of McKinley ism, and they are
now chafing a good deal under the
yoke, they are welcome to return, but
no veal spread awaits their corning.
Meanwhile the party will go right on
attending to business at the old stand
and meeting lire issues as they arise,
and true and loyal democrats will
continue to subordinate their individ
ual opinions to the assembled wisdom
and regularly declared policy of the
party, as others now wish they had in
the past. However, the weary crowd
now thumping at the hack door should
arouse sympathy and enkindle char
ity.”
If to have refused to endorse Thu
Chicago platform entitles one to he
called an apostate, then The lowa
County Democrat pleads guilty to Hfo
soft Impeachment. If to have refused
to support for oillcc those who if elect
ed would aid In carrying out the prin
ciples of repudiation enunciated in
that platform, was to become a traitor
to democracy, then the editors of
The Democrat, with hundreds of
thousands yea, more than a million
of other heretofore true and loyal
democrats, were guilty of treason;
and our recently converted friend Mr.
Warden Is welcome to make the most
of It. Hut he need not lay the Matter
ing unction to Ids soul that gold dem
ocrats In great numbers are seeking
to return to the regular democratic or
ganization so long as the declarations
of the Chicago platform are permitted
to stand or there is fear .of their re
affirmation. The protest of gold dem
ocrats was positive, open, and above
board. "This thing was not done in
a corner." The purpose of gold dem
ocrats whether their votes were cast
for I’ahner or for McKinley was the
same, namely: to rebuke ami repu
diate the leaders who, in national
convention, had repudiated the prin
ciples of democracy ami declared for
n, Itnanclal policy out of harmony
with the teachings of the democratic
fathers, the experience of ages, and
the enacted wisdom of all civilized
countries. If we listen to some of the
regulars, the gold democrats arc few
In number and their InlUiencc does not
amount to much Hut when it comes to
the battle and there arc lliianelal her
esies to lilt, they materialize very fast,
and as It lias boon in the past, so will
it he in future. And we desire to state
for llro. Warden's Information and
admonition, that instead of ” thump
ing on the hack door" for admission
to the regular democratic organiza
tion, should any future occasion de
mand their services, they will tie in
the open, with their powder still dry.
For ourselves; we niusl confess, that
we know nothing of subordlnatlug in
dividual opinions to the assembled
wisdom and regularly declared policy
of a party when It denies or changes
the fundamentals of its faith. If it is
treason fora gold democrat to protest,
why such rejoicing over silver republi
cans who protested against the assem
bled wisdom and declared policy of
their party? And why was the last
Wisconsin Democratic slate conven
tion adjourned in their honor, and an
alliance formed with men who had re
fused to Unis subordinate their indi
vidual opinions? The naked truth is,
that far too many democrats in the
last campaign followed the regular
organization ami subordinated their
individual opinions because as many
of them declared they believed that
■free silver would prove a winner.
They overlooked the abandonment of
the tariff issue, and condoned the of
fences of those democrats who hi con
gress made the carrying out of dem
ocratic pledges an Impossibility. They
afterwards sat silent when democratic
ami populist campaigners, in their in
temperate zeal, denounced as Shy lucks
their friends and neighbors who by
thrift had acquired wealth or Ihnuudal
standing. They applied all matuier
of epithets to Democrats who refused
to join them: and, as Warden and
many other regular democrats thought
and said, they were going to carry
Wisconsin with a whoop. Hut the
whoop never came. It is the next
time they are surely going to win.
" Hope springs eternal In the human tirousC
Man never Is. tint always to tie blest."
And perhaps it is just as well for
Warden to get what bliss |u> can hy
abusing gold democrats, for tint eon
‘summatlon of Ids hopes will never
come through the triumph of the prin
ciples of the Chicago platform.
IOWA COUNTY DEMOCRAT: MINERAL POINT, WIS., DECEMBER 9, 1897.
President McKinley has disappoint
ed those who have said that he was at
a disagreement with his gold-standard,
sound-money Secretary of the Treas
ury, In his annual message, which
was read to Congress on Monday, the
President fairly meets the paramount
Issue in American politics by strongly
urging the right kind of currency re
form, including the practical retire
ment of the treasury notes. In view of
the strong opposition in the senate, it
is hardly possible that ids recommen
dations will be enacted into law: but
the message places the administration
before tljc country as favoring the
breaking of the endless chain hy
which the treasury may be depleted of
gold, _________
During the last presidential cam
paign a class of republican newspa
pers, of extreme high tariff and free
silver proclivities, were much given to
saying that the currency laws were all
rigid, hut that the Cleveland adminis
tration and the Wilson tariff law wore
altogether responsible for the financial
depression then prevailing. This
sort of talk tempted many a sound
money Democrat to so far forget
his political duty as to go and join
the many weaponed army which
marched under the banners of Hryan
and Sewell and Hryan and Watson.
Hut the blind partisans who tried to
place all the responsibility for the
hard times upon the attempt to re
duce high tariff taxation have their
answer full and complete in President
McKinley's message to Congress. It
ought to put them to shame.

Many visitors were present from the
surrounding towns, and all expressed
themselves delighted with the hall, and
the generous hospitality of the order.
The dance at city hall was well at
tended.
Madison Democrat: “If the gentle
man who frequently spits tobtieeo juice
on my showcase will call at my gallery
ife can have Ids picture taken for noth
ing," is the very polite way In which
a Stoughton photographer calls atten
tion to the presence In his community
of an especially vulgar coward. Many
merchants and professional men, no
less than all ladles ami this indignant
photographer, have a common feeling
of abhorrence toward those foul crea
tures whoso disgusting saliva be
smears the sidewalks, stains store
and office Moors and pollutes particu
larly the dark corners of public or
business rooms. The suggestion of
consideration for others that is found
in the effort to project the nauseating
spittle into obscure places lessens inn
very slight degree the nasty abomina
tion of n most offensive habit.
Wadding Nuptials of Miss Carl Hitch
ens and Mr. William Steiger.
Under the above heading the Oregon
Daily Statesman, published at Salem,
thus records the marriage of Miss
Carl y lichens, sister of Mrs. C. C.
Goldsworthy, of this city:
Thanksgiving day, 18!)7, will be a
memorable and happy date In the
home of Mrs. Jane Hitchens, at No.
141) Union street, in this city, by rea
son of the joyful event that trjftisplred
there in the early evening, namely the
pretty home wedding in which her ac
complished and popular’ daughter,
Miss Carl Hitchens, was united to
Mr. William Staiger, the well-known
marble merchant and estimable citi
zen of this city.
The affair was characterized hy an
elegant simplicity and was witnessed
only hy the immediate families of the
happy principles and a few chosen
friends of both.
The front parlor was prettily deco
rated with snowy chrysanthemums
massed against the burnished green
of ivy beneath a graceful festoon of
which the ceremony was performed.
Rev. W. C. Kanlnei, D. D., pastor
of the First Congregational church
officiated with the impressive ritual of
that church, after which the assembled
guests extended to Mr. and Mrs. Slai
ger the congratulations and good
wisnes horn of devoted friendship and
loving kinship, and then the wedding
party adjourned to the (lining room
and discussed the dainties of a lovely
wedding supper seasoning the repast
with the largess of mirth incident to
such occasions.
Mr. and Mrs. Staiger were the re
cipients of some beautiful gifts in sil
ver and fragile China, one piece of
which was peculiarly grateful to the
charming bride, an octagonal silver
howl that came from her class of
young people in the Sunday school of

Something to Know.
It may be worth something to know
that tlie very l>est medicine for restor
ing the tired out nervous system to a
healthy vigor is Electric Hitters
This medicine is purely vegetable,
acts by giving tone to the nerve cen
tres in the stomach, gently stimulates
the Liver and Kidneys, and aids'
these organs in throwing off irapuri-j
ties in the blood. Electric Bitters im
proves the appetite, aids the digestion
and is pronounced by those who have''
tried it as the very best blood purifier i
and nerve tonic. Sold for ,'iOc and

Working the Old Mines.
Grant County Herald.
Forty years ago the mining district
south of Lancaster known as Pigeon
Diggings produced considerable lead.
It is a well know* fact that in this part
of the country the water is receding
from the surface of the earth; whether
permanently is a question, neverthe
less it is receding. In Pigeon Diggings
within the last 12 years the water has
gone down ten to fifteen feet, and old
shafts that were abandoned at a
time when they were yielding large
quantities of lead ore can now be
sunk ten to fifteen feet deeper.
Montgomery Miller of Lancaster is
now slnkihg a discovered shaft in the
spot where Flagg’s blacksmith shop
stood and is preparing to work out
old shafts that were abandoned by
Mr. B'lagg, with every indication of
reaping a rich reward.
Also Messrs. Geo. B. Hyde and
-Tomas McDonald are now working
out the old shaft dug by Win. Foster
near the Belscamper place in Pigeon
It is believed by those well versed in
mining that there is now plenty of
paying work in Pigeon Diggings for
idle men to do. There seems to be a
degree of certainty about digging the
old rich holes deeper that is lacking
in sinking entirely new shafts.
A Tennessee lady, Mrs. J. W.
Towle, of Philadelphia. Tenn., has
been using Chamberlain’s Cough Re
edy for her baby, who is subject to
croup, and says of it: “I find it just
as good as you claim it to be. Since
I’ve had your Cough Remedy, baby
has been threatened with croup ever so
many times, but I would give him a
dose of the Remedy and it prevented
his having it every time.” Hundreds
of mother say the same. Sold by
