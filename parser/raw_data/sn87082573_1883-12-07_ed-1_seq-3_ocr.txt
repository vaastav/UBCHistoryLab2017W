like circumstances, give place to such
officer as congress may by law appoint to
act as president. 1 need not set forth the
numerous and interesting inquiries which
are suggested by these words of the con
stitution. They were fully stated in my
first communication to congress, and have
since been the subject of frequent delib
erations in that body, it is greatly to be
hoped that these m imentous questions will
find speedy solution, lest an emergency
may arise when longor delay will he im
possible, and any determination, albeit the
wisest, may furnish cause for anxiety and
alarm.
THE VKTO row KB.
For the reasons fully stated in tny last
annual message, I repeat my recommenda
tion that congress propose an amendment
to that provision of the constitution which
prescribed the formalities tor the enact
ment ot laws whereby, in respect to bills
for the appropriation of public money,
the executive may be enabled, while giv
ing his approval to particular items, to
nterpose his veto as to such others as do
not commend themselves to his judgment
.CJVlL RIGHTS.
The fourteenth amendment to the con
stitution confers the rights of citizenship
upon all persons born or naturalized in the
United States and subject to tho jurisdic
tion thereof. It was the special purpose
of this amendment to Insure to members
of the colored race the full enjoyment of
civil and political rights. Certain statutory
provisions intended to secure the enforce
ment ot those rights have been recently
declared unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court. Any legislation whereby con
gress may lawfully supplement the guaran
tee whlcn the constitution affords for the
equal enjoyment by all the citizens of the
United States of every right, nrivilese and
immunity of citizenship, will receive my
unhesitating approval.

-Mr. Eugene E. Ellis has voiced sn in
chnation to start the publication of a news
paper in this city, though as yet there is
nothing positive about it. ITo doubt Mr.
Ellis, if he ventures into the newspaper
arena here, will seek to supply the demand
for a "truly good Republican" journal,
which demand has of late manifested itself
just a little through the Republican press
in othor parts of this district. The Ga
zette, as the "truly good Republican" press
in other parts of the district said, is not
loyal to the grand old party of all iniqui
ties, since it wilfully forsook the train of
"the powers that be," and the loyal press
has expressed surprise that Cairo should be
without a Republican paper of the stalwart
stripe. Mr. Ellis paper if it materializes
will also doubtless seek to meet wants
coming from other quarters, which are not
to fully met by the existing papers here as
is desired. There is room for a paper of this
kind here, and Mr. Ellis is perhaps better
able to start and. conduct it than most
others, as he has already much ot the mate
rial needed in such a project, is posted in
the mysteries ot its uses and has abundant
good sense to make the paper readable and
the enterprise successful. Let's have the
paper.
