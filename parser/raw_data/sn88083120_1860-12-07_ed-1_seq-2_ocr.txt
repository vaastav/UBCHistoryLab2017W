its gud work is known. The money
wanted by the Association is limited,

The telegraph eosveys a com
plte synfopesi of te President's
message, which appears elsewhere
in to-days paper, s It may be found
in any of the New Orleans journals
of the 4th inst. That relating to
foreign affairs, is omitted, because,
"there's nothing abroad so strange,
as things at home." Temperate
people, meust entertain a feeling of
respect for the opinion of the Sage
of Wheatland now, how much so5
ever they may feel disposed to find
fault with separate pages of his
past eventful history, which is now
approaehing the flair; where an
cient craftsmen of the profession of
Faust and Sheffer, were in the ha
itof placing thigh bones and a dead
man's head. Significant was the
language of the Little Giant, when,
pending the canvass, he made use
of some such language as this
"I am a young man, and not ready
to die, yet." Two years hence even
people who read the papers, if they
have not forgotten the Sage of
Wheatland, they may not be able
to call the name of the eighteenth
President of the Nation. As before
said, we have a respeot for the pri
vate opinion of the distinguished
citisen of Pennsylvania now, apart
from the honorable place, from
which he speaks for the last time,
in an opening message. We like
him because he is going out of of
fice, without the remotest prospect
of ever returning. We like him be
cause all his sworn political friends
have not only left him, but are even
now hunting about, for new terms
of execration to heap on his frosted
head. Like the friends of comnmon
people who have a limit.lI sphere
and limited means of influence; the
friends or Mr. Buchanan, true to
their lnstincts have forsaken him.
We even have a certain amount of
sympathy for his enemies here in
Louisiana, because they cannot
shout for the ascending star of the
Nineteenth President, as they would
like to do, and cannot get their
own consent to hold office under
the new administration, though
they may be induced to hold over a
has been intimated. To this end
we are glad to learn, a negotiation
is even now pending, which should
it be coneamated, will relieve the
presure of the money market in
the Sugar Bowl State, and allow
the talk on change, to go on as
usual. Considering the moral sta
tun of the party (South as well as
North) with which Mr. Bachanao,
has had to deal, we conceive now,
that he has made a most excellent
President. We are obliged to him
for guarding the Crib itself altho'
it is painless. But this is neither
here nor there-read what he says
on National Affairs-it speaks for
itself. His language is that of a
statesman, who feels that he has
nothing to loose by expressing his
bonest opinion. As he very proper
ly says: Nobody is to suffer for
8outh Carolina's madness, if not
folly; more than South Carolina
herself. He does not, in the pres
ent state of affair, recommend
ooercion for this wayward, child of
the Republic, satisfied as he is, that
she will feel, if bshe cannot in the
blindnes of her madness see the
evilof her way. He is agreed as
we all are, that the day of settle
ment has come, when the people of
all sections shall learn that the
Constitution and the laws must be
enforced as well in Louisiana when
she essays to reopen the slave trade
through her Legislature; as in the
State of Massachusetts, with her
personal liberty bills. All this can
be done, only, with the strength of
the Federal Union. Even Mr. Lin
coin himself-who cannot be in
sensible to the tact, that he has
been elected by a sectional party
if he is the honest man mrepresented
by his friends, most admit, that the
day for settlement is at hand, when
the question which comes out of
Africa must be disposed of finally,
and beyond the peradventure of
any reurrection. All this can be,
and will be dons pesoeably-within
the Usion, and to the satidsfaction
of all its parts.
RESIDEMNT'S NEISAGSE
WaIssmiasor, Dec. 4.-The following
iS synopsis of the President's meseege,
read to-day in the Senate of the United
states:
The President, in relation to secession,
recommends: What in the meantime is
the reepeesibility and true position of the
Executive? IIe is bound by solemn oaths
before Uodi awd the country to take care
that the laws be faithfully executed, and
from this oblitgation he oannot be absolv
ed by any human power. But what if
the performance of this duty, in whole or
in part, has been rendered impracticable
by events over whioh he could have eser
cised as eontrol? Sush, at the present
moment, is the case throughout the State
of South Carolina, so far as the laws of
the United States to secure the adminis
tration ofjustlce by means of the Federal
Judicary are concerned. All the Federal
offihoers within its limits, through whose
agency alone those laws can be carried
late sezetion, have already roelgned.
We no longer have a District Judge, a
DistrietAttorney or a Marshal in South
Carollina. In fact, the whole maehinery
of the Federal Government, neoessary for
the distribution of remedial ustice among
the people, has been demolished, and it
would be dfficult, if not impossible, to re
place it.
The only sets of Congress bearing upon
this subject are those of the 28th Februa
ry, 171f5, and Sd March, 1807. These
authorize the President, after he shall
have ascertained that the Marshal, with
hispou. contaltua is unable to execute ci
vil or criminal process i sany particular
case. to alil forth and employ the Army
and Navy of the United States to aid him
in performanoe this service;: having rst,
by proclamation, commanded the insurg
ents to disperse and peaceably retire to
their respective abodes within a limited
time.
This duty cannot, by possibility, be
performed in a state where no judicial au
thority exists to issue process, and where,
even if there were such an officer, the eq
tire population woull constitute one solid
combination to resist him. In the mean
time, in regard to the property of the Un
ited States, in South Carolina, this has
been purchased for a fair equivalent, by
the consent of the State, for the erection
of forts, arsenals magasines, etc., etc.,
and over these the authority to exercise
Executive Legislature has been expressly
granted by the Constitution to Congress.
It is not believed that any attempt will
be made to expell the United States from
this property by force, but, if in this, I
should prove to he mistaken, the officers
in command of the forts have received or
ders to act entilely upon the defensive in
such an emergency.
The responsibility for consequences
would rightfully rest upon the head of
the assailants. Apart from the cxecution
of the laws, so far as this may be practi
cable, the Exeoutive has no authority to
decide what be the relation between the
Federal Government and South Carolina.
liHe has been inveted with no such discre
tion-he poseesse no power to change
the relations heretofore existing between
them, much less to acknowledged the in
dependence of that State.
This would be to invest a mere execu.
tive officer with the power of recognising
the dissolution of the Confederacy exist
ing among our thirty-three sovereign
States.
It bears no resemblanee to the recogni.
tion of a foreign de facto Government, in
volving no such responsibility.
Any attempt to do this would, on his
part, be a naked act of uneurpatio n; it is
therefore my duty to submit to Congress
the whole question in all its bearings.
The course of events is no rapidly hasten
lug forward that the emergency may soon
arise when you may he called upon to de
cide the momentous question, whethea
you possess the power. by force of arms,
to compel a State to remain in the Union.
I should feel myself recreant to my du
ty were I not to expres an opinion on this
important subject.
The question, fairly stated, is: aslu the
Constitution delegated to Congress the
power to coerce a State into submission
which intends to withdraw, or has so
tually withdrawn, from the Confederacy
If answered in the affirmative, it must be
oa the prineiple that the power has been
conferred upon Congress to deelare and
make war against a State.
After much serious reflection, I have
tarrived at the conclusion that no such
power has been delegatesd to Congres, or
to any other department of the Govern
ment. It is manumet, pion inspection of
the Constitution, that this is not among
the specsde or enumerated powers to Co
gress and it is equally apparent that its
oexerci is not noesawry and proper for
earring into execution any one of these
powers. o far from this power having
been deslegated to Congrees,lt wasexprem
ly refused by the Convention which form
ed the Constitutioo.
It appears from theproeeodiol of that
body, that on the 2la day of may, 1787,
the clren anthorising the execution of the
force of the whole country against a do
lioquont Sgate came up for consideration.
Mr. Madison opposed it in a brief but
powerful speeb, from which I shallex
extroact but a single osentence.,
He observed the us of force against a
State would look more like a doclaraties
of war than an infliction of punishment,
and would probably be considered by the
party attacked as a dissolution of all pre
vinous compacts by which they might be
bound.
Upon his motion the clause was most
unanimously postponed, and ws never, I
believe again presented. Soon afterwasrds,
on the 8th day of June, A.D., 178t,
when inlodentally adverting to the sub
ject, bhe said, that any Government for the
United 8tate, formed on the suppoe(d
p~rotbility of udnr fore against the
C uastitalonal prooeedings of the States,
weaid poeeve s visionary and fhllioue as
the goverament of Congres, evidently
medling the existing Cqngress tof the old
Coalsderaion. Without desending to par
tiealarulse, it would sfely be asserted that
the power to make war against a State is
at varieanse with the whole spirit and in
tent of the Constitution.
Suppose suh a war would rsult eonse
quent upon the action of a State, how are
we to govern it afterwards 8 Shall we
hold it s a province and govern it by de
potic power,
In the nature of thins we eald not by
phssel force eatrol the will of the peo
pie so far as to compel them to elect Bea
ters or Representatives to Congress, or to
perform all the other duties dependlng
upon their own volition, sad required
from the free citieasn of a free State, as a
Conatitutional member of the Confedermey.
But. If we were possesed of thie power,
would it be wise to exerete it aider the
elistinug olemestances Theobjlee would
de btlea be t, preserve the Unfoe.
War would not only present the most
eaectnal means of destroying it, but would
banish all hope of its peaceaslle reconstruc
tlon; besides, in the fraternal confliot, a
content of blood or treasure would be ex
penled, rendering future reconciliation
between the States impeealble.
in tlhe meantime, who can foretell what
would be the sufferings or privations of
the people during the existetce of such a
war. lnt I may be pernmitted eolemnly
to invoke my countrymen to passe and
deliberate before they determine to destoy
this, the grandest temple which has ever
been dediated to human freedom since
the worli began.
It has been consecrated by the bloaod of
her fathers, by the glories of the past, and
by the hopes of future. The Union has
already made uo the most prosperous, and,
ere long, will, if preerved, render us the
most powerful nation on the face of the
earth. In every foreign region of the globe
the title of American citisen is held in the
highest respect, and when pronounced In
a foreign land. It causes the hearts of her
countrymen to swell with honest pride.
surely, when we reach the brinko of the
yawning abyss, we shall rescol with hor
ror from the leastlatsl plunge.
1By such a dread eatastrophe the hopes
of the friends of freedom, throughout the
world, would be destroyed, stld a long
night of leaden despotism will enshroud
the nations.
Our example for more than eighty years
would not only be lost, but it would be
quoted as a conclusive proof that man is
unfit for elf-government.
It is not every wrong-nay, It is not ev
ery grievous wrong which can justify a re
sort to such a fearful alternative. This
ought to be the last desperate remedy of a
despairing people, alter every other bnn
stitutional meaun of conlliatIon has been
exhausted. We should reflect that nnder
this free government there is an incessant
ebb and how in public opinion.
The slavery question, like everythlnl
human, will have its day. I firmly believe
it has already reached and peassed the cul
minating point; but if, In the midst of
the excititement the Union shall perish,
the evil may become irreparable.
Congress can contribute much to avoid
It by proposing and recommending to the
leglilatture of the several Itates the rem
edy for existing evils, which the Constitu
tion has itself provided for its own pre
esrvation.
This has been tried at different critical
periods of our history, and always with
eminent success. It is to be found In the
fifth article, providing for its own amend
nimnt. Under this article, amendments
have been proposed by two-thirds of both
Houses of Conagress and have been ratified
by the Legislatures of three-fourths of tlhe
several States, and hbve consequently le
come parts of the Conetitution. To this
process the country is indebted for the
clause prohibiting Congress from passing
any laws respecting an establishment of
religion or abridging the fr,.e-elm ofspeech,
or of the powers, or of the right of peti
tion.
To this we are also indebted for the
rights which secure the people against any
abiuse of power by the Federal government.
Such were the apprehensone justly enter
tained by the friends of 8tate Rights at
that teriod, as to have rendered iteatreme
ly doubtlul whether the Constitution could
have long survived without these amend
ments. Agaln the Constitution was amend
ed by the ame process after the election
of I resident Jefferson, by the lHonse of
Representatives, in the month of Februa
ry A. U1.. 1803. This amendment was
rendered necessary to prevent the re-ocaur
rence ,of the dangers which had seriously
threatened the existenee of the Govern
ment during the pendency of that elec
tion.
The section for iteown amendment was
intended to secure the amicable adjust
ment of conflicting constitutional ques
tions like the present, which might aries
between the Government of the States and
of the United States. This appears from
contemporaneous history. In this con
nection I shall merely eall attention to a
few sentences Is Mr. Madison's justly cel
ebrated report in 17UP to the Legislature
of Virginia. In this he ably and conclu
sively defended the resolutions of the pre
ceding Legislature against the strictures
of several other State Legislatures.
These were mainly founded upon the
protest of the Virginia Legislature against
the Alien and Sedition acts, as palpable or
alarming infractions of the Constitution.
In pointing out the peaceful and Consti
tutional remedies he referred to none oth
er to which the States were authorlsed to
resort on such oecasions. lie concludes by
saying that the Loegislatures of the statee
might have made direct representation to
Congress with a view to obtain a rescind
ing of the two offensive acts, or they might
have represented to their respective Sei
tors in Confgres their wish that two-thirds
thereof would have proposed an exPlaa
tory amendment to the Coanstitutson, or
two-thirds of themselves, if such had been
their option, might, by an application to
Congress, have obtained a Convention for
the same objeto. This is the very course
which I earnestly recommend in order to
obtain an explanatory amendment of the
Constitution on the subject of slavery.
This might originate with Congres or
with the state Legslatres, uas may be
doemed mot advisble to attain the object.
The ezplanatory ameadment might be
conaaaed to the Stnal settlement of the true
constrnction of the Coonstitution on thruee
. ru, 'n e: rems recornition of the rights
of property an slaves n the 8tates which
now exist or may hereinafter exist.
Beood, The duty of protecting this right
in all the common Territories, throughout
the territorial existence, aid until they
shall be admitted as 8tatesinto the Union,
with or without slavery, as their Conastiu
tions may prescribe.
TAird. A like recognition of the right of
the muster to have his dlave who bhas e-.
eaped from one 8tate to another restored

ty of the lugftive l8ave Law, enacted for
this parose, together with a declaration
that all State laws impeinnr or defesting
this right are violations of the Constitu- I
Lton, and are conseqaently ull and vod. I
It may be objected that thiLs oonatruction
of the Constitution has already been aes
ied by the Supreme Court of the United
States, and what more ought to be re
quired f
SThe answer is that a lcgeo portion of
the people of the United States still con
test the correetnes of this decision, and
never will reme from agitation, or admit
its binding force, until clearly established
by the people of the several States in their
sovereign charactr.
Sech an explaatory amendment would,
it is believed, forever terminate the exist
ing diseeandoes, and restore pee and har

The President enumerates the evil reo

that the period has not a, rived whleh will

guilty of a deliberate, palpable and dan

The hbare enumeration of three provi"

to speak of other States, which may place
themselves in asimilar attitude. (Congrees,
