The Baltimore News announces that
commencing next Sunday the publics
lion of a Sunday evening edition of
the News will begin. According to an
nouncement it will be strictly a news
paper—nqt a feature paper, and the price
will be one cent, like the other issues, of
the paper. This is a decided departure
for the News, as since the foundation of
the paper there has Aver been a Sunday
issue of it.
President Roosevelt apparently re
alizing that Congress does not intend to
do much more than collect salaries during
the present session, has started out to keep
the members supplied with reading mat
ter, and thereby occupy their attentibn in
a measure. Two- special messages have
already been sent to them, in addition to
the annual message. One of the special
messages concerns the dismissal of the
negro soldiers, and the other is in relation
to the Panama canal scandal.
\ At the Rivers and Harbors Congress,
in session at Washington last week, sen
timent in favor of the issuance of Govern
ment bonds for a comprehensive improve
ment of the rivers, harbors and canals of
the country, to the end that this nation
shall have the greatest system of water
ways in the world, gained headway. The
scheme contemplates the issuance of
ssop, 000,000 worth of Federal bonds for
internal watercourses, to be distributed
over a ten year period, or $50,000,000
annually, and enthusiastic indorsement
was given to the proposition.
The Delaware State Grange in annual
session at Dover last week put itself on
record on the temperance question, not
being content alone with the passage of
a resolution favoring Local Option, and
submitting reports showing that crime
and arrests have fallen off in Kent and
Sussex counties since Local Option has
become operative there, and that condi
tions have greatly improved, but showed
their interest in furthering the cause by
adopting resolntions relative to the ship
ment of liquor from “wet” into "dry”
' districts, and demanding that the Legis
lature pass a law prohibiting this, as well
as the printing of liqnor advertisements
iu papers in dry districts.
Despite the fact they
Presidential wrath, and running the risk
of being elected to the Ananias Club,
some of the members of Congress have
had the hardihood to demand an investi
gation of the Panama canal scandal,
growing out of the charges that the pur
chase of the canal from the French com
pany was engineered by the President’s
Cabinet advisers; that "the money was
paid not to the French government, as
alleged, but tb J. P. Morgan & Co., and
that J 15.000.000 of the $40,000,000 was
paid to the stockholders of a New Jersey
syndicate, and $5,000,000 more is still
lying in the treasury of this New Jersey
corporation; and that $10,000,000 more
was paid by the United States to foster
the revolution that took the strip of land
in the canal zone away from Columbia.
The charges have had the effect of call
ing forth a special message from the
President, which fairly bristles with
strong language and dismisses the whole
matter as a tissue of falsehood. The
I President goes after ihe New -York World
and its proprietor, laying the blame of
starting the whole agitiation there, and
declaring Joseph Pulitzer, the proprietor
is a libeler and villifier and should be
brought to iustice. If the reports of the
public press are to be credited the message
wss received by Congress more in the
nature of a colossal joke than any degree
of seriousness.
The total popular vote of the Presi
dential candidates at the last national
election, shows the following votes cast:
Taft, Republican; 7,637,676; Bryan, Dem
ocrat, 6,393,182; Debs, Socialist, 448,453;
Cbafin, Prohibitionist, 241,252; Hisgen,
Independence, 83,186; Watson, Populist,
33,871; Gilhaus, Socialist Labor, 15,421.
Total for all candidates, 14,852,239
This grand total exceeds by 1,341,531
the total number of votes cast iu the
Presidential election of 1904. when the
grand total was 13.510,708.
Compared with that election, the candi
dates of the Repub’ican, Democratic aud
Socialist parties increased their vote this
5 ear. The reverse is true of the candi
dates of the Prohibition, Populist and
Socialist Labor parties. The Indepen- 1
dence party did not figure in jbe contest'
of four years ago.
The greatest difference in a party vote '
is shown in an increase for Bryan of
1,315,211 over the total vote cast in
1904 for Alton B. Parker, the Democratic
candidate. Taft received 14,190 votes
more than were polled' for President
Roosevelt in 1904, and Debs ran 45,368
ahead of bis predecessor on the Socialist
ticket.
WASHINGTON LETTER. -
WitlT both houses of Congress in ses
sion and both the President and the
President elect in the city, with the ad
dition of three numerously attended im
portant conventions, discussing water
ways, forest conservation and other mat
ters of the greatest national importance,
there is so much to write aboot that the
main difficulty is one of selection.
The President and the President-elect,
as is well known, are the closest of.friends.
The latter bears a relation to the former
that is /Closely analogous to that of heir
apparent, or crown prince. He is politi
cally the well beloved son of the
although they are nearly the same age,
President Roosevelt being less than a year
older than Judge Taft. But so busy has
Presidenl Roosevelt been talking and
scolding and so much occupied has Judge
Taft been dining, breakfasting and
lunching with his many friends and dis
cussing political questions with Speaker
Cannon and the members of the Ways
and Cleans Committee, that he and the
President have not been able to spend a
minute together. In a few days, Judge
Taft will go south to Augusta, Ga , where
he will be the guest of a prominent and
wealthy Southerner and where he will
remain a gieater part of the time until
the' fourth of March. Then he will, of
course, take up a temporary residence,
for four years at least, in the White
House, while the President will cross the
seas and -deserts and plunge into the
depths of the Dark Continent, where pol
itics and visiting delegations will trouble
him no more.
V
Judge Taft expressed the belief last
week that the House of Representatives
would make an honest and thorough re
vision of the tariff at the extra session
which he is pledged to call for tariff re
vision, immediately after his inauguration.
He bases this statement on an interview
which be had with Speaker Cannon
about the middle of- the week and with
the Republican members of the Ways
and Means Committee the following day
at the residence of the President’s son-in
law, Hon. Nicholas Longwortb. Mr.
Taft has not yet consulted Republican
Senators who will no douDt have some
thing to say about the tariff bill after it
comes frpm the House, but he gave an
intimation that he might even veto a bill '
that had received the imprimatur of both
the House and the Senate, if it did not
conform with his views as a fulfillment of
the pledges made in the Republican plat
form at Chicago and by himself, when he
said in an address at Milwaukee :
"Mr. Bryan says there has been no in
dication that the revision may not be up
ward rather than downward. In answer
I can say that the party is pledged to a
genuine revision and as the temporary
head of that party and President of the
United States, if it be successful in No
vember, I expect to use the influence that
I have by calling immediately a special
session and by recommending to Congress
to secure a genuine and honest revision
of the tariff in accordance with the prin
ciple of protection laid down in the plat
form, based upon the examination of
appropriate evidence and impartial as be
tween consumer and manufacturer.”
V
There is doubtless some opposition to
Speaker Cannon and bis re-election in his
own party in Congress This opposition,
however, is not as strong and universal as
is the feeling in the White House and
probably throughout the country. The
President, as is well known, believes in
the present and the future. He favors
young men in the Army and Navy and
doubtless thinks there should be more
young men in Congress He perhaps
would accede to such wisdom as may be
in the maxim “Old men for counsel and
young men for war.” But statesmanship
or counsel according to bis theory, is no
longer in diplomacy antf chicanery of the
Macchiavellian type, but war and con
tention against stationary stand pat and
retrogressive tendencies. The Speaker
belongs to a past generation and the ways
of the fathers aud their grandfathers, the
old time religion, is good enough for him.
There is no doubt but that the President
elect is iu sympathy with the. President,
both as to his likes and dislikes, though
I his temperment is less explosive and he
1 has more geniality and
| tact than President Roosevelt, but it is a
I mistake to suppose his suaviter in modo
in any way regatives his fortiter iu re.
V
The special Chinese envoy sent to
thank this government for the return of
$■1,000,000 Boxer indemnity has sent to
the White House as a present to Mrs
Roosevelt a tiger skin and many bales of
Chinese silk.
The annual report of {he Secretary of
Agriculture, just made public, shows
among other things that may be of inter
est to our farmers, that the value of all
farm products of 1938 reaches the most
extraordinary total in the nation’s history
—s7 778,00 b, 000. The gain over is
$290,000,000. Greatest of all crops is
Indian corn, whose production this year
is 2,643,0011,000 bushels, worth $1,615,-
000,000. This crop is worth this year
nearly as much as the great crops of
cotton, hay and wheat combined.
The greatest hay crop in history has
been gathered this year, 68,000,000 tons,
or 12 per cent above the average of the
preceding five years. Its price is $2 per
ton less than it was a year ago, but still
the farm value of the crop is $621,000,000,
or 6 per cent above the five-year average
Wheat is per cent above the five
year average in production and 23 per
ceut above in total value. The 660,000,-
000 bushels of this crop are estimated to
be worth $620,000,000 to the farmers,
or $66,000,000 more than the most val
uable wheat crop heretofore produced.
Although the oat crop suffered from
drouth, the value is $321,000,000, for
789,000,000 bushels, or 10 per cent above
the five-year average value and 9 per ceut
below the average product. ‘ Rye remains
in the notch that it has occupied in pro
duction in recent years, but its value,
$22,000,000, is 17 per cent above the
average.
All cereals aggregate 4,329,000,000
bushels, a total that has been exceeded
three times, but the value reaches
$2,694,000,000, or more than $300,000,-
000 above that of 19*7, and exceeds still
more the totals of former years. Com
pared with the preceding five years, the
number of bushels is higher by 0.2 per
cent and the value higher by 32 per cent.
Unfavorable weather made the potato
crop only 275,000,000 bushels, or 5 per
cent below the five year average,
altbongh the value, $190,000,000, is iS
per cent above and was never equaled by
any former crop.
Although the farmer gets hardly 20cts.
a pound for his butter, between 3 and 4
cents a quart for his milk, and about 1
cents for each egg, yet the value of the
farm products of the dairy cow is getting
close to SBOO 000,000, aud the value of
the eggs and poultry produced on the
farm is worth as much as the hay crop or
the wheat crop.
In the past few years the value of farm
lands has greatly increased,-farm wages
are higher and the production per acre
has been greatly increased in some
sections.

PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD
Bulletin
YhE STEEL COACH-A TRAVEL SAFEGUARD.
The Pennsylvania Railroad now has in operation on its
lines east of Pittsburg over two hundred passenger coaches,
dining cars, baggage cars, and mail cars of the new all steel
type.
The solid steel framework of these cars, designed to*
resist shock and minimize the dangers of collision, is further
strengthened by the steel sheathing enclosing the body of the
car. In fact, everything about the coach is steel, save the
window frames, the cushions of the seats, and the flooiiug.
Such little woodwork as enters into the make-up of the coach,
the plush with which the car seats are covered and the hair
with which they are stnfied is treated to a fireproofing pro
cess, whilst the floors are cemeut, thus rendering the coach at
once practically indestructible and thoroughly fireproof. It is
bnilt like a battleship!
The new coach is longer than the standard car generally
in use on the railroads of this country, and has a comfortable
seating capacity of sixty to ninety people according to the
style of the coach.
The .unusual weight o( the coaches give to them a solidity
that greatly increases the comfort of the passenger.’
The seats are adjusted to a more convenient space and
angle, the coaches are all lighted with electricity and amply
ventilated in winter as well as summer by new and thoroughly
tested methods.
The interior finish of the coach is plain though pleasing
to the eye. The absence of ornamentation enhances the idea
of strength and at the same time assures absolute cleanliness
and thorough sanitation.
Steel oars are now in use on the principal trains between
New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and on the Main Line
between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The number of cars is
constantly being increased as the finished product comes from
the shops.
The Pennsylvania Railroad’s equipment is recognized as
the Standard of America.

How To Avoid Catching Colds.
As every one is liable to catch a cold
and as colds are very dangerous because
they terminate in chronic throat or lung
diseases, every one should be interested
in learning how to avoid colds. The
way is simple. Never sleep too cold,
never fall asleep in a cold room, or while
sitting in a cold draft. No one ever
catches a cold while the body and mind
are active, no matter how cold one may
get. If you are sufferiug from a cold or
its effects, Rydale’s Cough Elixir is the
quickest and best remedy you can nse.
Rydale’s Cough Elixir is sold under a
guarantee. 2jc and 50c a bottle. Eli T.
