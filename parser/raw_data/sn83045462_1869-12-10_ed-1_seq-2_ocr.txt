Reading Matter on Every Page.
Mr. 1 rnmbnir*"Kmaarlpslion Rill."
The Tr,'>*? >ij le.> Senator TrumVjII'b
bill prohibiting interference by Cougr<'mnien
in th- matter of af>t>o ntm<Mit? to office " a
bHl to rnanritiate Conitv-- from borp*." If
||>a>?ed. the Trtbunr thinks tilt bill will Mt only
I rot;*ct Orpmarn mJ ?l<p%rtment ?l!icfri
from a Muding Mwnifi-. b:it it will f<>rm the
tpvring wiilgc to the parage of a Civil Serricc
Mil, or at lea.-t the adoption by the civil
fcerrircoi a policyof making all appointment*
*n<l removals strictlv with a view to secure the
t><-f performance of official duty, and not for the
pnrpose of rewarding anyltody "? friends or puni-li
ng an> body's enemiev.
We suspect that the great drawback to the
parage of either Mr. Trumbull** bill or the
Civil Service bill will be from the indisposition
of Congressmen to )?eld the localfcmtronaije,
whirh. ace?rding to nvxlrrn umjre, is heM to in;
a- much a perquisite of the position of M. C- a*
the frankling privilege, or the stationery allotment.
Klectioneering ilebts doe the "workers"
Ewl'o nominate and elect members are to be paid
in tliH? way. But there are u-ually ho many more
office-seekers than office.-., and all are so clamorAt.a
*k?* . ? * * " *
*-uf luai a K?IUU iu.'iuv members D4^m 10
think that paying off oM dt-hto iu this
way costs inori than it comes to. The
?fflce-soeker is the plague of the Congressman'*
life. 'logging him at every ?tep, and at
, all boars, waking or *lee|>?ag. at his home or at
the Capitol. (ongressmen of capacity for busiTie>v
feci that they can use their time to better
advantage than in reading the greasy papers
and listening to the lon^-wind?'d appeals of the
o?i re-seeking bores; and this feeling will go far
to cause them to give up the slight personal advantage
to be obtained from the control of local
appointments. The tact that every ofllce-secking
constituent is made a bitter enemy if disappointed.
and that many more are disappointed
k than successful, furnishes another item on the
lose side of the account.
It is well for Congressmen, our city fathers,
and property owners on Pennsylvania avenue
that the poor horses cannot make speeches or
cast votes. If they could, we fancy that magnificent
thoroughfare would not be left much
loiter in it* uriMnt
^ . M ?vv>ut an i uaugrruus
condition. What might easily be made the
finot drive and promenade in the world, is now
really one of the least attractive, and all for
want of being decently pared. And not only
that; it is uncomfortable for those person*
. obliged to use it, unsafe lor tlu>ir hones, and
terribly destructive of their vehicles.
Bat a change in these respects in not all that
would be gained by the much needed improvement.
Every piece of property fronting on the
ATenue would at once be increased in Talue ten
times its por;->rtion of the cost of properly paving
the w hole roadway. Is it not possible, therefore.
to get something done in this direction,
and that without further delay! If Congress
refuses to pmj the j>ortion of the cost which
thonld rightfully be borne by tin general government,
let our municipal authorities, the
street railway company, ami the property hold
vi- vumjii me ncrrauj permission, and do tlie
work at their own e*|?ense. It would be one of
the U?t investment* they ever made. Not only
would it be returned to them directly in more
valuable property, but one of the chief glories of
Washington would be brought before strangers
in such a manner that this act would of itselt'do
n.ore than any single one Of which we can
cow think toward dispelling the whole ide:? of
removing the capital.
A barbed arrow seems to be aimed at par?ons |
Bffti.er and Frothingham in that part of He- !
ctfder liackttCs chtige to the grand jury, on I
WcdirsliT last, which a<ljures that body to in- ]
diet any persons implicated, no matter how ele- j
Tat. d in life they may be, if it believes that big- j
amy was committed, or w? aided and abetted,
in the recent K i c har (1m >n-Mc Far la rid marriage i
ceremony. Indeed, even brother Oreelev and
Calhoun may be hroug'-t into court under j
the Keeorder's charge- before the matter blows over
entirely. In which event we wish them a j
fair tiial ami such ik-uc as their de*?*rts may !
lifiail but whether anything comes of this ;
phase < f tin case or not, it is likely that the pub- J
lie si i.se of decency w ill not be ?o outraged again 1
for aite tunc to con. -. The expression of popi
lar opinion La- been so general in its extent
ai.d so unmistakable in it* tone, that no one,
though a t?ol. can err a." to its meai.ing.
Tie New York IndepenUemt advances some
Hartling view* on the marriage state apropos to !
the Ki<:hardi?m-Marfarland artair, and talk.*
?l?ut the " foOy and wMMmh of that it mi- '
ffrttitiout *iitiment" which 'compels the j
life-long union of two persons, either of ;
tii 4 kiich a union to be loatusom*. degrading, 1
ml nMr." That i* to say, if eltlier party has
an "affinity" for somebody else, he or she has j
ralv to set up the plea that the present tic is j
it|>uWve, and thereupon it can be dissolved j
aciiutb marriage relations entered into. For j
a religious paj-cr?so call<*d?this is rather sin- ,
gu'ai doctrine: but we are living in a day of j
"advanced views.''

fl-aughtei. J So if the *Jen?u? Committee were
to take the whole bill of 1899, and make the ne(-eMHiry
alteration* in it. he thought it would be
an improvement on the i>etiding bill.
Mr. Hotter (Maas.). wishing to te*t the scumI
of the Hou*- on whether the present machinery
of the Coveriimentshonld be used for taking the
census, or w hether a new set of oflcero should

I li) n.aking it road, "tliat it shall be the duty of
; 11m* A>.?est?or of Internal Keveutte in each dis|
trict to cause all the inhabitant* to be enumerated."
Here w?.? a well paid, well trained, and
I thoroughly sifted body of officers. who could do
the work well.
Mr. Mavaard nrrucd that it wj* not to be expected
that, with the late of compensation pro'
vided for enumerators, (fH a day for sixty days.)
? < r>ii >t t, nt men could be procured, or th:?t anything
like a complete ceiuius would Ih> taken bv
them. l-i Mime res|iects he thought well of the I
pro|Kwition of the gentleman from Maxsachuj
sett*. (Mr. Butler.)
Mr. Stokes, chairman of the Census Commit
tee, replied to Mr. Maynard's objection, and
expressed his conviction that competent men
could be got for *4 a day. which was all that
the me?kr? of the Tennessee Legislature reI
ceived.
Mr. Judd argued on the great importance ot" I
the statistical information to be obtained by the I
W taker, not only for the legislative department
of the country," but for the national ered- i
itor* abroad; and expressed his sentiment that
im) ideas of economy should be permitted to
intervene as an obstacle to a perfect and compute
census.
Mr. Garfield also replied to the argument in
l'avor of employing the internal revenue officers
to take the census; taking the ground that the
ta\-gather?.-r was an officer Oil ions to tlie people,
who should be thoroughly convinced that the
census had do connection whatever with taxai
tion.
Mr. Allison, a member of the Orwn* Cnmmit- .
tee, ?L-<> argued against the amendment offered
bv Mr. Butler. That proposition had been fully
and carefully considered by the committee, and
had been rejected.
Mr. Butler paid hi.- plan did not propose to interfere
with the duties of the Commissioner of
Internal Re venue, but to place the awes-wrs Tor
this puri<o*e under the Census Sii]>crintendeiit.
-Mr. Allison remarked that then the pro|tosition
was *tdl more objectionable, because it
would place assessor* and nMiatant as*ts.sors
under two separate and distinct jurisdiction*,
which would make ' confusion worse con- .
founded.*'
Mr. Wood thought that the amendment offer- !
ed b> Mr. Buth r wm-> not without merit, aud
said that his first impulse had been to favor anything
which would restrict the patronage of the j
Ai'miuvtratluu; but, considering the vast interests
at stake. ai d knowing that the wrholi- value 1
of the census dejH nded upon its precision and
accuracy, lie would not allow any lee line of :? 1
partisan character to Interfere with it. Referring
to the New York ccnsu* of he stigmatized
it a.- a shameful {-artisan fraud ui>->11 the
people, w hich had cut down the |>opulsttion oi
the citv by for the puri>ose or not allowing
it proper representation in the State LegL? ,
latine.
Mr. lenckes argued that there was something
ot \alue In each oi' the |>eiiding propositions,
ami that, while the assessor* .should not l>e employed
to take the enumeration, the statistical
infotniatioii ]>o^?efiMert by the Internal Iteveuue
Bureau should be utilized for the puri?*>c of the
census.
Mr. Butler (Macs.) closed the debate by an
argument in sup|*>rt of his amendment. He I
claimed that under it there would be greater ,
etticiency. greater promptitude, greater accu
racy, and greater economy. The. mntUmau 1
iMm New York (Mr. Woo'll had informed the '
committee tliit the c< amis of ItfciS in liw State. I
made by the Republican party, had been en- j
tirelr a fraud. The corollary of that would
K't m to be that there should be 110 cen.-ua taken
at all. There mi^lit be au idiogyueracy
al-otit Sew York that nothiug could be done
there which was not a fraud iu someway or
form; but lie trusted that lv\. here there eonl.l
tw an honest census taken. He admitted! that
there was great danger that nothing could be
found out in New York axi.it the election-,
about the een.HU?, about gold speculations, or
about scheme* of every soit. It seemed to be
one living mass ot' corruption and fraud, of
which the gentleman (Mr. Wood) was a represcntatire.
[Laughter.}
Mr. Davis ?sk> d Mr. Butler whether he meant
the State or the city.
Mr. Butler ?The city always, sir.
Mr. I?avi*?Then I have nothing to say.
Mr. Butler.?I thought not. [Laughter.]
Mr. Wood.?I a?k the gentleman whether his
opinion of New York ha-been gathered trom
the amount of litigation to which he has been
subjected to there. [Langhtw.]
Mr. Butler?Not at ail, sir. 1 have never yet
been able to get a case for trial in New York. I
exrcct a rood deal of fraud when 1 do.
The delate being closed, the question was
taken on Mr. Butler's amendment, and it wiir
ejected?year, 22; nays, not counted.
Oil motion of Mr- Wood. ;?ud after considerable
di.-eussion, the lifU] section was amended by
requiring each district sujierinUndent to be a
