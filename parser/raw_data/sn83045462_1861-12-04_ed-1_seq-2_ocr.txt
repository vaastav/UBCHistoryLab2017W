Tb? R*pv*hr*n expressta 1U aatlafactton with
lb* gener*' tone of the message, but thinks the
President would have beeo more radical upen
the question of slavery, but for " the reserve and
caut'en appropriate to bis official station."
Tm Ms?sag?.?'The real friends of the Union
In the Federal Metropolis are grateful beyond
expression to the Preaideut and his constitutional
sdvlaers for the tone of bis massage upon the
point in our national troubles In connection with
which the demagogues and fanatics of the loyal
Htates are now striving to inaugurate a policy,
which, if successfully initiated, will surely unite
Mm whole people of the South against the cause
of the Gnloa, while it the seme time It matt u
ureiv generate a powerful, perbape overwhelming,
party at the North earnestly opposed to tbe
auroras of a war waged for abolition end*, and
Irretrievably disgust and dishearten three-fourths
f our loyal fellow-citizens now tn arm*.
He declares, In ao many words, that be Is
" onxiou* and cartful 14*1 lA? ??mtttaiU tonjlitt
for ifcir pmrpe**" (tbe suppression of the Insurrection)
" shall not dftnoratt into a violent and
*emors?l**? ritt lut<onary struggle." That be
forcibly realize' that those who would tnrn the
war Into a con'est for tbe emancipation of tbe
Uvea of tbe !*outb, rather tban for the re-establlshment
of tbe Union on tbe basis of the Cods*!filffnn

dangerous than the re be la themselves (wbose
most serviceable allies tbeyare) lata evident aa
bis purpose of preventing them from bringing
ultimate defeat upon our nrins
The effect of bis message aa a whole, will aa
urely be to secure for b'.ni the hearty and active
support of tbe great body of tbe loyal people (of
those wbo are to light our battles and those who
re to pay the pecuniary cost of them), aa to unite
against him tbe noiay band of fanatics and demagogues.
wbo, under pretence of maintaining tbe
cause of "human freedom," have seized upon tbe
unfortunate cond t'on of the country to endeav t
lo obliterate lta only safeguard on thi? continent?the
Constitution of tbe Unfed States?and
to establish in Its stead, aa the fundamental law
of tbe land, the unbridled passions and llcenttou*
will of wboever can inveigh by torchlight, loudest,
for the time being, In tbe presence of irresponsible
mobs 1 bank (iod, the cauoe of tbe Union will
triumph notwithstanding tbsir enmity towardj
It.
Why be is sow a I'miom Mas?a very IntelUgent
Maryland gentleman, who has alwayi
been a deiriorra', and in the last campaign waa
an ardent Breckinridge man, was in tbiacity last
spring. and was at that time one of the moat ultrasecessionist
to b? found. He shortly afterwards
left here for a busine-s tour through South America,
and returned a few days since. He is now in
favor of preserving the Union at every hazard
When asked what caused the change in hit
lews he replied that a few years since he wai
through South America and, as a citizen r-f the
United State*, was everywhere treated with the
highest consideration and respect. This time
everything was changed. In every little Stated
Central and South America he was lusulted. and
when be spoke of b!s nationality wa* laughed at
end taunted with the rupture bere ' \ <>u talk
of the United States," raid they; "you have no
country now. you who have been so boastful.
You are no longer In a condition to tit out filibustering
ezped'tlons and prey upon your wrakei
neighbors You will soon be as weik as the
weakest " Our friend was so forcibly struck

I Very many of our reader* are familiar with the
mode of taking balloon rbeenratlona for military
purposes as conducted by Prof Lrwe, but they
1 mar not be aware that the ?Mal observations
' mads bv Prof La Mountain (stationed Mar the
j Alexandria Seminary) with th? same object are
, carried out upon an entirely different system.
I The Lowe balloon *s anchored to the earth, ard
elcTated or depressed by means of a cord, and at

fret This mode baa aJvantaves In the way of
affording prompt communication, telegraphic or
otherwise, with the earth.
Professor La Mountain, acting 3pen the theory
to which be has given some yeais' study, that
balloon trsvel may be regulated with precision
by taking advantage <f the contrary currents of
air which it Is believed always prevail at different
elevations, launches boldly forth Into the
heavens and sails away down over Dixie's land,
high above the bead* of astonished secesL. Hovering
over Jeff-Dav's-dom at an elevation of from
one to two miles (well out of rifle range), the
ftrnnmt urith hmr ?vm nnt?? mioht (hat man K#
deemed of Interest at military headquarters; and
then, when secesb? who hat been following him
with wrathful eye?imagines the luckless voyager
to be drifting, helpless, rig*t into his clutches,
down comet a silver shower of sand ballast, and
up leaps the balloon a peg higher Into the heavens,
strikes the couuter currcnt, and *alM saucily
beck to the domain of the stars and stripes.
Prof. La Mountain has made six successful reconnolterlng
excursion# upon this theory within
the last month and a half, going down over the
enemy's lines with the sub-current and Mom.
Injs by the counter-current Sometimes an elevation
of something like four milt s has been de
manaea ere rtactiing tue counter-current, but it
haa alwava been found. Without douHt the aid
Incidentally given to balloon experimenting by
Government, during tbe pretent war, will enable
rc-onauts t? collect valuable data in furtherance
of their inveatigationa.
i Prof La Mountain baa with him Mr. A Ken,
drlrk, aaaiatar.t, and Mr N. K. White, draugbta
man.
