President's Message.
To the Senate and House of Represontatives:
To the Senate and House of Represontatives: THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.
In transmitting to you my fourth
Annual Message it is with thankful
ness to the Giver of all good that as a
nation we have been blestted for the
!&rt year with ncaee at home and
abroad and a general prosperity,
vouchsafed to but few peorde.with the
exception of the recent devastating
tire which swept from the earth with
a breath as it were minions of accu
mulated wealth in the city of Boston.
There have been two over-shadowing
-aIamities within the year to record,
it is gratifying to note here, like their
fellow citizens of the city of Chicago,
under similar circumstances a year ,
r arher, the citizens of lloton are ral- j
Iviri" under their roisionunes, nn
the pro-pect is that their energy and'
jo-rveranee will overcome all obsta
cles Mid fchow the Rame prosperity
soon that they would have shown bad
no disaster befallen them. Otherwise,
we have been free from pestilence, war
and calamities which often overtake
nations, and, as far as human Judg
ment can penetrate th future, no
cause seems to exist to threaten our
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS ARBITRATION.
When Congress adjourned in June
last a- ojestion had been raised by
(reat Britain, and was then pending,
which, for a time, seriously imperiled
the settlement ty friendly arbitration
of tbe dillerenc?3 existing between
thU government and that of Her
Jirittsnic Majesty by tli Treaty of
Washington, had been referred to the
Tribunal of Arbitration which had
met at Geneva, in Switzerland. The
arbitrators, however, disposed of the
question which hail jeopardized the
whole of the treaty and threatened to
involve the two nation in most un
happy relations toward each other. In
a manner entirely satisfactory to this
government and in accordance with
me views and the policy which it had
maintained. The "Tribunal, which
had convened in Geneva in Decem
ber, concluded its laboriorw session-on
th. 14Ui dav of jeotember last, on
which .day,, juaving availed, ituelf or .
the discretionary power given to it oy
the treaty to award a sum ia gro-.s.
It made its decision, whereby it
awarded the sum of 35,oOt),(M0 tb
gold as the indemnity to bo paid by
Great Britain to the United 8tates,for
the ratification of ail the claims re
ferred to its consideration. This deci
sion hsppiiy disposes of a long stand
ing difference between the two gov
ernments, and ia connection with an
other award made by the German
Kmperor under a reference to him by
the same treaty, leaves these two gov
ernments without a shadow upon the
frieudly relations which it is toy sin
cere hope may forever remain equal
ly unclouded.
The report of the agent of the Unit
ed tSUte appointed to attend the Ge
neva Tribunal, accompanied by the
protocols of the proceedings of the ar
mtrators. the ar uuieliU of the coun
sel of both governments, the award of
the Tribunal, aud the riuwus- given
by the several arbitrator?,-is trans
111 it ted herewith. I liave caused to be
communicated to the. heads of the
three friendly powers vho complied
with the joint request made to them
under tbe treaty, the thanks of this
government for the appointment ot
arbitrators made by them respective
ly, and al0 my thanks to the emi
nent persons named by them, and my
appreciation of the dignity, patience,
impartiality and great ability with
which they discharged their orders
and high functions. Her Majesty s
government has communicated to me
its appreciation by her Majesty of the
abilitv and indefatigable industry dis
played by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator
named on me pari oi iuis goveru
nieut during tbe protracted inquiries
and discussions of tbe Tribunal. I
cordially unite with her Majesty in
this appreciation. It is due to the
agent of the United States before the
Tribunal to record my hiaib apprecia
tion of the marked abdity, unwearied
iiatlenras ait tt prul-rcs and discre
tion with which ho has conducted th
very responsible and delicate duties
committed to hi 4, as it is also due to
th learned and eminent counsel who
attended the Tribunal on the part of
hu trove meiit. to express my sense
,ft! t-ilents and wisdom which they
i.t-nno-httoheirip! heareument. It will
be the province oi Congress to provide
for the distribution among those who
may be entitled to it of their respec
tive shares of the money to be paid.
Aithoncrii the sum awarded Is not
navable until a year from the date of
the award, it is deemed advisable that
no time be lost in making a proper
oTmnation of the several cases in
which indemnification may be due. J
onncenueutlv recommend the crea
tion of a board of commissioners for
th nuroose of the Sun Juan boundary
iWiNion. BV the third and fourth

the United .Stales and of Great
Britain in their construction of the
Treaty of the loth of June, 1S46.
deliuing the boundary line between
their respective territories were sub
mitted to the arbitration and award
of His Majesty the Emperor of Ger
many to decide which of those claims
is most in accordance with the true
interpretation of the Treaty of 1M6.
His Majesty, the Kmperor of Ger
many, having been pleased to under
cut,, the arbitration, has the earnest
thanks of this gover nment and of the
people of tbe United Sta'.es for the la -
oor, pains and care v-nica no nas oe-
voted to the consideration oi tnisionp
neudicg d.;!erence. I have-caused an
expression of my thanks to be com
municated to HU Majesty. Mr.Bau
croft, the renresenUtive of this gov
ernment at H-?rIiu,ciiiducted the case
and prepared the j-tnieicent on the
part of the United States, with the
ability that 4iis past M-rvice justified
the public in exacting Rt his hands.
As a member of the cabinet at the
date of he Treaty wh.ch has given
rise to the discussion between the two
povern incuts, as the Minister to Great
Britain whn the construction now
pronounced uufouuded was first ad
vanced, and a the agent a-id repre
peutativeof the government to pre
entthe case and to receive the award,
he has been associated with the ques
tion in all of Its phases, and in every
.tage Las manifested a patriotic zeal
unS earnestness in the maintenance
of the claim of the United States; he
is entitled to much credit for the sue
crhirli has attended tbe submis
sion. After a patient investigation of
the case and of tbe statements oi eacu
partv. His Majesty the Emperor, on
the -list dav of October last.signed his
award in writing, decreeing that the
l:iim of the covernment of the L ui-
ted States that the boundary line be
tween the territories of Her Britannic
Majesty and the I niled tetates suouia
be drawn through the Haro channel,
is most in accordance with the true
interpretation of tbe Treaty conclud
ed on the 15th dsy of June, 184G, be
tween the agentx of Her Britannic
Majesty and the United States.
THE SAN JUAN QUESTION.
Copies of the case presented on be
half of each government, and cf the
statement iu reply of each and a
translation of tiie award are transmit
ted herewith. This award confirms
the United States in their claim to the
important archipelago of islands ly
ing between the continent and Van
couver's Island, which for twenty-eix
years, ever since the ratification of
the treaty, Great Rritain has contes
ted, and "leaves ns for the first time in
the history of the United States a na
tion without a question of disputed
boundary lietween our territory - and
the posnessiona of Great Britain on
this continent. It is my gratefui du
ty to acknowledge the prompt, spon
taneous action of Her Majesty's gov
ernment in giving effect to the award.
In anticipation of any request from
this government, and before tlie re
ception in United States of the award
nigned by the Emperor, Her Majesty
had eiven instructions for the remov

since been disposed of, and I haye re
ceived notice that the Imperial Parlia
ment and the legislature of the prov

to carry the provisions of the treaty

early adoption of the legislation in

OUR RELATIONS WITH EUROPE.
Witii France, our earliest ally:
Russia, the constant and steady friend
of the United tStates; Germany, with
whose government aud people we
jjaTe gomaar causes of friendship and
manv COmmon sympathies, and
the other powers of Kurope, our re
lations are maintained on the mot
frieudly terms since my last annual
message. The exchange has been
made of the ratifications of a treaty
with the Austrian and Hungarian
empires, relating to naturalization;
also of a treaty with the German em
pire respecting consuls and trade
marks; also of a treaty with Swetdeu
and Norway relating to naturalization,
ail of which treaties have been duly
proclaimed.
THE DISTRESS OF CURE—THE OBVIOUS
CAUSE.
It Is with regret that 1 have again
to announce a continuance of the dis
turbed condition of the island of Cu
ba... No advance toward the pacifica
tion of tbe discontented part of the
population has been made, while tbe
insurrection has gained no advanta
ges and exhibits no more of the ele
ments of power or of tbe prospect of
ultimate success than were exhibited
a year ago. Spain, on the other hand,
has not succeeded in its suppression,
ami the parties stand apparently iu
the same relative attitude which they
have occupied for a law' time past.
ThU contest has lasted now for more
than four years. Were it seen at a
distance from our neighborhood we
might be indifftreiit to its result, al
though humanity could not bo un
moved by many of its incidents
wherever they might orcur. It Is,
however, at our door.
IcauBot doubt that the continued
maintenance of slavery in Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to
the continuance of this strife. A ter
rible wrong is the result of a terrible
evil. The aDontioH or slavery aim
the introduction of other reforms in
the administration of government in
Cuba could not fail to advance the
restoration of peace and order. It is
especially to be hoped that the pres
ent liberal government of Spain will
voluntarily adopt this view. 'mm
law ot emancipation, which was
passed more than two years since, has
remained'unexecuted in the absence of
regulations for its enforcement. It
was but a feeble step toward emanci
pation but it was tue recognition oi
right and was bailed as such, and ex
hibited in Spain in harmony with
the sentiment of Justice and of hu
manity, and in sympathy with the
other powers of the christian and civ
ilized world, witnin ine last lew
weeks the regulations for carrying out
the laws of emancipation have been
announced, giving evidence of the
sincerity of the intentions of the pres
ent government to carry into eilect
the law of 1871. I have not failed to
urge the consideration of the wisdom,
tbe noliev and the justice of a more
efletive system for the abolition of
the great evil which oppresses a race
and continues a bloody and destruct
ive contest close to our border, as well
as the expediency And Justice of con
ceding reforms of which the proprie
ty is not questioned. Deeply im
pressed with the conviction that the
continuance of slavery is one of the
most active ca jses of the continuance
of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I
regret to believe that citizeks of the
United .States, or those claiming to be
such, are large hoiders in Cuba of
what is there claimed as property,
but which is forbidden and denouue-
j ed by the laws of the United States
, xiiey are thus in defiance of the spirit
i ofour jawg contributing to tbe con-
tinuance of this
distressing contest.
In mv last annual message, I referred
to this subject, aud I again recom
mend such legislation as may oe prop
er to denoan.ee, and if not prevent, at
least to aiscomage A.mncan citizens
from holding or dealing in siav. it
is gratifying ta announce that the
ratification of the convention con
cluded, under the auspices of this
government, between Spain on the
one part, and the allied Republics of
the Pacific on the other, providing for
an armistice, have been exchanged;
a copy of the instrument is herewith
submitted. It is hoped that this may
be followed by a permanent peace be
tween the iame parties.
RELIEF OF DISTRESSED CITIZENS
ABROAD.
Congress, from the beginning
government, has wisely made provi
sion for the relief of distressed sea
men in foreign countries. "No simi
lar provision, however, has hitherto
been made fr the relief of distressed
citizens abroad other than seamen. It
is understood to be customary with
other governments to authorize con
suls to extend such relief to their citi
zeus or subjects in certain cases. A
similar authority and an appropria
tion to carry it into effect are pom
mended, in case of citizens of the
United States, destitute or sick uuaer
such circumstances. It is well kuown
tbat such citizens resort to foreigu
countries in great numbers, though
most of them are able to tear the ex
pense incident to locomotion. There
are some who, through accident or
otherwise, become penniless, and have
no friends at home able to succor
them.
Persons in this situation must eith
er perish or cast themselves upon the
charity of foreigners or be relieved at
the private charge of our own officers,
wha usually, even with the most be
nevolent 'dispositions have noth
ing to spare. Should the au
thority and appropriation be
asked for. care will be taken ta carry
the beneficence of Congress into effect
so that it shall be unnecessary or
unworthily bestowed.

for the fiscal year ending June HO,
1S72, to be 33.372,1 j7 20, showing a
reduction in favor of the last liscil

military appropriation for the next
fiscal year, ending June 3d, 174, are
S-'5.'J,S01,37s.7S. The estimates of the
chief of enj;iueers are submitted sepa
rately for fortifications, river an 1
harbor improvements aud for public
buildings and ground, and thu Wash

frecdmeus' bureau have all been trans

regulations have been put into execu
tion for the speedy payment of boun
ty duo colored soldiers properly com
ing under that bureau.
All war accounts for money and
property prior to lb7I, nave been ex

The total deaths for the year reported
were 3fi7 white aud 54 colored.
Tbe distribution of the medical and
surgical history of the war is yet to
be ordered by Congress. There exists
an absolute necessity for a medical
corps of the full number established
by act of Congres9of July 2S;h, 1SQG,
there being now nfty-nine vacancies,
and the number of successful can
didates rarely exceeds eight or ten in

The river and uarbor unnrovemetiis
have been carried on with energy and
economy. Though many are only
partially complet-d, the results have
saved to commerce! many times the
amount expended. Tne increase of
commerce with greater depth of chau-'
nels, greater security in navigation
and the saving of lime, adds millions
to the wealth of the country aud in
creases the resources or the govern

complete history of the services of
the navy for the past year in addition
to it3 regular services. It is evident
that unless steps are taken to pre-
serve our navy, that in a very few

weakest nation upon the ocean of ull
the great powers. With an energet
ic, progressive, business people like
ours, penetrating and forming busi

The accompany report of the Postmaster-General
furnishes a full and
satisfactory exhibit of the op
erations of the Post Office
Department during tbe year. Tne
ordinary revenue of the departmeut
for the fiscal year.cnding June 3D, 1S72,
amounted to $21,915,426.37, and the
expenditure $2o,6oS,192.21. Com
pared with the previous fiscal year
the increase of revenue was $1,873,
9S0.95, or 9.37 per Cent, and tbe in
crease of expenditures $2,203,033.2 or
920 per cent. Adding to the ordinary
n-venue the annual appreciation ot
$700,0o0 for free matter, and the
amounts paid to the subsidies on mail
steamship lines from special appro
priations, the deficiency paid out of
tue general Treasury was-yrs,TH.
1S71. Other
statistical information relating to our
lliull" "T . '
ramdlv extending postal service is
furnished in this report. The total
length of railroad mail routes ou the
30tn of Juue, 1872, was 57,011 miles,
8,077 additional miles of bucU service
having been put into operation during
the year. Eight new lines of railway
postofiices have been established,
with an aggregate length of 2,900
miles. The number of letters ex
changed in the mails with foreign
countries was 21,302,500, an increase
of 4,000,502, or twenty per cent, over
the number in 1871, and the postage
thereon amounts to $1,S71,2j7.25. The
total weight of tlie mails exchanged
with European countries exceeded
S20 tons. The cost of the United
States traus-Atlautio nriil steamship
service was $22,030,170. Tne total
cost of the United States ocean steam
ship service, including the amounts
paid to the subsidized lines of mail
steamers, was $102,702,097. The fol
lowing are the only steamship lines
uow -receiving subsidies for mail ser
vice under special acts of Congress:
The Pacific -Mail Steamship Compa
ny receive S-joO.O'iO per auiiutn, for
carrying a monthly mail between
San Fraiiciseo, Japan, and China,
which will be increased to 1,!MX),000
per annum for a sami-inonthly mail,
on and after October 1, 1S7J. The
United States aud Brazil Mail steam
ship Company receive 150, 0 per
annum for carrying a monthly mail
between New York ami Rio de Janer
io, Brazil, and tbe California, Oregon,
aud Mexico Steamship Company re
ceive $75,000 per annum for carrying
a monthly mail between Sin Francis
co aud Honolulu, Hawaiia Islands,
making the total amout of mail
cu.naship uubsidics at preseut $725,
000 per annum.
Oiir noatal ootnniuuioatiom with all
parts of the civilized world have been
placed upon a most advantageous
footing by the improved postal con
ventions, and the arrangements rc-
eeutlv concluded with tlie leading
commercial countries of Europo and
America. The gratifying statemeut
is made that, with the couclusion of a
satisfactory convention with France,
tne details 01 wmuu uavu ueeu ueu
nitely agroed to by the head of the
French postal department, subject to
the approval of tho Minister of Fi
nance, little remains to be accom
plished by the treaty for some time to
come, iu respect to the reduction of
rates fcr improved facilities for postal
Intercourse. Your favorable consid
eration is respectfully invited to the
recommendations made by the Post
master General for an increase of ser
vice from monthly to semi-mounthly
trips on tne mail steamship route to
Brazil; far a subsidy inside of the es
tahiisnment of an American line ot
mail steamera between San Francisco,
New Zealand and Australia; for the
eatablishment of post offices, savings
banks, and for the increase of the sal
aries of heads of bureaus.
I have heretofore recommended the
abolition of the franking privilege,
and aee no reason now for changing
my viewsoathat subject. It not tiaving
been favorably regarded by Congress,
however, I now suggest a m-juinci-tion
of that privilege to correct its
glaring and costly abuses. I would
also recommend tne appointment 01 a
committee or commission to tike in
to consideration the best method,
equitable to private corporations who
have invested their time and cipirul
in the establishment of telegraph
lines of acquiring tho title to ah
telegraph liues now ia operation, aud
of connecting this service with tha
postal service of the nation. It u not
probable that this subject could re
ceive tne proper consideration during
the limits of a short session of Con
gress, but it may bo initiated so that
further aotion may be fair to the gov
ernment and to private parties con
cerned. There are but three lines of

EDUCATION.
j
j
:
The rapidly increasing interest in
education is a most encouraging fea
tura in tbe current history of the
country, and is no doubt true that
this is due in a great measure to the
elfecU of the .Bureau of Education.
That alnco is continually receiving
evidences which abundantly prove its
efficiency, from the various institu
tions of learning and educators of all
kinds throughout the country. Tbe
report of the commissioner contains a
vast amount of educational details of
srreat interest The bill now pending
before Congress providing for the ap
propriation of part of the proceeds of
the sales of public lands for education
al purposes, to aid the states in the
general educttioti of their rising gen
eration is a measure of such great im
portance to our real progress, and is
so unanimously approved by the
leading friends of education, that I
commend it to the favorable attention
of Congress.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
An earnest desire has
eorrect the abuses which have grown
up iu the civil service of the country,
through the defective method of mak
iug appointment to otH.ee, which has
breu regarded too much as the reward
of political services. Under authori

HORACE GREELEY DEAD.

"Mr. Greeley died very quietly, and
without pain, nt ten minutes before
seven this evening. He was con
soious and rational." These were the
sad words that were telegraphed from
Tarrytown, X. Y., where Mr. Greeley
hal been staying, Friday night, De
vember27th, 1S72, announcing that
otic of the foremost men of the nation
had fallen.
Horace Greeley was lorn in Am
herst, Xow Hampshire, February 2,
1S11, and at an ear.y age he showed
au eagerness for acquiring knowledge,
and decided to be a printer. At the age
of fifteen he entered a printing office
in East Poultney, Vt., as an appren
tice. He learned rapidly, aud soon
acquired a good kuowledge of the
business. After working as a jour
neyman m ii-i -.it-....,., i, -vcut t0
New York City, aud engaged in tlie
same business. After several unsuc
cessful ventures in weekly papers, he
comraiiiiced the puhlicatiuu of the

ei very rapiuiv. inursdav atternoon
and evening he was deemed some-
wbat easier. Daring the nieht he
slept very uneasily, muttering occa
sionally, and frequently raising his
risht hand. Toward the morning he
was more quiet, and between 8 and 9
o'clock fell into nearly an unconscious
condition, which continued with
some intervals through the day. He
made occasional exclamations, but
most of them, in consequence of his
extreme weakness and apparent ina
bility to finish what ho began, were
unintelligible. About noon, howev
er be said quite distinctly, and with
some force, 'I know that my Redeem

nized various people, his daughter
many times, the members of his
household at Chappaqua, Mr. John
R. iStuart and Mr. Reid.
"On the whole, he suffered little,

New York, November 30. Iu the(
account narrating at length the clos
ing days of the late Mr. Greeley, he
is said during his western tour to
have never slept over four hours at
a time. Through the day he would
often doze in the car aud catch a
snatch of sleep. Upon his return to
Xew York his wife was found rapid-
oieepless night at her bedside that he
first began to show signs of mental
depression. On one occasion, while
the opposition press wn9 circulating
his Pittsburgh speeoh, ne said, "If
they make issue that I'm the rebel
candidate I'm bound to be defeated."
This consideration seemed to weigh
on his mind. Often when he sup
posed he was alone he would, put ins
hands to his head and cry out, "Oh"
a though suffering intense pain. At
lenetb. when his wife died, he hecan
to show manifestations of great grief
and it was tnen te is said to have
shown the first positive evidences of
mental derangement. The Novem
ber election seemingly did not inter
est him. His defeat did not seem to
surprise him. He deceived his friends
by receiving the news with indiffer
ence. On November Sth, one day
alter tne printing or ns ramoua caru,
an editorial article appeared in the
Tribune, headed, "Conclusions" It
was simply a summing np of the re
sult of the elections, in Greeley's old
style. This was his last professional
eflort. About this time he revised
flvo articles which he carfully pre
pared for tho encyclopedia. They are
entitled "Abolition," "Agriculture,"
"Anti-Masonry,,, "Caucus," "South
ern Confederacy," the latter being his
history of the "American Conllict,"
revised. Oue day later, while In con
versation with a friend, he became
visibly affected and said tcuching a
remark as to his candidature : "I
don't care for politics, and wouldn't
go on the cars to Washington to get
a commission as President. What I
do feel is the loss of my companion
of nearly forty years. I have watched
by her bed side night and day; now
I am completely worn out with anxi
ety and want of sleep."
On November 15th Mr. Greeley was
at his borne in Chappaqua, and a
prominent Liborai Republican from
Connecticut visited him and found
ui4- . ; -Pii health. In a
conversation had as to tiie cai.isn,
Mr. Greeley manifested much uncon
cern on tbe subject, and to the in
quiry whether underthe circurastan

at oueo lowacu iub maintenance 01
tho consolidation of organization, or
remain quiet and await the return of
events, he said : "Better keep quiet"
But beyond this there was nothing to
indicate that he felt any interest ia
current events. About thia time h
seemed restless and haggard ia ap
pearance. His family pbysiciaa rec
ognized it as serious and at ouce re
sorted to the most energetic treat
ment. At first it seemed as though
the malady would yield. Medical
treatment, however, proved inflec
tual. ;
