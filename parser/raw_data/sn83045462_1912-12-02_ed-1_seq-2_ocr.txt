The Supreme Court today in an opint>n
announced by Justice Day. held that

of the Sherman anti-trust law.
Justice I?a\. reading the opinion, inditeted
that the court would enter a decree

njunction to prevent tbe I'nion 1'a' itic

In announcing the opinion Justice
Day said:
"This court reaches the decision that
the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific

Here competitors engaged in interstate

I large amount of such carrying trade,
ind that since the acquisition of the

of the act.
Action Violates Law.
"In order to enforce the statute the
rourt is required to forbid the doing in

bund to have been done in violation
hereof and to enter a decree which will
ftectualty dissolve the combination rouna

"The decree should provide an injunc1on
against the right to vote this stock

Disposition of Shares.
"As the court below dismissed the
jovernment's bill, it was unnecessary
here to consider the disposition of the
hares of stock acquired by the Union
'aoiflc Company, which acquisition, we
mid. constituted an unlawful comuinaJoti
in violation of the anti-trust act.
"In order to effectually conclude the

May Present Plans.
"As to the suggestion made at the oral
irgument by the Attorney Geaertw in
sponse to a query from the court as
to ' the nature of the decree, that one
nust be entered which, while destroying
toe unlawful combination insofar as the
~nion Pacific secured control of the competing
line of ro&d extending from New
Orleans and Galveston to San Franrisco
and Portland, would permit
be Union Pacific to retain the ceni
al Pacific connection from Ogtn
to San Francisco and thereay
to control that line to the coast, thus

Pacific and Central Pacific from the Missouri
river to San Francisco as was con:emplated
by the acts of Congress under
which they were constructed, it should

Not Inventor of Motion Picture
Film, Says Judge.
PATENT RIGHTS INVALID
Assignee Declared Not Entitled to
Damages for Infringement.
PREVIOUS DECISION REVERSED
Court of Appeals of District Rules
Inventor Merely Solved Camera
Apparatus Problems.
Thomas A. Edison was not th^j inventor
of the motion picture film, his patent
thereon is invalid, and his assignee, the
Motion Picture Patents Company of NewJersey
is not entitled to an injunction
and damages for infringement of patent
rights against the Chicago Film Company 1
of Illinois, according to a decision of the i
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
rendered today.
Chief Justice Shepard for the court reversed
the decision of the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia, which had j
sustained the Edison patent and had en
joined the Chicago concern. The suit for
injunction is directed to be dismissed.
The court expresses the opinion that
the flexible transparent or translucent
tape-like film prepared by taking
photographs was neither discovered nor
produced by Edison. It was Improved
auu wi uufltlll LU lis |)rt"?rill Milif Ol P?I faction
by Eastman. When exhibited to
Edison, says the court, he seized upon
it as the thing needed to make his
camera apparatus a complete commercial
success. "He provided it with
perforations along the edges at regular
intervals into which the teeth of
ratchet wheels of the camera entered
to give it the required motion. Similar
perforations, the court finds, had been
previously made in photographic films
for feeding purposes.
Solved Big Problems.
The court makes no dissent from the
proposition advanced that Mr. Edison
solved the problems of the motion picture
art with great ingenuity and skill,
but the problems that lie solved, it finds,
were in the camera apparatus wherein
his claim to Invention lies.
In conclusion, the court holds that the
Invention of Edison was exhausted in the
construction of the camera which en- 1
abled the photographs of moving objects
to be taken upon the Eastman film In 1
the distinct, uniform and satisfactory .
manner justly claimed for them.
The pictures are the direct result of
the mechanism of the camera, with the j
Eastman mechanically adapted to and (
applied therein, the court said.
The effect of the decision of the Appellate
Court, according to Attorney
Melville Church, who represented the
Chicago company, will be to release
motion pictures from patent rights. If
the lower court had been sustained, the
Edison company would have been entitled
to royalties for three more years,
it was stated.
REITERATES ITS OPINION
United States Supreme Court
Holds Kansas Corporation
Law Unconstitutional.
the Supreme Court of the United States
today reiterated Ha opinion that the Kan- |
sas corporation law, closing Kansas j
state courts to foreign corporations without
a certificate to do business in the
state, was unconstitutional. Two years
ago the law was declared unconstitutional
by the court as a burden on interstate
commerce. This year it was contended
in another caae that it was not unconstitutional
as to foreign corporations
seeking to enforce in Kansas judgments
obtained in other states.
The point arose in the suit of the
Buck's Stove and Range Company and
other corporations to subject the ranch
of P. B. Maxson of Saline county, Kan.,
to satisfying a judgment against C. C.
Vickers of Texas.

Only Brief Sessions Held.
Today's meetings of both houses were
brief. There were simply the prayers
by the chaplains, the calling of the roll,
the passage of the routine motions notifying
the President that Congress had
assembled, the formal announcements of
deaths in the membership of Congress
arid adjournment out of respect to the
deceased.

both houses. In the Senate, the impeachment
trial of Judge Robert W. Archbald
of the Commerce Court will be begun,
but little Is expected to be accomplished
until Wednesday. The Senate's
time between now and the Christmas
holidays, will practically all be taken up
with the trial. The House will, within a
few days begin consideration of the
first of the fifteen annual appropriations
to be passed this session, and the work
on the supply bills will be practically continuous
until March 4.
During the session the Senate is expected
to take some action on three big
bills now pending on its calendar?the
Sheppanl-Kenyoji bill for the restriction
of the interstate shipment of liquor, the
Page bill to give federal aid to vocational
and agricultural schools and colleges, and
the Works resolution fixing the presidential
term at six years and urohibitlng reelection.
SENATE ADJOURNS
AFTER A SESSION OF
TWENTY-TWO MINUTES
The Senate adjourned its first session
after but twenty-two minutes of work,
out of respect for the memory of V ice
President Sherman, and Senators Heyburn
and Rayner, who had died during
the congressional recess.
As the Senate roll call concluded, show
iiia quorum present, Senator Gallinger
offered a resolution, directing the secretary
to inform the House that the Senate
was prepared for work. The adoption of
this was followed by the presentation by
Senator Cullom of the customary resolution
to api?oint members of the Joint committee
to notify the President that Congress
had assembled.
Senators Cullom and Martin were
named by Mr. Bacon to act as the delegates
from the Senate.
Senator l.udge followed with a motion
that the Senate meet tomorrow at 11
o'clock. This was adopted without debate,
the purpose being to give, time for
the reading of President Taft's message
before the hour set for the convening
of the Archbald court of impeachment,
at 12:30 o'clock.
Fallowing the brief work of organization,
Senator Hoot of New York gave
the Senate the formal notification
of the death of Vice President Sherman.
"It is with a deep sense of personal
loss that I rise to make the announcement
of the death the 30th of October
of James Schoolcraft Sherman. Vice
President of the United States," said
Senator Root.
"His serene and cheerful temperament,
inspired by love of country and
of his kind, will no more diffuse through
this body the sense of reasonableness

adopted, conveying the Senate's sympathy
to the family of the late Vice President.
Senator Borali presented the notification
of the death of his colleague. Senator

that of the" death of Senator Rayner.
Again resolutions of sorrow were
adopted, and in tribute to the. three men
the Senate adjourned without further

LEADERS IN HOUSE
GREETED WITH CHEERS
BY THEIR ASSOCIATES
It was a noisy and talkative House of
Representatives that subsided promptly
at noon today, when Speaker Clark
banged the reading desk and said:
"The House will be in order."
The gavel rapped sharply many times,
but it had to contend against the loud
cheers, the hurrahs and handclHpping
that had broken o*ut as the Speaker appeared
in the House chamber. It was a
regular old-time demonstration in which
every one of the members joined, regardless
of party.
Thn ctn llnrlbe uroro crnnrHnil Onu hnH
to have a special card of admittance to
see the opening of the third session of
the Sixty-second Congress. Doorkeepers,
posted everywhere, and reinforced
with stout House employes, refused
to let any one In unless a special
card, issued for today only, was presented.
Members of the Congressional
Club, bundled In flowers, occupied me
of the east galleries, and for ti is occasion
only several photographers were
posted about In the gallef) fs, and snapshotted
thfs inteaestirrg scehe^tob the
floor below.' ,
Speaker's Office Crowded.
Speaker Clark's office was besieged
with friends who wanted admission cards
early in the day, but there were only a
few to be had. Returning congressmen
dropped in to see him and to pledge their
support In the vote for Speaker of the
next House. Representative Sulzer and
a host of other representatives, some of
them piloting friends from home, were
among the early callers on the Speaker.
Mrs. Clark and Miss Genevieve Clark
entertained a big party of friends in
the Speaker's gallery to witness the
opening scenes. The appearance of
Mrs. Martin B. Littleton, wife of the
representative from New York, was one
of the features of the day, as she called
on the Speaker with a big armful of
petitions for the governmental purchase
of Monticello, home of Jefferson.
Just after Mrs. Littleton went in to
see the Speaker and show him the
petitions. Representative Levy of New
York went into Mr. Clark's office.
Representative Levy owns Montieello
and refuses to sell it.

The members of the House acted exactly
as If they were an overjoyful lot of
happy school boys. The handshakings,
welcomlngs, congratulations were much
more important, evidently than anything
else.
"Uncle Joe" Cannon was surrounded by
scores of men as soon as he set foot in
the aisle on which his desk is located.
Representative Uongworth was another
republican who was the center of attraction
for many minutes; Victor Murdock
could hardly find his seat for the crowd
which pressed about him; Philip Campbell
of Kansas, militant always against
the third-termer, was slapped on the
back and his hand shaken by dozens of
his friends.
Oscar Underwood smiled his way
through at least a hundred men who
tried to stampede him as he appeared
in the. cloakroom door. Minority Leader
Mann, looking cooler, calmer, and.
If possible, wiser than ever, ran about
the floor of the House looking up the
"old guard," and Seretio Payne towered
above everv one on the renublican side.
while Senator-elect OUle James of
Kentucky was the gigantic figure on
the democratic wing.
Leaders Are Cheered.
Scarcely had the chaplain said "Amen"
when Governor-elect Sulzer appeared
and there was a roar of applause. The
Speaker banged the gavel in vain. The
clerk began the roll call, but the members
fell to talking with one another, leaning
over desks and making it almost impossible
to hear a name.
James M. Cox of Ohio, governor-elect
of that state, received an ovation when
liia name was called. Democrats and republicans
alike cheered him and he was
forced to bow his acknowledgments.
Representative Underwood, leader of
the democratic side, was cheered when he
arose to present the usual resolution asking
that a committee be sent to the President
Informing him that the House had
met. The Speaker appointed Mr. Underwood
as chairman, with Representative
Johnson of Kentucky and Representative
Mann of Illinois.
Representative Fitzgerald of New York
presented the regular resolution that requires
the House to send a messenger to
the Senate and inform that body that the
House has opened its deliberations. Representative
Hay of Virginia offered a. resolution
fixing noon for the hour of convening
daily.
Four new members were sworn in by
the Speaker. These were Archibald Hart,
who succeeds Hughes, now a senator;
George Scott of Iowa, who succeeds the
late Representative Hubbard; E. A. Merritt,
jr.. succeeding Representative Malsby
of New York, who died last session,
and Dr. Lazaro of Louisiana, succeeding

FIRM ON PASSPORT QUESTION.
Sulzer Announces Attitude in Regard
to Russian Treaty.
"No discrimination against American
passports in Russia'* will be the motto
under which the House committee on foreign
affairs will work this session, according
to Representative William Sulzer,
chairman, and Govemor-eleet of the state
of New York. The committee has several
important items of legislation to frame
for this session and meetings will be frequent.
i "A new treaty with Russia is being negotiated,"
said Mr. Sulzer today, "and
the matter is progressing favorably. The
United States will take no backward step
and no treaty will be recognized by Congress
unless American passports are honored,
regardless of race and creed, and
unless the doctrine of expatriation is recognized
by the contracting parties."

SEND IN FIRST BILL.
Commissioners Urge Extension of
Two Thoroughfares.
A bill authorizing the extension of 25th
street and White place, from Minnesota
avenue to Park place, southeast, was
sent to Congress today by the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia, this
being the first measure to be recommended
by the Commissioners during the short
session of Congress.
In a report accompanying the measure
the District heads say that the extension
of the street is necessary to provide adequate
Ingress and egress to property of
this subdivision, and that it is desired by
the property owners in the locality.
It is proposed to assess as benefits
against abutting and adjacent property
the entire amount found as damages. The
area Included in the proposed extension
of 25th street is 26,200 square feet, and
for the extension of White place, 1,850
feet, the total cost of the acquisition of
both pieces of ground being estimated at
about $1,000. ;

and it was the intention of the two occupants
to place a trunk against the door
before retiring, but they neglected to do
so. Miss Kearney's version of the affair
follows:
"Miss Detweiler and I were asleep. I
was awakened by hearing a slight noise
near the foot of the bed. I believed that
.vnss uetwenor nan gotten out 01 nea.
As I looked tip. however, I instantly saw
I was mistaken.
"A man wearing a handkerchief over
his face was pointing a revolver at me
and telling me to keep still," she said.
"He went over to the bureau and picked
up my Jewelry. I asked him not to take
it, and he, saying it was no good, dropped
it. Miss Detweiled then woke up,
and I suppose the man thought she would
scream, for he pointed the revolver at her
and ordered her to be silent.
"He turned on a pocket flashlight he
carried and searched the top of the bureau.
He said he wanted money. I told
him my purse was in the bureau drawer.
He opened it and took $19. Miss Detweiler
did not tell him where her purse
was concealed, but he soon found it when
he opened another bureau drawer. He
took $9.0U.
"I asked him why he was committing
robbery," Miss Kearney said, "and he
replied that he was hungry.
"I then asked. "What do you suppose
we are going to do to get something
to eat?' "
The burglar pulled the door shut behind
him and went toward the front
door. Miss Detweiler got out of bed,
and. looking through te keyhole,
watched him. She said as he neared
the front door he pulled the handkerchief
from his face. and. opening the
door, left the house.
Mrs. R. Hamilton Williams, who occupies
a room at the house. 10th and
Grant place, northwest, furbished the
police with a description of the next
visit of the burglar.
Mrs. Williams, told the police he was
in her room about 4 o'clock. He carried
an electric flash light and a revolver.
She screamed when she awakened and
saw him, and he ran from the room
and left the house. Nothing was found
missing.
It is the belief of the police that the
same burglar committed the two robberies
and made the other attempt.

Debs, Indicted in Kansas, Says
He Will Make Prosecutors
Sorry.
TERRB HAUTE, lnd., December 2.?
Eugene V. Debs, socialist candidate for
President, who was indicted by a federal
grand jury in Kansas recently on a
charge of obstructing justice, yesterday
dictated this statement:
T am going to tell them to go straight
to hell. They can put me in jail if they
want to, but before they get through I
will turn their courts and jails bottom
side up. It will take some time to do
it, but I will live long enough to see it
done.
"I may go to the penitentiary, but if,
I do they will wish they had let me
alone. Stories will be brought out on
Bone that will make him wish he had
never been born. I don't care how
quickly the marshal comes, but there
will be something doing after they arrest
me."
The charge on which Eugene V. Debs
was indicted by a Kansas federal grand
jury is that of "obstructing justice." It
is charged that ne and socialists of local
prominence paid a government witness
named McDonough $250 to leave the state
and go to California. It is alleged that
McDonough was to have been used by \
the state as a witness in a contempt

Chance for De Lacy as Judge '

MAKES REPLY TO CHARGES
Accompanies Attorney General to

HEW POSTMASTER FOR DALLAS
Appointment Made Following Fierce
Competition?Senators and Others
Call to See Taft.
President Taft is getting pretty close
to the nomination of A judge of the Juvenile.
Court, judging from events at the
White House. Attorney General Wickersham
was the first visitor to the_executive
offices today and consulted the President
as to a number of matters, finally
taking tip the Juvenile Court position.
Judge De Iaicy himself took part in the
conference, the discussion being upon his
reappointment for another term He was
asked to the White House by the President.
who desired. It is believed, to make
inquiry as to some of the charges against
the presiding officer of the Juvenile Court
Attorney General Wickers ham took
Judge De I-acy to the Department of
Justice on leaving the White House and
there, it is presumed, explanations followed
as to some of the Objections made
to Judge De Dae v. Mr. Wickersham bus
on tile all the papers in the case and the
President instructed him to go over some
of the Objections that had been made to
Judge De Lacy and report later to him.
It is known that Judge De Lacy made
a most excellent impression up%n the
President and that his explanation of the
charges against him was most effective.
Jude De Lacy's renomination now looks
more probable than at any time in
mnn f Ha
Charges of General Character.
None of the charges touched the character
or legal learning of Judge De I-aoy.
They have begn of a general order and
dealing with alleged lack of tact and
judgment, together with the intimation
that he has been injudicious along certain
denominational lines. The charges
have lacked definiteness and detail.
Those who have defended Judge De Lacy
have declared that he has been much
misrepresented and misunderstood, and
that he has tilled a most trying position
under difficulties that would make enemies,
regardless of what he did.
Favorable to Judge De Lacy is the
fact that President Taft. having been
a judge himself, believes that judges
should be continued In office if there
are no vital reasons to the contrary.
Mr. Wickersham will sift all the facts
and report to the President. Unless lie
makes strong objection to Judge De
Lacy the probabilities are that the Juvenile
Court judge will get another term,
If confirmed toy the Senate, in which body
there will, it is said, be a fight against
him, but in which his friends say he
will be victorious.
Mr. Wickersham has been credited
with leaning toward Stanley Finch,
who is at the head of the Investigating
bureau of the Department of Justice,
but this would apply only in case the
Attorney Qeneral considered Judge De
Lacy unfitted for another ttrm. Mr.
Finch is likely to lose his place to a
democrat after March 4 next.
Strongly mentioned for the position, in
the event Judge De Lacy is not named
by the President, is "Gus" Schuldt, assistant
prosecutor In the Police Court.
The President has been told that Mr.
Schuldt would be a good man for the
place, having had much experience with
cases of the kind that arise daily in the
Juvenile Court. A number of other names
are before the President, all with strong
backing.
Dallas Postmaster Retires.
Sloan Simpson, postmaster at Dallas,
Tex., will fall of getting another term,
the President today having named George
F. Rockhold for the place. There was a
big fight over the post office, Simpson
having strong backing, but the republican
powers in the state being stanchly against
him.
Representative Burgess of Texas, democrat,
calling on the President today, declared
that "no right-thinking man would
blame the President" for removing the
two United States marshals In Texas who
were put out of office there for pernicious
political activity.
The President's visitors today included
Senators Root and Guggenheim and Representatives
Longworth, Willis and Taylor
of Ohio. Mr. lx>ngworth was warmly
greeted by the President.
Representative Bartholdt today arranged
with the President to receive Thursday
in the east room loo representatives
from the I-Akes-to-the-gulf Deeper
Waterways Association. This delegation
will present resolutions adopted by the
recent convention at Memphis and talk
with the President about the project of a
great waterway from the lakes to the
Gulf of Mexico.
Governors to Attend Conference.
A conference will be held at the White
House next Saturday upon the subject
of agricultural credit systems to which
the President has invited the governors of
the state following their annual conference
at Richmond, Va. Much of the responsibility
for the successful establishment
and operation of agricultural credit
systems in the United States would neces- ,
sarily rest upon the state governments,
and the President desires to take ad- 1
vantage of this opportunity to discuss
this point with the governors. .
The American ambassador to France, '
Myron T. Herrick, and Senator Fletcher,
president of the Southern Commercial
Congress, will be present at the confer- 1
ence. Ambassador Herrick is in .-barge
of the State Department's investigation
of the European systems of agricultural '
credit and will give the governors his :
views as to the need of constructing a i
new ilnancial system to meet the credit
requirements of American farmers rather (

"Contrary to the contemptible published

District Attorney Miller, addressing the
court, "the government has no desire t<j

Reason for Davis' Discharge.
"In the case of Davis the evidence is
conclusive that he is guilty as a con- .
spirator. -His letters as an executive
board member of the ironworkers union

It is that he retired from th?

first witness for the defense.
Ryan at Headquarters Seldom.
Ryan is charged with promoting a dynamite
conspiracy by writing letters as
president of the ironworkers' union and
by appropriating as an executive board
member money with which John J. McNatnara
bought explosives.
Ryan testified he became president of
the union in 1905, succeeding Frank
Buchanan, now a member of Congress.
McNamara, until after his arrest as a
dynamiter, remained the union's secretary-treasurer.
the witness said
In line with the defense's contention
that McNamara alone knew the union's
funds were being used for dynamiting
non-union jobs. Ryan said he visited
the union headquarters at Indianapolis
only about two days each month.
